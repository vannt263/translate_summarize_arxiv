    "a quiver is connected if it is path - connected as a 1-complex , i.e. if each edge corresponds to a 1-cell and each vertex a 0-cell and the graph theoretic definition defines the gluing maps .",
    "we will mostly consider connected quivers as the general case does not present many new features .",
    "let @xmath0 be a group .",
    "a @xmath0-_valued representation _ ( or @xmath0-_marking _ ) of @xmath1 is a set mapping @xmath51 .",
    "the @xmath0-valued representations form a set which is denoted by @xmath52 or just by @xmath53 when the quiver is understood .",
    "note that there is a canonical identification by the evaluation map : @xmath54    with respect to the vertices we similarly define the group @xmath55 here , the group law is given by component - wise multiplication : @xmath56 , for all @xmath57 , and @xmath58 .",

    "lastly , @xmath66    when @xmath0 is an algebraic group , the set @xmath67 forms an affine algebraic variety which will be called the @xmath0-representation variety of @xmath1 . in this case",
    ", the action is algebraic since in each factor it arises from left multiplication of an algebraic group and right multiplication composed with inversion in an algebraic group ; all of which are given by polynomial mappings .    in order to consider moduli of quiver representations ,",
    "let us first recall the theory of affine quotients by complex reductive groups .",
    "an algebraic group is a group that is an algebraic variety ( zero set of a finite number of polynomials ) such that the group operations are all regular ( polynomial ) mappings .",
    "a complex affine group is an algebraic group that is the complex points of an affine variety .",
    "any affine group has a faithful linear representation ( see @xcite for instance ) , thus it is a closed subgroup of a general linear group and hence a linear lie group .",
    "lie groups are smooth , and irreducible complex varieties are connected ( see for instance @xcite page 321 ) .",
    "let @xmath5 be a compact lie group .",
    "then @xmath5 is a real algebraic group which embeds in @xmath68 for some @xmath44 .",
    "since @xmath5 is algebraic there is an ideal @xmath69 in the real coordinate ring @xmath70 $ ] defining its points .",
    "let @xmath71 be the complex zeros of @xmath69 , called the _ complexification _ of @xmath5 .",
    "then @xmath0 is a complex affine subgroup of @xmath72 with coordinate ring @xmath73=\\mathbb{r}[k]\\otimes_{\\mathbb{r}}{\\mathbb{c}}$ ] .",
    "any complex affine group @xmath0 which arises in this fashion is called _ reductive_. the `` unitary trick '' shows @xmath42 is reductive .",
    "we note that this definition , although not the most general , coincides with more general notions of reductivity when the algebraic group is complex linear . in particular ,",
    "another equivalent definition is that a complex linear algebraic group @xmath0 is reductive if for every finite dimensional representation of @xmath0 all subrepresentations have invariant complements .",
    "the important observation is that such groups act like and have the algebraic structure of compact groups .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath74 , where @xmath75 is the @xmath76 identity matrix and @xmath77 is the transpose of @xmath10 .",
    "writing @xmath78 , we have that @xmath79 @xmath80 which sits isomorphically in @xmath81 as @xmath82 letting @xmath83 be arbitrary in @xmath84 realizes the complexification @xmath85 . in this way @xmath86 becomes the real locus of the complex variety @xmath84 .",
    "similarly , @xmath87 .",
    "we have not assumed @xmath5 is connected .",

    "also , in this section we again assume that all quivers are connected .      as additional consequences of the previous results",
    ", we will now relate the moduli space of @xmath0-valued quiver representations to the usual moduli spaces of quiver representations with a dimension vector which is constant , with all entries equal to @xmath474 . to avoid confusion , the latter will be sometimes called additive quiver representations . for additive quiver representations",
    "we mainly follow the exposition @xcite .",
    "fix a quiver @xmath475 . recall that when @xmath476 is a constant dimension vector , so that @xmath477 for all @xmath478 , and @xmath471 is a complex vector space of dimension @xmath267 , @xmath479 is the space of quiver representations in @xmath471 .",
    "we say that such a ( additive ) quiver representation @xmath480 is _ invertible _ if all its components @xmath481 are in @xmath482 .",
    "it is clear that we have a canonical inclusion@xmath483 obtained by mapping a @xmath484-quiver representation to the corresponding representation in @xmath471 .",
    "the image of @xmath485 is clearly the set of invertible quiver representations in @xmath471 , denoted @xmath486 , and it is an open dense set in @xmath487 .",
    "note also that the dimension of the space of equidimensional additive quiver representation ( see @xcite ) coincides with the formula given in corollary [ cor : dimension ] when @xmath488 .",
    "let @xmath489 and @xmath490 denote the moduli space of invertible quiver representations .",
    "[ invertiblequiver ] let @xmath1 be a quiver and @xmath471 be a vector space .",
    "the moduli space of invertible quiver representations @xmath491 is isomorphic , as an affine algebraic variety , to the character variety @xmath492 , where @xmath493 .",
    "this is just a special case of theorem [ charvarquiverequal ] for @xmath494 .",
    "the natural action ( [ eq : action ] ) of @xmath33 on @xmath224 that we have been considering , corresponds naturally to the usual action of @xmath495 on @xmath487 .",
    "however , it is not generally true that a closed orbit in @xmath224 will be closed in @xmath487 ( under the embedding @xmath485 above ) , as simple examples show .",
    "we now examine this phenomena as it is necessary to compare the algebro - geometric quotients @xmath496    by a general theorem on representations of algebras @xcite , we know that a given element @xmath497 has a closed orbit if and only if it is semisimple , that is , it is a direct sum of simple representations of @xmath1 ( those without proper subrepresentations ) .",
    "therefore the affine quotient @xmath498 parametrizes equivalence classes of semisimple quiver representations in @xmath471 .",
    "denote the set of semisimple representations by @xmath499 , and let @xmath500    let @xmath484 .",
    "we can picture what we have been discussing , using a diagram that relates @xmath501-quiver representations and usual quiver representations ( compare to the diagram in @xcite ) :    @xmath502    we will now study some of the maps involved in the above diagram .",
    "we say that a vertex @xmath478 is a _ sink _ if all arrows containing @xmath503 point towards @xmath503 , or equivalently , there are no arrows coming out from @xmath503 .",
    "similarly , we say that @xmath478 is a _ source _ if all arrows containing @xmath503 point away from @xmath503 .",
    "a source or a sink will be called an _ end _ of @xmath1 .",
    "an _ oriented cycle _ in a quiver is a path of arrows which beings and ends at the same vertex , by always following the directions provided by the arrows .",
    "one can characterize quivers with no ends as those having a path joining any two points by always following the arrows .",
    "in other words , a quiver with no ends is `` oriented - path - connected '' .",
    "also , note that quivers without oriented cycles always have ends . on the other hand , a quiver without any oriented cycles",
    "is called _ acyclic _ , and so a quiver with no ends might otherwise be called _ super - cyclic_.    a nice property of a representation of a super - cyclic quiver is that closed orbits are preserved under the embedding @xmath504 .",

    "now , since @xmath1 has no ends , the arrow @xmath524 is in a cycle formed by the sequence @xmath525 such that @xmath526 .",
    "so , the repetition of the argument above for the other arrows in the same cycle will imply that @xmath527 for all @xmath528 .",
    "so we conclude:@xmath529 so the only solution is to have all weights equal in that cycle .",
    "since the quiver is connected , we conclude that @xmath530 is constant for all @xmath478 .",
    "on the other hand , we are assuming that @xmath531 .",
    "this means that , for at least one arrow , say @xmath532 , the corresponding limit @xmath533 belongs to @xmath534 , so that @xmath535 . but this forces @xmath536 in equation ( [ eq : weight - limit ] ) which contradicts the equality of all the weights , asserted before , and which was a consequence of our hypothesis .",

    "all these arrows belong to oriented cycles . because of this @xmath566 is indeed a closed orbit by theorem [ thm : preserve - closed ] .",
