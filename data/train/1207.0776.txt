    "axion - like particles ( alps ) are very light pseudo - scalar bosons @xmath7 with a two - photon coupling @xmath8 which are predicted by several extensions of the standard model like four - dimensional ordinary and supersymmetric models ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , kaluza - klein theories ( see e.g.  @xcite ) and especially superstring theories ( see e.g.  @xcite ) ( for a review , see  @xcite ) . in the presence of an external magnetic field , the @xmath8 coupling entails that interaction eigenstates differ from propagation eigenstates thereby leading to the phenomenon of photon - alp conversion @xmath9 and in particular to photon - alp oscillations  @xcite .",
    "this mixing effect is exploited to search for generic alps in light - shining - through - the - wall experiments ( see e.g. the alps  @xcite and the gammev  @xcite experiments ) , for solar alps ( see e.g. the cast experiment  @xcite ) and for alp dark matter  @xcite in micro - wave cavity experiments ( see e.g. the admx experiment  @xcite ) .",
    "photon - alp oscillations would also lead to intriguing signatures in astrophysical and cosmological observations  @xcite .",
    "in particular , over the last few years it has been realized that the @xmath10 coupling can also produce detectable effects in the observations of distant active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , since photons emitted by these sources can mix with alps during their propagation through large - scale magnetic fields  @xcite . in this context ,",
    "photon - alp oscillations  @xcite provide a natural mechanism to drastically reduce the absorption of very high - energy ( vhe ) photons by pair production processes ( @xmath11 ) on the extragalactic background light ( ebl ) above roughly 100 gev . in this respect ,",
    "recent observations of cosmologically distant gamma - ray sources by ground - based gamma - ray imaging atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( iacts ) have revealed a surprising degree of transparency of the universe to vhe photons  @xcite . this result has been confirmed by a recent systematic analysis performed on 25 high - energy photon sources , which pointed out a suppression of the pair production during the propagation of vhe photons , named `` pair production anomaly ''  @xcite .",
    "oscillations between vhe photons and alps can represent an intriguing  but not unique , see e.g. @xcite possibility to explain this anomaly .",
    "indeed , if vhe photons are transformed into a mixed photon - alp state , the alp component does not suffer from absorption effects while it propagates and can therefore reach the earth from distant sources even at very - high energies . in this sense ,",
    "two complementary mechanisms have been proposed : a ) vhe photon - alp conversions in the magnetic fields around gamma - ray sources and then further back - conversions in the magnetic field of the milky - way  @xcite ; b ) oscillations of vhe photons into alps in the turbulent extragalactic magnetic fields  @xcite .",
    "both these mechanisms are intriguing , but are affected by possible drawbacks . in particular , concerning the mechanism a ) it is not clear at all whether a conversion @xmath12 actually takes place in all agn mainly because their magnetic field is quite complicated and poorly known ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . on the other hand , mechanism b ) requires intergalactic magnetic fields @xmath13  ng close to the current upper bounds , for which there is no firm observational evidence , or , alternatively , a very large @xmath10 coupling , at a level already excluded by other independent observations .",
    "the aim of the present paper is to investigate in detail a third possibility concerning agn hosted in clusters of galaxies , where a first conversion @xmath12 occurs in the magnetic field of the cluster while a reconversion @xmath14 happens in the magnetic field of the milky way .",
    "this scenario has two important advantages .",
    "first , we are dealing with magnetic fields that are _ known _ to a considerable extent .",
    "second , since a sizable fraction of the original photons travel all the time as alps , the overall ebl absorption is strongly reduced . as a consequence , a significant hardening of the vhe spectra of distant agn located in galaxy clusters is expected .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we consider the observational evidence of agn producing vhe photons in galaxy clusters . in sec .",
    "3 we review the formalism describing the photon - alp mixing .",
    "in particular , we discuss the mechanism of photon - alp oscillations in random magnetic fields which is relevant for @xmath12 conversions in galaxy clusters . in sec .",
    "4 we address the effect of photon - alp oscillations on vhe photon spectra , describing the @xmath12 conversions in the intra - cluster magnetic fields , the absorption of photons in the intergalactic medium and the @xmath14 conversions in the milky way magnetic field .",
    "we show how our mechanism can lead to a characteristic hardening of vhe photon spectra for distant sources at @xmath15 . as a specific example",
    "we discuss in sec .  5 the effect on the energy spectra of two agns located in galaxy clusters , namely mkn 501 at @xmath2  @xcite and 1es 0414 + 009 at redshift @xmath1  @xcite .",
    "finally , in sec .",
    "6 we discuss future perspectives and we present our conclusions .",
    "the bulk of extra - galactic sources of vhe @xmath0-rays has been identified with x - ray emitting agn ( see e.g.  @xcite ) , which can be roughly described as an accretion disk around a supermassive black hole and two jets emanating from the centre and perpendicular to the disk .",
    "when one of the jet is directed towards us the agn is called a blazar .",
    "blazars  @xcite are divided into two broad groups : bl lacs and flat spectrum radio quasars ( fsrqs ) .",
    "bl lacs are defined by the weakness of their thermal features like broad emission lines in their optical spectra .",
    "accordingly , the nuclear region of bl lacs , where the jet forms and accelerates is believed to be rather poor of soft photons . on the other hand ,",
    "fsrqs display luminous broad emission lines , indicating the existence of photo - ionized clouds rapidly rotating around the central black hole and forming the so - called broad line region ( blr ) at about one parsec from the centre .",
    "bl lacs are believed to be fanaroff - riley i type galaxies  @xcite .",
    "high spatial resolution optical observations indicate that the host galaxies of x - ray selected bl lacs are typically giant elliptical galaxies @xcite .",
    "imaging observations of the environment of 45 blazars up to @xmath16 indicate that the bulk of investigated objects avoid rich clusters  @xcite .",
    "however , according to a recent study of sloan digitial sky survey data including spectroscopic redshift information for objects with @xmath17 , bl lacs are found both in low and high density large scale environment @xcite",
    ". the sub - sample of vhe - emitting blazars appears to populate both rich clusters as well as unspecific environments @xcite . at this regard , in table  [ tab : sources ]",
    "we present a sample of blazars at different redshifts which have been found to be located in galaxy clusters .",
    "moreover , for a few blazars not directly associated with a galaxy cluster , it can well happen that the line - of - sight traverses an intervening galaxy cluster .",
    ".a sample of blazars in clusters of galaxies  @xcite .",

    "[ fig5 ] we consider the spectra of 1es 0414 + 009 ( upper plot ) and mkn 501 ( lower plot ) using the frv ebl model  @xcite .",
    "the observed spectra ( black bullets ) are corrected for ebl absorption with and without alps .",
    "this yields the data points shown as dark and light gray bullets , respectively .",
    "the ebl absorption corrected spectra are subsequently fitted with a power law ( 1es 0414 + 009 ) and a logarithmic parabola ( mkn 501 ) , represented by the light blue ( no alps ) and dark blue bow ties ( with alps ) .",
    "the final fit parameters are shown in table [ tab : fitpar ] .",
    "the difference in the observed spectra becomes prominent beyond @xmath18tev ( 1es 0414 + 009 ) and @xmath19tev ( mkn 501 ) , respectively , where the @xmath20 conversion ( dark blue dashed lines ) predicts a substantial flux enhancement .",
    "unfortunately , with the present data it is impossible to distinguish the two scenarios .",
    "we also remark that with alps , the emitted photon flux at low energies has to be larger than in the case of conventional physics in order to describe the observations .",
    "the reason is that more photons convert into alps in the cluster than the other way around in the milky way and the absorption at low energies is negligible .",
    "the same analysis is repeated for the minimal ebl kneiske model  @xcite and the corresponding results are shown in fig .",
    "the difference between the ebl models is marginal since the spectra are dominated at high energies by the alps that re - convert into photons in the milky way .",
    "finally , the boost factor of the flux intensity with respect to conventional physics @xmath21 is plotted in the lower panels fig .",
    "[ fig5][fig6 ] for the frv ebl model  @xcite and for the minimal ebl kneiske model  @xcite , respectively .",
    "one realizes that when alp - photon conversions are effective , they can produce @xmath22 thereby implying a strong enhancement of the observable photon flux with respect to expectations based on conventional physics alone .",
    "vhe @xmath0-ray observations offer the possibility to indirectly probe the existence of alps predicted in many extensions of the standard model . in this respect ,",
    "@xmath20 conversions of vhe photons in the presence of cosmic magnetic fields have been recently proposed as an intriguing mechanism to explain the surprising high degree of transparency of the universe to vhe photons recently observed in different high - redshift sources . in the present work",
    "we have explored the further possibility of @xmath12 conversions in the magnetic field of galaxy clusters which frequently host vhe emitting blazars and subsequent @xmath14 regeneration in the magnetic field of the galaxy .",
    "we have shown that this mechanism can produce a significant hardening of the vhe photon spectrum of blazars located in clusters of galaxies .",
    "more specifically , the signature of this effect in iacts allows to infer the existence of ultra - light alps with mass @xmath4  ev and photon - alp coupling @xmath5  gev@xmath6 .",
    "we expect that such a signature would start to emerge at energies @xmath23  tev . therefore , they are barely testable with the present generation of iacts like h.e.s.s .",
    "@xcite , magic @xcite , veritas @xcite , and cangaroo - iii @xcite , covering energies in the range from @xmath24  50  gev to @xmath24  50  tev .",
    "a clear - cut check can only come from the planned cherenkov telescope array ( cta ) @xcite and high altitude water cherenkov experiment ( hawc ) @xcite , reaching energies of 100 tev with much higher sensitivity , or even with the hiscore detector , reaching pev energies @xcite .",
    "a peculiar feature of the proposed mechanism is that since the magnetic fields in galaxy clusters have a turbulent nature , the @xmath12 conversion probabilities present a large variance depending on the line of sight crossed by the photon / alp beam inside the cluster .",
    "this fact suggests that our proposal could not be an universal mechanism to produce the transparency of the universe to vhe photons .",
    "but if a large number of agn in galaxy clusters were observed with large spectral variations this would be a positive evidence for our proposal .",
    "we also remark that even if an agn is not located inside a galaxy cluster , there is a nontrivial chance that in some cases its line of sight crosses a cluster of galaxies .",
    "we plan to investigate what happens in this instance in a future work .",
    "remarkably , an independent laboratory check of the ultra - light alps discussed in our scenario can be performed with the planned upgrade of the photon regeneration experiment alps at desy  @xcite and with the next generation solar axion detector iaxo ( international axion observatory )  @xcite .",
    "this confirms once more the nice synergy between astrophysical and laboratory searches to find axion - like particles .",
