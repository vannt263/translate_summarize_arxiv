    "<S> in contrast , above the threshold @xmath58 , we find that dws and sss with maximal imbalance are favored , while usual mi and sf are completely suppressed  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> for minimized scattering ( @xmath45 ) , the classical light can not build up at all , and quantum fluctuations take the leading role [ fig.[dminjd](a ) ] . at fixed density per site , </S>",
    "<S> the quantum light - matter fluctuations effectively renormalize the on - site interaction from @xmath25 to @xmath59 in each component . </S>",
    "<S> thus , changing the light - matter coupling , one can shift the sf - mi transition point . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs because the light - induced atomic fluctuations now enter the effective hamiltonian , and these fluctuations need to be suppressed to minimize the energy . </S>",

    "<S> now , multiple terms @xmath79 in eq . ( [ mdecomp ] ) become important . </S>",
    "<S> we present a phase diagram for various scattering angles ( inducing @xmath40 modes ) for strong on - site interaction with maximal light scattering [ fig.[dminjd](b ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath40-mode induced pattern competes with on - site interaction modifying the density distribution . therefore </S>",
    "<S> , multiple dws of period @xmath40 can coexist with sf , forming multicomponent sss . </S>",
    "<S> surprisingly , at half - filling for @xmath80 odd , ss exists . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath81 changes from zero , checkerboard insulators form for even @xmath40 while different kinds of ss exist for odd @xmath40 . </S>",
    "<S> the on - site interaction limits atomic fluctuations producing gapped sf components when ss exists . as @xmath40  increases , </S>",
    "<S> additional dws with different periods and amplitudes emerge . </S>",
    "<S> these form unstable mixed state configurations ( @xmath82 ) for @xmath83 and stable multicomponent ss for @xmath84 . </S>",
    "<S> these occur in between regular ss phases with dws of period @xmath40 and different amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> as the light induces atomic fluctuations , these generate competition between small and large amplitude dws until saturation in the sf component occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the system reaches a configuration , similar to the maximal imbalance dw state described above for scattering at @xmath5 .    </S>",
    "<S> we find a novel phase transition , when light scattering from the bonds at @xmath5 ( @xmath85 , @xmath38 ) is maximized ( @xmath56 ) . even in the absence of on - site interaction , </S>",
    "<S> a transition from normal sf to the superfluid dimer ( sfd ) state appears . </S>",
    "<S> sfd is a sf state in which the complex order parameter has alternating ( zero and non - zero ) phase difference between pairs of sites , and its amplitude is modulated as well . </S>",
    "<S> this occurs because of the competition between the kinetic energy bh terms , which promote a homogeneous sf , with the light - induced interaction that favors sf components with alternating phases across every other site [ fig.[dminjb](a ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the phase of light interference flips from bond to bond [ such that the phase difference at neighboring bonds is @xmath86 , fig.[dminjb](a ) ] . in the hamiltonian </S>",
    "<S> , this corresponds to alternating signs in front of matter - field coherences between the neighboring sites ( i.e. products of complex order parameters , in mean - field treatment ) . to minimize the energy ( and maximize the light scattering ) the quantum matter fields self - organize such that the matter - field phase difference between neighboring sites flips as well to compensate for the imposed light - field phase flip . </S>",
    "<S> the dimer configurations have high degeneracy as the full many - body ground - state is composed of several equivalent arrangements of the phase pattern in space  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagram is shown in  fig.[dminjb](b ) . moreover , in the presence of on - site interaction the system supports a transition to the supersolid dimer ( ssd ) state with modulated densities [ fig.[dminjb](c ) ] . </S>",
    "<S> the on - site interaction suppresses atomic fluctuations , while as light scattering gets optimized , the density is unable to lock in a homogeneous density pattern leading to additional density imbalance . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the phase modulation and density modulations coexist simultaneously while atoms retain mobility preventing the stabilization of an insulating phase . </S>",
    "<S> note , that multimode bond structures can have very nontrivial spatial overlap and dimers ( and their multimode generalizations as trimers , tetramers , etc . </S>",
    "<S> , which can be obtained for tilted pump angle ) extend over many sites demonstrating the interplay of global and short - range properties . </S>",
    "<S> dimer states can be used as fundamental units to engineer hamiltonians of quantum spin - liquid states  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath87 processes enter directly in the effective hamiltonian with couplings depending on the light geometry and pump amplitude , this makes feasible to achieve analogous physics relaxing the constraint on very low temperatures and large on - site interactions based on second order expansion effective hamiltonians  @xcite .     between dimers </S>",

    "<S> this occurs because the terms due to light - matter correlations in @xmath87 are not shadowed by semiclassical effects , as there is no classical light build up . </S>",
    "<S> two - point tunneling correlations introduce new terms in the bh model  @xcite , which couple densities at neighboring sites only : @xmath98 , producing a dw instability even without strong light . </S>",
    "<S> density imbalance is energetically favoured and the atoms condense in a nearest - neighbour density pattern , while additional terms in @xmath99 favor atomic quantum fluctuations competing with the on - site interaction . </S>",
    "<S> thus , short range processes induced by the quantumness of light induce the transition . </S>",
    "<S> such a direct density coupling corresponds stronger to the typical supersolidity scenario , which is under active search  @xcite .    in experiments with homogeneous becs both @xmath1 and the long - range interaction rate are of the same order ( either mhz  @xcite or khz  @xcite ) , while the depletion rate  @xcite of the ground state can be made smaller by choosing the detuning such that @xmath100 . in our lattice case , the effective light - matter coupling coefficient @xmath7 rescales as @xmath101 , and similarly to the homogeneous systems the evolution can be faster than depletion .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that quantum optical lattices offer a new tool to engineer nonlocal many - body interactions with light - induced structures . </S>",
    "<S> these interactions can break symmetries by design and imprint a pattern that governs the origin of many - body phases . </S>",
    "<S> this effectively bridges physics of long - range and short - range interactions . </S>",
    "<S> the light and matter are entangled , forming non - trivial light - matter correlated states . </S>",
    "<S> we suggested how to generate not only multimode density patterns , but nonlocal patterns of matter - filed coherences as well ( in particular , delocalized superfluid and supersolid dimers ) . </S>",
    "<S> some of the states appear solely due to quantum fluctuations of light and matter , where no classical light can build up . a pathway to realize our proposal is to combine several recent experimental breakthroughs : </S>",

    "<S> an optical lattice in a cavity became a reality  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> based on off - resonant scattering and thus being non - sensitive to a detailed atomic level structure , our approach can be extended to other arrays of natural or artificial quantum objects : spins , fermions , molecules ( including biological ones )  @xcite , ions  @xcite , atoms in multiple cavities  @xcite , semiconductor  @xcite or superconducting qubits  @xcite .    </S>",
