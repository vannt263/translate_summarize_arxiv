    "this breaking generates masses for all degrees of freedom , except those that correspond to @xmath6 unbroken @xmath18 gauge symmetries , which describe @xmath6 massless gauge bosons and their superpartners .",

    "it was stated in @xcite that there is a possibility for the condensation of monopoles or dyons , which results in explicit breaking of the @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theory down to @xmath44 gauge theory . in order to describe this transition it suffices to have only @xmath36 dyons for a given @xmath73 .",

    "we learned that the degeneracy of central charges of monopoles introduced in ( [ zsame ] ) results in a number of interesting consequences . to begin with ,",
    "the central charge of any monopole satisfies very simple condition ( [ zg ] ) .",

    "( [ zsame ] ) and ( [ zg ] ) are mimicked by eqs.([zprime ] ) , ( [ zgprime ] ) .",
    "this physical picture has a very clear and attractive geometrical interpretation .",
    "the degeneracy of central charges of monopoles ensures that the scalar field and its dual are simultaneously aligned along the weyl vector , as eqs .",
    "( [ adro ] ) , ( [ aro ] ) state .",
    "we can reverse the arguments , observing that from the derivation it is clear that whenever any _ one _ of the six mentioned conditions ( eqs .",
    "( [ zsame]),([zg ] ) , ( [ adro ] ) , ( [ aro ] ) , ( [ zprime ] ) , or ( [ zgprime ] ) ) holds , then the other five are automatically satisfied .",
    "in particular , when one of the two fields , @xmath7 or @xmath22 , is aligned along the weyl vector , then the other is also aligned along the same vector .",
    "this means that along this direction a one - dimensional description of the theory can be formulated .",
    "one can express @xmath357 from ( [ adro ] ) as a function of @xmath184 from ( [ aro ] ) .",
    "then the variation of @xmath184 results in the related variation of the fields @xmath7 and @xmath22 , which both remain aligned along the weyl vector .",
    "the presented derivation of these features of the theory was based on its general properties , did not rely on the perturbation theory , being therefore valid for arbitrary coupling .",

    "[ g = r ] we see that this goal would be achieved provided @xmath372 are @xmath253-independent .",

    "equation ( [ zjpmlambda ] ) implies that the expansion coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath223 for the scalar and dual fields in eqs.([aq ] ) and ( [ adq ] ) are independent on @xmath253 . as was mentioned , the independence of the expansion coefficients @xmath90 and @xmath223 on @xmath253 means that the fields @xmath7 and @xmath258 are both aligned along the weyl vector @xmath354 .",
    "moreover , eqs.([ajll ] ) and ( [ adjll ] ) express these fields as functions of a free parameter @xmath9 .",
    "this implies that a variation of @xmath9 results in variations of @xmath7 and @xmath258 under which both these fields remain aligned along @xmath354 .",
    "remember that this interesting feature was dubbed as the one - dimensional behaviour along the weyl vector in subsection [ general - approach ] , where its existence was derived from basic properties of the theory .",
    "the fact that the model reproduces this specific behaviour supports the validity of the model .",
    "moreover , an absolute value of the parameter @xmath9 is arbitrary , so by switching it from the region @xmath389 to @xmath390 one can probe the model at strong and weak coupling finding that it shows this particular behaviour at arbitrary coupling , which is precisely what we wanted to verify .",
    "generically , an arbitrary gauge group is governed by a large number of parameters . however , eqs.([yy ] )",
    "state that only two of them , the rank @xmath6 and the dual coxeter number @xmath36 of the group , are present in the differential @xmath92 .",
    "all other parameters of the gauge group appear in the theory only via the fundamental weights of the group , which define the expansion of the scalar fields in eqs.([aq]),([adq ] ) .",
    "the weights themselves include very detailed information about the group , but when the analytic structure of the solution is formulated then only the coefficients in these expansions are relevant .",
    "these coefficients are identified with the periods in eqs.([ai2]),([adi2 ] ) and depend entirely on the properties of the differential , which is governed by the two mentioned parameters , @xmath6 and @xmath36 .",
    "all other information related to the gauge group , including its cartan matrix , does not manifest itself explicitly in the differential .    remembering that the @xmath25-matrix of the coupling constants is expressed via the expansion coefficients from eqs.([aq]),([adq ] )",
    "we conclude that the rank and the dual coxeter number are the only parameters specified by the gauge group , which define the analytic structure of the model and its coupling constants .",
    "recall that the groups su(@xmath1 ) and sp(@xmath2 ) have the same rank @xmath6 and same dual coxeter number @xmath391 , see table [ t1 ] in section [ differential ] .",
    "consequently , relations between the coefficients @xmath223 and @xmath392 in these two theories are expressed by the same functions , and the @xmath25-matrices , which represent the coupling constants in these two theories , are equal @xmath393 this equality may look surprising since the considered groups have very different nature , one is simply laced and the other is not , but the only fact that matters here is that @xmath6 and @xmath36 for them are the same .",
    "the equality in ( [ tt ] ) is valid provided the arguments in both @xmath25-matrices there are identical , @xmath394 , remember that @xmath90 are the expansion coefficients for the scalar field @xmath7 in eq.([aq ] ) .",
    "however , the equality of these coefficients does not mean the equality of the corresponding fields .",
    "on the contrary , since the fundamental weights of the gauge algebras in these two theories are different , the scalar fields derived from eq .",
    "( [ aq ] ) necessarily differ , @xmath395 .",
    "thus , repeating , eq.([tt ] ) is written for one and the same set of expansion coefficients @xmath90 in eq.([aq ] ) , which specifies different scalar fields for the two theories considered .",
    "the proposed model describes the low - energy properties of the @xmath0 supersymmetric gauge theory for compact simple gauge groups .",
    "it is written in a universal form which is applicable to any gauge group , simply laced or not , classical or exceptional .",
    "the basis of fundamental weights , which is used in the model for the scalar fields in the cartan algebra , provides a convenient way to reproduce the known electric and magnetic charges of dyons @xcite .",
    "it is verified that the model correctly describes the region of weak coupling .",
    "remembering that all the relevant functions in the theory are holomorphic , one can argue that since the model reproduces the boundary conditions for these functions ( which are related to dyon charges at strong coupling and perturbation theory at weak coupling ) it is reliable .",
    "the model has a transparent structure .",
    "it is presented on the riemann surface , which has the lowest possible genus that equals the rank of the gauge group .",
    "the functional form of the differential , which is defined on this surface , is governed by only two parameters related to the gauge group , its rank @xmath6 and dual coxeter number @xmath36 .",
    "one could have anticipated that other parameters , which describe the gauge group , for example its cartan matrix , may appear in the differential , but they do not , which greatly simplifies the problem .",
    "a number of supplementary verifications to validate the model are fulfilled .",
    "it is verified that the seiberg - witten solution for the su(2 ) gauge theory is reproduced .",
    "the weak coupling region is considered for two situations .",
    "one of them arises when the scalar field is well inside the weyl chamber .",
    "the validity of the model in this case is verified straightforwardly .",
    "a more sophisticated situation takes place in the vicinity of a wall of the weyl chamber . here",
    "the monodromy is found , which relates the strong and weak coupling regimes and can be presented in a form identical to the monodromy , which exists in the seiberg - witten solution for the the su(2 ) gauge symmetry .",
    "the match between these two monodromies supports validity of the model .",
    "the model is also shown to incorporate the important discrete transformations , namely the chiral symmetry and duality condition .",
    "an additional verification of the model is based on the new interesting property of the theory .",
    "it is shown that when the vector @xmath7 , which represents the scalar field in the cartan algebra , is aligned along the weyl vector @xmath354 , then the vector of the dual field @xmath258 is necessarily aligned along the same direction ( the opposite statement is also valid , when @xmath258 is aligned along @xmath354 , then @xmath7 is aligned along the same direction ) .",
    "it is also shown that the alignment of @xmath7 and @xmath258 along @xmath354 is accompanied by a profound simplification of the monopole and dyon spectra .",
    "in particular , the masses of _ all _ monopoles in this case are described by only _",
    "one _ constant .",
    "these aspects of the theory are derived from its basic properties and remain valid for any coupling , weak or strong .",
    "the fulfilled verification shows that the model reproduces these interesting features .",
    "the mentioned verifications support the validity of the model . nevertheless , since cross verifications never hurt it would be desirable to compare the present model with previous solutions .",
    "however , there is a sizable obstacle , which needs to be overtaken . in the present work the scalar fields in the cartan algebra",
    "are presented in the basis of fundamental weights . as mentioned",
    ", this approach provides a convenient account of the known electric and magnetic charges of light dyons .",
    "solutions considered previously have all been written using different starting points , taking the basis of simple roots or the orthonormal basis , which makes description of the dyon charges more complex , see discussion and comparison in @xcite .",
    "thus , before matching the present model with previous solutions this complication needs to be resolved .    the model is applied to show that the @xmath25-matrix of coupling constants for the theory based on su(@xmath1 ) gauge group is identical to the @xmath25-matrix for the theory with sp(@xmath2 ) gauge group .",
    "this unexpected property of the theory stems from the fact that the pairs of parameters @xmath6 , @xmath36 in su(@xmath1 ) and sp(@xmath2 ) groups are identical .",
    "consequently , the relevant differentials for these groups prove to be identical as well .",
    "hopefully , a clear and general nature of the model would make it useful for other applications .",
