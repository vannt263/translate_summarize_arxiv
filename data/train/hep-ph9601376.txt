    "the phenomenon of spontaneous symmetry breaking has become a cornerstone of modern particle physics . to be able to establish a connection between particle physics and cosmology , it is essential to investigate the behavior of symmetry breaking in the early universe , _ i.e. _ at high temperature . in spite of common sense prejudice ,",
    "it is by now known that more heat does not necessarily imply more symmetry @xcite .",
    "rather , the question of symmetry restoration is quite a complex phenomenon and depends on the dynamics of the theory considered .",
    "examples have been found with symmetries remaining broken at arbitrarily high temperature , or even exact symmetries becoming broken as the system gets heated up @xcite .",
    "however , some of these examples were artificially created just in order to demonstrate the phenomenon . in our opinion ,",
    "symmetry nonrestoration becomes relevant only when resulting from minimal and realistic models .",
    "this is precisely what we wish to address in this paper . for the sake of focus , we concentrate on the issues of p and cp violation ( both weak and strong ) .",
    "the choice of parity and time reversal is in our opinion natural , these being fundamental symmetries of nature .",
    "furthermore , the spontaneous breaking of these symmetries may offer a simple way out of the strong cp problem @xcite .",
    "there are at least two important reasons to have cp broken at high temperature .",
    "baryogenesis requires cp violation , and if one is to adhere to the appealing idea of cp symmetry being broken spontaneously , its nonrestoration becomes a must . on the other hand",
    ", the spontaneous breakdown of a discrete symmetry leads to a domain wall problem , following the phase transition that takes place if the symmetry is restored at high t @xcite .",
    "avoiding this phase transition may be sufficient to solve the problem , since the thermal production of large domain walls is naturally suppressed for a wide range of the parameters of the theory @xcite . in section [ weakcp ] ,",
    "we study cp behavior at high temperature in some @xmath0 theories with higgs doublets and singlets only .",
    "it turns out that in minimal such models with doublets only cp is always restored , whereas it can naturally remain broken if there is at least one singlet on top of the usual higgs doublet .",
    "section [ p ] is devoted to p violation and there we find that nonrestoration of p at high t seems to be in conflict with perturbation theory .",
    "again , the existence of p odd singlets , welcome for the implementation of the minimal see - saw mechanism , works in favor of nonrestoration of p just as in the case of cp .",
    "there is yet another class of theories plagued by the domain wall problem , that is , those based on the peccei - quinn solution @xcite to the strong cp problem .",
    "once again , symmetry nonrestoration can solve the problem @xcite . in section [ strongcp ]",
    "we demonstrate in detail how this is achieved .",
    "it has been pointed out that next - to - leading order corrections to the high temperature effective potential may play an important role on the question of nonrestoration , even to the extent of invalidating it in the case of local gauge symmetries @xcite .",
    "however , a recent study @xcite involving a wilson renormalization group approach which simulates nonperturbative effects , seems to encourage the validity of the conventional one loop results . since the issue is not completely settled , to be on the safe side we show in section [ ntl ] how inclusion of next - to - leading order terms does not affect any of our conclusions .",
    "focusing on cp forced us to ignore some rather important applications of the idea of symmetry nonrestoration , in particular a possible solution to the monopole problem in grand unified theories @xcite .",
    "we leave this and related issues for the future .",
    "as with any discrete symmetry , we would like to be able to keep cp broken at high temperature in order to avoid the formation of the dangerous domain walls . in the case of cp",
    ", there is yet an additional reason not to restore it in the early universe , at least not until the time of baryogenesis .",
    "simply , cp must be broken in order for matter to be created @xcite .",
    "this was actually the original motivation of the first application in particle physics of the phenomenon of nonrestoration of symmetries at high temperature @xcite .",
    "the model presented in @xcite however does not satisfy the minimality condition introduced above , since there the higgs sector is extended to three doublets only in order to have high t symmetry nonrestoration .",
    "the simplest and original example of a theory with spontaneous cp violation was presented by t.d .",
    "lee @xcite .",
    "his model is an extension of the standard model with two complex higgs doublets , with    @xmath2    where    @xmath3   \\label{tdlpot}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    choosing the parameter @xmath4 , one can prove that the minimum of the potential is achieved when the fields acquire vevs    @xmath5    the terms in brackets in the potential will force the cp - violating phase @xmath6 to be non - zero .",
    "this can be readily seen by writing ( [ tdlpot ] ) at the minimum ( [ tdlvev ] ) , and wisely rearranging terms :    @xmath7 ^ 2   \\label{tdlmin}\\ ] ]    where    @xmath8    obviously , for @xmath9 the minimum will be at @xmath10 , and cp is broken spontaneously .",
    "we are interested in the possibility that cp remains broken at arbitrarily high temperature . for this to happen in t.d .",
    "lee s model , we need not only to have the vev s of _ both _ @xmath11 and @xmath12 nonzero at high t , but also to keep the cp - violating phase from vanishing .",
    "to get an idea of how both vev s may be kept different from zero , consider a simple model with two real scalar fields ( @xmath13 ) , and a potential with a @xmath14 symmetry @xmath15 , @xmath16    @xmath17    one can always choose @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and require    @xmath20    so that the potential is bounded from below .",
    "the potential has extrema at @xmath21 , @xmath22 satisfying    [ toymin ] @xmath23 v_1 +   \\beta_2 v_2 ^ 3 = 0\\ ] ] @xmath24 v_2 +   \\beta_1 v_1 ^ 3 = 0\\ ] ]    with negative mass terms , both vevs are nonzero . admittedly , this model does not belong to the class of minimal models as defined in this paper , since one can break the @xmath14 symmetry with just one vev ; however , we include it in order to illustrate the role of the linear terms in symmetry nonrestoration .    at high temperature ,",
    "the effective potential acquires the additional terms @xcite    @xmath25\\ ] ]    by asking , e.g. @xmath26 , one can keep one of the mass terms negative at any temperature , while ( [ bound ] ) forces the other to be positive .",
    "however , the cubic terms in ( [ toymin ] ) guarantee that only one negative mass term suffices to have _ both _ vevs non zero at high t. in other words , the field with the negative mass term acquires a vev and `` forces '' the other to get one also , via the linear terms in the potential .",
    "the reader must have noticed that we can redefine the fields at high t so that just one of them has a nonvanishing vev .",
    "however , she should keep in mind that the same holds true at @xmath27 ; the point is that the symmetry breaking patterns at high and low t are equal .",
    "one can hope that the potential in t.d .",
    "lee s model , being of a similar form as ( [ toy ] ) , will exhibit a similar behavior , allowing both vev s to remain non zero at high temperature .",
    "unfortunately , it is readily found out that it does so at the expense of having the phase @xmath6 going to zero , thus restoring cp , as we now show .",
    "the high temperature corrections to the effective potential for a model with n higgs doublets can be found by generalizing weinberg s formula @xcite for complex doublets .",
    "write the most general potential for n complex doublets as ]    @xmath28    then the high t correction is    @xmath29    for the two doublet model ( [ tdlpot ] ) , this gives    @xmath30\\ ] ]    the potential at high t can then be cast in the same form ( [ tdlmin ] ) , where now the masses @xmath31 are replaced by @xmath32    @xmath33    for @xmath34 ; and @xmath35 becomes @xmath36 :    @xmath37\\ ] ]    again , as in the simpler model , one can have one and only one mass negative at high t , due to the condition analogous to ( [ bound ] ) , i.e.    @xmath38    since now @xmath39    requiring @xmath40 will give @xmath41 , which contradicts ( [ tbound ] ) .    considering only the @xmath6-dependent part ,",
    "we see as before that there is a minimum for @xmath42 . however , it is not difficult to see that with only one mass term negative , both vevs can not be nonzero at high t , due to the fact that the mass terms now depend on the coupling constants . taking @xmath43 ,",
    "the requirement that @xmath44 be real gives    @xmath45    together with ( [ tbound ] ) , this is also enough to ensure that @xmath46 is real .",
    "substituting for @xmath47 and @xmath48 one gets    @xmath49    which again implies @xmath50 , contradicting ( [ tbound ] ) .",
    "we conclude then that the only way to have both fields with a nonvanishing vev at high temperature is to set the phase @xmath6 to zero . in other words , the field with a negative mass term can `` force '' the other to acquire a vev , but it drags it in the same direction in @xmath51 space",
    ".    notice that in @xcite the fact that both vevs can be nonzero was overlooked , but it was still concluded correctly that with two doublets only , cp would become a good symmetry at high t.      a common feature of models with two higgs doublets as the one in the previous section is that they allow for flavor - violating interactions in neutral current phenomena . as shown in @xcite , the minimal model for spontaneous cp violation involving doublets only that conserves flavor , requires three of them .    to see why ,",
    "consider a lagrangian with two complex higgs as in([tdlag ] ) , ( [ tdlpot ] ) , and an extra symmetry @xmath52 @xmath53    ( where @xmath54 are up quarks and hereafter @xmath55 are flavor indices ) .",
    "the yukawa interactions are written now    @xmath56    so that flavor violation through neutral higgs exchange is avoided .",
    "however , now the symmetry prohibits the terms of the type @xmath57 in the higgs potential , and therefore at the minimum we have the phase @xmath58 or @xmath59 , both leading to cp conservation .",
    "the way out is to have three doublets , and an additional symmetry @xmath60 that prevents it from coupling to the quarks : @xmath61 , with other fields unchanged .",

    "extremization with respect to @xmath6 yields @xcite    [ nfcmin ] @xmath69 @xmath70 [ nfcphase ]    notice that to have cp violation , we need all three @xmath71 and both @xmath72 to be nonzero .",
    "it can be shown @xcite that the cp violating solution of ( [ nfcmin ] ) is indeed a minimum .",
    "when the phases take this value , the remaining potential is    @xmath73    where    @xmath74    and analogous expressions for @xmath75 .",
    "once again , we are interested in whether the cp symmetry can remain broken at high temperatures .",
    "it is straightforward using ( [ tdmass ] ) to calculate the masses at high temperature    @xmath76 \\simeq { t^2 \\over 3 } \\nu_i^2 \\label{nfcmass}\\ ] ]    due to the high degree of symmetry of the potential , temperature contributions are independent of the phases , so equations ( [ nfcmin ] ) are the same .    for the potential to be bounded from below , a set of constraints analogous to ( [ bound ] ) has to be imposed on the couplings , namely    [ nfcbound ] @xmath77 @xmath78    with @xmath79 , and we choose @xmath80 , so @xmath81 .",
    "it is easy to prove that ( [ sdet ] ) prevents us from taking all three of the mass terms negative at high t , as we could have expected .",
    "necessary conditions would be    @xmath82    multiplying these equations by pairs and adding them results in a contradiction with eq .",
    "( [ sdet ] ) .",
    "but it turns out that with only two negative mass terms , all three vevs can not be nonzero at arbitrarily high temperature .",
    "take for example @xmath83 , @xmath84 .",
    "we need @xmath85 to be real , that is , minimizing ( [ nfcrem ] )    @xmath86    we have already required the denominator to be positive . for the numerator to be positive also , necessary ( though not sufficient ) conditions are    @xmath87    where @xmath88    inserting ( [ nfcn1 ] ) in ( [ nfcn2 ] ) , one gets    @xmath89    which in view of ( [ nfcbound ] ) can not be satisfied .",
    "thus , once again , the cp violating phase disappears at high temperature . as in the two - doublet case , here too the problem is that cp violation is achieved through the relative phase of the vevs of the doublets .",
    "it should be clear from the previous examples that when the cp phase is related to the relative phases of doublet fields , high temperature effects will make it vanish .",
    "we therefore look for models in which cp violation is broken spontaneously by the vev of just one field , which may be easier to keep at high temperature .",
    "the simplest such model is a minimal extension of the standard model with    a ) : :    a real singlet field s which transforms under cp as    @xmath90 .",
    "b ) : :    an additional down quark , with both left and right components    @xmath91 and @xmath92 singlets under    @xmath93 .",
    "the interaction lagrangian for the down quarks , symmetric under cp , contains the terms    @xmath94    clearly , when @xmath95 gets a vev ( at a scale @xmath96 much bigger than the weak scale @xmath97 ) cp is spontaneously broken by the terms in the last line . a model of this kind",
    "was developed by bento and branco @xcite , in the version where the singlet is a complex field and gets a complex vev , and with an additional symmetry under which @xmath95 and @xmath98 are odd , all other fields even .",
    "we will for simplicity keep @xmath95 real ( and impose no further symmetries ) , noting that the analysis goes over the same lines as in @xcite , and referring the reader there for details .",
    "suffice it to say that cp violation is achieved by complex phases appearing in the ckm matrix through the mixings of @xmath99 and @xmath100 quarks , which are of the order @xmath101 .",
    "these phases remain in the limit @xmath102 when the heavy quarks decouple .",
    "this should not come as a surprise , since in the decoupling limit the theory reduces to the minimal standard model , which in general has complex yukawa couplings and a complex ckm matrix .",
    "also , flavor - violating currents are suppressed by powers of @xmath103 , disappearing in the decoupling limit .",
    "thus the measure of the departure from the standard model is the dimensionless parameter @xmath104 , and for the theory to be experimentally testable @xmath105 should not be much bigger than 1 tev .    to leading order ,",
    "the high - temperature behavior of the @xmath106 system is very simple .",
    "the most general potential can be written as    @xmath107    and it has a minimum at    @xmath108    at high t , the masses are replaced by    @xmath109    we can have @xmath110 always by requiring @xmath111 , and thus @xmath112 at any temperature .",
    "the only further restriction is the usual @xmath113 .",
    "it seems then that in this model , one can have cp broken at any temperature .",
    "remember however that up to now we have only considered the leading order contributions to the effective potential in calculating the masses ( [ sinmass ] ) .",
    "a complete analysis should include the next - to leading order corrections , as we already mentioned in the introduction .",
    "we can anticipate that for a singlet field these effects will not change the picture much , but we leave a detailed analysis for a separate section .",
    "spontaneous @xmath114 violation has been already discussed in the second paper of ref .",
    "@xcite , mostly in connection with strong cp violation .",
    "it was concluded there that in the minimal models of spontaneous p violation , left - right asymmetry may persist to high temperatures .",
    "the analysis however was carried out without considering carefully the role of the gauge couplings , which is now known to be fundamental @xcite , and which as we will show may invalidate that conclusion .",
    "let us recall the salient features of the minimal left - right symmetric theories @xcite based on a @xmath115 gauge symmetry .",
    "the fermions are in doublet representations    @xmath116    the minimal higgs sector of the theory consists of    * the bi - doublets ( one or more ) @xmath117 needed to provide yukawa couplings and fermion masses * two multiplets @xmath118 and @xmath119 which may be either doublets or triplets under @xmath120 and @xmath121 , and which are in charge of breaking p spontaneously .    for the sake of completeness ,",
    "we remind the reader of the essence of spontaneous p violation and we do it in a simplified toy example which has all the relevant features of the theory .",
    "more precisely , we take @xmath118 and @xmath119 as real scalar fields and assume a left - right symmetric potential    @xmath122    a simple inspection of v is enough to convince oneself that for @xmath123 and @xmath124 , the global minimum of the theory is obtained for    @xmath125    or viceversa .",
    "thus the left - right symmetry is broken spontaneously .",
    "of course in realistic models , besides @xmath126 s being non - trivial representations under the gauge group , we do need a field @xmath117 .",
    "one can then try to take one or more of the coupling constants between @xmath117 and the @xmath126 s negative , thus achieving a negative mass term for the @xmath126 s at all temperatures .",
    "let us concentrate in the version of the theory which incorporates the see - saw mechanism with @xmath118 and @xmath119 being triplets @xcite . since we wish to keep @xmath127 nonzero at high temperature ,",
    "it is enough to look at the @xmath128 system and , as in @xcite , consider a simplified model in which the potential is written    @xmath129    where @xmath119 is a triplet under @xmath121 , has @xmath130 number 2 , and other couplings are taken to be small .",
    "the high temperature masses are ; @xmath131 , where @xmath132 sums over six real fields . ]",
    "@xmath133 @xmath134    where @xmath135 is the @xmath51 gauge coupling , @xmath136 the @xmath121 one . we have to keep @xmath137 negative at high t while preserving the boundedness condition @xmath138 , thus we arrive at    @xmath139\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath140 as a function of @xmath141 has a minimum at @xmath142 , so we must have    @xmath143    if we now use @xmath144 and take @xmath145 , we see that nonrestoration of p requires @xmath146 in conflict with perturbation theory .",
    "including other couplings does not help , since new conditions on the couplings coming from the mass matrices have to be imposed ( since it is not illustrative , we omit here the numerical analysis required to prove this ) .",
    "although physically less attractive , one can in principle use doublets to break p spontaneously .",
    "this is actually the case studied in @xcite .",
    "it is easily found that with doublets the condition equivalent to ( [ pcond ] ) is down by a factor of half .",
    "thus this case may be considered borderline .",
    "now , for the implementation of the see - saw mechanism in its minimal form , it turns out that a parity odd singlet field is needed @xcite . the singlet field",
    "@xmath95 will couple to the @xmath126 fields with a left - right symmetric term    @xmath147    without the lower bound imposed by the gauge couplings , the situation in this case goes along the same lines as that of section [ sin ] : the vev of the singlet can be kept nonzero at high temperatures with the aid of the bi - doublet field @xmath117 , or even of the @xmath126 s .",
    "exactly as it worked with cp , now p may remain broken at high temperature , and the presence of more fields coupled to @xmath95 than in the cp case only makes it easier .",
    "the strong cp problem arises in qcd when nonperturbative effects , resulting from the existence of instanton solutions , induce effective terms in the lagrangian that violate cp .",
    "the resulting cp violating phase is    @xmath148    where @xmath149 is the coefficient of the @xmath150 term , and @xmath151 is the quark s mass matrix .",
    "@xmath152 is constrained experimentally to be zero to a very high precision ( @xmath153 ) , giving rise to a `` naturalness '' problem @xcite .",
    "the most popular solution to the strong cp problem is the peccei - quinn mechanism @xcite , in which the phase @xmath152 is identified with the pseudo - goldstone boson resulting from the spontaneous breakdown of a global symmetry @xmath154 .",
    "observational constraints require this breakdown to occur at a scale @xmath155 much bigger than the electroweak scale , making the axion `` invisible '' @xcite .",
    "besides the axion field @xmath132 , the breaking of @xmath154 produces a network of global strings @xcite .",
    "as we go around each minimal string , the phase @xmath156 winds by @xmath157 .",
    "instanton effects appear later , when the temperature has reached the qcd scale @xmath158 .",
    "their effects in the higgs sector can be mimicked by an effective term    @xmath159    where @xmath160 is the number of quark flavors .",
    "it becomes energetically favorable for @xmath161 to choose one out of the discrete set of values @xmath162 ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "but since we must have @xmath164 around a string , this results in the formation of @xmath160 domain walls attached to each string @xcite . for @xmath165 , these domain walls are stable and therefore in conflict with standard cosmology .",
    "clearly , without the global strings no walls will be formed : above @xmath166 , @xmath152 would be aligned having some typical value @xmath167 which after the qcd phase transition would relax to the nearest minimum .",
    "we wish then to study in detail the high temperature behavior of the invisible axion mechanism , well above the scale @xmath155 .",
    "for concreteness we concentrate on the minimal extension of the original peccei - quinn model @xcite .",
    "the potential for the pq model with the doublets @xmath168 ( i=1,2 ) both having @xmath169 and a @xmath170 singlet @xmath95 may be written as    @xmath171 }   -   { \\alpha \\over 2}(\\phi_1^\\dagger \\phi_1)(\\phi_2^\\dagger \\phi_2)-   { \\beta \\over 2}(\\phi_1^\\dagger \\phi_2)(\\phi_2^\\dagger \\phi_1 ) \\nonumber \\\\ & - & { m_s^2 \\over 2 } s^ * s + { \\lambda_s \\over 4 } ( s^ * s)^2   - \\sum_i{({\\gamma_i \\over 2 } \\phi_i^\\dagger \\phi_i } ) s^ * s   - m ( \\phi_1^\\dagger \\phi_2 s + \\phi_2^\\dagger \\phi_1 s^ * )   \\label{pqpot }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    besides the @xmath172 local gauge symmetry , @xmath173 has a chiral @xmath154 symmetry ( @xmath174 couples to say down quarks , and @xmath175 to up quarks )    @xmath176    for @xmath4 , the minimum is found at    @xmath177    to have @xmath154 broken at any temperature , it is enough to keep the vev of the singlet nonzero for all t. from our analysis of the previous section for a potential with three doublets , one can already expect that keeping the vev of only one field nonzero will not be difficult . in this model then the conditions on the potential parameters can not be an obstacle for nonrestoration , but we present them here for the sake of completeness . taking @xmath178 , the conditions over the couplings are , to leading order    [ pqcond ] @xmath179 @xmath180 \\nonumber \\\\ & + & v_s^2 v_1 ^ 2 v_2 ^ 2 \\left[\\lambda_1\\lambda_2\\lambda_s -   \\lambda_1\\gamma_2 ^ 2 - \\lambda_2\\gamma_1 ^ 2   -\\lambda_s ( \\alpha+\\beta)^2 - 2 \\gamma_1\\gamma_2(\\alpha+\\beta)\\right ] > 0 \\label{pqcond2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is easily proven that ( [ pqcond1 ] ) imply that the first line of eq .",
    "( [ pqcond2 ] ) is positive .",
    "a sufficient condition for boundedness will then require ( [ pqcond1 ] ) and the second line of ( [ pqcond2 ] ) to be positive , the same conditions that were required in the three - doublet model of section [ nfc ] ( eq.([nfcbound ] ) ) .    the mass term of the singlet at high temperature will be    @xmath181    so that imposing @xmath182 , we get the @xmath154 symmetry broken at all temperatures .",
    "we already know that at high t one can not have all three vevs nonzero , and notice that because of the linear terms in ( [ pqpot ] ) , having @xmath183 forces @xmath184 to vanish .",
    "up to this order then , it seems quite natural to keep the vev of @xmath95 nonzero at high t ; again we leave the next - to - leading order considerations for the next session .",
    "the learned reader will notice that the same holds true for kim s version @xcite of the invisible axion idea .",
    "another well - known solution to the strong cp problem is based on the idea of spontaneous cp or p violation @xcite . here",
    ", the symmetries can be used to set @xmath185 and the effective @xmath152 is then finite and calculable in perturbation theory , and in many models small enough .",
    "the high t behavior of these theories is completely analogous to the one discussed in section [ weakcp ] and [ p ] , and thus we can conclude that the solution of the domain wall problem favors models with singlets .",
    "however , before _ the _ model is found we find it fruitless to study this question in detail .",
    "in a series of recent papers , bimonte and lozano @xcite have addressed the issue of next - to - leading order contributions to the effective potential . as was already pointed out in @xcite , in a theory with a @xmath186 potential ,",
    "the next - to - leading order contributions to the mass@xmath187 are of order    @xmath188    while higher loop corrections do not contribute significantly .",
    "the point is that in a theory with two fields where one of the self - coupling constants is required to be larger than the other ( as we did to avoid symmetry restoration ) , the larger constant will enter in corrections to the other field s mass .",
    "thus one has to make sure that the results to leading order are maintained when including such terms .",
    "in fact , in the case of gauge symmetries , it was concluded @xcite that the inclusion of these effects can alter significantly the phase diagram of the theory .",
    "this is mainly due to the fact that in the gauge case the coupling constants can not be as small as one wishes , but are bounded from below by the value of the gauge coupling . in the case of singlets @xcite , although the effects are not so dramatic , they do alter the parameter space for symmetry nonrestoration .",
    "since in this investigation the models that allow for nonrestoration at high t were based on singlet fields , we will only consider here the next - to - leading order corrections in the case of global symmetry .",
    "we begin by reviewing briefly the contributions of next - to - leading corrections in the effective potential of a @xmath189-symmetric model , although we refer the reader to @xcite for details .",
    "take two real fields @xmath13 , transforming as vectors under @xmath190 respectively , and write the potential    @xmath191    the temperature contributions to the effective masses are calculated to leading order to be    @xmath192\\ ] ]    ( and a similar expression for @xmath193 ) while to next - to - leading , @xmath194 is found by solving the coupled pair of equations    @xmath195    symmetry is restored when such solutions are real and positive .",
    "the conditions under which those solutions do not exist , and therefore the @xmath196 symmetry is _ not _ restored can be found to be    [ ntlcond ] @xmath197 > \\lambda_2 \\label{ntlcond1}\\ ] ] @xmath198    where    @xmath199    is a function that can take values from @xmath200 to @xmath201 .",
    "the leading order conditions are ( [ ntlcond ] ) with @xmath202 .",
    "one can see then why the parameter space is reduced : it gets more difficult to fulfill ( [ ntlcond1 ] ) .",
    "the behavior with the number of fields also becomes nontrivial , since @xmath203 is a decreasing function of @xmath204 , and the two factors of @xmath205 in ( [ ntlcond1 ] ) compete ( up to leading order , it is always preferable to keep nonzero the vev of the field in the smallest representation ) .",
    "the @xmath189 toy model can mimick models with more complicated symmetries involving two fields with @xmath204 and @xmath206 real components , in the approximation where their interaction is just of the type @xmath207 we show how symmetry nonrestoration depends in the number of fields when the next - to - leading order effects are included , i.e. , we find the values of @xmath204 and @xmath206 for which the conditions ( [ ntlcond ] ) are satisfied when the parameters of the potential are fixed .",
    "the plot shows the situation for two sets of ratios of the couplings : @xmath208 and @xmath209 .",
    "notice that @xmath210 is still preferred .",
    "as the ratio @xmath211 increases , it becomes necessary for nonrestoration to take smaller ratio @xmath212 .",
    "the cases of @xmath213 ( a complex doublet plus a real singlet , as required for cp violation in section [ sin ] ) , that of @xmath214 ( two doublets and one complex singlet , as in the invisible axion model of section [ strongcp ] ) and that of @xmath215 ( two doublets and a singlet , as in the parity - violating model of section [ p ] ) lie in the non - restoration region .",
    "the relevant question is how big is the region in parameter space where nonrestoration occurs . in figure [ bb ]",
    "we show that region for the case of the cp violation with a real singlet , in @xmath216 space , when @xmath217 is kept at a fixed value .",
    "varying @xmath217 basically ` rescales ' the whole picture in the @xmath205 axis .",
    "the corresponding region with only leading - order effects is also shown .",
    "although the parameter space is reduced by higher order corrections , the difference with the leading order case is not dramatic .    for the peccei - quinn model ,",
    "the next - to - leading order calculations are only approximated by an @xmath218 model , in the limit where in ( [ pqpot ] ) , @xmath219 , @xmath220 , and @xmath221 .    under such approximation , the region where nonrestoration is allowed",
    "is presented in figure [ pq ] , for the same range of parameters as in figure 2 .",
    "it is evident comparing both figures that nonrestoration does not depend only on the ratio @xmath222 .    as for the model of @xmath114 violation with a singlet of section [ p ] , it can be imitated by a @xmath223 model if the quartic coupling with the two doublet fields is taken negative .",
    "one can also choose the couplings with the bi - doublet negative , and then consider an approximated model with some of the self and mixed couplings small .",
    "the nonrestoration region is clearly bigger than in the weak or strong @xmath224 cases .",
    "in this paper we have studied the phenomenon of symmetry nonrestoration at high temperature , focusing on some minimal models of spontaneous t and p violation .",
    "we were motivated by the fundamental role that these symmetries play in nature and by the possibility of using them in solving the strong cp problem .",
    "we find that symmetry nonrestoration seems to require singlet fields and that it seems to work in accord with perturbation theory .",
    "this provides the hope for solving the domain wall problem and having baryogenesis operate at very high temperature as we now discuss briefly .    :",
    "avoiding the phase transition is not enough to solve the domain wall problem , since thermal fluctuations are in principle able to produce topological defects at any time . as was shown in @xcite , thermal production of domain walls and strings can be naturally suppressed .",
    "we briefly sketch how this suppression occurs for the two models admitting nonrestoration presented here , and refer to @xcite for details .        where @xmath227 is the energy of the closed defect .",
    "the suppression factor @xmath228 is readily calculated in the limit where the defect s radius is much bigger than its width . for the domain walls produced in the model of cp violation with a singlet , we get            the considered models with singlets involve a high scale @xmath231 much bigger than the weak scale @xmath97 , and it is noteworthy that the smallness of @xmath217 is intimately related to this hierarchy . strictly speaking one",
    "could just fine tune the combination of @xmath232 and @xmath233 to be small , but this is not stable under radiative corrections .",
    "it is maybe more natural to take all the mass parameters of the model @xmath234 and @xmath235 to be small , i.e. of order @xmath97 , and the singlet s self and mixed couplings of order @xmath236 . in such case",
    "it is obvious that both ( [ sup1 ] ) and ( [ sup2 ] ) become enormous , suppressing completely the production of defects .",
    "of course , the nature of the fine - tuning is finally a matter of taste .",
    "however , the second possibility has the clear prediction of keeping both higgs doublets light in the invisible axion model , as is commonly assumed and experimentally verifiable .    of course , all the above still",
    "does not guarantee the absence of domain walls .",
    "one needs to assume initial conditions in which the singlet field has a uniform value over a region of roughly the comoving size of the present horizon .",
    "this is equivalent to assume that the so - called horizon problem has been solved , for example by means of a period of primordial inflation .",
    "the issue of baryogenesis in the context of broken symmetries at high t has been discused in @xcite with emphasis on the theories where the @xmath0 gauge symmetry of the standard model never gets restored .",
    "this implies massive fermions at high t , but it can still be shown that baryogenesis may take place along the usual lines of the out - of - equilibrium decays of superheavy lepto - quark gauge and higgs bosons .",
    "now , in the examples we have discussed both with p and cp violation at high t , and including the peccei - quinn mechanism , the @xmath0 symmetry gets restored as in the more conventional scenarios .",
    "thus fermions become massless and the creation of baryon asymmetry proceeds as usual .",
    "of course , this implies embedding of the models discussed into guts , a task beyond the scope of our paper .",
