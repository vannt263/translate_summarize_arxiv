    "one of the most important experimental goals of future hadron supercolliders such as the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) is to unravel the mystery of electroweak symmetry breaking , to produce and to detect the higgs bosons or to prove their non - existence . in the standard model ( sm ) of electroweak interactions ,",
    "only one higgs doublet is required to generate masses for fermions as well as gauge bosons .",
    "one neutral cp - even higgs boson ( @xmath0 ) appears after spontaneous symmetry breaking .",
    "various extensions of the sm have more complicated higgs sectors and lead to additional physical spin zero fields @xcite .",
    "the minimal supersymmetric extension of the standard model ( mssm ) @xcite has two higgs doublets with vacuum expectation values @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "after spontaneous symmetry breaking , there remain five physical higgs bosons : a pair of singly charged higgs bosons @xmath3 , two neutral cp - even scalars @xmath4 ( heavier ) and @xmath5 ( lighter ) , and a neutral cp - odd pseudoscalar @xmath6 . the higgs sector is strongly constrained by supersymmetry so that at the tree level , all higgs boson masses and couplings are determined by just two independent parameters , which are commonly chosen to be the mass of the cp - odd pseudoscalar ( @xmath7 ) and @xmath8 .",
    "since the top quark is very heavy @xcite , radiative corrections from large @xmath9-quark yukawa couplings substantially modify the tree level formulae for masses and mixing patterns in the higgs sector .",
    "several groups have reevaluated prospects for the detection of mssm higgs bosons at future hadron colliders .",
    "most studies have focused on various sm decay modes for the neutral higgs bosons , @xmath10 and @xmath11 or @xmath12 ( @xmath13 and @xmath6 ) ; as well as for the charged higgs boson @xcite , that are detectable above background .",
    "parameters were selected such that supersymmetric particle ( susy particle ) masses were large so that higgs boson decays to susy particles were kinematically forbidden @xcite-@xcite .",
    "a region of parameter space roughly spanning pseudoscalar higgs mass @xmath14 gev and ratio of higgs vev s @xmath15 where none of the sm decay modes were detectable . for large @xmath16 , the @xmath17 decay mode",
    "@xcite has been suggested to be a promising discovery channel .",
    "recently , it has been argued that neutral higgs bosons might be observable via their @xmath18 decays @xcite in a large region of the ( @xmath19 ) plane , provided that sufficient @xmath20-tagging capability can be achieved .",
    "signals for invisible decays of higgs bosons have also been considered @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in addition , there are regions of parameter space where rates for higgs boson decays to susy particles are large and dominant .",
    "while these decays reduce the rates for sm signatures , making conventional detection of higgs bosons even more difficult , they also open up a number of new promising modes for higgs detection @xcite .    in this paper ,",
    "the prospects of discovering the neutral higgs bosons in the mssm via their decays into muon pairs at the lhc are investigated .",
    "parton level calculations are presented in section ii .",
    "the cms detector performance is adopted for a realistic study of observability .",
    "results from realistic simulations are discussed in section 3 and promising conclusions are drawn in section 4 .",
    "in our analysis , the cross section of @xmath21 is evaluated from the higgs boson cross section @xmath22 multiplied with the branching fraction of the higgs decay into muon pairs @xmath23 .",
    "the parton distribution functions of cteq2l @xcite are chosen to evaluate the cross section of @xmath24 with @xmath25 gev and @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the transverse momentum of the higgs bosons .",
    "we take @xmath28 gev , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 gev , and @xmath32 gev .",
    "we have included one loop corrections from top and bottom yukawa interactions to the higgs masses and couplings using the effective potential @xcite-@xcite with @xmath33 .",
    "the contributions from the d - terms are usually small @xcite , therefore , they are not included .",
    "we consider two sets of parameters similar to those discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , ( a ) @xmath34 gev , such that the higgs boson decays to susy particles are kinematically forbidden ; and ( b ) @xmath35 gev , such that the higgs boson decays to susy particles are large and dominant when @xmath16 is less than about 10 .",
    "the k - factors are not included for the signal or the background .    at the lhc energy , the sm higgs boson ( @xmath0 )",
    "is produced dominantly from gluon fusion @xcite , and from vector boson fusion @xcite-@xcite if the higgs boson is heavy . in the mssm , gluon fusion ( @xmath36 )",
    "is the major source of neutral higgs bosons for @xmath16 less than about 4 .",
    "if @xmath16 is larger than about 10 , neutral higgs bosons in the mssm are dominantly produced from @xmath20-quark fusion ( @xmath37 ) @xcite .",
    "we have evaluated the cross section of higgs bosons in @xmath38 collisions @xmath22 , with two dominant subprocesses : @xmath36 and @xmath39 .",
    "the cross section of @xmath39 is a good approximation to the ` exact ' cross section @xcite of @xmath37 for @xmath40 less than about 500 gev .",
    "in addition , the subprocesses @xmath39 and @xmath41 are complementary to each other for producing large @xmath27 higgs bosons at future hadron colliders @xcite .",
    "since the yukawa couplings of @xmath42 are enhanced by @xmath43 , the production rate of neutral higgs bosons is usually enhanced with large @xmath16 . for @xmath7 larger than about 150 gev , the couplings of the lighter scalar @xmath5 to gauge bosons and fermions become close to those of the sm higgs boson , therefore , gluon fusion is the major source of the @xmath5 even if @xmath16 is large .",
    "if the @xmath18 mode dominates higgs decays , the branching fraction of @xmath44 is about @xmath45 .",
    "it has been found that qcd radiative corrections reduce the decay width of @xmath46 by a factor of about 2 @xcite .",
    "therefore , the branching fraction of @xmath44 is about @xmath47 when the @xmath18 mode dominates .",
    "let s consider a parameter space of ( @xmath19 ) with 50 gev @xmath48 500 gev and @xmath49 .",
    "the branching fraction of @xmath50 in the whole parameter space as well as @xmath51 and @xmath52 with @xmath53 is always about @xmath47 , even when @xmath6 and @xmath4 can decay into susy particles . for @xmath7 less than about 80 gev",
    ", the @xmath4 decays dominantly into @xmath54 , @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "1 shows the cross section of @xmath21 as a function of @xmath7 for various values of @xmath16 .",
    "we have taken @xmath57 tev .",
    "for @xmath53 , the production cross section is always enhanced .",
    "as expected , the cross section of @xmath58 does not change much with @xmath16 for @xmath59 gev .",
    "also shown is the same cross section for the sm higgs boson @xmath0 with @xmath60 . for @xmath61 gev",
    ", the sm @xmath0 mainly decays into gauge bosons , therefore , the branching fraction @xmath62 drops sharply .",
    "we define the signal to be observable if the @xmath63 confidence level upper limit on the background is smaller than the corresponding lower limit on the signal plus background @xcite , namely , @xmath64\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath65 is the integrated luminosity , and @xmath66 is the background cross section within a bin of width @xmath67 centered at @xmath40 ; @xmath68 corresponds to a @xmath63 confidence level and @xmath69 corresponds to a 5@xmath70 signal .    to study the observability of the muon discovery mode",
    ", we consider the background from the drell - yan ( dy ) process , @xmath71 , which is the dominant background .",
    "we take @xmath72 to be the larger of the cms muon mass resolution or the higgs boson width .",
    "the minimal cuts applied are ( 1 ) @xmath73 gev and ( 2 ) @xmath74 , for both the signal and background .",
    "more details about the background will be discussed in next section .",
    "the 5@xmath70 discovery contours at @xmath75 14 tev are shown in fig .",
    "2 , for ( a ) @xmath76 fb@xmath77 , @xmath78 gev , ( b ) @xmath76 fb@xmath77 , @xmath79 gev , and ( c ) @xmath80 fb@xmath77 , @xmath78 gev . the @xmath6 might be detectable in a large region of parameter space with @xmath16 away from one .",
    "the @xmath4 might be observable in a region with @xmath81 120 gev and @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath5 might be observable in a region with @xmath82 gev and @xmath83 .",
    "this channel is affected by the susy decay modes only slightly for @xmath4 and @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the lighter top squarks will make the @xmath4 and @xmath5 lighter and enhance the @xmath84 coupling while reducing the @xmath85 coupling .",
    "therefore , the discovery region of @xmath86 is slightly enlarged for a smaller @xmath7 , but the observable region of @xmath87 is slightly reduced .",
    "like the @xmath88 mode , the discovery potential of the @xmath89 channel is very sensitive to the detector performance .",
    "therefore , one needs to fix some detector model for quantitative estimates .",
    "the cms detector performance parameters are used in our analysis to estimate the signal and backgrounds .",
    "the cms will be one of two general purpose lhc detectors , and the very precise muon momentum reconstruction is one of its main parameters , which define the detector design @xcite .",
    "thus , it will be an excellent detector to look for the narrow di - muon resonances .",
    "we use pythia 5.7 and jetset 7.4 generators @xcite with the cteq2l @xcite parton distribution functions to simulate events on the particle level . in the case of dy background near the @xmath90-peak , qed corrections are very important and have been taken into account by treating the @xmath91 decay with the computer program photos @xcite .",
    "in addition to @xmath36 , the new debugged pythia @xcite allows one to use @xmath39 process for the production of all neutral mssm higgs bosons .",
    "the generated kinematics and total cross sections are in reasonable agreement with analytical parton level calculations . for our purpose",
    "we adapted in pythia the program calculating 1-loop corrected masses and couplings @xcite .",
    "the pythia / jetset / photos outputs are processed with the cmsjet program @xcite .",
    "it is developed for fast simulations of `` realistic '' cms detector response .",
    "the resolution effects are taken into account by using the parametrizations obtained from the detailed geant @xcite simulations .",
    "cmsjet includes also some analysis programs , in particular , a set of jet reconstruction algorithms , etc .    for future analysis , all muons with transverse momentum @xmath92 gev and pseudorapidity @xmath93 ; missing transverse momentum @xmath94 ; central jets with transverse energy @xmath95 gev and @xmath96",
    "are reconstructed and stored for each generated event .",
    "there are several sm physical processes that generate sizeable muon pairs decays . ] .",
    "however , analyzing them process by process , one can conclude , that there is only one dominant subprocess in the interesting mass range ( 50 gev @xmath97 gev ) , which is the dy muon pair production @xcite . for low @xmath98 gev",
    "the @xmath18 background is also potentially dangerous , but it can be reduced easily well below the dy process with isolation cuts on muons . the background from top quark pairs ( @xmath99 ) is negligible in the region @xmath100 30 gev .",
    "it is about 20 times smaller than the dy for @xmath101 gev and begins to compete with the dy for the highest @xmath102 .",
    "about 90@xmath103 of muon pairs in @xmath99 production are generated from the decay chain @xmath104 .",
    "for comparison , the event rate from @xmath105 is 3 - 5 times lower than that from @xmath106 .    to optimize the kinematical cuts , sizeable ( @xmath107 ) background event samples",
    "are generated using the production chain described above .",
    "our analysis indicates , that , in fact , after @xmath102 is constrained in a small bin around some fixed @xmath40 ( we are looking for the narrow states ) , there are no further suitable kinematical cuts to suppress the dominant dy background .",
    "so here some minimal cuts , providing good signal efficiency and acceptance are used : @xmath108 gev with @xmath109 .",
    "the @xmath99 background can be reduced nearly by a factor of 5 with additional cuts : missing transverse energy @xmath110 gev , @xmath111 for jets with @xmath95 gev , and @xmath112 .",
    "the muon isolation reduces the @xmath18 background by a factor of about 100 .      the invariant mass distribution ( @xmath113 ) of the backgrounds from ( a ) drell - yan , ( b ) @xmath114 , ( c ) @xmath99 , and ( d ) @xmath18 , are shown in fig .",
    "3 .    fig .",
    "4 shows the @xmath115 significance contour for cms detector and @xmath76 fb@xmath77 with minimal cuts discussed above and isolation criteria applied for low masses ( @xmath116 gev ) . in this figure",
    ", we have considered the total cross section of @xmath117 , summed over the @xmath5 , the @xmath4 and the @xmath6 . for @xmath118 gev and @xmath119",
    ", an integrated luminosity of 10 fb@xmath77 would be sufficient to obtain higgs signals with a statistical significance larger than 7 .",
    "but in the region close to the @xmath90- peak , the signal is marginal despite the large significance , because it appears on the shoulder of the huge @xmath90- peak .",
    "only an adequate subtraction procedure , if it would be possible , enables one to extract the signal in this region .",
    "despite the high di - muon mass resolution of cms detector ( about 0.5% for @xmath120 gev and better than 2% for @xmath121",
    "gev ) , for large @xmath122 one can obtain the unresolved ( h , a ) signal for @xmath123 gev or ( h , a ) signal for higher @xmath124 , because the mass difference between the ( h , a ) or ( h , a ) higgs bosons is several hundreds mev , i.e. a factor of 10 less than higgs widths . only for the lowest accessible @xmath125 it seems to be possible to resolve the signals for two resonances . but the signal become not so significant .",
    "5 illustrates the signal over the backgrounds as function of @xmath102 at @xmath126 tev with an integrated luminosity of 100 fb@xmath77 , @xmath127 gev , and @xmath128 .",
    "this figure is generated from a simulation with the cms performance and @xmath129 1000 gev .",
    "it is found that the muon pair decay mode can be a very promising channel to discover the neutral higgs bosons of minimal supersymmetry .",
    "the discovery region of the @xmath130 might be slightly smaller than the @xmath131 channel but it will allow precise reconstruction for the higgs boson masses .",
    "the @xmath6 might be observable in a large region of parameter space with @xmath16 away from one",
    ". the @xmath4 might be detectable in a large region with @xmath81 120 gev and @xmath53 .",
    "the @xmath5 might be observable in a region with @xmath82 gev and @xmath83 .    for @xmath132 gev and @xmath133 , @xmath134 10 fb@xmath77 would be enough to obtain higgs boson signals with a statistical significance larger than 7 . for @xmath102 close to the @xmath135 ,",
    "the signal is marginal despite the large significance , because it appears on the shoulder of the huge @xmath90 peak .",
    "adequate subtraction procedures are required to extract the signal in this region .",
    "one attractive possibility is to tag the @xmath20-jets accompanying the @xmath130 from the higgs decay , since the production rate of higgs bosons via @xmath39 is large . with high @xmath20-tagging efficiency and purity",
    ", we can reduce the dominant dy background to the level of @xmath136 production . in this case , the @xmath99 background may become dangerous , and the additional cuts discussed above may be crucial . this signature is currently under study .      we would like to thank howie baer and xerxes tata for beneficial discussions and comments , and especially , duane dicus for continuing encouragement as well as instructions . this research was supported in part by the us department of energy grant de - fg02 - 91er40685 .
