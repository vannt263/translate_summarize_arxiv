    "<S> we perform a dedicated study of the sn neutrino flavor evolution during the accretion phase , using results from recent neutrino radiation hydrodynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to what expected in the presence of only neutrino - neutrino interactions , we find that the multi - angle effects associated with the dense ordinary matter suppress collective oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> the matter suppression implies that neutrino oscillations will start outside the neutrino decoupling region and therefore will have a negligible impact on the neutrino heating and the explosion dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the possible detection of the next galactic sn neutrino signal from the accretion phase , based on the usual mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein effect in the sn mantle and earth matter effects , can reveal the neutrino mass hierarchy in the case that the mixing angle @xmath0 is not very small .    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction. _ neutrinos emitted from core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) represent a crucial tool to get valuable information about the mixing parameters and an insight into the dynamics of the exploding stellar core  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> sn neutrinos not only interact with the stellar medium via the mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) effect  @xcite , but also with other neutrinos ( @xmath1 ) and antineutrinos ( @xmath2 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it was pointed out that large @xmath1 densities in the deepest stellar regions can result in significant coherent @xmath1@xmath1 forward scatterings  @xcite , which give rise to collective @xmath1 flavor oscillations inside the sn  @xcite ( see  @xcite for a recent review ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the development of these self - induced @xmath1 transformations crucially depends on the primary sn @xmath1 spectra ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . at this regard the post - bounce accretion phase of core - collapse sne , </S>",
    "<S> lasting few tens of milliseconds ( for low mass o - ne - mg - core progenitors ) up to several hundreds of milliseconds ( for more massive iron - core progenitors ) , might seem the best opportunity to detect signatures of collective @xmath1 flavor oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the absolute @xmath1 fluxes are large during the accretion phase with significant spectral differences between the different @xmath1 species , and a flux order @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> this scenario has been often taken as a benchmark for the description of the self - induced effects . </S>",
    "<S> notably , these latter would leave the @xmath1 spectra unaffected in normal mass hierarchy ( nh : @xmath4 ) . in the inverted @xmath1 mass hierarchy ( ih : @xmath5 ) , they would produce a complete exchange of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 spectra , and a spectral split in the energy distributions of the @xmath1 s  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this seemingly robust and clear behavior has been proposed as an unique way to determine the @xmath1 mass hierarchy even if the leptonic 13 mixing angle @xmath0 is too small to be detected in terrestrial @xmath1 oscillation experiments  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the implicit assumption in this picture is related to the flavor evolution in the deepest sn regions being driven by only large neutrino densities @xmath8 . however , during the accretion phase also the net electron density @xmath9 is expected to be large , as documented by many different sn simulations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is a generic feature that applies to sne of massive iron - core progenitors . as recently pointed out in  @xcite and confirmed in  @xcite , when @xmath9 is not negligible with respect to @xmath10 , the large phase dispersion induced by the matter for @xmath1 s traveling in different directions , will partially or totally suppress the collective oscillations through peculiar multi - angle effects .    motivated by this insight </S>",
    "<S> , we have performed a detailed study of the sn @xmath1 flavor evolution during the accretion phase , characterizing the @xmath1 signal and the matter density profiles by means of recent neutrino radiation hydrodynamics simulations . </S>",
    "<S> contrarily to what shown in previous studies based on the only @xmath1-@xmath1 interaction effects , we find that the presence of a dominant matter term inhibits the development of collective flavor conversions . </S>",
    "<S> the matter suppression ranges from complete to partial , producing intriguing time - dependent features . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , when it is complete ( for post - bounce times @xmath11  s in iron - core sne ) the @xmath1 signal will be processed only by the usual msw effect in the sn mantle and earth matter effects . </S>",
    "<S> this was the usual description before the inclusion of collective phenomena . </S>",
    "<S> this _ dj vu _ would reopen the possibility , prevented by self - induced effects , to reveal the neutrino mass hierarchy through the earth matter effect on the next galactic sn neutrino burst , in the case @xmath0 is not very small  @xcite .    _ </S>",
    "<S> @xmath1 signal from the accretion phase. _ we take as benchmark for our study the results of the recent long - term sn simulations , described in  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these are based on radiation hydrodynamics that employs three flavor boltzmann neutrino transport in spherical symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:1 ] shows the evolution of the @xmath1 number fluxes @xmath12 for the different neutrino flavors @xmath13 up to 0.6  seconds after core bounce , for the 10.8  m@xmath14 iron - core progenitor model . </S>",
    "<S> enhanced @xmath1 heating was applied , because a neutrino - driven explosion can not be obtained in spherical symmetry for such a progenitor ( for details , see  @xcite ) . the first phase after core bounce lasts only @xmath15  s , where large numbers of electron captures release a flare of @xmath16 with luminosities on the order of @xmath17  erg / s . </S>",
    "<S> it is followed by the accretion phase that can last up to several hundred milliseconds . </S>",
    "<S> after the onset of the explosion , mass accretion vanishes at the neutrinospheres ( i.e. , @xmath1 last - scattering surfaces ) and the neutrino luminosities are determined by diffusion . </S>",
    "<S> it results in a sharp drop of the fluxes after the explosion shock crosses a distance of 500  km , where the fluxes are measured in a co - moving reference frame . </S>",
    "<S> the fluxes of all flavors decrease continuously on a longer timescale of @xmath18  s ) , indicating the beginning of the cooling phase .    </S>",
    "<S> _ setup of the flavor evolution. _ our description of the @xmath1 flavor conversions is based on a two - flavor scenario , driven by the atmospheric mass - square difference @xmath19  ev@xmath20 and by a small ( matter suppressed ) in - medium mixing @xmath21  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> three - flavor effects , associated with the solar sector , are small for the @xmath1 flux ordering expected during the accretion phase  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we will always refer to the inverted mass hierarchy where for the assumed spectral ordering collective oscillations are possible  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the impact of the non - isotropic nature of the @xmath1 emission on the flavor conversions is taken into account by `` multi - angle '' simulations  @xcite , where one follows a large number @xmath22 $ ] of interacting @xmath1 modes . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1 s emitted from a sn core naturally have a broad energy distribution . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is largely irrelevant for our purposes , since large matter effects would lock togheter the different neutrino energy modes , both in case of supression  @xcite and of decoherence  @xcite of collective oscillations . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , to simplify the complexity of the numerical simulations , we assume all @xmath1 s to be represented by a single energy , that we take @xmath23  mev .     </S>",
    "<S> fluxes during the accretion phase of the 10.8  m@xmath14 sn explosion model . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:1 ] ]    the strength of the @xmath1@xmath1 interaction is given by @xmath24   $ ]  @xcite , where @xmath25 is the number density of the @xmath1 species @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath1@xmath1 potential is normalized at the neutrinosphere , where @xmath1 s are assumed to be half - isotropically emitted  @xcite . we determine the neutrinospheres from the core - collapse sn simulations , where during the accretion phase the neutrinosphere radius is at @xmath26  km . </S>",
    "<S> the matter potential is represented by @xmath27  @xcite , encoding the net electron density , @xmath28 .        </S>",
    "<S> _ matter and neutrino densities. _ in fig .  [ fig2 ] we show the net electron density @xmath9 ( left panel ) and the ratio @xmath29 between electron and neutrino densities entering the potentials ( right panel ) , at selected post - bounce times . </S>",
    "<S> one can recognize the abrupt discontinuity in @xmath9 associated with the sn shock - front that propagates in time . from the ratio @xmath30 at the different post - bounce times </S>",
    "<S> , we realize that @xmath9 is always larger than or comparable to @xmath31 , suggesting that matter effects can not be ignored during the accretion phase . </S>",
    "<S> depending on the strength of the matter density , the matter suppression can be total , when @xmath32 , or partial when the matter dominance is less pronounced . </S>",
    "<S> finally , when @xmath33 the interference of the two comparable potentials leads to a flavor equilibrium with a complete mixture of electron and non - electron species  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ neutrino flavor conversions. _ in order to have a quantitative description of these matter effects , we performed a multi - angle numerical study of the @xmath1 flavor evolution in the schematic model described above . in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] we show the radial evolution of the @xmath34 survival probability @xmath35 for the same post - bounce times as in fig .  [ fig2 ] . for comparison </S>",
    "<S> , we also show the example of what is expected in the case of @xmath36 ( light curve for @xmath37  s ) . </S>",
    "<S> as predicted , we find that matter strongly suppresses the development of the self - induced flavor transformations . in particular , at @xmath38  s , when @xmath39 the flavor conversions are completely blocked ( @xmath40 ) . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , at @xmath41  s when @xmath42 in the conversions region , the matter suppression is only partial giving a final @xmath43 . </S>",
    "<S> finally , at @xmath37  s when @xmath44 , matter effects produce a complete flavor mixture ( @xmath45 ) . from a systematic study of the flavor evolution at different time snapshots during the accretion phase , we find _ </S>",
    "<S> ( i ) _ a complete matter suppression of the self - induced transformations for @xmath46  s , _ </S>",
    "<S> ( ii ) _ partial matter suppression for @xmath47  s , and _ ( iii ) _ again complete suppression for @xmath48  s. this feature suggests a time - dependent pattern for the @xmath1 conversions , i.e. complete - partial - complete suppression .    </S>",
    "<S> the behavior , analyzed for this specific example of the 10.8  m@xmath14 sn explosion model , is generic also for more massive iron - core sne . </S>",
    "<S> it is independent from the explosion scenarios and applies also for non - exploding models . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , in any case the density of the material , enclosed inside the standing bounce shock , can only increase due to mass accretion from the iron - core envelope . only after the onset of an explosion , when mass accretion vanishes , the matter density decreases . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the low - mass o - ne - mg - core sne , where the matter density profile is very steep , the suppression is never complete . as a consequence , </S>",
    "<S> the different features induced by the dense matter effects on the oscillations may allow to distinguish iron - core sne from o - ne - mg - core sne  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> our results have been obtained considering a spherically symmetric neutrino emission . </S>",
    "<S> all the previous analysis in the field have relied on this assumption to make the flavor evolution equations numerically tractable . </S>",
    "<S> it remains to be investigated if the removal of a perfect spherical symmetry can provide a different behavior in the flavor evolution  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in multi - dimensional sn models density fluctuations are expected behind the standing bounce shock , due to the presence of convection and hydro instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> these can range at most between 10@xmath49 to a factor 2 - 3 ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , even in this case , the matter suppression of the collective oscillations will still remain relevant . </S>",
    "<S> this claim is supported by a recent analysis of the matter suppression , performed with two - dimensional sn simulations  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> _ oscillated sn neutrino fluxes _ figure  [ fig4 ] shows the @xmath6 distribution function at the neutrinosphere ( continuous thin curve ) as well as after self - induced and matter effects at @xmath50  km ( continuous thick curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compare the case of complete matter suppression at @xmath51  s ( left panel , where thin and thick continuous curves coincide ) and complete flavor mixture at @xmath37  s ( right panel ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also show the oscillated flux for @xmath36 , where a complete @xmath52 swap occurs ( dashed curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> the difference in the final @xmath34 flux with / without matter suppression is striking . </S>",
    "<S> it is plausible that a high - statistics detection of a future galactic sn @xmath1 signal would monitor the abrupt spectral changes between the phases of complete and partial matter suppression , probing this scenario . </S>",
    "<S> these peculiar time variations in the @xmath1 signal during the accretion would represent also a new tool to extract information on the @xmath1 mass ordering , since the effects of dense matter would show up only in the case of inverted mass hierarchy .     </S>",
    "<S> survival probability @xmath35 at selected post - bounce times from multi - angle simulations in matter ( black continuous curves ) and for @xmath36 ( light curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3 ] ]     at the neutrinosphere ( continuous thin curve ) and after self - induced and matter effects at @xmath50  km ( continuous thick curve ) , in the case of complete matter suppression ( @xmath53 at @xmath51  s , left panel ) and complete flavor mixture ( @xmath54 at @xmath37  s , right panel ) . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the oscillated @xmath34 spectra obtained for @xmath36 are also shown ( dashed thin curve ) . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4 ] ]    _ earth matter effect. _ a further consequence of the matter suppression is a significant change in the interpretation of the earth matter effect on the sn @xmath1 signal during the accretion phase , occurring when @xmath1 s oscillate inside the earth before being detected ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) . in the case of complete matter suppression of the self - induced oscillations </S>",
    "<S> ( at @xmath46  s for iron - core sne ) , the observable sn @xmath1 fluxes at earth have been already calculated in the literature , antecedent to the inclusion of the collective effects . for definiteness , here we consider the earth effects on the @xmath6 spectrum , observable through inverse beta decay reactions @xmath55 at large volume cherenkov or scintillation detectors ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath34 flux at earth @xmath56 in nh for any value of the mixing angle @xmath0 is given by @xmath57  @xcite , where @xmath58 is the 12 mixing angle , with @xmath59  @xcite . in the ih case , for `` large '' @xmath0 ( i.e. for @xmath60 ) </S>",
    "<S> @xmath61 , while for `` small '' @xmath0 ( i.e. for @xmath62 ) the flux is the same as in the case of nh . </S>",
    "<S> earth effects can be taken into account by mapping @xmath63 and @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is the probability that a state entering the earth as mass eigenstate @xmath66 is detected as @xmath34 at the detector ( see , e.g. ,  @xcite ) .    in this scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the presence or absence of earth matter effects at early times ( @xmath46  s ) will allow to distinguish the @xmath1 mass hierarchy at large value of the mixing angle @xmath0 . this possibility , prevented in the previous scenario with dominant self - induced effects , is particularly attractive since there are already hints for a `` large '' @xmath0  @xcite , promising its possible detection with the current and upcoming reactor and accelerator experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus for large @xmath0 , the next galactic sn @xmath1 signal would become crucial to get a determination of the @xmath1 mass hierarchy from the sky . _ </S>",
    "<S> impact on sn heating. _ neutrino flavor oscillations between the neutrinospheres and the standing bounce shock , have long been speculated to influence the @xmath1 heating and hence the sn dynamics  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , we find that the high matter density in the heating region causes complete suppression of the flavor conversion behind the shock - front . </S>",
    "<S> hence , collective @xmath1 flavor oscillations can not help to increase the @xmath1 heating significantly and an impact on the sn dynamics is not expected . </S>",
    "<S> our result is in agreement with the analysis recently performed in  @xcite . in order to solve the sn problem , which is related to the revival of the stalled bounce shock , it is possible to decouple the @xmath1 flavor evolution from the hydrodynamics aspects as well as from the @xmath1 transport . </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions. _ in early , schematic investigations , the accretion phase seemed particularly promising to probe the development of the collective @xmath1 transformations . </S>",
    "<S> however , by analyzing state - of - the art simulations , we pointed out that the presence of a large matter density piled - up above the neutrinosphere can take its revenge over the @xmath1@xmath1 interactions , producing a significant suppression of the self - induced flavor conversions . </S>",
    "<S> the presence of a large matter density during the accretion phase is a robust feature of sn simulations  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , its impact on the self - induced oscillations was estimated most often negligible in previous studies ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) .    </S>",
    "<S> even if the matter suppression would prevent collective effects on the @xmath1 signal during the accretion phase , its presence will result in various benefits . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the detection of the earth matter effect on the sn @xmath1 burst during the accretion may allow to extract the @xmath1 mass hierarchy , if @xmath0 is not too small . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the matter suppression of oscillations at high densities decouples the problem of the @xmath1 flavor mixing in sne from the @xmath1 transport and impact on the matter heating / cooling .    </S>",
    "<S> collective oscillations may remain possible during the cooling phase , when the matter effects become sub - dominant due to the continuously decreasing matter density . </S>",
    "<S> however , the characterization of these effects in the presence of small flux differences and of matter turbulences is far from being settled . </S>",
    "<S> further studies are crucial to understand possible effects of self - induced @xmath1 oscillations and imprinted observable signatures . </S>"
