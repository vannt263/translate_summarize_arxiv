    "the second term of the normalized coincidence ( [ eqn : normalizedcorrelationst ] ) is responsible for the antibunching of electrons ( reduction of the coincidence rate when the two detectors are close together and the detection delay time is small ) , while the third gives a positive contribution to the coincidences .",
    "it is instructive to rewrite the two - particle distribution ( [ eqn : twodistri ] ) in terms of the two - particle wave functions : by substituting the two - point correlation function @xmath89 given in ( [ eqn : gamma ] ) , i.e.  the contributions of the quasiparticle excitations , the first two terms in ( [ eqn : twodistri ] ) read@xcite    @xmath104    where @xmath105 are the symmetrized / antisymmetrized two - particle wave functions of the emitted electrons .",
    "this expression clarifies that 3/4 of the contributions of the quasiparticle excitations are provided by the antisymmetric wave function @xmath106 , while the remaining 1/4 is given by the symmetric one @xmath107 .",
    "recall that the state of the fermions as a whole should be antisymmetric .",
    "the symmetric wave function in space therefore corresponds to the antisymmetric state in spin , and vice versa .",
    "as already mentioned , @xmath89 describes the emission of the single particles .",
    "the electrons in the emitter are not spin polarized when one looks at the single electrons and they appear to be equally emitted from the triplet ( antisymmetric in space ) and singlet ( symmetric in space ) spin states .",
    "this just gives the background : the interplay between these contributions yields antibunching @xcite but does not reveal the effect of the cooper - pair correlation in the emitter .",
    "the cooper pairs do not significantly contribute to antibunching , but yield the positive correlation , i.e.  the last contribution in ( [ eqn : normalizedcorrelationst ] ) .",
    "let us look at the andreev amplitude , the first contribution to @xmath96 in ( [ eqn : andreev ] ) .",
    "this expression entails that one electron in a pair originates with momentum @xmath16 in the emitter , while the other with momentum @xmath108 .",
    "notice here that the integrand is symmetric under exchange between @xmath16 and @xmath108 and the two alternatives are symmetrically superposed .",
    "this symmetric superposition reflects the fact that the cooper pairs in the emitter form singlet couples , antisymmetric in spin .",
    "this symmetry in the amplitude with respect to the spatial degrees of freedom gives rise to _ bunching _ : two electrons bunch when they originate from momenta with the same magnitudes but oriented in opposite directions .",
    "this is the origin of the positive contribution in ( [ eqn : normalizedcorrelationst ] ) .",
    "positive correlation of electrons due to superconductivity has been discussed in the literature , in the current fluctuations in transport setups.@xcite for instance , it is shown that the cross - correlation of the currents at two different normal leads connected to a superconductor can be both negative and positive , while it is quite generally negative in normal devices .",
    "it is pointed out that the positive correlation is due to the processes involving `` crossed andreev reflections , '' which provide transport of particles with opposite charges from one normal lead to the other via the superconductor ( an electron in one normal lead is converted into a hole in the other normal lead , and vice versa),@xcite and the sign of the overall cross - correlation is determined by the competition between the negative contributions due to the normal scattering and the positive contributions due to the andreev reflections . in the present field - emission setup , there is no `` hole '' in vacuum , but the crossed andreev reflection is equivalent to the emission of electrons from a common cooper pair toward different detectors . in the present analysis ,",
    "it is clear from the formula , as just explained above , that the positive correlation is due to bunching as a result of the symmetric wave function of a couple of electrons emitted from a cooper pair , reflecting its singlet spin state .",
    "in addition , it is shown below that the negative and positive contributions appear separately in the present field - emission setup , and the pure positive correlation is observed : one need not argue the competition between the negative and positive contributions .    the amplitude for the andreev emission ( [ eqn : andreev ] ) is also symmetric under the exchange between @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "this symmetry reveals that the emitted electron pairs are also in the singlet state .",
    "this point is explicit in the expression ( [ eqn : andreevamp ] ) .",
    "the entanglement of the emitted pair is one of the main subjects of this article and is explored below .",
