    "hamiltonian problems are of great interest in many fields of application , ranging from the macro - scale of celestial mechanics , to the micro - scale of molecular dynamics .",
    "they have been deeply studied , from the point of view of the mathematical analysis , since two centuries .",
    "their numerical solution is a more recent field of investigation , which has led to define symplectic methods , i.e. , the simplecticity of the discrete map , considering that , for the continuous flow , simplecticity implies the conservation of @xmath1 .",
    "however , the conservation of the hamiltonian and simplecticity of the flow can not be satisfied at the same time unless the integrator produces the exact solution ( see ( * ? ? ? * page379 ) ) .",
    "more recently , the conservation of energy has been approached by means of the concept of the _ discrete line integral _ , in a series of papers @xcite , leading to the definition of _ hamiltonian boundary value methods ( hbvms ) _",
    "@xcite , which is a class of methods able to preserve , for the discrete solution , polynomial hamiltonians of arbitrarily high degree ( and then , a _ practical _ conservation of any sufficiently differentiable hamiltonian ) . in more details , in @xcite , hbvms based on lobatto nodes have been analysed , whereas in @xcite hbvms based on gauss - legendre abscissae have been considered . in the last reference , it has been actually shown that both formulae are essentially equivalent to each other , since the order and stability properties of the method turn out to be independent of the abscissae distribution , and both methods are equivalent , when the number of the so called _ silent stages _ tends to infinity . in this paper",
    "this conclusion if further supported , since we prove that hbvms , when cast as runge - kutta methods , are such that the corresponding matrix of the tableau has the nonzero eigenvalues coincident with those of the corresponding gauss - legendre formula ( isospectral property of hbvms ) .",
    "this property can be also used to further analyse the existing connections between hbvms and runge - kutta collocation methods .    with this premise ,",
    "the structure of the paper is the following : in section  [ hbvms ] the basic facts about hbvms are recalled ; in section  [ iso ] we state the main result of this paper , concerning the isospectral property ; in section  [ coll ] such property is further generalized to study the existing connections between hbvms and runge - kutta collocation methods ; finally , in section  [ fine ] a few concluding remarks are given .",
    "the arguments in this section are worked out starting from the arguments used in @xcite to introduce and analyse hbvms .",
    "we consider canonical hamiltonian problems in the form @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a skew - symmetric constant matrix , and the hamiltonian @xmath1 is assumed to be sufficiently differentiable .",
    "the key formula which hbvms rely on , is the _ line integral _ and the related property of conservative vector fields : @xmath4    for any @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is any smooth function such that @xmath7    here we consider the case where @xmath8 is a polynomial of degree @xmath9 , yielding an approximation to the true solution @xmath10 in the time interval @xmath11 $ ] .",
    "the numerical approximation for the subsequent time - step , @xmath12 , is then defined by ( [ sigma ] ) .    after introducing a set of @xmath9 distinct abscissae , @xmath13    we set @xmath14    so that @xmath8 may be thought of as an interpolation polynomial , interpolating the _ fundamental stages _",
    "@xmath15 , @xmath16 , at the abscissae ( [ ci ] ) .",
    "we observe that , due to ( [ sigma ] ) , @xmath8 also interpolates the initial condition @xmath17 .",
    "[ c0 ] sometimes , the interpolation at @xmath18 is explicitly required .",
    "in such a case , the extra abscissa @xmath19 is formally added to ( [ ci ] ) .",
    "this is the case , for example , of a lobatto distribution of the abscissae @xcite .",
    "let us consider the following expansions of @xmath20 and @xmath8 for @xmath21 $ ] : @xmath22    where @xmath23 is a suitable basis of the vector space of polynomials of degree at most @xmath24 and the ( vector ) coefficients @xmath25 are to be determined .",
    "we shall consider an _",
    "orthonormal basis _ of polynomials on the interval @xmath26 $ ] , i.e. : @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the kronecker symbol , and @xmath29 has degree @xmath30 . such a basis can be readily obtained as @xmath31    with @xmath32 the shifted legendre polynomial , of degree @xmath30 , on the interval @xmath26 $ ] .",
    "[ recur ] from the properties of shifted legendre polynomials ( see , e.g. , @xcite or the appendix in @xcite ) , one readily obtains that the polynomials @xmath23 satisfy the three - terms recurrence relation : @xmath33    we shall also assume that @xmath1 is a polynomial , which implies that the integrand in is also a polynomial so that the line integral can be exactly computed by means of a suitable quadrature formula .",
    "it is easy to observe that in general , due to the high degree of the integrand function , such quadrature formula can not be solely based upon the available abscissae @xmath34 : one needs to introduce an additional set of abscissae @xmath35 , distinct from the nodes @xmath34 , in order to make the quadrature formula exact : @xmath36    where @xmath37 , @xmath16 , and @xmath38 , @xmath39 , denote the weights of the quadrature formula corresponding to the abscissae @xmath40 , i.e. , @xmath41    [ c01 ] in the case considered in the previous remark  [ c0 ] , i.e. when @xmath19 is formally added to the abscissae ( [ ci ] ) , the first product in each formula in ( [ betai ] ) ranges from @xmath42 to @xmath9",
    ". moreover , also the range of @xmath43 becomes @xmath44 .",
    "however , for sake of simplicity , we shall not consider this case further .",
    "[ defhbvmks ] the method defined by the polynomial @xmath8 , determined by substituting the quantities in into the right - hand side of , and by choosing the unknown coefficient @xmath25 in order that the resulting expression vanishes , is called _ hamiltonian boundary value method with @xmath45 steps and degree @xmath9 _ , in short _ hbvm(@xmath45,@xmath9 ) _ , where @xmath46 @xcite .    according to @xcite , the right - hand side of",
    "is called _ discrete line integral _ associated with the map defined by the hbvm(@xmath45,@xmath9 ) , while the vectors @xmath47    are called _ silent stages _",
    ": they just serve to increase , as much as one likes , the degree of precision of the quadrature formula , but they are not to be regarded as unknowns since , from and ( [ hyi ] ) , they can be expressed in terms of linear combinations of the fundamental stages ( [ yi ] ) .    in the sequel",
    ", we shall see that hbvms may be expressed through different , though equivalent , formulations : some of them can be directly implemented in a computer program , the others being of more theoretical interest .",
    "because of the equality , we can apply the procedure described in definition [ defhbvmks ] directly to the original line integral appearing in the left - hand side . with this premise , by considering the first expansion in , the conservation property reads @xmath48    which , as is easily checked , is certainly satisfied if we impose the following set of orthogonality conditions : @xmath49    then , from the second relation of we obtain , by introducing the operator @xmath50,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    that @xmath6 is the eigenfunction of @xmath51 relative to the eigenvalue @xmath52 : @xmath53    equation ( [ l ] ) is the _ master functional equation _ defining @xmath6  @xcite .",
    "[ mfe ] from the previous arguments , one readily obtains that the master functional equation ( [ l ] ) characterizes hbvm@xmath54 methods , for all @xmath55 .",
    "indeed , such methods are uniquely defined by the polynomial @xmath6 , of degree @xmath9 , the number of steps @xmath45 being only required to obtain an exact quadrature formula ( see ( [ discr_lin ] ) ) .    to practically compute @xmath6 , we set ( see ( [ yi ] ) and ( [ expan ] ) ) @xmath56    where @xmath57 inserting into yields the final formulae which define the hbvms class based upon the orthonormal basis @xmath58 : @xmath59    for sake of completeness",
    ", we report the nonlinear system associated with the hbvm@xmath54 method , in terms of the fundamental stages @xmath60 and the silent stages @xmath61 ( see ( [ hyi ] ) ) , by using the notation @xmath62    in this context , it represents the discrete counterpart of , and may be directly retrieved by evaluating , for example , the integrals in by means of the ( exact ) quadrature formula introduced in : @xmath63    from the above discussion it is clear that , in the non - polynomial case , supposing to choose the abscissae @xmath64 so that the sums in ( [ hbvm_sys ] ) converge to an integral as @xmath65 , the resulting formula is .    [ infh ] formula ( [ hbvm_int ] ) is named _ @xmath66-hbvm of degree @xmath9 _ or _ hbvm@xmath67 _",
    "@xcite .",
    "this implies that hbvms may be as well applied in the non - polynomial case since , in finite precision arithmetic , hbvms are undistinguishable from their limit formulae , when a sufficient number of silent stages is introduced .",
    "the aspect of having a _ practical _ exact integral , for @xmath45 large enough , was already stressed in @xcite .    on the other hand , we emphasize that , in the non - polynomial case , becomes an _ operative method _ only after that a suitable strategy to approximate the integrals appearing in it is taken into account . in the present case ,",
    "if one discretizes the _ master functional equation _ ( [ lf])([l ] ) , hbvm@xmath54 are then obtained , essentially by extending the discrete problem ( [ hbvm_sys ] ) also to the silent stages ( [ hyi ] ) . in order to simplify the exposition ,",
    "we shall use ( [ fy ] ) and introduce the following notation : @xmath68 y_i = \\sigma(t_0+\\tau_ih ) , & & f_i = f(\\sigma(t_0+\\tau_ih ) ) , \\qquad i=1,\\dots , k.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the discrete problem defining the hbvm@xmath54 then becomes , @xmath69    by introducing the vectors @xmath70 and the matrices @xmath71 whose @xmath72th entry are given by @xmath73    we can cast the set of equations ( [ hbvmks ] ) in vector form as @xmath74    with an obvious meaning of @xmath75 . consequently , the method can be regarded as a runge - kutta method with the following butcher tableau : @xmath76    [ ascisse ] we observe that , because of the use of an orthonormal basis , the role of the abscissae @xmath34 and of the silent abscissae @xmath77 is interchangeable , within the set @xmath78 .",
    "this is due to the fact that all the matrices @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 depend on all the abscissae @xmath78 , and not on a subset of them , and they are invariant with respect to the choice of the fundamental abscissae @xmath34 .",
    "in particular , when a gauss distribution of the abscissae @xmath82 is considered , it can be proved that the resulting hbvm@xmath54 method @xcite :    * has order @xmath83 for all @xmath55 ; * is symmetric and perfectly @xmath0-stable ( i.e. , its stability region coincides with the left - half complex plane , @xmath84 @xcite ) ; * reduces to the gauss - legendre method of order @xmath83 , when @xmath85 ; * exactly preserves polynomial hamiltonian functions of degree @xmath86 , provided that @xmath87    additional results and references on hbvms can be found at the _ hbvms homepage _ @xcite .",
    "we are now going to prove a further additional result , related to the matrix appearing in the butcher tableau ( [ rk ] ) , corresponding to hbvm@xmath54 , i.e. , the matrix @xmath88    whose rank is @xmath9 .",

    "[ gauss ] the eigenvalues of the matrix @xmath90 with @xmath91 coincide with those of the matrix in the butcher tableau of the gauss - legendre method of order @xmath83 .",

    "the abscissae @xmath78 have to be the @xmath9 gauss - legendre nodes , so that hbvm@xmath97 reduces to the gauss legendre method of order @xmath83 , as outlined at the end of section  [ hbvms ] .",
    "when @xmath98 , from the orthonormality of the basis , see ( [ orto ] ) , and considering that the quadrature with weights @xmath95 is exact for polynomials of degree ( at least ) @xmath96 , one easily obtains that ( see ( [ oip])([idpo ] ) ) @xmath99    since , for all  @xmath16 ,   and  @xmath100 : @xmath101    by taking into account the result of lemma  [ intleg ] , one then obtains : @xmath102    with the @xmath103 defined according to ( [ xij ] ) .",
    "consequently , one obtains that the columns of @xmath104 constitute a basis of an invariant ( right ) subspace of matrix @xmath0 , so that the eigenvalues of @xmath105 are eigenvalues of @xmath0 . in more detail ,",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath105 are those of @xmath106 ( see ( [ xs ] ) ) and the zero eigenvalue .",
    "then , also in this case , the nonzero eigenvalues of @xmath0 coincide with those of @xmath106 , i.e. , with the eigenvalues of the matrix defining the gauss - legendre method of order @xmath83 .",
    "by using the previous results and notations , now we further elucidate the existing connections between hbvms and runge - kutta collocation methods .",
    "we shall continue to use an orthonormal basis @xmath58 , along which the underlying _ extended collocation _",
    "polynomial @xmath8 is expanded , even though the arguments could be generalized to more general bases , as sketched below . on the other hand",
    ", the distribution of the internal abscissae can be arbitrary .",
    "our starting point is a generic collocation method with @xmath45 stages , defined by the tableau @xmath107    where , for @xmath108 : @xmath109    @xmath110 being the @xmath111th lagrange polynomial of degree @xmath112 defined on the set of abscissae @xmath78 .",

    "@xmath138 essentially makes the gauss method of order @xmath136 `` work '' in a suitable subspace .",
    "it seems like the price paid to achieve such conservation property consists in the lowering of the order of the new method with respect to the original one .",
    "actually this is not true , because a fair comparison would be to relate method  to a collocation method constructed on @xmath9 rather than on @xmath45 stages , since the resulting nonlinear system turns out to have dimension @xmath9 , as shown in @xcite .",
