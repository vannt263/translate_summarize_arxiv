    "theoretically , intermolecular potential method was applied to study the eos of co@xmath0 under dynamic compressions , where the onset of decomposition was reported to be around 30 gpa ( 4500 k , 17 @xmath1/mol ) along the hugoniot @xcite . despite that the predicted eos were in accord with experimental data , the electronic structure , which has been proved to be important in determining the dynamical , electrical , and optical properties of molecular fluids under extreme conditions @xcite , is still lacking due to the intrinsic approximations of this method .    on the other hand , quantum molecular dynamic ( qmd ) simulations , where quantum - mechanical treatments are executed by combining classical molecular dynamics for the ions and density functional theory ( dft ) for electrons ,",

    "is highly recommended to be presented and understood because of the following aspects : ( i ) co@xmath0 undergos dramatic transformations under shock compressions , such as dissociation and recombination of molecules , during which carbonaceous molecules combined with oxygen ( o@xmath0 ) might be produced , and electron spin polarization should be seriously considered at this stage due to the fact that spin - triplet state governs the ground state of oxygen @xcite ; ( ii ) electrical conductivity of molecular fluid , where electronic structure is of dominance , can be greatly influenced by thermo - activated electronic states under extreme conditions ; ( iii ) temperature , which is an important parameter in experimental determination of eos , is usually difficult to be measured because of the uncertainty in determining the optical intensity for ultraviolet part of the spectrum , and qmd simulations are powerful tools to provide predictions .    in the present work ,",
