    "the fano plane , the cycle matroids of the kuratowski graphs , and their duals , are of fundamental importance in the study of binary matroids . the famous excluded - minor characterizations of tutte  @xcite show that the classes of regular , graphic , and cographic matroids are all obtained by taking the binary matroids with no minors in some subset of the family @xmath2 it is natural to consider other classes of binary matroids produced by excluding some subset of this family .",
    "a number of authors have investigated such classes of binary matroids .",
    "we examine the binary matroids with no minor isomorphic to @xmath1 , and completely characterize the internally @xmath0-connected  members of this class .",
    "[ thm2 ] an internally @xmath0-connected  binary matroid has no @xmath1-minor if and only if it is either :    a.   cographic ; b.   isomorphic to a triangular or triadic mbius  matroid ; or , c.   isomorphic to one of  @xmath3 sporadic matroids of rank at most  @xmath4 listed in appendix  [ chp9 ] .    the triangular and triadic mbius  matroids form two infinite families of binary matroids .",
    "each mbius  matroid is a single - element extension of a cographic matroid ; in particular , a single - element extension of the bond matroid of a cubic or quartic mbius  ladder . for every integer @xmath5",
    "there is a unique triangular mbius  matroid of rank  @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath7 , and for every even integer @xmath8 there is a unique triadic mbiusmatroid of rank  @xmath6 , denoted by @xmath9 .",
    "we describe these matroids in detail in chapter  [ chp2 ] .",
    "seymour s decomposition theorem for regular matroids is one of the most fundamental results in matroid theory , and was the first structural decomposition theorem proved for a class of matroids .",
    "the following characterization of the internally @xmath0-connected  regular matroids is an immediate consequence of the decomposition theorem .",
    "[ thm1 ] an internally @xmath0-connected  regular matroid is either graphic , cographic , or isomorphic to a particular sporadic matroid ( @xmath10 ) .    our theorem , and its proof , bears some similarity to seymour s theorem .",
    "just as seymour s theorem leads to a polynomial - time algorithm for deciding whether a binary matroid ( represented by a matrix over @xmath11 ) has a minor isomorphic to @xmath12 or @xmath13 , our characterization leads to a polynomial - time algorithm ( to be discussed in a subsequent article ) for deciding whether a represented binary matroid has an @xmath1-minor .",
    "other authors who have studied families of binary matroids with no minors in some subset of @xmath14 include walton and welsh  @xcite , who examine the characteristic polynomials of matroids in such classes , and kung  @xcite , who has considered the maximum size obtained by a simple rank-@xmath6 matroid in one of these classes .",
    "qin and zhou  @xcite have characterized the internally @xmath0-connected  binary matroids with no minor in @xmath15 . moreover",
    "zhou  @xcite has also characterized the internally @xmath0-connected  binary matroids that have no @xmath1-minor , but which do have an @xmath16-minor .",
    "finally we note that the classic result of hall  @xcite on graphs with no @xmath17-minor leads to a characterization of the internally @xmath0-connected  binary matroids with no minor in @xmath18 , and wagner s  @xcite theorem on the graphs with no @xmath19-minor leads to a characterization of the internally @xmath0-connected  binary matroids with no minor in @xmath20 .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm2 ] is unusual amongst results in matroid theory , in that we rely upon a computer to check certain facts .",
    "all these checks have been carried out using the software package macek , developed by petr hlinn .",
    "in addition we have written software , which does not depend upon macek , to provide us with an independent check of the same facts .",
    "the macek package is available to download , along with supporting documentation .",
    "the current website is http://www.fi.muni.cz/~hlineny/macek .",
    "thus the interested reader is able to download macek and confirm that it verifies our assertions .",
    "points in the proof where a computer check is required are marked by a marginal symbol and a number .",
    "the numbers provide a reference for the website of the second author ( current url : http://www.maths.uwa.edu.au/~gordon ) , which contains a more detailed description of the steps taken to verify each assertion , and the intermediate data produced during that computer check .",
    "we emphasize that none of the computer tests relies upon an exhaustive search of all the matroids of a particular size or rank .",
    "the only tasks a program need perform to verify our checks are : determine whether two binary matroids are isomorphic ; check whether a binary matroid has a particular minor ; and , generate all the single - element extensions and coextensions of a binary matroid . whenever the proof requires a computer check , the text includes a complete description ( independent of any particular piece of software ) of the tasks that we ask the computer to perform .",
    "hence a reader who is able to construct software with the capabilities listed above could provide another verification of our assertions .",
    "the article is organized as follows : in chapter  [ chp3 ] we develop the basic definitions and results we will need to prove theorem  [ thm2 ] . in chapter  [ chp2 ] we introduce the mbius  matroids and consider their properties in detail .    chapter  [ chp4 ] is concerned with showing that a minimal counterexample to theorem  [ thm2 ] can be assumed to be vertically @xmath0-connected .",
    "this chapter depends heavily upon the @xmath21  operation and its dual ; we make extensive use of results proved by oxley , semple , and vertigan  @xcite .",
    "the central idea of chapter  [ chp4 ] is that if a binary matroid @xmath22 with no @xmath1-minor is non - cographic and internally @xmath0-connected  but not vertically @xmath0-connected , then by repeatedly performing @xmath23  operations , we can produce a vertically @xmath0-connected  non - cographic binary matroid @xmath24 with no @xmath1-minor . in lemmas  [ lem9 ] and  [ lem5 ] we show that if @xmath24 obeys theorem  [ thm2 ] , then @xmath22 also satisfies the theorem . from this",
    "it follows that a minimal counterexample to theorem  [ thm2 ] can be assumed to be vertically @xmath0-connected .",
    "the regular matroid @xmath25 was introduced by seymour in the proof of his decomposition theorem .",
    "he shows that @xmath25 contains a @xmath26-separation , and that this @xmath26-separation persists in any regular matroid that contains @xmath25 as a minor . in chapter  [ chp5 ]",
    "we introduce a binary matroid @xmath27 that plays a similar role in our proof .",
    "the matroid @xmath27 is a single - element coextension of @xmath28 , the rank-@xmath0 triangular mbius  matroid .",
    "it contains a four - element circuit - cocircuit , which necessarily induces a @xmath26-separation .",
    "we show that this @xmath26-separation persists in any binary matroid without an @xmath1-minor that has @xmath27 as a minor .",
    "hence no internally @xmath0-connected  binary matroid without an @xmath1-minor can have @xmath27 as a minor . in corollary",
    "[ cor8 ] we show that if @xmath22 is a @xmath26-connected binary matroid without an @xmath1-minor such that @xmath22 has both a @xmath28-minor and a four - element circuit - cocircuit , then @xmath22 has @xmath27 as a minor .",
    "suppose that @xmath22 is a minimal counterexample to theorem  [ thm2 ] .",
    "it follows easily from a result of zhou  @xcite that @xmath22 must have a minor isomorphic to @xmath28 .",
    "hence we deduce that if @xmath24 is a @xmath26-connected minor of @xmath22 , and @xmath24 has a @xmath28-minor , then @xmath24 has no four - element circuit - cocircuit .",
    "this is one of the conditions required to apply the connectivity lemma that we prove in chapter  [ chp6 ] .",
    "the hypotheses of the connectivity result in chapter  [ chp6 ] are that @xmath22 and @xmath29 are simple vertically @xmath0-connected  binary matroids such that @xmath30 and @xmath22 has a proper @xmath29-minor . moreover ,",
    "whenever @xmath24 is a @xmath26-connected minor of @xmath22 with an @xmath29-minor , then @xmath24 has no four - element circuit - cocircuit . under these conditions ,",
    "theorem  [ thm4 ] asserts that @xmath22 has a internally @xmath0-connected  proper minor @xmath31 such that @xmath31 has an @xmath29-minor and @xmath32 .",
    "the case - checking required to complete our proof would be impossible if we had no more information than that provided by theorem  [ thm4 ] .",
    "lemma  [ lem3 ] provides a much more fine - grained analysis .",
    "it shows that there are nine very specific ways in which @xmath31 can be obtained from @xmath22 .    in chapter  [ chp7 ]",
    "we complete the proof of theorem  [ thm2 ] .",
    "our strategy is to assume that @xmath22 is a vertically @xmath0-connected  minimal counterexample to the theorem .",
    "we then apply lemma  [ lem3 ] , and deduce the presence of a non - cographic proper minor @xmath31 of @xmath22 that must necessarily obey theorem  [ thm2 ] . the rest of the proof consists of a case - check to show that the counterexample @xmath22 can not be produced by reversing the nine procedures detailed by lemma  [ lem3 ] and applying them to the mbius  matroids and the @xmath3 sporadic matroids .",
    "thus a counterexample to theorem  [ thm2 ] can not exist .",
    "the first of the three appendices contains a description of the case - checking required to complete the proof that a @xmath26-connected binary matroid with both a @xmath28-minor and a four - element circuit - cocircuit has a @xmath27-minor .",
    "the second appendix describes the sporadic matroids , and the third contains information on the three - element circuits of the sporadic matroids .    in a subsequent article",
    "@xcite we consider various applications of theorem  [ thm2 ] .",
