    "anomalies in the magnetization process , such as plateau , cusp and jump , in low - dimensional magnets have been attracting increasing attention in these years . in this paper",
    ", we investigate the effect of the frustrated interactions on the plateaux and cusps in the magnetization curve of the @xmath1 two - leg ladder .",
    "our hamiltonian , sketched in figure 1 , is described by @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the @xmath1 operator at the @xmath8th site of the @xmath9th ladder ( @xmath10 ) , @xmath11 denotes the magnetic field along the @xmath12 direction , and all the couplings are supposed to be antiferromagnetic unless otherwise noticed .",
    "[ 0.4]).,title=\"fig : \" ]    we focus mainly on the effect of the frustrated interaction @xmath13 on the @xmath2 plateau , where @xmath14 is the magnetization and @xmath3 is the saturation magnetization , although we touch on other topics . in  2 , we investigate the simple two - leg ladder with no frustration .",
    "the effect of the frustrated interaction @xmath13 on the @xmath2 plateau is discussed in  3 .",
    "the last section  4 is devoted to concluding remarks .",
    "in case of the @xmath16 simple ladder , the rung interaction is always relevant . in other words",
    ", infinitesimally small rung interaction brings about the spin gap at @xmath17 .",
    "the situation is quite different for the @xmath2 plateau of the present @xmath1 model . when @xmath18 , the @xmath2 plateau obviously exists , because the problem is reduced to the two - spin problem . on the other hand",
    ", there will be no @xmath2 plateau in the @xmath19 limit , because the ladder is essentially the single chain of @xmath20 spins formed by the rung spin pair .",
    "thus there exists the critical value of @xmath21 .",
    "this quantum phase transition is thought to be of the berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless ( bkt ) type @xcite .",
    "we note that this @xmath15 plateau state is unique ( not degenerate ) from the necessary condition for the plateau @xcite .",
    "it is interesting whether the critical point lies in the antiferromagnetic side ( i. e. , @xmath22 ) or the ferromagnetic side ( @xmath23 ) , when @xmath24 is fixed .",
    "infinitesimally small @xmath25 yields the @xmath2 plateau if @xmath26 , while it does not if @xmath27 .    to estimate the above - mentioned critical point analytically",
    ", we employ the degenerate perturbation theory ( dpt ) @xcite .",
    "hereafter we set @xmath28 ( energy unit ) for convenience and due to the fact that the critical point lies in the antiferromagnetic side , as will be seen later .",
    "let us begin with the strong rung coupling limit @xmath29 . in this limit , around @xmath4",
    ", we can take only two states for the rung states , neglecting other 7 states : the lowest state with @xmath30 and that with @xmath31 .",
    "we can express these states by the @xmath32 and @xmath33 states , respectively , of the psuedo spin @xmath34 .",
    "the lowest order perturbation with respect to @xmath35 leads to the effective hamiltonian @xmath36 the @xmath37 and @xmath15 states of the original @xmath38 system correspond to the @xmath39 and @xmath40 states , respectively , where @xmath41 ( @xmath40 ) denotes the magnetization ( saturation magnetization ) of the @xmath34 system .",
    "it is easy to obtain the field corresponding to @xmath42 by considering the one - spin - down spectrum of @xmath43 as @xmath44 this @xmath45 gives the lower edge of the @xmath2 plateau .",
    "similar dpt can be developed around @xmath5 , resulting in @xmath46 where @xmath47 gives the upper edge of the @xmath2 plateau .",
    "thus , the critical value @xmath48 where the @xmath2 plateau vanishes can be estimated from @xmath49 , resulting in @xmath50 we remark that there is no @xmath2 plateau for the so - called isotropic case @xmath51 .",
    "we have calculated the magnetization curves ( figure 2 ) by use of the density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) method .",
    "the dmrg result is consistent with the ls result @xmath52 , if we consider the pathological nature of the bkt transition .",
    "we can clearly see the @xmath15 plateau @xmath53 , while we can not for @xmath54 .",
    "it is difficult to judge for the @xmath55 case .",
    "this situation is qualitatively consistent with the dpt results , although the critical value is slightly larger than the dpt prediction ( [ eq : j1cdpt ] ) .",
    "this is reasonable because the plateau region will narrowly extend like a beak of a bird on the @xmath56 plane , as was seen in the diamond type spin chain case @xcite .",

    "it is difficult to judge for the @xmath55 case.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the level spectroscopy ( ls ) method @xcite is very powerful in finding the quantum critical point of the bkt and gaussian types .",
    "we have also performed the ls , the details of which will be published elsewhere .",
    "our conclusion is @xmath59 which is consistent with the dmrg result .",
    "we have also performed the non - abelian bosonization approach , finding a qualitatively consistent conclusion with those by the above methods .",
    "details of the ls method and the non - abelian bosonization approach will be published elsewhere .",
    "let us consider the effect of @xmath13 interactions on the @xmath15 plateau problem .",
    "the dpt in the previous section can be easily extended to the case with @xmath13 .",
    "we obtain @xmath60 yielding the critical line @xmath61    [ 0.35 ] and @xmath62.,title=\"fig : \" ]    the magnetization curve for the @xmath63 case calculated by the dmrg method is shown in figure [ fig : j1j2 ] .",
    "there exists the @xmath15 plateau which is not seen in the @xmath54 , @xmath64 case ( no frustration case ) , as shown in figure [ fig : mag - curve ] .",
    "furthermore we can see the @xmath65 and @xmath66 plateaux , which is attributed to the nel ordering of the @xmath34 system , which was first pointed out by our group @xcite .",
    "the nel ordering condition is known from @xmath43 as @xmath67 , from which we obtain @xmath68 for the @xmath65 plateau .",
    "this condition is satisfied for the parameter set of figure [ fig : j1j2 ] .",
    "the nel ordering condition for the @xmath66 plateau is @xmath69 , which explains the fact that the width of the @xmath5 plateau is wider than that of the @xmath65 plateau .",
    "both of the @xmath65 and @xmath66 plateaux require the spontaneous breaking of the translation symmetry as is known from the necessary condition for the plateau @xcite .",
    "we have also employed the ls for this case , finding consistent results with that of the dmrg .",
    "here we shortly touch on the effect of @xmath70 . in the framework of the dpt , the @xmath70 interaction brings about the frustrated next - nearest - neighbor interaction between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , while the @xmath13 interaction does not .",
    "thus , for sufficiently large @xmath70 , the magnetization curve has cusps as found in figure 5 .",
    "these cusps are due to the mechanism proposed by okunishi , hieida and akutsu @xcite .",
    "[ 0.32 ] @xmath64 and @xmath73 .",
    "we can see cusps near @xmath74 and @xmath75.,title=\"fig : \" ]     the condition for the existence of the @xmath65 plateau is @xmath76 from the dpt @xcite",
    ". the width of the plateau may be too narrow to be observed clearly in figure [ fig : cusp ] .",
    "we have discussed the plateaux and cusps in the magnetization curve of the @xmath1 frustrated two - leg ladder by use of the dpt as well as the dmrg .",
    "we have also used the non - abelian bosonization approach and the ls method , although we did not enter into their details .",
    "the results obtained by these methods are consistent with each others .",
    "we remark that the @xmath65 plateau of the present mechanism is possibly related to that observed in organic @xmath1 spin ladder 3,3,5,5-tetrakis(_n - tert_-butylaminxyl)biphenyl ( abbreviated as bip - teno ) @xcite ."
