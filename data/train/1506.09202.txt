    "the generation of small scales , or large velocity gradients , is one of the most striking physical phenomenon of 3-dimensional ( 3d ) turbulent fluid flows , and is responsible for a flux of energy @xmath2 from large to small scales .",
    "remarkably , in the limit of very small viscosity or very large reynolds number , the third moment of the longitudinal velocity difference between two points separated by a distance @xmath3 , @xmath4 , is related to the energy flux by the relation @xmath5 , which is one of the very few exact results in turbulence theory  @xcite . in elementary terms , two points are more likely to be pushed closer together ( repelled ) when their relative energy is large ( small )  @xcite .",
    "this fundamental asymmetry persists all the way down to very small distances so the third moment of the velocity derivative @xmath6 is _ negative _ : @xmath7 .",
    "in fact , available data from experiments using hot - wire anemometry  @xcite and from direct numerical simulations ( dns ) have led to the conclusion that the normalized third moment of @xmath6 , i.e. , the skewness , @xmath8 , is negative and approximately @xmath9 , with at most a weak dependence on the reynolds number  @xcite . in homogeneous isotropic flows , the seminal work of betchov",
    "@xcite shows that the third moment of @xmath6 is related to the generation of small scales in turbulence , through amplification of vorticity by vortex stretching .",
    "because of the existence of an energy flux from large to small scales , turbulence is a non - equilibrium phenomenon , thus intrinsically irreversible .",
    "the possibility to probe turbulence by following the motion of individual particles in both numerical and laboratory high - reynolds - number flows  @xcite , leads to new insights on irreversibility and offers new opportunities for quantitatively understanding turbulence  @xcite .",
    "recently , we observed that the energy differences along particle trajectories present an intriguing asymmetry : kinetic energy grows more slowly than it drops along a trajectory  @xcite . the consequence of this asymmetry is that the third moment of the power @xmath10 is _ negative _ , where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the velocity and acceleration of the fluid ( see @xcite for a related discussion ) .",
    "as a possible explanation , one may expect the pressure gradient , which dominates the fluctuations of the power , to provide an explanation for the negative sign of the third moment of @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "unexpectedly , however , in 3d , the contribution of the pressure gradient to the third moment of power is very small  @xcite .    here",
    ", we provide a physical relation between the negative third moment of @xmath0 and the generation of small scales by turbulence , i.e. , vortex stretching . in the following ,",
    "it is convenient to decompose the power as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are the local and convective parts , respectively .",
    "we find that the magnitude of @xmath16 is much smaller than the magnitudes of its components @xmath17 and @xmath18 , which implies significant cancellation between @xmath19 and @xmath17 . on average ,",
    "the magnitude of @xmath19 is larger than that of @xmath17 .",
    "note however that the cancellation between @xmath17 and @xmath19 does not automatically follow from the well - known cancellation between @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite , since @xmath22 , @xmath19 involve only one component of @xmath23 , @xmath24 .",
    "we demonstrate that the moments of @xmath0 , up to the third order , are dominated by the moments of @xmath19 .",
    "in particular , the third moment @xmath1 has the same sign as @xmath25 .",
    "we show analytically that @xmath25 is a surrogate for vorticity amplification .",
    "this , together with the observation that @xmath26 determines the sign of @xmath1 , leads us to the conclusion that the origin of the negative sign of the third moment @xmath1 comes in fact from small scale generation , thus clearly establishing a relation between the generation of small scales and the observed irreversibility in the flow .",
    "we investigated numerically turbulent flows , obtained by solving directly the navier ",
    "stokes equations : @xmath27 where @xmath28 denotes the eulerian velocity field , @xmath29 is the pressure , @xmath30 is the viscosity , and @xmath31 is a forcing term ; the mass density is arbitrarily set to unity . solving the equations in a simple cubic box of size @xmath32 with periodic boundary conditions allows us to use efficient pseudo - spectral methods .",
    "the forcing term acts at large scales , or equivalently , on fourier modes at low wavenumbers , @xmath33 .",
    "it is adjusted according to a method proposed in  @xcite , in such a way that the injection rate of energy , @xmath34 , remains constant : @xmath35 with @xmath36 . in the code units ,",
    "the energy injection rate @xmath34 has been set to @xmath37 .",
    "note that in stationary turbulent flows , the energy injection rate equals the energy dissipation rate , @xmath38 .",
    "the code is fully dealiased , using the @xmath39-rule method  @xcite .",
    "we have chosen two different resolutions , corresponding to the highest resolved wavenumber of @xmath40 and @xmath41 ( effectively equivalent to @xmath42 and @xmath43 grid points in each spatial direction ) , with the corresponding values of the viscosity @xmath44 and @xmath45 , respectively . with these values ,",
    "the kolmogorov scale @xmath46 is such that the product @xmath47 is very close to @xmath48 in both cases , ensuring adequate spatial resolution .",
    "the corresponding reynolds numbers are @xmath49 and @xmath50 , respectively",
    ".    once expressed in terms of spatial modes , eq .",
    "( [ eq : ns ] ) reduces to a large set of ordinary differential equations , which were integrated using the second - order adams - bashforth scheme .",
    "the time step @xmath51 has been chosen so that the courant number @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the root mean square value of one component of velocity .",
    "we also used additional numerical simulation data at @xmath54 from the turbulence database of the johns hopkins university .",

    "( [ eq : constraint_p_pl ] ) ) , leads to a full description of the second moments of @xmath19 , @xmath17 in terms of @xmath60 only : @xmath64 the values of @xmath60 are measured from the conditional average @xmath61 , eq .  .",

    "to satisfied .",
    "the numerical results are shown in table  [ table : appendb ] .",
    "the relations given by eqs .   to are found to be very well satisfied , with very small errors , thus demonstrating that the proposed parametrization in terms of @xmath65 and @xmath60 provides a very good description of the second moments of @xmath0 .",
    "crucial to the argument relating the third moment @xmath1 to the third moment of @xmath19 is the observation that the conditional averages @xmath68 and @xmath69 are close to @xmath70 .",
    "figure 2b of the main text shows these averages @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which appear as horizontal and vertical straight lines respectively on the scale of the figure .",
    "our argument is then based on identities such as : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the pdf of @xmath17 .",
    "equation   shows that if @xmath75 , then , @xmath76 .",
    "possible deviations from zero of the moments @xmath77 and @xmath78 therefore indicate that the conditional averages @xmath68 and @xmath69 are not exactly zero .",
    "these moments can be readily estimated from the various third moments @xmath79 with @xmath80 shown in table 2 of the main text : @xmath81 and @xmath82 when compared to @xmath25 , the value of @xmath78 is approximately zero ( @xmath83% ) , but @xmath84% .",
    "this points to a departure of @xmath68 from being @xmath70 , which we explore here .",
    "figure  [ fig : cond_p_pl ] shows the conditional averages of @xmath68 for the three direct numerical simulation ( dns ) runs discussed in this article , and also the integrand in eq .  .",
    "for all three cases , the curves differ weakly but consistently from @xmath70 . while for @xmath85 , the values of @xmath68 are very small , they differ noticeably from @xmath70 on the positive @xmath17 side , with an approximately linear dependence on @xmath17 . in order to examine the effect of this deviation of @xmath86 on @xmath87 , we non - dimensionalize the variables @xmath17 and @xmath0 in fig .

    "here we present further information concerning the correlations between @xmath122 and @xmath121 .",
    "the first hint of a correlation between the velocity and strain was provided by fig .  3 of the main text , which showed weak , but noticeable deviations from a uniform distribution for pdfs of the cosines of the angles between the direction of velocity , @xmath110 , and the eigenvectors of strain , especially between @xmath123 and @xmath124 and between @xmath123 and @xmath125 .",

    "figure  [ fig : pdf_ue_i_cond_s ] shows that the value of the average of the cosines of the angles , @xmath134 , conditioned on @xmath135 , depends significantly less on @xmath136 : the variations shown in fig .
