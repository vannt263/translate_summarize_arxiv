    "an important point in the dynamics of open quantum systems is the initial state preparation . due to unavoidable interactions ,",
    "there generally exist initial correlations between a system and its environment .",
    "thus any physical process of preparation of the initial state of the system will affect the state of the environment as well .",
    "the question then arises of how the preparation procedure and initial correlations influence the subsequent evolution of the open system .",
    "different aspects of this question were discussed by many authors ( see , e.g. , refs .",
    "@xcite and references therein ) . of special interest is the decoherence phenomenon ( the environmentally induced destruction of quantum coherence ) .",
    "for instance , decoherence plays a crucial role in the dynamics of two - state systems ( qubits ) which are the elementary carries of quantum information  @xcite .    at first sight",
    "it is natural to expect that initial correlations between an open quantum system and an environment with a huge ( or even infinite ) number of degrees of freedom would increase the decoherence rate .",
    "this is indeed the case for some preparation procedures  @xcite but is not true in general .",
    "we refer to the paper  @xcite , where the authors demonstrated with examples of specific qubit - environment models that for some initial system - environment correlated states , the `` purity '' of the qubit is greater than in the case of initially uncorrelated states . although the results of ref .",
    "@xcite rely on a somewhat artificial assumption that the environment is initially prepared in a pure quantum state , the fact that quantum coherence in open systems can be enhanced due to system - environment correlations seems as itself to deserve thorough studies .",
    "it could provide , for instance , a way for constructing dynamics of qubit registers with interesting and very promising properties .",
    "in this paper we aim to examine in detail the connection between the initial preparation and the qubit dynamics .",
    "in particular , this allows us to establish the conditions for appreciable environment - induced enhancement of quantum coherence in a qubit .",
    "a somewhat unexpected result is that the purity of a qubit state can even increase with time .",
    "the principal difference between our analysis and that presented in ref .",
    "@xcite lies in the interpretation of initial states of the composite ( qubit plus environment ) system . as we have already mentioned , in ref .",
    "@xcite the initial states were taken in the form which could illustrate the role of qubit - environment correlations but , unfortunately , these states are very unlikely to be physically realizable . in the present paper",
    "we consider more realistic preparation procedures based on quantum measurements  @xcite .",

    "the corresponding pairs of lines in fig .",
    "[ plambda ] are therefore just shifted vertically from each other because of the different values of @xmath242 .",

    "figures  [ sbeta ] and [ pbeta ] display the evolution of the qubit purity and entropy at different temperatures but for a fixed value of the coupling constant .     in the ohmic case at different temperatures : @xmath243 ( b and e ) , @xmath177 ( c and f ) , @xmath236 ( d and g ) .",

    "it is seen that lowering of temperature is favourable for purification of the qubit state . to explain this",
    ", it should be remembered that the time evolution of the purity @xmath232 and the entropy @xmath231 is the net result of two processes .",
    "first , there is the enhancement of coherence due to the combined effect of the non - selective preparation measurement and qubit - bath correlations .",
    "second , thermal fluctuations in the bath suppress the coherence effects . at high temperatures , the latter process dominates .",
    "note in this connection that the maximum of the purity shifts to smaller @xmath97 with increasing temperature ( see fig .  [ pbeta ] ) .",
    "in this paper we have examined the properties of the reduced qubit dynamics in cases where the initial state of the composite system ( qubit plus environment ) is prepared through non - selective quantum measurements .",
    "our main result is that for some preparation schemes the interplay of the measurement process and qubit - environment correlations can lead to a significant enhancement of coherence in the qubit during the initial stage of evolution .",
    "the non - trivial feature of this effect is that , in general , a non - selective measurement produces a _",
    "mixed _ state of the composite system .",
    "then the purity of the qubit s state grows while its entropy decreases with time until thermal fluctuations suppress this environmentally induced `` purification '' process .",
    "it deserves to be pointed out that the temperature dependence of the purity growth is determined by several factors .",
    "first , the initial coherences ( i.e. , the off - diagonal elements of the qubit density matrix ) generated by a non - selective measurement decrease dramatically with increasing temperature .",
    "second , the destructive effect of thermal fluctuations in the bath also becomes important just at high temperatures .",
    "but surprisingly , the dynamical enhancement of coherence due to the qubit - bath correlations grows with temperature , so that the maximum of the coherences @xmath182 may be much larger than the initial values @xmath183 ( see sec .",
    "[ seciii ] ) . due to the interplay of the above factors , the resulting purity of the qubit states decreases with temperature , but not so rapidly as one might expect from intuitive considerations .    summarizing ,",
    "if the initial state is prepared by a non - selective measurement , it is possible to achieve the environmentally induced purity growth in a qubit during some time interval by setting the measurement device in a proper way .",
    "this effect may be of interest in view of its connection with problems of measurement - based quantum control in open quantum systems .",
    "we refer , e.g. , to the recent paper  @xcite were the dephasing model ( [ h ] ) was used to study the influence of system - environment correlations on the so - called quantum zeno and anti - zeno effects in repeated _ selective _ measurements on single - qubit and many - qubit systems .    as a final remark",
    "we wish to emphasize that our study of the environmentally induced purity growth does not claim to be complete even on the single - qubit level . here",
    "we will touch briefly on two open questions which deserve further investigation .",
    "first , our analysis was based on the assumption that initial correlations between the qubit and the environment are inherited from the premeasurement equilibrium state due to the presence of the interaction term in the total hamiltonian @xmath244 .",
    "this assumption is adequate in describing many real situations and is commonly accepted in the theory of open quantum systems  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one may imagine a variety of different correlated initial states by replacing @xmath245 in eq .",
    "( [ rho - sb-0 ] ) by some nonequilibrium premeasurement density matrix @xmath246 .",
    "one should note , however , that within such a general formulation of the problem the trace over the bath degrees of freedom in @xmath247 can not be carried out without a detailed information about physically reasonable forms of @xmath246 .",
    "the second important point is that the model ( [ h ] ) describes only the dephasing mechanism of decoherence .",
    "although this mechanism can dominate in real physical systems  @xcite , in general the population decay should be taken into account .",
    "however , it is a challenging problem because in this case the model is no longer exactly solvable .",
    "here we briefly discuss the connection between the non - selective preparation scheme ( [ omega - non ] ) [ see also eqs .",
    "( [ theta - phi-2 ] ) ] and selective measurements .    using the explicit expressions for the @xmath35-operators , the initial density matrix ( [ rho - sb-0 ] ) of the composite system",
    "is written as @xmath248 with the bath density matrix @xmath249 formula ( [ a : init - non ] ) shows that after a non - selective measurement of this type , the qubit is prepared in a pure state @xmath162 .",
    "note also that the qubit and the bath are completely uncoupled since the bath state does not depend on the qubit state , and vice versa .",
    "although the bath density matrix ( [ a : b - init-1 ] ) formally depends on the basis state @xmath55 determining the effects @xmath250 in eqs .",
    "( [ omega - non ] ) , it is easy to see that @xmath251 in fact is independent of @xmath55 . indeed , since the states @xmath252 and @xmath47 form an orthonormal basis , eq .",
    "( [ a : b - init-1 ] ) may be rewritten as @xmath253 .",
    "if so , the trace can now be calculated with any other orthonormal basis .",
    "in particular , it can be done with the canonical states ( [ qbit - can - bas ] ) , so that the initial bath density matrix takes a universal form @xmath254    let us now assume that the qubit is initially prepared in some pure state @xmath255 through a _ selective _ measurement .",
    "then the initial state of the composite system is given by formula ( [ rho - sb - selec ] ) or , what is the same , by @xmath256 with the initial density matrix of the bath @xmath257 in this case the bath carries information on the qubit state since its density matrix depends on @xmath255 through the interaction term in the hamiltonian .",
    "consequently , the product ( [ a : init - sel ] ) should be interpreted as a _ correlated _ state of the composite system  @xcite . for the dephasing model ( [ h ] ) , the bath density matrix ( [ a : b - init - sel ] ) can be written in a more transparent form . to do this",
    ", we note that the equilibrium density matrix @xmath5 of the composite system is diagonal with respect to the canonical qubit states ( [ qbit - can - bas ] ) .",
    "then , writing @xmath9 as a decomposition @xmath258 , we obtain for the density matrix ( [ a : b - init - sel ] ) : @xmath259 since , in general , the bath density matrices ( [ a : b - init - can ] ) and ( [ a : b - init - sel ] ) differ from each other , the time evolution of the composite system depends on the type of the preparation measurement .",
    "suppose , however , that the qubit is prepared selectively in a pure state @xmath255 with equal populations of the canonical basis states , i.e. , with @xmath260 .",
    "in this case we have @xmath261 , so that the density matrices ( [ a : b - init - can ] ) and ( [ a : b - sel - expl ] ) coincide .",
    "this is the reason why the decoherence dynamics for the non - selective measurement scheme ( [ omega - non ] ) is identical to the decoherence dynamics for a selective measurement with @xmath193 .",
