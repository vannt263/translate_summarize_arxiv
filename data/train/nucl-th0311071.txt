    "an old challenge of hypernuclear decay studies has been to secure the `` elusive '' theoretical explanation of the large experimental values of the ratio between the neutron and proton  induced non  mesonic decay rates , @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "indeed , the calculations underestimate the data for all considered hypernuclei . moreover , in the experiments performed until now it has not been possible to distinguish between nucleons produced by the one  body induced channel , @xmath2 , and the two  body induced mechanism , @xmath8 , which is expected to be non  negligible and thus important for the determination of @xmath5 .    because of its strong tensor component , the one  pion  exchange ( ope ) model with the @xmath9 isospin rule supplies very small ratios , typically in the interval @xmath10 . on the contrary ,",
    "the ope description can reproduce the total non  mesonic decay rates observed for light and medium hypernuclei .",
    "other interaction mechanisms might then be necessary to correct for the overestimation of @xmath11 and the underestimation of @xmath12 characteristic of the ope .",
    "those which have been studied extensively in the literature are the following ones : i ) the inclusion in the @xmath13 transition potential of mesons heavier than the pion ( also including the exchange of correlated or uncorrelated two  pions ) @xcite ; ii ) the inclusion of interaction terms that explicitly violate the @xmath9 rule @xcite ; iii ) the inclusion of the two  body induced decay mechanism @xcite and iv ) the description of the short range @xmath2 transition in terms of quark degrees of freedom @xcite , which automatically introduces @xmath14 contributions .",
    "recent progress has been made on the subject .",
    "+ ( i ) on the one hand , a few calculations @xcite with @xmath15 transition potentials including heavy  meson  exchange and/or direct quark contributions obtained ratios more in agreement with data , without providing , nevertheless , an explanation of the origin of the puzzle @xcite .",
    "in particular , these calculations found a reduction of the proton  induced decay width due to the opposite sign of the tensor component of @xmath16exchange with respect to the one for @xmath17exchange .",
    "moreover , the parity violating @xmath18 transition , which contributes to both the @xmath19 and @xmath20induced processes , is considerably enhanced by @xmath16exchange and direct quark mechanisms and tends to increase @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "very recently , the @xmath2 interaction has been studied within an effective field theory framework@xcite .",
    "the decay of @xmath21 and @xmath20shell hypernuclei was approached following the same formalism as in refs .",
    "@xcite , but the weak transition was described in terms of ope , one  kaon  exchange and @xmath22 four  fermion contact terms .",
    "the results obtained in ref .",

    "@xcite to evaluate the single",
    " nucleon energy spectra from non  mesonic decay has been detected and corrected in ref .",
    "it consisted in the underestimation , by a factor ten , of the nucleon ",
    "nucleon collision probabilities entering the intranuclear cascade calculation .",
    "the correction of such an error leads to quite different spectral shapes and made it possible to reproduce old experimental data for @xmath23c @xcite even with a vanishing value of @xmath5 ( which is a free parameter in the polarization propagator model of refs .",
    "however , when compared with the recent proton energy spectra measured by kek ",

    "@xcite we discussed some results of an evaluation of nucleon  nucleon coincidence distribution in the non  mesonic weak decay of @xmath3 and @xmath23c hypernuclei .",
    "the calculations were performed by combining a one  meson  exchange model describing one  nucleon induced weak decays in finite nuclei with an intranuclear cascade code taking into account the nucleon final state interactions .",
    "the two  nucleon induced channel was also taken into account , treating the nuclear finite size effects by means of a local density approximation scheme .    in the present paper",
    "we discuss the nucleon correlation observables in a more systematic way . in order to stress the importance of the coincidence analysis in connection with the determination of @xmath5",
    ", we also discuss single  nucleon distributions . in principle , the correlation observables permit a _ cleaner _ extraction of @xmath5 from data than single  nucleon observables .",
    "this is due to the elimination of interference terms between @xmath19 and @xmath20induced decays @xcite , which are unavoidable in experimental data and can not be taken into account by the monte carlo methods usually employed to simulate the nucleon propagation through the residual nucleus .",
    "we also perform a weak interaction model independent analysis to extract an estimate for @xmath5 using preliminary results from kek @xcite on two  nucleon angular and energy correlations .",

    "as explained in the following section , the intranuclear cascade code allows then the primary nucleons to change energy , direction and charge , exciting other secondary nucleons that are also followed as they move through the nucleus .",
    "note that by considering the primary nucleons as emerging from the same point @xmath70 in space , we have implicitly assumed that the weak transition proceeds as a point interaction .",
    "this is implied by the shape of the regularized potentials of the model of refs .",

    "the corresponding decay rates for @xmath3 and @xmath4 are listed in table  [ gammas ] ( omea and omef ) together with the one  pion  exchange predictions ( ope ) .",
    "the differential and total decay rates for the two  nucleon induced process , @xmath88 , are calculated with the polarization propagator method in local density approximation ( lda ) of refs .",
    "in such a calculation , the simple ope mechanism , supplemented by strong @xmath47 and @xmath58 short range correlations ( given in terms of phenomenological landau functions ) described the weak transition process .",
    "the two  nucleon induced differential decay width @xmath89 is obtained from the two  particle two  hole ( 2p2h ) contributions to the pion self  energy . as explained in ref .",
    "@xcite , these contributions are derived in a phenomenological way from a fit to pionic atoms , conveniently modified by the lorentz ",
    "lorenz correction and extended to all kinematical regions using the appropriate phase  space .",
    "the intranuclear cascade code then follows the fate of the two nucleons excited by these 2p2h components , as well as that of the third nucleon emitted at the @xmath90 vertex , as they move through the nucleus .    in the present calculation ,",
    "the distributions of the weak decay nucleons and the value of @xmath91 have been properly scaled to maintain the ratio @xmath92 unchanged : we then use @xmath93 for @xmath94he and @xmath95 for @xmath23c .",

    "each monte carlo event will then end with a certain number of nucleons which leave the nucleus along defined directions and with defined energies .",
    "one can then select the outgoing nucleons and store them in different ways , as we shall do in the discussion of section  [ res ] .",
    "we are aware of the fact that accounting for nucleon final state interactions effects in light residual nuclei ( as those required to treat @xmath94he ) through monte carlo techniques is questionable . however , realistic calculations for few ",
    "body scattering states have been performed up to 3 nucleons only ( see for instance ref .",
    "@xcite ) . for the hypernuclear",
    "non  mesonic decay problem , only the case of @xmath105h has been treated exactly @xcite .",
    "although one might attempt three  cluster type calculations , this goes beyond the scope of the present work . for this reason ,",
    "the results we present for @xmath94he should be considered less realistic than the corresponding ones for @xmath23c .",
    "in this section we discuss the reason why multi  nucleon coincidence studies should be preferred over single ",
    "nucleon analyses when the purpose is the determination of @xmath5 .",
    "the argument for this explanation is based on the elimination of quantum mechanical _ interferences _ between @xmath19 and @xmath20stimulated weak decays @xcite .",
    "let us first note that the nucleons originating from @xmath19 and @xmath20induced processes are added _ incoherently _",
    "( i.e. , classically ) in our intranuclear cascade calculation ( for the moment we are then neglecting an analogous effect due to the two  nucleon stimulated decay channel ) .",
    "however , for particular kinematics of the detected nucleons ( for instance at low kinetic energies ) , an in principle possible quantum  mechanical interference effect between @xmath19 and @xmath20induced channels should inevitably affect the observed distributions .",
    "therefore , extracting the ratio @xmath5 from experimental data with the help of a classical intranuclear cascade calculation may not be a clean task .    to clarify better the issue ,",
    "let us consider for instance an experiment ( such as the majority of the experiments performed up to now ) measuring _ single  proton _ kinetic energy spectra .",
    "the relevant quantity is then the number of outgoing protons observed as a function of the kinetic energy @xmath106 .",
    "schematically , this observable can be written as : @xmath107 where @xmath108 represents a many  nucleon final state with a proton whose kinetic energy is @xmath106 .",
    "moreover , in eq .",
    "( [ interf ] ) the action of the weak decay operator @xmath109 produced the superposition : @xmath110 here @xmath111 ( @xmath112 ) is a state with a @xmath113 ( @xmath114 ) primary pair moving inside a residual nucleus @xmath41 ( @xmath115 ) .",
    "note that in the present schematic picture : @xmath116 and @xmath117 .",
    "since both transition amplitudes entering the last equality of eq .",
    "( [ interf ] ) are in general non  vanishing , interference terms between @xmath19 and @xmath20induced decays are expected to contribute to @xmath118 .",
    "an amplitude @xmath119 different from zero means that , due to nucleon final state interactions ( fsi ) , a secondary proton has a non  vanishing probability to emerge from the nucleus with kinetic energy @xmath106 even if the weak process was @xmath19induced ( i.e. , without primary protons ) .",
    "while for high kinetic energies ( say for @xmath120 mev ) this amplitude is expected to be almost vanishing , as long as @xmath106 decreases its contribution could produce an important interference effect ( see the results discussed in section  [ res - sing ] ) .",
    "an interference  free observation would imply the measurement of all the quantum numbers of the final nucleons and residual nucleus . while this is an impossible experiment , what is certain is that the magnitude of the interference can be reduced if one measures in a more accurate way the final state .",
    "for this reason , two ",
    "nucleon coincidence observables are expected to be less affected by interferences than single ",
    "nucleon ones and thus more reliable for determining @xmath5 .",
    "if we consider the detection of the kinetic energy _ correlation _ of a @xmath114 pair emitted nearly back  to  back ( say with @xmath121 ) : @xmath122 ) , especially when particular energy cuts are considered .    to see this more explicitly ,",
    "let us rewrite eqs .",

    "the numerical results discussed in sections  [ res - sing ] and [ res - coin ] confirm this expectation .",
    "the same reasoning must be applied and the previous equations changed accordingly once the two  nucleon induced decay mechanism is taken into account .",
    "note , however , that our discussion in this section have neglected the effect of the phase differences @xmath137 and @xmath138 , which can not be evaluated theoretically . a quite indirect estimate of these phases ( and then of the real interference effects ) can be obtained through the comparison of our calculated spectra ( in which interference is not taken into account ) with the experimental ones ( which can be affected by interferences ) .",

    "[ s2 ] we show the proton kinetic energy spectra corresponding to the decay of @xmath94he and @xmath23c , respectively . note the particular normalizations of the curves presented in this and in the following figures .",
    "the dashed curves correspond to the distributions of the one  nucleon induced primary protons : they have been obtained through intranuclear cascade calculations in which the one  nucleon stimulated weak decay nucleons move under the effect of the nuclear local potential , @xmath139 , without colliding with the nucleons of the medium .",

    "the model omea supplies similar results both for the proton and neutron spectra .",
    "while the primary proton distributions are very similar for the two hypernuclei ( the one for @xmath23c is slightly broader ) , the full calculations clearly show that , as expected , fsi have a bigger effect for the heavier system . for @xmath23c ,",

    "this is due to fsi , which leads to a large amount of pairs ( @xmath186% of the total ) in which at least one nucleon has kinetic energy below @xmath185 mev .    in fig .",
