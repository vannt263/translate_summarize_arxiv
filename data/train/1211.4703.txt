    "fluctuations of conserved charges reflect the critical properties of a system .",
    "in particular , in a strongly interacting medium , fluctuations of the net baryon number and of the electric charge are valuable probes of the qcd phase transition @xcite .",
    "such fluctuations may provide a signature for the conjectured chiral critical point @xcite , as well as for the residual criticality of the underlying @xmath1 transition @xcite , expected in qcd at small densities in the limit of massless @xmath2 and @xmath3 quarks @xcite .",
    "since fluctuations of conserved charges are experimentally accessible through measurements of their multiplicity distributions , they have been suggested as probes of the proximity of the chiral crossover to the freeze - out line in heavy - ion collisions @xcite .",
    "a particular role has been attributed to higher order cumulants , which exhibit an enhanced sensitivity to criticality with increasing order @xcite . in particular , the sixth- and higher - order cumulants of the net baryon number and of the electric charge vary rapidly in the transition region already at vanishing baryon chemical potential . in the chiral limit , i.e , for vanishing pion mass , @xmath1 scaling implies that e.g. the six order cumulant diverges to @xmath4 or @xmath5 when the critical temperature is approached from below or above , respectively . for a small non - zero pion mass ,",
    "the divergence is replaced by a rapid temperature dependence , resulting in a change of the sign of the cumulants close to the chiral crossover transition @xcite .",
    "consequently , the data on charge fluctuations in high - energy heavy ion collisions may provide experimental evidence for the chiral transition of qcd @xcite .",
    "first measurements of the multiplicity distribution and corresponding cumulants of the net baryon number , more precisely the net proton number , have been obtained in heavy - ion collisions at rhic by the star collaboration @xcite .",
    "the data are , at least on a qualitative level , consistent with the residual criticality , owing to the underlying chiral phase transition .",
    "the final conclusion , however , requires additional studies of non - critical effects such as e.g. volume fluctuations  @xcite , acceptance corrections  @xcite , or an exact baryon number conservation  @xcite .",
    "cumulants of conserved charges have also been studied theoretically . at small chemical potential @xmath6 ,",
    "they have been computed within lattice qcd  @xcite , while at large @xmath7 , their properties have been explored within effective chiral models  @xcite , which share the global symmetries of qcd .    in statistical physics , the @xmath8-th order cumulant @xmath9 of a conserved charge @xmath10",

    "the @xmath8-th moment @xmath16 is linked to the net charge probability distribution @xmath17    cumulants of the net charge can exhibit singularities near the phase transition . thus , due to criticality , the corresponding probability distribution should have the characteristic shape governed by the universal properties of this transition .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to explore the qualitative features of the probability distribution of the net baryon number near the chiral phase transition and their relation to the cumulants .",
    "such studies are not only of theoretical , but also of phenomenological interest . in heavy ion collisions the probability distribution of conserved charges and corresponding cumulants",
    "are measured to verify the chiral phase transition or its remnant . in the absence of criticality ,",
    "different moments of conserved charges , as well as particle multiplicities , are consistent with predictions of the hadron resonance gas model .",
    "the probability distribution of the net baryon number is then governed by the skellam distribution  @xcite .",
    "thus , it is desirable to verify how the critical fluctuations lead to deviations from the skellam distribution .    in this paper",
    "we explore the influence of the chiral phase transition on the probability distribution in the framework of the landau theory of phase transitions .",
    "we construct the thermodynamic potential in such a way , that its regular part results in the skellam distribution of the net charge .",
    "the singular part is modeled within the landau theory , where the coefficients of the polynomial potential are parametrized , so as to reproduce the mean - field , @xmath1 and @xmath0 scaling behaviors of the cumulants of the net charge .",
    "we quantify the modification of the skellam distribution in the presence of the phase transition .",
    "we show that the structure of the probability distribution changes , dependently on the values of the critical exponents . in this article",
    ", we consider not only expected @xmath1 universality class , for simulating chiral qcd , but also @xmath0 , because this possibility has not been reliably ruled out yet  @xcite .",
    "comparison with the @xmath0 universality class will also help us to demonstrate significant properties of the @xmath1 criticality on the level of the net charge probability distribution .",
    "we consider a system in the chiral limit in which the critical behavior is most prominent , and an analytical treatment of the mean field model is feasible .",
    "the effects of an explicit breaking of the chiral symmetry on the probability distribution in the @xmath1 universality class were recently discussed in ref .",

    "<S> we discuss properties of the net baryon number probability distribution near the chiral phase transition to explore the effect of critical fluctuations . </S>",
    "<S> our studies are performed within landau theory , where the coefficients of the polynomial potential are parametrized , so as to reproduce the mean - field ( mf ) , the @xmath0 and @xmath1 scaling behaviors of the cumulants of the net baryon number . </S>",
    "<S> we show , that in the critical region , the structure of the probability distribution changes , dependently on values of the critical exponents . in the mf approach , as well as in the @xmath0 universality class , the contribution of the singular part of the thermodynamic potential tends to broaden the distribution . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , in the model with @xmath1 scaling , the contribution of the singular part results in a narrower net baryon number probability distribution with a wide tail . </S>"
