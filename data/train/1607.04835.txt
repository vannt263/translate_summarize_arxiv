    "the aubry - andr ' e - harper ( aah ) model has been extensively used as a quasiperiodic model to study the phase transition between extended , critical and localized phases theoretically @xcite . with",
    "the realization of aah model in photonic crystals @xcite and ultracold atoms @xcite , this model is gaining more and more attention in recent years .",
    "the abundant phenomena revealed by the aah model make it an ideal test field for topological phases and the transitions between them both in the incommensurate and commensurate cases @xcite .",
    "when the lattice is incommensurate , the system will go through a transition from extended phase to localized phase due to the disordered on - site potential @xcite . while if the lattice is commensurate , the aah model can be used to explore emerging topological states of matter .",
    "besides , quantum many - body localization phenomena are also widely explored in this model @xcite . recently , the connection between aah model , one - dimensional kitaev chain @xcite , and topological superconductivity are investigated . in @xcite , a generalized aah model which has modulations both in the on - site potentials and the hopping amplitudes between the neighbouring lattice sites are discussed and the topological states are attributed to the topological properties of the one - dimensional majorana chain .",
    "this model is also connected to the su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh ) @xcite model when the lattice is commensurate . in @xcite , the phase diagram of a non - abelian aah model with p - wave superfluidity",
    "is discussed and the phase transition from metallic phase to insulator phase are checked .",
    "however , most aah models explored before have only modulations in the on - site potential or do not include the superconducting pairing , thus limits the usage of these models . if we introduce superconducting pairing into the generalized aah models discussed in @xcite , more interesting phenomena can be expected . with p - wave superconducting pairing and modulations in the model",
    ", there would be both ssh - like and kitaev - like topologically notrivial phases , and thus the so - called electron fractionalization to the majorana fermions can be realized , as discussed in @xcite .    in this paper , we consider a generalized aah model with superconducting pairing potential .",
    "both the hopping amplitudes between the nearest neighbouring lattice sites and the on - site potentials are modulated by a cosine function which has periodicity of @xmath0 .",
    "when @xmath3 is irrational , the lattice is incommensurate , we find that the system will go through a phase transition from the extended states to localized states when the disordered on - site potential increases beyond some critical value .",
    "this critical value as well as the critical region of the system will be significantly reduced due to the modulation in the hopping amplitude and thus makes the system much easier to be localized . on the other hand , in the commensurate lattice when @xmath3 is rational , this model shows different topological phases as we tune the system parameters .",
    "we mainly discuss the case with @xmath4 and find that there are three phases presented in the system : su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh)-like trivial phase , ssh - like topological phase and kitaev - like topological phase . by calculating the topological numbers of the system , we present the phase diagrams and phase boundaries for these phases .",
    "this generalized aah model provides us a unified framework for the study of phase transitions between extended states and anderson localization , or the transitions between different topological phases .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] , we introduce the generalized aah model and write down the hamiltonian",
    ". then we consider the incommensurate case in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] , where we will discuss the phase transition from extended phase to localized phase and especially the influences of the modulations in hopping amplitude on this transition . in sec .",
    "[ sec4 ] , we check the commensurate lattice with @xmath4 and investigate those different phases presented in this system . the last section ( sec . [ sec5 ] )",
    "is dedicated to a brief summary .",
    "the hamiltonian of the generalized 1d aubry - andr ' e - harper model we consider in this paper is described by the following hamiltonian    @xmath5\\ ] ]    where @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the creation ( annihilation ) operator at site @xmath8 , @xmath9 is the on - site potential , @xmath10 $ ] is the hopping amplitude between the nearest neighbouring lattice sites and @xmath11 is the superconducting pairing gap which is taken to be real .",
    "this one - dimensional chain has @xmath12 sites and both the on - site potential and the hopping amplitude are modulated by a cosine function with periodicity @xmath0 but with phase factor @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "if @xmath15 , this model will reduce to the generalized aah model introduced in @xcite , which covers both the diagonal and off - diagonal aah model .",
    "if @xmath16 , then the hamiltonian is the same as the 1d kitaev chain with on - site potential modulations which are investigated in detail in @xcite .",
    "it has been predicted that if @xmath3 is irrational , the kitaev model @xmath17 or the diagonal aah model @xmath18 will go through a localization transition where all extended states become localized as @xmath19 is increased beyond some critical value .",
    "however , if @xmath3 is rational , it is known that there is no such phase transition in these two models . for simplicity",
    ", we will set @xmath20 in this paper but we emphasize that all the results get in this paper can also be extended to the @xmath21 case .    by introducing majorana operators @xmath22 , the hamiltonian could be rewritten as    @xmath23    thus the system can be taken as two 1d majorana chains coupled by potential @xmath24 and we may expect that there will be different topological phases depends on whether the majorana fermions at the ends of the majorana chains are paired or not .",
    "the phase transition from extended state to localized state could also be expected according to previous works on the quasiperiodic 1d kitaev chain @xcite . in the following",
    ", we will discuss the properties of this generalized aah model both in the incommensurate case and the commensurate case .",
    "when @xmath3 is irrational , the model system becomes quasiperiodic . since the model is similar to a 1d kitaev model with modulated on - site potentials which shows an anderson localization transition when @xmath19 becomes large enough ( @xmath25 ) , we may expect that the same transition would also show up in our system .",
    "we take @xmath26 as an example but the results can also be generalized to other incommensurate situations .",
    "the hamiltonian can be diagonalized by using the bogoliubov - dgennes ( bdg ) transformation @xcite : @xmath27,\\ ] ] here @xmath28 and @xmath29 are chosen real and @xmath30 is the energy band index .",
    "then the wave function of the hamiltonian is @xmath31 | 0 \\rangle.\\ ] ] from the schrdinger equation @xmath32 , we have    @xmath33    by representing the wave function as @xmath34^t,\\ ] ] the hamiltonian can be written as a @xmath35 matrix : @xmath36    where @xmath37 @xmath38 and @xmath39 here we have assumed periodic boundary condition which implies that @xmath40 .",
    "this is legitimate when @xmath12 is large enough since the irrational number @xmath3 can be approximated by rational numbers @xcite . from this hamiltonian",
    ", we can get @xmath28 and @xmath29 and thus the wave function of the system .    in order to investigate the phase transition of this incommensurate 1d chain , we need to calculate the inverse participation ratio ( ipr ) which for a normalized wave function @xmath41 is defined as @xmath42 .",
    "the ipr measures the inverse of the number of occupied lattice sites and is a very useful quantity in characterizing the localization transitions of quasiperiodic systems .",
    "we further define the mean inverse participation ratio ( mipr ) as @xmath43 .",
    "mipr is close to zero for extended states of the system , however , it will tend to a finite value of @xmath44 for localized states .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows the variation of the mipr as the parameter of the system changes . throughout this paper",
    ", we take @xmath45 as the energy unit . other parameters in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] are @xmath46 , @xmath47 and the number of lattice sites @xmath48 .",
    "the solid blue dots in fig.[fig1a ] corresponds to the usual 1d kitaev chain with quasiperiodic disordered on - site potential ( @xmath49 ) .",
    "the phase transition takes place when @xmath50 , as is reported in earlier work @xcite .",
    "there is a plateau in the mipr before it increases sharply when @xmath16 , which corresponds to the critical phase before the system transiting into the localized phase , which is discussed in @xcite . if @xmath51 becomes nonzero and gets stronger , as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] , the critical value of the phase transition @xmath52 is reduced and the critical region will disappear gradually . it becomes more significant when @xmath51 is close to the value of @xmath53 , as shown by the triangular green dots and the empty purple dots in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] , where the mipr become finite even when @xmath19 is zero .",
    "this is understandable since as @xmath51 increases , especially when it reaches the strength of @xmath53 , the modulation in the hopping amplitude will become stronger and stronger , the coupling strength between some lattice sites then will be weakened and the system thus can be localized more easily and more quickly . in fig . [ fig1b ] , we present the evolution of the mipr as a function of @xmath51 with different @xmath19 . from this figure , we can see that when @xmath54 , the mipr will increase from zero to a finite though small value , which means that even without the disorders coming from the on - site potentials , the modulation in the hopping amplitude alone can also influence the extended state of the system . when @xmath55 , it is clear that the mipr increases sharply when @xmath51 is close to @xmath56 and reaches to a maximum , then drops again when @xmath51 becomes stronger .",
    "this signifies that the system is more likely to be localized when the hopping amplitudes are also modulated , which is consistent with the results we get in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] .    so due to the modulation in the hopping amplitude between the nearest neighbouring lattice sites , we find that the incommensurate generalized aah model with p - wave superconducting pairing is easier to be localized when tuning the disordered on - site potential .",
    "the critical value of the potential beyond which the phase transition happens is significantly reduced especially when the modulation in the hopping amplitude is strong .",
    "these results can also be generalized to situations with other irrational @xmath3 values .",
    "when @xmath3 is rational , the lattice is commensurate .",
    "it is well known that the system will not undergo a localization transition as that in the incommensurate case . in this section",
    ", we mainly discuss the @xmath4 case .",
    "the generalized aah model with p - wave superconducting pairing in this case can be tuned between different topological phases including the su - schrieffer - heeger - like ( ssh - like ) topological phase and the kitaev - like topological phase . when @xmath4 , the hamiltonian in eq .",

    "it is reduced to the ssh model when @xmath59 and to the 1d kitaev model when @xmath16 except that the chemical potential is positive or negative alternatively . since both ssh - like and kitaev - like model",
    "are included in this generalized system , we may expect that with appropriate system parameters , different topological phases would show up . to verify this",
    "we can check the energy spectrum of the system , which can be reached by diagonalizing the hamiltonian rewritten in the majorana fermions representation ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq2 ] ) ) .     with different on - site chemical potential @xmath19 and different site numbers .",
    "in ( a ) and ( b ) , the sites number is chosen to be even , @xmath60 , while in ( c ) and ( d ) , it is chosen to be odd , @xmath61 .",
    "other parameters are @xmath62,@xmath46.,width=297 ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , we present the spectra of the system with even site number ( @xmath60 ) and odd site number ( @xmath61 ) . from fig . [ fig2]a , we can see that there are gapped topologically trivial regime and nontrivial regime with zero energy modes .",
    "however , comparing with fig .",
    "[ fig2]b , it is clear that when @xmath19 becomes nonzero , part of the zero modes in the topologically nontrivial regime split into two non - zero energy modes but the rest of the zero modes remain unchanged . more interestingly , when the site number is odd , there are also zero modes in the trivial regime when site number is even and those zero modes also split when @xmath19 becomes nonzero ( see fig . [ fig2]c and [ fig2]d ) .",
    "this even - odd effect in the energy spectrum is a feature of ssh model .",
    "the regime with zero energy modes which will not split when @xmath19 is finite is the kitaev topological regime .",
    "so there are three phases in this generalized system : ssh - like trivial phase , ssh - like topological phase and kiatev - like topological phase . in the ssh - like topological phase , there will be one dirac fermion at each end of the chain , while in the kitaev - like topological phase , there will be one majorana fermion at each end of the chain .",
    "the zero energy modes originate from the particle - hole symmetry which has two sources : in the ssh - like phase , it is the sublattice symmetry ( when @xmath54 ) while in the kitaev - like phase , it is the superconductivity . as the superconducting pairing strength becomes stronger , the superconductivity will dominate and there will be no ssh - like phase in the system .",
    "[ fig3 ] shows the energy spectra of the system with @xmath63 and @xmath64 both in the even and odd site number situations .",
    "when @xmath65 , there is only a very small region which shows even - odd effect , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig3]a and [ fig3]b . when @xmath11 becomes larger , there are always zero modes as long as the system is in the topological nontrivial phase ( fig .",
    "[ fig3]c and [ fig3]d ) .",
    "so the kitaev - like phase dominates and the ssh - like phase disappears . as the parameters change , there would be phenomenon of electron fractionization to the majorana fermions @xcite . in order to characterize these different topological phases and determine the phase boundary , we need to calculate the topological numbers .     with different on - site chemical potential @xmath19 and different site numbers . in ( a ) and ( b ) , @xmath65",

    "if @xmath16 , then the spectrum is reduced to @xmath79 which is similar to the kitaev model spectrum .",
    "the difference here is that the system is topological for @xmath80 and trivial for @xmath81 .",
    "however , the spectrum for a usual kitaev model is @xmath82 , where the system is topological for @xmath83 and trivial for @xmath84 . in order to make further investigations about the topological phases of the commensurate lattice , we need to check the topological quantum numbers of the system with different parameters .    following the discussions in @xcite , we find that the topological class of our model is also bdi and we can characterize our system by the @xmath85 index .",
    "now we calculate the topological numbers of the system .",

    "the topological number @xmath88 can be interpreted as the number of majorana fermion pair at the ends of the chain .",

    "<S> both the hopping amplitudes between the nearest neighbouring lattice sites and the on - site potentials in this system are modulated by a cosine function with periodicity of @xmath0 . in the incommensurate case ( @xmath1 ) , due to the modulations on the hopping amplitudes , the critical region of this quasiperiodic system </S>",
    "<S> is significantly reduced and the system becomes more easily to be turned from extended states to localized states . in the commensurate case ( @xmath2 ) , </S>",
    "<S> we find that this model shows three different phases when we tune the system parameters : su - schrieffer - heeger ( ssh)-like trivial , ssh - like topological and kitaev - like topological phase . </S>",
    "<S> the phase diagrams and the topological quantum numbers for these phases are presented in this work . </S>",
    "<S> this generalized aah model combined with superconducting pairing provides us a unified framework to discuss the phase transitions from topological phase to anderson localized phase and the transitions between different topological phases . </S>"
