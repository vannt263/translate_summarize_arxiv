    "in this section we explicitly give the circuits simulating the magnetization of a @xmath31-qubit spin chain using @xmath16 qubits .",
    "we measure the magnetization of the spin chain at 12 equidistantly distributed values of @xmath32 . in particular , we choose @xmath33 , as in @xcite .",
    "we also choose the parameters of the adiabatic evolution , @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "see main text for an explanation of these parameters . as explained in the main text ,",
    "we compute the unitary @xmath36 performing the whole adiabatic evolution and decompose this unitary into the available gates set , as a step - wise implementation of the adiabatic evolution is not possible at the moment due to the current limit in circuit depth .",
    "we entangle qubit 2 with an auxiliary qubit , qubit 3 , which is discarded afterwards in order to prepare @xmath37 on qubit 2 . in each circuit",
    "we measure qubit 1 in order to obtain the magnetization @xmath38 .",
    "the explicit circuits for each value @xmath32 are given in figure [ fig : cheatingcircuits ] .",
    "in the following , we argue that with the current version of the ibm quantum computer it seems unfeasible to run the compressed simulation of the ising spin chain using three or more qubits and hence , simulating a eight or more - qubit spin chain .",
    "nevertheless , we show that the computation will become possible once several improvements that ibm announced are implemented .    at the moment , performing the computation using three or more qubits seems not possible due to the restriction in circuit depth , the limited gate set , and the fact that gates can not be implemented probabilistically .",
    "we exemplarily show , that even preparing the initial state @xmath39 is a difficult task . to obtain the initial state , two of the qubits have to be prepared in a completely mixed state , while one qubit is prepared in @xmath40 .",
    "see figure [ fig : preparation3 ] for a possible , but very uneconomical way to do so using a circuit of circuit depth six and consuming two auxiliary qubits that are discarded in the process .",
    "note that there seems to be no less wasteful way to prepare @xmath39 as applying gates probabilistically is not possible at the moment .    nevertheless , once the improvements that ibm announced are available , implementing the circuit for more qubits will become possible . here",
    ", we exemplarily show how to implement the circuit for three qubits , the method can be generalized to more qubits , though . to this end , we assume that the following improvements are available .",
    "we assume that advanced classical processing is available .",
    "in particular , we assume that it is possible to apply gates probabilistically .",
    "furthermore , we assume that arbitrary single qubit gates are available and that subroutines are available , i.e. , user - defined gates can be declared and used .    in this case",
    "the circuit can be implemented as follows .",
    "the initial state @xmath41 is prepared by performing either a pauli @xmath4 or @xmath37 with probability @xmath42 on both of the qubits for which we want to prepare @xmath43 individually ( which we will denote as qubits 1 and 2 in the following ) , and furthermore performing a single qubit unitary that rotates @xmath3 to @xmath40 for the remaining qubit , which we will denote as qubit 3 in the following .",
    "after the initial state is prepared , the system is evolved adiabatically . in each step of this adiabatic evolution the unitary @xmath44 has to be applied .",
    "the unitaries @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 are given in the main text .",
    "the unitary @xmath48 is a single qubit unitary and hence can be implemented easily .",
    "we have @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes a gate @xmath51 controlled by qubits @xmath52 .",
    "a possible implementation of this controlled phase gate is depicted in figure [ fig : ccphase ] @xcite . recall that the two swaps can be implemented using three @xmath13 gates , while phase gates that are controlled by one qubit may be decomposed into two controlled not gates and three single qubit unitaries @xcite .",
    "implementing @xmath46 is more tricky .",
    "first , one performs a basis transformation by applying @xmath53 , where @xmath54 . in the new basis the unitary @xmath46",
    "is given by the unitary @xmath55 , where @xmath56 followed by a single qubit unitary @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "finally , the basis change has to be undone , i.e. , @xmath19 is applied .",
    "the controlled rotation can be implemented in a similar way as shown above for @xmath45 . in order to implement @xmath19",
    ", we use that this unitary can be decomposed into a toffoli gate @xmath58 followed by a @xmath59 , and a pauli @xmath60 @xcite .",
    "this circuit can be further decomposed using the decomposition of the toffoli gate suitable for the ibm quantum computer @xcite and some simplifications , yielding the circuit depicted in figure [ fig : agate ] .",
    "this circuit can be packed into a user - defined three - qubit gate depending on the free parameter @xmath61 and the adiabatic evolution is performed by applying these gates with increasing @xmath62 successively . finally , measuring @xmath6 on qubit 3 yields the magnetization of the eight - qubit spin chain .    as ibm announced , that advanced classical processing , arbitrary single qubit unitaries , and user - defined gates will become available in future , implementing the circuit for three or more qubits will become feasible",
    ", as long as the number of steps ( recall that we used l=2400 steps before ) is not an issue .",
    "otherwise , similar methods as those used in the two qubit circuit will have to be applied ."

    "<S> an important aspect to be addressed here is the assessment of errors . </S>",
    "<S> there are two sources of errors that have to be considered separately . </S>",
    "<S> first , it is necessary to run an experiment often enough so that statistical errors are reduced . </S>",
    "<S> this is an easy task since it only implies repetition of experiments . </S>",
    "<S> second , systematic errors must be estimated . </S>",
    "<S> the situation here is particularly subtle , as a cloud computer is run by teams unrelated to its users . </S>",
    "<S> the problem of how to estimate a systematic error without knowing the detail of the computer is non - trivial . </S>",

    "<S> let us begin by discussing some of the features and constraints of the ibm quantum computer , which consists currently of five qubits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the qubits are initiated in the computational basis state @xmath3 . as mentioned before , </S>",
    "<S> a limited but universal set of gates is available , namely the well known clifford+t set . </S>",
    "<S> this set consists of the pauli operators ( @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) , the hadamard gate ( @xmath7 ) , phase gates ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) , @xmath10 gates ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) , as well as entangling controlled not gates ( @xmath13 ) . </S>",
    "<S> measurements in @xmath6-basis as well as bloch vector measurements ( see below ) are performable . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , the depth of the circuit , i.e. , the number of gates that have to be applied successively and can not be parallelized , is limited to 39 . due to the architecture of the quantum computer , one qubit , which we denote as qubit 2 in the following , plays a special role . </S>",
    "<S> it is the only qubit that can be target of a @xmath13 gate . </S>",
    "<S> note that the gate set is nevertheless universal . </S>",
    "<S> however , applying e.g. a @xmath13 gate between qubits @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( both different than @xmath16 here ) , which we denote by @xmath17 in the following , is very uneconomical . </S>",
    "<S> one first needs to swap qubit @xmath15 and qubit @xmath16 ( which requires three @xmath13s ) , apply @xmath18 and swap again qubits @xmath15 and @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> as computations are naturally subject to both systematic and statistical errors , ibm provides access to a classical simulator that implements an error model of the quantum computing hardware and therefore allows simulation of a circuit before actually performing the computation .    </S>",
    "<S> let us now investigate the errors , which occur in the computation . </S>",
    "<S> we will first analyze the errors that occur after applying a single gate and then consider those , which occur in an actual quantum computation , involving many gates . </S>",
    "<S> note that the maximum allowed number of runs of one computation is limited to 8192 , which allows to estimate the statistical error .    in order to get an estimation of the error that occurs after applying a single gate from the gate set , we perform the following procedure . </S>",
