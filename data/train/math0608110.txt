    "it is well known that if two smooth compact complex manifolds @xmath0 are deformation equivalent , then there is a diffeomorphism @xmath1 such that @xmath2 ( we refer the reader to @xcite for a general discussion of these type of problems and for more complete references ) .    it was for long time an open question ( called def= diff question ) whether conversely two diffeomorphic minimal algebraic surfaces @xmath3 would be deformation equivalent ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "note that seiberg - witten theory furnished a simple proof of the fact , predicted by donaldson theory much earlier , that a diffeomorphism @xmath4 would have the property that @xmath5 .",
    "there are indeed easy counterexamples to the def= diff question , given by pairs of such surfaces @xmath3 , admitting a diffeomorphism @xmath4 with @xmath6 , but none with @xmath7 ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the first counterexamples to the refined def= diff conjecture where a diffeomorphism @xmath4 with @xmath7 is required were given by manetti in @xcite , and we shall refer to the surfaces constructed in that paper as * manetti surfaces*.    manetti surfaces are not simply connected , and one could suspect that their universal abelian covers ( which are compact ) could be deformation equivalent .",
    "for this reason @xcite proposed some examples of simply connected minimal surfaces of general type , called abc examples , showing that they are not deformation equivalent .",
    "later on , our joint paper with wajnryb @xcite showed that abc surfaces with fixed integer constants @xmath8 and @xmath9 yield diffeomorphic surfaces of general type .",
    "thus @xcite exhibited simply connected counterexamples to the refined def= diff question .",
    "on the other hand , in @xcite it was shown that a minimal surface of general type @xmath10 has a canonical symplectic structure ( unique up to symplectomorphism ) which is invariant for smooth deformation , and which is called canonical because its cohomology class is exactly the class of the canonical divisor @xmath11 .",
    "a further refinement of the def = diff question is then whether minimal algebraic surfaces of general type which are canonically symplectomorphic are also deformation equivalent .",
    "we prove in this paper that the manetti surfaces yield counterexamples also to this further question .",
    "the same question for the simply connected case remains open , and we have not yet been able to decide whether the abc examples are canonically symplectomorphic .    for this reason we take up here again the manetti surfaces , already considered in @xcite .",
    "our treatment here is direct and elementary , with the purpose of being understood both by algebraic geometers and by symplectic geometers .",
    "first of all we avoid to resort to the theory developed by auroux and katzarkov ( @xcite ) , secondly , we prove more general results than the ones contained in @xcite .",
    "this is needed in order to show that the manetti examples are canonically symplectomorphic .",
    "the examples of @xcite are in fact pairs of surfaces of general type @xmath3 which are not deformation equivalent , but which admit respective degenerations to normal surfaces @xmath12 with singularities , which in turn are deformation equivalent to each other via an equisingular deformation .",
    "moreover , each degeneration yields a @xmath13-gorenstein smoothing of the singularities .",
    "manetti used a result of bonahon on the group of diffeomorphisms of lens spaces in order to show that the surfaces @xmath3 are diffeomorphic to each other .",
    "here , the canonical symplectomorphism of manetti surfaces follows from the following    [ families ] let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be two flat families of normal surfaces over the disc of radius 2 in @xmath16 .",
    "denote by @xmath17 and by @xmath18 the respective projections and make the following assumptions on the respective fibres of @xmath19 :    \\1 ) the central fibres @xmath20 and @xmath21 are surfaces with cyclic quotient singularities and the two flat families yield @xmath13-gorenstein smoothings of them ,    \\2 ) the other fibres @xmath22 , @xmath23 , for @xmath24 are smooth .",
    "assume moreover that    \\3 ) the central fibres @xmath20 and @xmath21 are projectively equivalent to respective fibres ( @xmath25 and @xmath26 ) of an equisingular projective family @xmath27 of surfaces .",

    "@xmath36 , admit a unique smoothing component .",
    "an important step in the proof is furnished by the following    [ glueing ] let @xmath37 be a projective variety with isolated singularities admitting a smoothing component .",
    "assume that , for each singular point @xmath38 , we choose a smoothing component @xmath39 in the basis of the semiuniversal deformation of the germ @xmath40 . then ( obtaining different results for each such choice ) @xmath30 can be approximated ( in the hausdorff metric ) by symplectic submanifolds @xmath41 of @xmath42 , which are diffeomorphic to the glueing of the exterior of @xmath43 ( the complement to the union @xmath44 of suitable ( milnor ) balls around the singular points ) with the milnor fibres @xmath45 , glued along the singularity links @xmath46 .",
    "a pictorial view of the proof is contained in the following figure .",
    "a corollary of the above theorems is the following    [ canonical]a minimal surface of general type @xmath10 has a canonical symplectic structure , unique up to symplectomorphism , and stable by deformation , such that the class of the symplectic form is the class of the canonical sheaf @xmath47 the same result holds for any projective smooth variety with ample canonical bundle .",
    "theorem [ families ] holds more generally for varieties of higher dimension with single smoothing isolated singularities , or under the assumptions    \\i ) @xmath48    \\ii ) for each singular point @xmath49 of @xmath43 , the two smoothings @xmath50 , correspond to paths in the same irreducible component of @xmath51 .",
    "as already mentioned , manetti surfaces are abelian coverings of rational surfaces with group @xmath52 , leading to the situation of theorem 1.2 .",
    "hence    [ manetti ] manetti s surfaces ( section 6 in @xcite ) provide examples of surfaces of general type which are not deformation equivalent , but , endowed with their canonical symplectic structures , are symplectomorphic .",
    "let us first recall the well known theorems of ehresmann ( @xcite ) and moser ( @xcite )    [ e - m](ehresmann + moser ) let @xmath53 be a proper submersion of differentiable manifolds with @xmath54 connected , and assume that we have a differentiable @xmath55-form @xmath56 on @xmath57 with the property that    ( * ) @xmath58 @xmath59 yields a symplectic structure on @xmath22 whose class in @xmath60 is locally constant on @xmath54 ( e.g. , if it lies on @xmath61 )",
    ".    then the symplectic manifolds @xmath62 are all symplectomorphic .",

    "it suffices to take on @xmath67",
    "a riemannian metric where the sections @xmath68 , for @xmath69 , are orthogonal to the fibres of @xmath70 .",
    "then we use the customary proof of ehresmann s theorem , integrating liftings orthogonal to the fibres of standard vector fields on @xmath54 .    the variant [ e - v ] of ehresmann s theorem",
    "will now be first applied to the milnor fibres of smoothings of isolated singularities .",

    "if @xmath85 is a smoothing component , then the corresponding milnor fibre is the intersection of the ball @xmath74 with the fibre @xmath22 , for @xmath86 , @xmath87 .    whereas the singularity links form a trivial bundle , the milnor fibres form only a differentiable bundle of manifolds with boundary over the open set @xmath88    since however @xmath85 is irreducible , @xmath89 is connected , and the milnor fibre is unique up to smooth isotopy , in particular up to diffeomorphism .",
    "let us now recall some known facts on the class of singularities given by the ( cyclic ) quotient singularities admitting a @xmath13-gorenstein smoothing ( cf .",
    "@xcite , section 1 , pages 34 - 35 , or the original sources @xcite,@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "the simplest way to describe the singularities @xmath90 is to view them on the one side as quotients of @xmath91 by a cyclic group of order @xmath92 acting with the indicated characters @xmath93 , or on the other side as quotients of the rational double point @xmath94 of equation @xmath95 by the action of the group @xmath96 of n - roots of unity acting in the following way :    @xmath97    this quotient action gives rise to a quotient family @xmath98 , where    @xmath99 , @xmath100 is the hypersurface in @xmath101 of equation @xmath102 and the action of @xmath96 is extended trivially on the factor @xmath103 .",
    "the heart of the construction is that @xmath104 , being a hypersurface , is gorenstein ( this means that the canonical sheaf @xmath105 is invertible ) , whence such a quotient @xmath99 , by an action which is unramified in codimension @xmath106 , is ( by definition ) @xmath13-gorenstein .",
    "these smoothings were considered by kollr and shepherd barron ( @xcite , 3.7 - 3.8 - 3.9 , cf . also @xcite ) , who pointed out their relevance in the theory of compactifications of moduli spaces of surfaces , and showed that , conversely , any @xmath13-gorenstein smoothing of a quotient singularity is induced by the above family ( which has a smooth base , @xmath103 ) .",
