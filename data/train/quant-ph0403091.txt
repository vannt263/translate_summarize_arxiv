    "entangled quantum states typically , if not always , exhibit nonclassical correlations .",
    "these correlations are crucial elements in most quantum information processing tasks including quantum computation @xcite , quantum teleportation @xcite , superdense coding @xcite and some forms of quantum cryptography @xcite ( section 12.6 ) .",
    "given this significance , it is important to consider how to best observe such correlations and thus better understand the quantum resources present in certain situations .",
    "one way of observing nonclassical correlations is via the violation of bell inequalities @xcite .",
    "for example , violations of the clauser - holt - shimony - horne ( chsh ) inequality @xcite can reveal the presence of such correlations in many two - qubit entangled states .",
    "similarly , a violation of the ghz inequality @xcite highlights the existence of nonclassical correlations in the state @xmath2 . finally , the violation of a bell inequality involving higher - dimensional spin @xcite by the spin-@xmath3 singlet state , where @xmath4 highlights nonclassical correlations present in this state .",
    "many other bell violations are also known , however , they are too numerous to mention .    the examples in the previous paragraph involved bell inequalities well - suited to observing nonclassical correlations in particular entangled states",
    ". however , not all bell inequalities are useful for observing such correlations in every entangled state .",
    "for instance , applying the chsh inequality to any two qubits in @xmath5 produces no bell violation and hence , when used in this manner , this inequality does not highlight @xmath5 s nonclassical correlations .",
    "similarly , the w state @xcite @xmath6 satisifies the ghz inequality and hence this inequality is ill - suited for observing its nonclassical correlations .",
    "another noteworthy point about bell violations and entangled states is that certain mixed entangled states , namely bound entangled states , may not violate _ any _ bell inequality as has been conjectured by peres @xcite .",
    "consistent with this , it has been shown that multipartite bound entangled states for which all partial transposes are positive satisfy one particular bell inequality @xcite .",
    "given that individual bell inequalities can be either good or bad tools for observing nonclassical correlations in specific entangled states , it seems interesting to consider the following question : `` which particular bell inequalities are best suited to observing the nonclassical correlations of a certain entangled state ? '' whilst not addressing this general question in the current paper , we do show that certain bell inequalities involving correlations between binary digits in the binary representations of particular observables can be used to detect interesting nonclassical correlations in a particular entangled state involving two sets of @xmath1 ions . in doing so , we follow on from @xcite which showed that the steady - state intracavity state of the nondegenerate parametric amplifier ( nopa ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 is a photon number state , the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the signal and idler modes and @xmath9 is a real squeezing parameter , violated certain bell inequalities . more specifically , using an _ abstract mathematical _ scheme @xcite showed that if we consider the numbers of photons in the signal and idler modes in binary ( eg .",
    "@xmath10 ) then each pair of corresponding bits in the two binary representations simultaneously violates a chsh bell inequality .",
    "that is , it showed that the least significant bits for the signal and idler modes , together , violated such an inequality as did the second least significant bits , the third least significant bits and so forth .",
    "the paper @xcite also briefly suggested how we might observe these violations but , on this point , remarked that a better ( that is , presumably , a more experimentally achievable ) measurement scheme than that suggested was desirable @xcite ( p. 022108 ) .",
    "the results in @xcite can be seen as extending those in @xcite which all showed that @xmath11 violated bell inequalities based on measuring photon - number parity ( oddness or even - ness ) . in terms of binary representations , these other papers violated bell inequalities involving the values of the least significant bits ( and not any other bits as did @xcite ) in the binary representations of the numbers of photons in the signal and idler modes .",
    "this paper extends and complements work in @xcite by explicitly showing the existence of bell violations closely related to those in @xcite within a _",
    "tangible _ and _ arguably experimentally feasible _ context that is different to the context suggested in @xcite . in particular , motivated by @xcite s comment ( p. 022108 ) that the formulation of a practical measurement scheme for the bell inequalities in @xcite is desirable , we ( arguably ) propose such a scheme .",
    "this paper also extends work in @xcite by illustrating different ways to violate the sorts of bell inequalities in @xcite to the ways shown in @xcite . instead of violating bell inequalities by measuring a range of pseudo - spin observables for the state @xmath12 as did @xcite",
    ", we apply a range of displacements and squeezing operations to a state generated from @xmath12 and then always measure the same pseudo - spin observables .    the current paper proceeds as follows : in section  [ state ] the state we consider is described , along with the physical system underlying it which centres around two sets of @xmath1 trapped ions . in section  [ scheme ] ,",
    "the bell inequalities we consider are presented by outlining the measurements and operations they involve .",
    "the measurements consist of measuring bits in the binary representations of @xmath13 and @xmath14 , where @xmath15 ( @xmath16 ) is the number of centre - of - mass phonons for one of the sets of @xmath1 ions in the @xmath17 direction , whilst the operations ( which are applied prior to the measurements ) are displacements applied to the centre - of - mass vibrational states of one of the sets of ions . in section  [ results ] , it is shown that the entangled state violates the bell inequalities .",
    "next , section  [ ch4:local_squeeze ] presents a bell inequality involving local squeezing operations which the entangled state also violates .",
    "finally , the paper concludes with a discussion of its results in section  [ discussion ] .",
    "the system associated with the entangled state considered in this paper comprises of a nondegenerate parametric amplifier ( nopa ) @xcite and two linear ion traps which each lie within an optical cavity and contain @xmath1 identical ions . a schematic diagram of this system is shown in fig .  [ ch3:fig_two ] .",
    "the nopa operates below threshold and its two external output fields first pass through faraday isolators .",
    "each of them then feeds into a different linearly - damped optical cavity via a lossy mirror .",
    "the cavities are aligned such that their axes coincide with the @xmath17 axis and are closed at one end by perfectly reflecting mirrors .",
    "in addition , each cavity supports a cavity mode of frequency @xmath18 described by the annihilation operator @xmath19 , where @xmath20 enumerates the cavities . within both cavities",
    "lie @xmath1 identical two - level ions of mass @xmath21 , charge @xmath22 and internal transition frequency @xmath23 .",
    "these ions are trapped in a linear configuration parallel to the @xmath17-axis by a harmonic potential ( a linear ion trap @xcite ) and hence are tightly confined in the @xmath24 and @xmath25 directions .",
    "furthermore , the vibrational motion of the @xmath26 ion in the @xmath27 trap in the @xmath17 direction is described by the annihilation operator @xmath28 for which @xmath29=1 $ ] .",
    "the traps are aligned such that the @xmath27 trap is centred on a node of the cavity field described by @xmath19 .",
    "finally , external lasers of frequency @xmath30 whose beams are perpendicular to the @xmath17-axis are incident on the first ions of both traps .",
    "the hamiltonian for the @xmath27 optical cavity , the ions within it and its reservoir is @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the free hamiltonian for the vibrational states of the ions and @xmath33 is the free hamiltonian for the cavity field and the ions internal states .",
    "the term @xmath34 describes the electromagnetic coupling between ions whilst @xmath35 describes a raman process involving the cavity field , the external laser and the first ion in the @xmath27 trap . finally , @xmath36 is the hamiltonian for the external reservoir coupled to the @xmath27 cavity for which @xmath37 is a reservoir annihilation operator and @xmath38 is a damping constant .",
    "more precisely , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) is the frequency of both harmonic traps along the @xmath17-axis .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath33 is , in a frame rotating at frequency @xmath30 , @xmath42 where @xmath43 , @xmath44 , and @xmath45 and @xmath46 are raising and lower operators for the internal states of the @xmath47 ion in the @xmath27 trap .",
    "the term @xmath48 is @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the permittivity of free space and @xmath51 , for @xmath52 , is the position of the @xmath53 ion in the @xmath27 trap .",
    "the interaction term @xmath35 is @xmath54 \\\\ & & + \\hbar g_{0 } \\sin ( k x_{j1 } ) \\bigl ( a^{\\dag}_{j } \\sigma_{j-}^{(1 ) } + a_{j } \\sigma_{j+}^{(1 ) } \\bigr),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is the complex amplitude for both external lasers , @xmath56 and @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is the coupling constant for the ion - field interaction .",
    "the following feasible assumptions are made about the system @xcite in order to simplify calculations and to focus on its most important aspects :    1 .",
    "all ions are so cold that they only move from their mean position @xmath59 by a small amount and so we can approximate @xmath60 by @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is a small displacement .",
    "the cavity field and external laser frequencies are appreciably detuned from @xmath23 and all two - level ions are initially in their ground states . thus , the excited internal states are sparsely populated and spontaneous emission effects are negligible and can be ignored .",
    "the wavelength of the cavity mode is much greater than the distances that the first ions in both traps stray from the centres of their traps and thus @xmath63 .",
    "this allows us to to arrange things so that the @xmath24 and @xmath25 dependences of the external laser fields are negligible and thus , assuming @xmath55 is time independent , that @xmath64 , where @xmath65 is a real time - independent amplitude .",
    "the damping parameter @xmath38 is such that @xmath66 .",
    "5 .   for each trap , the frequencies of different normal or collective modes @xcite in the @xmath17-direction are well - separated .",
    "thus , the cavity modes only couple to the centre - of - mass modes in this direction .    given assumptions 1 , 3 and 5 , calculations in @xcite show that we can write @xmath67 in terms of normal - mode creation and annihilation operators as @xmath68 \\\\ \\nonumber & & + \\frac{\\hbar g_{0 } \\eta_{x}}{\\sqrt{n } } ( b_{jx}^{(1)}+b_{jx}^{(1)\\:\\dag } ) \\bigl ( a^{\\dag}_{j } \\sigma_{j-}^{(1 ) } + a_{j } \\sigma_{j+}^{(1 ) } \\bigr ) \\\\ & & + \\kappa(a_{j } r^{\\dag}_{j } + a^{\\dag}_{j } r_{j } ) + h_{\\rm j\\:res},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the annihilation operator for the @xmath47 normal mode for the @xmath27 trap in the @xmath17 direction .",
    "for example , @xmath70 is a centre - of - mass mode annihilation operator which is @xmath71 whilst @xmath72 is the annihilation operator for the _ breathing mode _ which is @xmath73 when @xmath74 .",
    "observe that in eq .",
    "( [ com_eqn ] ) the cavity mode only couples to the centre - of - mass vibrational mode in the @xmath17 direction .",
    "though it would be very challenging , at best , to experimentally realise the system outlined above , it is potentially feasible to do so .",
    "this is because , first , optical cavities and parametric oscillators have been widely realised in laboratories .",
    "second , recent experiments @xcite have trapped single ions in electromagnetic traps lying within optical cavities .    upon adiabatically eliminating the cavity mode @xmath19 and also @xmath75 and @xmath76 in eq .",
    "( [ com_eqn ] ) , it can be shown that the langevin equation for @xmath70 is @xmath77 where @xmath78 denotes the partial derivative of @xmath17 with respect to time , @xmath79 and @xmath80 is a quantum noise operator @xcite .",
    "this equation shows that the only effect of having multiple ions , as opposed to a single ion , in the trap is to introduce a factor of @xmath81 in front of @xmath82 . from @xcite ( especially eqs ( 11 ) and ( 12 ) ) , it is known that when @xmath83 the evolution described by eq .",

    ", it follows that for the system illustrated in fig .",
    "[ ch3:fig_two ] we can transfer @xmath11 into the centre - of - mass modes in the @xmath17 direction of the two sets of @xmath1 trapped atoms thus producing , in the steady state , @xmath85 denotes the _ centre - of - mass _ vibrational number state for the @xmath17 direction with eigenvalue @xmath86 for the ions in the @xmath27 trap .    for the remainder of the paper , we consider @xmath87 and , in subsection  [ bell_scheme ] , present certain bell inequalities involving correlations between bits in the binary representations of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "section  [ results ] then shows that @xmath88 violates these inequalities and thus that they highlight nonclassical correlations in @xmath88 .",
    "we have assumed the trapped ions suffer no vibrational decoherence .",
    "this assumption is justified in the following sense : in realistic systems , the timescale over which appreciable vibrational decoherence occurs is greater than that over which quantum exchange would take place @xcite . because of this , we can , in principle , generate a state very similar to @xmath88 before appreciable vibrational decoherence has occurred and then consider this state . hence , even taking vibrational decoherence into account , we can produce a state very close to @xmath88 , thus allowing us to ignore this decoherence of the trapped ions in our analysis .",
    "to ease the reader into the bell inequalities we consider , we now outline a line of thinking by which someone might come to consider the closely related bitwise bell inequalities in @xcite .",
    "each centre - of - mass vibrational number state constituting @xmath89 can be expressed as an infinite - length binary string that denotes the number of centre - of - mass phonons in the state @xcite .",
    "for example , @xmath90 can be written as @xmath91 . expressing all centre - of - mass vibrational number states in this manner",
    ", @xmath92 becomes @xmath93 where it is implicit that the bit strings represent @xmath13 or @xmath14 values .",
    "let us for the moment pretend that each bit in eq .",
    "( [ binary ] ) represents a physical qubit , with corresponding bits in each statevector with a ` 1'(`2 ' ) subscript representing the same qubit .",
    "that is , with all of the least significant bits in each statevector denoted by a ` 1 ' ( ` 2 ' ) subscript representing one qubit , the second least significant bits in each statevector denoted by a ` 1 ' ( ` 2 ' ) subscript representing another and so forth . upon adopting this fiction",

    "that is , we can simultaneously violate this inequality for the qubit pair denoted by ( 0 ) , the one denoted by ( 1 ) and so forth .    to observe @xmath92 s nonclassical correlations we would like to implement the scheme involving chsh violations described in the previous paragraph as it produces the largest possible violation for each qubit pair",
    "however , our physical system of interest does not have the distinct qubits used in the scheme and so , in practice , we can not address all binary digits individually . in spite of this",
    "we can still implement a similar scheme using other local unitaries and other measurements to produce multiple , though smaller , chsh violations , as shown in the next subsection .",
    "in this subsection we present three chsh inequalities involving correlations between three pairs of bits in the binary representations of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "these inequalities involve displacement operations which we apply to both sets of ions before making certain measurements involving electronic states .",
    "applying displacements to both sets of ions in @xmath88 yields @xmath96 are , respectively , displacement operators acting on the first and second sets of ions in @xmath97 ( that is the sets in the first and second traps , respectively ) with displacements @xmath98 and @xmath99 .",
    "these operators are given by @xmath100 and @xmath101 .",

    "lastly @xmath104 is the two - mode vacuum state for the centre - of - mass modes of the first and second sets of ions in the @xmath17 direction .    after applying @xmath105 and @xmath106 ,",
    "the next step in our chsh inequality violations is to measure the values of the @xmath1 least significant bits of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "this is done using the measurement scheme in @xcite which we now describe .",
    "this scheme measures the @xmath1 least significant bits of the number of centre - of - mass phonons for a set of @xmath1 identical two - level ions ( with internal transition frequency @xmath107 ) in a linear ion trap .",
    "it begins by first setting the state of each ion to be an equal superposition of its ground and excited internal states .",
    "next , the measurement scheme involves applying a standing - wave laser pulse to each ion such that each ion s mean position coincides with a node of its pulse .",
    "the laser frequency for all pulses @xmath30 is far detuned from all resonant vibrational frequencies for the trapped ions and @xmath108 , the detuning between @xmath30 and @xmath107 , is such that @xmath109 , where @xmath40 is the trap frequency in the direction along which the ions are aligned .",
    "the @xmath26 laser pulse is applied to the corresponding ion for a time @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the lamb - dickie parameter common to all ions and @xmath112 is the rabi frequency for each ion .",
    "finally , an inverse fourier transformation is applied to the ions internal states .",
    "the measurement scheme has the effect of transferring the value of the @xmath26 bit of the number of centre - of - mass phonons for the ions to the two - level internal system of the @xmath26 ion .",
    "this bit is encoded using the following mapping : @xmath113 and @xmath114 , where @xmath115 and @xmath116 are the ground and excited internal states for the @xmath26 ion .",
    "once encoded in internal states , the bit can be readily measured using the resonant fluorescent - shelving technique @xcite .",
    "applying the @xmath105 and @xmath106 to @xmath117 and then using the measurement scheme on both sets of ions in the resulting state produces @xmath118 where @xmath119 is the value of the @xmath120 least significant binary digit of @xmath17 and latexmath:[$c_{i , j } = \\langle    i , j    superscript e s and vib s denote , respectively , an internal ( or electronic ) state and a centre - of - mass vibrational one for the @xmath17 direction .",

    "as inequality  ( [ chsh_inequ ] ) involves thinking about @xmath13 and @xmath14 binary digit by binary digit , we call the inequality in this equation a _ bitwise bell inequality_. inequality  ( [ chsh_inequ ] ) arises from the fact that lhvts are committed to the existence definite values for all @xmath136 and @xmath137 at all times that can only change in a local manner .",
    "one important feature about the bell - inequality scheme outlined above is that it is potentially realistic .",

    "though this paper s results are related to those in @xcite , they differ from @xcite s results in a number of ways .",
    "first , motivated by the comment in @xcite that the formulation of a more practical measurement scheme to measure @xcite s bell inequalities was desirable , we arguably proposed such a scheme ( at least for the least , second least and third least significant bits of @xmath173 and @xmath14 ) which centred on transferring the centre - of - mass vibrational state of group of trapped ions to the internal states of a group of electrons .",
    "second , we violated inequalities similar to those in @xcite using vastly different schemes to those in @xcite .",
    "in @xcite the measurements made in violating the inequalities were pseudo - spin measurements along varying axes in a two - dimensional plane .",
    "in contrast , we measured a pseudo - spin based observable in a single direction and obtain violations by applying a range of displacements and squeezing operations to sets of @xmath1 ions .    aside from extending work in @xcite , the bell violations in section  [ results ] are noteworthy as they are similar to those attainable in so - called hyper - entangled states @xcite .",
    "these are states in which more than four degrees of freedom are entangled , such as a two - photon state with polarisation , energy and momentum entanglement ( each particle has a polarisation , an energy and a momentum degree of freedom participating in the entanglement ) . as a consequence",
    ", hyper - entangled states can violate multiple bell inequalities involving , collectively , five or more degrees of freedom .",
    "the bell violations in section  [ results ] are similar to those achievable in hyper - entangled states as the violations in section  [ results ] involve violating three bell inequalities involving six degrees of freedom , namely the three least significant bits of both @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "one reason why this connection is interesting is that indirect evidence suggests @xcite ( pp .",
    "2179 - 81 ) that some hyper - entangled states may be able to perform certain interesting quantum information processing .",
    "this , in turn , suggests that @xmath88 may also be able to perform such feats .",
    "though we only demonstrated bitwise bell violations for the three least significant bits of @xmath13 and @xmath14 others , presumably , also exist for the fourth , fifth , sixth etc .",
    "least significant bits .",
    "however , the calculations required to demonstrate these violations were not performed as calculating @xmath226 becomes increasingly difficult as @xmath24 increases due to the presence of more and more complicated spreads of centre - of - mass number states sharing the same value for the @xmath120 bit .",
    "an example of this increased complication can be seen by observing the fact that eq .",
    "( [ joint_correlation ] ) ( @xmath227 ) is simpler than eq .",
    "( [ three_expectation ] ) ( @xmath228 ) .",
    "an alternate approach we could have taken to investigating @xmath97 s nonclassical correlations would have been to see what quantum information processing tasks this state s correlations could be used to perform . however ,",
    "one complication with this is that the @xmath0 systems in the total physical system described by @xmath97 are not qubits but instead are infinite - dimensional harmonic oscillators . because of this , we can not directly consider if this state is useful in helping to implement well - known quantum protocols for qubits . in spite of this difficulty , however , a recent result showing that certain bell violations imply the existence of quantum communication complexity protocols superior to any classical ones @xcite may be useful in manifesting @xmath229 s nonclassical correlations .",
    "in particular , it may allow us to readily show that section  [ results ] s bell violations imply that @xmath97 could be employed to perform such quantum protocols .",
    "yet another approach that could be taken to illustrate the nonclassicality of @xmath92 is to use entanglement witnesses @xcite .",
    "an entanglement witness @xmath230 for the entangled state @xmath231 is an operator such that @xmath232 and @xmath233 whenever @xmath234 is a separable state .",
    "this approach would involve identifying suitable operators @xmath230 and then applying them to @xmath92 .",
    "we acknowledge that it may be a useful approach to try , however , we have not explored it .",
    "how feasible are the system and measurement scheme we have discussed ? to reiterate , first , the system involving the parametric oscillators feeding into two cavities within which lie ion traps containing @xmath1 ions does not seem to be infeasible .",
    "this is because , as stated earlier , optical cavities and nondegenerate optical parametric amplifiers have been widely realized in laboratories for some time .",
    "in addition , experiments in which a single harmonically trapped ion has been placed within an optical cavity have been conducted @xcite .",
    "another factor consistent with the potential feasibility of the system considered is that the entangled state @xmath235 can be created , to a good approximation , on a timescale far shorter than that of the vibrational decoherence for the ions .",
    "finally , displacement and squeezing operations on trapped ions have been realised in @xcite via shining laser beams on the ions .    to conclude , following on from @xcite we have presented bell inequalities that reveal certain nonclassical correlations in @xmath97 . in particular , these correlations are between bits in the binary representations of @xmath13 and @xmath14 that violate three bitwise inequalites .",
