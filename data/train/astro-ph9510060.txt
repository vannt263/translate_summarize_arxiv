    "the most common method for determining the distances to radio pulsars is based on their dispersion measure and models of the galactic distribution of free electrons ( @xcite ) .",
    "these distance estimates typically have an uncertainty of 30% .",
    "distances may also be determined by measuring annual parallax , based on either timing ( @xcite ) or interferometric measurements ( @xcite ) .",
    "hi absorption by interstellar hydrogen is also a common distance indicator ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , no pulsar has a distance estimate more accurate than @xmath2% , and for all but two , the errors are greater than 20% .",
    "any acceleration of a pulsar along the line of sight will change the observed pulse period derivative @xmath3 . as shklovskii ( 1970 ) pointed out , an apparent acceleration occurs when the proper motion is significant .",
    "the magnitude of this contribution is @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the pulse period , @xmath6 is the transverse velocity , @xmath7 is the pulsar distance , and @xmath8 is the speed of light . for many millisecond pulsars ,",
    "this effect is of similar magnitude to the intrinsic pulse period derivative , making it hard to determine accurately from timing data either the intrinsic pulse period derivative ( @xcite ) , or the distance and transverse velocity .",
    "this apparent acceleration also applies to orbital period derivatives , and the contribution is @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the orbital period ( @xcite ) . in fact , for many nearby millisecond pulsars , it is expected to completely dominate future observed orbital period derivatives .",
    "this means that @xmath11 can be obtained and , when combined with the measured proper motion @xmath12 , the distance and transverse velocity can be easily separated .",
    "hence , the proper - motion contribution to the pulse period derivative can also be determined , giving accurate estimates of the intrinsic pulse period derivative and hence the magnetic field strengths , ages and spin - down luminosities of binary millisecond pulsars .",
    "the amplitude and functional form of the residuals from a least - squares fit to the observed pulse arrival times , if one parameter is set to zero , is often called the `` timing signal '' for that parameter . for proper motion ,",
    "the timing signal is often relatively large , with its amplitude increasing linearly with time . with continued measurement therefore , its relative error decreases as @xmath13 .",
    "the peak - to - peak amplitude @xmath14 of the timing signal owing to the contribution of the proper motion to the observed orbital period derivative , is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the semi - major axis of the pulsar s orbit and @xmath17 is the orbital inclination .",
    "the accuracy of distances obtained in this way are limited by the accuracy of the orbital period derivative measurements .",
    "their accuracy , and therefore the accuracy of distances improve as @xmath18 .",
    "the fact that the relative error in both of these critical parameters decreases in such a spectacular fashion with time demonstrates the power of this method for determining distance and transverse velocity .",
    "table [ t : pbdot ] shows the predicted size of the timing signal @xmath19 after 10 years of regular timing observations for a selection of binary millisecond pulsars .",
    "where the proper motion was not available , we used the median transverse velocity for millisecond pulsars of 69 km  s@xmath20 was used .",
    "also shown is the timing signal due to parallax ( @xcite ) , @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the radius of the earth s orbit and @xmath23 is the angle between the line of sight to the pulsar and the earth s orbital plane . after 10 years , the new method will provide better distance estimates than parallax measurements .",
    "this is possible because @xmath24 , while @xmath25 is constant .",
    "if an rms timing residual of 1.0 @xmath26s could be obtained it would be possible to determine distances this way for several of the currently known binary millisecond pulsars . on average , for the pulsars listed in table [ t",
    ": pbdot ] , 23 years of precise timing data have been recorded by various observers .",
    "so , to reap the rewards of this method a further 78 years of precise timing will be required .",
    "many other effects could contribute to an observed orbital period derivative ; for example , changes in the gravitational constant ( @xcite ) , tidal effects ( @xcite ) , companion mass loss ( @xcite ) and accelerations in globular cluster potentials ( @xcite ) .",
    "these contributions are indistinguishable from the proper - motion contribution , and so it is important to determine which of them are significant .",
    "known pulsars possess one of 5 types of companion : a neutron star , a main sequence star , a white dwarf , a very low mass helium star , or a planetary system ( @xcite ) . fortunately , binary pulsars with either white dwarf or neutron star companions are very `` clean '' , and their orbital periods not affected by tidal or mass - loss effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "systems with low - mass companions such as psr b1957 + 20 possess large orbital period derivatives , possibly caused by tidal effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "the small @xmath27 induced by planetary companions in the pulsar orbit makes it extremely difficult to measure their orbital period derivatives .",
    "the only significant contributions to the orbital period derivatives in neutron star and white dwarf systems are those due to acceleration in the galactic potential @xmath28 , galactic differential rotation @xmath29 , proper motion @xmath30 , and general relativity @xmath31 . table [ t : pbdot ] lists those contributions showing , that the proper - motion term will dominate for many of the binary millisecond pulsars .",
    "for the nearby millisecond pulsar j0437@xmath324715 , the uncertainty in @xmath28 is approximately 1% of @xmath30 .",
    "hence , measurement of the orbital period derivative will ultimately provide a distance estimate which is limited in accuracy to about 1% . if the distance could be independently estimated with superior accuracy , it would be possible to determine the acceleration of the binary in the galactic gravitational potential and thereby constrain the distribution and composition of dark matter ( @xcite ) .",
    "however , pulsars such as psr j2317 + 1439 with large z - heights are probably better suited to such an exercise , because contribution from the galactic acceleration in such pulsars is comparable to the contribution from the proper motion .",
    "this emphasises the importance of monitoring known binary millisecond pulsars and searching for new ones .",
    "the double neutron - star system psr b1534 + 12 has been predicted to provide an even better relativistic laboratory than the binary pulsar b1913 + 16 ( @xcite ) .",
    "unfortunately , the distance to this pulsar is known only to an accuracy of some 30% ( @xcite ) , and therefore the proper motion contribution to the orbital period derivative is uncertain by a similar amount .",
    "recent measurements ( @xcite ) indicate that the predicted orbital period derivative due to gravitational wave emission @xmath31 is @xmath33 , whereas the observed value @xmath34 is only @xmath35 . using the dispersion - measure distance of @xmath36 pc and the measured proper motion ,",
    "the contribution to the observed value from the proper motion is @xmath37 . since @xmath38 , the observed value is in excellent agreement with the general relativistic prediction .",
    "unless the distance estimate can be improved , the orbital period decay due to the emission of gravitational waves can not be verified to better than @xmath39 5% in the psr 1534 + 12 system .",
    "this is a surprising result , which underlines the importance of obtaining independent distance estimates to this system .",
