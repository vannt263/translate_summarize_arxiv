    "se films with a thickness of @xmath5 25 nm were then grown above the five fese layers for protection .",
    "thickness of the films was monitored using a crystal oscillator and confirmed by x - ray reflectivity measurements .",

    "<S> since the muon stopping profile encompasses a region outside the single fese layer ( see fig [ fig : implantation_profile ] ) , the inhomogeneous stray field of the vortices , which extends outside the superconducting layer @xcite , has to be taken into account to obtain the relationship between @xmath32 and the effective magnetic penetration depth in a single - layer fese .    </S>",

    "<S> the effect of disorder is to increase the value of @xmath48 . </S>",

    "<S> @xmath4sr also discriminates between different phases ; all our tf-@xmath4sr data can be fitted with a single superconducting component . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the results show that homogeneous superconductivity exists across the entire fese / sto interface of size @xmath5 @xmath59 . the gap to @xmath0 ratio @xmath60 puts the single - layer fese in the category of the moderately strong - coupling superconductors .    </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence of the superfluid density ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ lambda ] ) may suggest an increase of this quantity at the lowest measured temperature , 5 k. since this effect appears only in a single data point we can only speculate about its significance . </S>",
    "<S> it might point to the presence of a second ( small ) gap effectively opening below 10 k. we tried a two gap @xmath9+@xmath9 wave model to account for this low temperature increase . </S>",

    "<S> another possibility may be some proximity contribution of the additional 4 monolayers of fese . </S>",
    "<S> although spectroscopic data indicate that additional layers have weak interlayer coupling and do not contribute to superconductivity with the second monolayer displaying semiconducting characteristics and charge neutrality @xcite , superconductivity in the interfaced single - layer fese could induce some proximity effect at low temperature thus explaining the increase at 5 k , which is below the bulk @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> further measurements are needed to elucidate these questions .    </S>",
    "<S> to conclude , by measuring the depth and temperature dependence of the local field distribution in a heterostructure containing a buried superconducting single - layer fese , we detect the formation of a vortex state and quantify the superfluid density and magnetic penetration depth of single - layer fese . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature dependence can be well explained by a single bcs @xmath9-wave gap of 10.2(1.1 ) mev . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4sr spectra show that the vortex state and superconductivity are homogeneously formed across the entire interface over a sample with all or the vast majority of the available charges condensing below @xmath63 k. this shows that superconductivity in the buried interface has stable character and that inhomogeneities or imperfections of the substrate or of the overlayers do not hamper the formation of a superconducting state nor sizeably modify its properties . </S>",
    "<S> a very sensitive magnetic probe such as polarized muons do not see indication of static or dynamic magnetism thus supporting spectroscopic evidence that the sdw present in thin film fese is absent in the monolayer @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the simple structure of single - layer fese and its high @xmath0 with @xmath9-wave bcs clean character make it an ideal system to develop a microscopic understanding of high-@xmath0 superconductivity . </S>"
