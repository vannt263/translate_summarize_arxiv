    "sensitivity and response matrices were generated for each time slice .",
    "we regrouped the ccd spectra to have a minimum of 25 photons in each spectral bin ; 6 of the 9 flares had sufficient counts that we could perform spectral fits , and for a few of the longer duration flares , we attempted further time resolution by extracting spectra during the rise and decay phases .",

    "degradation of the acis quantum efficiency ( qe ) at low energies ( @xmath13 1 kev ) has become a problem , due to the buildup of a contaminant on the acis optical blocking filter .",

    "following a long span of small modulations ( peaks in intensity @xmath28 2 mjy ) during the vla observation on 20 september , a large flare occurs toward the end of the 11 hour track at both 3.6 and 6 cm in figure  [ alpha ] , with a peak in flux of @xmath1 61 mjy at 3.6 cm ( l@xmath29 erg s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 ) .",
    "figure  [ alpha ] also shows the variations in spectral index and circularly polarized flux during the flare decay .",
    "this flare represents a maximum enhancement of @xmath1150 over the preflare values ; previous centimeter - wavelength radio observations had revealed evidence of small variations @xcite on ev  lac , but the maximum flux density recorded was only 1.0 mjy .",
    "we consider the large outburst recorded at 3.6 and 6 cm to be a truly unusual event , with a long ( @xmath8 3 hr ) timescale , large ( 3060 mjy ) peak radio luminosity , yet small ( @xmath1320% ) circular polarization .",
    "the spectral indices start out very steep , and decline approximately linearly .",
    "panel ( c ) shows a close - up of the spectral index behavior : for @xmath9 40 seconds before the 3.6 cm peak the spectral index is roughly constant , at @xmath30 .",
    "such large spectral indices during the initial phases of the flare indicate large optical depths in the flaring plasma ; both frequencies are likely optically thick . at late stages in the flare the spectral index has reached a value of @xmath31 and the radiation at 3.6 cm is likely optically thin .",
    "the decline in flux is not characterized by a single exponential decay at either frequency ; instead , the timescale @xmath32 over which the radiation decays exponentially ( flux @xmath33 ; t@xmath34 is time of peak flux ) progressively lengthens during the flare decay .",
    "table  [ tbl : raddecay ] lists the exponential decay timescales at both frequencies during various stages of the flare decay .",
    "the 3.6 cm flux decays at a faster rate ( smaller decay timescale ) than the 6 cm flux , but the increase in the timescale as the decay proceeds occurs at both frequencies .",
    "the interpretation of this flare is complicated by optical depth effects early in the flare , when electron acceleration , injection into a flare loop , and particle trapping are most likely to occur .",
    "in contrast , the late stages of the flare appear to be consistent with optically thin emission at the higher frequency ( 3.6 cm , or 8.4 ghz ) .",
    "we interpret the variations at both frequencies under the assumption that the emission mechanism is gyrosynchrotron radiation from a nonthermal population of mildly relativistic electrons , whose distribution with energy is described by @xmath35 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "the spectral indices obtained during the flare rise , peak and initial decay , however , are not consistent with the range expected from a homogeneous optically thick source ( 2.53.1 for @xmath20 between 2 and 7 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and therefore it is probable that multiple sources with different magnetic field strengths ( perhaps an arcade of loops ) are contributing to the observed radio emission .",
    "it is difficult to separate the temporal behavior of the emission ( number and distribution of accelerated electrons , changing magnetic field strengths ) from temporal change of the source size ; both are conflated in measurements of total flux density .",
    "we investigated some of the key parameters which control the amount of radio emission radiated during the flare .",
    "we assume that the emission at both 3.6 and 6 cm is optically thick , and originates from an inhomogeneous magnetic field with a large dipole configuration , or @xmath36 , where @xmath37 describes the magnetic field strength distribution as a function of radius .",
    "the assumption of optically thick emission allows us to equate the brightness temperature with the effective temperature of the plasma , and implies that the emission is coming from a layer where the observed frequency is the peak frequency , i.e. , where @xmath38 .",
    "we assume that the distribution of nonthermal electrons remains a power - law with fixed index @xmath39 through the flare decay . using the analytic expressions in @xcite",
    ", the flux density can be expressed as + @xmath40 where s@xmath41 is the flux density , k@xmath42 is boltzmann s constant , t@xmath42 is the brightness temperature , t@xmath43 is the effective temperature , @xmath44 is the observing frequency , @xmath45 is the solid angle subtended by the source , @xmath46 is the source size and @xmath47 is the distance to the source . adding in equation 37 of @xcite describing the dependence of effective temperature on @xmath20 , @xmath44 , b , and angle @xmath48 between magnetic field and line of sight , we solve for the changing source size as a function of time at the two radio frequencies , assuming that @xmath49 is the stellar radius , @xmath50 is @xmath9 3000 g , @xmath39 , @xmath48=60@xmath51 . the small spectral indices in quiescence indicate a shallow number distribution with energy , compatible with @xmath522 or 3 , and we choose @xmath523 .",
    "this is also compatible with previous models for nonthermal stellar radio emission , which find that flat spectral energy distributions are better able to reproduce observed spectral energy distributions @xcite .",
    "the dependence on angle @xmath48 is not steep , and we choose an angle @xmath48 of 60@xmath51 as representative .",
    "figure  [ radmod ] plots the variation of the source size , magnetic field strength in the source , and effective temperature for the two radio frequencies during the decay of the large flare .",
    "once the magnetic field strength in the source is known , the total number density of nonthermal electrons above a cutoff energy e@xmath34 , can be calculated , using equation ( 39 ) of @xcite ( in these calculations e@xmath34=10 kev is assumed ) ; this quantity is also plotted in figure  [ radmod ] .",
    "note that the source sizes are larger than or comparable to the stellar radius r@xmath532 r@xmath54 cm .",
    "the minimum magnetic field strengths at the flare peak are 60 and 110 gauss , at 6 and 3.6 cm respectively , and maximum effective temperatures @xmath13.4@xmath310@xmath55k .",
    "the higher frequency indicates a larger field strength at all times due to the larger gyrolayers being sampled .",
    "the magnetic field strength increases with time during the flare decay , a consequence of the decreasing source size , as the location of optical depth unity moves closer to the stellar surface .",
    "these values are consistent with values previously determined from e.g. vlba studies of m dwarf coronae @xcite .",
    "the major energy loss mechanisms for accelerated electrons during solar flares are coulomb collisions from electrons caught in a magnetic trap , and precipitation from the trap into the chromosphere via scattering into a loss cone ( so - called trap plus precipitation models ; * ? ? ?",
    "coulomb collisions preferentially deplete low energy electrons compared to high energy electrons ; the timescale for radiative loss goes as e@xmath56 , and the observed flare variation at each frequency is qualitatively consistent with the hypothesis that coulomb collisions dominate during the decay phase , as the timescales grow larger during the decay . the collisional deflection time is approximated in the weak diffusion limit by + @xmath57 } \\big ) \\;\\;\\ ; s\\ ] ] @xcite , where _ n@xmath58 _ and _ t@xmath58 _ are the ambient trap particle density and temperature , respectively ; and _ e@xmath59 _ is the energy of the accelerated particle in units of kev . by analogy with solar flare behavior ,",
    "the observed decay timescales for the flare on ev  lac listed in table  [ tbl : raddecay ] are consistent with very energetic electrons , or a remarkably low trap density , or a combination of the two . a trap density of @xmath60 @xmath61 and thermal electron temperature of t@xmath6210@xmath63k are consistent with the observed decay times and with particles of @xmath9 100400 kev in energy . during the flare decay ,",
    "then , one expects that the low energy particles will lose energy and precipitate from the trap , resulting in a hardening of the electron distribution with energy .",
    "the toy model for magnetic field inhomogeneities described above assumes that the number distribution with energy has a fixed index , and only the total number density above a cutoff energy e@xmath34 decreases .",
    "the depletion of low energy electrons from the trap could be simulated in the model by a corresponding increase in the cutoff energy in the electron density distribution with energy .",
    "the ratio of nonthermal electron density to thermal electron density in the trap implied by the model is very high , @xmath110@xmath64 at the beginning of the flare decay .",
    "several smaller amplitude flares are also evident in the data , particularly at 6 cm ( figure  [ cbandflare ] ) , accompanied by large amounts of circularly polarized flux .",
    "computations of `` preflare '' values of average flux and polarization were determined by limiting the time range to 03:30:00  08:25:00 , to avoid any of this smaller scale variability ( although it is still apparent at 3.6 cm ) .",
    "the average preflare fluxes at 3.6 and 6 cm are 0.41@xmath270.02 and 0.65@xmath270.03 mjy , respectively , and the average circular polarization ( average v flux divided by average i flux ) at 3.6 and 6 cm is @xmath6522@xmath275% and @xmath6522@xmath275% , respectively .",
    "there are two events at 6 cm which reach 100% circular polarization , with no apparent correspondence at 3.6 cm .",
    "these events occur in both intermediate frequencies used in the 6 cm observations , spanning 48104910 mhz . the lack of corresponding variations at 3.6 cm constrains the bandwidth of the event to be 100 mhz @xmath66 3500 mhz .",
    "the peak amplitudes of a few mjy are rather small , implying that the peak radio luminosity is 6.2@xmath310@xmath67 erg s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 .",
    "this behavior is very reminiscent of radio bursts with large amounts of circular polarization seen on other active m dwarfs , which have accompanying large brightness temperatures ( generally @xmath810@xmath67k ) and short durations , although an event on the dme star proxima centauri reported by @xcite had 100% right circular polarization lasting for days .",
    "the two highly polarized events early in the observation are relatively long - lasting , having durations of @xmath1 1 hour each .",
    "the large amounts of circular polarization argue for a relatively localized phenomenon , due to the large brightness temperatures needed ( @xmath6810@xmath67k ) to generate extreme circular polarization levels ( usually a coherent process is needed ) ; the source size can be calculated as + @xmath69 where r@xmath54 is the source size in 10@xmath70 cm , d@xmath71 is the distance to the source in parsecs , @xmath44 is the observing frequency , s@xmath41 the flux density , and t@xmath72 the brightness temperature ; using a lower limit of 10@xmath67k for the brightness temperature requires r@xmath54 to be less than 6@xmath310@xmath73 , or about 0.1% of the stellar diameter .",
    "two flares are evident in the u band light curve depicted in figure  [ fig : timeline ] .",
    "the first is an enhancement of only 0.68 magnitudes , lasting @xmath1 268 seconds ( peak at 20 september 04:04:34 ut ) , while the other has a peak of 3.3 magnitudes above the quiescent value and lasts for about 420 seconds ( peak at 20 september 08:29:31 ut ) . using the formula described in  2.2",
    ", we estimate the flare energies to be 2.6@xmath310@xmath74 ergs and 5.2@xmath310@xmath75 ergs for the two flares , respectively .",
    "the existence of clouds prior to and during the larger flare makes precise determination of the flux variations difficult , but there appear to be smaller enhancements between 06:00 and 08:00 ut .",
    "we are able to determine relative flux variations in the u - band filter only because the second photometer channel also had a u - band filter in it monitoring another star ; the variations in bvr can not be disentangled from cloud variations , but we do clearly see the larger flare in all the colors .",
    "we also investigated the variations of equivalent widths of chromospheric lines  the data are displayed in figure  [ opticaldata ] .",
    "the presence of clouds reduced the flux , thereby making continuum normalization difficult ( due to the decreased count rate ) and adding systematic error to the resultant equivalent width calculations ; for this reason we excluded spectral time slices based on low signal - to - noise of the spectral order ( generally snr @xmath13 10 ) . there is some evidence for variation of h@xmath2 during the flare decay ,",
    "however due to the variable cloud coverage it is not possible to quantify accurately how much variation took place .",
    "we note that previous studies of ev  lac @xcite determined a range of h@xmath2 equivalent widths of 3.55.3  , and h@xmath76 equivalent widths of 4.45.0   during quiescent periods ; during `` active states '' the range of equivalent widths they observed was 4.710.6 and 10.220.9  , respectively .",
    "as shown in figure  [ opticaldata ] , our equivalent width measurements span @xmath134  . there was an impulsive u - band flare during our observations around 08:29:31 ut , and we observe some variation of equivalent width in h@xmath2 and h@xmath76 , but the existence of similarly large variations one hour later ( when no photometric flare indicators are present ) make the flare interpretation problematic .",
    "@xcite noted from studies of flares on the m dwarf flare star ad  leo that optical chromospheric lines have a long gradual phase , compared to the impulsive continuum variations , and if such events are common to flare stars , we should have had an increased probability of observing enhanced equivalent widths during the flare .",
    "two small enhancements can be seen in the uv light curves in figure  [ fig : timeline ] , in orbits 1 and 3 of the four hst orbits in which data were taken .",
    "the peaks were reached at 16:53:46 and 19:48:00 , represent enhancements of @xmath1 1.5 ( 1.8 ) times the nearby count rates , and last for only about 4 ( 5 ) minutes , respectively .",
    "the total uv energy released during the two flares was estimated by subtracting from each the quiescent spectrum , and integrating from 12701750 ; the first flare radiated 1.4 @xmath3 10@xmath77 erg , the second 5.0 @xmath3 10@xmath77 erg .",
    "we attempted to determine spectral variations during the events .",
    "previous analyses of spectral characteristics of ultraviolet flares on active stars revealed a variety of phenomena , from downflows with velocities up to 1800 km s@xmath6 @xcite to broadening of si  iv line profiles with widths of up to 500 km s@xmath6 @xcite , to blue - ward enhancement of continuum emission during flares @xcite .",
    "however , due to the low enhancement above the non - varying count rate , and short time duration of these events , the signal - to - noise of the 60-second flare spectra was not high enough to determine any of these reliably .",
    "we next co - added all the 60 second spectra which occurred during flares , to investigate gross flare - quiescence differences and flare - flare differences .",
    "an examination of the strongest features during the two flares , in comparison with quiescent line profile shapes , is given in figure  [ uvcompare ] .",
    "our fitting routine ( based on * ? ? ?",
    "* ) estimates the surrounding continuum level , and performs single and double - gaussian line - profile fitting to the brightest lines in the flare spectra ; the results are listed in table  [ tbl : uvtbl ] .",

    "the uv / x - ray emissions could still be manifestations of the same reconnection event , but not with a simple temporal association as the neupert effect prescribes .",
    "the astounding lack of correlation between flares seen in different wavelength regions in this multi - wavelength flare campaign is puzzling , and we investigated the idea that the temporal associations are based solely on chance . if the distribution of flares is random in time , then the time between flares ( waiting time distribution ) should also be a random process , and described by a probability density distribution of the form p(@xmath19t)=@xmath107 , where @xmath108 is the time between flares and @xmath79 is the mean flaring rate .",

    "the radio flaring rate is likewise uncertain , but appears to be greater than 0.09 flares hr@xmath6 , due to the one large flare and possibly many small flares observed in @xmath9 11 hours . in the 1.5 hour period between 06:30 and 08:00 ut shown in the right panel of figure  [ multiw1 ] , there are approximately 9 optical flares and 1 x - ray flare ; the probability of a random occurrence of the nine optical flares and one x - ray flare is 4.7@xmath310@xmath110 , and yet the neupert effect in its simplest formulation can not be used to explain the pattern of energy release . for the @xmath1 0.5 hr interval between each uv / x - ray flare pair ,",
    "the probability of having a random flare association between a uv flare and an x - ray flare using the above estimates for the flaring rates is 0.032 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ chanhst ] , in the six hours from 16:00 - 24:00 there are 3 x - ray flares and 2 uv flares ; the probability of all these flares being randomly associated is 0.026",
    ". thus we can not reject the hypothesis that the @xmath13 half - hour interval between the two uv / x - ray flares is due purely to chance , based on the high flaring rate and the low number of uv / x - ray flare associations.both the optical flare and the radio flare depicted in figure  [ multiw2 ] were large events , and the statistics of the frequency distribution of flare energies in the optical @xcite suggest a frequency of 0.022 flares hr@xmath6 , given an estimated u - band energy of e@xmath111=5.2@xmath310@xmath75 erg .",
    "the probability of observing an optical flare of this energy and a radio flare , using the estimated radio flare rate from this observation , within 60 s is 5.5@xmath310@xmath112 .",
    "thus it appears that the radio and optical flares are not randomly associated , but the lack of a corresponding x - ray flare signature defies our current understanding of stellar flares .",
    "these estimates assume that all flares occur with the same frequency ; studies of optical flares reveal that the flare frequency depends on flare energy @xcite , and investigations of euv / sxr variations of other m dwarf flare stars @xcite also shows a distribution of flare frequencies with flare energy .",
    "therefore , a more detailed treatment of expected and observed multi - wavelength flare associations must be performed before one can assign any significance to one ( or two ) pairs of flares occurring within a reasonably small amount of time .",
    "it is especially important to develop a causal model relating the energies or peak luminosities of flares in different wavelength regions , in order to constrain random associations .",
    "the study of flare stars continues to reveal new surprises , and our campaign on ev  lac was no exception .",
    "the multi - wavelength observations detailed in this paper show both frequent and extreme levels of variability in the dme flare star ev  lac . at radio wavelengths ,",
    "we observe highly polarized emission at 6 cm , which we conclude is the signature of coherent emission processes occurring in ev  lac , and supports previous longer wavelength observations showing a large circular polarization signature .",
    "we also observed an intense radio outburst which was evident at two frequencies ; the timescales and polarization signatures suggest that this is an extreme example of a flare emitting gyrosynchrotron radiation from accelerated particles .",
    "the temporal behavior of the spectral index shows large , steep values during the flare rise and peak , suggestive of optically thick conditions .",
    "the spectral index is constant for about 40 seconds during the time of radio flare rise ; such a signature may be indicative of injection of accelerated electrons into a magnetic trap .",
    "the decay of the radio radiation on long timescales is consistent with the trapping of accelerated particles and subsequent energy losses due to coulomb collisions .",
    "@xcite demonstrated based on solar flares that a constant spectral index can be obtained from the beginning of particle injection into the flare loop until the time when the maximum number of particles is injected .",
    "@xcite also showed that an initially beamed pitch - angle distribution can result in an offset of the time of maximum of gyrosynchrotron radiation relative to the time of maximum injection ; this is due to the extra time needed to fill all the pitch angles required for the resonance condition .",
    "this may explain the optical / radio correlations found in our campaign , if the optical emission is a signature of the particle injection , the flattening of the radio spectral index during the 3.6 cm flare rise is related to the injection profile , and the temporal offset of the optical flare maximum from the gyrosynchrotron maximum is a result of beaming in the pitch - angle distribution .",
    "intense centimetric variations in other m dwarf flare stars are usually accompanied by large values of circular polarization , are shorter lived , and are attributed to coherent mechanisms ; for example , do  cep ( dm4e ) was observed by @xcite in a radio flare at 6 cm which attained a maximum flux density of 80 mjy ( l@xmath113 erg s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 ) , lasting for @xmath8 450 seconds .",
    "this flare , however , was almost 100% circularly polarized , and was narrow banded , occurring most strongly at 4535 mhz but hardly at 4985 mhz ; the star was undetected during a second epoch observation .",
    "no emission mechanism was suggested .",
    "@xcite reported a large amount of circular polarization and flux density ( peaking at @xmath9 300 mjy , or l@xmath114",
    "erg s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 ) on ad  leo ( dm2e ) at 6 cm , which they interpreted as plasma emission ; this burst , however , had a very short duration ( @xmath1 1 minute ) . and",
    "@xcite saw large amounts of right circular polarization on uv  cet ( dm5.5e ) at 3.6 cm ( maximum stokes v flux of @xmath1 30 mjy [ l@xmath115 erg s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 ] , total duration @xmath28 15 minutes ) which @xcite attributed to emission from a cyclotron maser instability .",
    "there is a signature of highly polarized emission from ev  lac , occurring at 6 cm , with timescales of hours , and peak radio luminosity l@xmath1173@xmath31@xmath67 erg s@xmath6 hz@xmath6 .",
    "this behavior is more similar to the types of enhancements seen in other dme flare stars which are attributed to a coherent mechanism , yet the variations described here are of smaller luminosity and occur over longer timescales of hours .",
    "@xcite reported large amounts of circular polarization ( @xmath880% ) at 20 cm wavelengths ; however ev  lac was undetected in their 6 cm measurements , and there are no other reports of measured circular polarization from this star . the enhancements with large circular polarization signature could be connected to the intense but brief events reported on other active dme stars .",
    "several small flares are seen in the optical and ultraviolet .",
    "two small uv enhancements were found during the hst observations .",
    "both had approximately the same enhancement above the surrounding count rate in integrated uv light ( and roughly similar durations ) , and we were able to determine the characteristics of the two flares from line profile variations of bright transition region emission lines .",
    "there was no evidence for bulk plasma motions greater than a few km s@xmath6 , and the amount of turbulent broadening was different in the two flares .",
    "the x - ray data show a panoply of flare types , with flare timescales ranging from a few minutes to several hours .",
    "analysis of undispersed spectra corresponding to individual flares show no evidence of abundance increases , and only moderate temperature enhancements . for three flares which lasted sufficiently long",
    ", we separated the rise phase from the decay phase and found a flare with no temperature increase during the rise , one with a modest temperature increase ( 7 mk ) , and a third with a dramatic temperature increase ( @xmath68 30 mk ) .",
    "a comparison of temperature - sensitive emission line ratios in the x - ray grating spectra reveal evidence for higher temperature plasma during flare intervals , with the largest temperatures occurring during the time intervals with the largest enhancement events .",
    "we are able to isolate the shape and level of the continuum emission , and find that it agrees qualitatively with the information derived from the temperature - sensitive line ratios .",
    "abundance - sensitive line ratios can not constrain the coronal abundance directly , but do suggest a pattern reminiscent of an inverse - fip effect , as is ( now ) commonly seen in the coronae of active stars .",
    "there is no evidence for large changes in the abundance ratios during times of flares .    in the multi - wavelength flare associations ,",
    "we find a complete breakdown of expected relations between the signature from accelerated electrons ( radio , but secondarily optical and ultraviolet ) and the signature presumably due to plasma heating from the accelerated electrons ( soft x - ray emission ) .",
    "we find an optical flare coincident with a radio flare to within 54 seconds , which cements the association of optical stellar flares with a bombardment of the lower atmosphere by nonthermal electrons .",
    "particularly puzzling is the lack of an observable x - ray enhancement with this radio/ optical flare , which would have signaled the influence of the nonthermal particles in heating chromospheric material to coronal temperatures via a neupert effect relationship . lacking this signature",
    ", we can only speculate about the dynamics / characteristics / energy budget of this unusual flare : perhaps the structure involved in the radio / optical flare was of too low an ambient electron density to be an efficient radiator of soft x - rays , and thus was invisible to us .",
    "there are other temporal intervals where optical and uv enhancements could not be connected to contemporaneous x - ray flaring through either timescales or energetics . in only one case",
    "can we conclude that a chance superposition of uv and x - ray flares was occurring ; in the other , we have no way to explain the correlation using simplistic models .",
    "we suggest that a more sophisticated , statistical treatment of multi - wavelength flare correlations is necessary to make causal connections based on temporal associations , particularly for stars ( like ev  lac ) with high flaring rates .",
    "the multi - wavelength flare associations described in this paper point to a complex view of the stellar flare process .",
    "flares are found in every wavelength region in which we observed , and yet multi - wavelength correspondences between flares are elusive for all except the largest optical and radio flares .",
    "the state of understanding of stellar flares has been riddled with inconsistencies between the solar `` paradigm '' and stellar reality , which often reveals a confounding set of multi - wavelength interrelationships . yet",
    "the sun itself is extremely complex , and general trends have only been gleaned after decades of intense study .",
    "the stellar community must therefore assess the importance of any one result in light of the spotty nature of our observing campaigns .",
    "the radio flare presented in this paper has been intriguing , though frustrating , to study , partly due to the choice of radio frequencies and resulting optical depth effects present in the data .",
    "this points to the need for radio observations at higher frequencies to establish injection and trapping properties of stellar coronal loops , at frequencies where the emission is predominantly optically thin . with the advent of the",
    "expanded very large array ( evla ) , which will have a factor of @xmath110 increase in sensitivity over the current vla , it will become feasible to perform high time - resolution multi - frequency observations such as those described here , at higher , optically thin , frequencies ( 15  40 ghz ) and therefore to probe the dynamics of flares with fewer interpretation al ambiguities .",
    "in addition , the use of the atacama large millimeter array ( alma ) at its lowest frequency bandpass ( 90 ghz ) will also stretch coverage of stellar flares , and probe the most energetic flares , with @xmath9 100-fold increase in sensitivity over currently existing mm arrays .",
    "the combination of these powerful new radio telescopes , in conjunction with optical and x - ray observations , should provide additional insight into the detailed heating processes operating in stellar flares .",
    "this project presents the results of vla project ao160 .",

    "<S> a large radio flare from the star was observed at both 3.6 and 6 cm , and is the most luminous example of a gyrosynchrotron flare yet observed on a dme flare star . </S>",
    "<S> the radio flare can be explained as encompassing a large magnetic volume , comparable to the stellar disk , and involving trapped electrons which decay over timescales of hours . </S>",
    "<S> flux enhancements at 6 cm accompanied by highly negatively circularly polarized emission ( @xmath0100% ) imply that a coherent emission mechanism is operating in the corona of ev  lac . </S>",
    "<S> there are numerous optical white - light flares , and yet no signature of emission line response from the chromosphere appears . </S>",
    "<S> two small ultraviolet enhancements differ in the amount of nonthermal broadening present . </S>",
    "<S> there are numerous x - ray flares occurring throughout the observation , and an analysis of undispersed photons and grating events reveals no evidence for abundance variations . </S>",
    "<S> higher temperatures are present during some flares , however the maximum temperature achieved varies from flare to flare . </S>",
    "<S> there is no evidence for density variations during any flare intervals . in the multi - wavelength context , the start of the intense radio flare is coincident with an impulsive optical u - band flare , to within one minute , and yet there is no signature of an x - ray response . </S>",
    "<S> there are other intervals of time where optical flaring and uv flaring is occurring , but these can not be related to the contemporaneous x - ray flaring : the time - integrated luminosities do not match the instantaneous x - ray flare luminosity , as one would expect for the neupert effect . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate the probability of chance occurrences of flares from disparate wavelength regions producing temporal coincidences , but find that not all the flare associations can be explained by a superposition of flares due to a high flaring rate . </S>",
    "<S> we caution against making causal associations of multi - wavelength flares based solely on temporal correlations for high flaring rate stars like ev  lac . </S>"
