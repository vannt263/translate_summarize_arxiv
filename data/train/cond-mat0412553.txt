    "ultrasound is a very powerful tool to study the electronic properties of metals . in systems such as sr@xmath3ruo@xmath4,@xcite heavy fermions,@xcite and organic superconductors@xcite",
    "the ultrasound technique was used to probe the symmetry of the order parameter . in layered organic superconductors ,",
    "ultrasound attenuation was one of the key methods to determine the phase diagram .",
    "@xcite compounds from the @xmath5-(et)@xmath6-x family can exist in different phases , such as normal metal , superconductor or mott insulator .",
    "most phase transition lines can be associated with anomalies of the sound velocity and sound attenuation as a function of temperature or pressure .",
    "@xcite in particular , preliminary experiments indicate that the n - s phase transition is accompanied by a pronounced fluctuation region .",
    "this can be explained as an effect of transient cooper pairs above @xmath2 , or , equivalently , fluctuations of the superconducting order parameter .",
    "it is known that in layered organic materials the fluctuation region is especially broad due to strong electronic anisotropy , low charge carrier concentration and relatively high @xmath2 .",
    "the manifestation of superconducting fluctuations in various physical phenomena in organic superconductors has been experimentally confirmed.@xcite    the sound attenuation and the sound velocity in metals are determined at low enough temperatures by the interaction of phonons with the electronic system . in the frhlich model , phonons couple to the electronic density , hence the electron - phonon interaction is momentum - independent .",
    "this approach is not valid ,  @xcite however , in many systems of interest . in the presence of impurities , one has to consider the electron system in a reference frame moving together with the ion lattice.@xcite indeed , in an impure metal , the elastic scattering of electrons as well as perfect screening at small phonon momentum and relaxation to equilibrium occur in this oscillating frame . in this formalism",
    ", the electron - phonon coupling appears through the stress tensor , rather than through the density operator .    in order to include polarization effects on sound propagating in highly anisotropic media such as organic superconductors",
    ", one has to consider a tight - binding model instead of a continuous one . in the tight - binding model ,",
    "the electron - phonon interaction comes from the modulation of the hopping parameter induced by the lattice deformation when the sound wave propagates through the crystal .",
    "the electron - phonon vertex then depends on the orientation of the phonon momentum and the phonon polarization .",
    "in such a model , where the stretching of specific crystal bonds induced by the lattice deformation contributes to the electron - phonon vertex ,  @xcite one can explain for example that anisotropy in the attenuation of different phonon modes can be as large as few orders of magnitude in sr@xmath3ruo@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite    in the superconducting state , the symmetry of the order parameter can also affect the temperature dependence of the sound attenuation .",
    "namely , it does depend on the presence of nodes and on their orientation with respect to the phonon momentum and polarization .",
    "thus , sound attenuation experiments can probe the type of superconducting pairing .",
    "@xcite    one would naturally expect that the superconducting fluctuations @xcite will interact with ultrasound in a similar way , thus revealing the order parameter symmetry .",
    "the magnitude of the ultrasound renormalization by fluctuations is not necessarily small .",
    "previously , the fluctuation corrections to longitudinal phonon mode propagating perpendicular to the conduction layers in quasi-2d material were found assuming @xmath0-wave symmetry of the energy gap .",
    "@xcite the model that uses the quasi-2d open fermi - surface and the electron - phonon vertex originating from the modulation of the electron interlayer hopping integral in the presence of the ultrasound wave predicts rounding of the sound attenuation and sound velocity temperature dependencies near @xmath7 .    since there is a substantial experimental interest in this subject , we present estimations for the fluctuation corrections to the sound attenuation and sound velocity for longitudinal and transverse ultrasound propagating perpendicular to the conduction planes , for @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave symmetries of the order parameter .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec_thermo ] we present a simple estimation for the fluctuation corrections to the sound velocity that can be obtained from the ginzburg - landau formalism in order to provide a simple phenomenological basis for the microscopic results . in section [ secmodel ]",
    "we describe the microscopic model for the quasi-2d superconductor and for the electron - phonon interaction at various sound polarizations . in section [ sec_no_fluctuations ]",
    "we review the sound attenuation and sound velocity in the mean field approximation ( without superconducting fluctuations ) . in sections [ sec_fluct_s - wave ]  [ sec_dwave ]",
    "we give the superconducting fluctuation corrections for various pairing symmetries and phonon polarizations .",
    "finally , we present a discussion of our results and of their relevance to experiment .",
    "in this section , we obtain the fluctuation corrections to the sound velocity from the ginzburg - landau free - energy functional . before that , we shall give , for completeness , a summary of elasticity theory that can be found in more details elsewhere.@xcite even though it is less detailed than the microscopic approach that is given later , the ginzburg - landau point of view allows one to develop physical intuition .",
    "it can also provide an independent check of the microscopic results that are given in the rest of the paper .",

    "it holds for both isotropic and anisotropic materials in the mean field approximation .",

    "<S> we study the renormalization of sound attenuation and sound velocity by fluctuation cooper pairs in layered superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the influence of @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave symmetry of the fluctuating order parameter , on both longitudinal and transverse phonon modes . we show that both unconventional order parameter symmetry and transverse sound polarization suppress the al and mt terms , while the dos contribution is the least affected . </S>",
    "<S> the combination of these effects can change the sign of the overall fluctuation corrections above @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we also compare the results obtained using the ginzburg - landau formalism with a microscopic derivation of the fluctuation corrections to the sound velocity in both @xmath0- and @xmath1-wave superconductors . </S>",
    "<S> these calculations are motivated by ongoing ultrasound measurements in organic superconductors . </S>"
