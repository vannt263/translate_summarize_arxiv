    "although the standard model ( sm ) is a very successful theory , there are still some mysteries and problems . one of them is the flavor structure of fermions .",
    "we currently know that quarks mix with each other through the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite and that there is a hierarchy among the three mixing angles of the ckm matrix : @xmath4 ,  @xmath5 and @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "yet another hierarchy exists among quark masses and it can be expressed in terms of @xmath7 as @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite . in particular , @xmath10 and @xmath11 surprisingly coincide with each other .",
    "however , the origin of the hierarchies is still unclear .",
    "this is because the yukawa sector in the sm contains a huge number of unknown parameters .",
    "consequently , fermion masses and mixing angles remain free parameters in the sm .",
    "thus , it is interesting to extend the sm with a family symmetry . in ref .",
    "@xcite , authors introduce a family @xmath12 symmetry and try to explain the quark mass hierarchies and small mixing angles via hierarchically suppressed nonrenormalizable yukawa interactions",
    ". a finite group could also be the prime candidate of a family symmetry , which can reduce the number of parameters in the yukawa sector and make the theory predictive @xcite .",
    "recently , friedberg and lee proposed a ( hidden ) translational family symmetry called friedberg - lee ( fl ) symmetry @xcite and tried to relate quark mixing angles with the symmetry .",
    "a more detailed analysis is given in ref .",
    "@xcite and an application to the fourth generation quark model is discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite . furthermore",
    ", many attempts for the lepton sector are performed in refs .",
    "@xcite , some possible origins of the symmetry have been discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , and a new spontaneous cp violation mechanism with the symmetry is considered in ref .",
    "moreover , one of the motivations to consider the fl symmetry is that the smallness of up- and down - quark masses as well as the electron mass can be naturally understood as it always makes one of three generation fermions massless @xcite .",
    "however , the original approach @xcite with the fl symmetry can not explicitly reveal the hierarchies of quark masses and mixing angles , which are treated as input parameters . in this paper",
    ", we extend the discussion to connect both quark masses and mixing angles with the fl symmetry .",
    "in particular , as will be explained in the next section , we propose the fl symmetry which translates the three generation quarks hierarchically and also show that the hierarchical patterns can be responsible for the quark flavor structures mentioned above .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we present the hierarchical fl symmetry . in sec .",
    "iii , we break both fl and cp symmetries in order to generate light quark masses and the cp violating dirac phase in the ckm matrix . in sec .",
    "iv , we extend our model to the fourth generation case .",
    "we summarize our results in sec .",
    "we start our discussion with the lagrangian of the quark mass terms @xmath13 where @xmath14 are up- and down - type quark mass matrices , which are assumed to be symmetric .",
    "the subscripts @xmath15 stand for the family indices . for the lagrangian , we impose the fl symmetry @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are c - numbers , @xmath19 is a global grassmann parameter and @xmath20 . because of the symmetry",
    ", the quark mass matrices take the form @xmath21 where we have assumed that @xmath22 and @xmath18 are real .",
    "hence , the theory is cp conserving .",
    "also , the up and down quarks are massless because of the fl symmetry . in the next section",
    ", we will insert phase factors into the mass matrices to generate the light quark masses and cp violation .    in order to make our point more clear , here we redefine the parameters as follows : @xmath23 consequently",
    ", the up- and down - type quark mass matrices become @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively . in this basis , we impose @xmath26 we note that with eq .",
    "( [ eq : para ] ) , the down - type quark mass matrix becomes similar to the hybrid texture discussed in ref . @xcite . on the other hand , the up - type one is almost diagonal .",
    "since @xmath14 are real and symmetric matrices , they can be diagonalized by real orthogonal matrices : @xmath27 . with eq . (",
    "[ eq : para ] ) , @xmath28 can approximately be written as @xmath29 with @xmath30 and @xmath31 for the up - quark sector , and @xmath32 with @xmath33 and @xmath34 for the down - quark sector , respectively .",
    "note that the factor @xmath35 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vd ] ) arises from the @xmath36 element of eq .",
    "( [ eq : md ] ) . from the mass ratios",
    ", we can deduce that @xmath37 with @xmath38 .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we consider the following hierarchical fl translation : @xmath39 the minus signs in the up sector come from @xmath40 which is negative to reproduce realistic ckm elements .",
    "we note that although the up and down quarks are massless at this stage , in the above approximation , we remain @xmath41 and @xmath42 to be nonzero in order to determine the order of @xmath17 . the parameters @xmath43 and @xmath44 would be the origin of @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively , when we introduce the symmetry breaking terms .",
    "on the other hand , the parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 can also be the origin of the tiny mixing angles of the ckm matrix . for instance , three elements of the ckm matrix can be estimated as @xmath47 where we have used @xmath48 .",
    "these results well coincide with the experimental values @xmath49 and @xmath50 mentioned in the introduction .",
    "namely , in our model , the flavor structures in the quark sector are explained by the hierarchical patterns of the symmetry .",
    "hence , it is also easy to establish the relations between the masses and mixing angles , such as @xmath51 via @xmath52 , and @xmath53 via @xmath54 , respectively .",
    "in order to generate the light quark masses , the fl symmetry must be broken .",
    "since we do not know the origin of the breaking , there may exist many possible ways to break the symmetry . here",
    ", we aim at a minimal scheme and put phase factors into the mass matrices to break the fl and cp symmetries simultaneously as discussed in ref .",
    "that is , we replace eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mu ] ) and ( [ eq : md ] ) as @xmath55 @xmath56 respectively .",
    "note that phase factors are added into @xmath57 and @xmath58 elements for each matrix .",
    "the phases @xmath59 and @xmath60 are responsible for the up- and down - quark masses .",
    "if we regard @xmath61 and @xmath62 as perturbations , we obtain @xmath63 as we expected .",
    "the phases @xmath64 and @xmath65 are added to account for the cp violating dirac phase in the ckm matrix .    in the following",
    ", we will present our numerical analysis to illustrate our result . in our calculation , without loss of generality , we will normalize eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mu2 ] ) and ( [ eq : md2 ] ) with @xmath66",
    ". we will also ignore the terms associated with @xmath67 because they are suppressed by @xmath68 . as a result , the model has three real parameters : @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and three cp violating phases : @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "for these six parameters , we use the following experimental values from the particle data group ( pdg ) @xcite : @xmath73 as input parameters .",
    "figure [ fig : vub - vtdts ] shows the allowed region in the @xmath74 plane with the bounds @xcite @xmath75     plane , where the experimental values from the pdg @xcite are also plotted as the cross lines .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    one can easily see from fig .",
    "[ fig : vub - vtdts ] that our results on @xmath76 and @xmath77 are consistent with the experimental data . here",
    ", we would like to emphasize that the flavor structures of the quark sector are mainly originated from the hierarchical fl symmetry even though the parameters @xmath78 and @xmath70 are not completely fixed . at the best fit point , we have @xmath79 with @xmath66 , which fill the gap between the exact values and expected ones estimated in the previous section .",
    "in our scheme , quark masses and mixing angles are closely related with each other , such as those in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : masmix1 ] ) and ( [ eq : masmix2 ] ) .",
    "so , it should be interesting to extend our scheme to the fourth generation quark model and see whether there exist relations between the fourth generation quark masses and their mixing angles .",
    "we extend the fl symmetry as @xmath80 and the mass matrices eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mu ] ) and ( [ eq : md ] ) as @xmath81 and @xmath82 respectively . here",
    ", we again assume that @xmath83 note that we extend the model so that the mass matrices keep the features mentioned just behind eq .",
    "( [ eq : para ] ) .",
    "since a detailed analysis goes beyond the purpose of the paper , we would like to roughly study and try to figure out their implications . both eqs .",
    "( [ eq : mu4 ] ) and ( [ eq : md4 ] ) are diagonalized by real orthogonal matrices .",
    "one can easily find that @xmath84 determine the mass ratios of the fourth and third generation quarks : @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 indicate the fourth generation quarks , and all coefficients are omitted . the fourth generation quark mixings with the other three generations",
    "can also be estimated as @xmath88 where we have used @xmath89 and @xmath90 .",
    "as one can see , the fourth generation quark mixing angles are directly related to the mass ration @xmath91 via @xmath92 .",
    "we note that the contribution of @xmath93 to the mixing angles is negligibly small compared with that of @xmath92 . to illustrate our implications , we substitute the lower bound of @xmath94 , i.e. , @xmath3 @xcite , and the central value @xmath2 @xcite , into eq .",
    "( [ eq : m4 ] )",
    ". then we get @xmath95 and @xmath96 it is interesting to see that @xmath97 and @xmath98 can be large , which could be measurable at the upcoming experiments like the lhc .",
    "finally , we briefly comment about cp violation .",
    "although , in general , the discussion of cp violation in the fourth generation model is very complicated , in the chiral limit of @xmath99 , cp violation is described by only one simple quantity @xcite @xmath100\\ .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , the quantity may provide us useful information about the size of cp violation . by introducing the same phase factors discussed in sec .",
    "iii , we find that @xmath101 .",
    "unfortunately , the result is much smaller than the sm jarlskog invariant parameter @xmath102 .",
    "hence , the fourth generation model , in our scheme , can not be the main source of the cp violating phenomena , such as the baryon asymmetry of the universe @xcite .",
    "we have studied the quark masses and mixing angles with the hierarchical fl symmetry .",
    "we have shown that the symmetry can explain the hierarchies in the quark masses and mixing angles at the same time . as a result",
    ", the masses and mixing angles are closely related with each other in our model . to generate light quark masses and cp violation ,",
    "we have introduced phase factors into the mass matrices , and then demonstrated that our model can reproduce all experimental values .",
    "we have also extended our scheme to the fourth generation quark model and found the relation @xmath0 for @xmath2 and @xmath3 . we have speculated that @xmath97 and @xmath98 could be measurable at the upcoming experiments like the lhc in our extended fourth generation quark model . +",
