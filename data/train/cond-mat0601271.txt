    "strongly correlated electron systems realized in organic conductors , heavy fermion compounds , transition metal oxides , and more recently high temperature superconductors continue to challenge our understanding .",
    "various anomalous behaviors observed in these materials can not be well understood within conventional theoretical tools based on a fermi liquid picture or a perturbative scheme .",
    "because these intriguing features appear in a non - perturbative regime , numerical methods have played a key role .",
    "exact diagonalization ( ed ) and quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) simulations  dagotto:1994 are amongst the most popular approaches .",
    "however , severe limitations due to small lattice size in ed and a minus sign problem in qmc at low temperatures make it difficult to extract reliable low - energy physics from these calculations .",
    "recently , alternative approaches  htjpk:1998,spp:2000,lk:2000,kspb:2001,p:2003,mjph:2004 , such as the dynamical cluster approximation , cluster perturbation theory , the self - energy functional approach and cellular dynamical mean - filed theory ( cdmft ) have been developed and have already given some promising results .",
    "most of these quantum cluster methods generalize the single - site dynamical mean field theory ( dmft )  @xcite to incorporate short - range spatial correlations explicitly .",
    "in fact the dmft has provided the first unified scenario for the long standing problem of the mott transition in the hubbard model , completely characterizing the criticality associated with this transition in infinite dimension or when spatial correlations are negligible . in spite of its great success in answering some of the challenging questions in strongly correlated electron systems ,",
    "its limitation has been also recognized in understanding low dimensional electronic systems such as high temperature superconductors for instance . in particular , the observed normal state pseudogap in underdoped cuprates  @xcite is in sharp contrast with the prediction of dmft in which any slight doping into the half - filled band always leads to a fermi liquid .",
    "many of the discrepancies are traced back to the neglect of short - range correlations in dmft .",
    "the main objective of these alternative approaches is to describe short - range spatial correlations explicitly and to study the physics that emerges .",
    "cdmft has been recently applied to the hubbard model using ed as cluster solver at zero temperature , as we will discuss later , and to the model for layered organic conductors with qmc as a cluster solver  pbk:2004 .    in this work",
    "we focus on cdmft using the hirsch - fye  @xcite qmc method to solve the cluster problem and to study its performance particularly for small clusters in the one- and two - dimensional half - filled hubbard model .",
    "the method is benchmarked against exact results in one dimension .",
    "then we calculate single - particle green s functions and self - energies on small clusters to study their size dependence in one- and two - dimensions . as an application of the approach that is particularly sensitive to system size , we study the appearance of spin - charge separated luttinger liquid away from half - filling in one dimension .    this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "finally , in sec .  [ section6 ] , we conclude our present work , suggesting future applications of cdmft .",
    "throughout the paper , we will use the one- and two - dimensional half - filled hubbard model as an example , @xmath3where @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) are creation ( annihilation ) operators for electrons of spin @xmath6 , @xmath7 is the density of @xmath6 spin electrons , @xmath8 is the hopping amplitude equal to @xmath9 for nearest neighbors only , @xmath0 is the on - site repulsive interaction and @xmath10 is the chemical potential controlling the electron density .",
    "the cdmft  @xcite is a natural generalization of the single site dmft that treats short - range spatial correlations explicitly .",
    "also , some kinds of long - range order involving several lattice sites , such as @xmath11-wave superconductivity , can be described in cdmft and not in dmft  kcckskt:2005 . in the cdmft construction",

    "this method  @xcite has already passed several tests against some exact results obtained by bethe ansatz and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) technique in one dimension .",
    "this is where the dmft or cdmft schemes are expected to be in the worst case scenario since dmft itself is exact only in infinite dimension and mean - field methods usually degrade as dimension is lowered .",
    "nevertheless , the cdmft in conjunction with ed correctly predicts the divergence of the compressibility at the mott transition in one - dimension , a divergence that is missed in the single - site dmft .",

    "another issue that can be addressed with cdmft+qmc is that of the temperature range over which spin - charge separation occurs in the one - dimensional hubbard model . in other words , at what temperature does luttinger physics breaks down as a function of @xmath0 , and when it breaks down what is the resulting state ?",
    "we saw in this paper that even a single peak in the single - particle spectral weight does not immediately indicate a fermi liquid .",
    "finally , one methodological issue .",
    "two - particle correlation functions are necessary to identify second order phase transitions by studying the divergence of the corresponding susceptibilities .",
    "this can be done with dca  @xcite . in the present paper , instead , we focused on one - particle quantities such as the green s function and related quantities . in some sense , quantum cluster methods such as cdmft use irreducible quantities ( self - energy for one - particle functions and irreducible vertices for two - particle functions ) of the cluster to compute the corresponding lattice quantities . since the cdmft is formulated entirely in real space and the translational symmetry",
    "is broken at the cluster level , it appears extremely difficult , in practice , to obtain two - particle correlation functions and their corresponding irreducible vertex functions in a closed form like matrix equations to look for instabilities .",
    "one way to get around this problem is , as in dmft , to introduce mean - field order parameters such as antiferromagnetic and @xmath197 superconducting orders , and to study if they are stabilized or not for given parameters such as temperature and doping level . in this way",
    "one can , for example , construct a complete phase diagram of the hubbard model , including a possible regime in which several phases coexist .",
