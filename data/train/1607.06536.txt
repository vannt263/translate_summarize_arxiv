    "the sequence starts with the loading of the two becs into the optical lattice and creating a cs mi , followed by the transport of the rb bec , the rb - cs pair formation , the production and the subsequent detection of molecules .",
    "we denote the intensity in the dipole trapping beams by @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 for the beams along the @xmath83-direction for the inital rb and cs dipole traps and for the beam joining the two samples along the transport @xmath45-direction , respectively ( see fig .",

    "note that the cs atoms see a @xmath86 times larger trap frequency than the rb atoms for a given dipole trap laser power .",
    "initially , the rb bec and the cs bec are spatially separated along the @xmath45-direction by @xmath87  @xmath11 m with @xmath88  hz , @xmath89  hz , @xmath90  hz , @xmath91  hz , @xmath92  hz , and @xmath93  hz . here , @xmath94 denotes the trap frequency for the rb trap in @xmath45-direction , and analogously for the other trap frequencies .",
    "the initial distance of the two becs is large enough to avoid spilling from one sample into the other . in the course of the transport , while the confinement of the two samples is controlled by the intensities @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , it is strongly modified along the @xmath45-direction when the underlying dipole traps start to overlap .",
    "beam steering to move the rb trap along the @xmath45- and the @xmath46-directions is achieved by a two - axis translational piezo flexure stage onto which we have attached the fiber tip of the fiber that delivers the light for the rb trap beam propagating in the @xmath83-direction .",
    "beam steering is done with @xmath11m - precision as verified by in - situ absorption images .",
    "the initial gradient @xmath95  @xmath96 levitates the cs sample against gravity , but slightly overlevitates the rb sample .    upon loading both ensembles into the 3d optical lattice with a lattice spacing of @xmath97  nm we drive the sf - to - mi phase transition for the cs sample while leaving the rb sample superfluid .",
    "for this , we exponentially increase the lattice depth to @xmath98  @xmath25 ( @xmath99  @xmath28 ) . at the same the time underlying cs dipole trap",
    "is stiffened to assure that we create a clean one - atom mi shell for cs .",
    "subsequently , the rb sample is transported through the lattice towards and onto the cs sample within typically @xmath30  ms by moving the underlying rb dipole trap along the @xmath45-direction .",
    "the gradient @xmath85 is ramped to @xmath100  @xmath96 in the course of the first @xmath101  ms of the transport process for optimum levitation of rb .",
    "we slightly adjust the vertical position of the rb trap in the course of the transport for optimal overlap with the cs sample .",
    "after @xmath102  ms of the transport , i.e. @xmath103  ms before the rb sample has reached its final position , the offset field @xmath31 is ramped within @xmath104  ms to the zero crossing for @xmath48 at @xmath105  g. simultaneously @xmath85 is adjusted to @xmath106  @xmath96 to compensate for the change in the magnetic moment of rb as @xmath31 is changed . within the last @xmath101",
    "ms of the transport the underlying cs dipole trap beam along the @xmath83-direction is adiabatically turned off to avoid its influence on the final phase of the rb transport .     along the transport direction , the beam intensities @xmath80 , @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , the lattice depth @xmath84 , the magnetic offset field @xmath31 , and the magnetic field gradient @xmath85 as a function of time . the various experimental stages ( a ) lattice loading , ( b ) rb transport , ( c ) rb localization , ( d ) molecule formation , ( e ) stern - gerlach separation , and ( f ) dissociation and detection are indicated in the lower part of the diagram . the horizontal axis is not to scale .",

    "we reverse the feshbach association ramp to dissociate the molecules back to atoms .",

    "we make use of a @xmath135-g wide rb - cs feshbach resonance , whose pole is located at @xmath40  g. the background interspecies scattering length in the vicinity of this resonance is @xmath136  @xmath16 @xcite .",

    "the latter one is together with state @xmath141 a superposition of the molecular states @xmath142 and @xmath143 . the exact composition of the molecular states is of importance for future work when the molecules are to be transferred by stirap from their weakly - bound state to their rovibronic ground state .",
    "we characterize the overlap of the two atomic samples , as presented in fig .  2 of the main article , by using a simple model that assumes two spheres of homogeneous density with radii @xmath144 and @xmath145 .",
    "the convolution @xmath146 of two spheres as a function of the distance @xmath130 between their centers is given by @xmath147\\ ] ] for partial overlap @xmath148 .",
    "we allow for an asymmetric offset @xmath149 to account for the trailing tail that is observed in the experiment when convolving the samples along the transport @xmath45-direction . setting @xmath150 for the center of the cs sample , the full fit function to the number of rbcs molecules",
    "@xmath42 then reads      for @xmath152 the function has a characteristic volcano - like profile , where @xmath153 defines the height the plateau when one sphere is fully enclosed by the other .",
    "the fit can not attribute @xmath144 and @xmath145 to the individual species , however for a sufficiently large difference in the atom number we presume that the smaller radius belongs to the smaller sample ( here cs ) . even though the atom samples possess some ellipticity due to the shape of their trapping potential and even though their densities are inhomogeneous , the fit should yield acceptable estimates for samples radii along the direction of the convolution measurement . when compared to a simple calculation that assumes the formation of defect - free single - shell mis the sample radii that result from the convolution - measurement fits are roughly @xmath111  @xmath11 m larger .",
    "this deviation is probably the result of a reduced density in the outer region of the mi as a result of non - zero temperatures .",
    "note that the convolution measurement shows that we control the relative positioning of the two atom samples along the two steering axes to a much higher precision than the resolution of our imaging setup .",
    "it in particular allows us to calibrate a roughly @xmath154-@xmath11 m chromatic offset between the absorption images of the two species .",
    "we normalize the number of rbcs molecules @xmath42 by the number @xmath43 of atoms in the cs bec and thereby obtain a lower bound for the filling fraction of the rbcs molecules in the optical lattice when we assume a filling fraction of unity for the cs mi right after lattice loading and full coverage of the cs sample by a homogeneous density of rb atoms .",
    "the first assumption is well fulfilled for the center region of the cs mi ( see section cs mi characterization ) .",
    "the second assumption , however , is not necessarily fulfilled and can locally lead to an underestimation of the filling fraction .",
    "the rb sample is elongated along the @xmath83-axis , therefore a significantly higher rb atom number is required to fully cover the nearly spherical cs mi . although the initial rb bec is about twice as large as the cs bec , this requirement is not necessarily met , since @xmath155%@xmath156% of the rb atoms are stuck in the lattice during transport .",
    "furthermore , the rb density is not homogeneous , especially since we are not yet able to drive the rb sample deep into the mi regime .",
    "we note that the elongation of the rb sample is actually necessary to provide sufficient overlap since we have no handle on the relative position of the atom clouds along the @xmath83-axis and a small offset exists due to the fact that the focus of the cs trapping beam is axial shifted from the intersection with the trapping beam that defines the transport axis .    several aspects limit the filling fraction of the rbcs molecules : the finite lifetime of the cs mi at high magnetic fields ( see section cs mi characterization ) as well as losses during the overlapping process , which we attribute to interspecies three - body recombination , create vacancies in the cs mi",
    ". finite coverage of the cs mi by the rb sample and variations in the rb density from @xmath157 limit the overall pair formation efficiency .",
    "the loss of cs atoms in absence of the rb sample is about @xmath158% . the number of rb atoms that are lost during the mixing process ( excluding atoms that are stuck on the way to the cs sample during the transport ) is about @xmath159 times the number of additionally lost cs atoms in presence of rb .",
    "it therefore appears that this loss is dominated by the rb - rb - cs three - body loss mechanism , further reducing the number of cs atoms by @xmath160% of the cs bec size .",
    "we observe an enhancement of the interspecies loss for slower transport velocities , which can be compensated by bringing the lattice depth @xmath161 closer to the critical value at which the superflow of rb breaks down .",
    "this is not surprising considering that both the critical transport velocity and the three - body loss rate scale with the tunneling time in the optical lattice . in the end , about @xmath162% of the remaining cs atoms ( @xmath163% of @xmath43 ) are paired with rb and successfully form rbcs molecules .    for calculation of the molecules entropy",
    "we assume that lattice sites occupied by unassociated atoms can be emptied , e.g. by a blow - away technique @xcite , without affecting the molecular sample .",
    "the probability for an empty site is then @xmath164 , where @xmath44 is the molecular filling fraction , and the entropy per molecule is @xcite @xmath165 taking @xmath166 as a lower bound gives @xmath167 .",

    "independent of the depth of the lattice we find that @xmath172 for @xmath173  @xmath16 .      at low values for @xmath31 ( i.e. @xmath174  g , where we form the cs bec )",
    "the cs sample in the optical lattice is stable for many seconds irrespective of the lattice depth .",
    "increasing @xmath31 to high values ( necessary to access the rb - cs feshbach resonance and to tune the interspecies interaction ) however changes the cs intraspecies scattering length @xmath35 dramatically . for @xmath175  g , where we perform the mixing procedure",
    ", @xmath35 reaches about @xmath176  @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "we emphasize that in this regime it is of crucial importance to drive the system deeply into the mi state to protect the cs mi from enhanced cs - cs - cs three - body loss .",
    "we analyze the stability of the cs mi at high values for @xmath31 ( see fig .",
    "4(b ) of the main article ) by preparing first a cs mi at @xmath174  g for a lattice depth @xmath107 .",
    "we increase @xmath31 within @xmath104  ms to @xmath175  g and then hold the sample for a variable hold time @xmath177 before lowering @xmath31 again back to @xmath174  g within another @xmath104  ms . in the end",
    "the lattice is ramped down adiabatically and the bec fraction of the cs sample is determined .",
    "we find that the bec fraction decays exponentially with @xmath177 and determine the @xmath178-lifetime @xmath65 as a function of @xmath107 .",
    "the result is plotted in fig .",
    "4(b ) of the main article .",
    "we note that the decay of the cs atom number due to cs - cs - cs three - body losses is in general slower than the decay of the bec fraction . to maintain a stable cs mi state over the course of the @xmath179  ms that the atoms spend at high values for @xmath31 during the mixing process ( see section experimental timing ) the mixing lattice depth @xmath64 has to be at least @xmath155  @xmath25 ( diamond in fig .",
    "below that value a significant reduction in the rbcs molecule production efficiency is observed ( see fig .",
    "4(a ) ) .",
    "we check that we produce a relatively clean single - atom mi shell by using a technique described in ref .",
    "the lattice depth along the vertical axis is lowered to @xmath52  @xmath25 to allow the atoms to tunnel and a potential tilt along this axis is applied adiabatically .",
    "when the tilt per lattice site approaches the cs on - site interaction @xmath180 a quantum phase transition is driven to a density - wave ordered state where every other lattice site along the tilt axis is occupied by a cs - cs atom pair .",
    "the cs pairs are associated to weakly bound cs@xmath2 molecules by means of a magnetic cs feshbach resonance to determine the number of cs pairs that were formed this way .",

    "<S> there is a steep edge at @xmath55  @xmath16 . </S>",
    "<S> the reason for this edge is not entirely clear , but it coincides with the resonance condition @xmath56 , where @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) is the hubbard onsite interaction energy @xcite for rb - cs ( rb - rb ) atom pairs . when this condition is fulfilled , a rb atom can resonantly tunnel onto a site occupied by a rb - cs atom pair . </S>",
    "<S> this should lead to enhanced rb - rb - cs three - body loss in the course of the overlap procedure . to test this hypothesis , </S>",
    "<S> we have performed an experiment in which we first prepare rb - cs atom pairs as discussed before at optimal efficiency , but without the subsequent step of feshbach association . </S>",
    "<S> instead , we hold the atom pairs for @xmath51  ms at various values for @xmath48 . during this time , rb atoms , although with low mobility , are able to tunnel . </S>",

    "<S> we test how the molecule production efficiency depends on the final lattice depth @xmath53 . for this </S>",
    "<S> , we raise the lattice to a value in the range between @xmath60  @xmath28 ( no raise ) and @xmath61  @xmath28 ( at full laser power available ) with a linear ramp as before and we again determine @xmath42 . </S>",

    "<S> the error bars reflect the standard error . ]    finally , we address the question how quickly the two samples can be merged . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , a fast merger is desirable in order to reduce the effect of loss processes as a result of three - body recombination or heating processes due to laser - intensity noise and beam - pointing instabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we vary the speed @xmath70 at which we steer the rb dipole trap towards and onto the cs sample and then determine @xmath42 as before . the data , as a function of mixing lattice depth @xmath63 respectively </S>",
    "<S> @xmath64 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) . for a given @xmath70 , as @xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> is increased , the mixing process first becomes more efficient , but then experiences an abrupt breakdown at specific values @xmath71 that we determine by error - function fits to the data @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for sufficiently low speeds ( see e.g.  the data for @xmath72  @xmath73 ) the efficiency saturates before it experiences the breakdown . </S>",
    "<S> we can explain the reduction of efficiency towards lower @xmath63 by a reduced lifetime of the cs mi state . </S>",
    "<S> a measurement of this lifetime at @xmath74 g , corresponding to @xmath67  @xmath16 , is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](b ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> below about @xmath75  @xmath25 , corresponding to @xmath76  @xmath28 , the lifetime is significantly reduced , in agreement with the loss of efficiency below the same value as found in the data shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig4](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we note that the cs mi lifetime is much higher at lower values for @xmath31 respectively @xmath35 at which we produce the cs bec .    </S>",
    "<S> we attribute the breakdown at higher values of @xmath63 to a breakdown of the rb superfluid current @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a given depth @xmath63 thus defines a critical transport speed @xmath68 . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig4](a ) as a function of @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> higher values of @xmath63 determine a lower @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> simple linear extrapolation of our data towards larger values of @xmath63 gives a zero critical speed at @xmath77  @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> fig .  </S>",

    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> evidently , our data is significantly below this prediction . </S>",
    "<S> note that shifting the theory curve horizontally by @xmath69  @xmath28 gives very good agreement . </S>",
    "<S> we have no explanation for the discrepancy between our data and the theory prediction . </S>",
    "<S> we note that for the data shown e.g.  in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig3](a ) we have chosen a transport speed that is significantly below the critical speed , as indicted by the diamond in fig .  [ </S>",
    "<S> fig4](c ) .    </S>",
    "<S> evidently , our mixing procedure can be improved in various ways . </S>",
    "<S> most obviously a higher lattice depth at the end of the mixing procedure will enhance the localization of rb atoms to individual lattice sites and hence increase the pair formation probability . increasing the speed for superfluid transport will reduce the time over which three - body loss processes take place . </S>",
    "<S> finally , reducing the initial distance between the two atomic samples will reduce the distance over which superfluid transport for rb has to be carried out . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , one should place two pancake - shaped becs directly parallel to each other and then merge the two samples along the tightly confined direction .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we have formed a low - entropy sample of bosonic rbcs feshbach molecules in an optical lattice . </S>",
    "<S> the entropy per molecule can be estimated to @xmath78 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> note that this is an upper bound , as we , at this point , can only give a lower bound on the lattice filling fraction . </S>",
    "<S> the molecules can now be transferred by stirap to the electronic and rovibrational ground state for the generation of a low - entropy dipolar quantum gas . in a previous publication , though starting from a different feshbach level , we were able to demonstrate 90% stirap transfer efficiency @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this efficiency was limited by the comparatively large extent of the thermal sample with respect to the beam waists of the stirap laser beams . </S>",
    "<S> we expect that this efficiency can now be pushed towards 100% given the much more localized samples . </S>",
    "<S> when in the ground state and polarized by an external electric field , the dynamics of the gas will then be dominated by nearest - neighbor interactions with interaction strength on the order of @xmath79  khz . </S>",
    "<S> this will allow us to study important problems in quantum many - body physics , such as the phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model extended by a long - range interaction term @xcite .    </S>",
