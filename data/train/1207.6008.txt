    "in classical data transmission , repeaters are used to amplify the data signals ( bits ) when they become weaker during their propagation .",

    "a qubit is typically encoded by a single photon which can not be amplified or cloned without destroying quantum coherence associated with this qubit @xcite .",
    "therefore , the photon has to propagate along the entire length of the fiber , which causes an exponentially decreasing probability to receive this photon at the end of the channel .    to avoid this exponential decay of a photon wave - packet and",

    "this repeater can be divided in three building - blocks which have to be applied sequentially .",

    "are distilled from a larger set of low - fidelity entangled pairs by means of local operations performed in each of the repeater nodes and classical communication between these nodes .",
    "the entanglement swapping , finally , combines two entangled pairs of neighboring segments into one entangled pair , gradually increasing the distance of shared entanglement .    because of the fragile nature of quantum correlations and inevitable photon loss in the transmission channel , in practice , it poses a serious challenge to outperform the direct transmission of photons along the fiber . up to now",

    "moreover , various revised and improved implementations of repeaters and their building - blocks have been recently proposed @xcite .",
    "practical schemes for implementing a quantum repeater are not straightforward .",
    "the two mentioned protocols , entanglement purification and entanglement swapping , in general , require feasible and reliable quantum logic , such as single- and two - qubit gates . because of the high complexity and demand of physical resources , entanglement purification is the most delicate and cumbersome part of a quantum repeater .",
    "the conventional purification protocols @xcite , moreover , involve multiple controlled - not ( cnot ) gates which pose a serious challenge for most physical realizations of qubits , involving complicated pulse sequences and superfluous qubit operations @xcite .",

    ", the mentioned effect of entanglement transfer originates the constructive and destructive interference of the quantized spin waves ( magnons ) in an evolving spin chain ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the main physical resources of the proposed purification scheme are : ( i ) short chains of atoms , ( ii ) two high - finesse optical cavities , and ( iii ) detectors for projective measurements of atomic states . in fig .",
    "[ fig1](d ) we show the experimental setup of a quantum repeater segment that includes two neighboring nodes ( a and b ) . in this setup , each repeater node consists of one optical cavity @xmath51 ( @xmath52 ) acting along the @xmath53-axis , a laser beam @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) , a chain of atoms transported by means of an optical lattice along the same axis , one stationary atom trapped inside the cavity with the help of a vertical lattice , laser beam @xmath56 ( @xmath57 ) acting along the @xmath53-axis , a magneto - optical trap ( mot ) , and a ccd camera connected to the neighboring node through a classical communication channel .",

    "[ fig1](d ) , this identification implies that atoms pass sequentially through the cavity , such that only two atoms from the chain couple simultaneously to the same cavity mode .",
    "these two atoms together with the stationary ( trapped ) atom form an atomic triplet in each repeater node as assumed by our purification scheme .",
    "right before an atom from node a enters the cavity , it becomes entangled with the respective atom from node b as depicted in fig .",

    "this entanglement is generated non - locally by means of an entanglement distribution block ( indicated by a rectangle ) , such that each produced entangled pair is described by eq .",
    "( [ density1 ] ) in the qubit - storage basis @xmath7 . during the transition of an atomic pair through the cavity",
    ", the triplet of atoms has to undergo the cavity - mediated evolution governed by the hamiltonian ( [ ham - xy ] ) in each of the repeater nodes over the time period ( [ time ] ) .",
    "since the hamiltonian acts solely on the cavity - active states @xmath28 , the atomic population has to be mapped from the qubit - storage basis to the cavity - active basis in order to make possible the interaction of atoms with the cavity mode and , moreover , to protect the qubits against the decoherence caused by the fast - decaying excited state @xmath13 .",
    "this mapping is realized using short resonant light pulses produced by the laser beam @xmath54 ( @xmath55 ) .",

    "the ccd camera is used to detect the presence of remaining atoms via fluorescence imaging and determine , therefore , the state of each atom that leaves the cavity .    in the successful case ,",
    "furthermore , the next atomic pair is transported into the cavity and the next purification round takes place with the same stationary atom ( permanent qubit ) . in the unsuccessful case , however ,",
    "the stationary atoms have to be reinitialized and the entire sequence from fig .",
    "[ fig1](a ) should be restarted .",

    "[ fig2](a ) , the output fidelity @xmath59 ( dashed curve ) obtained after three successful purification rounds is still far from unit fidelity as required by a realistic quantum repeater . in fact , this output fidelity enables one to perform only a few swapping operations between the purified entangled pairs of neighboring repeater segments until the fidelity of the resulting pair ( distributed over a larger distance ) drops to the initial fidelity @xmath2 .",

    "we generate two ( separate ) entangled pairs and let them be conveyed through the cavity @xmath51 ( @xmath63 ) , such that the ( probabilistic ) entanglement protocol that produces the four - qubit state ( [ density3 ] ) is switched off .",
    "it can be shown that a successful purification round with these two entangled pairs transforms the state of the permanent atoms ( prepared initially in the ground state ) into an entangled state described by @xmath119 with @xmath120 where @xmath121 , @xmath122 are the only non - zero coefficients .",

    "[ fig4](c ) , the solid curve describing ( [ off - diag ] ) deviates slightly around the constant value of @xmath129 . to a good approximation , therefore , the off - diagonal contribution @xmath69 can be neglected and the resulting density operator takes the form of the rank - two mixed state ( [ density1 ] ) .",
    "we have verified , moreover , that the output fidelity ( [ final7 ] ) ( almost ) coincides with the output fidelity ( @xmath130 ) displayed in fig .",

    "this scheme is a modification of the purification scheme proposed in our previous paper @xcite that exploits the natural evolution of spin chains instead of cnot gates .",
    "similar to the original scheme , the modified scheme uses a cavity - qed framework , namely ( i ) short chains of atoms , ( ii ) high - finesse optical cavities , and ( iii ) detectors for the projective measurement of atomic states .",
    "in contrast to the original scheme , however , one additional entanglement protocol was introduced in each repeater node , and the laser beams which are used to control the entire scheme were optimized . with the help of these modifications ,",
    "an almost unit output fidelity was achieved after the same number of successful purification rounds as in the original scheme .",
    "similar to the original paper , furthermore , the modified scheme was supplied with a detailed experimental setup , and a complete description of all necessary steps and manipulations has been given .",
    "a comprehensive analysis of fidelities obtained after multiple purification rounds was performed and the optimal number of rounds was determined .",
    "we also discussed in detail the initial distribution of entanglement between the stationary qubits trapped in two remote cavities .    throughout the paper , we assumed that each purification round is finalized successfully leading to a gradual growth ( [ seq3 ] ) or ( [ seq5 ] ) of entanglement fidelity . in the case of an unsuccessful purification event ,",
    "i.e. , when the outcomes of the projective measurement disagree with ( [ outcome ] ) , the stationary atoms should be reinitialized and the entire scheme restarted . since the probability to get the two ( out of @xmath131 ) combinations of projective measurements for a successful purification is rather small , the occurrence of multiple unsuccessful events can require a large amount of atomic pairs in the chain and unreasonable operational times .",
    "we stress , therefore , that although the proposed purification scheme is experimentally feasible , a practical mechanism that reduces unsuccessful purification events has to be considered . this problem and possible solutions",
    "shall be addressed in our future work .",
    "the high - fidelity purification scheme proposed in this paper enables one to perform multiple entanglement swapping operations and thus opens a route towards an efficient and experimentally feasible quantum repeater for long - distance quantum communication .",

    "afterwards , the light pulse propagates to node b , where it interacts with the second coupled atom - cavity system and accumulates another phase conditioned upon the atomic state in this node .",
