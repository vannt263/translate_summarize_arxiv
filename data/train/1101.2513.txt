    "a much wilder transition is observed in wall - bounded shear flows for which the laminar and turbulent regimes are both possible states at intermediate values of the reynolds number @xmath0 , the natural control parameter , whereas no linear instability mechanism is effective .",
    "a direct transition can take then place via the coexistence of laminar and turbulent domains in physical space .",
    "two emblematic cases are the pipe flow and plane couette flow ( pcf ) , the simple shear flow developing between two parallel plates translating in opposite directions .",
    "both of them are stable against infinitesimal perturbations for all values of @xmath0 and become turbulent only provided sufficiently strong perturbations are present . in both cases , strong hysteresis is observed and , upon decreasing @xmath0 , the turbulent state can be maintained down to a value @xmath1 . above @xmath1 , turbulence remains localised in space , in the form of turbulent puffs in pipe flow and turbulent patches in pcf .",

    ". it can be obtained by decreasing the reynolds number continuously from featureless turbulence below , the reynolds number above which the flow is uniformly turbulent , or triggered from laminar flow by finite amplitude perturbations above , the reynolds number below which laminar flow is expected to prevail in the long time limit .",
    "a similar situation is observed in pipe flow but things are complicated by the global downstream advection so that the existence of a threshold @xmath2 above which turbulence is uniform is still a debated matter .",
    "in contrast for pcf , the pattern is essentially time - independent and can be characterised by two wavelengths @xmath3 and @xmath4 in the streamwise and spanwise direction , @xmath5 and @xmath6 respectively , or equivalently by a wavevector @xmath7 with @xmath8 . from symmetry considerations ,",

    "the price to be paid for the resolution lowering was apparently just a downward shift of the range @xmath35 $ ] in which the bands are obtained , but everything else was preserved , including wavelengths .",

    "the spatial organisation of the pattern is detected _ via _ the fourier transform of the perturbation velocity field @xmath43 .",
    "it turns out that most of the information about the modulation is encoded in the amplitude of the dominant wavenumber @xcite .",

    "beforehand , we have to define a systematic method to detect the beginning and the end of pure pattern episodes from the @xmath66 time series .",

    "an average of these three values will be used to define the mean lifetime and the corresponding unbiased standard deviation will give an estimate of the `` error '' for each lifetime series .",

    "@xmath77 displays a clear plateau as a functions of @xmath67 .",
    "the width of this plateau does not depend on @xmath68 though its value depends on it .",
    "the existence of this plateau is easily seen to be related to the fast growth of @xmath62 when the pattern sets in : @xmath62 always goes through most of the values corresponding to the plateau in a very short time . in practice , for @xmath80 the very same episodes are detected whatever the precise value of @xmath67 . that the plateau value still depends on @xmath68 just expresses that the duration of the detected episodes are modified in the same way due to changes in the detection of their termination .",
    "of course , when @xmath67 is taken too large , some less - well ordered episodes escape detection or are detected too late , which artificially decreases the mean .",
    "on the other hand , if @xmath67 is taken too small , the `` signal '' gets lost in the `` noise '' : a large number of brief noisy excursions are detected as relevant ordered episodes , again decreasing the mean .",
    "the variation of the mean lifetime with @xmath68 is completely different as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ( right ) .",
    "here , @xmath77 varies roughly linearly with @xmath68 in a wide interval above the noise level ( @xmath81 , see fig .",

    "coefficient @xmath82 does not vary significantly over the cases that we have considered .",

    "coefficient @xmath83 , corresponding to @xmath77 extrapolated toward @xmath84 however still depend on @xmath0 and the geometry .",
    "henceforth , we define this extrapolated value as the relevant average lifetime @xmath77 , which will be supported by the theoretical considerations to be developed in the next section .    the observed dependence of @xmath77 on @xmath68 can be explained by the fact that the decay of a pure pattern is much more gradual than its growth , which causes significant differences when the duration of an episode is measured , leading to a decrease of @xmath77 as @xmath68 increases since the termination of the episode is detected earlier . a second reason why the mean lifetime increases as @xmath68 decreases arises from the fact that some excursions are not counted as decay events .",
    "in physical space , this corresponds to an irregular and slow disorganisation of turbulence , contrasting with the fast installation of the pattern .",

    "it also shows that , especially when @xmath131 is larger but comparable to @xmath130 , the noise energy has to remain small enough because the parabolic approximation which underlies the formula assumes sufficiently deep wells . the main difference between the one and two dimensions cases are in the shape of the `` energy landscape '' ,",
    "corrections are therefore expected to be multiplicative and not depend on the value of @xmath166 .      for the deterministic part of equation ( [ lan ] ) we use a simple first - order implicit euler algorithm , while the additive noise @xmath167 is treated as a gaussian random variable with standard deviation @xmath168 at each time step .",
    "the model is integrated over a range of @xmath148 , given @xmath130 , @xmath131 ( several values ) , and @xmath132 ( assumed constant ) .",
    "the time series of @xmath169 displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] are indeed reminiscent of those obtained by numerical integration of navier  stokes equations ( figs .",
    "[ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) : pure states at the bottom of the wells correspond to @xmath170 fluctuating around  0 and @xmath171 away from  0 , or the reverse .",
    "large excursions can lead to a change of the dominant orientation .",
    "these excursions are more likely to occur when @xmath148 is decreased .",
    "lifetimes have been computed in the same way as for fig .",
    "the dependence of the mean lifetimes on thresholds  @xmath172 is displayed in figure  [ fig9 ] .",
    "a neat plateau is obtained for @xmath173 $ ] for different values of @xmath68 ( fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] , left ) , which corresponds to the trajectory getting away from the saddle .",
    "extremes values of @xmath67 lead to bad estimates of @xmath120 for the same reasons as stated before .",
    "as to threshold @xmath68 , an orientation change has taken place when the trajectory goes beyond the saddle , while a pure state corresponds to one amplitude large and the other at the noise level .",
    "we have thus to detect the change from large to small for one or the other amplitude .",
    "it is extremely difficult to detect the precise passage at the saddle , since it is dominated by the time spent in that region , contribution from the two sides of the saddle point having the same weight . on the contrary",
    "the passage from one state to another leaves no doubt as to its definition .",
    "therefore , we prefer to compute the mean first passage time from one well to another , which is obtained in our simulation by the extrapolation at @xmath84 . approximating the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] ( right ) by linear functions @xmath174 , one finds that the slope @xmath175 depends on @xmath148 and @xmath67 only weakly ; the value of @xmath120 retained is then the one given by the extrapolation @xmath84 , i.e. coefficient @xmath83 . improving the definition of @xmath120 with approximations better than the linear one has not been found necessary .",
    "the general expression of the mean first passage time gives no hint as to the quantitative behaviour on the distance to the second well @xmath68 , although it shows the same qualitative behaviour as seen in figures  [ fig6 ] ( right ) and  [ fig9 ] ( right ) . in figure  [ fig10 ] ( semilog coordinates ) , the lifetime @xmath120 measured in this way is compared to the asymptotic expression from the theory ( [ ttau ] ) as a function of @xmath148 .",
    "it can be seen that the asymptotic formula is not valid for the smallest values of @xmath148 , when the wells are not longer deep enough for the approximation to be valid , similarly to what is found in the dns close to @xmath2 .",
    "the values given by this formula for small values of @xmath166 , especially around and below the minimum it predicts at @xmath176 , can not be trusted . for large @xmath148 ,",
    "the lifetime computed from the simulation saturates because it becomes of the order of the total integration time so that only a few events smaller than this total time can be recorded .",
    "accordingly the long time tail of the distribution is badly sampled with an under - representation of lifetimes larger than the average expected from the theory . in fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] , the numerical and the asymptotic estimates of the mean lifetimes are seen to differ by a constant of order unity , which is attributed to the one - dimensional character of the approximation .",
    "this approach can be extended to wavelength fluctuations . when the size @xmath177 of the system is such that it ` hesitates ' between two pairs of modes @xmath140 and @xmath178 , we introduce two supplementary amplitudes @xmath179 that we denote @xmath180 for short and , extending notations straightforwardly with primes for quantities related to @xmath180 , we arrive at : _ 0a_=a_-g_1|a_|^2a_-g_2|a_|^2a_+ g_3 ( |b_|^2+|b_|^2 ) a_+ _ , [ lan1 ] + _",
    "0b_= b_-g_1|b_|^2b_-g_2|b_|^2b_+ g_3 ( |a_|^2+|a_|^2 ) b_+_[lan2 ] , where @xmath148 and @xmath181 as well as the nonlinear coupling constants @xmath182 , @xmath183 and even the effective noise intensities @xmath132 , @xmath184 may differ since they relate to pure patterns with different @xmath185 .",
    "a first guess would be to assume the primed and non - primed variables equal , which would bring us immediately back to the previous approach with an effective potential , wells , saddles , and potential barriers , leading to estimates for the different lifetimes involved .",
    "it is not clear how the case of turbulence re - entrance ( the intermittent regime of @xcite ) would fit this framework but it is well described by a pdf with three peaks @xcite corresponding to a probability potential with three wells and thus hopefully amenable to a similar treatment with a similar output .",
    "these generalisations have not been worked out in detail numerically since they introduces a discouragingly large number of parameters to be fitted against the experiments and from which we would learn little , owing to their phenomenological basis .",
    "only the case involving a single pair of modes was examined in  [ ms ] above , mostly in order to validate the procedure followed to determine lifetimes in  [ slc ] .",
    "in this paper , numerical simulations of the navier  stokes equation in plane couette flow configuration have been performed in a range of reynolds numbers where the transition to turbulence happens in the form of oblique bands .",
    "systems with sizes fitting a few elementary cells @xmath186 of the pattern have been considered .",
    "these sizes are much larger than the minimal flow unit which allows the reduction of the transition problem to a temporal process familiar to chaos theory @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the considered systems are able to display the first manifestations of a genuinely spatiotemporal dynamics _ via _ patterning . following the patterns in time",
    ", we showed that they experience orientation and wavelength fluctuations in the upper part of the range of transitional reynolds numbers @xmath187 $ ] .",
    "a systematic procedure to detect the start and the termination of well - oriented episodes was defined , leading to the observation of exponentially decreasing distributions for their lifetimes ( fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) .",
    "a consistent interpretation scheme was then provided by adapting the noisy ginzburg  landau model proposed in @xcite to our case , transforming the original stochastic pde into a landau  langevin stochastic ode .",
    "besides supporting the procedure used to determine lifetimes , the approach directly leads to the determination of probability distributions for the patterned states from the shape of the potential obtained by solving the corresponding fokker ",
    "planck equation , as already suggested in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "the variation of the patterns mean lifetimes is thus linked to the relative distance to threshold and noise intensity through an asymptotic formula involving the `` energy '' barrier between wells corresponding to the different well - oriented states in competition .",
    "ingredients in the relative distance to threshold @xmath148 which is a function of both the reynolds number and the optimal wavelength , are amply sufficient to explain most of the dependance of the mean lifetimes as functions of @xmath0 , @xmath42 , and the spontaneous appearance of defects separating patches of well - oriented patterns close enough to  in larger aspect - ratio systems as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig13 ] and seen in the experiments @xcite .     in order to explain the occurrence of exponentially decreasing lifetime distributions , the theory of dynamical systems appeals to the sensitivity to initial conditions of trajectories visiting a homoclinic tangle  @xcite . here",
    ", the modelling that fits well our observations implies that exponential distributions arise from some jump random process @xcite .",
    "as soon as the size of the system is much larger that the minimal flow unit ( for which the temporal behaviour inherent in low dimensional dynamical systems is relevant ) , a spatiotemporal perspective becomes in order , and the jumps in question can easily be associated to the local chaotic dynamics of pieces of streaks and streamwise vortices involved in the self sustaining process of turbulence @xcite .",
    "this local chaotic dynamics would then be responsible for the wandering of the global system through some `` energy '' landscape with wells and saddles . with system sizes of the order of the elementary pattern cell @xmath186 , this wandering amounts to orientation and/or wavelength changes .",
    "extending these views to larger systems would then explain the statistical properties of fluctuating laminar - turbulent patches observed in the upper transitional range close enough to @xcite .    whereas the origin of the noise introduced in the description is understandable from chaos at the local ( microscopic ) scale",
    ", it remains however to understand why the coexistence of laminar and turbulent flow takes the form of oblique bands at the global ( macroscopic ) scale , i.e. to justify the ginzburg ",
