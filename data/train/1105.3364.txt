    "localized modes on nonlinear lattices have been a topic of wide theoretical and experimental investigation in a wide range of areas over the past two decades .",
    "this can be seen , e.g. , in the recent general review @xcite , as well as inferred from the topical reviews in nonlinear optics @xcite , atomic physics @xcite and biophysics @xcite where relevant discussions have been given of the theory and corresponding applications .",
    "one of the areas in which the theoretical analysis has been especially successful in describing experimental data and providing insights has been that of granular crystals @xcite .",
    "these consist of closely - packed chains of elastically interacting particles , typically according to the so - called hertz contact law .",
    "the broad interest in this area has emerged due to the wealth of available material types / sizes ( for which the hertzian interactions are applicable ) and the ability to tune the dynamic response of the crystals to encompass linear , weakly nonlinear , and strongly nonlinear regimes @xcite .",
    "this type of flexibility renders these crystals perfect candidates for many engeenering applications , including shock and energy absorbing layers @xcite , actuating devices @xcite , and sound scramblers @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that another aspect of such systems that is of particular appeal is their potential ( and controllable ) heterogeneity which gives rise to the potential not only for modified solitary wave excitations @xcite , but also for discrete breather ones @xcite .",
    "another motivation for looking at waves in such lattices stems from fpu type problems @xcite . in the prototypical fpu context",
    ", it has been rigorously proved that traveling waves exist which can be controllably approximated ( in the appropriate weakly supersonic limit ) by solitary waves of the korteweg - de vries equation @xcite . however , in more strongly nonlinear regimes , compact - like excitations have been argued to exist @xcite ( see also @xcite for breather type excitations ) and have even been computed numerically through iterative schemes @xcite , but have not been rigorously proved to exist in the general case . in the work of @xcite ,",
    "the special hertzian case was adapted appropriately to fit the assumptions of the variational - methods based proof of the traveling wave existence theorem of @xcite in order to establish these solutions .",
    "however the proof does not give information on the wave profile .",
    "our aim herein is to provide a reformulation and illustration of existence of `` bell - shaped '' traveling waves in generalized hertzian lattices .",
    "our work is based on the iterative schemes that have been previously presented in @xcite for the computation of traveling waves in such chains of the form : @xmath3_+^p - [ v_n - v_{n+1}]_+^p . \\label{eqn1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath4 denotes the displacement of the n - th bead from its equilibrium position .",
    "the special case of hertzian contacts is for @xmath2 , but we consider here the general case of nonlinear interactions with @xmath5 . notice that the `` + '' subscript in the equations indicates that that the quantity in the bracket is only evaluated if positive , while it is set to @xmath6 , if negative ( reflecting in the latter case the absence of contact between the beads ) .",
    "the construction of the traveling waves and the derivation of their monotonicity properties will be based on the strain variant of the equation for @xmath7 such that : @xmath8_+^p - 2 [ u_n]_+^p + [ u_{n-1}]_+^p , \\label{eqn2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    our presentation will proceed as follows . in section 2",

    "when seeking traveling wave solutions of the form @xmath9 , we are led to the advance - delay equation ( setting @xmath10 ) @xmath11 where @xmath12 is a smooth and positive function , with the desired monotonicity involving decay in @xmath13 and increase in @xmath14 .",

    "in particular , @xmath51 hence , as was originally discussed in @xcite and then more rigorously considered in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , the solutions of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] feature a doubly exponential decay .",
    "this very fast decay ( and nearly compact shape ) of the pulses can be clearly discerned in the semi - logarithmic plots of the figure .    as a slight",
    "aside to the present considerations , we should mention that a physically relevant variant of the problem consists of the presence of a finite precompression force @xmath52 at the end of the chain @xcite . in that case , the model of interest becomes ( in the strain formulation and with @xmath53 ) @xmath54_+^p - 2 [ \\delta_0 + u_n]_+^p + [ \\delta_0 + u_{n-1}]_+^p , \\label{eqn2_mod } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the case of @xmath55 constitutes the so - called sonic vacuum @xcite , while that of finite @xmath56 features a finite speed of sound ( and allows the existence and propagation of linear spectrum excitations ) .",
    "it is worthy then to notice that for @xmath57 , the above decay estimate is modified as : @xmath58 namely , the solutions are no longer doubly exponentially localized but rather feature an exponential tail ( and are progressively closer to regular solitary waves ) .",

    "we equip this with the usual topology of a frechet space , generated by a family of seminorms @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is some fixed nested family of compact sets , so that @xmath65 .",

    "one may also define a convolution of a distribution @xmath69 with a given @xmath61 function @xmath70 , by @xmath71 .",
    "we say that two distributions are in the relation @xmath72 in @xmath66 sense , if for all @xmath73 , we have @xmath74 .",
    "in particular ,    [ defi:1 ] we say that a distribution @xmath75 is non - increasing ( non - decreasing ) over a set @xmath62 , if @xmath76 ( @xmath77 ) in @xmath66 sense .    of course , if @xmath75 happens to have a locally integrable derivative @xmath78 on an interval , then the notion of non - increasing function coincides with the standard ( pointwise ) notion by the fundamental theorem of calculus .",
    "more generally , we have the following    [ le : p ] suppose that @xmath75 is a locally integrable function in @xmath79 and it satisfies @xmath77 ( @xmath76 ) in @xmath80 sense .",

    "it is well - known by the lebesgue differentiation theorem that for a locally integrable function @xmath75 , one has @xmath84",
    "@xmath85 all such points @xmath86 are called lebesgue points for @xmath75 . denote this full measure set by @xmath87 .",

    "we find the following trick useful , which allows us to reduce non - increasing / non - decreasing distrubutions to non - increasing / non - decreasing functions .",
