    "progress in metamaterial design , from microwaves to thz and optical frequencies @xcite , based on the magnetic response of arrays of wires and split ring resonators ( srr ) and their modifications to shorter electromagnetic waves , shows as essential limitations the existence of anisotropy and large absorption losses @xcite .",
    "more recently , alternative structures based on mie scattering by dielectric spheres @xcite of relative large refractive index were extensively studied and proposed as models of lossless composites at microwaves ; these were also extended to semiconductor cylinders and spheres , which were proven to possess similar resonant characteristics in the infrared and visible regions @xcite .",
    "although initially these latter structures relied on only the electric dipole or on multipole modes , later the possibility of exciting the first mie magnetic dipole resonance was realized ; which makes these particles equivalent from a fundamental point of view to the microwave wire and srr elements as far as their electric and magnetic responses are concerned .",
    "moreover , these cylinders and spheres provide isotropy 2d and 3d in addition to their resonance being subwavelength , both for the electric and magnetic excited dipoles .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the transmittance properties of media composed of these dielectric particles and in particular , whether they behave as uniform media at frequencies where their electric and magnetic dipoles are excited .",
    "therefore this work is a test and assessment of whether the excitation of electric and magnetic resonances of high index mie spheres and cylinders constitutes an alternative with low losses and high refractive transmittivity , to previously developed metamaterial models .    in this connection",
    ", we emphasize that in spite of the exhaustive studies on the possibilities of these resonant particles as metamaterial building blocks in @xcite and references therein , no such a test has been carried out .",
    "although a unified view of the effective refractive index of metamaterials made of ordered arrays of such particles , as well as of photonic crystals ( pc ) producing negative refraction @xcite was established @xcite , the characterization of these composites as effective homogeneous media to the propagating wave has generally employed the method of the scattering ( s ) parameter by inversion of the complex transmittances and reflectances @xcite .",
    "then , it remained the question of whether the effective constitutive parameters @xmath0 and @xmath1 derived from effective medium homogenization procedures commonly employed @xcite , were the same as those obtained by those methods that took into account the wave interaction with the microstructure of the composite unit cell .",
    "the answer , recently given @xcite , is negative . _",
    "the linear dimension of such unit cells , which is typically between @xmath2 and @xmath3 , is a much larger number than those of atom or molecule arrangements in transparent dielectrics acting to the pass of light_. in fact , the maximum lattice constant versus wavelength for a metamaterial to behave as an uniform effective medium in negative refraction experiments , was established in @xcite .",
    "therefore , one may ask whether reducing absorption of the composite , like with these mie resonances of dielectric spheres and cylinders , is sufficient to achieving an application as a metamaterial which may be considered as a refractive element .    to this end , we shall see in this paper that , although contrary to metal elements like those of earlier left - handed material ( lhm ) designs , these dielectric cylinders and spheres grouped as \" meta - atoms of composites do not present absorption , their scattering cross section is quite large . therefore , _ we will demonstrate that this time the losses of light transmission come from their large extinction cross section due to scattering , which moreover , when random arrangements of these particles are also addressed , yields a rather short transport mean free path , even if the medium is homogenized , and hence the transmittivity of a propagating beam through these media is low_.    as a 2-d equivalent to spheres , both ceramic @xcite and of silicon @xcite , rod array composites were suggested to exhibit metamaterial left - handed behaviour in the microwave and in the visible to mid - infrared ( ir ) ranges , respectively , due to the excitation of the cylinder magnetic mie resonance . however , further studies pointed out @xcite the necessity of _ more research to short out whether the backward wave behavior inside a periodic array of such si cylinders is due to the band structure in the diffraction regime @xcite or to a pure left - handed effect in the long wavelength range _ , even though experiments of microwaves in prisms of large permittivity ceramic rod arrays , either ordered or random , suggested a left - handed behavior @xcite .    the typical filling fraction @xmath4 of the studied dielectric cylinder arrays @xcite is moderate @xmath5 , but the wavelength in vacuum to rod radius ratio : @xmath6 was @xmath7 in e. g. the experiment of @xcite ( @xmath8 ) , the lattice constant @xmath9 to @xmath10 ratio being 0.07 , which is well below the aforementioned ratio @xmath11 ; whereas @xmath12 and @xmath13 in the model of the ordered si cylinders of @xcite ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "on the other hand , the equivalent homogeneous media obtained from snell law had an index of negative refraction @xmath15 for the pc slab of @xcite and @xmath16 for the pc prism of @xcite , ( @xmath17 for the case of @xcite , whereas @xmath18 for @xcite , @xmath19 ) .",
    "none of these values is maintained when one changes the sample geometry , as we shall prove in this paper .    in the homogenization procedure employed in the ceramic composite of @xcite ,",
    "the effective parameters obtained in the band of left - handed behaviour have negative values both for the real part of the magnetic permeability , @xmath20 , as for that of the dielectric permittivity , @xmath21 , with @xmath22 .",
    "however , near the resonance wavelength , the imaginary parts @xmath23 and @xmath24 of both constitutive parameters are non - negligible compared to those real parts ; _ this conveys high extinction by the composite material , which is not due to absorption losses as in previous models of lhms composed of metallic elements , but produced by scattering from the high index particles of these metamaterials_. the same happens in the near ir for the composite material of si cylinders @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this will be further studied in this work .    in this paper",
    "we carry out 2 - d numerical experiments with the finite element method ( fem ) of propagation , of mid - ir waves , through a composite medium made of dielectric rods either in periodic or random positions .",
    "nonetheless , for the sake of comprehensiveness , we shall also address the related problem of microwave propagation at larger scales . from the above discussion",
    ", our aim is to assess for the first time to what extent these structures may constitute a metamaterial model that overcomes the losses @xcite of previous composites .",
    "this conveys to discuss the validity of establishing effective constitutive parameters .",
    "the results should closely predict laboratory experimental observations because the calculations involved are exact . since in this model",
    "the size of the samples are not huge compared to the wavelength @xcite , in order to assess whether the propagation depends or not on this size and on the shape of the sample , we employ two of such bodies for observing transmission : a rectangular block , or thick slab , and a prism , ( i. e. in the 2-d calculations the latter being a triangle ) , composed of either a periodic or a disordered array of rods in air . like in previous studies on these composites ,",
    "the incident wave is assumed to be linearly polarized with electric vector @xmath25 along the cylinder axes .",
    "maxwell equations are solved by using a finite element method ( fe ) ( femlab of comsol , ) .",
    "the calculation domain is meshed with element growth rate : 1.55 , meshing curvature factor : 0.65 , approximately .",
    "the geometrical resolution parameters consist of 25 points per boundary segment to take into account curved geometries in order to adapt the finite elements to the geometry and optimize the convergence of the solution .",
    "the final mesh contains about @xmath26 elements . to solve helmholtz equation ,",
    "the umfpack direct is employed .",
    "the boundary conditions of the simulation space are established both to keep the calculations from undesired window reflections and to avoid possible geometrical discontinuities .",
    "we then ensure that no inconsistencies due to properties discontinuities of the objets under study appear , and possible systematic errors are avoided .    in the 2 - d configuration ,",
    "light depolarization is prevented by launching linearly polarized light with propagation vector in the xy - plane of the cylinder cross sections .",
    "beam profiles are either , rectangular ( plane waves ) : @xmath27 , their widths being that of the simulation window , or gaussian : @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 and @xmath31 are the transversal components of @xmath32 and @xmath33 , respectively , @xmath34 is the standard deviation or beam waist , and @xmath35 is the incident wave wavevector with latexmath:[${\\bf    shall address values either in the microwave or ir regions .",
    "the direction of propagation @xmath35 of such beams is thus normally incident to the oz - axis of the infinite cylinders .",
    "the incident wave amplitude is normalized to @xmath37 ( si ) , which corresponds to a magnitude of the time average energy flow @xmath38 .",
    "the criterium to choose the beam profile has been based on the major response of the composite characteristics to analyze : directionality of propagation in the media resulting from an homogenization method , and extinction processes when the inner structure of the rod distribution is considered . in the first case , we employ rectangular incident beams ; otherwise , we use gaussian beams .",
    "the results are thus expressed in terms of either the electric vector @xmath39 which points along the cylinder oz - axis , the squared root of its time - averaged energy @xmath40 , the magnetic vector @xmath41 or the time average energy flow @xmath42 .",
    "these latter two vectors of course being both transversal , namely , in the xy - plane of the images to show next .    finally , to classify the whispering gallery modes ( wgm ) associated to the mie resonances of the cylinders we will use the subscripts _",

    "no refracted beam into the air is observed , and a large portion of energy is lost by scattering from the composite elements .",
    "many outgoing beams mix with each other , so that no forwardly transmitted beam inside the prism , characterized by @xmath77 can be distinguished by averaging over several realizations of the random array . the apparent refracted beam at @xmath106 shown in the air side exiting the prism , changes as one varies the random realization of rods .",
    "in this paper we have assessed the transmittance of composites of dielectric particles whose mie resonance electric and magnetic modes were proposed by previous extensive studies to yield negative refraction .",
    "we have shown that such structures can not be homogenized neither reproduce the propagation observed in the frequency regions of study . in this way",
    ", we have proved that the negative refraction previously found in ordered arrays is thus a diffraction effect which disappears as soon as the particle distribution is randomized , and does not reproduce the transmission of their corresponding emt uniform media , this was an open question so far .",
    "in addition , we conclude , first , that the effective parameters obtained from a homogenization theory , do not reproduce the propagation observed through an ordered array of these elements .",
    "this is further seen when these arrays are randomized .",
    "if an emt worked , it should not depend on whether the meta - atom \" distributions were ordered or disordered",
    ". then strong scattering by disordered rods extinguishes most of the incident energy , and there is not negatively refracted forward beam observed .",
    "second , the behavior of the transmitted beam in ordered arrays also depends on the shape of the sample and hence does not match with an emt which does not include this shape .",
    "these conclusions are consistent with the well known _ difficulty of working out emts within the frequency range of resonance of the composite elements _ @xcite .",
