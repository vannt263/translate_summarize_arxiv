    "in the presence of a large perpendicular magnetic field , coulomb interactions between electrons confined to a two - dimensional plane compete with disorder in determining the system s physical properties . in the clean limit interactions dominate and give rise to a wealth of exotic collective states , including both compressible and incompressible quantum liquids , various solid phases , and quantum nematic liquid crystals @xcite",
    ". moreover , the relatively small spin zeeman energy in typical two - dimensional electron systems ( 2des ) can be so overwhelmed by these interactions that ground state spin configurations which defy simple pauli counting rules can be stabilized @xcite .",
    "these unusual spin configurations have been detected and studied experimentally by various means , including conventional electrical transport , photo - luminescence and inelastic light scattering , nuclear magnetic resonance , etc . @xcite .",
    "the effects of coulomb interactions on 2d electron systems at high magnetic field are most dramatically illustrated by the numerous fractional quantized hall effect states @xcite and the emergent gapless metallic phases of composite fermions ( cfs ) @xcite , all of which exist at specific fractional fillings of the landau levels created by the magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , these exotic phenomena actually represent relatively subtle variations in the strong electronic correlations that exist throughout the high field regime .",
    "for example , experiments @xcite have revealed a suppression of the zero bias conductance for electrons tunneling perpendicularly into the 2des over a wide range of high magnetic fields .",
    "this suppression of the tunneling conductance is observed regardless of whether the 2des is in a thermodynamically gapped or gapless phase , and extends over a range of voltages about the 2des fermi level @xcite .",
    "these observations are by now well understood @xcite to reflect a coulomb - interaction - induced pseudo - gap in the tunneling density of states .",
    "this pseudo - gap arises from the inability of the correlated 2des to rapidly relax the charge density defect created by the rapid injection of an electron by tunneling at low energies .",
    "put another way , at low energies the ( @xmath0 + 1)-particle states created by tunneling are essentially orthogonal to the ( @xmath0 + 1)-particle eigenstates of the 2des .    in this paper",
    "we report experimental observations which indicate that the tunneling coulomb gap is sensitive to the spin configuration of the 2des , a possibility not considered in prior theoretical work @xcite .",
    "our experiments consist of measurements of the current - voltage characteristics for electrons tunneling between parallel 2d electron systems in semiconductor double quantum wells in the presence of magnetic fields both perpendicular and parallel to the 2d planes .",
    "we focus on the case of the half - filled lowest landau level ( in each 2d layer ) , both for simplicity and the existence of a well - developed theory @xcite for this situation .",
    "we find that the tunneling coulomb gap increases and then saturates as the parallel field is applied in a manner consistent with the known transition from partial to complete spin polarization of the 2des .",
    "the samples used in this experiment are gaas - based semiconductor heterostructures grown by molecular beam epitaxy .",
    "each contains two 18 nm gaas quantum wells separated by a 10 nm al@xmath1ga@xmath2as barrier layer .",
    "silicon delta - doping layers , positioned in the thick al@xmath3ga@xmath4as layers above and below the double quantum well , populate the lowest subband of each quantum well with a 2des of nominal density @xmath5 @xmath6 and low temperature mobility @xmath7 @xmath8/vs .",
    "standard lithographic methods are used to pattern the 2des into a mesa structure ; for the data presented here this mesa consists of a 250 @xmath9 m square with 60 @xmath9m - wide arms extending from each side .",
    "ohmic contacts ( niauge ) to the individual 2d layers @xcite are positioned at the ends of these arms .",
    "these separate layer contacts enable direct measurements of the interlayer tunneling characteristics of the sample via conventional dc and low frequency ac methods .",
    "the individual layer densities @xmath10 and @xmath11 in the central mesa region are controlled by electrostatic gates deposited on the top and back side of the thinned sample .",
    "we focus here on the balanced case , @xmath12 , with @xmath13 varied from about @xmath14 to @xmath15 @xmath6 . via _ in situ _ tilting of the sample relative to an applied magnetic field @xmath16 , field components both perpendicular ( @xmath17 ) and parallel ( @xmath18 ) to the 2des plane could be applied . except where otherwise noted , the tunneling data presented here was obtained with @xmath17  adjusted to render the landau level filling factor @xmath19 in each layer @xcite .",

    "this feature , a coulomb pseudogap , is the main focus of this paper .",
    "away from @xmath32 the tunneling current rises and forms a broad peak . both the coulomb gap around @xmath32 and the broad peak at finite @xmath31 are due to the strong electron - electron interactions which dominate the physics of landau quantized 2d electron systems .",
    "these features have received substantial theoretical scrutiny @xcite and are qualitatively well - understood .",

    "these observations are at least consistent with a change in the spin configuration of the 2des , a possibility which we now consider .",
    "there is by now copious evidence that the ground state of the 2des at @xmath60 is not fully spin polarized at low density @xcite .",
    "for example , tracy _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , using resistively - detected nuclear magnetic resonance ( rdnmr ) methods , observed a relatively sudden increase in the nuclear spin lattice relaxation time @xmath61 as the density of a 2des , maintained at @xmath60 , was increased .",
    "this observation was readily explained by the disappearance of both up and down electronic spin states at the fermi level as the 2des transitions from partially to completely spin polarized .",
    "similarly , li _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , using both conventional transport and resistively - detected nuclear spin relaxation methods , showed that the @xmath22 spin transition could be driven either by increasing the 2des density or by adding an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "the composite fermion ( cf ) theory of the @xmath22 state provides a simple way to understand this transition . in this theory the 2des at @xmath52 resembles a fermi gas at zero magnetic field , only the constituent fermions are cfs , electrons with two fictitious magnetic flux quanta attached .",
    "in general , both up and down spin cfs are present at the fermi level , their relative populations determined by the comparison between the spin zeeman energy @xmath62 and the cf fermi energy @xmath63 .",
    "the zeeman energy is presumed to be the same as for ordinary electrons , @xmath64 , with the @xmath38-factor that appropriate to the host crystal band structure ( @xmath65 for electrons in gaas ) .",
    "in contrast , the cf fermi energy is unrelated to the band structure and , ideally , is determined only by electron - electron interactions .",
    "dimensional arguments alone then require @xmath66 , with @xmath67 a universal , though only approximately known , constant @xcite . since @xmath68 while @xmath69 , it is clear that @xmath62 can be made to exceed @xmath63 either by increasing the density or by adding an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "defining the normalized zeeman energy @xmath70 , the transition from partial to complete spin polarization at @xmath52 should occur at @xmath71 , independent of electron density .",
    "various non - idealities of the 2des , @xmath72 the inescapable finite thickness of the 2d layer and interaction - driven landau level mixing effects , can be expected to disrupt this universality and produce sample - to - sample variations in the observed critical zeeman energy @xmath73 @xcite .",

    "3(b ) with the transition from partial to complete spin polarization in the 2des , the underlying physical mechanism relating these properties of the 2des needs to be determined .",
    "as is already well - understood @xcite , the coulomb gap in the tunneling density of states arises from the electronic correlations created by coulomb interactions in the landau quantized 2des .",
    "these correlations are obviously sensitive to the spin polarization of the 2des : parallel spin electrons avoid one another more strongly than anti - parallel electrons owing to the pauli principle .",
    "a partially spin polarized 2des is in this sense less strongly correlated than a fully polarized one .",
    "a more detailed picture emerges from consideration of the wavevector - dependent conductivity , @xmath74 , of the 2des .",
    "the coulomb gap itself reflects the inability of the 2des to rapidly relax the charge defects created by tunneling .",
    "an electron tunneling into ( or out of ) a landau quantized 2des creates a localized excess ( or deficit ) of charge . the rate at which these defects can relax to equilibrium is determined by the conductivity , with higher conductivity producing a smaller coulomb gap and lower conductivity a larger one .",
    "this connection between the magnitude of the coulomb gap and the conductivity was made concrete by he , platzman , and halperin ( hph ) @xcite .",
    "hence , we are led to ask how the spin polarization affects the conductivity . since at voltages of order",
    "@xmath26 the charge defects created by tunneling are localized on the scale of several magnetic lengths @xmath75 , the disorder - dominated @xmath76=0 conductivity measured in an ordinary electrical transport measurement is not the relevant quantity .",
    "instead , it is @xmath74 at @xmath77 that counts . in their study of the cf metal at @xmath60 , halperin ,",
    "lee , and read @xcite calculated the conductivity for the fully spin polarized case : @xmath78 , where @xmath79 is the fermi wavevector of the spin polarized cf fermi sea .",
    "this intriguing @xmath76-linear conductivity was confirmed experimentally in high frequency surface acoustic wave experiments by willett _",
    "_ @xcite .",
    "if instead of completely spin polarized , the cf fermi sea were completely unpolarized , the fermi wavevector is reduced to @xmath80 and the conductivity @xmath74 thereby _ increased _ @xcite by a factor of @xmath81 . between these extremes , where the 2des is partially spin polarized , we can expect the conductivity to steadily decrease with increasing spin polarization .",
    "given the connection between conductivity and the width of the coulomb gap established by hph @xcite , this dependence qualitatively explains the behavior of @xmath26 @xmath59 @xmath16  shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) and thus fortifies our association of the `` knee '' in the coulomb gap data with the transition to complete spin polarization .",
    "there are , of course , issues that require further study . for example , as fig .",
    "3(a ) demonstrates , @xmath25 , the voltage at which the maximum in the tunneling current occurs , does not exhibit any evidence of a transition similar to that displayed by @xmath26 .",
    "we find this behavior unsurprising .",
    "the voltage @xmath25 is the cross - over point between two regions of suppressed tunneling . at low energies",
    "the slow dynamics of the correlated 2des produce the coulomb gap at the fermi level . at high energies , in the single particle cyclotron gap between landau levels",
    ", there are no final states in which to tunnel . in between these extremes , at energies of order the net coulomb broadening @xmath82 of the landau level , the tunneling current has a maximum .",
    "since @xmath83 depends only on the mean spacing @xmath84 between electrons ( @xmath85 at @xmath22 ) , no particular sensitivity to the spin state of these electrons is expected .",
    "the modest @xcite linear increase of @xmath25 with @xmath16 shown in fig .",
    "3(a ) nevertheless remains a puzzle .",
    "one possibility is that it is due to a stiffening of the effective coulomb interaction between electrons due to a ` squeezing ' of their wavefunctions .",
    "such squeezing can result from the subband / landau level mixings induced by the in - plane magnetic field .    a more interesting question concerns the role of interlayer coulomb interactions .",
    "that such interactions exist is made evident by the linear extrapolation to zero density of the @xmath25 @xmath59 @xmath27 data shown in fig .",
    "the substantial negative intercept , @xmath86 mv , is believed to be due to a final - state excitonic attraction between a tunneled electron and the hole it leaves behind . at low energies , _",
    "e.g. _ inside the coulomb gap , the charge defects created by tunneling are larger in lateral extent @xcite than they are at @xmath25 . while this reduces the magnitude of the excitonic attraction , some effect undoubtedly remains .",
    "hph considered interlayer coulomb interactions and concluded that in addition to an excitonic ` down - shift ' of the peak in the tunnel current , the detailed shape of the @xmath21 curve deep in the gap was altered @xcite . to what extent these interactions change the way spin influences the coulomb gap is not presently known .",
    "a more dramatic interlayer interaction effect is the condensation of the double layer 2des into an intrinsically bilayer collective state possessing spontaneous interlayer phase coherence @xcite .",
    "this state , with its remarkable superfluid - like properties , occurs at the same total filling factor as studied here ( _ i.e. _ @xmath20 ) and _ is _ observable in the present samples , but only at densities lower than those explored here . while some hypothetical precursors of this transition might be influencing the present tunneling results , two considerations suggest otherwise",
    "first , we have observed that a very similar increase of the coulomb gap is induced by an in - plane magnetic field when each 2des is at filling factor @xmath87 or @xmath88 ( @xmath55 at total filling factors @xmath89 and 1.1 , respectively ) .",
    "thus , unlike the coherent bilayer @xmath90 state , the effects reported here exist over a relatively wide range of filling factors .",
    "second , we have found that the in - plane field - induced increase in the coulomb gap persists to at least @xmath91 k. this is well above the temperature at which the bilayer @xmath90 interlayer coherent state has collapsed @xcite .    in conclusion , we find that the coulomb gap which dominates the low energy tunneling between two parallel 2dess at high magnetic field can be acutely sensitive to the application of an in - plane magnetic field .",
    "this sensitivity appears to coincide with the transition from partial to complete spin polarization which the in - plane field drives by increasing the spin zeeman energy .",
    "the wavevector - dependent conductivity of the 2des provides a plausible link between the coulomb gap and the system s spin configuration .",
    "the coulomb gap thus appears to offer a new perspective on the spin state of highly correlated 2d electrons .",

    "<S> the coulomb gap observed in tunneling between parallel two - dimensional electron systems , each at half filling of the lowest landau level , is found to depend sensitively on the presence of an in - plane magnetic field . especially at low electron density , </S>",
    "<S> the width of the coulomb gap at first increases sharply with in - plane field , but then abruptly levels off . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior appears to coincide with the known transition from partial to complete spin polarization of the half - filled lowest landau level . </S>",
    "<S> the tunneling gap therefore opens a new window onto the spin configuration of two - dimensional electron systems at high magnetic field . </S>"
