    "at the end of last century , @xcite dared to suggest ` a few remarks ' which require ` a total break with the astronomers ' deeply entrenched views. he suggested ( i ) that geometers abstract concepts of non - euclidean geometries could correspond to the real universe , but also ( ii ) that non - trivial topology could also be required in order to represent the space in which we live .",
    "since then , the physical theory ( general relativity ) linking his first suggestion , curvature , to the stress - energy tensor has encouraged considerable observational efforts in measuring ( directly or indirectly ) the curvature of the observable universe .    on the other hand , mathematical difficulties and the lack of an accepted quantum gravity theory",
    "probably explain why less observational effort has been directed at following up the second of schwarzschild s two remarks that have ` neither any real practical applicability nor any pertinent mathematical meaning ' , i.e. measuring the topology of the universe .",
    "since the curvature estimates strongly favour a non - positive curvature , without measuring the topology of the universe it is not possible to answer fundamental questions , such as whether or not the universe is finite .",
    "( measuring topology does not guarantee an answer , but not measuring it guarantees not having an answer , except if the curvature is positive . )",
    "both curvature and topology have been put in a relativistic context in the friedmann - lematre models @xcite .",
    "mathematical developments in three - dimensional geometry and topology @xcite now abound , and theoretical ideas of the generation of topology at the quantum epoch are developing rapidly @xcite .",
    "recently , considerable work in observational methods , constraints and candidates for the global topology of the universe has also commenced .",
    "these include ( i ) cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , i.e. essentially two - dimensional , methods ( see [ s - twodim ] ) and ( ii ) three - dimensional methods @xcite .",
    "work has also been done considering how simulations of large scale structure ( the galaxy distribution ) are affected by the usual assumption ( for numerical rather than physical reasons ) that the universe is multiply connected @xcite .    for theoretical reasons ,",
    "interest is probably highest in the hyperbolic manifolds .",
    "however , the observational arguments tending towards a flat , cosmological constant dominated universe ( @xcite ) may bring interest back to more thorough analyses of flat , multiply connected friedmann - lematre models .",
    "moreover , ( i ) for a cosmological constant to be observable , fine - tuning is necessary if an inflationary scenario is accepted , which may also fine - tune the topology scales such that @xmath1 , and can be thought of the ` smallest size ' of a small universe .",
    "the distance to the surface of last scattering ( hereafter , sls ) is labelled @xmath2 . ] ; and ( ii ) the unknown physics required to explain @xmath3 might also explain the topology of the universe . ; in the notation of @xcite , @xmath4 . ]    hence , the flat models should not be neglected .    for reviews on cosmological topology ,",
    "see @xcite and @xcite .    the 2-d and 3-d methods have different underlying assumptions on the physics of regions of space or of objects , so systematic errors are likely to differ between the two approaches . both have advantages and disadvantages . for a list and discussion of both 2-d and 3-d methods , see table  2 of @xcite .",
    "a discussion restricted to the 2-d methods follows here .",
    "the 2-d methods cited above either ( i ) model ( analytically or by simulations ) the perturbation field in the universal covering space of compact universes and compare the random realisations ( or statistics ) with cmb data @xcite or ( ii ) analyse cmb data directly for multiple topological images ( see [ s - matchedc ] ; @xcite ) .",
    "[ the method of @xcite probably falls into the latter category , but is not discussed further . ]",
    "the fact that the former method ( i ) , ( which has been applied principally to euclidean models , i.e. toroidal or hexagonal prismical models ) makes statements about an ensemble of universe models can be interpreted as either an advantage or a disadvantage relative to the latter method ( ii ) .",
    "the simulational methods ( a ) test consistency of observational and model perturbation statistics , based on ( b ) statistical properties of primordial perturbations , while the identified circles principle ( [ s - matchedc ] ) directly tests whether or not the sls is consistent with multiple topological imaging , using the actual temperature perturbations measured .",
    "( )    the problem with a result about perturbation statistics is that the confidence level with which a particular multiply connected model can be rejected is only a statement about the rarity of perturbation properties required to be consistent with the observations .    on the contrary ,",
    "the circles principle enables rejection of a model by showing that temperatures at supposedly multiply topologically imaged points are inconsistent .",
    "that is , it can show that _ no _ set of perturbations would allow the model to fit the data .",
    "in addition , both theoretical and observational justification at large scales of the perturbation statistics assumed for the simulational approach are generally made _ under the assumption of simple connectedness_. it could be considered inconsistent to test multiple connectedness if properties expected under the assumption of simple connectedness were assumed .",
    "the theoretical motivations for gaussian amplitude distributions and a @xmath5 power spectrum are unlikely to be valid at scales approaching @xmath6 and @xmath7 .    that is , either for a hyperbolic or for a flat , @xmath8 metric to be presently observable ( irrespective of topology )",
    ", inflation needs some degree of fine - tuning [ which can partly be provided by the ergodicity of geodesics in the former case , @xcite ] . for a flat , @xmath9 multiply connected model to be observable ,",
    "even more fine - tuning is needed .",
    "is the present value of the density parameter . ]",
    "so , either flat , observably multiply connected models can be rejected for purely theoretical reasons , or else they can be tested observationally accepting that perturbation statistics may differ somewhat from inflationary expectations .",
    "observational motivation for gaussian amplitude distributions and a @xmath5 power spectrum at the @xmath6 and @xmath7 scales is equally lacking  if one is testing a multiply connected universe , since the only observational justification of these properties on large scales is that of cobe data analysed _ assuming simple - connectedness_. moreover , although several authors find consistency with gaussian statistics ( e.g. @xcite ) , others find indications of non - gaussianity ( @xcite ) , which are further discussed in @xcite .",
    "apart from the problems inherent to the perturbation simulation approach , there are some factors which could be added to this approach but have not yet been dealt with in the work cited above dealing with flat multiply connected models :    ( )    only three of these eight papers discuss @xmath10 models , and only one compares such models with the cobe observations in any detail .    the integrated sachs - wolfe effect ( isw ) is not considered in any of the flat model papers . [ note",
    "that the isw _ is _ discussed in @xcite for the hyperbolic case . ]    the possible contribution of redshifts in the sls radiation due to peculiar velocities at the sls ( hereafter , ` the doppler effect ' ) is not considered in any of these papers .",
    "this is expected to contribute less than the nave sachs - wolfe effect to temperature fluctuations @xmath11 on cobe scales , under the assumption of simpleconnectedness .",
    "however , if this assumption is dropped and @xmath1 is being tested , it is difficult to be certain about properties of the velocity field on scales near @xmath12 based on present quantum cosmology theory .    a conservative observational approach would be to consider statistics which take into account this _ locally anisotropic _ radiation .",
    "there is also a more local observational problem with the work done so far for flat and hyperbolic models .",
    "what is important for falsifying a small universe hypothesis is the significance of individual fluctuations , and whether or not these are multiply imaged .",
    "the significance of individual fluctuations has been studied by @xcite .",
    "this paper suggests that some of the most significant hot spots ( _ above _ the 20 degree galactic cut ) are galactic contaminants , from the orion and ophiuchus complexes .",
    "removal of such non - axisymmetric contaminants has not yet been discussed in the small universe literature .",
    "although tests based on the identified circles principle ( [ s - matchedc ] ) avoid the problems ( a ) and ( b ) above , they share a weakness with the perturbation simulation approach by being adversely affected by noise , in particular from detector noise and from residual foreground contamination , which can make genuinely matched circles look different .",
    "the isw and doppler effects will also provide some contributions to cmb maps .",
    "the former may be treated as foreground contamination .",
    "the latter will provide locally anisotropic emission , which should be taken into account as a modification of @xcite s identified circles principle ( [ s - dopp ] ) .",
    "the former is a weakness of applications of the identified circles principle , shared by the simulation approach , for non - flat models and models with a non - zero cosmological constant .",
    "the isw , due to time varying of the gravitational potential , is likely to be strong if the universe is hyperbolic , particularly at low redshifts and at the large angular scales present in the cobe maps @xcite . in that case ,",
    "temperature fluctuations at low redshifts are mixed in with the signal from the sls , so that an identified circles analysis or a simulation analysis restricted to the sls can not account for the full signal at cobe scales .      in view of the above comments ,",
    "it is clear that for the testing of flat , small universe models , there are several advantages if the identified circles principle @xcite can be used , since it _",
    "avoids _ ( a ) making statistical statements about perturbations and ( b ) requiring assumptions about the statistics of the perturbations , even though it _",
    "shares _ the problem of the perturbation simulation approach in its dependence on the statistics of detector noise and residual foregrounds",
    ".    there already exists a specific candidate for a small , flat universe which has been suggested by observations @xcite .",
    "because the candidate is fixed in astronomical coordinates , this offers a good example on which to see if cobe data can be used to reject a small universe hypothesis _ by using only the cobe data itself , without making theoretical hypotheses about the perturbation properties . _",
    "the purpose of this paper is to see if this hypothesis , considered as a null hypothesis , can be rejected purely on the basis of the cobe observations , of about @xmath13 effectively independent pixels at which temperature fluctuations have been measured , per antenna implies a width of @xmath14 smoothing in the difference maps ; a @xmath15 cut for the galactic plane is adopted here ; hence about 300 independent pixels . ] without making assumptions regarding the statistics of primordial density perturbations .",
    "the candidate @xmath10",
    "3-manifold @xcite , according to which two galaxy clusters at redshifts @xmath16 would be topological images of the coma cluster , is presented in [ s - t2 ] .",
    "apart from the striking fact that these three cluster images form a near right angle ( in 3-d ) and that right - angled ` toroidal ' multiply connected universes are those which have been most extensively compared to observations , the relative simplicity of the hypothesis makes it ideal for testing if observational methods of refutation can really be made statistically watertight , in preparation for future candidate 3-manifolds , which are unlikely to be this simple .",
    "methods of refuting the supposed identity of the three clusters by their individual properties ( positions and velocities of galaxies , overall masses , x - ray fluxes ) , by implied multiple imaging of large scale - structure , by predicted positions and redshifts of further topological images of the cluster and by proposals of observations relating to sub - cluster structures are discussed at length in 4.2 , 4.3 and 4.4 of @xcite .",
    "the basic principle of any method used to constrain or detect candidates for the 3-manifold is that if the hypothesis of trivial topology is not adopted , then in some cases , photons can travel between a single , physical object or region of space to the observer by several different geodesics of ( in general ) widely differing lengths .",
    "that is , the objects or regions of space are observed at widely differing positions and redshifts .    in the case of the cmb ,",
    "since the redshift is nearly equal for all points on the sls by definition , only special subsets of angular positions on the sls would be multiply imaged .",
    "@xcite realised that these special subsets form a well defined and easily described set in the covering space : the subsets are pairs of matched circles .",
    "the explanation for this is subtle , but elegant , and is briefly described in [ s - matchedc ] .",
    "_ if the radiation from the sls is locally isotropic _ , then the observed temperature fluctuations observed around two circles of such a pair should be identical , to within the observational uncertainty .",
    "if the values of corresponding points on the circles are inconsistent , then the hypothesis can be rejected with a confidence level based on the estimated uncertainty per resolution element , or pixel .",
    "the assumption of local isotropy seems reasonable for the cobe data , due to the large smoothing length ( effectively @xmath14 ) . at this scale",
    ", the effective temperature correlations should be determined uniquely by the nave sachs - wolfe effect @xcite , i.e. by gravitational redshifts depending on the depths or heights of the potential wells .    as long as",
    "the gravitational potentials are spherically symmetric , i.e. if the equivalents of filaments and great walls on a linear scale do not exist at @xmath17 , then this should be a fair assumption . if filaments and walls did exist , then since temperatures in two different cobe ` pixels ' on corresponding circles represent _ averages over nearly two - dimensional spherical sections at different angles in the fundamental polyhedron _ , some modelling of the three - dimensional two - point correlation function would be needed in order to calculate the probability of these averages being identical .    for this paper , the averaging over the different spherical sections , each of diameter @xmath18 ( for @xmath19 ) and @xmath14 smoothing , is assumed to result in identical values .",
    "the amplitude of the doppler effect at the sls , which is _ locally anisotropic _ , is assumed to be negligible relative to the nave sachs - wolfe effect . since the first doppler ` peak ' is on scales smaller than those resolved by the cobe dmr experiment ,",
    "the fractional contribution of a doppler component to an identified circles test of cobe data is probably small .",
    "however , if ` linear ' filaments and walls existed at the recombination epoch , or if velocity fields related to the @xmath12 scale existed , then this might not be correct .",
    "it should also be remembered that the _ intrinsic _ spatial separations in a multiply connected universe can be much smaller in the fundamental polyhedron than in the covering space , so coherent velocity fields on apparently large , but inherently small , scales may generate a doppler effect which would be unexpected under the simple connectedness assumption .    although the nave sachs - wolfe effect is assumed here to be dominant and to average out to locally isotropic values , an extension of @xcite s ( 1998b ) statistic which should be sensitive to doppler dominated temperature fluctuations is suggested here , just in case the doppler component is more important than expected .",
    "if the doppler effect dominates , then for pairs of multiply imaged pixels which also have nearly parallel lines - of - sight , the values should be nearly equal in absolute value , with equal signs if the angle between them is close to @xmath20 and opposite signs if the angle is close to @xmath21 .",
    "pixels for which the lines of sight are roughly orthogonal provide no theory - free constraint on topology if the doppler effect is dominant .",
    "hence , a correlation function weighted by the dot product of the two line - of - sight vectors of each pixel pair should measure the degree to which the sets of points represent identical velocity induced temperature fluctuations .",
    "a dot product weighted correlation statistic is presented [ eq .  ( [ e - cdopp ] ) ] and demonstrated below .      in [ s - method ] , the hypothesised 3-manifold is briefly presented ( [ s - t2 ] ) , the matched circles principle is explained and the statistics used to estimate the consistency of multiply imaged ` pixels ' on the cmb are defined ( [ s - matchedc ] ) , and the cobe data are briefly introduced ( [ s - cobe ] ) .",
    "results are presented in [ s - results ] and discussed in [ s - disc ] .",
    "conclusions are in [ s - conc ] .",
    "the hubble constant is parametrised here as @xmath22 km  s@xmath23  mpc@xmath24 comoving coordinates are used ( i.e. ` proper distances ' , @xcite , equivalent to ` conformal time ' if @xmath25 ) .",
    "the metric assumed is flat , i.e. , @xmath26 since the candidate 3-manifold is @xmath27 the case @xmath28 is the main case discussed here .",
    "@xcite pointed out that massive clusters of galaxies , dominated by their hot , x - ray emitting gas , should be relatively good ` standard candles ' for observational constraints on the topology of the universe .",
    "this was , in a sense , an update of the ` classical ' searches for multiple topological images of single objects @xcite .",
    "although not a goal of that work , it was noticed that among a small number ( seven ) of very bright clusters used to illustrate the principle , three of these form nearly a right angle ( to within @xmath29% depending on @xmath30 ) with nearly equal ( to 1% ) arm lengths .",
    "this happens to be just what would be expected if space is @xmath31 with two side lengths equal and the third unknown , or if it is @xmath27 an _ a posteriori _ estimate of the probability of this occurring by chance is difficult to make in an unbiased way , so observational refutation is more prudent than theoretical refutation .",
    "moreover , this 3-manifold is very simple , relative to other flat 3-manifolds or to the hyperbolic 3-manifolds [ which are considered more likely for several theoretical reasons , e.g. @xcite ] .",
    "the implied positions and redshifts of multiple topological images of objects are therefore relatively easy to calculate and observationally refutable predictions can be made .",

    "if the measured temperature fluctuations are consistent with the hypothesis of physical identity of the circles , the most straightforward approach is to test the hypothesis that temperatures on corresponding pixels are equal to within observational error .",
    "this hypothesis is tested here by considering the difference in the temperature fluctuations in two corresponding pixels on matched circles to be a random realisation of a gaussian distribution centred on zero with a width determined by the uncertainties of the measurements in the two pixels . by normalising the distribution for each pair to have a standard deviation of unity , the full set of pairs of multiply imaged pixels can be combined to form a large sample of a single distribution of mean zero and standard deviation unity .",

    "finally , if one considers the panels which are least affected by the galactic cut , in particular panels @xmath90 @xmath91 @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath94 these seem to show little disagreement , apart from the right - hand end of the latter panels . of these , the panel @xmath95 is for a pair of circles only separated by @xmath96 , so the agreement can be explained by smoothing rather than by topology .    the right - hand end @xmath92 @xmath93 and @xmath97 can be removed to improve the agreement by arguing that this is contamination by the ophiuchus complex , as before .",

    "if one takes the remaining parts of the curves , then there is still a broad agreement , for example if the data is further smoothed on a larger scale .",
    "but in that case , there is the possibility that what matches is merely a quadrupole or dipole component which has been imperfectly subtracted .",
    "the dipole subtraction for the asds s is quoted to be good but not perfect , so not only would a different statistic need to be calculated in order to measure the matching in such large scale gradients , but the dipole and quadrupole subtraction would have to be done precisely enough that this would be meaningful .",

    "a value close to unity would be expected in an ideal case of matching circle pairs , and a value of zero for non - matching pairs , if the two - point auto - correlation function of the temperature fluctuations were zero . in reality",
    ", there is an intrinsic non - zero auto - correlation function , so a value showing this weak a correlation is unexpected .",
    "if standard arguments implying the relative weakness of the doppler effect are invalid , could this be due to a dominant contribution by the doppler effect , which would cause genuinely anti - correlated temperature values to cancel when evaluating the @xmath53 statistic ?",
    "the parameter @xmath56 does not support this .",
    "its value is smaller in absolute value than that of @xmath53 , presumably because typical values of @xmath98 are smaller than unity and there is no underlying anti - correlation .",
    "figures  [ f - slong]-[f - plong ] show that the small value of @xmath53 is just a coincidence .",
    "these plots show equivalent hypotheses to that based on the three clusters , apart from a rotation in galactic longitude .",
    "this avoids any systematic effects due to the galactic cut or to other functions of galactic latitude .    assuming that the hypothesis is false , the ranges of values of the statistics for different longitudes show typical values of the parameters for the @xmath10 models equivalent to the hypothesised one ( equivalent apart from the lack of observational motivation in the rotated models ) .",
    "[ f - clong ] shows why the low value of @xmath53 for the @xcite candidate is just a coincidence .",
    "the position of the candidate just happens to lie at a longitude where both @xmath60 and @xmath53 have low ( absolute ) values .",
    "the longitudinal dependence of @xmath60 clearly has a sinusoidal - like component , which could be explained by some large scale feature in the temperature map .",
    "the longitudinal dependence of @xmath53 shows more complexity , and provides a distribution of maximum values about a factor of two to four times lower than those of ` @xmath99 ' in @xcite s simulation .",
    "the shape of the @xmath56 distribution ( fig .",
    "[ f - plong ] ) is quite different from that of the @xmath53 distribution ( fig .",
    "[ f - clong ] ) .",
    "typical values of @xmath56 are roughly half that of the typical @xmath53 values .",
    "an order of magnitude estimate to explain this is that ( very ) roughly half of the pairs of matched pixel vectors are roughly orthogonal , and so contribute very little to @xmath54    some features in the @xmath53 distribution , e.g. several local maxima and the global minimum in fig .",
    "[ f - clong ] , can be identified with similar features in fig .",
    "[ f - plong ] .",
    "these can be interpreted as features due to large matched circles for which the matched pixel vectors are roughly parallel .",
    "apart from the ` missing ' contribution of orthogonal vectors in fig .",
    "[ f - plong ] , the differences between the two figures also come from roughly opposite vector pairs , i.e. from pairs of small circles for large @xmath100 and @xmath101 values , where the ` second observer ' is close to @xmath102 from the first observer .",
    "this demonstrates an approach which will be particularly useful for the study of map and planck surveyor data .",
    "the statistic @xmath56 as defined in eq .",
    "( [ e - cdopp ] ) will provide a simple method of searching for roughly opposite , small identified circles in which a doppler component is strongly expected to make a significant contribution .",
    "if a candidate 3-manifold is detected in a new cmb map , then comparison of ` false ' hypotheses rotated in galactic longitude such as here will provide a simple way of checking the significance of the detection , avoiding the need for simulations .      in the absence of specific candidates for torus models ,",
    "several authors have previously compared cobe data to sub - classes of these models , but using the perturbation simulational approach which requires assumptions on perturbation statistics as described above ( [ s - twodim ] ) . the closest work among these to the present study is that of @xcite , who considered @xmath103 and @xmath10 models .    because of the presence of one ( or two ) long axis(es ) , the ` large - scale cutoff in fourier mode ' argument for @xmath31 models , which can be valid for the assumptions of gaussian random amplitudes in the fourier modes , does not apply in these cases .",
    "these authors defined a statistic , @xmath104 which is similar to @xmath46 but which includes multiply imaged pixel pairs along with many non - multiply imaged pixel pairs .",
    "the advantage of this is that the statistic is a minimum value , for which the orientation of the fundamental polyhedron is not assumed .",
    "the disadvantage is that non - multiply imaged pixel pairs are indiscriminately mixed with multiply imaged pixel pairs .",
    "the points ( a ) , ( b ) , ( d ) , ( e ) and ( f ) ( [ s - disadvant ] ) also apply to this study .",
    "this enabled simulations , based on assumptions regarding the power spectrum of density perturbations , to be made in a parameter space comprising only the lengths of the fundamental polyhedron and two random variables for the fourier modes , but not the orientation of the fundamental polyhedron .",
    "the statistic could therefore be calculated within practical computing capabilities .",
    "although this @xmath105 parameter is not identical to @xmath46 and it includes noise due to non - corresponding pixels , the value obtained is @xmath106 not too much larger than the value of @xmath59 which only compares matching pixels .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath105 parameter could still be useful for application to planck and map data .",
    "the cobe advanced science data sets ( asds ) have been used to try to refute the candidate for the global topology of the universe defined by supposing that the three clusters coma , rx  j1347.5 - 1145 and cl  09104 + 4109 are three topological images of a single cluster and determine two generators of the 3-manifold , and that the third generator is large and orthogonal to the first two .",
    "the candidate is a @xmath107 candidate , for a flat , i.e. @xmath108 universe , where @xmath28 .",
    "given the assumptions that    ( )    the error estimates given in the asds s are sufficient as good estimates of the total random plus systematic errors , and    the temperature fluctuations measured are dominated by the nave sachs - wolfe effect which averaged over spherical sections results in locally isotropic emission ,    then ,    ( )    using either the ` subtracted ' or the ` combined ' asds ,    with smoothing at either @xmath14 or @xmath15 , and    with or without making cuts for possible contamination by the galactic centre and by the ophiuchus and orion complexes ,    the difference statistics @xmath59 and @xmath60 clearly refute the @xmath10 hypothesis to more than 94% significance .",
    "( this is estimated by a kolmogorov - smirnov test comparing the list of temperature differences to a gaussian distribution of mean zero and standard deviation unity . )    a galactic cut of @xmath64 is used for all the above options .",
    "the subtracted set more strongly rejects the hypothesis than the combined set .",
    "smoothing at @xmath15 leads to a stronger rejection than for smoothing at @xmath109 removal of the suspected contaminating regions strengthens the rejection , suggesting that these introduce more spurious well - matched portions of circles than ill - matched portions .",
    "this result does not rely on assumptions on the form of the fluctuation spectrum or on the distributions of amplitudes and phases of the spectrum .",
    "the validity of assumption ( i ) will be tested by the increasingly numerous small angle measurements and by the planck and map missions .    in the case of a non - zero cosmological constant",
    "( @xmath110 e.g. @xcite ) , the @xmath10 candidate has not yet been ruled out , since a modelling of the integrated sachs - wolfe ( isw ) effect would be required . in this case , assumption ( ii ) would be invalid to the extent that the isw contributes to the cobe cmb ( 7.3 , @xcite ) .",
    "if the magnitude of this component is of order of the estimated noise , then this would be equivalent to assumption ( i ) failing due to systematic error .",
    "it is interesting to note that the matched circles principle provides a relatively clean and optimal method of refuting specific candidates for global topology . for data of the cobe quality ,",
    "it is clear that there is strong sensitivity to the validity of the noise estimates .",
    "since this is the case for the matched circles method , it must be an even stronger caveat for the perturbation simulation methods , which have mostly been applied to @xmath31 models for which @xmath111 for which the generators have been assumed to be mutually orthogonal , and for which simulations of the fluctuation spectra were required .",
    "since the effectiveness of this new method of applying the identified circles principle in order to directly refute a 3-manifold candidate ( apart from the caveats ) has been shown , future work would be to use the same method to refute certain classes of flat ( or hyperbolic ) multiply connected universe 3-manifolds with cobe data .",
    "this would complement previous work , which relied on assumptions on the perturbation statistics which are probably inconsistent with the hypotheses which were tested .",
    "helpful discussions and encouragement from tarun souradeep , helio fagundes , ubi wichoski , thanu padmanabhan and varun sahni and useful comments from an anonymous referee were greatly appreciated .",
