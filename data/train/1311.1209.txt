    "it was recently argued @xcite that as many as @xmath0 of all stars may collide with each other during their lifetime , due to the dynamics of typical field triple systems .",
    "especially interesting is that the rate of collision between white dwarfs ( wds ) in such systems may be as high as the rate of type ia supernovae ( sne ia ) .",
    "although collisions of wds were earlier believed to have rates which are orders of magnitude smaller than the rate of sne ia , they motivated three - dimensional hydrodynamic simulations of such collisions and the possible resulting thermonuclear explosion @xcite .",
    "while the amount of @xmath1ni ( the decay of which powers the observed light , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) synthesized in most of these simulations was non - negligible , the results were contradictory , with inconsistent amounts of @xmath1ni and different ignition sites of a detonation wave for the same initial conditions .",
    "this discrepancy was resolved by @xcite , where high resolution two - dimensional ( 2d ) simulations with a fully resolved ignition process were employed .",
    "moreover , it was shown that there is a strong correlation between the @xmath1ni yield and the total mass of colliding carbon - oxygen ( co ) wds ( insensitive to their mass ratio ) which spans the observed range of sne ia yields for the observed range of co wds masses . in all collisions",
    "the nuclear detonation is due to a well understood shock ignition , devoid of the commonly introduced free parameters such as the deflagration velocity or transition to detonation criteria .",
    "the detonation triggered by the collisions results in explosions which match key observational properties of sne ia .",
    "we believe that this is the main channel for these explosions .",
    "in this paper we analyze the early hydrodynamic evolution of zero - impact parameter collisions between two identical stars .",
    "our results are applicable to a wide variety of stellar collisions , and in particular they clarify the early evolution in the case of collisions between co wds .",
    "we restrict our analysis to early times in which the velocity of the approaching stars , @xmath2 , is roughly constant .",
    "the velocity is increasing since the stars accelerate towards each other in the gravitational field of each star , @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the stellar mass and @xmath5 is the stellar radius . in what follows ,",
    "we limit our analysis to early times , for which @xmath6 .",
    "the approaching velocity @xmath7 is much larger than the speed of sound near the stellar edge and immediately after contact two strong shock waves form that propagate from the contact surface towards the center of each of the stars . as we show , the shock velocity in the collision frame , @xmath8 , is much smaller than @xmath7 for stellar collisions with @xmath9 . in the context of collisions between co wds",
    "this property leads to a lack of any appreciable nuclear burning at early times , @xmath10 . at later times , when a detonation is ignited ( typically at @xmath11 , see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , there is already a significant amount of shocked material , which allows an efficient synthesis of @xmath1ni , consistent with sne ia observations .",
    "a detailed study of these detonations at later times is beyond the scope of this paper and will be described in a subsequent publication @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : contactprop ] we discuss the properties of the contact region in an example of collision between co wds .",
    "we show that the contact region has a planar symmetry , a uniform pressure , a diverging speed of sound , and a finite temperature .",
    "these main features do not depend on the assumptions that the stars have equal masses , that the impact parameter is zero or on the specific density profile .",
    "the planar symmetry allows us to verify that the results of a realistic 2d simulation of a collision ( with a limited resolution near the contact surface ) are correct , by comparing it to a high resolution one - dimensional ( 1d ) simulation .",
    "a numerical difficulty arises due to the diverging speed of sound and is overcome using a new 1d numerical scheme . in section  [ sec : ses ] , we consider the ideal case of zero impact collisions of identical stars with a ( pre - collision ) power - law density profile , @xmath12 , and an ideal equation of state ( the somewhat confusing notations , @xmath13 for the distance from the contact surface and @xmath14 for increasing profile , are used to be consistent with previous literature on propagating shocks in cylindrical and spherical symmetries , see below ) .",
    "the exact self - similar solution of this problem as well as a simple and accurate analytical approximation are derived .",
    "we find excellent agreement between the 1d numerical results and the self - similar solutions , which shows that the self - similar solutions are achieved for this flow and that our numerical scheme solves the flow equations accurately .",
    "the self - similar solution in the upstream frame is the planar version of previous piston problems that were studied in cylindrical and spherical symmetries ( * ? ? ?",

    "we begin with an example of collision between co wds ( section  [ sec : example ] ) .",
    "we show that the contact region has a planar symmetry , a uniform pressure , a diverging speed of sound , and a finite temperature .",

    "a numerical difficulty arises due to the diverging speed of sound and is overcome using a new 1d numerical scheme .",
    "finally , we show in section  [ sec : noburn ] that for all co wd collisions the temperature at the contact surface is generally too small for any appreciable nuclear burning at early times @xmath10 .",
