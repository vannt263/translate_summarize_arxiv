    "this system was extensively studied and solved for various boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "one important feature of the system is that it may be interpreted as attached to some special mutations in a suitable infinite rank cluster algebra @xcite .",
    "as such the solution is expected to be expressible as a laurent polynomial of any admissible initial data ( due to the laurent property of cluster algebra @xcite ) .",

    "this system was used to generalize cluster algebras for non - commutative cluster variables in rank 2 , and a few examples in higher rank were constructed as well @xcite .",
    "the laurent property , and finally its positive version , were proved for non - commutative rank 2 cluster algebras in @xcite , thus completing the proof of a general conjecture by kontsevich .",
    "the purpose of this note is to introduce and solve a fully non - commutative version of the @xmath0 @xmath3-system , still enjoying the positive laurent property in terms of non - commuting initial variables , and to solve it with non - commutative extensions of the previous solutions .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .    in section 2",
    ", we define the non - commutative @xmath0 @xmath3-system and show its invariance and integrability properties .",
    "the novel feature is that it involves _ two _ sets of non - commuting invertible variables of a unital algebra @xmath50 at each site , subject to local mixed relations .    in section 3",
    "we show that this system reduces to respectively the non - commutative @xmath0 @xmath40-system and the quantum @xmath0 @xmath3-system for suitable choices of the variables .    in section 4",
    "we construct the general solution of the system , by introducing a flat @xmath53 connection defined on its solutions .",
    "this extends the method already used successfully in the commuting and quantum cases , and produces an explicit formula for the solution , which displays the positive laurent property manifestly .",
    "we further interpret this solution in the language of ( non - commutative ) networks , namely models of paths on directed graphs with non - commuting weights .",
