    "l - dopa ( levodopa ) is a naturally occurring precursor of dopamine in the human body @xcite .",
    "the loss of dopaminergic neurons and the subsequent impaired production of dopamine in the nigrostriatal region of the brain is the major cause of pathogenesis and progression of parkinson s disease @xcite .",
    "the supplementation of l - dopa is the gold standard in the treatment of parkinson s disease since 50 years .",
    "the efficacy of l - dopa is hampered by its inherent fast kinetics .",
    "after per os administration of a single dose , the peak of the concentration occurs within an hour , after which a decrease in the concentration rapidly follows @xcite .",
    "this kinetic profile leads to an on / off phenomena .",
    "the on phenomenon refers to the periods when the symptoms are controlled . during such periods ,",
    "dyskenesia ( uncontrolled movements ) might appear while the peak of the concentration exceeds the upper limit of the therapeutic window @xcite .",
    "the off phenomenon , or akinesia , occurs when the concentration of l - dopa drops below the therapeutic window .",
    "patients report the inability to move and blockage , causing fall injuries @xcite .",
    "other factors have been found to contribute to the on / off fluctuations , such as diet , genetic variants , and stress @xcite .",
    "the continuous intravenous administration of l - dopa has been shown to be correlated with lower on / off phenomena @xcite , which drove advances in l - dopa formulation @xcite .",
    "a continuous administration of l - dopa gel through a jejunal pump , decreased the off - phenomena by 1.9 hours a day @xcite .",
    "although , it has been reported that continuous administration exacerbated adverse reactions related to levodopa , mainly the decrease in folate , vitamin b12 , and vitamin b6 as well as the increase in homocysteine and methylmalonic acid , which induce neurological and metabolic dysfunctions @xcite .",
    "+ real - time controlled pumps are a new generation of drug delivery devices , which take into account the physiology of patient as well as the drug concentrations to deliver a personalized dose .",
    "such devices allow for fast responses to unwanted changes in order to keep drug levels within a predefined therapeutic window @xcite .",
    "although subcutaneous blood concentration monitoring of l - dopa is not yet routinely done , non - invasive techniques have been developed and offer the promise of a fast and reliable measurement of l - dopa concentrations .",
    "notably , microdialysis , a minimally invasive technique , has been tested and increasingly adopted in clinical practice for parkinson s disease patients under l - dopa treatment . bypassing the small intestine through a subcutaneous infusion",
    "improved the bioavailability of l - dopa @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that maintaining steady state concentrations of l - dopa through continuous infusion did not guarantee achieving the clinical objectives , especially with proteic diet @xcite .",
    "+ taken together , ( i ) the fluctuations in the response to l - dopa as well as ( ii ) its gastrointestinal absorption characterized by erratic peaks , ( iii ) the adverse reactions shown by the uncontrolled continuous jejunal delivery , and ( iv ) the failure to improve the symptoms through only maintaining a steady concentrations of plasma l - dopa , make the subcutaneous controlled delivery pump a promising alternative for the treatment of parkinson s disease . to this end ,",
    "a modified molecule , l - dopa methyl ester , was successfully administered through the subcutaneous route @xcite .",
    "the feedback control would ideally come from ( i ) measuring l - dopa concentrations in the plasma , ( ii ) resting tremor ( hand shacking ) as a surrogate endpoint , and ( iii ) brain dopamine production.since the latter measurement needs invasive techniques , it should be reserved for patients subjected to deep brain stimulation using implanted macroelectrodes that allow the measurement of the local field potential ( lfp ) and the detection of brain power spectrum correlated to on and off phenomena , as shown previously @xcite . + here , we computationally model and analyse the behaviour of a novel subcutaneous delivery controlled pump based on comprehensive model of l - dopa kinetics and dynamics that merges two published models ( @xcite @xcite ) , and compare different control strategies ( time invariant and continuous ) .",
    "the model describing l - dopa is a combination of the pharmacokinetics @xcite and the pharmacodynamics @xcite of the drug and consists of three state variables @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 that represent l - dopa concentrations in the plasma , tissues , and the brain respectively .",
    "+ presently , we will develop on the state variable @xmath2 that is directly correlated to the drug efficacy .",
    "it is assumed that the effect of the l - dopa can not be measured directly , i.e. , we can not measure @xmath2 .",
    "+ instead , @xmath2 can only be observed indirectly from the so called outputs .",
    "one choice for an output is the effect corresponding on hand tapping ; another choice is the lfp measurements in patients equipped with deep brain stimulation devices ; a third alternative is @xmath0 , i.e. , the plasma concentration . measuring @xmath2 will not be further discussed , but the other two  hand tapping and lfp  will now be addressed . + * hand tapping * : + the concentration @xmath2 can be directly estimated by the number of hand taps a patient performs in a minute . a model of the hand taps",
    "was provided in @xcite and is given by @xmath3 the function @xmath4 is implicitly parametrized by @xmath5 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath9 represents the effect .",
    "in this situation , it is the number of taps per minute that the patient were asked to do on buzzers separated by a distance of 20 cm .",
    "the integer @xmath8 is the hill coefficient , @xmath10 is the maximum effect , and @xmath11 is the concentration of l - dopa in the effect compartment that gives @xmath12 of the maximum effect .",
    "+ the number of taps is measured as the number of times the patient could alternately tap two buttons 20 cm apart in 60 seconds , with the most affected hand @xcite .",
    "the hand shacking is assumed to have a similar profile as the tapping test if measured with an accelerometer or a similar body metric device .",
    "+ it is also assumed that subcutaneous administration of l - dopa yields the same kinetics as the intravenous route . as a motivation for using the effect of hand tapping to indirectly measure @xmath2 , it should be mentioned that wearable sensors that can measure soft structures and body metrics are an active field of research @xcite . + * lfp measurements * : + in this case , it is assumed that @xmath2 can be approximated via lfp in patients equipped with deep brain stimulation devices .",
    "measuring the level of dopamine in the brain is the ultimate efficacy indicator about disease progression and l - dopa efficacy .",
    "it has been reported that the increase of l - dopa in the brain is correlated with power spectrum modification in the lfp @xcite .",
    "+ dyskinetic patients showed a higher gamma power in the lfp profile , while akinetic patients have a beta power profile .",
    "the change in the lfp profile has been reported to correlate with a change in dopamine concentration in the brain and dyskinesia @xcite .",

    "the control variable @xmath23 is introduced to be able to write the dynamics of @xmath24 as a linear time invariant system . in the end , it is the rate @xmath25 that we want to choose .",
    "@xmath26 is the solution to with initial state @xmath27 and initial time @xmath28 .",

    "it is assumed that @xmath30 where @xmath31^t \\in \\mathbb{r}^3 $ ] of positive elements ( the @xmath32 ) ; in this context `` @xmath33 '' means that the inequality should hold element - wise , and `` @xmath34 '' is a vector in @xmath35 where the elements thereof are equal to zero .",
    "it is further assumed that @xmath36 without this assumption , the rate @xmath37 could take negative values , which is infeasible .",
    "the assumptions on @xmath38 ( or rather @xmath39 ) lead to different control designs .",
    "the matrices @xmath40 and @xmath41 are defined by @xmath42 where the @xmath43 are positive for all @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the drug molecular weight , @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the inter - compartmental rates , @xmath48 the peripheral volume , and @xmath49 the blood to brain equilibration constant .",
    "the matrix @xmath50 is assumed to be a stable matrix , i.e. , all the eigenvalues have strict negative real part @xcite .",
    "using the model in section  [ sec : model ] , we now compare two different strategies for administration of levodopa : _ constant subcutaneous infusion _ and _ time - varying subcutaneous infusion based on feedback_. the infusion is only subcutaneous , i.e. , we design @xmath51 and let the exogenous production term of @xmath52 null for all @xmath53 ( or equivalently @xmath54 for all @xmath53 ) .",
    "the objective considered in here is to find a constant rate of infusion @xmath51 such that the concentration @xmath2 converges asymptotically to a reference value , which is kept within a therapeutic window .",
    "formally , the problem is :    [ prob:1 ] given @xmath55 , construct a control law @xmath51 such that for any any @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath2 converges to @xmath58 as @xmath59 .",
    "* proposed solution to problem  [ prob:1 ] : * @xmath60 where @xmath61 + * explanation : * the proposed solution is very simple and uses the structure of @xmath50 .",

    "now , if we choose @xmath51 as in , the dynamics for @xmath65 is @xmath66 which comprises a stable system .",
    "hence , @xmath67 converges asymptotically to @xmath68 when @xmath53 goes to the infinity , which means that @xmath2 converges to @xmath58 .",
    "since there is no feedback , i.e. , the control law is constant , there is no need to address the issues of time - delays and different time scales in the output . if the input @xmath69 is slightly off , @xmath70 converges to a value that is close to @xmath71 .",
    "the most important thing to note is that continuous supply of levodopa has the benefit of keeping the concentration at a constant reference value , avoiding on / off behaviour .      in this section",
    ", we assume that the reference signal is time - varying .",
    "levodopa requirements vary according to foreseeable events , such as circadian rhythm .",
    "patients need less levodopa during the night , although it is important to maintain steady state concentrations to guarantee a better sleeping quality . in this case , the therapeutic threshold is maintained during the day and decreased during night .",
    "high protein diet is also a cause of time - variations in the reference signal : the plasma concentration of levodopa stays stable , while brain concentrations decrease because of competition for blood brain barrier carriers between levodopa and dietary amino acids @xcite . the structure of the measurements / outputs @xmath22 determines the type of control designs considered . in this work",
    "we will focus on the case when the measurements of @xmath2 are available  the concentration might be indirectly measured via the effect of hand tapping @xmath72 .",
    "[ prob:2 ] given @xmath73 , construct a control law @xmath51 such that for any any @xmath56 and @xmath57 , @xmath2 converges to @xmath74 as @xmath59 .",
    "* proposed solution to problem [ prob:2 ] : * @xmath75 where @xmath76 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",

    "* explanation : * now we show that @xmath80 converges to zero . in the following , all symbols not explained can be found in section  [ sec : olle1 ] .",
    "we see that @xmath81 let @xmath82 and the augmented state vector be @xmath83 $ ] .",
    "now one can show that this closed loops dynamics has the properties that the @xmath84 vector converges to zero , which means that @xmath80 converges to zero .",
    "problem  [ prob:2 ] is a trajectory tracking problem in a linear system .",
    "since the system is in strict feedback form one can use the backstepping control design technique  @xcite .",
    "there are also various other methods that can be used .",
    "the proposed controller can be modified in order to account for time delays and measurement errors in @xmath2 .",
    "in order to provide the foundations for an l - dopa control pump ( figure [ fig:1 ] ) , a comprehensive model is presented combining the drug kinetics with its effects ( pharmacodynamics ) ( figure [ fig:2 ] ) .",
    "the model consists of two compartments .",
    "the first compartment describes the kinetics of l - dopa following an intravenous ( iv ) infusion .",
    "it also takes into account the synthesis of endogenous l - dopa .",
    "the parameters were identified by fitting the model onto patients plasma concentrations @xcite .",
    "the second compartment of the model is a result of a study , which focused on the pharmacodynamics of l - dopa through measuring the hand tapping score ( number of taps per minute ) with regard to l - dopa plasma concentration @xcite .",
