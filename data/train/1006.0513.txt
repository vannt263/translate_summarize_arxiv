    "to first order , stellar evolution theory is a success : an evolutionary picture unifying the gross statistical properties of stars and stellar populations has been developed . however , a number of current astrophysical puzzles demand a more accurate theory of star evolution than currently exists .",
    "examples include ( but are in no way restricted to ) : ( 1 ) understanding the initial conditions for explosions in massive stars , including core collapse supernovae and gamma ray bursts , ( 2 ) the formation of o - ne - mg cores and the possibility of accretion induced collapse ( aic ) , ( 3 ) the nucleosynthesis in agb stars , including heavy element ( z@xmath026 ) formation through the slow neutron capture process , or _",
    "s - process _ , and ( 4 ) the internal structure of the sun , and the _ tachocline _ in particular .",
    "all of these research areas rely heavily on stellar evolution calculations and suffer from unacceptably large theoretical uncertainties , in most cases related to an inadequate treatment of turbulent mixing processes .",
    "_ a 1d model .",
    "_ the basic framework for stellar evolution relies on the approximation of spherical symmetry .",
    "when rotation is strong enough to distort the star s shape from spherical symmetry the radial coordinate is replaced by an equipotential coordinate and quantities averaged over equipotential surfaces are evolved instead , thus retaining a one - dimensional treatment @xcite .",
    "the hydrodynamics governing stellar interiors are grossly simplified from the outset by this reduction in dimensionality , and a quasi - static approximation is generally adopted . any additional , non",
    "- radial hydro- and magneto - dynamic processes ( such as convection and internal waves ) are then incorporated on top of this quasi - static , 1d evolution in the form of transport processes , which will be discussed further below .",
    "the quasi - static equations for single star structure and evolution ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) involve the 1d formulations of mass , momentum , and energy conservation together with the auxiliary equations    @xmath1    which describe the mode of energy transport ( eq .  [ eq : transport ] ) and the compositional evolution of the stellar plasma ( eq .  [ eq : composition - evolution ] ) , where standard notation has been used and the temperature gradient is written in terms of @xmath2 ( not to be confused with the divergence operator in eq .  [",
    "eq : composition - evolution ] ) .",
    "the compositional flux @xmath3 is due to the cumulative effects of a variety of processes including turbulence , internal wave motions , and radiative levitation and elemental settling , while @xmath4 is the change in composition due to nuclear burning .",
    "the time evolution of the star is driven by the nuclear transmutation of matter and its heating , energy losses at the surface , neutrino cooling in the interior , and the indelible mixing of composition and angular momentum .",
    "the theory of stellar structure and evolution consists of trying to capture the dynamics of this complex system with fidelity .",
    "additional equations are required to incorporate the effects of angular momentum and magnetic fields , as well as mass loss from the surface and binary interactions , including tidal distortion and mass transfer .",
    "_ energy transport and convection .",
    "_ but even when considering non- rotating , non- magnetic , single star evolution the theory remains incomplete .",
    "energy transport and thermal instabilities in the stellar interior , and their attendant mixing processes , remain some of the most pernicious outstanding issues .",
    "energy is carried by radiation , thermal convection , or a combination of both .",
    "the theories underlying these different modes of energy transport determine the equilibrium temperature gradient @xmath5 appearing in eq .",
    "[ eq : transport ] .",
    "radiation transport is simplified in the deep interior where photon mean free paths ( m.f.p.s ) are small ( compared to any radial scale height in the star ) and a diffusion approximation is accurate . in this case",
    "the temperature structure depends primarily on the opacity of the plasma @xmath6 and one finds @xmath7 .    when @xmath8 the stellar plasma is unstable to thermal convection and a hydrodynamic flow ensues and modifies the underlying temperature stratification . in these regions a model for convective energy transport is required to calculate the temperature ( or entropy ) profile of the star .",
    "the almost universally adopted model is mixing length theory ( mlt ) which provides a functional dependence for @xmath5 on the stellar luminosity , structure , and microphysical properties of the plasma ( e.g. , opacities , equation of state , nuclear burning rates ) which is only slightly more complicated than the expression for @xmath9 defined above .",
    "finally , what is arguably the most complex situation regarding energy transport is when the convective instability extends into the photosphere in which case the diffusion approximation breaks down and one needs to treat simultaneously thermal convection and a complex radiation transport problem . in this case",
    "as well , the almost universally adopted approach is to use mlt and radiative diffusion in evolution models , despite the obvious physical shortcomings ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* for a discussion of the solar case ) .",
    "three dimensional radiation - hydrodynamic simulations ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are beginning to provide self - consistent solutions to this complex problem , facilitating detailed comparison between model and observation . a stronger foundation for interpreting helioseismic data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and inferring the abundances of various elemental constituents of the sun ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are benefitting tremendously from this work : these almost brute force approaches to solar surface convection are offering sufficiently precise information about interior structure to shed light on deeper astrophysical conundrums including the formation scenario of the sun @xcite and , in combination with solar neutrino observations , standard model physics @xcite .",
    "_ other instabilities and mixing .",
    "_ instabilities involving composition gradients @xcite , differential rotation @xcite , and magnetic fields @xcite are just as important as thermal convection with regards to interior mixing .",
    "this mixing is almost invariably treated as a diffusive process , taking the divergence of the compositional flux to be    @xmath10    the eulerian diffusion coefficient @xmath11 is most often formulated from a combination of characteristic length @xmath12 , velocity @xmath13 , and time scale @xmath14 , computed from linear stability theory @xcite , with @xmath15 or @xmath16 .",
    "@xcite provides a fairly comprehensive presentation of stellar physics in this `` diffusive '' spirit .",
    "caution is advised when using these results , however , since the development and mixing rates for these instabilities are not necessarily being represented correctly by this approach , particularly in light of the fact that the high reynolds number characterizing these flows ensure that the subsequent development will be highly turbulent and in the non - linear regime .",
    "see also @xcite for a related discussion on the modern stellar evolution model and its shortcomings in core - collapse progenitor modeling .",
    "two big open question are : ( 1 ) is a diffusive treatment for mixing ( as in eq .",
    "[ eq : diffusion ] ) appropriate ? ( 2 ) if not , how shall we improve this situation ?",
    "two processes have already been shown to differ dramatically from diffusion , including the flux of kinetic energy and the erosion of convective boundary layers due to convective overshoot .",
    "the kinetic energy flux is now known to carry a non - negligible fraction of the total luminosity of the star under many circumstances , contrary to mlt which takes this flux to be zero . in the rare case that this contribution to the luminosity is included in a stellar model",
    "it is usually treated using a `` down gradient approximation '' with @xmath17 @xcite , which is in direct conflict with simulated flow as well as basic considerations of energy conservation @xcite .",
    "similarly , the evolution of convective boundaries are likely to evolve in a manner which is far from diffusive in nature , and behave instead as sharp entrainment interfaces , which will be discussed further in  [ sec : future ] .",
    "_ quantifying uncertainty .",
    "_ while the uncertainty inherent in the stellar modeling framework is difficult to quantify , a formal lower bound can be assessed by comparing stellar parameters calculated in the following ways .",
    "( 1 ) the results from a variety of evolution codes which have nominally the same input physics and parameters can be compared .",
    "this exercise addresses the question : how accurately is the mathematical model being captured by the numerical implementation ? ( 2 ) the results from a single code using a range of plausible adjustable parameters and input physics can be compared .",
    "this addresses the question : how sensitive is the stellar model to uncertainties in the input physics and parameters within the framework being used ?    while some effort has been exerted to obtain consistency between different implementations of the same physical model ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , code to code scatter persists even for the relatively simple case of main sequence evolution .",
    "a recent comparison between the inferred properties of massive o and b stars within 500 pc @xcite using three modern evolution codes @xcite indicate uncertainties at the @xmath1820 - 25 % level .",
    "similar degrees of uncertainty were found when computing the mass limits associated with o - ne - mg core formation in intermediate mass stars @xcite .    of deeper concern",
    "is the range of evolutionary outcomes found for the same initial conditions using what are apparently an acceptable range of plausible input physics and adjustable parameters .",
    "this is discussed next .    _ mass limits . _ an informative way to summarize a stellar evolution model is to calculate various mass limits .",
    "examples include : the mass above which a star will form a black hole , @xmath19 ; the mass above which core helium burning ignites under non - degenerate conditions , @xmath20 ; the mass above which an iron core forms and undergoes gravitational collapse , @xmath21 ; etc .",
    "a summary of such limits for massive star evolution , with an emphasis on core - collapse supernova theory , is presented by @xcite ; and the fate of massive agb stars and the potential for o - ne - mg core collapse are discussed by @xcite and @xcite .    by comparing the mass limits found from a finely enough sampled grid of models and observational stellar data , the theoretical model can be tested .",
    "the landmark paper by @xcite used this approach to examine the consistency between stellar cluster data and their evolution model , and concluded that additional mixing can bring observationally inferred and theoretically calculated mass limits into better agreement , and summarized this in terms of an `` overshoot '' parameter @xmath22 , a quantitative value which remains preferred among stellar population modelers for stars having masses larger than a few times solar ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in addition to the overshoot parameter , which is a measure of how much material mixes beyond the limits of a formally defined unstable region , the mixing processes mentioned in  [ sec : framework ] also shift mass limits .",
    "the double diffusive instability arising in thermally unstable regions which are stabilized by composition gradients , dubbed `` semiconvection '' @xcite , is particularly important in massive star evolution .",
    "this process can change the mass of the he core following main sequence evolution , perhaps the parameter most indicative of how a massive star will end its life , by a factor of @xmath1850% or more @xcite .",
    "when to include this mixing process or not , and its strengths when included , remain open questions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "fortunately , interesting constraints can be placed on stellar evolution theory by observational data when the observational uncertainties are less than a few percent . both asteroseismic and wide eclipsing binary data , which we discuss next",
    ", are beginning to meet these requirements .",
    "_ wide eclipsing binaries . _ observationally determined effective temperatures ( @xmath23 ) , luminosities ( @xmath24 ) , radii ( @xmath25 ) , and masses ( @xmath26 ) are known for many of these systems to better than a few percent @xcite . in some cases precision surface rotational velocities ( @xmath27_1 , [ v\\sin i]_2 $ ] ) and compositions @xmath28 are also available .",
    "a stellar evolution model can be tested against this data by comparing , e.g. , the model radii and temperatures @xmath29 , where the hat symbol indicates model data . here",
    "the stellar masses and compositions are also known observationally to high precision .",
    "the age of the binary system @xmath30 is a fitting parameter , and the theoretical model is represented by the function @xmath31 and the parameter set @xmath32 .",
