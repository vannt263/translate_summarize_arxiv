    "an important class of problems in mathematics take the following prototypical form : given a riemmanian manifold , find a conformally equivalent metric satisfying certain prescribed properties .",
    "conformal mapping problems _ arise ubiquitiously , and their solutions are invaluable to many areas of applied mathematics , physics , and engineering .    inspired largely by these applications , considerable",
    "work has been done in developing notions of _ discrete conformal maps_. of particular interest have been discretizations that preserve certain structural properties and characteristics of their continuum counterparts .",
    "such discretizations have shown to contain a surprisingly profound and rich theory of their own , and their study is an exciting and flourishing area of mathematics today .    the main purpose of this paper is to note a correspondence between continuum conformal mapping problems that arise in the study of vortices in the abelian higgs field theory ( see @xcite ) and certain discrete conformal mapping problems studied in @xcite .",
    "the abelian higgs field theory first arose as a phenomenological model of superconductivity .",
    "the model admits vortex solutions , which are topogically stable , finite energy solutions to the field equations .",
    "physically , the vortices are crucial in understanding the meissner effect of magnetic repulsion in superconductors",
    ". it was observed by witten @xcite that in some circumstances , the equations describing vortices are closely related to the liouville equation for the conformal factor of constant curvature surfaces , which he exploited to construct explicit vortex solutions .",
    "this was further generalized by recent work by @xcite , who showed that the vortex equations can be reformulated as a conformal mapping problem involving prescribed linear combinations of the gaussian curvature and the riemannian volume form .    on the other hand , @xcite studied discrete conformal maps of triangulations , in which metrics correspond to edge lengths and conformal transformations to scale factors associated with vertices .",
    "these notions were generalized to hyperbolic and spherical triangulations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "several types of associated mapping problems were studied and shown to be solvable by variational principles .",
    "we argue that these discrete conformal problems correspond naturally to continuum problems involving combinations of the curvature and volume form .",
    "we then explain how the discrete conformal theory can be used to construct discrete vortex solutions .",
