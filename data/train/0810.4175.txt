    "it has a clear peak near the top quark mass .",
    "b - tagging is not used in this study , and no requirement on missing transverse energy is made . that makes this analysis suitable for the very early stage , when these aspects of detector response are not well understood .",

    "the event selection requires two isolated leptons ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 or @xmath11 ) , missing transverse energy @xmath12 , the direction of the missing transverse momentum should be non - parallel to the muon , and @xmath13 decays are vetoed .",

    "the `` data '' distribution is fit with a linear combination of monte carlo templates for signal and background processes .",
    "it is found that a @xmath15 observation of the signal can be made with @xmath3 of integrated luminosity , and with @xmath16 one can expect the following precision on the cross - section measurement : @xmath17 here systematics from qcd showering , isr / fsr , jet energy scale , trigger efficiency , electron identification efficiency and lepton fakes are included in the `` ( sys ) '' number , and effects of the parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) and luminosity uncertainties are shown separately .",
    "to0pt to0pt    the abundant production of top quarks at the lhc , and its well established decay properties make it an excellent tool for calibrating the detectors . the higher multiplicities and transverse momenta of jets in @xmath1 decays , compared to other standard model processes , make the calibration environment more similar to the one expected in many new physics searches .",
    "the predominant decay mode of the top quark is @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "one expects to find two b - jets in a @xmath1 event .",
    "a way to extract the b - tagging efficiency @xmath19 from data is to count the number of b - tagged jets in a sample of @xmath1 events , and perform a poisson likelihood fit to this distribution .",

    "another method for measuring b - tagging efficiency with @xmath1 events is based on identification of a pure sample of b - jets by reconstructing the @xmath1 decay topology .",
    "unlike the tag counting method described above , the topological selection method allows the study of @xmath19 as a function of b - jet parameters . a cms study",

    "the latest result that was shown in this conference @xcite , @xmath32 , is systematics dominated .",

    "the expected single top channel cross - sections are @xmath39  pb , @xmath40  pb , and @xmath41  pb . measuring the cross - sections is complicated by large backgrounds from @xmath1 and @xmath27+jets processes . some studies in @xcite that use cut - based , boosted decision tree ( bdt ) , and likelihood approaches are summarized in table  [ t : single - top ] .",
    "for example , the bdt analysis in the t - channel will allow the measurement of @xmath38 with relative precision @xmath42 .        the large value of the top mass , which is close to the electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) scale , may point to a special role that the top quark plays in the symmetry breaking .",
    "new resonances or gauge bosons strongly coupled to the top quark , such as in technicolor , topcolor , or other strong ewsb models , or in models with extra dimensions , could be manifest in the invariant mass distribution of top quark pairs .",
    "the experimental challenges are @xmath1 reconstruction efficiency , which drops as the resonance mass increases because decay products of a boosted top quark start to overlap , and the resolution of the reconstructed @xmath1 mass .",
    "a generic narrow resonance at @xmath43 with @xmath44 can be discovered with a @xmath15 significance after @xmath23 of data taking .",
