    "during a recent search for globular clusters ( gc ) in ngc  1023 , a lenticular galaxy at approximately @xmath4  mpc distance , larsen & brodie ( 2000 ) found faint objects ( @xmath0  mag ) that have gc luminosities but effective radii ( @xmath5 half - light radii ) of @xmath6 to @xmath2  pc which is much larger than ordinary gcs that have effective radii of @xmath7 to @xmath8  pc . using spectra obtained with the keck telescope they ( brodie & larsen 2002 ) confirmed that these objects belong to ngc  1023 and have ages of about @xmath9 to @xmath10  gyr , are moderately metal rich ( @xmath11 = -0.58 \\pm 0.24 $ ] ) while showing a super - solar @xmath12-element abundance ( @xmath13 = + 0.3 $ ] to @xmath14 ) .",
    "while gc are usually connected with the spherical component of a galaxy , these new objects appear to be situated in the disc of ngc  1023 .",
    "the distribution of these objects shows rotation around the galaxy .",
    "the authors conclude that they have found a new class of star clusters which they call `` faint fuzzies '' .",
    "+ ngc  1023 has a dwarf companion ( ngc  1023a ) with which it is steadily interacting , and due to its lenticular appearance it probably suffered from interactions and mergers in the past leading to strong star formation events .",
    "+ interactions between gas - rich galaxies lead to strong star formation events .",
    "for example , hst - images of the antennae reveal ( whitmore et al .",
    "1999 ) that the knots of intense star formation produce clusters of massive young star clusters .",
    "these `` super - clusters '' ( @xmath5 clusters of star clusters ; not to be confused with super stellar clusters ( ssc ) , which are individual massive star clusters ) appear to contain dozens to hundreds of massive star clusters within a region spanning a few hundred pc to a kpc in diameter .",
    "+ here we report n - body results concerning the dynamical evolution of such super - clusters .",
    "the resulting merger objects have similar properties as the `` faint fuzzies '' .",
    "we use the particle - mesh code superbox ( fellhauer et al.2000 ) which incorporates a hierarchical grid architecture allowing high resolution at the places of interest .",
    "+ we model the single star clusters as plummer spheres ( plummer 1911 , numerical realisation : aarseth et al .  1974 ) with a plummer radius of @xmath15  pc , which corresponds to the mean half - light radius found for the individual young star clusters in the antennae ( whitmore et al .",
    "@xmath16 star clusters with a mass range of @xmath17  m@xmath18 following a power - law mass spectrum , @xmath19 are placed in a plummer distribution with plummer radius @xmath20 representing the super - cluster .",
    "the super - cluster orbits on an eccentric orbit around the host galaxy represented by an analytical potential , which consists of a disc modelled as a plummer - kuzmin potential and a spherical halo component modelled as a logarithmic potential : @xmath21 with @xmath22  m@xmath18 , @xmath23  kpc , @xmath24  kpc , @xmath25  km / s and @xmath26  kpc which sums up to an almost flat rotation curve with a rotation speed of @xmath27  kms@xmath28 .",
    "+ several simulations with different values for the scale length @xmath29 of the super - cluster , different initial masses @xmath30 of the super - cluster and different orbits around the host galaxy are performed to study the evolution of the resulting merger object .",
    "the computational setup closely follows that used in previous studies ( fellhauer et al .",
    "2002 ; fellhauer & kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "+ it is possible to follow the evolution with a particle - mesh code that neglects dynamical effects of two - body relaxation , because the half - mass ( bulk ) two - body relaxation times of the single star clusters , which can be estimated by ( binney & tremaine 1987 ) @xmath31 is @xmath32  myr for a @xmath33  m@xmath18 star cluster ranging up to @xmath34  gyr for a @xmath35  m@xmath18 star cluster , while the merging timescale is much shorter ( fellhauer et al.2002 ) .",
    "furthermore , as shown below , the resulting merger objects have relaxation times of a hubble - time or longer .",
    "in a previous paper ( fellhauer et al .  2002 ) it was shown that the star clusters inside a super - cluster merge within a few crossing times of the super - cluster ( typically @xmath36 to @xmath37  myr ) .",
    "the resulting merger objects are stable and compact .",
    "their masses range from being similar to gcs , in cases where the tidal field removes a large fraction of the individual clusters leaving merger objects consisting of only a few star clusters . on the other hand ,",
    "when the super - cluster is sufficiently concentrated and the tidal field is correspondingly weak the merger object evolves to become an ultra - compact dwarf galaxy ( ucd ) ( fellhauer & kroupa 2002 ) , a new class of objects discovered recently in the fornax galaxy cluster ( phillipps et al .",
    "2002 ; hilker et al .",
    "1999 ) . to show the different results of a wide range of our simulations we plot the effective radii and the masses of the merger objects as a function of the plummer radius of the super - cluster ( fig .",
    "[ fig : reff ] ) .",
    "even if tidal forces are strong , compact and massive super - clusters evolve into extended objects with lifetimes significantly longer than @xmath38  gyr although they orbit well inside the disc .",
    "+ here we give the results of a simulation ( oc03 , filled box in fig .",
    "[ fig : reff ] ) where the super - cluster was placed on an orbit within the galactic disc which accounts for the scenario in ngc  1023 .",
    "the resulting merger object is far too massive to be one of the `` faint fuzzies '' found in ngc  1023 , rather resembling an object like @xmath39-cen in our milky way but with two additional simulations we show that these results still hold for less massive objects like the faint extended star clusters in ngc  1023 .",
    "+ the super - cluster has initially a plummer radius of @xmath40  pc and a cut - off radius of @xmath41  pc .",
    "it contains 262 star clusters following the power law of eq .",
    "[ eq : massspec ] with a total mass of @xmath42  m@xmath18 .",
    "the crossing time of the super - cluster is @xmath43  myr and the internal velocity dispersion of the clusters in the super - cluster is @xmath44  kms@xmath28 .",
    "additionally we choose the sense of rotation of all clusters in the super - cluster to be the same to investigate the resulting rotation - law of the merger object .",
    "a super - cluster is expected to rotate if it forms from a contracting and locally differentially rotating inner tidal arm .",
    "the super - cluster is placed on an eccentric orbit with perigalacticon at @xmath45  kpc and apogalacticon at @xmath46  kpc .",
    "the orbit is inclined such that the maximum @xmath47-distance from the disc plane is about @xmath7  kpc .",
    "the parameters are chosen to be representative of the knots seen to contain many star clusters in the antennae galaxies ( fellhauer & kroupa 2002 ) , while the orbital inclination is motivated by the orbit of @xmath39-cen ( dinescu et al .",
    "a possible link between @xmath39-cen and merged super - clusters has already been pointed out by fellhauer & kroupa ( 2002 ) .",
    "+ within the first @xmath41  myr a merger object forms with a bound mass of about @xmath48  m@xmath18",
    ". the half - mass radius of this object is @xmath49  pc and the @xmath50% lagrangian - radius is of the order of @xmath51  pc at that time .",
    "the surface density profile of the merger object follows a shallow power law of @xmath52 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : surf]a .",
    "the 3-dimensional central velocity dispersion is @xmath53  kms@xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vel]a ) .",
    "it also shows a maximum rotation velocity of about @xmath38  kms@xmath28 at a distance of about @xmath54  pc from the centre ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vel]a ) . the bulk relaxation time ( eq .  [ eq : relax ] ) of the merger object is @xmath55  gyr which is longer than the age of the universe .",
    "+ the tidal radius calculated using the equation 7 - 84 from binney & tremaine ( 1987 ) @xmath56 where @xmath57 denotes the distance to centre of the galaxy and @xmath58 is the enclosed mass of the galaxy at that distance and @xmath59 is the bound mass of the merger object , is about @xmath60  pc at perigalacticon .",
    "therefore the object becomes tidally shaped and looses mass with every perigalacticon passage .",
    "after @xmath38  gyr of simulation time the merger object has lost about half its mass ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass]a ) .",
    "the central surface density drops down to @xmath61  m@xmath18pc@xmath62 .",
    "the profile can be fitted with a king profile with king radius ( @xmath5 effective radius ) of @xmath63  pc .",
    "an alternative fit is an exponential profile in the inner part ( @xmath64 ) and a steep power law with @xmath65 for the outer part ( fig .",
    "[ fig : surf]b ) . the half - mass radius has shrunk down to @xmath66  pc , the @xmath50% lagrangian - radius to @xmath67  pc .",
    "the tidal radius is determined to be @xmath68  pc at the last perigalacticon and @xmath69  pc at the actual position .",
    "also the central velocity dispersion and the maximum rotation speed has dropped as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : vel]b . the bulk relaxation time ( following eq .",

    "the plummer - radii of the super - clusters are chosen to be @xmath75  pc .",
    "the orbits of the super - clusters have the same eccentricity as in the first simulation but are placed in the @xmath76-@xmath77-plane of the galaxy instead of being inclined .",
    "+ in the oc07 simulation a merger object containing @xmath78 out of the initial @xmath75 star clusters develops after @xmath79  myr .",
    "after @xmath38  gyr this merger object has a bound mass of @xmath80  m@xmath18 ( fig .",

    "it s surface density profile can be fitted with a king profile with a central surface density of @xmath82  m@xmath18pc@xmath62 and a king radius ( which corresponds to the effective radius ) of @xmath83  pc .",
    "fitting an exponential profile to the inner part gives @xmath84  m@xmath18pc@xmath62 and an exponential scale length of about @xmath15  pc .",
    "the outer part can again be fitted with a steep power law @xmath85 ( fig .  [",

    "the oc08 simulation shows a merger object which developed out of @xmath49 star clusters . again",
    "the merging process is finished after about @xmath79  myr .",
    "the mass of the merger object after @xmath38  gyr is @xmath87  m@xmath18 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass]a ) and the tidal radius is @xmath88  pc . fitting a king profile to the surface density distribution ( fig .",
    "[ fig : surf2]b ) gives the following values : central surface density of @xmath89  m@xmath18pc@xmath62 and an effective radius of @xmath46  pc .",
    "the exponential fit has the values @xmath90",
    "m@xmath18pc@xmath62 and @xmath91  pc .",
    "the power law fit to the outer part has an power - law index of @xmath92 . + the above results ( total mass and central surface density )",
    "can be converted to total blue luminosity and central surface brightness using mass - to - light ratios taken from a single stellar population model of starburst99 ( leitherer et al .",
    "the programme adopts a salpeter imf .",
    "therefore , we choose a minimum stellar mass of @xmath93  m@xmath18 and a maximum mass of @xmath79  m@xmath18 .",
    "note that we truncate the salpeter imf at @xmath93  m@xmath18 .",
    "this roughly accounts for the flattening of the imf below @xmath94  m@xmath18 ( kroupa 2002 ) .",
    "the evolution of @xmath95 with time is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mass]b as obtained as a result of stellar evolution from starburst99 .",
    "we stop the photometric evolution from starburst99 when @xmath96 is reached because starburst99 overestimates the @xmath97 at high ages quite substantially .",
    "instead we take a linear fading with time as proposed by the models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) of @xmath7 magnitudes from @xmath8 to @xmath2  gyr .",
    "this enables us to place the evolutionary track of our merger objects into a central surface brightness , @xmath98 , vs absolute photometric b - band magnitude , @xmath99 , diagram ( the kormendy diagram ; fig .  [ fig : korm ] ) .",
    "the endpoint of the evolution of our merger objects is also the region where the `` faint fuzzies '' are located .",
    "the faint fuzzies have total luminosities of about @xmath100 ( larsen & brodie 2002 ) .",
    "we estimate their location in the kormendy diagram in the following way .",
    "first we set @xmath101 ( i.e.  adopting @xmath102 as an admissible approximation for the diagram ) then we convert the total luminosity into a total mass using @xmath103 . with this mass",
    "we calculate the tidal radius in our model potential and orbit ( @xmath104  pc ) and adopt an effective ( or king- ) radius of @xmath105  pc . using a king profile we estimate the central surface brightness to be @xmath106  mag .",
    "s0 ( lenticular ) galaxies are commonly believed to have suffered from interactions with other galaxies which transformed their morphology from a late - type spiral into their early - type form ( kennicutt 1998 ; abraham & van den bergh 2001 ) .",
    "therefore the type of ngc  1023 tells us that this galaxy suffered maybe several but at least one strong interaction ( merger ) with another galaxy .",
    "as is seen in interacting galaxies these events lead to an enhanced star formation activity and to an enhanced rate of super nova explosions of massive stars which accounts for the super - solar enhancement of @xmath12-elements .",
    "many of the new stars mostly form in star clusters which are also grouped in super - clusters , as is demonstrated by the antennae and stephan s quintet ( gallagher et al .",
    "these super - clusters are bound entities and form , through successive mergers of their constituent star clusters , new objects which are larger than ordinary gcs .",
    "our simulations show that even strong tidal fields are not able to destroy these objects and they survive for a hubble - time .",
    "+ the `` faint fuzzies '' found in ngc  1023 may have therefore formed as super - clusters during the interactions and the resulting star bursts that shaped ngc  1023 . like in the antennae",
    "the super - clusters were born within the galaxy and not in the outer tidal tails . therefore the `` faint fuzzies '' , which one can call extended globular clusters or small ultra - compact dwarf galaxies by virtue of their long two - body relaxation time , stay within the optically visible galaxy and show a similar rotation pattern like the disc .",
    "these objects can be old because they are able to survive until the present , they may be rotating and have different populations of stars if old field stars were captured by the young super - cluster .",
    "+ given the ubiquity of young super - clusters in the antennae and stephan s quintet , it appears reasonable to expect that such objects form whenever strong star bursts occur .",
    "it is therefore exciting , but retrospectively not very surprising , that `` faint fuzzies '' were discovered in a lenticular galaxy .",
    "+ super - clusters that form in outer tidal tails may leave the mother galaxy either by being ejected by the merging galaxies or become unbound due to a tidal field from the galaxy cluster .",
    "such merger objects will appear similar to the ucds in fornax ( fig .",
    "[ fig : evol ] ) . a related object may be @xmath39-cen in our milky way , which is quite different and more massive than the other gcs .",
    "it incorporates at least two different populations of stars and shows a rotation - law resembling that of our merger object ( freeman 2001 ) .",
    "@xmath39-cen is quite old and could therefore be a relic of a star - burst during the formation of the milky way .",
    "we are investigating the hypothesis that @xmath39-cen may also be related to super - clusters .",
    "[ fig : evol ] summarises in a schematic way the possible evolutionary paths and resulting objects that may form under this hypothesis .",
