    "the trojans are a distant group of asteroids dynamically linked to jupiter by a 1:1 mean motion resonance which causes them to librate about stable lagrangian equilibrium points located @xmath4 in front of ( l4 ) and behind ( l5 ) jupiter along its orbit .",
    "because trojans orbit far from the sun and also have low albedos , they suffer from a low discovery rate and hence are underrepresented among numbered asteroids . extrapolating from the identified trojan objects , shoemaker _",
    "et al . _  ( 1989 ) estimate that the total trojan population contains nearly half as many asteroids as the main belt .",
    "the large number of trojans and their strong dynamical connection to jupiter make determining their origins an important goal ; by understanding the early history of the trojans , we may also gain insight into jupiter s formation and early evolution .",
    "clues about the origins of the trojan asteroids may be found in their current physical and orbital properties , which include the overlapping signatures of mechanisms which captured them into librating orbits , as well as processes which have contributed to the population s evolution over time .",
    "some distinctive characteristics of the current trojan asteroids include a small mean eccentricity of @xmath5 , a small mean libration amplitude of @xmath6 , and a large mean inclination of @xmath7 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . also , nearly twice as many asteroids have been observed librating about the l4 point as about the l5 point .",
    "this , however , may simply be the result of observational selection effects ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are many competing theories for the origin and evolution of the trojan asteroids .",
    "it has been suggested that the trojans may have originally been comets ( @xcite ) or near - jupiter planetesimals ( _ e.g. _  @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been considered for capturing these objects into trojan orbits , including collisions between objects , drag forces , and mass accretion by jupiter .",
    "et al . _  ( 1989 ) theorized that collisional emplacement of fragments of near - jupiter planetesimals during the dispersion of the planetesimal swarm may have provided most of the trojan objects .",
    "more recently , numerical modeling of the collisional evolution of the trojan population ( marzari _ et al . _",
    "1997 ) has shown that collisions are largely responsible for shaping the current size distribution of the smaller trojans , as well as having caused the escape of some of the trojan objects into chaotic orbits . long - term numerical integrations by levison _",
    "et al . _  ( 1997 ) have also shown that the trojan population is dynamically unstable and that dynamical diffusion has contributed and continues to contribute to the loss of trojan objects .",
    "various types of drag forces acting on jupiter and/or the trojan precursors have also been examined .",
    "kary and lissauer ( 1995 ) considered solar nebular gas drag .",
    "they showed numerically that gas drag could cause planetesimals to be captured into 1:1 resonance with a protoplanet .",
    "interestingly , they found that such capture is rare for planets on circular orbits , but quite common for planets with appreciable eccentricities .",
    "gas drag may also have played a significant role in evolving the trojan population into its present form , provided that the trojan precursors were captured before the dispersion of the solar nebula ( peale 1993 ) .",
    "yoder ( 1979 ) looked at the effects of dynamical friction during jupiter s dispersal of the planetesimal swarm , which caused a slight inward migration of jupiter .",
    "he argued that this migration would cause a decrease in the libration amplitudes of jupiter s trojan companions ( see , however , table  i ) .",
    "the possibility that a change in jupiter s mass could be responsible for the capture of the trojan asteroids was investigated by rabe ( 1954 ) who argued analytically that a decrease in jupiter s mass could cause its satellites to move onto trojan orbits .",
    "more recently , marzari and scholl ( 1998 ) showed numerically that an increase in jupiter s mass could cause the capture of planetesimals into librating orbits .",
    "they used a proto - jupiter on a `` best guess '' orbit growing simultaneously with saturn over a period of @xmath8 or @xmath9 years , and found that a large fraction of the planetesimals initially on horseshoe orbits and a small percentage of those initially orbiting near the 1:1 resonance were captured into tadpole orbits .",
    "past changes in jupiter s mass have also long been considered as a potentially significant evolutionary mechanism for creating the current distribution of trojan asteroids ; however , attempts to predict the exact form of the effects of jupiter s growth on the trojans have thus far been contradictory . for an increase in jupiter s mass ,",
    "rabe ( 1954 ) theorized that the trojan libration amplitudes would increase , horedt ( 1974a , 1974b , 1984 ) argued that they would not be appreciably affected , and yoder ( 1979 ) argued that they would decrease ( table  i ) .    in this paper , we focus on the changes which jupiter underwent early in its history .",
    "we investigate the significance of jupiter s mass growth and radial migration as trojan capture mechanisms and especially as mechanisms for evolving the trojan population .",
    "we focus on these two processes in isolation in order to fully characterize their behavior . other potentially important processes including gas drag , the gravity of other planets , and collisions amongst trojans are not considered here , because models which include all of these effects would have a large number of poorly - determined free parameters .",
    "for example , with gas drag , what is the gas density as a function of distance from the sun ? when and exactly how does jupiter form a gap in the gas distribution ?",
    "how sensitive are trojan asteroids to different gas drag models ?",
    "these questions are important and need to be studied in depth .",
    "there are many open questions like these in the full trojan formation problem , probably more than can be addressed in a single paper .",
    "accordingly , we have chosen to study individual processes first for later incorporation into a more general model .",
    "a strong advantage to this approach is that investigating individual processes in detail will ultimately lead to a deeper physical understanding of results from more complicated models .    adopting this approach , we first present consistent analytic and numerical results which show the effects of jupiter s growth and radial migration on its trojan companions in the limit of a slowly - changing jupiter , thus settling the previous controversy .",
    "we then explore the working of these mechanisms for a wide range of timescales , initial trojan libration amplitudes , jupiter eccentricities , and asteroid eccentricities and inclinations .",
    "consider the planar circular restricted three - body problem , in which two massive bodies move about each other in circular orbits due to their mutual gravitation and a third body of infinitesimal mass moves in the orbital plane of the two massive objects .",
    "this system admits five equilibrium points where a test particle can have zero velocity and zero acceleration in the frame which corotates with the primary masses about their common center of mass ( danby 1988 ) .",
    "three of these points lie along the line through the two primaries and are unstable .",
    "the other two , l4 and l5 , lie at the tips of the equilateral triangles whose bases are the line connecting the primary masses ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "these are called the triangular lagrangian equilibrium points and are stable to small oscillations so long as the mass ratio of the primaries , @xmath10 ( where @xmath11 and @xmath12 are the larger and smaller of the primary masses , respectively ) , satisfies @xmath13 ( @xcite ) .",
    "this condition is met for all sun - planet and planet - moon pairs in the solar system , with the exception of pluto and charon .",
    "the planar circular restricted three - body problem is a reasonable approximation for the system consisting of the sun , jupiter , and a trojan asteroid , since the asteroid s mass is insignificant in comparison to either jupiter or the sun , and jupiter s eccentricity is relatively small ( @xmath14 currently ) . if we make the further approximations that the trojan s oscillations about its equilibrium position are small and that the asteroid is on a nearly circular orbit , then , noting that @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the mass of the sun and @xmath17 is the mass of jupiter , the motion of the asteroid is well approximated by the equation @xmath18 ( @xcite ) , where @xmath19 is the difference between the mean longitudes of the asteroid and jupiter , @xmath20^{1/2 } \\label{nj}\\ ] ]    is the mean motion of jupiter ( @xmath21 is jupiter s semimajor axis and @xmath22 is the gravitational constant ) , and an overdot signifies differentiation with respect to time .",
    "the observed librational motions of the trojan asteroids are well approximated by the solution of eq .",
    "[ tmotion ] ,    @xmath23    where @xmath24 @xmath25 is time , and @xmath26 and @xmath27 are constants .",
    "note that @xmath28 is the amplitude of the @xmath19 oscillations .",
    "the libration amplitude , @xmath26 , is defined to be the total angular extent of these oscillations ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "equivalently , the system can be described by the hamiltonian : @xmath29 the canonical variables for this hamiltonian are @xmath30 and @xmath31 , so that @xmath32 , and @xmath33 reproduces the equation of motion ( eq .",
    "[ tmotion ] ) .    when changes are made to this system ( _ e.g. _  mass growth of one of the primaries or the addition of an external drag force ) , the hamiltonian is no longer conserved .",
    "however , if the changes to the hamiltonian system are slow enough , it can be shown that the action , @xmath34 , is approximately conserved ( @xcite ) .",
    "such slow changes are called adiabatic changes , and @xmath35 is an adiabatic invariant . using the expressions for @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath19 above , we determine the action for the three - body system : @xmath38 where we have evaluated the integral by using the adiabatic approximation that @xmath21 , @xmath26 , and @xmath39 are constant over one libration period .",
    "the conservation of the action can be written in the useful form : @xmath40 where the subscripts @xmath41 and @xmath42 indicate the initial and final values of the variables , respectively .    for radial migration of jupiter",
    ", we can find the resulting change in the trojan s libration amplitude directly from eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] ; since changing @xmath21 has no effect on @xmath17 , the factor @xmath43 is equal to 1",
    ". then , for a physically reasonable inward radial migration of jupiter from approximately 6.2 au to 5.2 au ( see section 4 ) , eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] predicts an increase in the trojan s libration amplitude of only @xmath2 .",
    "determining the effects of jupiter s mass growth on the trojan s libration amplitude is a bit more subtle , since increasing @xmath17 may affect @xmath21 as well as @xmath26 .",
    "in order to determine how changing @xmath17 affects @xmath21 , we digress briefly to discuss a second adiabatic invariant calculation .",
    "if we consider the two - body system of jupiter and the sun moving about one another on elliptical orbits due to their mutual gravitation , we can calculate an invariant action for slow changes in the mass of either body . noting that , in this case , adiabatic means that changes to the system are negligible over one orbital period",
    ", we find    @xmath44    this result was contemplated nearly one hundred years ago when strmgen ( 1903 ) considered what effect mass accretion by the earth would have on the orbit of the moon ( see also @xcite ) . for our case",
    ", the invariance of @xmath45 means that if the mass of either jupiter or the sun were slowly decreased , jupiter s orbit would drift outward .",
    "this effect is well known ( _ e.g. _  horedt 1984 ) and was observed recently in numerical simulations by duncan and lissauer ( 1998 ) in which the orbits of the outer planets were seen to expand as the mass of the sun was decreased to a small fraction of its original value .",
    "similarly , if either jupiter or the sun slowly accretes mass , jupiter s semimajor axis will decrease .",
    "note that eq .",
    "[ 2bconstant ] implies that adding a jovian mass of material to either jupiter or the sun produces the same change in the semimajor axis of the system .",
    "returning to our discussion of the effects of jupiter s mass growth on its trojan companions , we see from eq .",
    "[ 2bconstant ] that if we change the mass of jupiter adiabatically , the semimajor axis of jupiter s orbit will be altered according to @xmath46 substituting this into eq .  [ analyticresult ] , we see the full effect which altering @xmath17 has on the trojan s libration amplitude : @xmath47 since @xmath48 , the second term in parentheses is very nearly equal to 1 , and the change in @xmath26 is given sufficiently accurately by eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] if we simply take @xmath49 .",
    "we find that the growth of jupiter by gas accretion from a @xmath50 core to its present mass of @xmath51 causes @xmath26 to decrease to @xmath52 of its original value .",
    "thus , if librating trojan asteroids were already present when jupiter was a @xmath0 core , then the effects of jupiter s mass increase would be substantial and would dominate over the effects of its radial migration .",
    "the effect of jupiter s radial migration is comparable to its mass accretion only if the planet moves inward by a factor of @xmath53 , _",
    "e.g. _  from 150 au to 5 au , substantially more than current theories predict .",
    "there has been some significant confusion in the literature about the effects of jupiter s mass growth on the libration amplitudes of its trojan companions ( see table  i ) .",
    "our analytic result for the effects of jovian mass growth disagrees with the findings of rabe ( 1954 ) and horedt ( 1974a , 1974b , 1984 ) , but agrees exactly , in both direction and magnitude , with the conclusions of yoder ( 1979 ) .",
    "our prediction for the effects of jupiter s radial migration , however , disagrees with yoder s 1979 result ( see table  i ) .",
    "statements in yoder _",
    "et al . _  ( 1983 ) about the tidal evolution of the saturnian satellites janus and epimetheus , however , are inconsistent with yoder s 1979 calculations , but agree , at least in sign , with our radial migration results . in order to dispel this confusion",
    ", we carefully verify our analytic predictions with numerical simulations in sections 3 and 4 below .",
    "we can make further use of the two - body adiabatic invariant for the sun - jupiter system ( eq .",
    "[ 2bconstant ] ) to gain additional insight into the meaning of the three - body adiabatic invariant ( eq .  [ taction ] ) .",
    "when @xmath26 and @xmath54 are both very small , the trojan asteroid orbit , viewed in the frame which corotates with jupiter , looks like a little ellipse centered on one of the lagrangian equilibrium points with the ratio of its semimajor to semiminor axis equal to @xmath55 ( murray and dermott 1999 ) .",
    "the area within this ellipse is @xmath56 for a small tadpole orbit , the libration amplitude times the semimajor axis of jupiter s orbit is approximately equal to the major axis of the ellipse ( @xmath57 ) .",
    "thus we can rewrite eq .",
    "[ area1 ] as @xmath58 where we have used the two- and three - body adiabatic invariants defined in eqs .",
    "[ 2bconstant ] and [ taction ] , respectively .",
    "so , we find : @xmath59 thus , the invariance of the action for the three - body system implies that the dimensionless area enclosed by a small - amplitude trojan orbit ( _ i.e. , _ the area enclosed by the trojan orbit divided by the square of jupiter s semimajor axis ) , remains constant for an adiabatic change to the system .",
    "for example , as jupiter accretes mass , the resulting change in @xmath21 is relatively small , so as @xmath26 decreases , the radial width of the trojan orbit must increase in order to keep the area nearly constant ( see fig .  1 ) .",
    "note , however , that the area within the tadpole orbit in fig .  1 is not strictly conserved because the libration amplitude of the tadpole is quite large .",
    "finally , we can use the two - body adiabatic invariant for the sun - jupiter system ( eq .",
    "[ 2bconstant ] ) to determine what effect changing the mass of the sun has on the libration amplitudes of jupiter trojans .",
    "the dependence of @xmath26 on @xmath16 is present in eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] through the factor @xmath60 . we know from @xmath45 ( eq .  [ 2bconstant ] )",
    "that if the mass of the sun is altered adiabatically , @xmath21 will change according to @xmath61    combining this with eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] , we find @xmath62 for an adiabatic change in @xmath16 .",
    "thus , slowly increasing the mass of the sun increases the libration amplitude of the trojan , which is the opposite of the effect on @xmath26 caused by adding mass to jupiter .",
    "additional adiabatic invariant calculations determine the effects of changing jupiter s mass and semimajor axis on a trojan asteroid s eccentricity , @xmath63 , and inclination , @xmath64 .",
    "for the case when @xmath65 , we approximate the orbit of the trojan as an inclined circle . then , the motion of the asteroid in the @xmath66-direction can be well represented by simple harmonic motion with a restoring force equal to the sum of the @xmath66-components of the gravitational forces of the sun and jupiter acting on the asteroid . if we assume that the asteroid s inclination and libration amplitude are small , the distances between jupiter , the asteroid , and the sun are all approximately equal to @xmath21 .",
    "then , the restoring force per unit mass acting on the asteroid is @xmath67 where @xmath66 is the distance of the trojan asteroid above the plane of jupiter s orbit . notice that the vertical oscillation frequency is the same as jupiter s orbital frequency ( eq .  [ nj ] ) .",
    "the hamiltonian for the vertical motion is @xmath68 which has canonical variables @xmath69 and @xmath70 . as in section 2.1 , for an adiabatic change to the system",
    ", the action is conserved . noting that here adiabatic means that changes to the system are negligible over one orbital period",
    ", we find @xmath71 where we have used the relation @xmath72 and integrated over a full orbital period . from this result",
    ", we see that if an external force adiabatically changes the semimajor axis of jupiter s orbit about the sun , the inclination of the trojan will change according to the relation @xmath73    if instead the mass of jupiter or the sun is varied , eq .",
    "[ inclconst ] tells us that some combination of @xmath64 and @xmath21 must change to keep the action constant .",
    "we determine how the variation is shared between @xmath64 and @xmath21 by using the invariant action for the two - body sun - jupiter system , @xmath45 ( eq .  [ 2bconstant ] ) .",
    "dividing eq .",
    "[ inclconst ] by eq .",
    "[ 2bconstant ] , we find @xmath74 for an adiabatic change in either @xmath17 or @xmath16 .    the adiabatic calculation for an eccentric asteroid orbit parallels that for an inclined orbit , however the radial oscillation frequency is given by    @xmath75^{1/2 } \\label{rfreq}\\ ] ]    ( murray and dermott 1999 , page 94 ) rather than by eq .  [ nj ] .",
    "accordingly , the action , evaluated for small eccentricities has the form    @xmath76    and @xmath63 will respond to an adiabatic change in @xmath21 according to the relation    @xmath77",
    "this result is in agreement with analytic work by gomes ( 1997 ) who showed that @xmath63 would increase when @xmath21 was decreased . for variations in @xmath16 and/or @xmath17 ,",
    "we combine eqs .",
    "[ 2bconstant ] and [ jecc ] , and find    @xmath78    thus an increase in jupiter s mass should lead to a slight increase in a trojan asteroid s eccentricity .    in summary",
    "we find , using the invariance of the action for adiabatic changes to the sun - jupiter and sun - jupiter - trojan systems , that if the semimajor axis of jupiter is decreased , the asteroid s libration amplitude ( eq .  [ analyticresult ] ) , eccentricity ( eq .",
    "[ eccaresult ] ) , and inclination ( eq .  [ inclaresult ] ) will all increase .",
    "we find further that if we increase jupiter s mass , @xmath21 will decrease ( eq .  [ amj ] ) and the trojan s libration amplitude will decrease ( eq .",
    "[ libampmj ] ) , its eccentricity will increase slightly ( eq .  [ eccmresult ] ) , and its inclination will remain unchanged ( eq .  [ inclmresult ] ) .",
    "finally , if the sun s mass is increased , @xmath21 will be decreased ( eq .  [ ams ] ) and the asteroid will be dragged inward with jupiter , @xmath26 will increase by the same amount it would were @xmath21 altered by an external force ( eq .  [ libampms ] ) , @xmath63 will decrease slightly ( eq .  [ eccmresult ] ) and @xmath64 will not change ( eq .",
    "[ inclmresult ] ) .",
    "these results are also summarized in table  ii .",
    "in this section and the next , we confirm the analytic results above and explore their range of validity by numerically integrating the three - body system consisting of the sun , jupiter , and a massless asteroid .",
    "the full equations of motion , consisting of the gravitational force of each body acting on the other two , are integrated in inertial coordinates .",
    "we use bulrisch - stoer and runge - kutta methods with adaptive stepsize ( @xcite ) , having initially decided against faster symplectic methods ( @xcite ) because of the difficulty in handling close approaches with jupiter . although fast symplectic methods for handling close approaches do exist ( @xcite ) , the speed of our routines was adequate .",
    "we ran extensive tests on our code , including checking that the bulrisch - stoer and runge - kutta integrators converged to the same solutions , producing plots which matched specific trojan asteroid orbits illustrated in murray and dermott ( 1999 , pages 97 and 98 ) , and verifying that the jacobi constant was conserved to sufficient accuracy for the circular restricted three - body problem with constant jupiter mass and semimajor axis .",
    "we begin our numerical exploration by integrating the three - body system as jupiter grows from @xmath79 to its current mass . we experimented with growing jupiter both exponentially ( @xmath80 ) and linearly ( @xmath81 ) , where @xmath82 is the initial mass of jupiter and @xmath83 and @xmath84 are constants .",
    "we find , as expected from section 2 , that our results were not significantly affected by the form of mass growth so long as the growth was slow enough to be adiabatic ; accordingly all results presented below are for an exponentially - growing jupiter .",
    "additionally , orbits librating around the lagrangian equilibrium point l4 behaved similarly to orbits around l5 , as suggested by our analytic analysis .",
    "thus , the results presented below apply to objects librating about either of these points .        placing the sun , jupiter , and the asteroid all on initially circular coplanar orbits",
    ", we carry out a set of integrations in which jupiter grows on timescales ranging from @xmath85 to @xmath9 years .",
    "we monitor the changes to the asteroid s libration amplitude and plot our results in fig .  2 .",
    "for long mass growth timescales ( @xmath86 years ) , the numerical asteroid orbits agree well with the analytic prediction .",
    "initially , the numerically - determined points track the analytic prediction precisely , but as jupiter s mass grows the points begin to scatter more .",
    "the increase in amplitude of the oscillation of the numerical points about the analytically - predicted line is due to our method of calculating the libration amplitude .",
    "we use an analytic approximation ( yoder 1983 , shoemaker _",
    "1989 ) which makes the following assumptions : 1 ) a planar three - body system with all the objects on circular orbits , 2 ) @xmath87 , and 3 ) @xmath26 is very small .",
    "the jupiter - trojan system is reasonably approximated by these assumptions ; however , as @xmath88 grows , the error in the approximation increases , thereby causing an increased scatter of the calculated points .",
    "furthermore , the changing mass of jupiter itself leads to additional effects which are not accounted for in the simple theory ; these effects are larger for more rapid growth timescales",
    ". runs with slower growth timescales of @xmath89 years ( not shown ) exhibit the same behavior as the @xmath8 year runs shown here , since both of these slow growth rates represent changes to the system that are well within the adiabatic limit where eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] is valid .    for the faster jupiter growth rates ( @xmath85 and @xmath90 years ) ,",
    "the numerical curves deviate substantially from the analytic prediction of eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] ( fig .  2 ) . in these cases ,",
    "significant changes in the mass of jupiter occur on timescales comparable to the libration period of the trojan asteroid , @xmath91 ( with @xmath39 given by eq .",
    "[ omega ] ) , which is @xmath92 years for @xmath93 and @xmath94 years for jupiter s current mass .",
    "thus , the change in the trojan orbit depends on its initial conditions , _",
    "i.e. _ , exactly where along the tadpole orbit the asteroid starts .",
    "the initial conditions for the @xmath90-year timescale run shown in fig .  2",
    "are chosen so that the curve exhibits maximum deviation from the analytic result .",
    "note that the oscillations in this curve are not due to inaccuracies in the analytic approximation used to calculate the libration amplitude ; they are real effects due the asteroid s librational motion and occur at the libration frequency .",
    "the dependence of short timescale runs on initial conditions is clearly illustrated by the curves for two extreme choices of asteroid starting point for the @xmath85-year timescale plotted in fig .  2 .",
    "the curve which is everywhere above the analytic line corresponds to an asteroid which was started at the point along the tadpole orbit farthest away from jupiter ( maximum @xmath19 , see fig .  1 ) .",
    "the basic characteristics of this curve can be understood using a simple harmonic oscillator analogy : we treat the librational motion of the asteroid as a one - dimensional oscillation in the @xmath19 direction , and the rapid growth of jupiter in @xmath85 years is approximated as instantaneous growth . using this analogy , growing jupiter when the asteroid starts at the farthest point from jupiter is equivalent to increasing the restoring force of the harmonic oscillator instantly when the oscillator is at its maximum extension .",
    "this affects the period of the oscillations , but leaves the amplitude unchanged .",
    "for this reason , the upper @xmath85-year curve in fig .  2 is initially horizontal , indicating no change in the libration amplitude . since increasing jupiter s mass over @xmath85 years is not truly an instantaneous change , the libration amplitude of the trojan asteroid eventually decreases as it begins to move toward jupiter .    the @xmath85-year timescale curve in fig .  2 which is everywhere below the analytic line corresponds to an asteroid started at the point on the tadpole orbit farthest from the sun ( see fig .",
    "1 ) where @xmath95 is maximum . again using the harmonic oscillator analogy , this is equivalent to increasing the restoring force when the oscillator has its maximum velocity .",
    "this causes the amplitude of the oscillations to decrease .",
    "thus , we see an initially rapid decrease in the trojan s libration amplitude which slows as the asteroid moves closer to jupiter .    in the adiabatic limit , the effect of the mass change",
    "is averaged over all points along the asteroid s orbit .",
    "thus , the decrease in the asteroid s libration amplitude for adiabatic growth lies between the two extremes just discussed , as can be seen in fig .  2 .",
    "next , we explore the role of the asteroid s initial libration size in determining how its libration amplitude will change as jupiter s mass grows . recall that the analytic prediction ( eq .  [ analyticresult ] ) was derived with the assumption of small libration amplitude .",
    "we study a set of tadpoles with different initial libration amplitudes ; in each integration the timescale for jupiter s mass growth is @xmath9 years , well within the adiabatic limit .",
    "we find that for initial libration amplitudes @xmath96 , our numerical results agree well with the analytic prediction , as expected ( fig .  3 ) .",
    "the curve for the @xmath97 tadpole shows a slight deviation from the analytic result ; tadpoles with larger initial amplitudes show even greater departures . as in fig .  2",
    ", the spread of the numerical points is due to the analytic method used to determine the libration amplitude .",
    "the larger tadpole orbits shrink more rapidly than eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] predicts .",
    "furthermore , the larger the libration amplitude is , the faster it shrinks , as can be seen by examining the initial slopes of the curves for the @xmath98 , @xmath99 , and @xmath100 tadpoles in fig .",
    "this can be understood by considering the effective potential in the corotating frame ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "the effective potential changes much more steeply at the head of the tadpole near jupiter than at the tail which lies further away ( erdi 1997 ) .",
    "the larger the tadpole orbit is , the further it extends away from jupiter , and the less steep is the potential in which the tail end of the orbit lies . when the potential is flatter , the location of the turning point of the orbit changes by a greater amount for the same change in energy , and so the orbits whose tails lie in the shallowest potential , _",
    "i.e. _ those with the largest libration amplitude , shrink the fastest ( see fig .",
    "once the initially large tadpole orbits become small enough , they shrink at the rate predicted by eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] .",
    "this is illustrated in fig .",
    "3 where , by the end of the integrations , all the curves are tending to the same slope as the analytic result .",
    "we also examine the effects of jupiter s mass growth on very large `` horseshoe orbits '' whose librations encompass both the l4 and l5 equilibrium points .",
    "figure  4 shows the results of an integration in which the asteroid has an initial libration amplitude of @xmath101 .",
    "the horseshoe orbit shrinks slowly until @xmath102 years when it transitions to an l4 tadpole .",
    "the tadpole then continues to shrink .",
    "although horseshoe orbits are well outside the range of libration amplitudes described by our adiabatic calculation , they too shrink under the influence of a growing jupiter .",
    "the rate of decrease in libration amplitude is , however , different for horseshoe orbits and tadpole orbits .",
    "looking at the lower edge of the plot in fig .",
    "4 , we see that the turning point of the horseshoe orbit pulls away from jupiter at a nearly constant rate for exponential growth of jupiter s mass . furthermore , the corresponding turning point in the tadpole orbit ( the tip which lies nearest jupiter ) pulls away approximately linearly as well , but with a shallower slope . for a doubling of jupiter s mass ,",
    "one tip of the horseshoe orbit recedes from jupiter by @xmath103 , while for the same mass change , the near - jupiter tip of the tadpole moves by only @xmath104 . in this way , horseshoe orbits shrink even faster than tadpole orbits .",
    "further integrations demonstrate that the growth of jupiter to its current mass captures most asteroids which were initially on horseshoe orbits into tadpole orbits .",
    "figure  5 shows the results of a set of integrations which determine the fate of asteroids placed into different - sized horseshoe orbits at various points during the growth of jupiter .",
    "we find that if the asteroids are placed on horseshoes when jupiter is a @xmath0 core , orbits with initial libration amplitudes as large as @xmath105 are captured into tadpole orbits by the time jupiter has reached its present mass .",
    "when the asteroids are started on horseshoes after jupiter has already grown part - way to its current mass , fewer of the orbits shrink sufficiently to transition to tadpoles ; however , even if the asteroids are started when jupiter has reached three - quarters of its final mass , some of the smaller horseshoe orbits still become tadpoles , at least temporarily , during the course of the integration .    in fig .  5",
    ", we can clearly see the chaotic nature of the evolution of the horseshoe orbits : there is mixing between the orbits which escape the system and those which remain in horseshoes for the entire time .",
    "we also observe mixing at the boundary for capture into tadpoles .",
    "small differences in the initial asteroid orbits can significantly alter the effects of jovian perturbations , vastly changing the final asteroid orbit .",
    "additionally , note that the smallest possible horseshoe orbits occur at @xmath106 , nearly independent of the mass of jupiter .",
    "this result is in agreement with the analytic work of horedt ( 1984 ) .",
    "the transition to a tadpole orbit occurs whenever a horseshoe orbit shrinks to this minimum size .",
    "data from the integrations plotted in fig .",
    "5 confirms that the observation made from fig .  4 , that each tip of a horseshoe orbit recedes from jupiter at a roughly uniform rate of @xmath103 per jupiter doubling , holds for general horseshoe orbits .",
    "figure  6 shows the decrease in the libration amplitudes of the horseshoe orbits plotted against the number of doublings of jupiter s mass .",
    "the solid line , fit by eye to the data , has a slope of @xmath107 per doubling ( indicating that each of the two turning points recedes at @xmath108 per doubling ) .",
    "the slight flattening of the data points near ( 0,0 ) on the plot indicates that the horseshoe orbits shrink a bit more slowly when they are near the transition to tadpole orbits .",
    "we verified this observation with additional simulations not shown here . in order to get the best value for the slope in fig .",
    "6 , we ignored the points in the flattened tail of the plot and did not insist that our fitted line go through ( 0,0 ) .",
    "next , we look at the final sizes of the tadpoles produced by the transitions from horseshoes shown in fig .  5 to see if these objects could , in fact , contribute to the current population of jupiter trojans . in fig .  7",
    ", we see that a small number of the asteroids placed in horseshoe orbits when jupiter is @xmath109 of its final mass become tadpole orbits which are stable for a significant fraction of the age of the solar system .",
    "a substantially larger number of the horseshoe orbits started when jupiter is @xmath110 of its final mass become tadpoles that remain stable for at least a hundred million years .",
    "thus , assuming that objects resided on horseshoe orbits when jupiter was accreting mass , a small fraction of these objects may still survive in the trojan swarm today .",
    "furthermore , since these asteroids undergo relatively frequent collisions ( @xcite ) , they almost certainly produced some fragments which were ejected into more stable tadpole orbits .      to further explore the range of validity of our analytic results from section 2 above , we add eccentricity and inclination to the trojan orbit , at first leaving jupiter on a circular orbit .",
    "we integrate the three - body system for a number of different small values of eccentricity and inclination ( @xmath111 , @xmath112 ) with the trojan on a small ( @xmath113 ) tadpole orbit and jupiter growing over @xmath9 years .",
    "we find that for these low values of eccentricity and inclination , our analytic expression for the change in libration amplitude ( eq .  [ analyticresult ] ) still approximates the behavior of the system well .",
    "figure  8 shows the results of one of our numerical integrations .",
    "the asteroid is given an initial eccentricity of @xmath114 and an initial inclination of @xmath115 .",
    "the analytic method of yoder _ et al . _  ( 1983 ) for determining the libration amplitude , @xmath26 , fails for non - zero @xmath63 and @xmath64 , so we resort to a simpler but more time consuming method .",
    "the values of libration amplitude are determined from the numerical data by taking the average of the local maximum and minimum values of @xmath19 at the turning points ( @xmath116 ) of the tadpole orbit .",
    "the range in values of @xmath19 at the turning points is due to both the eccentricity and inclination of the orbit .",
    "the averaging process takes advantage of the difference in orbital and librational timescales , and is essentially the guiding centre approximation for the orbit ( murray and dermott 1999 ) .",
    "the remaining uncertainty in the numerical points is due primarily to the difficulty in determining the maximum and minimum @xmath19 values from a sample of discrete points .",
    "further , as the libration period becomes smaller , we sample only parts of the elliptical orbit during the turning point . despite these difficulties ,",
    "we find that the numerical points in fig .",
    "8 follow the analytic curve well .",
    "we also explore the effects of jupiter s mass growth on the eccentricity and inclination of trojan orbits .",
    "figure  9 shows the eccentricity and inclination of the trojan orbit whose libration amplitude is plotted in fig .",
    "we see that , to first order , the eccentricity and inclination are constant during jupiter s growth , as predicted in section 2.2 .",
    "a closer inspection reveals a slight increase in the mean eccentricity which is in good agreement with the analytical predictions of eq .",
    "[ eccmresult ] .      finally , we add eccentricity to jupiter s orbit while keeping the trojan on an inclined and eccentric orbit .",
    "figure  10a shows the eccentricity and inclination of a trojan when jupiter has a constant mass and an eccentricity , @xmath117 .",
    "the asteroid s eccentricity oscillates around a constant `` forced '' component which is equal to the eccentricity of jupiter .",
    "the `` free '' component of the eccentricity is approximately the amplitude of the oscillations ( @xmath118 in fig .",
    "the trojan s forced inclination is zero , since the inclination is measured relative to jupiter s orbit .",
    "the high - frequency oscillations visible in the plot of @xmath64 are due primarily to the trojan s librations , while the lower - frequency oscillations in @xmath64 are correlated to the oscillations of the trojan s eccentricity .    starting with the same initial orbits for both jupiter and the trojan , but allowing jupiter to accrete material over @xmath119 years",
    ", we obtain the results shown in fig .",
    "the values of the forced and free eccentricities and inclinations are not significantly altered by jupiter s growth ; however , the frequencies of the oscillations in both @xmath63 and @xmath64 increase as the mass of jupiter grows , and the strength of its gravitational perturbation increases . the slight drift in the mean trojan inclination seen in fig .",
    "10b is simply part of a periodic oscillation in @xmath64 correlated to the drift of the orbital node .",
    "so , as predicted in section 2.2 , we find that the eccentricity and inclination of a trojan orbit remain essentially unchanged as jupiter s mass grows , even when jupiter is on an eccentric orbit .",
    "thus , the primordial eccentricities and inclinations of some large trojan objects may have been preserved during jupiter s accretion of mass .",
    "we now turn to a series of integrations of the three - body sun - jupiter - asteroid system in which jupiter undergoes 1 au of inward radial migration . for our integrations , we set jupiter s initial semimajor axis to @xmath120 au and leave its mass constant at @xmath50 . because the effects of jupiter s radial migration are independent of jupiter s mass and depend only on the ratio of the initial and final semimajor axes ( see eqs .",
    "[ analyticresult ] , [ inclaresult ] , and [ eccaresult ] ) our numerical results are applicable to migration of jupiter at any point during its history .    the amount of radial migration that jupiter underwent as a rocky core and growing gas giant due to tidal interactions with the gas and planetesimal disks is poorly constrained , but might be several au ( @xcite ) . furthermore , after attaining its present mass , jupiter continued to experience radial migration due to scattering of planetesimals by the giant planets ( dynamical friction ) ; recent models for the formation of the oort cloud ( @xcite , @xcite ) predict several tenths of an au of radial migration at this stage .",
    "our results may be scaled to either or both of these scenarios .",
    "we artificially cause jupiter s orbit to shrink by applying a drag force of the form @xmath121 ( where @xmath122 is jupiter s heliocentric velocity and @xmath123 is the drag constant ) which acts only on jupiter .",
    "this form of drag affects jupiter s semimajor axis , but not its eccentricity , providing a `` simplest case '' for studying the effects of jupiter s radial migration on trojan objects . recall that our analytic work shows that , in the adiabatic limit , changes in the trojans libration amplitudes are independent of the exact form of the drag force ( see eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] ) ; thus our choice for the form of the drag force is reasonable . as in the integrations for jupiter s mass growth",
    ", we find no apparent dependence on the choice of lagrangian equilibrium point , so the results below are equally applicable to orbits about the l4 and l5 points .",
    "we initially place the sun , jupiter , and the asteroid all on circular coplanar orbits .",
    "we carry out a set of integrations with the trojan on a small tadpole orbit using different drag coefficients , @xmath123 , to cause jupiter to migrate inward by @xmath124 au on timescales ranging from @xmath125 to @xmath89 years . for slow evolution",
    ", we observe that the trojans are always dragged inward with jupiter . as in the case of jupiter s mass growth ( section 3.1.1 ) , we find that for timescales significantly larger than the trojan libration period ( @xmath126 years for @xmath127 and @xmath128  au ) , the libration amplitude of the trojan increases in the manner predicted by eq .  [ analyticresult ] .",
    "also , as in the mass accretion case , when the migration timescale approaches the libration period , the change in libration amplitude deviates from our analytic prediction , with the direction and amount of deviation depending on the asteroid s initial librational phase .    for very fast migration rates ,",
    "we find that the asteroid is not pulled inward with jupiter , but instead is ejected from its tadpole orbit . for migration of jupiter by @xmath124  au in @xmath90  years",
    ", one sample integration shows an initially small tadpole orbit transforming into a horseshoe orbit near the end of the integration . in another example , we change jupiter s semimajor axis in 500 years and find that the asteroid escapes entirely from the 1:1 resonance after only @xmath129 years .",
    "next , we do a set of integrations starting the trojan asteroid on different - sized tadpole orbits . in each run",
    ", we cause jupiter to move from @xmath120 to @xmath130  au over @xmath9 years so that its migration is adiabatic . the results of several of these integrations are shown in fig .  11 .",
    "it is difficult to produce a plot similar to fig .  3 because yoder s ( 1979 ) formula for calculating the libration period assumes that there are no drag forces .",
    "thus , we estimate the initial and final libration amplitudes by measuring the difference between the minimum and maximum values of @xmath19 for the first and last complete librations in the integration .",
    "we note that the trojans librate about shifted equilibrium points due to the effects of the drag force ( _ cf .",
    "_  murray 1994 ) . in fig .",
    "11 we see that for small tadpoles ( @xmath131 ) the numerical results agree well with the prediction of eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] .",
    "the steplike appearance of the first five points reflects difficulties inherent in our measurement technique . as the initial libration amplitude becomes larger , however , the numerical points deviate increasingly from the analytic result .",
    "this is expected since the larger tadpoles break the assumption of small libration amplitude which was made during the derivation of eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] . as in the case of jupiter s",
    "mass growth , we see that for larger initial tadpoles , the change in libration amplitude is greater in magnitude but in the same direction as is predicted analytically . also , we see that the deviation of @xmath132 from the analytic prediction increases more steeply as the initial orbits become even larger .",
    "as was discussed in section 3.1.2 , this is caused by the shallow slope of the effective potential near the tail end ( the end farthest from jupiter ) of large tadpole orbits .",
    "next , we add eccentricity and inclination to the asteroid orbit , leaving jupiter on a circular orbit . as in the case of jupiter s",
    "mass growth , we find that small trojan eccentricities and inclinations ( @xmath133 , @xmath134 ) do not cause the behavior of the libration amplitude to deviate significantly from the analytic prediction of eq .",
    "[ analyticresult ] .",
    "however , unlike the mass growth case , jupiter s migration does affect the eccentricity and inclination of the trojan .",
    "figure  12 shows the semimajor axis , eccentricity , and inclination of a trojan asteroid on a small tadpole orbit as jupiter migrates from @xmath120 to @xmath130 au in @xmath9 years . during that time , the asteroid s inclination increases from @xmath135 to @xmath136 and its eccentricity grows from 0.00999 to 0.01043 , giving us @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "these agree well with the analytic prediction that @xmath139 which we calculate using eqs .",
    "[ inclaresult ] and [ eccaresult ] .",
    "these changes in the asteroid s eccentricity and inclination resulting from @xmath124 au migration of jupiter are quite small , but are systematic .",
    "finally , we explore the general case of non - zero jovian eccentricity and a trojan on an eccentric and inclined orbit . figure  13 shows the semimajor axis , eccentricity , and inclination of a sample trojan asteroid as jupiter , with @xmath140 , migrates from @xmath120 to @xmath141  au in @xmath142 years .",
    "note that we allow jupiter to move by a much greater amount than in our earlier simulations so that the effects of migration can be more easily observed and quantified . as in section 3.3 , the asteroid has a forced eccentricity equal to jupiter s eccentricity and a forced inclination of zero .",
    "the asteroid in fig .",
    "13 also has a free component of its eccentricity which is initially @xmath143 , and a free inclination which is initially @xmath144 .",
    "as jupiter migrates inward , the free components of both the asteroid s eccentricity and inclination increase systematically . from fig .",
    "13 , we find @xmath145 and @xmath146 . both of these results agree well with the analytic prediction that @xmath147 ( eqs . [ inclaresult ] and [ eccaresult ] ) for an adiabatic change in jupiter s semimajor axis from 6.2 to 2.6 au .",
    "thus , our analytic results ( eqs .",
    "[ inclaresult ] and [ eccaresult ] ) hold even when jupiter has a low eccentricity if @xmath63 and @xmath64 are interpreted as the free components of the asteroid s eccentricity and inclination .",
    "we have shown with both a simple adiabatic calculation and numerical simulations , that slow changes to the mass and semimajor axis of jupiter cause the trojan libration amplitude to vary according to the relation : @xmath148 for trojans with small libration amplitudes , small eccentricities , and small inclinations , and jupiter with a small eccentricity .",
    "for inclined and eccentric trojan objects , we find that jupiter s mass growth does not significantly affect either the trojan s eccentricity or inclination ; however , jupiter s radial migration causes a change in the free component of both of these quantities by a factor of @xmath149 .    applying our results to the core accretion model for the early evolution of jupiter , we find that the planet s growth by gas accretion from a @xmath150 core to its present mass would cause a decrease in the libration amplitude of any trojan companions on small tadpole orbits to @xmath1 of their original size .",
    "our representative choice for jupiter s radial migration from @xmath120 to @xmath130  au would result in an increase in the trojans libration amplitudes , eccentricities , and inclinations of only @xmath3 .",
    "even for radial migrations of several tens of au , the effects of jupiter s mass growth dominate over the effects of its migration .",
    "thus the combined result of mass accretion and radial migration is to stabilize trojan objects by systematically driving them to lower libration amplitudes .",
    "also , our numerical integrations show that the libration amplitudes of trojans on larger orbits shrink at an even faster rate .",
    "further , the shrinking of horseshoe orbits due to jupiter s growth could place additional objects or perhaps fragments of objects onto stable tadpole orbits .",
    "thus , jupiter s growth by mass accretion most likely played a significant role in the capture and evolution of the trojan asteroid population .",
    "our results for the evolution of trojan libration amplitudes , eccentricities , and inclinations are quite general and can be applied to other objects within the solar system .",
    "for example , eqs .",
    "[ analyticresult ] , [ inclaresult ] , and [ eccaresult ] predict that @xmath26 , @xmath151 , and @xmath41 will all decrease substantially if the secondary body undergoes significant outward radial migration .",
    "uranus and neptune probably underwent more substantial radial migration due to dynamical friction with planetesimals than jupiter , moving outward by as much as several au ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this would have caused a decrease in @xmath26 , @xmath63 , and @xmath64 of possible trojan - like companions by about @xmath152 .",
    "radial migration effects might be even more significant for some planetary satellites , notably our moon .",
    "the moon is believed to have formed via a giant collision which produced a temporary ring of debris around the earth ( @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "such a process would have most likely captured some debris in librating orbits about the moon s lagrangian equilibrium points . over the subsequent @xmath153 years",
    ", the moon migrated outward to about 30 times its initial orbital radius .",
    "ignoring other effects , this migration should have decreased the libration amplitudes , eccentricities , and inclinations of the debris particles to @xmath1 of their original values , stabilizing these objects in 1:1 resonance with the moon .",
    "since we observe no such objects today , either the 1:1 resonance was never populated , or other effects ( such as solar gravity ) caused them to be unstable .",
    "another potential area for study is the satellite system of saturn .",
    "the many resonances in this system are believed to have formed during the significant outward migration of these satellites due to both tidal interactions with saturn and ring torques .",
    "one unexplained characteristic of the current saturnian system is that of the six largest satellites near saturn , the middle two , tethys and dione , have a total of three trojan companions but the others , mimas , enceladus , rhea , and titan , have none .",
    "this is curious because there is no obvious reason why the middle satellites should be the best at capturing trojan companions .",
    "also , the results of this paper suggest that the objects which migrate outward by the greatest amount should be the best at capturing and stabilizing their trojan companions .",
    "this suggests that the inner two satellites , which have migrated farthest , should be most likely to have trojan companions .",
    "it is likely that the probability of trojan capture and the stabilization of trojan orbits is complicated by the presence of resonances between the satellites .",
    "the inner four saturnian satellites are all currently locked in resonances with each other , and they may have passed through various other resonances in the past .",
    "an exploration of the interactions between the migration process explored in this paper , and the effects of other resonances , discussed by morais and murray ( 1999 ) , may provide insight into this unexplained characteristic of the saturnian system .",
    "it may also provide insight into how the unusual pair of coorbital satellites , janus and epimetheus , which librate on horseshoe orbits , was formed in the saturnian system .",
    "our work is also directly relevant to the capture of planetary satellites during the growth of the giant planets , as was suggested by heppenheimer and porco ( 1977 ) .",
    "equation  [ 2bconstant ] clearly shows that distant satellites would be drawn inward as a planet grows .",
    "their migration would cease when the planet reached its final mass .",
    "thus , this mechanism provides a natural way for a giant planet to pull in distant satellites without causing them to collide with the planet .                                                    press , w. h. , b. p. flannery , s. a. teukolsky , and w. t. vettering 1987 . _ numerical recipes in c : the art of scientific computing _ , cambridge university press , cambridge .",

    "<S> we present analytic and numerical results which illustrate the effects of jupiter s accretion of nebular gas and the planet s radial migration on its trojan companions . </S>",
    "<S> initially , we approximate the system by the planar circular restricted three - body problem and assume small trojan libration amplitudes . employing an adiabatic invariant calculation , we show that jupiter s thirty - fold growth from a @xmath0 core to its present mass causes the libration amplitudes of trojan asteroids to shrink by a factor of about 2.5 to @xmath1 of their original size . </S>",
    "<S> the calculation also shows that jupiter s radial migration has comparatively little effect on the trojans ; inward migration from 6.2 to 5.2 au causes an increase in trojan libration amplitudes of @xmath2 . in each case , the area enclosed by small tadpole orbits , if made dimensionless by using jupiter s semimajor axis , is approximately conserved . </S>",
    "<S> similar adiabatic invariant calculations for inclined and eccentric trojans show that jupiter s mass growth leaves the asteroid s eccentricities and inclinations essentially unchanged , while one au of inward migration causes an increase in both of these quantities by @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> numerical integrations confirm and extend these analytic results . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that our predictions remain valid for trojans with small libration amplitudes even when the asteroids have low , but nonzero , eccentricities and inclinations and/or jupiter has an eccentricity similar to its present value . </S>",
    "<S> the integrations also show that trojans with large libration amplitudes , including horseshoe orbits , are even more strongly affected by jupiter s mass growth and radial migration than simple scaling from our analytic results would suggest . </S>",
    "<S> further , the numerical runs demonstrate that jupiter s predicted mass growth is sufficient to cause the capture of asteroids initially on horseshoe orbits into stable tadpole orbits . </S>",
    "<S> thus , if jupiter captured most of its trojan companions before or while it accreted gas , as seems probable , then jupiter s growth played a significant role in stabilizing trojan objects by systematically driving them to lower libration amplitudes .    </S>",
