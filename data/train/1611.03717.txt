    "the wavelength distributions , or the so - called inhomogeneous broadenings , are by far the narrowest for semiconductor qds and are about 5 times narrower than that of a typical self - assembled inas / gaas qd sample .",

    "so far there are only very few reports about the observation of a biexciton @xcite in gaas / algaas qds ( although , grown with different methods ) due to the low internal population probability under non - resonant excitation . due to the optimized growth process",
    "we are able to observe strong xx emissions even with above - band excitations .",
    "we select a qd from the sample emitting close to the rb d2 transition ( @xmath49780.2 nm ) and excite it by pumping the surrounding higher - bandgap algaas with a pulsed laser . the resulting spectrum ( a : top ) , which is relatively clean in a broad range ,",
    "shows several different excitonic transitions : the transition with the highest intensity is the exciton emission ( x ) at @xmath50 = 778.5 nm . among several red - shifted transitions the xx emission is the strongest ( @xmath50 = 780.1 nm ) .    in order to efficiently excite and to coherently drive the xx transition , we pump the two - photon resonance of the xx state by using a strong laser which lies spectrally in between the x and xx transitions .",
    "this excitation scheme has already been proven very effective in case of inas / gaas qds @xcite and has recently been reported by huber et al  @xcite in case of selected gaas / algaas qds also grown by local droplet etching . making use of tunable notch filters",
    "we can effectively suppress the laser background .",
    "hence a very pure spectrum showing mostly the xx and x emissions can be observed ( a : bottom ) .",
    "the integrated intensities are the same for both emissions , strongly indicating a close to unity efficiency for the cascaded emission process  @xcite .    to obtain the evidence of pure single photon emissions from both xx and x , we perform an autocorrelation measurement using a standard hanbury brown and twiss setup and the results",
    "are shown in b. the autocorrelation function @xmath51 plotted over the photon arrival delay @xmath52 shows a clear absence of counts at zero delay and proves the ultra - high purity single photon emission .",

    "the x decay shows a longer rise time since the state has to be populated first by the decay of the xx state .",
    "the extracted lifetimes are @xmath46 = 112 ps and @xmath47 = 134 ps , which are among the lowest values recorded for as - grown semiconductor qds .",
    "the ideal lifetime - limited linewidth of the exciton emission is therefore @xmath53 , which is close to the mean value of the fss in our sample .    in order to further evaluate the resonant two - photon excitation scheme we recorded the intensity of xx and x photons while changing the excitation power .",
    "the result is summarized in d by plotting the intensity over the pulse area @xmath48 which is proportional to the square root of the excitation power .",
    "clear rabi oscillations are observed , which are oscillations of the intensity due to a coherent rotation on the bloch sphere between the ground state @xmath54 and the excited state @xmath55 .",

    "intensity oscillations up to @xmath56 are observed .",
    "the mean intensity is decreasing for higher excitation powers , which may be caused by several different factors , like chirp in the excitation pulse or scattering processes in the qd  @xcite . increasing the power also leads to an increase in the oscillation frequency , which is a fingerprint of the two - photon excitation process in clear contrast to one - photon resonant excitation , where the frequency remains constant .      after realizing an efficient coherent control over the xx decay in gaas qds we now evaluate the degree of entanglement in the polarization of the emitted photons .",
    "a qd with a fss of @xmath57 is chosen in the experiment , since it presents a large portion ( @xmath58 ) of qds in the sample ( see c ) .",

    "the correlation contrast for a chosen basis set is given by@xcite @xmath65 with @xmath66 denoting the second - order correlation function at zero delay in collinear , and @xmath67 in orthogonal bases .",
    "for the three illustrated basis sets the following contrasts are obtained : @xmath68 the fidelity f of the measured quantum state to the ideal state @xmath61 can then be obtained by@xcite @xmath69 which exceeds the classical limit @xmath70 by more than 12 standard deviations .    a more comprehensive picture of the measured entangled two - photon state is given by the density matrix representation .",
    "we performed cross - correlation measurements for 16 different base combinations to account for the 16 unknown variables in the density matrix @xmath71 .",
    "the measured values for @xmath72 are then used to construct a density matrix following the procedure presented in ref .  .",

    "is obtained , which is not only the best value measured for inas / gaas qds with zero fss  @xcite , but also the highest value ever obtained for any qd entangled photon source .",
    "the high values for fidelity and concurrence are especially remarkable considering the finite fine structure splitting of @xmath57 , which already significantly degrades the entanglement in case of inas / gaas qds @xcite .",

    "therefore we select six dots representing the whole range of fss measured in the sample . by measuring six cross - correlations in three basis sets for each dot ,",
    "their entanglement fidelity @xmath33 are obtained .",
    "shows the values of @xmath33 plotted as a function of fss ( black circles ) , overlaid on the fss distribution in the sample ( gray histogram ) . the data from zhang _",
    "et al_. @xcite including a lorentzian fit are shown as a reference for typical inas / gaas qds ( orange line ) .",

    "we want to highlight that the measured dots were not preselected according to certain conditions apart from their fss .",
    "all measurements lead to the conclusion that nearly 100% of the qds in this sample show entangled photon emission .",
    "another outstanding feature of the new system are the significantly higher fidelities compared to that of the typical inas / gaas qds , which is mostly due to the weak electron - nuclear spin hyperfine interactions in this type of qds  @xcite . in order to better understand the obtained values , we plot two theoretical curves showing the fidelity over the fss for radiative lifetimes of @xmath12 = 120 ps ( red curve ) and @xmath12 = 220 ps ( blue curve ) , which is the typical range for the measured lifetimes .",
    "we modelled the fidelity following the work by hudson _",
    "et al_. @xcite , which includes both the influence of the fss and lifetime @xmath52 as well as cross - dephasing and spin scattering : @xmath81 with @xmath82 here , @xmath83 denotes the probability that the measured photon pairs originate from the dot , which we estimate to be @xmath84 due to the measured autocorrelation measurements presented in b. the factor @xmath85 denotes the fraction of the qd emission which is unaffected by both cross - dephasing and spin - scattering processes , while @xmath86 only considers spin - scattering processes .",
    "since the presented data show no trend that would lead to @xmath87 for large fss , we expect spin - scattering processes to have a negligible influence on the entanglement .",
    "considering spin scattering due to the overhauser field of the nuclear spins present in the dot , a spin - scattering time of @xmath88 can be assumed @xcite .",
    "this is , however , two orders of magnitudes longer than our measured radiative lifetimes and therefore barely contributes in the degradation of the fidelity . on the other hand ,",
    "in typical inas / gaas qds this effect can be significantly stronger in case of high concentrations of spin-9/2 indium @xcite , leading to much lower fidelity values for inas / gaas qds in  @xcite .",
    "since the fidelity at small fss are very high for the gaas / algaas qds , we neglected cross - dephasing processes in the model .",
    "it is clear that the trend in all our fidelity measurements can be well - represented by the employed model .",
    "in this work we propose a new type of solid - state polarization entangled photon source based on an emerging family of gaas / algaas qds .",
    "these qds can be grown with unprecedented wavelength control , ultra - small fss and short lifetime .",
    "the efficient and coherent excitation of the biexciton state in the gaas / algaas qds is achieved by employing a resonant two - photon excitation scheme . a fidelity up to @xmath2 and a concurrence of @xmath3",
    "have been achieved , which are among the highest values ever reported for qd - based entangled photon sources .",
    "most remarkably , the whole set of measurements draws an unambiguous conclusion that we have obtained a large ensemble of entangled photon emitters on a single semiconductor wafer . with almost 100% of qds in the sample having fidelities @xmath24 , a great fraction of qds",
    "are expected to exhibit high fidelities @xmath89 without any post - growth tuning .",
    "therefore , a solid - state quantum repeater - among many other key enabling quantum photonic elements based on polarization entangled photons - can be _ practically _ implemented with this new material system .",
    "the photoluminescence experiments were conducted at @xmath90 by placing the sample in either a helium - bath or a helium - flow cryostat . as excitation laser for the above - band and two - photon excitations a pulsed ti : sa laser with @xmath91 repetition rate",
    "was used , which generated pulses with a duration of @xmath92 . in order to spectrally narrow the laser pulse it was sent to a home - built pulse - shaping setup before it was coupled into a single - mode fiber .",
    "the excitation laser was then sent to the sample in the cryostat using a beam sampler and focussed by a lens or an objective , which was also used for the collection of the qd emission .",
    "we used half - ball solid immersion lenses to increase the photon collection from the sample .",
    "for measuring entanglement the collected light from the qd was split by a @xmath59 beam splitter into two arms , each consisting of a quarter - wave plate , a half - wave plate and a polarizer .",
    "the two beams were then coupled into polarization - maintaining single - mode fibers . in order to eliminate the strong laser background we employed two consecutive tunable notch filters .",
    "each light path was fed into a monochromator in order to select the xx or x transition , respectively .",
    "the streams of photons were then detected by avalanche photodiodes , whose signals were processed by a time - correlated single photon counter .",
