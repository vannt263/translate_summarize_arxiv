    "for this reason , i will devote the rest of the section in revising the evidence of this inner - outer disc dycothomy .",
    "a first indication comes from the work of @xcite , who shows that thin disc stars at the solar vicinity do not all share the same orbital properties : most of the metal - rich thin disc stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath36  dex ) found at the solar vicinity tend to have pericentres inside the solar radius , up to few kpc from the galactic centre , and apocentres at or just outside the solar position , while metal - poor thin disc stars ( [ fe / h]@xmath37  dex ) have orbits which do not penetrate so much in the inner disc ( their pericentres are usually above 6  kpc ) and their apocentres extend much further out in the outer disc , up to 12 kpc from the galaxy centre ( see fig .",
    "[ haywood08fig ] ) .",
    "a second indication comes from the work of @xcite : this study reveals that the ( thin+thick discs ) chemical patterns found at the solar radius are not representative of the whole disc . only at the solar vicinity",
    "the two patterns  the one going from [ @xmath1/fe]@xmath250.4  dex and [ fe / h]@xmath25 - 1  dex to solar values , and the one going from [ @xmath1/fe]@xmath250.2  dex and [ fe / h]@xmath25 - 0.7  dex ( red and blue lines , respectively , in fig .  2 of their work) coexist . in their inner disc sample , made of stars with distances from the galactic centre between 4 and 7  kpc , the second pattern is not present , while it is the only pattern that appears in the outer disc ( distances between 9 and 13  kpc ) . in particular , it is striking to observe that metal - rich thin disc stars , present at the solar vicinity , are not found in the outer disc , at distances greater than @xmath38  kpc from the galaxy centre . in @xcite , we have re - investigated the question , calculating the ages of a high resolution spectroscopic sample of stars at the solar vicinity ( from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from this study",

    "having detailed chemical abundances and ages , in @xcite , we reconstructed the star formation histories of the inner and outer discs , showing that the outer disc started to form about 10  gyr ago , from an interstellar medium whose metallicity was diluted by 0.30.4  dex with respect to the metallicity of the interstellar medium present in the inner disc at the same time . in @xcite , we proposed that the outer regions of the milky way possibly formed from a mixture of enriched material expelled from the thick disc , and of accreted , metal - poor gas .",
    "afterwards , the evolution of the outer disc remained essentially disconnected from that of the inner disc .",
    "all these studies , except that of @xcite , have been based on the analysis of stars at the solar vicinity .",
    "the definite confirmation that this picture is correct , and that the chemical patterns of the inner and outer discs are different and co - exist only in the solar region comes from apogee .",
    "the distribution in the [ @xmath1-fe]-[fe / h ] plane of about 70,000 stars in the apogee survey , spanning a large range of distances from the sun , is shown in @xcite and here reproduced in fig .",
    "[ hayden15fig ] .",
    "this figure perfectly summarizes the points made in this section :    * the @xmath3enhanced thick disc is centrally concentrated  very few thick disc stars are indeed observed at distances greater than 1011  kpc from the galaxy centre ; * in a 2-kpc wide region around the sun , two chemical patterns are observed : one going from @xmath41 , metal - poor thick disc stars to solar [ @xmath1/fe ] and super  solar [ fe / h ] values , the second pattern starting at [ @xmath1/fe]@xmath42  dex and [ fe / h]@xmath43  dex with [ fe / h ] increasing up to solar values .",
    "these two patterns co - exist only in a few kpc region around the sun : in the outer disc the @xmath3enhanced pattern disappears , while in the inner disc , it is the low-@xmath1 sequence which is not present .",
    "there are at least two implications of these results which are of interest for our study :    * radial migration by churning @xcite , that is the change of guiding radii of stars caused by the presence of one or multiple asymmetries in the stellar disc , has not been efficient in mixing stars of the inner ( @xmath39  kpc ) and outer milky way disc ( @xmath44  kpc ) .",
    "the difference of chemical patterns of these two regions of the galaxy , with an overlap only in a few - kpc zone around the sun , implies that no siginificant migration of stars has occurred between these two regions .",
    "whatever the formation scenario for the outer disc of the milky way is ( gas / satellites accretion with a possible role of winds from the inner disc ) , and whatever the process that ignited star formation in those outer regions about 10  gyr ago , some mechanism has prevented stars from migrating afterwards . in @xcite , we propose that the mechanism that inhibited migration is dynamical and is related to the position of the bar olr , position that is currently estimated to be just inside the solar radius . by using n - body models , we show indeed that the bar olr limits the exchange of angular momentum , separating the disc in two distinct parts with minimal exchange , except in the transition zone , which is delimited by the position of the olr at the epoch of the formation of the bar , and at the final epoch .",
    "this also implies that stars migrated in the bar / bulge region from the outer disc can originate in a region whose maximal extent is given by the final ( i.e. current ) position of the olr @xcite .",
    "unless the galaxy , over time , has experienced the formation of several bars , and/or strong spiral waves , with different pattern speeds ( in that case the scenario would become much more complex ) , the picture is simple : _ only stars inside the solar region , where the olr should be currently located , can have migrated in the inner disc and contributed to the bulge populations .",
    "_ * _ the chemical patterns of the inner disc are only part of the chemical patterns observed at the solar radius .",
    "when one compares the chemistry of bulge stars to those of disc stars , it is fundamental to take this result into account . _ in particular , if the comparison is done with the chemical patterns observed at the solar vicinity , the low-@xmath1 pattern of the metal - poor thin disc must not be taken into account in the comparison , simply because this pattern is typical of the outer disc and not of the region inside 67  kpc from the galaxy centre .",
    "_ the chemical patterns of the bulge differ from those of the stellar disc at the solar vicinity as much as the latter differs from the chemical patterns of the inner disc_. the difference in chemical patterns of the bulge and of the thin disc at the solar radius arises because the solar radius is not representative of the chemistry of the inner thin disc , not because the metal - rich bulge is a different population from the inner thin disc . in this respect ,",
    "the @xmath3enhancement of the bulge with respect to the thin disc found , for example , by @xcite arises because the whole thin disc is included in the comparison , while the metal - poor thin disc present at the solar vicinity should be removed .",
    "once this is done , the filiation between the inner thin disc and the metal - rich bulge becomes evident .",
    "the observational evidences recalled in the previous sections suggest to investigate the nature of the bulge and its stellar components in view of the recent discoveries about the disc(s ) populations ( sects .",
    "[ bulge ] and [ stellpop ] ) .",
    "it is by quantifying and understanding the response of a thin+thick disc to bar formation and instabilities that we can solve the puzzle of the main ( i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath45 ) populations of the galactic bulge .    in the following of this section",
    ", i will discuss three points , that are fundamental to me to understand why our current modeling of the milky way bulge is incomplete .    1 .",
    "n - body simulations which try to interpret the milky way bulge as the result of a bar instability in a pure thin disc galaxy fail in reproducing the chemo - kinematic relations , as found in the most recent surveys .",

    "this failure has been evidenced in @xcite , and i will summarize here the main points made in that paper , after recalling the successes of the bulge / bar / thin disc scenario .",
    "2 .   if the milky way contains any classical bulge , its mass must be small ( not more than 10% ) .",
    "several independent n - body models have now reached this same conclusion , and this also means that the origin of the metal - poor populations which are significant in the bulge  60% and more , depending on latitude , for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath21  dex ; up to 40% for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath46  dex only ; according to @xcite  can not be ascribed to the presence of a classical bulge , which makes 10% at most of the thin disc mass .",
    "3 .   neither a pure thin disc model nor the inclusion of a low - mass classical bulge can explain the properties of the metal - poor component present in the bulge .",
    "it is only by adding the thick disc to the picture that we can naturally understand the vertical structuring of the bulge , the variation of metal - rich and metal - poor components with height , their relative weight , and the absence of a boxy / peanut - shaped structure for the metal - poor ( @xmath47  dex@xmath48[fe / h]@xmath19  dex ) stars at latitudes @xmath49 .",
    "i will show this , by presenting the first results of n - body simulations which include a massive thick disc , and that have high enough resolution to allow to study in detail the mapping of a thin+thick disc into a boxy bulge .",
    "because of the boxy / peanut - shaped nature of the milky way bulge and because of the marginal role that the thick disc was considered to play in the mass budget of the galaxy until recently , all n - body models so far  except those of @xcite  have modeled the visible galaxy as a pure thin disc , with the possible inclusion of a classical bulge .",
    "these models , which i will refer to also as ",
    "pure thin disc \" models  even in the case they contain a small ( @xmath50 ) classical bulge , as in @xcite  have been successful in reproducing a number of global characteristics of the milky way bulge , as its structure and x - shape , its kinematics and metallicity trends .",
    "+ @xcite and @xcite , for example , showed how a pure thin disc model can be able to reproduce star counts observations in the galactic plane , for the long bar , and in the inner regions of the boxy bulge ( @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , where a sudden change in the structure of the bulge is observed at @xmath53 @xcite . by means of a n - body model of a stellar bar grown from a thin disc , @xcite were able to explain the split in the distribution of red giant clump stars along the bar minor axis , as observed by argos .",
    "the pure thin disc model developed by @xcite has been successful in explaining the stellar kinematics of the bulge region from the brava bulge survey @xcite , at latitudes @xmath54 and @xmath55 and longitudes @xmath56 .",
    "in particular , this n - body simulation reproduces the cylindrical rotation observed all over the analyzed fields and the corresponding trends in velocity dispersions .",
    "@xcite confirmed this agreement , by comparing @xcite model to a more extended sample of stars from brava at similar latitudes and longitudes .",
    "similar results were obtained by @xcite , in their comparison with brava , and by @xcite , who used the pure thin disc n - body model presented in @xcite and compared it with the bulge kinematics from the gibs survey , extending the comparison between data and models also closer to the galaxy mid - plane , at latitude @xmath57 . that a  pure thin disc \" model is able to reproduce the global kinematics of the bulge has been also shown by @xcite , in their comparison with the argos kinematics at latitudes @xmath58 and @xmath59 and by @xcite , who compared their n - body model to argos and brava data .",
    "such models have been shown to be able to reproduce also the vertical metallicity gradient , similar to those observed @xcite .",
    "@xcite indeed showed how an initial steep ( @xmath60  dex / kpc ) radial metallicity gradient in the thin disc can be mapped into a comparable vertical metallicity gradient in the bulge : the most loosely bound stars , in the disc outskirts , are indeed preferentially redistributed at large heights from the plane , while more bound stars tend to be found at low latitudes ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "this explain why , in a pure thin disc which has initially  before bar formation  a steep enough metallicity gradient , models predict also longitude - latitude metallicity maps remarkably similar to observations ( see fig .",
    "[ dimatteo15fig ] and * ? ? ?",
    "i will comment in the following on the limitations of this scenario .",
    "+ finally , even if we are only starting to discover the spatial redistribution of stars with different ages in the galactic bulge , the most recent findings @xcite seem in agreement with models predictions about the presence of young stars close to the galaxy mid - plane , as a consequence of the continuous star formation in the galactic thin disc @xcite .",
    "+      in the scenario where the bulge formed from a pure thin disc , through the intermediate of a bar , it is fundamental that initially ",
    "i.e. before bar formation  the thin disc has a steep radial metallicity gradient ( @xmath60  dex / kpc as found by @xcite and @xcite ) . in this way",
    ", metal - poor stars originating at large radii in the thin disc are preferentially mapped at high latitudes in the galactic bulge and give rise to a vertical gradient of about @xmath61  dex / deg , similar to the findings of @xcite . in this scenario , because all bulge stars have a thin disc origin , at a given latitude they should be all part of the boxy / peanut - shaped structure , independently on their metallicities .",
    "this fact has two consequences , which enter in conflict with the detailed structure and chemo - kinematic relations currently known for the bulge components :    1 .   at a given latitude , all red clump stars in the milky way s bulge with [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath62  dex should show a split in the distribution of their k - magnitudes , which is not observed ; 2 .   the metal - poor population ( -1  dex@xmath63 [ fe / h ] @xmath19  dex ) should be a kinematically warm replica of the more metal rich ones ( -0.5  dex @xmath63 [ fe / h ] ) , which is not .",
    ".[bulgescenario ]    these failures have been presented and discussed in @xcite , where we have indeed shown how a  pure thin disc \" model can reproduce the global kinematics and chemistry of the bulge , without reproducing the detailed chemo - kinematic and structural properties of its components . the problem is essentially related to the fact that , in such a scenario , metal - poor stars at any given latitude would contribute to the external part of the peanut and that they would have an angular momentum greater than that of more metal - rich stars ( whose origin would be in the inner galaxy , given the initial radial metallicity gradient ) .",
    "a higher angular momentum for metal - poor stars would break the cylindrical rotation observed for this component , and would imply also a rotation curve different from that of the most metal - rich populations .",
    "this is not observed in the data , which on the contrary show that populations a , b and c all show cylindrical rotation and similar rotation curves .",
    "moreover , because in this scenario metal - poor stars would have a thin disc origin , their velocity dispersion profiles would have a shape similar to those of the most metal - rich components , only shifted at higher absolute values .",
    "this again is not observed . as shown in figs .",
    "[ dimatteo15fig ] , [ dimatteo15fig1 ] and [ dimatteo15fig2 ] , even if successful in explaining global properties of the bulge , the  pure thin disc \" model fails in reproducing the properties of its stellar components ( fig .",
    "[ dimatteo15fig2 ] ) . for a more extensive discussion on these points ,",
    "i refer the reader to @xcite and @xcite .",
    "if the metal - poor stars in the milky way bulge can not have a thin disc origin , can they belong to a classical bulge ?",
    "several n - body models , starting from those presented by @xcite , and then @xcite , show that this is not a viable possibility .",
    "they all agree indeed in finding that the mass of any classical bulge present in the galaxy must be small ( 10% at most ) .",
    "@xcite , for example , showed that for higher mass ratios , the classical bulge would determine signatures in the global velocity dispersion profiles of stars in the bulge not compatible with brava observations ( see fig .  4 in * ? ? ?",
    "subsequent works arrived to similar conclusions .",
    "such a small classical bulge can explain neither the large fraction of metal poor - stars observed in the bulge , nor their increasing fraction with latitude . in ( * ? ? ?",
    "11 ) , we have indeed shown that the contribution of a low - mass classical bulge to the total stellar density is maximal in the innermost regions of the bulge ( typically inside 0.5  kpc , where it can account for 20% at most of the total local stellar density ) and this fraction decreases with increasing latitude .",
    "the weight of such a classical bulge , and its trends with latitude , are significantly different from those observed for components b and/or c by @xcite , excluding that a low - mass classical bulge can represent the bulk of these populations .",
    "+ moreover , a classical component would leave signatures in the kinematics of stars in the bulge .",
    "even if stars in the classical bulge can acquire some angular momentum during the bar formation and evolution ( see , for example * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , these stars do not attain rotational velocities comparable to those of disc stars , whatever their location in the boxy structure .",
    "this is shown , for example , in fig .",
    "12 in @xcite , but also in @xcite : in this latter model , the galactocentric radial velocity of the spheroidal component  whose mass is about 50% of that of the stellar disc  is about half the value found for disc stars in all bulge fields ( see their table  5 and their fig .  16 ) .",
    "this rules out the possibility that the bulk of the metal - poor stars in the galactic bulge can be associated to a spheroid like that modeled by @xcite : if this was the case , metal - poor and metal - rich stars should show a significantly different amount of rotation , something excluded by the data @xcite .",
    "the previous discussion has shown that neither metal - poor thin disc stars trapped in the bar instability nor a classical bulge can explain the relative weight , fraction as a function of latitude , structure and kinematics of the metal - poor populations observed in the galactic bulge . at the same time",
    ", we have learned from the evidences recalled in sect .",
    "[ stellpop ] that a thick disc is massively present in the inner regions of the milky way , and that is has [ @xmath1/fe ] and [ fe / h ] compatible with those of stars in the bulge .",
    "this lead us to suggest in @xcite that the milky way bulge is the result of the mapping of the thin+thick disc of the galaxy into the boxy / peanut shaped structure . in this scenario , we can understand the chemical patterns present in the galactic bulge already in terms of the chemical patterns of stars at the solar vicinity : the inner disc sequence is mapped into the boxy bulge , while the outer disc sequence , which  as we have seen  contains stars with pericentres slightly inside the solar radius , is not .",
    "more in details , we suggest that components a , b and c ad defined by @xcite correspond , respectively , to the metal - rich thin disc , the young thick disc and the old thick disc , adopting the nomenclature of @xcite and following the scheme presented here in fig .",
    "[ bulgescenario ] , and already discussed in @xcite .",
    "note that this scenario is somehow different from the one presented in @xcite : they indeed associate component c only with the thick disc , while in their interpretation component b should represent the early thin disc .    how to test the validity of this scheme with n - body simulations ?",
    "the recent observational results pose a challenge for idealized models , which have generally represented the stellar content of a milky way - type galaxy with a thin stellar disc and an optional bulge .",
    "the vertical structuring observed in the data , with a continuous sequence of  mono - abundance \" populations , whose scale height depends on their [ @xmath1/fe ] and [ fe / h ] , needs to be captured somehow .",
    "a solution may be to use , as initial conditions , snapshots of milky way - like galaxies taken from cosmological simulations , where  mono - abundance \" sequences have been indeed reproduced @xcite .",
    "the limit of this approach is in the difficulty of investigating a large number of initial conditions , varying thin - to - thick disc ratios , for example , or disc(s ) scale lengths and heights . to guarantee to have controlled sequences of ( thin+thick ) disc models , we have decided to follow a different approach , by constructing idealized galaxies , containing stellar discs of different scale heights and lengths , with masses and sizes in agreement with the most recent estimates for the milky way . in the following",
    ", i will show how the mapping of a thin+thick disc into a boxy / peanut - shaped bulge is done in one of these simulations , and the kind of trends it predicts .",
    "the disc galaxy modeled here is made of 25 million particles , redistributed among stars and dark matter .",
    "the stellar disc , made of 20 million particles , is structured in three components ( hereafter called  thin \" ,  intermediate \" and  thick \" discs , respectively ) with scale heights varying from 0.3  kpc , to 0.6  kpc and 0.9  kpc , and with velocity dispersions at the solar vicinity similar to those observed for the thin , young thick and old thick disc , respectively @xcite .",
    "the intermediate and thick disc together constitute 50% of the stellar mass in the modeled galaxy , with the remaining 50% being in the thin disc .",
    "i would like to highlight here that we chose to model only three disc components simply to identify three phases of an otherwise probably continuous chemical evolution .",
    "the same is valid for the galactic bulge : components a , b and c have been found by fitting the bulge mdf with multiple gaussians @xcite .",
    "but the existence of several components in the bulge mdf does not indicate necessarily that these components are really distinct . and",
    "indeed , the [ @xmath1/fe ] versus [ fe / h ] plot of the argos stars presented in @xcite shows a continuity between the three components .",
    "the modeled galaxy is evolved in isolation for 5  gyr .",
    "it rapidly develops a stellar bar which buckles after a couple of gyrs and forms a boxy / peanut - shaped bulge .",
    "a couple of results of this simulation seem worth mentioning in this context :    1 .",
    "stars of all components contribute to the stellar bar and to the boxy / peanut - shaped structure , but their relative weight depends on the characteristics of the initial stellar disc ( i.e. kinematically cold or warm ) and on the height above the plane ( see fig .  [ dimatteo16fig2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , in our experiment , by integrating over the whole bulge extent , thin disc stars constitute 40% of the total stellar densities at @xmath640.25  kpc , but this fraction diminishes to about 25% at @xmath65  kpc@xmath66  kpc .",
    "thick disc stars show the opposite trend : they represent less than 20% of the total stellar density at @xmath640.25  kpc , but their fraction rises to more than 40% at @xmath65  kpc@xmath66  kpc .",
    "finally , the intermediate disc  which in our experiment should mimic the young thick disc following @xcite nomenclature  has a weight which is nearly independent on the vertical distance from the plane : 40% at @xmath640.25  kpc , 35% at @xmath65  kpc@xmath66  kpc .",
    "note that at the highest distances from the plane , intermediate plus thick disc stars  which should mimic the young plus old thick disc , that is components b plus c in our scenario  constitute the great majority ( 75% ) of the local stellar density .",
    "even with the uncertainties still present in the model ( thin - to - thick discs mass ratios , and in particular the fraction of young and old thick disc stars to the total thick disc mass ; initial velocity dispersion profiles in the inner galaxy , etc ) , it is striking to see the similarity with the findings of @xcite .",
    "in particular the trends found for our thin and thick discs are reminiscent of those of populations a and c in @xcite , while our intermediate disc shows a weight whose nearly independence on the height above the plane is reminiscent of population b. 2 .   at a given height above the plane ,",
    "the boxy / peanut shape is more pronounced in the kinematically cold populations than in the hottest one ( see fig .  [ cutreg2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , in our experiment , a clear peanut - shape in the thick disc is only visible at large heights above the plane , greater than 1  kpc .",
    "this has two interesting implications .",
    "+ @xcite found that population c does not show any split in the k - magnitude distribution of stars at latitudes @xmath58 and @xmath59 , but interestingly at @xmath10 the maximum of the k - magnitude distribution of component c does not coincide with the galaxy centre , but is shifted towards k - magnitude values similar to those where one of the two maxima of the peanut - shaped populations a and b is found ( see fig .",
    "[ ness13fig ] here reproduced from * ? ? ? * and the previous discussion in sect .",
    "[ bulge ] ) .",
    "this may indicate the presence of a weak peanut - shape also in population c , but possibly visible only at larger distances from the galactic plane than those explored by bulge surveys so far .",
    "a mapping of the outer bulge , at @xmath67 , would greatly help in understanding the morphology of the metal - poor bulge populations , and to clarify to what extent the characteristics that we have deduced for these stars from fields at @xmath68 are really representative of their ensemble .",
    "+ the second implication has to do with the spatial distribution of bulge rr lyrae stars .",
    "@xcite found that , at latitudes @xmath69 , bulge rr lyrae in the vvv survey do not show a strong barred distribution , as the one traced by metal - rich red clump stars at similar latitudes , but a more spherical shape ( note however that , at similar latitudes , @xcite found different results : their sample of rr lyrae stars from the ogle - iii experiment shows a barred distribution similar to that of bulge red clump giants ) .",
    "it may be tempting to use these findings as indicative of the presence of a classical spheroid in the bulge .",
    "however , our model predicts that a different strength in the elongation of the bar in thick and thin disc stars is expected , especially at small heights above the plane .",
    "thus , if a different spatial distribution was found between rr lyrae with [ fe / h]@xmath0  dex ",
    "i.e. the rr lyrae population with metallicities compatible with the thick disc  and metal - rich red clump giants in the bulge , this should not be taken as an indication of the presence of a classical spheroid in the bulge . as we show in fig .",
    "[ cutreg2 ] , indeed , the thicker and kinematically warmer the disc is , the weaker and rounder its stellar bar .",
    "also the absence of a clear bimodal distribution in rr lyrae at @xmath70 can be understood in a scenario where the metal - rich ( i.e. [ fe / h]@xmath0  dex ) rr lyrae component is related to the thick disc : indeed , as discussed in the previous point , the peanut - shaped morphology of thick disc stars appears only at large heights above the plane , and is not present at low latitudes , where not even the more metal - rich components of the bulge ( a and b ) show any split .",
    "to understand the properties of the galactic bulge and the way these properties change with metallicity , we need to place this structure in its environment , that is the galactic stellar disc , and take into account the most recent findings about the latter .",
    "the stellar disc is vertically structured , with an @xmath3enhanced , metal - poor and kinematically warm disc ( the so - called thick disc ) at least as massive as the thin counterpart , and mostly concentrated in the inner regions of the galaxy .",
    "the disc is also radially structured , with chemical patterns that differ in the inner ( @xmath71  kpc ) and outer ( @xmath72  kpc ) regions . when this radial and vertical structuring are taken into account ,",
    "the chemical similarity between the bulge and the disc becomes evident , and little room is left for the presence of any classical spheroid .",
    "n - body modeling aiming at understanding and explaining the chemo - kinematic and morphological properties of the different bulge components need to implement the new vision we have acquired of the galactic disc(s ) populations .",
    "first results about the modeling of a composite disc galaxy and its mapping into the bulge are presented and support the hypothesis of a pure ( thin+thick ) disc scenario for the origin of the vast majority ( i.e. for stars with [ fe / h]@xmath0  dex ) of the milky way bulge .",
