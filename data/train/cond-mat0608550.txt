    "ratchet or rectification phenomena appear in many different fields ranging from nanodevices to molecular biology @xcite . in the simplest model a point - like particle",
    "is considered which is driven by deterministic or non - white stochastic forces . under certain conditions related to the breaking of symmetries , unidirectional motion of the particle",
    "can take place although the applied force has zero average in time .",
    "these particle ratchets have been generalized to spatially extended nonlinear systems , in which solitons play a similar role to the above point particles @xcite . in particular , solitons in nonlinear klein - gordon systems",
    "have been shown to move on the average in one direction , although the driving force has zero time average , if either a temporal or a spatial symmetry is broken .    in the first case ,",
    "a biharmonic driving force has been used which breaks a time shift symmetry @xcite . here",
    "the mechanism of the ratchet effect has been clarified in detail by a collective variable theory @xcite , which uses the soliton position @xmath3 and width @xmath4 . due to the coupling between the translational and internal degrees of freedom ,",
    "energy is pumped inhomogeneously into the system , generating a directional motion .",
    "the breaking of the time shift symmetry gives rise to a resonance mechanism that takes place whenever the width @xmath4 oscillates with at least one frequency of the external ac force .",
    "this ratchet effect has been confirmed by experiments with annular josephson junctions @xcite which can be modeled by sine - gordon systems ; here flux quanta ( fluxons ) play the role of the solitons . as the external ac force , biharmonic microwaves have been used .",
    "the biharmonic force has recently been replaced by more general periodic forces which can be expressed by jacobian elliptic functions . there , it turns out that the average soliton velocity exhibits an extremum for a certain value of the modulus of the elliptic functions @xcite .",
    "this means that there is an optimal form for the periodic force .",
    "another way to obtain a soliton ratchet is to break the spatial symmetry .",
    "this has been demonstrated very recently by the introduction of point - like inhomogeneities into nonlinear klein - gordon systems @xcite .",
    "these inhomogeneities can be modeled by @xmath5-functions , if their spatial extent is much smaller than the characteristic length for the system ( the josephson penetration length in the case of the josephson junctions ) . in order to achieve a ratchet effect the @xmath5-functions must form asymmetric periodic arrays .",
    "this asymmetry translates into an asymmetry of an effective potential @xmath6 which appears in a collective variable theory with the variables @xmath7 and @xmath4 .    as an example , three @xmath8-functions of equal strength have been positioned in each cell of an array with period @xmath9 .",
    "the above theory yielded a nearly perfect agreement with the simulations for the inhomogeneous sine - gordon system @xcite . by choosing different arrangements for the positions of the @xmath5-functions within the cells of the array it was possible to increase the average soliton velocity @xmath10 which means that the ratchet system provides better transport .",
    "the aim of this paper is to search for the optimal shape and arrangement of localized inhomogeneities , in the sense that @xmath10 becomes as large as possible .",
    "this means that instead of @xmath8-functions other functions which represent localized inhomogeneities ( e.g. , gaussians , lorentzians , box - type functions etc . )",
    "have to be tested , and that the arrangement of these inhomogeneities within the cells , but also the length @xmath9 of the cells in the periodic array , all have to be optimized .    in section ii nonlinear klein - gordon systems with localized inhomogeneities",
    "are introduced . in section",
    "iii a collective coordinate ( cc ) theory is developed which results in a set of odes containing an effective potential @xmath11 which depends on the inhomogeneities .",

    "iv the optimal effective potential @xmath2 is obtained by using an ansatz in terms of jacobi elliptic functions .",
    "@xmath2 essentially exhibits two features : double peaks consisting of a positive and a negative peak with a steep slope in between , and long flat regions between the double peaks . in section v we show that the essential features of @xmath2 can be produced by choosing appropriately the positions , heights and widths of box inhomogeneities . in this way",
    "very high soliton velocities can be obtained .",
    "these results of the cc- theory are confirmed by full simulations for the sine - gordon system with the above inhomogeneities ( section vi ) .    in the last section",
    "we stress that an important step in the optimization consists in using inhomogeneities with _ opposite _ signs",
    ". both types of inhomogeneities were already used in long josephson junctions , namely microresistors ( critical current @xmath12 decreased ) and microshorts ( @xmath12 increased ) @xcite .",

    "we propose to use a specific combination of both types , resulting in an asymmetric periodic array , which yields very high average soliton velocities both in a collective coordinate theory and in full simulations for the inhomogeneous sine - gordon system .",

    "the whole procedure can not work because the dimension of the parameter space is far too high .",
    "e.g. , if one takes three inhomogeneities per cell , as in the case of the @xmath5-functions , one has 10 parameters , namely three positions , heights and widths of the boxes , plus the cell length @xmath9 .",

    "the negative sign in front of @xmath110 in ( [ ay ] ) is chosen in order to achieve a positive @xmath10 , i.e. average motion to the right . the specific combination ( [ ay ] ) of elliptic functions is chosen because there is no ratchet effect in two limiting cases : for @xmath111 the effective potential is sinusoidal , and for @xmath112 it is zero ( except for a set of points with lebesgue measure zero ) .",
    "thus we can expect that an optimal value @xmath113 naturally exists in the interval @xmath114 , under the condition that there is any ratchet effect for the chosen set of parameters @xmath115 in @xmath109 and @xmath116 in the driving force .",

    "moreover , we observe that @xmath117 changes in steps also as a function of other parameters . for the following",
    "it will be important that @xmath10 as a function of @xmath101 first increases , then decreases in steps ( fig .",
