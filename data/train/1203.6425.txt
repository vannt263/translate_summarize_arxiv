    "in september 2011 we encountered a remarkable and unbelievable paper by the opera collaboration @xcite that * the speed of neutrino exceeds that of light in vacuum*. they measured a collective speed of mu ",
    "neutrino flying from cern to gran sasso laboratory ( see for example the fig . 5 in @xcite )",
    ". however , this result conflicts with special relativity in the most basic sense .    after the paper appeared in the arxiv researchers in the world published or are preparing many papers on this topic .",
    "some of them agree with the result , while others do nt agree according to each author s conviction of the special relativity .",
    "see the hep - ph in the arxiv .",
    "we can not conclude whether this experiment ( detection ) is correct or not at the present time .",
    "of course , it must be checked by other experiment teams .",
    "some researchers protested against the opera detection strongly .",
    "one of main reasons is due to the kamiokande detection in 1987 @xcite .",
    "it detected lights and neutrinos coming from the supernova sn1987a at almost the same time .",
    "if the speed of neutrino is faster than that of light in vacuum , it must have detected neutrinos several years earlier .    by the way ,",
    "mecozzi and bellini in @xcite gave a smart interpretation of the result .",
    "they suggested that the result is due to * the superluminal group velocity * of neutrinos arising from superposition ( namely , the neutrino mixing ) in quantum mechanics @xcite .",
    "the neutrino mixing which is well  known in particle physics is just a quantum mechanical phenomenon .",
    "however , coherence in quantum mechanics is affected by environments and it could be destroyed in short time .",
    "a long  distance flight from sn1987a might have destroyed coherence of neutrinos , and as a result the superluminal group velocity was lost .",
    "the paper @xcite offers an interpretation that the opera result does not conflict with kamiokande detection .    in this note",
    "we provide mathematical reinforcements to the paper @xcite in terms of * decoherence * and would like to offer a",
    " super  smart \" interpretation to the opera result @xcite .",
    "in this section we review the paper @xcite in detail ( because it is a bit unclear from the mathematical point of view ) .    first , we prepare some notation for convenience .",
    "since we treat a two level system in the following the target space is @xmath0 with bases @xmath1 then pauli matrices @xmath2 with the identity @xmath3 @xmath4 act on the space .",
    "the three generations of leptons are @xmath5 however , each neutrino is not single but slightly mixed like @xmath6 this @xmath7 is called the mixing angle in vacuum , which is small enough .",
    "therefore real generations are for example @xmath8 note that the mixing matrix @xmath9 is called the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata matrix ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "let us start with a model @xcite , @xcite .",
    "since we treat two neutrinos @xmath10 in the paper , the dirac equation for the two neutrinos can be reduced to a schrdinger form written in terms of a two component vector of positive energy probability amplitude * in the ultra - relativistic limit*.    then the two neutrino system can be mapped to a two  level quantum system with distinct energy eigenvalues along with * the assumption of equal fixed momenta * @xcite .",
    "we set that @xmath11 are the neutrino masses and @xmath12 are the energies given by the approximation @xmath13 ( @xmath14 from the assumption ) and @xmath7 is the mixing angle .",
    "the hamiltonian becomes @xmath15 where @xmath16 here , note that @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "let us rewrite @xmath19 in ( [ eq : hamiltonian-1 ] ) in a familiar form by making use of pauli matrices above @xmath20 for this it is easy to obtain the eigenvalues @xmath21 and the corresponding eigenvectors @xmath22 if we define a unitary matrix @xmath23 then we can make @xmath19 diagonal like @xmath24 or in a spectral decomposition form @xmath25 these forms are used in the next section .",
    "next , we label the hamiltonian by the momentum @xmath26 .",
    "namely , @xmath27 this is in a certain sense the graph of a function .",
    "if we define eigenvectors of @xmath28 in ( [ eq : full - hamiltonian ] ) as simultaneous ones of both flavor and momentum @xmath29 then we have @xmath30 therefore , the spectral decomposition of @xmath28 is given by @xmath31 next , we consider a time ",
    "evolution of the system .",
    "the state @xmath32 at time @xmath33 is given by @xmath34 , and straightforward calculation with ( [ eq : spectral decomposition ] ) gives @xmath35 where @xmath36 for simplicity .",
    "from now on we assume some conditions :    ( a )  we start with one neutrino flavor , namely , @xmath37 ,    ( b )  the initial amplitude of the neutrino waveform is @xmath38 .",
    "these assumptions seem to be natural .",
    "then it is easy to see that ( [ eq : evolution-1 ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath39   \\nonumber \\\\ & { } & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] by use of ( [ eq : eigenvectors ] ) .",
    "now let us start detection of neutrino :    ( a )  first , we perform a flavor measurement ( for example , flavor 1 ) ,    ( b )  immediately after ( a ) , we perform a position measurement .",
    "when flavor 1 is detected the collapsed state becomes @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the normalization factor given by @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) and @xmath44 is the projection operator to the flavor 1 state (: @xmath45 ) .",
    "it is in general difficult to perform a position measurement immediately after flavor 1 is detected , so we average the positions of neutrinos .",
    "we believe that this replacement is not so bad .",
    "the expectation value of position measurement on the collapsed state @xmath46 is given by @xmath47 this is a kind of definition .",
    "note that @xmath48 is a position operator , because @xmath49 we must evaluate the expectation value of position @xmath50 .",
    "from ( [ eq : collapsed state ] ) and noting the formula @xmath51 we have and set @xmath52 for simplicity .",
    "first , let us calculate @xmath53 . from ( [ eq : evolution-2 ] ) and the formula ( [ eq : delta function ]",
    ") it is easy to see @xmath54 where @xmath55 then the normalization factor @xmath41 in ( [ eq : normalization factor ] ) becomes @xmath56 now , we make another assumption .",
    "the initial distribution of the neutrino momentum @xmath57 is narrow with respect to @xmath58 , and centered on @xmath59 ( @xmath26 is fixed ) .",
    "namely , @xmath60 for later convenience we calculate ( [ eq : value of d ] ) .",
    "here is an elementary formula    * formula *  for @xmath61 @xmath62 this gives @xmath63 by use of ( [ eq : f formula ] ) ( note that @xmath64 ) .    by inserting the equation ( [ eq : relation ] ) into @xmath65 in ( [ eq : position ] ) we have and set @xmath66 for simplicity .",
    "next , let us calculate @xmath67 and @xmath68 separately .    from @xmath69 we have @xmath70 by use of the assumption in ( [ eq : initial distribution ] ) .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath71 the range of integration is narrow enough because of the assumption in ( [ eq : initial distribution ] ) , so we approximate the integration like    @xmath72    therefore , we obtain the approximate value latexmath:[\\[\\label{eq : n_{1 } } { \\cal n}_{1}=\\mbox{re}{\\cal n}_{1}+i\\mbox{im}{\\cal n}_{1 } \\approx     for @xmath68 we have @xmath74 by use of the assumption in ( [ eq : initial distribution ] ) .",
    "then ( [ eq : n_1 ] ) and ( [ eq : n_2 ] ) give @xmath75 and ( [ eq : position ] ) and ( [ eq : value of d ] ) give ( the approximate value ) @xmath76 next , let us calculate the right hand side of ( [ eq : value of position ] ) by use of ( [ eq : f formula ] ) : @xmath77 noting @xmath78 we have @xmath79 and @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the terms which will be neglected at the final stage .",
    "this gives @xmath82 and @xmath50 in ( [ eq : value of position ] ) is given by @xmath83 * definition *  the group velocity @xmath84 is given by @xmath85 therefore it becomes @xmath86 from the result above .",
    "remembering @xmath87 from ( [ eq : hamiltonian-1 ] ) simple calculation gives @xmath88 and by inserting the above into ( [ eq : group velocity ] ) we have @xmath89 where @xmath90 is given by @xmath91 from ( [ eq:|f(p)|^2 ] ) .    as a result",
    "we obtain    * theorem * ( mecozzi and bellini )  the group velocity @xmath84 is given by @xmath92 note that the term @xmath90 was obtained from a quantum effect ( the neutrino mixing ) and this plays a definite role in * superluminal group velocity*.    let us analyze the theorem . for the purpose we set @xmath93 to look for some condition satisfying @xmath94 .",
    "namely , @xmath95 therefore , we obtain @xmath96 here , we assume @xmath97",
    ". then @xmath98 from ( [ eq : hamiltonian-1 ] ) and @xmath94 gives @xmath99 as a result    * corollary 1 *  under the conditions @xmath100 and @xmath97 we have the superluminal group velocity @xmath101 * note *   in general , the higher the generation , the heavier corresponding mass .",
    "therefore , the assumption @xmath97 is not unnatural .",
    "if @xmath102 ( no neutrino mixing ) then @xmath103 from ( [ eq : s ] ) and we have @xmath104 under @xmath97 . as a result    * corollary 2 *  if @xmath102 we have the usual velocity @xmath105 under @xmath100 and @xmath97 .    we can not help admitting a mechanism which accelerates neutrinos arising from the neutrino oscillation .",
    "how do we interpret the result ?",
    "what is the relation to special relativity ?",
    "in the last part of the paper @xcite they write :     of course , this does not mean that the speed of a possible signal transmitted with a neutrino wave - packet exceeds the speed of light , it is just a property that comes from the wave - packet deformation caused by the interference of the two possible quantum paths that a neutrino may follow before reaching the detector \" .",
    "unfortunately , the author can not understand what they meant and therefore present the following    * problem *  give a mathematical expression to their claim .",
    "in this section , for the model in the previous section we take * decoherence * into consideration in order to make it more realistic .",
    "then we can build a bridge between corollary 1 and corollary 2 . for a general introduction to this topic",
    "see for example @xcite .",
    "first of all we present the following    * problem *  is there no problem to apply theory of decoherence to neutrinos in a long  distance flight ?",
    "although this problem is very subtle , let us proceed to the discussion of decoherence .",
    "since the two neutrino system can be mapped to the two level system we prepare some notation from quantum optics . for @xmath106",
    "it is easy to see @xmath107 let us remember @xmath108 from ( [ eq : diagonal form ] ) and set @xmath109 note that @xmath19 and @xmath110 are symmetric matrices ( @xmath111 ,   @xmath112 ) .    to treat decoherence in a correct manner we must change models based on from a pure state to a density matrix .",
    "the general definition of density matrix @xmath113 is given by both @xmath114 and @xmath115 , so we can write @xmath116 as @xmath117 the general form of master equation is well  known to be @xmath118+d\\rho \\quad ( \\leftarrow \\hbar=1\\   \\mbox{for simplicity})\\ ] ] where @xmath119 and @xmath120 . and @xmath121 in our system ] we must solve the equation .    if we write @xmath19 in ( [ eq : diagonal form again ] ) as @xmath122 for simplicity , then the master equation above can be rewritten as @xmath123 we leave the derivation to readers .",
    "note and set @xmath124 the general solution of ( [ eq : master equation 2 ] ) is given by @xmath125 however , it is not easy to calculate the term @xmath126 exactly , so we use a simple approximation @xmath127 in general , we must use the zassenhaus formula , see for example @xcite , @xcite .",
    "therefore , we treat the approximate solution @xmath128    first , we calculate @xmath129 . for the purpose we set @xmath130 and calculate @xmath131 .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath132 are @xmath133 and corresponding eigenvectors ( not normalized ) are @xmath134 if we define the matrix @xmath135 then it is easy to see @xmath136 and @xmath137 therefore , we have @xmath138 if @xmath33 is large enough ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "next , we calculate @xmath140 .",
    "since we need some properties of tensor product in the following see for example @xcite .",
    "we can write the equation as @xmath141 in fact , @xmath142 it is well  known that @xmath143 since @xmath144 we have @xmath145 and @xmath146 since @xmath147 we have @xmath148 and , by setting @xmath149 for simplicity , @xmath150 where @xmath151 and @xmath152 note that @xmath153 s in the matrix are elements not used in the latter .",
    "we leave this derivation to readers .    here , we list very important relations among @xmath154 @xmath155 therefore , from ( [ eq : general approximate solution ] ) and ( [ eq : important relations ] ) we obtain @xmath156 for @xmath139 .    for @xmath110 in ( [ eq : diagonal matrix ] ) @xmath157 we can perform the same process much easily .",
    "the master equation is @xmath158 and the ( exact ) solution is given by @xmath159 when @xmath139 we obtain @xmath160 as a result we have    * theorem *  two systems ( master equations ) whose hamiltonians are @xmath19 and @xmath110 have the same asymptotic behavior ( [ eq : fujii i ] ) and ( [ eq : fujii ii ] ) under our approximation .",
    "this theorem implies    * corollary *  the mixing angle @xmath7 will become @xmath161 if @xmath33 is large enough .    from both this corollary and corollary 2 in the preceding section",
    "we can conclude that the speed of neutrinos ( after a long  distance flight ) is just that of light in vacuum .    by the way , our calculation in this section is based on a simple approximation .",
    "this is a bit poor , so we present the following    * problem *  give the explicit ( full ) calculation .    as for interesting topics of decoherence ( which is essential in quantum physics ) arising from quantum optics or quantum computation",
    "see our papers @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , @xcite .    at the end of this section ,",
    "one comment is in order .",
    "it seems to the author that neutrino physics gets along with quantum optics or quantum computation , see for example @xcite . in order to make some ( deep ) relations clear further studies will be required",
    "in this paper we re - examined the paper @xcite by mecozzi and bellini in detail and tried to give mathematical reinforcements to it by taking decoherence into consideration .",
    "our conclusion is            whether the opera experiment is correct or not is not concluded at the present time and it must be checked by other experiment teams .",
    "however , such a check will take time",
