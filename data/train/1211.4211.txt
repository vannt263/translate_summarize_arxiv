    "laser control of molecular rotation , alignment and orientation has received significant attention in recent years ( see e.g.  reviews @xcite ) .",
    "interest in the field has increased , mainly due to the improved capabilities to manipulate the characteristics of the laser pulses ( such as time duration and temporal shape ) , which in turn lead to potential applications offered by controlling the angular distribution of molecules . since the typical rotational time scale of small molecules is long ( @xmath0 ) compared to the typical short pulse duration ( @xmath1 ) , effective rotational control and manipulation are in reach . during the last decade ,",
    "coherent rotational dynamics of pulse - excited molecules was studied @xcite , and multiple pulse sequences giving rise to enhanced alignment were suggested @xcite , and realized experimentally @xcite .",
    "further manipulations , such as optical molecular centrifuge @xcite and alignment - dependent strong field ionization of molecules @xcite , were demonstrated .",
    "selective rotational excitation in bimolecular mixtures was suggested and demonstrated in the mixtures of molecular isotopes @xcite and molecular nuclear - spin isomers @xcite .",
    "aligned molecules were also shown to be useful for other applications , including : generation and modification of ultrashort light pulses @xcite , control of high harmonic generation @xcite , amplification of terahertz pulses @xcite , elucidation of molecular structure @xcite , rotational spectroscopy @xcite , manipulation of chemical reactions @xcite , and others .",
    "finally , it was demonstrated that these new methods for manipulation of molecular rotation can also be used to modify the motion of molecules in inhomogeneous fields , such as focused laser beams @xcite , or static electric @xcite and magnetic @xcite fields .",
    "modification of the molecule - surface scattering and molecule - surface reactions by external fields of different nature is a long - standing research problem . in particular ,",
    "the effect of molecular orientation by a static electric hexapole field on the scattering process was investigated in detail @xcite .",
    "laser control of the gas - surface scattering process was achieved using multiphoton ionization of the impinging molecules by long laser pulses of variable polarization @xcite , and the possibility of controlling molecular _ adsorption _ on solid surfaces using ultrashort laser pulses was discussed @xcite .    in a recent paper @xcite ,",
    "we investigated two possible schemes for modifying molecular scattering from _ flat _ surfaces .",
    "in the first scheme , we considered excitation of unidirectional molecular rotation via the combined action of a short laser pulse on molecules in a molecular beam , followed by a surface collision of these molecules . in the second scheme",
    ", we suggested exciting a molecular beam , consisting of two molecular species , by two properly delayed laser pulses , in order to provide selective rotational excitation of one of the species .",
    "we have shown that these two species are then scattered differently from a solid surface , in a way that the scattered beam is enriched in one of the species , for specific scattering angles .",
    "the current paper extends the model of molecule - surface scattering that we used in @xcite .",
    "we treat here surfaces that are not flat , but _ corrugated _ on different length scales .",
    "one limit includes surfaces whose corrugation period is larger than the size of the molecule .",
    "the model we developed according to this limit is based on the model in @xcite .",
    "this model is referred to throughout the paper as the _ corrugated surface _ model .",
    "this limit corresponds to highly corrugated surfaces , such as @xmath2 @xcite , or @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "another limit includes surfaces with corrugation period smaller than the size of the molecule , or relatively flat surfaces . here",
    "the model is based on the work of @xcite .",
    "this model is referred to below as the _ surface with friction _ model .",
    "this limit corresponds to relatively flat surfaces , such as @xmath4 , where mechanisms other than surface corrugation exist for producing forces tangent to the surface , such as : tangentially directed phonons , creation of electron - hole pairs , etc . @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we continue to investigate the ability to modify and to control the molecule - surface scattering processes by using ultrashort laser pulses .",
    "these laser pulses ( mainly femtosecond laser pulses ) align the molecules or set them in some specific rotational motion , before the molecules hit the surface .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ model1 ] we present the model of molecular scattering from a corrugated surface . the classical model of interaction between an ultrashort laser pulse and a linear rigid molecule",
    "is briefly summarized in sec .",
    "[ laser ] .",
    "then , in sec .",
    "[ results1 ] , it is shown that a laser pulse aligning the molecules before they scatter from a corrugated surface , leads to a correlation between the direction of scattering of the molecules and their sense of rotation .",
    "this correlation also depends on the direction of polarization of the laser .",
    "the two - dimensional and the three - dimensional models of molecular scattering from a surface with friction is next presented in sec .",
    "[ model2 ] .",
    "accordingly , in sec .  [ results2 ] , the scattering of molecules from a surface with friction , set in rotation in a specific sense by laser pulses , is investigated .",
    "it is shown , that a correlation exists between the sense of rotation of the molecules impinging on the surface , and their scattering angles . finally , in sec .  [ conclusions ] we conclude and summarize .",
    "here we develop a model and analyze the scattering of a molecule from a surface that is corrugated at a length scale larger than the size of the molecule .",
    "this model can qualitatively describe the scattering process from surfaces , such as pt(211 ) @xcite .",
    "the model developed here is an extension of our model @xcite from flat to corrugated surfaces .",
    "our treatment of corrugations is based on the model of tully @xcite .",
    "the diatomic molecule is treated as a rigid dumbbell @xcite .",
    "this dumbbell collides with a corrugated , but _ frictionless _ , surface , which is composed of hard cubes on identical springs ,",
    "see fig .",

    "each cube represents one ( or several ) of the surface atoms @xcite .",
    "we assume that the corrugation is one dimensional , and that its period is larger than the molecular bond length , such that the molecule collides with a single cube that is oriented in a definite angle .",
    "we also assume that the cube oscillates with an amplitude determined by the surface temperature .",
    "this hard cube model provides a simple way of adding surface phonons to the process . for the sake of simplicity",
    ", we also assume that the cube is much heavier than the molecule , so that its velocity does not change as a result of the collision . by moving to the reference frame attached to the cube ,",
    "one reduces the problem to the molecular collision with a motionless hard wall . in the moving coordinate system",
    ", the molecular total energy ( translational+rotational ) is conserved , but it can be redistributed between these two parts as a result of the collision .    what about the translational linear momentum of the center of mass of the molecule in the moving coordinate system ?",
    "the momentum component that is _ locally perpendicular _ to the surface is not conserved , because the vibrating cube exerts forces on the molecule in this direction during the collision . on the other hand ,",
    "there are no forces applied in the direction that is _ locally parallel _ to the frictionless surface , and therefore the linear momentum locally parallel to the surface is conserved .",
    "it follows , that because of the corrugation , the momentum that is _ globally parallel _ to the surface is not conserved , contrary to the case of a flat frictionless surface .    using energy and angular momentum conservation laws (",
    "angular momentum is conserved only in the coordinate frame centered at the position of the colliding atom ) , we find analytic expressions for the translational and the rotational velocities of the dumbbell molecule after the collision .",
    "these velocities depend on the local velocities before the collision , and on the local angle between the dumbbell and the face of the cube at the moment of collision .",
    "finally , we transform the velocities back to the laboratory coordinate frame .",
    "it is important to emphasize that our model treats the molecule as a dumbbell , although it is also possible to treat it as an ellipsoid @xcite . in our model , differently from the model used in @xcite , we include three - dimensional rotation and multiple collisions of the molecule with the surface .    in the next subsections ,",
    "we first define the coordinates and the surface corrugation in subsection [ coordinates1 ] . then , we consider the effects of the surface - cube vibration on the collision in subsection [ vibration ] . in subsection",
    "[ collision1 ] , we provide the results for the molecular velocities after the collision as a function of the velocities before the collision and of the molecular orientation .",

    "scattering out of the @xmath29-plane is not possible in the framework of this model , due to the absence of corrugation along the @xmath33-direction , and to the absence of a local friction .",

    "we also assume that after a collision ( possibly multiple ) with a single cube , the molecule leaves the surface and can not collide with other surface cubes .",

    "the reason is that for a flat and frictionless cube only the vertical velocity component can transfer energy to the impinging molecule .",

    "<S> we consider solid surface scattering of molecules that were subject to strong non - resonant ultrashort laser pulses just before hitting the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the pulses modify the rotational states of the molecules , causing their field free alignment , or a rotation with a preferred sense . </S>",
    "<S> we show that field - free laser induced molecular alignment leads to correlations between the scattering angle and the sense of rotation of the scattered molecules . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , by controlling the sense of laser induced unidirectional molecular rotation , one may affect the scattering angle of the molecules . </S>",
    "<S> this provides a new means for separation of mixtures of molecules ( such as isotopes and nuclear - spin isomers ) by laser controlled surface scattering . </S>"
