    "the two - body problem of a particle - hole pair in the half filled band was treated as an exactly solvable case of the mott transition by several authors .",
    "@xcite to describe physically relevant situations in this approach , one must treat the many - body problem of the particle - hole bound states .",

    "we show that the ferromagnetic state in the over - doped region of the strong coupling hubbard model is destabilized by the individual - particle excitation , as shastry et al . noted .",
    "@xcitehowever it is found that in almost all the other region the instability is controlled by softening of the spin - wave stiffness . in [ sec : sfs ] , we give a phase diagram showing this feature on the basis of a variational trial state .",
    "we estimate an upper bound for @xmath2 , which is defined by @xmath3 for the ferromagnetic threshold in the limit @xmath0 and @xmath4 .",
    "stability of the double exchange ferromagnet is discussed in [ sec : dex ] . incidentally , in appendix [ sec : n=1 ] , we discuss that the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model can be reproduced by using the results of the two - body problem , or from the spin wave in the insulating ferromagnetic state .",

    "with respect to ( iii ) , we are led to the following speculation ; beyond spin - wave instability , the spin wave with momentum @xmath32 which gives the minimum @xmath33 will be set to populate the ferromagnetic state , resulting in bose - einstein condensation of the boson @xmath34 . in particular , around half filling @xmath35",
    ", the resulting state will be the commensurate nel ordered phase with @xmath36 .",
    "upon doping @xmath37 , e.g. for @xmath29 , the resulting phase will become the spiral state with incommensurate modulation @xmath38 .",
    "qualitatively this is consistent with the result of recent studies .",
    "@xcitemoreover , further hole doping ( @xmath39 for @xmath29 ) stabilizes the ferromagnetic state , just as concluded from the mean - field treatment .",
    "@xcitehowever , the latter point on the stability of the ferromagnetic state as well as the above point ( i ) are shown to be modified by improving the approximation .",
    "next we consider the following creation operator to improve the trial state created by eq .",
    "( [ df : ar ] ) ; @xmath40 the wavefunction of this form was first used by roth  @xcite and also adopted later by shastry et al .",
    "@xcite to investigate stability of the nagaoka ferromagnetic state .",
    "however , since the spin wave spectrum for general @xmath41 and finite @xmath27 derived from ( [ imptrial ] ) , which turns out to be important for our purpose , has not yet been thoroughly investigated , we derive results by ourselves from the outset .",
    "mathematical details are deferred to appendix [ ap : math ] .",
    "below we show only results to compare them with those given in the last subsection .    for the square lattice , the bottom of the continuum @xmath42 and @xmath22 for @xmath23 ( @xmath43 ) and @xmath44",
    "are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , and @xmath22 for various values of @xmath12 are shown in fig .",

    "[ fig:2 ] , respectively .",
    "as for @xmath22 , in the slightly doped region @xmath45 , the results are not modified considerably from those of the rpa . on the other side , the individual particle - hole spectrum presents a striking contrast as is clear from fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] . in the improved estimate , the continuum no more has energy of order @xmath27 , but it forms a flat band lying in the low energy region . this is because of the fact that vacancy made through the hole doping enables particles to hop around , though it is a quite restricted motion .",
    "@xcite as the density of hole @xmath46 increases , the band width of @xmath47 broadens and finally we have a vanishing binding energy @xmath48 for @xmath41 which gives the lowest @xmath22 , as shown in fig .  [ fig:3 ] .",
    "in the over - doped region , therefore , the spin wave for @xmath49 can not be regarded as a well - defined bound state .",
    "in our previous papers ,  @xcitewe discussed stability of itinerant ferromagnets on the basis of a model comprising degenerate orbitals . in the strong coupling limit , we observed that the instability condition derived from the individual particle excitation is more stringent than the condition concluded for the spin wave instability .",
    "therefore , putting more emphasis on the study of the individual particle excitation than for the spin wave spectrum , we calculated the critical interaction @xmath50 below which excitation energy of the individual particle - hole pair becomes negative as a function of carrier density @xmath12 .",
    "@xcitethe result for the hubbard model was that @xmath50 approaches a finite value as @xmath1 both for a square and a simple cubic lattice .",
    "in other words , we could not prove instability of the nagaoka ferromagnetic state in the under - doped strong - coupling region , even though more elaborated trial state than that derived from eq .",
    "( [ imptrial ] ) is used to estimate energy of the individual - particle excitation . on the contrary , for the hubbard model",
    ", a simple argument can be given , indicating that @xmath50 should become infinity as @xmath1 .",
    "to show this , one may consider the case where holes of concentration @xmath51 are doped into the half - filled hubbard model . if @xmath52 is small enough , energy of the complete ferromagnetic state",
    "is given by @xmath53 per site .",
    "on the other hand , energy of the antiferromagnetic configuration is @xmath54 per site .",
    "therefore , equating these two , the critical boundary is expected to take the form @xmath55 , as was noted by nagaoka .",
    "@xcitethis argument however does not tell us whether the instability is brought about locally ( continuously ) or globally .",
    "we show that it is in fact given as a local instability by investigating the spin wave excitation for a strong but finite interaction energy .",
    "it is noted here that a quantitative aspect of the above fact was addressed in a recent work by hanisch et al ,  @xcite where emphasis is put on how far the stable region of the nagaoka state can be reduced , rather than its physical origin of our concern .",
    "we display the inverse of the critical coupling as a function of @xmath12 in fig.[fig:5 ] and fig.[fig:6 ] for a square and a simple cubic lattice , respectively .",
    "@xcite in the figures , threshold curves determined using eq .",
    "( [ imptrial ] ) are shown .",
    "these are calculated by the conditions @xmath56 ( dashed ) , @xmath57 ( long - dashed ) and @xmath58 ( solid line ) , where @xmath59 is the minimum value of @xmath26 . in the region above the curves ,",
    "the ferromagnetic state is absolutely unstable .",
    "mathematical details for @xmath47 , @xmath22 and @xmath60 are given in appendix [ ap : math ] .",

    "( [ ap : drpa ] ) is also shown .",
    "it is clear how the trial state ( [ imptrial ] ) improves the result of the rpa ; in the latter we can not prove instability for any @xmath12 in the strong coupling region .    the figures show that , in the strong coupling limit @xmath61 , the individual particle excitation ( dashed curve ) brings about instability prior to the softening of the stiffness constant ( solid curve ) , just in accordance with our previous results",
    ". however the phase boundary in the other region is primarily determined by the spin - wave instability , @xmath63 . in particular , in the region @xmath0 and @xmath64 , the phase boundary is of the form @xmath65 and is determined by the spin - wave instability . in this limit , we can not distinguish the two results by @xmath66 and @xmath58 , which in turn do not differ appreciably from @xmath62 .",
    "physically we may say that the spin - wave instability determines threshold for ferromagnetism in the region where the metal - insulator transition is likely to occur .",
    "a similar behavior is observed also for the double exchange ferromagnet as shown in the next subsection .",
    "as for @xmath3 , our calculation gives @xmath67 for the square lattice ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "for the simple cubic lattice ( @xmath69 ) , we obtained @xmath70 , which is better than @xmath71 of richmond and rickayzen ,  @xcite who estimated @xmath2 by assuming a flipped spin to stay at a single site , i.e. , not to hop around in a lattice as the spin wave does . for reference ,",
    "we cite nagaoka s estimate  @xcite @xmath72 for a simple cubic lattice .",
    "this value , however , is not to be compared with our result since the former does not have a variational significance .",
    "our result , being based on the variational treatment , sets the exact upper bound for the true value of @xmath2 .",
    "next , we consider the ferromagnetic kondo lattice ( double exchange ) model , @xmath73 where we assume a positive coupling @xmath74 .",
    "this model with @xmath75 is often used to describe the lanthanum manganese oxides la@xmath76mno@xmath77 , where @xmath78 is a divalent ion such as sr , pb or ca . to create a trial state for the spin wave excitation , we use the operator @xmath79 which reduces to eq .",
    "( [ imptrial ] ) when @xmath80 .",
    "the expression for @xmath81 , when @xmath82 , was previously treated by us .",
    "@xcite    as an example , we show threshold for the instability of the double exchange ferromagnet , the ferromagnetic ground state of ( [ fkl ] ) . in fig.[fig:7 ] , we show @xmath83 determined by @xmath58 as a function of carrier density @xmath12 ( solid curve ) where @xmath84 represents the mean - field exchange splitting of the model ( [ fkl ] ) .",
    "we assumed a tight - binding band in a simple cubic lattice . in the figure",
    ", we juxtaposed our previous result  @xcite ( dashed curve ) , which was obtained by investigating the instability of the individual particle excitation ; shown as the dashed curve in the right figure of fig .",
    "9 of ref .",
    "experimentally , the itinerant ferromagnetic state is observed only in a restricted range @xmath85 . on the assumption that the model ( [ fkl ] ) adequately describes the manganese oxides , we may conclude that the observed result is explained by assuming @xmath86 , i.e. , @xmath87 with the band width @xmath88 .",
    "in particular , our results indicate the spin wave instability in the under - doped regime , while in the over - doped regime the instability is controlled by the individual particle excitation with wavenumber @xmath89 . generally the spin wave @xmath22 is made unstable first at the momentum @xmath90 .",
    "therefore the resulting phase beyond the instability is expected to be the incommensurate spiral state ,  @xcite as in the case of the hubbard model .    in fig.[fig:8 ] , we show the @xmath91 dependence of the phase boundary @xmath92 in a square lattice .",
    "solid curves are determined by @xmath58 .",
    "as above , for the instability due to the individual - particle excitation ( denoted by long - dashed curves ) , we adopted the more stringent condition @xmath93 on the basis of our previous results ( 7@xmath949 ) and ( 7@xmath9410 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite , than that concluded from the expression derived from ( [ imptrialdex ] ) , the counterpart of eq .",
    "( [ ap : etaqk ] ) .",
    "the figure shows that the threshold near @xmath1 is determined by @xmath58 , as in the case of the hubbard model .",
    "the @xmath58 portion of the phase boundary increases as a function of @xmath91 .",
    "in particular for @xmath95 in the square lattice , the boundary is exclusively determined by the condition @xmath58 down to @xmath96 , while we found that the solid curve @xmath58 and the dashed curve cross each other around @xmath97 for @xmath95 in the simple cubic lattice ( not shown in fig.[fig:7 ] ) .",
    "note that in the case @xmath95 the boundary is the same as the result of the random phase approximation .",
    "( see @xmath62 of fig.[fig:5 ] , as well as eqs .",
    "( [ ap : drpa ] ) and  ( [ ap : drpa2 ] ) . )",
    "we see that all the boundaries in fig.[fig:8 ] approach to a finite value as @xmath98 .",
    "this is a specific feature of two - dimensional lattices .",
    "generally for @xmath99 , the parmeter @xmath100 in ( [ imptrialdex ] ) determined variationally increases from zero to @xmath101 as @xmath12 decreases from 1 to 0 .",
    "thus one can show that the condition @xmath58 gives @xmath102 in the limit @xmath98 for the square lattice , using eqs .",
    "( [ ap : drpa ] ) and  ( [ ap : drpa2 ] ) . on the other hand , in the simple cubic lattice",
    ", we have @xmath103 in this limit ( fig.[fig:7 ] ) .",
    "finally we note that the physically relevant situation @xmath75 lies just in between the classical ( @xmath95 ) and the quantum ( @xmath104 ) limit .",
    "in the previous section , we showed that the ferromagnetic state in the hubbard model as well as in the double exchange model is unstable to the spin - wave excitation in the under - doped region , while it is unstable to the individual - particle excitation in the strong - coupling over - doped region . generally the spin wave mode @xmath22 may take a mimimum at finite wave vector @xmath105 .",
    "this minimum is interpreted to indicate the potential spiral - spin correlation contained in the ferromagnetic configuration , which becomes conspicuous as the excitation gap @xmath106 approaches zero .",
    "we found that the softening of the long - wavelength spin wave mode @xmath107 closely follows the gap collapse @xmath108 .",
    "thus we may conclude that the spin - wave instability is a precursor of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "it is physically plausible that instability of the ferromagnetic state in the region where the metal - insulator transition is likely to occur is dictated by the spin wave instability , since the spin wave is nothing but a particle - hole bound state in the ferromagnetic vacuum and , on the other side , we may interpret the mott insulator as composed of the particle - hole bound states ( appendix [ sec : n=1 ] ) .",
    "therefore we expect that the above conclusion is generally valid ; for example , instability of ferromagnetism in the situation appropriate to metallic nickel will be caused by the individual - particle excitation since the filling @xmath109 per band is far from being critical for the metal - insulator transition . in this respect ,",
    "we note that the hubbard model as a model for an itinerant ferromagnet is a rather exceptional case , because the ferromagnetic state if any can be realized only around half - filling ( nagaoka limit ) .",
    "this is the reason why we found a dominant role played by the spin - wave instability in fig.[fig:5 ] and fig.[fig:6 ] .",
    "finally let us speculate on the approach to the metal - insulator transition from the ferromagnetic side .",
    "we could derive the antiferromagnetic heisenberg model from the spin - wave dispersion of the ferromagnetic insulating state , and observed that , unlike the individual - particle excitation spectrum , the spin - wave dispersion itself does not change drastically upon hole doping ( fig .",
    "[ fig:1 ] and fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) . then if the spin wave as a particle - hole bound state is robust even when slight amount of holes are doped , the paramagnetic phase realized after the spin - wave instability may show anomalous metallic properties .",
    "this kind of consideration make sense just around half filling only where the lowest energy spin - wave state can be regarded as a well - defined bound state ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "although it is an interesting problem to consider the interacting ferromagnetic spin wave as an elementary constituent , further investigation on this point requires complicated calculation which is far beyond the scope of this article .",
    "the author would like to thank professor k. yamada for discussions and critical comments .",
    "this work is supported by research fellowships of the japan society for the promotion of science for young scientists .",
    "let us consider the simplest case of a particle - hole pair in the ferromagnetic band insulator , @xmath110 then the eigenequation for @xmath22 , which is the eigenvalue of the state ( [ psiq ] ) , is given by @xmath111 this is obtained as a limit @xmath1 of eq .",
