    "black hole x - ray binaries ( bhxrb ) spend most of their time in a quiescent state , which is occasionally interrupted by outbursts of activity . as the outburst evolves the source passes through different accretion states and both the variability and spectral properties change ( e.g. miyamoto et al .",
    "1992 ; belloni et al . 2005 ; remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) .",
    "the variability properties of these sources have been extensively studied in the past , revealing the existence of trends as a function of accretion state and/or luminosity ( e.g. zdziarski et al .",
    "2004 ; muoz - darias , motta , & belloni 2011 ; belloni , motta , & muoz - darias 2011 )",
    ". however , due to the sensitivity limits of the detectors employed ( particularly the proportional counter array , pca , on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ , rxte ) , these studies have been mostly limited to energies @xmath1 3 kev . at these energies the _ broad - frequency - band _ ( e.g. in the typical frequency range @xmath2 hz )",
    "aperiodic variability progressively decreases as the outburst evolves , with the fractional root - mean - square ( _ rms _ ) variability amplitude ( e.g. nandra et al .",
    "1997 ; vaughan et al 2003 ; ponti et al . 2004 ) dropping from values of tens of percent in the canonical hard state , down to a few percent in the canonical soft state ( belloni et al . 2005 ; muoz - darias , motta & belloni 2011 ) . during the hard state",
    "the fractional _ rms _ shows an `` inverted spectrum '' ( decreasing with energy ) , which switches to a `` hard spectrum '' ( increasing with energy , at least above @xmath05 kev ) during intermediate and soft states ( e.g. zdziarski et al .",
    "2004 ; belloni et al .",
    "2011 , as illustrated in the inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] ) .",
    "these behaviours are usually ascribed to variations of the relative contribution of the main x - ray spectral components ( e.g. gierliski & zdziarski 2005 ) .",
    "indeed , over the past years , the general idea was that the strong _ broad - frequency - band _ variability characterizing the hard state was associated with the comptonized hard x - ray emission ( power law ) from the corona ( or the base of a radio - emitting jet , e.g. zdziarski et al .",
    "1998 ; markoff , nowak , & wilms 2005 ; droulans et al . 2010 ) , since this component dominates the x - ray spectrum during this state . on the other hand , the disc - thermal component , known to be variable on the time scales of the outburst ,",
    "was thought to be intrinsically constant on shorter ( than about hours - minutes ) time scales ( e.g. gierliski & zdziarski 2005 ) .",
    "given that the disc dominates the spectrum up to energies of @xmath3 kev during the soft state , it would then be responsible for the drop of _ broad - frequency - band _ variability amplitude , and for the change of shape of the fractional _ rms _ spectrum .",
    "+ the way these variability properties extrapolate to soft x - ray energies ( @xmath4 kev ) during the hard state is currently poorly known . since , during the hard state the disc component gives non - negligible contribution in the soft x - ray energy band ( @xmath5 1 kev ; tomsick et al .",
    "2008 ; kolehmainen , done , & daz - trigo 2014 ) , to some extent we would expect to observe behaviours similar to those characterizing the disc during the soft state .",
    "however , the recent use of data from the epic - pn detector onboard xmm - newton ( sensitive down to @xmath00.3 kev ) , for the spectral - timing analysis of bhxrbs , unveiled the existence of high levels of intrinsic ( on time scales of @xmath61 s ) disc variability in the hard state ( wilkinson & uttley , 2009 ) . though this result has been obtained studying a single dataset for each of the two sources gx 339 - 4 and swift j1753.5 - 0127 , it might represent a general property of bhxrbs .",
    "thus , extending timing studies down to soft x - ray energies is crucial in order to gain a complete understanding of the disc - corona variability processes .",
    "+ another important property of x - ray variability in bhxrbs is that the characteristic time scales vary during the outburst . during the hard state",
    "all the variability components ( commonly modeled with lorentzians ; belloni , psaltis , & van der klis 2002 ) in the power spectral density function ( psd ) shift towards higher frequencies as the luminosity increases , while keeping tight correlations between each other ( e.g. belloni et al . 2005 ; done & gierliski 2005 ) .",
    "this indicates strong dependence of x - ray variability on the luminosity / mass - accretion rate of the source .",
    "the shift of the characteristic frequencies as a function of mass - accretion rate is a general property of accreting systems . indeed , as in bhxrbs , a scaling ( consistent with being linear ; mchardy et al .",
    "2006 ; koerding et al .",
    "2007 ) also links the `` high - frequency break '' ( edelson & nandra 1999 ) and the mass - accretion rate in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) . however , despite all these variations in both characteristic frequencies and _ broad - frequency - band _ variability amplitude , the _ high - frequency _ psd ( i.e. above the peak - frequency of the high - frequency lorentzian ) remains remarkably constant during the entire outburst ( gierliski , nikoajuk & czerny , 2008 ) , indicating little or no - dependence on the luminosity and the accretion state of the source .",
    "in analogy with bhxrbs , also in agn the high - frequency psd ( above the high - frequency break ) does not show any clear dependence on the luminosity / mass - accretion rate ( e.g. oneil et al . 2005 ; zhou et al .",
    "2010 ; ponti et al .",
    "+ in this paper we aim at investigating the evolution of the psd as a function of luminosity / mass - accretion rate , extending the analysis down to the soft x - ray energy band . for this reason , we study the hard - state psd of gx 339 - 4 , the best monitored bhxrbs .",
    "we used data collected with xmm - newton , and , in order to obtain a broad band coverage , we considered also simultaneous rxte observations .",

    "[ cols= \" < \" , ]      we now focus on the _ high - frequency _ psd of gx 339 - 4 ( between @xmath7 hz , i.e. above the peak of the high - frequency lorentzian ) . in the analysed datasets we observe that the peak of the high - frequency lorentzian varies with luminosity by a factor of @xmath01.6 ( sect . [",
    "sec : pfreq ] ) , as also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuvsl ] ( panel @xmath8 ) , where we plot @xmath9 as a function of @xmath10 ( note that @xmath11 is computed in the 3 - 30 kev range ) .",
    "a fit with a linear model in the log - log space returns a best - fit slope of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 , respectively in the _ soft _ , _ hard _ , and _ very hard _ band .",
    "we note that these slopes are consistent with being the same , but consistently and significantly different from a slope of 1 .",
    "however the _ soft _ band has a significantly lower intercept ( differing by a factor @xmath15 ) , this being a consequence of the energy - dependence of @xmath9 ( sect . [",
    "sec : pfreq ] ) .",
    "we also looked at the variations of the normalization of the psd at the peak - frequency of the high - frequency lorentzian ( @xmath16 , in units of @xmath17 ) as a function of luminosity .",
    "we derived @xmath16 and its related uncertainties ( at the 90 percent confidence level ) from the best - fit psd models .",
    "results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuvsl ] ( panel @xmath18 ) .",

    "[ fig : nuvsl ] , panel @xmath18 ) .",
    "these results point to the existence of an inverse - power scaling relation between @xmath16 and @xmath10 .",
    "once again we note a consistent behaviour between the _ hard _ , and _ very hard _ bands , and a significant deviation in the _ soft _ band .",
    "indeed , in the _ soft _ band this trend appears steeper than in the other bands .    finally , we computed the fractional _ rms _ in the @xmath7 hz frequency range .",
    "results are reported in table [ tab : rms ] and plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuvsl ] ( panel @xmath22 ) . despite the significant variations of the high - frequency lorentzian as a function of luminosity , the _ high - frequency _ fractional _ rms _ ( above the peak - frequency of the high - frequency lorentzian ) in",
    "the _ hard _ and _ very hard _ bands is consistent with being remarkably constant .",
    "this is due to the combined effect of the frequency shift _ and _ the decrease of normalization of the high - frequency psd with luminosity .",
    "these combined variations produce a constant _ high - frequency _ fractional _ rms_. indeed , fitting the data with a constant we measure a scatter around this best - fit value of @xmath3 and @xmath23 percent ( respectively in the _ hard _ and _ very hard _ band ) , i.e. of the order of the corresponding average uncertainty ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psd2 ] , middle and lower panel ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the constancy of the _ high - frequency _ fractional _ rms _ with luminosity breaks down in the _ soft _ energy band ( fig .",
    "[ fig : psd2 ] , upper panel ) . if fitted with a constant model , the increases to @xmath24 percent .",
    "instead , a fit with a linear model in the log - log space yields a best - fit slope of @xmath25 , and the scatter around the model is of @xmath0 3 percent .",
    "this is due to the fact that the normalization of the high - frequency psd decreases with luminosity faster in the _ soft _ band than at higher energies .",
    "in this paper we investigated the luminosity - dependence of the characteristic frequencies and variability power of gx 339 - 4 in the hard state .",
    "these properties have been extensively studied in the past , through the use of rxte data , which cover energies @xmath26 kev .",
    "our work aims at extending this analysis down to the _ soft _ x - ray energy band ( @xmath27 kev ) , where the contribution of the disc thermal emission becomes non - negligible . for this reason we used xmm - newton and simultaneous rxte observations , covering the energy band 0.5 - 30 kev .",
    "the selected observations belong to two different outbursts of the source . nonetheless , the variability properties of bhxrbs are extremely similar from outburst to outburst ( muoz - darias et al . 2011 , grinberg et al . 2014 ) , thus justifying our approach of considering observations taken during different activity periods .",
    "the drop of fractional _ rms _ that characterizes the transition from the hard to the soft state , is ascribed to the emergence of a disc component , which , in the soft state , is more intense and less variable ( with typical fractional _ rms _ values of few percents ) than the power law .",
    "the fractional _ rms _ spectrum is observed to change accordingly , from an `` inverted '' ( in the hard state ) to a `` hard '' ( in the soft state ) spectral shape .    extending our analysis of the hard - state variability properties of gx 339 - 4 down to the _ soft _ x - ray band , we observe a drop of fractional _ rms _ that correlates with the progressive increase of disc flux relative to the total flux in that band .",
    "this resembles the behaviour seen in soft states , although to a much lower extent ( indeed the disc fractional _ rms _ is much higher and the drop less intense than in soft states , see inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : rms ] ) , and is expected if the disc has lower fractional _ rms _ than the power law .",
    "this raises the question as to whether or not the disc in the hard state has similar timing properties as in the soft state .",
    "analysing the energy and covariance spectra of gx 339 - 4 , we observe intrinsic _ broad - frequency - band _ disc variability at all the luminosities spanned by the hard - state observations .",
    "the presence of a variable disc in a hard state observation ( corresponding to our medium luminosity observation ) was first reported by wilkinson & uttley ( 2009 ) .",
    "we detect high levels of disc variability ( @xmath28 percent ) in the three observations , comparable to the variability intrinsic to the power law component , and significantly higher than observed in soft states .",
    "however , the disc fractional _ rms _ decreases with luminosity faster than the power law fractional _",
    "rms_. at the same time , the fraction of _ soft _ band flux due to the disc ( power law ) component increases ( decreases ) with luminosity ( fig .",
    "[ fig : rms_vs_disc ] ) .",
    "the net effect is a strong increase ( a factor of @xmath04 ) of constant disc - flux fraction in the _ soft _ band , which causes the observed drop of fractional _",
    "rms_. it is worth noting that , without the contribution from the disc component , the fractional _ rms _ spectra always show an `` inverted '' shape ( as typically seen in the rxte data , e.g. belloni et al . 2011 ) , with variability power decreasing as a function of energy .",
    "we conclude that a relatively high fraction of disc flux is variable during the hard state of gx 339 - 4 . however , the increasing fraction of constant disc flux with luminosity in the _ soft _ band is responsible for the net drop of fractional _ rms _ as compared to power law - dominated energy bands .",
    "we argue that this trend continues throughout the outburst , thus leading to the disc being mostly constant during the soft state , and significantly different from the disc seen in hard states .",
    "a number of correlations link the _ high - frequency _ variability properties of bhxrbs and agn , suggesting that the dominant variability process at these frequencies is the same in both the classes of objects . in particular , considering a sample of 10 agn and 2 bhxrbs in the soft state , mchardy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) found a linear scaling of the high - frequency break ( a characteristic frequency of agn psds , edelson & nandra 1999 , commonly associated with @xmath9 in bhxrbs ) with the bh mass ( @xmath29 ) and the mass - accretion rate ( @xmath30 , i.e. normalized by the mass - accretion rate required to reach the eddington luminosity ) , which defines the so - called ` variability plane ' .",
    "koerding et al .",
    "( 2007 ) found a similar scaling relation also for sources in the hard state ( but offset with respect to the corresponding relation valid for soft - state sources ) .",
    "as a consequence , we would expect to observe @xmath9 scaling linearly with the mass - accretion rate also in the hard - state observations of gx 339 - 4 analysed in this paper .",
    "however , we see @xmath9 scaling with @xmath10 ( with @xmath31 ) , with an average slope of @xmath32 , therefore not consistent with the results by mchardy et al .",
    "( 2006 ) and koerding et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and @xmath33 , with @xmath34 , the exact value depending on the accretion efficiency of the flow ( fender & muoz - darias 2015 ) . ] .",
    "we note , however , that our result is in agreement with the recent estimate obtained from the psd analysis of a sample of 104 nearby agn observed with xmm - newton ( gonzalez - martin & vaughan , 2012 ) , which reports a best - fit slope of @xmath35 .",
    "this therefore suggests that , indeed , the same engine is at work in both agn and bhxrbs , but that the dependence of the _ high - frequency _ variability on luminosity / mass - accretion is significantly shallower than previously thought ( mchardy et al .",
    "2006 ; koerding et al .",
    "we also investigated the dependence of the normalization of the psd at the break , @xmath16 , on the luminosity .",
    "we find that @xmath16 decreases as a function of @xmath10 .",
    "interestingly , this trend can counterbalance the @xmath9 vs. @xmath10 scaling , producing the same _ high - frequency _ variability power at different luminosities .",
    "previous studies have pointed out that the _ high - frequency _ psd does not show a clear scaling with the luminosity / mass - accretion rate both in bhxrbs ( gierliski et al .",
    "2008 ) and agn ( oneil et al . 2005 ; zhou et al . 2010",
    "; ponti et al .",
    "we observe that the _ high - frequency _ fractional _ rms _ of gx 339 - 4 is constant in the _ hard _ and _ very hard _ band ( dominated by the hard x - ray comptonization continuum ) at any luminosity probed . in particular we find that this quantity has a small scatter ( @xmath36 percent , in agreement with results by muoz - darias et al .",
    "2011 and by heil , vaughan , & uttley 2012 ) in these two energy bands .",
    "the remarkable constancy of the _ high - frequency _ psd provides us with a tool to measure the bh mass of accreting objects ( nikoajuk et al .",

    "; kelly et al .",
    "2011 ; la franca et al .",

    "; ponti et al .",
    "2012 ) , while being independent of the mass - accretion rate , scales inversely with the bh mass , with a very small scatter ( which mostly depends on the uncertainty on @xmath29 ) , of the order of less than 0.2 - 0.4 dex ( e.g. oneill et al .",
    "2005 ; zhou et al .",
    "2010 ; ponti et al .",
    "2012 ; kelly et al .",
    "2011 ) .    as observed in sect .",
    "[ sec : scaling ] , the dependences of @xmath9 and @xmath16 are significantly different in the _ soft _ band . in particular , the constancy of the _ high - frequency _ fractional _ rms _ as a function of luminosity breaks down at low energies , with a scatter around the best - fit constant model increasing to @xmath0 30 percent .",
    "we ascribe this to the presence of the additional contribution from the disc component .",
    "interestingly the same behaviour is observed in agn .",
    "indeed , it is observed that the scatter in the relation between the short - time scale variability and the bh mass is larger in the optical band ( dominated by the disc emission ) than in the x - ray band ( dominated by the power law ) , and the optical variability of agn is significantly anticorrelated with the optical luminosity ( kelly et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    "the characteristic frequencies in the psd of accreting systems ( i.e. the peak - frequency of each lorentzian ) are likely related to fundamental time scales of the accretion flow at specific radii ( e.g. psaltis , belloni & van der klis 1999 ; churazov , gilfanov , & revnivtsev 2001 ; motta et al . 2014 ) .",
    "though not yet conclusive , the general picture that emerged over the years is that the low - frequency lorentzian in the hard state of bhxrbs is associated with a characteristic time scale ( most probably the viscous time scale ) at the inner edge of the accretion disc ( e.g. churazov et al .",
    "2001 ; done et al .",
    "according to recent studies , variations intrinsic to the seed - photons flux produce the long - time scale variability ( i.e. the low - frequency lorentzian ) observed in the _ soft _ energy band ( sect . [",
    "sec : spec ] ; wilkinson & uttley 2009 ; uttley et al .",
    "these variations are due to perturbations in the accretion rate , which travel inward and modulate the hard x - ray emission from the inner corona , thus producing the long - time scale variability observed also in harder energy bands ( e.g. lyubarskii 1997 ; kotov , churazov , & gilfanov 2001 ; arvalo & uttley 2006 ; ingram & van der klis 2013 ) .",
    "the existence of additional variability components at frequencies higher than those corresponding to the inner edge of the disc , can be explained provided the corona extends down to the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco , motta et al .",
    "2014 ) and is intrinsically variable on short time scales ( e.g. churazov , gilfanov , & revnivtsev 2001 ) .",
    "this inner hot flow / corona is thus responsible for producing the high - frequency lorentzian observed in _",
    "hard _ and _ very hard _ energy bands .",
    "+ such a high - frequency component is observed also in the _ soft _ band , and is linearly correlated with that in harder energy bands ( as seen from covariance spectra , light grey triangles in fig .",
    "[ fig : covar ] ; see also uttley et al .",
    "2011 ; de marco et al .",
    "we showed that the high - frequency lorentzian is significantly offset , by a factor of @xmath02 , towards lower frequencies in the _ soft _ band with respect to higher - energy bands .",
    "the covariance spectra ( light grey triangles in fig . [",
    "fig : covar ] ) show that the high - frequency psd contains significant contribution from variable disc emission , so the offset , _ soft _ band high - frequency lorentzian is likely linked to variability coming from the disc component .",
    "however , within the scenario depicted above , intrinsic disc variability due to accretion rate perturbations occurring on time scales shorter than the viscous time scale at the inner edge of the disc is expected to be highly suppressed .",
    "thus , a possible explanation is that this high - frequency variability is not intrinsic to the disc , but results from reprocessing of the short - time scale variable corona emission ( e.g. thermal reprocessing ; wilkinson & uttley 2009 ; uttley et al .",
    "2011 ; de marco et al .",
    "in standard disc - corona geometries , the hard x - rays would irradiate a relatively _ extended _ region of the disc .",
    "thus , the reprocessing region would act as a low - pass filter , damping the high - frequency variability power in the _ soft _ band ( e.g. arvalo & uttley 2006 ; uttley et al . 2014 ) . as a consequence the _ soft _ band high - frequency lorentzian would be narrower , and its peak - frequency",
    "would result slightly shifted towards low frequencies with respect to the corresponding peak in harder energy bands .",
    "this resembles the behaviour observed in the data of gx 339 - 4 . according to this interpretation ,",
    "the relative offset of the peak - frequency of the high - frequency lorentzian in the different bands should trace the variations of the geometry of the accretion disc / corona during the outburst .",

    "<S> we report on the analysis of hard - state power spectral density function ( psd ) of gx 339 - 4 down to the _ soft _ x - ray band , where the disc significantly contributes to the total emission . at any </S>",
    "<S> luminosity probed , the disc in the hard state is intrinsically more variable than in the soft state . however , the fast decrease of disc variability as a function of luminosity , combined with the increase of disc intensity , causes a net drop of fractional variability at high luminosities and low energies , which reminds the well - known behaviour of disc - dominated energy bands in the soft state . the peak - frequency of the high - frequency lorentzian ( likely corresponding to the high - frequency break seen in active galactic nuclei , agn ) scales with luminosity , but we do not find evidence for a linear scaling . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we observe that this characteristic frequency is energy - dependent . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the normalization of the psd at the peak of the high - frequency lorentzian decreases with luminosity at all energies , though in the _ soft _ band this trend is steeper . </S>",
    "<S> together with the frequency shift , this yields quasi - constant _ high frequency _ ( 5 - 20 hz ) fractional _ rms _ at high energies , with less than 10 percent scatter . </S>",
    "<S> this reinforces previous claims suggesting that the _ high frequency _ psd solely scales with bh mass . on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> this constancy breaks down in the _ soft _ band ( where the scatter increases to @xmath0 30 percent ) . </S>",
    "<S> this is a consequence of the additional contribution from the disc component , and resembles the behaviour of optical variability in agn .    </S>",
