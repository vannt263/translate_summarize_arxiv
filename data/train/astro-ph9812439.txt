    "we search for chemically distinct stellar nuclei in disk galaxies for several years , and this search has been successful : chemically distinct nuclei are found in a dozen of disk galaxies ( @xcite ) . from the beginning we tried to find a relation between the presence of chemically distinct nuclei and the galactic structure . at first",
    "we have noticed that isophote twist is absent , as a rule , in the galaxies with chemically distinct nuclei ( @xcite ) ; so we have associated the chemically distinct nuclei with central mass concentrations within axisymmetric bulges and have thought them to be the result of the internal evolution .",
    "but later some arguments have been accumulated that the presence of chemically decoupled nucleus is often accompanied by kinematically decoupled gaseous subsystems , such as polar rings , so it may be a consequence of a past interaction with some gas accretion and subsequent secondary star formation burst in the nucleus ( @xcite ) .",
    "the chemically distinct nuclei in elliptical galaxies are more widely known , and their presence is often related to nuclear compact stellar disks within main galactic bodies .",
    "bender and surma ( @xcite ) reported the discovery of a magnesium index enhancement in dynamically decoupled cores of four elliptical galaxies .",
    "since they deal with dynamically hot elliptical galaxies , the chemically decoupled cores have been easily identified as being disks from dynamical arguments , namely , from their fast rotation and , in two cases , from a slight decrease of stellar velocity dispersion toward the centers .",
    "later for two galaxies a photometric study has confirmed the presence of the nuclear stellar disks with appropriate sizes ( ngc  5322 : @xcite ; ngc  4365 : @xcite ) .",
    "recently another two elliptical galaxies , ngc  4816 and ic  4051 in the coma cluster , were found to possess chemically ( and kinematically ) distinct cores which are in fact central stellar disks ( @xcite ) .",
    "the hypothesis that the kinematically and chemically distinct cores in elliptical galaxies are nuclear stellar disks formed via dissipational major merger events has become popular .",
    "however one must admit that there exists alternative points of view : carollo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who used the hst wpfc2 data have not found any nuclear disks in the elliptical galaxies with kinematically and chemically distinct cores ngc  2434 and ngc  7192 and have concluded that magnesium - rich cores `` may arise from a large variety of morphological and dynamical structures '' .",
    "spiral galaxies were studied less thoroughly , but we know one example which was considered in detail .",
    "it is ngc  4594 , which has been investigated both spectroscopically and photometrically more than once .",
    "particularly , results of bidimensional spectroscopy presented by emsellem et al .",
    "( @xcite ) are of great interest for us in the frame of our topic .",
    "ngc  4594 has an inner disk with the radius of 11which is disconnected to the more outer main disk of the galaxy  this was already shown by burkhead ( @xcite ) .",
    "two - dimensional maps of absorption - line indices mgb , fe5270 , fe5335 , and fe5406 obtained by emsellem et al .",
    "( @xcite ) have revealed the presence of a chemically distinct nucleus in ngc  4594 ; but , interestingly , the magnesium - index difference between the nucleus and the inner disk is smaller by a factor of 2 than the corresponding difference between the nucleus and the bulge ( along the minor axis ) , and there are no difference of iron indices between the nucleus and the inner disk . in some sense ,",
    "just the inner disk in ngc  4594 represents a chemically distinct core .",
    "so , we suspect that the presence of chemically distinct nuclei in spiral galaxies may be related to their inner stellar disks ; may be , it is the same thing .",
    "but the sample of spiral galaxies with decoupled circumnuclear stellar disks is not larger ( perhaps , even smaller ) than the sample of spiral galaxies with chemically distinct nuclei .",
    "an alternative starting point is proposed by a recent work of rubin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) who have reported the discovery of 14 rapidly rotating , discrete circumnuclear _",
    "gaseous _ disks in virgo cluster spiral galaxies . among those ,",
    "ngc  4216 possesses one of the most extended solid - body rotating circumnuclear gaseous disks : rubin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) give its radius equal to 10  ( or 800 pc ) and its angular rotation velocity equal to 28 km / s / arcsec , or 350 km / s / kpc .",
    "since ngc  4216 is also included into our list of candidates for possessing a chemically distinct nucleus ( @xcite ) , we think it to be an appropriate object which may contain a distinct nuclear _",
    "stellar _ disk ; due to the large extension of the circumnuclear gaseous disk , the stellar disk may be also large enough and so may be resolved under moderate seeing conditions .",
    "another virgo spiral , ngc  4501 , is not mentioned by rubin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) as having a circumnuclear gaseous disk ; moreover , keel ( @xcite ) stated that its central emission is confined to the nucleus and does not show any disk structure .",
    "but it is also in our list of candidates for possessing a chemically distinct nucleus ( @xcite ) , and we have decided to study it more carefully together with ngc  4216 .",
    "we have undertaken bidimensional spectroscopy of the central parts of these galaxies .",
    "section  2 describes the details of our spectral observations and of other observational data involved into our analysis . in section  3",
    "we discuss the morphology of surface brightness distributions in ngc  4216 and ngc  4501 .",

    "the slit , with a length of @xmath14 and a width of 2 , has been set in three position angles : along the major axis , along the minor axis , and between them , at @xmath15 from the major axis .",
    "we exposed a red spectral range containing strong emission lines h@xmath16 and [ nii]@xmath17 and derived line - of - sight velocities of the ionized gas along the slit by measuring barycenters of these emission lines .",
    "the dispersion was 1.56   per pixel , and the spectral resolution varied along the slit between 3.2 and 3.9  .",
    "test measurements of the sky emission line [ oi]@xmath18 have shown that the accuracy of our line - of - sight velocity measurements is 6 - 8 km / s . in the center where the emission lines are especially strong",

    "the more detailed spectral investigation of the innermost parts of ngc  4216 and ngc  4501 has been undertaken with the multi - pupil field spectrograph ( mpfs ) of the 6 m telescope ( for description of the early variant of the mpfs ",

    "we used two different setups . in may 1996 and in january 1998 a ccd of @xmath21 was in work ; we exposed an area of @xmath22 elements ( @xmath23 ) with a dispersion of 1.61.7    per pixel ( spectral resolution being 35   ) . in may 1997 a ccd of @xmath24 was operated , and we exposed an area of @xmath25 elements ( @xmath26 ) with a dispersion of 0.9    per pixel and a spectral resolution of 1.5   . as a rule ,",
    "we observe two spectral ranges : green , 47005400  , containing strong absorption lines h@xmath0 , mgib , fei@xmath27 and 5335 , and red , 62006900  , containing strong emission lines , h@xmath16 and [ nii]@xmath17 .",
    "the green spectral range is used to derive radial profiles of the absorption - line indices mgb , fe5270 , fe5335 , and h@xmath0 calculated in the well - known lick system ( @xcite ) ; to keep nearly constant signal - to - noise ratio along the radius , we have integrated the spectra in concentric circular rings with a width equal to one element ( @xmath28 ) which are centered onto a galactic nucleus ( for highly flattened systems , such as ngc  4216 , this procedure results in smoothing details of the radial profiles ) .",
    "also , we use the green spectral range to construct velocity fields of the stellar components ; for this purpose we cross - correlate every galactic elementary spectrum with a spectrum of a bright star , typically k0k3 iii , obtained with the same instrumental setup .",
    "the emission lines in the red spectral range are measured to construct velocity fields of the ionized gas .",
    "we estimate the typical accuracy of the absorption - line indices to be 0.1    and an intrinsic velocity accuracy @xmath29 km / s .    to study in detail the morphology of the central parts of ngc  4216 and 4501 , we have used a collection of digital images of 113 galaxies presented by frei et al .",

    "fig .  1 presents mpfs maps of the central parts of ngc  4216 and 4501 in the continuum and in the emission line [ nii]@xmath436583 .",
    "it is clearly seen that in the center of ngc  4216 the emission - line morphology matches the continuum morphology , and the ionized gas distribution is similar to the distribution of stars .",
    "we agree with keel ( @xcite ) who characterized the emission distribution in the center of ngc  4216 as a gaseous disk .",
    "emission morphology in the center of ngc  4501 is less obvious , but we state that it is not point - like as keel ( @xcite ) reported .",
    "we see an extended circumnuclear gaseous structure , but indeed the emission isophote shape in the center of ngc  4501 is more roundish than that of the continuum isophotes .",
    "moreover , it lacks an axial symmetry : the northern part of this structure is fainter than the southern part . in other words ,",
    "the observed morphology of the emission - line distribution in the center of ngc  4501 does not allow us to determine the spatial structure of the gaseous subsystem ; it differs from the stellar distribution , although the kinematics of the ionized gas and stars in the center of ngc  4501 are quite similar ( see the next section ) .      figs .",
    "23 present some results of the isophote analysis using the central parts of the broad - band images of both galaxies . here , together with our results ,",
    "we plot k - band isophote characteristics from the work of rauscher ( @xcite )  it is important for such dusty regions as the centers of ngc  4216 and 4501 . in ngc  4216 there is no isophote major axis twist : a slight increase of @xmath44 toward the center according to the data of frei et al .",
    "( @xcite ) is not confirmed by the results of rauscher ( @xcite ) in the radius range of 1.53 .",
    "but other important features are evident : a local maximum of ellipticity at @xmath45 and highly positive ( particularly in the bluer filters ) values of the fourth cosine fourier coefficient @xmath46 at @xmath47 .",
    "the bulge subtracted photometric residual maps clearly show a highly inclined nuclear stellar disk with a radius of @xmath481011  which lies exactly in the plane of the main galactic disk .",
    "rubin et al . (",
    "@xcite ) mentioned a weak bar in ngc  4216 .",
    "but if it exists , it must lie outside the radius range under consideration ; in the central part of ngc  4216 no bar signatures are detected : edge - on bars look usually boxy , and in ngc  4216 within @xmath49 there are no areas of negative @xmath46 .",
    "the edge of the nuclear stellar disk at @xmath50 can also be seen on the @xmath51-band surface brightness profile given for ngc  4216 in the work of jungwiert et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "jungwiert et al .",
    "( @xcite ) looked for bars , either single or double , in disk galaxies ; for this purpose they have made near - ir 2d photometry of 72 nearby galaxies and have analysed morphological characteristics of isophotes after deprojection of the images onto the galactic planes .",
    "ngc  4216 was not deprojected because of its large inclination , we could consider only the observed profiles . however ngc  4501 was done , and jungwiert et al .",
    "( @xcite ) concluded that in this galaxy there are no `` bar or other triaxiality '' , and slight oscillations of morphological characteristics near @xmath52 are caused by spiral arms .",
    "carollo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) do not analyse their hst image of ngc  4501 because of multiple spiral arms penetrating into the very center of the galaxy .",
    "we have attempted to do this ; together with the image characteristics derived from the frei s et al .",
    "( @xcite ) data and the results of rauscher ( @xcite ) , the morphological characteristics of the isophotes of the hst wfpc2 image allow to make more detailed conclusions about the structure of the center of ngc  4501 . the apparent ellipticity reaches a maximum value corresponding to a thin disk inclined by @xmath53 , namely , @xmath54=0.5 , already at @xmath55 , in the bulge - dominated region . besides , the fourth cosine fourier coefficient @xmath46 is always positive within @xmath56 according to the hst data and within @xmath57 according to the data of frei et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and becomes negative outside this zone .",
    "oscillations of @xmath44 plus - minus @xmath58 from the line of nodes , seen even in the k - band , are more than probable within the zone of strong @xmath46 variations .",
    "so we detect morphological signatures of a circumnuclear stellar disk inside a radius of 10  and a slightly triaxial bulge dominating outside . as for nuclear `` dust '' spirals , they are clearly seen in the residual hst image of ngc  4501 obtained by subtracting a model image consisting of pure elliptical isophotes ( fig .",
    "however , together with the `` dark '' spirals , `` luminous '' spirals are seen too .",
    "perhaps , the sw , more luminous , arm causes the asymmetry visible in the emission - line image of the center of ngc  4501 ( fig .  1 ) .",
    "rotation of the stellar components in ngc  4216 and ngc  4501 has not yet been studied .",
    "we have obtained two - dimensional velocity fields of stars for the central regions of @xmath26 of both galaxies by using the green spectral range data from mpfs .",
    "they are shown in fig .",
    "first of all , two - dimensional velocity fields allow us to check if the rotation of stars is axisymmetric and if the plane of rotation coincides with the main plane of the galactic disk .",
    "when we have a disk which density ( brightness ) distribution and rotation are axisymmetric , the azimuthal dependence of the central line - of - sight velocity gradients must follow a cosine law within the solid - body rotation radius : + @xmath59 sin @xmath32 cos @xmath60 , + where @xmath61 is the deprojected angular rotation velocity , @xmath32 is the inclination of the rotation plane , and @xmath62 is the orientation of the line of nodes . since the axisymmetric disk is round ,",
    "the line of nodes is aligned with the isophotes .",
    "so if the maximum of the cosine - like azimuthal dependence of the central line - of - sight velocity gradients stays at the photometric major axis orientation , it strongly hints for an axisymmetric rotation .",
    "6 presents the azimuthal dependence of the central line - of - sight velocity gradients for ngc  4216 ; it is cosine - like .",
    "table  2 contains parameters of the best - fitting cosinusoid calculated by the least - square method .",
    "one can see that the orientation of the kinematical major axis is @xmath63 .",
    "the orientation of the main major axis of the galaxy was known to be @xmath64 ( rc3 ) .",
    "we have obtained from the morphological analysis in the previous section that the outermost isophotes have @xmath65 and that the isophote orientation in the center is practically the same .",
    "so we conclude that the stars in the center of ngc  4216 exhibit axisymmetric rotation . taking into account that the galaxy is seen at an inclination of @xmath66 ( @xcite )",
    ", we estimate the mean central angular rotation velocity as 28 km / s / arcsec ( or 350 km / s / kpc ) .",

    "they are also cosine - like .",
    "table  3 contains the parameters of the best - fitting cosinusoids .",
    "first of all , one can see that beyond @xmath72 the cosine amplitude drops ; that means that @xmath72 is the border of the solid - body rotation region . within @xmath72",
    "the mean value of @xmath62 is @xmath73 which is not too different from the line - of - nodes orientation of @xmath74 ( rc3 ; our isophote analysis gave us @xmath75 ) .",
    "therefore we classify the rotation of the stellar component in the center of ngc  4501 as axisymmetric too .",
    "it implies that the angular velocity is @xmath76 km / s / arcsec ( or 383 km / s / kpc ) assuming @xmath77 .    assuming that the rotation of stars in the centers of ngc  4216 and ngc  4501 is axisymmetric , we have calculated azimuthally averaged rotation curves in the frame of the circular rotation model .",
    "they are presented in fig .",
    "the parameters @xmath32 and @xmath62 were determined by fitting the model to the whole velocity fields .",
    "so for ngc  4501 , the value of @xmath62 is slightly different from that found by the cosinusoid analysis within the solid - body rotation area .",
    "however , this value of @xmath62 is even closer to the main line of nodes .",
    "one can see that in fig .",
    "8 the region of solid - body rotation in ngc  4216 extends to @xmath78 , just the same as the radius of the circumnuclear gaseous disk ( rubin et al .",
    "@xcite ) ; so the central part of ngc  4216 is kinematically decoupled from the more outer part of the galaxy .",
    "the radius of the solid - body rotation region in ngc  4501 is @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "the local maximum rotation velocity of @xmath48 130 km / s at @xmath79 is followed by a slight velocity decrease .",
    "so we conclude that inside the radius of the kinematically distinct core in ngc  4501 , 4  or 320 pc , the mass is approximately @xmath80  a quite typical value for the kinematically distinct cores in spiral galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "the rotation of the ionized gas in ngc  4216 and ngc  4501 was studied more than once .",
    "we can mention the works of rubin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and woods et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "these studies are fully based on long - slit spectra taken along the major axes ; besides , they were intended to obtain large - scale , extended rotation velocity distributions , so their spatial resolution was rather low : rubin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) used a spatial binning of @xmath81 per pixel , and woods et al .",
    "( @xcite ) observed under the seeing conditions of @xmath82 .",
    "such an approach has allowed rubin with co - authors to find a kinematically distinct circumnuclear gaseous disk with a radius of 10  in ngc  4216 ( rubin et al .",
    "@xcite ) , but a much more compact kinematically distinct core in ngc  4501 was not noticed .    for the first time we present two - dimensional velocity fields of the ionized gas in the centers of ngc  4216 and 4501 ( fig .  9 ) . if the gas velocity field for ngc  4501 looks quite regular and reminds us of the stellar component velocity field ( fig .",
    "5b ) , the gas velocity field in the center of ngc  4216 is somewhat asymmetric .",
    "taking into account that the galaxy is highly inclined and that we see the circumnuclear gaseous disk almost edge - on , we now wish to further study the gas rotation using the major - axis velocity measurements . for this purpose",
    "we have simulated `` long - slit cross - section '' by superposing a slit - like mask @xmath83 on the two - dimensional velocity field .",

    "but in general , this line - of - sight velocity profile does not look regular .",
    "for the ne part the agreement is better , but rubin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) noted emission - line splitting at some radii .",
    "to the south - west from the nucleus the splitting was not noticed , but all three measurements diverge at @xmath85 , implying that there may be some spatial sharp variations of the line - of - sight velocity pattern .",
    "kuijken and merrifield ( @xcite ) have simulated kinematical signatures of bars from edge - on to end - on ; they have concluded that losvds both of gas and stars ( under the assumption of smooth spatial gas and star density distributions ) must demonstrate gaps at some velocities giving a characteristic `` figure - of - eight '' picture .",
    "we have checked emission - line profiles ( for the strongest emission line [ nii]@xmath436583 ) along the major axis of ngc  4216 . with our spectral resolution , 1.5  or 75 km / s ,",
    "we clearly see losvd asymmetry with a long tail toward systemic velocity which is characteristic of the axisymmetric plane rotation seen almost edge - on ; but we do not see any gaps in the profiles .",
    "so we conclude that there are no kinematical signatures of a bar within @xmath86 in ngc  4216  this conclusion is consistent with the results of morphological analysis presented in the previous section .",
    "the irregular shape of the major - axis velocity profile may be a consequence of a patchy dust distribution ; some north - south asymmetry is also seen in the emission - line brightness map ( fig .",
    "an additional argument in favor of axisymmetric gas rotation in the center of ngc  4216 is the full agreement between the angular gas rotation velocity  28 km / s / arcsec  reported by rubin et al .",

    "the parameters of fitted cosinusoids are given in table  4 .",
    "first of all , one can see that the amplitude of the cosinusoids drops noticeably beyond @xmath88 : it is the border of the solid - body rotating gaseous disk .",
    "the data of may 1996 and january 1998 are in agreement , and to determine parameters of the nuclear gas rotation , we involve measurements of [ nii]@xmath436583 in 1996 and of [ nii]@xmath436583 , h@xmath16 , and [ sii]@xmath436717 in 1998 .",
    "the orientation of the dynamical major axis for the ring of @xmath89@xmath90 is @xmath62=@xmath91 ; it suggests that the rotation is axisymmetric , because the orientation of the main line of nodes is @xmath92 ( rc3 ) or @xmath75 ( our analysis ) .",
    "the averaged angular rotation velocity is @xmath76 km / s/ \" ( or @xmath93 km / s / kpc ) if we assume the inclination to be @xmath53 .",
    "we see that in the center of ngc  4501 both stars and ionized gas rotate axisymmetrically , in the equatorial plane of the galaxy , and with the same angular speed .",

    "( @xcite ) and by woods et al .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "one can note that along the minor axis there is no velocity gradient near the center of ngc  4501 ; this is one more evidence for axisymmetric rotation of the circumnuclear ionized gas in ngc  4501 .",
    "13 shows the rotation curve for the ionized gas in the center of ngc  4501 , both the azimuthally averaged one constructed from the two - dimensional mpfs data in the frame of an axisymmetric - rotation model and the one derived from the linear long - slit cross - sections .",
    "up to @xmath88 the mpfs and long - slit rotation curves agree perfectly despite very different spatial resolution ( seeing conditions ) of two data sets , @xmath28 for the long - slit data and @xmath94 for the mpfs data . but beyond @xmath72 two branches of the long - slit major - axis cross - sections diverge extremely . by modelling the one - dimensional major - axis cross - section from the two - dimensional mpfs velocity field ,",
    "we have obtained the same asymmetry .",
    "the azimuthally averaged mpfs rotation curve lies between these two branches , just as one could expect .",
    "the gaseous disk thus seems strongly asymmetric : perhaps , to the south - east from the center at @xmath95 we see the circumnuclear disk , and to the north - west  something else ( dust screen ? ) that hides the nw part of the circumnuclear disk .",
    "if so , we must take into account only the se branch of the major - axis cross - section , then the local maximum of the gas rotation velocity shifts to @xmath96 , and the gaseous circumnuclear disk in ngc  4501 appears to be more extended that we thought before .",
    "figs .  14 and 15 present the radial profiles of the absorption - line indices for ngc  4216 and ngc  4501 , respectively .",
    "these profiles give us the evidence for a chemical distinctness of the nuclei in both galaxies : one can see a drop of metal - line equivalent widths when passing from the nuclei to the bulges . in the bulges which we take safely at @xmath97 (",
    "let us remind that seeing quality was @xmath98 ) there are no noticeable gradients of metal - line indices , so we average the values in the radius range of 49 .",
    "now we can make quantitative estimates of differences in stellar populations properties by using models for old stellar populations . in ngc  4216",
    "the mean metal - line indices in the bulge are @xmath99   and @xmath100   ( @xmath101 ( fe5270+fe5335)/2 ) ; so the differences `` nucleus  minus  bulge '' are @xmath102 and @xmath103  .",
    "if we assume equal ages of the nuclear and bulge stellar populations and if magnesium - to - iron ratio is solar , then by using the models of worthey ( @xcite ) we obtain @xmath104[fe / h]=@xmath105 from @xmath104mgb and @xmath104[fe / h]=@xmath106 from @xmath107 . the difference between these estimates suggests a possible difference between magnesium - to - iron ratios in the nucleus and in the bulge .",
    "before we make analogous calculations for ngc  4501 , let us note that in the nucleus of ngc  4501 ( @xmath108 ) a quite measurable emission line [ ni]@xmath435199 is seen in the spectra . as this line contaminates the red continuum passband of the mgb index , its presence results in a mgb overestimate .",
    "the effect has been discussed and quantified by goudfrooij & emsellem ( @xcite ) ; we apply their recommended correction , 1.13ew([ni])=0.45   , to our nuclear mgb measurement . after this correction ,",
    "the bulge characteristics being @xmath109   and @xmath110 ( according to the measurements of may 1997 ) , we obtain the index differences @xmath111   and @xmath112   and , under the same assumptions as for ngc  4216 , the metallicity difference @xmath113 from @xmath104mgb and @xmath114 from @xmath104fe5270 . although the emission spectra of the nuclei of ngc  4216 and ngc  4501 are quite different , the properties of the stellar populations both in the nuclei and in the bulges appear to be very similar .",
    "but two main assumptions , that of equal ages and that of solar mg - to - fe ratio both in the nuclei and in the bulges , which allow to use the models of worthey ( @xcite ) , are not necessarily valid .",
    "let us try to clarify the situation in ngc  4216 and ngc  4501 .",
    "for this purpose we can use `` index - index '' diagrams ; but to refer to these diagrams , we need absolute values of the indices in the lick system .",
    "our spectral resolution in may 1997 was 1.5     much better than that of the lick system ( 8   ) .",
    "so we may expect that our index measurements in may 1997 are overestimated .",
    "indeed , the differences between the measurements of ngc  4501 in may 1997 and in may 1996 have the right sense ( fig .",
    "15 ) . to check this effect , we observed bright stars ( 4 stars  in may 1997 , resolution 1.5 , 9 stars ",
    "later , resolution 4 ) from the lick library ( @xcite ) .",
    "we have found that with the higher spectral resolution we overestimate the values of mgb by 0.50  and the values of fe5270 by 0.44   ; with our standard resolution , which was used in may 1996 , the measured index values for the stars coincide with tabular ones within the errors of individual observations in the lick project .",
    "interestingly , just the same differences , 0.40.5   , can be seen between the may 1996 and the may1997 measurements in fig .",
    "15 , so we conclude that the corrections cited above must only be applied to the measurements of may 1997 to transform them into the lick system .    fig",
    ".  16 presents the diagrams ( fe5270 , mgb ) for the central parts of ngc  4216 and ngc  4501 .",
    "one can see that these giant spiral galaxies differ strongly from a bulk of giant ellipticals on this diagram : if the latters lie to the right from the model sequences [ mg / fe]=0 ( @xcite ) , the measurements for the nuclei and bulges of ngc  4216 and ngc  4501 lie close to them .",
    "the nucleus of ngc  4216 has obviously solar magnesium - to - iron ratio , the bulge may be slightly magnesium - overabundant . in ngc  4501 , after applying the correction for the [ ni ] emission to the circumnuclear mgb indices , both the nucleus and the bulge seem to lie close to worthey s ( @xcite ) model sequences calculated for [ mg / fe]=0 .",
    "as the assumption of solar magnesium - to - iron ratio appears to be valid for the central parts of ngc  4216 and 4501 , we can try to separate metallicity and age effects on the diagrams ( h@xmath0 , mgb ) , ( h@xmath0 , [ mgfe ] ) ( [ mgfe]@xmath115 ) , or ( h@xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "unfortunately the absorption line h@xmath0 in the center of ngc  4501 is strongly contaminated by emission .",
    "but in the center of ngc  4216 the emission @xmath116 is practically absent  its equivalent width is less than 0.1   ,  and we can estimate an age of the stellar population in the nucleus and its environment . fig .",
    "17 presents the comparison of our index data for the center of ngc  4216 with the models of worthey ( @xcite ) on the diagrams ( h@xmath0 , mgb ) and ( h@xmath0 , [ mgfe ] ) and with the models of tantalo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for [ mg / fe]=0 on the diagram ( h@xmath0 , @xmath1 ) .",
    "different metal absorption - line indices and different models give a stable result : the stars in the nucleus of ngc  4216 have a mean age of 8 - 12 billion years and a mean metallicity of @xmath117 , the stars in the bulge are older than 1517 billion years and more metal - poor than the sun .",
    "so the chemically distinct nucleus in ngc  4216 is also younger than the nearest bulge . as for quantitative self - consistent estimates of the parameter differences",
    ", we can use recommendations of tantalo et al .",
    "( @xcite ) : they give linear equations which connect index differences @xmath118 , @xmath107 , and @xmath119 with the stellar population parameter differences @xmath120 , @xmath104[mg / fe ] , and @xmath121",
    ". assuming @xmath104mgb=16.2@xmath118 , we obtain for ngc  4216 : @xmath104[mg / fe]=-0.12 , @xmath122=+0.48 , and @xmath123=-0.39 .",
    "if we take the direct @xmath124 determinations from our spectra for the nucleus and for the bulge of ngc  4216 according to the prescriptions of worthey et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , we obtain @xmath104[mg / fe]=-0.04 , @xmath122=+0.49 , and @xmath123=-0.30 , quite in agreement with the former results .",
    "so one can see that magnesium overabundance in the bulge is very modest , not more than 0.1 dex , the nucleus is younger than the bulge by a factor of 22.5 , and , after taking into account the age difference , the nucleus is more metal - rich than the bulge by a factor of 3 instead of the factor of 2 obtained under the assumption of equal ages .",
    "by using bidimensional spectral data obtained at the 6 m telescope for the virgo spirals ngc  4216 and ngc  4501 , we have found chemically distinct metal - rich nuclei in these galaxies . under the assumption of equal ages for the nuclear and bulge stellar populations ,",
    "the metallicity difference between the nuclei and their environments in the galaxies is estimated as a factor of 2 .",
    "but we have also found an age difference between the nucleus and the bulge in ngc  4216 : age - metallicity disentangling results in an age estimate for the nucleus of 812 billion years , the bulge being older by a factor of 1.52 ; and the self - consistent metallicity difference estimate is then a factor of 3 .",
    "the solar magnesium - to - iron ratios in the galactic nuclei suggest for a long duration of the secondary nuclear star formation bursts which have produced the chemically distinct stellar subsystems .",
    "the detailed morphological and kinematical analyses made for the stellar and gaseous structures in the centers of ngc  4216 and 4501 have revealed the presence of the circumnuclear stellar - gaseous disks which exhibit fast axisymmetric rotation and lie in their respective equatorial planes of the main galactic disks .",
    "the radius of the circumnuclear disk in ngc  4216 is 10(800 pc ) , and this value agrees with the estimate of rubin et al .",
    "( @xcite ) made for the purely gaseous inner disk .",
    "the inner disk radius in ngc  4501 can only be roughly estimated in the range 47due to the complex dust distribution in the central part of the galaxy . unlike the elliptical galaxies with chemically distinct cores where area of magnesium - index variations coincides with the inner - disk extensions ( @xcite ) , the chemically distinct nuclei in ngc  4216 and 4501 seem to be unresolved although the inner disks have quite measurable extensions .",
    "this work presents the second evidence of this sort ; the first was the case of m  31 ( @xcite ) , but it looked more striking  a circumnuclear 100 pc stellar disk in this galaxy extends up to @xmath125 from the center , and the chemically distinct nucleus is much more compact , less than 4 .",
    "one may note that the inner disks contribute less than 20%  of the total light in the bulge - dominated areas so they can not affect significantly the integrated spectra of the stellar populations .",
    "but in the elliptical galaxies the situation is similar , meanwhile the disks are detectable by their magnesium - enhanced contributions . in any case , the unresolved chemically distinct nuclei in spiral galaxies represent something different from the inner disks , though there may exist some genetic relation between these two substructures .",
