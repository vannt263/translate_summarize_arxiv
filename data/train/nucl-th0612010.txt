    "the large collective flow observed at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) have revitalized interest in relativistic hydrodynamics for nuclear collisions @xcite .",
    "numerical approaches for solving non - relativistic equations can be divided into numerous categories .",
    "information regarding the densities and collective velocities might be stored for static mesh points ( eulerian ) , or for mesh points that move with the fluid ( lagrangian ) .",
    "other approaches discard the notion of a mesh and instead follow the motion of particles which represent fluid elements @xcite , thus making the solution similar to that of molecular dynamics . adding viscosity and heat conduction brings about an even wider range of approaches .",
    "for instance , once heat diffusion is introduced one must choose whether the velocity refers to that of the energy @xcite ( landau frame ) or that of the number density @xcite ( eckart frame ) , or even of the entropy density @xcite .",
    "in addition to specifying the character of the mesh and the equations , there exist innumerable algorithms .",
    "relativistic modeling involves another class of choices , as there may be good reasons to consider meshes where information is not stored for a space - time hyper - surface defined by a fixed cartesian time , but rather for some alternately defined hyper - surfaces . for instance , cosmological modeling might use the proper time , i.e. , the time as measured by a local observer . for relativistic collision , where there is semi - hubble - like flow along the @xmath0-axis",
    ", one might use the hwo - bjorken time @xcite , @xmath1 , which is the time as measured by an observer moving with constant velocity @xmath2 .",
    "if the matter accelerates along the @xmath0 axis , this time would differ from the time measured by an observer moving with the fluid .",
    "once the fluid velocities significantly differ from that of the mesh , relativistic effects become important .    in this study",
    "we investigate the prospects of propagating so that after each point @xmath3 moves forward by @xmath4 , the hyper - surface will satisfy local simultaneity , @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the differential distance between neighboring points on the hyper - surface , and @xmath7 is the four - velocity , where in the frame of fluid @xmath8 .",
    "thus , in the frame of the fluid the time difference @xmath9 between neighboring mesh points is zero .",
    "after presenting the equations of motion that preserve local simultaneity in the next section , we present analytic solutions in these coordinates in the next two solutions .",
    "the first solution is for a gaussian - shaped entropy distribution that is initially at rest , while the second is a restatement of the khalatnikov - landau solution for matter leaving a static shock @xcite .",
    "both solutions are for the particular case of purely one - dimensional motion with a constant speed of sound .",
    "[ sec : comparison ] explores the manifestations of longitudinal acceleration and compares the analytic gaussian case with a numerical solution for the case with initial collective flow given by the hwa - bjorken velocity profile , @xmath10 .",
    "in particular , the degree to which the velocity gradient differs from @xmath11 is discussed for its importance in affecting conclusions about lifetime from two - particle correlations .",
    "the prospects and limitations for these approaches are reviewed in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] , after which an appendix is included reviewing other analytic solutions to relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "here , we express the equations for relativistic hydrodynamics in terms of coordinates relevant for a set of observers traveling with the fluid .",
    "each observer initializes his clock so that , in each observer s frame , evolution will begin simultaneously for the neighboring observers .",
    "such is the case for the commonly used hwa - bjorken assumption @xcite , where the collective velocity is given by @xmath12 , with @xmath13 being the proper time , i.e. , the time measured by each observer in their frame . in the hwa - bjorken picture",
    ", there is no acceleration and local simultaneity ( @xmath14 ) is preserved if each co - moving observer propagates forward equal amounts in proper time . however , as will be shown here , simultaneity will not be maintained in the presence of acceleration . for accelerating cases , each co - moving observer must propagate forward by different time steps .",
    "the equations of motion for a relativistic hydrodynamic fluid conserving entropy are : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the entropy density as measured by a co - mover . throughout this section , we ignore the general case where other currents are conserved , thus making @xmath17 a function of @xmath16 only . for a specific differential fluid element , an observer moving in the frame of the fluid observes a change in the velocity and entropy density , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the differential time step and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the position and velocity measured by an observer moving with the same velocity as the matter .",
    "the equations of motion can be integrated forward numerically on a lagrangian mesh , one that moves with the fluid , by solving for the time development of the separation between neighboring mesh points , @xmath22 , and the relative velocity of the two points , @xmath23 , where @xmath22 and @xmath24 are always measured by an observer traveling with the fluid between the two mesh points .",
    "since the velocities are , by definition , small according to this observer , the motion appears non - relativistic . after solving for the non - relativistic evolution of @xmath24 and @xmath22",
    ", one could perform incremental relativistic velocity additions and lorentz transformations to solve for the relativistic evolution .",
    "thus , it would appear that relativistic complications could be avoided until after the non - relativistic evolution of the mesh is determined .",
    "the algorithm described above assumes that @xmath22 represents the separation of two simultaneous space - time points , i.e. , @xmath25 in the frame of the fluid .",
    "unfortunately , even if the mesh is originally defined with neighboring points being simultaneous , the simultaneity will be destroyed after propagating each point forward a fixed amount of proper time if the points undergo acceleration .",
    "here , we show that simultaneity can be maintained if different points on the hyper - surface are propagated forward by different steps in proper time .",

    "instead , one should integrate forward in time by an amount , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 refers to the time measured by a reference observer at @xmath41 .",
    "the equations of motion can be rewritten in terms of @xmath47 rather than @xmath48 , @xmath49 these expressions differ from the non - relativistic equations of motion due to the presence of @xmath50 on the right - hand sides of both equations .",
    "these equations are especially well suited for eulerian approaches , where the mesh moves with the fluid , and one need only solve the equations of motion for the evolution of differences of position and velocity between neighboring points , as measured by a co - moving observer .",
    "solution in more than one dimension of eq .",
    "( [ eq : motionb ] ) requires that the flow is ir - rotational . for rotational flow ,",
    "the definition of simultaneity , @xmath44 , can not uniquely map to a hyper - surface extending over all space .",
    "for instance , one can consider a ring of particles in uniform circular motion of a radius @xmath51 at a velocity @xmath52 .",
    "if two neighboring particles would synchronize their clocks as to be simultaneous in the frame of an observer moving with the particles , the laboratory observer would view this synchronization event as happening at two different times separated by @xmath53 .",
    "if the synchronization were to be performed clockwise around the ring , the times would be off by a factor @xmath54 after returning to the original point .",
    "the problem with rotational flow is also encountered when considering for @xmath55 which is only path independent if @xmath56 . if @xmath57 everywhere for the initial condition , and if @xmath58 for all times , the flow will remain ir - rotational . the requirement that @xmath58 is maintained when the pressure depends solely on the energy density , but can be violated if the pressure also depends on a particle density @xmath59 .",
    "this can be shown by considering @xmath60 for the physics of rhic , and especially for the physics of the lhc , the particle densities are small and rotational aspects of initial flow should be small .",
    "the flow would indeed be rotational at non - zero impact parameters , even at midrapidity @xcite",
    ". however , these effects should be less pronounced at higher beam energies if the production mechanism becomes increasingly boost - invariant .",
    "here , we present an exact analytic solution to the hydrodynamic equations of motion in eq . (",
    "[ eq : motionb ] ) for the specific case of one - dimensional motion where the speed of sound is constant .",
    "the solution is found by first mapping the coordinate @xmath61 , which measures the distance along a space - time path of simultaneity , to a new coordinate @xmath62 .",
    "the transformation to the new coordinate @xmath62 will be chosen to cancel the factor of @xmath50 in the equations of motion .",

    "these would look exactly like the non - relativistic expressions if the velocity could be identified with @xmath70 .",
    "this will not always be satisfied .",

    "this is not difficult as the observer has velocity @xmath108 at @xmath90 and accelerates with @xmath169 after that point .",
    "since these solutions have the same initial conditions and satisfy the same underlying hydrodynamic equations of motion , they should reproduce the first - stage khalatnikov - landau solution .",
    "this was checked numerically .",
    "the rapidity distribution can be extracted from the solution by considering @xmath119 which should approximately be proportional to the number of particles per unit rapidity .",
    "this is only approximate because thermal motion smears out the correspondence between a particles asymptotic rapidity and the rapidity of the source from which it was emitted . from the solution above , @xmath170 where @xmath171 . the precise form of @xmath119 depends on the form of the breakup surface in space - time , which is defined by the simultaneity condition here .",
    "a remarkable aspect of this result is that the shape is determined solely by the speed of sound , and is independent of the breakup time .",
    "of course , after the shocks meet , matter is no longer being fed into the solution at @xmath172 , and the width of the rapidity distribution would no longer be fixed .",
    "here , we have investigated the prospects of solving hydrodynamics in a coordinate system that maintains local simultaneity .",
    "this involves storing information about the number and entropy densities and about the velocity gradient along a hyper - surface defined by the condition @xmath44 . at each point in time the subsequent evolution of the velocity differences to the next time step become equivalent to those of non - relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "however , maintaining simultaneity requires propagating by a time step @xmath19 that differs at each mesh point by a factor @xmath173 relative to a reference observer .",
    "this approach has both advantanges and limitations .",
    "one advantage is that the differential equations are linear in the velocity , unlike the usual equations which involve @xmath174 factors . since mesh points satisfy @xmath44 , it is particularly convenient to extract information about the matter in its rest frame from the mesh .",
    "the coordinate system is especially attractive for one - dimensional systems , where for certain cases , one can also scale the position measurement and find some exact analystic solutions by mapping to non - relativistic solutions .    working with simultaneity - conserving coordinates",
    "does involve added difficulty when compared to non - relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "first , one must calculate the coefficient @xmath50 at each mesh point . for ideal hydrodynamics",
    "this is not difficult as the coefficient depends only on the local densities , and the densities of the reference observer . for viscous hydrodynamics ,",
    "calculation of @xmath50 might involve performing a path integral of the acceleration .",
    "viewing the evolution in standard coordinate systems , e.g. , a cartesian space - time mesh , can also be clumsy as the transformation to a different hyper - surface is a bit cumbersome .",
    "the most serious limitation of the method concerns rotational flow . in the absence of rotational",
    "flow the condition @xmath44 defines an infinite hyper - surface in space time , and each step forward in time defines a new surface .",
    "after evolving forward in time , each point in space time will belong to one surface , and one surface only .",
    "this is not the case for rotational flow , as the condition of simultaneity becomes path dependent .",
    "this restriction certainly disqualifies this approach for many applications for relativistic heavy ion collisions .    for certain one - dimensional cases , the method leads to analytic solutions .",
    "these are scaling solution , i.e. , ones where the density profile is determined by a single parameter . in these cases",
    "the hydrodynamic equations of motion exactly reproduce the non - relativistic ones after the distances along the hyper - surface are scaled along with the time .",
    "along with the khalatnikov - landau solution for matter ejected from a shock , which was already well known , we were able to find a gaussian solution . in the scaled coordinates ,",
    "it involves the expansion of a gaussian - shaped profile , exactly like the well - known non - relatistic case .",
    "one of our biggest disappointments is that the analytic solutions were confined to purely one - dimensional solutions .",
    "we could not even find analytic solutions for problems with spherical symmetry .",
    "analytic solutions in higher dimension would have been significantly more useful for testing higher - dimensional relativistic codes .",
    "one virtue of the anlaytic solution was that it provided a transparent means for understanding the effects of longitudinal acceleration at rhic .",
    "the analytic solution , which assumes complete stopping , and a numerical solution of a system with an initial hwa - bjorken expansion were compared with the constraint that they acheived the same @xmath138 at breakup .",
    "the analytic solution had such significant acceleration , that by a time of 0.5 fm/@xmath144 , when the numerical solution was initialized , it had already achieved a similar amount of collective velocity , and by breakup the two solutions were indistinguishable . for a speed of sound @xmath111",
    ", the rapidity spread was shown to increase by over 50% between @xmath153 fm/@xmath144 and a break - up time of 10 fm/@xmath144 .",
    "the quickness with which the initial conditions became irrelevant and the numerical solution merged with the analytic one was remarkable , and represents an important lesson .",
    "the effect of longitudinal acceleration is especially important for determining the lifetime from correlation analyses .",
    "the effect of the the expansion was to increase the life time by a simple factor , @xmath175 , where @xmath40 depended only on the ratio of @xmath138 at breakup to the speed of sound . for rhic",
    "this suggests a 10% effect .",
    "since the speed of sound and final rapidity spread are well constrained by other measurements , the correction factor factor is quite robust .",
    "the main qualifier comes from the fact that the effects of transverse expansion were not coupled into the evolution .    after having investigated prospects in detail ,",
    "we only enthusiastically endorse simultaneity - conserving approaches for one - dimensional problems , or for problems for which the symmetry reduces the problem to one dimension .",
    "we do not foresee major technical issues for extending the approach to more complicated equations of state or for incorporating viscous effects . for higher dimensions ,",
    "the difficulties associated with the path integrals and the limitations of ir - rotational flow might bring along more trouble than is warranted by the advantages of the approach .",
    "here , we review three solutions to one - dimensional relativistic hydrodynamics .",
    "the first is the khalatnikov - landau solution @xcite which assumes initial conditions of a thin slab with a uniform energy density inside and zero energy density outside . since no information can travel into the slab , due to the fact that @xmath176 , a shock develops . in the frame of the discontinuity the matter moves outward from the front at the speed of sound @xmath108 .",
    "choosing a coordinate system where the front is at @xmath177 , the velocity @xmath52 and entropy density @xmath16 outside the slab are described by : @xmath178 where @xmath179 is the rapidity and @xmath180 is the entropy density at @xmath177 which is determined by solving the rankine - hugoniot equations and is determined by the equations of state and the energy density inside the slab .",
    "this solution requires the additional assumption that the speed of sound is fixed .",
    "once the two shock fronts meet , the solution becomes a real tour de force , and has a much more complicated form than the simple expressions above .",
    "the latter part of the solution is expressed in terms of derivatives of an integral of bessel functions , which can be easily evaluated numerically .",
    "the second solution is the boost - invariant solution of hwa and bjorken @xcite is especially simple and can be easily incorporate an arbitrary equation of state .",
    "contrary to the landau parameterization , this solution assumes the existence of an initial flow velocity , and in fact , assumes that the flow covers an infinite rapidity window .",
    "the solution assumes that all frames which pass through the @xmath181 space - time point will see the same evolution .",
    "referred to as `` boost invariance '' , this implies that @xmath2 , and implies zero acceleration .",
    "furthermore , the energy density @xmath182 , the entropy density @xmath16 , the temperature @xmath183 and the pressure @xmath17 depend only on the time measured by co - moving observers , @xmath184 , which is known as the proper time . in the hwa - bjorken solution ,",
    "the distance between neighboring points at the same proper time , as measured by a co - moving observer , is @xmath185 , where @xmath186 given that @xmath2 , @xmath187 equals the rapidty @xmath69 in the hwa - bjorken solution .",
    "the collective velocity gradient is the same for all co - moving observers , @xmath188 .",
    "current conservation for the boost - invariant solution , @xmath189 , governs the time evolution of any conserved charge density .",
    "since @xmath190 , current conservation states that all charge densities fall inversely with time , @xmath191 since entropy is also conserved , @xmath16 also falls inversely with @xmath13 .",
    "since @xmath17 and @xmath182 are functions of @xmath16 and the charge densities , their time dependence is determined by the time equation of state .",
    "for instance , if the speed of sound is constant , @xmath192 , and @xmath193 .",
    "the boost - invariant nature of the solution can easily incorporate arbitrary equations of state , and can also incorporate viscosity . when viscosity is added , entropy is no longer conserved but one can solve for @xmath16 as a function of @xmath13 using the navier - stokes equation @xcite .",
    "the hwa - bjorken solution would seem justified in the case of extremely high beam energy , where the source covers many units of rapidity . in that limit",
    ", the pressure depends only slowly on @xmath187 , and since accelerations are driven by pressure gradients , the velocities of particular regions of the matter are fixed , thus justifying the condition @xmath2 .",
    "boost invariance also seems natural from the perspective of having matter created by the classical fields originating from the ultrarelativistic charges belonging to the incoming hadrons . for an observer at mid - rapidity",
    ", the currents appear as @xmath194 or @xmath195 , where @xmath144 is the velocity of light .",
    "if the observer boosts to a new frame , the currents will still appear to be @xmath194 and @xmath195 as long as the the observer does not approach the speed of the colliding hadrons . if the interactions are determined by currents , one would expect an approximate boost invariance at mid - rapidity .",
    "the shortcoming of the hwa - bjorken solution comes from ignoring longitudinal acceleration . as we will see in the next section , this shortcoming could result in 10 - 20% changes in the interpretation of some observables .",
    "one interesting aspect of boost - invariant solutions is that the conservation of total energy is not enforced .",
    "each fluid element expands and does work @xmath196 .",
    "however , that work never goes into increasing the collective kinetic energy of the fluid elements , since they all coast without acceleration . instead , the central cell does work on the adjacent cell , which then does even more work on the next cell . for an observer at rest , the work done onto subsequent cells at time @xmath99 increases exponentially , in a kind of covariant procrastination , until eventually , one reaches the light cone",
    "again , as long as many units of rapidity are covered , and as long as observations are confined to mid - rapidity , the overall conservation of energy can be ignored .",
