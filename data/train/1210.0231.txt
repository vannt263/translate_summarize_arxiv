    "we consider the problem of determining contact angle conditions at triple junctions of diffused interfaces in three - dimensional space via the elliptic vector - valued allen  cahn equation @xmath0 for maps @xmath1 and a triple - well potential @xmath2 .",
    "equation is a vector analogue of the well - known scalar elliptic equation @xmath3 for @xmath4 and a bistable potential @xmath5 with two minima , which was introduced by allen and cahn @xcite in the context of antiphase boundary motion . here",
    ", @xmath6 is an order parameter that denotes the coexisting phases in the phenomenon of phase separation .",
    "we note that a vector - valued order parameter is necessary for the coexistence of three or more phases ( see bronsard and reitich @xcite and also rubinstein , sternberg , and keller @xcite ) .",
    "both equations are rescaled elliptic versions of corresponding evolution problems that involve a small parameter @xmath7 , which denotes the thickness of interfaces , and they are euler  lagrange equations of energy functionals , whose minimizers are related to minimal surfaces ( see modica and mortola @xcite , modica @xcite , and baldo @xcite ) .    for the problem of contact angles in the case of soap films in three dimensions , the classical _ plateau angle conditions",

    "three soap films meet smoothly at equal angles of @xmath8 degrees along a curve,[law1 ] 2 .",
    "four such curves meet smoothly at equal angles of about @xmath9 degrees at a point.[law2 ]    the above laws hold in the isotropic case of soap films , which corresponds to systems of minimal surfaces ( cf .",
    "dierkes , hildebrandt , and sauvigny @xcite ) .",
    "the angle of @xmath8 degrees in the first condition is the angle whose cosine is @xmath10 , which is exactly the angle in isotropic triple junctions in two dimensions , while the angle of about @xmath9 degrees in the second condition is the angle whose cosine is @xmath11 ( the so - called maraldi angle ) . in the anisotropic case of mixtures of immiscible fluids ,",
    "the angles above are not always equal and depend on the surface tension coefficients of each fluid , as in systems of constant mean curvature surfaces . in this case , the angles at the four triods determine the angles at the point singularity .    in @xcite , for triple - well potentials , the authors linked at the level of formal asymptotics the diffused - interface problem with the associated sharp - interface problem and they established that to leading order the inner solution ( that describes the solution near the triple junction ) satisfies . that work is restricted on the plane . the rigorous study of for symmetric triple wells under the symmetries of the equilateral triangle was settled by bronsard , gui , and schatzman @xcite in two dimensions , and for symmetric quadruple - well potentials under the symmetries of the tetrahedron in three dimensions by gui and schatzman @xcite . finally , alikakos and fusco @xcite settled the general case of symmetric potentials under a general reflection group in arbitrary dimensions .",
    "concerning the minimal surface problem , taylor @xcite showed that in three dimensions the only singular minimizing cones are a triod of planes meeting along a line at 120 degree angles , and a complex of six planes meeting with tetrahedral symmetry at a point , as in plateau s laws . to our knowledge ,",
    "results on minimal cones are not available in higher dimensions . concerning the sharp - interface problem ,",
    "the corresponding global geometric evolution problem in two dimensions for a single triple junction in a convex domain has been settled by mantegazza , novaga , and tortorelli @xcite and magni , mantegazza , and novaga @xcite .",
    "ilmanen , with co - authors , has announced very general results on the plane .",
    "the local existence for triple junctions on the plane was settled in bronsard and reitich @xcite .    in this note",
    "we restrict ourselves to triple - well potentials defined over @xmath12 , with three global nondegenerate minima , and we assume the existence of an entire classical solution connecting the minima at infinity ( see @xcite ) .",
    "such a solution partitions @xmath12 in three regions that are separated by three interfaces which intersect along a line that we call the _ spine _ of the triod . in the symmetric case",
    ", this corresponds to one of the two singular minimizing cones for the associated plateau problem .",
    "gui @xcite considered the problem of determining the contact angles at a planar triple junction and under similar hypotheses to ours rigorously derived the so - called young s law @xcite @xmath13 for the angles @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 between interfaces , where the @xmath17 s are surface tension coefficients between neighboring phases .",
    "( see also the formal derivation in @xcite . )",
    "we note that in three dimensions , the angles at a triod also obey young s law , while the angles at a quadruple junction are a geometric consequence of the angle conditions at the four triods that form it ( see bronsard , garcke , and stoth @xcite for the calculation ) , that is , given a quadruple - junction configuration , plateau s second law follows from the first , which is the isotropic version of young s law .",
    "our goal in the following is to extend gui s work to three dimensions and rigorously derive young s law for triods of interfaces as a property of solutions satisfying the next two hypotheses .",
    "( these will be justified and made precise in section [ section : statement ] . )",
    "we note that the hypotheses below are satisfied by construction in bronsard , gui , and schatzman @xcite and gui and schatzman @xcite , and are theorems in @xcite .",
    "[ h1 ] along rays emanating from any point of the spine , in the interior of regions , solutions converge exponentially to the corresponding minima of the potential .",
    "[ h2 ] along lines parallel to interfaces and not parallel to the spine , in the interior of regions , solutions converge to _ connections _ , that is , to maps with argument the distance to the interface and with the property of connecting the minima of the potential at plus and minus infinity .",
    "our derivation makes use of the fact that is a divergence - free condition for a certain stress tensor , which appeared in alikakos @xcite in this context . for the planar analogue ,",
    "the derivation of bronsard and reitich @xcite is based on formal asymptotics , while the derivation of gui @xcite is closer to our spirit in terms of assumptions and rigor but uses pohozaev - like identities instead of the stress tensor .",
    "( see @xcite for the connection between the two . ) for the three - dimensional problem , related results appear in the theses @xcite and @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the problem in three dimensions is substantially more involved compared to the planar case , due to the fact that the singularity at a planar triple junction is a point that can be isolated , while the spine of a triod in three dimensions can not , since it extends to infinity , and similar difficulties also arise in higher dimensions .",
    "we remark that our method applies easily to the two - dimensional case and that in higher dimensions the application is significantly harder and will appear elsewhere @xcite .",
    "the rest of the present note consists of two sections . in section [ section : statement ] we set up the problem , stating all necessary assumptions , and formulate it in divergence - free form via the stress tensor . in section [ section : derivation ]",
    "we apply the divergence theorem for the stress tensor on a ball , which is then blown up after a proper slicing .",
    "this slicing involves a surgery around the singularity which appears at the intersection of the surface of integration with the spine and a breaking up of the remaining part in a way that utilizes the hypotheses on the solutions at infinity , that is , hypothesis [ h1 ] far from interfaces and hypothesis [ h2 ] at fixed distances from them .",
    "this yields young s law in the form of a balance of forces relation for the conormals of the three interfaces , which is equivalent to .",
    "we start with @xmath18 for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath19 .",

    "moreover , we ask that @xmath20 satisfies a mild coercivity assumption , that is , @xmath27 finally , note that we do not make any symmetry assumptions on @xmath20 .    as explained in section [ section : introduction ] , we consider solutions that partition the domain space in three regions via a triod of diffused flat interfaces . we distinguish three regions @xmath28 in @xmath12 for @xmath29 , such that the region @xmath28 contains the minimum @xmath30 with @xmath31 being the interface that separates @xmath28 and @xmath32 ( with @xmath33 ) . for each region",
    "@xmath28 we have that if @xmath34 , then @xmath35 for @xmath36 ( cone property ) .",
    "we choose coordinates as follows .",
    "we take the origin on the spine , which we identify with the @xmath37 axis , and we further identify interface @xmath38 with the half plane @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , such that @xmath42 is the distance to @xmath38 .",
    "we also recall here the spherical coordinates in three dimensions , that is , @xmath43 for an azimuthal angle @xmath44 , for a polar angle @xmath45 $ ] , and for @xmath46 . in terms of the azimuthal angle @xmath47 , the interface @xmath38 lies at @xmath48 .",
    "the uniformly bounded entire solutions we consider satisfy @xmath49 globally in @xmath12 . using this bound and linear elliptic theory ( cf .",
    "the proof of lemma [ regularity - lemma ] ) , we also have the uniform bound @xmath50 again globally in @xmath12 .    for such solutions",
    "we have two hypotheses .",
    "the first one concerns the fact that solutions converge exponentially to the corresponding equilibrium in the interior of each region .",
    "this has been verified under assumptions of symmetry on the potential by several authors ( see @xcite ) and we postulate that it holds for general potentials .",

    "( we use the notation @xmath53 for the estimate @xmath54 , where @xmath55 is an absolute constant . )    the second hypothesis is that along directions parallel to interfaces solutions converge to `` one - dimensional '' heteroclinic connections @xmath56 , which connect the equilibria @xmath30 , @xmath57 at infinity , in the sense that @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the distance to the interface @xmath31 .",
    "[ hypothesis2 ] along directions parallel to an interface @xmath31 solutions converge pointwise to a one - dimensional connection @xmath60 with argument the distance to the interface , that is , @xmath61    these limiting functions are solutions to the associated hamiltonian ode system @xmath62 with the property of connecting the minima of @xmath20 at infinity .",
    "( we refer to @xcite for further information on the connection problem . )",
    "we define the action of such a connection to be the nonnegative quantity @xmath63 and also note that connections satisfy the equipartition relation @xmath64    in support of the hypotheses above , we note that for potentials @xmath20 symmetric with respect to the group of symmetries of the equilateral triangle in @xmath12 , where @xmath20 is @xmath21 and with three global minima placed inside the partitioning regions , and under the coercivity assumption @xmath65 , hypothesis [ hypothesis1 ] is a theorem ( cf .",
    "moreover , hypothesis [ hypothesis2 ] is also a theorem for symmetric potentials ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) , under the additional assumption of uniqueness and hyperbolicity of connections , which is generic by the appendix in @xcite .",

    "we expect that along the lines of @xcite one should also be able to verify hypothesis [ hypothesis2 ] for local minimizers . in conclusion ,",
    "the major underlying hypothesis in our work is the existence of an entire solution connecting in a certain sense the minima for nonsymmetric potentials ( cf .",

    "this tensor was introduced in alikakos @xcite in the context of , where further applications are also presented .",
    "however , it is a well - known object in the physics literature ( for instance , in the landau and lifshitz series ; see @xcite for more information ) .",

    "letting @xmath78 be the map acting on the new coordinates with @xmath79 , the chain rule gives that its gradient is transformed via @xmath80 , where the prime denotes that the derivatives are taken with respect to the new coordinate system .",

    "that is , the transformed tensor has exactly the same expression as the original one , except for the fact that it acts in the transformed coordinates .    finally , we prove two lemmas that will be used in the following .",
