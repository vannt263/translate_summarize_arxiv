    "the history of atomic physics is inextricably related to that of the quantum theory , as well known , since the development of the last one was required just by evidences claiming for an appropriate physical description of atomic systems . if it is true that the first success of the old quantum theory relied mainly in n. bohr s characterization of the hydrogen atom , the general achievement of the new quantum mechanics was driven by the accurate description of the helium atom @xcite .",
    "predictions about heavier atoms involved , instead , just the development of appropriate ( mathematical and physical ) methods to be applied within a well established conceptual framework : in a sense , it was only a matter of numerical accuracy .",
    "a quick glance to the monumental work by mehra and rechenberg @xcite may serve very well to seize the path followed by atomic physics as quantum mechanics took its primary ( and secondary ) steps , and the conclusion that can be drawn is simply that , irrespective of more or less expected difficulties , such a path was somewhat linear to a very large extent",
    ".    the same conclusion can not be applied at all to the development of molecular physics , whose path within quantum mechanics was far more intricate , at least at its starting , ranging approximately from 1926 to 1931 .",
    "the reason for this resides mainly in the basic difference between atomic and molecular systems , i.e. to deal with a two- or more - center problem , with respect to the one - center problem for atoms , but it is only partially true that the sole greater mathematical complexity was at the root of the intricacy of that path . if polar molecules were described simply in terms of electrostatic interaction among the constituent atomic systems already in the framework of the old quantum theory , novel physical concepts were required even just for an approximate understanding of the chemical bond in homopolar compounds . and , although such concepts revealed to be genuinely quantum mechanical in nature , their emergence and physical interpretation was not at all trivial , as testified by the appearance ( in the years mentioned ) of a number of papers discussing different methods and viewpoints .    as a matter of fact",
    ", there was not a unique line of research to which subsequent results were added as they were got , in order to obtain a more and more clear picture , but , rather , several lines appeared that produced different ( and , in some cases , competing ) results without leading to a univocal advancement in the clear understanding of the issue of the chemical bond .",
    "conversely , also several minor contributions revealed their relevance in making the general picture clearer , and the result of this marked intricacy was that , only in the first years of 1930s , the multifarious facets of quantum chemistry came out limpidly .",
    "the concept of a _ chemical bond _ made its first appearance in the chemical literature in 1866 , in a paper by e. frankland @xcite , and , as well , the idea of _ valence _ was very early introduced into chemistry to explain some number relationships in the combining ratios of atoms and ions .",
    "however , the first attempt to incorporate the atomic structure information in a consistent  though qualitative  theoretical framework was performed by g.n .",
    "lewis only in 1916 @xcite , the key points of his theory being that each nucleus tends to be surrounded by a closed shell of electrons ( as in noble gases ) and that the homopolar chemical bond is built from a pair of electrons shared between two nuclei .",
    "despite some success in describing a number of previously unrelated facts , lewis theory was not able to say anything on the nature of the forces involved in the formation of the homopolar bond @xcite and , on the other hand , bohr s old quantum theory , with its successful explanation of balmer s law , triggered the key role of spectroscopy as a guiding principle in explaining also the structure of the chemical bond .",
    "nevertheless , only with the advent of quantum mechanics appropriate and powerful theoretical tools became available in order to tackle the problem @xcite , thus becoming possible  in principle  to write down an equation for any system of nuclei and electrons , whose solution would have provided thorough predictions on the stability of the molecular system .",
    "however , the @xmath0-body problem revealed to be not amenable to exact analytical solutions , thus triggering the development of several approximation methods , and the key idea of _ exchange forces _ ( or quantum _ resonance _ ) , introduced in molecular physics by w. heitler and f. london ( and borrowed by w. heisenberg s theory of the helium atom @xcite ) , was finally required in order to lay the foundations of the quantum theory of homopolar chemical bond .",
    "as happened already in atomic physics , spectroscopy also contributed as a key tool towards the development of such a theory , and several scientists , including f. hund , r.s .",
    "mulliken , g. herzberg and j.e .",
    "lennard - jones , appealed to molecular spectroscopy in order to introduce the concept of _ molecular orbital _ , which produced an approach to the understanding of the chemical bond completely different with respect to that introduced by heitler and london .",
    "a number of different refinements and generalizations of both approaches later appeared in the subsequent literature , but quantitative calculations remained much too complicated to allow tests of the novel ideas in molecules other than diatomic ones formed from hydrogen and helium atoms .",
    "different approximation methods were , then , developed ( even for the simplest molecules ) , and some physical insight into the complex mathematical problem was gained thanks to the seminal paper by m. born and j.r .",
    "here it was shown that , at a first approximation , the motion of the nuclei in the molecules could be neglected , and a well - defined hierarchy existed between electronic , vibrational and rotational states .",
    "additional light upon the intricate problem came , then , also from the application of the powerful tools of group theory , although only few authors exploited it appropriately to get some insight into the mathematical form of the wavefunction , deduced from the symmetry properties of the molecular system it describes . to a larger extent",
    ", group theory was used instead to put some order in spectroscopic evidences , and to relate apparently different observations .",
    "the transmission of the achievements gained by the quantum theory of the chemical bond to people more accustomed to a chemistry - based language produced , remarkably , also a non - negligible result in the understanding of several points of the theory itself .",
    "l. pauling and j.h .",
    "van vleck , indeed , in addition to their own original contributions to the subject , wrote some review papers that served to clarify substantially the physical meaning of the novel concepts introduced , and thus helped to digest the corresponding mathematical results , both to chemists and physicists .    in the present paper , we will try to outline the relevant steps that allowed the genesis of the quantum theory of the chemical bond through the years 1926 - 1931 , being well aware that , as a consequence of what explained above , such a work is _ de facto _ partial and biassed , if it is contained  as we do  into a reasonable length . nevertheless , the discussion of general ideas as well as some important details in molecular spectroscopy ( sect.[spectrosect ] ) and quantum computations , both perturbative and variational , for simple systems ( sect.[bosect ] ) , along with a thorough description of the historical development of the method of molecular orbitals ( sect .",
    "[ molorb ] ) and that of the heitler - london theory ( sect.[hlsect ] ) , can certainly serve as a starting point in the comprehension of that genesis . a completely non - negligible role in such a task",
    "was played also by the results about the simplest molecules formed with hydrogen and helium , discussed in sect.[further ] , as well as those pertaining to the subject of intermolecular interactions , treated briefly in sect.[intermol ] .",
    "we will focus mainly on diatomic molecules , as indeed happened in the years considered for quantitative studies .",
    "the large amount of contributions here analyzed will be finally summarized in our concluding section .",
    "early days investigations about simple diatomic molecules were aimed mainly at giving a qualitative explanation of the structure of the spectra observed , just by applying phenomenological models already tested in the interpretation of atomic spectra .",
    "the simple idea followed at the very beginning @xcite was to ascribe all the known phenomenology to either the rotation or the vibration motion of the nuclear component of the molecules , but it was realized quite soon @xcite that a fine structure originated from electronic motion , thus strongly influencing the observed band spectra .",
    "the theoretical problem then arose , within the framework of the new quantum mechanics , to explain the relationship between the electronic motion and the band spectrum .      a key contribution in this direction came from a seminal work by hund @xcite , who introduced the concept of an _",
    "adiabatic _ combination of two atoms in forming a molecule through the application of a vector addition model , resulting into a first classification of the spectral terms of diatomic molecules .",
    "his starting point was the fact that the state of an atom with one valence electron is determined by the four quantum numbers @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , where @xmath1 labels the orbital angular moment of the electron , @xmath4 is the total angular momentum of the atom ( @xmath5 being the electron spin ) , and @xmath3 is its component along the direction of an external field .",
    "the counting of the number of terms in an atom with several outer electrons ( labelled by the index @xmath6 ) , instead , followed from the general assumption that the motion is essentially determined by the principal and secondary quantum numbers of each electron : the interaction among the vectors @xmath7 and among the vectors @xmath8 is taken into account as a first - order perturbation , while the interaction of @xmath1 and @xmath5 is a second - order effect . as a result ,",
    "the correct counting of terms came out , but the position of terms in the spectrum was wrongly predicted , since the correct ratio between the different interactions was no longer kept .",
    "hund applied such results just to the study of diatomic molecules , by assuming  in the first instance  the nuclei to be fixed in their positions by some external force . in the presence of only one electron , the state of the molecule",
    "could then be determined by the quantum numbers @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , with different @xmath3-values resulting in different terms , even without an external field .",
    "in particular , if @xmath9 denotes the angular momentum along the direction of the internuclear axis , and the perturbation induced by the two nuclei on the electronic motion is large with respect to the interaction between @xmath1 and @xmath5 , the actual positions of the terms resulted to be well described by the numbers @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 , with @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "instead , when several electrons are present , hund considered a model of a molecule as built up from joining together two atoms ( described by quantum numbers @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 ) with the required total number of electrons , in such a way that the corresponding molecular term could be determined by the configuration labelled by @xmath14 , @xmath18 , @xmath15 , @xmath19 , @xmath16 , @xmath20 , @xmath17 , @xmath21 .",
    "an alternative description to the `` united atom '' was , as well , introduced by imagining the molecule to be formed by only one atom with the required number of electrons , whose nucleus is then split and the resulting parts taken a little apart : in such a way , the molecular terms would be determined by @xmath1 , @xmath5 , @xmath2 , @xmath9 . by following w. pauli @xcite ,",
    "hund finally concluded that the two alternative countings led to the same number of terms in the molecular spectrum .",
    "the next step was to relax the assumption of fixed nuclei , and let them to perform a motion such that the corresponding energy is small when compared to the electronic ones ( in the limit of large nuclear masses ) . by keeping the internuclear distance to be fixed ,",
    "the motion of the molecule would have been determined by two additional ( with respect to the electronic ) quantum numbers , @xmath22 and @xmath23 , identified with the total angular momentum and its component along the direction of the external field , respectively , as well as the vibrational quantum number .    in order to estimate the position of the molecular terms",
    ", hund assumed , at a first approximation , that the electrons circled around both nuclei , and the following interactions were included : 1 ) coupling among the angular momenta @xmath7 and among the spins @xmath8 of single electrons ; 2 ) perturbation induced by the motion of the two nuclei on the electronic motion ( `` _ _ influence of the distinguished axis _ _ '' ) , determined by @xmath7 and independent of the direction of the motion around the internuclear axis ; 3 ) coupling between @xmath7 and @xmath8 ; 4 ) influence of @xmath7 on the molecular rotation through a change of its moment of inertia .",
    "the evaluation of the _ influence of the distinguished direction of the internuclear axis _ , which resulted to be very similar to the stark effect within hund s approximations , was performed by considering constant the component of the total angular momentum of the electronic orbit around the nuclear axis , and thus quantized to first order with the ( small ) perturbations induced by interactions 3 ) and 4 ) .",
    "two limiting cases were , then , considered , corresponding to two particular molecule configurations ",
    "hund s a ) and b ) configurations  where rotational effects are small or large with respect to those driven by the @xmath24 coupling .    in case",
    "a ) , a rapid electronic motion was obtained as a first approximation , with a corresponding angular momentum along the nuclear axis equal to @xmath25 , while the total vector @xmath5 was found to adjust to the vectors @xmath7 ( in second approximation ) and to perform a precession around the internuclear axis .",
    "this gives rise to @xmath26 terms with @xmath27 .",
    "the effect of the rotation was finally added , producing the quantization of the total angular momentum @xmath22 , along with a splitting of the single - electron terms in the presence of a slow rotation .    in case",
    "b ) , instead , the rotation is added to the electronic motion as a second order effect , while , as a third order effect , a perturbation of this motion induced by @xmath5 is included , so that both @xmath28 and @xmath29 precess around a total momentum @xmath22 . as a result ,",
    "the energy is proportional to @xmath30 and , in the case of a fast rotation , a splitting of the electronic terms in @xmath26 components is obtained .    by comparing cases",
    "a ) and b ) , hund finally found that the same values of @xmath22 were obtained , the corresponding band lines being explicitly depicted .      in a series of other papers @xcite @xcite ,",
    "hund further developed his qualitative model of a diatomic molecule and also generalized it to a molecule with an arbitrary number of atoms , by focusing on the characteristics of the spectral terms related to the electronic motion ( so that molecular optical spectra were considered , where the motion of the outer electrons is crucial ) .    a classical model of a diatomic molecule dealt with the motion of a charged mass point , identified with the optical electron , in a central force field with a potential with two minima , @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 being the distances of the given electron to the nuclei .",
    "this problem was worth to be solved in two limiting cases .",
    "the first case corresponds to a very large distance between the nuclei , so that the electron is in the neighborhood of the first or the second nucleus , respectively : a _ resonance _",
    "@xcite @xcite between the two configurations can be envisaged , and the motion is similar to that of an electron in an atom placed in an external electric field .",
    "the second one corresponds , instead , to a situation in which the nuclei are close together , and the motion of the electron can be described by a simple perturbation theory in a modified one - minimum potential .",
    "the actual configuration of a diatomic molecule pertains , obviously , to an intermediate case , but , as pointed out by hund , the transition from one limiting case to the other can not be done adiabatically within such a classical model .",
    "hund then switched to the quantum version and obtained an _",
    "adiabatic relation _ between the states of the two separated atoms or ions , those of the corresponding diatomic molecule and the states of the atom resulting from the union of the two nuclei .",
    "such relation allowed him to solve the general two - center problem and to build up a reliable model system giving rise to a qualitative explanation of molecular spectra .",
    "indeed , for the simplest two - center problem with one electron , he obtained a schrdinger equation which is separable in elliptic coordinates @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , as earlier derived by w. alexandrow @xcite and  .",
    "burrau @xcite ( see below ) , but getting a more general solution describing the qualitative behavior of the corresponding molecular terms . for a molecule with more than two electrons ,",
    "hund considered more than two separated systems ; for diatomic molecules with two electrons , the systems are those with both electrons on one nucleus , both electrons on the other nucleus , and one electron on each nucleus .",
    "he worked out again two limiting cases , the most relevant one assuming a very weak coupling between the electrons , so that the corresponding schrdinger equation is approximately separable and then amenable to find solutions for the motion of each single electron .",
    "hund applied such considerations to the study of the simplest molecule , i.e. the hydrogen molecular ion h@xmath37 , and built up a model taking into account the vibration of the internuclear distance around an equilibrium configuration , determined previously by the electronic configuration . in this picture , the energy becomes a function of the internuclear distance @xmath6 and its minimum gives the equilibrium configuration . in the limit of small @xmath6 , the energy of each term goes as @xmath38 and the distances between terms behave as those between terms of a _",
    "united nucleus_.    a further application of the theory was to the hydrogen molecule h@xmath39 , whose energy term scheme was recognized to lie on the boundary between the systems h@xmath40h , h@xmath41h@xmath42 and the he atom , in this way opening the door to the concept of a _ polar molecule _ :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a molecule is polar if it transforms into two oppositely charged ions when the nuclei are pulled apart @xcite . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    finally , following oppenheimer @xcite , a generalization to molecules with four or more atoms was as well developed @xcite , starting from a picture where the effect of the electronic motion is large with respect to nuclear vibrations , which in turn are large if compared with the rotation of the molecule .",
    "thus , only vibrational and rotational spectra were considered , and the symmetry characters of particular configurations were derived , such as  for example  those of molecules with two different `` arrangements '' of minimal potential energy which are equivalent up to a reflection : the transition from one arrangement to the other corresponds to a given frequency in the spectrum .",
    "as summarized later by e.u .",

    "a two - center problem was usually solved by replacing the given system with a simpler one , built of two masses interacting each other through an arbitrary potential energy law .",
    "this effective potential energy was identified with the average of the interactions between the rapidly moving electrons and the nuclei , in addition to the mutual coulomb repulsion between nuclei .",
    "condon then argued that , due to the heavy masses of nuclei , an approximate separation of variables in the schrdinger equation could be performed , in this way anticipating some concepts which should have been developed some months later by born and oppenheimer @xcite ( see below ) .",
    "he applied such considerations to the hydrogen molecular ion , analyzing two limiting cases . in the first case , when the nuclei are far apart",

    "the formation of the he@xmath39 molecule , as we have seen above , was successfully considered for the first time by heitler and london @xcite , who concluded that no stable molecule of such a kind could be formed ( in the normal state ) , due to the pauli principle .",
    "the problem then arose to study the possible formation of other compounds involving helium , this really requiring the introduction of new concepts in order to fully understand the nature of the chemical bond involved and its formation .    in 1930 , by following the heitler - london method , g. gentile @xcite computed the interaction energy between h and he as well as between two helium atoms in their ground state ; his perturbative calculations ( which included , at second order , polarization forces ) showed that normal he and h do not form a stable molecule .",
    "one year later , pauling reconsidered the general problem @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , and looked for approximate solutions of the schrdinger equation for a diatomic system built of a pair of electrons attached to one nucleus and a single electron attached to the second nucleus , recognizing that resonance forces corresponding to the exchange of three electrons were mainly repulsive .",
    "this allowed him to propose an exchange mechanism for the occurrence of a _ three - electron bond _ that was a direct generalization of what originally introduced by heitler and london , where the resonance phenomenon involved degenerate ( or nearly degenerate ) electronic states , and a rule was formulated :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ a three electron bond , involving one eigenfunction for each of two atoms and three electrons , can be formed in case the two configurations a@xmath247b and a@xmath248b correspond to essentially the same energy @xcite .",

    "instead , in the presence of four electrons , he deduced that there is no tendency to form a strong molecular bond , because two of them are necessarily nuclear symmetric while the remaining two are nuclear antisymmetric .",
    "the problem of the formation of he@xmath59 was considered only qualitatively by pauling , by assuming  following weizel @xcite ",
    "that its formation was due to the bonding of a neutral helium atom with a ionized one , he @xmath40 he@xmath249 he@xmath250 , in full analogy with the case of the hydrogen molecular ion h@xmath250 ( but with three electrons instead of only one ) , rather than with that of the compound heh , which exhibits a three - electron bond .",
    "a similar process was envisaged also for the ( excited ) neutral helium molecule : there , an unpaired @xmath251 electron comes into play as a result of the excitation of one atom , whose interaction with the pair of @xmath251 electrons of the other atom eventually leading to a three - electron bond .",
    "the contribution to the chemical bond from the remaining outer electron could be neglected , so giving rise to a hydrogen - like spectrum .",
    "later in 1933 , pauling did provide a quantitative treatment of the normal state of he@xmath37 by means of a variational method @xcite with a wavefunction for the system of two helium nuclei and three electrons in terms of hydrogen - like @xmath251 functions , by assuming each electron to interact only with one nucleus .",
    "minimization with respect to the effective nuclear charge @xmath76 ( @xmath252 ) resulted into fairly accurate numerical estimates for the equilibrium internuclear distance ( @xmath253 ) , the dissociation energy ( @xmath254 ) and , to a lesser extent , the vibrational frequency ( @xmath255 ) .    by adopting the same variational procedure , and with similar component wavefunctions , approximately the same numerical results were obtained much earlier by majorana @xcite , who ( differently from pauling ) was able to construct the appropriate eigenfunctions of the system in accordance with its symmetry properties , by using a typical group theory reasoning .",
    "the relevance of _ inversion _ symmetry  the total electronic wavefunction must show a definite symmetry with respect to the midpoint of the internuclear line  was correctly emphasized , thus allowing him to show that two molecular states are possible for the he@xmath59 molecular ion , only one of which corresponding to the bonding molecular orbital of the ion , such a configuration just reflecting the fact that the ground state of the system exhibits resonance between the he@xmath247he and he@xmath248he configurations .",
    "simultaneously to the development of appropriate methods able to explain satisfactorily the homopolar valence in molecules , the building up of an accurate quantum theory of intermolecular forces was pursued starting from 1930 , which further deepened the understanding of the nature of the chemical bond .    a first step towards this direction was carried out by r. eisenschitz and london @xcite , who devised a general perturbative approach that included , in a unified scheme , both homopolar and van der waals forces .",
    "the underlying idea was to recognize the homopolar valence according to quantum mechanics as the result of a saturation mechanism :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ this saturation mechanism is of the type where , for instance , a single - valued atom can not bind to a third atom with the same force with which it binds to a second atom @xcite . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    since a bound valence can be broken only by supplying to the molecule an amount of energy that coincides with the chemical activation energy , the valence forces decrease exponentially with the distance between the constituent atoms , @xmath256 , and were thus identified as relatively short ranged . instead ,",
    "since for the polarization forces `` no saturation is present , they are not related to the chemical interactions of neutral atoms , but to the van der waals attraction forces '' @xcite , and are thus based on the interaction between induced dipoles . they were found to decrease with the interatomic distance as @xmath257 , so that they vanish more slowly at infinity than the homopolar binding forces , and then dominate at large distances . just on the basis of such considerations , eisenschitz and london @xcite developed a general procedure for successive approximations of the atomic interactions , which included valence as a first order effect , and then van der waals forces .",
    "few months later , london also considered medium and long range forces @xcite @xcite in order to characterize the intermolecular attraction playing a role in the phase transition from liquid to gas . within the old quantum theory ,",
    "van der waals attraction was found to be proportional to the square of the quadrupole moment of the system , so that a huge moment had to be assumed for noble gases to fit with observations . however , with the advent of the new quantum mechanics , it became clear that such quadrupole moments are extremely small ( or vanishing at all ) due to the spherical symmetry of the system , and thus  there must be other , and essentially stronger , forces which are not related exclusively to the existence of a molecular quadrupole \" @xcite . from eisenschitz and london , it was in fact known that the attractive potential between spherical symmetric h atoms at large distances goes as @xmath258 , so that it is certainly predominant over that derived for polarizable quadrupole molecules , scaling as @xmath259 .",
    "indeed , molecular attraction was determined as a second order perturbative effect , both in the case of atomic noble gases and for polyatomic molecules , even if such molecules have more complex symmetry properties ( spherical symmetry holds only in the lowest rotational state , with @xmath260 ) .",
    "the second order perturbation energy , describing the interaction between a molecule in the state @xmath210 and another molecule in the state @xmath1 is given by @xmath261 where the terms in the summation with vanishing denominator had to be left out .",
    "the interaction energy matrix @xmath262 , depending explicitly on the interatomic distance @xmath61 , was expanded in terms of @xmath263 as : @xmath264 where @xmath265 , @xmath266 are dipole and quadrupole moments , respectively , and @xmath267 , @xmath268 ,   are functions ( of order @xmath75 ) of the spatial orientation of the multipole .",
    "the main contribution to the interaction energy in ( [ h1 ] ) comes just from the first term in eq .",
    "( [ h2 ] ) , which is then proportional to @xmath269 , as already found by eisenschitz and london , while the others give subdominant contributions with @xmath270 ,   scaling .",
    "the intermolecular interaction ( [ h1 ] ) ( whose range of validity is restricted to @xmath271 ) was decomposed into four terms as follows @xcite : @xmath272 the contribution @xmath273 , corresponding to the interaction between rigid and rotating multipoles , was envisaged as a directional effect , while the term @xmath274 was identified with the debye induction effect , due to the polarizability of the slowly rotating molecule in a quasi - static field , and , finally , the contribution @xmath275 ( driving a dispersion effect ) was recognized to be due to the fast periodic influence of the motion of inner electrons on each other , giving rise to the temperature independent part of the van der waals attraction .",
    "the origin of intermolecular forces was further discussed by london @xcite , later in the same year 1930 , also by means of a simplified but exactly soluble model , in order to evaluate sublimation and adsorption heats , dissociation energies of molecules interacting via van der waals forces , and so on .",
    "this was achieved by considering two quasi - elastic dipoles with variable electric moment @xmath276 , mass @xmath3 , momentum @xmath277 and polarizability @xmath169 , put at a fixed distance @xmath61 , whose hamiltonian is @xmath278 the second term modeled the quasi - elastic potential energy of the individual molecules , while the third one is the interaction potential of the molecules with each other . by introducing the normal coordinates of the principal vibrations it was possible to cast it into an hamiltonian of six decoupled oscillators , whose total energy was easily found to be : @xmath279 @xmath280 being the eigenfrequency of the isolated dipole . here",
    "the first term , independent of @xmath61 , gives the eigenenergy of the two molecules taken together , while the second one , depending on the resonance degeneracy , leads to dipole type forces .",
    "the third term describes the interaction between non - excited molecules , which is always attractive ; for the lowest state with @xmath281 , it reduces to the zero point contribution @xmath282 interestingly , such a result led london to link the appearance of forces between molecules in their normal state to the presence of a zero - point motion , subject to the restriction @xmath283 .",
    "at the end of his review paper , in 1929 van vleck hopefully asked :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ is it too optimistic to hazard the opinion that this is perhaps the beginnings of a science of  mathematical chemistry \" in which chemical heats of reaction are calculated by quantum mechanics just as are the spectroscopic frequencies of the physicist ?",
    "of course the mathematics will be laborious and involved , and the results always successive approximations .",
    "the theoretical computer of molecular energy levels must have a technique comparable with that of a mathematical astronomer @xcite . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    what discussed above has shown that the quantum explanation of the nature of the chemical bond in molecules was ( unfortunately ) not at all only a matter of laborious and involved mathematical calculations , but its story has been rather intricate , when compared to that of the analogous description of atoms .",
    "a number of authors contributed with more or less significant results , by starting ( as for atomic physics ) with the classification and ordering of spectroscopic data .    the distinguishing work performed by hund",
    "( then followed by many others ) served to establish molecular spectroscopy as an essential tool for developing a quantum theory of the chemical bond , but , even with the aid of group theory , the first steps along this line were still oriented by the framework of the old quantum theory , or  in other terms  they focused too much on the methods typical of atomic physics .",
    "however , it was soon recognized that such methods were at variance with those required for a successful description of molecules , and approximation schemes were developed in order to find reliable solutions to the schrdinger equation of the given non - central molecular problem ( diatomic molecules ) . a quantitative theory accounting for rotational , vibrational and electronic terms of a molecule",
    "was developed by born and oppenheimer , showing that the corresponding energy contributions for those states could be obtained systematically as successive terms in a suitable series expansion involving the electron - to - nuclear mass ratio , thus becoming possible to neglect the nuclear motion at a first approximation .",
    "novel ideas , however , had to be introduced in order to gain more physical insight into the molecular problem , and heitler and london succeeded to translate heisenberg s resonance mechanism ( introduced in atomic physics ) into a suitable form able to account for the stability of the hydrogen molecule in terms of genuinely quantum exchange forces .",
    "they also predicted the dependence of the total electronic energy on the internuclear distance , and showed , remarkably , that no stable he@xmath47 may be formed , thus opening a viable route towards predictive quantum computations in molecular physics .",
    "heitler and london s approach originated from the concept of chemical valence , and , in a sense , it was aimed to explain the chemical bond by using properties of the constituent atoms , such atoms being assumed to retain their properties in the molecule to a large extent .",
    "people frequently accustomed to work with molecular spectroscopy , however , were used to observe similar properties in many different molecules ( formed with different atoms ) with the same number of electrons , and it was then quite natural to assume a molecule to be a collection of nuclei fixed in given spatial positions with an additional electron cloud surrounding them .",
    "this was at the roots of the idea of `` promoted electrons '' introduced by mulliken , and just within such a framework ( followed by several other spectroscopy - based scientists ) the concept of molecular orbitals occupied by each electron appeared by means of lennard - jones . a molecular orbital spreads over the whole of the molecule , so that the chemical bond resulted  in this view  from `` sharing '' electrons among the constituent atoms , these then loosing their identity to a large extent , as opposed to the heitler - london method .",
    "these first steps allowed the thorough ( quantitative ) description of the most simple molecules , h@xmath59 and h@xmath47 , as well as the prediction of the non existence of a stable helium molecule , but the ( qualitative ) description of more complex molecules required the formulations of additional key concepts .",
    "one - electron and three - electron bonds were introduced by pauling , in order to generalize the heitler - london resonance phenomenon to molecules with a number of valence electrons different from two , and the notion of _ directed valence _ later elaborated by j.c .",
    "slater @xcite and",
    "pauling @xcite was just an example ( among many others which appeared subsequently ) of how it is possible to manage complex molecular problems .",
    "two further important results were , instead , achieved by majorana ( and , independently , by pauling ) .",
    "he generalized the heitler - london theory to include ionic structures in homopolar compounds : exchange and polar interaction terms were combined in a single wavefunction with different weights , in order to properly describe the different contributions leading to the formation of a stable chemical bond . in a sense",
    ", this realized a bridge between mulliken - inspired molecular orbitals ( with their characteristic polar terms ) and heitler - london s valence theory .",
    "majorana also succeeded to prove theoretically the stability of the helium molecular ion , by extracting the appropriate symmetry properties of the molecular system and then building a suitable quantum theory within the conceptual framework of heitler - london s .",
    "although a number of other authors have contributed significantly to the development of quantum molecular physics , with results that have delineated and sharpened its subsequent shape , what discussed here remains the basic pillars of the theory , and we hope that the present paper has concurred to disentangle the intricate genesis of the quantum theory of the chemical bond ."
