    "models involving two - state quantum system has been extensively studied since the early days of quantum mechanics .",
    "nowadays , such models can be found in a variety of problems across quantum physics , ranging from nuclear magnetic resonance , coherent atomic excitation and quantum information to chemical physics , solid - state physics and neutrino oscillations .",
    "moreover , many problems involving multiple states and complicated linkage patterns can very often be understood only by reduction to one or more two - state problems shore90 .",
    "it is known , that the two - state problem with arbitrary time - dependent fields is related to the riccati equation and hence a general solution can not be derived .",
    "there are several exactly soluble two - state models , including the rabi rabi , landau - zener @xcite , rosen - zener @xcite , allen - eberly - hioe @xcite , bambini - berman @xcite , demkov - kunike @xcite , demkov demkov and nikitin @xcite models .",
    "because of the importance of the two - state models , the search for analytical solutions continues rostovtsev . due to its complexity",
    "most of these models use various special functions to solve the particular two - state problem .",
    "if this is not possible , there exist also methods for approximate solutions , such as adiabatic approximations , magnus approximation , dykhne - davis - pechukas approximation .    in the present work ,",
    "we derive analytically the transition probability for a two - state system driven by a pulsed external field with lorentzian temporal envelope and constant carrier frequency .",
    "the solution is expressed in terms of confluent heun functions .",
    "this field , for which no exact analytic solution was known yet , is among the most important pulsed fields . using delos - thorson approach",
    "presented solution can be extended to solution of class of models @xcite . despite the active research",
    "the heun equations and heun function have not been well studied .",
    "because of this the lorentzian model will also be investigated with the dykhne - davis - pechukas ( ddp ) method @xcite , which involves integration in the complex time plane , to derive a very accurate approximation to the transition probability and the width of the excitation line profile .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec - background ] we provide the basic equations and definitions and define the problem . in sec .",

    "the probability amplitudes in a two - state system @xmath0 ^{t}$ ] satisfy the schrdinger equation , @xmath1where the hamiltonian in the rotating - wave approximation ( rwa ) reads b.shore @xmath2@xmath3 .",
    "\\label{h2}\\]]the detuning @xmath4 measures the frequency offset of the field carrier frequency @xmath5 from the bohr transition frequency @xmath6 , @xmath7 .",
    "the rabi frequency @xmath8 quantifies the field - induced coupling between the two states .",
    "for example , for laser - atom excitation , @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the atomic transition dipole moment and @xmath11 is the laser electric field amplitude .",
    "we are interested in the case when the coupling has lorentzian shape and the detuning is constant ,    [ model ] @xmath12because the transition probability is an even function of @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , for simplicity and without loss of generality all these constants will be assumed positive .",
    "if the system is initially in state @xmath16 [ @xmath17 , @xmath18 , the transition probability after the interaction is given by @xmath19 ; its determination is our main concern .",
    "we shall derive below analytic solution for this model al well as several approximations to @xmath20 and calculate from them the period and the amplitude of the probability oscillations , the line shape @xmath21 and the linewidth @xmath22 .",
    "heun s differential equations , which is a second order ode of fuchsian type with four regular singular points has received renewed attention , together with its various confluent forms .",
    "it turns out the solution of the lorentzian model is closely related to the confluent heun equation ( che ) . generally speaking che",
    "can be obtained from the general heun equation by coalescing of two of the singular points by redefining certain parameters and taking the appropriate limits . in this way two regular singular points coalesce into one irregular point . for the lorentzian model this irregular singular point",
    "is located at infinity , where the initial conditions are imposed [ @xmath17 , @xmath23 $ ] .",
    "although the che is relatively well studied [ 23]-[29 ] , there are essential gaps in the theory and this results to some difficulties when the initial conditions for the lorentzian model are imposed . in general",
    "there are several canonical forms of the che .",
    "the second order differential equation for the lorentzian model we intend to solve can be cast to one of the equivalent forms of the che - so called generalized spheroidal wave equation ( gswe ) .",
    "hereafter , we will use the standart form of the gswe    @xmath24 u & = & 0 , \\notag\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath25 and @xmath5 are constants with the condition @xmath26 in the gswe @xmath27 and @xmath28 @xmath29 are regular singular points with indicial exponents respectively @xmath30 and @xmath31 . at infinity",
    "i.e. @xmath32 , gswe has irregular singular point . at this point",
    "the behavior of the two independent solutions can be derived from the thome normal solutions @xcite,@xcite and read    @xmath33      the exact analytical solution for the lorentzina model can be derived in terms of confluent heun functions . the differential equation corresponding to lorentzian model is given by@xmath34    using the substitution@xmath35    the solution to the loretnzian differential equation eq.([delrtz ] )",

    "for the derivation of the transition probability we shall need the adiabatic basis , i.e. the basis of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian ( [ hc ] ) .",
    "we summarize below the basic definitions and properties of this basis .",
    "in terms of the mixing angle @xmath40 , defined as @xmath41 the eigenstates of @xmath42 read    [ adiabatic states ] @xmath43 the time dependences of the adiabatic states @xmath44 and latexmath:[$%    @xmath40 , whereas the bare ( diabatic ) states @xmath46 and @xmath47 are stationary .    because the rabi frequency @xmath8 vanishes at large times , and because @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 ; hence    [ diabatic - adiabatic ] latexmath:[\\ ] ] where the overdots denote time derivatives .",
    "we shall estimate the transition probability @xmath20 for the gaussian model ( [ model ] ) by using the dykhne - davis - pechukas ( ddp ) approximation .",
    "the ddp formula @xcite provides the asymptotically exact transition probability between the adiabatic states in the adiabatic limit .",
    "we shall use this formula to calculate the transition probability @xmath64 in the original , diabatic basis because , as we discussed above , the transition probabilities in the adiabatic and diabatic bases are equal .",
    "the ddp formula reads @xmath65 where @xmath66 the point @xmath67 is called the transition point and it is defined as the ( complex ) zero of the quasienergy splitting , @xmath68 which lies in the upper half of the complex @xmath69-plane ( i.e. , with @xmath70 ) .",
    "equation ( [ dp-1 ] ) gives the correct asymptotic probability for nonadiabatic transitions provided : ( i ) the quasienergy splitting @xmath71 does not vanish for real @xmath72 , including at @xmath73 ; ( ii ) @xmath74 is analytic and single - valued at least throughout a region of the complex @xmath69-plane that includes the region from the real axis to the transition point @xmath67 ; ( iii ) the transition point @xmath67 is well separated from the other quasienergy zero points ( if any ) and from possible singularities ; ( iv ) there exists a level ( or stokes ) line defined by @xmath75 which goes from @xmath76 to @xmath77 and passes through @xmath78 .    as has been pointed out already by davis and pechukas @xcite , for the landau - zener model @xcite , which possesses a single transition point , the ddp formula ( [ dp-1 ] ) gives the exact transition probability , not only in the adiabatic limit but also in the general case .",
    "this amazing feature indicates not only the relevance of the ddp approximation , but raises an intriguing , yet unanswered question : how can a ( first - order ) approximate method provide the exact solution ?      in the case of more than one zero points in the upper @xmath69-plane , davis and pechukas @xcite have suggested , following george and lin george74 , that eq .",
    "( [ dp-1 ] ) can be generalized to include the contributions from all these @xmath79 zero points @xmath80 in a coherent sum .",
    "this suggestion has been later verified by joye _",
    "_ @xcite and suominen _ et al",
    ". _ suominen91,suominen92pra , suominen92oc , suominenthesis .",
    "the generalized ddp formula has the form @xmath81 where @xmath82 are phase factors defined by @xmath83    in principle , eq .",
    "( [ dp - n ] ) should be used when there are more than one transition points lying on the lowest stokes line ( the closest one to the real axis ) and should include in principle only the contributions from these points ; moreover , eq .",
    "( [ dp - n ] ) has been rigorously proved only for these transition points @xcite .",
    "another open question for the ddp method is the parameter range where it applies .",
    "strictly , the ddp approximation , being a perturbative result in the adiabatic basis , should be valid only near the adiabatic limit . for a gaussian field",
    "this implies the range defined by the adiabatic condition ( [ adiabatic condition gaussian ] ) .",
    "however , we shall see that the ddp approximation describes very accurately the transition probability well outside this range , virtually for any parameter values , which follows similar earlier successes of this approximation for other models ( for some of which , as we discussed , it provides even the exact result ) . this accuracy of the ddp approximation well beyond the adiabatic regime , essentially in the entire parameter plane , is another open question .      for the lorentzian model ( [ model ] )",
    ", the transition points in the upper half - plane in terms of the dimensionless time @xmath84 are given by @xmath85where @xmath86        figure [ stokes ] displays the stokes lines , defined by eq .",
    "( stokes line ) . for the lorentzian model the zeroes of the eigenenergy splitting @xmath87 are simple , and because of the presence of the square root in @xmath87",
    ", there are three stokes lines emerging from each transition point @xcite .",
    "the lowest stokes line , which connects @xmath88 and @xmath89 and extends from @xmath90 to @xmath91 , is the most significant one because it is used in the derivation of the ddp approximation @xcite and its existence validates the approximation @xcite .      for the lorentzian model we have @xmath92 and",
    "because @xmath93 is an even function of time , it is easy to show that @xmath94that is @xmath95 and @xmath96 .",
    "hence it is sufficient to calculate only one of these integrals and we choose @xmath97 for this purpose .    because the imaginary part of the ddp integral @xmath98 is the same for the two transition points @xmath89 and @xmath88 [ cf .",
