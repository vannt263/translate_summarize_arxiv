    "the ability to measure accurate chemical abundances in h  ii regions in our own and other galaxies is vital for our understanding of their chemical evolution .",
    "emission lines emitted by the nebular gas photoionised by massive stars provide us with powerful metallicity indicators for near and intermediate redshift galaxies .",
    "the major complication is posed by the critical task of determining the physical parameters of the nebula , in particular the electron temperature , @xmath0 .",
    "failure to achieve realistic estimates may lead to gross errors in the final abundance determination .",
    "temperature fluctuations within the nebula may be an important cause of error .",
    "collisionally excited lines ( cels ) , which are routinely used in abundance studies , are naturally weighted towards hotter regions and may therefore lead to underestimating of the real abundances .",
    "recombination lines ( rls ) are less affected by errors in temperature determinations , and should in theory yield more accurate results .",
    "one of the outstanding problems in nebular astrophysics is the discrepancy between abundances and electron temperature estimates obtained from cels or rls in planetary nebulae ( pne ) ( e.g. rubin et al . 2002 ; wesson , liu & barlow 2005 ; ercolano et al .",
    "2005 ; liu et al .",
    "2006 ; peimbert & peimbert 2006 and references therein ) , galactic and magellanic h  ii regions ( e.g. peimbert , peimbert & ruiz 2000 ; peimbert 2003 ; tsamis et al .",

    "2005 , 2006 ) and extragalactic h   ii regions ( e.g. peimbert & peimbert 2003 ; peimbert , peimbert & ruiz 2005 ) . the cause of this discrepancy is still uncertain ; temperature fluctuations and chemical inhomogeneities in the gas have both been advocated to explain the discrepancy .",
    "photoionisation models including chemical inhomogeneities have been successful in matching the observed cel and rl spectra of some pne ( e.g. ercolano et al .",
    "2003b ) and h   ii regions ( tsamis & pquignot 2005 ) .",
    "however the discrepancy between the abundances derived from recombination lines ( rl ) and those derived from cels has been also been attributed to temperature fluctuations _ not _ caused by abundance inhomogeneities ( e.g. garca - rojas et al .",
    "the @xmath1 parameter ( peimbert , 1967 ; peimbert & costero 1969 ; peimbert 1971 ) , introduced in order to quantify such fluctuations , can be derived empirically by the comparison of temperatures obtained from the depth of the balmer jump to those obtained from cels .",
    "although the situation for h  ii regions is notoriously less worrying than for pne , the problem still remains that empirically determined @xmath1 values are larger than those indicated by chemically homogeneous photoionisation models , indicating that the causes of the proposed temperature fluctuations are still not understood .",
    "aside from temperature fluctuations the task of obtaining reliable abundance estimates from cel spectra of h  ii regions is further complicated by the fact that often the complete set of emission lines needed for a direct measurement of the electron temperatures is not available for all sources ; the 4363   line of @xmath2o  iii@xmath3 $ ] and the 5755   line of @xmath2n  ii@xmath3 $ ] are weak and therefore not detected if the spectra do not have good signal - to - noise or if the metallicities are high , implying low electron temperatures .",
    "a large effort has been made to provide metallicity and temperature indicators based on various combinations of strong lines ( e.g. pagel et al .",

    "hgele et al .",
    "( 2006 ) have recently proposed a new methodology for the production and calibration of empirical relations between the different line temperatures based on observational data alone .",
    "however the data sets available are still too limited to provide usable indicators .",
    "currently , calibrations of metallicity indicators and ionic temperature relations are generally not based on observational data alone , but make use of grids of photoionisation models , run for a range of metallicities and ionisation parameters ( e.g. mcgaugh 1991 , charlot & longhetti 2001 , kewley & dopita 2002 ) . given the vast parameter space generally under investigation ,",
    "most studies so far have been carried out with spherically symmetric or plane parallel geometries , with major limitations on the allowed density distribution and with the spatial distribution of the ionising sources not being investigated .",
    "nearby h  ii regions , however , show complex structures in the distribution of gas and stars , which are often intermixed .    in this paper",
    "we carry out a theoretical investigation of the importance of the effects due to the spatial distribution of the ionising sources via the construction of a number of 3d photoionisation models , using the mocassin code ( ercolano et al . 2003a , 2005 ) for simple gas density distributions and three spatial configurations for the ionisation sources .",
    "our modelling strategy is described in section  2 .",
    "temperature fluctuations are estimated for our models by computing theoretical @xmath1 and @xmath4 values ( peimbert , 1967 ) for each of our models and the results are given and discussed in section  3 . in this section we also compare integrated emission line spectra from such configurations to search for systematic errors which may be caused by the simplifying assumption of a single , central location for all ionising sources .",

    "these models could also be performed using a 1d code , with a spherically symmetric gas density distribution . similarly",
    "a 1d code could also be employed for case f models where the strmgren spheres do not generally overlap ; the left panel of figure  [ fig : dist ] shows a 3d representation of the strmgren sphere distribution for case f , plotted as iso - surfaces where the ionisation fraction of hydrogen is 0.95 .",

    "these scaling laws are often employed in abundance studies when observational data for a given ionic zone is missing .",
    "some of the most popular relations we found in the literature include t@xmath25(s  iii ) vs t@xmath25(ar  iii ) , t@xmath25(o  iii ) vs t@xmath25(ar  iii ) , t@xmath25(o  ii ) vs t@xmath25(n  ii ) .",
    "these ratios are expected to be around unity and we found them to be very little affected by the shifts in temperatures due to the spatial distribution of stars .",
    "this is not surprising , given that the ionic species involved are both high ( o  iii , s   iii , ar  iii and n  iii ) or low ( o  ii and n   ii ) , and therefore while the absolute temperature values in each case may shift to higher or lower values , the resulting ratios remain virtually unaffected .",
    "scaling laws have also been derived for t@xmath25(o  iii ) vs t@xmath25(s  iii ) and t@xmath25(o  iii ) vs t@xmath25(o  ii ) , by garnett ( 1992 ) , based on his own grids of photoionisation models and those by stasiska ( 1982 ) .",
    "more recently , izotov et al . ( 2006 ) produced somewhat different relations between t@xmath25(o  ii ) and t@xmath25(o  iii ) , and between t@xmath25(s  iii ) and t@xmath25(o  ii ) ( their eqs .",
    "14 and 15 , valid only for metal poor cases to 12  +  log(o / h )  @xmath21  8.2 ) , based on a set of up - to - date ( but still spherically symmetric ) photoionisation models that reproduce the observed trends of metal - poor galaxies .",
    "they found that the observed values of t@xmath25(o  ii ) , t@xmath25(o  iii ) and t@xmath25(s  iii ) in a large sample of h  ii galaxies reproduce the theoretical relations , but with a large scatter ( not only attributable to observational errors in the case of t@xmath25(o  ii ) , t@xmath25(o  iii ) , see their figures  4a and b ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : temprel ] shows the behaviour of our z / z@xmath5  = 1.0 and 2.0 ( left panel , black and magenta symbols respectively ) and z / z@xmath5  = 0.05 , 0.2 and 0.4 ( right panel , blue , green and red symbols , respectively ) metallicity models for cases c , h and f with regards to the t@xmath25(o  ii ) versus t@xmath25(o  iii ) scaling laws of garnett ( 1992 , black solid line in both panels ) and izotov et al .",

    "their t(o   iii ) versus t(o  ii ) relations given in their eqns  14 are therefore plotted in blue in the right panel of our figure  [ fig : temprel ] , with the thinner and thicker curves indicating the 7.2 and 7.6 metallicity bin , respectively .",
    "our z / z@xmath5  =  0.4 metallicity bin ( red symbols ) corresponds to 12  +  log(o / h)=  8.29 , slightly above izotov s 12  +  log(o / h )  =  8.2 bin which , nevertheless is represented by the red line in figure  [ fig : temprel ] .",
    "a mixed relation such as t@xmath25(o  iii ) vs t@xmath25(o  ii ) is much more affected by the fact that low and high ionic temperatures shift in opposite directions for intermediate ( red points ; z / z@xmath5  =  0.4 ) and high metallicities ( magenta and black points ; z / z@xmath5  =  2 and 1 ) .",
    "this will contribute to the scatter noticed observationally for this relation .",
    "for example , kennicutt , bresolin & garnett ( 2003 ) presented a study of those h  ii regions in m  101 for which direct measurements of the nebular auroral lines could be obtained .",
    "they found the t@xmath25(o  iii ) vs t@xmath25(s  iii ) relation to be matched closely by their observations , whereas the t@xmath25(o   iii ) and t@xmath25(o  ii ) temperatures turned out to be rather uncorrelated .",
    "it is also worth noting at this point tht another factor that could contribute to the scatter in the t@xmath25(o  iii ) vs t@xmath25(o  ii ) relation is the dependency of t@xmath25(o  ii ) on the electron density ( prez - montero & daz 2003 ) .",
    "the scatter found by our models is for a given electron density , and therefore it may be even larger for a different sample covering a wider range of densities .",
    "the ionising flux distribution is certainly a factor that contributes to weakening the correlation , however , as pointed out by stasiska ( 2005 ) , at high metallicities , the temperature derived from the @xmath2o  ii@xmath3 $ ] line ratio may by strongly in error due to the contribution of recombination from o@xmath26 .",
    "we have assessed that the geometrical distribution of stars within an h  ii region plays a role in the temperature structure of the gas , the magnitude of these effects will clearly be dependent on the total mass of the stars and the concentration level .",
    "it is important now to verify the robustness of commonly used metallicity indicator against these temperature shifts .",
    "in particular we are interested in identifying systematic trends with stellar distribution rather than absolute errors .",
    "table  [ tab : abun ] lists the _",
    "empirical _ oxygen abundances obtained using 6 different indicators .",
    "we used the following calibrations for the 6 indicators : ( 1 ) o@xmath27  pilyugin ( 2000 , 2001b ) , ( 2 ) o@xmath28n@xmath29  stasiska ( 2006 ) , ( 3 ) n@xmath29  pettini & pagel ( 2004 ) , ( 4 ) s@xmath27  prez - montero & daz ( 2005 ) , ( 5 ) s@xmath28o@xmath28  stasiska ( 2006 ) , ( 6 ) ar@xmath28o@xmath28  stasiska ( 2006 ) .",
    "it is worth reiterating at this point that metallicity indicators should , and generally are , only used for statistical studies as the error on a single region may be very large ; the models presented in this work do not attempt to cover the full parameter space occupied by h  ii regions and therefore do not aim at identifying the most accurate indicator _ in absolute terms_. here we are mainly interested in studying a possible systematic error in the derived abundances introduced by the 3d stellar distribution . for this reason for each trio of models ( c , h and f for a given density distribution and metallicity )",
    "we compute @xmath30 , the largest difference between the oxygen abundance in log units derived from cases c , h and f.    the results are summarised in table  [ tab : abun ] , where the mean values @xmath31 are also listed . for all metallicity indicators apart from o@xmath27 , there is a clear trend for higher metallicity being derived from models ionised by fully distributed sources , case f , than from case c and h models .",
    "the reverse is true for o@xmath27 , where metallicities derived from case f models are smaller than those derived from case c and h models .",
    "the @xmath30 values at a given metallicity vary from one indicator to the next , however they are rarely below @xmath210.1  dex ( only for the highest metallicity case ) , with more representative values around 0.3  dex for the spherical case , but often larger than 0.4 ( and larger than 1.1  dex in one case ) .",
    "these deviations are slightly smaller for the shell density distributions ; this is obvious as even for f cases most of the ionising radiation in these models will be emitted from the central cavity , reducing the differences between c and f cases .",
    "we note that in some cases the values given by the case h models are lower than those given by the respective case c models ( rather than being equal or in the middle between c and f ) .",
    "we have analysed these deviations statistically and can confirm that the small differences are simply due to the variance of our monte carlo models and do not bear any physical significance .",
    "the reason for the systematic effect we see in the _ empirical _ abundance determinations can be understood by re - examining figure  [ fig : val2 ] , where the ionisation sequence of our model is parametrised in terms of oxygen and sulphur emission lines .",
    "the c ( small symbols ) , h ( medium symbols ) and f ( large symbols ) form a sequence , with the case f models generally showing a lower ionisation parameter than case c and h models .",
    "the differences in the abundances derived from case c to f with the various indicators clearly reflect the different dependence of each indicator on the ionisation parameter .",
    "this can be simply shown for an idealised system .",
    "the ionisation parameter of a pure - hydrogen spherical volume of gas with number density @xmath32 ionised by a source emitting @xmath33 hydrogen - ionising photons per second is defined as @xmath34  =  @xmath33/(4@xmath35 ) , where @xmath36 is the strmgren radius .",
    "in such a system , from the ionisation balance equation ( e.g. osterbrock , 1989 , eqn 2.19 ) @xmath36 is directly proportional to @xmath37 and to @xmath38 , neglecting the temperature dependence of the hydrogen recombination coefficient . for simplicity",
    "we compare the ionisation parameter of the system above , @xmath39 , ionised by only one source , to that of a similar system ( f ) ionised by @xmath40 identical sources each emitting @xmath33/@xmath40 hydrogen - ionising photons per second . with these assumptions",
    "it is easy to show that the ionisation parameter , @xmath41 , for system f , measured at the strmgren radius of each individual source is simply related to @xmath39 by @xmath42 and therefore always smaller than @xmath39 for @xmath43    the magnitude of the errors in the metallicity derived by the strong line methods are significant .",
    "it is , however , true that the effects reported here represent a worst case scenario , and our extreme assumptions on stellar populations create a large dispersion in the resulting ionisation parameters , which in some cases exceeds the observed range , as seen in figures  [ fig : val1 ] and [ fig : val2 ] . aside from the magnitude of the @xmath30 values , however , a worrying aspect is the fact that the discrepancies between cases c , h and f are systematic .",
    "this can have an impact on galactic metallicity gradients determined via strong line methods , if these are calibrated via photoionisation models .",
    "in fact , if compact clusters ( close to case c ) and loose associations ( close to case f ) are randomly distributed throughout a given galaxy , then the systematic errors would only cause a larger scatter in the observed metallicities , but , given sufficient number statistics , they would not affect the measured metallicity gradient .",
    "however if the ratios of compact clusters to loose associations is somewhat dependent on the galactocentric distance , then the systematic errors due to stellar geometrical distributions may indeed introduce a bias on the measured galactic metallicity gradient , if the abundances are obtained from strong line methods calibrated on ab - initio models which do not reproduce the observed excitation of h  ii regions .",
    "for example , recent work by rosolowsky et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , presenting high resolution molecular gas maps of m33 , showed a truncation in the mass distribution of giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) at a galactocentric distance of 4  kpc . a recent study on the demographics of young star - forming clusters in m33 by bastian et al .",
    "( 2007 ) also shows the same cut - off at 4  kpc for the clusters detected .",
    "we could interpret this as tentative evidence of different star formation environments from the centre to the edge of m33 , however , we prefer to postpone this discussion until more compelling observational evidence becomes available .",
    "following our theoretical investigation on the effects of the spatial configuration of ionisation sources on the temperature structure of h  ii regions , we summarise our conclusions as follows :    1 .   for intermediate to high metallicities ( 0.4@xmath44  2 ) , for a given gas density distribution , abundance and ionising spectral shape and intensity , a model with a central concentration of stars ( case c ) will result in higher ionic temperatures for high ionisation species ( o@xmath45 , s@xmath45 etc .",
    ") , compared to the same model with stars fully distributed within the volume ( case f ) .",
    "the opposite is true for low ionisation species ( e.g. o@xmath46 , n@xmath46 ) .",
    "this results in a shallower gradients in the electron temperature distribution across the ionic species zones .",
    "2 .   low metallicity models ( z / z@xmath47  0.2 ) do not show the temperature inversion from low to high ionic species zones , rather a shift in the temperature is experienced by all ionic species zones , resulting in case f models being cooler than case c and h models .",
    "3 .   at intermediate to high metallicity ( @xmath48 ) ,",
    "models with stars distributed within the full volume are more isothermal ( show lower @xmath1 values ) than the same models with a central concentration of stars .",
    "these temperature `` fluctuations '' obtained for case c models are a simple consequence of a large temperature gradient .",
    "multiple ionising sources of different temperatures at central or non - central locations do not produce significant temperature fluctuations in the ionised gas of models with @xmath48 .",
    "4 .   at low metallicities ( @xmath49 ) , models with stars distributed within the full volume ( case f )",
    "show _ larger _ @xmath1 values than the same models with a central concentration of stars . here",
    "we are seeing the effects of true temperature `` fluctuations '' for case f models .",
    "the magnitude of @xmath50 remains however too small to have any significant effect on derived abundances .",
    "multiple ionising sources of different temperatures at central or non - central locations are not the cause of significant temperature fluctuations in the ionised gas of our models with @xmath51 .",
    "the relation @xmath1(o@xmath14 ) = @xmath1(o@xmath45 ) , often used in empirical studies , is not verified by our models .",
    "extreme care should be taken to account for the uncertainties introduced by the use of this relation in studies seeking to apply corrections to cel - derived abundances making use of an empirical estimation of temperature fluctuations .",
    "for our @xmath15  =  2 models , @xmath1(o@xmath45 ) is always a factor of 2 or more higher than @xmath1(o@xmath14 ) , while for lower metallicities @xmath1(o@xmath45 ) becomes lower than @xmath1(o@xmath14 ) sometimes by large factors ( up to approximately 10 ) .",
    "7 .   for intermediate to high metallicity models , electron temperatures in the o@xmath45 and o@xmath46 ionisation zones",
    "are shifted in opposite directions , contributing to the scatter observed in the @xmath52 versus @xmath53 relation .",
    "we confirm that h  ii region abundances derived on the basis of the t@xmath25(o  ii ) alone should , therefore , be considered highly uncertain . 8 .",
    "metallicity indicators calibrated by grids of spherically symmetric photoionisation models may suffer a systematic bias , due to their dependence on the ionisation parameter of the system .",
    "for the same input parameters case f models will always result in smaller ionisation parameters than case c and h models .",
    "the errors estimated in this work ( typically 0.3  dex , but larger in some cases ) are likely to represent the worst - case scenario , but nevertheless their magnitude and their systematic nature does not allow them to be ignored .    *",
