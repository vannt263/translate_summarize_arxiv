    "in this paper , we are interested in mixing properties ( in particular , _ decay of correlations _ ) of non - uniformly expanding maps .",
    "much progress has been made in recent years , with upper estimates being obtained for many examples of such systems .",
    "almost invariably , these estimates are for observables which are hlder continuous .",

    "it is well known that for any non - trivial mixing system , there exist @xmath2 for which correlations decay arbitrarily slowly .",
    "for this reason , we must restrict at least one of the observables to some smaller class of functions , in order to get an upper bound for @xmath5 .    here",

    "young ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are many examples of systems which admit such towers , and we shall see that under a fairly weak assumption on the relationship between the tower and the system ( which is satisfied in all the examples we mention ) we get estimates for certain classes of observables with respect to the system itself .",
    "one of the main strengths of this method is that these classes of observables may be defined purely in terms of their regularity with respect to the manifold ; this contrasts with some results , where regularity is considered with respect to some markov partition .",

    "for a given function @xmath7 , for each @xmath8 we write @xmath9 we see that @xmath10 as @xmath11 if and only if @xmath4 is uniformly continuous .",
    "we define classes of functions corresponding to different rates of decay for @xmath12 , as follows :    _ class @xmath13 , @xmath14 $ ] : _",

    "note @xmath28 is the class of functions which are hlder continuous .",
    "also note that @xmath29 with the inclusions strict , and in fact @xmath30 for every @xmath31 , with @xmath32 in the appropriate interval .",
    "it is not difficult to find observables with exactly any of these regularities ; for instance , the function @xmath33 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}$ ] given by @xmath34 for some @xmath21 , has the property that @xmath35 for all small @xmath36 .",
    "before we state the exact technical result , we shall illustrate its implications by stating results for a number of different classes of system . in each case , the estimate given for hlder continuous observables ( i.e. case ( r1 ) ) has been obtained previously , but we are able to give estimates for observables in each of the other classes , most of which are new .",
    "often the same estimates given in the hlder case also apply to one of the larger classes ; it seems that when the rate of mixing for hlder observables is sub - exponential , we can expect the same rate of mixing to hold for a larger class of observables .",
    "for instance , when hlder observables give polynomial mixing , we tend to get the same speed of mixing for observables in some class ( r4,@xmath32 ) , @xmath21 .",
    "all of our results shall take the following form .",
    "given a system @xmath37 , a mixing acip @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , @xmath40 , for some class @xmath41 as above , we obtain in each example an estimate of the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the usual norm on @xmath44 , @xmath45 is a constant depending on @xmath46 and @xmath4 , and @xmath47 is some sequence decaying to zero with rate determined by @xmath46 and @xmath48 .",
    "notice that we make no assumption on the regularity of the observable @xmath49 ; when discussing the regularity class of observables , we shall always be referring to the choice of the function @xmath4 .",
    "( this is not atypical , although some existing results do require that both functions have some minimum regularity . )    for brevity , we shall simply give an estimate for @xmath50 in the statement of each result .",
    "for each example we also have a central limit theorem for those observables which give summable decay of correlations , and are not coboundaries .",
    "we recall that a real - valued observable @xmath4 _ satisfies the central limit theorem _ for @xmath46 if there exists @xmath51 such that for every interval @xmath52 , @xmath53    note that the range of examples given in the following subsections is meant to be illustrative rather than exhaustive , and so we shall miss out some simple generalisations for which essentially the same results hold .",
    "we shall instead try to make clear the conditions needed to apply these results , and direct the reader to the papers mentioned below for further examples which satisfy these conditions .",
    "[ examples ]      let @xmath54 be a @xmath55-diffeomorphism of a compact riemannian manifold .",
    "we say @xmath46 is _ uniformly expanding _ if there exists @xmath56 such that @xmath57 for all @xmath58 , and all tangent vectors @xmath59 .",

    "furthermore , the central limit theorem holds when @xmath25 for sufficiently large @xmath32 , depending on @xmath74 .",
    "such maps are generally regarded as being well understood , and in particular , results of exponential decay of correlations for observables in @xmath28 go back to the seventies , and the work of sinai , ruelle and bowen ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . for a more modern perspective , see for instance the books of baladi ( @xcite ) and viana ( @xcite ) .",
    "i have not seen explicit claims of similar results for observables in classes @xmath75 .",
    "however , it is well known that any such map can be coded by a one - sided full shift on finitely many symbols , so an analogous result on shift spaces would be sufficient , and may well already exist .",
    "the estimates here are probably not sharp , particularly in the @xmath76 case .",
    "the other examples we consider are not in general reducible to finite alphabet shift maps , so we can be more confident that the next set of results are new .",

    "our strategy in proving the above theorem is to generalise a _ coupling _ method introduced by young in @xcite .",
    "our argument follows closely the line of approach of that paper , and we give an outline of the key ideas here .",
    "first , we need to reduce the problem to one in a slightly different context . given a system @xmath175",
    ", we define a _ transfer operator _ @xmath258 which , for any measure @xmath259 on @xmath182 for which @xmath189 is measurable , gives a measure @xmath260 on @xmath182 defined by @xmath261 whenever @xmath262 is a @xmath259-measurable set .",
    "clearly any @xmath189-invariant measure is a fixed point for this operator .",
    "also , a key property of @xmath258 is that for any function @xmath263 , @xmath264    next , we define a _ variation norm _ on @xmath211-absolutely continuous _ signed measures _ , that is , on the difference between any two ( positive ) measures which are absolutely continuous . given two such measures @xmath265 , we write @xmath266 now let us fix an acip @xmath38 and choose observables @xmath267 , @xmath268 , with @xmath269 , @xmath270 .",
    "we have @xmath271 where @xmath272 denotes the unique measure which has density @xmath4 with respect to @xmath38 .",
    "so @xmath273    hence we may reduce the problem to one of estimating the rate at which certain measures converge to the invariant measure , in terms of the variation norm .",
    "in fact , it will be useful to consider the more general question of estimating @xmath274 for a pair of measures @xmath259 , @xmath275 whose densities with respect to @xmath211 are of some given regularity .",
    "( we shall require an estimate in the case @xmath276 when we consider the central limit theorem . )",
    "let us now outline the main argument .",
    "we work with two copies of the system , and the direct product @xmath277 .",
    "let @xmath278 , and consider it to be a measure on @xmath279 .",
    "if we let @xmath280 be the projections onto the first and second coordinates respectively , we have that @xmath281    our strategy will involve summing the differences between the two projections over small regions of the space , only comparing them at convenient times that vary with the region of space we are considering . at each of these times , we shall subtract some measure from both coordinates so that the difference is unaffected , yet the total measure of @xmath282 is reduced , giving an improved upper bound on the difference .    the key difference between our method and that of @xcite is that we introduce a sequence @xmath283 , which shall represent the rate at which we attempt to subtract measure from @xmath282 .",
    "when the densities of @xmath259 , @xmath275 are of class @xmath284 , @xmath283 can be taken to be a small constant , and the method here reduces to that of @xcite ; however , by allowing sequences @xmath285 , we may also consider measure densities of weaker regularity .",

    "the density of @xmath282 with respect to @xmath294 has essentially the same regularity as the measures @xmath259 , @xmath275 , and the density of @xmath293 will be similar , except possibly weakened slightly by any irregularity in the map @xmath289 .",

    "we fix an @xmath306 , and perform this subtraction of measure for each @xmath291 , obtaining a measure @xmath307 defined on @xmath308 .",
    "the total mass of @xmath307 represents the difference between @xmath309 and @xmath310 at time @xmath311 , taking into account that @xmath312 is not constant over @xmath279 .",
    "clearly , we obtain the best upper bound by taking @xmath313 ; however , we shall see that it is to our advantage to choose some smaller value for @xmath306 .",
    "we choose a sequence @xmath283 , and proceed inductively as follows .",
    "first , we define a sequence of partitions @xmath314 such that @xmath315 is mapped injectively onto @xmath316 under @xmath317 .",
    "now given the measure @xmath318 , we take an element @xmath315 and consider the measure @xmath319 on @xmath288 . here , we let @xmath320 and specify @xmath321 by @xmath322    as before , we construct a measure @xmath323 , the total mass of which gives an upper bound at time @xmath324 . to fully determine the sequence @xmath325",
    ", it remains to choose a sequence @xmath326 .",
    "our choice relates to the regularity of the densities @xmath327 .",
    "this is relevant because the method requires that the family of measure densities @xmath328 has some uniform regularity .",
    "( in fact , we require that the @xmath329 of each of the above densities is suitably regular . )",
    "we require this in order that at the @xmath330th stage of the procedure , when we subtract an @xmath331 proportion of the minimum local density , this corresponds to a similarly large proportion of the average density .",
    "hence , provided this regularity is maintained , the total mass of @xmath318 is decreased by a similar proportion .",
    "when we subtract a constant from a density as above , this weakens the regularity .",
    "however , at the next step of the procedure , we work with elements of the partition @xmath332 .",
    "since these sets are smaller , we regain some regularity by working with measures on @xmath288 pushed forward from such sets .",
    "that is , we expect the densities @xmath333 to be more regular than the densities @xmath334 ( this relies on the map @xmath289 being smooth enough that another application of the operator @xmath335 does nt much affect the regularity . )    the degree of regularity we gain in this way depends on the initial regularity of @xmath336 , and hence of @xmath327 , with respect to the sequence of partitions . in the usual case , where @xmath337 , the regularity we gain each time we refine the partition is similar to the regularity we lose when we subtract a small constant proportion of the density ; hence we may take every @xmath331 to be a small constant @xmath36 .",
    "where the initial regularities are not so good , we gain less regularity from refining the partition , and so we may only subtract correspondingly less measure .",
    "for this reason , outside the @xmath284 case we shall require that the sequence @xmath326 converges to zero at some minimum rate .",
    "however , if @xmath326 decays faster than necessary , we will simply obtain a suboptimal bound .",
    "so part of the problem is to try to choose a sequence @xmath326 decaying as slowly as is permissible .",
    "we shall also need to take into account the stopping time @xmath312 ( which is unbounded ) , in order to estimate the speed of convergence in terms of the original map @xmath189 .",
    "let us now mention some other results concerning estimates on decay of correlations for non - hlder observables .",
    "most of these are stated in the context of one - sided finite alphabet shift maps , or subshifts of finite type .",
    "( for a comprehensive discussion of shift maps and equilibrium measures , we suggest the book of baladi , @xcite . )",
    "shift maps are relatively simple dynamical systems , but are often used to _ code _",
    "more complicated systems via a semi - conjugacy , in much the same way that each of the examples we consider can be represented by a suitable _ tower _ ( see [ applications ] ) .",
    "where a system @xmath338 being coded has an invariant measure @xmath60 which is absolutely continuous with respect to lebesgue measure , @xmath60 is an equilibrium measure for the potential @xmath339 , where @xmath340 is the jacobian with respect to lebesgue measure .",
    "most results for shift maps work with an equilibruim measure given by a potential @xmath341 which is hlder continuous ( in terms of the usual metric on shift spaces - two sequences are said to be distance @xmath342 apart if they agree for exactly the first @xmath27 symbols ) .",
    "this assumption corresponds to assuming good distortion for @xmath340 .",
    "the have been various results concerned primarily with weakening the assumption on the regularity of @xmath341 , and obtaining ( slower ) upper bounds for the rate of mixing with respect to the corresponding equilibrium measures .",
    "kondah , maume and schmitt ( @xcite ) used a method of birkhoff cones and projective metrics , bressaud , fernandez and galves ( @xcite ) used a coupling method ( different from the one described here ) , with estimates given in terms of _ chains of complete connections _ , and pollicott ( @xcite ) introduced a method involving composing transfer operators with conditional expectations .",
    "each of these results has slightly different assumptions and gives slightly different estimates , but in each case a number of different classes of potentials are considered , and estimates are given for for observables of some similar regularity to ( usually _ not much worse _ than ) the potential .",
    "in particular , in all three examples polynomial mixing is given for a potential and observables with variations decaying at suitable polynomial rates .",
    "in addition , fisher and lopes ( @xcite ) and isola ( @xcite ) have obtained polynomial decay of correlations for some specific classes of potentials on the full 2-shift , each for a class of observables not unlike our @xmath343 class .",
    "we emphasise that each of the above results concerns only shifts ( or subshifts ) on a _ finite alphabet_. furthermore , with the exception of uniformly expanding maps (  [ uniform ] ) , none of the examples we consider may be coded ( with a sufficiently regular semi - conjugacy ) by shifts with finite alphabets , due to distortion considerations . hence outside the uniform case",
    ", there is no direct overlap between the above results and our results .",
    "these are essentially generalisations in a different direction , but are worth mentioning if only to note the variety of different methods that have been applied to obtain results for non - hlder observables in slightly different contexts .",
    "we now move on from shift spaces to mention a result on towers . following the method of @xcite mentioned above ,",
    "maume - deschamps ( @xcite ) essentially reproduced young s results ( @xcite ) , with some slightly weaker estimates .",
    "together with buzzi ( @xcite ) , the method has been extended to allow the bounded distortion assumption of  [ towers ] to be replaced by a condition on the variation of @xmath340 , and also to allow observables of similar regularity .",
    "one important difference is that the variation is defined in terms of @xmath340 and a partition of the whole tower ( the partition @xmath188 of  [ towers ] ) rather than @xmath203 and the base partition , as here .",
    "this significantly reduces the classes of observables they can consider ; for instance , for any tower with unbounded return times , our class @xmath284 contains many functions that can not be dealt with at all by their method .",
    "it is not clear that any estimates can be obtained for our examples , except for the uniformly expanding case ; for manneville - pomeau maps , for instance ( see  [ indifferent ] ) , while we can construct the same tower in their context , the semi - conjugacy between the tower and the system is not regular enough to give any comparable results .",
    "some applications are given in the related paper @xcite , including certain multi - dimensional piecewise expanding affine maps .",
    "we also note that a similar result to that of @xcite was obtained by holland ( @xcite ) , using a coupling method very similar to the one we use here .    finally , we mention a result which applies directly to certain non - uniformly expanding systems , rather than to a symbolic space or tower .",
    "pollicott and yuri ( @xcite ) consider a class of maps of arbitrary dimension with a single indifferent periodic orbit and a given markov structure , including in particular the manneville - pomeau interval maps .",
    "the class of observables considered is dynamically defined ; each observable is required to be lipschitz with respect to a markov partition corresponding to some induced map , chosen to have good distortion properties .",
    "this class includes all functions which are lipschitz with respect to the manifold , and while some estimates are weaker than comparable results for hlder observables , bounds are obtained for some observables which can not be dealt with at all by our methods , such as certain unbounded functions .",
    "over the next few sections , we give the proof of the main technical theorem .",
