    "the main rings of saturn are composed of numerous icy particles and exhibit many different patterns , including non - axisymmetric structures on sub - kilometer scales .",
    "gravitational forces between particles form gravitationally bound clumps , while differential rotation tears them apart . due to these competing processes ,",
    "spatial structures called gravitational or self - gravity wakes appear @xcite .",
    "@xcite performed the first investigations of self - gravity wakes using @xmath0-body simulations .",
    "the typical radial scale of the wakes is comparable to the critical wavelength of gravitational instability @xcite , which is around several tens to hundred meters .",
    "their azimuthal scale is much longer than their radial scale .    even though individual wakes are tiny structures , together they can have detectable influence on the large - scale photometric properties of the rings .",
    "the a and b rings exhibit a remarkable asymmetric brightness variation that was first discovered by @xcite , confirmed later by the ground - based observations @xcite , and by the voyager image data @xcite . @xcite and",
    "@xcite carried out the detailed photometric modeling of self - gravity wakes with @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "they found that the self - gravity wakes in @xmath0-body simulation can account for the brightness dependence on the longitude and elevation in the voyager and ground - based observations .",
    "this conclusion was confirmed by the hubble space telescope and cassini observations @xcite .    though there have been many numerical @xmath0-body simulations of self - gravity wakes @xcite , the theoretical framework for dense planetary rings with self - gravity wakes has not been explored in detail yet .",
    "it is often argued that wakes in dense rings are dynamically similar to the spiral structure in differentially rotating galactic disks @xcite .",
    "@xcite studied theoretically the spiral structure in disk galaxies .",
    "they found that when disk surface density is perturbed , non - axisymmetric density enhancements appear .",
    "this mechanism is called swing amplification @xcite .",
    "based on the swing amplification , we can estimate the pitch angle of a spiral arm @xcite .",
    "the pitch angle is the angle between the tangents to a spiral arm and a perfect circle , which measures how tightly the spiral arm is wound .",
    "the swing amplification model predicts that the pitch angle for keplerian rotation is about @xmath2 , which is roughly consistent with that of the wakes in rings .",
    "thus , it has been considered that the swing amplification plays an important role in the self - gravity wake formation in rings .    according to the swing amplification model , the pitch angle of the self - gravity wakes depends on the shear rate @xcite .",
    "however , the dependence of the pitch angle on other ring parameters is still not well understood .",
    "observationally @xcite investigated the dependence of the pitch angle on the saturnicentric distance .",
    "they found that the pitch angle varies systematically with the saturnicentric distance . in the a ring ,",
    "the pitch angle is @xmath3 , which is consistent with the previous numerical simulations @xcite . in the middle",
    "a ring , the pitch angle is almost constant @xmath4 , but in the outer a ring , it increases with the saturnicentric distances to @xmath5 .",
    "in addition , @xcite pointed out that the pitch angle has the local maximum at the location of the strong density waves . from the cassini uvis occultation studies , @xcite obtained the consistent results that the pitch angle in the a ring is @xmath6 and it increases with the saturnicentric distance .",
    "they also found that the pitch angle in the b ring decreases with the saturnicentric distance . from the hst observations , @xcite showed the increase of the pitch angle with the saturnicentric distance in the a ring , which is consistent with the results in @xcite .",
    "the pitch angle dependence on the saturnicentric distance has a complex structure .",
    "it is not a monotonic function of the saturnicentric distance .",
    "however , roughly speaking , the pitch angle decreases with the saturnicentric distance in the b ring , while it increases in the a ring .",
    "@xcite performed @xmath0-body simulations and found that the wake pitch angle is about @xmath7 from the autocorrelation function .",
    "@xcite found that the pitch angle varies with the autocorrelation distance .",
    "the pitch angle for small autocorrelation distance is about @xmath8 , and decreases with the distance towards @xmath9 . using the photometric model they found that the longitude of the minimum brightness with respect to ansa increases from @xmath10 to @xmath11 with the elevation angle of the observer with respect to the ring plane .",
    "they argued that the observed minimum longitude for high elevation angles corresponds to the pitch angle for small distance , and that for low elevation angles corresponds to the pitch angle for large distance since the brightness for high elevation angles is dominated by the inner dense part of the wakes .",
    "however , the systematic study of the dependence of the pitch angle on ring parameters has not been conducted yet .",
    "therefore , we perform such a survey with high resolution @xmath0-body resolutions .",
    "we calculate the pitch angle from the autocorrelation function of the ring surface density and investigate its dependence on the restitution coefficient of ring particles , the dynamical optical depth , and the hill radius of a particle pair relative to the sum of their physical radii .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we describe the simulation model in section 2 and explain the calculation method of the pitch angle in section 3 . in section 4 , we present the results of the dependence of the pitch angle on ring parameters .",
    "sections 5 and 6 are devoted for discussion and a summary , respectively .",
    "we adopt the shearing box method developed for local ring dynamics ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we introduce the rotating local cartesian coordinates @xmath12 .",
    "the @xmath13-axis points radially outward , the @xmath14-axis points in the direction of orbital motion , and the @xmath15-axis points to the normal to the ring plane .",
    "we assume @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 , where @xmath19 is the saturn mass , @xmath20 is the mass of @xmath21th ring particle , @xmath22 is the saturnicentric distance , and @xmath23 is the orbital frequency .",
    "then the equation of motion for the @xmath21th particle is ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the distance between @xmath21th and @xmath26th particles .",
    "the first terms in equations ( [ eq : eomx ] ) and ( [ eq : eomy ] ) are the coriolis force .",
    "the second term in equation ( [ eq : eomx ] ) is the tidal force , the first term in equation ( [ eq : eomz ] ) is the vertical force due to saturn s gravity , and the last terms in equations ( [ eq : eomx])([eq : eomz ] ) are the mutual gravity between ring particles .",
    "the simulation box has a square shape with length @xmath27 on the @xmath13-@xmath14 plane .",
    "we use the sliding cell method where when a particle crosses a box boundary outward , the corresponding particle immediately comes into the box from the opposite boundary @xcite .",
    "the length @xmath27 should be sufficiently larger than the characteristic scale length , the critical wavelength of the gravitational instability @xmath28 where @xmath29 is the mean surface density @xcite .",
    "we adopt @xmath30 .    for the collision model",
    "we adopt the constant restitution coefficient @xmath31 that ranges from 0.1 to 0.6 . for @xmath32 ,",
    "the velocity dispersion of ring particles increases monotonically and self - gravity wakes do not appear @xcite .",
    "the effect of the velocity - dependent restitution coefficient is discussed in section [ seceps ] . for the velocity - dependent restitution coefficient model",
    ", we use the standard model of @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the normal component of the relative velocity in collisions and @xmath35 .",
    "we adopt the hard - sphere model as the collision model ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in the hard - sphere model , when collision between particles is detected , the particle velocities change instantly . in this study",
    "since we neglect the friction between particles , the relative tangential velocity is conserved in collision and the effects of spin are not considered .",
    "the equation of motion is integrated with a leapfrog integrator with timestep @xmath36 .",
    "we calculate the self - gravity by direct summation using the special - purpose computer , grape - dr @xcite .",
    "we introduce the cutoff of self - gravity by the subregion method @xcite . in this method",
    ", the cutoff length corresponds to the box size @xmath27 .",
    "ring particles are assumed to be identical for the sake of simplicity except for section [ secsize ] .",
    "for the identical particle model , all particles have the same mass @xmath37 .",
    "this assumption is unrealistic since many observations show a power - law size distribution of ring particles @xcite .",
    "the effect of the realistic size distribution is discussed in section [ secsize ] where we adopt the power - law size distribution @xcite @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the particle radius and @xmath40 is the power - law index . from the voyager radio occultation measurements , the power - law index increases with the saturnicentric distance from @xmath41 to @xmath42 in the a ring @xcite .",
    "the stellar occultation observations showed the consistent results that the power - law indexes are @xmath43 and @xmath44 in the inner and outer a rings , respectively @xcite . considering these results , we choose the intermediate value @xmath45 .",
    "we set the lower and upper size limits as @xmath46 and @xmath47 where @xmath48 .    for a ring with identical particles ,",
    "the dynamical optical depth is given by @xmath49 where @xmath0 is the number of particles in the simulation box and @xmath50 is the particle density . for a low optical depth ring , the dynamical optical depth is equal to the observed optical depth @xcite , while for a high optical depth ring , it is larger than the observed optical depth . though the particle density of solid ice is @xmath51 , @xmath50",
    "is estimated to be @xmath52 from the best fit to the observations of azimuthal brightness variation in the a ring @xcite .",
    "the surface density is inferred from density waves , which is typically @xmath53 in the a ring ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the surface density , radius , and particle density of ring particles collectively affect the structure of self - gravity wakes .",
    "we vary the dynamical optical depth from 0.3 to 1.8 in the identical particle models , which corresponds to the surface density of @xmath54 with @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "both the semi - major axis and particle density affect the spatial structure . if the distance of the simulation box from the planet , i.e. , the semi - major axis is large , the tidal force becomes less effective , allowing ring particles to gravitationally accumulate . in the region outside the roche limit , particles can form gravitationally - bound aggregates .",
    "the particle density affects the strength of the self - gravity .",
    "larger density makes particles pull each other more strongly , causing more distinct wakes .",
    "these factors are combined into one non - dimensional parameter , the hill radius of a particle pair relative to the sum of their physical radii , defined as @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the hill radius of the particle @xmath59 . with the particle density",
    "@xmath50 fixed , @xmath60 is proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "we vary the ratio from 0.68 to 1.06 .",
    "we introduce a parameter , initial toomre @xmath61 to determine the initial random velocity of particles , @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the initial radial velocity dispersion @xcite .",
    "since the ring relaxes into the stationary state quickly , @xmath64 does not affect the final state @xcite .",
    "thus , we adopt @xmath65 .    the ring models are summarized in table [ tbl : model1 ] for identical particles and in table [ tbl : model2 ] for particles with size distributions .",
    "note that the dynamical properties of rings with the identical particles are characterized by the three non - dimensional quantities : @xmath66 , @xmath60 and @xmath31 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the dimensional quantities such as particle size are irrelevant to simulation results . however , in order to compare with the actual rings , we add the corresponding dimensional quantities to table [ tbl : model1 ] assuming @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "the surface density @xmath29 is calculated by equation ( [ eq : tau ] ) and the saturnicentric distance @xmath22 is calculated by equation ( [ eq : rhdif ] ) .",

    "are closely packed , inelastic collisions play an important role in dynamics .",
    "thus , the inner pitch angle of self - gravity wakes deviates from the estimated value for collisionless systems . in the outer low density regions , however , the effect of the shear is relatively strong compared to that of collisions , and the shear rate mainly determines the outer pitch angle just like collisionless systems .",
    "thus , the outer pitch angle is the same as that of collisionless systems and is independent of any ring parameters .",
    "we simplify the physical processes concerning the inner pitch angle and derive a rough estimate as follows . in high density regions ,",
    "the self - gravity is strong . without the shear and only with the self - gravity , an ellipsoidal aggregate",
    "whose shape is the hill sphere would form and its long axis is parallel to @xmath13-axis , that is , the pitch angle is @xmath409 .",
    "therefore , the strong self - gravity tends to increase the inner pitch angle to @xmath409 .",
    "conversely , the shear rotates the aggregate and tends to decrease the inner pitch angle to @xmath424 .",
    "the inner pitch angle may be determined by the balance between these two processes .",
    "we consider the evolution of an aggregate formed due to the self - gravity .",
    "when the aggregate is deformed by the shear , the self - gravity tends to restore it back to its original shape .",
    "the restoration timescale may be approximated by @xmath425 where @xmath426 is the bulk density of self - gravity wakes , which is the timescale of the jeans instability or gravitational instability ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the bulk density @xmath426 is less than the particle density @xmath50 . introducing a dimensionless factor @xmath427 , we assume @xmath428 . for identical particles , @xmath427 is less than @xmath429 that is for the closest packing .",
    "the timescale of self - gravity is given by @xmath430 where @xmath431 is a non - dimensional factor on the order of unity .",
    "the shear rotates and extends the wake and the pitch angle decreases with @xmath432 as @xmath433 where @xmath432 is the time elapsed since @xmath434 ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the shear timescale is @xmath435 as the pitch angle decreases with time , the wake rotation slows down .",
    "when the wake pitch angle is large ( @xmath436 ) , the wake rotation is fast ( @xmath437 ) .",
    "the wake rotates quickly before the self - gravity restores the inclined wake back to its original shape .",
    "as the pitch angle decreases , the wake rotation slows down and the self - gravity becomes important .",
    "thus , from @xmath438 we obtain a crude estimate of the inner pitch angle : @xmath439 which means that the pitch angle increases with @xmath427 .",
    "the bulk density of self - gravity wakes with size distribution can be larger than that for identical particles , and thus the pitch angle with size distribution is larger than that for identical particles , which is consistent with the simulation results .",
    "figure [ fig : pitch_rdep_size ] presents the pitch angle as a function of @xmath388 . as @xmath388 increases , the filling factor @xmath427 increases .",
    "assuming @xmath387 , we find that @xmath386 and @xmath440 are suitable for the identical particle models and the size distribution models of @xmath441 , respectively . as shown in figures [ fig : pitch_rdep ] and [ fig : pitch_sizea ] , equation ( [ eq : theory ] ) can roughly explain the dependence of the inner pitch angle on @xmath60 and @xmath22 with @xmath442 for the identical particle models and @xmath443 for the size distribution models with @xmath441 .",
    "the simulation results and equation ( [ eq : theory ] ) show that the inner pitch angle increases with @xmath60 . since @xmath60 is proportional to the saturnicentric distance @xmath22 , as @xmath60 increases , the orbital period increases , that is , the shear timescale increases . on the other hand ,",
    "the timescale of the gravitational instability depends only on @xmath426 and is independent of @xmath22 . therefore , as @xmath60 increases",
    ", the self - gravity dominates over the shear and the inner pitch angle increases .",
    "note that the actual filling factor has not been investigated in detail yet .",
    "these results do not suggest that the filling factor is @xmath386 or @xmath444 .",
    "the factor @xmath431 is also a free parameter .",
    "if we adopt smaller @xmath431 , the corresponding filling factor becomes smaller .",
    "the realistic filling factor should be smaller than unity .",
    "we used @xmath445 in the size distribution models .",
    "however , this size ratio is far smaller than the observationally inferred values that are @xmath446 and @xmath447 in the inner and outer a rings , respectively @xcite . as shown in figure [",
    "fig : pitch_rdep_size ] , the inner pitch angle is almost constant for @xmath448 .",
    "accordingly , the simulation results with @xmath449 in section [ secsize ] may be applicable to the realistic ring .",
    "we have investigated the pitch angle of the self - gravity wakes in the dense planetary ring by performing local @xmath0-body simulations where both inelastic collisions and self - gravitational interactions between particles are included . in order to extract the feature of the self - gravity wakes , we calculated the two - dimensional autocorrelation function of the surface density .",
    "we measured the angle of the inclined structure of the autocorrelation function as the wake pitch angle .",
    "we obtained two pitch angles in the inner and outer parts of the autocorrelation function separately .",
    "we confirmed that the inner pitch angle is larger than the outer one in all models .",
    "we examined the dependence of the pitch angle on various ring parameters .",
    "we found that the outer pitch angle is independent of the ring parameters , which is @xmath450 .",
    "this value is consistent with the estimation of pitch angle of the spiral arms in collisionless systems @xcite .",
    "the inner pitch angle does not depend on the restitution coefficient @xmath31 of particles and the optical depth @xmath66 provided that the overstable oscillation does not occur .",
    "we found that the inner pitch angle is determined by the hill radius of a particle pair relative to the sum of their physical radii @xmath60 .",
    "the inner pitch angle increases with @xmath60 from @xmath7 to @xmath376 .",
    "the tendency that the pitch angle increases with @xmath60 is consistent with the result of the observational studies that the pitch angle increases with the saturnicentric distance @xcite .",
    "the pitch angle with the size distribution model is larger than that for the identical particles because the filling factor for the size distribution model is larger and the resulting self - gravity is stronger .",
    "the strong self - gravity increases the inner pitch angle .    considering the effects of the self - gravity and the shear",
    ", the tendency of the increase of the inner pitch angle with the saturnicentric distance can be explained .",
    "however , this model is far from a complete theory .",
    "we need a more sophisticated theoretical framework to understand the overall activity of the self - gravity wakes and more detailed analyses of the self - gravity wakes by @xmath0-body simulation .",
    "it is especially important to understand the wake amplification and destruction processes considering the inelastic collisions and the nonlinear effects .",
    "we will focus on these processes in the next paper ."
