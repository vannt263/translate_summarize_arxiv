    "schr \" odinger evolution equation of quantum mechanics @xcite is of the first order in time and is formulated on the complex hilbert space of the system . in these respects , it is similar to the evolution equation of a hamiltonian dynamical system@xcite .",
    "the latter have an equivalent lagrangian formulation in terms of equations of the second order in time . on the other hand ,",
    "something like a lagrangian formulation of the abstract schr \" odinger equation is usually not considered .",
    "the question of a second order evolution equation equivalent to the schrdinger equation in coordinate representation was considered for the first time by schr \" odinger himself @xcite .",
    "however , he did not consider the problem as the one of relation between hamiltonian ( schr \" odinger ) and lagrange frameworks .",
    "an interesting analysis of this problem , again formulated in the coordinate representation , appeared in @xcite .",
    "construction of an appropriate lagrangian formulation of the quantum schr \" odinger evolution in the general case is the task of this paper .",
    "this is quite different from the standard application of the action functional in the lagrangian ( or hamiltonian ) form of the functional integral representation of the quantum propagator @xcite .",
    ", scaledwidth=80.0% ]    our strategy and the main result could be schematically summarized as in figure 1 .",
    "we shall start from the quantum schr \" odinger equation on an abstract complex hilbert space , which we consider as given .",
    "this is the box 1 in fig.1 .",
    "it is well known that the schr \" odinger equation is equivalent to the appropriate hamiltonian dynamical system on the corresponding phase space @xcite .",
    "this is the box 2 in fig.1 .",
    "in fact , the geometric hamiltonian form of the schr \" odinger evolution could be extended to an equivalent formulation of the quantum mechanics @xcite , and is quite suitable for treatment of problems like nonlinear constraints@xcite , imbedding of classical into quantum mechanics @xcite and hybrid theories @xcite .",
    "we shall apply the standard transition procedure from hamiltonian to lagrangian formulation in order to obtain the lagrangian form of the hamiltonian formulation of the schr \" odinger equation .",
    "the result is the box 3 in fig.1 .",
    "the final step is the transition from the lagrangian dynamical system in box 3 to the lagrangian form of the schr \" odinger equation , which turns out to be a second order equation on a real hilbert space .",
    "this is the box 4 in fig .",
    "1 . the transitions between boxes , represented by the arrows in fig . 1 , are explained in detail , and in the general case , in the next section .",
    "of course , the lagrangian form , when it exists , is equivalent to the hamiltonian schr \" odinger equation . therefore",
    ", our main motivation for the derivation of the lagrangian form of the general ( linear ) schr \" odinger equation is purely formal .",
    "one further motivation is that the lagrangian form of the schrdinger equation is more suitable for lorentz invariant models .",
    "in fact , we shall see that the klein - gordon equation @xcite for the relativistic state vector is noting else but the lagrangian formulation of the schr \" odinger equation with the corresponding hamiltonian .",
    "also , symmetries are more naturally considered as morphisms of the lagrangian form and not as time evolution , while the hamiltonian formulation , i.e. the schr \" odinger equation , on the other hand , offers the framework in which the time evolution is an automorphism of the relevant symplectic structure .",
    "however , one should bare on mind that the canonical coordinates and momenta in the hamiltonian and velocities in the lagrangian formulations of the schr \" odinger equation are in fact the coefficients in a basis expansion of the quantum state vector .",
    "the presentation in section 2 is general and formal .",
    "the conditions for existence of the expression of the canonical momenta in terms of velocities will be briefly discussed in the general case near the end of section 2 .",
    "the possible problems will be further illustrated and discussed in section 3 , together with the presentation of particular examples obtained by rewriting the general formalism in particular bases . in this section",
    "we also treat the klein - gordon equation as an example of the lagrangian formulation of the appropriate schrdinger equation .",
    "summary is given in section 4 .",
    "the schr \" odinger equation @xmath0 on a complex hilbert space @xmath1 of finite or infinite complex dimension @xmath2 , is equivalent to a hamiltonian dynamical system on an appropriate real , symplectic manifold of dimension @xmath3 .",
    "this hamiltonian formulation of the schr \" odinger evolution equation is well known ( excellent comprehensive reviews are @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , we need to recapitulate the notation and write down the basic definitions and formulas in their most elementary form .",
    "derivation of the hamiltonian form of the equation ( 1 ) ends with the equations ( 10 ) and the rest of this section is devoted to the derivation of the lagrangian form of the schr \" odinger evolution .",
    "a vector @xmath4 in an abstract ( arbitrary ) basis @xmath5 is written as @xmath6 the matrix elements @xmath7 satisfy @xmath8 since @xmath9 is a hermitian operator .",
    "it is not necessary for our main line of reasoning , but it is nevertheless instructive , to write down explicitly the abstract matrix form of the schro \" odinger equation ( 1 ) in terms of real @xmath3 dimensional vector @xmath10 the schr \" odinger equation ( 1 ) in terms of the @xmath3 real vector @xmath11 in the abstract basis reads @xmath12 where @xmath13 denote @xmath14 matrices introduced in ( 3 ) .",
    "the schr \" odinfer equation ( 1 ) and the representations in the abstract basis of @xmath1 are the content of the box 1 , and are considered as given .",
    "the function @xmath15 where @xmath16 are as in ( 2 ) is a quadratic form given explicitly by @xmath17 let us remark that the function @xmath18 can also be written as @xmath19 where @xmath11 is given by ( 4 ) but the representation is not unique , i.e. the expression ( 7 ) is given by @xmath19 where @xmath20 or @xmath21 or other similar matrces .",
    "it is easily checked that the hamilton equations with the hamilton s function @xmath18 ( 7 ) : @xmath22 reproduce the real form of the schr \" odinger equation ( 5 ) . the hamiltonian function ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) and the corresponding hamilton s equations are the content of the box 2 , and the arrow from box 1 to box 2",
    "is given explicitly by the formula ( 7 ) .    in order to derive the lagrangian form of the hamilton s equations ( 10 ) we need to express the canonical momenta @xmath23 in terms of the velocities @xmath24 .",
    "this is done in the standard way , and using the explicit form of the equations ( 10 ) .",
    "in fact , from ( 10a ) @xmath25 therefore @xmath26 or in a more compact form @xmath27 . at this point we do not care about the existence of the inverse operator @xmath28 .",
    "the relation ( 12 ) is substituted into the definition of the lagrange function @xmath29 to obtain , after some manipulation @xmath30q_m     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the previous formula for the lagrangian function @xmath31 in terms of the hamiltonian @xmath9 could be rewritten in a perhaps more systematic form @xmath32 where @xmath33 are given in terms of @xmath34 in the following compact form @xmath35.\\ ] ] the lagrange function ( 14 ) is uniquely related to the original hamiltonian operator in ( 1 ) .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian equations are @xmath36 where @xmath37 are given by ( 15 ) .",
    "the lagrangian ( 14 ) with transition formulas ( 15 ) is the content of the box 3 and the arrow from the box 1 to the box 3",
    ".    let us remark that the lagrangian ( 14 ) can be written in the form resembling the equation ( 6 ) by introducing 2n - dimensional vector @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath39&\\frac{1}{2}\\hat h^i ( \\hat h^r)^{-1}\\cr \\frac{-1}{2}(\\hat h^r)^{-1}\\hat h^i&\\frac{\\hbar}{2}(\\hat h^r)^{-1}\\end{pmatrix}|\\kappa\\rangle\\ ] ]    in order to go from the box 3 to the box 4 we introduce operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 , acting on a real n - dimensional space , which are defined in terms of @xmath42 ( eq . ( 3 ) ) as follows @xmath43,\\quad \\hat l_1=\\frac{1}{\\hbar}[\\hat h^i+\\hat h^r\\hat h^i(\\hat h^r)^{-1}].\\ ] ] the lagrangian equations ( 16 ) are written as @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "this is the content of the box 4 . and represents the lagrangian form of the quantum schroedinger equation on the complex space @xmath1 .",
    "suppose that the operators @xmath40 and @xmath41 satisfying ( 18 ) exist for a given operator @xmath9 in ( 1 ) .",
    "then any orbit @xmath46 of ( 19 ) in @xmath47 can be used to construct the corresponding orbit of the schrdinger equation on @xmath48 , and the schrdinger orbit is given by @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is given in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath51 by the formula ( 12 ) .",
    "also , the initial conditions for the lagrangian formulation @xmath52 are related to the initial state of the hamiltonian equations or of the schr \" odinger equation essentially by the equation ( 12 ) .",
    "thus , the crucial question for the construction of the lagrangian formulation is the existence of the operators @xmath53 , which is essentially the question of the existence of the inverse operator @xmath54 . the hamiltonian operator @xmath9 in ( 1 )",
    "uniquely determines the operators @xmath55 and @xmath56 .",
    "however , a singular choice of basis in @xmath1 might imply that the operator @xmath55 ( or @xmath56 ) is represented by zero and @xmath57 does not exist ( see example in 3.1 ) .",
    "however , in a typical basis @xmath58 is represented by a nonzero operator .",
    "the existence of @xmath54 then depends on the physical problem .",
    "if @xmath54 , for the system with the hilbert space @xmath1 does not exist , then redefinition of the system by restriction on an appropriate subspace of @xmath1 would lead to a well defined @xmath54 .",
    "alternatively , in terms of the hamiltonian and the corresponding lagrangian formulations nonexistence of @xmath54 corresponds to constrained hamiltonian and singular lagrangian systems , and the relation between the two formalisms is treated by the appropriate methods @xcite .",
    "the lagrangian system ( 18 ) on @xmath2 dimensional @xmath59 can be trivially written in the form of an evolution equations on real 2n dimensional real space : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 was defined just before the equation ( 17 ) .",
    "in this section we present a series of examples , in the order of increasing complexity , which are aimed to illustrate the problems that might occur in the construction of the lagrangian formulation .",
    "the first example is rather trivial and artificial , but points out that problems in the construction of the lagrangian formulation might be apparent and induced by specific choice of a singular basis . consider the simplest possible quantum system of a single @xmath63 spin with the hamiltonian @xmath64 . in the eigenbasis of the @xmath65 the hamiltonian",
    "is represented by @xmath66 the real part of the hamiltonian is zero , there is no @xmath57 and the hamilton s function is @xmath67 and there apparently is no lagrangian formulation .",
    "however , by an arbitrary small change of basis the real part becomes nonzero . in the eigenbasis of @xmath68",
    "the imaginary part becomes zero and the real part of the hamiltonian becomes @xmath69 the lagrangian formulation is now constructed as in the next example .",
    "derivation and the formulas of the lagrangian formalism acquire specially simple form in the eigenbasis of the hamiltonian @xmath9 with a discrete , say non - degenerate , spectrum .",
    "the hamilton s function is of the form corresponding to a system of linear oscillators @xmath70 thus , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 are real and @xmath73 .",
    "the momenta @xmath74 are related to the velocities @xmath75 by @xmath76 , which is well defined if @xmath9 has no zero eigenvalue .",
    "lagrangian function ( 13 ) is given by @xmath77 and the lagrangian equations are @xmath78 or @xmath79 where @xmath80 operates on the real space @xmath81 .",
    "the only possible obstacle to the existence of the lagrangian formulation is possible zero eigenvalue of the hamiltonian . if there is a zero eigenvalue then the restriction of the schr \" odinger equation onto the orthogonal complement of the zero eigenspace generates the hamiltonian system with the canonical pair @xmath82 that does not appear in the hamilton s function ( 25 ) , and for which there is the corresponding lagrangian formulation on @xmath83 .    from these two examples we see that the construction of the lagrangian formulation might fail if one makes a choice of the singular basis and/or includes nonphysical states .",
    "construction of the lagrangian formulation for the schrdinger equation in the coordinate representation follows the same steps as in the general case , or can be obtained by applying the general formulas ( 18 ) and ( 19 ) written in the coordinate basis .",
    "the only potential problem is , like in the general case , non - existence of the inverse of the real part of the hamiltonian operator @xmath54 , appearing in ( 12 ) .",
    "this operator typically has non - diagonal elements in almost all bases and , of course , this fact is irrelevant for the question of its existence . in the coordinate representation ,",
    "the non - diagonal character of @xmath54 appears as non - locality of the relevant differential operator , and this fact , like its analog in the general case , is irrelevant for the existence of the lagrangian formulation .",
    "consider a hamiltonian of the form @xmath84 in the representation of the coordinate @xmath85 , the evolution equation ( 1 ) becomes the schrdinger linear partial differential equation of mathematical physics @xmath86 where @xmath87 .",
    "this equation is equivalent to the hamiltonian functional equations for the canonical fields @xmath88 introduced by @xmath89 .",
    "the hamilton s functional is obtained by applying the general rule @xmath90\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the hamilton s functional ( 31 ) is traditionally ( see for example @xcite further transformed into @xmath91,\\ ] ] but the form ( 31 ) is much more suitable for the construction of the lagrangian formulation .",
    "the hamilton s equations corresponding to ( 31 ) ( or to ( 32 ) ) are @xmath92 the generalized momentum @xmath93 is expressed via @xmath94 using the formula ( 33a ) and reads @xmath95 observe that the differential operator @xmath96 maps real functions into real ones and therefore the formula ( 34 ) is a special case of ( 12 ) @xmath97 . using the equation ( 34 ) to replace @xmath98 and ( 33a ) to replace @xmath99 , the lagrangian functional corresponding to ( 31 ) is formed by the standard rule and reads @xmath100.\\ ] ] this is just the general formula ( 13 ) with @xmath101 .",
    "observe that the expression @xmath99 that appears in the hamiltonian ( 31 ) is easily handled using the equation of motion ( 34a ) . on the other hand , replacement of the generalized momenta that appear in the term @xmath102 of the equivalent",
    "hamiltonian ( 32 ) using ( 34 ) might appear as an additional problem in the construction of the lagrangian .",
    "we see that the problem is related to the particular form of the hamiltonian ( 32 ) and does not appear in the equivalent hamiltonian ( 31 ) .",
    "we need the lagrangian equations @xmath103 with the lagrangian ( 35 ) .",
    "variation of the functional variation @xmath104 due to a variation of @xmath105 gives @xmath106\\ ] ] however , since the inverse of a hermitian hamiltonian @xmath9 is also hermitian the two terms in the previous expression are equal and the functional derivative of @xmath107 with respect to @xmath108 becomes @xmath109 the lagrange equations become @xmath110 or @xmath111 of course , the lagrange equation ( 39 ) is the special case of the general formula ( 19 ) , as was the lagrangian ( 35 ) the special case of ( 13 ) .",
    "no additional problems in the construction of the lagrangian formulation for the schrdinger equation ( 30 ) occur because of the special choice of the coordinate representation . like in the general case",
    ", the only possible obstacle to the construction might be non - existence of the inverse operator @xmath112 which is in this case @xmath113 .",

    "in summary , we have developed the lagrangian formalism for the abstract linear schrdinger equation on a complex hilbert space of a quantum system . for a given hamiltonian operator @xmath120 the lagrangian system is expressed in terms of the operators @xmath121 and @xmath54 , and is given by a second order equation on a real space .",
    "the operator @xmath54 , which is crucial for construction of the lagrangian formulation , exists provided that the spectrum of @xmath9 is bounded away from zero . if this is not the case , than the schrdinger equation is in fact equivalent to a constrained hamiltonian system , with the corresponding singular lagrangian formulation . a simple example illustrating the failure of the procedure that might occur in a singularly chosen basis is provided .",
    "the general formulation of the lagrangian system is also illustrated in the eigenbasis of a hamiltonian with a discrete spectrum and in the coordinate representation .",
