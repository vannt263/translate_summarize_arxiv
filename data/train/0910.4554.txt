    "during the last decade there has been a growing interest in the research of physical properties of colloidal systems .",
    "this interest is by part due to perspectives of practical use of colloids , e.g. , in biology , medicine , meteorology , food production , etc . on the other hand , colloids serve as a convenient model system for studying , e.g. , phase transitions @xcite , diffusion @xcite , or commensurate - incommensurate transitions @xcite .",
    "typical dimensions of colloids are in the micrometer regime and their dynamics is governed by a time scale in the microsecond regime and therefore is suitable for direct observation in real space and time .",
    "furthemore , it has been possible to tune the inter - particle interaction potential which opens thereby a wide area for research of fundamental properties of classical systems .    in refs .",
    "@xcite structural properties of magnetic mono - colloidal mixtures confined in narrow two - dimensional ( 2d ) channels were studied under equilibrium conditions .",
    "structural deviations from an infinite 2d crystal and related to it oscillations in structural properties were predicted .",
    "transport properties of paramagnetic mono - colloidal mixtures in narrow channels being in non - equilibrium but under stationary and homogeneous external conditions ( in the gravity field ) were investigated in refs .",
    "it was shown that gravitation action results in the occurrence of a density gradient along the channel , that in its turn leads to a gradient in the number of chains .",
    "the latter was predicted for a driven colloidal system in the presence of a constriction in the channel @xcite . besides , authors of refs .",
    "@xcite also studied the relation between velocities of colloidal motion , diffusive behavior and the self - organized order in the system .",
    "the transition from a hexagonal to a chain - like ordered phase was studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for yukawa particles ( applicable for charged colloids and dusty plasma @xcite ) confined in a two - dimensional parabolic channel .",
    "it was shown that the system crystallized in a number of chains similar to a colloidal system confined in a narrow channel .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite analyzed the structural transitions between the ground state configurations and showed that such system exhibited a rich phase diagram at zero temperature under continuous and discontinuous structural transitions .",
    "the purpose of this study is to achieve a deeper understanding of the influence of structural properties on the motion of paramagnetic colloids in narrow channels under non - uniform distributed driving force .",
    "in particular , we consider : ( i ) a linear increasing driving force from one to the other boundary of the channel , i.e. , a linear - gradient driving force , and ( ii ) a parabolic - profile driving force , i.e. , equal to zero at the boundaries and maximum at the center of the channel .",
    "although the experimental realization of such profiles is not as obvious as for the simplest case of a constant driving force ( created , e.g. , by gravity in an inclined channel ) , they can serve as a model of a very important case of a channel modulated in a non - uniform manner , e.g. , by a non - uniform distributed disorder ( `` pinning '' ) or surface roughness .",
    "the combination of a uniform force applied to colloids with a non - uniform modulation in such a channel will result in an effective non - uniform driving , i.e. , @xmath3 .",
    "the spatial period of the modulation should be chosen , obviously , essentially smaller than the colloidal radius .",
    "for example , if the modulation depth of a channel linearly grows from one edge of the channel to another , the effective driving force distribution is described by a linearly growing function . moreover",
    ", the application of a non - uniform driving force to a discrete system of interacting particles confined to a quasi-1d channel is expected to result in a rich dynamics interesting from the point of view of fundamental research , and it could be useful for understanding the dynamics of other interacting systems moving in narrow channels .",

    "motion of the system of paramagnetic colloids in a two - dimensional ( 2d ) narrow channel under the action of a non - uniform distributed driving force @xmath0 is investigated using the langevin equations of motion in the overdamped regime , i.e. , the brownian dynamics ( bd ) method .",

    "note that inclusion of temperature fluctuation would lead to the degradation of the colloidal stripe structure and , as a result , to smearing of the velocity profile of different colloidal chains .",
    "we focus on the features of the velocity profiles related to the structure of the chains driven by a non - uniform force , and we neglected temperature - induced fluctuations in our calculations . in our numerical simulations",
    ", we use a simulation cell with sizes equal to the channel width in the @xmath24-direction and typically @xmath29 along the channel , i.e. , in the @xmath30-direction .",
    "we use periodic boundary condition along the @xmath30-direction .",
    "interaction of colloids with lateral walls is hard - wall .",
    "the system of overdamped equations ( [ l2 ] ) is solved using a variable time step , calculated from the condition @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the displacement of @xmath14th colloid , and @xmath33 was typically chosen @xmath34 or @xmath35 , although in most cases the value @xmath36 was sufficient .",
    "as was shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , in the absence of external forces interacting colloids in narrow 2d channels are ordered in stripe structures .",
    "therefore , one might expect that appliyng an external force along the channel will result in an ordered drift of colloidal stripes in the channel .",
    "( this obviously applies to the case of rather weak driving force or its gradient and very narrow channels .",
    "strong inhomogeneous driving in a wide enough channel could lead to the appearance of instabilities in the transverse direction to the applied driving and thus to the migration of colloids between stripes . )",
    "thus the investigation of the motion of colloids in narrow channels can be reduced to the analysis of the drift of colloidal stripes .",
    "note that in this case the order of individual colloids in a stripe does not change with time , and the motion of colloids in stripes resembles single - file diffusion ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .    for studying the colloidal motion in channels we choose such ground state configurations which are characterized by strongly pronounced stripe structure and thus by a high value of stripe order parameter @xcite @xmath37 the order parameter @xmath38 for particles distributed equidistantly in @xmath39 chains across the channel , and @xmath40 for a non - chained case . here",
    "@xmath41 is the channel width , @xmath42 is the @xmath24 coordinate of @xmath14th colloid and @xmath43 is the number of particles in the system .",
    "such a choice of the initial configurations predetermined a well - defined stripe structure and allowed us to focus on the study of stripe dynamics rather than on the dynamics of a low - ordered phase ( i.e. , for @xmath40 ) . a typical configuration of the initial colloidal distribution is shown in fig .",
    "[ figgs ] .",
    "our estimate of the inter - chain interaction shows that the main contribution is given only by the adjacent stripes while the contribution from more remote stripes is negligible .",
    "the profile of the applied driving force and the structural distribution of colloids in a channel are the two most important factors defining the dynamics of colloidal motion in a narrow two - dimensional channel in the overdamped regime .",
    "their roles essentially distinguish depending on the value of the applied driving . for an overall strong drive the distribution of the driving force",
    "@xmath0 is dominating .",
    "contrarily , in case of weak drive , the motion of colloidal stripes is mainly determined by the structural distribution of colloids . in intermediate cases the character of colloidal motion results from a complex competition between these two factors .",
    "the distribution of the density of colloids in the transverse direction @xmath44 is essentially non - uniform , i.e. , presence of the channel boundaries leads to a relatively higher colloidal density on the periphery and lower in the central chains @xcite .",

    "colloidal distribution in a channel , for the total density @xmath46 .",
    ", width=321 ]    another essential feature of the colloidal distribution in a channel consists in oscillating dependence of the defect concentration on the channel width @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "thus increase of the channel width is periodically accompanied by a qualitative rearrangement of the colloidal structure , namely , by the occurrence of new chains .",
    "the values of the channel width , for which the colloidal structures rearrange , correspond to low - ordered states ( @xmath40 ) when the stripe structure is hardly distinguishable .",
    "this fact is reflected in the oscillation of the stripe order parameter @xmath47 with increasing width of the channel .",
    "it is worth to note however that the fact that @xmath47 is large does not mean that the defect concentration is low .",
    "actually it means only that stripes are well pronounced and all defects are mainly topological .      before discussing results of our numerical calculations",
    ", we note a useful property that directly follows from system of equations ( [ l2 ] ) , namely , the integral of motion : @xmath48 separating the longitudinal component we obtain , in terms of average stripe velocities , @xmath49 where @xmath50 denotes the @xmath50th chain , @xmath51 is the average velocity of @xmath50th stripe .",
    "this expression has a clear meaning : the sum of all average chain velocities is defined by the momentum of the external force transferred to the system . from eq .",
    "( [ l5 ] ) it follows that the colloidal system is in the static state , i.e. , does not move , only in case of : ( i ) zero driving force ; ( ii ) sign - alternating driving force satisfying the condition @xmath52 and @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is some critical force .",
    "this result is remarkable due to the fact that it differs from the case of particles moving under the action of an external force in any stationary periodic potential . in the latter case , for a commensurate configuration ( i.e. , when the number of colloids per unit length coincides with the number of potential minima )",
    ", there is always a threshold value of the force related to the `` static friction '' .",
    "thus the system of particles moves if the driving force exceeds the threshold value . in our case ,",
    "the system of colloids moves always when the sum of forces in ( [ l5 ] ) is larger than zero .",
    "note that the conservation law ( [ l5 ] ) is fulfilled for any distribution of the driving force @xmath0 and it is not valid if temperature is non zero .      in this subsection",

    "such shear stress is negligible for a parabolic driving ( it appears as a result of transverse instabilities ) .",

    "this is explained by decreasing of the inter - colloid distance in stripes and thus by shallowing of the potential profile created by them .",
    "note that for a weaker driving @xmath110 ( a ) , the central stripes remain locked at @xmath117 and they unlock at a higher value of @xmath75 : @xmath82 .",
    "for even higher density , @xmath46 , the inter - shell defects lock the motion of the central chains 2 and 3 ( and partially of all the chains ) , and the whole stripe structure collapses . if we still increase the colloid density , a new stripe ( 5 ) originates from the `` disordered '' phase , and for larger @xmath75 ( i.e. , @xmath118 ) the motion of all five stripes unlock , and they move with individual velocities . note that the transition of the system from the state with @xmath88 stripes to the state with @xmath119 stripes occurs always through the disordered phase ( i.e. , when all or some of the stripes lose their identity , and colloids of these `` stripes '' move with the same velocity as , e.g. , stripes 2 , 3 , and 4 in fig .",
    "[ figvro](a ) and ( b ) at @xmath46 ) .",
    "thus the disordered phase of the motion serves as a `` bifurcation point '' that gives rise to a new state with @xmath119 velocity branches .",
    "the evolution of stripe velocities for a parabolic driving occurs in a similar way ( fig .",

    "( here we show only the case when driving is applied to one peripheral stripe . applying driving to other stripes results in a similar behavior . )",
    "note that the mobility is defined by @xmath131 , while @xmath132 for @xmath133 is a mobile response of the stripes .    as seen from fig .",
    "[ figb ] , the mobility as a function of the applied force exhibits a variety of modes of motion .",

    "a stripe mobility @xmath134 tends to unity in the limit of large applied force @xmath129 , and mobile responses @xmath132 , correspondingly , vanish , as seen from fig .",
    "this limit corresponds to the plastic mode of motion .",
    "another general conclusion refers to the rb - to - plastic transition : this transition shifts towards lower drivings with increasing the total colloidal density ( cp .",

    ", width=321 ]    however , apart from these general features , the mobilities display other important peculiarities . to discuss these ,",
    "let us define dynamical phases corresponding to different regimes of colloidal motion in channels .",
    "we denote the first regime as `` rb '' ( `` rigid body '' , or elastic motion ) .",

    "[ figb](a ) ) , where it extends to @xmath147 . for @xmath138 ( fig .",
    "[ figb](b ) ) the threshold value reduced by a factor of five , @xmath148 . for higher densities ,",
    "the rb - to - plastic mode transition shifts towards very low values of @xmath149 .",
    "the rb regime is followed by a broad transition region ( `` tr '' ) characterized by a monotonic increase of the mobility @xmath134 ( and monotonic decrease of the mobile responses @xmath132 ) . while this growth is close to linear in fig .",
    "[ figb](a ) , for higher density it displays oscillations in fig .",
    "[ figb](b ) .",
    "remarkably , for higher colloidal densities these oscillations turn to regions of _ decreasing _ colloid mobility @xmath134 versus driving force .",
    "note that this regime ( denoted as `` s '' ) is similar to the dynamically - ordered phase of vortex motion in superconductors with arrays of regular pinning sites @xcite .",
    "this ordered phase follows a disordered phase with a higher density of average vortex flow and thus leads to the appearance of a negative differential resistivity ( ndr ) part of n - type in the vi - curve @xcite . in our case of colloidal motion in a narrow channel , we observe a similar effect characterized by a slowing down of the motion of the stripe driven by an external force ( with a simultaneous increase of the velocity of the adjacent stripes ) when increasing the applied driving force . in this region ,",
    "the system of colloids displays a partial `` reentrant '' behavior ( cp . refs .",
    "@xcite ) when , being melted by increasing shear stress , it starts evolving towards a solid phase with further increasing driving .",
    "note that this dynamically - induced `` solidification '' has common features with the recently discovered transition `` freezing by heating '' @xcite where by increasing temperature it leads to the crystallization of moving repulsive interacting particles which are in a molten state .",
    "the mechanism of the observed colloid solidification can be understood as follows . as we discussed above , the longitudinal motion of colloidal stripes",
    "is accompanied by transverse oscillations of the stripes trajectories ( i.e. , serpentine - like motion ) related to the asymmetry of the potential - energy profiles created by the adjacent stripes . for low drivings ( but larger than the critical driving force of the rb - to - plastic transition ) , the stripe driven by an external force moves along some serpentine - like trajectory .",
    "when moving , the stripe itself deforms adjusting to the potential - energy landscape . in its turn",
    ", it elastically deforms other stripes due to the interaction with colloids in the adjacent stripes . at low velocities , colloids in adjacent stripes",
    "relax to the initial state thus providing low friction between the stripes .",
    "increasing the velocity of motion of the driven stripe ( at high colloid density ) leads to increasing rate of the inter - stripe collisions and to the development of instabilities in the transverse direction .",
    "this results in an increase of the dynamical friction between stripes which explains the observed decrease of the mobility @xmath134 ( and increase of the mobile response @xmath132 ) , i.e. , the appearance of `` s '' phase . very large",
    "driving , however , straightens the trajectories of motion of the driven stripe . in the limit of @xmath150 , the driven stripe moves along unrelaxed in the @xmath24-direction straight trajectory , and the mobility @xmath151 ( while the mobile response @xmath152 ) , as shown in figs .",
    "[ figb](c ) , ( d ) .",
    "we have studied the dynamics of colloids driven by an external non - uniform force in a narrow channel .",
    "we focused on colloidal densities which provide well - defined colloidal stripe structures . in the limit of a very low driving force the system moves as a rigid body ( elastic motion ) independent of the profile of the driving force . in the opposite limit of a very strong driving force ,",
    "the profile of the average velocities of colloidal stripes follow the profile of the applied driving ( plastic regime ) .",
    "while these limiting - case results are easily understandable , the dynamics of colloidal stripes in the general case is rather complex .",
    "it is governed by the interplay of several factors , i.e. : ( i ) the magnitude and profile of driving force ; ( ii ) the total density of the colloidal system and the distribution of the colloidal density in stripes , and , as a consequence , ( iii ) commensurability effects between the adjacent chains .",
    "we have shown that depending on the density and number of stripes , the transition from elastic to plastic motion occurs at different values of the driving force .",
    "for example , the lowest - density three - stripe colloidal configuration is shown to be more robust with respect to a parabolic driving than to a linear - gradient driving , while for the lowest - density four - stripe configuration the situation is opposite .",
    "this result is explained by the colloidal density distribution over the central ( lower density ) and the peripheral ( higher density ) stripes and commensurability effects .",
    "we have analyzed the mobility of colloidal stripes and have identified the dynamical phases of their motion . in particular , it has been shown that the transition from elastic ( rigid - body - motion phase ) to plastic mode , depending on the density of colloids , could be either monotonic ( i.e. , characterized by a gradual increase of the mobility ) , or it could contain an ndr - type part ( i.e. , characterized by a drop of mobility versus driving force ) .",
    "this unusual `` solidification '' is related to the dynamically - induced increase of the friction in the colloidal system and is similar to the recently discovered `` freezing by heating '' transition .",
