    "the composition of uhecrs is controversial , with air - shower data from the fly s eye , hires and telescope array observatories@xcite suggesting a proton dominated composition and data from the pierre auger observatory@xcite suggesting a transition to heavier elements above @xmath6  gev . due to this discrepancy , and due to the experimental and theoretical uncertainties in the relevant high energy particle interaction cross sections used for modeling the shape of the air showers , it is impossible to draw a definite conclusion regarding composition based on air - shower data at this time ( the anisotropy signal provides an indication for a proton dominated composition@xcite , but is so far detected with only a @xmath7 confidence level@xcite ) .",
    "the observed flux and spectrum of @xmath8  gev crs is consistent with a cosmological distribution of cosmic - ray sources , producing protons at a rate@xcite @xmath9 the energy density of crs ( at different energies ) is determined by the ( energy dependent ) cr production rate and energy loss time .",

    "the rate estimate of eq .",
    "[ eq : uhecr ] is based on the direct measurement of uhecrs and on the well understood physics of proton - cmb interaction .",
    "it is therefore accurate ( to @xmath10 ) as long as the composition is dominated by protons .",
    "observations determine only the local , @xmath11 , proton production rate and spectrum , since the energy loss time of protons is much smaller than the hubble time ( e.g. , @xmath12  yr corresponding to a propagation distance of @xmath13  mpc at @xmath2  gev ) .",
    "the observed uhecr spectrum is consistent with a `` flat '' proton generation spectrum , @xmath14 with equal energy produced per logarithmic cr energy interval , modified by interaction with cmb photons .",
    "this supports a proton dominated composition , since a flat generation spectrum is observed in a wide range of astrophysical environments ( e.g. cr protons in the galaxy@xcite , electrons in supernova remnants@xcite and in @xmath15-ray bursts@xcite ) , and is a robust prediction of the best understood and most widely accepted model for particle acceleration in astrophysical objects- fermi acceleration in collisionless shocks@xcite ( although a first principles understanding of the process is not yet available ) .",
    "if the composition is dominated by heavier nuclei up to iron ( e.g. o , si , fe ) , the inferred energy generation rate at @xmath16  gev would change by a factor of only a few .",
    "this is due to the fact that the energy loss distance of protons is not very different from that of heavy nuclei ( due to photo - disintegration interactions with the infra - red background)@xcite .",
    "however , the different energy dependence of the energy loss distances of heavy nuclei and protons , implies that for a heavy nuclei composition , a generation spectrum different from @xmath17 or an ad - hoc energy dependent composition would be required to fit the observed spectrum@xcite .",

    "would have lost all their energy to pion production in interactions with the cmb photons@xcite .",
    "the icecube collaboration reported@xcite a detection of 37 neutrinos in the energy range of @xmath31  tev to @xmath32  pev , which constitutes a @xmath33 excess above the expected atmospheric neutrino and muon backgrounds ( the uncertain contribution of atmospheric neutrinos from charmed meson decay is constrained by the angular distribution of the detected events ) .",
    "the excess neutrino spectrum is consistent with a `` flat '' , @xmath34 , spectrum , its angular distribution is consistent with isotropy , and its flavor content is consistent with @xmath35@xcite . assuming a flat spectrum , the best fit normalization of the intensity is @xmath36 . assuming that this intensity extends to high energy , 3 events should have been detected on average above 2  pev .",
    "the absence of such events suggests a suppression of the flux above 2  pev , or a softer than @xmath34 spectrum . fitting a power law excess , @xmath37 extending beyond 2  pev , to the data yields @xmath38 ( 90% confidence ) .",
    "the results of ref .   were obtained by an analysis limited to events for which the neutrino interaction occurs within the detector ( `` starting events '' ) .",
    "a recent analysis@xcite searching for high energy neutrino induced muon events , not limited to neutrino interactions within the detector , revealed a muon - neutrino flux which constitutes a @xmath39 excess above the expected atmospheric neutrino and muon backgrounds in the energy range of @xmath40  tev to @xmath5  pev , with flux and spectrum consistent with those of the `` starting events '' analysis .",
    "the results of the `` starting events '' and muon analyses described above are shown graphically in fig .  [",

    "the possible low energy excess does not affect the analysis presented here , which is focused on the higher energy , @xmath44  tev , neutrinos .",
    "a @xmath35 flavor ratio is consistent with that expected for pion decay in cosmologically distant sources , for which oscillations modify the original @xmath47 ratio to a @xmath48 ratio@xcite .",
    "however , with the current limited statistics , the data are consistent with any initial ( i.e. at the source ) flavor ratio@xcite .",
    "the extra - terrestrial neutrino flux is unlikely to be dominated by ( yet unknown ) galactic sources , which , unlike the observed signal , are expected to be strongly concentrated along the galactic disk .",
    "this , and the coincidence with the wb bound , suggests an extra - galactic origin .",
    "icecube s neutrinos are therefore most likely emitted by the decay of charged pions produced in interactions of high energy crs with ambient ( low energy ) photons or protons in extra - galactic sources .",
    "let us consider first the case where the parent crs are protons .",
    "the fraction of the parent proton energy carried by each neutrino is approximately @xmath49 ( for production by interaction with either photons or protons ) .",

    "two distinct scenarios may be considered .",
    "the observed neutrinos may be produced by sources accelerating protons at a rate @xmath53 , provided that protons of energy @xmath54  pev lose most of their energy to pion production either within the sources or at the sources environment .",
    "alternatively , the observed neutrinos may be produced by sources accelerating protons at a rate @xmath55 , provided that protons lose only a small fraction , @xmath56 , of their energy to pion production . in the latter case , the small ( and likely energy dependent ) energy loss fraction @xmath57 should compensate the large energy production rate , @xmath58 , to reproduce the observed flux and spectrum over two decades of @xmath59 energy , and the coincidence of the observed neutrino flux and spectrum with the wb bound would be an accident .",
    "the simpler explanation , which we consider to be more likely , is that both the neutrinos and the uhecrs are produced by the same population of cosmological sources , producing protons with a flat spectrum , @xmath14 as observed in a wide range of astrophysics accelerators and as expected theoretically for electromagnetic acceleration in collisionless shocks ( see   [ sec : uhecrs ] ) , over the [ 1  pev,@xmath2  gev ] energy range , and residing in `` calorimetric '' environments , in which protons of energy @xmath60  pev lose much of their energy to pion production .",
    "let us consider next the case where the parent crs are heavy nuclei of atomic mass @xmath61 .",
    "the fraction of the parent nucleus energy carried by each neutrino emitted by the decay of charged pions produced in inelastic collisions with ambient protons is approximately @xmath62 , while interactions with ambient photons may lead to photo - disintegration of the nuclei , roughly preserving @xmath63 . in this case therefore , a lower limit of @xmath64 is implied on the local , @xmath11 , production rate of nuclei in the energy range of @xmath65  pev to @xmath66  pev . as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : uhecrs ] , if the uhecr flux is dominated by heavy nuclei , the energy production rate required to account for the observed uhecr flux would differ from that given by eq .",
    "[ eq : uhecr ] by a factor of a few at @xmath16  gev .",
    "thus , the observed neutrino flux and spectrum and the cr flux at @xmath16  ev could be explained by a single population of sources producing heavy nuclei with a flat spectrum , @xmath14 over the [ 1@xmath61  pev,@xmath2  gev ] energy range , and residing in `` calorimetric '' environments , in which nuclei of energy @xmath67  pev lose much of their energy to pion production .    unlike the case of protons ,",
    "if the uhecr flux is dominated by heavy nuclei , the @xmath0  gev spectrum can not be simply explained by an extension of a flat , @xmath14 , spectrum to high energy ( see   [ sec : uhecrs ] ) .",
    "we consider this an additional evidence supporting a proton dominated uhecr flux .    for all production channels , @xmath68 , similar flavor content ( @xmath48 ) and particle / anti - particle content ( @xmath69 )",
    "are expected , except for @xmath18 interactions dominated by the @xmath28 resonance ( which may be obtained in environments with soft , @xmath70 , photon spectra ) , where an excess of particles over anti - particles is expected .",
    "finally , we note that the absence of neutrino detection above a few pev , which suggests a suppression of the neutrino flux above this energy , may be due to efficient escape of @xmath71  pev crs from the environments in which they produce the pions ( as was predicted to be the case for sources residing in starburst galaxies@xcite ) , and need not imply a cutoff in the cr production spectrum ( see   [ sec : starbursts ] ) .",
    "starburst galaxies have been predicted@xcite to act as cosmic - calorimeters , producing an extra - galactic neutrino background comparable to the wb bound at energies @xmath72  pev , and possibly extending to higher energy ( see fig.[fig : icdetection ] ) .",
    "starbursts may be defined as galaxies with specific star formation rate ( ssfr ) , i.e. sfr per galaxy stellar mass , which is much higher than the average ssfr of galaxies at a similar redshift@xcite .",
    "starbursts in the local universe are characterized by disks of typical radii @xmath73 of several hundred parsecs , with column densities @xmath74@xcite and magnetic fields @xmath75  mg ( @xmath76)@xcite , which are much larger than those of `` normal '' spiral galaxies ( @xmath77 , @xmath78 g in the milky way ) .",
    "the large disk densities imply that the energy loss time of cr protons , due to inelastic @xmath79 collisions , is much shorter in starburst galaxies than in normal spirals , and the enhanced magnetic field implies that the confinement time of the protons is expected to be larger than in normal spirals .",
    "this in turn implies that , unlike normal spirals , starburst galaxies may act as proton calorimeters .",
    "starburst galaxies have long been argued@xcite to act as calorimeters for few  gev protons , based on the fir - radio correlation .",
    "the recent detection of gev and tev emission from the nearby starburst galaxies m82 and ngc253 indicate that these galaxies are calorimetric for protons of energy exceeding 10  tev@xcite .",
    "the theoretical arguments given in ref .  , and reproduced in a more general way below , suggest that calorimetry holds to energies exceeding 10  pev .",
    "protons will lose all their energy to pion production provided that the energy loss time is shorter than both the starburst lifetime and the magnetic confinement time within the starburst gas . in the energy range of interest , the inelastic nuclear collision cross section is @xmath80  mb , with inelasticity of @xmath81 .",
    "the energy loss time , @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the interstellar nucleon density , would be shorter than the starburst lifetime , which is at least the dynamical time given by the ratio of @xmath73 to the characteristic gas velocities @xmath84 , @xmath85 , as long as @xmath86 for characteristic gas velocities , @xmath87 few hundred km / s , the critical surface density , @xmath88 , is comparable to the minimum @xmath89 of known starburst galaxies@xcite .",
    "the ratio of confinement time and loss time is less straightforward to estimate , since magnetic confinement of crs is not well understood . in the milky way , the total gas column density traversed by crs of energy @xmath90  tev before they escape the galaxy is @xmath91@xcite .",
    "if the propagation of crs in starburst galaxies is similar to that in our galaxy , we may expect @xmath92 , since the propagation of the crs in the magnetic field is determined by @xmath93 . for @xmath94 , the fraction of proton energy lost to pion production before escape is @xmath95 .",
    "since the neutrino flux is expected to be dominated by starbursts at @xmath96 , for which the typical surface density should be even higher than in local starbursts , it is reasonable to assume that most of the energy injected into starburst galaxies in @xmath97  pev protons is converted to pions .",
    "the energy loss of @xmath97  pev protons in starburst galaxies would produce a neutrino flux and intensity similar to the wb bound at @xmath98  pev , provided that the sources of uhecrs produce most of their energy output in starburst environments .",
    "this would be the case if , as assumed in ref .  , ( i ) the rate of cr production is proportional to the sfr and ( ii ) most ( or a significant fraction ) of the stars in the universe have been produced in starburst episodes .    the leading uhecr accelerator candidates are @xmath15-ray bursts ( grbs ) and transient accretion events onto massive black holes residing at the centers of galaxies@xcite .",
    "the assumption that the cr production rate is proportional to the sfr is natural for sources like grbs , which are related to the deaths of massive stars , and may not be inconsistent with models based on activity around massive central black holes . on the other hand , the assumption that a significant fraction of the stars in the universe have been produced in starburst episodes ( as suggested e.g. by ref .  )",
    "is not necessarily valid .",
    "recent observations indicate that for @xmath99 the ssfr is narrowly distributed around a @xmath26-dependent average , which increases by a factor of @xmath42 from @xmath11 to @xmath25@xcite .",
    "outliers with high ssfr , which may be categorized as starbursts , are found to contribute only @xmath41% of the total sfr@xcite .",
    "the interpretation of these results is still debated . in particular ,",
    "starburst activity has been commonly argued to be triggered by galaxy mergers , and whether or not the narrow distribution of the ssfr rules out major mergers as the cause for the rapid increase of the average ssfr with redshift is still debated@xcite . in other words ,",
    "if starburst activity is driven by mergers and major mergers are responsible for the increase in the ssfr , all galaxies at higher redshift may be classified as starbursts .    while the definition of a starburst is debateable and the fraction of star - formation occurring in starburst episodes is still uncertain , it should be noted that the typcial galaxies at high @xmath26 , which are rapidly forming stars , may well be calorimetric .",
    "co observations of 6 @xmath100 galaxies with normal ( i.e. close to the average ) ssfr show that they are characterized by rapid sfr , @xmath101 , and high column density massive molecular disks , @xmath102@xcite . in the local universe ,",
    "galaxies with such column density and sfr are calorimetric(see eq .  [ eq : sigma_c ] and ref .  ) .",
    "while the disk structure of high @xmath26 galaxies may be different , and the determination of the high @xmath26 molecular gas content is uncertain , these results support the hypothesis that a large fraction of the sfr occurred in calorimetric environments .",
    "the non detection by icecube of point sources producing multiple neutrino events , combined with the measured `` diffuse '' neutrino intensity , sets a lower limit to the density of the sources producing the neutrinos , and an upper limit to their neutrino luminosity .",

    "the flux of neutrinos of energy @xmath107 required for the detection of more than one neutrino induced muon event is approximately given by @xmath108 , where @xmath61 is the detector s effective area , @xmath109 is the integration time , and the probability that a 1  tev to 1  pev neutrino with a propagation track crossing the detector would produce a muon going through the detector is @xmath110@xcite .",

    "the limit inferred below on @xmath112 implies that the distance @xmath113 below which the flux exceeds @xmath114 , @xmath115 , is @xmath116 .",

    "this model is a natural explanation of icecube s results since it relies on a known ( although not yet identified ) population of sources- the uhecr sources , and since it does not depend on ad - hoc choices or fine tuning of model parameters : the neutrino flux normalization is determined by the observed uhecr flux , and the neutrino spectrum is consistent with that implied by the measured uhecr spectrum (   [ sec : uhecrs ] ) .",
    "moreover , a `` flat '' @xmath14 generation spectrum is observed in a wide range of astrophysical environments@xcite and is a robust prediction of the most widely accepted and best understood ( although not yet from first principles ) model for particle acceleration in astrophysical objects- fermi acceleration in collisionless shocks@xcite .",

    "their predictive power is thus limited .",
    "radio to tev observations of local starburst galaxies imply that they are calorimetric for protons of energy exceeding 10  tev@xcite , and theoretical arguments suggest that calorimetry holds to energies exceeding 10  pev (   [ sec : starbursts ] ) .",

    "the validity of the first assumption is natural if uhecrs are produced by grbs ( and may hold also for models based on activity around massive central black holes ) .",

    "<S> the icecube collaboration reports a detection of extra - terrestrial neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> the isotropy and flavor content of the signal , and the coincidence , within current uncertainties , of the 50  tev to 2  pev flux and the spectrum with the waxman - bahcall bound , suggest a cosmological origin of the neutrinos , related to the sources of ultra - high energy , @xmath0  gev , cosmic - rays ( uhecr ) . </S>",
    "<S> the most natural explanation of the uhecr and neutrino signals is that both are produced by the same population of cosmological sources , producing crs ( likely protons ) at a similar rate , @xmath1 , over the [ 1  pev,@xmath2  gev ] energy range , and residing in `` calorimetric '' environments , like galaxies with high star formation rate , in which @xmath3  pev crs lose much of their energy to pion production .    </S>",
    "<S> a tenfold increase in the effective mass of the detector at @xmath4  tev is required in order to significantly improve the accuracy of current measurements , to enable the detection of a few bright nearby starburst `` calorimeters '' , and to open the possibility of identifying the cr sources embedded within the calorimeters , by associating neutrinos with photons accompanying transient events responsible for their generation . </S>",
    "<S> source identification and a large neutrino sample may enable one to use astrophysical neutrinos to constrain new physics models . </S>"
