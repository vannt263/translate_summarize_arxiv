    "the purpose of this work is twofold .",
    "first we construct gibbs measures and prove their invariance by the flow of the nonlinear ( focusing and defocusing ) schrdinger equations ( defined in a strong sense ) in the presence of a harmonic potential . in the construction of these measures ,",
    "most of the difficulties appear for the focusing case ( for which case our results are only true for the cubic non linearity while in the defocusing case we have no restriction on the size of the non linearity ) .",
    "the non linear harmonic oscillator appears as a model in the context of bose - einstein condensates and our result gives some insights concerning the long time dynamics of these models .",
    "the second purpose of this work is to prove global well - posedness for the @xmath0 critical and super - critical nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) on @xmath1 , with or without harmonic potential , for data of low regularity .",
    "furthermore , we also obtain scattering when there is no harmonic potential .",
    "such kind of result seems to be out of reach of the present critical regularity deterministic methods .      our analysis here on the nls with harmonic potential enters into the line of research initiated by lebowitz - rose - speer in @xcite and aiming to construct gibbs measures for hamiltonian pde s .",
    "this program offers analytic challenges both in the measure construction and in the construction of a well - defined flow on the support of the measure .",
    "usually the support of the measure contains low regularity functions and this fact may be seen as one of the motivations of studying low regularity well - posedness of hamiltonian pde s . the approach of @xcite has been implemented successfully in several contexts , see e.g. bourgain @xcite , zhidkov @xcite , tzvetkov @xcite , burq - tzvetkov @xcite , oh @xcite , and the references therein .    a very natural context where one may try to construct gibbs measures",
    "is the nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nls ) with harmonic potential .",
    "indeed , in this case the spectrum of the linear problem is discrete and the construction of @xcite applies at least at formal level . as we already mentioned this context is natural since the nls with harmonic potential appears as a model in the bose - einstein condensates . as we shall see , it turns out that the construction of @xcite provides a gibbs measure supported by functions for which the corresponding cauchy problem was not known to be well - posed .",
    "in addition the density of the measure can not be evaluated by applying only deterministic arguments such as the sobolev inequality .",
    "all these facts present serious obstructions to make rigourous the gibbs measure construction .    on the other hand , recent works as @xcite showed",
    "that by applying more involved probabilistic techniques in combination with the existing deterministic technology for studying these problems one may approach the above difficulties successfully . in particular , in @xcite an approach to handle regularities for which the corresponding cauchy problem is ill - posed is developed .",
    "our goal here is to show that the nls with harmonic oscillator fits well in this approach .",
    "in fact , the eigenfunctions of the linear operator enjoy good estimates which is compensated by the bad separation properties of the spectrum .",
    "such a situation is particularly well adapted for the approach of @xcite .",
    "we are able to construct gibbs measures and the corresponding flow for the cubic focusing and arbitrary defocusing nls in the presence of harmonic potential .",
    "the analysis turns out to contain several significant new points with respect to previous works on the subject .",
    "indeed , it seems that it is the first case where the construction and analysis of gibbs measure with a strong flow can be performed on a non compact phase space .",
    "furthermore , taking into account the low regularity of the initial data , to develop a nice local cauchy theory at this level of regularity , one has to obtain somehow a gain in terms of derivatives . in the context of wave equations ,",
    "this gain can be obtained ( see  @xcite ) rather easily by first proving a gain at the probabilistic level in terms of @xmath2 regularity , and then balancing this gain on the non linearity and using that the non homogeneous wave propagator itself gains one derivative with respect to the source term regularity . for schrdinger equations , the situation is much less well behaved .",
    "indeed , no such gain of regularity occurs for the non homogeneous schrdinger propagator , and the starting point of our analysis was precisely that a gain of derivatives occurs at the probabilistic level in terms of @xmath2 regularity .",
    "however , this gain which would allow to perform the analysis for low power nonlinearities ( @xmath3 ) falls well short of what is needed to obtain the full range result ( @xmath4 ) in theorem  [ thm4 ] . as a consequence , our analysis requires a full bi - linear analysis at the probabilistic level ( see  ) .",
    "finally , let us mention some previous works on the non linear harmonic schrdinger equation  .",
    "the ( deterministic ) cauchy problem for was studied by carles in @xcite , whereas in @xcite , fukuizumi studies the stability of standing waves associated to .",
    "let us now describe in more details our results and consider thus the one dimensional cubic schrdinger equation with harmonic potential @xmath5 where @xmath6 is an odd integer and where either @xmath7 ( defocusing case ) or @xmath8 ( focusing case ) .",
    "the case of cubic nonlinearity , i.e. @xmath9 is the one which is most relevant in the context of bose - einstein condensates .",
    "we now state our result concerning ( [ nlsk ] ) . for more detailed results , see theorem  [ prop ] and theorem  [ thm4 ] below .",
    "consider the @xmath0 wiener measure on @xmath10 , @xmath11 , constructed on the harmonic oscillator eigenbasis , i.e. @xmath11 is the distribution of the random variable @xmath12 where @xmath13 are the hermite functions ( see ) and @xmath14 is a system of standard independent complex gaussian random variables . then in the defocusing case , for any order of nonlinearity @xmath15 , and in the focusing case for the cubic non linearity , the cauchy problem   is globally well posed for @xmath11-almost every initial data .",
    "furthermore , in both cases , there exists a gibbs measure , absolutely continuous with respect to @xmath11 , which is invariant by this flow .",
    "the equation is a hamiltonian pde with a hamiltonian @xmath16 ( see below ) . as usual",
    "the gibbs measure is a suitable renormalisation of the formal object @xmath17 .",
    "let us recall that the distribution function of a standard ( @xmath18 mean and @xmath19 variance ) gaussian complex random variable is @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the lebesgue measure on @xmath22 .",
    "notice that the results above are not in the `` small data '' class of results .",
    "indeed , it follows from our analysis that the measure @xmath11 is such that for every @xmath23 and every @xmath24 @xmath25 , i.e. our statistical set contains `` many '' initial data which are arbitrary large in @xmath26 , @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , we use no smallness argument in any place of the proof .",
    "we conjecture that our results hold when @xmath27 is replaced with a potential @xmath28 , so that @xmath29 for @xmath30 and @xmath31 ( in particular in such a situation there exists @xmath32 so that @xmath33 ) .",
    "let us define the sobolev spaces @xmath34 , associated to the harmonic oscillator @xmath35 via the norm @xmath36 .",
    "as can easily be seen , for any @xmath37 , the sobolev space of regularity @xmath38 , @xmath39 has zero @xmath11 measure but for every @xmath40 the space @xmath34 is of full @xmath11 measure . as a consequence ,",
    "the initial data in our result is not covered by the present well - posedness theory for ( [ nlsk ] ) .",
    "what is even worse : according to christ , colliander , tao  @xcite and  ( * ? ?",
    "* appendix ) ( notice that these results do not apply stricto sensu to the harmonic oscillator , but the proof can easily be modified ) , we know that as soon as @xmath41 the system   is supercritical and there exists no continuous flow on the sobolev spaces @xmath42 , for @xmath43 . as a consequence , even in the local in time",
    "analysis we need to appeal to a bi - linear probabilistic argument .",
    "the bi - linear nature of our probabilistic analysis can be seen though the following statement @xmath44 in our actual proof we do not make use of ( [ eq.carre ] ) but it was the starting point of our analysis for large @xmath45 s . we give the proof of in the appendix of this article .",
    "it turns out that the result described in the previous section has an interesting byproduct .",
    "thanks to an explicit transform , we are able to prove a scattering result for the @xmath0 critical and super - critical equation @xmath46 for @xmath47 of `` super - critical '' regularity .",
    "[ thm5 ] for any @xmath48 , the equation has for @xmath11-almost every initial data a unique global solution satisfying @xmath49 ( the uniqueness holds in a space continuously embedded in @xmath50 ) .",
    "moreover , the solution scatters in the following sense",
    ". there exists @xmath11 a.s .",
    "states @xmath51 so that @xmath52    the result of theorem  [ thm5 ] is a large data result and as far as we know there is no large data scattering results for the problem ( [ nls5 ] ) for data which are localized ( tending to zero at infinity ) but missing @xmath53 , i.e. it seems that the result of theorem  [ thm5 ] is out of reach of the present deterministic results to get scattering .",
    "we refer to @xcite for deterministic scattering results for in sobolev spaces , @xmath54 , @xmath55 .",
    "we also refer to @xcite for an approach for obtaining scattering results for @xmath0 critical problems .",
    "the result of theorem  [ thm5 ] is based on a transformation which reduces ( [ nls5 ] ) to a problem which fits in the scope of applicability of our previous analysis .",
    "however ( except in the scale invariant case @xmath56 ) , the reduced problem is not autonomous which makes the arguments more delicate .",
    "in particular there is no conserved energy for the reduced problem .",
    "however , we will be able to substitute this lack of conservation law by a monotonicity property which in turn will lead to the fact that , roughly speaking , the measure of a set can not decrease along the flow which is the key of the globalization argument . as a consequence , we are able to carry out the global existence strategy whilst no invariant measure is available ( see also colliander - oh  @xcite for results in this direction ) .      in the following section , we present in details the construction of the gibbs measure and we give a detailed measure invariance statement . in section  3",
    ", we give the proof of the approximation property of the gibbs measure by `` finite dimensional '' measures . in the next section ,",
    "we establish a functional calculus of @xmath35 , fundamental for the future analysis .",
    "the following two sections are devoted to establishing two families of linear dispersive estimates , namely the strichartz and the local smoothing estimates . here",
    "we develop the very classical deterministic estimates but also the more recent stochastic variants of them .",
    "the interplay between these two families of estimates is at the heart of our approach . in section  7",
    ", we use the estimates of the two previous sections together with the functional calculus to develop a local cauchy theory . in section  8",
    ", we present the global arguments , leading to almost sure global well - posedness on the support of the measure .",
    "notice that the path followed here has been much clarified with respect to our previous papers , and consequently is much more versatile . in section  9 , we prove the measure invariance . section  10 is devoted to the proof of theorem  [ thm5 ] .",
    "finally , in an appendix , we review some typical properties on the support of @xmath11 .",
    "we would like to thank p. grard for pointing out to us the bilinear estimates enjoyed by the hermite functions , which was the starting point of this work ( see lemma  [ patrick ] ) .",
    "we are also indebted to thomas duyckaerts for suggesting us to use the pseudo - conformal transformation in our analysis .",
    "set @xmath57 .",
    "the operator @xmath58 has a self - adjoint extension on @xmath59 ( still denoted by @xmath58 ) and has eigenfunctions @xmath60 which form a hilbertian basis of @xmath59 and satisfy @xmath61 with @xmath62 .",
    "indeed , @xmath63 are given by the formula @xmath64 the equation has the following hamiltonian @xmath65 write @xmath66 then in the coordinates @xmath67 the hamiltonian reads @xmath68 let us define the complex vector space @xmath69 by @xmath70 .",

    "let us now turn to the definition of the gibbs measure .",
    "write @xmath83 . for @xmath84 , consider the probability measures on @xmath85 defined by @xmath86 the measure @xmath87 defines a measure on @xmath69 via the map @xmath88 which will still be denoted by @xmath89 .",
    "notice that @xmath89 may be seen as the distribution of the @xmath69 valued random variable @xmath90 where @xmath91 is a system of independent , centered , @xmath0 normalized complex gaussians on a probability space @xmath92 .    in order to study convergence properties of @xmath93 as @xmath94",

    "notice also that the measure @xmath11 can be decomposed into @xmath113 where @xmath114 is the the distribution of the random variable on @xmath115 @xmath116    @xmath117 . in this case",
    "we can define the gibbs measure @xmath118 by @xmath119 we also define its finite dimensional approximations @xmath120",
    "let @xmath121 , @xmath122 be a continuous function with compact support ( a cut - off ) .",
    "define the measures @xmath123 as @xmath124    we have the following statement defining the gibbs measure associated to the equations .",

    "then for every @xmath129 , @xmath130 and we define @xmath131 .    in both cases , the sequence @xmath132 converges weakly to @xmath133 and for any borelian set @xmath134 , we have @xmath135    the result in the defocusing case is quite a direct application of the argument of @xcite .",
    "the construction of the measure in the focusing case is much more involved and is inspired by the work @xcite of the third author on the benjamin - ono equation .",
    "the main difficulty in this construction lies in proving that the weight @xmath128 belongs to @xmath136 .",
    "a first candidate for the weight @xmath128 would have been , but then the large deviation estimates are too weak to ensure the integrability of this weight with respect to the measure @xmath137 . a second guess",
    "would have been @xmath138 , as then the same large deviation estimates and gagliardo - nirenberg inequalities would ensure this integrability .",
    "unfortunately , on the support of the measure @xmath11 , the @xmath0 norm is almost surely infinite and this choice of weight would lead to a trivial ( vanishing ) invariant measure .",
    "the renormalized ( square of the ) @xmath0 norm provides us with an acceptable substitute to this latter choice .",
    "let us also observe that if we vary @xmath139 then we get the support of @xmath11 ( see proposition  [ union ] below ) .",
    "notice also that this choice of weight is reminiscent of bourgain s work  @xcite where a similar renormalization is performed at the level of the equation itself rather than the level of the gibbs measure .",
    "it is now a natural question whether the measure @xmath118 constructed in theorem  [ prop ] is indeed invariant by a well - defined flow of .",
    "it turns out to be the case as shows the following statement .",

    "let us remark that the uniqueness statement can also be formulated as the fact that the flow of ( [ nlsk ] ) on smooth data ( for instance @xmath53 ) can be extended in a unique fashion a.s . on the support of the measure @xmath118 .",
    "notice also that in this paper , we had to modify the definition of the finite dimensional approximations measures @xmath162 with respect to previous results on the subject ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , the lack of continuity of the rough projectors @xmath82 on our resolution spaces forbid the usual approximation results ( see e.g.  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 1.2 ) ) . as a consequence ,",
    "our new measures enjoy better approximation properties ( see  ) , but the invariance properties we have to prove are stronger ( see corollary  [ cor.inv ] ) .",
    "we believe nevertheless this new approach is more natural .",
    "in this section we prove theorem  [ prop ] . as we already mentioned , the main issue is the construction of the measure for with @xmath9 in the focusing case .",

    "* lemma 4.2 . ) for a proof in a more general setting .",
    "let us notice that in our particular setting , the random variable being a gaussian variable of variance @xmath163 , this estimate is also an easy consequence of the growth of the @xmath164th moments of centered gaussians ( uniform with respect to the variance ) .",
