    "the multiobjective optimization is encountered in many real world applications @xcite . for a specific policy ,",
    "the decision maker may find it advantageous for one goal but disadvantageous for others .",
    "a traditional way to deal with this issue is to impose a priori preference reflecting the relative importance of different objectives ; however , the final solution just indicates a decision maker s satisfaction , and it might be dissatisfactory for other decision makers .    to ameliorate the problem , the concept of _ pareto optimality _ and other relevant concepts are introduced .",
    "these are defined as follows :    \\1 ) _ pareto dominance _ :",
    "a feasible solution @xmath0 is said to pareto dominate another feasible solution @xmath1 , denoted as @xmath2 , if @xmath3 where , @xmath4 is the @xmath5th objective function , @xmath6 is the number of objectives .",

    "the pareto front , denoted as @xmath12 , is defined by @xmath13    the introduction of _ pareto optimality _ allows us to find a set of pareto optimal solutions simultaneously , independent of the decision maker s priori preference .",
    "in the past few decades , evolutionary - based and nature - inspired multiobjective optimization techniques have drawn considerable attention for scheduling problems@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we introduce a recently new heuristics called state transition algorithm @xcite as the basic search engine for the multiobjective optimization .",
    "a non - dominated sort approach is used to select the best from a candidate state set , and the best state is stored using a pareto archive strategy .",
    "experimental results have testified the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm .",
    "in the field of joinery manufacturing , jobs with similar materials can be scheduled together to minimize the amount of materials used ; therefore , reducing the cost .",
    "for example , based on the cost savings matrix shown in table [ costex1 ] , pairing job1 and job2 will provide saving in the cost equivalent to 4 units .",
