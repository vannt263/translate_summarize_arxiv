    "<S> the origin of these peaks has been discussed  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> essentially the peak arises from a collective spin excitation mode corresponding to @xmath47 and negligibly small im@xmath48 . </S>",
    "<S> it is due to a step - like rise of im@xmath49 at its gap edge and then a logarithmic singularity in re@xmath49 via the kramers - kroenig relation . </S>",
    "<S> this singularity shifts downward the collective mode energy and leads it to situate in the spin gap , so no damping is expected for the mode . </S>",
    "<S> the step - like rise in im@xmath49 arises from the flat band(extended van hove singularity ) which is observed near @xmath50  @xcite and the property that @xmath51 for transition momentum @xmath52 due to the @xmath2-wave gap symmetry  @xcite .    </S>",

    "<S> the corresponding lineshape at @xmath59 is expressed by the line with open squares in the main panel . </S>",
    "<S> due to the coupling to the spin resonance mode , the whole structure of the self - energy @xmath36 is very similar to that of the unperturbed spin susceptibility @xmath49 ( for a comparison , see fig.2 in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) . when frequency @xmath62 is below about 0.5@xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath64 is equal to zero . above 0.5@xmath63 </S>",
    "<S> , a step - like rise can be seen and is followed by a decrease . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , @xmath65 has a peak at about the center of the step - like rise of @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> the quasiparticle energy is given by the pole of the green s function , which is the solution @xmath67 of the equation @xmath68=0 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we also show @xmath69 ( dotted line ) in the inset of fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> the lowest binding - energy solution of the pole equation @xmath70 is @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> meanwhile , the damping of this mode which is proportional to @xmath66 and @xmath72 approaches to zero . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , it gives rise to a quasiparticle mode which is denoted by the sharp low binding - energy peak in the lineshape shown in fig.2 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath62 increases further , the pole equation does not satisfy anymore . near the end of the step - like rise in @xmath64 </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath69 reaches its local maximum , meanwhile the imaginary part of the self - energy is also near its maximum , therefore a dip appears . </S>",
    "<S> it indicates that the dip is caused by the step - like rise in the imaginary part of the self energy . </S>",
    "<S> after the dip , @xmath73 decreases with @xmath62 and near @xmath74 , it reaches a local minimum . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to the broad higher binding - energy hump .    </S>",
    "<S> we now discuss the dispersion of the hump / dip / peak structure . at the momentum range below and slightly above the fermi wavevector @xmath75 , the low binding - energy peak </S>",
    "<S> nearly does not disperse with @xmath76 . above @xmath77 , </S>",
    "<S> the peak starts to move to higher binding - energy but can not move further than that dip seen around @xmath78 . </S>",
    "<S> then , it disappears gradually with the further increasing of @xmath76 , due to the unavailable quasiparticle states above the fermi surface at low temperatures . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , the dip also disappears gradually . </S>",
    "<S> these behaviors were observed in experiments  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the position of the peak determines the normalized gap size due to spin fluctuations . in fig.3 </S>",
    "<S> , we show a typical dependence of the renormalized gap magnitude on the fermi surface angle @xmath79 , which is the angle between @xmath78 and @xmath80 . in general , the next order deviation from the d - wave starts from @xmath1 and </S>",
    "<S> can be described by the form @xmath81 . </S>",
    "<S> however , our results indicate that the best fit is @xmath82 $ ] with @xmath83 being around 0.88 - 0.94 . </S>",
    "<S> this particular form was also used in ref.@xcite to fit their arpes data with roughly the same range of @xmath83 .    in fig.4(a ) , we show the doping dependence of the positions of the hump and the peak , and compare our results with the experiment  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> one can see that our result for the peak is in reasonably good agreement with the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> we note that , if we just include the self - energy @xmath84 in our calculation as was done in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , a doping independence for the peak positions is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> hence the renormalization of the gap by including @xmath37 is important . </S>",
    "<S> the magnitude of the position of the hump and its trend with the doping variation are also consistent with the experiment . </S>",
    "<S> however , the slope of the curve of hump versus hole density is flatter than the experimental result . </S>",
    "<S> considering that all parameters in our calculations are chosen according to the well - known values and the only adjusted parameter @xmath85 is fixed by the experimental observation on af instability , these results are quite satisfactory . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the ratio between the hump and peak energy at @xmath50 on doping concentrations is shown in fig.4(b ) . </S>",
    "<S> a flat variation for a wide doping level is seen . </S>",
    "<S> this result again agrees with the experiment  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> an important quantity addressed in the arpes experiments is the peak - dip separation , which is shown to be close to the mode energy of the neutron peak  @xcite . from a comparison of fig.2 in ref.@xcite and fig.3 </S>",
    "<S> , one can see that the peak - dip separation in our calculations is lower than the neutron peak . </S>",
    "<S> however , we would like to point out that this separation is sensitive to the experimental energy resolution simulated to be @xmath86 here . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath87 increases , the self - energy @xmath64 decreases and the quasiparticle peak broads , consequently the peak - dip separation increases . </S>",
    "<S> however the position of the neutron scattering peak does not change for different @xmath87 , it just becomes broad . </S>",
    "<S> so , this comparison is also sensitive to @xmath87 . </S>",
    "<S> but , as noted above , the dip stems from the step - like edge in @xmath64 which is in turn caused by the coupling to the collective spin mode . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , this spin resonance mode also arises from the step - like edge in im@xmath49 which is due to the extended van hove singularity near @xmath50 and the @xmath2-wave symmetry . therefore , an intimate relation between them is suggested . </S>",
    "<S> thus , our result seems to provide a consistent picture for the spin resonance peak and the hump / dip / peak structure based on the spin excitations in a @xmath2-wave superconductor .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , p.j.white _ et al . _  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite have investigated the effect of nonmagnetic zn impurities on the lineshape of @xmath88 by arpes experiment . </S>",
    "<S> they found that the dip is diminished with zn doping . </S>",
    "<S> according to the previous studies by one of the authors ( li )  @xcite , zn doping will wash out the van hove singularity and cause the decays of quasiparticle states . </S>",
    "<S> so , the enhancement in re@xmath89 and the step - like rise in im@xmath89 will be suppressed . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , no clear resonance neutron peak appears at certain zn doping concentration  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because the dip is suggested to come from the coupling to the spin resonance mode here , the disappearance of the dip upon zn doping may be naturally explained in the present framework .    </S>",
    "<S> it is quite encouraging that our results fits various kinds of arpes and neutron scattering data with correct trend and reasonable magnitude . </S>",
    "<S> there is only one adjustable parameter which is fixed by the experimentally observed af instability . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , our investigation represents a natural extension to the work of brinckmann and lee  @xcite , which addressed the doping dependence of the resonance peak in neutron scatterings . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , in comparison to the qualitative study by abanov and chubukov  @xcite , our study further furnishes a quantitative basis .    in summary , </S>",
    "<S> based on the slave - boson approach to the @xmath0 model , we show that the anomalous peak / dip / hump structure observed in the arpes experiments arises from the coupling of quasiparticle to the collective spin excitations which gives rise to the resonance peak in the neutron scattering experiments . </S>",
    "<S> our investigation seems to give a consistent explanation for the resonance neutron peak and the arpes spectra based on the spin excitations in a @xmath2-wave superconductor .    </S>",
