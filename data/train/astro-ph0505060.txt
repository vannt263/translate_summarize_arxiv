    "in the cores of the majority of rich galaxy clusters the radiative cooling time of the hot , x - ray emitting intracluster medium ( icm ) is significantly shorter than the hubble time . in the absence of heat sources ,",
    "the gas will cool and flow towards the bottom of the cluster potential well : hence the name ` cooling - flow ' clusters .",
    "in fact , recent x - ray observations  in particular _ xmm - newton _ high - resolution spectroscopy  have ruled out the presence of significant cooling flows ( kaastra et al .",
    "2001 ; molendi & pizzolato 2001 ; peterson et al . 2001 ; tamura et al .",
    "2001 ; kaastra et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) : the radiating gas in the cores of these clusters is heated somehow .",
    "the most promising heating mechanism is feedback from the active galactic nucleus ( agn ) hosted by the central galaxy of the cluster .",
    "the basic idea of this agn / cooling - flow scenario is that the cooling icm in the cluster core is heated by outbursts from the central agn : an unsteady equilibrium may be achieved , in the sense that the energy input from the agn balances the radiative losses of the icm over the lifetime of the cluster .",
    "different models have been proposed in which the agn heats the thermal plasma with either mechanical ( binney & tabor 1993 ; tabor & binney 1995 ) or radiative feedback ( ciotti & ostriker 1997 , 2001 ; ostriker & ciotti 2005 ) .",
    "although both processes might be effective to some extent and possibly cooperate , here we focus on mechanical heating , whose relevance to many observed systems is apparent ( e.g. blanton et al . 2004 and",
    "omma & binney 2004 and references therein ) .    the cooling luminosity @xmath2 can be determined directly from x - ray observations ( e.g. peres et al .",
    "by contrast , the mechanical power @xmath10 of the radio sources is not only much harder to determine observationally ( e.g. bicknell 1995 ; eilek 2004 ) , but it is expected to be time - variable ( e.g. ulrich , maraschi & urry 1997 ) . if @xmath10 varies with time , how can it be compared with the cooling luminosity in observed systems ? this paper addresses this question .",
    "the mechanical luminosity of an agn is expected to fluctuate on time - scales that range from months to several gigayears , but from the point of view of the symbiosis between the agn and its cooling flow , only time - scales in excess of @xmath11 are of interest .",
    "it is clearly impossible to probe such time - scales by monitoring individual agn .",
    "instead we must draw inferences by studying the demography of agn and cooling flows .",
    "such studies are still in their infancy , but it is nevertheless worthwhile to develop a methodology that they can employ , and to see what conclusions this methodology and currently available data lead us to .    cooling flows vary in size from those associated with large clusters of galaxies , such as abell 1795 , to those associated with individual elliptical galaxies , such as ngc 4472 .",
    "we start by scaling out the variations in the mechanical luminosities @xmath10 of agn that simply reflect variations in size rather than temporal variability , by focusing on the dimensionless variable @xmath12 where @xmath2 is the x - ray luminosity of the cooling flow , which is expected to vary at most slowly and weakly with time .",

    "models such a variable through the fourier representation @xmath16 the complex numbers @xmath17 are random variables .",
    "the simplest conjecture is that these variables are statistically independent of one another , and have phases that are uniformly distributed in @xmath18 . in this case",

    "it is easy to show that with this model the expectation value of the @xmath24th power of @xmath25 is @xmath26 the appearance of @xmath27 in the exponential signals the skewness of the probability distribution ( [ eqln ] ) .",
    "the larger the value of @xmath24 , the more important this skewness is in the sense that rare excursions to high @xmath25 more strongly dominate @xmath28 .",
    "a measure of the importance of skewness is the probability that an individual measurement of @xmath29 will return a value smaller than @xmath30 .",
    "one can readily show that @xmath31.\\ ] ] figure [ plessfig ] plots this function of @xmath32 . when @xmath33 , there is a high probability of finding the luminosity to be smaller than its mean value because much of the total energy output comes during infrequent outbursts .",
    "we are interested in the properties of the light - curve observed with a finite time - resolution , i.e. , averaged over a given time @xmath34 .",
    "we define this ` coarse - grained ' light - curve as @xmath35 where the filter function @xmath36 satisfies @xmath37 and is non  zero in a region of width @xmath34 around the origin .",

    "thus , for any power spectrum @xmath3 , @xmath48 is a non  increasing function of @xmath34 , with @xmath49 and @xmath50 : the variance is smaller when averaging over longer @xmath34 .",
    "an agn involves an enormous dynamical range of time - scales , from the few days characteristic of the dynamical time at the event horizon to the hundreds of megayears required for the development of a cooling catastrophe in the core of the cooling flow . in view of this great span of time - scales",
    ", one might expect the power spectrum of the agn to be a power law in frequency .",
    "so we assume that @xmath4 has a power spectrum in the form @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the power at some reference frequency @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 . @xmath56 and @xmath57 are , respectively , the maximum and minimum time - scale of variability .",
    "there is no difficulty in principle in deriving equations for a general power - law index @xmath8 , but we shall argue that @xmath8 must lie close to unity , and the discussion is greatly simplified if we specialize to @xmath58 at this point . the case @xmath58 is associated with ` flicker noise ' , which empirically arises in diverse physical phenomena that range from electrical noise , to wind speeds , to earthquake magnitudes ( e.g.press  1978 ; milotti 2002 ) . in case of flicker noise the relation between the variance and the power spectrum is @xmath59 the amplitude of flicker noise",
    "is conveniently characterized by the dimensionless quantity @xmath9 , which is independent of @xmath60 .",
    "the variability of x - ray emission from agn has been studied on time - scales shorter than @xmath61 . when the x - ray power spectra normalized to @xmath62 , while here we refer to the power spectrum of @xmath63 : however , the two have the same slope and amplitude as long as the variance of @xmath64 is small with respect to @xmath62 . ] of seyfert galaxies at frequencies",

    "hence , the only power - law indices that we can consistently adopt are @xmath7 .",
    "there is a vast difference between the longest time - scales on which the power spectra have been empirically determined , and the time - scales @xmath69 of interest here .",
    "hence to extrapolate blindly from the observed @xmath70 fluctuations out to @xmath71 ones is a very hazardous proceeding .",
    "fortunately , independent estimates of the duty cycle of quasars provides a degree of reassurance .",
    "ciotti & ostriker ( 2001 ) define the duty cycle of a source with light - curve @xmath64 as @xmath72 where the second equality follows from equation ( [ eqavln ] ) .",

    "these values are larger by a factor @xmath78 than the amplitudes measured by uttley et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for seyfert galaxies at frequencies higher by @xmath79 .",
    "if @xmath8 differed significantly from unity , we would expect the amplitudes to be many orders of magnitude different , so we must have @xmath7 .",
    "microquasars are radio - jet emitting x - ray binaries made up by a stellar - mass black hole ( bh ) and a companion star , and seem in many respects small - scale versions of agn ( mirabel & rodriguez 1999 ) .",
    "it is widely accepted that on small to intermediate scales these objects are identical to agn scaled down in both length- and time - scales by the ratio of the black holes schwarzschild radii @xmath80 .",
    "hence , we can study the temporal variability of microquasars on human time - scales to get information about the variability of agn on time - scales much longer than those that can be directly probed .",
    "it seems likely that the scaling holds at out to time - scales bh , the characteristic viscous time - scale at @xmath81 is roughly @xmath82 .",
    "longer time - scales correspond to larger radii , at which agn accretion disks might be truncated by self - gravity ( e.g. burderi , king & szuszkiewicz 1998 ; goodman 2003 ) . ]",

    "thus from studies of microquasars we can estimate the amplitude of the agn power spectrum at frequencies corresponding to @xmath86 , and then use our knowledge that @xmath8 can not significantly differ from unity to extrapolate it to frequencies lower by a factor @xmath87 .",
    "most studies of the low - frequency power spectrum of microquasars focus on x - ray emission .",
    "reig , papadakis & kylafis ( 2002 ) find that the power spectrum of the microquasar grs  1915 + 105 is well fitted by a power law ( equation  [ eqps ] ) with index @xmath7 in the frequency range @xmath88 to @xmath89 .",
    "a power spectrum with this slope , over the same frequency range , has been also found for the x - ray light curve of cygnus x-3 by choudhury et al .",
    "( 2004 ) .    however , we are interested in the variability of the kinetic power of the jet , which is expected to be traced by radio emission rather than by x - rays .",

    "nipoti , blundell & binney ( 2005 ) show that at these low frequencies the _ slopes _ of the radio power spectra of the microquasars cygnus  x-3 and grs  1915 + 105 are similar to those found in x - rays .",

    "the radio emission of cygnus  x-3 ( at 2.25 and 8.3 ghz ) has been monitored by the gbi - nasa monitoring program ( waltman et al .",

    "we find that the daily - averaged 2.25-ghz radio light - curve of cygnus  x-3 has logarithmic variance @xmath93 over the period @xmath94 .",
    "if we adopt @xmath95 , @xmath96 for the boundaries of the frequency range sampled , equation  ( [ eqoneoverf ] ) implies that the power spectrum of the radio emission has amplitude @xmath97 , about two orders of magnitude larger than that found in x - rays .",
    "similarly , we estimated the amplitude of the radio power spectrum of the microquasar grs  1915 + 105 , using its 2.25-ghz light - curve obtained by the gbi monitoring program over about @xmath98 ( see foster et al .",
    "we found that grs  1915 + 105 has amplitude @xmath99 at @xmath100ghz , also much larger than in x - rays .",

    "given a characteristic time @xmath112 associated with the bubble , an estimate of the average kinetic luminosity of the agn over @xmath112 is then @xmath113    the definition of @xmath112 is controversial : if we consider @xmath112 as the _ age _ of the bubble , this is of order the time @xmath114 required for the cavity to rise at the speed of sound from the centre to its current location ( gull & northover 1973 ; churazov et al .",
    "alternatively , the age of the bubble can be defined as the time required for the icm to refill the displaced volume ( mcnamara et al . 2000 ) .",

    "the number of systems in which cavities have been accurately observed is small , while the radio luminosities of thousands of radio galaxies have been measured .",
    "it is clear that the radio power represents a very small fraction of the kinetic power emitted by the agn ( e.g. eilek 2004 ) , but the radio luminosity may be a useful indicator of the mechanical power . hence , much larger samples could be assembled if it were possible to establish a relation between the mechanical and radio luminosities of sources .",
    "cavities in the x - ray emitting icm are classified as radio - filled if non - thermal radio emission at a given frequency coincides with the x - ray - depressed area ; otherwise they are called ` ghost ' cavities radio data might appear as radio - filled at lower frequencies , depending on the break frequency of the radio spectrum .",

    "thus , our model predicts that the radio luminosity function of early - type galaxies is log - normal with variance @xmath199 , where @xmath174 is the variance due to radio - variability of each source and @xmath192 is the variance in the distribution of x - ray emission of bright ellipticals .",
    "we test this prediction by fitting the local radio luminosity function of early - type galaxies of the first-2dfgrs ( magliocchetti et al .",

    "we note that the best  fit gives @xmath205 , consistent with values of @xmath174 found analysing b04 s sample of central radio galaxies in cooling cores ( section  3.2 ) plus a contribution from intrinsic scatter in x - ray luminosity .    we based our analysis of the radio luminosity function on the assumption that most bright elliptical and s0 galaxies have agn - powered radio emission .",
    "we can check this assumption a posteriori by comparing the best  fitting number density @xmath193 with the number density of luminous early - type galaxies .",
    "we assume that the b - band optical luminosity function of early - type galaxies @xmath206 is a schechter function with slope @xmath207 , characteristic luminosity @xmath208 , and normalization @xmath209 .",
    "then the number density of objects brighter than @xmath210 is @xmath211 . if we consider the best  fitting b - band luminosity function determined by madgwick et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for the early - type galaxies of the 2dfgrs [ @xmath212 , @xmath213 , and we assume that all early - type galaxies with @xmath214 are radio galaxies , we find a number density @xmath215 .",
    "thus , @xmath216 is a factor of @xmath217 larger than @xmath193 found from our best ",
    "fitting log - normal distribution .",
    "the discrepancy between the two number densities is easily explained by our arbitrary choice of @xmath208 as the minimum b - band luminosity of a radio galaxy , and by uncertainties on the faint - end of radio luminosity function .",
    "we conclude that available radio data are consistent with the proposed scenario , in which each bright elliptical oscillates , over its lifetime , along the radio luminosity function , spanning several orders of magnitude in radio power .",
    "interestingly , results of high - redshift radio surveys also suggest that most massive ellipticals have experienced one or more episodes of powerful radio activity during their lifetime ( rawlings 2003 ) .",
    "finally , we stress that the proposed picture naturally explains the very large scatter in radio luminosity for radio galaxies with the same bh mass ( lacy et al .",
    "2001 ; mclure et al .",
    "2004 , and references therein ) as a consequence of the strong time - variability of their radio emission ( see also nipoti et al .",
    "since the cosmic density of matter is very inhomogeneous on small scales , it is not possible to derive its global properties from individual measurements of the density in small regions : the characteristics of large - scale structure must be determined from a model of the fluctuating density field , and the values that one derives from it of statistical quantities , such as the mass variance .",
    "similarly , the temporal variability of agn is too large to ignore . we can not hope to understand the radio luminosity function , or to test the agn / cooling - flow model , without a model of agn variability .",
    "the normalized mechanical luminosities of a sample of agn , @xmath120 , should show scatter only because of temporal variability , and be free of differences in the scales of systems . since the variability of agn is known to be large and @xmath29",
    "is an inherently positive variable , the natural variable to model is @xmath218 , and the default assumption to make is that @xmath4 is a gaussian random process .",
    "this assumption implies that individual measures of @xmath29 should have a log - normal distribution , so the time - sequence of @xmath0 is completely characterized by the power spectrum @xmath3 of @xmath4 .",
    "the enormous range of physical scales involved in agn suggests that the power spectrum will be a power law @xmath219 .",
    "several considerations suggest that @xmath7 , the index characteristic of flicker noise .",
    "first , on the short time - scales that are directly accessible , monitoring of agn yields @xmath7 .",
    "second , a comparison of the amplitudes measured in these studies with that inferred from the short duty cycle of quasars requires @xmath7 .",
    "third , microquasars , whose power spectra can be probed over a camparatively wide range of frequencies , are found to have @xmath7 .",
    "finally , diverse physical phenomena are found to be characterized by flicker - noise power spectra , so it would not be surprising if agn conformed to this pattern .",
    "we estimate the spectral amplitude of the mechanical luminosity of agn at the centres of cooling flows by assuming that energy radiated by the thermal plasma is on the average replaced by the mechanical input of the central agn , and that x - ray cavities probe the mechanical luminosity averaged over time - scales @xmath220 .",
    "the amplitudes required are slightly larger than those that characterize the radio output of two microquasars , and of the order of those estimated from the duty cycle of quasars .",
    "we estimate the coefficients @xmath150 in an assumed proportionality between the mechanical luminosity of an agn and its radio power , either at @xmath135ghz or bolometric .",
    "we do this in two ways . in the first we directly fit a straight line to the correlation between radio and mechanical luminosities of sources that have radio - loud cavities .",
    "alternatively , we fit our model of agn variability to the radio data of all sources with cavities , whether radio - loud or ghost , under the assumption that @xmath184 .",
    "the two methods yield compatible ranges of values of @xmath150 .",
    "the available observations fail to constrain the model s parameters strongly , both because the currently available sample of sources is small and because our understanding of the physics of these sources is poor . despite the significant advance that was made possible by the discovery of numbers of x - ray cavities , measurements of the ratio of radio to mechanical luminosity",
    "are still extremely uncertain .",
    "also , our analysis clearly shows the importance of determining the duty cycle of the radio sources in order to quantify their contribution in the energetics of cooling flows : in particular , it is crucial to estimate the amplitude of their power spectrum on time - scales @xmath221 . we conclude that larger samples of agn / cooling - flow pairs and better theoretical models of radio sources are needed to challenge the agn / cooling - flow model .    in a scenario",
    "in which agn radio activity is strongly variable with time , the local luminosity function of radio galaxies should be interpreted as the distribution of the time spent by a galaxy at a given radio luminosity rather than a distribution of sources with different intrinsic properties .",
    "this picture is supported by the observational finding that early - type galaxies hosting supermassive bhs with the same mass span several orders of magnitude in radio power .",
    "we showed that the first-2dfgrs luminosity function of radio galaxies can be fitted by a log - normal distribution , consistent with the hypothesis that in all early - type galaxies , the cooling flow is balanced by a strongly variable radio source .",
    "our model predicts a turnover at luminosities similar to the lowest currently probed .",
    "any turnover in the luminosity function of agn will be to a large extent masked by radio emission from nuclear starbursts .",
    "nonetheless , the prediction of a turnover is interesting and will be tested by forthcoming radio surveys with instruments such as the square kilometer array .",
