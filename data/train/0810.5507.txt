    "laplacian canonical determinism ( quoting laplace himself _  we may regard the present state of the universe as the effect of its past and the cause of its future ... \" _ ) has been called into question by the studies of h. poincar and j. hadamard of complex highly unstable trajectories of a system of three bodies moving under the effect of gravitation forces . much later",
    "e. lorenz considered some simplified model for atmospheric convection with a small number of degrees of freedom and also found _ chaotic _ motions , the term chaotic meaning that small changes in the initial conditions produce big perturbations in the behaviour of the trajectories of motion ( sometimes popularly referred to as the  butterfly effect \" ) .",
    "dynamics may therefore exibit a chaotic ( random ? ) behaviour even when the governing equations are deterministic . beyond classical dynamics ,",
    "the most convincing illustration of this is , of course , quantum mechanics .    in turbulence , modelized by the ( deterministic ) incompressible navier - stokes equation @xmath0 with small viscosity coefficient @xmath1",
    ", such classical chaotic phenomena really occur . on the other hand statistical effects",
    "also manifest themselves : they are called _ coherent structures _ ( for example the jupiter s red spot or aores anticyclone ) .",
    "we refer to @xcite for an interesting discussion of these problems",
    ".    there are various possible reasons to look for probabilistic content in fluid dynamics .",
    "the obvious observations that initial conditions are difficult to know precisely and that the observable computed in practice have to be statistical quantities points out to some statistical approach , found , for example , in works of vishik , fursikov , foias , etc .",
    "( @xcite ) .",
    "one can of course add some noise to given deterministic systems and study the randomly perturbed ones : then the resulting properties depend on the chosen perturbation and these studies do not describe the chaotic behaviour of the deterministic equations themselves .",
    "these approaches have known an impressive development in the recent years .",
    "the intrinsic instability of the hydrodynamical motions , more precisely those modeled by the euler equations ( the case where the viscosity is zero ) was explained geometrically without using probability theory by v. arnold ( @xcite ) . in",
    "his famous paper arnold showed that the solution of euler equation @xmath2 corresponds to the velocity of a flow which is critical for the action functional @xmath3=\\frac{1}{2 } \\int ||\\dot g ( t)||^2_{l^2}dt\\ ] ] where @xmath4 denote volume preserving diffeomorphisms of the underlying manifold .",
    "accordingly euler equation can be regarded as the geodesic equation for the @xmath5 metric and one derives the instability of the motion strictly from geometrical arguments , namely from the negativity of some curvature of the space of diffeomorphisms .",
    "this is not in contradiction with the formation of the abovementionned coherent structures since arnold describes the so - called _ lagrangian _ flow , namely @xmath6 such that @xmath7 and not the usual _",
    "eulerian _ flow ( of velocities ) .",
    "it seems that there is a kind of chaotic behaviour of the lagrangian flow and a more predictable character of the eulerian flow @xmath8 .",
    "we note that this  principle \" seems to apply as well to properties like ergodicity . indeed , there are reasons to believe that the flow of velocities is ergodic ( cf .",
    "@xcite or a more recent discussion in @xcite ) , invariant measures can be constructed ( cf . @xcite and references therein for the two - dimensional periodic case ) . on the other hand",
    "the lagrangian flow is not ergodic ; this has been proved in @xcite , for the periodic @xmath9-dimensional case .",
    "the statistical effects observed in the evolution of the system are , on the other hand , related to the large number of degrees of freedom in presence , a situation quite distinct from the dynamical systems studied by poincar or lorenz .",
    "following an idea of yasue etal ( @xcite ) , consisting in interpreting the laplacian term of navier - stokes equation as origin of the random behaviour of fluid particles and the drift as an avereged velocity on the stochastic ( lagrangian ) motion , one is able to    * obtain an intrinsic probabilistic representation of navier - stokes solution ; * derive it as a solution of a ( stochastic ) variational principle ; * deduce the corresponding ( stochastic ) equation for geodesics , the associated jacobi equation and therefore consider the stability properties of the motion .",
    "the methodology thus generalize probabilistically arnold s approach to the case where viscosity is not zero .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the group of volume preserving homeomorphisms on a manifold .",
    "throughout this paper we consider this manifold to be @xmath11 , the two dimensional torus , for simplicity , since we can as well treat the torus in any dimension ( cf .",
