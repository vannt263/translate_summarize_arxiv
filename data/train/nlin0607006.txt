    "the phenomenon of turbulent drag reduction describes the increase in the throughput in turbulent flows by adding tiny amounts of polymers . in this way for instance",
    "the amount of liquid that is transported in a pipe for a given pressure drop can be increased significantly .",
    "this implies a wide range of industrial applications , and consequently the effect , discovered in 1944 by toms @xcite , has been studied intensively over the past decades ( see e.g. ref .",
    "the aim of this paper is to rationalize and understand the change from drag enhancement to drag reduction by rod - like polymers in turbulent wall - bounded flows as a function of the reynolds number re @xcite . to this aim we present new experimental data and a theoretical analysis .",
    "a classical example of the phenomenon of interest is shown in fig .",
    "[ virk ] which pertains to pipe flow @xcite .",
    "we denote the velocity field @xmath0 and its mean over time as @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the distance from the wall . with the mean",

    "[ virk ] presents this quantity as a function of re in the traditional prandtl - karman coordinates @xmath10 vs. re@xmath11 .",
    "the straight continuous line denoted by ` n ' presents the newtonian universal law .",
    "data points below this line are indicative of a drag enhancement , i.e. , an increase in the dissipation due to the addition of the polymer .",
    "converesely , data points above the line correspond to drag reduction , which is always bound by the maximal drag reduction ( mdr ) asymptote represented by the dashed line denoted by ` m ' .",
    "this figure shows data for a rod - like polymer ( a polyelectrolyte in aqueous solution at very low salt concentration ) and shows how drag enhancement for low values of re crosses over to drag reduction at large values of re @xcite .",
    "one of the results of this paper is the theory presented below , that reproduces the phenomena shown in fig .",
    "[ virk ] in a satisfactory manner .",
    "+    it is interesting to note that with _",
    "flexible _ polymers the situation is very different , and there is no drag enhancement at any value of re .",
    "the reason for this distinction will be made clear below as well .    in sec .",
    "2 we present new experimental results in which drag reduction is measured as a function of the reynolds number , and for different concentrations of the rod - like polymer . we determine the rheological properties of these solutions simultaneously , so that the rheology of the solutions is known . in sec .",
    "3 we review the basic theoretical approach to drag reduction in general , and by rod - like polymers in particular .",
    "we discuss the effect of the polymers on the fluid flow in three cases : high re flows , low re flows and intermediate re flows , respectively . in sec .",
    "4 we explain how to solve the equations and present the results and their comparison to the experiments .",
    "discussions and the conclusions are presented in sec .",
    "in this section we describe the experimental results obtained using well - characterized rod - like polymer solutions .",
    "the turbulence cell has been previously described in detail by cadot et al.@xcite .",
    "a turbulent flow is generated in a closed cylindrical cell ( of volume three liters ) between two counter - rotating disks spaced one disk diameter apart .",
    "the disks are driven by dc motors .",
    "the motors are configured to keep the disks rotating at a constant angular velocity @xmath12 , independently of the torque exerted by the turbulent fluid on the disks .",
    "thus , all the experiments presented here are performed at constant angular velocity .",
    "all experiments were repeated with pure water and with the water seeded with the polymers . in both cases",
    "we define @xcite the integral reynolds number as re@xmath13 , where @xmath8 is the density and @xmath14 is the radius of the disks . to determine the energy dissipation in the turbulent fluid ( from which we also infer the amount of drag reduction or drag enhancement )",
    ", we take advantage of the fact that we are in a closed system . all the kinetic energy fed into the flow",
    "will eventually be dissipated viscously , leading to a temperature increase of the fluid : by measuring the temperature increase in time @xmath15 we can also estimate the power dissipated by the turbulent flow .",
    "the temperature is measured with a pt thermocouple probe with an accuracy of @xmath16c . from our temperature measurements",
    ", we can then deduce the percentage of drag reduction ( @xmath17 ) from : @xmath18 \\ .\\ ] ] for the polymer we use solutions of xanthane , a stiff rodlike polymer with an average molecular weight of @xmath19 .",
    "the rheology of the polymer solutions was studied on a reologica stress - tech ( cone - plate geometry ) rheometer .",
    "the latter is equipped with a normal force transducer , and has a large cone ( 55 mm ) with a small angle ( @xmath20 ) in order to be able to detect small normal stress differences at high shear rates .",
    "changing the concentration allows us to modify the shear - dependent viscosity of the solutions . the apparent viscosity decreases with increasing shear rate , i.e. , the fluid is shear thinning .",
    "a satisfactory description of most of the data for high shear rates can be obtained using the ostwald - de waele power law model @xcite for the viscosity @xmath21 : @xmath22 ; the viscosity shows a power law dependence on the shear rate @xmath23 . the validity of this model is limited to a certain range of shear rates , depending on the concentration @xmath24 of the polymer solution ; the range and constants @xmath25 and @xmath26 are reported in @xcite .",
    "for the whole concentration range studied here ( @xmath27 wppm ) , no measurable normal stresses were found in the range of shear rates studied ( @xmath28 ) ; the uncertainty on the measurements is of the order of 10pa .",
    "the other important difference in the rheology of the rigid polymers , compared to solutions of flexible polymers , is the elongational viscosity @xmath29 , which quantifies the resistance to stretching of a fluid element .",
    "if sufficiently important , @xmath29 can be measured @xcite by looking at droplet fission with a rapid camera ( fig . [ droplet ] ) .",
    "the dynamics of the thinning of the filament that connects the droplet to the orifice can be used to obtain the elongational viscosity since the stretching of the filament corresponds to a perfectly elongational flow . performing this experiment",
    ", we find that , for the rigid polymer solution , @xmath29 is so low that the dynamics of the filament is nearly indistinguishable from that of pure water for which @xmath303mpas @xcite .          in fig .",
    "[ expresults ] the percentage drag reduction @xmath31 is plotted as a function of the reynolds number for three different polymer concentrations .",
    "also in our measurement geometry and with our rod - like polymer at low @xmath32 a drag enhancement is observed , which smoothly transforms into a drag reduction at high re .        in this paper",
    "we rationalize and explain the results presented in both fig .",
    "[ virk ] and fig .",
    "[ expresults ] . to this aim",
    "we turn now to a review of the theory of drag reduction .",
    "in the presence of a small concentration of rod - like polymers , the navier - stokes equations for the fluid velocity @xmath33 gain an additional contribution to the stress tensor : @xmath34 the extra stress tensor @xmath35 is due to the interaction between the polymers and the fluid . for rod - like polymers",
    "it takes the form @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the viscosity contributed by the polymer in the limit of zero shear , @xmath38 is a unit vector describing the orientation of the polymer , and @xmath39 is velocity gradient .",
    "the equation of motion for the orientations of the polymers are approximated by the rigid - dumbbell model which reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 is the brownian rotational frequency , proportional to temperature .",
    "the phenomenon of drag reduction in highly turbulent channel flows can be understood on the basis of the balance equations of the mechanical momentum and turbulent energy @xcite . for a channel flow",
    "we choose the coordinates @xmath43 , @xmath2 and @xmath44 as the lengthwise , wall - normal and spanwise directions respectively .",
    "the length and width of the channel are usually taken much larger than the mid - channel height @xmath45 , making the latter a natural re - scaling length for the introduction of dimensionless ( similarity ) variables , also known as  wall units \" @xcite . denoting the pressure gradient",
    "@xmath46 we define the friction reynolds number re@xmath47 , the normalized distance from the wall @xmath48 and the normalized mean velocity @xmath49 ( which is in the @xmath43 direction with a dependence on @xmath2 only ) by @xmath50 the balance equations are derived on the basis of the reynolds decomposition @xmath51 in addition to the mean shear @xmath52 , we need to to introduce the mean turbulent kinetic energy @xmath53 and the reynolds stress @xmath54 .",
    "the momentum balance equation is obtained by averaging eq .",
    "( [ navier ] ) and integrating with respect to @xmath2 , ending up with the exact equation : @xmath55 the physical meaning of this equation is transparent : the momentum generated by the fixed pressure gradient @xmath56 is transported to the wall by the momentum flux ( = reynolds stress ) @xmath57 , and dissipated by the newtonian viscosity @xmath58 .",
    "the mean stress induced by the polymer ( @xmath59 ) is an additional viscous dissipation due to the polymers .    in wall - units",
    "( [ raw_mom ] ) can be written in the form : @xmath60 where @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 .",
    "when @xmath48 not too large , e.g. , in the log - layer , we neglect the second term on the rhs , approximating the rhs as unity .    the balance equation for the turbulent kinetic energy is calculated by taking the dot product of the fluctuation part of eq .",
    "( [ navier ] ) with @xmath64 : @xmath65 also this equation is exact .",
    "we simplify it by noting that the first term on the rhs involves the spatial flux of turbulent energy which is known to be negligible in the log - layer . the second term on the rhs represents the newtonian dissipation which is modelled ( in wall - units ) as @xcite : @xmath66 where @xmath67 and @xmath68 are dimensionless coefficients of the order of unity and @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the physical reasons of this model are follows : when @xmath48 is small , the dissipation of the turbulent energy is dominated by the viscosity ( the firth term ) .",
    "when @xmath48 is large , the an eddy with size @xmath48 and energy @xmath71 loses its energy in the time - scale of @xmath72 , which is the eddy turn - over time scale .",
    "we note that the summation sign in eq.([k_model ] ) is merely a pseudo sum .",
    "it only means that when @xmath48 is small ( large ) , the first ( second ) term is more important .",
    "writing in wall - unit , eq ( [ raw_energy ] ) becomes : @xmath73    finally , we quote the experimental fact that in the log - layer @xmath74 and @xmath75 are proportional to each other : @xmath76 experimentally , it was found that @xmath77 in the newtonian case , and @xmath78 in the mdr .    to estimate of the polymer term on the lhs of eq .",
    "( [ meqn ] ) we first observe that for large re when the rod - like polymers are efficiently aligned by the flow , @xmath79 . therefore from eq .",

    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath86 depends on @xmath75 and @xmath87 : @xmath88 it was argued in @xcite that for large re , @xmath75 grows linearly with @xmath48 and thus the viscosity profile is linear .",

    "we note that when @xmath48 is small , the solution of eqs .",
    "( [ kw ] ) , ( [ mom ] ) and ( [ energy ] ) result in @xmath110 in the viscous sub - layer .",
    "this implies that the flow can not be highly turbulent in the viscous sub - layer .",
