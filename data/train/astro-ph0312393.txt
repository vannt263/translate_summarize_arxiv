    "the existence of very luminous x - ray point sources located within galaxies but not coincident with the galaxy s nucleus has spawned a flurry of investigations into the nature of these objects in recent years .",
    "usually defined as having an x - ray luminosity exceeding @xmath6 ergs s@xmath1 , these ultraluminous x - ray objects ( ulxs ) were originally discovered in the _ einstein _ era ( fabbiano 1989 ) , and studied further with _",
    "rosat _ and _ asca _",
    "( e.g. , colbert & ptak 2002 ; makishima et al .  2000 ;",
    "roberts & warwick 2000 ) .",
    "the excellent spatial resolution of _ chandra _ has led to the discovery of many more ulxs densely packed within star - forming regions of interacting galaxies such as the antennae ( zezas & fabbiano 2002 ) .",
    "while a few ulxs have been identified with supernovae , the majority of ulxs are thought to be accreting objects owing to the fact that their x - ray flux can vary significantly over timescales of months and years .",
    "the x - ray luminosities of ulxs can exceed the eddington luminosity of a 1.4 m@xmath7 neutron star by up to two orders of magnitudes , calling into question the physical nature of these sources .",
    "one possible explanation set forth to explain the origin of ulxs are intermediate mass ( 501000 m@xmath7 ) black holes accreting at or near their eddington limit ( colbert & mushotzky 1999 ) .",
    "such a population of intermediate mass black holes would represent a missing link between stellar - mass black holes like those found in the milky way and supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies .",
    "however , it is uncertain how a black hole in this mass range can form , and arguments both for ( miller & coleman 2002 ; miller et al .",
    "2003 ) and against ( king et al .",
    "2001 ; roberts et al .  2002",
    "; begelman 2002 ) this scenario have been presented previously .",
    "another possible explanation is that ulxs are normal accreting low - mass black holes for which the x - ray emission is beamed toward us ( king et al .",
    "in such a model , king et al .",
    "( 2001 ) proposed that the most likely candidate in a beaming scenario is a phase of thermal time scale mass transfer in binaries with intermediate or high mass donor stars .",
    "the need for an intermediate or high mass donor star naturally explains the tendency for ulxs to be found within galaxies with recent strong star - formation .",

    ". however , a recent compilation of ulx candidates in nearby galaxies by colbert & ptak ( 2002 ) found 34 ulx candidates within a sample of 15 elliptical and s0 galaxies . while colbert & ptak ( 2002 ) caution that some of the ulx candidates might be unrelated foreground / background objects , the extent to which contamination from unrelated sources might affect the ulx rate within early - type galaxies was not determined",
    "indeed , irwin , athey , & bregman ( 2003 ) found that the number of very high x - ray flux sources within a sample of 13 elliptical and s0 galaxies observed with _",
    "chandra _ was exactly that expected from contaminating foreground / background sources .",
    "while there was an overabundance of sources with x - ray luminosities in the @xmath2 ergs s@xmath1 luminosity range , the number of sources with apparent luminosities exceeding @xmath8 ergs s@xmath1 in the 13 galaxies was exactly what was expected from foreground / background objects .",
    "still , only ten very high x - ray flux sources in the sample of 13 galaxies limited the strength of the claim that early - type systems do not generally harbor very luminous ulxs . in this _",
    "we present data from a larger sample of galaxies observed with _",
    "chandra _ to verify that very luminous ulxs ( vulxs ) , defined as sources with 0.310 kev luminosities exceeding @xmath8 ergs s@xmath1 , are absent from elliptical and s0 galaxies .",
    "for our sample we began with all elliptical and s0 galaxies that were available in the _ chandra _ archive as of october 2003 for which the galaxy was observed with the s3 chip of the acis detector .",
    "we have only included galaxies such that a @xmath6 ergs s@xmath1 source would contain at least 36 source counts ( or four times the standard detection limit ) so that incompleteness would not be an issue .",
    "this limited us to galaxies within @xmath9 mpc for a typical _ chandra _ observation .",
    "we excluded the very nearby early - type galaxies ngc  5102 and ngc  5128 for which a visual inspection of the images revealed no high flux sources , and for which the expected number of foreground / background high flux sources was too small to make their addition to the sample worthwhile .",
    "these criteria led to a sample of 30 galaxies .",
    "determining an accurate distance to each galaxy is crucial if we hope to ascertain whether sources more luminous that a certain limit are present in the sample or not .",
    "we have chosen to use the @xmath10-band surface brightness fluctuation distances ( @xmath10-sbf ) of tonry et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , since this study provides the largest homogeneously - analyzed sample of all the distance estimator methods , and includes all 30 galaxies in our sample . for each galaxy , we searched for an independent estimate of the distance , typically from the globular cluster luminosity function method or the @xmath11-band surface brightness fluctuation method , and in general found good agreement .",
    "two exceptions were ngc  1407 and ngc  720 , for which the @xmath10-sbf distances were 60% and 30% larger than other distance estimators , respectively ( perrett et al .  1997 ;",
    "mei et al .",
    "2001 ) . given the large uncertainties to these galaxies , we have excluded them for our sample . for the other galaxies we have assumed the @xmath10-sbf distances , which are consistent with distances derived from other methods at the 15% level .",
    "the 28 galaxies are listed in table  [ tab : sample ] .",
    "the galaxies were processed in a uniform manner following the _ chandra _ data reduction threads .",
    "the data were calibrated with the most recent gain maps at the time of reduction .",
    "pile - up was not an issue even for the brightest sources and no correction has been applied .",
    "sources were detected using the  mexican - hat \" wavelet detection routine wavdetect in ciao in an 0.36.0 kev band image .",
    "count rates were converted into fluxes using a @xmath12 power law model , a value typical for high flux sources in early - type galaxies ( irwin et al .",
    "we also assumed galactic hydrogen column densities from dickey & lockman ( 1990 ) .",
    "we considered fitting the spectrum of each individual ulx in order to derive a flux for each source , but our main goal was to compare the number of detected high flux sources to the number of sources predicted from deep field studies .",
    "since previous deep field studies have assumed a single power law model to convert counts to flux , we have done the same .",
    "all x - ray luminosities are quoted in the 0.310 kev range unless noted otherwise .",
    "depending on the angular size of the galaxy , from five to 16 effective ( half - light ) radii would fit at least partially on the acis - s chip . for each ulx candidate ,",
    "its projected position within the galaxy as a function of effective radii was noted ( e.g. , between 01 effective radii , between 12 effective radii , etc . ) , where the effective radius for each galaxy has been collected from the literature .",
    "this was done in order to create a combined radial profile for the ulx candidates to determine their spatial distribution . in a future paper",
    ", we will catalog the positions , count rates , spectral parameters , and other relevant information of the ulx candidates presented here .",
    "to determine the number of unrelated foreground / background x - ray sources expected in the field of view of each observation , the log @xmath13 vs.  log @xmath14 relation derived by hasinger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) was employed .",
    "we considered using one of the _ chandra _ deep field studies ( i.e. , giacconi et al .",
    "2001 ) , but the number of very high flux sources found within a typical _ chandra _ field of view is so small that the slope of the log @xmath13 vs.  log @xmath14 relation at the high flux end is poorly constrained , and would lead to poorly constrained values for the expected number of high flux sources .",
    "conversely , the _ rosat _ hri - derived log @xmath13 vs.  log @xmath14 relation of hasinger et al .",
    "( 1998 ) was determined from both a deep observation of the lockman hole and many shorter pointed observations of isolated , non - extended x - ray sources in order to sufficiently populate the high flux end of the log @xmath13 vs.  log @xmath14 relation .",

    "1998 ) is ( upon integrating the differential form ) :",
    "@xmath15    where @xmath16 ) is the number of sources with fluxes exceeding @xmath14 per square degree , and @xmath14 is the 0.52.0 kev flux of the source in units of @xmath17 ergs s@xmath1 @xmath18 . for each of the 28",
    "_ chandra _ fields , we calculated the number of expected background / foreground sources with 0.52.0 kev fluxes corresponding to 0.310 kev luminosities of @xmath19 ergs s@xmath1 and @xmath20 ergs s@xmath1 ( if the sources are assumed to be at the distance of the target galaxy ) . in total , 33.1 and 33.5",
    "sources were expected in the 28 _ chandra _ fields that would be mistaken as @xmath19 ergs s@xmath1 and @xmath20 ergs s@xmath1 sources , respectively .",
    "the number of such sources actually detected was @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively , where the errors given are @xmath23 poisson uncertainties .",
    "so while there is a significant excess in the number of @xmath19 ergs s@xmath1 sources over what was expected , the number of @xmath20 ergs s@xmath1 sources detected is precisely what is predicted from deep field studies .",
    "in addition to comparing the number of foreground / background sources expected to the number of ulx candidates in the galaxies , the distribution of the sources can provide an independent estimate of the amount of contamination from foreground / background objects .",
    "we created one combined radial distribution profile of all the sources in the sample , as discussed above . in order to improve the statistics ,",
    "the 16 original radial bins were grouped into five larger bins : 01 , 12 , 23 , 37 , and 716 effective radii .",
    "the number of ulx candidates in each bin was divided by the area of the bin in units of the effective area .",
    "this was done so that a random distribution of sources would yield a flat radial profile , while a distribution that followed the optical light of the galaxy would be significantly peaked toward the center .",
    "the combined radial profile is shown in figure  [ fig : radial ] .",
    "we have plotted the distributions for the @xmath19 ergs s@xmath1 and @xmath20 ergs s@xmath1 sources separately . at large radii ,",
    "the profiles of both luminosity classes are flat , indicative of a distribution that is randomly distributed . within two effective radii",
    ", there is a clear peak in the profile of the @xmath19 ergs s@xmath1 sources . of the 19 sources found within one effective radius ,",
    "only 1.6 are expected to be foreground / background contaminants , indicating that most of the sources belong to the galaxies in the sample .",
    "such a strong peak is not seen in the radial profile of the @xmath20 ergs s@xmath1 sources . while there is a slight overabundance of @xmath20 ergs s@xmath1 sources within one effective radius ( four were detected while 1.7 were expected )",
    ", this overabundance is only significant at the 90% confidence level .",
    "furthermore , of the four @xmath20 ergs s@xmath1 sources within one effective radius , three have luminosities below @xmath24 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "thus , even if these three sources do belong to the galaxies they are only minimally above the @xmath25 ergs s@xmath1 threshold , and would fall below this threshold if their host galaxies were only 8% closer than was assumed . finally , for two of the three sources , fitting their spectra ( rather than assuming a @xmath12 spectral model ) yielded luminosities less than @xmath26 ergs s@xmath1 for these two sources .",
    "3.10truein      colbert & ptak ( 2002 ) analyzed 15 early - type and 39 late - type galaxies observed with the _ rosat _ hri and found a total of 87 ulx candidates .",
    "there is some overlap between the early - type galaxies in their sample and ours , and in general they surveyed out to approximately the same radial distance as we have .",
    "colbert & ptak ( 2002 ) scaled the galaxies by @xmath27 rather than the effective radius ( @xmath27 is typically 35 times larger than the effective radius ) , and included in their catalog all sources with 210 kev luminosities greater than @xmath6 ergs s@xmath1 within twice the @xmath27 contour ( or approximately 610 effective radii ) .",
    "since not all of the observations were complete down to @xmath6 ergs s@xmath1 , it is not possible to compare the expected number of foreground / background sources to the number of ulx candidates found , but it is possible to look at the spatial distribution of the ulx candidates .",
    "colbert & ptak ( 2002 ) assumed a power law of @xmath28 rather than the @xmath29 model used in our work .",
    "after accounting for the difference in spectral model choice and energy band , it was found that the lower luminosity limit of their catalog was @xmath4 ( 0.310 kev ) @xmath30 ergs s@xmath1 ( they are all what we would call vulxs ) . based on the results of ",
    "[ subsec : expected ] and   [ subsec : spatial ] , we would therefore expect the distribution of their sources to be consistent with a random distribution .    from table  1 of colbert & ptak ( 2002 ) ,",
    "we determined how many vulx candidates were within radial bins of 00.5 @xmath27 , 0.51.0 @xmath27 , 1.01.5 @xmath27 , and 1.52.0 @xmath27 .",
    "we included any high x - ray flux qsos that were excluded by colbert & ptak ( 2002 ) , and excluded a vulx candidate in ngc  4374 ( ixo 50 ) for which _ chandra _ images showed it to be a clump of hot gas rather than a point source .",
    "we also excluded from the sample any galaxy for which twice @xmath27 exceeded @xmath31 since the outer radial bins would not fit within the _ rosat _ hri field of view .",
    "3.10truein    for a random distribution , we would expect the number of sources detected within each radial bin to scale simply with the ratio of the areas of the four bins . for 00.5 @xmath27 , 0.51.0 @xmath27 , 1.01.5 @xmath27 , and 1.52.0 @xmath27 bins ,",
    "this would be a 1:3:5:7 ratio .",
    "the number of vulx candidates found in these four bins were 2 , 5 , 11 , and 16 , respectively . within the poisson uncertainties ,",
    "the distribution of the vulx candidates are completely consistent with being random ( and therefore unrelated to the galaxies ) .",
    "interestingly , a similar exercise with late - type galaxies in the colbert & ptak ( 2002 ) catalog yields a completely different result ; within the four radial bins there were 22 , 17 , 7 , and 6 vulx candidates , respectively .",
    "the sources are heavily concentrated toward the centers of the galaxies , indicating that nearly all of the sources within @xmath27 are bona fide vulxs .",
    "this is not surprising given the well - known connection between recent star formation and the presence of vulxs .",
    "the results for both the early - type and spiral galaxy samples are illustrated in figure  [ fig : colbert ] , where the vulx distributions for the two samples have both been normalized to 1.0 in the fourth spatial bin for easier comparison .",
    "angelini , loewenstein , & mushotzky ( 2001 ) found that two sources with @xmath32 ergs s@xmath1 were coincident with globular cluster candidates , which would conflict with the idea that sources this luminous avoid early - type systems .",
    "we located these two sources in the _ chandra _ data of ngc  1399 .",
    "the spectrum of one of the sources was very soft ( @xmath33 ) , and with this spectral model we determined its x - ray luminosity to be @xmath34 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "thus , if ngc  1399 is only 8% closer ( within the uncertainties of the tonry et al .",
    "2001 distance estimate ) , the luminosity of this source would drop below @xmath8 ergs s@xmath1 .",
    "the other source has a considerably higher luminosity ( @xmath35 ergs s@xmath1 ) and can not be explained by assuming a slightly smaller distance .",
    "it is possible that the optical counterpart is really a background agn that has been miss - identified as a globular cluster .",
    "we have analyzed the same _ hst _ data that angelini et al .",
    "( 2001 ) used to obtain a globular cluster list for this galaxy , and have verified that the object has a globular cluster - like @xmath36 color and apparent magnitude .",
    "however , at the distance of ngc  1399 , a globular cluster would be at best marginally - resolved by _ hst _ , so only a high resolution spectrum of the optical counterpart will unambiguously determine if it is a globular cluster or an agn . at any rate ,",
    "given the large number of globular clusters that ngc  1399 contains , as well as the large number of globular clusters in our sample as a whole , we can at least conclude that @xmath5 ergs s@xmath1 sources are extremely rare in globular clusters , and in early - type systems in general .",
    "there does not appear to be a standard definition for a ulx in the literature .",
    "various studies have defined ulxs differently , using different luminosity thresholds and different energy bands . here , we propose that a ulx be defined as having a 0.310 kev luminosity that exceeds @xmath8 ergs s@xmath1 ( what we have been calling vulxs in this paper ) .",
    "using @xmath8 ergs s@xmath1 as a break between ulxs and normal x - ray binaries has two advantages .",
    "first , we note that x - ray sources that have luminosities of @xmath2 ergs s@xmath1 can be adequately explained by accretion onto a 1020 m@xmath7 black hole ( for which observational evidence already exists for blacks holes of this mass in our own galaxy , e.g , cygnus x-1 ) , thus eliminating the need for a more exotic explanation such as beaming or the existence of intermediate mass black holes .",
    "second , @xmath37 ergs s@xmath1 sources are apparently lacking ( or at least very rare ) in old stellar populations , suggesting that an additional class of object is present in late - type galaxies that is absent in early - type galaxies .",
