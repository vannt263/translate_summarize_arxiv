    "random sequential adsorption ( rsa ) is an irreversible process in which particles are adsorbed sequentially and without overlaps and deposited particles can not diffuse or desorb from the substrate .",
    "the rsa model has been initially applied to reactions along polymer chains@xcite .",
    "more recently , rsa processes have found a variety of other applications from adhesion of colloidal particles and proteins onto substrates@xcite to chemisorption@xcite and epitaxial growth@xcite ; for reviews see@xcite .    in this paper , we study a simple generalization of rsa that creates a rich dynamic behavior and results in complex spatial patterns .",
    "namely , we consider polydisperse random sequential adsorption ( prsa ) processes .",
    "adsorption of mixtures has been addressed in a very few studies@xcite .",
    "if a mixture contains a small number of different sizes , geometric and kinetic characteristics are primarily determined by the smallest size . in many applications , however , the size distribution is continuous and spreads over several decades@xcite .",
    "therefore , before the smallest size will finally win , an interesting intermediate asymptotics arises . to address this intermediate regime",
    ", we consider prsa with the power - law distribution in the small size limit , @xmath0 .",
    "we show@xcite that this prsa gives rise to fractal patterns of dimension @xmath4 depending on the exponent @xmath1 .",
    "additionally , we measure the degree of order of the patterns formed by prsa , and identify the local structure of the patterns arising in the limit @xmath5 with apollonian packing@xcite . the significance of apollonian packing in surface deposition problems was also recognized in ref.@xcite .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce prsa and present numerical results . in sec .",
    "iii , we develop scaling , exact , and mean - field approaches to prsa .",
    "exact results are available for the one - dimensional ( 1d ) prsa , and they are used to check mean - field and scaling approaches . a relation between kinetics and geometry of arising patterns is also discussed . in sec .",
    "iv , we introduce a quantitative criterion of regularity of the pattern formation process and analyze the ordering in prsa processes . the last sec .",
    "v contains a summary .",
    "in applying rsa to real processes , one should take into account that adsorbed particles are typically polydisperse .",
    "the relevant example is adsorption of colloidal particles , that have a broad radii distribution .",
    "it is usually described by the schulz distribution@xcite , which has a power - law dependence on the radius @xmath6 for small @xmath6 and an exponential tail for large @xmath6 : @xmath7^{\\alpha }   \\frac { { } r^{\\alpha-1}}{\\gamma(\\alpha ) } \\exp \\left[-\\frac{\\alpha}{\\langle r\\rangle}r\\right ] .",
    "\\label{disshulz}\\ ] ] here @xmath8 is the average radius and @xmath9 the gamma function .",
    "note that the exponent @xmath1 should be positive to obey the normalization requirement , @xmath10 .",
    "only the small - size behavior of @xmath11 affects the most interesting long time characteristics since in this regime only small particles can be adsorbed .",
    "thus instead of ( [ disshulz ] ) we shall use a power - law size distribution with an upper cutoff ( taken as the unit of length ) : @xmath12    the patterns formed by prsa are drastically different from traditional rsa patterns , since the coverage is complete for prsa .",
    "the pore space of the patterns is a nontrivial fractal set .",
    "this is physically evident , and in one dimension it proves possible to determine the fractal dimension @xmath13 analytically . in higher dimensions , we have to resort to numerical treatment .",
    "monte carlo simulations of the prsa model have been performed by implementing the following algorithm .",
    "a center of the new disc is chosen at random with a uniform probability density .",
    "the radius of the disc is generated according to the size - distribution of eq .",
    "( [ distrib ] ) . if this disc does not overlap any other discs already in placed , it is deposited .",
    "otherwise , the attempt is discarded .",
    "the maximal coverage studied in simulations was @xmath14 and about @xmath15 runs were performed for each @xmath1 .",
    "some of the generated patterns are shown in fig .  1 .",
    "clearly , the character of patterns changes when the exponent @xmath1 increases from @xmath16 to @xmath17 .",
    "for the small @xmath1 , the patterns look like a random set of little discs distributed uniformly over the plane , with larger discs randomly scattered in the `` sea '' of smaller ones . for large @xmath1",
    ", one recognizes a structure initially formed by large discs and then reproduced by smaller discs in the holes between the large ones .",
    "these properties of patterns follow from the small size behavior of radii distribution function @xmath11 . indeed when @xmath18 the smallest particles primarily participate in the adsorption , and hence apparently random patterns emerge . when @xmath19 , the particles of the largest size are deposited until the system reaches the jamming limit of monodisperse rsa .",
    "then the next particle to arrive will be the one that fits the biggest hole .",
    "this continues , so in this second stage the process is deterministic and apparently ordered patterns emerge .    on",
    "the length scales much smaller than the upper cutoff , patterns are self - similar ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "this suggests the fractal nature of the arising patterns .",
    "we have measured the fractal dimension @xmath4 of the pore - space of the patterns using the standard approach ( see e.g. @xcite ) based on the analysis of the radii distribution function for the adsorbed particles .",
    "namely , denote by @xmath20 the number density of adsorbed discs with radii from the interval @xmath21 .",
    "let @xmath22 is an arbitrary lower cutoff radius .",
    "then @xmath23 gives the number density of discs with radii greater than @xmath22 .",
    "the power law behavior of @xmath24 at the @xmath25 limit , @xmath26 is a signature that the pore space is a set of fractal dimension @xmath4 .",
    "numerically , we indeed observed this power law behavior .",
    "we also found that @xmath4 monotonously decreases when @xmath1 increases ( see fig .",
    "in the present section we employ scaling , mean - field and exact approaches to the process of pattern formation in prsa .",
    "the first approach is based on the scaling hypothesis and gives relations between structural and kinetic characteristics of the system .",
    "let @xmath27 is the fraction of uncovered area and @xmath28 the probability that a disc of radius @xmath6 can be placed onto a substrate@xcite .",
    "clearly ,    @xmath29    @xmath27 evolves according to the _ exact _ rate equation    @xmath30    where @xmath31 denotes the volume of the @xmath32-dimensional unit sphere , @xmath33 . assuming a scaling behavior of @xmath28 , we write    @xmath34    here @xmath35 is a typical gap between neighboring adsorbed particles and @xmath36 is a scaling function .",
    "the scaling description applies when @xmath37 and @xmath38 with @xmath39 finite .",
    "the existence of scaling is an assumption , which is supported by numerical evidence in 2d and by analytical results in 1d@xcite .",
    "( [ psiphi ] ) and ( [ psi2 ] ) imply @xmath40 with @xmath41 .",
    "substituting then ( [ psi2 ] ) into ( [ phi1 ] ) gives @xmath42    scaling suggests that self - similar fractal structures should arise .",
    "indeed , computing the number density of the absorbed particles we get @xmath43 hence , the power - law dependence of eq .",
    "( [ frdim ] ) is recovered when we identify the fractal dimension with @xmath44 eq .  ( [ df ] ) provides a relation between the fractal dimension of the arising patterns and the kinetic exponent @xmath45 .",
    "similar qualitative behaviors were observed in other pattern formation models@xcite .",
    "we should stress that scaling provides just a framework ; for instance , it gives scaling relations among the exponents but it does not allow to compute the exponents .",
    "so one should use other approaches to get a complete exact or approximate description of prsa . in one dimension ,",
    "an exact description is indeed possible . in higher dimensions , even in the extreme case of @xmath46 the fractal dimension of",
