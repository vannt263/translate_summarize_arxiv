    "the relativistic brueckner - hartree - fock model @xcite is very succesful in describing equilibrium properties of nuclear matter .",
    "where the conventional brueckner - hartree - fock model is not able to reproduce the empirical saturation point without the introduction of explicit three - body forces , the relativistic extension finds a saturation point very close to the experimental value .",
    "going beyond the relativistic brueckner scheme and including hole - hole propagation to all orders , one finds only a small shift in the saturation point towards the empirical one @xcite . including hole - hole propagation is essential for obtaining a ` conserving ' model , i.e. a model that preserves conservation laws and is thermodynamically consistent @xcite . in this extended relativistic brueckner model",
    "other observables also compare favourably with experiment : we found a compressibility in the range 250 - 300 mev , a depletion of the fermi - sea of @xmath0 and a quasi - particle strength at the fermi - surface in the order of @xmath1 .",
    "the essential ingredient in the rbhf model is the decomposition of the self - energy in a scalar and vector part . while the mean - field , in essence the sum of both parts , is in the order of @xmath2 mev , the components are a few hundred mev .",
    "this leads to a small effective mass , which again results in a squeezing of the scalar ( attractive ) part of the interaction .",
    "this additional density dependent , purely relativistic , repulsive effect is responsible for the shift in the saturation point as compared to the non - relativistic brueckner model .",
    "the use of relativistic kinematics has only a minor impact .",
    "one problem intimately related to relativity that has still to be addressed is the effect of negative energy states .",
    "these are affected by the medium as well , and the question to what extent this changes the results is largely unexplored territory . if one takes the effective lagrangian approach on which the rbhf model is based seriously , one should attempt to develop some kind of renormalization scheme and chart the effects of the medium on this .",
    "this has been done in the relatively simple framework of the walecka model in the loop expansion and was only successful in the sense that counterterms etc . can be calculated and used on a mean - field level in hartree and hartree - fock approaches on a purely phenomenological level @xcite . however",
    ", this loop expansion shows no signs of converging : the coupling constants change with every additonal order included @xcite . in a way this failure",
    "can be expected because the energy scales involved in any renormalization scheme will be in the order of a few gev . on this scale one",
    "starts to be sensitive to the substructure of the nucleon and therefore to the way how one suppresses this by e.g. a formfactor .",
    "consequently , one should not try to renormalize models that are based on point - like nucleons .    in this work",
    "we take a less fundamental approach and avoid the renormalization problem by using an effective theory in the vacuum .",
    "we employ a model that includes propagation of negative energy states in a well - defined manner .",
    "this is implemented by using the so - called spectator equation @xcite . in this particular three - dimensional reduction of the full bethe - salpeter equation , negative - energy propagation",
    "is explicitly included . in ref .",
    "@xcite an interaction is presented that fits the nucleon - nucleon data well using this equation . by fitting the data in vacuum one",
    "renormalizes the theory effectively. this of course means that one loses the dynamics of the renormalization scheme in the medium . however , one still has the dynamics of the propagation of the intermediate negative energy state and it is interesting to investigate to what extent this affects the conclusions of the standard rbhf model .",
    "we want to stress though that before one can generalize these conclusions more work needs to be done .",
    "the three - dimensional reduction scheme we use in this work is not unique , and therefore any effect will be , at first , specific only to this particular reduction scheme . to arrive at more general statements one needs to investigate the effects of negative - energy propagation in other reduction schemes .",
    "however , before one can do this one needs models that fit nucleon - nucleon data including negative energy propagation .",
    "we are aware of only two efforts in this direction .",
    "one is the work of the utrecht group @xcite , the other the approach of gross _",
    "@xcite which we use .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first review in section [ theory ] the theoretical basis of our model . in section [ results ] we will present results for various observables , before we present some concluding remarks in the final section .",
    "to avoid the complexity of solving the full four - dimensional bethe - salpeter equation one usually resorts to a three - dimensional reduction scheme . by approximating the propagator with a form that fixes the energy variable while preserving the elastic cut ,",
    "the four - dimensional integration is reduced to a three - dimensional one over the spatial momenta .",
    "even with the requirement that one retains covariance , there is no unique way to perform this reduction . over the years",
    "several specific schemes have been widely used , most notably the blankenbecler - sugar ( bbs ) @xcite and thompson @xcite reductions . in both these equations",
    "the intermediate nucleons are symmetrically off - shell and no energy is transferred via the interaction , i.e. , no mesonretardation is present .",
    "another point worth noting is that these equations , by construction , only propagate positive - energy intermediate states .",
    "therefore , the main difference between these equations and the non - relativistic scattering equation is the presence of relativistic kinematics , so - called minimal relativity. rbhf calculations based on both equations have been performed by many groups , we mention the pioneering work of anastasio _ et al . _ and the calculations by machleidt @xcite , horowitz and serot @xcite and the groningen group @xcite .    a reduction scheme that in some respects goes beyond this is the gross - reduction , leading to the spectator equation @xcite .",
    "in this approach one particle is put on - shell , while in the propagation of the off - shell particle both the positive- and negative - energy contributions are retained . also some mesonretardation is present .    with regard to three - dimensional reductions one should keep in mind that it is not _ a priori _ clear that the bethe - salpeter equation using only the one - boson - exchange ( obe ) interaction as an approximation of the full irreducible kernel is superior to a well chosen three - dimensional reduction in describing the full scattering process . for scalar theories",
    "it is proven that the spectator equation effectively includes the cancellation between direct and crossed box diagrams .",
    "the spectator equation then gives a better approximation to the full sum of ladder and crossed - ladder diagrams than the iterated obe diagrams of the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .    in the spectator approach the 2-body propagator in the c.m .",
    "frame reads @xmath3 the indices 1,2 identify the particle , in this propagator particle 1 is on - shell . also , @xmath4 is the c.m .",
    "3-momentum , @xmath5 the total invariant mass and @xmath6 are the usual projection operators on positive / negative energy states .",
    "it is easily verified that this propagator is covariant .",
    "this also holds separately for both the positive and negative energy part .",
    "note that we can obtain the thompson equation by ignoring the negative energy part of the propagator and the meson retardation .    in ref .",
    "@xcite an obe model based on the spectator - equation is presented . using only four mesons ( @xmath7 and @xmath8 )",
    "a fit comparable in quality to the bonn potential @xcite was obtained .",
    "several potentials are given , differing in a ) taking the pion - nucleon interaction as purely pseudo - vector or with an admixture of pseudo - scalar and in b ) the treatment of spurious poles in the meson propagators due to particular form of meson - retardation in the spectator equation .",
    "the difference between a rather simple and a more elaborate scheme for the treatment of the meson poles were shown to be relatively small . since our calculations are numerically already very involved we opt for the simple scheme and take the ia model of ref .",
    "@xcite for our calculations in the nuclear medium .",
    "in isotropic symmetric nuclear matter the self - energy of the nucleon has in the spinor representation several components @xmath9 this decomposition of the dirac structure allows us formally to define effective ( in principle momentum and energy dependent ) quantities @xmath10.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] previous calculations have shown that the momentum dependence of the self - energy components is relatively weak .",
    "we follow the standard procedure to neglect the momentum dependence of the self - energies in the intermediate propagators by using the values at @xmath11 .",
    "furthermore , from a technical viewpoint it is advantageous to ` divide out ' the @xmath12 component .",
    "one then obtains a renormalized effective mass : @xmath13 and corresponding expressions are obtained for momentum and vector self - energies .",
    "this effective mass will be used in the practical calculation , where confusion might arise we will refer to this particular definition as the self - consistent effective mass . with this definition",
    "we find an effective positive - energy spinor : @xmath14 here @xmath15 is the on - shell energy of the spinor . as we will see later the value of @xmath12 is still small , but not negligible as in earlier calculations and we have to incorporate it in the calculation .",
    "one thus finds for the dressed one - body propagator @xcite ( note that in this expression @xmath16 is also renormalized by @xmath17 ) @xmath18 . \\label{prop1_med}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 is the projector on effective positive - energy states : @xmath20 , with the effective spinors of eq .",

    "both momenta in the particle - particle part of the propagator are required to have momenta above @xmath27 , in the particle - antiparticle part only the momentum of the ( positive energy ) particle is pauli blocked .",
    "any incoming , outgoing or intermediate state can either be particle - particle ( denoted by + ) or particle - antiparticle ( denoted by - ) character . splitting the two - body propagator in two contributions using this nomenclature we find a set of coupled equations for the various components of the t - matrix : @xmath28 the terminology _ dir / exch _ arises from which particle is on - shell ( see also ref .",

    "is always on - shell . which particle is on - shell in the intermediate state is indicated by the index in the two - body propagator .",
    "the expressions for @xmath31 have a similar structure . in ref .",
    "@xcite it is shown that the resulting scattering amplitude is properly anti - symmetrized . by using the form of the positive / negative energy projection operators ( @xmath32 ) the above set of equations can be expressed in momentum spin - space . in the c.m .",

    "the t - matrix is calculated in this representation .",
    "we like to stress again that @xmath35 is sandwiched between _ effective _ spinors . due to the low effective nucleon mass this leads to a supression of the attractive scalar part and an enhancement of the repulsive vector part of the interaction .",
    "this addional effective ( density dependent ) repulsion is a consequence of the relativistic treatment and not present in non - relativistic brueckner models , it is the reason for the empirical succes of the relativistic brueckner models .    due to the kinematics introduced by the specific form of the spectator equation ,",

    "however , one should be careful with comparing compressibilities calculated for different saturation points .",
    "the figure does seem to indicate that for higher densities the equation of state of the spectator equation is stiffer .",

    "this is an additional repulsive effect of the low effective nucleon mass , on top of the conventional relativistic effect of squeezing the attractive scalar part of the interaction .",
    "we want to stress that this additional repulsion is a direct consequence of the particular three - dimensional reduction we use . as pointed out in ref .",

    "@xcite leads to differences which , up to order @xmath96 , only depend on one parameter .",
