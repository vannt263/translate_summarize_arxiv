    "<S> we demonstrate experimentally and support by a theoretical analysis an effect of asymmetric spectrum broadening , which results from doping of silver nanoparticles into a heavy - glass matrix , 90(0.5wo@xmath0 - 0.3sbpo@xmath1 - 0.2pbo)-10agcl . </S>",
    "<S> the strong dispersion of the effective nonlinear coefficient of the composite significantly influences the spectral broadening via the self - phase modulation , and leads to a blue upshift of the spectrum . </S>",
    "<S> further extension of the spectrum towards shorter wavelengths is suppressed by a growing loss caused by the plasmon resonance in the silver particles . </S>",
    "<S> the red - edge spectral broadening is dominated by the stimulated raman scattering .    </S>",
    "<S> dielectric composites containing metal nanoparticles ( mnps ) have been intensively studied for the last two decades ( see , e.g. , refs . </S>",
    "<S> panorama , schmid , denisyuk ) , as they play a central role in the rapidly growing fields of nano - optics and plasmonics . </S>",
    "<S> the interaction between light and mnps is dominated by charge - density oscillations on the closed surface of the particles , alias localized plasmon resonances , and leads to a strong field enhancement in the mnp s near field . to mention just a few applications of such systems , </S>",
    "<S> localized plasmons allow greatly increased signal strengths in the raman spectroscopy and surface spectroscopy , enabling the detection of single molecules @xcite , significant enhancement of the emission rate of fluorescent molecules and quantum dots @xcite , and the direct generation of high harmonics by nj pulses produced by a laser oscillator , without the use of amplifiers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the property of mnps which is most important for applications to nonlinear optics is their large intrinsic nonlinearity coefficient . </S>",
    "<S> far from the plasmon resonance , the third - order susceptibility of silver mnps in the nanoparticle composite is about seven orders of magnitude higher than in the host material @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> since the local electric field in mnps is enhanced at the plasmonic resonance , the nonlinear response of the metal can be additionally significantly amplified as the wavelength shifts towards the resonance .    </S>",
    "<S> the generation of coherent white light ( or supercontinuum generation ) in microstructured fibers by fs and ps pulses has attracted a great deal of attention and found many applications ( see review @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> recently , much effort has been devoted to decrease the power or energy threshold necessary to generate octave - spanning spectra by reducing the relevant diameters to the submicron scale @xcite or using nanowires made of materials with high nonlinearities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the power threshold is particularly important for the realization of cost - effective and compact sc sources . </S>",
    "<S> an alternative approach to lowering the threshold condition for nonlinear processes is the utilization of composites containing mnps . </S>",
    "<S> previously , white - light generation in nanometer - scale antennas related to photoluminescence @xcite , and in colloidal mnp  systems synthesized by means of ablation @xcite were reported . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , a relatively small spectral broadening in aqueous colloids with very low filling factor was observed @xcite . in recent works , </S>",
    "<S> a mechanism of the wavelength - dependent nonlinearity in aqueous colloids wang , driben3 , and in silica glasses volume - doped by silver mnps , was studied , and it was predicted that it can lead to the generation of supercontinuum @xcite and solitons @xcite . in the present letter </S>",
    "<S> we produce an experimental evidence of _ asymmetric _ spectral broadening due to the presence of nanoparticles in composites based on wo@xmath0 host glass , and support these observations by extended numerical calculations .    </S>",

    "<S> after homogenization , the melt was cooled to 950@xmath2c , left at that temperature for 5 minutes , and then cast into a brass mold , pre - heated to 400@xmath2c . </S>",
    "<S> glass pieces were left for annealing at that temperature during four hours to reduce thermal stresses , and then the furnace was turned off and cooled to the room temperature under its natural cooling rate . </S>",
    "<S> silver mnps were implanted by heat treatment of the glass sample under normal pressure for two hours at 450@xmath2c .    </S>",
    "<S> the size distribution and shape of silver mnps have been determined by means of the transmission electron microscopy ( tem ) . </S>",

    "<S> the absorption spectrum of the annealed sample in fig.1 ( b ) demonstrates a new absorption shoulder at @xmath3 nm , in comparison to the  as prepared \" glass composition , which is attributed to the surface plasmon resonance of silver . </S>",
    "<S> the strong red - shift of the resonance in this case is accounted for by the high linear refractive index of glass matrix , @xmath4 .            </S>",
    "<S> a ti : sapphire - based laser system , generating 30-fs pulses centered at 800 nm with up to 3 mj energy , was used in the experiment . </S>",

    "<S> the diameter of the laser beam was reduced with a use of a 1:3 telescope to 5 mm at the @xmath7 level . </S>",
    "<S> the beam s power was attenuated by a factor of @xmath8 with the help of a rotating optical chopper , to avoid thermal effects in the samples . </S>",
    "<S> the 2 mm thick wo@xmath0 glass samples , both doped with the silver mnps and pure ones , were placed between a pair of mirrors , introducing dispersion of @xmath9 fs@xmath10 per bounce , to compensate the material dispersion of the glass matrix and prevent the distortion of the pulse in the temporal domain . </S>",
    "<S> the mirror - pair was also used to arrange additional passes of the pulses through the samples , by adjusting the relative position of the mirrors . </S>",
    "<S> it was not reasonable to perform more that four passes through the silver - doped sample because of a relative low single - pass transmissivity of @xmath11 , which is mostly determined by high losses due to the reflection from uncoated glass surfaces , with the respective refractive index @xmath12 , and by imperfections of the surfaces . </S>",
    "<S> the spectrum of the transmitted beam was measured using an intensity - calibrated spectrometer ( avaspec-2048 190 - 1100 nm ) , after attenuating the fresnel reflection from the fused silica edge .    </S>",
    "<S> if both the average distance between the mnps and their size are much smaller than the wavelength of light , the effective - medium description , based on the maxwell - garnett model , can be applied to spherical particles with uncorrelated positions , up to relatively large values of the filling factor , @xmath13 . in this model </S>",
