    "the last several years have seen another burst of discovery of milky way ( mw ) satellites from atlas @xcite , the panoramic survey telescope & rapid response system ( pan - starrs ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , the dark energy survey ( des ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the dark energy camera more generally @xcite .",
    "the most distant of the new satellites is eridanus  ii ( eri  ii ) , at @xmath8@xmath0350  kpc and @xmath10@xmath0@xmath11  mag , which was discovered simultaneously by two groups @xcite . the distance to eri  ii roughly corresponds to the virial radius of the mw ( @xmath0300 kpc ; e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) : this places eri  ii near the transition radius between those dwarf spheroidals ( with @xmath12300  kpc ) , which appear to have lost their primordial gas , and more distant dwarfs which generally retain hi gas reservoirs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the properties of eri  ii suggest that it may be similar to leo  t , another recently discovered dwarf just beyond the virial radius of the mw ( @xmath8@xmath13410  kpc , @xmath14@xmath15 ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which displays a significant hi gas reservoir @xcite and has undergone multiple epochs of star formation @xcite .",
    "additionally , @xcite tentatively suggested that eri  ii may have a globular cluster , which would make it the smallest known galaxy with its own star cluster .",
    "motivated by the hints that set eri  ii apart from the bulk of the new mw satellites , we obtained deep photometric and hi observations to further study its physical properties . in section  [ sec : reduction ] , we describe the optical magellan / megacam observations , as well as our stellar photometry . in section  [ sec : analysis ] we present the color - magnitude diagram ( cmd ) of eri  ii and its stellar populations , we derive updated values for its distance , structural parameters , luminosity and hi gas content , and we describe the properties of its stellar cluster .",
    "we discuss and conclude in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "eri  ii was observed on 2015 october 12 ( ut ) with the megacam imager @xcite on the magellan clay telescope .",
    "megacam has a @xmath0@xmath16 field - of - view and a binned pixel scale of 016 .",
    "the seeing was @xmath009 and @xmath006 for the @xmath17- and @xmath18-band , respectively .",
    "we took 14 300  sec exposures in @xmath17-band and 6 300  sec exposures in @xmath18-band , which were dithered to fill in the gaps between the ccds .",
    "the data were reduced using the megacam pipeline at the smithsonian astrophysical observatory telescope data center .",
    "we perform point spread function fitting photometry on each of the stacked final images , using the suite of programs daophot and allframe @xcite , and following the procedure described in @xcite . to calibrate our data",
    ", we used the aavso photometric all - sky survey ( apass ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath17- and @xmath18-band photometry and cross - matched it with short ( 60  sec ) eri  ii exposures , propagating the derived zeropoints and color terms to the longer science exposures .",
    "the calibrated catalogues were corrected for galactic extinction @xcite star by star ( the average extinction across the image is @xmath19  mag ) , and we present dereddened @xmath20 and @xmath21 magnitudes throughout this work .",
    "we performed a series of artificial star tests to determine our photometric errors and completeness as a function of magnitude and color . over many experiments",
    ", we injected @xmath010 times the number of artificial stars into our data as were detected in the unaltered images .",
    "the artificial stars were homogeneously distributed across the field - of - view , with a color - magnitude distribution similar to that of the observed sources , but extending @xmath02 magnitudes fainter .",
    "the photometry of the images with artificial star injections was derived exactly in the same way as for the real data .",

    ", width=226 ]                  eri  ii is not simply a single old and metal poor stellar population , in contrast to many of the new , faint satellites of the mw @xcite .",
    "the color and slope of the rgb and the blue extent of the extended horizontal branch ( hb ; fig .  [ cmd_glob ] ) are characteristic of old , metal - poor ( @xmath24  gyr , [ fe / h]@xmath25 ) populations such as those in globular clusters or ultra - faint dwarfs .",
    "the hb is not purely blue , but has a red hb ( rhb ) portion as well : while this can be a feature of old and metal - rich populations , the rgb slope of eri  ii seems to exclude the presence of significantly enriched stars .",
    "alternatively , the rhb could arise from a metal - poor population marginally younger ( @xmath26  gyr ) than the oldest one , or as a second parameter effect @xcite .",
    "the objects between the bhb and the rhb at a range of magnitudes are candidate rr  lyrae stars .",
    "we consider the hess diagram for the field - subtracted cmd ( fig .",
    "[ cmd_glob ] ) : an excess of sources is present above the subgiant branch portion of the old isochrone , around @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "this feature is well fit by a @xmath0@xmath1  gyr and [ fe / h]@xmath29 isochrone ( panel d of fig .",
    "[ cmd_glob ] ) , or alternatively by a @xmath0@xmath30  gyr population as metal - poor as the old rgb .",
    "a significantly younger and more metal - rich population can be ruled out , since it would produce a rgb redder than observed ; similarly , for older ages the turnoff would be too faint to match the observed one .",
    "we can not exclude the possibility that these are , at least in part , blue straggler ( bs ) stars arising from binary systems , which can mimic intermediate - age populations ( for a discussion about the  blue plume  in faint mw satellites see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the ratio of the number of candidate bs stars to the number of blue hb ( bhb ) stars ( computed following @xcite ) is @xmath0@xmath31 , consistent with empirical values derived for dwarf galaxies with luminosities similar to eri  ii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "this supports the bs interpretation for these stars .",
    "we select different cmd populations as shown in fig .",
    "[ boxes ] , and draw their spatial distribution ( as density maps ) in fig .  [ map ] .",
    "rgb stars present a regular and elongated shape , with no clear signs of disturbance .",
    "intermediate - age stars produce a very noisy stellar density map but have a significant overdensity at the center of eri  ii .",
    "the map for candidate bs stars is similarly noisy , but it still shows a possible central concentration , which would favor the intermediate - age population interpretation ( bs binary systems are expected to have a spatial distribution similar to that of the old population ) .",
    "the bhb and rhb maps have a very high significance above the field level ; the bhb sample s highest overdensity is slightly offset from eri  ii s center .",
    "@xcite suggested that eri  ii possesses a young stellar population component ( @xmath0@xmath32  myr ) based on the presence of a few stars blueward of the rgb s bright end ( at @xmath33@xmath34 and @xmath35@xmath36 ) .",
    "if these were truly young stars , we would detect sources along the main sequence portion ( around @xmath37 ) of the young isochrone plotted in fig .",
    "16 of @xcite , but we do not observe these in our dataset .",
    "the distance to eri  ii from the luminosity of its bhb ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "we adopt the fiducial hb sequence for m92 from @xcite , and convert the pan - starrs1 magnitudes into the sdss system following @xcite . while we adopt the nominal m92 distance value reported by @xcite ( @xmath38 , from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , other studies have measured slightly different values , as high as @xmath39 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but they are all within their respective @xmath40 errors .",
    "we thus adopt an m92 distance uncertainty of @xmath41 , which is the major source of error in our measurement .",
    "we perform a least - squares fitting of the m92 hb fiducial to eri  ii s bhb , and we find a best - fit value of @xmath42 , corresponding to a distance of @xmath43  mpc .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite .",
    "we re - determine structural parameters for eri  ii with the same maximum likelihood technique utilized for most of the other local group ( lg ) dwarfs @xcite .",
    "rgb stars were included in our structural analysis ; we did not explicitly include the hb or potential younger stellar population , although any true younger stellar population would inevitably have rgb stars that would also be included .",
    "we did not mask the central star cluster for our structural analysis , although a separate calculation with the star cluster masked out led to structural parameters within 1-@xmath44 of the original .",
    "the free parameters of our exponential profile plus constant background fit were : central position , position angle , ellipticity , @xmath23 and background surface density ( results are reported in table  [ tab1 ] ) .",
    "uncertainties were determined by bootstrap resampling the data 1000 times , recalculating the structural parameters for each resample .",
    "eri  ii s surface brightness profile is well fit by an exponential with @xmath45  pc , and its ellipticity is high ( @xmath46 ) , similar to other faint mw satellites @xcite .",
    "the central surface brightness is derived from the total luminosity ( see below ) , @xmath23 and the ellipticity , and it is @xmath47  mag / arcsec@xmath48 .",
    "while most of the derived parameters are in line with the discovery results , our @xmath23 is higher by a factor of @xmath0@xmath49 : deep follow - up photometric studies often lead to increased @xmath23 values with respect to shallower datasets ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    ".    given the likely presence of two subpopulations , we derive the absolute magnitude of eri  ii as follows .",
    "we derive the completeness - corrected and field - subtracted luminosity for each subpopulation by summing the flux of stars in a magnitude range where the corresponding isochrones do not overlap within the observational errors ( @xmath50 for the intermediate - age population and @xmath51 for the older population ) .",
    "the luminosity is computed within @xmath23 and then multiplied by two .",
    "we extrapolate the total luminosity given by each component starting from the fraction of light contributed in the selected magnitude ranges , as estimated from theoretical luminosity functions from @xcite .",
    "these are constructed with a salpeter initial mass function , one for a 10  gyr , [ fe / h]@xmath52 population and the other for a 3  gyr , [ fe / h]@xmath29 population .",
    "the luminosities associated with the subpopulations are @xmath53@xmath54 and @xmath55@xmath56 : the intermediate - age population contributes @xmath0@xmath57 of eri  ii s light , and only a few percent of its stellar mass .",
    "the total absolute magnitude for eri  ii is @xmath58 ( the @xmath59-band magnitude was obtained using the @xcite transformations ) , which is between the values reported by @xcite and @xcite . in case the stars brighter than the old subgiant branch had a bs component , the absolute magnitude of eri  ii would not significantly change , given their small number .          to constrain the hi content of eri  ii , we obtained position - switched hi observations ( agbt-16a-186 ; pi : spekkens ) on the robert c. byrd green bank telescope ( gbt ) on 2016 feb 23 . in the range @xmath60  @xmath61 and @xmath62  @xmath61  encompassing possible hi recessional velocities of mw satellites that do not overlap with the mw hi emission itself along the eri  ii line of sight  the gbt spectrum has an rms noise @xmath63mjy at a spectral resolution of @xmath64 .",
    "we do not find any hi emission in this velocity range within the @xmath65 gbt beam at this frequency .",
    "combining this non - detection with the distance and luminosity values derived above , a putative hi counterpart has a 5@xmath44 , @xmath64 hi mass upper limit of @xmath66 out to @xmath0@xmath67 , and therefore @xmath68 ; this constraint is a factor of @xmath07 more stringent than that derived by @xcite using hipass data .",
    "eri  ii is therefore extremely gas - poor , similar to other dwarf spheroidal galaxies in the local volume @xcite .      a dense collection of stars near eri  ii s center stand out from the overall diffuse nature of the dwarf ( fig .  [ images ] ; see also * ? ? ?",
    "this likely star cluster makes eri  ii , at @xmath69@xmath70  mag , by far the least luminous dwarf galaxy to host such an object .",
    "the position of the cluster is nearly at the calculated center of eri  ii ( @xmath0@xmath71  pc off - center in projection ) , and within its uncertainties ( see tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) .",
    "small offsets between centrally - located clusters and the exact center of their parent dwarf galaxy are commonly observed ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , so we plausibly consider this as a candidate nuclear star cluster , more specifically the only one known within such a faint galaxy .    in fig .",
    "[ images ] , we overlay on eri  ii s cmd the stars contained within twice the @xmath23 of its cluster ( see below ) . the center of the cluster was computed iteratively as the average of the stellar positions within circles of decreasing radius .",
    "since the cluster is only partially resolved , its cmd is poorly populated , but still consistent with eri  ii s cmd . to test this",
    ", we randomly draw 1000 sub - cmds with the same number of sources as in the cluster from eri  ii s cmd : the results resemble the cluster s cmd , and @xmath72 of the realizations also lack a bhb .",
    "we compute the cluster s properties via integrated photometry , assuming a circular radius ( the cluster is visually round ) .",
    "the surface brightness profile for the cluster is derived after masking bright stars and background galaxies , and is then fit with a sersic profile ( best - fit values are reported in tab .",
    "[ tab1 ] ) .",
    "the absolute magnitude is derived by integrating the best - fit sersic profile and is @xmath73 at the distance of eri  ii , which contributes to @xmath0@xmath4 of its host s luminosity .",

    "such objects are believed to survive only within weak tidal fields ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "is eri  ii s cluster a survivor ?",

    "since the timescale for evaporation due to two - body relaxation is on the order of @xmath24 times this quantity , internal processes must not be relevant for our object , and the weak tidal field of eri  ii likely does not contribute to a possible tidal truncation .",
    "a disruption could happen in presence of strong external tidal forces , however the lack of tidal features in eri  ii and its large galactocentric distance make this an unrealistic possibility .    nuclear star clusters in dwarf galaxies likely form via inspiral due to dynamical friction , rather than being born in situ ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , even though this interpretation is far from definitive . around the mw and m31",
    "only a handful of satellites host clusters , the faintest being fornax ( @xmath14@xmath110 ) and and  i ( @xmath14@xmath111 ; @xcite ) , but none of these seem to be a nuclear star cluster . in fornax ,",
    "the presence of a globular cluster system and the lack of a nuclear cluster suggest that the dynamical friction timescale is prolonged by the existence of a cored , rather than cuspy , dark matter profile @xcite . beyond the lg , a few dwarfs as faint as @xmath14@xmath112 host candidate globular clusters @xcite ; however , a deep study of the fornax galaxy cluster found no galaxies with @xmath113@xmath112 ( out of a sample of @xmath114 ) with nuclear star clusters @xcite .",
    "clearly , the cluster in eri  ii is a rare event : this will be key to investigate the formation of clusters in such faint galaxies , and the modeling of its dynamical friction timescales may help constrain eri  ii s dark matter profile .",
    "why , finally , are there no other dwarfs fainter than @xmath14@xmath112 with confirmed clusters ?",
    "@xcite suggest a scenario where at least a fraction of the outer halo galactic clusters may in fact reside in extremely low stellar density subhalos ( like eri  ii ) , which have so far gone undetected .",
