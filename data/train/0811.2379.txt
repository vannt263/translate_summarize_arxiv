    "it is now widely believed that the universe at redshifts smaller than unity underwent a  dynamic phase transition \" from decelerating to accelerating expansion which has been corroborated by several independent analyzes . in the context of the general relativity theory such",
    "a phenomenon can be interpreted as a dynamic influence of some sort of dark energy whose main effect is to change the sign of the universal decelerating parameter @xmath10 .    the most direct observation supporting the present accelerating stage of the universe comes from the luminosity distance versus redshift relation measurements using supernovas ( sne ) type ia @xcite .",
    "initially , they were interpreted in light of @xmath9cdm scenarios using either background or inhomogeneous luminosity distances @xcite .",
    "however , independent theoretical and observational / statistical analyses point to more general models whose basic ingredient is a negative - pressure dark energy component @xcite .",
    "nowadays , the most accepted cosmic picture is an expanding flat ( or nearly flat ) spatial geometry whose dynamics is driven by an exotic component called dark energy , 3/4 of composition , and 1/4 for matter component ( baryons plus dark ) . among a number of possibilities to describe this dark energy component , the simplest and most theoretically appealing way is by means of a positive cosmological constant @xmath9 .",
    "other possible candidates are : a vacuum decaying energy density , or a time varying @xmath9-term @xcite , a time varying relic scalar field slowly rolling down its potential @xcite , the so - called  x - matter \" , an extra component simply characterized by an equation of state @xmath11 @xcite , the chaplygin gas whose equation of state is given by @xmath12 where @xmath13 is a positive constant @xcite . for scalar field and xcdm scenarios ,",
    "the @xmath14 parameter may be a function of the redshift @xcite , or still , as it has been recently discussed , it may violate the dominant energy condition and assume values @xmath15 when the extra component is named phantom cosmology @xcite",
    ". it should be stressed , however , that all these models are based on the validity of general relativity or some of its scalar - tensorial generalizations .    on the other hand , turner and riess @xcite",
    "have discussed an alternative route - sometimes called kinematic approach - in order to obtain information about the beginning of the present accelerating stage of the universe with no assumption concerning the validity of general relativity or even of any particular metric gravitational theory ( in this connection see also weinberg @xcite ) .",
    "although considering that such a method does not shed light on the physical or geometrical properties of the new energetic component causing the acceleration , it allows one to assess the direct empirical evidence for the transition deceleration / acceleration in the past , as provided by sne type ia measurements .",
    "many authors have constrained values for the transition redshift ( @xmath16 ) , explored implications on the cosmic acceleration , or yet , used it as trustworthy discriminator for cosmology .",
    "this value is obtained without supposing any energy components ( baryons , dark matter , dark energy ) , or any other cause for acceleration @xcite .",
    "more recently , mortsell and clarkson @xcite applied a kinematic approach to determine if the copernican assumption is violated .",
    "moreover , by using a taylor expansion of the scale factor , it was found that the acceleration today is detected to an accuracy @xmath17 .",
    "it was also claimed with basis on the ratio of the scale of the baryon acoustic oscillations as imprinted in the cosmic microwave background and in the large scale distribution of galaxies , that a flat or negatively curved universe decelerate at high redshifts .    in this paper , by adopting the kinematic approach for which the full gravitational theory also does not play a prominent role , we investigate the cosmological implications on the transition redshift @xmath16 and deceleration parameters from the supernovae cosmology project ( scp ) union sample @xcite .",
    "to begin with , let us assume that the spatially flat friedman - robertson - walker ( frw ) metric geometry , as motivated by inflation and the wmap results @xcite .",
    "following standard lines @xcite , the luminosity distance is kinematically defined by the following integral expression ( in our units @xmath18 ) .",
    "@xmath19d\\ln ( 1+u)\\right ] } du , & \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the @xmath20 is the hubble parameter , and , @xmath10 , the deceleration parameter , is defined by @xmath21    although generalizable for non - zero curvature , eq .",
    "( 1 ) is not a crude approximation as one may think at first sight . in the framework of a flat frw type universe",
    ", it is an exact expression for the luminosity distance which depends on the epoch - dependent deceleration parameter , @xmath10 , as well as on the present hubble constant , @xmath22 .",
    "the simplest way to work with the coupled definitions ( 1 ) and ( 2 ) as a kinematic model for the sn type ia data is by adopting a parametric representations for @xmath10 .",
    "as one may check , in the case of a linear two - parameter expansion for @xmath23 @xcite , the integral ( 1 ) can be represented in terms of a special function as ( see @xcite ) @xmath24,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath25 is the present value of the deceleration parameter , @xmath26 is the derivative in the redshift evaluated at @xmath27 , and @xmath28 is the incomplete gamma function with the condition @xmath29 must be satisfied ( for more details see cunha and lima@xcite ) .",
    "now , by using the above expressions we may get information about @xmath1 , @xmath2 and , therefore , about the global behavior of @xmath10 .",
    "note also that a positive transition redshift , @xmath16 , is obtained only for positive signs of @xmath2 ( the variation rate of @xmath1 ) since @xmath1 is negative and the dynamic transition ( from decelerating to accelerating ) happens at @xmath30 , or equivalently , @xmath31 .    in the statistical analysis below",
    "we consider the most complete dataset we have right now , scp union sample@xcite .",
    "the union sne compilation is a new dataset of low - redshift nearby- hubble - flow sne and new analysis procedures to work with several heterogeneous compilations sne ia .",
    "it includes 13 independent sets with sne from the scp , high - z supernovae search ( hzsns ) team , supernova legacy survey and essence survey , the older datasets , as well as the recently extended dataset of distant supernovae observed with hst .",
    "after selection cuts , the robust compilation obtained is composed by 307 sne ia events distributed over the redshift interval @xmath32 .",
    "the analysis below is based on the luminosity distance as given by [ 1 ] with the  linear expansion \" for @xmath10 .",
    "the primary aim is to limit the parameters @xmath1 and @xmath2 by using the union compilation data as above discussed .",
    "all the results are derived by marginalizing the likelihood function over the nuisance parameter , @xmath22 , thereby obtaining the contours and the associated probabilities .    in figure 1",
    "we show the theoretical predictions of the kinematic approach to the residual hubble diagram with respect to an eternally coasting universe model ( @xmath33 ) .",
    "the different models are characterized by the selected values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , as depicted in the diagram .",
    "let us consider the maximum likelihood that can be determined from a @xmath34 statistics for a given set of parameters @xmath35 . in what follows we investigate the bounds arising on the empirical @xmath10 parameters and the probability of the redshift transition for each sne type ia sample .",
    "by marginalizing the likelihood function over the nuisance parameter , @xmath22 , the contours and the probabilities of the transition redshift for each sample are readily computed .    in figure 2a , we see that the scp union sample strongly favors a universe with recent acceleration ( @xmath36 ) and previous deceleration ( @xmath37 ) . with two free parameter",
    "the confidence region is @xmath38 and @xmath39 with ( @xmath40 ) confidence level .",
    "it should be remarked the presence of a forbidden region forming a trapezium .",
    "the horizontal line in the top is defined by @xmath41 which leads to an infinite ( positive or negative ) transition redshift while the segment at @xmath42 is the infinite future ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "the values of @xmath16 associated with the horizontal segment in the bottom are always smaller than -1 ( no transition region ) , in fact @xmath44 .",
    "finally , one may conclude that the vertical segment is associated with @xmath45 , thereby demonstrating that the hachured trapezium is actually a physically forbidden region .    in figure 2b ( the center panel )",
    "one may see the probability of the associated transition redshift @xmath16 , defined as @xmath30 .",
    "it has been derived by summing the probability density in the @xmath1 versus the @xmath46 plane along lines of constant transition redshift , @xmath47 .",
    "the resulting analysis yields @xmath48 ( @xmath6 ) @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) for one free parameter which is in reasonable agreement with the value @xmath49 @xcite . in our analysis",
    ", the asymmetry in the probability of @xmath16 is produced by a partially parabolic curve obtained when @xmath34 is minimized . for this panel the central value @xmath50 does not agree with the cosmic concordance @xmath9cdm model in @xmath51% confidence level .",
    "however , it agrees with @xmath52% ( @xmath8 ) for this approach .",
    "note that @xmath53 ( @xmath16 for flat @xmath9cdm with @xmath54 ) is outside of the allowed region with @xmath55 , while , @xmath56 ( flat @xmath9cdm with @xmath57 and @xmath58 ) are well inside for the union sample .",
    ".limits to the transition redshift @xmath16 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     at this point it is interesting to investigate how our analysis constrains the redshift evolution of the decelerating parameter itself .",
    "the basic results are displayed in fig .",
    "2c , we see the evolution of the decelerating parameter as a function of the redshift for the parametrization @xmath0 .",
    "the shadowed region denotes the 2@xmath59 region .",
    "the data favor the recent acceleration ( @xmath36 ) and past deceleration ( @xmath60 ) with high confidence level .",
    "it is also interesting to compare the results derived here with another independent analyses .",
    "the first constraints using this parametrization was obtained by riess and collaborators from 157 sne the transition redshift was constrained to be at @xmath61 @xcite .",
    "more recently , using 182 sne riess _",
    "obtained @xmath62 for the probability density in the @xmath1 vs. @xmath2 plane along lines of constant transition redshift @xcite . in an early paper , we studied this parametrization to three samples . for astier data set 2006 we obtained @xmath63 , gold sample 2007 the constraints were @xmath64 , and davies data set 2007 @xmath65 . the asymmetries in our errors preserve the asymmetries in the @xmath34 analysis @xcite .",
    "besides that , bayesian analysis was implemented to study this kinematic scenario by elgary and multamki @xcite , and , a kinematical study from type ia supernovae and x - ray cluster gas mass fraction measurements , by combining them they obtain significantly tighter results than using the sne sample alone @xcite .    in table 1",
    "we summarize the recent results to the transition redshift @xmath16 in the kinematic approach derived from different samples of sne ia data .",
    "as shown there , for phenomenological law @xmath66 the limits were derived separately for each sample of sne type ia data .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the transition redshift obtained from a kinematical approach within a flat frw standard line element .",
    "our study strongly favors a universe with recent acceleration ( @xmath36 ) and previous deceleration ( @xmath37 ) for an analysis which is independent of the matter - energy content of the universe based on the phenomenological law , @xmath67 , and the scp data compilation @xcite . in our analysis",
    "we use the analytical expression to the distance luminosity @xcite , as well as , the excluded regions with @xmath68 ( figure 2a ) .",
    "the likelihood function for the transition redshift was also discussed . in this case",
    ", the confidence regions in the bidimensional space parameter ( @xmath3 ) do not cross the physically forbidden region .",
    "our analysis provides an independent evidence for a dynamical model in which a kinematic transition phase deceleration / acceleration happened at redshifts smaller than unity .",
    "hopefully , the constraints on @xmath16 will be considerably improved in the near future with the increasing of supernova data at intermediate and high redshifts .",
