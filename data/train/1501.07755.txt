    "in the last two decades , much progress has been made in the experimental studies of the electron transport in nanoscale devices  . in the systems smaller than the coherent length , quantum effects",
    "are observed in the electron transport  . in order to analyze it beyond the linear - response regime theoretically , we need to treat nonequilibrium steady states realized in _ open _ quantum systems .",
    "the landauer formula  @xcite enables the calculation of the electric current flowing across nanoscale samples in noninteracting cases , which indicates that the nonequilibrium steady states are scattering states in the open quantum systems .",
    "indeed , the transport properties such as the electrical conductance and the electric - current noise are determined by the scattering matrix  . to investigate interacting cases ,",
    "the keldysh formalism of the nonequilibrium green s function has been developed  .",
    "it has provided a standard tool for the study of the kondo effect measured as a conductance peak in semiconductor quantum dots ( qds )  @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "we have proposed an extension of the landauer formula to interacting cases  , and have shown that the scattering states are essential in the interacting cases as well .",
    "the interacting resonant - level model ( irlm ) is one of the standard testbeds for such studies of the open qd systems with interactions .",
    "the original irlm , which consists of a single impurity coupled to a conduction band , was introduced for studying the kondo problem in equilibrium systems  @xcite .",
    "recently , the irlm with _ two _ external leads has been employed as a minimal model of open qd systems with coulomb interactions ; it plays an important role in verifying the theoretical approaches such as the nonequilibrium bethe - ansatz approach  @xcite , the perturbation theory with the numerical renormalization group  @xcite , a new method called impurity conditions  @xcite and the time - dependent density - matrix renormalization - group method  @xcite .",
    "a remarkable feature of the two - lead irlm is the appearance of _ negative differential conductance _",
    ", that is , the suppression of the electric current due to the coulomb interaction for large bias voltages .",
    "clearly , this is a phenomenon out of the linear - response regime . to see the feature and to compare the results obtained by different approaches , the _ universal electric current _ characterized by a single scaling parameter @xmath0 is useful  @xcite .",
    "indeed , it is found that , for large bias voltages @xmath1 , the universal electric current shows a power - law decay @xmath2 with the parameter @xmath3 of the coulomb interaction  .    in the previous papers  , we proposed an extension of the landauer formula with many - electron scattering eigenstates .",
    "we considered the two - lead irlm with linearized dispersion relations and gave _ exact _ many - electron scattering eigenstates in explicit forms .",
    "this is in contrast to the previous studies   of the scattering problems for other qd systems , which include integrals or matrix inversions .",
    "the explicit @xmath4-electron scattering eigenstates enabled us to calculate the quantum - mechanical expectation value of the electric current , which we called the @xmath4-electron current . by taking the electron - reservoir limit @xmath5 of the @xmath4-electron current",
    ", we obtained the average electric current for the system under finite bias voltages .",
    "it is clear that the way of realizing the nonequilibrium steady states in our extension of the landauer formula is different from the keldysh formalism  . by employing a renormalization - group technique with the callan - symanzik equation  @xcite",
    ", we arrived at the universal electric current in the first order of the interaction parameter @xmath3 .",
    "we found that the negative differential conductance of the universal electric current is characterized by the same scaling parameter @xmath0 as that obtained by other approaches  .",
    "we remark that the apparent inconsistency in ref .   pointed out in ref .",
    "is removed in the level of the universal electric current  @xcite .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the two - lead irlm in which the qd is connected to the two external leads _",
    "asymmetrically_. the effect of the asymmetry of the qd systems is observed in experiments .",
    "for example , in semiconductor qds  , the asymmetry of the lead - dot couplings causes breaking of the unitary limit of the kondo effect , which is theoretically understood in the linear - response regime  @xcite . in the present study",
    ", we investigate the effect of the asymmetry on electron transport out of the linear - response regime .",
    "one of the theoretical difficulties of the asymmetric cases is that the even - odd transformation , which maps the two - lead irlm to two single - lead systems  , does not work .",
    "the application of the bethe - ansatz approach  @xcite has been restricted to the cases in which the even - odd transformation works .",
    "the construction of exact many - electron scattering eigenstates for such pure two - lead systems is established for the first time in this paper .    through the extension of the landauer formula and a renormalization - group technique",
    ", we obtain the universal electric current for the asymmetric cases in the first order of the coulomb - interaction parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the universal electric current is characterized by the two renormalized parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "the sum @xmath10 provides a scaling parameter for the bias voltage @xmath1 , which is similar to the symmetric cases .",
    "our universal electric current has the same functional form as that obtained by the renormalization - group approach  , although there is a difference in our calculation of the renormalized parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 . as we will point at the end of section  [ sec : electric - current ] , this leads to a critical difference in the predicted behavior of the universal electric current .",
    "the suppressed electric current due to the coulomb interaction is restored by the asymmetry of the system parameters . to clarify the relation between the asymmetry of the system parameters and the restoration of the suppressed electric current , we introduce the asymmetry parameter @xmath11 taking the value in the range @xmath12 with the average interaction @xmath13 .",
    "in fact , in the first order of @xmath6 and @xmath7 , the power - law decay of the universal electric current is given by @xmath14 , which indicates that the restoration of the suppressed electric current occurs with both asymmetric coulomb interactions and asymmetric lead - dot couplings .",
    "the restoration was reported to happen even for symmetric lead - dot couplings in refs .   and , but we presume that this was due to higher orders of the interaction @xmath15 in the renormalized parameters @xmath8 and @xmath9 .    the exact many - electron scattering eigenstates tell us much about the transport properties of interacting electrons in the open qd systems .",
    "we notice that the scattering processes in which the set of wave numbers of incident plane waves is not conserved are essential in interacting cases .",
    "the explicit form of the scattering eigenstates indicates that , due to the coulomb interactions , the incident plane - wave states are partially scattered to _ many - body bound states _ that decay exponentially as the electrons separate from each other .",
    "indeed , the two - body bound states appear in the two - lead irlm ; each term of the @xmath4-electron scattering states is characterized by the configuration of the two - body bound states .",
    "we can understand the origin of the negative differential conductance in the two - lead irlm in terms of the formation of two - body bound states . such many - body bound states",
    "are also found in other open qd systems  .",

    "we consider the open qd system described by the irlm of spinless electrons .",
    "it consists of a qd with a single energy level and two external leads of noninteracting electrons .",
    "the arrangement of the qd and the two leads is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : irlm - asym2-system ] .",
    "we assume the situation in which the qd is connected to the two leads asymmetrically .",

    "the first term corresponds to the kinetic energy of electrons in the leads , where @xmath22 stands for the length of the two leads to be eventually taken to infinity .",
    "the second term expresses the tunneling between the leads and the qd , where the parameter @xmath23 is the transfer integral .",
    "we assume a single energy level @xmath24 on the qd , which corresponds to the third term .",
    "the fourth term describes the coulomb interaction between the two electrons at the origin @xmath25 of the lead @xmath19 and on the qd .",
    "the parameter @xmath26 is the strength of the coulomb repulsion .",

    "we assume that the electrons emitted from the electron reservoir into the lead @xmath19 follow the fermi distribution function @xmath37 with the chemical potential @xmath38 and the inverse temperature @xmath39 .",
    "we are interested in the nonequilibrium steady state realized between the large two electron reservoirs in the cases @xmath40 of different chemical potentials .",

    "our purpose is to study the average electric current flowing across the qd of the two - lead irlm beyond the linear - response regime .",
    "the extension of the landauer formula , which was proposed in refs .   and",
    ", consists of the following three steps :    * construction of many - electron scattering eigenstates whose incident states are free - electronic plane waves in the leads ; * calculation of the quantum - mechanical expectation value of the electric current with the many - electron scattering eigenstates ; * calculation of the statistical - mechanical average of the electric current by assuming the equilibration of electrons in each electron reservoir .",
    "the many - electron scattering eigenstates constructed in the step ( i ) are characterized by the wave numbers of the incident plane waves .",
    "we note that they are essentially different from the bethe - ansatz eigenstates  @xcite , whose incident states are not free electronic but include the effect of interactions .",
    "the bethe - ansatz result in ref .   did not agree with results of the previous works  @xcite while our results agree with them .",
    "for the wave numbers @xmath49 of the @xmath50-electron incident plane wave coming in through the lead 1 and @xmath51 of the @xmath52-electron incident plane wave coming in through the lead 2 , we express the @xmath4-electron scattering eigenstates by @xmath53 with @xmath54 . in the step ( ii )",

    "we call the limit an electron - reservoir limit",
    ". clearly , the reservoir limit corresponds to taking the statistical - mechanical average of the electric current for all the incident states that follow the fermi distributions . in general , the electrons scattered at the qd are in many - body states including the effect of interactions .",
    "we assume that such many - body states are completely equilibrated to the fermi degenerate state of free electrons in each election reservoir before being re - emitted towards the qd , which is the main assumption of the extension of the landauer formula .",
