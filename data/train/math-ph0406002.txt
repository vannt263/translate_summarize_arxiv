    "mathews and lakshmanan studied in 1974 @xcite,@xcite , the equation @xmath3 as an example of a non - linear oscillator ( notice @xmath4 was written just as @xmath5 in the original paper ) .",
    "in fact they considered ( [ eq1 ] ) as a particular case of the differential equation @xmath6 that can be solved by using a two steps procedure : ( i ) first a reduction of order can be fulfilled by the change @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 ; ( ii ) then the corresponding first order equation can be solved by using @xmath10 , as an integrating factor . in this case we have @xmath11 and hence @xmath12 ; the general solution takes the form @xmath13 with the following additional restriction linking frequency and amplitude @xmath14 that is , the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) represents a non - linear oscillator with periodic solutions that they qualify as having a  simple harmonic form \" .",
    "the authors also proved that ( [ eq1 ] ) is obtainable from the lagrangian @xmath15 which they considered as the one - dimensional analogue of the lagrangian density @xmath16 appearing in some models of quantum field theory @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is therefore an interesting example of a system with nonlinear oscillations with a frequency ( or period ) showing amplitude dependence . as a quantum system ,",
    "the one - dimensional schroedinger equation involving the potential @xmath17 was considered in @xcite as an example of anharmonic oscillator , and later on studied in @xcite-@xcite ; the three - dimensional quantum problem was considered in @xcite,@xcite ( e.g. , in @xcite the bohr - sommerfeld quantization procedure was applied in relation with some previous studies @xcite,@xcite , in nonpolynomial quantum mechanical models ) .",
    "we observe that this system can also be considered as an oscillator with a position - dependent effective mass ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the main objective of this article is to develop a deeper analysis of the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) and the lagrangian ( [ lagn1 ] ) , first proving that this particular @xmath18-dependent nonlinear system can be generalized to the two - dimensional case , and even to the @xmath0-dimensional case , and second , pointing towards a simple geometric interpretation of the system so obtained . in more detail ,",
    "the plan of the article is as follows : sec .",
    "2 is devoted to the properties of the @xmath18-dependent kinetic part of the lagrangian and the @xmath18-dependent two - dimensional free motion . in sec .  3 , that must be considered as the central part of this article , we study the @xmath18-dependent two - dimensional oscillator ; we have divided this section in three parts : in the first part we discuss the existence of noether symmetries for @xmath18-dependent lagrangians of the form @xmath19   -   v(x , y;\\la)\\,.\\ ] ] in the second part we discuss the properties of the @xmath18-oscillator described by the lagrangian @xmath20    - \\frac{\\al^2}{2}\\bigl(\\frac{r^2}{1 + \\la\\,r^2 } \\bigr)\\,,\\quad    r^2 = x^2+y^2\\,,\\ ] ] first proving that such system is superintegrable and then solving the equations of motion using the lagrangian formalism as an approach ; the third part deals with the hamiltonian formalism and the @xmath18-dependent hamilton - jacobi equation which is shown to be separable in three different coordinate systems . in sec .",
    "4 we study the @xmath18-dependent @xmath0-dimensional nonlinear oscillator described by the lagrangian @xmath21    - \\frac{\\al^2}{2}\\bigl(\\frac{r^2}{1 + \\la\\,r^2 } \\bigr)\\,,\\quad    r^2 = \\sum_i x_i^2 \\,,\\ ] ] and we solve the associated equations obtaining different types of solutions depending of the values of @xmath18 . next we consider the hamiltonian approach , we prove that it is a super - integrable system and we obtain different families of constants of motion ; the existence of several different sets of @xmath0 commuting integrals is also discussed . in sec .",
    "5 we start with a discussion of lie algebra structure of the symmetries of the @xmath22 non - linear oscillator ; in fact we see that they span a three - dimensional real lie algebra isomorphic to @xmath23 , @xmath24 or the euclidean group in two dimensions , depending on the sign of the parameter @xmath25",
    ". then we present a geometric approach which explains the surprising properties this @xmath18-dependent system has and relates it to the harmonic oscillator in spaces of constant curvature studied in ref.@xcite-@xcite . finally , in sec .",
    "6 we make some final comments .",
    "we will make use of the lagrangian formalism as an approach .",
    "that is , we will look , in the first place , for a lagrangian function @xmath26 with appropriate properties and then , we will turn our attention to the corresponding nonlinear equations arising from @xmath26 .",
    "it is clear that the equation ( 1 ) represents a non - linear version of a linear equation with a non - linearity introduced by the coefficient @xmath18 ; but the important point is that , in lagrangian terms , this coefficient @xmath18 modifies not only the quadratic potential @xmath27 of the harmonic oscillator but also the kinetic term @xmath28 .",
    "therefore , this particular system is not directly related with henon - heiles or any other similar non - linear system @xcite-@xcite where the nonlinearity is introduced by just adding a new term of higher order to the original potential .",
    "our first aim is to extend to @xmath22 dimensions this system in such a way that its distinguishing properties are maintained .",
    "so in order to construct the appropriate two - dimensional lagrangian , we may split the problem in two : the problem of the kinetic term and the problem of the potential .",
    "next we begin with that of the kinetic term .    before giving the expression for the two  dimensional kinetic term ,",
    "let us consider some properties of the one - dimensional free - particle motion characterized by the following lagrangian @xmath29 and the following equation @xmath30 two important properties are : ( i ) the function @xmath31 is invariant under the action of the vector field @xmath32 given by @xmath33 in the sense that we have @xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the natural lift to the phase space @xmath36 ( tangent bundle in differential geometric terms ) of the vector field @xmath37 , @xmath38 ( ii ) the general solution of the equation of motion , that can be directly obtained from the conservation of the energy @xmath39 , is given by @xmath40 it is clear that this expression satisfies correctly the linear limit for @xmath41 .",
    "the first problem of the transition from 1-d to 2-d configuration space is the construction of the new two - dimensional @xmath42 .",
    "many different @xmath18-dependent functions will have the same @xmath41 limit , so we must require that the new function @xmath42 must satisfy certain properties . on the one hand we think that a natural requirement for @xmath42 is to satisfy the two - dimensional versions of the previous points ( i ) and ( ii ) . on the other hand the potential @xmath43 for the two - dimensional oscillator ( to be studied in the next section ) must be a @xmath18-dependent central potential such that the angular momentum be preserved ; but , according to the noether theorem , exact symmetries of the potential lead to constants of motion only if they also are symmetries of the  kinetic energy \" .",
    "hence , a necessary condition must be that @xmath42 be also preserved with the same symmetry .",
    "we will consider as the starting point for our approach the following three requirements .    1 .",
    "the kinetic term @xmath42 must be a quadratic function of the velocities that will remain invariant under rotations in the @xmath44 plane .",
    "this means that it must depend of the coordinates @xmath45 , @xmath46 , by means of @xmath47 , and of the velocities @xmath48 , @xmath49 , by means of @xmath50 , @xmath51 , @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "2 .   @xmath42 should be invariant under ( the lifts of ) the two vector fields @xmath54 and @xmath55 given by @xmath56 that represent the natural extension to @xmath44 of the vector field @xmath37 associated to @xmath31 in the one - dimensional case .",
    "notice that the previous point ( 1 ) implies that if @xmath42 is invariant under ( the lift of ) @xmath54 then so will be under ( the lift of ) @xmath55 .",
    "3 .   it must lead to a solution @xmath57 in @xmath44 for the two - dimensional free - particle motion similar to the hyperbolic function @xmath58 in @xmath59 given by ( [ xn1t1 ] ) , for the one - dimensional free - particle motion .",
    "the most direct and simplest generalization of the one - dimensional kinetic term @xmath31 is given by @xmath60 but this function does not satisfy the point ( 2 ) .",
    "so let us try a more general expression given by @xmath61 where @xmath62 denotes @xmath63 then the point ( 2 ) is satisfied only if @xmath64 hence , we will choose the following two - dimensional kinetic function @xmath65 \\,,\\quad    r^2 = x^2+y^2      \\ , , \\label{tn2}\\ ] ] as the appropriate one for the two - dimensional @xmath18-dependent dynamics . notice that this means that the @xmath18-dependence is introduced in two different ways : the first one is the global factor @xmath66 that is the most direct @xmath22 extension of the one - dimensional factor @xmath67 in ( [ lagn1 ] )",
    "; the other @xmath18-term is not so simple and it represents a two - dimensional contribution that was not present ( in fact , it can not be defined ) in the one - dimensional case . although one could guess that this additional term can introduce difficulties",
    ", we will see that it really simplifies most of properties , mainly all those related with symmetries ( the geometric aspects will be discussed in sec .  5 ) .",
    "we also point out that we admit @xmath18 can take both positive and negative values .",
    "it is clear that for @xmath68 , @xmath69 , the function ( and the associated dynamics ) will have a singularity at @xmath70 ; because of this we will restrict the study of the dynamics to the interior of the circle @xmath71 that is the region in which @xmath42 is positive definite .",
    "it is known that a symmetric bilinear form in the velocities @xmath72 can be considered as associated to a two - dimensional metric @xmath73 in @xmath44 . in this particular case ,",
    "the function @xmath42 considered as a bilinear form determines the following @xmath18-dependent metric @xmath74\\ , .",
    "\\label{ds2}\\ ] ] this relation between kinetic term and metric implies that the killing vectors of the @xmath18-metric @xmath75 coincide with the exact noether symmetries of the @xmath18-dependent free motion , that is , of the dynamics determined by assuming the kinetic term as lagrangian , @xmath76 .",
    "@xmath42 remains invariant under the actions of the lifts of the vector fields @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath77 , given by @xmath78 in the sense that , if we denote by @xmath79 , @xmath80 , the natural lift to the tangent bundle ( phase space @xmath81 ) of the vector field @xmath82 , @xmath83 then the lie derivatives of @xmath42 with respect to @xmath84 vanish , that is @xmath85    we close this section by solving the two - dimensional free - particle motion determined by two - dimensional kinetic function ( [ tn2 ] ) .    the euler equations arising from @xmath76 , and representing the @xmath22 generalization of ( [ eqn1t1 ] ) , are @xmath86\\,x = 0\\,,\\cr    & & ( 1 + \\la\\,r^2)\\,\\ddot{y }     - \\la\\,\\bigl[\\,\\dot{x}^2 + \\dot{y}^2 + \\la\\,(x\\dot{y } - y\\dot{x})^2\\,\\bigr]\\,y   = 0\\ , . \\label{eqn2t2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] of course they are much more difficult of solving than the single equation ( [ eqn1t1 ] ) ; but assuming hyperbolic / trigonometric expressions for the two functions , @xmath58 and @xmath87 , then we obtain that the solutions of ( [ eqn2t2 ] ) are given by @xmath88 with the only restriction @xmath89 after some calculus we arrive , for @xmath90 to @xmath91 hence the solutions @xmath92 reduce to @xmath93 for @xmath90 , where @xmath94 denotes the angular momentum @xmath95 . for the case @xmath68 similar reasoning",
    "leads to @xmath96 these results generalize the hyperbolic solution @xmath58 in @xmath59 given by ( [ xn1t1 ] ) and satisfy correctly the linear limit for @xmath41 .",
    "in this section we will study and solve the appropriate @xmath22 versions of the @xmath18-dependent equation ( [ eq1 ] ) and the @xmath18-dependent lagrangian ( [ lagn1 ] ) .",
    "a general standard @xmath18-dependent lagrangian ( kinetic term minus a potential ) will have the following form @xmath97 in such a way that for @xmath41 we recover the non - deformed linear system .",
    "it is known that if a potential @xmath98 , defined the euclidean plane , is invariant under either translations or rotations then it admits a noether integral of first order in the velocities .",
    "now , in this @xmath18-dependent case , we have also a rather similar situation , but as the lagrangian system is @xmath18-dependent so are the transformations .",
    "the infinitesimal transformations generated by @xmath54 are @xmath99 and can be interpreted as a @xmath18-dependent version of the translations along the @xmath45-axis .",
    "similarly the generator of the one - parameter group of @xmath18-dependent translations along the @xmath46-axis @xmath100 is the vector field @xmath55 ( the generator of rotations remains @xmath18-independent ) . if we denote by @xmath101 the cartan semibasic one - form @xmath102 \\nonumber\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then we have the following    1 .",
    "if the potential @xmath43 does not depend on the variable @xmath45 then the lagrangian @xmath26 is invariant under the transformations generated by @xmath54 ; in this case the function @xmath103 given by @xmath104 is a constant of motion .",
    "notice that in this case the coordinate @xmath45 is not cyclic since it is always present in kinetic term @xmath42 .",
    "2 .   if the potential @xmath43 is independent of the variable @xmath46 then the lagrangian @xmath26 is invariant under the transformations generated by @xmath55 ; in this case the function @xmath105 given by @xmath106 is a constant of motion .",
    "this situation is similar to the previous one ; that is , the coordinate @xmath46 is not in the potential but , for @xmath107 , it appears in the kinetic term .",

    "for @xmath90 we have that @xmath119 for @xmath120 ; so for small energies the trajectories will be bounded but for @xmath121 the trajectories will be unbounded ( see figures i and ii ; notice that we have plotted @xmath122 but the graph of @xmath110 is just the same but with @xmath123 ) .",
    "our objective is to solve the @xmath18-dependent equations arising from ( [ lagt2v2 ] ) and prove that this two - dimensional motion is periodic in the bounded case as it was in the one - dimensional case .",
    "at this point we recall that a system is called super - integrable if it is integrable ( in the sense of liouville - arnold ) and , in addition , possesses more independent first integrals than degrees of freedom ; in particular , if a system with @xmath0 degrees of freedom possesses @xmath124 independent first integrals , then it is called maximally super - integrable .",
    "an important property is that the existence of periodic motions is a characteristic related with super - integrability ; thus we may suspect that this system is super - integrable .",
    "this is actually the case , and the following proposition states the super - integrability of this @xmath18-deformed system and proves the existence of a complex factorization .",

    "we also have , in this @xmath0-dimensional case , a quasi - harmonic oscillatory motion for @xmath68 , and two different qualitative behaviours with a border - case when @xmath90 .",
    "\\(i ) periodic motions : we can assume that the solutions @xmath231 of the @xmath0 equations @xmath232 are periodic functions of the form @xmath233 then we arrive at @xmath234 where @xmath148 is given by @xmath235 therefore , we have @xmath236 but @xmath160 with @xmath237 given by @xmath238 and the energy @xmath164 is given by @xmath239    \\(ii ) unbounded motions : if we assume that the solutions @xmath231 are of the form @xmath240 then we arrive to @xmath241 with @xmath242 given by @xmath243 and the energy @xmath164 is given by @xmath244    \\(iii ) finally , in the positive @xmath90 case , there exists a very particular border - case that makes separation between the behaviours ( i ) and ( ii ) .",
    "it is characterized by the a value of the energy @xmath39 given by @xmath172 , and its time - evolution is represented by linear functions @xmath245 with the following @xmath18-dependent restriction for the @xmath246 coefficients @xmath247 , @xmath248 , @xmath249 concerning the energy @xmath164 it takes the particular value @xmath250      the @xmath0-dimensional @xmath18-deformed hamiltonian is given by @xmath251    + \\frac{\\al^2}{2}\\,\\bigl(\\frac{r^2}{1 + \\la\\,r^2 } \\bigr )    \\,,{\\quad }    r^2 = \\sum_i x_i^2   \\ , .",
    "\\label{hamtnvn}\\ ] ] it can be rewritten as a sum of @xmath252 quadratic terms as follows @xmath253 where the functions @xmath254 and @xmath255 , which are given by @xmath256 are constants of motion @xmath257 moreover , the @xmath18-dependent functions @xmath258 are constants of motion as well .",
    "of course , the existence of these three different families , @xmath254 , @xmath255 , and @xmath259 , means that all these integrals can not be independent since the maximum number of ( time - independent ) functionally independent integrals is @xmath260 . in order to obtain a fundamental set of independent integrals we can choose the @xmath0 functions @xmath254 and @xmath261 of the angular momenta ;",
    "an example is given by @xmath262 in fact this situation is rather the same that one finds in the linear @xmath41 case but with two important distinctions : first that all these facts remain valid also for the unbounded ( or scattering ) motions , present when @xmath90 and second that the algebra of poisson brackets seems to be quadratic .",
    "we close this section observing that , if we call super - separable to a system that admits hamilton - jacobi separation of variables ( schroedinger in the quantum case ) in more than one coordinate system , then quadratic super - integrability ( i.e. , super - integrability with linear or quadratic constants of motion ) can be considered as a property arising from super - separability . in this @xmath18-dependent case ,",
    "the three families of constants of motion are of such a class ( @xmath255 are linear and @xmath254 and @xmath259 are quadratic ) , so we can conclude that the super - integrability of the hamiltonian ( [ hamtnvn ] ) arises from its multiple separability . in the linear @xmath41 case ,",
    "since the hamiltonian is directly separable in the @xmath0-dimensional cartesian system , the hamiltonian is just the sum of the @xmath0 partial one - dimensional energies ; in the general nonlinear @xmath107 case , the functions @xmath263 , and @xmath255 @xmath264 , arise from separability in the @xmath0-dimensional versions of the two - dimensional coordinates @xmath190 and @xmath191 studied in sec . 3 and in the @xmath0-dimensional spherical system .",
    "finally , there exist many different sets of @xmath0 conmmuting constants ; as an example , in the @xmath265 case we have the following three sets of involutive integrals @xmath266 as well as @xmath267 .",
    "it is clear from this example that in the general @xmath0-dimensional case there exist many more different ways of constructing involutive sets of @xmath0 integrals .",
    "in this section we will discuss some additional properties that will prove to be related with a new geometric interpretation . in particular , we will see that this quasi - harmonic nonlinear oscillator turns out to be closely related with the harmonic oscillator on a space of constant curvature .",
    "we begin by considering two remarkable properties ; the first one is concerned with the symmetries of two - dimensional system and the second one with the lagrangian of the one - dimensional oscillator .",
    "\\(i ) the three @xmath18-dependent vector fields @xmath268 , @xmath269 , @xmath77 , obtained in sec .  2 as the killing vectors of the metric @xmath73 or , equivalently , as the noether symmetries of the lagrangian @xmath76 of the @xmath18-dependent free particle , close the following lie algebra , @xmath270 = { \\la}\\,x_j \\,,{\\quad }    [ x_1(\\la)\\,,x_j ] =        x_2(\\la )    \\,,{\\quad }    [ x_2(\\la)\\,,x_j ] =     -\\,x_1(\\la )    \\ , .",
    "\\label{liealg}\\ ] ] this means that the @xmath116-d configuration space has a three - dimensional symmetry lie algebra , hence a maximal one , and this implies that the space should be of constant curvature .",
    "indeed the lie algebra ( [ liealg ] ) is isomorphic to the euclidean algebra in the particular @xmath41 case , and to the lie algebra of the isometries of the two - dimensional spherical ( @xmath68 ) and hyperbolic spaces ( @xmath90 ) in the general @xmath107 case .",
    "it seems , therefore , that there exists a certain relation between this @xmath18-dependent nonlinear oscillator and the properties of the two - dimensional spaces of constant curvature . at this point",
    "we recall that we have proved in sec .",
    "4 that this nonlinear system is well defined for any number @xmath0 of degrees of freedom ; therefore , it is natural to guess that if such relationship exists then it must be true , not only for @xmath22 , but for any dimension .",
    "although the @xmath111 case can be considered as a very special case , it seems convenient to go back to the one - dimensional oscillator and analyze again its properties but now in relation with the above point ( i ) .",
    "we have obtained the following property that concerns the one - dimensional nonlinear system .",
    "\\(ii ) let us consider the change @xmath271 given by @xmath272 then the lagrangian @xmath273 becomes @xmath274 in the negative case , @xmath68 , @xmath69 , the corresponding change is given by @xmath275 and then we arrive at @xmath276 hence , we can remove the @xmath18 parameter from the kinetic energy @xmath31 , but the price for this simplification is that the potential @xmath203 drops its rational character and becomes a trigonometric or hyperbolic squared tangent function @xmath277 from a practical point of view , this change does not simplify really the problem , since the two new equations @xmath278 with @xmath279 given by @xmath280 are not easier of solving than the original one ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "nevertheless , from a more qualitative viewpoint , the new aspect adopted by this one - dimensional lagrangian is a very interesting fact since the form obtained for the new potential @xmath281 is closely related with the polar coordinate @xmath282 expression for the two - dimensional potential of the harmonic oscillator on two - dimensional spaces of constant curvature , previously studied ( by two of the present authors ) in refs .",
    "@xcite-@xcite .",
    "it is clear from properties ( i ) and ( ii ) that we can conjecture the existence of a direct relationship between this particular nonlinear oscillator and the harmonic oscillator on spaces of constant curvature .",
    "another remarkable property is that the set of integrals of motion ( [ integrals ] ) is analogous to the ones appearing in the @xmath0-dimensional version of the smorodinsky - winternitz system in curved spaces @xcite .",
    "higgs @xcite and leemon @xcite analyzed the characteristics of the two fundamental central potentials , kepler problem and harmonic oscillator , on the @xmath283-dimensional sphere . since then a certain number of authors have studied this question from both the classical and the quantum points of view @xcite-@xcite .",
    "next we recall some of the basic properties of the formalism studied in @xcite-@xcite .",
    "we begin for the following three basic ideas :    * the harmonic oscillator is a system that is well defined in all the three two - dimensional spaces of constant curvature ( sphere @xmath1 , euclidean plane @xmath284 , and hyperbolic plane @xmath2 ) . *",
    "a joint approach , where the usual euclidean system and the two curved systems ( defined on @xmath1 and @xmath2 ) can be studied , all the three , at the same time , is possible using the curvature @xmath285 as a parameter . *",
    "thus the spherical and hyperbolic oscillators can be considered as _ curvature deformations _ of the well known `` flat '' euclidean oscillator which arises as a very particular case of the more general  curved \" systems .",
    "this two last points mean that all the theory must be developed by making use of @xmath285-dependent mathematical expressions leading to general @xmath285-dependent properties .",
    "the specific properties characterizing the harmonic oscillator on the sphere , on the euclidean plane , or on the hyperbolic plane , are then obtained particularizing for @xmath286 , @xmath287 , or @xmath288 . in order to present these expressions in a form which holds simultaneously for any value of @xmath285 , the theory can be developed by making use of the following  tagged \" trigonometric functions",
    "@xmath289 if we make use of this @xmath285-dependent notation in the polar coordinates @xmath282 system , then the differential element of distance , on the three spaces @xmath290 , can be written as follows @xmath291 it reduces to @xmath292 in the three particular cases of the unit sphere , euclidean plane , and ",
    "unit  lobachewski plane .",
    "consequently , the lagrangian for the geodesic ( free ) motion on the spaces @xmath290 is given by the kinetic term arising from the metric @xmath293 and the lagrangian for a general mechanical system ( riemmanian metric minus a potential ) has the following form @xmath294 it is clear that the well known expression for a natural lagrangian on the euclidean plane @xmath295 is obtained as the particular @xmath287 case of @xmath296 .",
    "until now we have considered general aspects of the theory of lagrangian systems on curved spaces .",
    "now let us turn our attention to the spherical and hyperbolic harmonic oscillators ; it is characterized by the following lagrangian with curvature @xmath285 @xmath297 where the @xmath285-dependent tangent @xmath298 is defined in the natural way @xmath299 . in this way , the harmonic oscillator on the unit sphere ( higgs oscillator ) , on the euclidean plane , or on the unit lobachewski plane , arise as the following three particular cases @xmath300 the euclidean oscillator @xmath301 ( parabolic potential without singularities ) appears in this formalism as making a separation between two different situations .",
    "the spherical potential is represented by a well with singularities on the border ( impenetrable walls at the equatorial circle @xmath302 if the potential center is placed at the poles ) , and the hyperbolic potential by a well with finite depth since for @xmath288 , @xmath303 , we have @xmath304 when @xmath305 . actually , the scarf potential @xmath306 , which differs in a constant term from @xmath307 , has been studied in solid state physics and has many interesting properties @xcite-@xcite .",
    "figure iv plots @xmath308 , for the three particular cases of the unit sphere , euclidean plane , and  unit  lobachewski plane ; notice the great resemblance with figure iii .",
    "the abovementioned property ( ii ) , for the @xmath111 case , suggests that the lagrangian ( [ lagrx ] ) and the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) is a nonlinear model for an harmonic oscillator in the circle @xmath309 ( @xmath68 ) or in the hyperbolic line ( @xmath90 ) . in a similar way , if we consider the two properties ( i ) and ( ii )",
    "together , we arrive at the conclusion that this correspondence must also exist for the nonlinear @xmath22 oscillator .",
    "remark that in the @xmath111 case , @xmath309 and @xmath310 must be understood as one - dimensional spaces obtained by endowing each single geodesic of @xmath1 or @xmath2 with the induced metric .",
    "motion on @xmath309 and @xmath310 will correspond to the @xmath311 radial motions on @xmath1 or @xmath2 .",
    "hence , the lagrangian ( [ lagrx ] ) for the equation ( [ eq1 ] ) can be considered as a nonlinear model on the @xmath59-line for the harmonic oscillator on the circle @xmath309 and the hyperbolic line @xmath310 ; the lagrangian @xmath312 of equation ( [ lagt2v2 ] ) as a nonlinear @xmath44model for the harmonic oscillator on the sphere @xmath1 and the hyperbolic plane @xmath2 ; finally , the more general @xmath0dimensional hamiltonian given by equation ( [ hamtnvn ] ) as a nonlinear @xmath313model for the harmonic oscillator on the @xmath0dimensional spaces @xmath314 and @xmath315 .",
    "so we arrive to the conclusion that an harmonic oscillator , that is a linear system , when is defined on a space of constant curvature turns out to be equivalent to a nonlinear oscillator on @xmath59 , @xmath44 or @xmath313 , with the nonlinear parameter @xmath18 playing the role of the ( negative of the ) curvature @xmath285 .",
    "notice that , in dynamical terms , this equivalence is a relation of conjugacy , and also that the existence of this relation can be considered as the origin of the quasi - harmonic behaviour obtained for the solutions of the nonlinear system .",
    "the existence of this relationship makes this nonlinear @xmath44 ( or @xmath313 ) system even more interesting . from an abstract or qualitative viewpoint , the system on the sphere @xmath1 ( or on the hyperbolic space @xmath2 )",
    "may be considered as the more fundamental one ; nevertheless , we have been able to solve the equations and to obtain the explicit solution for the dynamics because we were working with the nonlinear @xmath18-dependent @xmath44model ( or @xmath313model ) .",
    "hence , the nonlinear system studied in this article results to be much more appropriate for the explicit resolution of problems .",
    "we have proved that the lagrangian ( [ lagt2v2 ] ) is the appropriate two - dimensional version of the lagrangian ( [ lagn1 ] ) , ( [ lagrx ] ) , and we have solved the nonlinear equations ( [ eqt2v2 ] ) in the two cases @xmath68 and @xmath90 .",
    "moreover we have proved in sec .",
    "4 that this nonlinear system admits a @xmath0dimensional version given by ( [ lagtnvn ] ) and ( [ hamtnvn ] ) , and we have also solved the correspondent system of @xmath0 equations .    we think that all these results suggest the study of some related questions among them we point out the following : firstly , the poisson brackets of the integrals of motion for the @xmath116dimensional hamiltonian ( [ hamt2v2 ] ) or the @xmath0dimensional hamiltonian ( [ hamtnvn ] ) seems to close a quadratic poisson algebra ( see e.g. ref .",
    "@xcite ) ; this is a very interesting problem that deserves to be studied .",
    "secondly , the geometric relations obtained in the last sec .",
    "5 , is a matter related with the existence of two different but conjugate dynamical systems .",
    "conjugate systems are systems related by diffeomorphisms preserving the fundamental properties ; so it is convenient to develop a deeper analysis of this particular relation of conjugacy existing between the nonlinear @xmath18-dependent oscillator and the harmonic oscillator on the sphere @xmath1 or the hyperbolic plane @xmath2 .",
    "thirdly , it is clear that the calculus are easier of handle when working with the @xmath18-dependent formalism than when working on the constant curvature spaces ; therefore , when looking for new dynamical results on the spaces such as @xmath1 or @xmath2 , a practical strategy will be to first consider the question by using lagrangians such as ( [ lagt2v2 ] ) or ( [ lagtnvn ] ) .",
    "fourthly , in refs . @xcite and",
    "@xcite we have studied not only the central 1:1 oscillator given by the function @xmath316 but also some others non - central non - isotropic oscillators @xmath317 ; it will be convenient to consider these non - central problems also inside this @xmath18-dependent formalism .",
    "finally , we mention the study of the quantized versions of all these nonlinear systems .",
    "notice that , from the quantum point of view , as it is an oscillator with a position - dependent effective mass , there is a problem with the appropriate order for the factors in the kinetic term . we think that all these problems are examples of some open questions that must be investigated .",
