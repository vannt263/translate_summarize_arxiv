    "<S> note that the interaction hamiltonian @xmath42 inherits the pseudospin dependence from @xmath34 and constitutes the interband transition selection rule of fig.[fig1 ] .    </S>",
    "<S> we derive the photocarrier generation rate from the liouville - von - neumann equation@xcite for the density matrix written in the eigenstate basis of @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> the kinetic equation is solved within the duration of the pump pulse @xmath43 , and subsequently in the absence of excitation photons for @xmath44 employing the relaxation time approximation and the solution at @xmath45 as an initial condition , see fig.[fig2]a and appendix . in order to quantify the contribution of the isotropic part of the photocarrier distribution , we assume optical phonon emission as the main mechanism responsible for decay of anisotropy within the first tens fs@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the electrons are relaxing to the bottleneck energy , see fig.[fig2]b , at which further cooling is strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> theory@xcite and thz measurements@xcite suggest that the e - h recombination is a much slower process ( ps time scale@xcite ) , therefore , the photocarrier concentration is assumed constant . </S>",
    "<S> these approximations allow us to write the energy balance equation with only one free parameter , the hot electron temperature , and solve it analytically .    </S>",
    "<S> the absorption coefficient @xmath46 is defined as the ratio of absorbed to incident intensity . in the excited state </S>",
    "<S> we sum @xmath47 and @xmath48 , which describe the absorption due to strongly nonequilibrium carriers and hot electrons , respectively , and @xmath49 denotes the equilibrium value . </S>",
    "<S> these three quantities are given in appendix . </S>",
    "<S> with negligible reflection@xcite , the optical transmissions read @xmath50 and @xmath51 , resulting in a differential transmission @xmath52 . </S>",
    "<S> the differential absorption is : @xmath53 where @xmath54 with @xmath55 the fine structure constant , @xmath56 the radiation frequency , @xmath57 the spectral width of the pulse , @xmath58 the pump fluence , @xmath0 the probe time delay , @xmath59 the pulse duration , and @xmath60 the `` orientational '' relaxation time deduced from fig.[fig3 ] , where the two curves meet at a time delay @xmath450fs . the rate of e - e scattering would increase with @xmath58 and diminish @xmath61 . the hot carrier temperature , @xmath62 , can be estimated as ( see appendix ) : @xmath63 with @xmath64 the riemann zeta - function@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the limit of @xmath65 is excluded in our model as we assume a system with linear response in @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath62 can not be defined until a significant fraction of the strongly nonequilibrium carriers relaxes to the hot fermi - dirac distribution@xcite , i.e. eqs . [ main],[th ] are not valid at @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> eq.[main ] does not formally vanish for @xmath67 , because we do not take into account the energy dissipation at such a long time scale . </S>",
    "<S> within the temporal constraints of the model , the description of processes occurring at @xmath68 is limited . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , the slight delay in the maximum of the pump - probe signal , as shown in the inset of fig.[fig2 ] , can not be reproduced by eq.([main ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this does not hinder the description of the isotropization dynamics , experimentally seen over 50fs .    </S>",
    "<S> eq.([main ] ) predicts a relative differential transmission@xmath69-@xmath70 at pump fluences between @xmath71 and @xmath72 , in agreement with the measurements in fig.[fig3 ] . </S>",
    "<S> we also evaluate the ratio between differential transmissions for parallel and perpendicular polarizations , and plot this as a function of pump fluence in fig.[fig4 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio decreases at higher fluences because the relative contribution of the polarization - dependent term in eq.([main ] ) is strongly suppressed at higher @xmath62 , making the overall expression less sensitive to @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> physically , the higher excitation density delivers more heat to the isotropic fermi sea , whose contribution suppressed the strongly nonequilibrium anisotropic component .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusions _ we employed fluence - dependent and polarization - resolved optical pump - probe spectroscopy to resolve and explore the dominating relaxation mechanism for photocarriers in graphene at ultra - short times scales . </S>",
    "<S> we found that optical phonon emission , rather than e - e scattering , is responsible for momentum isotropization and pseudospin relaxation in the non - equilibrium photocarrier occupation , while the initial photocarrier redistribution along the dirac cone in a timescale of tens fs is due to e - e scattering . </S>",
    "<S> we provided an analytical framework for the qualitative understanding of the carrier dynamics . </S>",
    "<S> ref.@xcite suggested that the light generated anisotropic distribution of carriers in momentum space can be observed in electrical measurements despite their relaxation on ultra - fast time scales , as recently reported in ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our model explains why it is possible : the continuous wave laser in ref.@xcite results in low photocarrier densities and strong anisotropy , allowing the pseudospin - polarized photocarriers to be detected in graphene pn - junctions@xcite . </S>",
