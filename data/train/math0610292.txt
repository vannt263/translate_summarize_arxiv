    "in @xcite , m. kontsevich constructed universal characteristic classes of smooth framed @xmath0-bundles with fiber an odd dimensional integral homology sphere @xmath0 .",
    "the construction of the kontsevich classes involves the graph complex and configuration space integrals ( see @xcite or  [ ss : kon - cc ] for the definition ) . in the case of 3-dimensional homology spheres ,",
    "the kontsevich classes are 0-forms , i.e. , real valued diffeomorphism invariants , and it is shown in @xcite that all the ohtsuki finite type invariants ( @xcite ) are recovered in this way .",
    "it is also known that there are very many ohtsuki finite type invariants , hence the kontsevich classes for 3-dimensional homology spheres are very strong .    in the present paper ,",
    "we study the kontsevich classes for higher odd - dimensional homology spheres .",
    "in particular , we get some results for 5- and 7-dimensional homology spheres . there are roughly two parts in the present paper , each of which can be read almost separately .    first , the kontsevich classes are the characteristic classes for smooth ` framed ' @xmath0-bundles .",
    "let @xmath2 denote @xmath0 with a puncture at a fixed point @xmath3 . by a framing on an @xmath0-bundle",
    ", we mean a trivialization of @xmath4 along each fiber that is standard near @xmath5 , namely it looks near @xmath5 like the standard euclidean plane which may be identified as @xmath6 . in the case of 5-dimensional homology spheres",
    ", we study in  [ ss : bordism - inv ] the framing dependence of the simplest kontsevich class associated to the @xmath7-graph , which is a 2-form on the base space , and we obtain a bordism invariant of unframed @xmath0-bundles by adding a certain multiple of the second signature defect invariant of hirzebruch ( theorem  [ thm : a ] ) . as a corollary , it follows that the simplest kontsevich class , as a characteristic class for framed bundles , is non - trivial .",
    "our formula for the bordism invariant is in some sense a higher dimensional analogue of morita s formula for the casson invariant in @xcite .",
    "second , in the case of 7-dimensional homology spheres , we construct in  [ ss : clasper - bundles ] a family of framed @xmath0-bundles , which we call graph clasper - bundles , by using higher dimensional claspers .",
    "higher dimensional claspers are introduced in @xcite as higher dimensional generalizations of habiro s claspers in 3-dimension @xcite . instead of the borromean rings in habiro s graph claspers , we use a ` suspension ' of the higher dimensional borromean rings .",
    "then we show that our construction is in some sense dual to the kontsevich classes ( theorem  [ thm : b ] ) .",
    "proof of theorem  [ thm : b ] is inspired by kuperberg - thurston s proof of the universality of their version of kontsevich s perturbative invariant @xcite and somewhat philosophically by cattaneo ",
    "cotta - ramusino  longoni@xcite . as a consequence of theorem  [ thm : b",
    "] , it turns out that the kontsevich classes are highly non - trivial and that there are as many kontsevich classes as the ohtsuki finite type invariants , for any fixed 7-dimensional homology spheres .",
    "this already implies that there are a lot of smooth framed bundles , and that clasper - bundle surgery can be used effectively to produce a lot of bundles similarly as the case of 3-dimensional homology sphere , while usual surgery along framed links in a higher dimensional manifold seems not so effective unless the manifold is nilpotent @xcite .",
    "also , our construction gives some linearly independent elements of the homotopy groups @xmath8 of the base of the universal @xmath9-bundle , thus we obtain new non - trivial estimates for the rational homotopy groups @xmath10 of the infinite dimensional lie group @xmath11 , the group of diffeomorphisms .",
    "this is in some sense unstable informations . by the way , in the stable range ,",
    "the isomorphism @xmath12 has been given by farrell - hsiang @xcite .",
    "in  [ s : directions ] , we will remark some future directions . we think that the study of cohomology classes of the space of certain link embeddings is a higher dimensional generalization of the study of link invariants in a 3-manifold .",
    "similarly , we think that the study of universal characteristic classes is a higher dimensional generalization of the study of invariants of 3-manifolds .",
    "we expect that there is a rich theory for smooth bundles as in the theory of ohtsuki s finite type invariants of homology 3-spheres and that clasper - bundle surgery gives an important correspondence between the two .",
    "here we briefly review the definition of kontsevich s universal characteristic classes .",
    "first we define the space @xmath13 of trivalent graphs .",
    "an _ orientation _ on a trivalent graph @xmath14 is a choice of an ordering of three edges incident to each trivalent vertex , considered modulo even number of swappings of the orders .",
    "we present the orientation in plane diagrams by assuming that the order of three edges incident to each trivalent vertex is given by anti - clockwise order .",
    "let @xmath15 be the real vector space spanned by all connected trivalent graphs with oriented @xmath16 vertices .",
    "let @xmath13 be the quotient space of @xmath15 by the subspace spanned by the vectors of the following form : @xmath17[cc]{$-$ } \\psfrag{+}[cc][cc]{$+$ } { \\raisebox{-0.5\\height }                   { \\includegraphics{ihx.eps } }          } \\ ] ] we call the vectors in ( [ eq : ihx ] ) _ ihx _ and _ as relations _ respectively .",
    "we will write as @xmath18 $ ] the element of @xmath13 represented by a graph @xmath19 .",
    "the _ degree _ of a trivalent graph is defined as the number of vertices .",
    "for example , @xmath20\\}$ ] , where @xmath21 $ ] is the @xmath7-graph .",
    "let @xmath0 be an @xmath22-dimensional homology sphere with a fixed point @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath23 be the fulton - macpherson - kontsevich compactification ( @xcite ) of the configuration space @xmath24 here we include in the diagonals the set of configurations with some points go infinity .",
    "for example , @xmath25 is obtained from @xmath26 by blowing up first along @xmath27 and then along the disjoint diagonals @xmath28 neighborhood in @xmath25 of the face of @xmath29 corresponding to @xmath30 is the same form as a neighborhood of the face of @xmath31 corresponding to @xmath32 , and there exists the gauss map @xmath33 from the @xmath34-face of @xmath31 to @xmath35 , given by the unit relative vector in @xmath36 .",
    "so the gauss map @xmath37 from the @xmath34-face of @xmath29 to @xmath35 is defined as @xmath33 . moreover , the union of the faces corresponding to the above three diagonals is naturally a trivial @xmath35-bundle .",
    "one obtains a map @xmath38 given by the projection onto the @xmath35-factor .",
    "it is determined by the framing . therefore a continuous map @xmath39 is defined .",
    "it is known that @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the @xmath42-invariant unit volume form on @xmath35 , extends to a closed @xmath43-form @xmath44 on @xmath25 and it generates @xmath45 @xcite .",

    "we will call such a trivialization a _",

    "<S> m. kontsevich constructed universal characteristic classes of smooth bundles with fiber a framed odd - dimensional integral homology sphere . in dimension 3 , they are known to give a universal finite type invariants of homology 3-spheres . </S>",
    "<S> however , they have not been well understood for higher fiber dimensions . </S>",
    "<S> the purpose of the present paper is twofold . </S>",
    "<S> first , we obtain a bordism invariant of smooth unframed bundles with fiber a 5-dimensional homology sphere , which is defined as a sum of the simplest kontsevich class and the second signature defect . </S>",
    "<S> it may be in some sense a higher dimensional analogue of the casson invariant . </S>",
    "<S> second , we construct a family of @xmath0-bundles . by evaluating on those @xmath0-bundles , </S>",
    "<S> we show that kontsevich s universal characteristic classes are highly non - trivial in the case of fiber dimension 7 . as a corollary , new estimates for unstable rational homotopy groups of @xmath1 </S>",
    "<S> are obtained . </S>"
