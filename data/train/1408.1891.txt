    "the physics of one - dimensional ( 1d ) systems is strongly influenced by electronic correlations .",
    "e.g. , the low - energy behavior of a large class of 1d models is not described by a fermi liquid but exhibits bosonic excitations .",
    "thermodynamic properties or equilibrium correlation functions of this so - called luttinger liquid can be obtained elegantly using field theory .",
    "transport properties , however , are usually not governed by the low - energy luttinger liquid fixed point but by an interplay between dangerously irrelevant operators scattering the currents and conserved quantities protecting them.@xcite in order to connect to actual experimental transport measurements on ( quasi ) 1d systems such as carbon nanotubes or strongly anisotropic 3d materials , it is thus essential to study generic microscopic models .",
    "the hubbard model@xcite plays a fundamental role in the physics of correlated electrons as it provides the most transparent realization of mott physics : it describes spinful electrons moving on a lattice with on - site interaction . from an experimental perspective",
    ", the hubbard model has been employed to describe a wide variety of crystals ( both insulating and conducting ) ; in one dimension , it is also used as a starting point for polymers . despite the hubbard model s apparent simplicity and the existence of an exact solution for its thermodynamics in 1d ,",
    "little is known about its transport properties . above one dimension",
    "even the phase diagram of the hubbard model with doping is a matter of debate , including the regime of greatest interest where charged excitations are gapped while the neutral sector includes gapless spin excitations .    from a theoretical perspective ,",
    "it is less demanding ( both computationally and analytically ) to study a _ spinless _ fermion model with nearest - neighbor interactions , which has therefore been investigated extensively despite the fact that it is of less relevance for experimental setups .",
    "even though the model ( which can be mapped to a xxz spin chain via a jordan - wigner transformation ) allows for a bethe ansatz solution which is ` simpler ' than that of the hubbard model , extracting transport coefficients , which are determined by couplings between all excitations , remains a formidable task . over the last decades a significant number of works@xcite investigated the equilibrium transport properties of the xxz chain , but it was only recently proven rigorously@xcite that the half - filled system can support dissipationless currents at finite temperature @xmath1 ; this corresponds to a finite drude contribution to the conductivity @xmath2 numerical values for the drude weight @xmath3 can be obtained , e.g. , via the density matrix renormalization group.@xcite    it is the main goal of this paper to investigate finite - temperature linear - response transport properties of the hubbard model , about which comparably little is known ( we will give a more detailed overview of previous works in sec .  [ sec : dw ] ) .",
    "in particular , we employ the density matrix renormalization group@xcite to compute real time charge- and spin current correlation functions whose fourier transform determines @xmath4 .",
    "our focus is two - fold : first , we demonstrate that the charge current correlators at half filling decay rapidly , suggesting that the charge drude weight @xmath5 is either zero or very small at any finite temperature ( @xmath5 is known to vanish at @xmath6 ) .",
    "second , we study the optical conductivity @xmath0 in presence of small next - nearest neighbor interactions which break integrability@xcite  and thus eliminate a potentially small , finite drude weight  but do not trigger a phase transition.@xcite as the temperature is lowered below the charge gap , @xmath0 successively develops a sharp increase at the optical absorption threshold .",
    "more importantly , the dc conductivity @xmath7 is finite and diverges approximately as @xmath8 ( our data is insufficient to rule out a weakly @xmath9-dependent prefactor ) .",
    "this analysis suggests that the half - filled , gapped hubbard model is a normal charge conductor at finite temperatures . as a testbed for our numerics",

    "second , we ` exploit time translation invariance',@xcite rewrite @xmath46 , and carry out two independent calculations for @xmath47 as well as @xmath48 .",

    "however , this calculation is very involved : two different ways@xcite to approximately solve the bethe ansatz equations for the xxz chain yield results which disagree , and one might expect the situation for the hubbard model to be similarly subtle . while quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) numerics@xcite and an analysis of low - energy excitations@xcite support a finite drude weight , exact diagonalization ( ed ) data,@xcite large-@xmath71 analytics,@xcite and symmetry",
    "arguments@xcite seems to favor @xmath72 .",
    "non - equilibrium dmrg calculations ( at @xmath10 only ) suggest a zero drude weight but a finite diffusion constant @xmath73.@xcite the situation for the hubbard model is thus completely analogous to the gapless xxz chain where  after decades of dispute  it was only recently shown rigorously that the drude weight at half filling and @xmath74 is nonzero at finite @xmath9.@xcite    the controversial status of the drude weight of the half - filled hubbard model requires further work in this direction .",
    "the dmrg allows to obtain results directly on the real time axis ( in contrast to qmc ) , and the thermodynamic limit can be accessed easily ( in contrast to ed ) .",

    "such a divergence is consistent with a semiclassical analysis by damle and sachdev@xcite who show that below the gap an exponentially small quasiparticle density is compensated by an exponentially long life time ; for a model with spin-@xmath87 symmetry ; this yields @xmath88 .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge this picture was never confirmed conclusively for a microscopic model and all temperatures ranging from @xmath83 to @xmath84 .",
    "previous studies of the diffusion constant , which is related to @xmath89 via an einstein relation , can be found in refs .   for @xmath10 as well as in refs .   for finite but large ( compared to the gap ) temperatures . finally , we show the full frequency - dependent ac conductivity in fig .

    "moreover , the missing contribution from larger times can be estimated by carrying out calculations with bigger discarded weights ( which trades accuracy of the real - time data for reaching longer time scales ) or by employing extrapolation schemes such as linear prediction ( see refs .   for details ) .",
