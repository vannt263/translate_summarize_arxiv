    "the purpose of this paper is to outline the fundamental role the mittag - leffler function in renewal processes that are relevant in the theories of anomalous diffusion . as a matter of fact the interest in this function in statistical physics and probability theory",
    "has recently increased as is shown by the large number of papers published since 1990 of which a brief ( incomplete ) bibliography includes . in this paper",
    "we develop a theory for long - time behaviour of a renewal process with a generic power law waiting distribution of order @xmath1 , @xmath2 ( thereby for easy readability dispensing with decoration by a slowly varying function ) . to bring the distant future into near sight we change the unit of time from @xmath3 to @xmath4 , @xmath5 . for the random waiting times",
    "@xmath6 this means replacing @xmath6 by @xmath7 .",
    "then , having very many events in a moderate span of time we compensate this compression by respeeding the whole process , actually slowing it down so that again we have a moderate number of events in a moderate span of time .",
    "we will relate the rescaling factor @xmath8 and the respeeding factor @xmath9 in such a way that in the limit @xmath10 we have a reasonable process , namely one whose waiting time distribution is the mittag - leffler waiting time distribution whose density is @xmath11 with the mittag - leffler function @xmath12 we will call the renewal process with waiting time density @xmath13 the _ mittag - leffler ( renewal ) process_. this process can be seen as a fractional generalization of the poisson process , see @xcite .",
    "our method is , in some sense , analogous to the one applied in the sixties of the past century by gnedenko and kovalenko @xcite in their analysis of _ thinning _ ( or _ rarefaction _ ) of a renewal process .",
    "they found , under certain power law assumptions , in the infinite thinning limit , for the waiting time density the laplace transform @xmath14 but did not identify it as a mittag - leffler type function . in section 2 ,",
    "we provide , in our notation , an outline of the thinning theory for renewal processes essentially following gnedenko and kovalenko .",
    "their method has inspired us for the reatment of our problems . as we consider our renewal process formally as a _ continuous time random",
    "walk _ ( ctrw ) with constant non - random jumps 1 in space ( for the counting function @xmath15 , in section 3 we embed ab initio our theory into that of the ctrw , thus being in the position to treat the theory of a time fractional ctrw as limiting case of a ctrw with power law waiting time distribution . in this context",
    "the pioneering paper by balakrishnan @xcite of 1985 deserves to be mentioned .",
    "balakrishnan already found the importance of the laplace transform @xmath16 in the time fractional ctrw and time fractional diffusion , but also did not identify it as the laplace transform of @xmath13 .",
    "then , in 1995 hilfer and anton @xcite , see also @xcite , showed that this waiting time density is characteristic for the time fractional ctrw and can be expressed in terms of the mittag - leffler function in two parameters , that is @xmath17 with the generalized mittag - leffler function @xmath18 the form ( 1.3 ) is equivalent to the form ( 1.1 ) that we prefer as it exhibits visibly also the cumulative probability function , the _ survival function _",
    ", @xmath19 .",
    "we explain in section 4 two manipulations , _ rescaling _ and _ respeeding _ and use these in section 5 to deduce the asymptotic universality of the mittag - leffler waiting time density under a power law assumption for the original waiting time .",
    "then , in section 6 , assuming a suitable power law also for the spatial jumps we show that by a rescaling of the jump widths by a positive factor @xmath20 ( that means a change of the unit of space from 1 to @xmath21 to bring into near sight the far - away space ) another respeeding is effected , now an acceleration , that in the limit @xmath22 ( under a proper relation between @xmath20 and @xmath8 ) leads to space - time fractional diffusion . in section 7",
    ", we pass to a properly scaled limit for the counting function @xmath15 of a renewal process ( again under power law assumption ) and obtain the time fractional drift process ( viewing @xmath15 as a spatial variable ) .",
    "we will extensively work with the transforms of laplace and fourier , so easing calculations and proofs of _ convergence in distribution _ ( also called  weak convergence \" ) for our passages to the limit .",
    "essentially , we treat in this paper three topics .",
    "first , in section 2 , the thinning of a pure renewal process .",
    "second , in sections 3 - 6 , under power law assumption for the waiting time , the asymptotic relevance of the mittag - leffler law , and then the general ctrw with special attention to space and time transition limits to fractional diffusion . as a third topic , in section 7",
    ", we investigate the long time behaviour of the mittag - leffler renewal process .",
    "essential properties of the derivative of fractional order in time and in space are given in appendix a and appendix b , respectively .",
    "finally , in appendix c we give details on the two special functions of the mittag - leffler type that play a fundamental role in this paper , the mittag - leffler survival probability and the mittag - leffler waiting time density .",
    "the _ thinning _ theory for a renewal process has been considered in detail by gnedenko and kovalenko @xcite .",
    "we must note that other authors , like szntai @xcite speak of _ rarefaction _ in place of thinning .",
    "let us sketch here the essentials of this theory : in the interest of transparency and easy readability we avoid the possible decoration of the relevant power law by multiplying it with a _ slowly varying function_. as usual we call a ( measurable ) positive function @xmath23 _ slowly varying at zero _ if @xmath24 with @xmath25 for every @xmath26 , _ slowly varying at infinity _ if @xmath24 with @xmath27 for every @xmath26 .",
    "a standard example of a slowly varying function at zero and at infinity is @xmath28 , with @xmath29 .",
    "denoting by @xmath30 , @xmath31 the time instants of events of a renewal process , assuming @xmath32 , with @xmath33 waiting times @xmath34 for @xmath35 , ( generically denoted by t ) , _ thinning _ ( or _ rarefaction _ ) means that for each positive index @xmath36 a decision is made : the event happening in the instant @xmath37 is deleted with probability @xmath38 or it is maintained with probability @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "this procedure produces a _ thinned _ or _ rarefied _ renewal process with fewer events ( very few events if @xmath41 is near zero , the case of particular interest ) in a moderate span of time . to compensate for this loss we change the unit of time so that we still have not very few but still a moderate number of events in a moderate span of time",
    "such change of the unit of time is equivalent to rescaling the waiting time , multiplying it with a positive factor @xmath8 so that we have waiting times @xmath42 , and instants @xmath43 , in the rescaled process .",
    "our intention is , vaguely speaking , to dispose on @xmath8 in relation to the rarefaction parameter @xmath41 in such a way that for @xmath41 near zero in some sense the  average \" number of events per unit of time remains unchanged . in an asymptotic sense",
    "we will make these considerations precise . denoting by @xmath44 the probability distribution function of the ( original ) waiting time @xmath6 , by @xmath45 its density ( @xmath45 is a generalized function generating a probability measure ) so that @xmath46 , and analogously by @xmath47 and @xmath48(t ) the distribution and density , respectively , of the sum of @xmath36 waiting times , we have recursively @xmath49 observing that after a maintained event the next one of the original process is kept with probability @xmath41 but dropped in favour of the second - next with probability @xmath50 and , generally , @xmath51 events are dropped in favour of the @xmath52-th - next with probability @xmath53 , we get for the waiting time density of the thinned process the formula @xmath54 with the modified waiting time @xmath55 we have @xmath56 hence the density @xmath57 , and analogously for the density of the sum of @xmath52 waiting times @xmath58 .",
    "the density of the waiting time of the rescaled ( and thinned ) process now turns out as @xmath59 in the laplace domain we have @xmath60 hence ( using @xmath61 ) @xmath62 from which by laplace inversion we can , in principle , construct the waiting time density of the thinned process . by rescaling we get @xmath63 being interested in stronger and stronger thinning ( _ infinite thinning _ )",
    "let us now consider a scale of processes with the parameters @xmath64 ( of _ rescaling _ ) and @xmath41 ( of _ thinning _ ) , with @xmath41 tending to zero _ under a scaling relation @xmath65 yet to be specified_. we have essentially two cases for the waiting time distribution : its expectation value is finite or infinite . in the first case we put @xmath66 in the second case",
    "we assume a queue of power law type ( dispensing with a possible decoration by a function slowly varying at infinity ) @xmath67 then , by the karamata theory ( see @xcite ) the above conditions mean in the laplace domain @xmath68 with a positive coefficient @xmath69 and @xmath2 .",
    "the case @xmath70 obviously corresponds to the situation with finite first moment ( 2.6a ) , whereas the case @xmath71 is related to a power law queue with @xmath72 now , passing to the limit of @xmath73 of infinite thinning under the scaling relation @xmath74 between the positive parameters @xmath41 and @xmath8 , the laplace transform of the rescaled density @xmath75 in ( 2.5 ) of the thinned process tends for fixed @xmath76 to @xmath77 which corresponds to the mittag - leffler density @xmath78 let us remark that gnedenko and kovalenko obtained ( 2.9 ) as the laplace transform of the limiting density but did not identify it as the laplace transform of a mittag - leffler type function . observe that in the special case @xmath79 we have @xmath80 , hence as the limiting process the poisson process , as formerly shown in 1956 by rnyi @xcite .",
    "the name _ continuous time random walk _ ( ctrw ) became popular in physics after montroll , weiss and scher ( just to cite the pioneers ) in the 1960 s and 1970 s published a celebrated series of papers on random walks for modelling diffusion processes on lattices , see @xcite , and the book by weiss @xcite with references therein .",
    "ctrws are rather good and general phenomenological models for diffusion , including processes of anomalous transport , that can be understood in the framework of the classical renewal theory , as stated in the booklet by cox @xcite .",
    "in fact a ctrw can be considered as a compound renewal process ( a simple renewal process with reward ) or a random walk _ subordinated _ to a simple renewal process .",
    "a spatially one - dimensional ctrw is generated by a sequence of independent identically distributed ( @xmath81 ) positive random waiting times @xmath82 each having the same probability density function @xmath83 @xmath84 and a sequence of @xmath81 random jumps @xmath85 in @xmath86 each having the same probability density @xmath87 @xmath88 let us remark that , for ease of language , we use the word density also for generalized functions in the sense of gelfand & shilov @xcite , that can be interpreted as probability measures .",
    "usually the _ probability density functions _ are abbreviated by @xmath89 .",
    "we recall that @xmath90 with @xmath91 and @xmath92 with @xmath93 . setting @xmath94 @xmath95 for @xmath96",
    "the wandering particle makes a jump of length @xmath97 in instant @xmath30 , so that its position is @xmath98 for @xmath99 and @xmath100 for @xmath101 we require the distribution of the waiting times and that of the jumps to be independent of each other .",
    "so , we have a compound renewal process ( a renewal process with reward ) , compare @xcite . by natural probabilistic arguments we arrive at the _ integral equation _ for",
    "the probability density @xmath102 ( a density with respect to the variable @xmath103 ) of the particle being in point @xmath103 at instant @xmath104 see @xcite , @xmath105\\,dt'\\ , , \\eqno(3.1)\\ ] ] in which the _ survival function _",
    "@xmath106 denotes the probability that at instant @xmath107 the particle is still sitting in its starting position @xmath108 clearly , ( 3.1 ) satisfies the initial condition @xmath109 .",

    "although so named it must not be confused with our _ mittag - leffler waiting time distribution _ whose density is given by ( 1.1 ) .",
    "the basic role of the mittag - leffler waiting time probability density in time fractional continuous time random walk ( ctrw ) has become well known by the fundamental paper of 1995 by hilfer and anton @xcite .",

    "likewise one arrives at this law when wanting to construct a certain special class of anomalous random walks , see the 1985 paper by balakrishnan @xcite , the anomaly defined by growth of the second moment of the sojourn probability density like a power of time with exponent between 0 and 1 .",
    "balakrishnan s paper , having appeared a few years before the fundamental paper of 1989 by schneider and wyss @xcite , is difficult to read as it is written in a style different from the present one , so we will here not go into details . but",
    "let it be said that by well - scaled passage to the limit from ctrw ( again under suitable power law assumptions in space and time ) he obtained the space - time fractional diffusion equation in form of an equivalent integro - differential equation .",

    "however , due to the sad fact that the mittag - leffler function too long played a rather neglected role in treatises on special functions balakrishnan as well as gnedenko and kovalenko contented themselves with presenting their results only in the laplace transform domain ; they did not identify their limit density as a mittag - leffler type function .",
    "having worked ourselves for some time on questions of well - scaled passage to the diffusion limit from continuous time random walks to fractional diffusion , see @xcite , we got from the theory of thinning the idea that it should be possible to carry out the passages to the limit separately in space and in time . in time",
    "this can be done by a combination of re - scaling time and respeeding the underlying renewal process ( formally treating it as a ctrw with unit steps in space ) .",
    "in fact , _ thinning _ in the sense of gnedenko and kovalenko transforms the original renewal process into one that is running more slowly and this effect can be balanced by proper choice of the rescaling factor .",
    "the result of our combination of rescaling and respeeding for a ctrw governed by a given renewal process with a generic power law waiting time law is a time fractional ctrw . by another rescaling in space ( now under power law assumption for the jumps ) which can be interpreted as a second respeeding we arrive at the already classical space - time fractional diffusion equation . in this way we shed new light on the long time and wide space behaviour of continuous time",
    "random walks . in a series of comments at the end of section 6 ,",
    "we have explained how , by what we call _ well - scaled _ passage to the diffusion limit , the transition from the ctrw to the space - time fractional diffusion process actually can be obtained by merely rescaling time and space without any respeeding at all . however ,",
    "the separate passages to the limit are more satisfying with respect to mathematical rigour . finally , in section 7",
    ", we have treated the time fractional drift process as a properly scaled limit of the counting function of a pure renewal process governed by a waiting time law of mittag - leffler type .",
    "our trick in finding the limiting waiting time law of this renewal process consists in treating it as a ctrw with positive jumps of size @xmath3 so that its counting number acts as a spatial variable",

    "<S> \" space can be interpreted as a second kind of  respeeding \" which then , again under a proper relation between the relevant parameters leads in the limit to the space - time fractional diffusion equation . </S>",
