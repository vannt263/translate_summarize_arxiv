    "the concept of the stone - ech compactification of a semigroup has become one of central importance , and has been studied extensively . throughout this paper , we think of the stone - ech compactification of a discrete abelian semigroup @xmath0 as the set @xmath1 of ultrafilters on @xmath0 , where the point @xmath2 is identified with the principal ultrafilter @xmath3 , and the basic open sets are those of the form @xmath4 , for @xmath5 .",
    "then these sets are actually clopen , and @xmath6 is really the closure in @xmath1 of the set @xmath7 , regarded as a subset of @xmath1 under the aforementioned identification of points in @xmath0 with principal ultrafilters . the semigroup operation @xmath8 on @xmath0 is also extended by the formula @xmath9 which turns @xmath1 into a right topological semigroup , meaning that for each @xmath10 the mapping @xmath11 is continuous ( note that the extended operation @xmath8 need not be commutative , and , even if @xmath0 is a group , elements @xmath12 do not necessarily have inverses ) .",
    "the details of this construction ( as well as a lot more information , along with applications ) can be seen in @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we will focus mainly on the case when @xmath0 is a group .",
    "the lowercase roman letters @xmath13 are reserved for ultrafilters , while the uppercase roman letters @xmath14 , with or without subscripts , will always denote subsets of the abelian group at hand .",
    "we will use the von neumann natural numbers , i.e. , a natural number @xmath15 is viewed as the set @xmath16 ( with @xmath17 equal to @xmath18 , the empty set ) ; and @xmath19 will denote the set of finite ordinals , i.e. the set of natural numbers along with zero ( thus the symbols @xmath20 and @xmath21 mean the same when applied to natural numbers , @xmath17 , and to @xmath19 itself ) .",
    "the lowercase roman letters @xmath22 , with or without subscript , will be reserved to denote elements of @xmath19 .",
    "the lowercase roman letters @xmath23 , with or without subscript , will stand for elements of @xmath24^{<\\omega}$ ] , i.e. for finite subsets of @xmath19 .",
    "the letters @xmath25 and @xmath26 , with or without subscripts , will in general be reserved for denoting ( finite or infinite ) subsets of @xmath19 .",
    "given a subset @xmath27 , @xmath28^{<\\omega}$ ] will denote the set of finite subsets of @xmath25 , and @xmath28^{\\omega}$ ] denotes the set of infinite subsets of @xmath25 . of the groups that we study here ,",
    "one of the most important ones is the circle group @xmath29 .",
    "when dealing with this group , we will identify its elements ( which are cosets modulo @xmath30 ) with their unique representative @xmath31 satisfying @xmath32 .",
    "therefore , when we refer to an element of @xmath33 as a real number in @xmath34 , we really mean the coset of that number modulo @xmath30 .",
    "if @xmath0 is an abelian semigroup , we say that an ultrafilter @xmath10 is * strongly summable * if it has a base of @xmath35-sets , i.e. if for every @xmath36 there exists a sequence @xmath37 such that @xmath38 , where @xmath39^{<\\omega}\\setminus\\{\\varnothing\\}\\right\\}\\ ] ] denotes the _ set of finite sums of the sequence @xmath40_.    note that if a strongly summable ultrafilter is principal , then it must actually be @xmath17 .",
    "strongly summable ultrafilters on @xmath41 were first constructed , under @xmath42 , by neil hindman in @xcite , although at that time the terminology was still not in use .",
    "their importance at first came from the fact that they are examples of idempotents in @xmath43 , but among idempotents they are special in that the largest subgroup of @xmath44 containing one of them as the identity is just a copy of @xmath30 .",
    "more concretely , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th . 12.42 )",
    "establishes that if @xmath45 is a strongly summable ultrafilter , and @xmath46 are such that @xmath47 , then @xmath48 . in @xcite ,",
    "the authors generalize some results previously only known to hold for ultrafilters on @xmath43 or @xmath49 .",
    "in particular , they proved there that every strongly summable ultrafilter @xmath50 on any abelian group @xmath0 is an idempotent ( ( * ? ? ? * th .",
    "2.3 ) ) . and",
    "4.6 ) states that if @xmath0 can be embedded in @xmath33 , then whenever @xmath51 are such that @xmath47 , it must be the case that @xmath52 .",
    "it is possible to get a slightly stronger result if one strengthens the definition of strongly summable .",
    "an ultrafilter @xmath10 is * sparse * if for every @xmath36 there exist two sequences @xmath37 , @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a subsequence of @xmath40 such that @xmath55 is infinite , @xmath56 , and @xmath57 .",
    "then obviously every sparse ultrafilter will be nonprincipal and strongly summable . and",
    "( ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.5 ) ) if @xmath0 can be embedded in @xmath33 and @xmath58 is sparse , then whenever @xmath59 are such that @xmath60 , it must be the case that @xmath52 .    in @xcite ,",
    "the authors investigate the different kinds of abelian semigroups on which every nonprincipal strongly summable ultrafilter must be sparse .",
    "for example , every nonprincipal strongly summable ultrafilter @xmath45 must actually be sparse ( this follows from ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.2 ) together with either ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemmas 12.20 , 12.32 ) or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* lemmas 1a , 1c ) ) .",
    "thus the above result about @xmath50 being expressible as a sum only trivially holds for all nonprincipal strongly summable ultrafilters on @xmath19 . more generally , ( * ? ? ?",
    "4.2 ) establishes that if @xmath61 is a countable subsemigroup of @xmath33 , then every nonprincipal strongly summable ultrafilter on @xmath61 is sparse .",
    "after , they build on this to prove a more general result .",
    "let @xmath61 be a countable subsemigroup of @xmath62 and let @xmath50 be a nonprincipal strongly summable ultrafilter on @xmath61 . if @xmath63 then @xmath50 must be sparse ( here @xmath64 denotes the least @xmath65 such that @xmath66 is nonzero ) .",
    "so , for example , this theorem , as well as the method for proving it , can not be applied if @xmath50 contains the set of @xmath67 all of whose nonzero entries equal @xmath68 .",
    "this set is isomorphic to the countably infinite boolean group @xmath69 . while @xcite was still a preprint , it contained the question of whether it is consistent with @xmath70 that there exists a nonprincipal nonsparse strongly summable ultrafilter on @xmath69 .",
    "this question is answered in the negative in section 2 , while section 3 gives a slight improvement of ( * ? ? ?",
    "by the boolean group we mean the unique ( up to isomorphism ) countably infinite group all of whose nonidentity elements have order @xmath71 .",
    "this group is usually thought of as the direct sum of countably many copies of @xmath72 .",
    "however , we will think of it as the group whose underlying set is @xmath24^{<\\omega}$ ] , equipped with the symmetric difference @xmath73 as the group operation . for @xmath74",
    ", we can define the support of @xmath75 by @xmath76 so that the mapping @xmath77 is an isomorphism from @xmath69 onto @xmath24^{<\\omega}$ ] .    when dealing with @xmath35-sets on this group , we will talk about sets instead of sequences .",
    "thus , if @xmath37 is a sequence of elements of @xmath24^{<\\omega}$ ] , and @xmath78 is the range of that sequence , then instead of @xmath79 we will write @xmath80 , the set of `` finite symmetric differences '' , in order to emphasize that the elements of our group are sets and that their `` sum '' actually corresponds to taking symmetric differences , and using the fact that , even if the sequence @xmath40 is not injective , that does not alter the resulting @xmath35-set .",
    "this means that , for example , if @xmath81 , and @xmath82 for @xmath83 , then @xmath84 , due to the fact that every element of our group at hand has order @xmath71 .",
    "we will use the uppercase roman letters @xmath85 to denote infinite subsets of @xmath24^{<\\omega}$ ] whenever we are interested in considering their sets of finite symmetric differences .",
    "the main result of this section , and of this paper , is the following theorem .",
    "[ teorema ] let @xmath50 be a nonprincipal strongly summable ultrafilter on @xmath24^{<\\omega}$ ] .",
    "then , @xmath50 is sparse .    in order to prove this result ,",
    "we need first of all a lemma which tells us that weakly summable ultrafilters in @xmath24^{<\\omega}$ ] have a property that is somewhat analogous to that of extending the frchet filter . recall that an ultrafilter @xmath50 on an abelian semigroup @xmath0 is * weakly summable * if for every @xmath36 there is a sequence @xmath40 of elements of @xmath0 such that @xmath56 .",
    "thus every strongly summable ultrafilter is weakly summable , and actually ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th . 12.17 ) ) every idempotent ultrafilter on an arbitrary semigroup is weakly summable ( and in fact ( * ? ? ?",
    "12.17 ) an ultrafilter is weakly summable if and only if it is a closure point in @xmath1 of the set of idempotents ) .",
    "notice that a principal weakly summable ultrafilter must be idempotent , in particular if @xmath0 is a group then the only principal weakly summable ultrafilter is the one that corresponds to the identity element .",

    "there is @xmath91 such that @xmath92 .",
    "but @xmath93 can not equal @xmath94 , for otherwise , since @xmath50 is weakly summable , there would be an infinite set @xmath95^{<\\omega}$ ] such that @xmath96 , so if @xmath97 are two distinct elements , we have that @xmath98 and @xmath99 , thus @xmath100 , a contradiction",
    ". therefore @xmath101 , and certainly it is true that @xmath102 .",

    "otherwise , for each @xmath105 , choose @xmath106 such that @xmath107 .",
    "then @xmath108 , and certainly this set is as required .",
    "originally , the author had a much more involved proof for the previous corollary , whith ideas similar to those of ( * ? ? ?",
    "2.6 ) and ( * ? ? ?",
    "4 ) , until he came up with the much simpler one that is presented above .",
    "the fact that all elements of @xmath24^{<\\omega}$ ] have order @xmath71 has some remarkable consequences , amongst which the following is relevant for our purposes .",
    "[ fdoffd ] let @xmath95^{<\\omega}$ ] .",

    "the  @xmath110 \" part of the equality follows from the fact that @xmath111 , and holds in any ( semi)group . now let us illustrate the  @xmath112 \" part with the case when we add two finite sums .",
    "thus let @xmath113^{<\\omega}\\setminus\\{\\varnothing\\}$ ] be distinct , and notice that , since every element in our group at hand has order two , the following holds : @xmath114 and from this it is easy to conclude , by induction , the desired result .",
    "now in order to prove our main result , namely theorem  [ teorema ] , let @xmath50 be a nonprincipal strongly summable ultrafilter on @xmath24^{<\\omega}$ ] .",
    "we want to show that @xmath50 is sparse , thus pick @xmath36 , and pick @xmath115 such that @xmath116 .",

    "moreover @xmath120 , and now by lemma  [ fdoffd ] we get that @xmath127 , and we are done .    thus , the only thing that remains to be proved is claim  [ claim ] .",

    "then if this set is nonempty , say @xmath130 , we can use lemma  [ keylemma ] to get a @xmath131 such that @xmath132 .",
    "since @xmath50 is strongly summable , we can find a @xmath122 such that @xmath133 .",
    "then @xmath134 , and for each @xmath124 containing @xmath15 ( and by assumption there are infinitely many such ) we have that @xmath125 , because otherwise we would have @xmath135 contradicting our choice of @xmath15 and @xmath136 .",
    "the other case is when @xmath137 . in this case , let @xmath138 .",
    "then @xmath25 is an infinite subset of @xmath19 , with the property that each @xmath139 is contained in only finitely many @xmath124 ; and we will construct by recursion a very special subset of @xmath25 .",

    "now recursively define @xmath146 @xmath147 , and @xmath148 .",
    "then again @xmath149 is finite , nonempty , and disjoint from all previous @xmath150 .",

    "i am thankful to juris steprns for pointing out an error in an earlier version of this proof , as well as to the anonymous referee for useful comments on it .",
    "in this section we will investigate a necessary condition for the existence of a nonsparse strongly summable ultrafilter on some abelian group @xmath0 .",
    "this represents some partial progress towards answering ( * ? ? ?",
    "* question 4.12 ) , and sheds some light on what an answer to that question might look like .",
    "let @xmath0 be any abelian group , @xmath61 a subsemigroup of @xmath0 , and @xmath10 an ultrafilter such that @xmath169 .",
    "then @xmath170 will be an ultrafilter on @xmath61 , and it is easy to see that @xmath171 is a nonprincipal ultrafilter if and only if @xmath50 is .",

    "thus @xmath176 will be strongly summable .",
    "moreover the question of whether @xmath50 is sparse reduces to the question of whether @xmath177 is sparse .",
    "thus , when investigating the possibility of a strongly summable ultrafilter being nonsparse on an arbitrary abelian group , we may as well focus our attention on strongly summable ultrafilters on countable cancellative abelian semigroups .",
    "now if @xmath61 is a countable cancellative abelian semigroup , then it can be embedded in a countable abelian group @xmath178 ( just in the same way that @xmath179 can be embedded into @xmath180 , or @xmath181 into @xmath182 ) . and",
    "it is a well - known result ( see , e.g. , ( * ? ? ?",
    "24.1 ) , @xcite , or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th . 9.23 ) ) that every abelian group can be embedded in a divisible group ; moreover , each divisible group is a direct sum of copies of @xmath183 and of quasicyclic groups ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "23.1 ) , @xcite , or ( * ? ? ?",
    "* th . 9.14 ) ) . since @xmath183 , as well as",
    "all quasicyclic groups , can certainly be embedded in @xmath33 , the conclusion is that every countable abelian group @xmath178 can be embedded in the direct sum of countably many circle groups @xmath184 .",
    "( from now on , @xmath0 will denote that group ) .",
    "thus we can think of @xmath61 as a subset of @xmath0 , and if @xmath185 is an ultrafilter , then by letting @xmath50 be the filter on @xmath0 generated by @xmath177 , we will actually get an ultrafilter .",
    "moreover @xmath169 , and @xmath176 , so @xmath177 will be strongly summable if and only if @xmath50 is . and again , the question of whether @xmath177 is sparse reduces to the question of whether @xmath50 is sparse .",

    "equivalently , @xmath295 implies that @xmath296 , where the inequality is strict if @xmath297 .",
    "let @xmath301 . for @xmath286 , we since @xmath302 we have that @xmath287 .",
    "on the other hand , @xmath282 while @xmath303 , so @xmath304 .",
    "hence @xmath291 , now since @xmath305 , whe must have @xmath306 , which can only happen if @xmath300 .",
    "if @xmath309 , then by claim  [ alomas2 ] , we know that @xmath283 .",
    "thus we can let @xmath310 and @xmath311 ( so that @xmath312 equals either @xmath160 or @xmath313 , @xmath314 , and @xmath315 ) . now claim  [ iszeroonpreviousrho ] yields @xmath316 for @xmath317 , therefore @xmath318 which is finite .",
    "now if @xmath319 , then claim  [ alomas2 ] guarantees that there are only finitely many integers @xmath320 such that @xmath321 , so let @xmath160 be the greatest such integer if some exists , or @xmath322 otherwise ( equivalently @xmath323 where @xmath93 is the greatest integer less that @xmath65 for which @xmath324 , if such a @xmath93 exists , or @xmath322 otherwise ) .",
    "thus we know that for @xmath325 , @xmath326 . therefore @xmath327 which is finite as well .",
    "notice that , if @xmath328 is a finite subset of @xmath195 $ ] , then the subgroup of the latter generated by the former must be @xmath194 $ ] for suitable @xmath15 .",
    "namely , if @xmath329 , where @xmath330 for @xmath331 , and @xmath332 , then @xmath328 generates the subgroup @xmath333 $ ] .",
    "hence by claim  [ finitesetofgenerators ] , for each @xmath279 we can choose @xmath334 such that the subgroup of @xmath195 $ ] generated by @xmath307 is @xmath335 $ ] .",
    "in this way we construct the sequence @xmath269 of natural numbers which satisfies that @xmath336 $ ] .",
    "recall that @xmath194\\cong\\mathbb z_{2^n}$ ] ; and that , if @xmath295 , then @xmath194\\subseteq\\mathbb t[2^m]$ ] . from this , it is not hard to see that the sequence @xmath272 from the previous theorem has to be unbounded . for",
    "if that sequence was bounded , say by @xmath15 , then we would have that @xmath337\\subseteq\\bigoplus_{i<\\omega}\\mathbb t[2^n]$ ] .",
    "thus if @xmath50 is the ultrafilter yielding @xmath272 , @xmath50 would contain @xmath338 $ ] , thus inducing a ( nonprincipal ) nonsparse strongly summable ultrafilter @xmath177 on its isomorphic copy @xmath339 .",
    "but this can not happen , more generally , for every @xmath340 every strongly summable ultrafilter @xmath177 on @xmath341 is sparse .",
    "the case when @xmath342 is just theorem  [ teorema ] , and for @xmath343 , pick @xmath344 such that @xmath345 , where @xmath346 is the set consisting of those @xmath347 whose first nonzero coordinate equals @xmath160 .",
    "it is then easy to see that , for @xmath36 , if @xmath40 is a sequence of elements of @xmath348 such that @xmath349 , then for distinct @xmath350 the indices of the first nonzero coordinates of @xmath351 and @xmath352 must be different ( otherwise the first nonzero coordinate of @xmath353 would be @xmath354 , so we would have @xmath355 , which is absurd ) .",
    "this in turn implies that the sequence @xmath40 satisfies the strong uniqueness of finite sums , and thus by ( * ? ? ?",
    "3.2 ) the desired conclusion follows .",
    "therefore , since every sequence @xmath272 given by the theorem must be unbounded , one might be tempted to think that every such sequence should tend to infinity very quickly , but this is really not the case , as the following corollary shows .",
    "i am thankful to andreas blass for pointing this out to me .",
    "if @xmath50 is a nonprincipal nonsparse strongly summable ultrafilter on @xmath178 , then there is an injective homomorphism @xmath250 sending @xmath50 to an ultrafilter @xmath177 ( which must necessarily be also nonprincipal nonsparse strongly summable ) containing the set @xmath356 $ ] .",
    "in particular , if there is a nonprincipal nonsparse strongly summable ultrafilter on some abelian cancellative semigroup , then there is one on @xmath357 .",
    "given the sequence @xmath272 from theorem  [ sucesiondezetasdosenes ] , create a new strictly increasing sequence @xmath358 by letting @xmath359 be the least @xmath160 such that @xmath360 , and recursively letting @xmath361 be the least @xmath160 such that @xmath362 .",
    "then we can define the embedding @xmath250 by letting @xmath363 be the element of @xmath178 whose @xmath364-th coordinate is exactly the @xmath65-th coordinate of @xmath365 and whose @xmath160-th coordinate is zero whenever @xmath366 .",
    "clearly @xmath261 is injective .",
    "now notice that for @xmath367 $ ] , since by construction @xmath368 , we have for every @xmath279 that @xmath369\\subseteq\\mathbb t[2^{m_i}]$ ] , and of course for @xmath366 we have that @xmath370 $ ] . thus @xmath371 $ ] , hence @xmath372\\right]\\subseteq\\bigoplus_{n<\\omega}\\mathbb t[2^n]$ ] and so the latter is an element of @xmath257 , and thus the result follows ."
