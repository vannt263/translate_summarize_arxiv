    "as was shown in a number of papers , see refs . @xcite and references therein , the study of the radiative decays @xmath11 and @xmath12 can shed light on the problem of the scalar @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons .",
    "these decays have been studied not only theoretically but also experimentally @xcite .",
    "present time data have already been obtained from novosibirsk with the detectors snd @xcite and cmd-2 @xcite , which give the following branching ratios : @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 , @xmath16",
    "@xcite . da@xmath17ne also confirms the novosibirsk results @xcite .",
    "these data give evidence in favor of the four - quark @xmath18 @xcite nature of the scalar @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons .",
    "note that the isovector @xmath9 meson is produced in the radiative @xmath8 meson decay as intensively as the well - studied @xmath19 meson involving essentially strange quarks @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , responsible for the decay .    as shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , the background situation for studying the radiative decays @xmath22 and @xmath23 is very good .",
    "for example , in the case of the decay @xmath22 , the process @xmath24 is the dominant background .",

    "the influence of the background process is negligible , provided @xmath27 . in sec .",
    "ii we show that for the obtained experimental data the influence of the background processes is negligible everywhere over the photon energy region @xcite .",
    "the situation with @xmath28 decay is not much different .",
    "as was shown in @xcite the dominant background is the @xmath29 process with @xmath30 .",
    "the influence of this background process is negligible , provided @xmath31 .",
    "the exact calculation of the interference patterns between the decays @xmath23 and @xmath32 @xcite , which we present in sec .",
    "iii , shows that the influence of the background in the decay @xmath5 for the obtained experimental data is negligible in the wide region of the @xmath4 invariant mass , @xmath33 mev , or in the photon energy region @xmath34 mev .    in sec .",
    "iv we discuss the mechanism of the scalar meson production in the radiative decays and show that experimental data obtained in novosibirsk give the conclusive arguments in favor of the one - loop mechanism @xmath35 and @xmath36 of these decays @xcite .",
    "we explain also why this circumstance gives new strong evidence in favor of the four - quark nature of the scalar @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons .",
    "the fit @xcite of the experimental data from the snd detector @xcite is shown in fig .",
    "[ figa0 ] .",
    "the total branching ratio , taking into account the interference , is @xmath37 , the branching ratio of the signal is @xmath38 and the branching ratio of the background is @xmath39 .",
    "so , the integral part of the interference is negligible .",
    "the influence of the interference on the mass spectrum of the @xmath40 system is also negligible , see fig .",
    "[ figa0 ] .",
    "the total branching ratio , with interference being taken into account , is @xmath41 , the branching ratio of the signal is @xmath42 , the branching ratio of the background is @xmath43 .",
    "one can see from fig .",
    "[ figf0snd ] that the influence of the background process on the spectrum of the @xmath5 decay is negligible in the wide region of the @xmath4 invariant mass , @xmath33 mev , or when photon energy less than @xmath44 mev .",
    "= 9.5 cm    = 9.5 cm    the difference from the experimental data , observed in the region @xmath45 mev , is due to the fact that in the experimental processing of the @xmath46 events the background events @xmath47 are excluded with the help of the invariant mass cutting and simulation , in so doing the part of the @xmath48 events is excluded as well .",
    "the experimental data give evidence @xcite not only in favor of the four - quark model but in favor of the dynamical model suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , in which the discussed decays proceed through the kaon loop , @xmath49 , see refs . @xcite    indeed , according to the gauge invariance condition , the transition amplitude @xmath50 is proportional to the electromagnetic field strength tensor @xmath51 ( in our case to the electric field ) .",

    "[ figa0 ] and [ figf0snd ] , the function @xmath56 should be smooth ( almost constant ) in the range @xmath57 gev , see eqs .",
    "( [ spectruma0 ] ) and ( [ f0 ] ) .",
    "stopping the function @xmath58 at @xmath59 mev , using the form - factor of the form @xmath60 , requires @xmath61 gev@xmath62 .",
    "it seems to be incredible to explain the formation of such a huge radius in hadron physics .",
    "based on the large , by hadron physics standard , @xmath63 gev@xmath62 , one can obtain an effective maximum of the mass spectra under discussion only near 900 mev . in the meantime",
    ", the @xmath64 loop gives the natural description to this threshold effect , see fig .",

    "[ gg ] and fig.[ggg ] in which the function @xmath56 is shown in the case of @xmath65 meson mass is 25 mev and 50 mev less than in reality .",
    "one can see from figs .",
    "[ gg ] and [ ggg ] that the function @xmath56 is suppressed by the @xmath58 low in the region 950 - 1020 mev and 900 - 1020 mev respectively .",

    "( [ spectruma0 ] ) and ( [ f0 ] ) , so that we can not see the resonance in the region 980 - 995 mev .",
    "the maximum in the spectrum is effectively shifted to the region 935 - 950 mev and 880 - 900 mev respectively .    in truth",
    "this means that @xmath9 and @xmath10 resonances are seen in the radiative decays of @xmath8 meson owing to the @xmath64 intermediate state , otherwise the maxima in the spectra would be shifted to 900 mev .",
    "thus the mechanism of production of the scalar mesons in the @xmath8 radiative decays is established at a physical level of proof .",
    "it is the rarest case in hadron physics .",
    "loop model is practically accepted by theorists , compare , for example , ref .",
    "@xcite with ref .",
    "@xcite ; true there is exception @xcite . ]",
    "both real and imaginary parts of the @xmath67 amplitudes are caused by the @xmath64 intermediate state .",
    "the imaginary parts are caused by the real @xmath64 intermediate state while the real parts are caused by the virtual compact @xmath64 intermediate state , that is , we are dealing here with the four - quark transition .",
    "needless to say radiative four - quark transitions can happen between two two - quark states as well as between two - quark and four - quark states but their intensities depend strongly on a type of the transitions .",
    "a radiative four - quark transition between two two - quark states requires creation of an additional @xmath68 pair , that is , such a transition is forbidden according to the okuba - zweig - izuka ( ozi ) rule , while a radiative four - quark transition between two - quark and four - quark states happens without creation an additional @xmath68 pair , that is , such a transition is allowed according to the ozi rule .",
    "let us discuss this problem from two point of views : i ) from point of view of intermediate states and ii ) from point of view of the @xmath69 expansion .",
    "\\i ) it was noted already in paper @xcite that the imaginary part of the @xmath64 loop is calculated practically in a model independent way making use of the coupling constants @xmath70 and @xmath71 due to the low s theorem @xcite for the photons with energy @xmath25 mev which is soft by the standard of strong interaction .    in the same paper",
    "it was noted that the real part of the loop ( with accuracy up to 20% in the width of the @xmath72 decay ) is practically not different for the point - like particle and the compact hadron with form - factor which has the cutting radius in the momentum space about the mass of @xmath73 meson ( @xmath74 gev ) .",
    "in contrast to the four - quark state which is the compact hadron @xcite , the bound @xmath75 state is the extended state with the spatial radius @xmath76 , where @xmath77 is the binding energy .",
    "corresponding form - factor in the momentum space has the radius of the order of @xmath78 mev for @xmath79 mev , @xcite .",
    "the more detailed calculation @xcite gives for the radius in the momentum space the value @xmath80 mev . as a result ,",
    "the contribution of the virtual intermediate @xmath64 states in the @xmath64 loop is suppressed by the momentum distribution in the molecule , and the real part of the loop amplitude is negligible @xcite .",
    "it leads to the branching ratio much less than the experimental one .",
    "in addition , the spectrum is much narrower in the @xmath75 molecule case that contradicts to the experiment , see the behavior of the imaginary part contribution in fig .",
    "[ g ] and in corresponding figures in @xcite .",
    "of course , the two - quark state is as compact as four - quark one .",
    "the question arises , why is the branching ratio in the two - quark model suppressed in comparison with the branching ratio in the four - quark model ?",
    "there are two reasons .",
    "first , the coupling constant of two - quark states with the @xmath75 channel is noticeably less @xcite and , second , there is the ozi rule that is more important really .",
    "if the isovector @xmath9 meson is the two - quark state , it has no strange quarks .",
    "hence @xcite , the decay @xmath81 should be suppressed according to the ozi rule . on the intermediate state level ,",
    "the ozi rule is formulated as compensation of the different intermediate states @xcite . in our case",
    "these states are @xmath82 , @xmath83 , @xmath84 and so on . since , due to the kinematical reason , the real intermediate state is the only @xmath64 state , the compensation in the imaginary part is impossible and it destroys the ozi rule",
    ". the compensation should be in the real part of the amplitude only . as a result",
    ", the @xmath81 decay in the two - quark model is mainly due to the imaginary part of the amplitude and is much less intensive than in the four - quark model @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the two - quark model , @xmath9 meson should appear in the @xmath81 decay as a noticeably more narrow resonance than in other processes , see the behavior of the imaginary part contribution in fig .",
    "as regards to the isoscalar @xmath10 state , there are two possibilities in the two - quark model . if @xmath10 meson does not contain the strange quarks the all above mentioned arguments about suppression of the @xmath81 decay and the spectrum shape are also valid for the @xmath85 decay . generally speaking",
    ", there could be the strong ozi violation for the isoscalar @xmath68 states ( mixing of the @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath20 states ) with regard to the strong mixing of the quark and gluon degree of freedom which is due to the nonperturbative effects of qcd @xcite .",
    "but , an almost exact degeneration of the masses of the isoscalar @xmath10 and isovector @xmath9 mesons excludes such a possibility .",
    "note also , the experiment points directly to the weak coupling of @xmath10 meson with gluons , @xmath88 @xcite .    if @xmath10 meson is close to the @xmath20 state @xcite , there is no suppression due to the the ozi rule . nevertheless ,",
    "if @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons are the members of the same multiplet , the @xmath85 branching ratio , @xmath89 , is significantly less than that in the four - quark model , due to the relation between the coupling constants with the @xmath75 , @xmath40 and @xmath75 , @xmath90 channels inherited in the two - quark model , see refs .",
    "@xcite . in addition ,",
    "in this case there is no natural explanation of the @xmath91 and @xmath92 mass degeneration .    only in the case",
    "when the nature of @xmath10 meson in no way related to the nature of @xmath9 meson ( which , for example , is the four - quark state ) the experimentally observed branching ratio of the @xmath85 decay could be explained by @xmath20 nature of @xmath10 meson .",
    "but , from the theoretical point of view , such a possibility seems awful @xcite .",
    "\\ii ) what is more , the ozi allowed transition is bound to have a small weight in the @xmath69 expansion in case of @xmath20 nature of @xmath10 meson .",
    "indeed , the main term of the @xmath69 expansion of the @xmath85 amplitude , i.e , the ozi allowed transition , has the order of @xmath93 but does not contains the @xmath64 intermediate state .",
    "this state emerges only in the next to leading term of the @xmath69 expansion , i.e. , in the ozi forbidden transition , which has the order of @xmath69 .    if @xmath10 meson is the two - quark state without the strange quarks , the @xmath69 expansion of the @xmath94 amplitude starts with the ozi forbidden transition of the order of @xmath69 . but",
    "a weight of this term is bound to be small , because it does not contain the @xmath64 intermediate state , which emerges only in the next to leading term of the order of @xmath95 .    in the two - quark model of @xmath9 meson",
    "the @xmath69 expansion of the @xmath96 amplitude starts also with the ozi forbidden transition of the order of @xmath69 , whose weight is bound to be small , because this term does not contain the @xmath64 intermediate state , which emerges only in the next to leading term of the order of @xmath95 too .",
    "amplitude has the order of @xmath93 . ]    in the meantime , if @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons are compact @xmath75 states , i.e. , four - quark states , the @xmath69 expansions of the @xmath97 amplitudes start with the ozi allowed transitions of the order of @xmath98 , which contain the @xmath64 intermediate state .",
    "as we see , the knowledge of the mechanism of the scalar meson production in the @xmath8 radiative decays gives the new very strong ( if not crucial ) evidence in favor of the four - quark nature of the scalar @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons .",
