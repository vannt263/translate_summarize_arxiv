    "recently , @xcite has reported the discovery of a bright reflection nebula in a previously dark region of the l1630 cloud within the orion b complex .",
    "an infrared source at the apex of mcneil s nebula ( hereinafter referred to as mcneil s nebular object , or mno ) has significantly brightened in the optical and near - infrared since 2003 november .",
    "detailed imaging and spectroscopy of that object are described by @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "apparently the nebula has brightened in the past , indicating that mno has resumed its outburst activity after roughly 37 years of quiescence ( see the discussions by * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in the low state ,",
    "mno is positionally coincident with a faint @xmath3-band point source @xcite , a 2mass source ( j05461313@xmath40006058 ) , an iras point source ( 05436@xmath40007 ) , an iso source @xcite , as well as a clump of submillimeter emission known as lmz12 ( lis , menten , & zykla 1999 ) and oribsmm55 @xcite .",
    "previous work has shown that the l1630 cloud contains a number of deeply embedded young stellar objects ( ysos ) , which drive powerful outflows ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in the immediate vicinity of mno",
    "there are several class 0 ( hh24-mms , hh25-mms ) and class i ( ssv59 , ssv63 , hh26-ir ) sources , as well as a series of outflows ( hh22@xmath427 ) . both before @xcite and after @xcite the current episode of activity , it has been suggested that mno is the origin of the hh23 jet . in this paper , we provide new mid - infrared and submillimeter observations of mno in its high state and we discuss their implications for understanding the evolutionary status of that object .",
    "submillimeter continuum photometry at 450 and 850@xmath0 m of mno was obtained on ut 2004 march 10 with the submillimeter common user bolometer array ( scuba ) on the james clerk maxwell telescope ( jcmt ) at mauna kea , hawaii .",
    "the precipitable water vapor ( ppv ) level was steady at @xmath11.8 mm , with frequent skydip observations showing zenith optical depths of 0.36 at 850@xmath0 m and 2.05 at 450@xmath0 m .",
    "the data were acquired in 20 sets of 18s integrations in a small 9-point jiggle pattern with the secondary mirror chopping 60   in azimuth at 7.8hz .",
    "mars and crl618 were observed to check the telescope pointing and to determine the absolute flux calibration .",
    "the pointing has an rms error of @xmath52 ; the flux calibration is accurate to @xmath110% at 850@xmath0 m and @xmath130% at 450@xmath0 m .",
    "standard reduction techniques were performed using the surf software provided by the joint astronomy center .",
    "mid - infrared spectroscopic observations of mno in the @xmath6-band were carried out on ut 2004 march 11 at the united kingdom infrared telescope ( ukirt ) on mauna kea with the michelle imaging spectrometer @xcite .",
    "the michelle detector is a si : as 320@xmath7240 pixel array operating between 8 and 25@xmath0 m . in spectroscopy mode ,",
    "the instrument uses a 91  slit ( in our case with a p.a .",
    "= 0  orientation ) . the low - n grating and a 2-pixel wide ( 076 ) slit were used to provide spectral coverage between 7.5 and 12.5@xmath0 m at a resolving power of @xmath8 .",
    "atmospheric variations were removed using a standard nod - and - chop pattern during the total on - source integration time of @xmath11250s .",
    "the atmosphere was dry ( ppv @xmath11.6 mm ) and stable , providing fwhm values for point sources of 08 at 10@xmath0 m . slit images demonstrate that mno is point - like in the mid - infrared .",
    "the spectra were sky - subtracted , flat - fielded and combined using the observatory reduction and acquisition control ( orac ) software @xcite .",
    "the iraf task apall was then used to extract spectra with a 3 pixel ( 114 ) aperture .",
    "a wavelength calibration solution was determined from terrestrial emission lines identified with atrans atmospheric models @xcite .",
    "the rms of the wavelength fit was @xmath10.04@xmath0 m .",
    "the primary flux standard rigel ( bs1713 ) was used for both telluric correction and flux calibration .",
    "the mno spectrum was divided by the standard star spectrum and the result was scaled by a model thermal spectrum based on the @xmath6-band ( 10@xmath0 m ) flux of the standard star .",
    "spectral line maps of @xmath9co(j=@xmath10 ) and @xmath11co(j=@xmath10 ) around mno ( covering 5@xmath75  and 2@xmath72 , respectively ) were obtained from mauna kea with the 230-ghz heterodyne receiver on the cso telescope on ut 2004 march 17 .",
    "the observations were conducted in the on - the - fly mode , providing nyquist - sampled maps with a spatial resolution of @xmath131 .",
    "the 50-mhz aos backend provided a spectral resolution of @xmath10.06kms@xmath12 per channel and rms noise levels of @xmath11.1k in both lines .",
    "standard procedures with the class software package were used to reduce the data .",

    "the error bars in figure 1 represent the systematic uncertainties in absolute flux calibration .",
    "consistent with the factor of @xmath116 near - infrared brightening of mno , the 12@xmath0 m flux density rose by a factor of @xmath125 during the high state . in the standard classification scheme for young stellar objects , or ysos (",

    "2000 ) , a sed type is assigned from the logarithmic slope of the spectrum , @xmath17 , where @xmath18 .",
    "for the conventional infrared indices of the post - outburst sed of mno , we obtain @xmath19 between 2 and 10@xmath0 m ( corresponding to the @xmath20 color ) and @xmath21 between 2 and 12@xmath0m5 weeks apart , and are therefore subject to any changes in the near - infrared fluxes during that time . ] .",
    "the 2mass 2@xmath0 m and iras 12@xmath0 m points from the quiescent phase of mno yield an index of @xmath22 .",
    "the foregoing values of the sed slope in the infrared establish mno as a flat - spectrum / class i object regardless of its activity level .",
    "figure 2 shows the mid - infrared spectrum of mno from 7.5 to 12.5@xmath0 m .",
    "the spectrum exhibits a bright , red , featureless continuum across the @xmath6-band .",
    "a simple power - law fit to the continuous spectrum gives @xmath23 , which corresponds to @xmath24 .",
    "the positions of various solid - state features that are commonly seen in the spectra of other ysos are labeled in figure 2 , although none of them are detected here .",
    "the flux densities at 450 and 850@xmath0 m measured in our scuba observations of mno are @xmath25 and @xmath26jybeam@xmath12 ( quoted errors are 1@xmath27 statistical uncertainties ) , and correspond to fwhm apertures of @xmath19  and @xmath114 , respectively .",
    "our 850@xmath0 m flux density is essentially identical to the value cited by @xcite for a @xmath120  diameter aperture , based on scuba maps of l1630 made by those authors in 1998 .",
    "@xcite have argued that the 1.3 mm emission is confined within a deconvolved diameter of @xmath28 .",
    "given the agreement between the 850@xmath0 m flux densities measured in two different sized apertures , the circumstellar structure responsible for the submillimeter emission must also be compact , and @xmath29au in diameter if we assume the accepted distance of @xmath30pc for l1630 .",
    "contrary to the behavior of the optical and infrared spectrum of mno , no changes are apparent in the submillimeter continuum ( 350@xmath0 m @xmath31 1.3 mm ) as a result of the current activity .",
    "assuming the rayleigh - jeans limit and optically - thin emission , the submillimeter flux density follows the relationship @xmath32 , where @xmath33 is the power - law index of the grain opacity .",
    "a least - squares fit to the four submillimeter points in the ( @xmath34 ) plane gives @xmath35 .",
    "the slightly more sophisticated model of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their equation 2 ) , if applied to the 450 and 850@xmath0 m measurements , yields a range of @xmath33 between 0.79 and 1.24 ( for dust temperature values @xmath36 and 20k , respectively ) .",
    "the discrepancy in @xmath33 between a simple fit and the @xcite model may indicate that the material is not optically - thin and/or the rayleigh - jeans approximation is inappropriate .",
    "the value of @xmath33 is apparently near unity , although we caution that it would be best determined with a full sed model fit if more far - infrared data become available while mno is in an active state .",
    "as shown above and discussed by @xcite , the small ( slightly negative ) infrared spectral index , @xmath17 , establishes mno as a flat - spectrum / class i object .",
    "the large spectral slope in the submillimeter is also more typical of class i sources than the presumably more evolved class ii sources @xcite .",
    "it is worthwhile to compare mno with the other young outflow sources in l1630 , since it is reasonable to assume these other objects , as siblings of mno , may experience similar outbursts . using our data and the flux values given by @xcite",
    ", we note that the 850@xmath0 m flux decreases by a factor of 4 between the class 0 ( e.g. , hh 24-mms and hh 25-mms ) and class i ( e.g. , ssv 59 and ssv 63ew ) objects in l1630 , and by another factor of 4 from the class i objects to mno . with an appropriate correction for distance , flat - spectrum sources in other clouds have 850@xmath0 m fluxes similar to that of mno ( e.g. , hl tau ) . applying the standard assumption of optically - thin , isothermal dust ( @xmath37@xmath38 g@xmath12 , @xmath39k ;",
    "* ) , we infer from the 850@xmath0 m flux a total ( gas + dust ) circumstellar mass of @xmath40m@xmath2 . our mass estimate is an order of magnitude lower than that calculated by @xcite , primarily due to the different @xmath41 assumed .",
    "nevertheless , @xmath42 is significantly larger than the values typically found for class ii disks .",
    "the submillimeter evidence therefore agrees well with the interpretation from the infrared sed that mno is currently in transition from the class i to class ii stage of protostellar evolution .",
    "the circumstellar environment of mno is probably dominated by a massive accretion disk , with only a remnant envelope structure .",
    "the mid - infrared spectrum of mno shown in figure 2 is notably devoid of any solid - state spectral features .",
    "none of the three major pah features ( at 7.7 , 8.6 , and 11.2@xmath0 m ) are seen , in agreement with the absence of the more frequently detected 3.3@xmath0 m pah feature in the 15@xmath0 m spectrum presented by @xcite .",
    "pah features are seldom observed in low - mass ysos ( smith , sellgren , & tokunaga 1989 ; brooke , sellgren , & geballe 1999 ) , but are more common in their higher mass counterparts , the haebe stars @xcite .",
    "there is no evidence for 3.3@xmath0 m pah emission in the infrared spectra of the other class i objects in l1630 discussed by @xcite .",
    "more puzzling is the absence of a 9.7@xmath0 m amorphous silicate feature in the spectrum of mno . according to @xcite , at least two of the other class i objects in l1630 ( ssv59 and 63 ) have strong silicate absorption bands .",
    "the optical depth of the 3.1@xmath0 m h@xmath43o ice band measured by @xcite , @xmath44 , suggests that the 9.7@xmath0 m feature of mno should also be in absorption . using information provided by ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 8) , we would expect a band depth of @xmath45(9.7@xmath0 m ) @xmath46 .",
    "such a shallow absorption could be entirely filled in by emission from the optically - thin surface layers of a disk if it is viewed at a suitably high inclination angle ( * ? ? ?",
    "* their figure 5 ) .",
    "recent vla observations at wavelengths of 3.6 , 6 , and 20 cm detected no radio emission from mno to rms noise levels of 42 , 48 , and 140@xmath0jy , respectively @xcite .",
    "the flux densities expected from dust , based on an extrapolation from the submillimeter wavelengths , fall below these detection limits . of the class i sources in l1630 ,",
    "radio detections have been reported previously for ssv63 ( three separate components : * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and hh26-ir , whereas ssv59 has a 3@xmath27 upper limit of 66@xmath0jy @xcite .",
    "the radio emission from objects like ssv59 and mno is either absent or optically - thick .",
    "the lack of an obvious high velocity jet or molecular outflow from mno remains to be explained and further distinguishes this object from the other ysos in l1630 .",
    "although a powerful wind is evident in post - outburst optical and infrared spectra , shocked emission from the standard optical and infrared forbidden lines is absent @xcite .",
    "the submillimeter co spectral line maps obtained by us and by @xcite show no spatial distinction between redshifted and blueshifted emission .",
    "the limited spatial resolution of these maps does not definitively rule out the presence of a molecular outflow , and so interferometric observations will be required to address this issue appropriately .",
    "however , as shown in figure 3 , our single - dish observations do rule out the presence of gas moving at velocities greater than @xmath13 km s@xmath12 from the rest velocity of the l1630 cloud .",
    "the best candidate outflow signatures from mno are the hh23 clumps of [ ] emission , which are located @xmath13  to the north , along the direction of mcneil s nebula @xcite .    using a simple trapezoidal integration of the seds shown in figure 1",
    ", we estimate that the bolometric luminosity of mno has changed from @xmath13.5 to 34l@xmath2 during the outburst .",
    "the pre - outburst value of @xmath47 was estimated by @xcite to be 2.7l@xmath2 and by @xcite to be 5.6l@xmath2 .",
    "the former result is identical to ours when allowance is made for the different distances that were used .",
    "the @xcite value is slightly larger than ours because those authors chose to correct for an assumed ( non - local ) extinction of @xmath48mags .",
    "however , such a correction leads to an over - estimate of @xmath47 if the extinction is due to local circumstellar material ( as is thought to be the case for mno ) because the short - wavelength flux is thermalized and then re - emitted at longer wavelengths .",
    "our post - outburst value of @xmath47 likely underestimates the true value because we lack information in the sed near its peak in the far - infrared .",
    "we have used a linear extrapolation between the infrared and submillimeter portions of the sed to estimate a peak flux of @xmath180jy ( at roughly 70@xmath0 m ) , which leads to an upper limit on the post - outburst @xmath49l@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite have calculated an intrinsic luminosity of the post - outburst mno of @xmath50l@xmath2 from their @xmath3-band data , assuming that the spectral type is a0v and that @xmath51 , or @xmath52 .",
    "however , the post - outburst colors of mno suggest a lower extinction of @xmath53 @xcite , which is in good agreement with the value indicated by the depth of the infrared h@xmath43o ice band @xcite . using the interstellar extinction law of @xcite ,",
    "the main sequence colors and bolometric corrections of @xcite , and the lower post - outburst extinction value , the @xcite luminosity is reduced by more than a factor of 4 , to @xmath54l@xmath2 ( this assumes @xmath55 ; the value would be roughly a factor of 2 larger if @xmath56 ) .",
    "the revised value is thus in good agreement with the estimate obtained by integrating under the sed .",
    "both analyses , all the same , should be treated with some caution . in the post - outburst stage",
    ", there will be a considerable contamination of the @xmath3-band magnitudes from scattering in mcneil s nebula ( particularly with the large pixel scale in those observations ) . moreover , it is not at all clear that main sequence colors and bolometric corrections apply to ysos like mno . at the same time ,",
    "a simple integration of the sed includes any luminosity from accretion , and consequently may not be an accurate representation of the intrinsic photospheric flux ( including the portion that is thermalized by local dust and re - emitted at longer wavelengths ) . with those caveats in mind , the @xmath47 values both before and after the outburst do not support earlier claims that mno is a b type star , to order of magnitude they are similar to those of other ysos in l1630 @xcite , and they are significantly lower than those derived for fu orionis stars ( e.g. , * ? ? ? * their table 1 ) .",
    "we have presented new observations in the mid - infrared and submillimeter of the outburst star which illuminates mcneil s nebula .",
    "the object has brightened by a factor of @xmath125 in the mid - infrared , yet remained at the same brightness in the submillimeter .",
    "the bolometric luminosity has increased by ( at least ) an order of magnitude , but still remains low compared to that expected from either an early - type photosphere or a fuor .",
    "our limited co spectral - line maps indicate that no high - velocity flows of molecular gas have yet appeared in the immediate vicinity of this object .",
    "far - infrared observations of mno from the _ spitzer _ space telescope would help to complete the post - outburst sed and aid in determining @xmath47 and @xmath41 , thus @xmath42 , providing important evolutionary constraints on this object .",
    "observations of solid - state features in the mid- and far - infrared spectrum of mno would also serve to provide a constraint on the disk inclination angle and thus would offer a test of our explanation for the absence of the 9.7@xmath0 m feature .",
    "we are grateful to tom kerr , sandy leggett , thomas lowe , sandrine bottinelli , and jonathan williams for their assistance with the observations and data reduction .",
    "suggestions from an anonymous referee have greatly improved this letter .",
    "we also want to thank mark claussen , mike cushing , joel kastner , bo reipurth , and bill vacca , who have generously shared their results before publication .",
