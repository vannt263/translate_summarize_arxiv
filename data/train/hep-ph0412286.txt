    "asymmetries of sea quark distributions of the nucleon has for quite some time been an intriguing problem . for the part of the nucleon sea arising from gluon splittings @xmath3 in perturbative qcd",
    ", symmetry is expected in the distributions of quarks and antiquarks , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath4 , and also @xmath5 .",
    "conventional parameterizations of quark momentum distributions assume these symmetries also for the @xmath6-distributions at the start of the perturbative qcd evolution .",
    "however , for these sea distributions arising from the non - perturbative dynamics of the bound state nucleon experiment has shown that there are asymmetries between @xmath7 and @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "there are also no symmetry arguments to prevent asymmetries between quark and anti - quark .",
    "this is of great interest , especially in connection to the nutev  anomaly , where the value of @xmath9 was found to differ from the standard model fitted value by almost three standard deviations @xcite .",
    "the anomaly can however , at least in part , be due to an asymmetry between the momentum distribution of @xmath1 and @xmath10 in the nucleon sea @xcite .    here",
    ", we report on recent progress ( to be more comprehensively presented in @xcite ) to understand these asymmetries based on a simple and phenomenologically successful model for the parton distributions in hadrons .",
    "in particular , we have shown @xcite that nucleon fluctuations into @xmath11 , where the @xmath1 quark is in the heavier @xmath12 baryon and the @xmath13 is in the lighter @xmath14 meson , gives a harder momentum distribution for the @xmath1 than the @xmath13 .",
    "this would reduce the nutev  anomaly to about two standard deviations .",

    "[ fig : fluct ] .",
    "the model gives the four - momentum @xmath16 of a single probed valence parton by assuming that , in the nucleon rest frame where there is no preferred direction , the shape of the momentum distribution for a parton of type @xmath17 and mass @xmath18 is then taken as a gaussian @xmath19 which may be motivated as a result of the many interactions binding the parton in the nucleon",
    ". the width of the distribution should be of order hundred mev from the heisenberg uncertainty relation applied to the nucleon size , _",
    "i.e. _  @xmath20 .",
    "the momentum fraction @xmath6 of the parton is then defined as the light - cone fraction @xmath21 . in order to obtain a kinematically allowed final state",
    ", we impose the following constraints",
    ". the scattered parton must be on - shell or having a time - like virtuality , _",
    "i.e. _  have a mass - squared in the range @xmath22 ( @xmath23 is the invariant mass of the hadronic system ) .",
    "furthermore , the hadron remnant @xmath24 is obtained from energy - momentum conservation and must have a time - like virtuality .",
    "these constraints also ensure that @xmath25 .    using a monte carlo method these parton distributions",
    "are integrated numerically without approximations .",
    "the normalization of the valence distributions is provided by the sum rules @xmath26 and @xmath27 , to get the correct quantum numbers of the proton ( and similarly for other hadrons ) .",
    "the gluon normalization is given by the momentum sum rule @xmath28 , where the sum also includes sea partons .",
    "to describe the dynamics of the sea partons , we note that the appropriate basis for the non - perturbative dynamics of the bound state nucleon is a hadronic quantum mechanical basis .",
    "therefore we consider hadronic fluctuations , _ e.g.",
    "_  for the proton @xmath29    probing a parton @xmath17 in a hadron @xmath30 of such a fluctuation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : fluct]b ) gives a sea parton with light - cone fraction @xmath31 of the target proton , _",
    "i.e. _  the sea distributions are obtained from a convolution of the momentum @xmath14 of the hadron and the momentum @xmath16 of the parton in that hadron .",
    "the momentum of the probed hadron is given by a similar gaussian as eq .",
    "but with a separate width parameter @xmath32 .",
    "the kinematical constraints to be applied in this case are @xmath33 and that the remnants ( see fig .  [ fig : fluct]b ) have time - like virtualities . here",
    "@xmath34 , giving a harder spectrum for the heavier baryon than the lighter meson , for details see  @xcite .",
    "the normalization of the sea distributions is given by the amplitude coefficients @xmath35 .",
    "these are partly given by clebsch - gordan coefficients , but depend primarily on non - perturbative dynamics that can not be calculated from first principles in qcd and are , therefore , taken as free parameters .",
    "this model results in valence and sea parton @xmath6-distributions as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluct](c ) .",
    "these apply at a low scale @xmath15 , and the distributions at higher @xmath36 are obtained using perturbative qcd evolution .",
    "the distributions shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fluct](c ) is the result of the fits described below .",
    "after qcd evolution , the proton structure function @xmath37 can be calculated and the model parameters fitted to data from deep inelastic scattering .",
    "this results in the parameter set @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the fraction of the proton momentum carried by sea quarks at the scale @xmath15 .",
    "such inclusive data can only be used to determine the overall normalization @xmath40 for the dominating light quark sea from fluctuations with pions in eq .",

    "[ fig : f2data ] and @xcite .",
    "the model also reproduces the observed asymmetry between the @xmath42 and @xmath43 distributions as a result of the suppression of fluctuations with a @xmath44 relative to those with a @xmath45 , since the former require a heavier baryon ( _ e.g. _  @xmath46 ) . with only one additional",
    "parameter the model gives a nice fit to data on this asymmetry ( see fig .  [",

    "the value of this parameter turns out to be @xmath49 , which might seem surprising in view of the fact that from isospin the relationship should be @xmath50 .",
