    "<S> we first study the effect of inhomogeneous exchange coupling strengths on the entanglement properties of the s=@xmath0 antiferromagnetic linear chain tetramer compound @xmath1 . the entanglement gap temperature , @xmath2 , is found to have a non - monotonic dependence on the value of @xmath3 , the exchange coupling inhomogeneity parameter . </S>",
    "<S> we next determine the variation of @xmath2 as a function of @xmath4 for a spin dimer , a trimer and a tetrahedron . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature @xmath2 is found to increase as a function of @xmath4 but the scaled entanglement gap temperature @xmath5 goes to zero as @xmath4 becomes large . </S>",
    "<S> lastly , we study a spin-1 dimer compound to illustrate the quantum complementarity relation . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in the experimentally realizable parameter region , magnetization and entanglement plateaus appear simultaneously at low temperatures as a function of the magnetic field . also , the sharp increase in one quantity as a function of the magnetic field is accompanied by a sharp decrease in the other so that the quantum complementarity relation is not violated .    </S>",
