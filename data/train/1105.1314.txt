    "[ f.sg-tc1 ] shows that the scaling of both quantities give a consistent estimate of the critical @xmath183 value for the onset of crystalline order .",

    "@xcite the estimate of @xmath183 was biased by the choice of a scaling ansatz on the superfluid stiffness which , albeit satisfactorily verified within the statistical uncertainties , turns out to not be fully justified .",
    "the current estimate is not based on any scaling ansatz , and it delivers a transition line which is shifted to larger @xmath183 values ( typically by about 10 - 20 % ) with respect to the estimates in ref .",

    "<S> [ f.2tll](c ) . </S>",
    "<S> this means that , even if the su(2 ) symmetry is broken in the hamiltonian , it appears to be restored in the ground - state of the system , namely that a moderate mass imbalance is an _ irrelevant _ perturbation and that , under a renormalization group treatment , the system flows to the su(2)-symmetric fixed point @xmath81 over a broad range of @xmath82 values . </S>",
    "<S> this picture is further corroborated by comparing the longitudinal spin - spin correlations @xmath83 and the transverse ones in the _ fermionic case _ </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath84 , where @xmath85 ; the two correlation functions show the same algebraic decay over a broad range of @xmath82 values , and they even appear to coincide at short range , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.2tll](d ) .     for @xmath86 and decreasing @xmath82 ; dashed lines are fits to @xmath87 ; ( b ) @xmath3-hole density correlator for nearest neighbors , @xmath88 ; the shaded areas mark the transition regions among the various phases ; ( c ) string structure factor as a function of system size ( same parameters as in ( a ) ) ; ( d ) decay exponent of the string correlation function as function of @xmath82.,width=287 ]    [ f.sg ]    on the other hand , a careful study of the behavior of the system shows that the two - component tll becomes indeed unstable to the formation of a spin gap ( sg ) for _ strong _ mass imbalance ( @xmath89 for @xmath90 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the opening of a spin gap leaves a clear signature in the luttinger exponent @xmath91 , which stops flowing to the su(2 ) symmetric value : this is seen in the fact that @xmath42 begins to scale _ faster _ than linearly in @xmath80 , which is a manifestation of the fact that @xmath77 flows to values smaller than 1 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.sg](a ) . </S>",
    "<S> we use this criterion to locate the opening of the spin gap in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.phd ] . </S>",
    "<S> moreover the breaking of su(2 ) symmetric scaling is also seen in the spin - spin correlation functions , which acquire a different behavior at short and long distances ( see fig .  [ f.2tll](d ) ) . </S>",
    "<S> the opening of a spin gap signals the formation of a bound state of some sort : but what could this bound state be in a purely repulsive system ? </S>",
    "<S> we argue that a bound state can appear between the @xmath2 particles and the _ holes _ of the @xmath3 species , which are in a commensurate proportion @xmath92 to the @xmath2 particles . as shown in ref .  , a sufficiently strong mass imbalance can indeed bind together particle composites in 1d quantum fluids - in the specific case of @xmath12 we have trimers formed by one @xmath2 particle and two @xmath3 holes ( @xmath93 ) . for strong enough repulsion ( @xmath94 ) the apparition of @xmath2-@xmath95 composites </S>",
    "<S> is seen in the nearest - neighbor density correlations of the @xmath93 holes , @xmath96 , which is enhanced for increasing mass - imbalance , as seen in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.sg](b ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath2-@xmath95 composites have mutual repulsive interactions , as observed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , so that their binding favors configurations of the type @xmath97 in which the @xmath2 and @xmath3 particles alternate spatially . </S>",
    "<S> such configurations , albeit lacking long - range density and magnetic order , contain strong non - local correlations that can be captured using a _ _ string correlation function__@xcite @xmath98  . as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.sg](c-d ) , string correlations are significantly enhanced when entering the sg phase : indeed the string structure factor , @xmath99 , shows a more pronounced divergence with system size , which signals the slower decay of @xmath100 . as shown in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> , in presence of spin - charge separation the dominant decay of the string correlations is governed solely by the @xmath25 exponent , @xmath101 ; therefore @xmath31 controls the divergence of @xmath102 , and in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.sg](d ) we observe that the @xmath103 exponent ( extracted from the low-@xmath74 behavior of @xmath104 ) is significantly enhanced in the sg phase . </S>",
    "<S> given that both the spin and charge structure factor exhibit a peak whose divergence with system size is hindered by the slow size - scaling of the divergence exponent @xmath105 @xcite , we find that the string correlations best characterize the  fluid \" magnetic order of the sg phase .    </S>",
    "<S> the bound trimers appearing in the sg phase undergo crystallization - phase tc1 in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.phd ] - for moderate repulsion and extreme mass imbalance . </S>",
    "<S> the tc1 phase is analogous to the one discussed in ref .   </S>",
    "<S> ( see also ref .  ) . </S>",
    "<S> this phase is marked by a suppression of @xmath106 which attains its absolute minimum @xmath107 for @xmath108 , due to the suppression of the weight of configurations with contiguous trimers . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting non - monotonic behavior of @xmath106 as a function of @xmath82 , shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.sg](b ) ( see also ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite ) , provides further evidence that the sg phase is a liquid of pre - formed trimers - the enhancement of @xmath106 in that phase is due to trimer binding , while the suppression in the tc1 phase is due to crystal ordering of the trimers .    </S>",
    "<S> our theoretical results have immediate consequences for current experiments on one - dimensional mixtures of mass - imbalanced cold atoms . </S>",
    "<S> such experiments can probe both attractive and repulsive interactions , within the same experimental conditions , via the use of feshbach resonances @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our phase diagram reveals a fundamental asymmetry between the attractive and the repulsive case for weak and moderate mass imbalance , with the formation of bound pairs on the attractive side and the absence of spin gap on the repulsive one . </S>",
    "<S> this asymmetry is very well seen in time of flight experiments probing the momentum distributions @xmath109 , @xmath110 , which are very broad on the attractive side , while they exhibit sharp quasi - condensation peaks on the repulsive side  as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ f.nk ] . this asymmetry can be used as strong evidence of pairing on the attractive side . </S>",
    "<S> a partial symmetry is recovered only for strong mass imbalance , with the opening of a spin gap in the repulsive case , and the occurrence of a crystalline phase for both signs of the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> this is also well captured by the momentum distributions , showing this time a suppression of the quasi - condensation peaks on the repulsive side due to the appearance of the sg phase and of the crystalline phase . finally the availability of high - resolution _ in - situ _ imaging @xcite sensitive to the spin @xcite allows to detect the formation of bound trimers and the enhancement of string correlations characterizing the sg phase .    </S>",
