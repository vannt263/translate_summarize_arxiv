    "clearly , the sub - box size must be small enough to reduce the number of sub - boxes that probe the interfaces , but large enough to avoid big fluctuations due to small particle number effects . for our system sizes and temperature resolution @xmath94",
    "we find similar results when @xmath95 to @xmath96 sub - boxes are used , however this method suffers from the finite size effects as mentioned in the main text .",

    "already partially separating configurations with @xmath97 were used as the initial configurations for the higher temperatures . the time to reach the steady state and the observation time of the steady state are long ( chains diffuse at least half the box size ) , however",
    "not all systems have reached the steady state ( e.g. @xmath97 due to its proximity to the critical point ) . ]",
    "the steady state ( when @xmath61 as function of time plateaus ) is typically reached after the chains diffused distance equal to the simulation box size .",
    "the normalized entropy production is calculated from the effective temperatures of the hot and the cold subsystem in the steady state .",
    "the effective temperatures are obtained as an average over at least forty conformations separated by @xmath98 for chains of @xmath99 ( larger ensembles for shorter chains ) .",
    "the error bars in the entropy production ( normalized by the number of hot particles ) hence capture the ensemble variation due to conformational changes and related inherent velocity distribution of the particles of a given snapshot .    as mentioned in the main text the minimum entropy production principle ( mepp ) @xcite , where the phase segregation steady state should be the one in which the entropy production is minimal under the external constraints is applicable to gentle deviations from the equilibrium only . in our systems",
    "the temperature differences and gradients can be quite large as they take place on the particle scale .",
    "moreover close to equilibrium the entropy production is quadratic in the positions and velocities , while the mixed term is prohibited by requirement of non - negative entropy production upon time reversal ( velocity changing sign ) .",
    "also the entropy production must be positive if we interchange the roles of hot and cold reservoirs .",
    "as we showed , the position of the particle is coupled to the mean squared velocity of the local environment through the square of the effective temperature and therefore the validity of the mepp is not guaranteed .",
    "in separated state , it is expected to find a maxwellian velocity distribution as most of the particles belong to a bulk of a phase with the same particle type . for completeness , in fig .",
    "[ fig_vel_dist_sep ] we present a velocity distribution plot of the mixed state at time @xmath100 after the start of the simulation .",
    "this is long enough for the thermalization of the hot and cold subsystems ( for our choice of @xmath21 ) .",
    "the velocity distributions are still maxwellian , but the effective temperatures in the mixed state are further away from the thermostat temperatures as in the steady state .    .",

    "stiffness related effect arises from its dependence on temperature . in equilibrium systems ,",
    "stiffness difference of polymer species favours the phase separation due to entropic effects @xcite . to check if this effect plays a role in our system , we ran independent simulations of equilibrium systems of a 50:50 mixture of fully and semi - flexible chains with @xmath62 at temperature @xmath101 and friction @xmath102 .",
    "the ratio of the kuhn segment lengths is in this case @xmath103 @xcite .",
    "this is much larger than the one arising from our temperature differences @xmath104 ( measured as the ratio of the mean bond lengths of hot and cold chains in fully flexible system with @xmath105 ) , however the equilibrium system remained well mixed .",
    "this is consistent with the findings of @xcite for a slightly different polymer melt model .",
    "therefore the flexibility difference of the hot and cold chains does not affect significantly the observed phase separation .",
    "in symmetric equilibrium phase separation , the binodal has the form @xmath106 and the critical point is located at the composition @xmath107 @xcite . if for the different @xmath5 one finds the transition at a slightly different compositions @xmath108 , where @xmath109 , one obtains a correction to the scaling of @xmath110 with @xmath5 as @xmath111 .",
    "extrapolating @xmath110 to infinite @xmath5 from small values of @xmath5 would lead to an negative offset , quite the opposite to what is observed in our data .",
    "we briefly tested the metastability for @xmath56 chains by starting from a well separated conformation of @xmath112 , we switched the @xmath25 to values around the critical difference ( @xmath113 and @xmath114 ) and observed the evolutions .",
    "all the systems reached the same @xmath60 values as in the simulations that started from the mixed state .",
    "therefore , the metastable region is likely to be smaller than our temperature resolution . for longer chains",
    "however , this might be different . to get the transition point more",
    "precisely , one would need to probe the different compositions , which we leave for future work .",

    "the finite size effects are of three sources : @xmath26 short chain lengths @xmath5 , @xmath27 entropy production in the separated regime is affected by the interface contribution and @xmath28 fluctuations close to the @xmath59 are limited by the finite system size .",
    "to minimise the finite size effects , we used as large systems as possible while still being able to arrive at the steady states in reasonable computational time .",
    "as our results are consistent for @xmath117 , the short chain length effects are not significant for our main result that the critical activity ratio decreases with @xmath5 .",
    "the entropy production per particle in the phase separated regime has two contributions : @xmath118 contribution arising from the interface that spans the whole simulation box ( of size @xmath119 ) and scales as @xmath120 and @xmath121 contribution arising from the hot chains interspersed in the bulk cold phase ( and vice versa ) , which are independent of system size and scale with the number fraction of the two phases @xmath122 and @xmath123 . in the thermodynamic limit , for finite @xmath124",
    "the first contribution vanishes , while the second remains finite .",
    "then in the limit of @xmath125 , the number fractions @xmath122 and @xmath123 go to zero .",
    "this can be seen in the figure [ fig_temp_profile ] where effective temperature of a slab is plotted as function of the system coordinate perpendicular to the interface ( if this exists ) . there for ( high ) values of @xmath126 the effective temperature @xmath127 deep inside the hot phase ( @xmath128 ) is very close to the thermostat temperature .",
    "this shows that there are very few cold monomers in the hot phase .",
    "this suggest that even in thermodynamic and large @xmath58 limit one can extract the the critical activity ratio as a crossover between two regimes - possibly a peak in the entropy production .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the interface width is left for a future work .",
    "fully - flexible system as function of a system coordinate @xmath129 that is perpendicular to the interface .",
    "the effective temperatures are an average over @xmath13 configurations from steady state separated by @xmath130 , the error bars represent ensemble standard deviation . ]      to get an estimate of the extent of the finite size effects for our systems , we compared systems of @xmath131 chains and @xmath9 chains for the intermediate chain length @xmath56 .",
    "as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_fse ] , the mixed regime is very well reproducible as almost every monomer forms an interface between hot and cold constituents thus contributes to the entropy production . in the plateau regime , as expected the entropy production is lower for the larger system , which results in a shift of the critical activity ratio from about @xmath132 to @xmath133 .",
    "this is a relevant shift , but comparable to our temperature resolution of @xmath134 .",
    "the finite size effects related to critical fluctuations are a very well known problem in critical phenomena .",
    "as mentioned in the main text , in the case of equilibrium phase separation these can be partly circumvented by a semi - grandcanonical scheme , with finite size scaling of higher order cumulants of the order parameter .",
    "analogous scheme for the present non - equilibrium situation is not yet known .",

    "<S> recent theoretical studies found that mixtures of active and passive colloidal particles phase separate but only at very high activity ratio . </S>",
    "<S> the high value poses serious obstacles for experimental exploration of this phenomenon . </S>",
    "<S> here we show using simulations that when the active and passive particles are _ polymers _ , the critical activity ratio decreases with the polymer length . </S>",
    "<S> this not only facilitates the experiments but also has implications on the dna organization in living cell nuclei . </S>",
    "<S> entropy production can be used as an accurate indicator of this non - equilibrium phase transition .    </S>",
    "<S> active matter consists of microscopic constituents , such as bacteria , micro - swimmers or molecular motors that transform energy from the surroundings or their own sources into mechanical work . </S>",
    "<S> the energy is fed into the system on the particle scale producing local spatio - temporal gradients which give rise to a number of interesting macroscopic non - equilibrium phenomena such as emergence of spatial structures through dynamical phase transitions @xcite , directed rotational motion @xcite , propagating waves @xcite and phase separation of mixtures of active and passive particles with purely repulsive interactions @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the latter phenomenon , that we focus on here , is particularly interesting as often the active particles reside in a passive environment or the level of their activity is heterogeneous . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the mixture of active and passive polymers was hypothesised to play a role in the dna organization within the cell nucleus during the interphase ( metabolic phase of the cells life ) @xcite . indeed , dna transcription or the hypothesised active loop extrusion @xcite involve continual energy influx and dissipation on microscopic length scales . </S>",
    "<S> observations of living cells @xcite and the `` c - experiments '' @xcite confirm that euchromatin - the active dna , is colocalized and separated from the inactive denser heterochromatin by an unknown mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> the chemical difference of the hetero- and euchromatin @xcite could play a role in the chromatin separation @xcite , and , as first shown by ganai et al @xcite , the active process that we are focusing on here too , could bring an additional contribution to the separation .    </S>",
    "<S> recently , two works @xcite modelled active colloidal particles as having higher diffusivity as their passive counterparts , by simply connecting them to a higher temperature thermostat . </S>",
    "<S> both , simulations and analytical theory predict phase separation at a temperature ratio of about @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> similarly , high critical activity contrast is observed also for other , `` vectorial '' activity models such as active brownian particles ( abp ) @xcite ( pclet number over @xmath1 ) and vicsek model @xcite where the generated force or velocity acting on the particle has a specific direction that randomises on longer time scales . </S>",
    "<S> these models are more complex due to other effects like pressure dependence on the interaction details of the particles with the container @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus we here restrict ourselves to the simple but rich two temperature model and apply it to polymers . with the dna application in target , </S>",
    "<S> the work @xcite observed phase separation of partly active polymers , where some isolated monomers had temperature @xmath2 times higher than the ambient one . </S>",
    "<S> although hydrolysis of a single molecule of atp releases energy of about @xmath3 , this can not be completely spent on the increase of the kinetic energy of the dna . in any case , the factor of @xmath2 or @xmath0 of the critical activity contrast means , the active component in room temperature environment would have a temperature of about @xmath4 - certainly beyond biologically relevant scale of intracellular processes .    </S>",
    "<S> however , the polymer degrees of freedom of the particles can play a crucial role in decreasing the critical activity ratio to relevant scales . </S>",
    "<S> it is well known that in _ equilibrium _ phase separation of _ polymer _ mixtures , the critical flory interaction parameter , characterising the asymmetry of the interaction between the two polymer species and driving their segregation , is inversely proportional to the polymer length @xmath5 @xcite . there , to leading order , the entropy , driving the mixing , is proportional to number of chains @xmath6 , while the interaction , favouring the separation is proportional to @xmath7 , resulting in the @xmath8 dependence of the critical interaction parameter found in flory  huggins theory . </S>",
    "<S> naturally one asks : is there an analogous effect in the active polymer matter ? </S>",
    "<S> in other words , are for long ( bio)polymers small activity differences sufficient to drive phase separation ? </S>",
    "<S> this is what we set out to investigate .    </S>",
    "<S> to do so , we simulate monodisperse polymer melts of standard fully flexible and weakly semi - flexible bead spring systems @xcite , detailed in supplementary material ( sm ) @xcite , of @xmath9 chains of @xmath5 beads that have been frequently used to investigate _ equilibrium _ properties of dense polymeric systems . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate systems of @xmath10 , @xmath2 , @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 for flexible and additionally @xmath14 for semi - flexible chains at constant volume with bead density @xmath15 and periodic boundary conditions . </S>",
    "<S> chains are effectively uncrossable and the entanglement length is @xmath16 in the flexible and @xmath17 in the semi - flexible system @xcite . to model activity differences , @xmath18 `` cold '' chains are coupled to a langevin thermostat with temperature @xmath19 and the other `` hot '' chains to a langevin thermostat with @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> each chain is either completely hot or cold , different from @xcite where only the central monomer is active . </S>",
    "<S> the coupling with the thermostats is through friction coefficient @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> the choice of @xmath21 and the time step , besides the required stability of the simulation , is connected to the fact that the energy dissipation governed by @xmath21 is relevant for the specific interaction strength due to the heat transfer between the two species . </S>",
    "<S> since we are here looking at the chain length effect only , one should use the same @xmath21 and time step for all the temperatures and chain lengths . </S>",
    "<S> this is satisfied by a rather high friction coefficient @xmath22 and a time step @xmath23 . for comparison , </S>",
    "<S> the simulations in @xcite used brownian dynamics which corresponds to a high friction limit of molecular dynamics ( md ) that we do here . </S>",
    "<S> all our simulations were performed using the espresso++ simulation package @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as our polymers differ only by the thermostat , their phase separation and it s behaviour for different @xmath5 is a pure non - equilibrium effect arising from their different kinetic properties ( stiffness difference due to the temperature contrast is negligible - see sm ) .    </S>",
    "<S> we start from well mixed equilibrium configurations ( @xmath24 ) , then increase @xmath25 and let the system evolve until a steady state is reached , typically at a time chains need to diffuse through the whole system . in the steady state :    @xmath26 for high @xmath25 we find two liquids ( as both components are well above the glass transition point ) of different hot - cold composition . for temperatures close to the onset of segregation we observe slowing down of the evolution and large fluctuations ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s1 in sm ) .    </S>",

    "<S> @xmath28 simulations of systems with different @xmath5 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_chi_vs_n ] ) exhibit the decrease of the temperature range of the transition with @xmath5 .    in simple terms </S>",
    "<S> , separation emerges because hot particles exhibit larger effective excluded volume and `` entrap '' passive particles as illustrated in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hot particles exhibit higher pressure which is compensated by density change and phase separation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> still the mixing tendency is present and some chains diffuse in both temperature regions .     as function of @xmath25 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> a comparison of semi - flexible ( squares ) and fully - flexible ( circles ) chains shows systematically lower transition temperature for semi - flexible polymers . ]    commonly , one tracks phase separation by an order parameter based on the normalised number difference of the hot and the cold beads , @xmath29 in the @xmath30-th sub - box ( see sm for details ) . </S>",

    "<S> [ fig_phi_vs_t ] , where we plot @xmath31 i.e. @xmath32 averaged over all sub - boxes and over steady state configurations and subtract @xmath33 that is not exactly zero due to finite size effects . since we lack a classical ensemble we can not employ the usual semi - grandcanonical scheme of exchanging chain types , allowing to evaluate the order parameter and higher order cumulants for the whole system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this makes the @xmath34 analysis suitable for trend description only . </S>",

    "<S> moreover , because of finite friction @xmath21 , a small @xmath58 could lead to indistinguishable effective temperatures and the system would have no means to separate . additionally , as the transition is governed by the effective temperature difference , the choice of friction should not have a strong effect on the transition position in terms of @xmath53 , as opposed to @xmath58 .    the entropy production per hot particle in the steady state increases with @xmath53 , due to the growth of the heat flux , until @xmath59 , above which it plateaus as the interface between the phases develops ( fig .  [ fig_entropy_prod ] ) . therefore the critical activity ratio @xmath59 ( symbols in figure [ fig_chi_vs_n ] ) is extracted as a crossover point between these two regimes . by phase separation , </S>",
    "<S> the hot chains maintain higher effective temperature by avoiding contacts with the cold chains , thus reducing the entropy production .    as the entropy production per particle is an average quantity over all the particles it has the advantage over the simple estimate from the number difference as it is not affected by the finite size effects of the artificial division of the simulation box . on the other hand , in the separated regime , the entropy production in small systems is dominated by the interface and therefore the plateau value depends on the system size . in the infinite system size limit , the interface contribution vanishes and the entropy production per particle will be governed by the finite fraction of the hot chains interspersed in the cold phase ( and vice versa ) . </S>",
    "<S> but even in thermodynamic limit the critical activity ratio would still be the crossover between two regimes ( see sm ) . to quantify the interface effect , in sm we compare the entropy production per particle for two different system sizes and find that although the effect is relevant , the shift in the critical activity ratio is within our temperature precision . </S>",
    "<S> to overcome the difficulties , rather than going to larger system sizes it would be highly desirable to invent a method similar to semi - grandcanonical scheme for equilibrium phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> this we leave for future work .     </S>",
    "<S> is plotted as function of @xmath8 for semi - flexible ( squares ) and fully - flexible ( circles ) chains . </S>",
    "<S> red marks delimit the range of the largest gradient of order parameter @xmath60 extracted from fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_phi_vs_t ] ( sm ) , symbols represent @xmath59 extracted from the entropy production rate @xmath50 ( see text ) . for @xmath14 , the chains typically diffused only half of the box size , thus did not reach completely a steady state for all @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> based on the time profile of @xmath61 ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> s2 in sm ) we marked the expected range of @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> green dashed line connects the origin with the point @xmath59 at @xmath62 , black dot - dashed line is a linear function with an offset . </S>",
    "<S> inset : the same data are plotted as function of @xmath63 , blue dotted line connects the origin with the point @xmath59 at @xmath62 . ]    in analogy to equilibrium phase separation , there is a competition between the tendency to mix arising from the heat baths proportional to the number of chains and the tendency to avoid unfavourable contacts proportional to the number of monomers , thus one could expect @xmath64 , i.e. @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , our data ( fig .  [ fig_chi_vs_n ] ) are not perfectly consistent with this trend . </S>",
    "<S> we approximately observe a linear ( @xmath8 ) regime , but the extrapolation leads to a nonzero @xmath59 at infinite @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> this would mean that for infinitely long polymers one needs a finite difference of effective temperatures to drive segregation , which seems counter - intuitive . </S>",
    "<S> in the inset of fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig_chi_vs_n ] we plot the same data of @xmath59 as function of @xmath66 , which agrees with the trend for the longest chain lengths as well as the expected infinite chain length limit . </S>",
    "<S> there are several possible explanations for this observation :    @xmath26 finite size effects and nucleation : even for our relatively large systems the effect of the interface has a relevant contribution to the entropy production in the separated regime ( see sm ) and one can expect the offset to decrease in the infinite system size limit . moreover , at constant @xmath67 but very small @xmath53 , nucleation processes might be necessary for the separation to occur @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the velocity distributions overlap strongly at low @xmath53 and only a small fraction of hot particles is significantly hotter than the cold particles . </S>",
    "<S> therefore their nucleation becomes unlikely , especially when the total number of particles is limited .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath27 mixing tendency grows with @xmath53 : the work @xcite found for low densities that the separation of a system of spherical particles is governed by a free energy - like function with a term that favours mixing but grows with @xmath53 . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , unlike in equilibrium phase transition , @xmath53 does not govern the separation tendency only .    </S>",
    "<S> @xmath28 critical phase composition depends on @xmath53 ( even for 50:50 mixture ) . in equilibrium phase transition with _ symmetric </S>",
    "<S> _ interactions ( i.e. interactions between like types of polymers are the same ) , the phase diagram is symmetric around the critical point located at the composition @xmath68 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , here the hot and cold phase have slightly different densities depending on @xmath53 . at different @xmath5 , we probe different temperature ranges ( and partial densities ) and therefore we look at a binodal at slightly different relative volume fractions </S>",
    "<S> . however , for equilibrium phase transition this effect should decrease the apparent @xmath69 ( see sm ) . the asymmetry causes that our 50:50 mixture likely probes the critical point only in the limit of @xmath70 , which also raises metastability issues . </S>",
    "<S> we briefly tested this for @xmath56 ( see sm ) and found the metastable region to be smaller than our temperature resolution . for longer chains </S>",
    "<S> however , this might be different .    </S>",
    "<S> the reduction of the entropy production rate in the separated state is interesting in the context of the minimum entropy production principle @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this , however , is applicable close to equilibrium only , while in our case the temperature differences and gradients take place on the particle scale and therefore can be quite large . </S>",
    "<S> thus it would be interesting to look at much longer chains , and other models of activity especially active - ornstein - uhlenbeck particles ( aoup ) @xcite where one controls the distance from equilibrium by persistence time characterising the velocity auto - correlation . for small persistence times </S>",
    "<S> one can define an effective temperature in a _ </S>",
    "<S> pure _ aoup system @xcite and it exhibits vanishing entropy production @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . therefore it would be very interesting to see if the entropy production description also applies to passive - aoup _ mixtures _ or to what extent this would be violated by the non - boltzmann distribution of the aoups . </S>",
    "<S> another interesting and possibly relevant extension would be to incorporate velocity correlations along the chain @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> consistent with symmetry considerations ( sm ) , our data suggest that the entropy production scales as @xmath71 for small @xmath53 . entropy produced on the relevant microscopic timescale @xmath72 i.e. @xmath73 competes with the mixing entropy proportional to @xmath74 only . </S>",
    "<S> here for small enough @xmath53 the constant @xmath75 should be close to average thermostat temperature and independent of @xmath53 . if this applies , it results in @xmath76 scaling consistent with our results .    </S>",
    "<S> our computational study uncovers a novel effect in the activity - driven phase separation . </S>",
    "<S> the strong decrease of the critical activity with the length of the polymers makes the active process relevant in the chromatin ( self)organization thus bridging the structure with the genome function . </S>",
    "<S> moreover it facilitates the experimental exploration in artificial systems like @xcite and could pave a way for new polymeric active materials . </S>",
    "<S> already the present simplest model opens a fascinating branch in polymer physics , and allows one to use its tools to search for and understand new phenomena out of equilibrium . </S>"
