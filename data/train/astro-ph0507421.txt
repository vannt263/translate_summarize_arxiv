    "structure of the interstellar medium ( ism ) is a key issue in the understanding of our galaxy . a large fraction of the interstellar space is occupied with warm ( @xmath3 ) and hot ( @xmath4 ) media .",
    "the origin of the hot component is the energy released from supernovae and/or stellar winds .",
    "shock waves of the supernova remnants ( snrs ) hit the interstellar gas to heat it up and to sweep it into a dense shell .",
    "the evolution of snrs has been studied for many years .",
    "after the shock expansion speed decelerates below @xmath5 , the gas passed through the shock front is quickly cooled and a dense shell forms .",
    "the expansion of the shell is decelerated as the interstellar gas accumulates .",
    "finally , the expansion speed of the shock front reaches the random speed of turbulent motion in the ism and the shock wave decays to a sound wave .",
    "the interstellar magnetic field is seen at a glance to run in a direction parallel to the galactic disk . as for the strength , combining rotation and dispersion measures , @xcite obtained a turbulent field strength of @xmath6 and its cell size of @xmath755 pc .",
    "the energy density of the magnetic field @xmath8 attains that of the ism turbulent motion @xmath9 with a density @xmath10 as @xmath11 and an interstellar thermal energy @xmath12 @xmath13 .",
    "these three energies are in approximate equipartition .",
    "this seems to indicate the magnetic field plays an important role in the ism .",
    "at the same time , the late evolutionary phase of snrs must also be significantly affected by the interstellar magnetic field .",
    "magnetic snrs were first studied by @xcite using spherically symmetric one - dimensional hydro simulations including only the magnetic pressure force .",
    "@xcite pointed out the effects of the magnetic field as ( 1 ) an snr forms a thick shell supported by the magnetic pressure force ; ( 2 ) the hot gas heated by the shock wave in the adiabatic phase occupies the interior of the snr .",
    "this hot cavity is effectively re - compressed in the later phase by the effect of the magnetic pressure from their spherically symmetric calculations .",
    "similar one - dimensional simulations have also been done by @xcite .",
    "the tension force of the magnetic field has similar effects , broadening the shell and compressing the hot bubble , but is not included in these spherically symmetric simulations .",
    "at least two - dimensional magnetohydrodynamical ( mhd ) simulations are necessary .",
    "@xcite have studied the evolution of snrs expanding in the magnetic turbulent ism using three - dimensional mhd simulations and they have explained the evolution of snrs in the thermal x - ray and non - thermal radio continuum .",
    "however , their study is restricted to the adiabatic stage . in the present paper",
    ", we explore the total evolution of snrs in the magnetized ism using axisymmetric mhd simulations .",
    "the late phase evolution of snrs is essential to understanding of the structure of the ism @xcite .",
    "for example , hot ionized gas is believed to be confined in the cavities of snrs , especially in large - volume old snrs .",
    "however , the volumes of the hot cavities must be strongly affected by the interstellar magnetic field strength .",
    "we devote particular attention to the late - phase evolution of snrs .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in @xmath142 , model and numerical method are described .",
    "section 3 shows numerical result .",
    "we pay special attention to the comparison between models with strong and weak magnetic field .",
    "it is shown that the evolution of snrs is also affected by the ism density and local heating rates .",
    "expansion laws of the snr shell and hot cavity are also shown in @xmath143 .",
    "section 4 is devoted to discussion on how the volume fraction of the hot ism is affected by the magnetic field strength .",
    "the reason why the shell density of snr is determined is also discussed in @xmath144 .",
    "we assume that a uniform interstellar gas with density @xmath15 and magnetic field strength @xmath16 is extending .",
    "the half - width at half - maximum of the thick gaussian component and the scale - height of the exponential component of the hi disk are equal to 265 pc and 403 pc , respectively @xcite .",
    "since the size of the snr is smaller than the scale - height of the hi , @xmath17 , in this paper , we ignore the effect of the density stratification in the @xmath18-direction , which becomes important after the size of the bubble exceeds several times @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the scale - height of the magnetic field is believed to be much larger than that of the gas .",
    "we assume here a uniform density and a uniform magnetic field strength .",
    "the basic equations are the ideal mhd equations . using",
    "the cylindrical coordinates @xmath19 , assuming that we have no toroidal components of velocity and magnetic field @xmath20 and that variables are independent from the azimuth angle @xmath21 as @xmath22 , the basic equations are as follows : @xmath23 @xmath24 @xmath25   = \\frac{1}{r}\\left(p + \\frac{{b_r}^2 + { b_z}^2}{8\\pi}\\right ) \\label{eqn : eq - motion - r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath26 = \\gamma_0 n_{\\rm h}-\\lambda ( t){n_{\\rm h}}^2   \\label{eqn : thermal}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath27    @xmath28    where the variables have their ordinary meanings as @xmath29 ( density ) , @xmath30 ( velocity ) , @xmath31 ( pressure ) , @xmath32 ( temperature ) , @xmath33 ( magnetic flux density ) , and @xmath34 ( internal plus kinetic energy per unit volume ) . equation ( [ eqn : rho ] ) is the continuity equation ; equations ( [ eqn : eq - motion - z ] ) and ( [ eqn : eq - motion - r ] ) are the equations of motion ; equation ( [ eqn : thermal ] ) represents the energy conservation equation for internal plus kinetic energy .",
    "the induction equations for the poloidal magnetic fields are equations ( [ eqn : induction - eq - z ] ) and ( [ eqn : induction - eq - r ] ) .",
    "the terms @xmath35 and @xmath36 in equation ( [ eqn : thermal ] ) represent , respectively , the heating and radiative cooling rates , where @xmath37 means the number density of the hydrogen atoms .",
    "we use the radiative cooling rate estimated for the gas in the collisional ionization equilibrium with the solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "we employ here the modified lax - wendroff scheme @xcite , an explicit finite - difference method , to solve the basic equations ( [ eqn : rho])-([eqn : induction - eq - r ] ) .",
    "the number of grids and grid spacings are chosen as @xmath38 and @xmath39 pc .",
    "thus , our numerical domain covers a region of 250 pc @xmath40 250 pc .",
    "artificial viscosity is added to smooth the jump at the shock front .",
    "for all the quantities @xmath41 ( @xmath29 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , ) , we added an extra term to express artificial diffusion and solve equations like @xmath44 where we take @xmath45^{1/2}\\delta^2,\\ ] ] with @xmath46 and @xmath47 .",
    "the numerical scheme was tested by comparing known solutions which have been analytically and numerically obtained .",
    "we checked the program by comparing ( 1 ) the adiabatic snr with the sedov solution @xcite , ( 2 ) the spherically symmetric snr with previously calculated @xcite and ( 3 ) mhd shock tube problems @xcite .",
    "the analytical solution of ( 1 ) is reproduced within a 5% relative error , for example , pressure and density distributions .",
    "the expansion law of the shock front of hydrodynamical snrs of ( 2 ) coincides with previous work ( such as that by @xcite ) and the difference is not more than 5% for @xmath48 .",
    "we assume a uniform ism with number density @xmath49 and temperature @xmath50 .",
    "a uniform magnetic field is running in the @xmath18-direction as @xmath51 .",
    "as for the radiative cooling rate , we use a spline function fit of cooling curves obtained by @xcite ( @xmath52 ) and by @xcite ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "we summarize the parameters used in table [ tab:1 ] .",
    "the heating coefficient @xmath54 is chosen as follows : in models a - h ( see table [ tab:1 ] ) , the heating rate @xmath55 is balanced by the cooling rate @xmath56 in the ambient ism . on the other hand ,",
    "it is set to be @xmath57 in models aw - hw ( see table [ tab:1 ] ) as minimum heating rate given by cosmic - ray @xcite .",
    "we begin the simulation by adding thermal energy of @xmath58 within the sphere of 2pc in radius .",
    "we assume a 10:1 h to he number ratio , which leads to a mean molecular weight for nuclei of @xmath59 and that for fully - ionized ions and electrons of @xmath60 , and the number density of the hydrogen atoms of @xmath61 , where @xmath62 means the number density of the gas .",
    "in model a , we studied a magnetized ism with @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and @xmath65 , which mimics the warm ionized ism . with a magnetic pressure of @xmath66 and a thermal pressure of @xmath67 @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70 @xmath71 @xmath69 @xmath72 ,",
    "the plasma beta of the ism is equal to @xmath73 @xmath72 @xmath74 . in figure",
    "[ fig:1 ] , we plotted cross - cut views along the @xmath18- ( a and c ) and the @xmath75-axes ( b and d ) .",
    "upper panels ( a and b ) display density distributions , while the lower ones ( c and d ) display temperature distributions .",
    "the shell formation time at which the snr changes its structure from the adiabatic sedov phase @xcite to the pressure - driven snowplow phase is given @xcite as @xmath76 the first snapshot ( @xmath77 ; solid line ) corresponds to the final stage of the adiabatic phase or the transition stage to the pressure - driven snow - plow phase .",
    "figure [ fig:1 ] shows that the differences in the @xmath18- and @xmath75-cross - cuts are slight at this stage . a dip in the temperature distribution just after the shock front indicates that the radiative cooling begins to play a part at this stage .",
    "the second snapshot at @xmath78 shows clearly that a thin shell is formed [ fig.[fig:1](a ) and ( b ) ] . at this stage ,",
    "figure [ fig:1](a ) and ( b ) indicates that the shell is thin and its widths propagating in @xmath18- and @xmath75-directions are similar .",
    "the temperature distributions also look similar to each other [ fig.[fig:1](c ) and ( d ) ] .",
    "peak density in the shell reaches maximum at this stage and declines gradually for the shell near the @xmath75-axis [ fig.[fig:1](b ) ] , while it increases further for the shell propagating near the @xmath18-axis [ fig.[fig:1](a ) ] until @xmath79 .    at the age of @xmath80 ( dashed line )",
    ", the snr shows a shape far from spherical symmetry , that is , the shock front reaches @xmath81 pc while @xmath82 pc .",
    "the shell width in the @xmath75-direction @xmath83 becomes much wider than that in the @xmath18-direction @xmath84 ( short - dashed line ) as @xmath85 pc while @xmath86 pc .",
    "the shape of the cavity which contains a hot low - density gas indicates an elongated shape along the @xmath18-axis .",
    "that is , the bubble ( @xmath87 ) half radius is equal to @xmath88 while @xmath89 .",
    "this difference in @xmath18- and @xmath75-directions comes from the effect of magnetic pressure which works to confine the gas in the @xmath75-direction .",
    "the post - shock thermal pressure ( not shown ) reaches @xmath90 on the @xmath18-axis , while it is equal to @xmath91 for the shock propagating perpendicularly to the magnetic field ( along the @xmath75-axis ) . in a case",
    "in which the magnetic field is parallel to the shock front , which is applicable to the shock expanding in the @xmath75-direction , the post - shock to pre - shock pressure ratio is given using the plasma beta of the pre - shock gas @xmath92 and the mach number of shock propagation speed @xmath93 [ the rankin - hugoniot relation , see eq.([eqn : y ] ) ] . since part of the pressure",
    "is attributed to the magnetic one , the post - shock thermal pressure of the magnetic shock must be lower than that of the non - magnetic one ( the ratio of post - shock thermal pressure of the magnetic shock to that of the non - magnetic shock is plotted in fig.[fig : a1 ] ) . with the plasma @xmath94 of the ism @xmath95 ( model a ) and",
    "the mach number of the shock speed @xmath96 of @xmath97 at @xmath98 ( @xmath99 denotes the adiabatic thermal speed ) , equation ( [ eqn : y ] ) anticipates that the thermal pressure of magnetized post - shock gas is 0.36 times smaller than that of the non - magnetized one .",
    "this demonstrates that the post - shock magnetic field plays an essential role in determining the shock structure at this stage .",
    "the shell width continues to increase with time in both @xmath18- and @xmath75-directions . even in the @xmath18-direction , the shell width increases",
    "this is understood as follows : in the case of hydrodynamic shock , the shell is confined under the effect of the post - shock pressure and the thermal pressure of the hot interior gas .",
    "ram pressure working at the front of the shell , which is proportional to the shock speed squared , decreases with time , since the expansion of the shock front is decelerated . at the same time",
    ", the thermal pressure in the hot interior gas also decreases owing to the adiabatic expansion .",
    "these thicken the shell thick @xcite . in the @xmath75-direction ,",
    "the magnetic force prevents the shell from being compressed and works to support the shell .",
    "the width of the shell increases owing to the decrease in the confining pressures and the difference between the shells propagating in @xmath18- and @xmath75-directions comes from the magnetic force .    in figures [ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] , we plotted density distributions , total ( thermal + magnetic ) pressure distributions and magnetic field lines . for each snapshot ,",
    "the cross - cut views are shown in figure [ fig:1 ] .",
    "figures [ fig:2](a ) and [ fig:3](a ) show the structure of snrs at the final stage of the adiabatic phase ( @xmath77 ) . the interior pressure ( mainly thermal )",
    "predominates over the ism pressure and the snr holds the spherical symmetry .",
    "the shell thickness is approximately equal to 10% of the radius , which decreases to form a cooled shell [ figs . [",
    "fig:2](b ) and [ fig:3](b ) ; @xmath78 ] .",
    "the snr looks spherically symmetric in the adiabatic phase , even with the magnetic field .",
    "compared with panels ( c ) of @xmath98 , it is shown that the shell width increases with time in the pressure - driven snow - plow phase after the cool shell formation , especially in the @xmath75-direction .    as is shown in figure [ fig:1 ]",
    ", the distance of the shock front from the explosion site reaches @xmath81pc in the @xmath75-direction , while @xmath82pc in the @xmath18-direction ( panels c of @xmath98 ) .",
    "this means that the shock wave propagates faster in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field than in the parallel direction .",
    "since the magnetic field lines are bent reaching the shock front after passing the shock front , the shock running outward is a fast shock .",
    "the phase velocity of the fast wave increases in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field .",
    "it is natural that the fast shock propagates faster in the @xmath75-direction than in the @xmath18-direction .",
    "thermal pressure in the hot low - density cavity is twice as high as the total pressure @xmath101 of the ism at this phase .",
    "however , it becomes lower than the total pressure of the ism after @xmath102 . around this equilibrium epoch",
    ", the hot cavity begins to contract in the @xmath75-direction , while in the @xmath18-direction , the inner boundary of the shell continues to expand .",
    "figures [ fig:2](d ) and [ fig:3](d ) show the structure at @xmath103 , at which the snapshot is also made in figure [ fig:1 ] ( dash - dotted line ) . as indicated by a magnetic field line running nearest to the @xmath18-axis in these figures , the inner boundary of the shell contracts radially between @xmath80 ( @xmath104 pc ) and @xmath103 ( @xmath105 pc ) , while the outward - facing shock front continues to expand from @xmath81pc at @xmath98 to @xmath106pc at @xmath107 . the portion traced by the above nearest magnetic field line corresponds to the temperature jump between a gas in the shell @xmath108k and a hot gas in the cavity @xmath109k .",
    "as for the expansion in the @xmath18-direction , the temperature transition located near @xmath110 pc ( @xmath80 ) expands to @xmath111 pc ( @xmath103 ) shown in figure [ fig:1](c ) , while the cavity contracts in the @xmath75-direction as the radial size of the cavity decreases from @xmath104 pc at @xmath98 to @xmath105 pc at @xmath107 shown in figure [ fig:1](d ) .",
    "this indicates that the expansion of the hot gas is prevented by the effect of the magnetic field in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field . as for the shock front ,",
    "panels ( d ) show that the angle measured from the shock normal vector to the pre - shock magnetic field line is positive for @xmath112 pc .",
    "in other words , the magnetic field component parallel to the shock front does not change its sign passing through the shock front .",
    "this is characteristic of the fast shock , while in the region near the @xmath18-axis ( @xmath113 pc ) , the parallel components have different signs comparing the pre- and post - shock magnetic fields .",
    "thus , this part of the shock is the intermediate shock @xcite .",
    "the structure at @xmath114 is shown in figures [ fig:1 ] ( long dashed line ) , [ fig:2](e ) and [ fig:3](e ) .",
    "the expansion of the front continues . in the thick diffuse shell propagating in the @xmath75-direction",
    ", the thermal pressure has an excess of only @xmath115 10% over the ism and the excess total pressure in the shell is at most @xmath115 20% of the ism , even including the magnetic pressure .",
    "the shock is weak .",
    "the expansion in the @xmath75-direction is steadily decelerated till @xmath114 .",
    "although the deceleration along the @xmath18-axis continues for @xmath116 , the expansion speed becomes constant @xmath117 after @xmath118 .",
    "the shell propagating along the @xmath18-axis is not decelerated for @xmath118 .",
    "this may seem strange .",
    "however , this can be explained as follows : the mechanical equilibrium in the @xmath75-direction requires that the thermal pressure in the hot low - density cavity @xmath119 , where the magnetic field is weak , is in pressure equilibrium with the total pressure of the ism as @xmath120 in the late phase of snrs .",
    "this leads to a thermal pressure imbalance of @xmath121 .",
    "this difference of @xmath122 pushes the shell near the @xmath18-axis , where no magnetic force works .",
    "the equation of motion for the part expanding along the @xmath18-axis is written @xmath123 where @xmath124 represents the column density of @xmath125 .",
    "constant force per unit area drives the mass - accumulating shell to move with a constant velocity as @xmath126 .      to see the departure from the spherically symmetric snr more quantitatively",
    ", we define the ellipticity of the snr shell as @xmath127 where @xmath128 and @xmath129 are the distances from the explosion site along the @xmath18- and @xmath75-axes and the distance is measured for the point at which the density changes from that of the ism in the cross - cuts by more than 1% ( fig.[fig:1 ] ) . as for the bubble , its ellipticity is calculated as @xmath130 where @xmath131 and @xmath132 are the distances from the surface of the bubble to the explosion site .",
    "the surface of the bubble is defined using the temperature isosurface of @xmath133k and the iso - density surface with the same density as the ism @xmath49 as @xmath134 @xmath135 where the former temperature isosurface indicates the surface in the pressure - driven phase ( @xmath136 ) while the latter density isosurface does that in the adiabatic stage .",
    "we found the minimum of these two gives the bubble surface appropriately .",
    "it should be noted that these two factors are chosen to be smaller than unity for ordinary magnetized snrs ( @xmath137 while @xmath138 ) .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] plots ellipticities @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "after @xmath136 , @xmath139 begins to decrease and reaches @xmath141 after @xmath142 .",
    "this shows that the maximum difference between @xmath129 and @xmath128 is 20% and the snr is observed as elongated in the @xmath75-direction ( an oblate spheroidal shape ) , if we take the shock front .",
    "asymmetry in the _ bubble _ shape also appears @xmath136 and grows steadily .",
    "the bubble shrinks in the @xmath75-direction to form a very thin cigar - like structure @xmath143 . the hot cavity in the pressure - driven expansion phase forms a prolate spheroid .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] also plots the ratio of the bubble radius to the shell radius in respective directions as @xmath144 and @xmath145 since in the sedov phase the shell size is approximately equal to one - twelfth of the shock radius @xmath146 @xcite , @xmath147 and @xmath148 keep constant @xmath149 in the adiabatic phase @xmath150 . as a cool shell forms , the difference between the shock radius and that of the hot cavity decreases .",
    "the quantities @xmath147 and @xmath148 reach @xmath151 at the age of @xmath152 .",
    "the shell width near the @xmath18-axis ( @xmath153 ) continues to be thin for @xmath154 and increases gradually after @xmath155 . on the other hand ,",
    "the shell width in the @xmath75-direction ( @xmath156 ) increases steadily after @xmath136 ( @xmath148 decreases monotonically ) .",
    "figure [ fig:4 ] shows us that asymmetry from the spherically symmetric expansion begins just after the effective radiative cooling forms a thin shell .",
    "the diffuse shell formation owing to the magnetic field is triggered just after this shell formation .      in this section ,",
    "we describe model c with a weak magnetic field of @xmath157 .",
    "other parameters are the same as model a. since the magnetic pressure of the ism is equal to @xmath158 , the plasma @xmath94 of the ism is as large as @xmath159 . before and at the thin shell formation stage [ fig . [",
    "fig:5](a ) and ( b ) ] , the snr is spherically symmetric and looks very similar to model a ( first two panels of figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] ) .",
    "however , although the structure of the magnetized snr in @xmath63 ( model a ) is far from being the spherically symmetric in the pressure - driven expansion stage [ last three panels of figs .",
    "[ fig:2 ] and [ fig:3 ] ] , the snr in a weak magnetic field ( model c ) remains its shape spherically symmetric [ fig .",
    "[ fig:5](c ) and ( d ) ] .",
    "for example , at @xmath160 , the shell extends in the @xmath75-direction from 65 to 89 pc and in the @xmath18-direction from 70 to 85 pc .    in figure 4 ( b )",
    ", we plot the ratio of bubble - to - shock radii , and major - to - minor axis ratio of the shock front and the bubble for model c. compared with figure 4 ( a ) of model a , although the ratio of bubble - to - shock radii is as small as @xmath161 at the age of @xmath162 for model a , it is @xmath163 for model c. this means that the thickness of the shell , which propagates in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field ( @xmath75-direction ) , is much reduced in model c. the bubble begins to contract after @xmath164 , which is much longer than that of model a @xmath165 .",
    "the difference comes from the effect of the magnetic force working to compress the bubble . in both models",
    "a and c , @xmath148 decreases with time and reaches 0.1 in @xmath166 ( model a ) and @xmath167 ( model c ) .",
    "as for the same ratio for the parallel ( @xmath18-)direction , both models have similar values as @xmath168 for model a and @xmath169 for model c at the age of @xmath162 .",
    "however , although model a remains at @xmath170 for the final phase @xmath171 , @xmath147 continues to decrease in model c and @xmath172 for @xmath173 .",
    "this means the shell propagating along the @xmath18-axis is confined to being thin in model a , while the shell thickness increases with time in model c. in the last paragraph of section 3.1 , we already mentioned that the expansion of the shell propagating in the @xmath18-direction is driven by the thermal pressure in the bubble , which is sustained by the radial compression due to the magnetic force .",
    "this seems to have the effect of keeping the shell that is propagating in the @xmath18-direction thin .      in this section ,",
    "the models with high ism density @xmath174 are shown .",
    "model e has the same parameters as model a except for the interstellar density .",
    "the heating rate is taken to be 5 times larger than model a to keep @xmath65 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn:1 ] ) gives the timescale to enter the pressure - driven snow - plow phase from the sedov stage as @xmath175 , which is three times shorter than the models with low density @xmath64 .",

    "this timescale is almost the same as that of model a ( @xmath180 ) , even if the adiabatic to pressure - driven transition timescale @xmath181 is three times shorter than low - density model a. at this stage , the asymmetry between @xmath18- and @xmath75-directions has developed .",
    "that is , the shell width of the @xmath75-direction @xmath182 and that of the @xmath18-direction @xmath183 differ . and",
    "as a consequence , the shell propagating in the @xmath18-direction is thin , while that propagating in the @xmath75-direction is thick .",

    "although the height of the bubble @xmath131 differs several % , the radius of the bubble @xmath132 differs only slightly . on the other hand ,",
    "the sizes of the bubbles of models c and cw are different , as the bubble size differs @xmath192 for both @xmath132 and @xmath131 .    to closely see model a , as for the structure along the @xmath75-axis , the shell ( @xmath193 ) in model a has a temperature of @xmath194 , while that for model aw is as low as @xmath195 owing to inefficient heating . as a result ,",
    "the thermal pressure of model a [ @xmath196 is much higher than that of model aw , and decreases from the post - shock value of @xmath197 to @xmath198 near the bubble boundary .",
    "although the thermal pressure differs one order of magnitude , the expansion of the bubble is unchanged .",
    "this is owing to the fact that magnetic pressure is dominant in the shell of these models .    as for the structure along the @xmath18-axis ,",
    "the temperature of the shell of model aw ( @xmath199 ) is much lower than that of model a ( @xmath200 ) .",
    "however , the thermal pressures in the shell look similar , as follows : @xmath201 ( model a ) and @xmath202 ( model aw ) .",
    "further , those in the bubble are equal to @xmath203 ( model a ) and @xmath204 ( model aw ) . since the thermal pressure in the bubble is driving the shell in the @xmath18-direction",
    ", this similarity explains the fact that the expansion is very similar even if @xmath54 changes 10 times . as a result",
    ", it is concluded that the evolution does not depend on the heating rate for models with strong magnetic fields of @xmath205 .    in figure [ fig:8 ] , we plot the thermal pressure ( a)-(b ) and temperature distributions ( c)-(d ) of models c and cw . before and at the shell formation stage ( solid and dotted lines ) the two evolutions are the same , since the heating rate has no effect on evolution at this stage . after the shell formation ( dashed , dash - dotted , and long dashed lines ) ,",
    "these two models show different evolutions . at @xmath107 ,",
    "the bubble occupies @xmath206 in model c while @xmath207 in model cw , measured from the radius with a steep temperature gradient . at @xmath114 , these are @xmath208 in model c and @xmath206 in model cw ( see also fig.[fig:9 ] ) .",
    "this shows that the bubble shrinks to a greater degree in models with strong heating rates .",
    "structures in the shell are significantly different : the thermal pressure and the temperature in model cw are much lower than those in model c. the low heating rate leads the shell to be cool and under low pressure .",
    "high pressure in the shell hinders the expansion of the bubble in model c and thus the bubble size is reduced .",
    "the fact that the pressure in the shell controls the bubble radius means the contraction of the bubble is partly owing to the gas pressure in the shell . as a result",
    ", we conclude that for models with weak magnetic field @xmath209 , the shell thickness increases and bubble size decreases as the heating rate increases .    comparing models",
    "e and ew with @xmath174 , even in the models with @xmath210=5@xmath211 g , the size of the bubble depends on the heating rate as @xmath132=26.3 pc ( model e ) , 29.9 pc ( model ew ) at @xmath212yr .",
    "the radius of the bubble differs @xmath213 for @xmath132 between models e and ew , and the total pressure along the @xmath75-axis in model e is twice as high as that in model ew at @xmath212yr .",
    "the difference seems to come from a large difference in @xmath54 ( @xmath54=@xmath214 for model e and @xmath215 for model ew ) . in high - density models ,",
    "the effect of @xmath54 exceeds that of the magnetic field , and the evolution of the bubble is different in models e and ew , in contrast to models a and aw .      in figure [ fig:9 ] , we plot the expansion law of the shell @xmath128 and @xmath129 for respective directions of @xmath18- and @xmath75-axes as well as that of the bubble @xmath131 and @xmath132 for various models .",
    "figure [ fig:9](a ) shows that the expansion of the shock front @xmath129 is affected by the magnetic strength , if @xmath49 and @xmath216 are chosen to be the same .",
    "that is , the expansion is promoted with the strength of the magnetic field .",
    "this is related to the fact that the phase speed of the magneto - sonic wave propagating in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field increases with the magnetic strength .",
    "however , the expansion of @xmath129 is independent of the value of the heating rate .    as for the shell expanding along the @xmath18-axis [ fig.[fig:9](b ) ] , the models with @xmath205 show expansions different from those of from the models with weaker magnetic fields @xmath217 .",
    "the expansion of @xmath205 is promoted by the strength of the magnetic field , while the expansion speed in @xmath128 for @xmath218 finally approaches the adiabatic thermal speed @xmath99 .",
    "it has been pointed out that the late - phase expansion of @xmath128 with constant speed comes from the excess thermal pressure inside the bubble , which pushes the shell in the @xmath18-direction ( @xmath14[sec : model a ] ) .",
    "since the excess thermal pressure is well approximated by the ambient magnetic pressure as @xmath219 , this excess becomes greater than the ambient thermal pressure @xmath220 only for @xmath221 .",
    "this seems to explain the numerical result that the difference in @xmath128 disappears for @xmath218 .",
    "figure [ fig:9](c ) and ( d ) shows the bubble sizes measured along the @xmath75- and @xmath18-axes , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig:9](c ) shows the expansion of @xmath132 .",
    "this shows that the magnetic field suppresses the expansion of the bubble radius @xmath132 , especially in the late phase evolution .",
    "this is a natural consequence of the fact that the contraction of the bubble is driven by the magnetic pressure and tension forces . besides this",
    ", there is a clear difference in the expansions of models with strong heating ( models a - d ) and weak heating ( models aw - dw ) . especially in models",
    "b(w ) - d(w ) with @xmath222 , models with weak heating have larger radii @xmath132 compared with those with strong heating .",
    "since @xmath129 is not affected with @xmath54 , this means that the shell becomes thinner in models with lower heating rates , for weak magnetic field models @xmath222 .",
    "the fact that the shell density is higher in the weakly heated models bw - dw than in the strongly heated b - d is explained by the fact that higher density is necessary to equilibrate heating and cooling in the shell , which will be discussed in @xmath14[sec:4.2 ] .",
    "figure [ fig:9](d ) shows the expansion of @xmath131 .",
    "there are two distinctly different evolutions of the bubble expansion in the @xmath18-direction . in models with @xmath223 , @xmath131 [ models a(w ) and b(w ) ]",
    "continues to expand . on the other hand , in models with @xmath224 ,",
    "@xmath131 expands first but contracts after @xmath225 [ models c(w ) and d(w ) ] .",
    "although all models c , cw , d , and dw show contraction in the final stage , the models with ineffective heating ( cw and dw ) have larger bubble sizes in the @xmath18-direction than those with effective heating ( models c and d ) , respectively .",
    "this indicates models c and d have thicker shells than models cw and dw , respectively .",
    "this is similar to the shells expanding in the @xmath75-direction . in models with strong magnetic field",
    ", @xmath131 is larger for stronger magnetic field .",
    "this may seem strange , since the magnetic field has no force working in the @xmath18-direction near the @xmath18-axis .",
    "however , as already seen , the bubble is contracting in the @xmath75-direction owing to the magnetic tension force for @xmath118 for models a(w ) and b(w ) [ fig.[fig:9](c ) ] .",
    "the thermal pressure in the hot interior , which mainly drives the shell near the @xmath18-axis , increases with increasing magnetic field strength .",
    "this explains the fact that the inner boundary of the shell @xmath131 expands faster for stronger magnetic fields in the models with a non - negligible magnetic field of @xmath2 .",
    "to understand the structure of ism , the volume fraction of the hot gas @xmath226 is a key issue .",
    "the fraction of volumes covered by the hot cavities of snrs is estimated by a quantity called porosity , which is defined as @xmath227 where @xmath228 is the supernova rate per volume as @xmath229 @xcite and @xmath230 represents the volume covered by a hot cavity .",
    "we assume all the snrs end their lives when the cavities contract and @xmath231 . after obtaining the porosity ,",
    "@xmath226 is estimated as @xmath232 . in figure",
    "[ fig:10 ] , we plot the porosity and the volume fraction of the hot gas against the magnetic field strength .",
    "this shows clearly that the porosity decreases with the magnetic field strength .",
    "comparing models a - d ( diamonds ) , @xmath233 for non - magnetic ism while @xmath234 for @xmath63 . here",
    "@xmath235 represents the sn rate per volume normalized by the standard value , @xmath236 .",
    "the anticipated volume filling factor of hot gas @xmath237 for non - magnetic ism ( model d ) is reduced to @xmath238 for @xmath63 ( model a ) . in models with ineffective heating rates ( models aw - dw ) ,",
    "the bubble is compressed more weakly by the thick shell than models a - d .",
    "the porosity of these models is greater than that of models a - d . in these models ,",
    "the effect of the magnetic field in reducing porosity is more remarkable , that is , @xmath239 for @xmath240 ( model dw ) while @xmath241 for @xmath63 ( model aw ) .",
    "this anticipates @xmath242 ( model dw ) and @xmath243 ( model aw ) .    even in models with",
    "ism density of @xmath174 , the effect of the magnetic field in reducing porosity is evident .",
    "increasing @xmath210 from @xmath244 to @xmath245 , porosity decreases by a factor of 1.7 from @xmath246 to @xmath247 . in the case where the average density of the ism is high ,",
    "the volume fraction of hot ism is restricted unless the supernova rate is much higher than that of our galaxy .",
    "consequently , it is shown that the volume fraction of the hot gas is restricted as @xmath248 by the effect of the magnetic field , even if the average ism density is as low as @xmath249 .",
    "observationally , in the solar neighborhood , the `` not strongly absorbing '' hi gas contains large holes , perhaps ranging up to 400 pc diameter , and the large holes occupy 10 - 20% of the volume , @xmath250 @xcite . for m31 , another sb galaxy ,",
    "the filling factor which is derived for the hi holes , which are found in the range from 7 to 16 kpc from the nucleus , is about 1% , @xmath251 @xcite . for m33 ,",
    "an sc galaxy , the filling factor for hi holes , allowing a scaling factor of 2 for non - detected holes , is less than 40% , @xmath252 @xcite .",
    "hi holes arise by ob associations with multiple supernova explosions that produce supercavities , and are also produced by the independent , random individual supernova explosions @xcite . in this section , we considered the latter case , and the porosity and the filling factor of models for @xmath63 presumably looks consistent with the observational data .      to understand how the shell width is determined , we consider the gas in thermal equilibrium .",
    "balance between the radiative cooling @xmath253 and heating @xmath254 leads @xmath255 where @xmath256 represents the boltzmann constant .",
    "the cooling function below @xmath257 is an increasing function of temperature and we assume @xmath258 , ignoring the dependence of the ionization fraction @xmath259 .",
    "equation ( [ eqn : equil ] ) gives the equilibrium pressure proportional to @xmath260 if we assume the post - shock gas is cooled and is in a thermal equilibrium [ eq.([eqn : equil ] ) ] under the post - shock pressure , it is shown that the density decreases with the deceleration of the shock velocity as @xmath261 where we used the relation between the shock velocity @xmath262 and the post - shock gas pressure @xmath31 .",
    "since the power @xmath263 , the shell density @xmath62 decreases as the shell expands with time , since the shock velocity @xmath262 decreases with time .    in this discussion",
    "we have ignored the magnetic field , which works to prevent compression . in the thick shell sweeping the magnetic field , dynamics is controlled by the magnetic field as shown in model a. in the extreme case , the change in density is controlled under the magnetic field .",
    "although equation ( [ eqn : equil ] ) does not hold near the shock front , the temperature and the thermal pressure reach the equilibrium values expected from equation ( [ eqn : equil ] ) near the shell - bubble boundary .",
    "we calculate the equilibrium density under the pressure @xmath31 in the shell , @xmath264 along the @xmath75-axis .",
    "the difference from this equilibrium density is given as @xmath265 .",
    "the volume average of @xmath266 decreases with time as 0.91,0.67,0.14 , and 0.07 at @xmath267 , and @xmath268 respectively in model a. this shows that , with time , the density of the shell approaches the state of equilibrium expected from equation ( [ eqn : equil ] ) .",
    "numerical calculations were carried out by vpp5000 in the astronomical data analysis center , national astronomical observatory of japan .",
    "this work was partially supported by grants - in - aid for scientific research from mext , japan ( 14540233,16036206 ) .",
    "the authors would like to thank the cans ( coordinated astronomical numerical software ) project who provided us with the mhd simulation code .",
    "in the case that the shock front is proceeding in the direction perpendicular to the magnetic field ( @xmath259-direction ) , the mass flux conservation advected with fluid motion is written as @xmath269 where subscripts @xmath270 and @xmath271 denote the quantities of pre - shock and post - shock , respectively , and velocities are measured from the shock front which is moving with @xmath262 . other momentum , energy , and magnetic flux conservations",
    "are written as @xmath272 @xmath273 @xmath274 using @xmath275 the above equations ( [ eqn : a1])-([eqn : a4 ] ) give following relations @xcite @xmath276x-\\gamma\\left(\\gamma+1\\right){{\\cal m}}^2=0,\\ ] ] @xmath277 where @xmath278 and @xmath279 represent the mach number of the shock speed against the pre - shock sound speed and the plasma beta for the pre - shock medium , respectively .",
    "we plot the ratio of the normalized post - shock pressure @xmath280 to that of non - magnetized shock @xmath281 as @xmath282 against the shock mach number @xmath93 in figure [ fig : a1 ] .",
    "even if @xmath93 is fixed at 10 , @xmath283 increases with @xmath284 as @xmath283= 0.35 , 0.67 , 0.88 , 0.96 , and 0.99 for @xmath284= 0.1 , 0.3 , 1.0 , 3.0 , and 10 , respectively .",
    "this indicates that small @xmath93 and @xmath284 ( slow shock speed and strong magnetic field ) induce the ratio @xmath283 to decrease , or in other words , the effect of the magnetic field becomes evident .    using the sedov solution ,",
