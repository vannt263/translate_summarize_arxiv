    "sio@xmath4-tio@xmath5 ( @xmath6 ) mixed materials are interesting for many technological areas ranging from heterogeneous catalysis to semiconductor industry .",
    "materials based on mixtures of titanium and silicon have been extensively studied due to their catalytic properties.@xcite these oxides are good model systems in catalysis providing also a convenient support for metal catalyst preparation and to study the strong metal - support interaction ( smsi).@xcite furthermore , the formation of ti - o - si cross - linking bonds strongly modifies the electronic structure of the interface , yielding unique catalytic properties.@xcite titanium - silica films have also received much attention in optical applications due to their high thermal and chemical stability and controlled refractive index.@xcite in the field of the renewable energy generation - thin films are used as working electrodes for dye - sensitized solar cells.@xcite furthermore , in micro - electronics new generations of metal - oxide - semiconductor ( mos ) devices demand a reduction of the thickness of the insulating layer . among the various possible insulators , tio@xmath5 has received an increasing amount of attention in recent years.@xcite    an important issue in the semiconductor or oxide - oxide systems is the sharpness of the interface and the presence of suboxides of well - defined stoichiometry .",
    "the growth of sio@xmath5 films on tio@xmath5 has been studied by barranco et al.@xcite , concluding that for low coverages ( @xmath0 ) grows in a layer by layer mode .",
    "finally , the inverse system , i.e. tio@xmath5 on sio@xmath5 substrates@xcite , as well as the oxidation of ti films deposited on mono and multilayer /mo(112 ) surfaces , are interesting in their own and have been reported in the literature too.@xcite the ( 110)-(1x1 ) is the most studied rutile surface owing to its stability , a well established experimental procedure to obtain it , and the accurate determination of its composition and geometry.@xcite it represents the bulk terminated stoichiometric surface , where two kind of ti atoms can be found ; along the [ 001 ] direction , rows of sixfold coordinated ti atoms ( ti-6f ) alternate with fivefold coordinated ti atoms ( ti-5f ) .",
    "similarly , two different classes of o atoms are created : in the main surface plane there are threefold coordinated in - plane o ( o-3f ) , and twofold coordinated ( o-2f ) protruding bridging o atoms ( see fig .",
    "[ fgr:1](a ) , left panel ) .",
    "a small density of disordered point defects characterizes this structure .",
    "these have been attributed to vacancies in the bridging o rows produced during the sample preparation , sputtering and annealing in ultra high vacuum ( uhv).@xcite    in this paper , we present experimental and theoretical work for si thin films at low ( 0.3 ml ) , and high coverage ( 3 ml ) , on the ( 110)-(1x1 ) stoichiometric surface .",
    "although experiments show some disorder in the interface , our calculations have been performed for a @xmath7 2d unit cell , and validated by comparing with similar results for a sparse @xmath8 , more appropriated to describe disorder .",
    "as long as the si coverage remains low ( early stages of growth , one si / unit cell ) our results indicate that interaction of si with o dominates , making the initial energy landscape rather insensitive to the use of a @xmath7 or a @xmath8 unit cell . for the initial stages of growth",
    "our theoretical calculations predict several adsorption sites within a narrow energy window , explaining the existence of disorder at room temperature by random population of these . once the available bonds to o have been saturated ( two si / unit cell ) , it is most logical for a feasible theoretical model to follow the @xmath3 periodicity imposed by the substrate .",
    "it is only when the film grows thicker ( more than three si / unit cell ) that diffusion of interstitials and epitaxial stresses become important , and a more complex model beyond our computational means should be consider to understand the amount of disorder at the interface with a thick siox film .",
    "this is beyond the scope of our theoretical approach .",
    "however , based in the available experimental and theoretical work for the regime of interest here , we can conclude that at the early stages of growth the si film is oxidized , whereas the ti cations are reduced , and ti - o - si cross - links bonds are formed at the interface . for coverages larger than 3 ml neutral si atoms are experimentally observed .",
    "we have also found that the stoichiometry is improved in the 3 ml thick film upon thermal annealing , although the surface order as monitored by the low - energy electron diffraction ( leed ) pattern is not improved by this heating treatment . according to our density functional theory ( dft ) calculations we propose models containing from one ( low coverage ) to three ( high coverage ) si atoms per tio@xmath5 ( 110)-(1x1 ) two - dimensional unit cell ( adsorption of three si atoms completes 1 ml , since a fourth si atom can not be directly bonded to the substrate ) .",
    "the theoretical results will be compared with the experimental data obtained for coverages under and above the monolayer .",
    "experiments were carried out in an uhv chamber , equipped with auger electron spectroscopy ( aes ) , x - ray photoelectron spectroscopy ( xps ) , ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy ( ups ) , leed , and argon ion sputtering ; details of the system have been published elsewhere.@xcite the ultimate pressure was @xmath9 mbar .",
    "the ( 110 ) rutile single crystals ( @xmath10 mm@xmath11 with both sides polished ) used in this study were provided by pi - kem ltd .",
    "the single crystal was bulk reduced and surface cleaned by repeated cycles of ar@xmath12 bombarding ( typically @xmath13 kev ) , followed by annealing ( @xmath14c , 60 min ) until no impurities were detected by aes and xps .",
    "after several of these cycles the colorless intrinsic turned to blue . as it has been documented on the literature a crystal of light blue color has enough bulk defects to avoid charging effects during the photoemission experiments and a deep blue color is related to @xmath15 oxygen vacancies per cm@xmath11.@xcite the ( 110)-(1x1 ) surface was prepared by annealing up to @xmath17c in atmosphere ( @xmath18 mbar ) during 90 minutes , and by subsequent cooling of the sample in atmosphere during 30 minutes.@xcite it has been reported in the literature how annealing at lower temperatures ( @xmath19- @xmath20 c ) could lead to rosette structures.@xcite with the techniques used in this manuscript we can not fully ascertain the absence of these structures even if after our annealing schedule we have observed a sharp @xmath1 leed pattern , corresponding to a well ordered surface .",
    "however , we notice that our annealing procedure goes to higher temperatures than the ones reported for the formation of rosettes , making more likely that the current surface would be free of these",
    ". we remark that techniques used in this work do not provide direct access to detailed information about the number or distribution of defects on the surface , as for example the presence of oxygen adatoms , but the annealing to higher temperatures usually work to improve matters , in particular it has been reported that annealing to higher temperatures than 330@xmath21 c helps to get rid of these defects.@xcite pure si was deposited on this ( 110)-(1x1 ) surface at room temperature ( rt ) using a home - made e - beam evaporator with a high purity si rod as evaporation source .",
    "the rate of deposition was determined by evaporating si on a polycrystalline au substrate and determining the coverage by aes.@xcite in this study only two cases have been considered : 0.3 ml and 3 ml .",
    "base pressure during the ulterior annealing of the si 3 ml thick film has been monitored to be always below @xmath22 mbar to avoid contamination by traces of or other residual gases ( the sample holder was thoroughly degassed by going to higher temperatures than the ones used for si deposition ) .",
    "the chamber is equipped with two non - monochromatic x - ray sources , al k@xmath23 ( 1486.6 ev ) and mg k@xmath23 ( 1253.6 ev ) , a he - discharge lamp ( 21.2 and 40.8 ev photon energy ) , and an electron gun of 3 kev energy .",
    "ups , aes and xps spectra were recorded using a hemispherical analyzer . the overall resolution ( source and analyzer )",
    "is 1.0 ev for aes , 0.8 ev for xps and 0.3 ev for ups measurements .",
    "the contribution of the mg k@xmath23 satellite lines and a shirley type background were subtracted from the experimental spectra before the xps data were analyzed.@xcite the ti 2p , si 2p and o 1s peaks were fitted using voigt curves .",
    "aes data were acquired in the integrate mode n(e ) .",
    "ab - initio density functional theory calculations have been performed using soft pseudopotentials@xcite and a plane - waves basis with a cutoff energy between 350 and 375 ev .",
    "the exchange and correlation functional has been computed in a generalized gradients approximation suggested by perdew , burke and ernzerhof,@xcite and the brillouin zone has been sampled on a @xmath24 monkhorst and pack mesh.@xcite actual calculations have been performed using the castep program.@xcite to characterize the electronic distribution in the near - surface region as accurately as possible we use a five layers slab to model the ( 110)-(1x1 ) surface , with one or two layers at the bottom of the slab kept frozen in bulk positions .",
    "all the calculations have been done at @xmath25 k , relaxing the system until the total energy changed less than @xmath26 ev , and the maximum force on any ion was less than 0.01 ev /  .",
    "the relaxed geometry has been passed to a different dft program working with a localized basis set ( fireball@xcite ) .",
    "wave - functions are now expanded into a basis of numerical atomic orbitals with a finite spatial range ( spatial cutoffs , see table  [ tbl:1 ] ) , yielding immediate access to the density of states ( dos ) projected on different atoms .",
    "this reduced basis represents a simpler approach with respect to the use of plane - waves , but it is known to produce good results at a moderated computing cost.@xcite",
    "so far , there is no direct information about the exact geometry of si on the ( 110)-(1x1 ) surface .",
    "since leed has not been helpful trying to solve this question , we have used ab - initio density functional theory to optimize the adsorption site of a single si adatom ( si-1 ) on the unit cell : seven different initial positions taking into account all the symmetry sites and spanning uniformly the 2d 1x1 unit cell have been investigated .",
    "the absolute minimum , corresponding to the lowest total energy , has been found for si interacting directly with a twofold coordinated bridging oxygen ( o-2f ) at a bonding distance of @xmath27  ( fig .  [ fgr:1](b ) , right panel ) .",
    "the closest titanium ( ti-6f ) is located at @xmath28  , far enough to preclude an important interaction , and the nearest next oxygen ( o-3f ) is at @xmath29  .",
    "this adsorption site is quasi - degenerated in energy ( @xmath30 ev ) with the second - best stable position where si sits nearly equidistant between one o-2f and one o-3f oxygen atoms ( @xmath31  ) and is located at @xmath32  from the nearest ti-6f .",
    "the existence of different adsorption sites inside a narrow window of energies explains the tendency of these layers to show disorder when grown at room temperature .",
    "similar calculations performed on a @xmath8 unit cell ( this slab has been made with three tri - layers ) support the same picture with minor changes : for the optimum adsorption position the si - o distance decreases to @xmath33  , and the energy difference with the second best near equivalent position is increased to @xmath34 ev .",
    "finally , the most disadvantageous _ meta - stable _ site we have found ( @xmath35 ev ) locates si as the vertex of a pyramid remaining at @xmath36  from two o-2f and one o-3f , and @xmath37  from the ti-6f located directly below .",
    "these configurations model the low - coverage scenario ( @xmath38 ml ) . to investigate the high coverage regime we add an extra si - atom to our previous optimum geometry ( si-2 ) .",
    "two different stable configurations have been found with an energy difference of @xmath39 ev .",
    "the most stable one ( fig .",
    "[ fgr:2 ] ) locates the second si - atom directly above the in - plane three - fold coordinated o atom , at @xmath40  from the first si atom ; this is larger than the typical si - si distance in its crystalline form ( @xmath41  ) , but quite comparable to the si - si distance in the presence of oxygen , e.g. @xmath42  in stishovite , a dense tetragonal form of with the rutile structure .",
    "therefore , the role of oxygen in the si - si interaction seems to be clearly established .",
    "we notice that in this configuration the second si atom is not accommodated in the second best position for the adsorption of a single si ( between two oxygens ) . the optimum structure forms a si zigzag pattern running along the ( 001 ) direction over the bridging o-2f ( fig .",
    "[ fgr:2 ] ) , while the second best candidate locates the adatoms in a linear disposition along the @xmath43 direction .",
    "finally , we saturate the si layer by locating a third si atom ( si-3 , @xmath44 ) in a symmetrical position between two zig - zag lines .",
    "relevant distances for the optimum configuration are given in table  [ tbl:2 ] , where we conclude that si-1 and si-2 remain bound to the surface through oxygen atoms while si-3 forms a bond to si-2 ( @xmath45  , comparable to the si - si distance in crystalline silicon ) .",
    "at the same time , si-1 to si-2 and si-1 to si-3 distances remain large , @xmath46  ( fig .",
    "[ fgr:3si ] ) , making difficult for the last silicon arrived at the surface ( si-3 ) to interact with the oxygen directly below ( @xmath47  ) .",
    "we find a metastable configuration ( @xmath48 ev ) with a si - o distance of @xmath49  and a si(3)-si(2 ) bond length of @xmath50  .",
    "the difference in the total energy is important enough to make us to conclude that the short si - si distance in the presence of oxygen is unfavorable and can not be compensated by the increased si - o interaction .",
    "these results are summarized in table  [ tbl:2 ] .      to characterize the nature of the - interface",
    ", we have studied the xps of si 2p , ti 2p and o 1s core level spectra .",
    "[ fgr:4 ] compares the xps si 2p spectra recorded at 0.3 ml and 3 ml of si coverage , and the 3 ml after annealing .",
    "the sub - monolayer deposits are characterized by a single si 2p line centred at 101.8 ev , while two peaks at 102 and 99.2 ev characterize the experimental spectra of the multilayer film .",
    "after annealing of the multilayer film , one peak centred at 102.5 ev has been again produced .",
    "the values of the si oxidised states reported in the literature are indicated with arrows on the figure ( @xmath51 = 103.2 ev , @xmath52= 102.0 ev , @xmath53= 101.0 ev , @xmath54=100.0 ev , and si@xmath55 = 98.9 ev).@xcite in general , it is assumed that the presence of si@xmath56 states ( n = 1 , 2 , 3 and 4 ) is due to silicon atoms bonded to nearest neighbour o atoms . in the case of the si - o bond a shift of the si 2p level of 1.05 ev is seen in agreement with previous reported results.@xcite therefore , at a coverage of 0.3 ml silicon is oxidized in an average oxidation state of si@xmath52 . on the other hand , at a coverage of 3 ml another state corresponding to si@xmath55 at the binding energy 99.2 ev appears , in agreement with our own aes spectra ( not shown ) , and the theoretical results discussed below .",
    "the analysis of the si 2p core level peaks show around a 20% of si - si bonds and 80% of si - o bonds on the surface .",
    "after annealing the 3 ml si - dosed surface to @xmath57 c for 30 min , the low binding energy components disappear completely and only one peak located at 102.5 ev is observed , revealing that annealing increases the oxidation state of si . the dotted line in fig .",
    "[ fgr:4 ] shows the shift to higher binding energies indicating an increase in the oxide stoichiometry , always below the value assigned for bulk , 103.2 ev .",
    "this result indicates a great concentration of si@xmath52 oxide , but we can not rule out the presence of sub - oxides sio@xmath4 species with @xmath58 , and .@xcite we have used aes to gather further information on the interface , a technique that has been frequently used in the past to study the si - o bonding at different si interfaces .",
    "we have studied the si lvv aes transition to measure data for three different cases : ( a ) the clean ( 1x1 ) surface covered with 0.3 ml of si , ( b ) the same surface with 3 ml of si , and ( c ) the 3 ml si covered surface after 30 minutes annealing at @xmath59c .",
    "the si lvv shows chemical shifts that may be used to distinguish silicon oxides and silicon , but for low si coverage the aes intensities are too similar to the clean surface to allow a reliable analysis of these spectra .",
    "when 3 ml of si are deposited , the si lvv transition exhibits a peak near 64 ev , and a broad feature between 77 ev and 90 ev .",
    "therefore , even if a quantitative analysis is not possible , aes qualitatively agrees with xps for si coverages between 0.3 and 3 ml .",
    "after annealing the 3 ml film at @xmath59c during 30 min",
    ". a broad peak at the kinetic energy is found , which we take as an indication of the progressive build - up of stoichiometric .",
    "the si oxidation might be produced by either diffusion of o from bulk to the surface , or by diffusion of surface ti into the bulk during annealing .",
    "[ fgr:5 ] shows the xps spectra of the o 1s ( left part ) and ti 2p ( right part ) core levels .",
    "the spectra have been fitted using voigt functions .",
    "the o 1s core level spectrum for the clean ( 1x1 ) surface can be fitted to a single peak at 529.8 ev ( fig .",
    "[ fgr:5](a ) ) , corresponding to o - ti bonds.@xcite we notice that for 0.3 ml there is a small increase in the high binding energy region at 531.2 ev ( fig .",
    "[ fgr:5](c ) ) .",
    "it is questionable to assign this feature to si - o - ti cross - linking bonds between the sio@xmath4 overlayer and the substrate , since fitting this feature we obtain a value of about 3% of the total o 1s area , which is within the experimental error bars in the fitting procedure .",
    "however , at a si coverage of 3 ml ( fig .",
    "[ fgr:5](d ) ) a tail in the high binding energy is better defined and a best fit for the o 1s spectrum is obtained with three components at binding energies of 529.9 ev ( o - ti ) , 531.3 ev ( si - o - ti ) , and 532.2 ev ( o - si ) .",
    "these new components indicate the coexistence of different o chemical bonds , because si and ti cations compete strongly for lattice o ions , resulting in the formation of mixed - oxide states at the interface . the ( si - o - ti ) component is assigned to si - o - ti cross - link bonds between the sio@xmath4 overlayer and the substrate , as occurs in the case of si on the ( 1x2 ) reconstructed surface.@xcite the growth of the tail towards a higher binding energy",
    "can be explained if two ti - o - ti bonds are replaced by a single ti - o - si bond , namely because the number of ti - o bonds decrease due to the formation of si - o bonds .",
    "as si is more electronegative than ti , this difference should be responsible for the binding energy shift observed in fig .",
    "[ fgr:5 ] ( left panel ) .",
    "this ti - o - si bond is supported by results already reported for the - oxide systems , @xcite as well as for films deposited on .@xcite the ti 2p core level spectrum of the clean ( 1x1 ) surface ( fig .",
    "[ fgr:5 ] ( e ) ) is characterized by the splitting of 2p@xmath60 and 2p@xmath61 .",
    "the 2p@xmath60 is fitted by two components : the most intense one is located at 458.5 ev binding energy corresponding to ti@xmath51 cations.@xcite the second one is centred at a binding energy of 456.8 ev ( @xmath62 ev ) , which reveals the presence of ti@xmath52 cations,@xcite and is related with o vacancies present on the ( 1x1 ) stoichiometric surface.@xcite in accordance with earlier work,@xcite we have introduced a satellite component ( be 460 ev ) to get a good fit of the ti 2p peak .",
    "from the area of the ti-2p@xmath60 components ( given in percent ) the reduction of the surface , @xmath63 , is determined to be @xmath64 + 0.02 \\times [ ti^{2+}]$ ] .",
    "this parameter characterizes the average oxidation or reduction of the surface substrate.@xcite    for the stoichiometric @xmath3 surface , the values of the surface reduction , @xmath63 , and the o / ti ratio obtained from @xmath65 ,",
    "are found to be @xmath66 and @xmath67 , respectively . at a si coverage of 0.3 ml , ( fig .",
    "[ fgr:5 ] ( f ) ) these parameters become @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which are not significantly different from those of the stoichiometric @xmath70 surface . at a coverage of 3 ml the results of the ti-2p@xmath60 core level ( fig .  [",
    "fgr:5](g ) ) are fitted by three components at binding energies of 458.5 ev ( ti@xmath51 ) , 456.8 ev ( ti@xmath52 ) , and 455.4 ev ( ti@xmath53).@xcite the surface reduction , @xmath63 , and the o / ti ratio are 0.40 and 1.80 , respectively .",
    "these values agree well with related results reported earlier for the @xmath71 reconstructed surface of @xmath72 and @xmath73 at 2 ml and @xmath74 and @xmath75 at 4 ml.@xcite notice that these parameters show a clear dependency with the si coverage , regardless of the reconstructed surface .",
    "the presence of ti@xmath52 and ti@xmath53 states indicates that si induces a strong reduction of the substrate atoms .",
    "there is also a strong increase of the @xmath63 parameter with the si coverage , about one order of magnitude larger at 3 ml than the values corresponding to the clean surface .",
    "the reaction taking place at rt on the interface is given by : @xmath76 with @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "after annealing at @xmath57 c during 30 minutes the o 1s spectrum ( fig .  [ fgr:5 ] ( d ) ) shows a slight intensity decrease in the ti - o - si component located at 531.2 ev .",
    "this implies that annealing breaks ti - o - si bonds and o forms new bonds to ti or si atoms .",
    "ingo et al.@xcite have reported a decrease of this component after heating a mixture of - oxides at @xmath14 c in air , proving the creation of new ti - o and si - o bonds . at the same time , the analysis of ti 2p core level ( fig .",
    "[ fgr:5 ] ( h ) ) shows that after annealing the component associated with the ti@xmath53 state disappears completely .",
    "the surface reduction @xmath63 and the o / ti ratio change from @xmath79 , and @xmath80 , to @xmath81 , and @xmath69 before and after the annealing respectively .",
    "this is a clear indication that ti cations are oxidized by the annealing .",
    "it is noteworthy to notice that the density of defects present in the annealed surface is similar to the one found on the surface reconstruction ( 1x2 ) .",
    "however , as discussed below , after annealing the surface does not show a clear leed pattern .      in this section , we shall analyze the experimental ups spectra by comparing with the dos calculated theoretically for the structures described above ( figs .",

    "[ fgr:6 ] shows the valence - band spectra obtained by ups ( he i left panel , he ii right panel ) for the ( 1x1 ) clean surface , and for surface coverages of 0.3 ml and 3.0 ml , respectively .",
    "our theoretical calculations show that the ( 110)-(1x1 ) valence - band structure is mainly due to o 2p orbitals , with a slight hybridization between the o 2p and ti 3d orbitals . at si 0.3 ml coverage",
    "the line shape of the ups spectrum does not change with respect to the pristine surface , although a valence band shift of @xmath82 ev towards higher binding energies is observed .",
    "this displacement is better seen in the he ii spectrum ( right panel ) and it could be explained by the bonding of oxygen with silicon , leaving some charge available to be transferred to the titanium substrate .",
    "this charge is partially connected to the occupation of the empty 3d levels of the ti@xmath51 to give ti@xmath52 , as reflected in ti 2p xps and ups spectra , and the remaining charge is distributed in the available conduction band ( e.g. , as seen in our calculated dos , where empty states mainly associated to ti-5f are filled ) , inducing a shift in the valence band seen in our experiments . at 3 ml of si coverage ,",
    "a broad non - structured feature dominates the spectra between 4 and 9 ev below the fermi level , and it is assigned to the non - bonding o 2p orbital of the valence band.@xcite the line shape of the spectrum resembles the ones reported in the literature for thin films of amorphous silicon oxide.@xcite this suggests a disordered layer , similar to the case of si on the @xmath71 reconstructed surface.@xcite notice that there is a slight emission increase in the band gap region between 0 and 3 ev below de fermi energy ( inset in fig .  [ fgr:6 ] ) .",
    "this increase is not only due to ti 3d states being populated , as it is shown by xps in fig .",
    "[ fgr:5 ] .",
    "these states are located approximately at 0.7 ev binding energy and they do not spread beyond 1.0 ev from the fermi level .",
    "we should mention that the presence of a siox layer might induce a shift in these states .",
    "however , we do not observe peaks in the band gap , only a constant increase in emission from the fermi level to the minimum of the valence band at 3 ev ( see inset in fig .",
    "[ fgr:6 ] ) .",
    "therefore , we favor the interpretation that this is due to the contribution of si states appearing in the gap , an option supported by the theoretical dos calculations ( see below ) . also , a shift of the valence band is observed , which moves away from the fermi level between 0.30.4 ev .",
    "this effect is better appreciated in the he ii spectrum .",
    "in addition , a new electronic state appears in the region of 10 ev , which is attributed to o 2p ",
    "si 3s , 3p bonds.@xcite both for low and high coverages a decrease of the work function of @xmath83 ev is seen .",
    "for the low coverage of 0.3 ml on the ( 1x2 ) reconstructed surface an identical variation of the work function has been measured.@xcite nevertheless , at higher coverage the decrease of the work function is larger on the ( 1x2 ) reconstructed surface .",
    "this difference might be related to the ordered surface defects found in the ( 1x2 ) reconstruction , but not in the stoichiometric ( 1x1 ) surface.@xcite these observations are confirmed by our dft calculations . in fig .",
    "[ fgr:7 ] we show the calculated total dos of the clean ( 110)-(1x1 ) surface compared with the corresponding 1 and 3 si - atoms reconstructions ( ( a ) and ( b ) respectively ) .",
    "while in the clean surface there is a clear gap of around 2.5 ev , new peaks appear in the band gap when si adatoms are included in the calculations turning the original insulator system into a metallic one ( the number of peaks increasing with the number of si - atoms adsorbed ) .",
    "this is in good agreement with the experimental result we show in the inset of fig .",

    "we have linear - subtracted the experimental background , aligned theory and experiment to a common fermi level , and normalized the experimental and theoretical valence band maxima to the same value ( arbitrary units ) .",
    "the agreement is good , in particular the valence band width is very similar .",
    "the experimental result , however , shows less structure than the theoretical one ; this could be associated with the finite temperature smearing out theoretical peaks computed for t=0 k and the existence of disorder . in this figure",
    "we also show the atomic contribution to the dos of the most important atoms in the surface in the three si - atoms optimum configuration : the si - atom , the o-2f atom and both ti - atoms . due to the charge redistribution on the surface ,",
    "originally empty ti - states are partially filled , as it is found experimentally in xps ti 2p ( see fig .",
    "[ fgr:5 ] ) .",

    "some additional peaks appear in the si/-dos .",

    "the spectrum shows essentially only one significant change : the appearance of a new structure in the 10 - 12 ev region .",
    "this feature also appears in si films of 1 and 4 ml on the @xmath71 surface reconstruction after a heat treatment.@xcite we assign it to a strong si - o bond between o 2p and si 3s , 3p.@xcite this is a clear indication of the presence of sio@xmath4 on the surface as shown by aes and xps .",
    "the absence of structure in the o 2p orbital ( 4 - 8 ev region ) clearly confirms the relation between the shape of o 2p valence band orbitals and the surface order,@xcite since after annealing the ( 1x1 ) leed pattern is not recovered ( not shown ) .",
    "experiments have been performed at room temperature , while all the calculations are at @xmath25 k , explaining why the experimental peaks show larger widths .",
    "defects and disorder in the experimental system should further contribute to wash out peaks .",

    "this agreement is based in : ( i ) the similar width and shapes of the valence band shape and width in experiment and theory ( fig .",
    "[ fgr:8 ] ) , ( ii ) the nice correlation between the predicted theoretical contribution from si around 10 - 11 ev below the fermi level ( fig .",
    "[ fgr:8 ] ) and the corresponding experimental features ( marked with an arrow in fig .  [ fgr:9 ] ) , and ( iii ) the presence of si states in the band gap ( fig .",
    "[ fgr:8 ] ) , agreeing with the increased emission observed in the ups experiment for the si - covered surface ( inset of fig .  [ fgr:6](a ) ) .",
    "thin si films have been prepared on ( 110)-(1x1 ) surface at room temperature in order to study the initial growth of si overlayers on this surface .",
    "we conclude that for very low coverages ( 0.3 ml ) the silicon grows as and suboxides sio@xmath4 with @xmath58 .",
    "furthermore , the substrate is reduced and the surface order begins to disappear .    at higher si coverages ( 3 ml )",
    "a film is formed by , a mixture of suboxides sio@xmath4 with @xmath6 , pure si , and cross - linking ti - o - si bonds found at the interface region . for this coverage",
    "the surface order already has disappeared completely . in addition , si/ ( 110 ) interaction is strong and the interface is not atomically sharp . while the reaction is stronger for the ( 1x2 ) as compared to the ( 1x1 ) surface , the chemistry is similar in both cases : si wets completely the surface.@xcite after thermal annealing at @xmath57 c during 30 minutes , the stoichiometry is improved , but the surface order is not recovered .",
    "our interpretation of the experimental data is further supported by ab - initio dft calculations where optimum configurations and corresponding electronic structure have been obtained .",
    "comparison between theory and experimental data allows us to confirm that the new states appearing in the gap are mostly due to the adsorbed si - atoms ( with some contribution from the ti - atoms ) .",
    "new states located in the bottom of the valence band are related to the si - o bonds formed in the system .",
