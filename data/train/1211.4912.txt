    "many examples of space - like maximal surfaces containing singular curves in the lorentz - minkowski @xmath0-space @xmath4 of signature @xmath5 have been constructed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .    in this paper , we are interested in the zero mean curvature surfaces in @xmath1 changing their causal type : klyachin @xcite showed under a sufficiently weak regularity assumption that a zero mean curvature surface in @xmath1 changes its causal type only on the following two subsets :    * null curves ( i.e. , regular curves whose velocity vector fields are light - like ) which are non - degenerate ( i.e. , their projections into the @xmath6-plane are locally convex plane curves ) , or * light - like lines , which are degenerate everywhere .    given a non - degenerate null curve @xmath7 in @xmath1 ,",
    "there exists a zero mean curvature surface which changes its causal type across this curve from a space - like maximal surface to a time - like minimal surface ( cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "this construction can be accomplished using the bjrling formula for the weierstrass - type representation formula of maximal surfaces .",
    "however , if @xmath7 is a light - like line , the aforementioned construction fails , since the isothermal coordinates break down at the light - like singular points .",
    "locally , such a surface is the graph of a function @xmath8 satisfying @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , etc .",
    "we call this and its graph the _ zero mean curvature equation _ and a _ zero mean curvature surface _ , respectively . until now , zero mean curvature surfaces which actually change type across a light - like line were unknown .",
    "as announced in @xcite , the main purpose of this paper is to construct such an example . in section  [ sec :",
    "existence ] , we give a formal power series solution of the zero mean curvature equation describing all zero mean curvature surfaces which contain a light - like line . using this , we give the precise statement of our main result and show how the statement can be reduced to a proposition ( cf .",
    "proposition  [ prop : goal ] ) . in section  [ sec :",
    "proof ] , we then prove it . as a consequence ,",
    "we obtain the first example of ( a family of ) zero mean curvature surfaces which change type across a light - like line .",
    "we discuss solutions of the zero mean curvature equation which have the following form @xmath12 where @xmath13 ( @xmath14 ) are @xmath15-functions .",
    "when @xmath16 contains a singular light - like line , we may assume without loss of generality that ( cf .",
    "@xcite ) @xmath17 as was pointed out in @xcite , there exists a real constant @xmath18 called the _",
    "characteristic _ of @xmath16 such that @xmath19 satisfies the following equation @xmath20    now we derive the differential equations satisfied by @xmath13 for @xmath21 assuming .",
    "if we set @xmath22 and @xmath23 then , by straightforward calculations , we see that @xmath24 where @xmath25 for @xmath26 , and that the zero mean curvature equation reduces to @xmath27 it is now immediate , by comparing the coefficients of @xmath28 from both sides , to see that each @xmath29 ( @xmath30 ) satisfies the following ordinary differential equation @xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are as in for @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 are written in terms of @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) and their derivatives .",
    "now , we consider the case that @xmath39 changes sign across the light - like line @xmath40 .",
    "this case occurs only when the characteristic @xmath18 as in of @xmath16 vanishes @xcite .",
    "if we set @xmath41 then holds for @xmath42 .",
    "so we assume @xmath43 where @xmath44 is a non - zero constant .",
    "then @xmath45 in can be rewritten as @xmath46 in this situation , we will find a solution satisfying @xmath47 then reduces to @xmath48 and @xmath49 for @xmath50 , where the fact that @xmath51 has been extensively used .",
    "for example , @xmath52     for @xmath53 and @xmath54 ( the range of the graph is wider than the range used in our mathematical estimation .",
    "however , this figure still has a sufficiently small numerical error term in the taylor expansion . ) , width=294 ]    in this article , we show the following assertion :    [ thm : main ] for each positive number @xmath44 , the formal power series solution @xmath45 uniquely determined by , , and gives a real analytic zero mean curvature surface on a neighborhood of @xmath55 . in particular , there exists a non - trivial @xmath56-parameter family of real analytic zero mean curvature surfaces each of which changes type across a light - like line ( see figure  [ fig2 ] ) .    as a consequence , we get the following :    there exists a family of zero - mean curvature hypersurfaces in lorentz - minkowski space @xmath2 which change type across an @xmath3-dimensional light - like plane .",
    "let @xmath16 be as in the theorem .",
    "the graph of the function defined by @xmath57 gives the desired hypersurface . in this case",
    ", the zero mean curvature equation @xmath58 reduces to in the introduction .    to prove theorem  [ thm : main ] , it is sufficient to show that for arbitrary positive constants @xmath59 and @xmath60 there exist positive constants @xmath61 , @xmath62 , and @xmath63 such that @xmath64 holds for @xmath65 .",
    "in fact , if holds , then the series converges uniformly over the rectangle @xmath66\\times [ -\\delta,\\delta]$ ] .",
    "the key assertion to prove is the following    [ prop : goal ] for each @xmath59 and @xmath67 , we set @xmath68{192 c^2 \\tau }         \\right\\},\\ ] ] where @xmath69 is the positive constant given by in the appendix , such that @xmath70    then the function @xmath71 formally determined by the recursive formulas  satisfies the inequalities @xmath72 for any @xmath73,\\ ] ] where @xmath74    once this proposition is proven , follows immediately .",
    "in fact , if we set @xmath75 and @xmath76 , then @xmath77 and follows from @xmath78",
    "we prove the proposition using induction on the number @xmath79 . if @xmath80 , then @xmath81 hold , using that @xmath82 , @xmath83 and @xmath84 .",
    "so we prove the assertion for @xmath85 .",
    "since , follow from by integration , it is sufficient to show that holds for each @xmath85 .",
    "( in fact , the most delicate case is @xmath86 . in this case",
    "@xmath87 and we can use the fact that @xmath88 for @xmath89 converges . )    the inequality follows if one shows that , for each @xmath90 @xmath91 under the assumption that , and hold for all @xmath92 .",
    "in fact , if holds , for @xmath93 follows immediately . then by the initial condition ( cf .  ) , we have and for @xmath93 by integration .      by and using the fact that , hold for @xmath95 , we have for each @xmath96 that where we applied lemma [ lem : sum - int ] and at the last step of the estimations .",
    "hence , we get for @xmath97 .      by and the induction assumption , we have that @xmath100 now we apply the inequality @xmath101 and also @xmath102 which follows from . setting @xmath103 , @xmath104",
    ", we have that @xmath105 now applying lemma [ lem : sum-2 ] , we have that @xmath106 which proves for @xmath107 .      like as in the case of @xmath98 , we have that @xmath109 now we set @xmath110 , @xmath104 , and using the inequality @xmath111 we have that @xmath112 by applying lemma [ lem : sum-2 ] , we have that @xmath113 which proves for @xmath114 .",
    "this completes the proof of proposition [ prop : goal ] .",
    "for @xmath115 , it holds that @xmath116 therefore , @xmath117 in particular , one can show that there exists a positive constant @xmath69 such that @xmath118 the following assertion is needed to prove for @xmath119 :            we set @xmath128 . applying lemma [ lem : sum - int ] and the identity , we have that where we used the fact that @xmath129 . by applying lemma [ lem : sum - int ] and by using the property of the constant @xmath69 , it holds that      s. fujimori , y.w .",
