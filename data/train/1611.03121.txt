    "gan - based semiconductors are widely used for optoelectronic devices@xcite and are being developed for high power applications.@xcite typically wurtzite gan films for these applications are grown in the @xmath0 c - plane orientation . while it was discovered early how to grow high quality films in the c - plane orientation , there has been much progress recently in growth on other surface orientations that offer potential advantages . for light",
    "emitting devices , the intrinsic electric field associated with polar c - plane orientations can limit performance,@xcite and use of non - polar orientations such as @xmath1 m - plane can alleviate this problem.@xcite for high power devices , use of a vertical device geometry involving growth on various surface planes can improve performance.@xcite this motivates our effort to model gan growth on different crystal surface orientations such as c- and m - plane to elucidate the influence of orientation on growth modes and kinetics .    in this study",
    ", we use kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulations to observe the effects of surface orientation on atomic - scale mechanisms occurring during homoepitaxy of gan films by typical methods , such as metal - organic vapor phase epitaxy ( movpe ) .",
    "several previous kmc studies of gan growth have been carried out for the @xmath0 c - plane surface .",
    "studies modeling gan growth by molecular beam epitaxy @xcite proposed mechanisms by which ga and n diffusion rates and the ga / n supply ratio influence surface morphology . a previous kmc simulation describing movpe @xcite focused on the chemical reaction , adsorption , and desorption processes without considering surface kinetics such as diffusion of atoms , attachment at step edges , etc . a sequence of studies that focus on surface kinetics @xcite have modeled step morphologies and instabilities as a function of growth conditions . the effect of the ehrlich - schwoebel step - edge barrier @xcite on step instabilities @xcite and growth mode transitions @xcite has been studied .",
    "recent kmc studies @xcite have investigated step instabilities on the @xmath2 surface . here",
    "we develop a model to compare the growth of gan on two different surface orientations , @xmath0 c - plane and @xmath1 m - plane , to observe effects of the crystal lattice structure on atomic - scale mechanisms determining homoepitaxial growth mode boundaries as a function of temperature and growth rate .",
    "we analyze the surface structures observed in reciprocal space , to determine growth mode boundaries and mean island spacings , and to make contact with _ in situ _ surface x - ray and electron scattering studies .",
    "such experiments provide quantitative characterization of atomic - scale surface morphology during growth .",
    "in particular , x - ray methods can penetrate the movpe environment to reveal growth behavior as a function of conditions .",
    "we compare our kmc simulation results with x - ray studies of gan movpe @xcite to fix the relationship between simulation and experimental timescales and provide physical insight into observed behavior .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii , we describe the features of our kmc model , and their direct implications for step edge energies and diffusion barriers on gan c- and m - plane surfaces . in section iii",
    ", we present growth simulations as a function of temperature and growth rate , and analyze the structures in reciprocal space to obtain island spacings and growth mode boundaries . in section iv",
    ", we compare the results with experiments on gan movpe , and in section v discuss results and conclusions . note that the results of the simulations can also be applied to other hexagonal materials by alternative choices of scaling parameters .",
    "diffusion and chemical reactions of precursor species on the gan surface under movpe conditions are not well understood .",
    "indirect estimates of surface transport rates and mechanisms have been made , e.g. based on the observed temperature and length scale dependence of surface smoothing .",
    "@xcite a number of density functional theory calculations for diffusion and reaction energies and barriers of ga and n species including ammonia have been reported , providing insights into molecular mechanisms of the growth processes.@xcite in general , kmc calculations can take advantage of parameter values based on such dft results",
    ". however , in the absence of a complete set of reliable parameters for different gan orientations , we have been using a more generic energy model that we relate to experimental studies .",
    "while a full atomic - scale description of all processes occuring during movpe is challenging , one aspect of gan growth provides a simplification .",
    "because of the very high equilibrium vapor pressure of n@xmath3 at the ga",
    "/ gan phase boundary at typical growth temperatures,@xcite the nitrogen precursor ( e.g. nh@xmath4 ) is typically provided in large excess .",
    "thus the surface is saturated with respect to nitrogen species ( e.g. nh@xmath5 ) in a dynamic steady state environment , @xcite and the rate - limiting steps for growth involve the deposition and incorporation of ga.@xcite in our model we can thus focus on the behavior of ga atoms , and assume the n structure remains in local equilibrium with the environment .",
    "a version of this assumption has been used in previous simulations . @xcite",
    "while considering only the ga sites involves an approximation , it allows us to investigate the anisotropies on various crystal faces due to the primary underlying crystal symmetry .      to simulate movpe of gan",
    ", we use a kmc model based on a crystal lattice of ga atomic sites , where each site is either occupied by an atom or not . the ga sites in the wurtzite gan structure form a hexagonal closed - packed ( hcp ) arrangement , with almost the ideal ratio of the @xmath6 and @xmath7 lattice parameters.@xcite",
    "thus we use an ideal hcp lattice of ga sites in the kmc model .",
    "the use of the hcp lattice ( p6@xmath4/mmc symmetry ) instead of the full wurtzite structure ( p6@xmath4mc symmetry ) does not capture some features of the gan structure , e.g. the asymmetry between @xmath8}$ ] and @xmath9}$ ] due to polarity .    an hcp lattice with lattice parameter @xmath7",
    "can be described as an orthorhombic lattice using `` orthohexagonal '' coordinates,@xcite with four sites per unit cell and lattice parameters @xmath7 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 .",
    "[ fig : planes ] shows the geometry of the ga sites on the c - plane and m - plane gan surfaces .",
    "the three faces of the orthohexagonal unit cell correspond to the @xmath12 a - plane , @xmath13 m - plane , and @xmath14 c - plane surfaces , which are normal to @xmath7 , @xmath15 , and @xmath6 in the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 directions , respectively .    as shown in cross section in fig .",
    "[ fig : planes](b ) , for the c - plane surface , sites 1 and 3 form a layer at fractional coordinate @xmath19 in each unit cell , while sites 2 and 4 form a layer at @xmath20 .",
    "we thus consider each of these layers to comprise a single monolayer ( ml ) , and define the thickness of 1 ml to be @xmath21 for the c - plane .",
    "note that in some of the literature , @xcite this definition of monolayer is denoted as `` bilayer '' , because of the nitrogen site associated with each ga site . for the m - plane surface , with cross section shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : planes](a ) , sites 1 and 2 have similar heights @xmath22 and 1/6 , while sites 3 and 4 have similar heights @xmath23 and 2/3 .",
    "we likewise consider each of these layers to comprise a single ml for the m - plane , with a thickness of @xmath24 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm ] , the simulations predict a much larger region of lbl growth for m - plane than c - plane surfaces .",
    "this result is consistent with experiments,@xcite in which a direct transition between sf and 3d growth modes is typically observed on c - plane , while a large intervening region of lbl growth is observed on m - plane .",
    "the observed growth rate at the sf - lbl boundary on m - plane gan@xcite can be described by an arrhenius expression @xmath25 with parameters @xmath26  ev and @xmath27  ( ml / s)@xmath28 = 13.1 \\pm 1.4 $ ] . by equating @xmath29 in ml / s with @xmath30 from eqs .",
    "[ eq : sf ] and [ eq : t0 ] , we can obtain expressions for the parameters that give the time scale for gan movpe , @xmath31 @xmath32 using the terrace width @xmath33  nm corresponding to the experiments@xcite and the simulation value of @xmath34 , this gives @xmath35 ev and @xmath36  ( s@xmath37 = 18.5 \\pm 1.8 $ ] .",
    "values of @xmath38 estimated using these parameters are given in table  [ tab : scales ] . also shown are the calculated surface diffusion coefficients.@xcite    using the correspondence between experimental and simulation temperature and time scales given in table  [ tab : scales ] , the regions of temperature and growth rate investigated in recent experiments@xcite are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : gm ] .",
    "the boundaries at fixed experimental growth rates of 0.001 and 2 ml / s appear as diagonal lines when plotted in simulation units of ml / ut , because of the temperature dependence of @xmath38 .",
    "except at low temperature , the region investigated directly in the current simulations corresponds to much higher growth rates than studied in experiments .",
    "the three experimental values of @xmath29 used to obtain the correspondence are likewise plotted in simulation units ( blue dots ) on fig .",
    "[ fig : gm](a ) .",
    "the experimentally observed value of @xmath39 at the lbl-3d transition for m - plane@xcite is plotted ( red dot ) in simulation units on fig .",
    "[ fig : gm](a ) .",
    "it lies very close to the boundary obtained from the simulation results ( red line ) .",
    "this represents a quantitative agreement of the relative positions of the sf - lbl and lbl-3d boundaries between the experiments and the simulations using the nnn model for the m - plane surface .",
    "experiments on c - plane surfaces@xcite show a direct transition between sf and 3d growth modes , with no intervening lbl mode .",
    "this qualitatively agrees with the prediction in fig .  [",
    "fig : gm](b ) for the region of experimental conditions .",
    "however , the experimentally observed value for @xmath39 ( red dot ) is significantly higher than the boundary predicted by simulations using the nn model for the c - plane surface ( red line ) .",
    "this quantitative difference may indicate that the effective es barriers produced by the nn model are too large to accurately represent the c - plane , and that behavior intermediate between those of the nn and nnn simulations would agree better with experiment .",
    "however , because we have used results from m - plane to determine the correspondence between experimental and simulation time scales , other effects may also contribute to the difference observed for c - plane .",
    "the simulations presented here of growth on the c- and m - plane surfaces of a hexagonal crystal provide both agreement with , and insight into , experimental results for movpe growth of gan .",
    "we see different behavior on the two surfaces because of the different bonding configurations .",
    "the simulations employ two different models for diffusion kinetics : nn , which allows diffusion jumps only between nearest - neighbor sites ; and nnn , which also allows some next - nearest - neighbor jumps .",
    "these produce higher and lower effective ehrlich - schwoebel step - edge barriers , respectively , and have a significant impact on the crystal growth modes .",
    "we have mapped the transitions as a function of temperature @xmath40 and growth rate @xmath41 among the three homoepitaxial growth modes : three - dimensional ( 3d ) ; layer - by - layer ( lbl ) ; and step - flow ( sf ) .",
    "we have also determined the dependence on @xmath40 and @xmath41 of the island spacing @xmath42 that develops during lbl and 3d growth .",
    "quantitative comparison of these results to experiment allows us to estimate underlying fundamental quantities , such as the surface diffusion coefficients given in table  [ tab : scales ] .    on both the c- and m - plane surfaces , the island heights found in the simulations during lbl growth are one half of the orthohexagonal unit cell dimension ( @xmath21 and @xmath24 , respectively )",
    "this is in agreement with experimental studies of layer - by - layer growth in gan movpe,@xcite indicating that the basic nearest - neighbor bond counting energetics of the kmc model is generally applicable to this system .",
    "the simulations show that both the typical island shapes at lower temperatures and the growth mode transitions differ between c- and m - plane , and between nn and nnn kinetics .",
    "overall , the nn model with high es barrier provides better agreement with experiment for the c - plane , while the nnn model with low es barrier provides better agreement for m - plane .",
    "in particular , the very narrow region of lbl growth found for c - plane with nn kinetics , and the typical shape of islands on m - plane formed under nnn kinetics ( elongated perpendicular to @xmath43 $ ] and highly correlated parallel to @xmath43 $ ] ) , are both in agreement with x - ray@xcite and afm measurements .",
    "this indicates that the elongated islands observed on m - plane have their origin primarily in anisotropic equilibrium step - edge energies rather than in adatom diffusion kinetics , since the latter is almost isotropic in the nnn model .",
    "similar conclusions were reached in studies of islands on dimerized si ( 001 ) @xcite and ag ( 110 ) @xcite .",
    "our study indicates that the direct transition from sf to 3d growth observed for growth on gan c - plane surfaces can be attributed to a high es barrier due to the bonding arrangement at steps on a close - packed surface .",
    "previous kmc studies on c - plane growth also emphasized the effect of the es barrier on island nucleation , finding that smoother films are obtained when the es barrier is screened.@xcite this agrees with our finding that the lbl range is wider on c - plane when using the nnn model .",
    "our simulations found that the island spacing @xmath42 under lbl growth conditions obeys a negative power - law dependence on growth rate , eq .",
    "[ eq : s ] , with exponent @xmath44 for m - plane and @xmath45 for c - plane .",
    "recent experimental results @xcite for movpe on m - plane gan are in agreement with this value .",
    "growth of anisotropic islands in submonolayer epitaxy has been previously considered in kmc modeling .",
    "@xcite the power law for island density as a function of growth rate shows an exponent smaller than that for the isotropic case , with @xmath46 for a critical nucleus size equal to one .",
    "however , we observe a similar low exponent in our simulations on c - plane surfaces , where the island shapes are isotropic .    several topics for future work can be identified .",
    "there is considerable interest in gan growth on surface orientations in addition to c- and m - plane,@xcite and it is straightforward to extend the kmc model and methods developed here to other orientations . while we have estimated the boundary between lbl and sf growth based on island spacing , it will be of interest to explicitly consider growth on vicinal surfaces with steps , which can be done by using helical boundary conditions.@xcite for simplicity we have neglected evaporation from the surface in this work .",
    "inclusion of evaporation will provide a second surface transport mechanism qualitatively different from surface diffusion , that undoubtedly becomes important at higher temperatures.@xcite since the kmc model gives an exact arrangement as a function of time for the atomic positions , it will be very valuable in predicting the results of coherent x - ray experiments ( such as x - ray photon correlation spectroscopy @xcite or coherent diffraction imaging @xcite ) that are becoming feasible .",
    "the model also can be extended to account for full the wurtzite structure of gan , with two atom types and additional parameters derived from experiment or ab initio theory .",
    "this will allow study of the effects of polarity .",
    "finally , the nn and nnn models employed here give fairly extreme values for high and low effective es barriers . the best agreement with experiments",
    "may be obtained from a model between these two extremes .",
