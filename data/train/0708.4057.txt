    "results from the cleo - c experiment at the cornell electron positron storage ring based on 281 pb@xmath4 recorded at the @xmath5 are presented here for studies of @xmath6 and @xmath7 decays .",
    "in addition , cleo - c has analyzed 195 pb@xmath4 of @xmath8 annihilation data near @xmath9 mev for studies of @xmath1 decays .",

    "babar has studied @xmath16 using a sample of @xmath17 decays .",
    "these examples illustrate that charm produced both in the continuum and in @xmath2 meson decays are useful for studies of charm at the @xmath2-factories .",

    "this analysis makes use of a double tag technique initially used by mark iii  @xcite . in this technique the yields of single tags , where one @xmath0 meson is reconstructed per event , and double tags , where both @xmath0 mesons are reconstructed , are determined .",
    "the number of single tags , separately for @xmath0 and @xmath18 decays , are given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the efficiency and branching fraction for mode @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , the number of double tags reconstructed are given by @xmath24 where @xmath23 and @xmath25 label the @xmath0 and @xmath18 mode used to reconstruct the event and @xmath26 is the efficiency for reconstructing the final state .",
    "combining the equations above and solving for @xmath27 gives the number of produced @xmath28 events as @xmath29 and the branching fractions @xmath30 in this analysis cleo - c determine all the single tag and double tag yields in data , determine the efficiencies from monte carlo simulations of the detector response , and extract the branching fractions and @xmath28 yields from a combined fit to all measured data yields .",
    "this analysis uses three @xmath6 decays ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , and @xmath33 ) and six @xmath7 modes ( @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath39 ) .",

    "babar@xcite has used a sample of 124 fb@xmath4 recorded at the @xmath44 .",
    "cleo - c and babar finds branching fractions in good agreement with each other , @xmath45 and @xmath46 respectively .",
    "it has commonly been assumed that @xmath49 . however , as pointed out by bigi and yamamoto@xcite this is not generally true as for many @xmath0 decays there are contributions from cabibbo favored and cabibbo suppressed decays that interfere and contributes differently to final states with @xmath48 and @xmath47 . as an example consider @xmath50 .",
    "contributions to these final states involve the cabibbo favored decay @xmath51 as well as the cabibbo suppressed decay @xmath52 .",
    "however , we do nt observe the @xmath53 and the @xmath54 but rather the @xmath48 and the @xmath47 .",
    "as these two amplitudes interfere constructively to form the @xmath48 final state we will see a rate asymmetry . based on factorization bigi and yamamoto predicted @xmath55 using tagged @xmath0 mesons cleo - c has measured this asymmetry and obtained @xmath56 which is in good agreement with the prediction .",

    "recently there has been a lot of progress on the determination of absolute hadronic branching fractions of @xmath0 and @xmath1 mesons . here",
    "recent results from cleo - c and the b - factory experiments , babar and belle , were reported .",
