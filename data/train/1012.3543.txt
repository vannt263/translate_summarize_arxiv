    "quantum entanglement , a manifestation of non - locality , is a precious resource for quantum computation and quantum information @xcite and signifies correlations in many - body systems . quantum algorithms that would significantly accelerate a classical computation must rely on highly entangled states since slightly entangled states can be simulated efficiently on a classical computer @xcite . the strength of correlations of fluctuations of observables ( such as density , magnetization , etc . ) in a many - body system is a reflection of the degree of entanglement ( for pure states ) @xcite .",
    "thus , characterization of multi - particle entanglement and production of maximal / high multi - qubit entanglement is vital for quantum computational studies and for mutual enrichment of quantum information and many - body condensed matter physics",
    ".    intensive work on entanglement during the past decade has led to the proposal of numerous measures of entanglement @xcite . while two - party entanglement is quite well understood",
    ", entanglement in a multi - party system is an area of immense current interest @xcite . in the quest for maximally entangled states , so far only few - qubit maximally entangled states such as two - qubit bell states , three - qubit greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) states , and four - qubit higuchi - sudbery ( hs ) states @xcite have been clearly identified .",
    "it would be of considerable interest to generate these maximally entangled states as the ground states of a physically realizable spin model .",
    "while the ghz states could be obtained as the ground state of an anisotropic heisenberg model @xcite , maximally entangled four - qubit and five - qubit states could be obtained only as excited states @xcite .",
    "decoherence is one of the main obstacles for the preparation , observation , and implementation of multi - qubit entangled states . since coupling to the environment and the concomitant entanglement fragility are ubiquitous @xcite , it is imperative that progress be made in understanding decoherence as well . in the past decoherence - free - subspace ( dfs )",
    "@xcite has been shown to exist in the hilbert space of a model where all qubits of the quantum system are coupled to a common environment with equal strength .",
    "this situation manifests when the distance between the qubits is negligible compared to the correlation length of the environment .",
    "if the dynamic symmetry of the system - environment interaction selects a set of orthonormal basis vectors ( of the reduced hilbert space ) that is unaffected by environmental interaction , then such a subspace is called a dfs .",
    "an important application of decoherence free subspaces lies in developing quantum error correcting codes @xcite .",
    "these subspaces prevent the loss of information due to destructive environmental interactions and thus circumvent the need for stabilization methods for quantum computation and quantum information .",
    "decoherence free states have also been shown to be useful for quantum communication between parties without a common reference frame @xcite .",
    "+ rvb states have provided interesting insights for understanding strongly correlated phenomena such as physics of high @xmath2 cuprates @xcite , superconductivity in organic solids @xcite , insulator - superconductor transition in boron - doped diamond @xcite , etc .",
    "furthermore , rvb states have also been proposed as robust basis states for topological quantum computation @xcite .",
    "the multi - particle entanglement has also been investigated in rvb states that were proposed as states close in energy to the ground state of the heisenberg hamiltonian @xcite .",
    "however , there has been no explicit construction of rvb states that would represent maximally entangled valence bond states . in this paper",
    "we construct a new class of rvb states that are ground states of irhm , that have high @xmath1 entanglement , and are decoherence free .",
    "our irhm hamiltonian couples to an environment that distinguishes between the qubits unlike the case considered in ref . .",
    "we believe that an improved understanding of the entanglement and decoherence properties of rvb states will enable their implementation for quantum computation and quantum information purposes .",

    "ii , we introduce entanglement entropy and demonstrate explicitly that isotropy and homogeneity maximizes entanglement @xmath1 between two spins and the rest of the system in the two limits of even - n - qubits , i.e. , for @xmath3 and @xmath4 . for intermediate even - n - spin states , our proposed entangled states are only shown to maximize @xmath1 among valence - bond states . in section iii , from the ground states of our irhm , we construct explicitly states with maximal @xmath1 entanglement among valence - bond states and show that these states form a special class of rvb states .",
    "next , in section iv , we analyze the robustness of this special class of entangled states .",
    "we show that our irhm hamiltonian , even upon inclusion of both local and global optical phonons that are coupled to spins , produces ground states that are decoherence free .",
