    "the magnetism in @xmath2 and @xmath3 transition metal ( tm ) oxides , particularly realized in iridates and rhodates , has recently attracted a lot of interest . in these systems ,",
    "the interplay between the spin - orbit ( so ) coupling , the crystal field ( cf ) splitting , and coulomb and hund s coupling leads to a rich variety of magnetic exchange interactions , new types of magnetic ground states and excitations .    in our recent work@xcite ( hereafter referred to as paper i ) , we applied the mott insulator scenario , extending the original study by jackeli and khalliulin ,  @xcite and developed a theoretical framework for the derivation of effective super - exchange hamiltonians that govern the magnetic properties of systems with strong so coupling . in our approach ,",
    "both the many - body ( coulomb and hund s interaction ) and the single electron ( so and cf interactions ) effects are treated on an equal footing . in this framework",
    ", we first determined the localized degrees of freedom of the iridium system by finding the exact eigenstates of the single - ion microscopic hamiltonian for ir@xmath4 ions , and then computed the interactions between them .",
    "because of time reversal symmetry of the single - ion hamiltonian , the lowest atomic state is always at least two - fold degenerate , and can be described using pseudospin-@xmath5 operators .    in paper",
    "i , some of us showed that the super - exchange hamiltonian describing interactions between these pseudospins might have unusual anisotropic components .",
    "moreover , these anisotropic interactions might be the dominating interactions between magnetic moments .",
    "the form of these anisotropic interactions may also be quite unusual .",
    "in particular , they do not need to be confined to the traditional anisotropic interaction types acting equally on all sites of the lattice ( i.e. easy - plane or easy - axis anisotropy ) .",
    "instead , the anisotropic interactions might involve coupling between different components of spins sitting on different lattice sites .",
    "the dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction@xcite and the kitaev interaction on the honeycomb lattice@xcite are salient examples of such interactions .",

    "the nearest - neighbor ( n. n. ) super - exchange in honeycomb iridates in the absence of lattice distortions , the so - called kitaev - heisenberg ( kh ) model , was first proposed by jackeli and khalliulin .",
    "@xcite they showed that in these systems the coupling between n. n. ir magnetic moments occurs through both direct exchange between ir@xmath4 ions and through a super - exchange coupling mediated by an intermediate oxygen along the 90@xmath14 ir - o - ir bond .",
    "the latter process gives rise to a nonzero anisotropic interaction between pseudospins , which has the form of the aforementioned kitaev interactions , but only for a finite value of the hund s coupling .",
    "the kh model correctly captures the nature of the anisotropic part of the magnetic interactions in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 honeycomb compounds and also predicts some non - trivial properties of these compounds at finite temperatures .",
    "@xcite nevertheless , the model does miss some essential features : it does not account for both the zigzag magnetic order and for the spectrum of magnetic excitations in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 measured in neutron scattering experiments .",

    "we revisit the kh model@xcite and derive its extension up to second neighbor s interactions , starting from the exact eigenstates of the single - ion microscopic hamiltonian which equally includes both the so coupling and the trigonal distortion . in this context",

    "et al_.@xcite we show that the effective spin hamiltonian on the honeycomb lattice , whose bonding geometry is shown in fig .",
    "1 ( a ) , contains several anisotropic spin interactions among which the strongest is the kitaev interaction between nearest neighbors .",
    "we also compute the super - exchange interaction between the second neighbors forming two triangular sublattices , and find that it is of a form similar to the n. n. interaction , i.e. the dominant part can be written as a sum of isotropic heisenberg and anisotropic kitaev terms .",
    "these interactions are only slightly smaller than the n. n. kitaev interactions . other anisotropic interactions , which couple different components of spins on a given bond , are significantly smaller and most of them are non - zero only in the presence of trigonal lattice distortions . in this respect",
    "they are different from the kitaev - like interactions which are present even in the ideal structure .",
    "the magnetic phase diagram which emerges from our study is presented in fig .",
    "this is the key result of this paper .",
    "we argue that the zigzag magnetic order , experimentally observed in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , is stabilized by the interplay of four major interactions : isotropic _ antiferromagnetic _ and anisotropic _ ferromagnetic _ kitaev interactions for n. n. bonds , isotropic _ ferromagnetic _ and anisotropic _ antiferromagnetic _ kitaev interactions for the next - nearest neighbors . unlike in other theoretical studies of magnetic properties of na@xmath0iro@xmath1@xcite , in our model the zigzag phase",

    "[ sec : conclusion ] with a summary and discussion of our results .",
    "in all iridates considered here , the ir@xmath4 ions sit inside an oxygen cage forming an octahedron .",
    "this octahedral cf splits the five 5@xmath16 orbitals of ir@xmath4 into doubly degenerate @xmath17 orbitals at higher energy and into the three - fold degenerate @xmath18 multiplet . in iridates ,",
    "the energy difference between @xmath17 and @xmath18 levels is large and is typically of the order 2 - 3 ev .",
    "because of this , the five electrons occupy only the low lying @xmath18 orbitals . as a consequence , the on - site interactions , such as the so , coulomb and hund s interactions , as well as additional symmetry - lowering cf interactions , e.g. the trigonal cf , can be considered within the @xmath18 manifold only . in this limit of large octahedral cf ,",
    "the so coupling has to be projected onto the @xmath18 manifold , assuming an effective orbital angular momentum @xmath19 . in terms of local axes , which are bound to the oxygen octahedron , the @xmath18 orbitals of ir ions are @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the so and trigonal cf interactions give rise to a splitting of the levels according to the symmetry of the underlying lattice . in the case of the honeycomb iridates , a@xmath0iro@xmath1",
    ", the trigonal cf arises from a compression of the oxygen cages along the @xmath23 $ ] directions ( local @xmath24 axis ) . at ambient pressure ,",
    "the splitting of the @xmath18 levels due to the trigonal cf is about 110 mev  @xcite which is smaller , but of the same order of magnitude as the so coupling , which is about 400 mev .",
    "therefore , here we treat the so coupling and the trigonal cf interactions on the same footing .",
    "also , it is believed that much larger values of the trigonal distortion can be reached by applying uniaxial pressure .",
    "since the hamiltonian is time - reversal invariant , the ground - state of the single - ion single - hole ( @xmath25 configuration of ir@xmath4 ion ) is a kramer s doublet , which we represent as a pseudospin-1/2 .",
    "however , the choice of the two orthonormal states within the doublet that would represent the pseudospin - up and pseudospin - down states deserves some well - inspired consideration , as this choice determines the coordinate system of the final super - exchange hamiltonian . since the most prominent anisotropy , the kitaev interaction , has the simplest form in the coordinate system bound to the cubic axes of the oxygen octahedron environment , we choose the two orthogonal states that correspond to this particular cartesian reference frame . in the absence of the trigonal distortion , the ground state doublet is simply a @xmath26 doublet and the good choice of the states within it are the @xmath27 states . in the presence of the trigonal distortion ,",
    "the choice of the representation is not as straightforward since the ground state doublet contains a mixture of both @xmath26 and @xmath28 states . to resolve this",
    ", we first find a random set of orthonormal states within the doublet and then make linear combinations of them in such a way that pseudospin-1/2 `` up - state '' has no @xmath29 component , whereas pseudospin-1/2 `` down - state '' has no @xmath30 component .",
    "namely , we allow the trigonal cf to admix the @xmath28 states to the @xmath26 states , but we do not allow the latter to mix among themselves .    in the most simple form , the single - ion hamiltonian can be written when the axis of the quantization of angular momentum is along the @xmath23 $ ] direction : @xmath31}^{2},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32}$ ] denotes the component of the angular momentum along the @xmath23 $ ] axis . here",
    "the first term describes the so coupling and the second term describes the trigonal cf .",
    "however , this form is not useful if we want to obtain our final result in the cartesian reference frame bounded to the cubic crystallographic axes .",
    "if now we rewrite the cf term in terms of it s eigenstates , then the hamiltonian ( [ ham_cf - soc ] ) becomes : @xmath33 where the crystal field eigenstates include the low - energy singlet @xmath34 and the higher energy doublet @xmath35 .",
    "the singlet state can be written as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the unit vector parallel to the @xmath23 $ ] trigonal axis ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "the doublet state can be conveniently written using the following chiral basis : @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "now , that the cf part of the hamiltonian is written in an @xmath41-independent way , we are free to choose the angular momentum quantization axis along the cubic @xmath42 direction for our basis .",
    "the basis we use is @xmath43 .",
    "the details of this basis and its relation to the basis of the cubic orbitals are given in paper i.@xcite the hamiltonian matrix in this basis is given by    @xmath44    diagonalization of @xmath45 leads to three doublets at energies @xmath46 corresponding to eigenstates @xmath47 and @xmath48 , @xmath49 corresponding to eigenstates @xmath50 and @xmath51 , and @xmath52 corresponding to eigenstates @xmath53 and @xmath54 . within the ground state doublet ( @xmath47 and @xmath48 ) we choose the orthonormal states such that the @xmath27 states do not mix with each other as mentioned above .      in paper",

    "the super - exchange process which couples the magnetic moments of ir@xmath4 ions originating from the kramers doublet ground states involves intermediate states with either zero holes or two holes .",

    "then , the super - exchange hamiltonian ( [ hamex ] ) on the bond @xmath99 can be written in terms of the magnetic degrees of freedom of ir@xmath4 as @xmath100 @xmath101 label cartesian components of pseudospins .",

    "interactions , the minimal model has to include further neighbor interactions . as we saw in sec.[sec : coupling ] , the dominant microscopic ir - ir couplings also include next n. n. _ ferromagnetic _ heisenberg and _ antiferromagnetic _ kitaev interactions , which also must be considered .",
    "thus , let us study the following super - exchange hamiltonian : @xmath206@xmath207 @xmath208 where @xmath209 , @xmath210 , @xmath168 , @xmath211 , and @xmath212 .",
    "note that in our formulation of the minimal model ( [ minimal ] ) , we also include the third neighbor antiferromagnetic coupling , which was suggested to be crucial for stabilizing the zigzag magnetic order in the previous works.@xcite    it is very important that the presence of the second n. n. kitaev interaction does not change the space group symmetries of the effective model : the model ( [ minimal ] ) has the same symmetries as the original kitaev - heisenberg model .",

    "to explore the physics of the model ( [ minimal ] ) , we fix n. n. interactions to @xmath214 mev and @xmath215 mev values , which were obtained by quantum chemistry calculations by katukuri _",
    "et al_@xcite and are within the range of parameters obtained by us in this paper .",
    "we compute the phase diagram not only for ferromagnetic , @xmath168 , but also for antiferromagnetic , @xmath216 , second neighbor interaction .",
    "this allows us to compare our findings with other phase diagrams that were previously obtained in the literature.@xcite the simulations were performed at low temperature @xmath217 , at which for the full range of the considered parameters the model is in the magnetically ordered state .",
    "the phase diagram of the model ( [ minimal ] ) in the limit of zero second neighbor kitaev interaction , @xmath218 , is presented in fig . 5 ( a ) .",
    "a more realistic phase diagram computed with @xmath219 is presented in fig . 5 ( b ) . even at first glance",
    ", we see that the second n. n. kitaev interaction suppresses the ferromagnetic and spiral phases and stabilizes the antiferromagnetic zigzag and stripy phases .    in order to get a better sense of the basic structure of the different states composing the phase diagrams",
    ", we also performed a numerical fourier transform of a snapshot of the ground state spin configuration at a given point of the phase diagram . from that fourier",
    "transform , we computed the corresponding spin structure factor , which allows us to determine the dominant wavevectors of that configuration .",
    "we plot the spin structure factors in fig . 5 ( c ) .",
    "the @xmath218 phase diagram is very rich , but overall it is qualitatively similar to both the classical phase diagram of the @xmath221@xcite and of the pure heisenberg @xmath222 model on the honeycomb lattice.@xcite it displays the ferromagnetic ( blue region ) , the stripy ( rose region ) and the zigzag antiferromagnetic states ( green region ) , the @xmath223incommensurate spiral state ( white region ) , the 120@xmath12 order ( cyan region ) and a very particular multi-@xmath224 incommensurate state ( dark cyan region ) , which we call an `` intermediate '' phase , as it always separates the 120@xmath12 order from either the stripy or the zigzag phases .",
    "the nel antiferromagnetic order is also one of the possible ground states of the model .",
    "however , the n. n. kitaev term , @xmath157 , and the second neighbor heisenberg term , @xmath172 , destabilize it in favor of the stripy and zigzag phases .",
    "the nel order is realized only at values of @xmath225 , which are not shown in the fig . 5 ( a ) .",
    "the simplest state we find on the phase diagram is the ferromagnetic state which is characterized by a single @xmath226 wavevector .",
    "this state is the ground state in the region of large ferromagnetic @xmath172 and small @xmath227 couplings . as @xmath172",
    "is decreased and @xmath227 is increased , the ferromagnetic state becomes unstable with respect to a spiral state , which is built out of three incommensurate wavevectors related by @xmath24 rotation .",
    "because the ordering @xmath224 vectors are not connected by reciprocal lattice vectors , the spiral phase represents an example of a @xmath223incommensurate order .",
    "note that the magnitude of the ordering wavevector @xmath228 varies throughout the phase .",
    "the stripy and zigzag antiferromagnetic orders are found for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic @xmath172 interaction of intermediate strength . however , while the stripy order is found at small values of the third n. n. interaction , @xmath227 , the experimentally observed zigzag order is found only at values @xmath229 which seem too large given that tight - binding hopping amplitudes are clearly dominated by the n. n. and the second neighbor terms.@xcite both the stripy and the zigzag phases are single-@xmath224 orders , characterized by one of the symmetry related wavevectors : @xmath230 , @xmath231 and @xmath232 .    the stripy and the zigzag phases are separated by a 120@xmath14 state characterized by one of the @xmath233 , @xmath234 and @xmath235 wavevectors . because these vectors are connected by the reciprocal lattice vectors , this is a coplanar single-@xmath224 spiral which describes the 120@xmath14 spin ordering within each of the two sublattices forming the honeycomb lattice . as @xmath110 , @xmath111 and @xmath42 components of spins",
    "are all equally modulated in this 120@xmath14 state , the spins in this state are lying in one of the ( 111 ) planes .",
    "the transition from the stripy and the zigzag states into the 120@xmath14 state is not direct ; it happens through the intermediate phase .",
    "this transition can be understood by looking at the evolution of the spin structure factors .",
    "we find that before the onset of the 120@xmath14 state the transition from a single-@xmath224 stripy ( or a single-@xmath224 zigzag ) state to a state defined by a superposition of three different stripy ( zigzag ) phases .",
    "the structure factor for this state is characterized by the presence of six peaks situated in the middle of the edges of the first bz hexagon .",
    "these peaks split into two incommensurate peaks with @xmath224 vectors sliding along the edges ( see fig . 5 ( c ) for the structure factor corresponding to the intermediate phase ) until they reach wavevectors at the hexagon s corners characterizing the 120@xmath14 structure .",
    "here , we note that this 120@xmath14 state separating the stripy and the zigzag phases was also obtained by rau _",
    "et al_@xcite as a classical ground state of the n. n. super - exchange in the presence of the symmetric off - diagonal exchange .",
    "here a comment is in order . in each of the stripy and",
    "the zigzag phases obtained in the kitaev - heisenberg models without further neighbor interactions,@xcite the spins were aligned along one of the cubic directions .",
    "the spin direction was locked to the spatial orientation of a stripy or a zigzag pattern defined by the wavector @xmath224 .",
    "both the locking of the spin direction and the way the translational symmetry is broken , i.e. the choice of @xmath224 , are defined on the classical level .    in the absence of @xmath172 and @xmath227 interactions ,",
    "the stripy phase is stabilized only for the ferromagnetic n. n. kitaev interaction , @xmath210 , and the zigzag phase is stabilized only for the antiferromagnetic n. n. kitaev interaction , @xmath236 .",
    "consider the stripy order with ferromagnetic @xmath42-bonds . in this state , the spins and , therefore , the order parameter are pointing along @xmath42 cubic axis .",
    "this state has the lowest classical energy , because such a direction of the order parameter maximizes the energy gain due to the ferromagnetic kitaev interaction on ferromagnetic @xmath42-bonds .",
    "the same reasoning explains why the spins in @xmath110 and @xmath111 stripes are pointing along the @xmath110 and @xmath111 axes respectively .",
    "next , consider the zigzag order characterized by ferromagnetic @xmath6 and @xmath7bonds . in this state",
    ", the spins also point along the @xmath42 cubic axis because it maximizes the energy gain due to the antiferromagnetic kitaev interaction on the antiferromagnetic @xmath8 bonds .    in the presence of further neighbor couplings",
    "the situation is different . as we can see in fig . 5 ( a )",
    ", both the stripy and the zigzag order can be stabilized for the ferromagnetic n. n. kitaev interaction . while the situation for the stripy phase is the same as before , where the spins point along the cubic direction corresponding to the label of the ferromagnetic bond to gain energy from the ferromagnetic kitaev interaction , the direction of the zigzag order parameter is not defined on the classical level .",
    "instead , there are two ferromagnetic bonds in the zigzag phase , e.g. @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "thus , all zigzag states characterized by an order parameter pointing along any direction in the @xmath237-plane are classically degenerate .",
    "the direction of the order parameter is then selected by order from disorder mechanism , in which spin fluctuations ( quantum or thermal ) remove the accidental degeneracy and select the true ordered state .",
    "we have checked with monte carlo simulations that thermal fluctuations again choose the states in which spins point along either @xmath110 or @xmath111 cubic directions . the full finite - temperature phase diagram for the model ( [ minimal ] )",
    "will be published elsewhere .      in fig .",
    "5 ( b ) , we present the magnetic phase diagram of the model ( [ minimal ] ) when the second neighbor kitaev interaction is equal to @xmath219 , as predicted by our theory when the second neighbors are coupled only through the ir - o - na - o - ir superexchange path .",
    "we see that the phase diagram greatly simplifies .",
    "the second neighbor kitaev term suppresses the spiral and the ferromagnetic phases in favor of the stripy and zigzag order which now dominate for antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic @xmath172 , respectively .",
    "these two phases are still separated by the 120@xmath14 order and intermediate phase , but both the 120@xmath14 phase and , especially , the intermediate phase shrink significantly . however , the most important effect of the second neighbor kitaev term is that for sufficient ferromagnetic @xmath168 , it stabilizes the zigzag even for @xmath239 . in fig .",
    "5 ( b ) , we put the red star next to the point which might well characterize the set of interactions for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 .",
    "it is worth noting that addition of non - zero @xmath173 interaction also does not determine the direction of zigzag order parameter on the classical level .",
    "for the zigzag order with antiferromagnetic @xmath42-bonds discussed above , all states with spins lying in the @xmath237-plane remain classically degenerate .",
    "this can be understood as follows . in the zigzag order with antiferromagnetic @xmath42-bonds , the second n. n. @xmath138-bonds",
    "are ferromagnetic while the @xmath136- and @xmath137-bonds are antiferromagnetic .",
    "thus , the antiferromagnetic @xmath173 coupling on these bonds will keep the spins in the @xmath237-plane .",
    "however , since there is an equal number of @xmath136- and @xmath137-bonds , the @xmath173 interaction does not lift the classical degeneracy . a particular spin direction , @xmath110 or @xmath111 , is again chosen by fluctuations .",
    "to summarize , two avenues were explored in this work .",
    "first , we performed the derivation of an effective super - exchange hamiltonian that governs the magnetic properties of the honeycomb iridates treating the many - body and single electron interactions on an equal footing .",
    "we demonstrated that in the presence of strong so coupling , this effective hamiltonian forms a symmetric second - rank tensor with non - equivalent diagonal and non - zero off - diagonal elements .",
    "we performed a detailed analysis of the magnetic interactions as a function of the hund s coupling representing the electronic correlations and the trigonal cf splitting which governs the single - electron physics .",
    "we showed that the main role of the hund s coupling is that it is responsible for the appearance of the kitaev anisotropic interactions via the non - equivalence of the diagonal elements .",
    "the trigonal cf also affects the diagonal interactions , however , it s dominating role is in controlling the strength of the off - diagonal interactions .",
    "while these interactions might be significantly increased by external pressure , at ambient pressure the trigonal cf distortion is small and , consequently , the off - diagonal interactions are subdominant .",
    "thus , we neglected off - diagonal terms in the derivation of the super - exchange model ( [ minimal ] ) , which we believe is the minimal model to describe the na@xmath0iro@xmath1 compound .",
    "this model includes five ir - ir couplings : n. n. _ antiferromagnetic _ heisenberg and _ ferromagnetic _ kitaev interactions , next n. n. _ ferromagnetic _ heisenberg and _ antiferromagnetic _ kitaev interactions , and third n. n. _ antiferromagnetic _ heisenberg interaction .",
    "the study of the classical phase diagram for this minimal model constitutes the second part of the paper .",
    "we computed the low temperature phase diagram of the effective model ( [ minimal ] ) with classical monte carlo simulations . due to the presence of the anisotropic kitaev interactions and the frustration introduced by the competition of the spin couplings between n. n. and second neighbors ,",
    "the resulting phase diagram is very rich .",
    "it contains both various commensurate states and incommensurate single-@xmath224 and multi-@xmath224 phases , whose regions of stability are controlled by the ratios between competing exchange constants .",
    "we showed that the second neighbor kitaev term plays an important role in the stabilization of the commensurate antiferromagnetic zigzag phase which has been experimentally observed in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 . in our simulations",
    ", we found this phase to be the ground state for parameters of the model of both the correct signs and magnitudes .",

    "<S> using classical monte carlo simulations we examine the magnetic phase diagram of the derived super - exchange model . </S>",
    "<S> zigzag - type antiferromagnetic order is found to occupy a large part of the phase diagram of the model and , for ferromagnetic next - nearest neighbor heisenberg interaction relevant for na@xmath0iro@xmath1 , it can be stabilized even in the absence of third nearest neighbor coupling . </S>",
    "<S> our results suggest that a natural physical origin of the zigzag phase experimentally observed in na@xmath0iro@xmath1 is due to the interplay of the kitaev anisotropic interactions between nearest and next - nearest neighbors . </S>"
