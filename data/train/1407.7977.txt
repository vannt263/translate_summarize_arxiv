    "negative index materials ( nims ) were first investigated theoretically by veselago in @xcite and were innovated by nicorovici et al . in @xcite and pendry in  @xcite .",
    "the existence of such materials was confirmed by shelby et al . in @xcite .",
    "the study of nims has attracted a lot attention in the scientific community thanks to their many applications .",
    "one of the appealing ones is cloaking .",
    "there are at least three ways to do cloaking using nims . the first one is based on plasmonic structures introduced by alu and engheta in @xcite .",
    "the second one uses the concept of complementary media .",
    "this was suggested by lai et al . in @xcite and confirmed theoretically in @xcite for a slightly different scheme .",
    "the last one is based on the concept of anomalous localized resonance discovered by milton and nicorovici in @xcite . in this paper , we concentrate on the last method .    cloaking via anomalous localized resonance ( calr ) was discovered by milton and nicoro- + vici in @xcite .",
    "their work has root from @xcite ( see also @xcite ) where the localized resonance was observed and established for constant symmetric plasmonic structures in the two dimensional quasistatic regime .",
    "more precisely , in @xcite , the authors studied core - shell plasmonic structures in which a circular shell has permittivity @xmath0 while the core and the matrix , the complement of the core and the shell , have permittivity 1 .",
    "here @xmath1 denotes the loss of the material in the shell .",
    "let @xmath2 and @xmath3 be the outer and the inner radius of the shell .",
    "they showed that there is a critical radius @xmath4 such that a dipole is not seen by an observer away from the core - shell structure , hence it is cloaked , if and only if the dipole is within distance @xmath5 of the shell ; moreover , the power @xmath6 of the field @xmath7 , which is roughly speaking @xmath8 , blows up .",
    "they called this phenomenon cloaking via anomalous localized resonance .",
    "two key features of this phenomenon are :    1 .   the localized resonance , i.e.",
    ", the fields blow up in some regions and remain bounded in some others as the loss goes to 0 . 2 .",
    "the connection between the localized resonance and the blow up of the power as the loss goes to 0 .",
    "their work has opened a new way of cloaking and has been a source of inspiration for many investigations see @xcite .",
    "let us discuss recent progress on calr . in @xcite , bouchitte and schweizer proved that a small circular inclusion of radius @xmath9 ( with @xmath10 fast enough ) is cloaked by the core - shell plasmonic structure mentioned above in the two dimensional quasistatic regime if the inclusion is located within distance @xmath5 of the shell .",
    "otherwise it is visible . concerning the second feature of calr",
    ", the blow up of the power was studied for a more general setting by ammari et al . in @xcite and kohn et al . in @xcite .",
    "more precisely , they considered non - radial core - shell structures in which the shell has permittivity @xmath0 and the core and the matrix have permitivity 1 . in @xcite ,",
    "ammari et al .",
    "dealt with arbitrary shells in the two dimensional quasistatic regime .",
    "they provided a characterization of sources for which the power blows up .",
    "their characterization is based on the spectrum of a self - adjoint compact operator ( neumann - poincar type operator ) . in @xcite , kohn et al . considered core - shell structures in the two dimensional quasistatic regime",
    "in which the matrix is radial symmetric but the core is not .",
    "using a variational approach , they established the blow up of the power for a class of sources concentrated on circles within distance @xmath11 of the core - shell region @xmath12 if the core is inside @xmath13 .",
    "they also showed that the power remains bounded for a class of sources concentrated on circles outside @xmath14 if the core is round , inside , and close to @xmath13 .",
    "the localized resonance associated with calr has been so far discussed only for simple geometries , see @xcite .    an important class of nims in which the localized resonance might appear is the class of reflecting complementary media see @xcite .",
    "the concept of reflecting complementary media for a general core - shell structure was introduced and studied in @xcite .",
    "this class is inspired from the pivotal work of nicorovici et al . in @xcite and from the important notion of complementary media suggested by ramakrishna and pendry in @xcite",
    "nevertheless , the complementary property is not enough to ensure that calr takes place as discussed in @xcite .",
    "therefore , the study of the two features 1 ) and 2 ) together in calr is of necessity and importance .    in this paper , we investigate calr for a subclass of complementary media called the class of doubly complementary media for a core - shell structure , which will be given in definition  [ def - dcm ] .",
    "this class is rich enough to allow us to cloak an * arbitrary source * concentrating on an * arbitrary smooth bounded manifold of codimension 1 * placed in an * arbitrary medium * via anomalous localized resonance ( see section  [ sect - cloaking ] ) ; the cloak is independent of the source . roughly speaking ,",
    "the shell is not only reflecting complementary to a part of the matrix but also to a part of the core .",
    "we establish the following three properties on calr for doubly complementary media , which are what one would expect from a structure for which calr takes place :    1 .",
    "calr appears if and only if the power blows up ( theorem  [ thm1 ] ) .",
    "the power blows up if the source is located  near \" the shell ( theorem  [ thm2 ] ) .",
    "3 .   the power remains bounded if the source is far away from the shell ( theorem  [ thm3 ] ) .",
    "* property p2 ) * , the blow up of the power , is in fact established for * reflecting complementary media*. we also address qualitative estimates on the distance from the source to the shell for which calr does or does not appear in various situations ( theorems  [ thm2 ] and [ thm3 ] ) .",

    "<S> this paper is devoted to the study of cloaking via anomalous localized resonance ( calr ) in the two and three dimensional quasistatic regimes . </S>",
    "<S> calr associated with negative index materials was discovered by milton and nicorovici in @xcite for constant plasmonic structures in the two dimensional quasistatic regime . </S>",
    "<S> two key features of this phenomenon are the localized resonance , i.e. , the fields blow up in some regions and remain bounded in some others , and the connection between the localized resonance and the blow up of the power of the fields , as the loss goes to 0 . an important class of negative index materials for which the localized resonance might appear is the class of reflecting complementary media introduced in @xcite . it was showed in @xcite that complementary property of media is not enough to ensure a connection between the blow up of the power and the localized resonance . in this paper , we study calr for a subclass of complementary media called the class of doubly complementary media . </S>",
    "<S> this class is rich enough to allow us to cloak an * arbitrary source * concentrating on an * arbitrary smooth bounded manifold of codimension 1 * placed in an * arbitrary medium * via anomalous localized resonance ; the cloak is independent of the source . </S>",
    "<S> the following three properties are established for doubly complementary media : p1 ) calr appears if and only if the power blows up ; p2 ) the power blows up if the source is located  near \" the plasmonic structure ; p3 ) the power remains bounded if the source is far away from the plasmonic structure . </S>",
    "<S> * property p2 ) * , the blow up of the power , is in fact established for * reflecting complementary media*. the proofs of these results are based on several new observations and ideas . </S>",
    "<S> one of the difficulties in the study of this problem is to handle the localized resonance . to this end , we extend the reflecting and the removing localized singularity techniques introduced in @xcite , and implement the separation of variables for cauchy problems for a general shell . </S>",
    "<S> the results in this paper are inspired by and imply recent ones of ammari et al . in @xcite and kohn et al . in @xcite in two dimensions and extend theirs for general non - radial core - shell structures in both two and three dimensions .    </S>",
