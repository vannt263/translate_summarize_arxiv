    "we consider two possible radio emission mechanisms for denis1048 : gyrosynchrotron emission and electron - cyclotron maser ( ecm ) emission .",
    "the spectral shape and amplitude are clearly inconsistent with thermal emission .",
    "gyrosynchrotron and ecm mechanisms are both associated with mildly relativistic , non - thermal electron populations , with energies @xmath36kev . whereas gyrosynchrotron emission is caused by incoherently radiating non - thermal electrons propagating along magnetic field lines , ecm emission is coherent , and requires these electrons to have an anisotropic pitch - angle distribution @xcite .",
    "gyrosynchrotron emission is characterized by a negatively - sloped power - law spectrum at high frequencies , corresponding to optically thin emission , and a positively - sloped spectrum at lower frequencies corresponding to optically thick emission .",
    "ecm emission , however , occurs at frequencies corresponding to low harmonics of the local cyclotron frequency , and does not have a characteristic spectral shape @xcite .",
    "time - variable emission from uds is up to 100% circularly polarized and tightly beamed , and is hence interpreted as ecm emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "gyrosynchrotron emission has been hypothesized by a variety of authors for radio - loud uds in quiescent states ( e.g. , bp05 ; * ? ? ?",
    "the observed radio properties of denis1048 are more suggestive of gyrosynchrotron emission than ecm emission for three reasons :    * the negatively - sloped power - law spectrum we observe is expected of optically - thin gyrosynchrotron emission , whereas no particular spectral shape is uniquely identified with ecm emission . *",
    "if the 1.2 cm emission were caused by an ecm mechanism , the emission would need to originate in a stable region with a magnetic field strength of approximately 6.4 kg to be consistent with emission at the fundamental cyclotron frequency .",
    "unless the line of sight is nearly aligned with the rotation axis , such a region must also cover a significant fraction of the stellar surface , which is unlikely @xcite . *",
    "the lack of significant modulation is marginally inconsistent with the tight beaming of ecm emission .",
    "while we can not conclusively rule out an ecm emission mechanism , we interpret the radio emission we observe from denis1048 as optically thin gyrosynchrotron emission . in this interpretation ,",
    "the large observed stokes v fractions are consistent with a strong line - of - sight magnetic field component .",
    "furthermore , the number of radiating electrons , @xmath37 , per unit energy , @xmath38 , can be written as a power law , @xmath39 , where @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "we find @xmath41 , consistent with expected values between @xmath42 and @xmath43 for gyrosynchrotron - emitting electrons @xcite .",
    "assuming @xmath44ergs@xmath19 after @xcite for denis1048 , the gdel - benz relation implies an average radio flux density between 5ghz and 8ghz of less than 42@xmath30jy . at the lowest observing frequency",
    ", the measured flux density is an order of magnitude greater .",
    "we propose a model for the magnetosphere of denis1048 that accounts for the violation of the gdel - benz relation . for samples of fast - rotating m dwarfs ,",
    "an observed decrease in @xmath45 with rotation period @xcite is interpreted as evidence for the decoupling of hot coronal plasma beyond a co - rotation radius , @xmath2 .",
    "we hypothesize that this effect does not reduce @xmath46 .",
    "we further suggest that :    1 .",
    "@xmath2 represents the alfvn radius of the star , and the magnetic field structure beyond @xmath2 is radial approximately and dominated by the outflow of non - thermal electrons .",
    "electron acceleration occurs at @xmath2 , possibly through magnetic reconnection @xcite .    in this model , the gyrosynchrotron emission we observe originates from non - thermal electrons streaming radially outwards from @xmath2 . a radial magnetic field structure in this region",
    "is justified by the lack of significant variability in the radio lightcurve .",
    "the radio emission is characterized by three parameters : @xmath2 , the total non - thermal electron density , @xmath47 , at @xmath2 , and the radial magnetic field strength , @xmath48 , at @xmath2 .",
    "we attempted to uniquely measure these parameters through a fit to the measured spectrum of denis1048 , using expressions from @xcite for the total and circularly - polarized intensities of gyrosynchrotron emission .",
    "a large number of parameter combinations were found to fit the data .",
    "two assumptions , however , allowed the free parameters to be constrained within the ranges given in table 2 .",
    "first , we assumed that the spectral peak of the gyrosynchrotron emission @xcite did not lie within the spectral band , as justified by the regularity of the observed power - law spectrum .",
    "we also limited @xmath49 g in the dipole approximation , where 2700 g is the upper limit on the surface magnetic field strength placed by @xcite . the stellar radius , @xmath50 , is further assumed ( after , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) to be equivalent to a jupiter radius .",
    "ccc 1.2 to 2.9 & @xmath51 to @xmath52 & 70 to 260",
    "we have utilised the unprecedented frequency coverage of the the upgraded atca to characterize the radio spectrum of the ud denis1048 . between 4.5ghz and 24ghz",
    ", the spectrum follows a strikingly regular power - law with index @xmath1 .",
    "this spectral shape , the lack of time - variability , and circular polarization fractions between 0.25@xmath00.4 in the 6 cm band , are suggestive of a gyrosynchrotron mechanism for the radio emission .",
    "further work is required to improve and test the model we present .",
    "an observation of a peak frequency in the spectrum of denis1048 would break the degeneracy between the free parameters .",
    "it is possible that the model predicts correlations between radio emission characteristics of uds and the stellar parameters .",
    "such correlations are yet to be investigated . finally ,",
    "the model does not account for radio emission other than from a gyrosynchrotron mechanism , or for time - variable emission .",
