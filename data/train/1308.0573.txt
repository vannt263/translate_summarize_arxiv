    "electromagnetic fields can be expressed in terms of the scalar and the vector potentials @xmath4 and @xmath5 . while the physical fields are unique , there is a certain degree of freedom in the choice of the potentials .",
    "specifically , electric and magnetic fields in gaussian units are @xmath6 and @xmath7 . a gauge transformation @xmath8 leaves the physical quantities @xmath9 and @xmath10 unchanged , if @xmath11 satisfy the lorentz condition  @xcite .",
    "the gauging function @xmath11 allows us to transform between different representations of @xmath5 and @xmath4 in different gauges , although the physical quantities , _ e.g. _ observables , are gauge invariant .",
    "the hamiltonian for an optical electron in external electromagnetic field may be written as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the core potential seen by the electron .    in our current discussion",
    ", we treat the electromagnetic field as a plane wave propagating along the @xmath14-direction , and describe the electric field as @xmath15 . in the velocity gauge ( also known as the transverse or coulomb gauge ) , @xmath16 the length and the velocity gauges are related through the transformation function @xmath17 , leading to potentials in the length gauge  @xcite : @xmath18",
    "in the velocity gauge  , the hamiltonian becomes , @xmath19 we calculate the energy shifts within the floquet formalism of quasi - energy states  @xcite for the third term , and use the first order perturbation theory for the fourth term since it is already second order in the field strength .",
    "the energy shift for a rydberg state @xmath20 therefore becomes @xmath21 the first term can be decomposed into the scalar , vector and tensor contributions .",
    "we focus on the dominant scalar contribution to the stark shift and arrive at @xmath22 where @xmath23 , and we used @xmath24 here @xmath25 is the usual dipole operator .",
    "the summation over the magnetic quantum number can be evaluated explicitly using the wigner - eckart theorem : @xmath26 where @xmath27 are the reduced dipole matrix elements .    the first term in eq .",
    "can be immediately identified as the ponderomotive energy shift for a free electron quivering in electromagnetic field .",
    "notice that it came directly from the @xmath28 term in the hamiltonian  , and it is the dominant term for a rydberg state .",
    "by contrast , the second term in   is the correction to the free electron ponderomotive shift .",
    "all of the resonance structure is included in the second correction term , whereas the free electron shift only provides a smooth background on which the resonance structure sits .",
    "we can express @xmath29 in terms of the conventional ac polarizability through its definition for the plane waves , @xmath30 .",
    "then the ac polarizability in the velocity gauge becomes @xmath31 here @xmath32 is the free electron polarizability .",
    "we now derive eq .   in the length gauge , and thereby establish the gauge invariance . using the length gauge vector and scalar potentials  , the hamiltonian can be expressed as @xmath33 to calculate the energy shifts resulting from the last three terms in the hamiltonian , we again use the quasi - energy formalism  @xcite for the third and the fifth terms , and the first order perturbation theory for the fourth term : @xmath34 upon expanding the square , we encounter three contributions to the first term . out of the three , the dominant one is the @xmath35 term .",
    "the term involving @xmath36 , and the last term involving @xmath37 are suppressed by a factor of @xmath38 and can be safely ignored in the non - relativistic approximation .",
    "the cross term between the @xmath39 and @xmath40 drops out because it is proportional to @xmath41 ^ 2 $ ] which vanishes on the account of @xmath42 being purely imaginary ( due to @xmath43 ) .",
    "we again focus on the dominant scalar contribution to the stark shift , which leaves us with @xmath44 through the definition @xmath30 , the polarizability in the length gauge can be written as : @xmath45 to reveal how this expression relates to @xmath2 and the polarizability in the velocity gauge , we expand the resolvent operator in eq .   in powers of @xmath46 :",
    "@xmath47 this results in a series expansion of the polarizability in the length gauge : @xmath48 this series can be resummed such that the first term is separated out , @xmath49 with the help of the oscillator sum rule , @xmath50 we recover the free electron polarizability from the first term in   when summed over a complete set of states ( note that @xmath51 ) . on the other hand , with the aid of the expansion  , the outer sum in the second term can be collapsed back into the same correction term to the free electron polarizability in the velocity gauge  . thus @xmath52 and @xmath53 .",
    "this expression for the length gauge polarizability is identical to the one in eq .   in the velocity gauge , confirming the equivalence of the ac stark shifts in both gauges , _ i.e. _ the gauge invariance .",
    "these expressions also show how the free electron term originates , and we will demonstrate below that the correction to @xmath54 is indeed very small for rydberg states .    in ref .",
    "@xcite , the emergence of the free electron polarizability in the length gauge has been shown numerically for rydberg states of rb atom .",
    "@xcite has provided an alternative analytical expression using higher rank oscillator sum rules .",
    "however , we find that the formula of ref .",
    "@xcite has poor convergence properties when evaluated numerically .",
    "so far we examined the ac stark effect in the non - relativistic formalism . in the velocity gauge",
    "the dominant contribution came from the expectation value of the vector - potential - squared term @xmath28 .",
    "curiously , the fully - relativistic dirac hamiltonian involves only linear couplings to electromagnetic fields , thereby such term is missing in the lowest - order of perturbation theory .",
    "this naturally raises a question of just how the free - electron polarizability emerges from the relativistic equations .",
    "as we show in this section , it comes from summations over the negative energy ( positron , @xmath55 ) states , i.e. from the dirac sea .",
    "similarly pronounced effects of dirac sea on weak atomic transition amplitudes were found earlier  @xcite in relativistic many - body calculations .",
    "we start with the coupling to electromagnetic fields @xmath56 where @xmath57 are the conventional dirac matrices . in the velocity gauge @xmath58 , so that @xmath59 applying the second - order floquet formalism , we arrive at the fully - relativistic ac polarizability @xmath60    the summation over intermediate states in the above equation spans the complete spectrum of the dirac equation , i.e. , both positive and negative energy states .",
    "it can be shown using the pauli approximation that the sum over the conventional positive energy states recovers the second term ( second - order sum ) in the non - relativistic expression for the ac polarizability .",
    "now we demonstrate that the dominant , free - electron polarizability term , emerges from summing over the negative energy states . in this case , the rydberg electron energy @xmath61 is above the dirac sea level and @xmath62 and @xmath63 ( we naturally assume that the photon energy is well below @xmath64 ) . within this approximation ,",
    "the dynamic ac polarizability becomes @xmath65 the dirac matrices @xmath66 mix the large and the small components of the dirac bi - spinor , @xmath67 .",
    "part of the summation on the right hand side of   can therefore be written as @xmath68 in the non - relativistic approximation , the negative energy states are complete amongst themselves , i.e. @xmath69 , leading to @xmath70 where we used @xmath71 and @xmath72 a.u .. therefore we recover the free electron polarizability in atomic units .",
    "is not interesting that describing purely classical effect of electron quiver motion requires the notion of anti - mater ?",
    "in all our calculations below , we use the single active electron approximation , and represent the atomic core with the model potential using the correct quantum defects for rb and sr atoms from  @xcite : @xmath73 ^ 2 \\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 are @xmath77-dependent screening parameters , and @xmath78 is the static polarizability of the core  @xcite . for illustrative purposes , we pick rb and sr atoms because they have very different core polarizabilities . for rb , the static core polarizability is @xmath799 a.u . , whereas the polarizability for the sr@xmath80 ion with a 5s valence electron serving as spectator is @xmath7991 a.u .",
    ", an order of magnitude larger .",
    "this results in large differences in quantum defects @xmath81 for the @xmath82 rydberg states : for example in the 100s state of rb @xmath83 and for sr @xmath84 . in our calculations , we assume that the sr atom is in a @xmath85 state , and we ignore contributions from the resonant structure from the 5s valence electron .    in order to evaluate polarizabilities in both the length and the velocity gauges , we have to evaluate sums over a complete set of states in   and  .",
    "we check the completeness of our basis using the well known oscillator sum rule .",
    "we find , @xmath86 while summing over @xmath87 states with @xmath88 through 200 for the 100s states of the rb and sr atoms .",
    "we have shown that the rydberg state polarizability in the length   and velocity gauges   are identical as a result of the gauge invariance , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath90 .",
    "furthermore , we have expressed these exact polarizabilities as a sum of the free electron polarizability @xmath2 and an exact correction .",
    "the resonance structure of the polarizabilities is entirely captured by this correction term , whereas @xmath2 only provides a smooth background .",
    "the fractional corrections for various @xmath91s states of rb and sr are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] in the ir region of the spectrum .",
    "the resonant structure is evident in the plots , and the widths of the resonances increase with increasing principal quantum number . also , the sizes of the corrections grow smaller as @xmath91 is increased meaning that the near - free electron approximation to the rydberg electron polarizability gradually becomes more accurate away from the resonances . with the exception of the 10s state , the corrections are well below a per cent for both rb and sr , except at the resonances .    comparing the upper and lower panels of fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] , we observe that the errors made by approximating @xmath92 and @xmath93 by @xmath2 are larger for sr than for rb .",
    "this stems from the larger static polarizability of the sr@xmath80 ion with a 5s valence electron compared to the rb@xmath80 ionic core , a property which is contained in the model potential  .",
    "although the static core polarizabilities for these atoms differ by an order of magnitude , the corrections to @xmath2 are still much less than a percent in both cases , except in the immediate vicinity of resonances .",
    "another feature seen in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] is that the widths of the resonances decrease with increasing principal quantum number .",
    "for example , for rb the width of the 20s-6p resonance is significantly larger than that of the 60s-6p resonance . on the other hand ,",
    "the 10s-6p resonance is so large that the correction to @xmath2 for the 10s state of rb is at least a couple of per cent nearly for all frequencies spanned in fig .",
    "[ fig:01 ] .",
    "similar observations can also be made for sr .",
    "the widening of these resonances with increasing @xmath91 can be qualitatively understood if one realizes that the widths of the resonances in eqs .   and   are controlled by the square of the dipole matrix elements , which scales as @xmath94 .    ref .",
    "@xcite found strong intensity landscape modulations of the effective polarizability for rydberg atoms trapped in ir lattices . because of the low frequency of the trapping field",
    ", the rydberg electron polarizability can potentially deviate quite substantially from the free electron value .",
    "this is because at sufficiently low frequencies the polarizability must approach its static limit , whereas the free electron value diverges . in this paper",
    ", we have shown that the free electron approximation holds , even at ir wavelengths of thousands of nm ."
