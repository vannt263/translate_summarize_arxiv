    "given sets @xmath8 of edges in a graph , a _ ( partial ) rainbow matching _ is a choice of disjoint edges from some of the @xmath9s . in other words , it is a partial choice function whose range is a matching .",

    ", we assume the graph is bipartite and define @xmath0 to be the least number such that if @xmath10 for all @xmath11 , then there exists a full rainbow matching .",
    "a greedy choice of representatives shows that if @xmath12 for all @xmath13 then there is a rainbow matching , namely @xmath14 . on the other hand , for every @xmath3",
    "there exits a family @xmath15 of matchings of size @xmath1 with no full rainbow matching : for an arbitrary @xmath16 let @xmath17 be all equal to the perfect matching in the cycle @xmath18 consisting of the odd edges , and let @xmath19 be all equal to the perfect matching in @xmath18 consisting of the even edges .",
    "this shows that @xmath20 for all @xmath3 ( in fact , this example can be modified to produce @xmath21 matchings of size @xmath1 with no rainbow matching of size @xmath1 ) . in @xcite",
    "it was conjectured that this bound is sharp :    [ main ] @xcite @xmath2 for all @xmath3 .",
    "if true , this would easily imply :    [ conj3 ] a family of @xmath1 matchings in a bipartite graph , each of size @xmath1 , has a rainbow matching of size @xmath22 .",

    "the weaker condition that stein demands on sets @xmath9 is not that they are matchings , but that each has degree at most @xmath24 in one side of the graph , and that jointly their degree at each vertex in the other side is at most @xmath1 .",
    "possibly the ` right ' requirement is even more general : that the degree at each vertex is at most @xmath1 , and that each @xmath9 is a set , and not a multiset , namely it does not contain repeating edges . an even more general conjecture will be presented in the last section .",
    "successive improvements on the trivial bound @xmath14 were @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 @xcite and @xmath27 @xcite .",
