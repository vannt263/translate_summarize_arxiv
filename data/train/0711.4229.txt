    "one obstruction to applications of quantum link invariants associated with a ribbon category @xmath1 stems from the fact that certain simple ( irreducible ) objects of @xmath1 may have zero quantum dimensions .",
    "if the dimension of a simple object @xmath2 is zero , then the quantum invariants of all ( framed oriented ) links with components labeled by @xmath3 are equal to zero .",
    "a well known topological trick allows to derive possibly non - trivial invariants in this setting , at least in the case of knots .",
    "namely , one presents a @xmath3-labeled knot @xmath4 as the closure of a @xmath5 tangle @xmath6 and considers the endomorphism of @xmath3 associated with @xmath6 .",
    "this endomorphism is the product of the identity @xmath7 with an element @xmath8 of the ground ring of @xmath1 .",
    "the tangle @xmath6 is determined by @xmath4 uniquely up to isotopy and therefore @xmath8 is an isotopy invariant of @xmath4 .",
    "this invariant may be non - trivial even when @xmath9 .",
    "note that the usual quantum invariant of @xmath4 is equal to @xmath10 .    for a link @xmath4 with @xmath11 components labeled by @xmath3 ,",
    "the situation is more involved because @xmath8 may depend on the choice of @xmath12 . in",
    "many known examples of ribbon categories , an appropriate re - normalization of @xmath8 does not depend on the choice of @xmath12 and yields a possibly non - trivial invariant of @xmath4 , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "a systematic explanation of this phenomenon seems to be missing in the literature . in this paper",
    "we suggest such an explanation .",
    "it is based on a new notion of an ambidextrous object in @xmath1 .",
    "every simple ambidextrous object @xmath13 determines a certain set @xmath14 of ( isomorphism classes of ) simple objects of @xmath1 . for all simple objects @xmath3 belonging to this set we define a modified ( quantum ) dimension depending on @xmath15 .",
    "the modified dimension may be non - zero when @xmath9 . using the modified dimensions we define an isotopy invariant @xmath16 for any link whose",
    "components are labeled with objects of @xmath1 under the only assumption that at least one of the labels belongs to @xmath14 .",
    "most of these results extend to closed @xmath1-colored ribbon graphs ( i.e. , to @xmath1-colored ribbon graphs with no inputs and no outputs ) .",
    "we give three families of examples illustrating our constructions .",
    "one example : @xmath1 is the category of finite dimensional @xmath17-modules , where @xmath17 be the drinfeld - jimbo @xmath18-algebra associated to a simple complex lie algebra . in this case",
    "we recover the standard reshetikhin - turaev link invariants . in the second example",
    "@xmath1 is the category of topologically free @xmath19-modules of finite rank , where @xmath20 is a lie superalgebra of type i and @xmath19 is its quantized universal enveloping @xmath21$]-superalgebra . in this case",
    "we recover the link invariants defined by the first two authors in @xcite .",
    "these invariants generalize both the multivariable alexander polynomial of links and kashaev s link invariants . in the final example",
    "@xmath1 is the category of finite dimensional weight @xmath22-modules where @xmath23 is a root of unity .",
    "we will show that our construction in this case gives a generalization of the invariants defined by akutsu , deguchi and ohtsuki @xcite , using a regularize of the markov trace and nilpotent representations of @xmath22 at a root of unity . in the later two examples the standard reshetikhin - turaev link invariant coming from @xmath1",
    "is generically zero .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we recall the basic results on ribbon categories . in section 3",
    "we introduce the ambidextrous objects , the modified dimensions and the invariant @xmath24 of closed @xmath1-colored ribbon graphs . in section 4",
