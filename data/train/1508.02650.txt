    "we note that whilst the maps on higgs bundles ( given in  [ iso22higgs ] and proposition [ reali3 ] ) are defined for all higgs bundles , but do not obviously preserve stability properties . on the other hand , the maps on spectral data ( see propositions [ propso21 ] and [ rank3main ] ) automatically preserve stability but apply only to generic points in the moduli spaces - where the stability condition is vacuous .",
    "pending further work we thus limit our remarks to the dense open sets in the moduli spaces which exclude the non - generic fibers of their hitchin fibrations .",
    "we denote these sets by @xmath656 .",
    "note that for the groups in the isogenies studied in this paper , the special linear groups can be identified as the spin groups for the special orthogonal groups .",
    "the induced map @xmath657 is a finite map .",
    "as seen in @xcite , for any @xmath81 , the moduli space @xmath171 has two components corresponding to the two possible values for the second stieffel - whitney class of an @xmath11-principal bundle . in contrast , the underlying holomorphic bundles for the higgs bundles in @xmath658 and @xmath659 have just one topological type , and the moduli spaces are connected .",
    "the images of the maps @xmath71 and @xmath73 thus see just one of the components in @xmath660 or @xmath661 .",
    "indeed , this can be understood from the point of view of the surface group representations corresponding to the higgs bundles via non - abelian hodge theory . from this point of view",
    ", the component in the image of the map contains precisely the representations in @xmath11 which lift to @xmath662 .",
    "we therefore see only the higgs bundles in which the underlying holomorphic bundle has @xmath663 .",
    "the situation is more nuanced for the restriction of the maps to the moduli spaces for the split real forms . in this case , the underlying holomorphic bundles have more complicated topology than in the case of the higgs bundles for the complex groups .",
    "moreover , fixing the topological type of the bundle does not ensure connectedness of the components .",
    "what remains true is that the images of the maps @xmath71 and @xmath73 contain only those components of the moduli spaces in which the higgs bundles correspond to representations which lift to the appropriate spin group .    in terms of hitchin fibrations",
    ", one should note that for each @xmath664 , the bases of the fibrations of @xmath665 and @xmath11-higgs bundles are the same . in the case of @xmath383 the base is @xmath666 , and for @xmath667 it is @xmath668 . in order to understand the maps",
    "induced on these bases it is necessary to understand exactly the relation between coordinates of a point in the base and the coefficients in the defining equation for the spectral curve .",
    "this is completely straightforward for @xmath669 , where the two coincide , but less so in the case of @xmath11 where the relation is complicated by the role of the pfaffian .",
    "in fact , the maps @xmath670 ( for @xmath664 ) do not unambiguously descend to the base of the fibration .",
    "the ambiguity stems from the fact that the induced orthogonal structures on @xmath29 or @xmath44 do not have a canonical orientation .",
    "the choice of orientation corresponds on the one hand to a choice of trivialization on the determinant bundles , and on the other hand to a choice of sign in the pfaffian .",

    "the explicit form of the map depends on the generators chosen for the rings of invariant polynomials .",
    "taking the coefficients of the characteristic equation @xmath672 as generators , it follows from that this map is given on the generic points in the base by @xmath673 where the sign in the last component is determined by the isomorphism @xmath674 .",
    "for example , following the notation of remark [ detiso ] , if @xmath336 is the positively oriented local frame , then @xmath675      [ heuristic ] as explained at the beginning of section [ lie ] , the relation between spectral curves and thus the map can be understood heuristically from the relation between the eigenvalues of the @xmath678 and those of @xmath679 . by remark [ evalsadd ] , at least at smooth unramified points , the equations for the spectral curves @xmath19 and @xmath356 are given by @xmath680 from which the relations between @xmath681 and @xmath352 can be deduced .    as described in ",

    "the moduli space @xmath685 is thus a disjoint union of ( possibly disconnected or empty ) components @xmath686 the moduli space @xmath687 is similarly a disjoint union of ( possibly disconnected or empty ) components @xmath688 for @xmath689 the degrees of the line bundles defining the @xmath341-higgs bundles . as seen in @xcite ,",
    "the components are non - empty if and only if @xmath690 , inequalities which are known as the the milnor - wood bounds .        where @xmath699 are line bundles defining @xmath304-higgs bundles ( see section [ iso22higgs ] ) .",
    "the bounds on @xmath700 follow from the milnor - wood bound for @xmath67-higgs bundles .",
    "the rest of the proposition follows from the observation that the preimage under @xmath71 for any higgs bundle of the form consists of all @xmath701-higgs bundles defined by @xmath702 with @xmath703 and @xmath704 . if @xmath705 then there are @xmath38 solutions for @xmath706 and @xmath707 .    whilst the moduli space of @xmath46-higgs bundles has @xmath38 hitchin components , the one for @xmath412-higgs bundles has just one hitchin component . from the analysis of topological invariants , which are constant on connected components",

    "the isogeny @xmath71 between moduli spaces of higgs bundles takes the @xmath38 hitchin components to the one hitchin component , and the other 2 components to the two components ( possibly disconnected ) where the two @xmath709 s are the same.[hola ]    as seen before , the map @xmath71 constructed in  [ isosingular ]",
    "is surjective onto some of the components of @xmath324 .",
    "the components in the image correspond to those components in the representation variety @xmath710 for which the representations lift to @xmath341 .",
    "we shall denote by @xmath711 the union of components of @xmath324 obtained through ( [ i*bundles ] ) and ( [ i*phi ] ) with @xmath712 equivalently , let @xmath713 be the union of components of @xmath710 which correspond to the components in @xmath714 .",
    "[ cor1 ] the structure group of an @xmath68-higgs bundle lifts to @xmath341 if and only if the @xmath68-higgs bundle lies in @xmath711 .",
    "equivalently , a reductive surface group representation into @xmath68 lifts to a representation into @xmath341 if and only if the representation lies @xmath713 .    by realising @xmath307-higgs bundles in terms of rank 2-higgs bundles",
    ", one can understand the monodromy action studied in @xcite for rank 4 higgs bundles in terms of monodromy of lower rank higgs bundles .",
    "indeed , taking @xmath715 and @xmath318 as in eq .",
    "one recovers the rank 4 monodromy as a product of actions coming from the rank 2-hitchin systems .      to fully specify",
    "the map induced by @xmath73 ( as in ) on @xmath659 one needs to specify the trivialization @xmath716 .",
    "then , using the coefficients of the characteristic equation @xmath672 as generators for the rings of invariant polynomials , it follows from that the map on the generic points of the hitchin base is @xmath717 where the sign in the second component is determined by the isomorphism @xmath674 .    for both n=2,3 the variety @xmath718 has two components . in the case @xmath667 , given @xmath61 the spectral curve defined by @xmath719 , the two components occur in the fibers over both points @xmath720 in the hitchin base . however , on each fiber only one of the components is in the image of the map induced by @xmath73 .",
    "a similar phenomenon occurs for @xmath383 .      as a consequence of its special orthogonal structure ,",
    "the vector bundle in an @xmath46-higgs bundle is classified topologically by a second stiefel - whitney class .",
