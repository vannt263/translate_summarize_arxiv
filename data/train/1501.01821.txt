    "the objective of the present paper is to investigate , analytically and numerically , the concept of quasi - integrability , first proposed in @xcite , in the context of deformations of the exactly integrable bullough - dodd model @xcite . the motivation of our study is to try to shed light on the mechanisms responsible for such interesting non - linear phenomenon which has a large potential for applications in many areas of physics , mathematics and non - linear sciences in general .    as it is well known , solitons in @xmath0-dimensions are solutions of non - linear field equations which travel with constant speed without dispersion and dissipation , and when they scatter through each other they keep their forms , energies , etc , with the only effect being a shift in their positions relative to the ones they would have if the scattering have not occurred .",
    "such extraordinary behavior is credited to the fact that the solitons appear in the so - called exactly integrable field theories in @xmath0-dimensions , that possess an infinite number of exactly conserved charges .",
    "therefore , the only way for the scattering process to preserve the values of such an infinity of charges , is for the solitons to come out of it exactly as they have entered it .",
    "in addition , in most of such theories the strength of the interaction of the solitons is inversely related to the coupling constant , i.e. the solitons are weakly coupled in the strong regime and vice - versa .",
    "such behavior and the large amount of symmetries ( conserved charges ) make the solitons the natural candidates for the normal modes of the theory in the strong coupling regime , opening the way for the development of many non - perturbative techniques in the study of non - linear phenomena .",
    "the drawback of such approach is that exactly integrable soliton theories are rare , and few of them really describe phenomena in the real world .",
    "the observation put forward in @xcite is that many theories which are not integrable present solutions that behave very similarly to solitons , i.e. such soliton like solution scatter through each other without distorting them very much .",
    "it was shown in @xcite in the context of deformations of the sine - gordon model , and then in other theories @xcite , that such quasi - integrable theories possess and infinite number of charges that are asymptotically conserved . by",
    "that one means that during the scattering of two soliton like solutions such charges do vary in time ( and quite a lot sometimes ) but they all return in the remote future ( after the scattering ) to the values they had in the remote past ( before the scattering ) . since in a scattering process",
    "what matters are the asymptotic states , such theories are effectively integrable , and that is why they were named _",
    "quasi - integrable_.    the mechanisms behind such non - linear phenomenon are not well understood yet .",
    "all the examples studied so far are deformations of exactly integrable field theories .",
    "the zero - curvature condition or lax - zakharov - shabat equation @xcite of the integrable theory becomes anomalous when applied to the deformed theory , and so the lax potentials fail to become flat connections when the equations of motion hold true . despite those facts ,",
    "techniques of integrable field theories can be adapted and applied to construct an infinite number of charges @xmath3 which present an anomalous conservation law = ^(n ) the anomalies @xmath4 have some interesting properties .",
    "they vanish exactly when evaluated in one - soliton type solutions , and also vanish for two - soliton type solutions when the two solitons are well separated .",
    "the anomalies are only non - vanishing when the soliton like solutions are close together and interact with each other . for some special classes of soliton like solutions the anomalies @xmath4",
    "have a further striking property .",
    "they have a mirror type symmetry in the sense that the charges have the same values when reflected around a particular value of time @xmath5 , which depends upon the parameters of the solution .",
    "in other words , one finds that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 .",
    "so , the charges are not only asymptotically conserved , i.e. @xmath8 , but are symmetric with respect to a given value of the time .",
    "the only explanation found so far for such behavior of the charges , is that those special soliton like solutions transform in a special way under a space - time parity transformation , where the point in space - time around which space and time are reversed depend upon the parameters of the solution under consideration .",
    "the proof of the connection between parity and mirror symmetry of the charges involves an interplay of the lorentz transformations and internal transformations in the kac - moody algebra underlying the anomalous lax equation .",
    "we do not believe however that such parity property is one of the causes of the quasi - integrability , but it seems to be present whenever such phenomenon occurs .    in this paper we investigate the concept of quasi - integrability in the context of deformations of the bullough - dodd model @xcite involving a complex scalar field @xmath9 in @xmath0-dimensions with lagrangian given by = _",
    "^- v@xmath9 and the potentials being v@xmath9= e^+ e^-@xmath10 with @xmath11 being a real deformation parameter , such that the bullough - dodd model is recovered in the case @xmath12 .",
    "because of some particularities of the vacuum solutions of such models , as explained in section [ sec : intro ] , the physically interesting deformed theories exist only when the parameter @xmath11 is restricted to rational values .",
    "we construct the anomalous zero - curvature condition for the theories with the lax potentials taking values on the twisted @xmath13 kac - moody algebra @xmath14 .",
    "the charges @xmath3 satisfying are obtained by the so - called abelianization procedure @xcite where the lax potentials are gauge transformed into an infinite abelian sub - algebra of @xmath14 .",
    "in fact , due to the anomaly of the zero - curvature only one component of the lax potentials can be rotated into such sub - algebra , leading therefore to the anomalous conservation .",
    "the lax potentials do not transform as vectors under the @xmath0-dimensional lorentz transformations .",
    "however , the grading operator of the kac - moody algebra @xmath14 generates a one - dimensional subgroup isomorphic to the lorentz group , and we show that the lax potentials are vectors under the combined action of those two groups .",
    "that fact allows us to show that the anomalies in do vanish when evaluated on the one - soliton solutions of the theories .",
    "in addition , we show that some special two - soliton solutions lead to the existence of a space - time parity transformation @xmath15 such that the complex scalar field @xmath9 , when evaluated on them , transforms as @xmath16 . for such two - soliton solutions",
    "we show that the real part of the charges @xmath3 satisfy a mirror symmetry , as described above , and are therefore asymptotically conserved .",
    "the imaginary part of the charges however , are not asymptotically conserved .",
    "we also implement a perturbative method to construct solutions of the deformed theory as a power series in the deformation parameter @xmath11 , as @xmath17 , such that @xmath18 is an exact solution of the integrable bullough - dodd model .",
    "we then split the fields into their real and imaginary parts and then into their even and odd parts under the parity transformation @xmath15 , i.e. @xmath19 , with @xmath20 . by starting with an exact solution @xmath18 of the bullough - dodd model that satisfies @xmath21 , or @xmath22 and @xmath23 ,",
    "we show that the pair of fields @xmath24 satisfy a pair of linear non - homogeneous equations , and the pair of fields @xmath25 satisfy a pair of linear homogeneous equations .",
    "therefore , it is always possible to choose solutions where @xmath26 , and so the first order field satisfies , @xmath27 .",
    "once that is chosen , one can show that the same structure repeats at the second order in the expansion and one can choose solutions such that @xmath28 . by repeating such procedure order by order",
    "we show that the theories always contain solutions with the property @xmath16 , and so the charges evaluated on them present the mirror symmetry described above .",
    "so , the dynamics of the deformed theories favors the `` good '' solutions , in the sense that it is not possible to have solutions satisfying the pure opposite behavior under the parity , i.e. @xmath29 . that is an interesting interplay between the dynamics and the parity that deserves further study .",
    "for instance , the production of `` bad '' modes could be energetically disfavored and emission of radiation could be suppressed .",
    "we also perform numerical simulations , based on the fourth order runge - kutta method , to study the scattering of two soliton like solutions of .",
    "we performed simulations for various rational values of the deformation parameter @xmath11 , and found that in all cases the predictions of the analytical calculations were confirmed , i.e. the real part of charges do satisfy the mirror symmetry when we use as a seed for the simulations solutions of the bullough - dodd model that have the right parity property , i.e. @xmath16 .",
    "so , the evolution of the fields under the deformed equations of motion seem not to destroy the parity property of the initial configuration , again indicating that the dynamics seem to favor the `` good '' modes as observed in the analytical perturbative expansion mentioned above .",
    "the mirror symmetry of the charges were checked in the simulations by evaluating the first non - trivial anomaly @xmath30 ( see ) as well as its integrated version @xmath31 .",
    "all simulations show that the real part of @xmath32 is symmetric under reflection around a given value of time close to @xmath33 , and so leading to the mirror symmetry for the real part of the charge @xmath34 , and then for its asymptotic conservation .",
    "the imaginary part of @xmath32 is not symmetric under reflection and does not lead to the asymptotic conservation of the imaginary part of the charge @xmath34 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ sec : bdmodels ] discusses the properties of the vacuum solutions of the theories and their implications on the possible physically interesting deformations of the bullough - dodd model . in section [ sec : charges ] we present the construction of the quasi - conserved charges using techniques of integrable field theories based on the anomalous zero - curvature or lax - zakharov - shabat equation .",
    "the interplay between the lorentz and parity transformations leading to the mirror symmetry of the charges is dicussed in section [ sec : lorentz ] , and section [ sec : parityversusanomaly ] implements the perturbative method to construct solutions of as power series in the deformation parameter @xmath11 and discusses the connection between dynamics and parity .",
    "the hirota s one - soliton and two - soliton exact solutions of the integrable bullough - dodd model are given in section [ sec : hirota ] .",
    "the numerical simulations are presented in section [ sec : simulations ] , and our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "the appendix [ app : kacmoody ] gives some basic results about the twisted @xmath13 kac - moody algebra @xmath14 used in the text .",
    "we shall consider models of a complex scalar field @xmath9 in @xmath0-dimensions with lagrangian given by and the potentials being given by .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation following from is ^2_t - ^2_x + e^- e^-@xmath10=0 where we have taken the speed of light to be unity .",
    "the real and imaginary parts of the equation are given by ^2_t _",
    "r - ^2_x _ r + e^_r @xmath35 - e^-@xmath10_r @xmath36_i&=&0 + ^2_t _ i - ^2_x",
    "_ i + e^_r @xmath35 + e^-@xmath10_r @xmath36_i&=&0 where we have denoted @xmath37 .",
    "the hamiltonian associated to is conserved and complex , and denoting the hamiltonian density as @xmath38 , we get _ r&= & + v_r + h_i&=&_t_r_t_i + _ x _ r _ x _ i + v_i with @xmath39 , and v_r&= & e^_r @xmath35+e^-@xmath10_r@xmath36_i + v_i&= & e^_r @xmath35 -e^-@xmath10_r@xmath36_i note that the densities are not positive definite , and so we can not really define vacuum configurations as those having minimum energies .",
    "however , in order for the space integrals of the densities to be conserved in time , one needs the momenta to vanish at spatial infinity , and so one needs the fields to be constants there .",
    "therefore , from the equations of motion one gets that such constant configurations are extrema of the potentials , i.e. = & = & e^_r @xmath35 - e^-@xmath10_r @xmath36_i=0 + = -&= & e^_r @xmath35 + e^-@xmath10_r @xmath36_i=0 which implies e^@xmath40_r @xmath35 = @xmath36_i e^@xmath40_r @xmath35 = - @xmath36_i squaring both equations and adding them up one concludes that @xmath41 . using that fact and manipulating , by multiplying and adding them up ,",
    "one concludes that @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "therefore , the extrema of the potentials are @xmath44=@xmath45 note that such extrema are not maxima or minima of the potentials .",
    "they all correspond to saddle points .",
    "we now come to a very interesting property of such models . for static configurations we have that the quantities _",
    "r= -+ v_r ; _ i=-_x _ r _ x _ i + v_i are constant in @xmath46 as a consequence of the static equations of motion , i.e. @xmath47 . indeed , those quantities correspond to the static hamiltonian densities with the space coordinate @xmath46 replaced by an imaginary time @xmath48 .",
    "so , the quantities are conserved in the time @xmath49 for a mechanical problem of a particle moving on a two dimensional space with coordinates @xmath50 and @xmath35 .",
    "therefore , for a given static solution of the model that goes , at spatial infinity , to vacua configurations , one concludes that the potentials @xmath51 and @xmath52 ( and so the complex potential @xmath53 ) are bound to have the same values at both ends of spatial infinity .",
    "if one denotes by @xmath54 and @xmath55 the integers labeling the vacua at @xmath56 and @xmath57 , respectively , then from one gets that e^=1 for the bullough - dodd model where @xmath12 , one gets that @xmath58 has to be a multiple of @xmath59 .",
    "indeed , the static one - soliton solutions of that model do not `` tunnel '' between consecutive vacua as @xmath46 varies from @xmath60 to @xmath61 , like in the sine - gordon model , but jumps @xmath62 vacua and ends in the third one .    for the deformed bullough - dodd models where @xmath63 , the only way of satisfying the condition for any real value of @xmath11 is to have @xmath64 , i.e. for a static solution the vacua are the same at both ends of spatial infinity . if one wants non - trivial one soliton solution with non vanishing topological charge , then the deformation parameter @xmath11 has to be taken to be a rational number .",
    "that is a quite striking and interesting restriction on the ways the bullough - dodd model can be deformed .",
    "if one takes 2+= then the equations of motion takes the form ^2_t - ^2_x + e^q- e^-p=0 where we have redefined the fields as @xmath65 , and the space - time coordinates as @xmath66 , and @xmath67 .",
    "we now use techniques of exactly integrable field theories in @xmath0 dimensions to construct quasi - conserved charges for the non - integrable theories we are considering .",
    "we introduce the connection ( lax potentials ) a_+= @xmath68 b_1 + f_1 ; a_-= b_-1-_- f_0 where we have used light - cone coordinates as @xmath69 , and so @xmath70 .",
    "in addition , the operators @xmath71 and @xmath72 are generators of the twisted loop ( kac - moody ) algebra @xmath14 defined in appendix [ app : kacmoody ] .",
    "even though we will be interested in potentials of the form , in the connection we shall assume that @xmath53 is a generic potential that depends upon the scalar field @xmath9 but not on its complex conjugate @xmath73 .",
    "in addition , we shall assume that the potential does not involve complex parameters in its definition , such that its complex conjugate can be obtained just by the replacement @xmath74 , i.e. v^*=v@xmath75 the reasons for assuming that property will become clear when we discuss below the anomalies in the conservation of the charges .",
    "one can check that the curvature of the connection is given by _",
    "+ a_--_-a_++a_+ , a_-= -@xmath76f_0 - _ -x f_1 with x=+-2v+m the coefficient of @xmath77 in corresponds to the equation of motion of the theory _",
    "+ _ -+=0 and , when it holds true the vanishing of the curvature depends upon the vanishing of the anomalous term @xmath78 . note that by shifting the potential as @xmath79 , one observes that @xmath78 vanishes only when @xmath53 is a linear combination of the exponential terms @xmath80 and @xmath81 .",
    "so , the curvature vanishes for the bullough - dodd potential , corresponding to for @xmath12 , or then for the potential of the liouville model , @xmath82 .",
    "the fact that the liouville model admits a zero curvature representation in terms of the twisted kac - moody algebra @xmath14 is perhaps not know in the literature .    in order to construct the charges we use the so - called abelianization procedure @xcite or drinfeld - sokolov reduction @xcite .",
    "we perform a gauge transformation of the deformed connection as a_a_= g a_g^-1- _",

    "we are now in a position to draw some conclusions about the anomalies of the charges @xmath3 defined in .",
    "consider a solution of the equations of motion which is a traveling wave , i.e. @xmath146 .",
    "one can then make a lorentz transformation and go to the rest frame of such solution where it becomes static , i.e. @xmath46-dependent only .",
    "clearly the charges @xmath3 evaluated on such solution must be time independent , and so its anomaly @xmath4 , defined in , must vanish .",

    "consequently , if @xmath148 vanishes on the rest frame of the solution , it should vanish in all lorentz frames .",

    "the one - solitons we treat in this paper are localized solutions in the sense that the field @xmath9 have non - vanishing space - time derivatives only in a small region of space .",
    "therefore , the integrand in the definition of the anomaly @xmath4 , is non - vanishing only in such a small region of space , i.e. , it gets exponentially suppressed outside such region .",
    "in addition , the one - solitons interact with each other by short range interactions .",
    "so , a two - soliton solution for the case when the two one - solitons are far apart should be just the superposition of the one - soliton solutions . therefore ,",
    "the anomaly @xmath4 evaluated on a two - soliton solution when the one - solitons are far apart should vanish , because it reduces to the sum of the anomalies of the two one - solitons , which by the argument above vanish .",
    "consequently one should expect the anomaly @xmath4 to be non - vanishing only when the solitons are close together and interacting .",
    "that is in fact what we observe in our numerical simulations described in section [ sec : simulations ] .",
    "we do not have yet a good understanding of non - linear dynamics governing the behavior of the charges and anomalies when the solitons interact with each other .",
    "that is a crucial issue to be understood and is at the heart of our working definition of the concept of quasi - integrability .",
    "what is clear so far is that special properties of the solutions under a space - time parity transformation play an important role in all that .",
    "it is not clear however if such properties are the causes or consequences of the quasi - integrability .",
    "let us explain how it works .",
    "let us then consider a ( two - soliton like ) solution of the equations of motion , and a space - time parity transformation p:@xmath149@xmath150 = x - x _ = t - t _ where the values of @xmath151 and @xmath5 depend upon the parameters of that particular solution .",
    "there are two important classes of two - soliton solutions according to the way they behave under the parity transformation .",
    "the first one is that where the two - soliton solution is invariant under the parity , i.e. @xmath152 . from the arguments below we concluded that each term in @xmath119 must contain @xmath145 @xmath139-derivatives of @xmath9 .",
    "from we have that the integer @xmath153 is of the form @xmath154 , with @xmath155 any integer .",
    "therefore , each term in @xmath119 contains an even number of @xmath139-derivatives of @xmath9 , and so it is invariant under the parity .",

    "our initial condition for the kink - kink scattering is not exact , thus radiation was generated .",

    "we have performed a large number of simulations of the scattering of two kinks for various values of the deformation parameter @xmath11 and for the phases @xmath213 , @xmath211 , which appear in the exact soliton solutions ( see and ) .",
    "note that such phases are parameters of the exact soliton solutions but we do not know how the deformed solitons depend upon them for @xmath63 .",
    "however , as explained above , we have constructed the static kink numerically ( with @xmath63 ) from an exact kink ( with @xmath12 ) for a given choice of the phase @xmath213 .",
    "so , we still use the phases @xmath213 to label the deformed kink .",
    "the results for the scattering of two kinks for various choices of the parameters @xmath11 and @xmath213 , @xmath211 , were qualitatively the same , and we show in the figures [ fig:10909 ] , [ fig:10914 ] , [ fig:10920 ] , [ fig:20920 ] and [ fig : m10920 ] , some representative cases . on those figures we show on the top plots , the real and imaginary parts of the anomaly @xmath30 , given in , and on the bottom plots the real and imaginary parts of the integrated anomaly @xmath32 , given in .    note that , in the cases shown in figures [ fig:10909]-[fig : m10920 ] , the real part of the integrated anomaly @xmath32 is symmetric under reflection around a point close to @xmath33 . from one has ^(n)@xmath158-",

    "the case @xmath249 , shown in [ fig : m10920 ] , has an asymmetry however , in the oscillations of the anomaly , which is perhaps due to numerical errors .",
    "therefore , our numerical results confirm the existence of a mirror symmetry given in , and obtained from the analytical calculations based on the parity properties of the solutions . in addition ,",
    "such results imply that real part of the charge is asymptotically conserved , i.e. @xmath250 . the plots of the imaginary part of the integrated anomaly @xmath32 show that the imaginary part of the charge @xmath34 is not asymptotically conserved , and so it is in agreement with our analytical calculations that lead to the asymptotic conservation of the real part of the charge only .",
    "we have considered deformations of the exactly integrable bullough - dodd model defined by the lagrangians and potentials , involving a deformation parameter @xmath11 .",
    "we have shown that such deformed theories possess sectors where the soliton - like solutions present properties very similar to solitons in exactly integrable field theories .",
    "they possess an infinite set of quantities which are exactly conserved in time for one - soliton type solutions , i.e. solutions traveling with a constant speed , and are asymptotically conserved for two - soliton type solutions . by asymptotically conserved we mean quantities which do vary in time during the scattering process of two one - solitons but that return , in the distant future ( after the collision ) , to the values they had in the distant past ( before the collision ) . since what matters in a scattering process are the asymptotic states , such behavior is effectively what we observe in scattering of solitons in integrable field theories , and that is why we call such theories _ quasi - integrable_. the mechanism behind the asymptotic conservation of such an infinity of charges is not well understood yet , but in all examples where it has been observed so far @xcite , the two - soliton type solutions present special properties under a space - time parity transformation . in the case of the deformations considered in this paper , the complex scalar field @xmath9 of the theory , when evaluated on the two - soliton solutions ,",
    "is mapped into its complex conjugate under the parity transformation ( see ) .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the point around which space and time are reversed , under the parity transformation , depend upon the parameters of the solution under consideration .",
    "the infinity of asymptotically conserved charges was constructed using techniques of integrable field theories based on an anomalous zero - curvature ( lax ) equation , where the lax potentials live on the twisted @xmath13 kac - moody algebra @xmath14 .",
    "we have used the properties of the lax potentials under lorentz transformation and internal @xmath14 transformations to prove that two - soliton type solution satisfying the property under the parity transformation , present an infinity of asymptotically conserved charges .",
    "in addition , we have shown that by starting with a two - soliton solution of the integrable bullough - dodd model , satisfying , one can always construct by a power series expansion on the deformation parameter @xmath11 , a solution of the deformed model that also satisfies the parity property and leading to the asymptotic conservation of the charges .",
    "so , the dynamics of the deformed model seems to favor the quasi - integrable sector of the theory .",
    "the numerical simulations have confirmed the predictions of our analytical calculations .",
    "the numerical code was divided in two main parts : the first part uses an exact static one - soliton solution of the integrable bullough - dodd model as a seed to constructed a static one - soliton of the deformed model under a relaxation procedure . the second part of the code takes two of such deformed one - solitons far apart and stitches them at the middle point , and then performs the scattering of them , absorbing the radiation at the edges of the grid .",
    "the anomalies of the charge s non - conservation are evaluated to verify their asymptotic conservation .",
    "it is interesting to note that the initial configurations of the simulations are built from exact solutions of the bullough - dodd model that satisfy the parity property .",
    "the simulations could well drive them into solutions of the deformed model that do not satisfy .",
    "however , in all our simulations the real part of the charges were observed to be asymptotically conserved indicating that they do satisfy the property . that corroborates the conclusion of our analytical perturbative calculation , mentioned above , that the dynamics of the deformed model favors the solutions satisfying .",
    "we do not believe that the parity property is causing the phenomena we call _ quasi - integrability _ , but it seems to be present whenever such non - linear phenomena manifest itself .",
    "we need further investigations to fully understand the mechanisms behind the quasi - integrability .",

    "<S> it has been shown recently that deformations of some integrable field theories in @xmath0-dimensions possess an infinite number of charges that are asymptotically conserved in the scattering of soliton like solutions . </S>",
    "<S> such charges are not conserved in time and they do vary considerably during the scattering process , however they all return in the remote future ( after the scattering ) to the values they had in the remote past ( before the scattering ) . </S>",
    "<S> such non - linear phenomenon was named _ quasi - integrability _ , and it seems to be related to special properties of the solutions under a space - time parity transformation . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we investigate , analytically and numerically , such phenomenon in the context of deformations of the integrable bullough - dodd model . </S>",
    "<S> we find that a special class of two - soliton like solutions of such deformed theories do present an infinite number of asymptotically conserved charges .    </S>",
