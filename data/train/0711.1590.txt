    "gas dynamical processes are believed to play an important role in the evolution of astrophysical systems on all length scales .",
    "a ubiquitous process in astrophysical fluid dynamics is the behavior of gases subjected by shock waves .",
    "these are almost the normal , rather than exceptional , type of astrophysical fluid flows that happen very often in cases of astrophysical interest .",
    "a number of examples are the onset of spiral structures and shock fronts in accretion disks around compact objects ( lanzafame et al .",
    "2006 ) , molecular cloud formation in shock - compressed layers ( koyama and inutsuka  2000 ) , the rapid and strong increase in pressure that can be produced by interaction of the fast wind and the slow envelope of a planetary nebulae ( gurzadyan  1997 ) , and so on .",
    "a powerful gridless particle method that was invented to solve complex fluid - dynamical problems in astrophysics is smoothed particle hydrodynamics  ( sph ) ( lucy  1977 , gingold and monaghan  1977 ) .",
    "the sph method has a number of attractive features such as its low numerical diffusion in comparison to grid based methods . whilst the sph originally developed for compressible flows",
    ", it has been extended to deal with free - surface incompressible fluids ( e.g. , monaghan  1994 , ellero et al .",
    "2007 ) . a recent worthy review of the sph methodology and its applications can be found in monaghan  ( 2005 ) .",
    "an adequate scenario for sph application is the unbound astrophysical problems , especially the behavior of gases subjected to compression ( shock waves ) .",
    "the magnitude of the viscous term dose not affect the net shock - jump conditions , thus , many numerical schemes implicitly or explicitly incorporate the trick of artificial viscosity  ( av ) for halting the ever - growing steepening tendency produced by nonlinear effects .",
    "the first use of viscosity in sph equations was by lucy  ( 1977 ) who introduced an av to present a slow build - up of acoustic energy from integration errors in an sph simulation .",
    "the av is designed to allow shock phenomena to be simulated , or simply to stabilize a numerical algorithm .",
    "indeed two forms of av are applied in sph equations , the bulk and the von neumann - richtmeyer viscosity , respectively .",
    "they prevent inter - particle penetration , allow shocks to form and damp the post - shock oscillations .",
    "although many different functional forms for the av have been proposed ( see , e.g. , liu & liu  2003 ) , all contain problem sensitive parameters that are often set in a somewhat arbitrary manner . here",
    "we try firstly to provide a guide to the relevant prescriptions for some av that have been considered before .",
    "a more effective viscosity which may conserves linear and angular momentum was suggested by monaghan and gingold ( 1983 ) .",
    "they devised a viscosity by simple arguments about its form and its relation to gas viscosity .",
    "the viscous term between two particles , denoted by @xmath0 , is added to the pressure term of sph equations .",
    "when two particles approach each other , the av produces a repulsive force between them .",
    "when they recede from each other the force is attractive ( monaghan  1989 ) .",
    "an undesirable aspect of the monaghan s standard av is that it can introduce considerable shear viscosity into the flow .",
    "this problem may be reduced by a bulk viscosity in a general - purpose code of hernquist and katz ( 1989 ) for evolving three - dimensional , self - gravitating fluids in astrophysics .",
    "clearly the artificial viscous dissipation increases the reynolds number of a flow , artificially , with the result that , for example , the kelvin - helmholtz shear instabilities are heavily diffused . in this way",
    "a von neumann stability analysis of the sph equations along with a critical discussion of various parts of the algorithm was investigated by balsara  ( 1995 ) .",
    "he suggested reducing viscous dissipation by multiplying @xmath0 by a symmetric factor .",
    "another problem of viscosity is that although av is approximately successful for handling shocks but it can be too large in other parts of the flow . for this purpose ,",
    "a switch to reduce the av away from shocks was given by morris and monaghan ( 1997 , hereafter mm97 ) .",
    "they introduce the idea of time - varying switch which fits more naturally with a particle formulation .",
    "each particle has a viscosity parameter which evolves according to a simple source and decay equation .",
    "the source causes the switch to grow when the particle enters a shock and the decay term causes it to decay to a small value beyond the shock .    in the present study",
    "we combine the monaghan s standard av with the time - varying coefficients like that of mm97 s switch .",
    "we propose a modification to the time - dependent av prescription designed by mm97 so that the aim is to maintain the shock - simulating capabilities of sph .",
    "for this purpose we optimize the source term so that the av is restricted to supersonic velocities in regions that are under compression .",
    "section  2 is devoted to the sph method and the suggested changes in the av .",
    "these modifications have been tested in  3 for the one dimensional adiabatic and isothermal shock problems .",
    "finally , a summary with conclusion is given in section  4 .",
    "the sph was invented to simulate nonaxisymmetric phenomena in astrophysics  ( lucy 1977 , gingold & monaghan 1977 ) . in this method ,",
    "fluid is represented by @xmath1 discrete but extended / smoothed particles ( i.e. lagrangian sample points ) .",
    "the particles are overlapping , so that all the involved physical quantities can be treated as continuous functions both in space and time .",
    "overlapping is represented by the kernel function , @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the mean smoothing length of two particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 .",
    "the continuum equations are  ( monaghan 1992 ) @xmath6 @xmath7 @xmath8 where @xmath9 , the av between particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 is presented by @xmath0 , and the other notations have their usual meanings .      in order to simulate the shock problems of hydrodynamics , special treatments or methods are required to allow the algorithms to be capable of modeling shock waves , or else the simulation will develop unphysical oscillations in the numerical results around the shocked regions .",
    "a shock wave is not a true physical discontinuity , but a very narrow transition zone whose thickness is usually in the order of a few molecular mean free paths .",
    "application of the conservation of mass , momentum , and energy conditions across a shock front requires the simulation of transformation of kinetic energy into heat energy .",
    "physically this energy transformation can be represented as a form of viscous dissipation .",
    "this idea leads to the development of the von neumann - richtmyer av that is needed only to be present during material compression , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an adjustable non - dimensional constant .",
    "it is found that adding the following linear av term , @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the sound speed and @xmath14 is another non - dimensional constant ( liu and liu  2003 ) , has the advantage of further smoothing the oscillations that are not totally dampened by the quadratic av term , equation ( [ quadvisc ] ) .",
    "the most widely used av in sph is that of monaghan ( 1989 ) , which not only provides the necessary dissipation to convert kinetic energy into heat at the shock front , but also prevent unphysical penetration for particles approaching each other .",
    "the detailed formulation is as follows : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is an average density , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the artificial coefficients , and @xmath19 is defined as its usual form @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "the signal velocity , @xmath23 , is @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the sound speed of particles .",
    "since the monaghan type av introduces a shear viscosity into the flows especially in regions away from the shock , an av depending on the divergence of the velocity field was employed by hernquist and katz ( 1989 ) , @xmath27 where @xmath28 this av can lead to spurious results if particles @xmath4 and @xmath5 are receding ; i.e. , such terms will contribute viscous artificial cooling . to avoid this problem ,",
    "hernquist and katz ( 1989 ) set @xmath29 if @xmath30 ; a decision which may , in some cases , add small amounts of shear viscosity . in this approach , determining @xmath0 by referring to binary interaction , effectively , gives an idea about the molecular bulk fluid descriptions .",
    "other view on the monaghan s standard av was also proposed by balsara  ( 1995 ) who developed a modification of the av term that approximately sets the dissipation to zero in regions of pure shear , while leaving it unaffected in regions of compression",
    ". this is done by suggestion @xmath31 where a switch in the form of a multiplicative factor ( @xmath32 ) was introduced .",
    "the factor @xmath33 is the average of @xmath34 and @xmath35 , where latexmath:[\\[f_a= \\frac{|\\nabla .",
    "\\mathbf{v}|_a}{|\\nabla . \\mathbf{v}|_a +    @xmath34 acts as a switch , approaching unity in regions of compression ( @xmath37 ) and vanishing in regions of large vorticity ( @xmath38 ) .",
    "consequently , this av has the advantage that it is suppressed in shear layers .",
    "meanwhile , mm97 carried the process further by introducing the idea of time - varying coefficients which fits more naturally with a particle formulation . in this method ,",
    "the av is given by @xmath39 where @xmath40 is a variable switch which should change with time according to the conditions the particle is in , becoming large at shocks , but relaxing back to a small value when the flow is calmer .",
    "each particle @xmath4 has a viscosity switch which evolves according to a simple source , @xmath41 and decay equation , @xmath42 such that in the absence of source term @xmath43 , the switch @xmath44 decays to a value @xmath45 over a time scale @xmath46 .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath47 has a value @xmath48 .",
    "the source causes the switch to grow when the particle enters a shock and the decay term causes it to decay to a small value beyond the shock .      in sph the formation of shocks",
    "is mostly an effect of the von neumann - richtmeyer viscosity . to avoid the undesirable effects in the subsonic region",
    ", we propose to restrict the use of it to those regions .",
    "this modification will allow shocks to form , and prevent inter - particle penetration at supersonic velocities .",
    "when the gas has reached equilibrium , the pressure force prevents further compression .",
    "this process is not possible with source term ( [ source ] ) because of supersonic relative velocities of the particles at different regions of the shock .",
    "the av as outlined by equation ( [ morris ] ) will decelerate and heat the gas , and prevent enough compression . to weaken this problem , we use the following lemma .",
    "since @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the dimension of the problem , the time derivative for any particle can be written as @xmath51 this relation can be used to decide whether a particle follows the fluid or if the source term of av is necessary .",
    "if two particles are approaching each other at velocity exceeding the signal velocity , that is if @xmath52 av is necessary to prevent inter - particle penetration .",
    "we therefore propose to restrict the source term of av with defined frequency as @xmath53 a good way to do this for a particle is to use the restricted source term @xmath43 , instead of equation ( [ source ] ) , as follows @xmath54    base on a method similar mm97 , we use @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the standard av , equation ( [ monag ] ) , in form of variables with respect to time , @xmath57 and @xmath58 respectively , where the parameters @xmath59 and @xmath60 are chosen to regulate the effect of source term such that the _ heat production _ and _ post - shock oscillations _ are controlled in the numerical simulations .",
    "as outlined before , an extremely important problem is the behavior of gases subjected to compression waves .",
    "this happens very often in the cases of astrophysical interests .",
    "for example , a small region of gas suddenly heated by the liberation of energy will expand into its surroundings .",
    "the surroundings will be pushed and compressed , thus , a shock front is formed .",
    "conservation of mass , momentum , and energy across a shock front is given by the rankine - hugoniot conditions ( dyson and williams 1997 ) @xmath61 @xmath62 @xmath63 where the equation of state , @xmath64 , is used .",
    "in adiabatic case , we have @xmath65 , and for isothermal shocks , we will set @xmath66 .",
    "we would interested to consider the collision of two gas sheets with velocities @xmath67 in the rest frame of the laboratory . in this reference frame",
    ", the post - shock will be at rest and the pre - shock velocity is given by @xmath68 , where @xmath69 is the shock front velocity .",
    "combining equations ( [ e : rh1])-([e : rh3 ] ) , we have @xmath70\\ ] ] where @xmath71 is the sound speed , @xmath72 is the mach number , @xmath5 and @xmath73 are defined as @xmath74 respectively . substituting ( [ e : v2 ] ) into equation ( [ e : rh1 ] ) , density of the post - shock is given by @xmath75}\\}.\\ ] ]      considering the head - on collision of two gas sheets , the particles with a positive @xmath76-coordinate are given an initial negative velocity of mach  5 , and those with a negative @xmath76-coordinate are given a mach  5 velocity in the opposite direction .",
    "the chosen physical scales for length and time are @xmath77=3.0 \\times 10^{16 } \\mathrm{m}$ ] and @xmath78=3.0 \\times 10^{13 } \\mathrm{s}$ ] , respectively , so the velocity unit is approximately @xmath79 .",
    "the gravity constant is set @xmath80 for which the calculated mass unit is @xmath81=4.5 \\times 10^{32 } \\mathrm{kg}$ ] .",
    "there is considered two equal one dimensional molecular sheets with extension @xmath82 $ ] , which have initial uniform density and temperature of @xmath83 and @xmath84 , respectively .    in adiabatic shock , with @xmath85 ,",
    "the post - shock density must be @xmath86 , which is obtained from analytic solution ( [ e : den ] ) with @xmath65 and @xmath87 .",
    "on the other hand , in isothermal shock with @xmath85 , the post - shock density must be @xmath88 ( i.e. , from eq .",
    "[ e : den ] with @xmath66 ) .",
    "the simulation results of adiabatic and isothermal shocks which use the mm97 s av , equation ( [ morris ] ) , are shown in fig .  1",
    ". the post - shock density has oscillations for both cases of the adiabatic and isothermal shocks .",
    "since the thermal energy in adiabatic shock is restrained in the system , the oscillations grow further in it as shown in fig .  1 .",
    "adding the linear av term ( [ linvisc ] ) can smooth the oscillations , thus , we use the parameter @xmath59 in the @xmath55 viscosity equation ( [ alpha ] ) .",
    "the best values of the @xmath59 for adiabatic and isothermal shocks are @xmath89 and @xmath90 , respectively .",
    "the value of @xmath59 in adiabatic case is small for the reason that the oscillations are greater than isothermal case .    as shown in fig .  1",
    ", the post - shock density of adiabatic case is approximately equal to the analytical value , while the difference in isothermal case is more distinguishable .",
    "this is because of extremely increasing of the pressure in the compression region that is greatly produced by the @xmath56-viscous term of av in equation ( [ monag ] ) . to remove this problem",
    "we propose using of the parameter @xmath60 in the @xmath56 viscosity equation ( [ beta ] ) . choosing the values @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath60 in adiabatic and isothermal case , respectively ,",
    "can regulate the post - shock density as shown in fig .  2 .",
    "these relative values are because the pressure produced in the post - shock region of isothermal case is artificially greater than the same pressure at adiabatic case .",
    "in sph method two forms of av is necessary ; the von neumann - richtmeyer viscosity and linear viscous term . in this work we revisited the relevant prescriptions for some av , which was proposed to consider these two forms of viscosity in sph methodology . as a good idea",
    ", mm97 introduced the time - varying switch which fits more naturally with the particle formulation .",
    "the shock formations in adiabatic and isothermal cases have been performed to test the effect of different avs .",
    "the simulation results in which the mm97 s av was used , show that the post - shock density has oscillations for both cases of the adiabatic and isothermal shocks .",
    "the oscillations in adiabatic shock grow further because the thermal energy in this case is restrained in the system . on the other hand ,",
    "the post - shock density of adiabatic case is approximately equal to the analytical value , while the difference in isothermal case is more distinguishable .    to partly overcome some of these problems , we proposed a modification of the av . based on the method of mm97 , we used time - variable @xmath55 and @xmath56 in the standard av . in this approach",
    ", the av is used only in supersonic regions where the gas is not under compression , thus , the source term is restricted .",
    "using this source multiplied by two regulating parameters ( @xmath59 and @xmath60 ) can virtually eliminate some problematic effects of using an artificial dissipation in sph capability of shock simulation .",
    "computer experiments have been performed to test the abilities of the proposal , and the results show that the accuracy of these restrictions on av is acceptable .",
    "although there are some satisfying results from shock formation tests , the proposed av should be communicated to the astrophysical community , so that others can try it",
    ". there must be other tests to complete the idea .",
