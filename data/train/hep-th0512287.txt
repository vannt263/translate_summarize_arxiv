    "most string theory compactifications come with a large number of moduli . corresponding to massless fields in the low energy effective action ,",

    "a lot of effort is being dedicated to the subject of moduli stabilization .",
    "compactifications which should ultimately yield the mssm are required to have @xmath4 supersymmetry in four dimensions .",
    "one way to achieve this is to start with type ii string theory compactified on a compact calabi ",

    "their presence induces an rr flux which has to be cancelled by adding appropriate orientifold planes . without d  branes and orientifold planes ,",
    "the relevant moduli are the dilaton , and the deformations of the complex structure and the khler form of @xmath5 while the moduli of the rr fields decouple . after adding the orientifold planes , the geometric and the rr moduli get mixed non  trivially .    in the kklt - proposal @xcite ,",

    "d3branes , which give rise to a positive contribution to the potential , producing the uplift to a small value of the cosmological constant .",
    "we will be concerned with the first step only , i.e. we study the issue of the stabilization of all moduli .",
    "we will present a program for testing this proposal in a number of examples and point out issues which deserve to be understood more deeply in order to fully realize it .",
    "this is a continuation of  @xcite and a preview of some of the results of  @xcite .",
    "the stabilization of the complex structure moduli and the dilaton via three - form fluxes has been extensively discussed in the literature @xcite ( for a review , see @xcite and references therein ) , while the general conditions for the generation of a non  perturbative superpotential depending on the khler moduli have recently received a lot of attention , see  @xcite . on the other hand , some concrete realizations of step one of kklt ,",
    "i.e. models with all moduli fixed have been put forward  @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the closed string moduli space consists of @xmath7 khler moduli , which parametrize the size of @xmath5 , @xmath8 complex structure moduli , parametrizing the shape of @xmath5 , plus the complex dilaton @xmath9 , which consists of the rr 0form @xmath10 and the dilaton @xmath11 .",

    "yau @xmath18form .",
    "this superpotential depends on the dilaton through the flux , and on the complex structure moduli through @xmath17 , but since there is no dependence on the khler moduli , one must look for other means to stabilize them . here , non  perturbative effects yield such a means",
    ". there are two possible origins of such a non  perturbative superpotential : euclidean d3brane instantons wrapping 4cycles @xmath19 and gaugino condensation in the world - volume of d7branes wrapping again 4cycles @xmath20 .",
    "both give rise to terms in the superpotential of the form @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the volume of the divisor @xmath23 wrapped by the brane and therefore depends on the khler moduli .",
    "the prefactor @xmath24 comes from a one  loop determinant and in general depends on the complex structure moduli .",
    "unfortunately , it is very hard to calculate explicitly , however recently a nice method has been presented in  @xcite .",
    "otherwise , the best one can do in general is deciding whether it is zero or not . in the absence of fluxes",
    "witten gave a criterion for this in the framework of f ",
    "theory  @xcite : the calabi  yau threefold @xmath5 is lifted to a calabi  yau fourfold @xmath25 and the divisor @xmath19 is lifted to divisor @xmath26 .",
    "then the condition is that the holomorphic euler characteristic of @xmath27 has to equal one : @xmath28 under favorable circumstances , this condition can be reduced to a condition on the holomorphic euler characteristic of the divisor @xmath29 .",
    "the hodge numbers @xmath30 and @xmath31 are also relevant to decide whether there are contributions from d7-branes  @xcite .",
    "we want to know whether the kklt scenario can actually be realized , and in a first step , one is trying to understand the problem of moduli stabilization .",
    "one way to gain a better understanding is to construct specific examples which fit all requirements .",
    "while the complex structure moduli and the dilaton can be generically fixed by fluxes , the first impression was that divisors which generate contributions to the non - perturbative superpotential are not generic  @xcite , @xcite .    in the search for models with all moduli fixed by the effects described above , we follow the example of  @xcite and consider orientifolds of resolved toroidal orbifolds .",
    "the motivation to look at this specific class of models is that toroidal orbifolds have a simple structure which allows for many quantities to be computed explicitly .",
    "furthermore , they are also phenomenologically attractive because of their standard model - like features such as non  abelian gauge groups , chiral fermions and family repetition .",
    "orbifolds come with a number of untwisted khler moduli , which are inherited directly from the underlying torus , plus a number of twisted khler moduli which parametrize the sizes of the exceptional divisors which result from the resolution of the orbifold singularities .",
    "if one takes the aim of fixing all moduli seriously , one has to take care of the twisted khler moduli as well .",
    "most likely , they will not be stabilized at zero size , so one has to look at the smooth calabi ",
    "yau manifold resulting from all orbifold singularities being resolved .",
    "the resolution process is most conveniently described in the language of toric geometry .",
    "divisors originating from blow ",
    "ups are particularly promising candidates for yielding a non  perturbative superpotential since they are in general rigid , i.e. have no moduli .",
    "ultimately , we would like to check all toroidal orbifolds which allow tadpole cancellation in type iib for their suitability for the kklt proposal .",
    "the example of @xmath32 which was studied in great detail in  @xcite turned out to allow stabilization of all moduli . in the class of toroidal orbifolds",
    ", this model holds a special place because of its simplicity ( the orbifold group contains only three non  trivial elements , which give rise to only one sort of local patch ) and symmetry ( the configuration of fixed sets as well as of the o  planes is the same for every coordinate direction ) and its f  theory lift is known .",
    "this is radically different for most other toroidal orbifolds as we will explain in the following sections .",
    "for this reason we would like to ascertain how common the stabilization of all moduli in the class of toroidal orbifolds is .",
    "furthermore , we believe that the construction of blowing up the various different patches and gluing them together to form a smooth calabi  yau manifold is worthwhile to be understood in its own right .    in the following , we will sketch the recipe of  @xcite and go on to give some of the steps explicitly for our example .",
    "* we begin with some toroidal orbifold .",
    "the regions close to the orbifold singularities can be described with toric geometry . in these local patches",
    ", we can resolve the singularities via a blow  up .",
    "* in the next step , those local patches have to be glued together to form a smooth , compact calabi  yau threefold @xmath5 . *",
    "the topologies of the divisors of @xmath5 have to be analyzed .",
    "this will be important in order to decide which of them can generate a non  perturbative contribution to the superpotential . *",
    "a consistent orientifold projection has to be found and performed .",
    "this yields the o  planes and changes the geometry .",
    "the tadpoles can be cancelled by adding d  branes . *",
    "the khler potential has to be determined .",
    "for the khler part , we have to compute the intersection ring of @xmath5 .",
    "this yields a non  trivial consistency check on the the previous steps . *",
    "the 3form flux is turned on to fix the complex structure moduli and the dilaton .",
    "the effect of the background flux on the fermionic zero modes on the d  branes and therefore the generation of the non  perturbative terms in the superpotential has to be taken into account .",
    "* in the last step , the scalar potential obtained from the superpotential and the khler potential has to be minimized .",
    "probably the simplest way to construct a calabi ",
    "yau compactification is to take a toroidal orbifold and resolve its singularities .",
    "such orbifolds have been analyzed in detail some time ago .",
    "this analysis resulted in a partial classification  @xcite , @xcite which is our starting point .",

    "the configuration of the fixed sets is different in the different coordinate directions and there are several different types of singularities .",

    "furthermore , it is not yet known how the f  theory lift can be explicitly constructed . from the fixed point configurations one finds the hodge numbers to be @xmath46 and @xmath47 . from these",

    "if no f  theory lift is known , witten s criterion  ( [ eq : chi ] ) can not be applied . a possible way out",

    "a systematic way to resolve abelian orbifold singularities is toric geometry  @xcite . in the following paragraphs",
    ", we summarize some of the basic facts about toric geometry .",
    "an @xmath48dimensional toric variety takes the form @xmath49 where @xmath50 , and @xmath51 acts by coordinatewise multiplication .",
    "the set @xmath52 is a subset that remains fixed under a continuous subgroup of @xmath51 and must be subtracted for the variety to be well defined .",
    "the action of @xmath51 is encoded in a lattice @xmath53 which is isomorphic to @xmath54 and by its fan @xmath55 , a collection of strongly convex rational cones in @xmath56 with the property that each face of a cone in @xmath55 is also a cone in @xmath55 and the intersection of two cones in @xmath55 is a face of each .",
    "the @xmath57dimensional cones in @xmath55 are in one  to ",
    "one correspondence with the codimension @xmath57submanifolds of @xmath58 .",
    "in particular , the one  dimensional cones correspond to the divisors in @xmath58 .",
    "the fan @xmath55 can be encoded by the generators of its edges or one  dimensional cones , i.e. by vectors @xmath59 . to each @xmath60",
    "we associate a homogeneous coordinate @xmath61 of @xmath58 .",
    "the @xmath51 action is encoded on the @xmath60 in @xmath62 linear relations @xmath63 we are only interested in calabi ",
    "yau orbifolds @xmath64 of dimensions @xmath65 , so we require @xmath58 to have trivial canonical class .",
    "this translates to demanding that all but one of the @xmath60 lie in the same affine hyperplane one unit away from the origin @xmath66 .",
    "this means that the last component of all the @xmath60 ( except @xmath66 ) equals one .",
    "this allows us to draw toric diagrams in two ( one ) dimensions instead of @xmath67 ( @xmath68 ) .",
    "the fan @xmath55 associated to the former is obtained as follows : we have a single three ",
    "dimensional cone in @xmath55 , generated by @xmath69 .",
    "a generator @xmath70 of @xmath34 of order @xmath48 acts on the coordinates of @xmath71 by @xmath72 then the local coordinates of @xmath58 are @xmath73 . to find the coordinates in @xmath53 of the generators @xmath60 of the fan , we require the @xmath74 to be invariant under the action of @xmath70 .",
    "this results in finding two linearly independent solutions of the equation @xmath75 the divisors corresponding to @xmath60 will be denoted by @xmath23 .",
    "@xmath58 is smooth if all the top  dimensional cones in @xmath55 have volume one .",
    "here , there is only one such cone whose volume is @xmath76 , hence @xmath58 is singular .",
    "there is a standard procedure for resolving singularities of toric varieties .",
    "it consists of adding all lattice points in @xmath53 which lie in the polyhedron in the affine hyperplane at distance one which is spanned by the generators @xmath60 . for the fan",
    "@xmath55 this means that the corresponding one  dimensional generators @xmath77 are added to it and that it has to be subdivided accordingly .",
    "we denote the refined fan by @xmath78 . in  @xcite it",
    "is shown that these new generators can be related ( in the case @xmath67 ) to the generators of @xmath34 as follows : @xmath79 where @xmath80 represents the corresponding generator @xmath81 .",
    "the corresponding exceptional divisors are denoted @xmath82 .",
    "the subdivision of the fan @xmath55 into @xmath78 corresponds to a triangulation of the toric diagram .",
    "in general , there are several triangulations , and therefore several possible resolutions .",
    "they are all related via birational transformations .",
    "the case @xmath68 is even simpler .",
    "the singularity @xmath83 is called a rational double point of type @xmath84 and its resolution is called a hirzebruch  jung sphere tree consisting of @xmath85 exceptional divisors intersecting themselves according to the dynkin diagram of @xmath84 .    in our example , we see from table  [ fig : fix ] that we have lines of @xmath86 and @xmath87 singularities , as well as singular points of the form @xmath88 . for the latter",
    "we take the action in  ( [ eq : action ] ) .",
    "then  ( [ eq : vi ] ) leads to the following three generators of the fan @xmath55 : @xmath89 the points inside the triangle @xmath90 lead to four additional generators of @xmath78 : @xmath91 by  ( [ eq : crit ] ) they correspond to the generators @xmath92 , @xmath93 , of @xmath45 . in this example",
    ", there are five triangulations .    ]",
    "figure  [ fig : diagram ] shows three of the corresponding toric diagrams .",
    "the remaining two not shown here are obtained by ( i ) taking the second case and blowing the curve @xmath94 down and then blowing the curve @xmath95 up ( such a process is called a flop ) and ( ii ) taking the third case and flopping the curve @xmath96 to @xmath97 .",
    "having analyzed the local structure of the singularities and their resolution we can return to the resolved global orbifold .",
    "the general procedure consists of gluing all the resolved local patches @xmath98 .",
    "this is achieved by relating their non  compact divisors @xmath23 to the divisors @xmath99 , which are inherited from the covering torus @xmath100 , via the linear relations of the toric varieties @xmath98 .",
    "the inherited divisors and the exceptional divisors together form a basis for the divisor classes of the resolved orbifold . in addition , there are further natural divisors which will be expressed in terms of linear combinations of these basis elements .",
    "these additional divisors are simply planes lying at fixed loci of the orbifold action : @xmath101 where @xmath102 runs over the fixed loci in the @xmath103th direction . in terms of the local toric patches they correspond to the non - compact divisors @xmath23 .",
    "the local linear relations become `` sliding '' divisors in the compact geometry , and are related to the inherited divisors as follows .",
    "consider the divisors @xmath104 .",
    "they `` slide '' in the sense that they can move away from the fixed point , and the way they can move is constrained by the linear relations in the local geometry .",
    "we need , however , to pay attention whether we use the local coordinates @xmath105 near the fixed point on the orbifold or the local coordinates @xmath106 on the cover .",
    "locally , the map is @xmath107 , where @xmath48 is the order of the group element that fixes the point .",
    "the divisor @xmath108 on the orbifold lifts to a union of @xmath48 divisors @xmath109 with @xmath110 .",
    "consider the local toric patch before blowing up .",
    "the fixed point lies at @xmath111 and in the limit as @xmath112 approaches this point we find the relation between @xmath99 and @xmath23 to be @xmath113 .",
    "this expresses the fact that at the fixed point the polynomial defining @xmath99 on the cover has an @xmath48th order zero on @xmath23 . in the local toric patch @xmath114 , hence @xmath115 . after blowing up ,",
    "the @xmath99 and @xmath116 differ by the exceptional divisors @xmath117 introduced in the process of resolution .",
    "the difference is expressed precisely by the linear relation  ( [ eq : linrels ] ) corresponding to the resolved toric variety @xmath118 and takes the form @xmath119 . from this",
    "we see that this relation is independent from the chosen resolution .",
    "such a relation holds for every fixed point @xmath120 which adds the label @xmath102 to the relation : @xmath121 the precise form of the sum over the exceptional divisors depends on the singularities involved .    for our example",
    ", we obtain the following : from figure  [ fig : fix ] we see that we have 12 local @xmath122 patches which each sit at the intersection of a @xmath86 and a @xmath87 fixed line .",
    "they each have one exceptional divisor in the interior and three on the boundary of the toric diagram . from the discussion in section",
    "[ sec : local ] we see that the 6 @xmath87 fixed lines each contribute two exceptional divisors . at the @xmath122 fixed point sitting on this line , they are identified with the two divisors sitting on the boundary @xmath123 . then , there are 8 lines fixed under the @xmath124element , contributing each one exceptional divisor . in the @xmath122 fixed point sitting on top of such a fixed line ,",
    "the divisor is identified with the one on the boundary @xmath125 of the toric diagram of the resolution , as before .",
    "we have illustrated this in figure  [ fig : glue ] .",
    "the vertices corresponding to the exceptional divisors are colored to match figure [ fig : fix ] .",
    "this gives a total of @xmath126 exceptional divisors .",
    "in addition , we have three inherited divisors @xmath127 which yields @xmath128 .",
    "fixed point in @xmath129 .",
    "we emphasize that the points in the interior of the boundary are identified with the dynkin diagrams of @xmath130 and @xmath131 obtained from resolving the @xmath86 and @xmath87 fixed lines which intersect in this @xmath122 fixed point.,width=188 ]    again , from figure  [ fig : fix ] we see that the divisors located at fixed sets are three planes @xmath132 at the @xmath133 fixed lines and four planes @xmath134 at the @xmath124 fixed lines . in the @xmath135 direction some of the fixed lines get identified by @xmath70 , so that there remain three equivalence classes @xmath136 . as representatives we choose @xmath137 for @xmath138 , @xmath139 for @xmath140 , and @xmath141 for @xmath142 .",

    "this can be done straightforwardly for all the cases .",
    "the topology of the exceptional divisors can be discussed in the local toric variety @xmath118 . for that purpose",
    "we recall the notion of the star of a cone @xmath148 , denoted @xmath149 , which is the set of all cones @xmath150 in the fan @xmath78 containing @xmath148 . in our situation , the topology of an exceptional divisor @xmath82",
    "is then determined in terms of @xmath151 .",
    "this means that we simply remove from the fan @xmath78 all cones , i.e. points and lines in the toric diagram , which do not contain @xmath77 .",
    "it can be shown that the compact exceptional divisors ( i.e. those in the interior of the toric diagram ) can either be a @xmath152 , a hirzebruch surface @xmath153 , a toric blow ",
    "up thereof , or a flop of any of these possibilities . for the exceptional divisors on the boundary of the diagram the geometry",
    "is effectively reduced by one dimension .",
    "the only compact toric manifold in one dimension is @xmath154 , the extra non  compact direction is @xmath155 , and there is again the additional possibility of toric blow",
    " ups and flops .    after the gluing process described in section  [ sec : global ] the non  compact factor is identified with a fixed line @xmath156 .",
    "after the resolution , the topology becomes a @xmath154 blown up at some points .",
    "hence , the topology of these divisors is a ( possibly non  trivial ) product of two blown  up @xmath154s .",
    "the same argument also applies to the locally non  compact divisors @xmath23 . in the global orbifold",
    "they take the form @xmath157 . with the singularities removed ,",
    "this is the same as a ( possibly non  trivial ) product of two @xmath154s with a certain number of points removed in each factor .",
    "blowing up the singularities glues in either points or further @xmath154s depending on the number of exceptional curves ending in @xmath23 in the toric diagram .",
    "the upshot is that all the divisors @xmath23 and @xmath117 are rational surfaces which have in particular @xmath158 .",
    "the inherited divisors @xmath99 naturally come with the position modulus @xmath112 , i.e. have @xmath159 .    in our example",
    ", the only compact exceptional divisor is @xmath160 . in the triangulation",
    "b ) , we recognize its star to be that of an @xmath161 . in the other triangulations ,",
    "@xmath160 is birationally equivalent to @xmath161 , since the triangulations are all connected to each other through flops . as for the locally non  compact exceptional divisors , in triangulation",
    "a ) they all have the topology of @xmath162 , while in the other triangulations , we have first to perform blow  ups and flops to reduce them to this simple form .      in order to obtain a consistent theory , an orientifold projection has to be performed .",
    "the easiest way would be to start with the corresponding orientifold at the orbifold point and then blowing up .",
    "however , in this process non  perturbative states from d  branes wrapping vanishing cycles may appear , making perturbation theory singular and thus preventing the orbifold phase and the smooth phase from being continuously connected  @xcite ( for explicit examples in a slightly different context , see  @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , we have to resolve the singularities first and impose the orientifold projection directly on the smooth geometry .",
    "since we are interested in the situation with o3 and o7planes , we choose the geometric part of the orientifold action @xmath163 on the torus @xmath100 to be @xmath164 .",
    "we therefore have to study the fixed sets under the combination of @xmath165 and the elements of the orbifold group @xmath34 .",
    "the condition  ( [ eq : fix ] ) is replaced by @xmath166    in contrast to the simple example in  @xcite , these fixed point sets in general do not coincide with the fixed point set of the orbifold group .",
    "in particular , there are orbifold fixed points which are mapped into each other by the orientifold action .",
    "consequently , the orientifold action is locally trivial",
    ". furthermore , in the split of @xmath167 into an invariant and an anti  invariant part , we now have @xmath168 .",
    "the corresponding moduli @xmath169 are not khler moduli anymore but have the form  @xcite @xmath170 currently , there is no superpotential known which could fix these moduli  .",
    "in addition , we have to decide whether and how we impose an orientifold action on the local coordinates @xmath171 of the exceptional divisors @xmath117 .",
    "presently , no criteria are known how to do this except for consistency at the very end of the computations .",
    "this leaves a lot of freedom .",
    "it turns out that indeed a non  trivial action on the @xmath171 is needed . in order to emphasize the importance of this point",
    ", we mention two places where this choice becomes important . when a divisor is fixed by the orientifold action , a factor of 1/2 appears in front this divisor in  ( [ eq : ri ] ) resp .",
    "( [ eq : relations ] ) .",
    "moreover , although the divisors of all models in question have similar properties , namely @xmath172 , it depends strongly on the choice of orientifold involution whether such a divisor will contribute to the non  perturbative superpotential or not .",
    "of the seven steps outlined in the beginning of section [ sec : moduli ] , we have addressed only the first four in this article . the remaining three , such as the calculation of the khler potential , turning on 3form flux and the minimization of the scalar potential will be addressed in  @xcite , also for the other examples discussed in  @xcite .",
    "we can make a preliminary comment on the second but last step of turning on the 3form fluxes .",
    "since most of the divisors in our model have vanishing @xmath173 and @xmath174 , the background flux will have no effect on the zero modes .",
    "the reason is that the flux can lift zero modes . since @xmath172",
    ", it can only have an effect on @xmath175 , which is 1 for connected surfaces .",
