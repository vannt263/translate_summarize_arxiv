    "@xcite . ) in particular , various new structures have been uncovered in the amplitudes of these theories ( see , for example , ref .",
    "one such structure is the duality between color and kinematics found by carrasco , johansson , and one of the authors  @xcite .",
    "this bern - carrasco - johansson ( bcj ) duality is conjectured to hold at all loop orders in yang - mills theory and its supersymmetric counterparts . besides imposing strong constraints on gauge - theory amplitudes , whenever a form of a gauge - theory loop integrand is obtained where the duality is manifest , we obtain corresponding gravity integrands simply by replacing color factors by specified gauge - theory kinematic numerator factors .",
    "the duality between color and kinematics has been confirmed in numerous tree - level studies  @xcite , including the construction of explicit representations for an arbitrary number of external legs  @xcite . at loop level ,",
    "the duality remains a conjecture , but there is already significant nontrivial evidence in its favor for supersymmetric theories  @xcite and for special helicity configurations in nonsupersymmetric pure yang - mills theory  @xcite . here",
    "we provide further evidence in favor of the duality at loop level , explicitly showing that it holds for pure yang - mills one - loop four - point amplitudes for all polarization states in @xmath0 dimensions .",
    "we also present a duality - satisfying representation of the two - loop four - point identical - helicity amplitude of pure yang - mills .",
    "this amplitude in a non - duality - satisfying representation was first given in ref .",
    "@xcite , while ref .",
    "@xcite noted the existence of a duality - satisfying form .",
    "here we explicitly give the full duality - satisfying form , including contributions from diagrams absent from ref .",
    "@xcite that vanish under integration but are necessary to make the duality manifest .    in order to construct the one - loop four - point pure yang - mills amplitude , we use a @xmath0-dimensional variant  @xcite of the unitarity method  @xcite .",
    "our construction begins by finding an ansatz for the amplitude constrained to satisfy the duality .",
    "since the amplitude is fully determined from its @xmath0-dimensional unitarity cuts , we obtain a form of the amplitude with the duality manifest by enforcing that the ansatz has the correct unitarity cuts .",
    "the existence of such a form where both the duality and the cuts are simultaneously satisfied is rather nontrivial .",
    "we do not use helicity states tied to specific dimensions but instead use formal polarization vectors because we wish to have an expression for the amplitude valid in any dimension and for all states .",
    "the price for this generality is that the expressions are lengthier .",
    "since the constructed integrand has manifest bcj duality , the double - copy construction immediately gives the corresponding gravity amplitude in a theory with a graviton , dilaton , and antisymmetric tensor .",
    "we use these results to study the ultraviolet divergences of the corresponding gravity amplitudes .",
    "recent years have seen a renaissance in the study of ultraviolet divergences in gravity theories , in a large measure due to the greatly improved ability to carry out explicit multiloop computations in gravity theories  @xcite .",
    "the unitarity method also has revealed hints that multiloop supergravity theories may be better behaved in the ultraviolet than power - counting arguments based on standard symmetries suggest  @xcite .",
    "even pure einstein gravity at one loop exhibits surprising cancellations as the number of external legs increases  @xcite .",
    "the question of whether it is possible to construct a finite supergravity is still an open one , though there has been enormous progress on this question in recent years , including new computations and a much better understanding of the consequences of supersymmetry and duality symmetry ( see e.g. refs .",

    "@xcite , two- and three - loop examples are known where the divergence vanishes , yet the understanding of the possible symmetry behind this vanishing is incomplete  @xcite . the duality between color and kinematics and its associated double - copy formula offer a new angle on the ultraviolet divergences in supergravity theories  @xcite . here",
    "we explore the ultraviolet properties of nonsupersymmetric gravity from the double - copy perspective .",
    "we use the gravity integrands constructed via the double - copy property to determine the exact form of the ultraviolet divergences .",
    "we do so at one loop in dimensions @xmath1 .",
    "the ultraviolet properties of one - loop four - point gravity amplitudes have already been studied in some detail over the years , including cases with scalars or antisymmetric tensors coupling to gravity  @xcite , so no surprises should be expected , at least at four points . nevertheless , it is useful to look in some detail at the ultraviolet properties to understand them from the double - copy perspective .",
    "here we examine the four - point amplitudes in a theory of gravity coupled to a dilaton and an antisymmetric tensor , corresponding to the double copy of pure yang - mills theory .",
    "while related calculations have been carried out , we are unaware of any calculations of the ultraviolet properties in the theory corresponding to the double - copy theory .",
    "we find that in @xmath2 , there are no one - loop divergences in amplitudes involving external gravitons , though there are divergences in the remaining amplitudes involving only external dilatons or antisymmetric tensors , as expected from simple counterterm arguments  @xcite . by two loops ,",
    "even the four - graviton amplitudes contain divergences , as we demonstrate by computing the form and numerical coefficient of the divergence .",
    "in the two - loop case , the divergence is proportional to a unique @xmath3 operator which gives a divergence in the identical - helicity four - point amplitude .",
    "this means that the identical - helicity four - point amplitude is sufficient for determining the coefficient of the @xmath3 divergence . in @xmath4 and @xmath5 , we find one - loop divergences in the four - external - graviton amplitudes .",
    "these results are not surprising and are in line with the earlier studies .",
    "our conclusion is that , by itself , the double - copy structure is insufficient to render a gravity theory finite in @xmath2 and requires additional ultraviolet cancellations , such as those from supersymmetry .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section  [ sec : bcjreview ] , we briefly review the duality between color and kinematics and the double - copy construction of gravity . in section  [ sec : construction ] , we present the construction of the duality - satisfying pure yang - mills numerators at one and two loops . then in section  [ sec : loopuv ] , we study the ultraviolet properties of gravity coupled to a dilaton and an antisymmetric tensor at one loop in four , six , and eight dimensions . in the same section , we also present the ultraviolet properties at two loops in four dimensions .",
    "finally , in section  [ sec : conclusion ] we give our conclusions .",

    "appendix  [ sec : dimregappendix ] focuses on extracting the divergences in dimensional regularization .",
    "this procedure mixes infrared and ultraviolet divergences ; so , in appendix  [ sec : irappendix ] we give the infrared divergences that must be subtracted to obtain the ultraviolet ones .",
    "appendix  [ sec : uvintegralsappendix ] evaluates the integrals using an alternative method for obtaining the ultraviolet divergences more directly , by introducing a mass to separate out the infrared divergences from the ultraviolet ones .",

    "the first sum runs over the @xmath10 permutations of the external legs , denoted by @xmath11 .",
    "the @xmath12 symmetry factor removes any overcounting from these permutations and also from any internal automorphism symmetries of graph @xmath13 .",
    "the @xmath13-sum is over the set of distinct , nonisomorphic , @xmath6-point @xmath7-loop graphs with only _ cubic _",
    "( i.e. , trivalent ) vertices .",
    "these graphs are sufficient because any diagram with quartic or higher vertices can be converted to a diagram with only cubic vertices by multiplying and dividing by the appropriate propagators .",
    "the propagators appearing in the graph are @xmath14 .",
    "the nontrivial kinematic information is contained in the numerators @xmath15 and depends on momenta , polarizations , and spinors . in supersymmetric cases",
    "it will depend also on grassmann parameters , if a superspace form is used .",
    "the loop integral is over @xmath7 independent @xmath0-dimensional loop momenta , @xmath16 .",

    "utilizing this freedom , the bcj conjecture is that to all loop orders , representations of the amplitude exist where kinematic numerators obey the same algebraic relations that the color factors obey  @xcite . in ordinary gauge theories , this is simply the jacobi identity , @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath13 , and @xmath22 label three diagrams whose color factors obey the jacobi identity .",
    "the basic jacobi identity is displayed in .",
    "the identity generalizes to any loop order with any number of external legs by embedding it in larger diagrams , where the other parts of the diagrams are identical for the three diagrams . furthermore , if the color factor of a diagram is antisymmetric under a swap of legs , we require that the numerator obey the same antisymmetry , @xmath23 the duality was noticed long ago for tree - level four - point feynman diagrams  @xcite ; beyond this , it is rather nontrivial and no longer holds for ordinary feynman diagrams .",
    "we note that the numerator relations are nontrivial functional relations because they depend on momenta , polarizations , and spinors , as discussed in some detail in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "while a complete understanding of the duality and its consequences is still lacking , a variety of studies have elucidated it , especially at tree level . in particular , this duality leads to nontrivial relations between gauge - theory color - ordered partial tree amplitudes  @xcite .",
    "the duality ( [ bcjflipsymmetry ] ) has also been studied in string theory  @xcite . in the self - dual case ,",
    "light - cone gauge feynman rules have been shown to exhibit the duality  @xcite .",
    "explicit forms of @xmath24-point tree amplitudes satisfying the duality have been found  @xcite . although we do not yet have a complete lagrangian understanding , some progress in this direction can be found in refs .",
    "the duality ( [ bcjduality ] ) does not need to be expressed in terms of group structure constants but can alternatively be expressed in terms of a trace - based representation  @xcite .",
    "progress has also been made in understanding the underlying infinite - dimensional lie algebra  @xcite responsible for the duality .",
    "the duality between color and kinematics also appears to hold in three - dimensional theories based on three algebras  @xcite , as well as in some cases with higher - dimension operators  @xcite .",
    "some initial studies of duality and its implications for gravity in the high - energy limit have also been carried out  @xcite .",
    "at loop level , the duality remains a conjecture , but there is already nontrivial evidence in its favor , especially for supersymmetric theories . at present , the list of loop - level cases where duality - satisfying forms of the amplitude are known to hold includes :    * up to four loops for four - point @xmath25 super - yang - mills @xcite in a form valid in @xmath0 dimensions ; * up to two loops for five external gluons in @xmath25 super - yang - mills theory  @xcite ; * up to seven points for one - loop amplitudes in @xmath25 super - yang - mills theory  @xcite ; * up to two loops for four - point identical - helicity pure yang - mills amplitudes @xcite ; * through @xmath24 points for one - loop all - plus- or single - minus - helicity pure yang - mills amplitudes  @xcite ; * through four loops for a two - point ( sudakov ) form factor in @xmath26 super - yang - mills theory  @xcite ; * one - loop four - point amplitudes in yang - mills theories with less than maximally supersymmetric amplitudes  @xcite .    in this paper , we add the nonsupersymmetric pure yang - mills one - loop four - point amplitude in @xmath0 dimensions to this list . besides direct constructions , we note that the duality also appears to be consistent with loop - level infrared properties of both gauge and gravity theories  @xcite .",
    "another significant aspect of the duality is the ease with which gravity loop integrands can be obtained from gauge - theory ones , once the duality is made manifest  @xcite .",
    "one simply replaces the color factor with a kinematic numerator from a second gauge theory , @xmath27 this immediately gives the double - copy form of gravity amplitudes , @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are gauge - theory numerator factors .",
    "only one of the two sets of numerators needs to satisfy the duality ( [ bcjduality ] )  @xcite in order for the double - copy form ( [ doublecopy ] ) to be valid .",
    "the double - copy formalism has been studied at loop level in some detail in a variety of cases  @xcite .",
    "we now describe the construction of a duality - satisfying representation of the one - loop four - point amplitude in pure yang - mills .",
    "since we want the form to be valid in all dimensions and for all @xmath31 gluon states , we use formal polarizations instead of helicity states .",
    "this complicates the expression for the amplitude , but has the advantage that it allows us to straightforwardly study the amplitude and its gravity double copy in various dimensions . in this section",
    ", we also present a form of the two - loop pure yang - mills identical - helicity amplitude given in ref .",
    "@xcite that satisfies bcj duality after some rearrangement and addition of diagrams that integrate to zero . in",
    ", we use this amplitude to show that although four - graviton amplitudes are ultraviolet finite in @xmath2 at one loop , they diverge at two loops , in accordance with expectations .              for a one - loop @xmath24-point amplitude , the duality   can be used to express kinematic numerators of any diagram directly in terms of @xmath24-gon numerators . in particular , for the four - point case we have two basic relations determining triangle and bubble contributions from box numerators as illustrated in , @xmath32 the labels @xmath33 refer to the momenta and states of each external leg , while the label @xmath34 denotes the loop momentum of the leg indicated in .",
    "( the parentheses in the subscript of the numerators indicate which external legs are pinched off to form a tree attached to the loop . ) note that in the figure the momentum of each internal leg of each diagram is the same as in the other two diagrams _ except _ for the single internal leg that differs between the diagrams . in general , the bubble and triangle contributions are nonvanishing ; indeed , this explicitly holds for the bcj representation of the one - loop four - point amplitude of pure yang - mills theory that we construct .",
    "besides the diagrams in , there are diagrams with a bubble on an external leg and diagrams with a tadpole , as shown in .",
    "the duality also determines the numerators of these diagrams via @xmath35 corresponding respectively to the three relations in .",
    "( on the final line in , the hat marks leg 1 as the location where the tadpole is attached . )",
    "we use these equations to impose the auxiliary constraint that the tadpole numerators determined by bcj duality vanish identically and that all terms in the bubble - on - external - leg diagrams integrate to zero as they do for feynman diagrams .",
    "thus , these diagrams are not necessary for determining the integrated amplitudes ( though in @xmath2 the bubble - on - external - leg diagrams do affect the yang - mills ultraviolet divergence ) .",
    "once we impose the bcj conditions , the amplitude is entirely specified by the box numerators .",
    "our task is then to find an expression for the box numerators such that we obtain the correct amplitude .",
    "it is useful to impose a few auxiliary constraints to help simplify the one - loop construction :    1 .",
    "the box diagrams should have no more than four powers of loop momenta in the pure yang - mills case , matching the usual power count of feynman - gauge feynman diagrams .",
    "each numerator written in terms of formal polarization vectors respects the symmetries of the diagrams . in particular",
    ", this condition implies that once a box diagram with one ordering of external legs is specified , the other orderings are obtained simply by relabeling .",
    "the numerators of tadpole diagrams vanish prior to integration .",
    "all terms in the bubble - on - external - leg diagrams integrate to zero , as they do for feynman diagrams .    while it is not necessary to impose these conditions",
    ", they greatly simplify the construction .",
    "they ensure that the type of terms that appear in the ansatz are similar to those of ordinary feynman - gauge feynman diagrams , avoiding unnecessarily complicated terms .",
    "( using generalized gauge invariance , one can always introduce arbitrarily complicated terms into amplitudes , which cancel at the end . )    the first three conditions simplify the construction by restricting the number of terms that appear .",
    "the purpose of the fourth auxiliary constraint is a bit more subtle .",
    "while bubble - on - external - leg feynman diagrams are well defined in the on - shell limit , the freedom to reassign terms used in the construction of bcj numerators can introduce ill - defined terms into such diagrams . as a simple example , consider the effect of the term @xmath36 when added to the numerator of the first diagram of ( with @xmath37 and @xmath38 external momenta and polarizations ) .",
    "even after integration , this contribution to the diagram is ill - defined because of the on - shell intermediate propagator .",
    "such singular contributions would need to be regularized by an appropriate off - shell continuation to ensure that the introduced singularities cancel properly against singularities of other diagrams .",
    "while in principle we can introduce such a regulator , it is best to avoid this complication altogether .",
    "the fourth condition ensures that we can treat the bubble - on - external - leg contributions in the same way as for feynman diagrams .",
    "in particular , with the constraint imposed , the bubble - on - external - leg contributions match the feynman - diagram property that they are proportional to @xmath39 , after accounting for the intermediate on - shell propagator , and hence vanish in @xmath40 , for @xmath37 on shell .",
    "we note that even with the fourth constraint , near @xmath2 we encounter the same subtlety encountered with feynman diagrams : although bubble - on - external - leg contributions are set to zero in dimensional regularization , they can carry ultraviolet divergences .",
    "such ultraviolet divergences cancel against infrared ones leaving a vanishing result for on - shell bubble - on - external - leg diagrams .",
    "the net effect is that in gauge theory , we need to account for such contributions to obtain the correct ultraviolet divergences .",
    "in contrast , in gravity even near @xmath2 there are neither infrared nor ultraviolet divergences hiding in the bubble - on - external - leg contributions because an extra two powers of numerator momenta give rise to an additional vanishing .",
    ".01 cm     we start the construction with an ansatz containing all possible products of @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 , @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , where the @xmath37 are three independent external momenta , @xmath34 is the loop momentum , @xmath38 are external polarization vectors , and @xmath48 are the usual mandelstam invariants . by dimensional analysis , each numerator term must contain four momenta in addition to being linear in all four @xmath38 s",
    ". we also set @xmath49 and impose momentum conservation with @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "this yields 468 terms , each with a coefficient to be determined .",
    "our first constraint on the coefficients comes from demanding that the box numerator obey the rotation and reflection symmetries of the box diagram .",
    "this leaves us with 81 free coefficients .",
    "an ansatz for the full amplitude is then obtained by using the duality relations  ,   to determine numerators for all other diagrams .",
    "= -0.2 cm    .5 cm +   +        the next step is to determine coefficients in the ansatz by matching to the unitarity cuts of the amplitude .",
    "it is convenient to use a color - ordered form of the amplitude  @xcite for this matching .",
    "the seven diagrams contributing to the color - ordered amplitude , that is the coefficient of the color trace @xmath52 $ ] , are shown in .",
    "the other color - ordered amplitudes are simple relabelings of this one .",
    "for the one - loop four - point amplitude , the @xmath46- and @xmath47-channel unitarity cuts  shown in are sufficient to determine this color - ordered amplitude up to terms that integrate to zero .",
    "one straightforward means for determining the cuts is to construct the amplitude in feynman gauge and then take its unitarity cuts at the integrand level prior to integration .",
    "this automatically gives us an expression for the cuts valid in @xmath0 dimensions without any spurious denominators ( such as light - cone denominators from physical state projectors ) .",
    "this matching procedure nontrivially rearranges the amplitude so that bcj duality is manifest . after matching the cuts",
    ", we also impose the fourth auxiliary condition to tame the bubble - on - external - leg contributions .",
    "finally we impose that the tadpole numerators vanish . including all the auxiliary constraints with these conditions",
    ", we can solve for all but five free coefficients . because the @xmath46- and @xmath47-channel unitarity cuts are independent of these parameters , the integrated amplitude should not depend on them .    using the shorthand notation , @xmath53 and setting the free parameters to zero for simplicity ,",
    "the box numerator is @xmath54 + \\mathrm{cyclic}\\ , , \\label{ymnum}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath55 is a state - counting parameter , so that @xmath56 is the number of gluon states circulating in the loop .",
    "the notation ` @xmath57 cyclic ' indicates that one should include the three additional cyclic permutations of indices , giving a total of four permutations @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath61 of all variables @xmath62 .",
    "plain - text , computer - readable versions of the full expressions for the numerators , including also gluino- and scalar - loop contributions , can be found online  @xcite . in , we have written the expression for the box numerator in a different form than that available online in order to exhibit the cyclic symmetry .",
    "we have explicitly checked that after reducing the pure yang - mills amplitude to an integral basis , the expression is free of arbitrary parameters and in @xmath2 matches the known expression for the amplitude in ref .",
    "@xcite , after accounting for the fact that the expression in that paper is renormalized .",
    "the reduction for four - dimensional external states was carried out by expanding the external polarizations in terms of the external momenta plus a dual vector  @xcite .",
    "as another simple cross check , we have extracted the ultraviolet divergences in @xmath63 and compared them to the known forms . in @xmath63 , with our fourth auxiliary constraint there are no ultraviolet contributions from bubbles on external legs .",
    "this allows us to directly extract the ultraviolet divergences by introducing a mass regulator and then expanding in small external momenta using the methods of ref .",
    "we find complete agreement with both earlier evaluations in ref .",
    "we have also compared this to an extraction of the ultraviolet divergences directly using dimensional regularization without introducing an additional mass regulator and again find agreement .",
    "we now turn to two loops . as we shall discuss in , the four - graviton amplitude in the double - copy theory is ultraviolet finite at one loop . to test whether this continues at two loops , we need the two - loop amplitude . as it turns out , the identical - helicity amplitude is sufficient for our purposes because the divergence comes from an @xmath3 operator whose coefficient is fixed by this amplitude .",
    "we therefore now turn to finding a form of the two - loop identical - helicity amplitude where bcj duality is manifest . it would be interesting to obtain a general two - loop construction valid for all states in @xmath0 dimensions , but we do not do so here .    the identical - helicity pure yang - mills amplitude has previously been constructed in ref .",
