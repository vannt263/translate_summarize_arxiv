    "sequences of coherent and well - defined pulses play an important role in the measurement and control of quantum systems .",

    "typically , pulse sequences are defined in terms of ideal pulses with unlimited amplitude and negligible duration ( hard pulse limit ) . in practice",
    ", ideal pulses can often be approximated by rectangular pulses of finite duration , during which the phase is constant and the amplitude is set to the maximum available value .    however , simple rectangular pulses are only able to excite spins with relatively small detunings ( offset frequencies ) that are in the order of the maximum pulse amplitude ( expressed in terms of the rabi frequency of the pulse ) . for broadband applications ,",
    "e.g.  in nmr , esr or optical spectroscopy with a large range of offset frequencies or highly inhomogeneous line widths , the performance of simple rectangular pulses is not satisfactory and improved performance can be achieved by using shaped or composite pulses .",

    "composite and shaped pulses can provide significantly improved performance by compensating _ their own",
    "_ imperfections @xcite",
    ". however , the improved performance of composite pulses comes at a cost : the pulses can be significantly longer compared to simple rectangular pulses with a concomitant increase in relaxation losses during the pulses if relaxation times are comparable to the pulse duration .",

    ", tens of thousands of pulse sequence parameters can be efficiently optimized .",
    "this makes it possible to design pulses without any bias towards a specific family of pulses and to explore the physical performance limits as a function of pulse duration @xcite .",
    "this approach has provided pulses with unprecedented bandwidth and robustness with respect to experimental imperfections .",
    "most experiments do not only consist of a single pulse , but of highly orchestrated sequences of pulses that are separated by delays , which are either constant or which are varied in a systematic way @xcite .",
    "this opens up additional opportunities to improve the overall performance of experiments beyond what is achievable by simply combining the best possible _ individually _ optimized ( composite or shaped ) pulses .",
    "this makes it possible to leverage on the interplay within a pulse sequence and to exploit the potential of the pulses to compensate _",

    "i.e.  between pulses that form a pulse sequence ( cf . fig .  1 a ) and _ cooperativity _ between corresponding pulses in _ different scans _ ( cf . fig .",
    "1 b ) . in order to clearly distinguish these two pulse classes",
    ", we propose the terms * s*ame-*s*can * coop*erative pulses ( s@xmath0-coop ) for the first class and * m*ulti-*s*can * coop*erative pulses ( ms - coop ) for the second class .",
    "the mutual cancellation of pulse phase imperfections in the same scan has been denoted as _ global pulse sequence compensation _ @xcite . in this approach ,",
    "a series of ideal hard pulses is replaced by a series of so - called variable rotation pulses , for which the overall rotation has the same euler angle @xmath8 but different euler angles @xmath9 and @xmath10 compared to the euler angle decomposition of the corresponding ideal hard pulses . for a special class of so - called composite lr pulses @xcite , an explicit procedure was derived to construct a sequence of variable angle rotation pulses that can replace ideal pulses in any given pulse sequence .",
    "in addition to constant terms , for lr pulses the @xmath9 and @xmath10 angles have a _ linear _ offset dependence of opposite sign , which makes it possible to balance the phase shift created by one pulse by an equal and opposite phase shift associated with the following pulse .",

    "an efficient algorithm was developed that makes it possible to concurrently optimize a set of ms - coop pulses .",
    "this algorithm optimizes the overall performance of a number of scans , leading to an _ average _ signal with desired properties , where undesired terms that may be present in the signal of the individual scans cancel each other .",

    "a special focus will be put on the analysis of the available degrees of freedom and the scaling of overall pulse sequence performance as a function of pulse durations .",
    "in his seminal paper published in 1950 , norman ramsey introduced the so - called _ separated oscillatory fields _",
    "method for molecular beam experiments @xcite , for which he received the nobel prize in 1989 @xcite .",
    "he also realized that this approach can be generalized to _ successive oscillatory fields _ , i.e.   pairs of phase coherent pulses that are not separated in _ space _ but only in _ time _ by a delay @xmath12 in other experimental settings @xcite .",
    "one of the most important early applications of the method was to increase the accuracy of atomic clocks . even today",
    ", most amo precision measurements rely on some variant of the ramsey scheme @xcite .",
    "this scheme is also one of the fundamental experimental building blocks in magnetic resonance and is widely used in nmr , esr and mri .",

    "the overall effect of the ramsey scheme was discussed in terms of the created frequency - dependent transition probabilities . in systems where the initial bloch vectors are oriented along the @xmath13-axis , the objective of the ramsey scheme can be formulated in terms of a desired cosine modulation of the @xmath13-component of the bloch vector @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a _",

    "note that the euler rotations @xmath40 and @xmath41 are irrelevant for ramsey experiments , because the initial bloch vector @xmath58 is invariant under @xmath59 and because @xmath60 is invariant under @xmath61 . the remaining relevant rotations are @xmath62 and @xmath63 for the first pulse , the rotation @xmath57 for a spin with offset frequency @xmath47 during the delay @xmath15 and @xmath64 and @xmath65 for the second pulse .",
    "in addition to these rotations , it is common practice in spectroscopy to eliminate any remaining @xmath13-component of the bloch vector after the first pulse by a single quantum filter ( sqf ) , because it would be invariant during the delay @xmath15 and hence can not contribute to the desired @xmath15 dependence of @xmath60 .",
    "for example , in 2d nmr spectroscopy , any remaining @xmath13-component results in unwanted `` axial peaks '' which can obscure the desired `` cross peaks '' in the final two - dimensional spectrum @xcite .",

    "the mutual compensation of pulse imperfections is expected to result in superior performance of s@xmath0-coop pulses . in the next section ,",
    "two equivalent approaches for the design of s@xmath0-coop pulses for ramsey sequences will be presented .",
    "pulse sequences are designed to result in coherence transfer functions @xcite with a desired dependence on the system parameters such as resonance offsets or coupling constants , and on the delays between the pulses .",
    "it is important to realize that transfer functions are not only determined by the sequence of pulses but also by inserted _",
    "filter elements _ that are typically realized in practice by pulsed field gradients or phase cycles @xcite . depending on the chosen filter elements ,",
    "the same sequence of pulses can result in very different transfer functions and hence very different spectroscopic information .",
    "for example , experiments such as noesy @xcite , relayed correlation spectroscopy @xcite and double - quantum filtered correlation spectroscopy @xcite use different filter elements and yield very different spectroscopic information although they are all based on a sequence of three 90@xmath11 pulses @xcite .",
    "if terms of the density operator are filtered based on coherence order @xcite , the desired transfer function of a given pulse sequence is reflected by so - called coherence - order pathways @xcite but more general filter criteria can also be used @xcite .",
    "filters perform non - unitary transformations of the density operator and in general correspond to projections of the density operator to a subspace of interest .",
    "for example if the ramsey sequence is applied to a two - level system , where the state of the system is completely described by the bloch vector , a single quantum filter ( sqf ) is numerically simply implemented by setting the @xmath13-component of the bloch vector to zero . in the grape algorithm",
    ", filters can be treated in complete analogy to relaxation losses @xcite : in each iteration , the bloch vector @xmath90 ( or in general the density operator ) evolves forward in time , starting from a given initial state @xmath91 and also passes the filters forward in time . for a given final cost ( quality factor ) @xmath92 , the corresponding final costate vector @xcite @xmath93 at the final time @xmath94",
    "is evolved backward and also passes the filters backward in time .",
    "( passing a filter backward in time has the same effect as passing it forward in time , e.g.  a sqf sets the @xmath13-component of the bloch vector to zero in both directions . )",
    "the evolution of @xmath95 and @xmath96 is shown schematically in fig . 4 a. with the known state and costate vectors @xmath95 and @xmath96 , the high - dimensional gradient of the final cost with respect to the control amplitudes can be efficiently calculated @xcite in each iteration step .",
    "this gradient information can then be used to update the control parameters in each iteration until convergence is reached .",
    "this procedure makes it possible to optimize the desired transfer function of an entire sequence of pulses such that they can compensate each other s imperfections in the best possible way .",
    "the full flexibility of the available degrees of freedom is exploited by this approach , resulting in optimal s@xmath0-coop pulses .",
    "most notably , in this approach the number of pulses in a sequence is not limited .    in the case of the ramsey sequence",
    ", for each offset @xmath47 , the final figure of merit @xmath97 to be maximized can be defined in terms of the deviation of the @xmath13-component of the final bloch vector @xmath98 from the target modulation @xmath99 defined in eq .",
    ": @xmath100 and according to eq .",
    ", the final costate vector @xmath101 is given by @xmath102 formally , in eqs .  , and",
    ", the inter - pulse delay @xmath15 can also be chosen to be negative . if it is chosen to be @xmath103 ( and assuming @xmath21 ) , this results in @xmath104 .",
    "hence , an alternative figure of merit can be defined simply as @xmath105 which should be as large as possible and ideally should approach its maximum value of 1 for all offsets @xmath47 . in this case , the final costate vector @xmath106 is simply given by @xmath107 ( the two alternative offset - dependent quality factors @xmath97 and @xmath108 are closely related to the quality factors for individual pulses used in @xcite and @xcite , respectively . )    in the grape algorithm @xcite , the overall quality factor @xmath92 of a given pulse sequence is defined as the average of the local quality factors over the offset range of interest and the gradient for the overall quality factor is simply the average of the offset dependent gradients . in complete analogy to variations in offsets , variations of the scaling factor of the control amplitude can be taken into account @xcite .      here",
    "an alternative , symmetry - adapted approach for the optimization of s@xmath0-coop pulses is introduced .",
    "although in the case of ramsey pulses , this approach is equivalent to the filter - based approach discussed in the previous section , it is worthwhile to be considered as it provides a different perspective , which elucidates the inherent symmetry of the problem to design a pair of maximally cooperative ramsey pulses . in order to prepare the detailed discussion of this approach , we briefly summarize the effects of time reversal , phase inversion and phase shift on the euler angles associated with a given composite or shaped pulse @xmath35 .      in order to understand the symmetry - adapted approach to s@xmath0-coop pulses as well as the construction principles of ramsey sequences based on the classes of pulses discussed in sections 6 and 7 ,",

    "the order of the euler angles , their algebraic signs or the sign of the offset frequency where they are evaluated are different .",
    "in particular , it is important to note that simply reversing the amplitude and phase of a pulse @xmath35 in time ( yielding the pulse @xmath119 ) does _ not _ correspond to @xmath122 , except for the on - resonance case @xmath123 , where the detuning is zero .",
