    "understanding the principles governing the process of measurement has the potential to illuminate fundamental questions and practical notions of the behaviour of the physical world . yet despite the exceptional experimental success of quantum theory , many questions regarding the fundamental principles of quantum measurement remain .",
    "a key aspect of this is the restriction imposed by quantum measurement that a measurement of an unknown quantum system can not usually reveal complete information about that system .",
    "the consequences of this become evident in the problem of discriminating between two nonorthogonal quantum states  @xcite .",
    "consider a quantum system that was prepared in one of two known states , but we do not know which one .",
    "the task is to determine which of the two preparations took place .",
    "if we consider only pure states , we may represent the two possibilities as @xmath2 and @xmath3 . except for orthogonal states ( where @xmath4 ) there is no measurement that could be applied that will deterministically find the state of the system without error  @xcite .    despite this",
    ", it is possible to construct a measurement that always determines the correct state , but doing so produces a nonzero probability of obtaining an inconclusive result  @xcite .",
    "alternatively , one can construct a measurement in which all results are conclusive , but necessarily possessing some probability of error , which is to be minimized  @xcite .",
    "this minimum - error - probability measurement is known as the helstrom measurement , possessing an error probability @xmath5 dependent upon the overlap of the states , @xmath6 .",
    "should additional copies of the unknown state be available  @xcite , one can devise measurement schemes that exploit these additional copies to achieve a lowered error probability .",
    "an example is the simple `` majority vote '' scheme , where the helstrom measurement is applied to each of @xmath0 copies individually , and the overall result chosen according to which state corresponds to the majority of individual results .",
    "the probability of error in such a scheme scales as @xmath7 .    in comparison ,",
    "the collective helstrom measurement , performed at once on the collective state of all copies , @xmath8 , achieves a probability of error @xmath9 . while this strategy is strictly optimal , with @xmath10 scaling as @xmath11 for @xmath1 , it is not in general obvious whether the helstrom measurement on @xmath12 copies can be performed using only local measurements , making it difficult to practically realize using current experimental techniques .    for this special case of discriminating pure nonorthogonal quantum states , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , it is possible to achieve the same scaling of error probability as the collective helstrom measurement by using a fixed local measurement ( as in the majority vote scheme but using a different fixed measurement ) applied to all @xmath0 copies  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , by performing local measurements on each copy adaptively , choosing the measurement bases to minimize the error probability at each stage ( thus being `` locally optimal '' adaptive measurements ) , it is possible to precisely achieve the optimal performance as defined by the collective helstrom measurement for any @xmath0  @xcite .",
    "the above picture becomes much more complicated for mixed states . in this general case ,",
    "the locally optimal adaptive local measurement scheme can exhibit worse performance than the simple majority vote scheme when the number of copies exceeds some threshold  @xcite .",
    "clearly , neither scheme is the optimal local measurement scheme in the general case . to derive a local measurement scheme that is _ globally _ optimal , with the least probability of error for all @xmath0 , requires an analysis based on dynamic programming  @xcite .",

    "we analyze the performance of a number of multiple - copy two - state discrimination schemes , focussing on the distinction between local optimization and global optimization as it applies to the resulting probability of error of these schemes .",
    "we consider two classes of local measurement schemes : those using identical measurement bases for each copy ( fixed measurements ) and those in which the measurement bases are changed as each measurement result adds new knowledge ( adaptive measurements ) .",
    "this gives us four schemes for consideration : locally optimal fixed ( lof ) local measurements , globally optimal fixed ( gof ) local measurements , locally optimal adaptive ( loa ) local measurements , and globally optimal adaptive ( goa ) local measurements .",
    "for comparison , we also consider the optimal collective measurement ( ocm ) .",
    "for each of these schemes we calculate the error probability for states with various levels of depolarizing mixture , for finite @xmath0 .",
    "we then determine the large @xmath0 scaling of the schemes by directly calculating the corresponding chernoff bound in each case .",
    "doing so , we verify recent theoretical bounds  @xcite placed on the asymptotic scaling of local measurement schemes .",
    "in addition , we analyze the relationship between the lof and gof local measurement schemes as mixture is varied , and find that the latter has no advantage in the asymptotic limit for all qubit states with mixture greater than 2% .",

    "the first notable fact is that there is an absolute upper bound on @xmath152 , of about @xmath161 .",
    "that is , there is an error threshold of about 2% depolarizing noise , beyond which there is no advantage asymptotically to using any local strategy beyond the simplest ( locally optimal fixed ) one , in which the final guess is determined by whichever result occurred in the majority of measurements .",
    "the second notable fact is that @xmath152 attains this upper bound at an intermediate degree of nonorthogonality of the pure states ( prior to depolarization ) .",
    "as the two pure states approach orthogonality ( @xmath15 ) or identity ( @xmath162 ) , the value of @xmath152 is zero .",
    "that is , any degree of mixture added to such states reduces the optimal solution to a repetition of the optimal single - qubit measurement . in the limit @xmath163 , this result is not surprising , as in this limit for pure states the fully biased measurement ( which is the globally optimal fixed measurement ) becomes the same as the unbiased measurement , because the states become orthogonal .",
    "but in the other limit , @xmath164 , these two measurements are as different as they can be , so the discontinuous change in the optimal measurement as mixture is added is surprising , and may even be thought paradoxical . what must be borne in mind",
