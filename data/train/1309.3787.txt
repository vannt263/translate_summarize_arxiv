    "following hempel s definition of distance for heegaard splittings  @xcite , there have been a number of results showing that knots with high distance bridge surfaces are well behaved .",

    "most recently , the cabling conjecture was established for all knots with a bridge surface of distance at least three  @xcite .",
    "these results motivate us to study low distance knots and links .",
    "( we will use the term `` link '' below to mean both one - component and multiple - component links . ) links that have a bridge surface of distance two are of particular interest because a link with a minimal bridge sphere of distance one always contains an essential meridional surface  @xcite and links with bridge surfaces of distance greater than two share many nice properties that often allow them to be addressed collectively as  high distance \" links .    in this paper , we prove the following theorem .",
    "precise definitions will be given later .",

    "@xmath1 can be decomposed as a tangle product of a bridge - split montesinos tangle @xmath4 with an essential tangle @xmath5 such that @xmath6 is a disk bridge surface for @xmath4 and either @xmath4 is rational or the exterior of @xmath7 in @xmath8 contains an incompressible , boundary incompressible annulus , or 3 .",
    "@xmath1 can be obtained via banding from a link @xmath2 that has a bridge sphere with the same euler characteristic as @xmath9 but has distance 0 or 1 .",
    "conclusion ( 2 ) of theorem [ thm : main ] is illustrated in figure [ fig : thmexmont ] . conclusion ( 3 ) is illustrated in figure [ fig : thmexband ] .",
    "all of the conclusions are discussed in detail in section  [ sect : constr ] .     with a tangle @xmath5",

    "( each group of strands may , in general , consist of arbitrarily many strands.),width=192 ]        we note that this paper is the analogue to recent results about 3-manifolds with distance - two heegaard splittings .",
    "hempel  @xcite and thompson  @xcite ( independently ) classified all 3-manifolds that have genus two , distance - two heegaard splittings .",
    "in work in preparation , rubinstein and thompson  @xcite have proved a similar classification theorem for all manifolds that have a distance - two heegaard splitting of any genus .",
    "portions of the proof of theorem [ thm : main ] are inspired by the work of rubinstein and thompson on distance - two heegaard splittings .",
    "the analogy between the present work and these results about heegaard splittings is most easily seen in the three - bridge case .",
    "theorem  [ thm : main ] implies the following :    [ coro : main ] if @xmath1 is a 3-bridge knot with a minimal bridge sphere of distance two , then one of the following holds :    1 .",
    "the exterior of @xmath1 contains an incompressible meridional 4-punctured sphere .",
    "@xmath1 is obtained by banding a 3-bridge presentation of either the unknot , a 2-bridge knot , or the connected sum of two 2-bridge knots .",
    "@xmath1 is a small montesinos knot .",
    "recall that every genus - two 3-manifold is the double - branched cover of @xmath0 over a three - bridge knot and that every genus - two heegaard surface is the lift of a 6-punctured bridge sphere to the double - branched cover .",
    "additionally , every essential loop in a genus - two heegaard surface is the lift of an essential loop in the corresponding bridge sphere .",
    "this fact implies that the distance of a 6-punctured bridge sphere is equal to the distance of the corresponding genus - two heegaard surface in the double - branched cover .",
    "thus , as expected , the heegaard splittings in the hempel / thompson classification are precisely the double branched covers of the links in corollary  [ coro : main ] .",
