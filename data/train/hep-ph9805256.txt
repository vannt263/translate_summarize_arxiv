    "recently it has been found that cumulant moments of the multiplicity distributions in both @xmath0 annihilations and hadronic collisions show prominent oscillatory behavior when plotted as a function of their order @xmath4 @xcite . in ref.@xcite",
    "this behavior is attributed to the qcd - type of branching processes apparently taking place in those reactions . however , in refs.@xcite we have shown that the same behavior of the moments emerges essentially from the modified negative binomial distribution ( mnbd ) ( which actually describes the data of _ negatively charged particles _ much better than the negative binomial distribution ( nbd ) @xcite ) .",

    "this fact corresponds to our previous work in which we have found that the @xmath35 moments obtained from the mnbd are much better than those of the nbd in @xmath0 annihilation[2,3 ] : however in @xmath1-@xmath1 collisions they are almost equivalent .",

    ", the mnbd describes the experimental data better ( for @xmath0 annihilations ) than or as well as ( for @xmath1-@xmath1 and @xmath2-@xmath3 collisions ) the nbd .",
    "what we have found in the present analyses suggests us the following : in @xmath0 annihilation , the stochastic pure birth process with the binomial distribution at @xmath12=0 is useful , becasuse the finite number ( corresponding to @xmath68 ) of the excited hadrons ( or the pair creation of quarks ) is probably expected . in other words , the binomial distribution as",
    "the initial condition is more realistic than other condition  ( @xmath69 ) in the stochastic approach .",
    "to know stochastic property of the mnbd , we have considered the generalized mnbd . in its concrete application , we have known that the discrete distribution of eq.(a5 ) can not explain the oscillating behaviors of the cumulant moment observed in @xmath0 annihilations and in hadronic collisions than the mnbd , eq.([pn - mnbd ] ) .",
    "for example , @xmath34 s values for discrete analysis of data at @xmath65=900 gev are as follows : ( @xmath70)=(1 , 2.22 , 65.2 ) , ( 2 , 1.33 , 63.0 ) and ( 3 , 0.06 , 60.8 ) .",
    "these results suggest us that it is difficult to determine the best combination of parameters , because of three parameters .",
    "it seems to be necessary more carefulness and skillfulness than the use of the mnbd .",
    "thus the generalized mnbd is given in appendix .",
    "however , we are expecting that eq.(a5 ) will become useful in analyses of data of some reactions at higher energies , since it has both stochastic characteristics of the mnbd and the nbd .    *",
