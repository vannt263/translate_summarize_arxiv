    "magnetic monopoles are an important element in a complete picture of our universe .",
    "their existence would explain the quantization of electric ( and magnetic ) charge via the dirac quantization equation @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "they appear as topological defects from symmetry breaking in grand unified theories ( guts ) @xcite with masses @xmath6gev @xcite , depending on the breaking scheme . additionally , they would bring a complete symmetry to maxwell s equations .",
    "magnetic monopoles produced in the early universe via gut symmetry breaking would be topologically stable and accelerated along magnetic field lines .",
    "the universe is full of long range magnetic fields that would act upon the monopoles over their lifetime , likely imparting energies @xmath7gev @xcite .",
    "therefore , magnetic monopoles below this energy scale should reach and travel through the earth at relativistic speeds .",
    "a relativistic magnetic monopole moving through a transparent medium would produce copious amounts of cherenkov light , @xmath88300 times a single muon in ice @xcite .",
    "thus , large cherenkov detectors like icecube are an ideal experiment to search for these particles .    the current best limits on the flux of magnetic monopoles at the 90% confidence level ( c.l .",
    ") for relativistic speeds between @xmath9 and lorentz boost @xmath10 are set by the antares detector @xcite at the @xmath11 scale .",
    "this recent result is the first in this velocity range to surpass the results from the amanda detector @xcite , icecube s proof of concept , which set flux limits @xmath12 .",
    "antares also searched for magnetic monopoles below the cherenkov threshold but still energetic enough to knock off electrons that produce cherenkov light .",
    "this extension sets flux limits at the @xmath13 scale down to a speed of @xmath14 . for lower speeds ,",
    "macro provides comprehensive flux limits @xmath15 @xcite for speeds down to @xmath16 while flux limits at ultra - relativistic speeds are set by radio detectors rice @xcite and anita @xcite at the @xmath17 scale .",
    "these are important as they are flux limits below the parker bound @xcite ( @xmath18 ) , an astrophysical flux limit derived by considering the survival of the galactic magnetic field in the presence of magnetic monopoles .",
    "more sophisticated calculations that consider velocity @xcite relax the bound on relativistic magnetic monopoles above a mass of @xmath19gev due to the shortened time spent in the galactic field . however , an extended parker bound found by considering the survival of a modeled seed field still produces flux limits well below experiments , with @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "this paper describes the search for relativistic magnetic monopoles in data taken with the icecube detector between may 2007 and april 2008 .",
    "the analysis is optimized for magnetic monopoles with modest lorentz boosts ( @xmath21 ) and charge @xmath22 .",
    "the derived flux limits are conservative upper bounds for magnetic monopoles with larger @xmath3 or charge , as these cases produce more light in the ice . the paper is organized as follows . section [ sec : det ] describes the icecube detector .",

    "icecube is a telescope at the south pole which detects neutrinos by measuring the cherenkov light from secondary charged particles produced in neutrino - nucleon interactions @xcite .",
    "a total of 5160 digital optical modules ( doms ) are arranged in 86 vertical strings frozen in the ice between 1500 and 2500@xmath23 m below the surface over a total volume of 1 @xmath24 .",
    "construction was completed in december 2010 .",
    "the data for this analysis were taken during the construction phase , when only 22 of the 86 strings had been deployed .",
    "the 22 strings contain a volume of @xmath25 .",
    "the dom is the centerpiece of the icecube detector and houses a 10-inch photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) to detect light , onboard electronics for pulse digitization , and led light sources for calibration .",
    "light signals which pass a threshold of 0.25 photo - electron ( pe ) pmt pulse heights are digitized and the dom is said to launch. two types of waveform digitizers are utilized .",
    "the analog transient waveform digitizer ( atwd ) bins the waveform with a 3.3@xmath23ns sampling period over a readout window of 420@xmath23ns .",
    "it supports three channels with different gains in order to extend its effective dynamic range .",
    "the pmt analog to digital converter ( adc ) collects data at a slower sampling rate of 25@xmath23ns and records for 6.4@xmath26 .    a time is calculated for the launch by re - syncing the threshold crossing to the next leading edge of the internal dom clock , which oscillates at 40 mhz .",
    "more precise timing is achieved by later reconstructing the leading edge of the digitized waveform , though in this analysis the coarse time is sufficient . for more information on the dom and its components ,",
    "see @xcite .",
    "each waveform digitizer outputs the signal in terms of counts / bin values that directly map to the voltage recorded . for the pmt adc , which is the only channel used in this analysis , a single photo - electron corresponds to @xmath27 counts @xcite .",
    "the pmt adc saturates at 1024 counts , which occurs when @xmath28pe s arrive in a single 25@xmath23ns bin .",
    "more generally , dom s that receive @xmath29pe s over the full readout window typically saturate .",
    "figure [ fig : wfs ] shows example pmt adc waveforms for both background and signal events at various distances to the dom .",
    "the flattened top for the signal indicates the point where the digitizer saturates .",
    "once a launch is recorded , the dom checks the four nearest neighbors on the string to see if another hit occurred within a 1@xmath30s time window . by requiring companion launches to occur ,",
    "the effect of dark noise hits is reduced .",
    "if this local coincidence condition is met , the digitized waveforms and time are sent to the surface .",
    "a trigger algorithm is applied to determine if a physics event has been detected .",
    "for the 22 string detector , this algorithm checked if 8 hits were recorded within a sliding 5@xmath26 time window . for data in this analysis ,",
    "the average trigger rate is @xmath31hz and is vastly dominated by muons generated in cosmic ray air showers in the atmosphere above the south pole .",
    "against this background a magnetic monopole event would stand out due to the much higher light deposition .",
    "for this analysis a further filter is applied to the data online at the south pole , requiring at least 80 dom launches in an event @xcite .",
    "this retains all bright events , regardless of direction .",
    "the passing rate for this filter is @xmath32hz .",
    "it consists of muon bundles containing hundreds of muons generated by high energy cosmic ray primaries .",
    "all data that pass this filter are sent north via satellite to a data warehouse for use by the entire collaboration .",
    "simulation of the background and signal are done within the ` icetray ` framework , a ` c++ ` based code written for use by the icecube collaboration .",
    "it includes tools to simulate the detector response to light produced by particles as well as the triggering and filtering algorithms .",
    "this allows simulated events to be compared directly to the experimental data .",
    "background simulation is composed of muon bundles and neutrinos produced in the atmosphere by high energy cosmic rays .",
    "the generation uses importance sampling in energy so that at the final analysis level the statistical uncertainty in background prediction is of the order of systematic uncertainty or less .",
    "atmospheric muon bundles are simulated with ` corsika ` @xcite using two primary types : proton to represent light elements and iron to represent heavier ions .",
    "primary energies are simulated between @xmath33 and @xmath19gev .",
    "events are generated with an @xmath34 spectrum to oversample the high energy region .",
    "the events are weighted to fits of extensive air showers introduced by the kascade collaboration @xcite .",
    "the muon bundles are then propagated through the ice using ` mmc`(muon monte carlo ) @xcite .    `",
    "anis`(all neutrino interaction simulation ) @xcite is used to simulate both muon and electron neutrino events .",
    "the neutrinos are generated with an @xmath35 spectrum and given weights corresponding to a conventional atmospheric neutrino flux from honda @xcite and a prompt flux from charmed meson production based on the enberg , reno , and sarcevic model @xcite .",
    "code developed specifically for this analysis is used to generate and propagate the signal magnetic monopoles .",
    "three datasets are created for discrete speeds of @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "monopole tracks are generated by randomly distributing vertices on a circular `` generation plane '' with radius 650 m at a distance of 1000 m from the detector center .",
    "from the vertices , monopoles are propagated towards and through the detector with directions perpendicular to the plane . during generation ,",
    "the orientations of the generation plane relative to the detector are randomized , thereby creating an isotropic monopole flux through the detector .    above @xmath38 and below @xmath39 , the electromagnetic energy loss of magnetic monopoles through matter",
    "is well described by a combination of ionization and atomic excitations , collectively referred to as collisional energy loss @xcite . as the choice of simulated events only reach @xmath40 , this is the only energy loss considered in propagation . above @xmath39 ,",
    "energy losses from pair production and photo - nuclear interactions surpass the collisional losses .",
    "these energy losses are considered in section [ sec : angaccearth ] for magnetic monopoles traveling through the earth with large boost factors .",
    "bremsstrahlung , which is proportional to @xmath41 , is heavily suppressed .",
    "for each dataset , 100,000 events are generated at a mass of @xmath42gev .",
    "the effect of choosing one mass is mitigated since the cherenkov light output only depends on speed which remains essentially constant over the 1.2@xmath23 km path through the detector .",
    "the main strategy employed to select relativistic magnetic monopoles is to look for extremely bright events .",
    "this is measured by counting the number of dom launches which capture a high charge .",
    "high charge dom launches are defined as ones that saturate the pmt adc channel .",
    "figure [ fig : nsat ] shows the number of these `` saturated hits '' ( nsat ) . to visualize the signal event rates , a flux of @xmath43 is used .",
    "a secondary strategy is to exploit the arrival directions of the incoming particle tracks .",
    "the dominant background of atmospheric muon bundles can only reach the detector from above the horizon .",
    "this background can be suppressed by focusing on events with arrival directions below the horizon .",
    "event selection consists of three phases .",
    "first , a simple filter is applied to reduce the data to a manageable size . then , particle tracks are reconstructed and poorly reconstructed events are rejected using quality cuts . at the final stage , an optimized cut which maximizes the model rejection factor ( mrf ) @xcite is found . to reduce experimenter bias ,",
    "the maximized mrf is found using simulated background alone .",
    "the resulting cut is then applied to the experimental data .",
    "table [ tab : rates ] displays the final event rates ( in events / year ) for each of the datasets considered at all levels of the analysis .",
    "since directional information is used mainly to distinguish between up and down - going particles , pointing accuracy is only of secondary importance .",
    "contrary to most icecube analyses , which use computationally intensive likelihood methods to reconstruct the particle tracks with sub - degree accuracy , a very fast analytic fit proved sufficient for this analysis .",
    "the fundamental piece of datum used by the reconstruction is a `` hit '' , which is defined as the location @xmath44 and a time @xmath45 of a dom launch .",
    "the track direction and particle speed are reconstructed by a least - squares fit of the observed hit pattern @xmath46 to a plane wave of light , whose analytic solution is given by @xcite    @xmath47    where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the average position and time of all the hits .",
    "the hit times @xmath50 correspond to the time at which the dom records a launch .",
    "studies of the reconstruction accuracy demonstrated this to be a better definition for @xmath50 than the peak time of the pmt pulse , likely because the launch time corresponds to the arrival time of those cherenkov photons which are least delayed by scattering in the ice .",
    "the reconstructed track direction is defined by the velocity vector @xmath51 .",
    "because of the simple straight line hypothesis , and because the linefit does not take into account photon propagation through the ice , the reconstruction accuracy improves if only hits close to the particle track are included in the fit .",
    "this is achieved by selecting hits in which a large number of photons are detected .",
    "a zenith angle resolution ( @xmath52 ) , defined here as the median difference between the true and reconstructed zenith direction for simulated events at the penultimate cut level , is achieved by only using hits that saturate the pmt adc . shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : satdist ] are the distances from the primary track to a saturated hit .",
    "saturated hits are up to @xmath53 m away for muons and up to @xmath54 m for the fastest monopoles .",
    "the relative closeness of the saturated hits mean timing information will be less affected by scattering and absorption , improving the accuracy of reconstructing the particle .",
    "in addition , all hits in which the saturation occurred more than 500ns after the dom launched are excluded from the fit .",
    "these are saturated hits where the launch time is caused by something other than the saturating particle , e.g. dark noise .",
    "this creates errors in the reconstruction since the hit information includes a time well before the physics event .",
    "roughly @xmath55 of the saturate hits are removed by this criterion .",
    "the robustness of the linefit against timing inaccuracies in the hardware was studied by smearing the hit times consistent with the frequency of the internal dom clock .",
    "this resulted in a negligible change on the reconstruction accuracy ( @xmath56 ) and final sensitivity ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the low level filter selects events with high cherenkov light yield by requiring at least two of the hits to saturate ( nsat@xmath571 ) .",
    "this cut reduces background by @xmath58 and signal by @xmath59 and ensures that the minimum required two hits are available to reconstruct the track direction .    [",

    "in order to describe the results as pertaining to an isotropic flux at the surface of the earth , the efficiency of the analysis as a function of zenith is combined with the acceptance of relativistic magnetic monopoles through the earth .",
    "the previous amanda analysis did a similar procedure @xcite .      for an isotropic , mono - energetic flux @xmath60 of magnetic monopoles with mass m and kinetic energy @xmath61 at the earth s surface ,",
    "the resulting @xmath3 of the monopole flux at the detector is calculated for @xmath62 values in increments of 0.1 .",

    "dashed for @xmath63 , and solid for @xmath9 . ]",
    "figure [ fig : pspace ] shows the angular acceptance of relativistic magnetic monopoles traveling through the earth . each line indicates the boundary between the mass and kinetic energy values which allow the monopole to reach icecube at a particular speed threshold for a given zenith . for instance , if the mass and kinetic energy are in the region above the @xmath64 line , these describe a magnetic monopole that can remain relativistic traveling the diameter of the earth , while those above the @xmath65 can remain relativistic traveling through the atmosphere and the @xmath66 km of south polar ice to reach the detector .    the shape of the lines can be understood by considering the full acceptance ( @xmath64 ) case :    *    the collisional energy loss straight up through the earth is @xmath67gev .",
    "this loss is not enough to slow relativistic magnetic monopoles with masses above @xmath68gev to sub - relativistic speeds .",
    "therefore , the acceptance is determined solely by the starting energy .    magnetic monopoles with masses between @xmath69gev can still reach the detector so long as there is enough kinetic energy to overcome the collisional loss .",
    "hence , the line flattens out around @xmath70gev .    for magnetic monopoles with masses below @xmath71gev , the necessary starting energy begins to increase to overcome the increasing effect of pair production and photo - nuclear energy losses , which begin to dominate for @xmath72 .",
    "the analysis is much more sensitive to an up - going signal , due to the large atmospheric muon bundle background .",
    "this is described quantitatively by calculating the effective area as a function of zenith .",
    "the effective area corresponds to the cross sectional area of an ideal detector with 100% efficiency . using the same @xmath62 bins as above",

    "[ sec : ssim ] , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , since the generated flux is isotropic .",
    "this is conservatively generalized to any speed at the detector by treating the effective area as a step function , e.g. @xmath78 , etc . for @xmath79 ,",
    "the effective area is set to zero .      the final limit on a flux with given mass and kinetic energy at the earth s surface ( @xmath80 ) is calculated by scaling a reference flux with the ratio of the feldman - cousins upper limit ( @xmath81 ) @xcite to the expected number of signal events seen in the detector using the reference flux .",
    "the expected signal event number is found by going through each @xmath62 bin and determining ( 1 ) what speed the monopole will have at the detector ( @xmath82 ) based on section [ sec : angaccearth ] and ( 2 ) calculating the effective area for that speed and @xmath62 bin based on section [ sec : angaccanalysis ] .",
    "the final flux limit becomes : @xmath83    @xmath84s is the total livetime of the analyzed data set , @xmath85 is the final background expectation from table [ tab : rates ] , @xmath86 is the width of the @xmath62 bins , and the @xmath87 arises from the azimuthal symmetry of the earth . for most tested values of @xmath88 ,",
    "the final speed is the same for all bins and the flux limit calculation returns the same answer as table [ tab : finallimits ] .    to place this result in context , fig .",
    "[ fig : finalresult ] displays the current best experimental flux limits over a wide range of mass and kinetic energy values of magnetic monopoles .",
    "below @xmath89 the analysis does not apply as the monopoles fall below the cherenkov threshold , while above @xmath10 , the radio neutrino detectors offer better sensitivity .    for the range of mass / kinetic energy pairs resulting in @xmath90 ,",
    "this analysis provides in general the best flux limits to date .",

    "lines showing the angular acceptance solid angle @xmath91 for the @xmath63 magnetic monopoles are included .",
    "the solid angle is found by multiplying 2@xmath92 by the range of @xmath62 for which the mass and energy combination can reach the detector .",
    "hence the shape matches fig .",
    "[ fig : pspace ] . as the solid angle approaches 2@xmath92 , acceptance below the horizon",
    "is lost and the limit becomes much weaker .    for the cases where @xmath93 , the flux limit from this analysis is conservative , as the monopole would have a large light contribution from secondary cascades which are not yet included in the simulation .",
    "these will make the event brighter in the detector and increase the selection efficiency .",
    "this analysis is the first search for magnetic monopoles using the next generation of neutrino telescopes . a final flux limit of @xmath94 for @xmath95 is found . for speeds down to @xmath9 ,",

    "even with a single year of data operating at @xmath98% of the final instrumented volume , experimental flux limits are achieved that are a factor of 4 below the current best constraints up to @xmath99 and provide a good compliment to the more sensitive radio searches for ultra - relativistic monopoles .",
