    "at present the success of the standard model(sm ) is well known and doubtless .",
    "however , the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking(ewsb ) remains the most prominent mystery in current particle physics .",
    "the higgs particle that is assumed to trigger the ewsb in the sm has not been found .",
    "in addition , there are prominent problems of triviality and unnaturalness in the higgs sector .",
    "thus , the sm can only be an excellent effective field theory below some high energy scales .",
    "new physics beyond the sm should exist at the tev scale .",
    "the possible new physics scenarios at the tev scale might be supersymmetry(susy)@xcite , dynamical symmetry breaking@xcite , extra dimensions@xcite , the little higgs model @xcite etc .    among the extended models beyond the sm , the little higgs model offers a very promising solution to the hierarchy problem in which the higgs boson is naturally light as a result of nonlinearly realized symmetry .",
    "the key feature of this model is that the higgs boson is a pseudo - goldstone boson of an approximate global symmetry which is spontaneously broken by a vacuum expectation value(vev ) at a scale of a few tev and thus is naturally light .",
    "such model can be regarded as the important candidate of new physics beyond the sm .",
    "the littlest higgs model @xcite is a simplest and phenomenologically viable model to realizes the little higgs idea .",
    "the model predicts the presence of the new gauge bosons @xmath6 and their masses are in the range of a few tev , except for @xmath1 in the range of hundreds of gev .",
    "the minimality of the littlest higgs model would leave the characteristic signatures at present and future high energy collider experiments .",
    "it is widely believed that the hadron colliders , such as the tevatron and the lhc running in 2007 , can directly probe the possible new physics beyond the sm up to a few tev , while the tev energy linear @xmath7 collider(lc ) is also required to complement the probe of the new particles with detailed measurements@xcite .",
    "a unique feature of the tev energy lc is that it can be transformed to @xmath8 or @xmath9 collider(the photon collider ) by the laser - scattering method . in this case",
    "the energy and luminosity of the photon beams would be the same order of magnitude of the original electron beams and the set of final states at the photon collider is much rich than that in the @xmath7 mode .",
    "furthermore , one can vary polarizations of photon beams relatively easily , which is advantageous for experiments . in some scenarios ,",
    "the photon collider is the best instrument for the discovery of the signals of the new physics models and will be able to study multiple vector boson production with high precision .",
    "the probe of the new particles , specially the new gauge bosons predicted by the littlest higgs model , can provide a direct way to test the model .",
    "the cern large hadronic collider(lhc ) , with the center of energy @xmath10 tev , has the ability to produce these heavy new particles . in some literatures@xcite ,",
    "the production mechanism of these new particles at the lhc has been studied and the most promising production process is drell - yan process which shows that the lhc has the potential to detect them .",
    "however , the detailed study of these new gauge boson couplings needs the precision measurement at the future lc , and such work can be performed at the planned international linear collider(ilc ) with the center of mass(c.m . )",
    "energy @xmath11=300 gev-1.5 tev and the yearly luminosity 500 @xmath12@xcite .",
    "specially for the gauge boson @xmath1 , we find that the global symmetry structure @xmath13 of the littlest higgs model allows a substantially light @xmath1 with the mass about a few hundred gev , and such gauge boson is light enough to be produced at the first running of the ilc .",
    "therefore , the exploring of this light @xmath1 at the ilc would play an important role in testing the littlest higgs model .",
    "some phenomenological studies of littlest higgs model via @xmath14 collision at the ilc has been done@xcite .",
    "the ilc has the capability to discover the effects of the littlest higgs model over the entire theoretically interesting range of parameters and to determine the couplings of the heavy gauge bosons to the precision of a few percent .",
    "the realization of @xmath8 collision would provide us a better chances to probe @xmath1 . in this paper",
    ", we study a @xmath1 production process associated with w boson pair via @xmath8 collision realized at the ilc , i.e. , @xmath15 . the motivation to study",
    "this process is that @xmath16 production mode can be realized below the tev scale and its cross section is large enough to detect @xmath1 with the high energy and luminosity of the ilc . on the other hand ,",
    "such process offers a direct study of vector boson couplings in the littlest higgs model .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the section two ,",
    "we briefly review the littlest higgs model . in the section three ,",
    "the calculation process of the cross section is presented .",
    "the section four contains our numerical results and conclusions .",
    "the minimal model containing the little higgs ideas is called the littlest higgs model .",
    "this model is based on a non - linear sigma model and consists of a global @xmath17 symmetry which is broken down to @xmath18 by a vacuum condensate @xmath19 tev which results in 14 goldstone bosons . the effective field theory of those goldstone bosons is parameterized by a non - linear @xmath20-model with a gauge symmetry @xmath21^{2}$ ] .",

    "the four - point couplings of the form @xmath46 and @xmath47 lead to a quadratically divergent in the higgs mass arising from the seagull diagrams involving gauge boson loops . from eq(9 ) , we can see that , in the littlest higgs model , the @xmath48 and @xmath49 couplings have unusual forms which serves to exactly cancel the quadratic divergence in the higgs mass leaded by @xmath50 and @xmath47 .",
    "the cancellation of such divergence is a crucial feature of the little higgs theory .",
    "the key test of the little higgs mechanism in the gauge sector is the experimental verification of this feature .",
    "some literatures have discussed the prospects at the lhc@xcite .",
    "the ewsb in the littlest higgs model is triggered by the higgs potential generated by one - loop radiative correction and massless @xmath38 and @xmath39 obtain their masses .",
    "the higgs potential includes the parts generated by the gauge boson loops as well as the the fermion loops .    the ewsb induces further mixing between the light and heavy gauge bosons and the final observed mass eigenstates are the light sm - like bosons @xmath51 and @xmath52 observed in experiment , and new heavy bosons @xmath53 and @xmath0 that could be observed in future experiments .",

    "on the other hand , the ewsb also induces cubic couplings between the physical higgs boson and the gauge bosons .",
    "the explicit forms of these couplings can be obtained from eq.(1 ) after linearizing the theory .",
    "the three diagonal coupling , @xmath61 , add up to zero .",
    "so do the two diagonal couplings @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "these cancellations can be traced back to eq.(9 ) , and are therefore directly related to the crucial feature of cancellation of quadratic divergences . measuring",
    "the diagonal coupling would provide the most direct way to verify the little higgs theory .",
    "such measurement requires associated production of a new heavy boson with a higgs and is a difficult task .",
    "however , it is much easier to measure the off - diagonal couplings , such as @xmath64 .",
    "although these couplings do not directly participate in the cancellation of quadratic divergences , verifying their structure would provide a strong evidence for the crucial feature of the model .",
    "the gauge kinetic terms @xmath65 take the standard form : @xmath66 these terms yield 3- and 4-particle interactions among the gauge bosons .",
    "there are still other interactions in the littlest higgs model , @xmath67 .",
    "the fermion kinetic terms @xmath68 can give the couplings of the gauge bosons with fermions .",
    "the couplings of the scalars h and @xmath69 with fermions can be derived from the yukawa interaction terms @xmath70 .",
    "the effective higgs potential , the coleman - weinberg potential @xmath71 , is generated at one - loop and higher orders due to the interactions of higgs with gauge bosons and fermions , which can induce the ewsb by driving the higgs mass squared parameter negative .",
    "it is shown via above discussion that the new heavy gauge bosons @xmath72 are predicted in the littlest higgs model and these new particles might produce the characteristic signatures at the present and future high energy collider experiments @xcite .",
    "from the gauge kinetic terms @xmath65 , one can derive the 3-point and 4-point gauge self - coupling expressions . with all momenta out - going ,",

    "comparing the mass of @xmath83 with the sm @xmath38 , we find there exists a correction term in order of @xmath84 .",
    "limited by the electroweak precision data , such correction should be much small .",

    "so the change of the cross section mainly depends on the coupling @xmath158 .",
    "since we are interested in final states where all the gauge bosons are identified , the event rate is determined not only by the total cross section , but also by the reconstruction efficiency that depends on the particular decay channels of the vector bosons .",

    "on the other hand , the decay mode @xmath172 involves the off - diagonal coupling @xmath176 and the experimental precision measurement of such off - diagonal coupling is more easier than that of diagonal coupling .",
    "so , the decay mode @xmath172 would provide a better way to verify the crucial feature of quadratic divergence cancellation in higgs mass .",
    "the decay mode @xmath177 is of course kinematically forbidden in sm , but the decay @xmath178 is the dominant decay mode of the higgs boson with mass above 135 gev(one or both of the w bosons is off - shell for higgs mass below @xmath179 ) .",

    "the @xmath0 production mechanics has been studied at the lhc@xcite , and such particle can also be produced by @xmath14 collision .",

    "so , the reliable prediction of the @xmath0 signals via these processes would be difficult .",
    "on the other hand , with the small @xmath180 coupling and high energy s - channel suppression , the s - channel @xmath0 production in @xmath14 collisions would of course be suppressed which makes @xmath8 production mode become even more important , specially for gaining an insight into the gauge structure of the littlest higgs model .    in summary , the new gauge bosons are the typical particles of the littlest higgs model . with the mass in the scale of hundreds gev ,",
