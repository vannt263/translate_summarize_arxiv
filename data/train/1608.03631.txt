    "the standard - model extension ( sme)@xcite is an effective field theory approach to describe effects of a more fundamental theory beyond the standard model by introducing additional terms to the standard - model lagrangian . in the photon sector , these additional terms result in the following dispersion relation : @xmath0 with @xmath1 hence , @xmath2 results in an energy and direction - dependent photon dispersion , and @xmath3 and @xmath4 additionally introduce a polarization dependence and thus vacuum birefringence . furthermore , eqs .",
    "( [ eq : sigma0])-([eq : sigma3 ] ) imply a direction dependence of photon propagation .",
    "the coefficients @xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 are nonzero only for even @xmath8 , while @xmath9 are nonzero only for odd @xmath8 , where @xmath8 is the mass dimension of the corresponding operator .",
    "astrophysical tests are highly sensitive even to tiny values of these coefficients since their effects accumulate as photons travel across large distances .",
    "photon dispersion is tested by measuring arrival times of photons from short transient events such as gamma - ray bursts at different wavelengths ; see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "vacuum birefringence induced by @xmath3 and @xmath4 leads to an energy - dependent rotation of the polarization vector , which can be observed directly in spectropolarimetric measurements .    due to the anisotropic nature of lorentz - invariance violation ( liv ) in the sme , searches utilizing a single source",
    "can only test a linear combination of coefficients .",
    "for example , at @xmath10 there are 16 real coefficients determining the complex @xmath11 , and at @xmath12 there are 25 real coefficients of the @xmath13 . in this paper",
    "we present a search for anisotropic liv using optical polarization measurements of active galactic nuclei ( agns),@xcite and a search for anisotropic nonbirefringent liv using gamma - ray time - of - flight measurements of agn flares.@xcite in both searches , we observe multiple astrophysical sources and then constrain the coefficients @xmath11 and @xmath13 individually using a spherical decomposition of the results . here we outline the methods used , while the actual limits on the sme coefficients will be published elsewhere .",
    "x - ray polarization measurements of gamma - ray bursts have already been used to constrain the @xmath10 coefficients in previous studies.@xcite however , the statistical and sytematic errors on the reported x - ray polarization properties are very large and the detections are still not firmly established .",
    "the polarization angles of two photons observed at energies @xmath14 and @xmath15 emitted at redshift @xmath16 which initially have the same polarization angle will differ by@xcite @xmath17 where we introduced the parameter  @xmath18 , assuming that @xmath10 terms are the dominant correction to the standard - model lagrangian .",
    "we measured @xmath19 using multiple spectropolarimetric observations of 27 different agns in the northern hemisphere . using a likelihood ratio test",
    ", we compared the observations of distant ( @xmath20 ) to `` nearby '' ( @xmath21 ) sources in order to set upper limits on the liv - induced rotation parameter  @xmath18 .",
    "furthermore , we used spectrally integrated optical polarization measurements of 36 southern - hemisphere agns .",
    "the rotation of the polarization angle leads to a partial cancellation of the net polarization . for each observation",
    ", we found the largest value of  @xmath18 that was still in agreement with the observed polarization fraction , as an upper limit on a possible liv .",
    "both the spectropolarimetric and the spectrally integrated polarization measurements resulted in strong upper limits on liv in the photon sector for each source .",
    "while most coefficients of the sme are best constrained using polarization measurements , the coefficients @xmath5 with even @xmath8 are nonbirefringent .",
    "they can only be constrained using time - of - flight measurements .",
    "we used measurements of @xmath22 to @xmath23 gamma - ray lightcurves of 24 agns to derive direction - dependent constraints on the speed of light in vacuum.@xcite using the _ discan _ method,@xcite we found constraints on the quadratic energy dependence of the speed of light introduced by the @xmath12 sme coefficients .",
    "no significant energy dependence of the light - travel time was found , and we set upper limits @xmath24 on the liv coefficients .",
    "they are not strong enough to constrain liv at the planck scale .",
    "however , they represent the first complete set of constraints in the @xmath12 photon sector .",
    "when constraining the rotation of the polarization direction or the energy - dependence of the photon velocity from an astrophysical source @xmath25 , a limit  @xmath26 is placed on a linear combination of sme coefficients : @xmath27 when observing @xmath28 sources , we can rewrite these inequalities in matrix form in terms of the real parameters comprising the sme coefficients : @xmath29 where @xmath30 is a vector of the components of the @xmath11 or @xmath13 , @xmath31 is a vector of the values @xmath32 , and @xmath33 is the @xmath34 coefficient matrix ( with @xmath35 for @xmath10 , and @xmath36 in the @xmath12 case ) . we find limits on the components of @xmath30 using monte carlo integration : we sampled @xmath37 random vectors @xmath31 by drawing each components from a normal distribution with a standard deviation chosen such that the values satisfy the confidence level of the limits @xmath32 .",
    "we then solve the equality corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ eq : gamma_linear_combination ] ) : @xmath38 each solution marks a point in the space of the sme coefficients . in this way",
    ", we build the distribution of sme coefficients and find their @xmath39 upper and lower bounds .",
    "the actual coefficient constraints will be published in refs .   and  .",
    "in order to constrain the @xmath13 at the planck scale , time - of - flight measurements of photons with energies of the order of @xmath40 would be necessary,@xcite which is currently not possible .",
    "on the other hand , it may be possible with future gamma - ray instruments to measure gamma - ray polarization at  @xmath41 , which would allow us to constrain the coefficients @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the next step , however , will be to constrain the birefringent coefficients of mass dimension @xmath44 , which currently are not fully constrained.@xcite      d.  colladay and v.a .",
