    "over the years , computation modeling and hydrodynamic calculations of supernova explosions due to core - collapse of massive stars have improved our theoretical understanding of how compact objects form . at present ,",
    "two types of supernovae are actively discussed in the literature : ( i ) after iron is synthesized within a massive star , the core completes its final nuclear burning state .",
    "it then becomes degenerate and keeps growing in mass due to silicon shell burning outside the core .",
    "eventually , it crosses the chandrasekhar mass limit and ensues collapse .",
    "when the core reaches nuclear density , it bounces back and explodes the star as a supernova .",
    "( bethe 1990 ; mezzacappa 2005 ; woosley & bloom 2006 ; kotake et al 2006 ; janka et al .",
    "( ii ) on the other hand , if the core is not massive enough to ignite neon , nuclear burning within the core stops .",
    "the core becomes degenerate due to cooling by neutrino emission . because of carbon shell burning outside the core , the mass of the core approaches the chandrasekhar limit .",
    "when the core density and temperature rise above a certain threshold , electron capture by nuclei ( such as @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and @xmath6 ) takes place , decreasing degenerate electron pressure support . as a result , the core contracts rapidly and eventually bounces back , driving a supernova explosion .",
    "this scenario is referred to as electron capture supernova ( ecs ) ( miyaji et al .",
    "1980 ; nomoto 1987 ) .",
    "although the general idea of ecs has been established for several decades , the mechanism of how electron capture occurs in these relatively less massive cores is not yet settled .",
    "regardless of the supernova mechanism , it is expected that some asymmetries develop during the collapse , imparting a recoil kick to the nascent neutron star ( see harrison et al .",
    "1993 ; frail et al . 1994 ; lyne & loimer 1994 ) .",
    "the observed proper motions of 233 galactic pulsars show that there is a class of neutron stars receiving high recoil velocities at birth ( hobbs et al . 2005 ) . on the other hand , pfahl et al .",
    "( 2002 ) studied the orbital parameters of low eccentric be / x - ray binaries , and pointed out that these neutron stars could only have received low kick velocities ( < 50 km / s ) at the time of formation .",
    "there is thus evidence for the existence of two different neutron star formation mechanisms ( van den heuvel 2004 , 2007 ) , potentially distinguishable by the magnitude of the natal kick of the neutron star .    currently , there are 8 dns observed in our galaxy .",
    "their orbital parameters are summarized in table 1 .",

    "( 2006 ) studied the formation of _ all _ dns except psr j1906 + 0746 , and derived constraints on the natal kick magnitude and progenitor mass of ns2 by studying the orbital dynamics of asymmetric supernova explosions , but not their kinematic history .",
    "the other authors focused on psr b1534 + 12 , psr b1913 + 16 , and psr j0737 - 3039 and used both orbital dynamics of asymmetric supernova explosions and the measured proper motion of these systems to constrain the natal kick magnitude and progenitor mass of ns2 .",
    "the authors traced the motion of the systems in the galaxy backwards in time and assumed each crossing of the binary through the galactic disk within the age of the dns to be a possible birth site of the dns .",
    "however , the backward calculation of the motion in the galaxy requires the knowledge of the radial velocity which can not be measured .",

    "_    in this paper , we avoid the assumption of a present - day radial velocity distribution by carrying out monte carlo simulations of the motion of the observed dns in the galaxy that is forward in time instead of backward . for this purpose ,",
    "we distribute populations of dns progenitors in the galaxy according to a double exponential distribution function .",
    "each system in the populations is assigned a velocity equal to the vector sum of the local galactic rotational velocity and an isotropic kick velocity with a magnitude generated from the kick velocity distribution function , derived from the supernova orbital dynamics constraints for each of the observed systems .",

    ". there may be mass transfer from the primary to the secondary star before that supernova takes place .",
    "as the secondary star leaves the main sequence , wind mass transfer from the secondary to ns1 can occur , leading to the formation of a x - ray binary .",
    "while ns1 is accreting mass from its companion , it is spun up or `` recycled '' , and its spin axis is expected to align with the orbital angular momentum .",
    "later on , the x - ray binary may end up in a common envelope phase , during which ns1 is engulfed by the extended envelope of its companion .",
    "the orbit shrinks and circularizes rapidly due to the frictional forces acting on ns1 as it moves through the envelope of the companion .",
    "the lost orbital energy is deposited into the gas envelope , causing it to become gravitationally unbound and get ejected , leaving behind the companion s bare helium core .",
    "the helium star eventually explodes in a supernova and becomes ns2 , orbiting the recycled , milli - second pulsar ns1 in a compact binary orbit .",
    "mass transfer from the helium star to ns1 can also occur prior to the second supernova explosion .    here",
    ", our goal is to use the current dns binary properties listed in table 1 to constrain as best possible the magnitude of the natal kick and the mass of the progenitor of ns2 in the 8 known dns in our galaxy at the time of the second supernova .",
    "we also predict the unknown radial velocity of each system , as well as the total transverse velocity and ns1 spin tilt angle for those systems where these properties have not been measured yet .",
    "we achieve these goals by means of monte carlo simulations , incorporating orbital dynamics during supernova explosions and kinematic of binaries in the galactic potential , as detailed in what follows .",
    "we start our analysis by deriving a probability distribution function ( pdf ) for the natal kick of ns2 , which depends on the semi - major axis and orbital eccentricity immediately after the second supernova ( @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively ) . as the tidal interaction between two neutron stars in dns is extremely weak ( bildsten & cutler 1992 ) , the major mechanism that changes the orbital semi - major axis and eccentricity of dns is the emission of gravitational waves .",
    "to account for gravitational radiation driven orbital evolution , we use the current observational parameters as initial conditions and integrate equations ( 35 ) and ( 36 ) in junker & schfer ( 1992 ) backwards in time . because of the uncertainty in the true age of the observed dns ( see kiziltan et al .",

    "we use a population of @xmath210@xmath47 in the analysis of psr b1534 + 12 , due to the limiting chance of kicking it to the currently high galactic altitude and simultaneously satisfying the constraints derived from the orbital dynamics of supernova explosions .",
    "if the scale height @xmath44 were larger than 70 pc , it would reduce the difficulty in satisfying the galactic dynamics constraints of psr b1534 + 12 . a smaller population of simulated binaries would then be needed for the analysis of this system .",
    "the initial center - of - mass velocity of the dns is obtained by summing up the kick velocity @xmath48 imparted to the binary center of mass during the second supernova explosion and the local galactic rotational velocity @xmath49 . given the unknown orientation of the binary orbit in the galactic reference frame , the systemic kick velocity @xmath48 is assumed to be distributed isotropically in space .",

    "<S> since the discovery of the first double neutron star ( dns ) system in 1975 by hulse and taylor , there are currently 8 confirmed dns in our galaxy . for every system , the masses of both neutron stars , the orbital semi - major axis and eccentricity are measured , and proper motion is known for half of the systems . using the orbital parameters and kinematic information , if available , as constraints for _ all system _ _ , we investigate the immediate progenitor mass of the second - born neutron star and the magnitude of the supernova kick it received at birth , with the primary goal to understand the core collapse mechanism leading to neutron star formation . </S>",
    "<S> compared to earlier studies , we use a novel method to address the uncertainty related to the unknown radial velocity of the observed systems . for psr b1534 + 12 and psr b1913 + 16 , </S>",
    "<S> the kick magnitudes are 150 - 270 km / s and 190 - 450 km / s ( with 95% confidence ) respectively , and the progenitor masses of the 2nd born neutron stars are 1.3 - 3.4 m@xmath0 and 1.4 - 5.0 m@xmath0 ( 95% ) , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> these suggest that the 2nd born neutron star was formed by an iron core collapse supernova in both systems . for psr j0737 - 3039 , on the other hand , </S>",
    "<S> the kick magnitude is only 5 - 120 km / s ( 95% ) , and the progenitor mass of the 2nd born neutron star is 1.3 - 1.9 m@xmath0 ( 95% ) . because of the relatively low progenitor mass and kick magnitude , the formation of the 2nd born neutron star in psr j0737 - 3039 is potentially connected to an electron capture supernova of a massive @xmath1 white dwarf . for </S>",
    "<S> the remaining 5 galactic dns , the kick magnitude ranges from several tens to several hundreds of km / s , and the progenitor mass of the 2nd formed neutron star can be as low as @xmath21.5 m@xmath0 , or as high as @xmath28 m@xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> therefore in these systems , it is not clear which type of supernova is more likely to form the 2nd neutron star . _ _ _ </S>"
