    "it is well known that thermodynamic and structural properties of polyelectrolyte in homogeneous solutions are mainly determined by the correlation attraction of like - charged particles which are related to long - range coulomb interactions @xcite .",
    "moreover the collective effects in semi - dilute regime of polyelectrolyte solutions resulting from strong fluctuations of monomer concentration , due to the chain structure , play a crucial role @xcite . the necessity to take into account the two effects",
    "simultaneously complicates the theoretical description of the thermodynamics of polyelectrolyte solution in a wide range of monomer concentration and temperature .",
    "it is well known that in salt - free flexible chain polyelectrolyte solutions a liquid - liquid phase separation due to strong correlation attraction can take place .",
    "this effect has been described in several theoretical works @xcite and has also been shown in monte - carlo simulations @xcite . however , to the best of our knowledge theoretical models correctly predicting critical parameters of such a purely electrostatics driven phase transition are still missing .",
    "the reason why theoretical predictions of the critical parameters significantly deviate from results of monte - carlo simulation are three - fold .",
    "firstly , in a series of studies the contribution of the correlation attraction to the total helmholtz free energy has been omitted @xcite or described at the level of debye - hueckel approximation @xcite , although the critical point of the electrostatic phase transition is located far from the range of applicability of a linear debye - hueckel theory @xcite . in work @xcite the contribution of the correlation attraction was described at the level of mean - spherical approximation ( msa ) that allowed to obtain a good agreement with simulation results for critical temperature but underestimated the critical monomer concentration .",
    "secondly , most theoretical approaches @xcite ignore the effects of the monomer concentration fluctuations in the regime of semi - dilute polymer solution .",
    "however , these effects , as was already mentioned above , should be important for solutions of polyelectrolytes as well as for neutral polymers @xcite . in order to evaluate the contribution of the non - electrostatic interactions to the total free energy of the solution the authors usually resort to some mean - field type approximations @xcite where",
    "the fluctuation effects are fully ignored @xcite .",
    "finally , all the above mentioned theoretical models are based on the implicit assumption that contributions of electrostatic and non - electrostatic interactions are independent .",
    "we would like to stress that a methodology based on a @xmath0construction@xmath0 of the total free energy using expressions obtained from different theoretical approaches can not be strictly justified from first principles of statistical thermodynamics .",
    "in reference @xcite addressed an interesting observation that one can obtain reasonable values of the critical parameters if one uses the modified random phase approximation ( mrpa ) for the calculation of the electrostatic contribution into the free energy of the solution .",
    "mrpa was developed in works @xcite and in contrast to the standard random phase approximation ( rpa ) contains a concept of ultraviolet cut - off in the procedure of integration over vectors of reciprocal space .",
    "the parameter of ultraviolet cut - off determined from the condition of equality between number of degrees of freedom of the system and number of collective variables which contribute into the total free energy enumerated by elements of reciprocal space .",
    "therefore , the cut - off parameter within mrpa is related to the number density of particles .",
    "it is surprising that mrpa allows one to obtain very accurate interpolation formulas for excess free energy of one component plasma ( ocp ) and hard - core one component plasma ( hcocp ) in a wide range of temperatures and number densities  from regime of linear debye - hueckel theory to the strong coupling regime @xcite .    in work",
    "@xcite in the framework of a field - theoretical approach the interpolation formulas for excess free energy , correlation length , and effective kuhn length of the segment of polymer chain for semi - dilute solution of neutral polymer chains were obtained .",
    "it should be emphasized , that the interpolation formulas obtained by authors contain all limiting laws predicted in earlier works within the scaling approach @xcite . using the widely used carnahan - starling interpolation formula for the free energy of a hard sphere system and the interpolation formula for excess free energy of semi - dilute polymer solution mentioned above @xcite offer now new opportunities for theoretical description of more complicated polymer systems in the framework of thermodynamic perturbation theory ( tpt ) .    the presented observation in reference @xcite and results proposed in reference @xcite motivated our attempt to develop a statistical theory of salt - free polyelectrolyte solutions which would simultaneously take into account the effect of correlation attractions of charged monomers and counterions beyond the linear debye - hueckel theory as well as the collective effects related to the monomer concentration fluctuations in the semi - dilute regime .",
    "we formulate the theoretical model based on a variant of tpt formalism , which has been developed in works @xcite . as the reference system",
    "we have chosen a set of two independent subsystems  charged polymer chains immersed in a structureless oppositely charged background created by counterions ( polymer one component plasma ) and counterions ( which we model as charged hard spheres ) immersed in oppositely charged background created by polymer chains ( hard - core one component plasma ) .",
    "we calculate the excess free energy of the polymer one component plasma in the framework of mrpa .",
    "we show that our theory is in a very good agreement with monte - carlo simulations results reproducing critical parameters of the electrostatic phase transition and md simulation results reproducing the osmotic pressure as a function of monomer concentration in a region that is above the critical point , respectively .",
    "in this section we present the theoretical model based on the tpt formalism for the thermodynamics of a salt - free flexible chain polyelectrolyte solution .",
    "the system contains charged polymer chain and counterions , where we assume that the charged polymer chain is immersed in a good solvent modelled by a structureless dielectric medium with the dielectric permittivity @xmath1 .    moreover , we take into account an excluded volume of monomers and counterions modeling them as hard spheres of diameter @xmath2 . for simplicity",
    "we also assume that each monomer has a fixed charge @xmath3 , whereas the counterions carry an opposite charge @xmath4 ( monovalent counterions ) .",
    "thus the free energy of the solution within the canonical ensemble is @xmath5 where the partition function @xmath6 takes the form @xmath7 with @xmath8 being the hamiltonian of the system , where the following short - hand notations have been introduced @xmath9 @xmath10 is the coulomb potential , @xmath11 is the microscopic charge density of the monomers , @xmath12 is the microscopic charge density of the counterions , @xmath13 is the hamiltonian of the monomer - monomer excluded volume interaction ; @xmath14 is the second virial coefficient of the excluded volume interaction of hard spheres of diameter @xmath2 ; @xmath15 is a reciprocal temperature , @xmath16 is boltzmann constant , @xmath17 is the hamiltonian of counterion - counterion excluded volume interaction ; @xmath18 is the hard - core potential , @xmath19 is the hamiltonian of counterion - monomer excluded volume interaction .",
    "moreover , integration measure over the configurations of polymer chains has been introduced : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the kuhn length of the segment , @xmath22 is the number of polymer chains with @xmath23 as the degree of polymerization ; @xmath24 is the integration measure over the phase space of counterions , @xmath25 is the total number of counterions , in the system of volume @xmath26 .",
    "the symbol @xmath27 in ( [ int_conf_pol ] ) denotes a functional integration over the polymer chain configurations .",
    "moreover , the following normalization condition must hold @xmath28 in order to take into account a monomer - counterion excluded volume interaction we use an assumption @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 @xmath32 .",
    "the approximation ( [ deplit ] ) is a simplest way to include into the theory depletion effect @xcite .",
    "the symbol @xmath33 in ( [ eq : dgamma_p ] ) denotes that an integration performed over the free volume for counterions @xmath34 . in the renormalized measure @xmath35 we have the following normalization condition @xmath36      adopting the notation pocp for the polymer one component plasma and hcocp for the hard - core one component plasma , the model hamiltonian ( [ eq : h ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a hamiltonian of polymer one component plasma ( pocp ) , @xmath39 is a hamiltonian of hard - core one component plasma ( hcocp ) ; @xmath40 is a perturbation part of the total hamiltonian ; @xmath41 is an average charge density of counterions , @xmath42 is a free volume for counterions ( monomers ) , @xmath43 is an average charge density of monomers , @xmath44 is a local charge density fluctuation of monomers , @xmath45 is a local charge density fluctuation of counterions .",
    "we would like to stress that a set of charged flexible polymer chains immersed in a structureless neutralizing background we shall call throughout the paper as polymer one component plasma ( pocp ) . using the formalism of tpt we shall use a set of two independent ideal subsystems as a reference system  pocp of charged macromolecules and hcocp of counterions . using the tpt formalism for the two independent ideal subsystems as a reference system ,",
    "we obtain @xmath46 where symbol @xmath47 denotes an averaging over microstates of the reference system @xcite @xmath48 the partition function of the reference system is then given by @xmath49.\\ ] ] @xmath50 is a hamiltonian of the reference system .",
    "thus an expression for the total helmholtz free energy @xmath51 within the tpt approach has a following form @xmath52      the expression for density of excess free energy of hcocp has a following form @xcite @xmath53-\\nonumber\\ ] ] @xmath54 where @xmath55 is a plasma parameter , @xmath56 is packing fraction of counterions , @xmath57 is a renormalized concentration of monomers ( counterions ) , @xmath58 is a bjerrum length , @xmath59 is concentration of monomers ( counterions ) , and @xmath60 is a number constant .",
    "moreover , the following notations have been introduced @xmath61 @xmath62 the equation ( [ eq : f_hcocp ] ) very accurate describes the thermodynamic properties of hcocp in wide ranges of number density and temperature  from range of applicability of debye - hueckel theory to strong coupling regime @xcite . applying an analogous approach to calculation of free energy of pocp as well as for hcocp @xcite , we arrive at the following expression ( see appendix a ) : @xmath63 where the correlation contribution into the free energy of pocp can be determined by the expression @xmath64 where @xmath65 @xmath66 @xmath67 @xmath68 , @xmath69 is a plasma parameter of monomers , @xmath70 is a dimensionless parameter .",
    "the non - electrostatic part @xmath71 of the excess free energy of pocp can be determined by the expression which obtained by edwards and muthukumar within a field - theoretical approach @xcite : @xmath72 where correlation length @xmath73 takes the form @xmath74 and expansion factor @xmath75 of neutral polymer chain satisfies the following equation @xmath76    the system of coupled equations ( [ eq : fv ] ) , ( [ eq : xi ] ) and ( [ eq : alpha ] ) determines the density of free energy of solution of flexible polymer chains with excluded volume and qualitatively describes thermodynamic properties of the solution in the case of good solvent from regime of semi - dilute polymer solution to concentrated regime @xcite .",
    "further , let us calculate the fluctuation correction to the free energy of the reference system at the level of the gaussian approximation .",
    "using the standard hubbard - stratonovich transformation we rewrite the partition function of the solution in the following form @xmath77 where @xmath78 @xmath79 is a vector of auxiliary fields , @xmath80 is a vector of local charge density fluctuations .",
    "moreover , the additional notations have been introduced @xmath81 and @xmath82 an operator @xmath83 can be determined by the following integral relation @xmath84 performing some cumbersome calculations ( see appendix b ) we arrive at the expression @xmath85 where the perturbation part of the total density of free energy of the solution at the level of gaussian approximation takes the form @xmath86 where @xmath87 is a fourier image of coulomb potential , @xmath88 is a fourier image of correlation function of microscopic charge density fluctuations of pocp , and @xmath89 is a fourier image of correlation function of microscopic charge density fluctuations of hcocp . the latter has been obtained within the gaussian approximation in work @xcite and can be written in the following form @xmath90 the corresponding expression for pocp also obtained within gaussian approximation ( see appendix a ) has a following form @xmath91 where @xmath92 is a well known expression for the structure factor of semi - dilute polymer solution @xcite .    substituting ( [ eq : cor1 ] ) and ( [ eq : cor2 ] ) into ( [ eq : pert ] ) and calculating integral we arrive at @xmath93 where @xmath94 , @xmath95 , and function @xmath96 has a form @xmath97 @xmath98      the expression ( [ eq : f_ex ] ) in combination with expressions ( [ eq : f_hcocp]-[eq : pocp1 ] ) and ( [ eq : pert2]-[eq : g(u , v ) ] ) defines the excess free energy of salt - free polyelectrolyte solution in the limit of infinitely long polymer chains ( @xmath99 ) which taking into account the correlation attraction of charged particles , monomer concentration fluctuations in the regime of semi - dilute solution and mutual influence of the latter effects . it should be noted that the contributions of electrostatic and non - electrostatic interactions are not independent .",
    "the osmotic pressure can be obtained by standard way @xmath100 where @xmath101 is an ideal part of the osmotic pressure and @xmath102 is an excess osmotic pressure of the solution .",
    "turning to the numerical calculation we introduce the dimensionless monomer concentration @xmath103 , temperature @xmath104 , and the second virial coefficient @xmath105 .",
    "in addition we assume that @xmath106 . moreover , we determine the dimensionless osmotic pressure @xmath107 .",
    "fig.1 shows the osmotic pressure as a function of monomer concentration for two temperatures @xmath108 . at sufficiently low temperatures",
    "the appearance of a van - der - waals loop indicates a liquid - liquid phase separation in the solution . using the equality between chemical potentials and the osmotic pressures of coexisting phases",
    "we obtain a coexistence curve of the liquid - liquid phase separation with an upper critical point ( see fig.2 ) .",
    "the obtained coexistence curve exhibits a highly asymmetric shape , which is in agreement with monte - carlo computer simulation results by @xcite .",
    "fig.2 also shows for comparison the values of the critical points obtained within different theories ( including the present theory ) and monte - carlo computer simulations .",
    "the values of the critical parameters obtained by extrapolation of simulation results for @xmath109 in the work @xcite are : @xmath110 and @xmath111 .",
    "the muthukumar theory @xcite sufficiently underestimates both critical parameters : @xmath112 .",
    "the theory developed by jiang and co - authors @xcite based on msa , as has already been mentioned in the introduction predicts the critical temperature in close agreement with simulation results but underestimates the critical monomer concentration : @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "the present theory yields the critical parameters @xmath110 and @xmath115 which are in close agreement with monte - carlo simulation results .",
    "it is instructive to regard how our theory can describe the thermodynamic properties of polyelectrolyte solution in the region above the critical point .",
    "3 shows the comparison between the dependencies of the osmotic pressure on monomer concentration calculated within present theory and within md simulation at @xmath116 in wide range of monomer concentration @xcite . as seen from fig .",
    "3 , our theory gives very good agreement with the results of md simulation .",
    "also our results are in very good agreement with a numerical calculation within prism theory @xcite . it should be noted , that two qualitatively different regimes of the osmotic pressure behavior take place . at a region of the small monomer concentration where the entropy of the mobile counterions gives a basic contribution into the osmotic pressure there is a linear dependence on monomer concentration ( @xmath117 ) , whereas in concentrated regime we observe an essentially nonlinear behavior ( @xmath118 ) .",
    "the predicted scaling law has been also obtained within a monte - carlo simulation @xcite and numerical calculations based on prism theory @xcite .",
    "we have presented a first - principle statistical theory of salt - free flexible chain polyelectrolyte solutions in the regime of a good solvent .",
    "the approach is based on the thermodynamic perturbation theory formalism and predicts a liquid - liquid phase separation arising from strong correlation attraction of charged particles .",
    "taking into account the correlation attraction of charged particles beyond the linear debye - hueckel theory and strongly correlated monomer concentration fluctuations in the regime of semi - dilute polymer solution we have developed an equation of state for the salt - free polyelectrolyte solution that accurately predicts the critical parameters of the liquid - liquid phase separation and the osmotic pressure in a wide range of monomer concentrations in the region above the critical point .",
    "we would like to stress that our theory provides accurate values of the critical parameters without the concept of charge renormalization ( e.g. counterion condensation ) .",
    "as is well known , the counterion condensation is an essentially nonlinear effect @xcite that can not be described within the linear debye - hueckel type of theory .",
    "however , our theoretical model going beyond the simple linear theory , implicitly takes into account the effect of charge renormalization .",
    "a limitation of the presented theoretical model is related to the fact that it can be applied only to polyelectrolyte solution of sufficiently long polymer chains ( i.e. , in a case @xmath109 ) . however , as was shown in theoretical works @xcite and confirmed by monte - carlo and md simulations in references @xcite the degree of polymerization of the polyelectrolyte chains has only a weak effect on the thermodynamic properties of salt - free solution .",
    "in other words , if the degree of polymerization is higher than @xmath119 , the thermodynamic quantities of polyelectrolyte solution in the regime of semi - dilute solution only weakly depend on the length of the polymer chains .",
    "the obtained accurate equation of state can be applied to compute thermodynamic properties of polyelectrolyte solutions with a low concentration of low - molecular weight salts using the ionic strength as a small parameter of perturbation within the thermodynamic perturbation theory @xcite .",
    "in addition , the obtained equation of state can be used to describe inhomogeneous polyelectrolyte solutions within the classical density functional theory . replacing the equation of state of the simple one - component plasma @xcite by the equation of state into the free energy functional instead of allowing to adequately take into account the contribution of the correlation attraction .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to speculate about the reasons why a set of two independent one - component plasmas can be used for theoretical description of thermodynamics of salt - free polyelectrolyte solution near the critical point . as was predicted in the reference @xcite and confirmed by monte - carlo simulation in work @xcite , due to the strong correlation attraction the charged macromolecules near the critical point form a network of polyelectrolyte aggregates .",
    "thus , in this case the charged network can be regarded as a weakly fluctuating background neutralizing the charge of counterions , whereas the mobile counterions immersed in the polymer network can be regarded as a neutralizing background for charged macromolecules .",
    "thus , in order to evaluate the contribution of the remaining effects that are related to the fluctuations of charge densities of the neutralizing backgrounds which undergo only slight fluctuations the gaussian approximation can be applied .    in conclusion",
    "we would like to estimate the critical parameters in physical units for the real experimental systems .",
    "we take the following parametes for the polyelectrolyte and counterions @xmath120 which approximately corresponding to sodium polystyrene - sulfonate . as an example of polar solvents , where the discussed liquid - liquid phase transition can take place , we take n , n - dimethylformamide ( @xmath121 ) and acetonitrile ( @xmath122 ) . for n , n - dimethylformamide",
    "we obtain the following value of the critical temperature @xmath123 . for acetonitrile",
    "we get @xmath124 . the critical concentration in both cases @xmath125 .",
    "thus this purely electrostatic liquid - liquid phase transition can be realized at experimentally accessible conditions .",
    "this research has received funding from the european union s seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) under grant agreement no 247500 with project acronym `` biosol '' .",
    "this work was supported by grant from the president of the rf ( no mk-2823.2015.3 ) and by grant from russian foundation for basic research ( no 15 - 43 - 03195 ) .",
    "in this appendix we derive the expressions for the excess free energy ( [ eq : pocpcor ] ) and the correlation function of the charge density fluctuations ( [ eq : cor2 ] ) of pocp .    starting from the partition function of pocp @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the monomer - monomer excluded volume interaction part of the total hamiltonian",

    "we now turn to the calculate the partition function ( [ eq : zscocp ] ) in the framework of tpt formalism which was proposed in the reference @xcite choosing as a reference system a set of neutral polymer chains with excluded volume interactions . as announced in the main text of the article we are making use of the interpolation formula for the free energy of such system that takes into account the effect of strongly correlated monomer concentration fluctuations in regime of semi - dilute polymer solution @xcite .",

    "have been introduced .",

    "we shall use the following approximation for the structure factor of the semi - dilute polymer solution @xmath148 where the following approximate expression for correlation radius has been used @xmath149 the evaluation ( [ eq : xi2 ] ) follows from the equation ( [ eq : xi ] ) for the case of the semi - dilute polymer solution .",
    "the expansion factor @xmath75 of the neutral polymer chain in the case of semi - dilute polymer solution as follows from ( [ eq : alpha ] ) can be evaluated as @xmath150 , so that evaluation of the correlation radius takes the form @xmath151 that is in agreement with the well - known scaling result @xcite .",
    "further , following the idea proposed in the references @xcite we introduce an ultraviolet cut - off in the integral over the wave vectors @xmath152 in ( [ eq : zpocp ] ) . in order to obtain the cut - off parameter @xmath153",
    ", we assume that total number of collective variables @xmath154 which contribute to the total free energy of the pocp is equal to the total number of degrees of freedom of pocp , i.e. @xmath155 .",
    "therefore , we arrive at the following relation @xmath156 from which we obtain the expression for cut - off parameter @xmath157 the prefactor @xmath158 on the left - hand side of ( [ eq : cut - off ] ) originates from the summation ( integration ) of both the real and the imaginary parts of the collective variable @xmath154 .",
