    "relativistic fluid dynamics finds applications in cosmology , astrophysics , and the physics of high - energy heavy - ion collisions . in cosmology and certain areas of astrophysics",
    ", one needs a fluid dynamics formulation consistent with the general theory of relativity @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "a formulation based on the special theory of relativity is quite adequate to treat the evolution of the strongly interacting matter formed in high - energy heavy - ion collisions when it is close to a local thermodynamic equilibrium .",
    "the correct formulation of the relativistic dissipative fluid dynamics is far from settled and is currently under intense investigation @xcite .    in applications of fluid dynamics",
    "it is natural to first employ the zeroth order ( in gradients of the hydrodynamic four - velocity , for example ) or ideal fluid dynamics .",
    "however , as all fluids are dissipative in nature due to the uncertainty principle @xcite , the ideal fluid results serve only as a benchmark when dissipative effects become important .",
    "the first - order dissipative fluid dynamics or the relativistic navier - stokes ( ns ) theory @xcite involves parabolic differential equations and suffers from acausality and instability .",
    "the second - order israel - stewart ( is ) theory @xcite , with its hyperbolic equations restores causality but may not guarantee stability @xcite .",
    "the second - order viscous hydrodynamics has been quite successful in explaining the spectra and azimuthal anisotropy of particles produced in heavy - ion collisions at the relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) @xcite and recently at the large hadron collider ( lhc ) @xcite .",
    "however , is theory can lead to unphysical effects such as reheating of the expanding medium @xcite and to a negative pressure @xcite at large viscosity indicating its breakdown .",
    "furthermore , from comparison to the transport theory it was demonstrated @xcite that is approach becomes marginal when the shear viscosity to entropy density ratio @xmath0 . with this motivation",
    ", the dissipative hydrodynamic equations were extended @xcite to third order , which led to an improved agreement with the kinetic theory even for moderately large values of @xmath1 .",
    "it is well known that the approach based on the generalized second law of thermodynamics fails to capture all the terms in the evolution equations of the dissipative quantities when compared with similar equations derived from transport theory @xcite .",
    "it was pointed out that using directly the definitions of the dissipative currents , instead of the second moment of the boltzmann equation as in is theory , one obtains identical equations of motion but with different coefficients @xcite .",
    "recently , it has been shown @xcite that a generalization of grad s 14-moment method @xcite results in additional terms in the dissipative equations .",
    "it is important to note that all formulations that employ the boltzmann equation make a strict assumption of a local collision term in the configuration space @xcite . in other words , within an infinitesimal fluid element containing a large number of particles and extending over many interparticle spacings @xcite , the different collisions that increase or decrease the number of particles with a given momentum @xmath2 are all assumed to occur at the same point @xmath3 .",
    "this makes the collision integral a purely local functional of the single - particle phase - space distribution function @xmath4 independent of the derivatives @xmath5 . in kinetic theory",
    ", @xmath4 is assumed to vary slowly over space - time , i.e. , it changes negligibly over the range of interparticle interaction @xcite .",
    "however , its variation over the fluid element may not be insignificant ; see fig .",
    "inclusion of the gradients of @xmath4 in the collision term will affect the evolution of dissipative quantities and thus the entire dynamics of the system .    in this letter",
    ", we shall provide a new formal derivation of the dissipative hydrodynamic equations within kinetic theory but using a nonlocal collision term in the boltzmann equation .",
    "we obtain new second - order terms and show that the coefficients of the other terms are altered .",
    "these modifications do have a rather strong influence on the evolution of the viscous medium as we shall demonstrate in the case of one - dimensional scaling expansion .",
    "our starting point is the relativistic boltzmann equation for the evolution of the phase - space distribution function , @xmath6 $ ] , where the collision term @xmath7 $ ] is required to be consistent with the energy - momentum and current conservation .",
    "traditionally @xmath7 $ ] is also assumed to be a purely local functional of @xmath4 , independent of @xmath8 .",
    "this locality assumption is a powerful restriction @xcite which we relax by including the gradients of @xmath4 in @xmath7 $ ] .",
    "this necessarily leads to the modified boltzmann equation @xmath9   =   c[f ] + \\partial_\\mu(a^\\mu f ) + \\partial_\\mu\\partial_\\nu(b^{\\mu\\nu}f ) + \\cdots,\\ ] ] where @xmath10 and @xmath11 depend on the type of the collisions ( @xmath12 ) .",

    "w_{pp ' \\to kk ' } \\nonumber \\\\ & & \\times ( f_k f_{k ' } \\tilde f_p \\tilde f_{p ' } - f_p f_{p ' } \\tilde f_k \\tilde f_{k'}),\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath15 is the collisional transition rate , @xmath16 and @xmath17 with @xmath18 for fermi , bose , and boltzmann gas , and @xmath19 $ ] , @xmath20 and @xmath21 being the degeneracy factor and particle rest mass .",
    "the first and second terms in eq .",
    "( [ coll ] ) refer to the processes @xmath22 and @xmath23 , respectively .",
    "these processes are traditionally assumed to occur at the same space - time point @xmath3 with an underlying assumption that @xmath4 is constant not only over the range of interparticle interaction but also over the entire infinitesimal fluid element of size @xmath24 , which is large compared to the average interparticle separation @xcite ; see fig .",
    "[ flel ] . equation ( 1 ) together with this crucial assumption has been used to derive the standard second - order dissipative hydrodynamic equations @xcite .",
    "we , however , emphasize that the space - time points at which the above two kinds of processes occur should be separated by an interval @xmath25 within the volume @xmath26 .",
    "it may be noted that the large number of particles within @xmath26 collide among themselves with various separations @xmath27 .",
    "further , @xmath27 is independent of the arbitrary point @xmath3 at which the boltzmann equation is considered , and is a function of @xmath28 . of course",

    "moreover , the arbitrariness in @xmath27 requires that these conditions be satisfied at each order in @xmath27 . retaining terms",
    "up to second order in derivatives leads to three constraint equations for the coefficients ( @xmath67 ) , namely @xmath68 , @xmath69 where we define @xmath70 .",

    "( [ diss ] ) : @xmath83 the  8 terms \" ( `` 9 terms '' ) involve second - order , linear scalar ( vector ) combinations of derivatives of @xmath84 . all the terms in the above equations are inequivalent , i.e. , none can be expressed as a combination of others via equations of motion @xcite .",
    "all the coefficients in eqs .",
    "( [ bulk])-([shear ] ) are obtained as functions of hydrodynamic variables .",
    "for example , some of the transport coefficients related to shear are @xmath85 ,   \\nonumber\\\\    \\beta_\\pi = \\ ; & \\frac{4}{5}p + \\frac{1}{15}(\\epsilon-3p ) - \\frac{m^4}{15}\\left<(u.p)^{-2}\\right>_0,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath86 . the rest of the coefficients will be given in @xcite .    retaining only the first - order terms in eqs .",
    "( [ bulk])-([shear ] ) , and using dkr values of bulk viscosity @xmath87 , thermal conductivity @xmath88 and shear viscosity @xmath89 , we get the modified first - order equations for bulk pressure @xmath90 , heat current @xmath91 and shear stress tensor @xmath92 .",
    "thus the nonlocal collision term modifies even the first - order dissipative equations .",
    "this constitutes one of the main results in the present study .",
    "if @xmath93 and @xmath94 are all set to zero , eqs .",
    "( [ bulk])-([shear ] ) reduce to those obtained by dkr @xcite with the same coefficients .",
    "otherwise coefficients of all the terms occurring in the dkr equations get modified .",
    "furthermore , our derivation results in new terms , for instance those with coefficients @xmath95 , @xmath96 , ( @xmath97 ) , which are absent in @xcite as well as in the standard israel - stewart approach @xcite .",
    "hence these terms have also been missed so far in the numerical studies of heavy - ion collisions in the hydrodynamic framework @xcite .",
    "indeed eqs .",
    "( [ bulk])-([shear ] ) contain all possible second - order terms allowed by symmetry considerations @xcite .",
    "this is a consequence of the nonlocality of the collision term @xmath65 $ ] .",
    "however , we note that a generalization of the 14-moment approximation is also able to generate all these terms as shown recently in ref .",
    "to demonstrate the numerical significance of the new dissipative equations derived here , we consider evolution of a massless boltzmann gas , with equation of state @xmath98 , at vanishing net baryon number density in the bjorken model @xcite .",
    "the new terms , namely @xmath99 , @xmath100 , @xmath101 , @xmath102 , @xmath103 and @xmath104 containing acceleration and vorticity do not contribute in this case .",
    "however , they are expected to play an important role in the full 3d viscous hydrodynamics .    in terms of the coordinates ( @xmath105 ) where @xmath106 and @xmath107 , the initial four - velocity becomes @xmath108 . in this scenario @xmath109 and the equation for @xmath110 reduces to @xmath111 where the coefficients are @xmath112 for comparison we quote the is results @xcite : @xmath113 .",
    "the coupled differential equations ( [ evol ] ) , ( [ param ] ) and ( [ bjpi ] ) are solved simultaneously for a variety of initial conditions : temperature @xmath114 or 500 mev corresponding to typical rhic and lhc energies , and shear pressure @xmath115 or @xmath116 corresponding to isotropic and anisotropic pressure configurations . since the nonlocal effects embodied in the taylor expansion ( [ mbe ] ) are not large , the initial @xmath117 are so constrained that the corrections to first - order and second - order terms remain small ; recall also the additional constraints @xmath72 and eq .",
    "( [ param ] ) .",
    "figure 2(a ) illustrates the evolution of these quantities for a choice of initial conditions .",
    "@xmath118 decreases monotonically to the crossover temperature @xmath119 mev at time @xmath120 fm / c , which is consistent with the expected lifetime of quark - gluon plasma .",
    "parameter @xmath121 is constant whereas @xmath122 and @xmath94 vary smoothly and tend to zero at large times indicating reduced but still significant presence of nonlocal effects in the collision term at late times .",
    "this is also evident in fig .",
    "2(b ) where the pressure anisotropy @xmath123 shows marked deviation from is , controlled mainly by @xmath121 .",
    "at late times @xmath124 is largely unaffected by the choice of initial values of @xmath125 .",
    "although the shear pressure @xmath126 vanishes rapidly indicating approach to ideal fluid dynamics , the @xmath124 is far from unity .",
    "faster isotropization for initial @xmath127 may be attributed to a smaller effective shear viscosity @xmath128 in the modified ns equation , and conversely .",
    "figure 2(b ) also indicates the convergence of the taylor expansion that led to eq .",
    "( [ mbe ] ) .",
    "figure 3 shows the evolution of @xmath124 for isotropic initial pressure configuration , at various @xmath1 for the lhc energy regime .",
    "compared to is , dkr leads to larger pressure anisotropy .",
    "further , with small initial corrections ( @xmath129% to first - order and @xmath130% to the second - order terms ) due to @xmath131 , the nonlocal hydrodynamics ( solid lines ) exhibits appreciable deviation from the ( local ) dkr theory .",
    "the above results clearly demonstrate the importance of the nonlocal effects , which should be incorporated in transport calculations as well .",
    "comparison of nonlocal hydrodynamics to nonlocal transport theory would be illuminating .    in a realistic 2 + 1 or 3 + 1 d calculation , one has to choose the thermalization time and the freeze - out temperature together with suitable initial conditions for hydrodynamic velocity , energy density , shear pressure as well as for the nonlocal coefficients @xmath132 to fit @xmath133 and @xmath134 spectra of hadrons , and then predict , for example , the anisotropic flow @xmath135 for a given @xmath1 .",
    "nonlocal effects ( especially via @xmath121 ) will affect the extraction of @xmath1 from fits to the measured @xmath135 .",
    "it may also be noted that although ( local ) viscous hydrodynamics explains the gross features of @xmath136 and @xmath137 spectra for the ( 0 - 5)% most central pb - pb collisions at @xmath138 tev , it strongly disagrees with the measured @xmath139 spectrum @xcite . further the constituent quark number scaling violation has been observed in the @xmath140 and @xmath141 data for @xmath139 , at this lhc energy @xcite .",
    "the above discrepancies may be attributed partly to the nonlocal effects which can have different implications for two- and three - particle correlations and thus affect the meson and baryon spectra differently .",
    "to summarize , we have presented a new derivation of the relativistic dissipative hydrodynamic equations by introducing a nonlocal generalization of the collision term in the boltzmann equation .",
    "the first - order and second - order equations are modified : new terms occur and coefficients of others are altered . while it is well known that the derivation based on the generalized second law of thermodynamics misses some terms in the second - order equations , we have shown that the standard derivation based on kinetic theory and 14-moment approximation also misses other terms .",
    "the method presented here is able to generate all possible terms to a given order that are allowed by symmetry .",
    "it can also be extended to derive third - order hydrodynamic equations .",
