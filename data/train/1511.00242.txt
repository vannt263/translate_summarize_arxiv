    "the lattice boltzmann method ( lbm ) has become a popular numerical tool for flow simulations .",
    "it solves the discrete velocity boltzmann equation ( dvbe ) with sophistically chosen discrete velocity set . with the coupled discretization of velocity space and spatial space ,",
    "the numerical treatment of convection term reduces to a very simple _ streaming _ processes , which provides the benefits of low numerical dissipation , easy implementation , and high parallel computing efficiency .",
    "another advantage of lbm is that , the simplified collision term is computed implicitly while implemented explicitly , which allows for a large time step even though the collision term causess stiffness at a small relaxation time .",
    "this advantage makes the lbm a potential solver for high reynolds number flows .",
    "however , the coupled discretization of velocity and spatial spaces limits the lbm to the use of uniform cartesian meshes , which prohibits its applications for practical engineering problems .",
    "some efforts have been made to extend the standard lbm to non - regular ( non - uniform , unstructured ) meshes , and a number of so called off - lattice boltzmann ( olb ) methods have been developed by solving the dvbe using certain finite - difference , finite - volume , or finite - element schemes  @xcite .",
    "these olb schemes differ from each other in the temporal and spatial discretizations .",
    "however , a straightforward implementation of the cfd techniques usually leads to the loss of the advantages of standard lbm , especially the low dissipation property and stability at large time step .",
    "for example , in many of the schemes  @xcite , the time step is limited by the relaxation time to get an accurate solution , even as the collision term is computed implicitly  @xcite .",
    "this drawback makes these olb schemes very computational expensive when simulating high reynolds number flows .",
    "an alternative way to construct olb schemes is to use the time - splitting strategy in solving the dvbe  @xcite , in which the dvbe is decomposed into a collision sub - equation and a followed pure advection sub - equation .",
    "the collision sub - equation is fully local and is discretized directly , leading to a collision step the same as the standard lbm ; the collisionless advection subequation is then solved with certain numerical schemes on uniform or non - uniform meshes  @xcite , leading to a general streaming step . specifically , the scheme proposed by bardow et  al .",
    "( denoted by bkg ) , which combines the variable transformation technique for the collision term and the lax - wendroff scheme for the streaming step , overcomes the time step restriction by the relaxation time .",
    "it was demonstrated that accurate and stable solutions can be obtained even as the time step is much larger than the relaxation time  @xcite .",
    "the above olb schemes are developed in the lbm framework , and are limited to continuum flows .",
    "recently , a finite volume kinetic approach using general mesh , i.e. , discrete unified gas kinetic scheme ( dugks ) , was proposed for all knudsen number flows  @xcite . in the dugks the numerical flux",
    "is constructed based on the governing equation i.e. , the dvbe itself , instead of using interpolations .",
    "with such a treatment , the time step is not restricted by the relaxation time , and its superior accuracy and stability for high reynolds continuum flows have been demonstrated  @xcite .    since both the bkg and the dugks methods overcome the time step restriction from different approaches , it is still not clear the performance difference between them , so in this work we will present a comparative study of these two kinetic schemes for continuum flows , even the dugks is not limited to such flows",
    "we will also investigate the link between the two schemes by comparing them in the same finite volume framework .",

    "we now analyse the differences between the dugks and the bkg scheme in finite - volume formulation .",
    "this is achieved by analyzing accuracy of the reconstructed distribution function at the cell interface center .",

    "on the other hand , if we apply trapezoidal rule to the quadrature , we get eq .  ,",
    "i.e. , the reconstructed cell - interface distribution functions in the dugks .",
    "so , in both the dugks and the bkg methods , the flux is determined from the local characteristic solution of the dvbe , and the convection and collision effects are considered simultaneously .",
    "we also indicate that , for those fv / fd schemes that use the simple central difference  @xcite or upwind  @xcite schemes of traditional cfd methods , the corresponding cell - interface distribution functions are @xmath75 and @xmath76 where the collision effect is totally ignored .",
    "the effects of the different treatments of the integration of the collision term in eq .   can be analyzed by using the chapman - enskog expansion method  @xcite . by approximating the distribution function by its first - order chapman - enskog solution , @xmath77 with @xmath78 , we have @xmath79 therefore , for continuous flows where @xmath80 , the distribution function at the cell interface reconstructed in either the bkg or the dugks method is a second - order approximation of the exact one . furthermore , with the trapezoidal rule for the collision term",
    ", the dugks is expected to be more accurate than the bkg method which uses a lower order explicit rule . in regions with large velocity gradients , where the collision effect or @xmath81 is important",
    ", the bkg scheme may yield significant error .",
    "more importantly , as the dugks employs an implicit treatment of the collision term in the evaluation of numerical flux , it is expected to be more stable than the bkg scheme .",
    "finally , we shall remark that if the distribution functions at cell interfaces are obtained by direct interpolations , i.e. , neglecting the integral of the collision term in eq .  , the leading error of the approximation is @xmath82 . as the integral of @xmath83 on right hand side of eq",
    ".   contributes to the diffusive flux , the lack of the collision term is equivalent to introduce a numerical viscosity proportional to @xmath84  @xcite .",
    "this explains why many other fv based lattice boltzmann schemes have to keep the time step much smaller than the collision time to obtain accurate results .",
    "in this subsection , we briefly mention the implementation of no - slip boundary condition for the bkg scheme and dugks methods , the basic idea here is to mimic the half - way bounce - back rule of the standard lbm  @xcite by reversing the dfs at boundary faces at middle time steps .",

    "the numerical results of three test cases , including unsteady and steady flows , confirm that the the dugks is more accurate and stable than the bkg scheme on the same computing configurations , especially for high reynolds number flows .",
    "it is also observed that the dugks is stable as long as @xmath0 , while the bkg scheme s stability degrades quickly as the cfl number goes beyond 0.5 .",
    "we attribute this to the implicit treatment of the collision term of the dugks when evaluating the numerical flux .",
    "furthermore , the results show that the dugks is more insensitive to mesh resolutions than the bkg method .",
    "numerical results also demonstrate that the bkg scheme is about one time faster than the dugks on a same mesh .",
    "however , it should be noted that the latter can achieve an accurate solution with a much finer mesh , suggesting that it can be more efficient for flow computations than the bgk scheme . in summary ,",
    "the theoretical analysis and numerical results demonstrate that the dugks can serve as an efficient method for simulating continuum flows , although it is not limited to such flow regime .",

    "<S> ,  @xcite and the discrete unified gas kinetic scheme ( dugks )  @xcite are two methods that successfully overcome the time step restriction by the collision time , which is commonly seen in many other kinetic schemes . basically , the bkg scheme is a time splitting scheme , while the dugks is an un - split finite volume scheme . in this work , </S>",
    "<S> we first perform a theoretical analysis of the two schemes in the finite volume framework by comparing their numerical flux evaluations . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that the effects of collision term are considered in the reconstructions of the cell - interface distribution function in both schemes , which explains why they can overcome the time step restriction and can give accurate results even as the time step is much larger than the collision time . </S>",
    "<S> the difference between the two schemes lies in the treatment of the integral of the collision term , in which the bardow s scheme uses the rectangular rule while the dugks uses the trapezoidal rule . </S>",
    "<S> the performance of the two schemes , i.e. , accuracy , stability , and efficiency are then compared by simulating several two dimensional flows , including the unsteady taylor - green vortex flow , the steady lid - driven cavity flow , and the laminar boundary layer problem . </S>",
    "<S> it is observed that , the dugks can give more accurate results than the bkg scheme . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , the numerical stability of the bkg scheme decreases as the courant - friedrichs - lewy ( cfl ) number approaches to 1 , while the stability of dugks is not affected by the cfl number apparently as long as @xmath0 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also observed that the bkg scheme is about one time faster than the dugks scheme with the same computational mesh and time step . </S>"
