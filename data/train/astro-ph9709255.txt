    "virtually all of the different models of radio pulsars ( e.  g. , cheng & ruderman 1980 ; arons 1981 ; michel 1991 ; beskin , gurevich & istomin 1993 ) predict a common phenomenon : the presence of polar caps ( pcs ) around the neutron star ( ns ) magnetic poles heated up to x - ray temperatures by the backward accretion of relativistic particles and gamma - quanta from the pulsar magnetosphere . a typical size of the pc is estimated to be close to the radius within which the open magnetic field lines originate from the ns surface , @xmath0  km for the period @xmath1  ms ) .",
    "however , expected pc temperatures , @xmath2  k , and luminosities , @xmath3  erg  s@xmath4 , are much less certain and strongly depend on the specific pulsar model .",
    "studying x - ray radiation from the pcs is particularly useful to discriminate between different models .",
    "the best candidates for the investigation of the pc radiation are nearby , old pulsars of ages @xmath5  yr , including very old millisecond pulsars , for which the ns surface outside the pcs is expected to be so cold , @xmath6  k , that its thermal radiation is negligibly faint in the soft x - ray range . indeed",
    ", available observational data allow one to assume the pc origin of soft x - rays detected from , e.  g. , psr b1929 + 10 ( yancopoulos , hamilton & helfand 1994 ; wang & halpern 1997 ) , b0950 + 08 ( manning & willmore 1994 ; wang & halpern 1997 ) , and j04374715 ( becker & trmper 1993 ) . moreover , there are some indications that hard tails of the x - ray spectra of younger pulsars , b0656 + 14 and b105552 , may contain a thermal pc component ( greiveldinger et al .",
    "1996 ) . on the other hand , nonthermal ( e.  g. , magnetospheric ) x - ray radiation may dominate even in very old pulsars ( cf . becker & trmper 1997 ) . for example , @xmath7 observations of the millisecond pulsar b182124 ( saito et al .",
    "1997 ) , whose luminosity in the 0.510  kev range exceeds that predicted by pc models by a few orders of magnitude ( see discussion in zavlin & pavlov 1997 ; hereafter zp97 ) , proved its x - rays to be of a magnetospheric origin .",
    "thus , thorough investigations are needed in each specific case to ascertain the nature of the observed radiation .",
    "the closest known millisecond pulsar j04374715 ( @xmath8  ms , @xmath9  yr , @xmath10  erg  s@xmath4 , @xmath11  g , @xmath12  pc ) is of special interest .",
    "important data from this pulsar have been collected with the @xmath13 ( becker & trmper 1993 ; becker et al .",
    "1997 ) , @xmath14 ( edelstein , foster & bowyer 1995 ; halpern , martin & marshall 1996 ) and @xmath7 ( kawai , tamura & saito 1996 ) space observatories .",
    "becker & trmper ( 1993 ) and halpern et al .  ( 1996 ) showed that the spectral data can be fitted with power - law or blackbody plus power - law models .",
    "the latter fit indicates that the x - ray emission may be , at least partly , of a thermal ( pc ) origin .",
    "rajagopal & romani ( 1996 ) applied more realistic models of radiation emitted by ns atmospheres to fitting the thermal component and concluded that the iron atmospheres do not fit the observed spectrum .",
    "the observations made with the @xmath13 and @xmath14 missions revealed smooth pulsations of soft x - rays with the pulsed fraction @xmath15 apparently growing with photon energy in the 0.12.4  kev @xmath13 range . since the pulsed fraction of the nonthermal radiation is not expected to vary significantly in the narrow energy range , it is natural to attribute the observed radiation to the pulsar pcs .",
    "the pc radiation should be inevitably pulsed unless the rotation axis coincides with either the line of sight or magnetic axis .",
    "if it were the blackbody ( isotropic ) radiation , the pulsed fraction would remain the same at all photon energies .",
    "the energy dependence of @xmath16 can be caused by anisotropy ( limb - darkening ) of thermal radiation emitted from ns atmospheres ( pavlov et al .",
    "1994 ; zavlin , pavlov & shibanov 1996 ) .",
    "zavlin et al .  (",
    "1996 ) showed that even in the case of low magnetic fields characteristic to millisecond pulsars ( @xmath17  g ) the anisotropy strongly depends on photon energy and chemical composition of ns surface layers .",
    "to interpret the @xmath13 and @xmath14 observations of , zp97 applied the ns atmosphere models with account for the energy - dependent limb - darkening and the effects of gravitational redshift and bending of photon trajectories ( zavlin , shibanov & pavlov 1995 ) . assuming the viewing angle ( between the rotation axis and line of sight ) , @xmath18 , and the magnetic inclination ( angle between the magnetic and rotation axes ) , @xmath19 , inferred by manchester & johnston ( 1995 ) from the phase dependence of the position angle of the radio polarization",
    ", zp97 showed that both the spectra and the light curves ( pulse profiles ) of the _ entire _ soft x - ray radiation detected by @xmath13 and @xmath14 can be interpreted as thermal radiation from two hydrogen - covered pcs , whereas neither the blackbody nor iron atmosphere models fit the observations .",
    "the approach of zp97 differs substantially from that of rajagopal & romani ( 1996 ) who did not take into account the energy - dependent anisotropy of the emergent radiation and gravitational bending ( hence , they could not analyze the pulse profiles ) , made the unrealistic assumption that pulsed and unpulsed flux components are of completely separate origin , and consequently obtained quite different parameters of the radiating region .",
    "the simplest , single - temperature pc model of zp97 provides a satisfactory fit with typical pc radius @xmath20  km ( reasonably close to the theoretical estimate of @xmath21  km ) and temperature @xmath22  k. the corresponding bolometric luminosity of the two pcs , @xmath23  erg  s@xmath4 , comprises @xmath24 of the pulsar total energy loss @xmath25 .",
    "this value of @xmath26 is in excellent agreement with the predictions of the slot - gap pulsar model by arons ( 1981 ) .",
    "even better fit to the observational data is provided by a model with non - uniform temperature distribution along the pc surface .",
    "in addition , the inferred interstellar hydrogen column density towards the , @xmath27  @xmath28 was demonstrated to be well consistent with the ism properties obtained from observations of other stars in the vicinity of the pulsar .",
    "all these results allow one to conclude that the x - ray radiation observed from   is indeed of the thermal ( pc ) origin .",
    "the results of zp97 were obtained for fixed orientations of the rotation and magnetic axes ( angles @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) and for standard ns mass @xmath31 and radius @xmath32  km .",
    "the inferred pc radius , temperature and luminosity are almost insensitive to these four parameters .",
    "their main effect is on the shape and pulsed fraction of the light curves .",
    "for instance , @xmath16 decreases with increasing the mass - to - radius ratio , unless the observer can see the pc in the center of the back hemisphere of the ns , which is possible at @xmath33 and @xmath34 , where @xmath35 and @xmath36  km@xmath37 ( e.  g. , zavlin et al .",
    "the angles @xmath30 and @xmath29 can not be precisely evaluated from the radio polarization measurements because of the complicated variation of the polarization position angle across the eight - component mean radio pulse of  ( manchester & johnston 1995 ) , and the true ns mass and radius may differ from the canonical values . on the other hand , the fact that the set of angles and @xmath38 adopted by zp97 fits the data does not mean that a better fit can not be obtained for another set , and it tells us nothing about the allowed domain of these parameters .",
    "hence , fitting the light curves for variable @xmath38 , @xmath30 , and @xmath29 enables one to constrain the mass - to - radius ratio and/or the magnetic inclination and viewing angle , so that the present paper is complementary to zp97 .",
    "we describe our approach in  2 and present the results on  in  3 .",
    "since the shape of the light curves depends on energy , the light curve fitting is coupled to the spectral fitting .",
    "we fit the count rate spectrum ( total @xmath39 counts ) collected by the @xmath13 position sensitive proportional counter ( pspc ) with the phase - integrated model spectrum emitted from two identical , uniformly heated pcs @xmath40 apart , assuming the hydrogen composition of the surface layers ( zp97 ) .",
    "the fitting is carried out on a grid of angles @xmath29 and @xmath30 between @xmath41 and @xmath42 at different mass - to - radius ratios @xmath43 in a range allowed by equations of state of the superdense ns matter . as shown in zp97 , both the @xmath13 and @xmath14 observations of   are consistent with the applied model at the interstellar hydrogen column density of @xmath44  @xmath28 ; therefore we freeze @xmath45 at this value and obtain @xmath46 and @xmath47 from the spectral fits for each set of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath43 . with these @xmath46 and @xmath47",
    ", we calculate the model spectral fluxes for various phases of the pulsar period and fold each of the spectra with the pspc response matrix ; this gives us the model light curve as a function of phase @xmath48 for given @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath43 .",
    "this light curve is then compared with the observed pspc light curve . for this comparison",
    ", we used the pspc light curve for the total @xmath13 energy range , 0.12.4  kev ; its pulsed fraction ( for 17 phase bins ) was determined to be @xmath49 ( zp97 ) .",
    "we bin the model light curve to the same number of phase bins ( @xmath50 ) and calculate the @xmath51 value , @xmath52 for each set of @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath43 ( @xmath53 and @xmath54 are the observed and model numbers of counts in the @xmath55-th bin ) .",
    "this allows us to find the best - fit parameters ( which correspond to the minimum of @xmath51 ) and confidence levels in the parameter space .",
    "figure  1 shows the 68% , 90% and 99% confidence regions for the above - described light curve models in the @xmath29-@xmath30 plane at several values of the mass - to - radius ratio , @xmath56 .",
    "the ratio determines the parameter @xmath57 responsible for the effects of gravitational redshift and bending of photon trajectories ( e.  g. , zavlin et al .",
    "for the @xmath43 values in figure 1 , the parameter @xmath58 varies between 0.82 and 0.73 , making visible from 74% to 91% of the whole ns surface , so that a distant observer can detect the radiation from both pcs simultaneously during almost the whole pulsar period .",
    "the plots in figure 1 are clearly symmetrical with respect to the transformation @xmath59 because the model light curves depend only on the angle @xmath60 between the observer s direction and the magnetic axis : @xmath61 , where @xmath48 is the rotational phase .",
    "the minimum value of the reduced @xmath51 ( @xmath62 for 17 degrees of freedom ) was obtained at @xmath63 , @xmath64 ( or vice versa ) and @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) . in figure  1",
    "we also show the lines of constant model pulsed fraction .",
    "the lines for the pulsed fractions compatible with the detected value , @xmath67 , are close to the confidence contours unless @xmath29 and/or @xmath30 are close to @xmath42 ; at these large angles the model light curves have a complicated shape ( e.  g. , two maxima per rotational period ) inconsistent with what is observed .",
    "the increase of the mass - to - radius ratio enhances the gravitational bending and leads to a greater contribution from the secondary pc ( that on the back ns hemisphere ) , which suppresses the model pulsations . as a result ,",
    "the allowed regions in figure 1 completely vanish at @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) ( @xmath70 ) the model pulsations may grow because of appearance of strong narrow peaks from pc at @xmath71 . however , there are no such peaks in the observed light curve . ] . with decreasing the @xmath43 ratio , the confidence regions shift towards the bottom - left corner of the @xmath29-@xmath30 plane reaching a limiting position at @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) when the effect of the gravitational bending becomes negligible , and the observer detects radiation only from the primary pc ( on the front hemisphere ) .",
    "figure  1 provides obvious constraints on the pulsar mass - to - radius ratio .",
    "for instance , if there were no observational information about the @xmath29 and @xmath30 values , the only constraint would be @xmath74 , or @xmath75  km , at a 99% confidence level . if , however , we adopt @xmath18 and @xmath19 , as given by manchester & johnston ( 1995 ) , then @xmath76 .",
    "figure  2 shows the corresponding domain in the ns mass - radius diagram , restricted by the @xmath77 dependences for soft ( @xmath78 ) and hard ( ti ) equations of state of the superdense matter ( shapiro & teukolsky 1983 ) .",
    "it follows from this picture , for example , that the radius of a ns with the canonical mass @xmath31 is within the range @xmath79  km .",
    "another set of angles , @xmath80 and @xmath81 , was suggested by gil & krawczyk ( 1997 ) .",
    "this set gets within the 99% confidence region only for very low mass - to - radius ratios , @xmath82 , when the gravitational effects become negligible .",
    "this corresponds to very low masses , @xmath83 at any @xmath84 allowed by the equations of state ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "note that for these angles and @xmath85 the secondary pc remains invisible during the whole pulsar period .",
    "we have demonstrated that the analysis of the soft x - ray radiation emitted by pcs of radio pulsars in terms of ns atmosphere models provides a new tool to constrain the ns mass and radius , and consequently the equation state of the superdense matter in the ns interiors .",
    "the constraints become more stringent if this analysis is combined with complementary data on the pulsar magnetic inclination and viewing angle , as we have shown using the millisecond pulsar j04374715 as an example . in principle , these angles can be inferred from the phase dependence of the radio polarization position angle . however , in the case of j04374715 this dependence is too complicated to be described by a simple rotating vector model of radhakrishnan & cooke ( 1969 ) , so that the inferred angles are very uncertain .",
    "once an adequate model for the radio emission is found , the statistical analysis of the polarization data would result in a domain of allowed angles in the @xmath29-@xmath30 plane , and the constraints should be based upon overlapping of the confidence regions obtained from the x - ray light curve and from the radio polarization data .",
    "this may constrain not only the @xmath38 ratio , but also the pulsar geometry .",
    "the allowed @xmath77 domain can be further restricted if additional information on the ns mass is available .",
    "for instance , since is in a binary system with a white dwarf companion , it is possible to estimate independently an upper limit on the ns mass .",
    "sandhu et al .",
    "( 1997 ) found upper limits on the white dwarf mass , @xmath86 , and on the orbital inclination , @xmath87 , that yields a restriction @xmath88 ( see their fig .  2 ) .",
    "if further observations of the pulsar reduce the limit on @xmath89 , or a lower upper limit on @xmath90 is obtained from white dwarf cooling models , a more stringent constraint on @xmath91 would follow , thus narrowing the allowed domains of the other pulsar parameters ( @xmath84 , @xmath29 and @xmath30 ) .",
    "the above - described analysis for   is simplified by the pulsar s low magnetic field which does not affect the properties of the x - ray radiation .",
    "the spectra and , particularly , angular distribution of radiation emerging from strongly magnetized ns atmospheres depends significantly on the magnetic field ( pavlov et al .",
    "thus , a similar , albeit more complicated , analysis of x - ray radiation from pulsars with strong magnetic fields , @xmath92  g ( e.  g. , psr b1929 + 10 and 0950 + 08 ) , would enable one to constrain also the magnetic field strength at their magnetic poles .",
    "we thank werner becker for providing us with the @xmath13 pspc light curve .",
    "we are grateful to joachim trmper for stimulating discussions .",
