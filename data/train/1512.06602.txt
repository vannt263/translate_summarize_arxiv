    "magnetic field @xmath0 of extreme strength is created in non - central heavy - ion collisions by fast moving nuclei .",
    "its magnitude is on the order of @xmath1 and points approximately in the out - of - plane direction .",
    "the phenomenological consequences of such unprecedented magnetic field have attracted much recent interest ( see e.g.  @xcite for recent reviews ) .",
    "one particularly important example is the chiral magnetic effect ( cme )  the generation of charge current @xmath2 along magnetic field @xmath3 for a chiral medium in the presence of axial charge imbalance : @xmath4 where @xmath5 characterizes chirality imbalance .",
    "the possible occurrence of axial charge imbalance is related to a salient feature of qcd as non - abelian gauge theory , in which topologically nontrivial gauge field configurations such as instantons and sphalerons are known to exist and play curial roles for nonperturbative dynamics .",
    "when coupled to massless fermions ( e.g. light quarks in qcd ) , the fluctuations of topological charges carried by those configurations will translate into fluctuations of chirality imbalance via chiral anomaly .",
    "remarkably , the coefficient @xmath6 in the above cme relation is completely fixed from anomaly relation .",
    "therefore cme opens a unique possibility of observable effects that may manifest nontrivial topology and chiral anomaly of qcd in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the cme will contribute to the reaction - plane dependent azimuthal correlation observables : @xmath7 with @xmath8 labeling the species and @xmath9 the azimuthal angles of two final state charged hadrons .",
    "the @xmath10 denotes reaction plane angle and we set @xmath11 .",
    "however , these observables also suffer from elliptic flow driven background contributions and can not be entirely attributed to cme .",
    "an outstanding challenge at present is to quantitatively decipher possible cme signals from the measured correlation observables . in this contribution we will first discuss a recent proposal of using the cu + au collisions to test the relative importance between electromagnetic - field contributions and the flow - driven contributions .",
    "we will then report our recent efforts to quantify the influence of the key theoretical uncertainties ( like initial axial charge fluctuations and magnetic field lifetime ) on cme signals and to further separate a major background effect ( transverse momentum conservation effects ) in measured correlations along with predictions for future measurements , by using an anomalous and viscous hydrodynamic simulation framework .",
    "one of the difficulties in separating the cme and the elliptic - flow driven contributions in au + au collisions or pb + pb collisions is that in such collisions the strength of the magnetic fields have a similar dependence on centrality as the elliptic flow .",
    "it was proposed to use the u + u collisions to overcome this difficulty because in the most central u + u collisions the magnetic fields almost die away while the elliptic flow is still sizable  @xcite .",
    "we here report another proposal that the cu + au collisions may also provide insight to disentangling the cme and the elliptic - flow - driven contributions .    here",
    ", the main ingredient of cu + au collisions is the in - plane electric fields pointing from the au to cu nuclei ; see fig .",
    "[ illu ] ( left ) for the numerical result  @xcite .",
    "suppose @xmath12 is dominated by cme rather than the elliptic - flow driven effects . then in non - central cu + au collisions",
    ", the in - plane electric fields will induce an in - plane charge separation in addition to the out - of - plane charge separation due to cme ; see fig .",
    "[ illu ] ( right ) for illustration .",
    "the presence of the in - plane dipole will suppress the strength of @xmath12 ; and if the electric fields are strong enough , or somehow equivalently , if the lifetime of the electric fields is long enough , the total charge dipole will be mainly along the in - plane direction and the signs of the same - sign and opposite - sign correlations will be reversed . on the other hand ,",
    "if @xmath12 is dominated by the elliptic - flow driven effects , we expect that @xmath12 ( more precisely , @xmath13 with @xmath14 the opposite - sign / same - sign correlation , because the directed flow in cu + au collisions may contribute to both @xmath15 and @xmath16 . ) would not change too much from au + au collisions to cu + au collisions .",
    "plausibly , @xmath17 as a function of centrality in cu + au collisions would lie between that in cu + cu and au + au collisions",
    ". thus the cu + au collisions may provide a way to test the relative importance of the electromagnetic fields and the elliptic flow in the correlations @xmath12 .",

    "we now turn to discuss our recent progress on separating background contributions from the data and quantitatively computing cme signal  @xcite .",
    "charge separation along magnetic field induced by the cme would contribute to the azimuthal distribution of charged hadrons as follows : @xmath19_{\\rm cme } \\propto [ 1 + 2 q^h a^{h}_{1}\\sin(\\phi ) + ... ] \\ , .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here , `` h '' labels the species of the hadron , e.g. @xmath20 .",
    "our first task is to _ quantitatively _ relate the magnetic field @xmath21 and initial axial charge density @xmath22 in the early stage of heavy - ion collisions to the @xmath23 in the late stage hadron distribution . to that end",
    ", we have solved anomalous hydrodynamics for axial and vector charge density evolution on top of background hydrodynamic profile from data - validated vish code  @xcite .    the computed results for @xmath23 depend on two inputs , a ) initial axial charge density @xmath24 and b ) the magnetic field strength and lifetime .",

    "we have found from our numerical computations that @xmath33 is approximately proportional to @xmath35 and @xmath21 .",
    "this may not be surprising given the cme relation @xmath36 .",

    "next let us examine the background contributions to the measured correlations .",
    "this is an essential step towards extracting cme signal from the data .",
    "we focus on the reaction - plane - projected same - charge pair correlations , obtained via @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "those data measured by star are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_data ] ( left ) .",
    "the cme is expected to mainly contribute to @xmath39 and hence @xmath40 . in other words , without any background effect , @xmath41 .",
    "in contrast , @xmath42 is negative and @xmath43 is around @xmath44 from the data .",
    "this implies the existence of a negative background contribution to same - charge correlation . and motivates a possible interpretation of the data : @xmath45}\\,\\ , , \\langle\\sin\\phi\\sin\\phi\\rangle \\approx\\textrm{[negative background}+\\textrm{positive cme}]\\ , $ ] .",
    "past studies have suggested that a major background contribution to the same sign correlation is the transverse momentum conservation ( tmc ) effect  @xcite .",
    "we generalize analytic formula for single - component tmc in @xcite to the case of multiple types of hadrons .",
    "the results depend on the elliptic flow of the hadrons which can be directly computed from the _ same _ hydrodynamic background we use for cme computation .",
    "it further depends on an overall parameter @xmath46 ( the total number of _ all produced _ , rather than just measured , particles ) which we take as an input parameter that controls the magnitude of tmc effect . by fitting @xmath42 from the data , we fix @xmath46 .",
    "we next compute tmc contribution to @xmath43 with already fixed @xmath46 as inputs . subtracting them from the data ,",
    "we finally obtain cme signals .",
    "those two contributions are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig_data ] ( middle ) .",
    "the above procedure is also schematically sketched below : @xmath47    with the exacted cme signal from data we now could quantify the initial axial charge parameter @xmath32 by comparing the signal with anomalous hydrodynamics results . in fig .",
    "[ fig_data ] ( right ) , we plot @xmath32 at different centralities with two representative @xmath48  fm .",
    "they correspond to two different scenarios : the lifetime of magnetic field is very short and the life time of magnetic field is comparable to the fireball , respectively .",
    "few remarks are in order .",
    "first , a shorter lifetime of magnetic field can be compensated by a larger initial axial charge density .",
    "second , the order of magnitude of @xmath49 is inline with the theoretical estimates based on chern - simons diffusion rate for gluonic topological fluctuations . finally , @xmath50 increases mildly from central toward peripheral collisions : a smaller system typically has a larger fluctuations .",
    "our results also suggest that cme signal indeed can be used to extract the information on topological fluctuations",
    ".    it may be interesting to compare the two recent anomalous hydrodynamic studies for cme : @xcite ( hhk ) and @xcite ( yl ) . while hhk solves full evolution for charge densities ( albeit with not - so - realistic bulk evolution and eos )",
    ", yl solves the linearized evolution ( albeit on top of a data - validated bulk evolution ) .",
    "while hhk emphasizes event - by - event simulations with glasma initial conditions , yl emphasizes simultaneous computation of backgrounds which allows extraction of cme signal and constraints on initial conditions .",
