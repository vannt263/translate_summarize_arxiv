    "a decade of beautiful experiments at cern , fermilab , and slac have provided increasingly precise tests of the standard model ( sm ) .",

    "has a poor confidence level @xmath6 , due to two @xmath0 anomalies .",
    "one of these , @xmath7 $ ] from nutev@xcite , is recent .",
    "the other , the discrepancy between the effective leptonic mixing angle , @xmath8 , determined from three leptonic asymmetry measurements(@xmath9 $ ] ) versus its determination from three hadronic ( @xmath10 $ ] ) measurements , is dominated by the @xmath11 discrepancy between the two most precise , @xmath12@xcite and @xmath13,@xcite which has been a persistent feature of the data since the earliest days of lep and slc .    in this talk",
    "i focus on how the direct lower limit from lep ii , @xmath14 gev , but rather means that if the mass were actually 114.4 gev it could have escaped detection with 5% likelihood .",
    "the likelihood for @xmath15 gev is @xmath16 .",
    "see for instance section 5 of @xcite . ]",
    "constrains the interpretation of these anomalies , and especially the asymmetry anomaly.@xcite the central observation is that the only measurements which support @xmath17 in the allowed region are precisely the ones with big pulls that drive the fit to a poor cl . without the discrepant measurements",
    "the prediction for @xmath17 is too low .",
    "in particular , the agreement of the sm with the data would not be improved if both anomalies were attributed to systematic error , since the resulting fit ( with @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath10 $ ] removed ) predicts @xmath3 gev , with only a 5% likelihood that @xmath19 gev .",
    "the @xmath20 mass measurement plays a central role , discussed in more detail in @xcite . in the sm fit",
    ", it favors the lower range of the leptonic asymmetries , @xmath9= 0.23113(21)$ ] , over the larger hadronic result , @xmath10= 0.23217(29)$ ] . using the two loop result of @xcite the new experimental result",
    ", @xmath21gev,@xcite implies @xmath22 and a very light value for @xmath17 .",
    "essentially it is @xmath23 which decides whether @xmath12 or @xmath13 will have the largest pull .",
    "the interpretation of the data is not clear .",
    "all three generic possibilities are in play : new physics , statistical fluctuation , and underestimated systematic error .",
    "it is certainly possible that either anomaly is genuine evidence of new physics,@xcite in which case the sm fit would be invalidated and we could not use the precision data to constrain the higgs boson mass until the new physics were understood .",
    "statistical fluctation is also a possible explanation , which is fairly represented by the global cl s .",
    "the new 23 mev downward shift in @xmath23 increases the global cl by a factor two , from 0.01 to 0.02 , which still can not be said to be `` favored '' .    concerning the possibility of underestimated systematic error , the three leptonic asymmetry measurements , @xmath24 $ ] , are theoretically clean and use three quite different experimental techniques , so that a large common systematic error is very unlikely .",
    "in contrast , both @xmath18 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] depend on subtle systematic issues , involving experimental technique and , especially , nontrivial applications of qcd .",
    "the three hadronic asymmetry measurements have important shared systematics , both theoretical and experimental .",
    "if the systematic uncertainties of the @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath25 $ ] anomalies were much larger than current estimates , the @xmath2 of the global fit could increase to as much as 0.71 .",
    "the sm might then appear to provide a good description of the data , however we would then encounter the conflict with the lep ii lower limit on @xmath17 .",
    "this conflict would also signify new physics,@xcite to raise the prediction for @xmath17 into the allowed region above 114 gev .",
    "again @xmath17 could not be predicted until the new physics is known . with oblique corrections",
    "it is possible to `` dial in '' essentially any value of @xmath17.@xcite    it should be clear that the focus here on the possibility of underestimated systematic error is not based on the belief that it is the most likely explanation . in both cases",
    "the experimental groups have put great effort into understanding and estimating the systematic uncertainties , and the quoted systematic errors are too small to explain the anomalies.@xcite in fact , the situation is truly puzzling , and there is no decisive reason to prefer systematic error over new physics as the explanation of either anomaly .",
    "rather we consider the systematic error hypothesis simply in order to understand what it implies and find that it also points to new physics .",
    "though it is an _ a posteriori _ observation , the grouping of the six asymmetry measurements into hadronic and leptonic clusters is a striking feature of the data .",
    "the leptonic asymmetries are the three lowest , combining to @xmath24=0.23113(21)$ ] with @xmath27 , @xmath28 .",
    "the hadronic asymmetries are the three highest , tightly clustered around @xmath25=0.23217(29)$ ] , with @xmath29 , @xmath30 . combining all six measurements",
    "we have @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "it is unclear whether the grouping into leptonic and hadronic clusters is by chance or whether it is telling us something , either about new physics or about systematic effects .",
    "since they are linked by common systematics , we consider the the three hadronic asymmetry measurements together when considering the systematic uncertainty hypothesis .",
    "the sm radiative corrections are computed with zfitter v6.30,@xcite but with the two loop @xmath23.@xcite experimental correlations are from @xcite and @xmath34 is from @xcite as in @xcite .",
    "predictions for @xmath17 are obtained using @xmath35@xcite and also with a `` bayesian '' likelihood method@xcite .",
    "both methods give very similar results , and only the former are reported here . when fitting the same observables the sm predictions and @xmath36 results agree well with @xcite , with small differences from our use of @xcite .",
    "table 1 summarizes @xmath36 fits of four data sets , in which none , one , or both sets of anomalous measurements are excluded .",
    "we vary @xmath37 and @xmath38 , which are constrained , and @xmath39 and @xmath17 , which are unconstrained .",

    "in the case at hand @xmath57 is the product of two @xmath36 distributions : @xmath64 and @xmath65 , where @xmath35 is the difference between the minimum at @xmath66 and the global minimum .",
    "the factor 1/2 in @xmath67 is compensated by the fact that the domain of @xmath35 extends from @xmath68 to @xmath69 ; modifying equations ( 2 - 4 ) appropriately , the expected value is again 1/2 .",

    "relative to 0.25 , the value of @xmath57 is marginal for all four fits .",
    "the low values of @xmath67 in fits c and d are either statistical fluctuations ( e.g. , of @xmath37 ) or they are signals of new physics . examples of new physics that could do the job are the mssm with light sneutrinos and sleptons ( altarelli _ et al .",
    "_ in @xcite ) or a fourth generation of quarks and leptons with a massive neutrino ( novikov _ et al . _ in @xcite ) .",
    "an illustrative set of parameters for the latter is @xmath75 gev , @xmath76 gev , @xmath77 gev , @xmath78 gev , and @xmath79 gev .",
    "the prediction for @xmath17 can be increased arbitrarily in models for which the dominant effect of the new physics is via the @xmath20 and @xmath80 boson self energies , considered in the oblique approximation@xcite .",
    "figure 3 shows an @xmath81 fit to the minimal data set , with the @xmath36 minimum read to the left and @xmath81 read to the right .",
    "in contrast to the sm fit with a distinct minimum at @xmath3 gev , also shown , the oblique fit is flat , with no preference for any range of @xmath17 .",
    "the confidence level is @xmath82 and the variation in @xmath36 is very small , with @xmath83 for @xmath84 gev .",
    "values of @xmath17 above 1 tev can not be interpreted literally as applying to a simple higgs scalar . for @xmath85",
    "tev symmetry breaking is dynamical , occurring by new strong interactions that can not be analyzed perturbatively.@xcite if the higgs mechanism is correct , there are new quanta that form symmetry breaking vacuum condensates .",
    "values of @xmath17 above 1 tev can be regarded only as a rough guide to the order of magnitude of the masses of the condensate - forming quanta .",
    "the range of positive @xmath86 needed in figure 3 occurs in models with custodial @xmath87 breaking , e.g. , from nondegenerate quark or lepton isospin doublets .",
    "negative @xmath88 is less natural but there is not a no - go theorem , and models with @xmath89 have been exhibited .",
    "it is also possible to fit the data by varying @xmath86 with @xmath90 fixed  see figure 11 of @xcite .",
    "moderately large , postive @xmath86 is again preferred . in this",
    "fit the confidence level for @xmath17 above the lep ii lower limit is @xmath91 , and the 95% upper limit extends to @xmath92 gev .",
    "taken together the precision electroweak data and the direct searches for the higgs boson create a complex puzzle with many possible outcomes .",
    "an overview is given in the `` electroweak schematic diagram , '' figure 4 .",
    "the diagram illustrates how various hypotheses about the two @xmath0 anomalies lead to new physics or to the conventional sm fit . the principal conclusion is reflected in the fact that the only lines leading into the ` sm ' box are labeled ` statistical fluctuation . '",
    "that is , systematic error of both @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath93 $ ] can not save the sm fit , since it implies the conflict with the search limit , indicated by the box labeled @xmath94 , which in turn either implies new physics or reflects statistical          the ` new physics ' box in figure 4 is reached if either @xmath0 anomaly is genuine or , conversely , if neither is genuine and the resulting 95% @xmath2 conflict with the search limit is genuine .",
    "the global confidence levels of fits a and b fairly reflect the probability that they are due to statistical fluctuations .",
    "they do not favor the sm and they also do not exclude it : `` it is a part of probability that many improbable things will happen.''@xcite    the smoothest path to the sm traverses the central box , fit b , and then exits via ` statistical fluctuation ' to the sm . in this scenario",
    "qcd effects might explain the nutev anomaly and the 17% confidence level of fit b could be a statistical fluctuation .",
    "this is a valid possibility , but two other problems indicated in the central box should also be considered in this scenario .",
    "first , the consistency of the @xmath17-sensitive measurements is marginal , indicated by the 6.7% confidence level of fit b@xmath48 .",
    "second , the persistent conflict between the leptonic and hadronic asymmetry measurements , currently @xmath95 with @xmath96 , is at the heart of the determination of @xmath17 .",
    "thus even if we assume that the @xmath2 of the global fit is a statistical fluctuation , the reliability of the prediction of @xmath17 depends on even less probable fluctuations .",
    "the leptonic asymmetry measurements have been finalized .",
    "there are still some ongoing analyses of the hadronic asymmetry data , but unless major new systematic effects are uncovered , large changes are unlikely . to do better",
    "we will need a second generation z factory , such as the proposed giga - z project .",
    "however , to fully exploit the potential of such a facility it will be necessary to improve the precision of @xmath38 by a factor of @xmath97 or better , requiring a dedicated program to measure @xmath98 below @xmath97 gev to @xmath99.@xcite the @xmath20 boson and top quark mass measurements will be improved at the tevatron , lhc , and , eventually , at a linear @xmath100 collider .",
    "the issues raised by the data heighten the excitement of the moment in high energy physics . if both @xmath0 anomalies reflect systematic effects , the resulting sm fit is inconsistent with the lep ii limit . for the sm prediction of @xmath17 to be valid",
    "the anomalies must be a propitious combination of systematic effect ( @xmath101 ) and statistical fluctuation ( @xmath24 $ ] vs. @xmath25 $ ] ) .",
    "the end of the decade of precision electroweak measurements leaves us with a great puzzle , that puts into question the mass scale at which the physics of electroweak symmetry breaking will be found .",
    "the solution of the puzzle could emerge at the tevatron .",
    "if it is not found there it will emerge at the lhc , which at its design luminosity will be able to search for the new quanta of the symmetry breaking sector over the full range allowed by unitarity.@xcite                      for new physics models of the anomalies see for instance x.  g.  he and g.  valencia , phys .",
