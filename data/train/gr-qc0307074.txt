    "the exterior gravitational field of a stationary source may have a large number of independent multipole moments .",

    "these parameters are interpreted as mass , angular momentum and net electromagnetic charge of the black hole , respectively .",
    "this statement is called the black hole no - hair conjecture , which was proposed by ruffini and wheeler@xcite .",

    "phase transitions in the early universe are caused by symmetry breaking leading to a manifold of degenerate vacua with nontrivial topology and giving rise to topological defects .",
    "the topological defects are classified into domain walls , cosmic strings and monopoles by the topology of the vacua . if the gauge field is involved in the spontaneous symmetry breaking , the topological defects are gauged . on the other hand , when the symmetry is global , the emerging defects are called global defects .",
    "although energy of the gauge monopole is finite , the global monopole has divergent energy because of the long tail of the scalar field .",
    "this divergence has to be removed by cutting it off at a certain distance .",
    "this procedure is not necessarily artificial in the early universe , because other defects which may exist near the original one cancel the divergence .",
    "these neighboring defects are not only the monopoles , but also can be domain walls or cosmic strings .",

    "we investigated the stability of black hole solutions in the einstein-@xmath4 scalar system by linear perturbation .",
    "the black holes are stable against spherical perturbation as the particle - like case without beh .",
    "we also studied the polar perturbation since the trivial ( schwarzschild ) de - sitter solution with @xmath126 is stable against the spherical perturbation@xcite but not against the non - spherical perturbations@xcite .",
    "we suggested that the black holes with the ordinary or the supermassive global monopole hair be stable against our perturbations .",
    "this result implies that if these kind of objects were formed in the early universe , they can survive without decaying to other object nor swallowing the outer matter field leaving a vacuum black hole .",
    "it should be also stressed that the black hole no - hair conjecture is violated for @xmath4 scalar hair and gives new insight on the problem of black hole hair .",
