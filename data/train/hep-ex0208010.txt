    "for a @xmath0 collider [ 1 ] , muons must be rapidly accelerated to high energies while minimizing the kilometers of radio frequency ( rf ) cavities and magnet bores .",
    "cost must be moderate .",
    "some muons may be lost to decay but not too many . in the first stage of acceleration , consider twenty passes through a two gev linac and see if enough muons survive decay .",
    "a single continuos linac with teardrop shaped arcs of fixed field magnets at each end is adopted .",
    "muon decay losses are minimized ; muons pass through shorter arcs when their gamma boost is low .",
    "the overall geometry looks like a dogbone [ 2 ] .",
    "more time is available for the second stage of acceleration due to the gamma boost .",
    "consider a ring of fixed superconducting magnets alternating with iron combined function magnets rapidly cycling between full negative and full positive field [ 3 ] .",
    "this interleaved geometry increases the average bending field achievable in a fast ramping synchrotron and thus reduces muon decay losses .",
    "a neutrino factory as outlined in the recent brookhaven study [ 4 ] provides 20 gev muons which have enough energy to explore cp violation in the lepton sector . further acceleration to 60 gev may be enough to reach a low mass higgs as suggested by theory and recent measurements at lep .",
    "twenty passes through a 2 gev linac would accelerate muons from 20 to 60 gev .",
    "sets of teardrop shaped arcs as shown in fig .  1 are used at used at both end of the 2 gev linac . to minimize magnet cost",
    "45@xmath1 turns are used with short straight sections to line up the arcs . for each teardrop",
    ", the length added to the curved sections by the two straight sections is @xmath2 .",
    "take a muon lifetime of @xmath3 seconds , 1.8 telsa dipoles , a 70% dipole packing fraction , and a 133 meter long 2 gev linac with 15 mv / meter .",
    "the total magnet bore length required is 7000 meters , 11% longer that the fermilab tevatron .",
    "muon survival after twenty passes through the 2 gev linac is 95.5% . squaring this percentage",
    "the luminosity is 91.8% of what it would be in a higgs factory if there had been no decay loss in accelerating the muons from 20 to 60 gev .",
    "the magnet cell length may have to be short to provide good acceptance for the muons in the arcs .",
    "an alternating gradient design where the magnet lamination change shape within a magnet avoids magnet ends and makes it easier to consider superconducting wire rather than copper .",
    "the magnets do have to be at full field constantly , so power consumption is an issue .    finally note that in a dogbone geometry , muons can orbit clockwise in one end and counterclockwise in the other end , which may help to preserve polarization . if muons are 100% polarized , the @xmath4 higgs cross section doubles ( versus the case of zero polarization ) .",
    "a lattice cell for a ring of interleaved fast ramping magnets and fixed field superconducting magnets is shown in fig .  2 .",
    "the gradient dipoles buck the superconducting magnets at the start of a cycle and work in unison with the superconducting magnets at the end of a cycle .",
    "the magnetic field swings from full negative to full positive in the gradient dipoles .",
    "the sagitta of a muon in a magnet increases linearly with increasing magnetic field , @xmath5 .",
    "it decreases linearly with increasing momentum , @xmath6 .",
    "and it increases as the square of the length of a magnet , @xmath7 .",
    "the size of the sagitta directly affects the size of magnet bores because the sagitta _ changes _ throughout a cycle .",
    "the sagitta is given by @xmath8 , where @xmath9 . at 250 gev ,",
    "the sagitta is 5 mm for a 2 meter long 8 telta magnet and 11 mm for a 6 meter long 2 telsa magnet . as momentum increases ,",
    "the sagitta in the 8 tesla magnets decreases towards zero and the sagitta in the 2 tesla magnets goes somewhat past zero .",
    "consider the feasibility of an iron dominated magnet which cycles from -2 to + 2 tesla [ 3 ] .",
    "first calculate the energy , @xmath10 , stored in a 2 tesla field in a volume 6 m long , .03 m high , and .08 m wide .",
    "the permeability constant , @xmath11 , is @xmath12 .",
    "@xmath13 = $ ] 23000 joules .",
    "next given 6 turns , an lc circuit capacitor , and a 250 hz frequency ; estimate current , voltage , inductance , and capacitance .",
    "the height , @xmath14 , of the aperture is .03 m .",
    "the top and bottom coils may be connected as two separate circuits to halve the switching voltage .",
    "now calculate the resistive energy loss , which over time is equal to one - half the loss at the maximum current of 8000 amps .",
    "the one - half comes from the integral of cosine squared .",
    "table i gives the resistivity of copper .",
    "a six - turn copper conductor 3 cm thick , 10 cm high , and 7800 cm long has a power dissipation of 15 kilowatts .         in summary ,",
    "a 250 hz dipole magnet close to 2 tesla looks possible as long as the field volume is limited and one is willing to deal with stranded copper and thin , low hysteresis laminations .",
    "total losses can be held to twice the i@xmath18r loss in the copper alone , using metglas .",
    "now with a rough design for a fast ramping magnet in hand , work out the details of ring radii , rf requirements , and the fraction of muons that survive decay . the fraction of the circumference packed with dipoles is set at @xmath19 = 70% .",
    "as an example , consider two rings in a 2200 m radius tunnel with an injection momentum of 250 gev / c .",
    "the first has 25% 8 t magnets and 75% @xmath202 t magnets and ramps from 0.5 t to 3.5 t .",
    "the second has 55% 8 t magnets and 45% @xmath202 t magnets and ramps from 3.5 t to 5.3 t .",
    "provide 25 gev of rf .",
    "the first ring accelerates muons from 250 gev / c to 1600 gev / c in 54 orbits . and",
    "the second from 1600 gev / c to 2400 gev / c in 32 orbits . at what frequency",
    "do the two rings have to ramp ?",
    "only 1/6 of the 18% loss occurs in the second ring , so it is not crucial to run it as fast as 330 hz .",
    "the 250 @xmath30 1600 gev / c ring has 1200 6 m long dipoles ramping at 200 hz .",
    "the 1600 @xmath30 2400 gev / c ring has 725 6 m long dipoles ramping at 330 hz .",
    "the weighted average rate is 250 hz . if running continuously , the 1925 magnets would consume a weighted average of 29 kilowatts each for a total of 56 megawatts . but",
    "given a 15 hz refresh rate for the final muon storage ring [ 1 ] , the average duty cycle for the 250 @xmath30 2400 gev / c acceleration rings is 6% .",
    "so the power falls to 4 megawatts , which is small .",
    "finally note that one can do a bit better than 82% on the muon survival during final acceleration if the first ring is smaller , say 1000 m , rather than 2200 m .",
