    "an important question in string phenomenology is how and when supersymmetry ( susy ) is broken .",
    "a great deal of effort has been devoted to frameworks in which it is broken non - perturbatively in the supersymmetric effective field theory .",
    "much less effort has been devoted to string theories that are non - supersymmetric by construction .    on the face of it ,",
    "the trade off for the second option , is that non - supersymmetric string models do not have the stability properties of supersymmetric ones .",
    "however it can be argued that as long as the susy breaking is spontaneous and parametrically smaller than the string scale , the associated instability is under perturbative control @xcite .",
    "there is then no genuine moral , or even practical , advantage to the former more traditional option , since nature is not supersymmetric . sooner or later , either route to the standard model ( sm ) will lead to runaway potentials for moduli that need to be stabilised .",
    "indeed spontaneous breaking at the string level may even confer advantages in this respect , as discussed in ref.@xcite .",
    "parametric control over susy breaking requires a generic method for passing from a non - superymmetric theory to a supersymmetric counterpart , under certain limiting conditions .",
    "the method that was studied in ref.@xcite is interpolation via compactification to lower dimensions , with susy broken by the scherk - schwarz mechanism @xcite .",
    "the two great advantages of interpolating models are that their compactification volumes can be tuned to make the cosmological constant arbitrarily small , and that some of them exhibit enhanced stability due to a one - loop cosmological constant that is exponentially suppressed with respect to the generic susy breaking scale @xcite .",
    "they can be viewed as natural and phenomenologically interesting extensions of the original observation in refs.@xcite that the @xmath3 tachyon - free non - supersymmetric @xmath4 model interpolates to the heterotic @xmath5 model , via a scherk - schwarz compactification to @xmath6 .",
    "this paper focusses on the properties of @xmath7-dimensional ( @xmath1 ) theories that interpolate between stable , supersymmetric @xmath0 tachyon - free models .",
    "two main results are presented .",
    "first , by deriving and studying the general form of the @xmath0 endpoint theories , in particular how their modular invariance projections are related to the scherk - schwarz deformation , we are able to generalise the latter beyond previous configurations , opening up new possibilities for model building .",
    "second , we present a comprehensive survey of the physical properties that such theories possess ( chiefly their potentials and the possible restoration of susy at small radius ) .",
    "the general details of the interpolations are as shown in figure [ fig : interpolation ] .",
    "beginning with a supersymmetric @xmath0 theory generically referred to as @xmath8 , the theory is compactified to a non - supersymmetric @xmath1 theory @xmath9 by adapting the coordinate dependent compactification ( cdc ) technique first presented in refs.@xcite .",
    "this is the string version of the scherk - schwarz mechanism , which spontaneously breaks susy in the @xmath1 theory with a gravitino mass of @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the largest radius carrying a scherk - schwarz twist .",
    "( we will use `` cdc '' and `` scherk - schwarz '' interchangeably . ) as usual it is the gravitino mass that is the order parameter for susy breaking : it can be continuously dialled to zero at large radius where susy is restored and @xmath8 regained .",
    "supersymmetric theory at infinite radius , @xmath12 and its supersymmetric and non - supersymmetric , interpolated duals , which are defined in the vanishing radius limit . whether or not susy is restored in the @xmath13 model",
    "is determined by the structure of the scherk - schwarz action . _ _ ]    one of the main properties that will be addressed is the nature of the theory as the radius of compactification is taken to zero .",
    "this depends upon the precise details of the scherk - schwarz compactification , and indeed we will find that the presence or otherwise of susy at zero radius depend on the choice of basis vectors and structure constants defining the model .",
    "it is possible that the @xmath1 theory interpolates to either a supersymmetric or a non - supersymmetric model ( @xmath14 or @xmath15 respectively ) .",
    "models of the latter kind correspond to a @xmath0 theory in which susy is broken by discrete torsion @xcite .",
    "we begin in  [ sec : cdc_overview ] by reviewing the basic formalism for interpolation .",
    "section [ sec : cdc_virasoro_modified_algebra ] then presents the construction of @xmath1 non - supersymmetric models as compactifications of @xmath0 supersymmetric ones .",
    "the modification of the massless spectra in the decompactification and @xmath16 limits ( with the latter corresponding to the decompactification limit of a @xmath0 @xmath2-dual theory ) is analysed , in order to determine the nature of the theories at the small and large radii endpoints .",
    "section [ sec : details of cosmological constant calculation ] discusses the technique for rendering the cosmological constant in an interpolating form , allowing it to be calculated across a regime of small and large radii .",
    "the modification of the projection conditions and massless spectrum by the choice of basis vectors and structure constants is made explicit , and based on these observations , in particular how the cdc correlates with modified gso projections in the @xmath0 endpoint theories ,  [ sec : most - general ] then derives the general form of deformation within this framework , extending previous constructions .",
    "this more general formulation may prove to be useful for future model building .",
    "the conditions under which susy is preserved or broken at the endpoints of the interpolation are discussed in  [ sec : susy restoration and energy scales ] .",
    "particular focus is given to the constraints on the appearance of light gravitino winding modes in the zero radius limit .",
    "it is found that models in which the cdc acts only on the space - time side , are inevitably supersymmetric at zero radius , while models within which the cdc vector is non - trivial on the gauge side as well yield a non - supersymmetric model in the same limit .",
    "this analysis paves the way for a presentation in  [ sec : results ] of explicit interpolations ( in terms of their cosmological constants ) in particular models that display various different behaviours : namely we find examples of interpolation between two supersymmetric @xmath0 theories via @xmath1 theories with negative or positive cosmological constant ; interpolation between a non - supersymmetric @xmath0 theory and a supersymmetric one , with or without an intermediate @xmath1 ads minima ; we also find examples of `` metastable '' non - supersymmetric @xmath0 theories ( by which we mean theories that have a positive cosmological constant with an energy barrier ) that can decay to supersymmetric ones .",
    "as mentioned , this paper follows on from a reasonably large body of work on non - supersymmetric strings that is nonetheless much smaller than the work on supersymmetric theories .",
    "following on from the original studies of the ten - dimensional @xmath4 heterotic string  @xcite , there were further studies of the one - loop cosmological constants  @xcite , their finiteness properties  @xcite , their relations to strong / weak coupling duality symmetries  @xcite , and string landscape ideas  @xcite .",
    "the relationship to finite temperature strings was explored in refs .",
    "further development of the scherk - schwarz mechanism in the string context was made in refs.@xcite .",
    "progress towards phenomenology within this class has been made in refs .",
    "related aspects concerning solutions to the large - volume `` decompactification problem '' were discussed in refs.@xcite .",
    "non - supersymmetric string models have also been explored in a wide variety of other configurations  @xcite , including studies of the relations between scales in various schemes  @xcite .",
    "some aspects of this study are particularly relevant to the recent work in refs.@xcite .",
    "note that here we will not elaborate on the properties of the non - supersymmetric @xmath1 theory at radii of order the string length .",
    "as we will see , and as found in ref.@xcite , often there is a minimum in the cosmological constant at this point which suggests some kind of enhancement of symmetry at a special radius .",
    "( indeed often it is possible to identify gauge boson winding modes that become massless at the minimum . )",
    "there is therefore the possibility of establishing connections to yet more non - supersymmetric @xmath1 theories .",
    "conversely one can ask if _ every _ non - supersymmetric tachyon - free @xmath1 theory can be interpolated to a supersymmetric higher dimensional theory .",
    "we comment on this and other prospects in the conclusions in  [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we revisit the calculation of the cosmological constant in the scherk - schwarzed theories , and in particular derive a formulation for the partition function of interpolating models , that is useful for the later analysis .",
    "the discussion is a natural generalisation of the `` compactification - on - a - circle '' treatment of ref.@xcite , and as we shall see it ultimately leads to an improved and more general construction for this class of theory .",
    "let us begin by briefly summarising the implementation of the scherk - schwarz mechanism described in that work .",
    "as already mentioned , this is incorporated using a coordinate dependent compactification ( cdc ) @xcite of an initially supersymmetric @xmath0 theory , namely the @xmath17 model . for our purposes",
    "it is useful to define it in the fermionic formulation , although any construction method would be applicable . in this formulation ,",
    "the initial theory is defined by assigning boundary conditions to worldsheet fermions .",
    "if they are real , this is encapsulated in a set of 28-dimensional basis vectors , @xmath18 , containing periodic or antiperiodic phases .",
    "the sectors of the theory are given by the set of @xmath19 where @xmath20 so that @xmath21 . the spectrum of the theory at generic radius in any sector is determined by imposing the gso projections governed by the vectors @xmath18 and a set of structure constants @xmath22 , according to the klst set of rules in refs.@xcite ( and equivalently ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the model is then further compactified down to @xmath1 on a @xmath23 orbifold .",
    "in the absence of any cdc the result would simply be an @xmath24 model resulting from an overall @xmath25 compactification .",
    "the cdc is implemented by introducing a deformation , described by another vector @xmath26 , of shifts in the charge lattice that depend on the radii @xmath27 of the @xmath28 ; this will be shown explicitly below . under the cdc ,",
    "the virasoro generators of the theory are modified , yielding an extra effective projection condition governed by @xmath29 on the states constituting the massless spectrum of the @xmath1 theory .",
    "the remaining massless states are then characterized by their charges under the @xmath30 symmetry associated with @xmath29 . to qualify as a scherk - schwarz mechanism",
    ", this @xmath30 symmetry has to include some component of the @xmath31-symmetry in order to distinguish bosons from fermions , thereby projecting out the gravitinos , and breaking spacetime susy .",
    "the effect of the cdc of course disappears in the strict @xmath32 limit where the kaluza - klein ( kk ) spectrum becomes continuous , and the @xmath0 endpoint model @xmath17 is recovered . on the other hand as we shall see the cdc turns into another gso projection vector in the @xmath33 limit , where states either remain massless or become infinitely massive . upon @xmath2-dualising ,",
    "@xmath34 the @xmath35 model becomes the non - compact theory @xmath36 , whose properties depend precisely on the form of @xmath29 .",
    "the theories at the two endpoints can contain a different number of states and charges . because @xmath29 can overlap the gauge degrees of freedom",
    ", @xmath36 will generically have a gauge symmetry that differs from that of @xmath17 , and possibly no susy . as we will see the two are in fact",
    "linked : if @xmath36 is supersymmetric then the gauge group is the same as that of @xmath17 , if it is not , then the gauge group is different .",
    "let us now elaborate on the above description .",
    "the conventions for the fermionic construction are as in refs.@xcite and for the cdc are as outlined in ref.@xcite .",
    "that is the unmodified virasoro operators are defined as @xmath37 where , in terms of the winding and kk numbers , @xmath38 and @xmath39 respectively , the left- and right - moving momenta for a theory compactified on two circles of radii @xmath40 take the unshifted form @xmath41      note that level - matching is preserved by the cdc , but the mass spectrum is modified rather than the number of degrees of freedom contained within the theory , as required for a spontaneous breaking of susy @xcite .",
    "it is clear from eq.([eqn : virasoro_2 ] ) that for zero winding modes ( @xmath58 ) , states for which @xmath59 become massive under the action of the cdc .",
    "conversely all the zero winding states in the ns - ns sector remain unshifted by the cdc since they are chargeless .",
    "as described in ref.@xcite there may or may not be massless gravitinos depending on whether the effective projection @xmath60 is aligned with the other projections : this is in turn dependent on the choice of structure constant , so that ultimately the breaking of susy is associated with breaking by discrete torsion .      to evaluate the cosmological constant , at given radii @xmath61 , one must integrate each @xmath62 term ( weighted by its coefficient @xmath63 ) in the total 1-loop partition function over the fundamental domain @xmath64 of the modular group : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the number of uncompactified spacetime dimensions , and @xmath67 is the reduced string scale . henceforth @xmath68 is set to 1 ; it can be reinserted by dimensional analysis at the end of the calculation if desired .",
    "the integral splits into upper ( @xmath69 ) and lower regions of the fundamental domain . only terms for which @xmath70 can receive contributions from both regions , with the @xmath71 integral yielding zero in the upper region when @xmath72 , enforcing level matching in the infra - red ( but allowing contributions from unphysical proto - graviton modes in the ultra - violet as described in ref.@xcite ) .    at general radius the evaluation of the cosmological constant is complicated immensely by the fact that @xmath73 vary with @xmath11 . in order to make the evaluation tractable",
    ", the total partition function , @xmath74 , has to be rearranged into separate bosonic and fermionic factors as follows .",
    "it is convenient to define @xmath75 and @xmath76 .",
    "twisted sectors are not required in this implementation as they do not contribute to the cosmological constant , although we will comment on them later when we come to generalise the construction .",
    "we have@xmath77 where @xmath78\\big\\}\\ , , \\ ] ] and @xmath79 in the above the coefficients of the partition function are given by @xmath80\\big\\}\\ , c^\\alpha_\\beta\\ , , \\",
    "] ] where @xmath81 are the coefficients of the original theory before cdc , namely @xmath82\\ , .\\ ] ]    it is convenient to use the resummed version of this expression ; certainly for the @xmath83-expansion this is the preferred method as it makes modular invariance explicit .",
    "this removes the @xmath84 prefactor and adds a factor of @xmath85 . the bosonic factor in the partition function @xmath86",
    "depend upon the radii of compactification , the winding and resummed kk numbers and the cdc induced shift in the kk levels , @xmath42 , as follows : @xmath87 the effective shift in the kk number , given by the requisite @xmath88 , arises from the choice of @xmath89 , which gives an overall phase @xmath90 in the partition function ; as we shall see this shift in the kk number ultimately amounts to introducing a new vector @xmath91 in the non - compact @xmath2-dual theory at zero radius , combined with structure constants @xmath92 , @xmath93 .",
    "note that this means in the 4d spectrum one may find states with 1/4-charges @xmath94 , that since they have @xmath95 , become infinitely massive in the zero radius limit .    in order to reorder the sum to do it efficiently , a projection in the @xmath96 on @xmath44",
    "is now introduced to select possible values of @xmath42 .",
    "the parameter for this projection will be called @xmath97 .",
    "thus overall one can write,@xmath98 where @xmath99 note that the phases in @xmath100 are precisely what is needed to cancel the contribution coming from the theta functions in @xmath101 , so that overall the spectrum is merely shifted , with the gso projections remaining independent of @xmath29 .",
    "the bosonic contribution to the total partition function is independent of the fermionic sectors within the theory so @xmath102 appears as a pre - factor to the sector sum for any given @xmath42 .",
    "conversely , the fermionic partition function is composed of terms that depend upon the boundary conditions of the fermions within the sectors @xmath103 and is independent of the compactification radii .",
    "the advantage of this reordering is that one can therefore collect 16 representative @xmath104 factors ( @xmath105 ) , @xmath106 which are independent of the radii , and 16 representative @xmath23 factors ( @xmath105 ) , @xmath107 + the latter are radius dependent interpolating functions , analogous to the functions @xmath108 in the simple circular case studied in ref.@xcite .",
    "the total partition function is then compiled by summing over the 16 @xmath109 sectors as @xmath110      an interesting aspect of the above approach is that in the small radius limit , that part of the spectrum with @xmath95 mod(1 ) decouples and can be discarded , leaving the partition function of the non - compact @xmath0 theory at @xmath111 .",
    "indeed , poisson resumming on @xmath112 and @xmath113 gives @xmath114 where the ellipsis indicate terms that are further exponentially suppressed .",
    "thus the total untwisted partition function in the small radius limit can be expressed as @xmath115 note that @xmath116 is simply the expected volume factor of the partition function in the @xmath2-dual @xmath0 theory . in conjunction with the fermionic component of the partition function ,",
    "this then reproduces a @xmath0 model with an additional basis vector @xmath29 , appearing in the sector definitions as @xmath117 , and with eq.([newgso ] ) providing a new gso projection , namely @xmath118 mod  ( 1 ) .",
    "( the mod  ( 1 ) comes courtesy of the sum over @xmath39 . )    upon inspection therefore , we are finding that eq.([newgso ] ) _ is actually _ the gso projection of an additional vector @xmath91 in the non - compact @xmath0 theory . beginning with the choice of @xmath119",
    ", one can infer that the @xmath0 theory at zero radius for the examples we have been considering has structure constants @xmath92 and @xmath93 , consistent with the modular invariance rules of klst in refs.@xcite .",
    "in fact identifying sectors as @xmath120 with @xmath121 mod(2 ) , the entire partition function at zero radius is that of the @xmath0 theory with the appropriate corresponding gso phases , @xmath122    reversing the line of reasoning above , leads us finally to a generalisation of the construction of interpolating models based on the modular invariance of their endpoint @xmath0 theories :    * first , define a @xmath0 theory in terms of a set of vectors @xmath18 , and _ any _ additional @xmath91 vector that obeys the @xmath0 modular invariance rules of ref.@xcite , together with a set of consistent structure constants @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "( the @xmath123 are then fixed by the modular invariance rules in the usual way . ) * in theories that have an additional @xmath125 orbifold action @xmath126 on compactification to @xmath1 , @xmath91 is still constrained by the need to preserve mutually consistent gso projections , with the condition @xmath127 ( as in refs.@xcite and discussed in ref.@xcite ) . *",
    "the partition function is then in the form of eqs.([mini1]),([mini2 ] ) with coefficients as in eq.([eq : be ] ) . the projection obtained by performing",
    "the @xmath128 sum determines the corresponding kk shift to be @xmath129    to prove that these rules are consistent with modular invariance , one may first poisson - resum back to the original expression but retaining @xmath128 , so that entire partition function is @xmath130 note that the sum over @xmath42 provides a projection that equates @xmath131 mod(1 ) .",
    "it is then straightforward to show that the partition function is invariant under @xmath132 provided that @xmath133 and invariant under @xmath134 provided that @xmath135 this overall set of conditions is precisely that of klst @xcite with the original theory enlarged to include the vector @xmath91 .",
    "@xmath136    note that these rules are significantly more general than those of refs.@xcite , in which the choice @xmath137 corresponds to taking @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "now for example the cdc vectors are no longer restricted to obey @xmath138  mod(1 ) , and moreover the kk shifts have additional sector dependence if @xmath139 .",
    "we should add that , as well as being a generalisation , these rules simplify the construction of viable phenomenological models , because the @xmath127 condition can be implemented independently , with consistency then guaranteed with respect to all the other @xmath18 vectors .",
    "one can also conclude that for consistency a theory that is scherk - schwarzed on an orbifold should contain additional sectors that are twisted under the action of both the orbifold and the scherk - schwarz  i.e. twisted sectors that have non - zero @xmath140 .",
    "of course @xmath140 for such sectors has no association with any windings , but one finds that those sectors ( which being twisted are supersymmetric ) are required for consistency ( anomaly cancellation for example ) .",
    "let us now move on to the conditions under which the endpoint theories exhibit susy .",
    "we will always consider models in which the theory at infinite radius is supersymmetric ( as would be evidenced by the vanishing of the cosmological constant there ) but we would like to determine whether or not susy is restored at zero radius as well . in this section",
    "we develop arguments to address this question based on the existence or otherwise of massless gravitinos as @xmath33 .    as usual the pure neveu - schwarz ( ns - ns ) sector , @xmath141 gives rise to the gravity multiplet , @xmath142 ( the graviton ) , @xmath143 ( the dilaton ) and @xmath144}$ ] ( the two index antisymmetric tensor ) , from the states @xmath145 in the notation of ref.@xcite .",
    "these states are chargeless under @xmath146 and no projection on them can occur , since the cdc vector is always zero in the @xmath1 space - time dimensions @xmath147 . given the inevitable presence of the graviton , the susy properties of the theory are then dictated by the presence or absence of the r - ns gravitinos , namely @xmath148 their scherk - schwarz projections are determined purely by the scherk - schwarz action on the right - moving degrees of freedom    the spectrum is found from the expressions for the modified virasoro operators in eq.([eqn : virasoro_2 ] ) . for the non - winding gravitinos , the shifted kk momentum becomes virtually continuous in the @xmath149 limit and the full @xmath0 gravitino state is inevitably recovered there .",
    "the scale at which susy is spontaneously broken by the cdc is set by the gravitino mass @xmath150 . as the compactification is turned on",
    ", the susy of the @xmath0 theory is broken , and then towards the @xmath33 end of the interpolation , new gravitinos may or may not appear in the massless spectrum , perhaps heralding the restoration of susy at small radius as well .    to see if they do ,",
    "consider how the cdc modifies the theories that sit at the endpoints of the interpolation .",
    "we denote by @xmath151 the charge of the lightest gravitino state at large radius .",
    "susy is exact even in the presence of @xmath29 , with the state @xmath151 being exactly massless , if both the first and second terms in the modified virasoro operators of eq.([eqn : virasoro_2 ] ) , namely @xmath152 and @xmath153 vanish .",
    "( for convenience we continue for this discussion to use the original more restrictive rules of refs.@xcite ; it would be trivial to extend the discussion to the more general rules of eq.([eq : genrule ] ) . ) with @xmath154 , the first term receives no extra contribution due to the cdc . furthermore , there is no winding contribution to the second term .",
    "therefore gravitinos that have @xmath155 remain massless and indicate the presence of exact susy .",
    "conversely , if the only remaining gravitinos have @xmath156 their mass is @xmath157 and susy is spontaneously broken .    without loss of generality",
    ", one can consider susy breaking to amount to a conflict between @xmath26 and a single basis vector , denoted by @xmath158 .",
    "that is , @xmath158 constrains the gravitinos , while the remaining @xmath18 can not project them out of the theory . in order for the above light ( but not massless ) gravitino to be the one that is left un - projected , the projections due to @xmath159 and @xmath158 must disagree , that is the massive @xmath160 state is retained by @xmath158 while the massless @xmath155 state is projected out . again without loss of generality , it is always possible to choose @xmath158 so that the conditions are aligned ; that is @xmath161 .",
    "these modes are preserved ( and have a mass @xmath162 ) while @xmath158 projects the massless @xmath163 modes out of the theory entirely .",

    "as described in the previous section , the requirement that the kk term in eq.([eqn : virasoro_term_2 ] ) vanishes forms an effective projection that constrains the light states at zero radius , selecting the modes for which @xmath167 where we will assume that @xmath168 .",
    "it is clear from the relation between @xmath169 and @xmath170 in eq.([eqn : modified_q_psi ] ) that the projection due to the cdc vector remains unchanged for any gravitino state there , since @xmath171 ; that is @xmath172 this equation together with eqs.([eqn : modified_projection ] ) and ( [ gravcon ] ) , imply that any gravitino of the spontaneously broken theory that becomes light at small radius must be an odd - winding mode . under the shift in @xmath44 given by eq.([eqn : modified_q_psi ] ) , the @xmath158 projection constraining the gravitinos is @xmath173 for the effective projection in eq.(@xmath174 ) to agree with the modified gso condition in eq.([eqn : modified_gso_condition ] ) for @xmath175 , we then require that @xmath176 eq.([cond1 ] ) is a necessary condition for a model with susy spontaneously broken by the scherk - schwarz mechanism to have massless gravitino states in both the infinite and zero radius limits .",
