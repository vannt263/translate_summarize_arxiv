    "the entanglement , possibly the most remarkable feature of quantum mechanics , represents a fundamental resource for quantum information processing @xcite , and the concept of bipartite and multipartite entanglement is nowadays well - stated for quantum systems composed of distinguishable constituents . for an entangled system it is impossible to factor its state in a product of independent states describing its parts . on the other hand",
    "the notion of entanglement is more controversial in systems of identical particles @xcite .",
    "the entanglement of such systems is investigated at present in many areas of physics , like quantum optics , quantum charge transport in semiconductor , ultracold gases @xcite . here",
    "the difficulties appear in the definition of a criterion able to classify and quantify the entanglement .",
    "they are mainly due to the exchange symmetry which requires the antisymmetrization or symmetrization of the quantum wavefunctions describing fermions or bosons , respectively .",
    "different methods to treat the quantum entanglement in systems of indistinguishable particles are present in literature . in the approach developed by wiseman and vaccaro  @xcite",
    "the entanglement of the particles is a sort of accessible entanglement , i.e. the maximum value of the entanglement that could be extracted from the system and placed in quantum registers , from which it could be used to perform quantum information processing . in the theory introduced by zanardi the entanglement",
    "should be evaluated by using the density matrix in a mode - occupation represention and is based on the formal mapping of the fock space into states of qubits @xcite . the method proposed by schliemann",
    "is based on the slater rank of the state ( i.e. the minimum number of slater determinants needed to express it ) as a counterpart of the schmidt rank criterion usually adopted for distinguishable particles @xcite .",
    "this latest approach has been recently reexamined by other authors , which , for the case of a two - particle pure state , have suggested to evaluate quantitatively the entanglement as the von neumann entropy ( vne ) of the one - particle reduced density matrix @xcite . here",
    "the quantum correlations due to symmetrization or antisymmetrization of the wavefunction do not represent a genuine manifestation of quantum entanglement @xcite .",
    "therefore from this point of view such a criterion results to be the natural generalization of the approach commonly used to treat quantum correlations in systems of distinguishable particles .    following the basic concepts of the approach proposed by schliemann @xcite in this paper we discuss an entanglement criterion for two - fermion systems .",
    "it is still based on the analogous of the schmidt decomposition theorem for the pure fermion state but requires the calculation of the linear entropy ( le ) of the one - particle reduced density matrix .",
    "we intend to establish whether the le can be considered a valid measure of the lack of knowledge about the quantum state describing the system , which should include not only the uncertainty due to the impossibility of attributing a definite state to each particle but also the amount of uncertainty deriving from the indistinguishability of the particles . in order to get a better understanding of this criterion",
    ", we first apply it to study a simple prototype theoretical model , then we analyze a system of physical interest , namely a two - electron scattering event in a 2d semiconductor structure .",
    "the entanglement dynamics in such a system has been recently investigated in terms of the vne @xcite and a comparison with previous results lead to the conclusion that the le can be an efficient and still valid entanglement measure for binary collisions , as for other physical phenomena of interest in quantum - information processing where identical particles are involved .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ pri ] we describe the main properties of the le as an entanglement measure for two - fermion systems . in sec .",
    "[ pri2 ] we evaluate numerically the time evolution of the le for a scattering event between a free propagating and a bound electron in a two - dimensional system considering different spin configurations .",
    "conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "in this section we introduce the entanglement criterion for two - fermion systems based on the concept of le , usually applied to distinguishable particles .",
    "furthermore we compare quantitatively such a criterion with the one based on the vne in the case of a simple system with @xmath1 degrees of freedom .",
    "a pure state of two fermions can be written as @xcite : @xmath2 and @xmath3 are the annihilation and creation operators of the mode @xmath4 satisfying the usual fermionic ( anti)commutation rules @xmath5 , and @xmath6 is the vacuum state .",

    "the number of coefficients @xmath19 that are different from zero is the so - called slater rank , which can be related to the entanglement as follows : a state with slater rank equal to 1 ( i.e. that can be written as a single slater determinant ) is non - entangled , a state with slater rank greater than 1 is a linear combination of two or more slater determinants , therefore it can be considered entangled .",
    "many alternative ways of defining a function apt at evaluating the lack of knowledge about a subsystem have been proposed in the literature among them the tsallis entropy @xcite generalizes the concept of the vne , encompassing , among the others le .",
    "it is defined as @xcite : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a real , not necessary positive , number . in the case of @xmath21 tending to",
    "1 one obtains the well known vne @xmath22 which satisfies some standard properties as concativity , additivity and sub - additivity , and which is acknowledged to be a good quantum correlation measure of a pure two - fermion state .",

    "( [ tsal ] ) reduces to @xmath23 , that is the le @xcite . in this paper",
    "we focus on such a quantity as a measure of the entanglement in systems of indistinguishable particles .",
    "even if le is not additive in the usual sense as shown in ref.@xcite , it has some interesting properties so far not fully exploited .",
    "in fact it turns out to be extremely valuable for the application of numerical methods , as detailed in the following .    in terms of le the quantum entanglement of the pure two - fermion state @xmath12 defined in eq .",

    "this aspect appears to be relevant since the complexity of many systems of physical interest practically prevents the diagonalization of the corresponding density matrix .",
    "furthermore we note that eq .",
    "( [ kkkii ] ) is represention - independent since the trace is invariant with respect to unitary single - particle transformations .    by using the above trace operations we can also express @xmath25 in terms of the eigenvalues @xmath15 of the one - particle density matrix @xmath11 in order to compare the expression of the le with the one of the vne . by taking into account",
    "the above mentioned property for @xmath15 , we find for the former that @xmath26 while , as shown in the literature @xcite , the latter can be written as @xmath27 we stress that eq .",

    "we have @xmath29 while all the other coefficients are zero and therefore @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "the fact that the minimum value of the two measures is not 0 , differently from what happens for the distinguishable particles case , is related to the unavoidable correlations due to the exchange symmetry .",
    "since the quantum correlations related only to antisymmetrization of the state of two fermions can not be used to violate bell s inequality and are not a resource for quantum - information processing ( as shown in previous works @xcite ) a state with slater rank equal to 1 can be considered as non - entangled . as a consequence",
    "we will assume that a value @xmath30 indicates a non - entangled state .",
    "for a maximum correlated state it holds @xmath32 @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "we note that in the case of a two - fermion system with a very large number @xmath1 of modes , the maximum value of the le tends asymptotically to 1 with a power law as for distinguishable particles .    in order to compare some properties of the le and vne here",
