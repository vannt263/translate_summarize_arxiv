    "there is considerable amount of observational evidence to suggest that about 25 per cent of the energy density in the universe is contributed by self gravitating system of dark matter particles .",
    "the smooth , average , energy density of these particles contributes to the expansion of the universe while any small deviation from the homogeneous energy density will lead to gravitational clustering .",
    "one of the central problems in cosmology is to describe the non linear phases of this gravitational clustering starting from a initial spectrum of density fluctuations .",
    "it is often enough ( and necessary ) to use a statistical description and relate different statistical indicators ( like the power spectra , @xmath0th order correlation functions etc . ) of the resulting density distribution to the statistical parameters ( usually the power spectrum ) of the initial distribution .",
    "the relevant scales at which gravitational clustering is non linear are less than about 10 mpc ( where 1 mpc @xmath1 cm is the typical separation between galaxies in the universe ) while the expansion of the universe has a characteristic scale of about few thousand mpc .",
    "hence , non linear gravitational clustering in an expanding universe can be adequately described by newtonian gravity provided the rescaling of lengths due to the background expansion is taken into account .",
    "as to be expected , cosmological expansion introduces several new factors into the problem as compared to the study of statistical mechanics of isolated gravitating systems .",
    "( for a general review of statistical mechanics of gravitating systems , see @xcite . for a sample of different approaches ,",
    "see @xcite and the references cited therein .",
    "review of gravitational clustering in expanding background is available in several textbooks in cosmology @xcite . ) ( a ) the problem has now become time dependent and it will be pointless to look for equilibrium solutions in the conventional sense of the word .",
    "( b ) on the other hand , the expansion of the universe has a civilizing influence on the particles and acts counter to the tendency of gravity to make systems unstable .",
    "( c ) in any small local region of the universe , one would assume that the conclusions describing a finite gravitating system will still hold true approximately .",
    "in that case , particles in any small sub region will be driven towards configurations of local extrema of entropy ( say , isothermal spheres ) and towards global maxima of entropy ( say , core - halo configurations ) .",
    "it is not clear how these effects and cosmological expansion interact with each other at intermediate length scales .",
    "though this problem can be tackled in a ` practical ' manner using high resolution numerical simulations , such an approach hides the physical principles which govern the behaviour of the system . to understand the physics ,",
    "it is necessary to attack the problem from several directions using analytic and semi analytic methods .",
    "several such attempts exist in the literature based on zeldovich(like ) approximations @xcite , path integral and perturbative techniques @xcite , nonlinear scaling relations @xcite and many others . in spite of all these it is probably fair to say that we still do not have a clear analytic grasp of this problem , mainly because each of these approximations have different domains of validity and do not arise from a central paradigm .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to attack the problem from a different angle , which has not received much attention in the past .",
    "the approach begins from the dynamical equation for the the density contrast in the fourier space and casts it as an integro - differential equation .",
    "this equation is known in the literature ( see , e.g. @xcite ) but has received very little attention because it is not ` closed ' mathematically ; that is , it involves variables which are not natural to the formalism and thus further progress is difficult .",
    "i will , however , argue that there exists a natural closure condition for this equation based on zeldovich approximation thereby allowing us to write down a _ closed _ integro - differential equation for the gravitational potential in the fourier space .",
    "it turns out that this equation can form the basis for several further investigations .",
    "in fact , one purpose of this paper  which is probably somewhat more pedagogical than is usual  is to draw the attention of the community to this approach and encourage further investigations based on this equation and ansatz .    given the validity of the ansatz , several conclusions follow in a straight forward manner . for example , i will describe how different aspects of non linear gravitational clustering ( which are well known in the literature ) can all be obtained by taking suitable limits of this equation .",
    "what is more important , the structure of this integro - differential equation allows one to understand the key issue of transfer of power from one scale to another in non linear gravitational clustering . if the initial power spectrum is sharply peaked in fourier space , in a _",
    "shell _ of radius @xmath2 , then the non linear gravitational clustering allows for both cascading ( to smaller length scales ) _ and inverse _ cascading ( to larger length scales ) of the power during the evolution .",
    "the formalism developed here shows that the inverse cascading leads to the well known @xmath3 tail at small wave numbers ( that is , at large spatial scales ) .",
    "again , while this result is known , the derivation given here is new and appears to be simple , straightforward and does not require any other extra ad - hoc assumption .",
    "the cascading of power , on the other hand , proceeds broadly through the generation of harmonics at @xmath4 etc . with the mode coupling quickly leading to a universal power spectrum .",
    "these results agree with numerical simulations done in the past @xcite .",
    "finally , it turns out that one can obtain scale free solution to the integro - differential equation and analyse its asymptotic properties completely .",
    "this study shows some striking similarities between nonlinear gravitational clustering of collisionless particles in an expanding universe and standard fluid turbulence .",
    "this application as well as its verification in numerical simulations will be described in a separate paper @xcite .",
    "the expansion of the universe sets a natural length scale ( called the hubble radius ) @xmath5 which is about 4000 mpc in the current universe . since the non linear effects due to gravitational clustering occur at significantly smaller length scales , it is possible to use newtonian gravity to describe these phenomena . in any region which is small compared to @xmath6",
    "one can set up an unambiguous coordinate system in which the _ proper _ coordinate of a particle @xmath7 satisfies the newtonian equation @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the gravitational potential .",
    "expanding @xmath10 and writing @xmath11 where @xmath12 is due to the smooth ( mean ) density of matter and @xmath13 is due to the perturbation in the density , we get @xmath14 the first terms on both sides of the equation @xmath15 should match since they refer to the global expansion of the background frw universe . equating them individually gives the results @xmath16 where @xmath13 is the gravitational potential generated by the _",

    "hence , the equations for gravitational clustering in an expanding universe , in the newtonian limit , can be summarized by @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the smooth background density of matter and @xmath22 is the trajectory of the @xmath23th particle .",
    "we stress that , in the non - relativistic limit , the perturbed potential @xmath13 satisfies the usual poisson equation with the perturbed density contrast as the source .",
    "usually one is interested in the evolution of the density contrast @xmath24 rather than in the trajectories .",
    "since the density contrast can be expressed in terms of the trajectories of the particles , it should be possible to write down a differential equation for @xmath25 based on the equations for the trajectories @xmath26 derived above .",
    "it is , however , somewhat easier to write down an equation for @xmath27 which is the spatial fourier transform of @xmath25 . to do this , we begin with the fact that the density @xmath28 due to a set of point particles , each of mass @xmath29 , is given by @xmath30\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is the trajectory of the ith particle . to verify the @xmath32 normalization",

    "gravitational clustering in an expanding universe brings out an interesting feature about gravity which can be described along the following lines .",
    "let us consider a large number of particles which are interacting via gravity in an expanding background and forming bound gravitating systems . at some time @xmath67 ,",
    "let us assume that a fraction @xmath68 of the particles are in virialized , self - gravitating clusters ( of typical size @xmath69 , say ) which are reasonably immune to the effect of expansion .",
    "imagine that we replace each cluster by a single particle at its center of mass with the mass equal to the total mass of the cluster .",
    "( the total number of particles have now been reduced but , if the original number was sufficiently large , we may assume that the resulting number of particles is again large enough to carry on further evolution with a valid statistical description . )",
    "we now evolve the resulting system to a time @xmath70 and compare the result with what would have been obtained if we had evolved the original system directly to @xmath70 .",
    "obviously , the characteristics of the system at small scales ( corresponding to the typical size @xmath69 of the clusters at time @xmath67 ) will be quite different .",
    "however , at large scales ( @xmath71 ) , the characteristics will be the same both the systems .",
    "in other words , the effect of a bunch of particles , in a virialized cluster , on the rest of the system is described , to the lowest order , by just the monopole moment of the cluster  which is taken into account by replacing the cluster by a single particle at the center of mass having appropriate mass . in this sense ,",
    "gravitational interactions are `` renormalizable ''  where the term is used in the specific sense defined above .",
    "the result has been explicitly verified in simulations but one must emphasize that the whole idea of numerical simulations of such systems tacitly _ assumes _ the validity of this result . if the detailed non linear behaviour at small scales , say within galaxies , influences very large scale behaviour of the universe ( say , at super cluster scales ) , then it will be impossible to study the large scale structure in the universe with simulations of finite resolution .",
    "one may wonder how this feature ( renormalizability of gravity ) is taken care of in eq .",
    "( [ exev ] ) . inside a galaxy cluster , for example",
    ", the velocities @xmath72 can be quite high and one might think that this could influence the evolution of @xmath54 at all scales .",
    "this does not happen and , to the lowest order , the contribution from virialized bound clusters cancel in @xmath73 .",
    "we shall now provide a proof of this result ( also see @xcite ) .",
    "we begin by writing the right hand side @xmath74 of the eq .",
    "( [ basic ] ) concentrating on the particles in a given cluster .",

    "let us now consider the first term in the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ altone ] ) with the origin of the coordinate system shifted to the center of mass of the cluster .",
    "expanding the exponential as @xmath84 where @xmath69 is the size of the cluster , we find that in the first term , proportional to @xmath85 , the sum of the forces acting on all the particles in the cluster ( due to self gravity ) vanishes .",
    "the second term gives , on symmetrization , @xmath86 using eq .",
    "( [ alttwo ] ) we find that @xmath87 the second term is of order @xmath88 and can be ignored , giving @xmath89 consider next the second term in the right hand side of ( [ altone ] ) with the same expansion for the exponential .",

    "( [ altone ] ) cancel each other for all particles in the same virialized cluster ; that is , to the order @xmath88 , the term @xmath92 receives contribution only from particles which are not bound to any of the clusters .",
    "if the typical size of the clusters formed at time @xmath67 is @xmath69 , then for wave - numbers with @xmath93 , we can ignore the contribution from the clusters .",
    "hence , in the limit of @xmath94 we can ignore @xmath95 term and treat equation eq .",
    "( [ exev ] ) as linear in @xmath54 ; large spatial scales in the universe can be described by linear perturbation theory even when small spatial scales are highly non linear .",

    "( [ exev ] ) one is comparing the first term ( which is linear in @xmath54 ) with the contribution @xmath95 . if , at the relevant wavenumber , the first term @xmath96 is negligibly small , then the _ only _ contribution will come from @xmath95 and , of course , we can not ignore it in this case .",
    "the above discussion shows that this contribution will scale as @xmath97 and will lead to a development of @xmath98 if originally ( in linear theory ) @xmath99 with @xmath100 as @xmath101 .",
    "we shall say more about this later on .",
    "clearly , we can ignore the contribution from particles in virialized clusters in estimating @xmath102 .",
    "we will next consider how we can estimate the effect of remaining particles .",
    "a useful insight can be obtained by examining the nature of particle trajectories which lead to the growth of the density contrast @xmath103 in the linear limit . to determine the particle trajectories corresponding to the linear limit ,",
    "let us start by writing the trajectories in the form @xmath104 where @xmath83 is the lagrangian coordinate ( indicating the original position of the particle ) and @xmath105 is the displacement .",
    "the corresponding fourier transform of the density contrast is given by the general expression @xmath106\\ ] ] in the linear regime , we expect the particles to have moved very little and hence we can expand the integrand in the above equation in a taylor series in @xmath107 .",
    "this gives , to the lowest order , @xmath108 showing that @xmath109 is fourier transform of @xmath110 .",
    "this allows us to identify @xmath111 with the original density contrast in real space @xmath112 .",
    "using the poisson equation we can write @xmath113 as a divergence ; that is @xmath114 which , in turn , shows that a consistent set of displacements that will lead to @xmath115 is given by @xmath116 the trajectories in this limit are , therefore , linear in @xmath117 : @xmath118    a useful approximation to describe the quasi linear stages of clustering is obtained by using the trajectory in eq.([trajec ] ) as an ansatz valid _ even at quasi linear epochs_. in this approximation , ( called zeldovich approximation ) , the proper eulerian position @xmath119 of a particle is related to its lagrangian position @xmath120 by @xmath121 \\label{lagq}\\ ] ] where @xmath122 is the comoving eulerian coordinate .",
    "if the initial , unperturbed , density is @xmath123 ( which is independent of @xmath124 , then the conservation of mass implies that the perturbed density will be @xmath125 as is well known , this suggests that sheet like structures , or ` pancakes ' , will be the first nonlinear structures to form when gravitational instability amplifies density perturbations .",
    "we now combine the two results obtained above in order to suggest a closure condition for our dynamical equation .",
    "we begin by noting that at any given moment of time we can divide the particles in the system into two sets - those which are already a part of virialized cluster and those which are not . of these , we know that the first set of particles do not contribute significantly to @xmath92 so we will not incur any serious error in ignoring these particles in computing @xmath92 . for the description of particles in the second set , the zeldovich approximation should be fairly good .",
    "in fact , we can do slightly better than the standard zeldovich approximation .",
    "we note that in eq .",
    "( [ lagq ] ) the velocities were taken to be proportional to the gradient of the _ initial _ gravitational potential .",
    "we can improve on this ansatz by taking the velocities to be given by the gradient of the _ instantaneous _ gravitational potential which has the effect of incorporating the influence of particles in bound clusters on the rest of the particles to certain extent .",
    "given this ansatz , it is straightforward to obtain a _ closed _ integro - differential equation for the gravitational potential along the following lines .",
    "the trajectories in zeldovich approximation , given by eq .",
    "( [ trajec ] ) leads to : @xmath126 to the same order of accuracy , @xmath127 in eq .",
    "( [ exevii ] ) becomes : @xmath128 substituting these expressions in eq .",
    "( [ powtransf ] ) we find that the gravitational potential is described by the closed integral equation : @xmath129 this equation provides a powerful method for analyzing non linear clustering since estimating @xmath130 by zeldovich approximation has a very large domain of applicability .    at this stage ,",
    "the validity of the above equation rests on the conjectured validity of the ansatz used in approximating the trajectories .",
    "though i have given a brief argument to motivate this ansatz , its ultimate validity can be tested only by numerical simulations as well as by working out the consequences of the equations .",
    "the rest of the paper works out several analytical results which can be obtained from the above equation .",
    "we have also performed detailed numerical simulations to check the above ansatz and some of these results will be presented elsewhere @xcite . for the propose of this paper , i merely state that the numerical simulations show that this ansatz has a wide domain of applicability .    in the next two sections",
    ", i will use this equation to study the following important questions : suppose power was injected into a self gravitating system at a fixed length scale [ that is , the initial power spectrum is @xmath131 .",
    "how does the non linear evolution transfer the power to other wave numbers ?",
    "the corresponding question in fluid turbulence is very well studied and we know that for a wide range of scales the final spectrum is the standard kolmogorov spectrum . in the next two sections , we shall investigate some aspects of this problem using the above formalism .",
    "there is an interesting and curious result which is characteristic of gravitational clustering that can be obtained directly from our eq .",
    "( [ powtransf ] ) . consider an initial power spectrum which has very little power at large scales ; more precisely",
    ", we shall assume that @xmath132 dies faster than @xmath3 for small @xmath133 .",

    "this requires @xmath190 and @xmath191 showing that the power is generated exactly at the second harmonic of the wave number . spreading the initial power on a shell of radius @xmath165 , spreads the power over different vectors leading to the result obtained above .",
    "equation ( [ initcond ] ) shows that @xmath192 will reach non linearity for @xmath193 .",
    "the situation is different as regards the gravitational potential due to the large numerical factor @xmath194 ; the gravitational potential fluctuations are comparable to the original fluctuations only when @xmath195 .",
    "the purpose of this paper was to draw attention to a possible approach to study nonlinear gravitational clustering .",
    "i showed how one can obtain a closed integro - differential equation for the evolution of the gravitational potential in the fourier space .",
    "this equation shows that the nonlinear evolution of the potential at the wave number @xmath196 is essentially dictated by a two - mode coupling between modes at wave numbers @xmath197 and @xmath198 integrated over all other modes @xmath199 with a quadratic kernel . among other things , this equation is useful in studying how the power injected at a given scale flows to other scales in gravitational clustering .",
    "it is seen that the nonlinear evolution leads to a @xmath3 tail at larger spatial scales and pumps power into smaller scales through repeated generation of higher harmonics .",
    "the derivation of the dynamical equation was based on an ansatz which needs to be verified by simulations .",
    "we shall report on this aspect as well as on more detailed features of power transfer in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "there are several other obvious directions in which this formalism can be developed further .",
    "for example , one can incorporate the effect of bound clusters by adding the @xmath200 term due to the monopole moments .",
    "one can also improve the accuracy by separating the contribution from different scales in the fourier space into nonlinear @xmath201 and linear @xmath202 scales ( where @xmath203 is the scale that is going nonlinear at time @xmath67 ) and dealing with them separately .",
    "these issues are under investigation .",
    "the purpose of this brief appendix is to show how the formalism developed in the text connects up with standard spherical approximation used very often in cosmology . in our language , this approximation consists of assuming that the trajectories are homogeneous ; i.e. @xmath204 where @xmath205 is to be determined . in this case , the density contrast is @xmath206 \\equiv ( 2 \\pi)^3 \\delta_d ( \\bld k)\\delta ( t ) \\label{spheapprox}\\ ] ] where we have defined @xmath207 $ ] as the amplitude of the density contrast for the @xmath138 mode .",
    "it is now straightforward to compute @xmath208 and @xmath209 in eq.([exev ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath210\\ ] ] and @xmath211 \\nonumber \\\\   & = & -{4 \\over 3 } { \\dot \\delta^2 \\over ( 1 + \\delta ) } [ ( 2 \\pi)^3 \\delta_d ( \\bld k)]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] so that the eq .",
    "( [ exev ] ) becomes @xmath212 it is easy to show that this equation is identical to that of standard spherical approximation governed by @xmath213 if we take @xmath214 .",
    "thus our formalism allows one to reproduce all the known , standard approximations for nonlinear epochs .",
