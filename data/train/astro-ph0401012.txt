    "due to enhanced mass loss during the final stages of stellar evolution , red supergiants are surrounded by extended gas and dust envelopes . this material forms the pre - supernova circumstellar environment , or may get swept - up to form a ring nebula if the star evolves blueward to become a luminous blue variable or wolf - rayet star . in a brief phase when mass - loss peaks , these stars can have circumstellar nebulae dense enough to emit oh masers and strong thermal infrared ( ir ) emission from dust that may obscure the star ( oh / ir stars ) . among the most luminous red supergiants above 10@xmath3 l@xmath4 , only a handful in our galaxy are oh / ir stars  one of the most luminous is the m5e  ia supergiant vy canis majoris . at a distance of 1.5 kpc ( herbig 1972",
    "; lada & reid 1978 ; marvel 1997 ) , its luminosity is 10@xmath5 l@xmath4 .    vy cma is a special case among the most luminous red supergiants , because of its spectacular reflection nebula , with strong polarization ( herbig 1972 ) and intricate knotty and filamentary structure seen in _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) and ground - based ir images ( kastner & weintraub 1998 ; monnier et al .",
    "1999 ; smith et al .",
    "these studies revealed a chaotic and highly asymmetric distribution of dust in the circumstellar environment .",
    "vy cma also has strong sio , h@xmath6o , and oh maser emission ( knowles et al .",
    "1969 ; buhl et al.1974 ) .",
    "proper motions and doppler shifts of these masers have repeatedly been interpreted to suggest that vy cma is surrounded by an expanding disk - like distribution of material with the polar axis oriented northeast - southwest ( van blerkom & auer 1976 ; rosen et al.1978 ; benson & mutel 1979 , 1982 ; morris & bowers 1980 ; bowers et al .",
    "1983 ; deguchi et al .",
    "1983 ; richards et al .  1998 ) .",
    "these maser studies only probe material close to the star , and seem hard to reconcile with the severely asymmetric arrangement of knots , arcs , and chaotic filaments seen at larger radii in optical _ hst _ images ( smith et al .  2001 ; see figure 1 ) , or the asymmetric structure near the star in the ir ( monnier et al .",
    "a disk - like geometry implies axial symmetry , so perhaps the receding part of the nebula is obscured by foreground material .",
    "nebulae around red supergiants are neutral dusty reflection nebulae , without convenient diagnostics of the geometry and kinematics like the bright h@xmath7 or [ n  ii ] lines commonly used in studies of nebulae around hot stars .",
    "spectroscopically , vy cma is unique among red supergiants because the resonance lines of k  i @xmath07665 and @xmath07699 are seen strongly in emission ( wallerstein 1958 ; humphreys 1970 ; wallerstein & gonzalez 2001 ) , accompanied by p cygni absorption .",
    "the k  i lines arise in cool gas at @xmath8700 to 1000 k ( wallerstein 1958 ) , comparable to dust temperatures near the star ( monnier et al .  1999 ; smith et al .",
    "its spectrum is also unusual in that it shows emission from tio , sco , ti  i , cr  i , rb  i , ba  ii , etc .  ( joy 1942 ; wallerstein 1958 , 1986 ; hyland et al .  1969 ; wallerstein & gonzalez 2001 ) . emission from the k  i lines is sometimes seen in extended envelopes of red supergiants , including betelgeuse ( bernat & lambert 1976 ; bernat et al .",
    "1978 ; mauron et al .",
    "1984 ; plez & lambert 1994 , 2002 ) , but the extreme strength of k  i emission in the spectrum of the central star is rare .",
    "this letter reports the discovery that the previously - known k  i emission in the star s spectrum is accompanied by bright _ extended _ k  i emission from vy  cma s nebula .",
    "the k  i lines are by far the brightest emission lines throughout the ir and visual - wavelength spectrum of the nebula .",
    "k  i emission traces roughly the same spatial extent as the reflection nebula , and yields interesting clues to the kinematics and geometry of vy cma s circumstellar environment .        examining figures 2 and 3",
    ", it is obvious that the kinematic structure of k  i @xmath07699 in vy  cma s circumstellar nebula is complex , and not easily explained by spherical or axial symmetry .",
    "this is consistent with qualitative inspection of _ hst _ images of the nebula , which suggest either highly asymmetric mass ejection or selective extinction ( or both ; smith et al .",
    "2001 ; kastner & weintraub 1998 ) . in general ,",
    "bright k  i emission with strong doppler shifts is confined to within about 5@xmath9 from the star , and strong emission features can usually be associated with knots or filaments in images of the nebula ( figure 1 ) .",
    "many positions show multiple velocity components along the same line of sight , especially the bright knots like s and sw .",
    "the curved nebulous tail ( cnt ; see herbig 1972 ) shows interesting kinematic structure ( see slit position e in figure 2 , which runs along the cnt ) .",
    "near the star it is redshifted by about 20 km s@xmath2 ( compared to @xmath10 ) , and this doppler shift gradually decreases to match @xmath10 at the apex of the cnt farthest from the star .",
    "thus , the cnt might either be a bubble like arc1 moving near the plane of the sky , or an expanding equatorial ring .",
    "overall , the material with strong k  i emission and chaotic kinematic structure is seen mainly toward the southwest of the star , in the brightest part of the reflection nebula .",
    "self absorption is not uniformly distributed either .",
    "blueshifted absorption is seen in the bright central parts of the nebula near the star , and is concentrated toward the north and northeast .",
    "ratio images also showed enhanced reddening toward the northeast ( smith et al .",
    "no absorption is seen more than 1@xmath9 from the star toward the southwest direction .",
    "the narrow absorption shows a velocity gradient with position : it shifts from about @xmath120 km s@xmath2 ( heliocentric ) at a few arcseconds northwest of the star , reaching almost 0 km s@xmath2 at positions a few arcsec east of the star .    while the faint outer halo has an emission profile almost identical to that of the star ( figure 3 ) , the p cyg absorption component is missing .",
    "the k  i equivalent width in the halo is also nearly identical to the star ( table 2 ) , so at large radii this halo is probably a pure reflection nebula .",
    "however , the missing p cyg absorption component indicates that other lines of sight do not see the p cyg absorption .",
    "either the stellar wind of vy  cma is asymmetric , or the absorption is not a `` real '' p cyg component formed in the wind , but is instead localized self absorption in the nebula .      at more than 5@xmath9 from the star in most position - velocity diagrams in figure 2 ,",
    "a very faint emission component is seen at nearly the same velocity as that of the star .",
    "images of vy  cma reveal a faint , fairly uniform scattering halo extending beyond 5@xmath9 from the star as well ( smith et al .",
    "figure 3 shows an average of several different positions in this outer halo .",
    "this is not simply instrumental scattering of the bright star , because the p cyg absorption is missing in the outer parts .",
    "this outer halo may be the best tracer of the systemic velocity of vy  cma .",
    "table 2 gives the flux - weighted centroid velocity of k  i in the halo , indicating a likely systemic velocity of @xmath140.0@xmath111.5 km s@xmath2 ( heliocentric ) , or @xmath121 km s@xmath2 ( lsr ) .",
    "this agrees with various other indicators of vy  cma s systemic velocity , varying between @xmath137 and @xmath144 km s@xmath2 ( wallerstein 1986 ; bowers et al .",
    "1983 ; deguchi et al .  1983 ;",
    "reid & dickinson 1976 ; neufeld et al .",
    "1999 ; harwit & bergin 2002 ) , and is close to the systemic velocity of molecular clouds associated with the nearby cluster ngc  2362 ( @xmath118 km s@xmath2 lsr ; lada & reid 1978 ) .",
    "deep _ hst _ images of vy  cma revealed a filamentary arc about 5@xmath9 southwest of the star ( arc 1 in figure 1@xmath12 ) that provoked speculation about asymmetric , episodic mass ejection due to stellar activity ( smith et al .",
    "slit positions d , g , and h in figure 1@xmath13 were placed to study the velocity structure of arc 1 , and the results are striking .",
    "k  i emission associated with arc 1 is strongly blueshifted .",
    "interestingly , it seems to show a quasi - hubble law , perhaps composed of several clumps seen best in figure 2 g and h. its blueshift increases with separation from the star , reaching a maximum of about @xmath1440 km s@xmath2 with respect to the star at a separation of 5@xmath9 .",
    "( the emission feature at @xmath143@xmath9 and @xmath160 km s@xmath2 in figure 2 g and h may be arc 2 , consistent with the high reddening of arc 2 in images ; see smith et al .",
    "a hubble - like flow would imply a single ejection episode , strengthening the hypothesis that arc 1 is due to an asymmetric eruption from the star s surface .",
    "the pseudo ` hubble constant ' for this flow is roughly @xmath147.2 km s@xmath2 arcsec@xmath2 . without proper motions ,",
    "the projection angle out of the plane of the sky @xmath15 is unknown , but at a distance of 1.5 kpc , the observed velocity structure implies an age of @xmath16 years .",
    "the spatial extent of the k  i emission associated with arc 1 suggests that the emission line originates mainly in the filled _ interior _ of a bubble outlined by arc 1 .",
    "perhaps reflected light in images traces a thin filamentary dust shell swept up by the expanding gas emitting k  i.      neutral potassium emission has been observed in the circumstellar environment of betelgeuse as well , out to radii of roughly 50@xmath9 ( plez & lambert 2002 ) , whereas the brightest k  i reaches roughly 5@xmath9 from vy  cma .",
    "since vy  cma is about 10 times farther away , the actual radial extent of the k  i emission is comparable around these two stars .",
    "however , the k  i in vy  cma s circumstellar shell is much brighter with respect to the star ; i / i@xmath17 is a factor of 10@xmath18 to 10@xmath19 stronger in vy  cma .",
    "note that betelgeuse shows no k  i emission in the direct stellar spectrum , so plez & lambert measured @xmath20 as the continuum flux in a 1-bin ; thus , @xmath21/@xmath20 in table 2 needs to be multiplied by a factor of 4.75 ( the ew of k  i @xmath07699 for the star ) for direct comparison with betelgeuse .",
    "this relatively bright extended k  i emission is partly due to the fact that direct photospheric light from vy  cma is obscured by its own circumstellar dust ( smith et al .",
    "2001 ; kastner & weintraub 1998 ; herbig 1972 ) .",
    "perhaps even the `` stellar '' k  i emission arises in unresolved circumstellar ejecta , but appears so strong because the star is occulted .",
    "this may help explain the mystery of the unusually - bright k  i emission from vy  cma .",
    "however , understanding the physical conditions in the gas that gives rise to the bright k  i emission , the potassium abundance , the mass - loss rate , and other properties will require quantitative modeling of the observed nebular spectrum .",
