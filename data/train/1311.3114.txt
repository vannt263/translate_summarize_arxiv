    "the study of vibrational energy localization in highly excited small molecules is well known and a number of reviews have appeared [ 1 - 4 ] .",
    "the idea of localization in perfect anharmonic lattices was considered by kosevich and kovalev [ 5 ] for the case of a monatomic chain with nearest neighbor harmonic , cubic and quartic anharmonic interactions .",
    "they showed that an envelop soliton - like excitation with frequency above the top of the phonon band could exist for sufficiently weak cubic interactions .",
    "somewhat later strongly localized vibrational modes in anharmonic lattices were proposed in refs . [",
    "the realization that this new excitation phenomenon only required nonlinearity plus discreteness expanded the topic in different directions , ranging from analytical considerations [ 6 - 9 ] to md simulations [ 10 - 12 ] .",
    "the early reviews of the resulting field focused on predicting different processes [ 13 - 15 ] .",
    "these excitations , which are often referred to as intrinsic localized modes ( ilms ) , discrete breathers or discrete solitons , have now been identified in different driven physical systems including electronic and magnetic solids , josephson junctions , micromechanical arrays , optical waveguide arrays , and laser - induced photonic crystals [ 16 - 18 ] .    in numerical studies of ilms in atomic lattices",
    "different two - body potential models such as lenard - jones , born - mayer - coulomb , toda , and morse potentials as well as their combinations have been used in the past .",
    "all of these potentials show strong softening with increasing vibrational amplitude and the ilms , found in these simulations , always drop down from the optical band(s ) into the phonon gap , if there is one .",
    "( see refs .",
    "[ 19 - 22 ] , where ilms in alkali halide crystals have been calculated ) .",
    "consequently , it has been assumed that the softening of atomic bonds with increasing vibrational amplitude is a general property of crystals and therefore ilms with frequencies above the top phonon frequency can not occur .",
    "however recent inelastic neutron scattering investigation of the vibrational excitations in uranium ( @xmath0-u ) in thermal equilibrium showed some degree of localization near the top of the phonon spectrum at elevated temperatures [ 23 ] .",
    "for this to occur the pair potentials in this metal must be fundamentally different from those describing alkali halide crystals . because the electrons at the fermi surface provide an essential contribution to the screening of the ion - ion interaction in metals there is no apriori reason to expect the anharmonicities of these two very different systems to be similar .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to explore the ilm properties in nickel and niobium by starting from the embedded atom model ( eam ) .",
    "this technique allows one to find the potential energy of vibrations in metals , taking the screening effects into account [ 24,25 ] .",
    "our findings show that ilms may be expected to occur in both of these metallic crystals . in the next section",
    "we illustrate how the elastic springs of the atomic bonds are to be renormalized to give the minimal condition for localized mode production . in the small ilm amplitude limit two additive contributions to the renormalization",
    "are identified : the positive one given by the quartic anharmonicity and the negative one determined by the square of cubic anharmonicity .",
    "the ilm appears above the phonon spectrum when the first contribution exceeds the second one . for the monatomic chain with nearest neighbor interactions",
    "this condition agrees with that found by kosevich and kovalev [ 5 ] and it corresponds to a rather high ratio of quartic to cubic anharmonicities but in 3d lattices a smaller ratio is required .",
    "our calculations demonstrate that in ni and nb this ilm condition is fulfilled .",
    "the molecular dynamics simulations for nickel and for niobium confirming this result are described in section 3 followed by some conclusions in section 4 .",
    "one can readily present an argument in favor of the localized mode possibility in metals .",
    "the point is that the essential contribution to the screening of the atomic interactions in metals comes from free electrons at the fermi surface . due to their well - defined energy and the oscillating character of the wave functions of these electrons ( friedel oscillations )",
    "the resulting pair - potentials may acquire non - monotonic , or even oscillatory dependence on the atomic distance [ 26 ] .",
    "one consequence is that the ion - ion attractive force , at intermediate distances , may be enhanced resulting in an amplification of even anharmonicities for the resulting two - body potentials .",
    "this effect can counteract the underlying softening associated with the bare potentials with moderate increase of vibrational amplitudes to permit the existence of ilms above the top of the phonon spectrum .",
    "let the anharmonic potential describing the nearest neighbor interactions for a 1-d monatomic chain be represented by @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the harmonic force constant and @xmath3 , @xmath4 are the anharmonic ones , @xmath5 is the displacement of the @xmath6-th atom from its equilibrium position .",

    "these ilms are fully stable : no decay of their amplitude was observed over the last 500 periods of vibrations .",
    "a small periodic modulation of the amplitude , analogous to ni was also observed , presumably caused by the appearance of a linear local mode .",
    "the spectra of ilms for two different amplitudes of vibrations of the central bond are presented in fig . 8 and 9 ( together with the phonon spectrum ) . as expected the frequency of the ilm increases with amplitude .            to check the specificity of the above procedure we also performed calculations of ilms in nb taking into account the full potential given in ref . [ 35 ] ( including the volume - dependent second term in eq . ( 10 ) ) . at high temperatures",
    "stable ilms do exist for this model .",
    "in addition , we found that the formation of ilms in nb is favored by the expansion of the nb lattice with increasing temperature .    on the other hand , based on the relations presented here ,",
    "we have found that at least in some other metals ( e.g. in al and cu ) ilms of the type described here should not exist .",
    "indeed the values of the parameter @xmath144 in these metals at room temperature are found to be 0.3 ( al ) and 0.38 ( cu ) ( using the potentials given in ref .",
    "[ 32 ] ) . at 800",
    "k these parameters correspondingly equal 0.1 and 0.42 .",
    "all these values are much smaller than the border value 1 , which makes it unlikely that ilms of the type described here can appear in these metals .",
    "to sum up we performed an analytic and numerical study of nonlinear dynamics of ni and nb and have found that intrinsic localized modes may exist in these metals with frequencies above the top of the phonon bands .",
    "the physical reason for this is the relatively large value of even anharmonicities as compared to odd ones produced by the free electron screening of the atomic interactions . as a result , in ni and nb ( and , presumably in some other metals ) , the ion - ion attractive force , at intermediate distances is enhanced resulting in the amplification of even anharmonicities for the two - body potentials .",
    "this effect counteracts the underlying softening associated with the bare potentials with moderate increase of vibrational amplitudes to permit the existence of ilms above the top of the phonon spectrum . in our md simulations of nonlinear dynamics of ni and nb",
    "we have clearly observed ilm of this type .",
    "in addition we also observed the linear local modes associated with an ilm ; modes of this - type have been recently predicted and observed numerically for chains in ref . [",
    "according to our calculations an intrinsic localized mode in ni or in nb may have a rather small amplitude and hence a small energy of formation .",
    "we expect that in these metals ilms may be observed as a high frequency features in the phonon spectrum at high temperatures .",
    "finally we note that the precision of the existing eam models of nb is rather low [ 35 , 36 ] ; however , the eam models of ni are usually considered to be quite precise [ 31 ] .",
    "therefore the conclusions presented here about ilms in ni are expected to be more reliable than those about ilms in nb .",
    "the research was supported by etf grants no . 7741 and 7906 and by the european union through the european regional development fund ( project tk114 ) .",
