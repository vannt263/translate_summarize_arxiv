    "namely , resonant tunneling or coulomb blockade through states inside the channel and universal conductance fluctuations in the leads would induce an oscillatory behavior as well .",
    "transport via discrete modes can be excluded since the dc data ( see e.g. fig .  [ c8fig6 ]  ( c ) ) does not show quantized steps and the estimated mean free path of @xmath20 100  nm in the density range where the resonances appear , indicates that the system is not fully ballistic .",
    "further , resonant tunneling through localized states or coulomb blockade inside the constriction can not explain the experimental data because , in order to observe these effects , the resistance of the tunneling barriers is required to exceed the resistance quantum @xmath21 . as apparent in the conductance trace displayed in fig .

    "they can be viewed as originating from quantum interference of elastically scattered waves propagating along different paths , leading to a reflection amplitude fluctuating with carrier density by @xmath26 at zero temperature @xcite .",
    "ucf may be the cause of the oscillations we observe in the data of fig .",
    "[ c8fig3 ]  ( b ) and fig .  [ c8fig4 ] ( to be discussed in detail below ) .",

    "further , tunneling effects can be excluded due to the low resistance of the device .",

    "the fact that these latter oscillations appear when we modulate any of the two gates , indicates that their physical origin lies in the vicinity of both gates . since the relative lever arms are the same for the upper and the lower gate",
