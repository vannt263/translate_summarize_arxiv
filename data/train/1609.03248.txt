    "equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transitions in ensembles of complex networked systems have been a subject of intense research in the field of statistical physics and many other disciplines @xcite .",
    "owing to the inherent randomness and heterogeneity in the interacting patterns , phase transitions on complex networks are drastically different from those on regular lattices in euclidean space .",
    "examples range from the anomalous behavior of ising model @xcite to a vanishing percolation threshold @xcite and the absence of epidemic thresholds that separate healthy and endemic phases @xcite as well as explosive emergence of phase transitions @xcite .",
    "so far , unveiling the relationship between the onset of phase transitions and the topology of the underlying networks is still a topic of considerable attention .",
    "the majority - voter ( mv ) model is a simple nonequilibrium ising - like system with up - down symmetry that presents an order - disorder phase transition at a critical value of noise @xcite .",
    "since oliveira pointed out that the mv model on a square lattice belongs to the universality class of the equilibrium ising model @xcite , the model has been extensively studied in the context of complex networks , including random graphs @xcite , small world networks @xcite , scale - free networks @xcite , and some others @xcite . these results showed that the critical exponents are generally dependent on the underlying interacting substrates . however , the studies of pervious works are mainly based on numerical simulations . especially , the analytical determination of the critical noise is still lacking at present .    for this purpose , in this paper we employ the heterogeneous mean - field theory to derive the rate equation for governing the mv model s dynamics on undirected networks . according to linear stability analysis",
    ", we determine the critical point of noise @xmath0 , the onset of an order - disorder phase transition in the limit of infinite size networks @xmath10 .",
    "the analytical result shows that @xmath0 is related to the ratio of the first moment to the @xmath11 order moment of degree distribution .",
    "furthermore , we derive the langevin equation to study the effect of stochastic fluctuation on finite size networks . by solving the potential of the corresponding fokker - planck equation",
    ", we calculate the susceptibility as a function of noise and determine the effective critical noise @xmath6 on finite size networks at which the susceptibility is maximal .",
    "we find that the difference @xmath7 decays in power - law ways with @xmath8 .",
    "extensive monte carlo ( mc ) simulations are performed on diverse network types to validate the theoretical results .",
    "we consider the mv model with noise on complex networks defined by a set of spin variables @xmath12 @xmath13 , where each spin is associated to one node of the underlying network and can take the values @xmath14 .",
    "the system evolves as follows : for each spin @xmath15 , we first determine the majority spin of @xmath16s neighborhood . with probability @xmath17",
    "the node @xmath15 takes the opposite sign of the majority spin , otherwise it takes the same spin as the majority spin .",
    "the probability @xmath17 is called the noise parameter and plays a similar role of temperature in equilibrium spin systems . in this way",

    "the spin @xmath22 is flipped to @xmath14 with probability equal to @xmath23 .",
    "the elements of the adjacency matrix of the underlying network are defined as @xmath24 if nodes @xmath15 and @xmath25 are connected and @xmath26 otherwise . in the case",
    "@xmath27 , the majority - vote model is identical to the zero temperature ising model @xcite .",
    "to proceed a mean - field treatment , we first define @xmath28 as the probability that a node of degree @xmath9 is in @xmath29 state , and @xmath30 as the probability that for any node in the network , a randomly chosen nearest neighbor node is in @xmath29 state . furthermore , for any node the probability that a randomly chosen nearest neighbor node has degree @xmath9 is @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is degree distribution defined as the probability that a node chosen at random has degree @xmath9 and @xmath33 is the average degree @xcite .",
    "it is supposed to be reasonable only in networks without degree correlation .",
    "the probabilities @xmath28 and @xmath30 satisfy the relation @xmath34 thus , we can write rate equations for @xmath28 as @xmath35 where @xmath36 is is the probability that a node of degree @xmath9 takes the @xmath29 value , which can be expressed as @xmath37 here , @xmath38 is the probability that a node of degree @xmath9 with @xmath29 state takes the majority rule , which can be written by a binomial distribution , @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the ceiling function , @xmath41 is the kronecker symbol , and @xmath42 ) } } } \\right .",

    "when @xmath17 is less than a critical value @xmath0 , there are three solutions .",
    "one is at @xmath45 corresponding to a disordered phase and the other two correspond to two symmetric ordered phases . for @xmath46 , there is only one solution at @xmath47 .",
    "[ fig1 ] ]    in the steady state @xmath48 , we have @xmath49 .",
    "fig.[fig1 ] shows that the two typical examples of graphic solutions of @xmath50 . one can easily find that a trivial stationary solution , @xmath51 , always exists irrespective of the value of @xmath17 ( corresponding to a disordered phase @xmath52 ) , as @xmath53 and @xmath54",
    "however , the other two solutions are possible if @xmath17 is less than a critical value @xmath0 , and they represent the existence of two ordered phases with up - down symmetry . therefore , the critical noise @xmath0 is determined by the condition that the derivation of @xmath55 with @xmath30 equals to one at @xmath56 , i.e. , @xmath57 to do this , we rewrite approximately eq.([eq5 ] ) as @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the error function .",

    "pairs of unlinked stubs are then randomly joined .",
    "we then run the standard mc simulation : at each mc step , each node is firstly randomly chosen once on average and then make an attempt to flip spin with the probability according to eq.([eq1 ] ) .    in order to numerically obtain the @xmath0",

    "the critical noise @xmath0 is estimated as the point where the curves @xmath86 for different network sizes @xmath8 intercept each other . in our simulations , @xmath0 is determined by five different network sizes : @xmath87 , @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .    for comparison , in fig.[fig2 ]",
    "we plot the @xmath0 obtained from the theoretical prediction ( lines ) and the mc simulation ( symbols ) , respectively . in fig.[fig2](a ) and fig.[fig2](b ) , we show the results on rkrn and on errn , respectively . in fig.[fig2](c - d ) , we show the results on sfn and plot the @xmath0 as a function of @xmath79 for some fixed @xmath92 in fig.[fig2](c ) and of @xmath92 for some fixed @xmath79 in fig.[fig2](d ) . it is clearly observed that for large values @xmath9 there are an excellent agreements between the theory and simulation .",
