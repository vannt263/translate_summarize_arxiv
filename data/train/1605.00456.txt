    "einstein gravity of general relativity is one of the successful theories of @xmath0 century .",
    "although this theory can explain the dynamics of our solar system well enough , it can not describe the high curvature regimes .",
    "in other words , one may use its generalization for describing the particle motion near the black hole horizon .",
    "another problem of einstein gravity is its inaccurate result for the accelerated expansion of the universe .",
    "in addition , einstein gravity does not accommodate either mach s principle or dirac s large - number hypothesis . between various modifications of einstein gravity ,",
    "brans and dicke were pioneers in studying the alternative theories known as brans - dicke ( bd ) theory @xcite .",
    "bd theory is a straightforward way to disentangle further degrees of freedom which are not present in the usual hilbert - einstein action .",
    "regarding the four dimensional stationary bd solution , one finds it is just the kerr solution with a constant scalar field @xcite . beside the vacuum solutions , cai and myung showed that the @xmath1dimensional charged black hole solution of bd theory is just the reissner ",
    "nordstrm ( rn ) solution with a trivial scalar field @xcite .",
    "this is because the stress energy tensor of maxwell field is traceless only in @xmath1dimension , and therefore , the action of maxwell field is not invariant under the conformal transformation in higher dimensions . in order to find the differences between bd theory and einstein gravity , one may regard higher dimensions .",
    "as an example it was found that higher dimensional charged black holes in bd theory would be the rn solution with a non - trivial scalar field .",
    "classical and quantum aspects black holes and gravitational collapse in brans - dicke ( bd ) theory have been investigated in literature @xcite .",
    "another distinguishing mark of bd theory is the existence of a conformal mapping between this theory and einstein gravity .",
    "a conformal mapping is a diffeomorphism between two metrizable bundles if the pulled back bundle is conformally equivalent to the original one .",
    "the conformal transformation technique is one of the strong and useful mathematical tools for investigating the scalar - tensor theories of gravity @xcite . in other words , using conformal transformation , one can represent gravity in two conformally related frames : the jordan or string frame ( scalar field is non - minimally coupled to the metric tensor ) and the einstein frame ( scalar field is minimally coupled to the metric tensor ) @xcite .",
    "investigation of these frames enables one to explore the relation between different physical theories and hence generate the new exact solutions @xcite .",
    "in addition , it was shown that the higher - order theories of gravity can be related to the non - minimally coupled version of scalar tensor gravity @xcite . in general ,",
    "equipped with the conformal transformations enables one to investigate gravitational theories with more details since one can exchange , via these transformations , a model of gravity to another where the relations become more easier to manipulate .",
    "although there are many studies related to conformal transformation between the einstein and jordan frames , there was not a user - friendly rule for presenting mathematical properties of this transformation .",
    "furthermore , the standard coupling between dilaton and gauge fields has not been explored with a systematic details .",
    "these are our main motivations to present conformal transformation for obtaining standard gauge - gravity lagrangians with a methodical way . in this work ,",
    "we obtain a new criterion for conformal consistency of dilaton gravity coupled with electrodynamics .",
    "the main goal of the present work is finding how an arbitrary lagrangian of electrodynamics can couple with dilaton field in einstein frame . in this regard , we show that most of previous introduced lagrangians are not consistent with any bd counterpart . in order to obtain original solutions , we focus on the challenging lagrangian , dilatonic born - infeld theory , in an energy dependent spacetime , so - called gravity s rainbow .",
    "the motivation of considering gravity s rainbow comes from horava - lifshitz gravity @xcite , in which help us to regard different scaling of space and time for type iia and iib string theory @xcite , ads / cft correspondence @xcite and dilaton black objects @xcite .",
    "the relation between the horava - lifshitz gravity and gravity s rainbow was investigated in ref .",
    "gravity s rainbow is based on the modification of usual energy - momentum dispersion relation in the uv limit .",
    "it is worthwhile to mention that such modification has also been regarded in different subjects , such as : discrete spacetime @xcite , spin - network in loop quantum gravity ( lqg ) @xcite , spacetime foam @xcite , non - commutative geometry @xcite and ghost condensation @xcite .    motivated by the recent results mentioned above",
    ", we obtain the correct lagrangian of gauge - dilaton coupling with corresponding field equations .",
    "we also introduce the correct action and field equations of some interesting models of nonlinear electrodynamics in dilaton gravity .",
    "finally , we consider an energy dependent spacetime to obtain black hole solutions of bd - bi and dilatonic bi theories .",
    "the action of @xmath2- dimensional bd theory with a scalar field @xmath3 and a self - interacting potential @xmath4 in the presence of a matter field can be written as @xmath5 ,   \\label{ibd}\\]]in which @xmath6 is an arbitrary lagrangian of scalar field and its first derivative and @xmath7 is lagrangian of pure matter field with field strength @xmath8 .",
    "the standard choice for the lagrangian of scalar field is @xmath9where the first and second expressions are , respectively , characteristic as kinetic and potential terms in string frame .",
    "now , we would like to obtain electrodynamic lagrangian coupled with scalar field in einstein frame . indeed , via the conformal transformation @xcite the bd theory can be transformed into the einstein - dilaton gravity with a minimally coupled scalar dilaton field .",
    "we should note that the suitable conformal transformation comes from the fact that @xmath10 term in jordan frame should transform to @xmath11 in einstein frame .",
