    "the presence of @xmath1 noise is ubiquitous in a variety of different systems .",
    "mostly @xmath1 noise is gaussian , but sometimes the signals exhibiting @xmath1 fluctuations are non - gaussian . the non - gaussianity is often taken as a signature of fluctuator s interaction @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , statistically independent and noninteracting fluctuators may exhibit non - gaussian noise , as well @xcite , especially when the fluctuations are strong @xcite .",
    "recently we proposed stochastic models of @xmath1 noise based on the nonlinear stochastic differential equations @xcite .",
    "the models generate signals with the power - law distributions of the signal intensity and the power - law spectral densities .",
    "moreover , @xmath1 noise is often represented as a sum of independent lorentzian spectra resulting from uncorrelated components of the signal with a wide - range distribution of the relaxation times @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that summation of the spectra is allowed only if the processes with different relaxation times are isolated from each another @xcite .",
    "distribution densities of the signal components described by the linear stochastic differential equation are gaussian and the distribution density of the signal resulting from the similarly distributed components is usually gaussian as well @xcite",
    ". however , the signal consisting of the sequence of components with very different variances may be non - gaussian . in this paper we will analyze the non - gaussianity of the signals exhibiting @xmath1 noise and generated by the linear stochastic differential equations with the fluctuating relaxation rate .",

    "@xmath5 is the wiener process , @xmath6 , with @xmath7 being the @xmath8-correlated white noise , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the intensity ( standard deviation ) of the white noise . in this paper",
    "the stochastic differential equations we understand in ito interpretation .    when the relaxation rate changes very slowly , we have the signal as a sequence of signals with different relaxation rates .    we can eliminate the parameter @xmath10 by the appropriate change of the time scale , @xmath11 , while the change of the relaxation rate @xmath4 may be described by another stochastic differential equation , resulting , e.g. , in the power - law distribution of @xmath12 .",
    "therefore , we have the system of two equations , @xmath13 @xmath14    here @xmath15 determines the speed of the change of the relaxation rate @xmath12 driven by the white noise @xmath16 and the factor @xmath17 imposes the power - law distribution , @xmath18 ( with @xmath19 ) , of the relaxation rate . the diffusion - like motion of @xmath12 should be restricted in some interval , e.g. , ( 0,1 ) .",
    "then @xmath20    we can restrict the analysis of the positive @xmath2 , only , with the reflection of @xmath2 at @xmath21 .",
    "for the definite @xmath12 the distribution of @xmath2 is gaussian and the power spectrum is lorentzian , @xmath22 @xmath23 for very slow evolution of the relaxation rate @xmath12 , the resulting characteristics of the system and yields from the average of expressions and over distribution , @xmath24 , \\label{dist_gen}\\ ] ] @xmath25 here @xmath26 is the incomplete gamma function .    therefore , the simple linear stochastic equation with the additive noise , linear relaxation and the power - law distribution near zero of slowly changing relaxation rate results asymptotically in the power - law distribution of the signal , @xmath27 and power - law distribution of the low frequency spectrum .    for the uniform distribution of the relaxation rate @xmath12 ,",

    "figure [ fig : mu ] shows the dependences of distribution and the slope of the spectral density on the parameter @xmath33 . in all cases the distribution density of the signal exhibits the `` fat tail '' distributions in contrast to the short - range gaussian distribution for the fixed relaxation rate @xmath12 .    , but with @xmath34 , open circles , and @xmath35 , open squares , in comparison with eqs . and .",
