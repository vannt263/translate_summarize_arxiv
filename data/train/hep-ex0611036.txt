    "a necessary step toward understanding the structure and dynamics of strongly interacting matter is to fully understand the spectrum of excited states of the nucleon .",
    "this excitation spectrum is a direct reflection of its underlying substructure .",
    "understanding nucleon resonance excitation , and hadro - production in general , continues to provide a serious challenge to hadronic physics due to the non - perturbative nature of the theory of strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , at these energies .",
    "because of this , a number of approximations to qcd have been developed to understand baryon resonance decays .",
    "one such approach is a class of semi - relativized symmetric quark models  @xcite that invoke massive constituent quarks .",
    "these models typically predict many more nucleonic states than have been found experimentally .",
    "a possible explanation to this so - called `` missing resonance '' problem is that these nucleon resonances may have a relatively weak coupling to the pion - nucleon states through which many searches have been performed , and may , in fact , couple to other final states such as multi - pion or strangeness channels . in this work we provide an extensive set of data that may be used to search for these hidden states in strangeness electroproduction reactions .",
    "these data then provide for a complementary way in which to view the baryon resonance spectrum , as some of the `` missing '' states might be only `` hidden '' when studied in particular reactions .",
    "it could also be the case that some dynamical aspect of hadronic structure is acting to restrict the quark model spectrum of states to the more limited set established by existing data  @xcite .    beyond different coupling constants relative to single - pion production ( e.g. @xmath14 vs. @xmath15 ) ,",
    "the study of the exclusive production of @xmath0 and @xmath1 final states has other advantages in the search for missing resonances .",
    "the higher masses of the kaon and hyperons , compared to pionic final states , kinematically favor a two - body decay mode for resonances with masses near 2  gev , a situation that is experimentally advantageous .",
    "new information is also provided by comparing @xmath0 to @xmath1 .",
    "note that although the two ground - state hyperons have the same valence quark structure ( @xmath16 ) , they differ in isospin , such that intermediate @xmath17 resonances can decay strongly to @xmath0 final states , but intermediate @xmath18 states can not .",
    "because @xmath1 final states can have contributions from both @xmath17 and @xmath18 states , the hyperon final state selection constitutes an isospin filter .",
    "electro - excitation of the nucleon has served to quantify the structure of many excited states that decay to single pions .",
    "these studies have been used to test models of the internal structure of the excitations using the interference structure functions and the behavior with @xmath19 for various regions of @xmath20 .",
    "this experiment is the first to allow analogous investigations to start when the intermediate electro - excited nucleon resonances couple to kaon - hyperon final states .    the search for missing resonances requires more than identifying features in the relevant mass spectrum .",
    "it also requires an iterative approach in which experimental measurements constrain the dynamics of various hadrodynamic models .",
    "the tuned models can in turn be used to interpret @xmath21- , @xmath22- and @xmath23-channel spectra in terms of the underlying resonances .",
    "as emphasized by lee and sato  @xcite , qcd can not be directly tested with @xmath17 spectra without a model for the production dynamics .",
    "the key to constraining models and unraveling the contributing resonant and non - resonant diagrams that contribute to the dynamics , is to measure as many observables over as wide a kinematic range as possible .    in this paper , we present measurements of the separated structure functions @xmath24 ,",
    "@xmath4 , and @xmath5 for exclusive electroproduction of @xmath0 and @xmath1 final states for a range of momentum transfer @xmath19 from 0.5 to 2.8  gev@xmath10 and invariant energy @xmath20 from 1.6 to 2.4  gev , while spanning the full center - of - mass angular range of the kaon .",
    "our center - of - mass angular coverage is unprecedented .",
    "these are the first data published on exclusive @xmath25 electroproduction that extend beyond very forward kaon angles in the center of mass . at one value of @xmath19 , @xmath19= 1.0  gev@xmath10 ,",
    "we were also able to separate the unpolarized structure function , @xmath24 , into its components @xmath2 and @xmath3 using a traditional rosenbluth separation and also an alternative @xmath26 rosenbluth technique ( where @xmath7 is the transverse polarization of the virtual photon and @xmath6 is the angle between the electron and hadron planes ) . in this alternative method",
    ", we obtain the four structure functions in a single fit .",
    "this extensive data set should provide substantial constraints on the various hadrodynamic models ( discussed in section  [ sec : theory ] ) .",
    "due to the very large number of analysis bins encompassed by this work , only a portion of our available data is included here .",
    "the full set of our data is available in ref .",
    "@xcite .    after a brief review of the relevant formalism in section  [ formalism",
    "] , an overview of previous experimental work in this area in section  [ recent ] , and a brief review of the current theoretical approaches in section  [ sec : theory ] , we present our measurements made using the clas detector in hall b at jefferson laboratory ( jlab ) in sections  [ analysis ] through [ systematics ] . in section  [ results ] , the results are examined phenomenologically and compared to predictions from several models that have not been `` tuned '' to this data set .",
    "finally , we present our conclusions regarding the potential impact of these data in section  [ conclusions ] .",
    "our conclusions regarding the @xmath21-channel baryon spectrum are , unfortunately , rather limited .",
    "real progress on identifying heretofore `` missing '' resonances will only result from a judicious fitting of the theoretical and phenomenological models to these data and the remainder of the world s data on these final states .",
    "in kaon electroproduction a beam of electrons with four - momentum @xmath27 is incident upon a fixed proton target of mass @xmath28 , and the outgoing scattered electron with momentum @xmath29 and kaon with momentum @xmath30 are measured .",

    "after summing over the polarizations of the initial and final state electrons and hadrons , the virtual photon cross section can be written as :    @xmath43    in this expression , the cross section is decomposed into four structure functions , @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath5 , which are , in general , functions of @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath36 only .",
    "note that this convention for the differential cross section is not used by all authors  @xcite .",
    "each of the structure functions is related to the coupling of the hadronic current to different combinations of the transverse and longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon .",
    "@xmath44 is the differential cross section contribution for unpolarized transverse virtual photons . in the limit @xmath45",
    ", this term must approach the cross section for unpolarized real photons which only have transverse polarization .",
    "@xmath3 is the differential cross section contribution for longitudinally polarized virtual photons . @xmath4 and @xmath5 represent interference contributions to the cross section .",
    "@xmath46 is due to the interference of transversely polarized virtual photons and @xmath5 is due to the interference of transversely and longitudinally polarized virtual photons .",
    "here @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the cross sections for virtual photons having their electric vector parallel and perpendicular to the hadronic production plane , respectively .",
    "note that the term @xmath4 in electroproduction is related to the linearly polarized photon beam asymmetry in photoproduction experiments , which is defined as @xmath49 .    for the remainder of this paper we will refer to @xmath50 as the `` unseparated '' part of the cross section .",

    "hyperon electroproduction in the nucleon resonance region has remained largely unexplored .",
    "several low - statistics measurements were carried out in the 1970 s at cambridge , cornell , and desy , and focussed mainly on cross section measurements to explore differences in the production dynamics between @xmath12 and @xmath13 hyperons .",
    "the first experiment was performed at the cambridge electron accelerator  @xcite using small - aperture spectrometers in kinematics spanning @xmath19 below 1.2  gev@xmath10 , @xmath20 from 1.8 to 2.6  gev , and forward kaon angles ( @xmath51 ) .",
    "it was noted that the @xmath0 channel dominated the @xmath1 channel , with signs of a large longitudinal component in the @xmath0 channel .",
    "subsequent results from cornell  @xcite for @xmath52 2.0  gev@xmath10 and @xmath20=2.15 and 2.67  gev confirmed this observation . in this paper we show that @xmath0 dominance only occurs at forward kaon angles , and the longitudinal strength is only important at forward angles and higher @xmath20 .",
    "an experiment from desy  @xcite used a large aperture spark - chamber spectrometer to measure both reaction channels at higher @xmath20 ( @xmath53  gev ) and lower @xmath19 ( @xmath54  gev@xmath10 ) .",
    "that experiment managed the first @xmath5 and @xmath4 separations , albeit with large error bars , few data points , and considerable kinematic extrapolations to extract results at fixed values of @xmath20 , @xmath19 , and @xmath55 .",
    "the results were consistent with zero for these interference cross sections due to the large uncertainties . in this paper",
    "we show the first measurements of the structure functions with enough precision to determine non - zero interference terms .",
    "other measurements made at cornell were reported  @xcite for kaons produced at very small angles relative to the virtual photon ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the results for @xmath20 from 2.15 to 3.1  gev included improved measurements of the @xmath19 dependence of the differential cross sections over the range from 0.6 to 4.0  gev@xmath10 , showing that the @xmath1 cross section falls off much faster than the @xmath0 cross section .",
    "at that time this was explained by a vector meson dominance argument , or alternatively , as possible evidence for an isoscalar di - quark interaction that favors @xmath12 production over @xmath13 production off the proton  @xcite .",
    "another survey experiment from desy  @xcite at @xmath20=2.2  gev and @xmath57  gev@xmath10 that measured differential cross sections for the @xmath0 and @xmath1 final states , confirmed the measured @xmath19 dependence of the cross sections , but with improved statistics .",
    "our study of the @xmath19 dependence shows that this same behavior for @xmath13 production relative to @xmath12 production also occurs for larger kaon angles .    the first @xmath3/@xmath2 separation via the rosenbluth method was also made at cornell  @xcite , suggesting that @xmath3 for the @xmath0 channel is large but not dominant at forward kaon angles , as previously surmised , while it is vanishing for the @xmath1 channel . at",
    "jlab two more recent results employing the rosenbluth technique in parallel kinematics ( @xmath36=0@xmath58 ) have been completed to separate @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "the first result reported @xmath3 and @xmath2 for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 final states using the small - aperture spectrometers in hall c  @xcite .",

    "the ratio for both hyperons is about 0.4 , albeit with large uncertainties .",
    "the other existing measurement from jlab was performed in hall a for @xmath20 in the range from 1.8 to 2.14  gev with @xmath19 values of 1.9 and 2.35  gev@xmath10  @xcite .",
    "this measurement was only for the @xmath0 final state and showed that the ratio of @xmath8 was consistent with the hall c result .    in a previous clas publication using the same data presented in this work , the polarization transfer from the virtual photon to the produced @xmath12 hyperon was reported  @xcite .",
    "these observables were expected theoretically to have strong sensitivity to the underlying resonance contributions .",

    "in addition , high statistics measurements from clas of the beam - recoil hyperon polarization transfer have been completed for both the @xmath0 and @xmath1 final states  @xcite , and beam spin asymmetry measurements have been made at leps for both @xmath12 and @xmath61 hyperons @xcite .",

    "further information regarding interpretations of these data within different models is included in section  [ sec : theory ] .    given this landscape of available data on the associated production of hyperons ,",
    "it is clear that the majority of the existing electroproduction data , while spanning similar ranges of @xmath20 and @xmath19 as our data , only provide information for very forward kaon scattering angles .",
    "this new data from clas represents a significant improvement in that it covers the full kaon scattering angular range , which will allow for an in - depth investigation of the contributing @xmath21-channel and @xmath23-channel diagrams in addition to the @xmath22-channel processes to these reactions .",
    "the new clas data also provides full azimuthal coverage , which enables the first significant data sample to study the interference structure functions .",
    "these structure functions provide new and unique information on interference between the underlying resonant and non - resonant amplitudes .",
    "in addition , clas has made significant contributions to the data base with the photoproduction cross sections and polarization observables that have been published .",
    "this new set of electroproduction data allows the study of the production dynamics as a function of the mass of the virtual photon , which provides an exciting complement to the real photon data .",
    "at the medium energies used in this experiment , perturbative qcd is not yet capable of providing any analytical predictions for the differential cross sections or structure functions for kaon electroproduction . in order to understand the underlying physics , effective models",
    "must be employed that ultimately represent approximations to qcd .",
    "this paper compares the data to two different theoretical model approaches : hadrodynamic models and models based on reggeon exchange .",
    "hadrodynamic models provide a description of the reaction based upon hadronic degrees of freedom . in this approach",
    ", the strong interaction is modeled by an effective lagrangian , which is constructed from tree - level born and extended born terms for intermediate states exchanged in the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 reaction channels as shown in fig .",
    "[ feynman ] .",
    "each resonance has its own strong coupling constants and strong decay widths .",
    "a complete description of the physics processes requires taking into account all possible channels that could couple to the initial and final state measured , but the advantages of the tree - level approach are to limit complexity and to identify the dominant trends . in the one - channel , tree - level approach ,",
    "several dozen parameters must be fixed by fitting to the data , since they are poorly known and not constrained from other sources .",
    "identification of the important intermediate states or resonances is guided by existing data and quark model predictions .",
    "the coupling constants for each of the included resonances are extracted from global fits of the model calculations to the existing data base .",
    "it is common practice to use phenomenological form factors to account for the extension of the point - like interactions at the hadronic vertices  @xcite .",
    "different models typically have different prescriptions for restoring gauge invariance .",
    "the drawback of these models is the large number of exchanged hadrons that can contribute in the intermediate state of the reaction . depending on which set of resonances",
    "is included , very different conclusions about the strengths of the contributing diagrams may be reached . as stated in section  [ intro ] , the models that are employed in this work have not been `` tuned '' to our data .",
    "it should also be stated that due to the nature of these models , they have a much higher interpretative power than predictive power",
    ". therefore it will be the case that more definitive statements regarding the reaction dynamics and underlying resonant and background terms will only be possible after our data have been included in the model fits .",
    "two different hadrodynamic models are employed in this work .",
    "the first is the model of bennhold and mart  @xcite ( referred to here as bm ) and the second is model b of janssen _ et al . _",
    "@xcite ( referred to here as jb ) . in these models ,",
    "the coupling strengths have been determined mainly by fits to existing @xmath62 data ( with some older electroproduction data included in some cases ) by adding the non - resonant born terms with a number of resonance terms in the @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 reaction channels , leaving the coupling constants as free parameters .",
    "the coupling constants are required to respect the limits imposed by su(3 ) allowing for a symmetry breaking at the level of about 20% .",

    "this is especially true when the bins are large and event - weighted average values of kinematic variables can be different for different @xmath6 bins . using an integration over our model cross section , we calculate the cross section at the fixed point given its average over the bin volume .",

    "the @xmath20 spectra of the interference terms , @xmath4 and @xmath5 , show no clear structures in the region about 1.9  gev , whereas an @xmath21-channel resonance would likely be reflected in the structure of the interference terms , particularly @xmath4 .",
