    "in this article we study the annihilation of two photons into baryon - antibaryon ( @xmath2 ) pairs at large mandelstam variables @xmath3 in the handbag approach recently developed for two - photon annihilation into pairs of mesons @xcite . as in the meson case , the handbag amplitude ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : handbag ] ) factorizes into a hard @xmath4 subprocess and form factors representing moments of generalized distribution amplitudes @xcite .",
    "these distribution amplitudes are time - like versions of generalized parton distributions , which encode the soft physics information in processes such as deeply virtual  @xcite or wide - angle  @xcite compton scattering .",
    "the latter is in fact related to two - photon annihilation by crossing .",
    "it is important to realize that , since we take the @xmath2 system to have large invariant mass , the @xmath5 transition can only be soft if the additional @xmath6 and possibly gluon pairs created in the hadronization process have soft momenta . in other words ,",
    "the initial quark and antiquark must each take approximately the full momentum of one final state hadron .",
    "compared to the case of mesons , our derivation for baryons will make the additional , plausible , assumption that the process is dominated by configurations where it is the quark that approximately moves in the direction of the baryon , whereas the antiquark approximately moves in the direction of the antibaryon .",
    "this assumption is equivalent to the valence quark approximation , widely used in other contexts .",
    "for both processes , wide - angle compton scattering off baryons and two - photon annihilation into @xmath2 pairs , the handbag contribution can dominate for large but not asymptotically large mandelstam variables .",
    "asymptotically the leading - twist contribution will take over , where in contrast to the handbag mechanism all valence quarks of the involved hadrons participate in the hard scattering  @xcite .",
    "the handbag contribution formally represents a power correction to the leading - twist one .",
    "the onset of the leading - twist regime is however expected to occur for @xmath7 much larger than experimentally available .",
    "a more detailed discussion of the relation between the leading - twist and soft handbag mechanisms , and of other power suppressed contributions is given in @xcite .",
    "two - photon annihilation into hadrons pairs has also been studied for the case where one of the photons has a virtuality @xmath8 much larger than the squared invariant mass @xmath7 of the hadron pair . in this",
    "kinematics , which is complementary to the one studied in the present article , handbag factorization of the process amplitude has been shown to hold for asymptotically large photon virtualities @xcite .",
    "in other words , the handbag provides the leading - twist contribution in the limit of large @xmath8 at fixed @xmath7 .",
    "our paper is organized as follows : in sect .",

    "we have further introduced the sum @xmath18 of the baryon momenta , the invariant mass @xmath19 of the baryon pair , and the skewness @xmath20 in the following we will also use the notation @xmath21 .",
    "we have not displayed the dependence of the @xmath2 distribution amplitudes on the factorization scale @xmath22 , which is governed by the well - known evolution equations for the distribution amplitudes of a single meson with appropriate quantum numbers .",
    "the @xmath2 distribution amplitudes are the time - like versions of generalized parton distributions for a baryon @xmath23 .",

    "one may use the gordon decomposition @xmath34 with @xmath35 to trade the scalar current for the tensor one . by crossing the defining relation for @xmath24 and @xmath25",
    "one would obtain the scalar current @xmath36 multiplied with @xmath37 instead of @xmath38 . defining a distribution amplitude @xmath39 with such a prefactor would however introduce an artificial singularity of @xmath40 at @xmath41 , since there is no symmetry by which @xmath42 has to vanish at @xmath43 .",
    "this is in contrast to the case of the generalized parton distribution @xmath27 , where due to time reversal invariance the product @xmath44 occurring in its definition is zero for @xmath43 .",
    "integrating ( [ bbdav ] ) over @xmath45 reduces the bilocal @xmath2 matrix elements to local ones . in analogy to the space - like case we obtain a set of sum rules , @xmath46 with time - like form factors defined as @xmath47 for each flavor .",
    "appropriate combinations give the form factors of the electromagnetic and weak currents , for instance the magnetic and pauli form factors @xmath48 the relations ( [ sumrules ] ) are valid for any physical value of the skewness @xmath49 .",
    "they also hold for any value of the factorization scale @xmath22 of the distribution amplitudes , since the vector and axial vector currents have zero anomalous dimension and the form factors @xmath50 and @xmath51 are scale independent . taking higher moments in @xmath52",

    "one finds that @xmath66 and @xmath67 are odd under the replacement @xmath68 , which implies zeroes of these distribution amplitudes at @xmath56 .",
    "note also that the @xmath69-even combinations @xmath70 are antisymmetric under the replacement @xmath58 and therefore disappear in the sum rules  ( [ sumrules ] ) .",
    "this is consistent with the properties of the form factors @xmath71 and @xmath72 , which are @xmath69-odd .",
    "the reverse situation occurs for the @xmath69-odd combinations @xmath73 , which do not enter ( [ sumrules ] ) in agreement with the @xmath69-even nature of @xmath74 and @xmath75 .",
    "the distribution amplitudes @xmath76 are complex quantities , with phases due to the interactions in the @xmath2 system . because of time",
    "reversal invariance they also parameterize matrix elements with baryons in the initial state , @xmath77 notice the change of sign in front of @xmath33 .",
    "we finally remark that distribution amplitudes for pairs @xmath78 involving different baryons can be defined as in ( [ bbdav ] ) .",
    "the charge conjugation relations ( [ symm ] ) do not hold for these quantities , but they do for distribution amplitudes of the symmetrized states @xmath79 .",
    "we will now derive the expression for the soft handbag contribution to @xmath9 .",
    "the first steps of the derivation go in complete analogy to the case of meson pair production .",
    "we thus start by summarizing the corresponding results of  @xcite , and then proceed from the point where the different nature of baryons and mesons leads to important differences . in  @xcite",

    "we have preferred the form ( [ nice ] ) that leads to matrix elements of light - cone operators with well - known properties , at the price of a loss in accuracy which we do not expect to be critical .",
    "we remark that for baryon helicities @xmath160 both ( [ exact ] ) and ( [ nice ] ) are odd under @xmath161 in our reference frame , which results in a zero contribution to the amplitude after integration over @xmath45 .",
    "this can be shown by performing a charge conjugation followed by a rotation of @xmath162 around the @xmath163-axis .",
    "the amplitudes with opposite baryon helicities @xmath164 do not decouple in this way , because charge conjugation exchanges the helicities of @xmath23 and @xmath123 .",
    "we finally emphasize that the amplitude  ( [ final ] ) for the @xmath9 process does have the correct behavior under charge conjugation , which for our spinor convention reads @xmath165 in this channel .",
    "for the sake of comparison let us mention what happens if we make the corresponding approximations in wide - angle compton scattering . using that contributions where a fast antiquark is emitted from and reabsorbed by the baryon are small , one may count them with the `` wrong '' sign in the compton form factors @xmath166 and @xmath167 of  @xcite . replacing then the explicit factors @xmath168 with @xmath169 ,",
    "we obtain approximations @xmath170 and @xmath171 in terms of the space - like dirac and pauli form factors , in analogy with our result here .",
    "the amplitude ( [ final ] ) shows important differences compared with the one we obtained in @xcite for production of a pair of pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "similarly to the @xmath2 amplitudes with @xmath160 , the matrix element corresponding to  ( [ exact ] ) vanishes there when integrated over  @xmath45 . due to parity invariance",
    "the corresponding contribution from @xmath111 is also zero , so that the leading term in the taylor expansion ( [ taylor ] ) of the hard subprocess gives a vanishing scattering amplitude .",
    "we thus had to include the first nonleading term in this expansion , which is proportional to @xmath172 .",
    "if one were to do the same in the @xmath2 case , one would get a further term in ( [ final ] ) .",
    "it would involve @xmath173 , which is a form factor of the quark energy - momentum - tensor , in analogy to the meson pair case .",
    "such a subleading contribution would behave as @xmath174 in the amplitude instead of @xmath175 , and give a @xmath176 rather than @xmath177 dependence in the cross section .",
    "returning to our result ( [ final ] ) , we observe that the pseudoscalar annihilation form factor @xmath146 generates amplitudes with equal helicities of the baryon and antibaryon , i.e. , with their spin projections along @xmath178 coupled to zero . the spins of quark and antiquark in the @xmath96 transition do then not sum up to those of the @xmath2 system , which implies that parton configurations with non - zero orbital angular momentum along @xmath178 are required in @xmath146 .",
