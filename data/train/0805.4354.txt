    "the classical braid group @xmath2 can be defined as the fundamental group of the space of all configurations of @xmath1 distinct points in @xmath3 . in this paper",
    "we consider a @xmath4-dimensional analog which we call the _ ring group _ @xmath5 .",
    "this is the fundamental group of the space @xmath6 of all configurations of @xmath1 disjoint pairwise unlinked circles , or rings , in @xmath0 , where we mean the word ` circle ' in the strict euclidean sense .",
    "it is not immediately apparent that @xmath6 is path - connected , but in section  2 we recall a simple geometric argument from [ fs ] that proves this . in particular",
    ", this says that configurations of @xmath1 pairwise unlinked circles form the trivial link of @xmath1 components .",
    "the ring group @xmath5 turns out to be closely related to several other groups that have been studied before in a variety of contexts under different names .",
    "this connection arises from one of our main technical results :    the inclusion of @xmath6 into the space @xmath7 of all smooth trivial links of @xmath1 components in @xmath0 is a homotopy equivalence .",
    "thus @xmath5 is isomorphic to the group @xmath8 first studied in the 1962 thesis of dahm [ d ] , who identified it with a certain subgroup of the automorphism group of a free group on @xmath1 generators , subsequently called the symmetric automorphism group [ mc ] , [ c ] .",
    "a finite - index subgroup of this group is the ` braid - permutation group ' of [ frr ] .",
    "other references are [ g ] , [ bl ] , [ r ] , [ bmmm ] , [ jmm ] , [ bwc ] .",
    "we will show that the group @xmath5 is generated by three families of elements @xmath9 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 defined as follows .",
    "if we place the @xmath1 rings in a standard position in the @xmath12-plane with centers along the @xmath13-axis , then there are two generators @xmath9 and @xmath10 that permute the @xmath14th and @xmath15st rings by passing the @xmath14th ring either through the @xmath15st ring or around it , respectively , as in figure  [ fig1 ] .    ,",
    "@xmath10 , and @xmath11.,width=432 ]    the generator @xmath11 reverses the orientation of the @xmath14th ring by rotating it 180 degrees around its vertical axis of symmetry .",
    "it is not hard to see that @xmath11 has order two in  @xmath5 .",
    "we will show that the @xmath9 s generate a subgroup of @xmath5 isomorphic to the braid group @xmath2 and the @xmath10 s generate a subgroup isomorphic to the symmetric group @xmath16 .",
    "the space @xmath6 has a number of interesting subspaces .",
    "the first of these we single out is the ` untwisted ring space ' @xmath17 consisting of all configurations of rings lying in planes parallel to a fixed plane , say the @xmath12-plane .",
    "the loops of configurations giving the generators @xmath9 and @xmath10 lie in this subspace .",
    "we will show that the untwisted ring group @xmath18 is generated by the @xmath9 s and @xmath10 s , and that the map @xmath19 induced by the inclusion @xmath20 is injective , so @xmath21 can be identified with the subgroup of @xmath5 generated by the @xmath9 s and @xmath10 s .",
    "we will also see that @xmath21 can be described as the fundamental group of the @xmath22-sheeted covering space of @xmath6 consisting of configurations of oriented rings , so @xmath21 has index @xmath22 in  @xmath5 .",
    "the @xmath11 s generate a complementary subgroup isomorphic to @xmath23 , but neither this subgroup nor @xmath21 is normal in @xmath5 .",
    "intermediate between @xmath17 and @xmath6 is the space @xmath24 of configurations of rings lying in vertical planes .",
    "its fundamental group @xmath25 is also generated by the @xmath9 s , @xmath10 s , and @xmath11 s , but the @xmath11 s have infinite order in @xmath25 .",
    "another interesting subspace of @xmath6 consists of configurations of rings , each of which is vertical and is cut into two equal halves by the @xmath26-plane .",
    "the upper halves of these rings can be thought of as wickets , as in the game of croquet , in upper half - space @xmath27 , and this subspace of @xmath6 can be identified with the space @xmath28 of all configurations of @xmath1 disjoint wickets in @xmath27 .",
    "the condition of being pairwise unlinked is automatically satisfied for vertical rings that are bisected by the @xmath26-plane . in analogy to theorem  1 , one can compare @xmath28 with the space @xmath29 of configurations of @xmath1 disjoint smooth unknotted and unlinked arcs in @xmath27 with endpoints on @xmath30 . here ` unknotted and unlinked ' means ` isotopic to the standard configuration of @xmath1 disjoint wickets ' .",
    "[ main ] the inclusion @xmath31 is a homotopy equivalence .    in fact , we will prove a common generalization of this result and theorem 1 that involves configurations of both rings and wickets .",
    "we call the group @xmath32 the _ wicket group _ @xmath33 .",
    "it too is generated by the @xmath9 s , @xmath10 s , and @xmath11 s .",
    "the @xmath9 s again generate a subgroup isomorphic to @xmath2 , but the @xmath10 s now generate a subgroup that is isomorphic to @xmath2 rather than @xmath16 .",
    "the @xmath11 s have infinite order just as they do in @xmath25 .",
    "there is also an untwisted wicket group @xmath34 where @xmath35 .",
    "we show that @xmath36 is generated by the @xmath9 s and @xmath10 s , and that the map @xmath37 induced by inclusion is injective , so @xmath36 can be identified with the subgroup of @xmath33 generated by the @xmath9 s and @xmath10 s .",
    "when defining @xmath21 , @xmath25 , @xmath33 , and @xmath36 as fundamental groups we did not mention basepoints , and this is justified by the fact that @xmath17 , @xmath24 , @xmath28 , and @xmath38 are all connected , by the same argument that shows that @xmath6 is connected .    summarizing , we have the following commutative diagram relating the various ring and wicket groups :        the two vertical maps are injective and correspond to adjoining the generators @xmath11 .",
    "we will show that the two maps from the first column to the second column are quotient maps obtained by adding the relations @xmath39 , and the lower right horizontal map is the quotient map adding the relations @xmath40 .    in section  [ presentations ]",
    ", we will derive finite presentations for all five of the groups in the diagram above , with the @xmath9 s , @xmath10 s , and @xmath11 s as generators .",
    "the relations that hold for all five groups are the usual braid relations among the @xmath9 s and @xmath10 s separately , together with certain braid - like relations combining @xmath9 s and @xmath10 s , and for the groups in the second row there are relations describing how the @xmath11 s interact with the other generators .",
    "for the three ring groups there are also the relations @xmath41 , and in @xmath5 the relations @xmath40 are added .",
    "for @xmath21 the presentation was known previously [ frr ] , [ bwc ] using one of the more classical definitions of this group . a presentation for @xmath33",
    "was derived in [ t1 ] , using its interpretation as @xmath42 , after generators had been found earlier in [ h3 ] .",
    "the space of configurations of @xmath1 distinct points in @xmath3 is aspherical , with trivial higher homotopy groups , but this is no longer true for the ring spaces @xmath6 , @xmath17 , and @xmath24 .",
    "this is because the groups @xmath5 , @xmath21 , and @xmath25 contain torsion , the subgroup @xmath16 generated by the @xmath10 s , so any @xmath43 complex for these groups has to be infinite dimensional , but the spaces @xmath6 , @xmath17 , and @xmath24 are smooth finite - dimensional manifolds , hence finite - dimensional cw complexes ( as are @xmath28 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "the situation is better for the wicket spaces :    [ two ] the spaces @xmath44 and @xmath38 are aspherical .",
    "in particular , this implies that @xmath33 and @xmath36 are torsionfree .",
    "the proof of this theorem in section  5 is more difficult than the proof of the corresponding result for configurations of points in @xmath3 , as it uses theorem  2 as well as some results from @xmath4-manifold theory .",
    "there is a natural homomorphism @xmath45 induced by the map which associates to each configuration of @xmath1 wickets the @xmath46 endpoints of these wickets , a configuration of @xmath46 points in @xmath3 .",
    "for example , the generators @xmath9 and @xmath10 give rise to the two braids shown in figure  2 .        it is a classical fact , whose proof we recall in section 5 , that this homomorphism @xmath45 is injective .",
    "this gives an alternative way of looking at @xmath33 as ` braids ' of @xmath1 ribbons , where certain intersections of ribbons are permitted , intersections that are known in knot theory as ribbon intersections .    just as the braid group @xmath2 has a pure braid subgroup @xmath47 , so do the five groups in the earlier commutative diagram have ` pure ' subgroups , the kernels of natural homomorphisms to @xmath16 measuring how loops of configurations permute the rings or wickets . as in the braid case , these pure ring and wicket groups are the fundamental groups of the corresponding configuration spaces of ordered @xmath1-tuples of rings or wickets .",
    "the full ring group @xmath5 is the semidirect product of the pure untwisted ring group @xmath48 and the signed permutation group @xmath49 .",
    "for the wicket group @xmath33 there is a weaker result , a nonsplit short exact sequence @xmath50 where @xmath51 is the semidirect product of @xmath16 and @xmath52 .",
    "our simple geometric method for finding presentations of the five ` impure ' ring and wicket groups also gives presentations for the pure versions of the ring groups @xmath5 , @xmath21 , and @xmath25 , but not for the pure wicket groups . in the case of the pure untwisted ring group @xmath53 the presentation",
    "was originally found in [ mc ] .",
    "it has generators @xmath54 in which all rings except the @xmath14th ring are stationary and the @xmath14th ring is pulled through the @xmath55th ring and back to its initial position without passing through any other rings , for each pair @xmath56 .    the subgroup of @xmath48 generated by the @xmath54 with @xmath57 has been studied in [ cpvw ] .",
    "we show that this ` upper triangular pure untwisted ring group ' is the fundamental group of the subspace @xmath58 of @xmath17 consisting of configurations of rings of unequal diameters .",
    "the sizes of the rings then provide a canonical ordering of the rings , hence loops in this space give elements of @xmath48 , and we show the resulting homomorphism @xmath59 is injective with image the subgroup generated by the @xmath54 with @xmath57 .    in section  [ sphere",
    "] , we also obtain similar results for configurations of circles in @xmath60 and wickets in a ball . in the latter case",
    "wickets can be viewed as geodesics in hyperbolic @xmath4-space , and the configuration space of disjoint wickets is a subspace of the space of configurations of disjoint geodesics , a dense subspace having the same homotopy type as the larger space .",
    "( a pair of disjoint geodesics can have an endpoint in common , so the two spaces are not identical . )    a key step in proving these results is a process for simplifying configurations of rings in @xmath6 .",
    "general configurations in @xmath6 can be quite complicated , with all the rings tightly packed together .",
    "this happens already in the subspace @xmath28 where the unlinking condition is automatic .",
    "one can take an arbitrary finite set of wickets , possibly intersecting in very complicated ways and tightly packed together , and then with a small random perturbation remove all the intersections to produce a configuration in @xmath28 .",
    "the goal of the simplification process is to produce configurations in which each circle is surrounded by a region in which it is much larger than all other circles that intersect the region .",
    "this region , or ` microcosm ' , is by definition a closed ball of double the radius of the circle , and with the same center .",
    "we define the complexity of a configuration of circles @xmath61 of radii @xmath62 to be the maximum of the ratios",
    "@xmath63 for the pairs of circles @xmath64 whose microcosms intersect . if none of the microcosms intersect , the complexity is defined to be @xmath65 .",
    "if we let @xmath66 be the subspace of @xmath6 consisting of configurations of complexity less than @xmath67 , then the simplification process will show that the inclusion of @xmath66 into @xmath6 is a homotopy equivalence for any @xmath68 .",
    "configurations of small complexity can be thought of not only on the small scale of microcosms , but also in large - scale astronomical terms .",
    "when the microcosms of two circles intersect , one can think of the smaller circle as a ring - shaped planet with the larger circle as its ring - shaped sun . there can be several such planets in each solar system , each planet can have its own system of moons , the moons can have their own ` moonlets , ' and so on .",
    "the solar systems can form galaxies , etc .",
    "the process of deforming @xmath6 into @xmath66 is an elaboration on the argument for showing @xmath6 is path - connected by shrinking all circles simultaneously in a canonical way .",
    "if one starts with a configuration which is in general position in the sense that no circle has its center on the disk bounded by another circle , then this shrinking process produces a configuration of circles lying in disjoint balls .",
    "this suffices to show @xmath6 is path - connected , but to capture its full homotopy type one can not restrict attention to configurations that are in general position .",
    "we deal with general configurations by combining shrinking with a pushing process that is realized by extending shrinkings of circles to ambient isotopies .",
    "this is explained in detail in section  [ complexity ] of the paper .",
    "the proof of theorems 1 and 2 , that the inclusions @xmath69 and @xmath70 are homotopy equivalences , uses the complexity reduction result described above , and it also involves a shift in focus from codimension two objects to codimension one objects , embedded spheres and disks , which are generally more tractable . in section  [ rigidifying ]",
    "we use a parametrized disjunction technique to create the necessary configurations of spheres and disks , then we use the analogs of theorems 1 and 2 for spheres and disks to improve configurations of smooth spheres and disks to round spheres and disks .",
    "this relies ultimately on the proof of the smale conjecture in [ h1 ] , as does the final step of turning smooth circles and arcs into round circles and arcs .",
    "the spheres and disks are introduced to reduce the problem from configurations of many circles and arcs to configurations of at most one circle or arc in each complementary region of a configuration of spheres and disks .",
    "the paper concludes with a brief discussion in section  [ dimension ] of some elementary things that can be said about the homological dimension of the ring and wicket groups .",
    "one way to define the topology on @xmath6 is in terms of its covering space consisting of ordered @xmath1-tuples of disjoint oriented circles in @xmath0 .",
    "this covering space can be identified with an open subset in @xmath71 by assigning to each circle its centerpoint together with a vector orthogonal to the plane of the circle , of length equal to the radius of the circle and oriented according to the orientation of the circle via some rule like the right - hand rule . ignoring ordering and orientations of circles",
    "amounts to factoring out the free action of the signed permutation group on this space .",
    "thus we see that @xmath6 has a finite - sheeted covering space which is an open set in @xmath71 , and so @xmath6 itself is an open manifold of dimension @xmath72 . by similar reasoning",
    "one sees that the subspaces @xmath24 , @xmath17 , @xmath28 , and @xmath38 of @xmath6 are submanifolds of dimensions @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath74 , and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "let us recall the definition of complexity from the introduction .",
    "if @xmath76 is a configuration in @xmath6 consisting of disjoint circles @xmath61 , let @xmath77 be the closed ball containing @xmath78 having the same center and double the radius .",
    "( there is nothing special about the factor of @xmath79 here , and any other number greater than @xmath80 could be used instead . )",
    "then the _ complexity _ of the configuration @xmath76 is the maximum of the ratios @xmath81 of the radii of the pairs of circles @xmath82 in @xmath76 such that @xmath83 is nonempty , with the complexity defined to be @xmath65 if no @xmath77 s intersect .",
    "we remark that complexity , as a function @xmath84 $ ] , is upper semicontinuous , meaning that small perturbations of a configuration @xmath76 can not produce large increases in the complexity .",
    "they can however produce large decreases if two circles @xmath64 whose balls @xmath85 intersect in a single point are perturbed so that @xmath77 and @xmath86 become disjoint .",
    "define @xmath66 to be the subspace of @xmath6 consisting of configurations of complexity less than @xmath67 .",
    "this is an open subset of @xmath6 .",
    "[ 1.1 ] the inclusion @xmath87 is a homotopy equivalence for each @xmath68 . the same is true for the subspaces @xmath88 , @xmath89 , @xmath90 , and @xmath91 .",
    "first we describe the argument from [ fs ] , lemma  3.2 , for showing that @xmath6 is connected .",
    "each configuration of disjoint circles in @xmath92 bounds a unique configuration of hemispheres in @xmath93 orthogonal to @xmath92 .",
    "the claim is that these hemispheres will be disjoint when each pair of circles is unlinked . to see this ,",
    "think of @xmath94 as the upper halfspace model of hyperbolic @xmath95-space , with the hemispheres as hyperbolic planes .",
    "if two such planes intersect , they do so either in a single point or in a hyperbolic line , but the latter possibility is ruled out by the disjointness of the original collection of circles . switching to the ball model of hyperbolic space , the point of intersection of two hyperbolic planes can be moved to the center of the ball , so the planes become euclidean planes through the origin , and any transverse pair of such planes can be deformed through transverse planes to be orthogonal , when it is obvious that their boundary circles are linked in the boundary sphere  @xmath60 .",
    "thus unlinked circles in @xmath0 bound disjoint hemispheres in @xmath94 .    for a configuration of circles in @xmath0 bounding disjoint hemispheres in @xmath94 , consider what happens when one intersects the configuration of hemispheres with the hyperplanes @xmath96 for @xmath97 .",
    "as @xmath98 increases , each circle shrinks to its centerpoint and disappears .",
    "let us call this the _ canonical shrinking _ of the configuration .",
    "a given configuration of circles can be perturbed so that no centerpoint of one circle lies on the disk bounded by another circle .",
    "then if we perform the canonical shrinking of the configuration , we can stop the shrinking of each circle just before it shrinks to a point and keep it at a small size so that no other shrinking circles will bump into it . in this way the given circle configuration can be shrunk until the disks bounded by the circles are all disjoint .",
    "this says that the configuration of circles forms the trivial link , and it makes clear that the space @xmath99 is path - connected .",
    "when dealing with a @xmath100-parameter family of circle configurations , however , one can not avoid configurations where one circle has center lying in the disk bounded by another circle .",
    "if the latter circle is larger than the first , the two circles would then collide if we stop the shrinking of the smaller circle just before it disappears .",
    "our strategy to avoid such collisions will still be to stop the canonical shrinking of each circle just before it disappears , and thereafter shrink it at a slower rate so that it does not disappear , but we also allow it to be pushed by ` air cushions ' surrounding larger circles as they shrink , so that the smaller circle never intersects the larger circles",
    ".    the pushing will be achieved by an inductive process that relies on extending isotopies of circles to ambient isotopies of @xmath0 , so let us recall the standard procedure in differential topology for extending isotopies of submanifolds to ambient isotopies .",
    "an isotopy of a submanifold @xmath101 of a manifold @xmath101 is a level - preserving embedding @xmath102 .",
    "this has a tangent vector field given by the velocity vectors of the paths @xmath103 .",
    "the second coordinate of this vector field is equal to @xmath80 , and we extend it to a vector field on @xmath104 with the same property by damping off the first coordinate to @xmath65 as one moves away from @xmath105 in a small tubular neighborhood of @xmath105 . then the flow lines of this extended vector field define the extended isotopy .",
    "this also works with @xmath106 replaced by @xmath107 as will be the case in our situation .",
    "the manifold @xmath108 will be @xmath0 , and we can choose the tubular neighborhood of the submanifold @xmath109 to be an @xmath110-neighborhood of @xmath111 in each level @xmath112 .",
    "for a configuration @xmath76 in @xmath6 consisting of circles @xmath61 , let @xmath113 be the union of the largest circles in @xmath76 , @xmath114 the union of the next - largest circles , and so on .",
    "let @xmath115 be the time parameter in the canonical shrinking of @xmath76 , and let @xmath116 be the time when the circles of @xmath117 shrink to their centerpoints , so @xmath118 .",
    "note that all the circles in @xmath117 have distinct centerpoints since two circles with the same center and radius must intersect .",
    "the canonical shrinking defines an isotopy @xmath119 for @xmath120 .",
    "our aim is to truncate this at a value @xmath121 slightly less than @xmath122 , then extend the truncated isotopy to values of @xmath115 greater than @xmath123 .",
    "the new extended isotopy @xmath119 will move each circle @xmath124 of @xmath117 through circles parallel to itself , so @xmath125 will be determined by specifying the centerpoint @xmath126 and the radius @xmath127 of @xmath125 .",
    "the center @xmath126 is the centerpoint of @xmath124 for @xmath128 since this point does not move during the canonical shrinking , and we will in fact have @xmath126 equal to this same point for @xmath129 , not just @xmath128 . for the function @xmath127",
    ", the canonical shrinking specifies this for @xmath128 , and we will choose it to be a positive decreasing function of @xmath115 for @xmath130 .",
    "the extended isotopy @xmath119 will be constructed by induction on @xmath14 . for @xmath131 and @xmath124 a circle of @xmath113",
    "we let @xmath126 be constant for all @xmath115 , and we let @xmath127 be any decreasing function @xmath132 of @xmath115 for @xmath133 where @xmath134 is chosen close enough to @xmath135 so that the microcosms of all the circles of @xmath136 are disjoint .",
    "such a @xmath134 exists since the centerpoints of the circles of @xmath113 are distinct .",
    "the microcosms of the circles of @xmath137 will then remain disjoint for all @xmath138 .",
    "to finish the first step of the induction we extend the isotopy @xmath137 to an ambient isotopy @xmath139 by the general procedure described earlier , with @xmath140 the identity .    for a circle @xmath124 of @xmath114 with centerpoint @xmath141 we let @xmath126 be constant for @xmath142 and",
    "then we let it move via the isotopy @xmath143 . in formulas",
    "this means @xmath144 .",
    "this will in fact be constant for @xmath115 slightly greater than @xmath145 as well as for @xmath142 .",
    "since @xmath143 is an ambient isotopy , @xmath126 will be disjoint from @xmath137 and from @xmath146 for other circles @xmath147 of @xmath114 for all @xmath115 .",
    "this implies that if we choose @xmath148 close enough to @xmath145 and the function @xmath149 giving the radius of the circles of @xmath150 small enough , then these circles will be disjoint from @xmath137 for all @xmath115 and will have disjoint microcosms for @xmath151 .",
    "we can also make @xmath149 small enough so that the ratio @xmath152 goes to @xmath65 with increasing @xmath115 .",
    "the second step of the induction is completed by extending the isotopies @xmath137 and @xmath150 to an ambient isotopy @xmath153 starting with @xmath154 the identity .",
    "subsequent induction steps are similar .",
    "for example , at the next stage , for a circle @xmath124 of @xmath155 with centerpoint @xmath141 we let @xmath126 move according to the isotopy @xmath156 , and we choose @xmath157 close enough to @xmath158 and @xmath159 small enough so that the resulting circles of @xmath160 are disjoint from @xmath137 and @xmath150 for all @xmath115 and the microcosms of the circles of @xmath160 are disjoint for @xmath161 .",
    "also we make @xmath159 small enough so that the ratio @xmath162 goes to @xmath65 with increasing @xmath115 .",
    "we can also assume that @xmath163 , and inductively that @xmath164 for all @xmath14 .",
    "when the induction process is finished we have a path @xmath165 in @xmath6 , defined for each @xmath166 .",
    "it is clear that the complexity of @xmath165 approaches @xmath65 as @xmath115 goes to @xmath167 since the circles of @xmath119 have disjoint microcosms for large @xmath115 and the ratios @xmath168 approach @xmath65 .",
    "we claim that the complexity of @xmath165 decreases monotonically ( in the weak sense ) as @xmath115 increases .",
    "consider two circles of @xmath76 , say @xmath169 and @xmath170 .",
    "if they are in the same @xmath117 , they have the same radius throughout the isotopy @xmath171 , and their centers are stationary until @xmath116 , after which their microcosms remain disjoint , so their contribution to the complexity decreases monotonically , being either @xmath65 for all @xmath115 or @xmath80 for a while and then @xmath65 . if @xmath169 and @xmath170 belong to different @xmath117 s , with @xmath169 in @xmath172 and @xmath170 in @xmath173 for @xmath174 , the ratio of their radii approaches @xmath65 monotonically , so the only way they could contribute to a non - monotonic complexity would be for their microcosms to bump into each other at a certain time @xmath115 after having been disjoint shortly before this time . for this to happen , both @xmath175 and @xmath176 would have to be within the microcosm of some larger circle @xmath177 in @xmath178 for some @xmath179 . in this case the pair @xmath176 , @xmath177 would be contributing a larger number to the complexity than the pair @xmath175 , @xmath176 , so the collision between the microcosms of the latter pair would not be causing an increase in the overall complexity .    to show that the inclusion @xmath180 is a homotopy equivalence for @xmath68 it suffices to show that the relative homotopy groups @xmath181 are zero for all @xmath100 , since both spaces are smooth manifolds and hence cw complexes .",
    "thus it suffices to deform a given a map @xmath182 , @xmath183 , through such maps to a map with image in @xmath66 .",
    "this would follow if we could add a parameter @xmath184 to our previous construction of the deformation @xmath171",
    ". however , there is a problem with doing this directly because the relative sizes of the circles in a family of configurations @xmath185 can change with varying @xmath186 , so the sequence of induction steps in the construction of the desired deformation @xmath187 could change with @xmath186 .",
    "what we will do instead is concatenate initial segments of deformations @xmath187 over different regions in @xmath188 to produce a new family of deformations @xmath189 .    as a preliminary step , note",

    "a slight variation on the technique used to prove the theorem will be used to prove the following result :    [ 1.2 ] the natural maps @xmath19 , @xmath230 , and @xmath231 induced by the inclusions @xmath20 , @xmath232 , and @xmath233 are injective .    consider first the case of @xmath19 .",

    "it has a section , obtained by choosing a standard configuration of rings lying in disjoint balls and taking all possible rotations of these rings about their centers .",
    "the existence of the section would then imply that the long exact sequence of homotopy groups breaks up into split short exact sequences , so in particular there would be a short exact sequence @xmath240 which would give the desired injectivity .",
    "we will make this into a valid argument by showing the weaker result that the projection @xmath238 is a quasifibration . recall that a map @xmath241 is a quasifibration if @xmath242 is an isomorphism for each @xmath243 , @xmath244 , and @xmath245 .",

    "we will use this generalization below .    to show that the projection @xmath238 is a quasifibration ,",

    ". then we construct @xmath187 as in the preceding paragraph , starting with @xmath202 for @xmath255 .",
    "thus the deformation of the planes containing the rings pauses for a time before continuing with the given deformation . at the end of the induction step",
    "we choose the function @xmath199 and truncate @xmath187 , which can truncate the deformation of the planes containing the rings , so that they pause once more in the next stage of the induction .",
    "it is no longer necessary to choose @xmath199 large enough to make @xmath202 lie in @xmath66 for @xmath203 if @xmath186 is near the @xmath194-skeleton .",

    "this finishes the proof that the projection @xmath238 is a quasifibration , and hence the proof that @xmath19 is injective .    since the injection @xmath19 factors through @xmath25 it follows that @xmath230 is also injective . for @xmath37 we can use the same quasifibration argument as in the first case , the only difference being that @xmath239 is replaced by @xmath258 , an @xmath1-dimensional torus .",
    "another result stated in the introduction can be proved using the same method :    the natural map from @xmath17 to the covering space @xmath259 of @xmath6 consisting of configurations of oriented rings induces an isomorphism @xmath260 .    the arguments in the preceding proof work equally well with oriented rings , the only difference being that @xmath261 is replaced by @xmath262 .",

    "there are natural maps from the first two fibrations to the second two fibrations . applying the five lemma to the induced maps of long exact sequences of homotopy groups , we see that @xmath31 being a homotopy equivalence implies first that this is true also for @xmath524 and then also for @xmath519 .",
    "similar things can be done for rings as well as wickets .",
    "let @xmath525 be the space of configurations of @xmath1 disjoint pairwise unlinked circles in @xmath60 , and let @xmath526 be the corresponding analog of @xmath7 , the space of smooth @xmath1-component trivial links in @xmath60 .",
    "the inclusion @xmath527 is a homotopy equivalence .",
    "this follows the line of argument in the preceding proof by comparing fibrations , using the space @xmath528 of configurations of circles in @xmath60 with a disjoint basepoint , and its smooth analog @xmath529 .",
    "one can also obtain a presentation for @xmath530 from a presentation for @xmath5 by adding the same relation as was added to get a presentation for @xmath517 .",
    "the justification is the same as before , by using stereographic projection to identify @xmath6 with the complement of the codimension @xmath79 submanifold of @xmath525 consisting of configurations passing through a given point in @xmath60 .",
    "it is a classical fact that the general position argument for finding a presentation for @xmath2 can be refined to build a finite cw complex @xmath531 having a single @xmath65-cell , a @xmath80-cell for each standard generator @xmath10 , and a @xmath79-cell for each of the standard relations .",
    "the cells are dual to the strata of the stratification of @xmath275 according to coincidences of the @xmath302-coordinates .",
    "thus the @xmath65-cell corresponds to the unique stratum of maximum dimension consisting of configurations with distinct @xmath302-coordinates , the @xmath80-cells to the strata of codimension one where exactly two points in a configuration have the same @xmath302-coordinate , and so on . the same procedure works also for @xmath38 to give a finite cw complex @xmath532 .",
    "the dimension of this complex is @xmath458 , just as for @xmath2 .",
    "for @xmath2 there is a single cell in the top dimension , corresponding to the stratum of configurations with all @xmath1 points on one vertical line , but for @xmath38 there are a number of different strata consisting of configurations of wickets all lying in one plane , so there are a number of top - dimensional cells .",
    "there can not exist a @xmath532 of dimension less than @xmath458 since @xmath36 has a subgroup @xmath533 generated by the elements @xmath473 for @xmath534 .",
    "for @xmath33 the minimum dimension of a @xmath535 is @xmath536 .",
    "there is a @xmath535 of this dimension since @xmath33 is a subgroup of @xmath537 , and there can not be one of lower dimension since @xmath33 contains a subgroup @xmath538 , generated by the @xmath533 above and the @xmath11 s .",
    "it seems likely that @xmath33 should have a finite cw complex @xmath535 of minimum dimension , perhaps constructible by extending the general - position constructions referred to above .",
    "for @xmath5 the virtual cohomological dimension is known to be @xmath458 by [ c ] , where a @xmath43 which is a finite cw complex of dimension @xmath458 was constructed for the finite - index subgroup @xmath48 .",
    "this @xmath43 can be described as the space of basepointed graphs consisting of @xmath1 circles touching in a tree - like pattern , forming a cactus - shaped object .",
    "the dimension @xmath458 can not be reduced since @xmath48 again contains a subgroup @xmath533 generated by the elements @xmath473 .",
