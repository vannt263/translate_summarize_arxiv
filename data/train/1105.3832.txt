    "it is well known that exact solutions of quantum mechanics equations are of fundamental importance in physics .",

    "we present a new class of exact localized solutions of the dirac equation in the field of traveling circularly polarized electromagnetic wave and a constant magnetic field applied along the wave propagation .",
    "it also is well known that the problem of the magnetic moment is of special interest in physics .",
    "its contemporary value is deduced in the framework of quantum electrodynamics @xcite and for electron have been confirmed with the amazing accuracy in a variety of experiments @xcite . however , these measurements correspond to not large velocities and not very strong magnetic fields . the theoretical basis for that is the pauli equation and the magnetic resonance interpretation as a flop of spin under action of a constant and oscillating magnetic field @xcite .",
    "in the pauli equation the operator of the magnetic moment is proportional to that of spin . in the relativistic case",
    "this dependence is more complicated .    in the paper",
    "we consider this problem and find a exact analytical solution for this case .",
    "since operators of energy , momentum and spin in a variable magnetic field do not commute with the hamiltonian , we must consider average values of these operators .",
    "in fact this consideration is equivalent to that in the framework of the classical theory of fields @xcite .",
    "we show that in the relativistic case the magnetic resonance is a flop of the magnetic moment but not spin .",
    "we consider numerical examples of presented solutions applicable to experimental testing .",

    "such a field corresponds to the potential@xmath3  where @xmath4 is the propagation constant , @xmath5 is the frequency , the sign change of @xmath5 corresponds to the opposite polarization , values @xmath6 and @xmath7 are used when the wave propagates along the @xmath2-axis and opposite direction respectively , @xmath8 is the speed of light , @xmath9 are dirac s matrices , @xmath10 is the amplitude of this wave .",
    "it is well known that the amplitudes of the electric and magnetic fields in the plane wave coincide .",
    "these fields are an integral part of the wave and the influence of the electric and magnetic field can not be considered separately in the given case .",
    "the transition into a rotating frame is essential for the modulation by a rotating electromagnetic field since in such a frame stationary solutions are possible .",
    "it is well known that the transformation @xmath11  describes a spinor in the frame turned around the @xmath2-axis through an angle @xmath12 if @xmath13  then  it describes a spinor in the rotating frame . in accordance with this ,",
    "an appropriate coordinate transformation is also necessary .",
    "below we use the tilde for coordinates in the rotating frame@xmath14this transformation is identified as a `` galilean transformation for rotating frames '' because time in the initial and rotating frame is the same .",
    "we use constants @xmath15 and @xmath16 as `` energy '' and `` momentum along the @xmath2-axis '' for stationary states in the rotating frame .  once these states have been found the wave function as well as coordinates are translated back into the initial ( non - rotating ) frame .    in the initial frame",

    "this parameter obeys the equation@xmath35where@xmath36    obviously , wave functions ( [ psim ] ) and ( [ psip ] ) can not be presented as a small and large two - component spinor .",
    "it means that the difference @xmath37 can not be small . from this an important conclusion",
    "follows : _ these solutions correspond only to the relativistic case_. another distinguish feature is an algebraic equation of the third order ( e0 ) for eigenvalues @xmath38 and correspondingly @xmath39 , @xmath40 .",
    "the wave function @xmath41 depends on four independent normalized parameters @xmath42 which are used below rather than @xmath43",
    "it should be emphasized that in the initial frame states are not stationary , operators of energy and momentum do nt commute with the hamiltonian",

    "it is well known that the magnetic moment plays a principal role in the interaction of fermions with a magnetic / electromagnetic field . for relativistic fermions described here the magnetic moment",
    "is determined as the first derivative of dirac s lagrangian with respect to the magnetic field .  since solutions ( [ psi ] )",
    "are localized perpendicularly to the @xmath2-axis , it is appropriate to consider only  the @xmath2-component of the magnetic moment .",
    "this component is @xmath56this definition coincides with that in classical theory of fields @xcite .",
    "below we study this quantity contrary to the classical consideration where a constant in the the pauli equation is used instead @xmath57 .    in non - relativistic case a rotating electromagnetic field",
    "gives rise electron pairs with spins rotating in opposite direction @xcite .",
    "the wave function of electron is formed from two wave functions corresponding two stationary states in the rotating frame with a certain difference between energy levels . in the given case",
    "the wave function also has to be constructed from two functions@xmath58where @xmath59 is the normalization coefficient@xmath60    the wave function ( [ psi ] ) depends on four parameters @xmath61 and two roots of eq .",

    "the integration in ( [ mag ] ) results in a exact expression .",

    "it is well known that in non - relativistic case the magnetic resonance occurs at a value of the longitudinal magnetic field corresponding to the spin oscillation amplitude maximum . at this value",
    "the amplitude becomes constant .",
    "such a maximization in relativistic case corresponds to an extremum of the function ( [ fd ] ) in respect to @xmath21 . at the extremum point",
    "@xmath73with help of this equality the parameter @xmath21 may be excluded from consideration . however , in contrast to the classical case , the amplitude of the magnetic moment oscillation remains dependent on thee parameters @xmath74 .",

    "but the maximization is possible only for one pair of wave functions .",
    "it is easy to show that the magnetic moment oscillation frequency ( [ frec ] ) , in contrast to the classical case , depends on the fermion mass ( and @xmath78 or non - normalized parameters @xmath79 ) .",
    "therefore , measurements of this frequency probably may be turned into the precision measurement of fermion masses , provided an experimental technique will be developed for the estimate of the number of oscillations and fermion time - of - flight .",
