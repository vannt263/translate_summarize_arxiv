    "<S> there we also show that @xmath4 is convex for any convex entanglement monotone @xmath3 , i.e. ( c4 ) is fulfilled as well in this case .    </S>",
    "<S> these powerful results complete the parallel between coherence and entanglement , _ de facto _ establishing their full quantitative equivalence within the respective resource theories . </S>",
    "<S> thanks to theorem  [ thm : monotone ] , one can now use the comprehensive knowledge acquired in entanglement theory in the last two decades @xcite , to address the quantification of coherence in a variety of operational settings , and to define and validate physically motivated coherence monotones . </S>",

    "<S> since the geometric measure of entanglement is a full convex entanglement monotone @xcite , we have just proven that the geometric measure of coherence @xmath97 is a full convex coherence monotone obeying ( c1)(c4 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this settles an important question left open in previous literature @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the geometric measure @xmath97 is also  analytically computable  for an arbitrary state @xmath31 of one qubit @xcite , as follows : @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the off - diagonal element of @xmath31 with respect to the reference basis . </S>",

    "<S> our framework can be interpreted in both ways : on one hand , it demonstrates the formal potential of coherence for entanglement generation ( although not necessarily useful in practical applications , as cheaper schemes for entanglement creation might be available ) ; on the other hand , it demonstrates the usefulness of entanglement to obtain and validate measures of coherence . building on this connection , we proposed in fact a family of coherence quantifiers in terms of the maximal entanglement that can be generated by incoherent operations ( see fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cofig ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the proposed coherence quantifiers satisfy all the necessary criteria to be _ bona fide _ coherence monotones @xcite . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> the relative entropy of coherence and the geometric measure of coherence have been ( re)defined and interpreted operationally in terms of the maximum converted distillable and geometric entanglement , respectively .    </S>",
    "<S> our framework bears some resemblance with , and may be regarded as the general finite - dimensional counterpart to , the established ( qualitative and quantitative ) equivalence between input nonclassicality , intended as superposition of optical coherent states , and output entanglement created by passive quantum optical elements such as beam splitters @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results presented here should also be compared to the scheme for activating distillable entanglement via premeasurement interactions @xcite from quantum discord , a measure of nonclassical correlations going beyond entanglement @xcite . in the latter approach , which has attracted a large amount of attention recently @xcite , measures of discord in a composite system </S>",
    "<S> are defined in terms of the minimum entanglement created with an ancillary system via fixed premeasurement interactions defined as in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ eq : cnot ] ) , where the minimization is over local unitaries on the system regulating the control bases before the interaction . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , in this work the reference basis is fixed , and a maximization of the output entanglement over all incoherent operations returns a measure of coherence for the initial system . </S>",
    "<S> one might combine the two approaches in order to define a unified framework for interconversion among coherence , discord , and entanglement , whereby discord - type measures could be interpreted as measures of bipartite coherence suitably minimized over local product reference bases ( see e.g. @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> exploring these connections further will be the subject of another work .    </S>",
    "<S> the theory of entanglement has been the cornerstone of major developments in quantum information theory and has triggered the advancement of modern quantum technologies . </S>",
    "<S> the construction of a physically meaningful and mathematically rigorous quantitative theory of coherence can improve our perception of genuine quantumness , and guide our understanding of nascent fields such as quantum biology and nanoscale thermodynamics . by uncovering a powerful operational connection between coherence and entanglement </S>",
