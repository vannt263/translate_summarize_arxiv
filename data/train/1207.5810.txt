    "models of ordering dynamics have since long been considered as paradigms of opinion dynamics and consensus formation in social systems @xcite .",
    "most of them share the fundamental feature that order results from the self - organization of local and usually short - range pairwise interactions between agents , as it is well illustrated by the simplest and most analyzed of them , the so - called voter model @xcite . in its basic formulation ,",
    "the voter model is defined as follows : each individual in a population ( agent ) is endowed with a binary spin variable , representing two alternative opinions , and taking values @xmath2 . at each time step ,",
    "an agent @xmath3 is selected at random together with one nearest neighbor @xmath4 and the state of the system is updated as @xmath5 , the first agent copying the opinion of its neighbor . starting from a disordered initial state ,",
    "this dynamics leads in finite systems to a uniform state with all individuals sharing the same opinion ( the so - called consensus ) .    from the point of view of social dynamics",
    ", the interest in this kind of models is mainly focused on the way in which consensus is reached . the approach to this state",
    "is characterized in terms of the exit probability @xmath6 and the consensus time @xmath7 , defined as the probability that the final state corresponds to all agents in the state @xmath8 and the average time needed to reach consensus in a system of size @xmath9 , respectively , when starting from a homogeneous initial condition with a fraction @xmath10 of agents in state @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "due to its simplicity , the voter model dynamics can be exactly solved in regular lattices for any number of dimensions @xcite .",
    "thus , considering the average conservation of magnetization @xmath11 , it can be shown that the exit probability is always a linear function , @xmath12 .",
    "on the other hand , the consensus time starting from the homogeneous symmetric initial condition @xmath13 scales with system size @xmath9 as @xmath14 , with @xmath15 in @xmath16 , @xmath17 in @xmath18 , and @xmath19 in @xmath20 ( at the mean - field level ) @xcite .",
    "finally , the dependence of consensus time with the initial density of @xmath8 spins , starting from homogeneous initial conditions , takes the form @xmath21,\\ ] ] for @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "different variants of the voter model have been considered in the past , including the presence of quenched disorder in the form of `` zealots '' which do not change opinion @xcite , memory and noise reduction @xcite , inertia @xcite , non - conservative voters @xcite , non - linear interactions @xcite , etc . ; see ref .",
    "@xcite for an extended bibliography on this subject .",
    "a variant that has been considered in several contexts is the _ multi - state _ voter model , in which each agent can be in one of @xmath23 different exclusive states or opinions , in analogy of the potts model @xcite .",
    "the multi - state voter model has been considered in the past theoretically in terms of mappings of coarsening of the potts model on the ising model with constant magnetization @xcite or in terms of duality properties @xcite and has found applications in understanding the fragmentation transition in adaptive networks @xcite , in neutral models of biodiversity @xcite or in ecological models @xcite .",
    "variants of the pure multi - state voter model , introducing non - equivalent states , have also been discussed in the literature @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus in the study the ordering dynamics of the symmetric multi - state voter model , focusing in particular on the limit of a large number of initial states",
    ". each agent can be in one of @xmath23 different but dynamically equivalent states .",
    "agents follow the same dynamical update rules than in the binary version , with time being update at every dynamical step as @xmath24 .",
    "expressions for the consensus time in this model at the mean - field level have already been provided in the literature @xcite .",
    "the derivations presented so far rely however on heavy mathematics . here , building on the fokker - planck formalism presented in ref .",
    "@xcite , we rederive in a simple way the expressions for the exit probability and the consensus times in the general case of @xmath23 states .",
    "we find that the consensus time increases very slowly with the number of states , and its difference with the binary case saturates as @xmath25 ; we rationalize this finding by comparing it with the case of the mutant invasion in the ordinary two - state voter model .",
    "we also investigate the decay of the number of states as a function of time , providing a mean - field expression in excellent agreement with simulations .",
    "we finally consider the dynamics of the multi - state voter model on low dimensional lattices .",
    "lacking of specific analytical insights , we compare the numerically observed phenomenology to the mean - field case , and point out similarities and differences , focusing on the effect of the number of initial states and their configuration .",
    "the paper is structured as follows .",
    "[ sec : multi - state - voter ] is devoted to the analysis of the mean - field multi - state voter model .",
    "[ sec : finite - dimens - latt ] reports on numerical experiments concerning the low - dimensional case .",

    "[ sec : conclusions ] presents our conclusions .",
    "the form of the consensus time in the multi - state voter model at the mean - field level has been discussed in the past , mainly in the context of population genetics dynamics @xcite . here",
    "we present a simple derivation of this expression , based in the fokker - plank formalism developed in ref .",
    "the fokker - plank equation for the multi - state voter model can be simply obtained as follows : let us denote @xmath26 as a generic configuration of the system ( not unique ) with @xmath27 voters in state @xmath3 , @xmath28 , with a normalization @xmath29 .",
    "the probability of finding the system in the configuration @xmath26 at time @xmath30 , @xmath31 , evolves in terms of a master equation that is defined by the transition rates @xmath32 from the state @xmath33 to the state @xmath26 . at each time",
    "step only one voter changes its state , consequently we can write a new configuration @xmath33 of a transition @xmath34 as @xmath35 , being @xmath4 and @xmath3 the state of the voter before and after the transition , respectively . the transition rates @xmath36 and @xmath37 are given by @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the natural microscopic time step of the model , while the transitions rates @xmath40 and @xmath41 have the form @xmath42 it is now possible to derive the associated master equation . under the diffusion approximation @xcite ,",
    "valid for large @xmath9 , we consider the frequencies of the states @xmath43 and we rescale the time by a factor @xmath44 , so that one time step @xmath30 measures @xmath9 updates of the voters .",
    "a generic configuration is therefore denoted by @xmath45 , and lies in the standard simplex @xmath46 .",
    "the set of the @xmath23 vertices of the simplex , @xmath47 is the absorbing boundary of the dynamics .",
    "we note that the constraint @xmath48 reduces the number of independent variables from @xmath23 to @xmath49 , so we can choose @xmath50 to be dependent on the others .",
    "expanding the master equation in terms of @xmath44 we finally obtain , up to order @xmath51 , the final fokker - plank equation in continuous time @xcite",
    "@xmath52     -\\frac{2}{n }   \\sum_{j < i}^{s-1 } { \\partial } _ i { \\partial } _ j   \\left [ x_i x_j      p({\\vec{x } } , t ) \\right ] , \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 .",
    "the fokker - plank equation for the multi - state voter model at mean - field level does not have a drift term .",
    "this implies that the ensemble average density of each state @xmath54 is constant in time .",
    "this observation allows to extend the calculation of the exit probability in the standard voter model to general boundary conditions in the multi - state case .",
    "let us define the generalized exit probability @xmath55 as the probability that the system , starting in some random initial configuration @xmath56 , orders in some configuration @xmath57 , being @xmath58 an arbitrary subset of the absorbing boundary @xmath59 . during the evolution of the system",
    ", the average densities are conserved .",
    "let us define the quantity @xmath60 , which is also conserved .",
    "in the final consensus state , @xmath61 will have a value @xmath62 with probability @xmath63 , and a value @xmath64 with probability @xmath65 .",
    "we hence obtain the generalized exit probability @xmath66    the consensus time for a given initial condition @xmath56 is given , on the other hand , by the general equation @xcite @xmath67 subject to the boundary conditions @xmath68 we can solve in a simple way this equation by noting that the consensus time @xmath69 has to be symmetric under any exchange @xmath70 with @xmath71 .",
    "thus , we can impose the ansatz form @xmath72 where the function @xmath73 is independent of @xmath23 . introducing this ansatz into eq .",

    "( [ eq:1 ] ) , recovering in a considerably simpler way the formal result previously obtained in @xcite .    from eq .",
    "( [ eq:8 ] ) , we can analyze the behavior of the system in the limit of a large number of initial states .",
    "in particular , considering the homogeneous initial conditions @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 that is , as we could naively expect , the consensus time increases with the number of states allowed ( the system is initially more disordered and therefore requires more time to order ) , but its growth is very slow and saturates in the limit @xmath85 .",
    "in fact , in the worst case scenario in a finite system , in which @xmath86 , we have @xmath87 \\to n$ ] in the limit of large @xmath9 , being only a factor @xmath88 larger that the binary case @xmath80 .",
    "this result can be rationalized considering that , when @xmath86 , we are effectively describing an initial condition in which every agent has a different state , and the ordering occurs when one of this individuals manages to impose its state at the population level .",
    "it is therefore not surprising that we recover the @xmath9 behavior observed in the binary model when the initial condition consists of a given state of one species in a population of individuals of the opposite state , and , crucially , only the runs in which the state of the mutant gets fixated are considered . from eq .",
    "[ e : constime ] we can obtain the form in which the saturation at large @xmath23 is reached , namely , @xmath89 where the last expression is asymptotically valid in the limit of large @xmath23 .",
    "another interesting property of the ordering dynamics of the multi - state voter model is the number of different states at time @xmath30 , starting from an initial condition with @xmath23 states .",
    "we define the number of surviving states as @xmath90 , where @xmath91 if @xmath92 , and @xmath93 otherwise .",
