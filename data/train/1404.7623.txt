    "each stable set @xmath4 of @xmath0 is characterized by its incidence vector , that is an @xmath3-vector whose @xmath5-th component is equal to 1 if vertex @xmath5 is in @xmath4 , and 0 otherwise .",
    "stable set polytope _ of @xmath0 , denoted by @xmath6 , is the convex hull of all the incidence vectors of stable sets of @xmath0 .",
    "a system @xmath7 of linear inequalities is called a _ defining linear system _ for the stable set polytope of a graph @xmath0 if stab(@xmath0 ) = @xmath8 holds and is @xmath9 if all inequalities are facet - defining ; the ( sub)graphs supporting such facet - defining inequalities are called facet - inducing graphs . as shown by padberg , there are two types of inequalities that are necessary for all graphs : the nonnegativity constraints @xmath10 for all vertices @xmath11 and the clique constraints @xmath12 for all inclusion - wise maximal cliques @xmath13 .",
    "those two types of inequalities yield a minimal defining linear system for stab(@xmath0 ) if and only if @xmath0 is a perfect graph @xcite .",
    "in particular a well known result due to chudnovsky et al .",
    "@xcite states that a graph is perfect if and only if it contains no induced odd holes and no induced odd co - holes .    finding such a system for the stable set polytope of general graphs is a difficult task , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "that seems to be difficult also for graphs for which a maximum ( weight ) stable set can be computed in polynomial time : that is the case e.g. of claw - free graphs , though deep partial results have been stated , see e.g. @xcite",
    ".    however , it is known ( see @xcite ) how to construct the defining linear system for a graph obtained from substitution of a graph @xmath14 for a vertex @xmath15 of a graph @xmath16 , provided that the defining linear system for stab(@xmath16 ) and for stab(@xmath16 ) are known .",
    "furthermore , it is known ( see e.g. @xcite ) that every non - trivial homogeneous set of a facet - inducing graph induces a facet - inducing graph as well . then for any graph class @xmath17 and for any @xmath18 , an implicit description of stab(@xmath0 ) is given by the set @xmath19 of prime facet - inducing graphs of @xmath20 .    in this paper",
    "we determine the set @xmath19 for the class @xmath21 of ( @xmath1,triangle)-free graphs and consequently give a complete description of stab(@xmath0 ) for every @xmath22 ( these results are then extended to ( @xmath1,paw)-free graphs ) .",
    "for that we combine , in analogy to the proof in @xcite for some extensions of @xmath23-free graphs , different tools : chvtal s results @xcite , properties of facet - inducing graphs due to mahjoub @xcite , a structure result on bipartite @xmath1-free graphs due to fouquet , giakoumakis , and vanherpe @xcite , and intensively a structure result on non - bipartite prime ( @xmath1,triangle)-free graphs due to brandstdt , klembt , and mahfud @xcite .",
    "also we point out some peculiarities of the new facet - inducing graphs detected along this study with the help of a software .",
    "the description of the stable set polytope for subclasses of triangle - free graphs may be of additional interest for the following reasons : ( i ) for triangle - free graphs the maximum stable set problem remains np - hard @xcite ; then the difficulty of describing their stable set polytope should be similar to that of the general case ; ( ii ) for triangle - free graphs no substitution is possible ( otherwise a triangle arises ) ; then the difficulty of describing their stable set polytope is directly linked to that of detecting prime facet - inducing graphs .",
