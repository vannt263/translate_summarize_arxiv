    "a typical example is the one dimensional quantum xyz model : @xmath2 which describes pairwise interactions with a homogeneous external magnetic field @xmath3 that acts locally on each spin .",
    "while these models are only an approximation to the real physics , they are rich enough to extract essential statistical properties of the underlying system .",
    "a striking phenomenon in many of these systems is the existence of a quantum phase transition ( qpt ) described by the analytic discontinuity in some thermodynamic quantity with the variation of a system interaction parameter . for the xy model ( @xmath4 )",
    "the qft is manifested by the divergence in the range of pairwise spin correlations at a critical magnetic field strength .",
    "given that long range classical correlations are present in the ground states of spin chains it is to be expected that these correlations can be related to functions quantifying quantum entanglement .",
    "several significant results have already been obtained for the xy model .",
    "it has been shown that a measure of entanglement between pairs of spins , the @xmath5-concurrence , experiences a qft at the same critical magnetic field strength as the transition point for classical spin correlations @xcite .",
    "these studies also show that in the isotropic , or xx model ( @xmath6 ) , the range of pairwise entanglement is infinite in the thermodynamic limit even though this case does not admit a qft .",
    "the entanglement in a bipartite division of a spin chain into two contiguous blocks has been studied in ref .",

    "the von neumann entropy of the reduced state of one block was used as the entanglement measure . by this measure , that the entanglement obeys universal scaling laws in accordance with conformal invariance . in another work",
    ", it was proven that there is another characterization of entanglement , the localizable entanglement @xmath7 , whose range is always at least as long as classical correlation lengths @xcite .",
    "the quantity @xmath7 is defined as the maximum pairwise entanglement that can be localized on two qubits , on average , by optimizing over local operations on the other qubits .    these investigations focused on bipartite entanglement between individual spins or blocks of spins .",
    "recently , it was shown that the notion of entanglement can be generalized beyond subsystems by computing the purity of state with respect to a chosen subalgebra @xcite .",
    "applied to the xy model , the relevant subalgebra is the set of number non - conserving fermionic operators that connect different irreducible representations of the unitary lie algebra @xmath8 , where @xmath0 is the number of modes .",
    "the purity can then be expressed in terms of fluctuations of the total fermion number and it is characterized by a second order qft at the critical magnetic field strength @xcite .    all of the aforementioned results add considerable insight into how nonlocal correlations between spins are distributed in the ground states of spin chain hamiltonians . in this paper we take a different approach to studying the entanglement of spin chains .",

    "a basic mathematical tool for studying entanglement is the entanglement monotone .",
    "it is a mathematical function that maps states to real numbers and exhibits two important properties .",
    "first , it is zero for separable states , i.e. those that can be described purely by classical probability distributions ; second , it is non - increasing on average under local operations and classical communication .",
    "there are many monotones to choose from that quantify entanglement in multipartite systems",
    ". the choice of measure may be best dictated by the underlying symmetries of the system if there are any .",
    "the monotone we study is concurrence .",
    "the @xmath5-concurrence was originally derived by wootters @xcite and later generalized to any even number of qubits @xmath0 @xcite . on a pure state @xmath9 the @xmath0-concurrence",
    "is defined @xmath10 where @xmath11 is an anti - unitary time - reversal operator .",
    "when acting on @xmath0 qubits , we can write @xmath12\\tau$ ] , where @xmath13 is the complex conjugation operator . the @xmath0-concurrence and its square , the @xmath0-tangle , have been shown to be entanglement monotones @xcite for @xmath0 even , and for @xmath0 odd are identically zero .",
    "the range of the measure is @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath0-concurrence is an attractive measure for two reasons .",
    "first , it is sensitive to global entanglement in the sense that it is zero if any qubit is separable from the rest of the system .",
    "this does not imply that each qubit is entangled with every other qubit , however .",
    "for instance , the @xmath0-party greenberger - horne - zeilinger ( ghz ) state @xmath15 is maximally concurrent but this can also be the case for sub - global entanglement , e.g. @xmath16 .",
    "furthermore , some entangled states have vanishing concurrence , e.g. @xmath17 $ ] . nevertheless , it is sensitive to entanglement described by superpositions of states and their spin flips .",
    "second , the @xmath0-concurrence measures the overlap of a quantum state with its time reversed state and it is thus a natural function to choose for eigenstates of a hamiltonian that respects this symmetry .",
    "any hamiltonian that can be written as a sum of tensors of an even number of non identity pauli operators only is time reversal symmetric .",
    "for example , exclusively pairwise interactions satisfy this condition @xmath18 this symmetry has important consequences with regard to entanglement of eigenstates .",
    "[ prop : us ] let @xmath19 be a hamiltonian on some number @xmath0 of quantum - bits .",

    "let @xmath21 be a fixed eigenvalue of @xmath19 .",
    "then either ( i ) @xmath21 is degenerate ( i.e. has multiplicity at least two , ) or ( ii ) the normalized eigenstate @xmath22 has @xmath23 . should @xmath24 , then case ( i ) always holds .    notice that if any spin does not interact with the others in a collection of spins then there will be a degeneracy .",
    "there are several examples of spin - chain hamiltonians with non - degenerate ground states . among them",
    "is the xyz hamiltonian with @xmath25 , also known as the heisenberg interaction .",
    "it s ground state was proven by lieb and mattis @xcite to be non - degenerate in any number of dimensions , with or without periodic boundary conditions provided the underlying lattice has reflection symmetry about some plane .",
    "additionally , in 1d , the xy hamiltonians with @xmath26 are non - degenerate @xcite .",
    "in this paper we focus on entanglement properties of the latter .    extending measures of entanglement on pure states to ensembles of pure states , or mixed states ,",
    "can be carried out by averaging over the entanglement of pure states in the ensemble .",
    "the choice of the state decomposition should not increase the amount of entanglement , therefore , the entanglement should be minimized over all valid decompositions of the state .",
    "this formulation is known as the convex roof of the function and for @xmath0-concurrence it is written : @xmath27 remarkably , the @xmath0-concurrence of a mixed state on @xmath0 even qubits can be expressed in closed form ( see appendix [ app ] ) : @xmath28 here @xmath29 , where @xmath30 denotes the spectrum of the operator @xmath31 , and @xmath32 is the dimension of the system .",

    "the presence of the magnetic field breaks the time reversal symmetry of the interaction .",
    "indeed , the magnetic field interaction @xmath36 contains a sum of terms involving only odd numbers of pauli operators and therefore it is time - reversal anti - symmetric @xcite : @xmath37 , i.e. @xmath38 we study how robust the @xmath0-concurrence of the ground state is to perturbation by the magnetic field .",

    "the lattice can be designed to trap an antiferromagnetic array of spin polarized atoms and the interactions can be engineered via  always on \" ground state collisions between nearest neighbor atoms in the lattice .",
    "the advantage of using trapped atoms is that the lattice can be loaded from an atomic bose einstein condensate ( bec ) which are routinely prepared at extremely low temperatures ( @xmath209 nk ) .",
    "for example , in a 1d lattice with 100 qubits at a temperature of @xmath210 nk , one would need interaction strengths of @xmath211 in order to be in the regime of non - zero @xmath0-concurrence and an interaction strength @xmath212 to be close to maximal @xmath0-concurrence .",
    "generating a sufficiently strong interaction between neutral atoms is challenging , however , for appropriately tuned trapped potentials the collisional interactions can be on the order of a few tens of kilohertz .",
    "we have investigated the behavior of many qubit entanglement in one dimensional spin chains .",
    "the entanglement measure used , the @xmath0-concurrence , is a global measure in the sense that its value goes to zero if any qubit is completely disentangled .",
    "this measure is appropriate in the context of spin chains because it probes the onset of a break in the time reversal symmetry when a magnetic field is introduced . for pure states in @xmath0",
    "even qubits , the @xmath0-concurrence is maximal at zero magnetic field . in the xx model , the entanglement is not immediately lost when a magnetic field perturbation is added , rather it jumps abruptly to zero at a critical magnetic field strength corresponding to the first degeneracy point . using the symmetry properties of the hamiltonian under conjugation by the time reversal operation we are able to obtain expressions for the entanglement of thermal systems of arbitrary size @xmath0 .",
    "the entanglement was shown to be finite below a certain critical magnetic field strength and threshold temperature .",
    "several outstanding issues remain .",
    "first , the objection may be raised that maximal @xmath0-concurrence in the ground states of @xmath82 does not imply global entanglement whatsoever because subglobal entanglement , i.e. tensor products of time reversal symmetric states , also have maximal @xmath208 ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : prop ] ) .",
    "however , it has been proven @xcite that the ground state of the xx model has non vanishing @xmath5-concurrence over all pair separations .",
    "hence , there can be no way to partition the ground state into disentangled subsets of qubits and therefore the entanglement is truly global .",
    "second , it is of interest to study how inhomogeneous couplings affect the @xmath0-concurrence .",
    "perhaps the behavior of global entanglement could give a signature of local defects .",
    "finally , because time reversal is not a spatial symmetry , it may be possible to investigate entanglement in the usually more complicated model of spin chains embedded in @xmath213 dimensions .",
    "another question for future research is whether the highly entangled ground state of a spin chain can be efficiently transformed into a state useful from the point of view of quantum information processing ( qip ) .",
    "spin chains are a promising architecture to implement many qip tasks such as entanglement distribution @xcite , quantum state swapping @xcite , and quantum computation @xcite .",
    "preparing and observing many - body entanglement will be an important first step to realizing these challenging tasks .",
    "it is appealing to try to generate useful entanglement by allowing the system to naturally cool to its ground state .",
    "the results obtained in this paper help define limits to the environmental conditions under which one type of entanglement ( the @xmath0-concurrence ) can be prepared in this way .",
    "it is known @xcite that all states of fixed @xmath0-concurrence are orbits of the lie ( symmetry ) group @xmath214 of all unitary evolutions which admit time reversal antisymmetric hamiltonains . in particular",
    ", there is some ( and there are many ) hamiltonian(s ) @xmath19 with @xmath215 and for @xmath216 .",
    "it is unclear whether there exist _ efficient _ operations in @xmath217 to transform from one to the other .",
    "this appendix expands upon published work of wootters and uhlmann @xcite , recalling their closed - form expression for the minimum eq .",
    "[ concmixed ] .",
    "it is , to our knowledge , the first treatment of this problem that is complete and self - contained .      for either scalars or vectors , we denote complex conjugates by an overline . also , we often use both real and complex operators .",
    "thus , we forego bra - ket notation in favor of the set @xmath218 of _ standard basis vectors _ , i.e. column matrices with @xmath219 . the symbols",
    "@xmath220 and @xmath221 denote @xmath222 real , complex matrices respectively .",
    "finally , we use a dagger for adjoint throughout .",
    "for example , @xmath223 is formally equivalent to a bra if the operator is intended to be complex .      throughout",
    ", we distinguish @xmath224 and @xmath225 as vector spaces over @xmath226 .",

    "equivalently , a unitary map is an orthogonal map which is also @xmath229-linear . adding a tad more language , as one speaks of the unitary group @xmath249 there is also a real symplectic group ( * ? ? ?",
