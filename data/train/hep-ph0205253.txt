    "<S> we apply continuum percolation to proton - proton collisions and look for the possible threshold to phase transition from confined nuclear matter to quark gluon plasma . making the assumption that j/@xmath0 suppression is a good signal to the transition , we discuss this phenomenon for @xmath1 collisions , in the framework of a dual model with strings .    and    in recent years , high energy heavy ion collision experiments have been trying to collect information on the possible existence of the plasma of quarks and gluon ( qgp ) . </S>",
    "<S> one of the strategies has been to look for differences in particle production between high density central heavy ion collisions , and low density ion collisions , nucleon - nucleus collisions and nucleon - nucleon collisions . at the cenr / sps ( @xmath2 gev ) and now at brookhaven / rhic ( @xmath3 gev ) several important general results have been obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> the charged particle density was found to increases with energy and the number of participating nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> the average transverse momentum also increases with energy and particle density , @xmath4 increases as well with the mass of the produced particle . </S>",
    "<S> strangeness increases with energy and particle density @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> all these results , naturally excluding the dependence on the number of participants , are qualitatively similar to results obtained in nucleon - nucleon and nucleon - nucleus collisions @xcite . none of them , separately , </S>",
    "<S> can then be taken as clear evidence for the formation of the qgp .    </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the anomalous suppression of the ratio j/@xmath0 over drell - yan production @xcite , at large associated transverse energy @xmath5 , has been widely accepted as good signal for qgp formation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , no such effect was seen in lower density nucleus - nucleus , nucleon - nucleus or nucleon - nucleon collisions .    in this note </S>",
    "<S> , we shall argue that if the j/@xmath0 suppression has its origin in the creation of an extended colour conducting region , as in percolation , the same kind of suppression should occur even in nucleon - nucleon ( @xmath1 or @xmath6 ) collisions at high enough energy .    </S>",
    "<S> we shall work here in the framework of multi - collision models , namely the dual parton model ( dpm ) @xcite , but try to be as general as possible . </S>",
    "<S> the basic ideas are : 1 ) nucleus - nucleus collisions can be built , in a non trivial manner , from nucleon - nucleon collisions ; 2 ) nucleon - nucleon collisions occur with formation of @xmath7 intermediate strings , strings are always in pairs , @xmath8 being a function of energy ; and 3 ) strings may fuse and percolate @xcite a process destroying naive additivity of elementary collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> the key parameter in transverse plane string percolation is the dimensionless tranverse density @xmath9 , with @xmath10    where @xmath11 is the tranverse radius of the string ( we shall take @xmath12 fm ) , @xmath13 the radius of the interaction area , and @xmath14 the number of strings . </S>",
    "<S> percolation occurs , in the @xmath15 , @xmath16 limit , for @xmath17 .    </S>",
    "<S> as fusion and percolation of strings also occur in nucleon - nucleon collisions it is clear that the j/@xmath0 over d.y . </S>",
    "<S> ratio will be strongly affected as @xmath9 approaches @xmath18 . in the @xmath1(@xmath6 ) </S>",
    "<S> case  ( [ eq : eta ] ) becomes @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the effective proton radius . as the observed increase of particle densities with energy is mostly due to the increase in the number of formed strings </S>",
    "<S> , @xmath21 is also an increasing function of energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus @xmath9 may reach @xmath18 and become larger than @xmath18 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies anomalous j/@xmath0 suppression .    following previous work </S>",
    "<S> @xcite we treat fusion and percolation of strings as a two dimensional continuum percolation problem @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we performed computer simulation by throwing @xmath22 discs ( of radius @xmath23 fm ) into a uniform region ( of radius of order of the radius of the proton , @xmath24 fm ) and counting the fraction of events @xmath25 with percolation . in the @xmath15 , </S>",
    "<S> @xmath26 limit @xmath25 becomes a step function with a sharp change at @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath28 is not so small , finite size effects are important , affecting mostly the slope ( @xmath29 ) of the function at @xmath18 , but the value of @xmath18 itself . </S>",
    "<S> the computer simulation results were fitted by the function , @xmath30 and the following values were found for the parameters : @xmath31 and @xmath32 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 )    assuming now , as in @xcite , that the j/@xmath0 production is prevented in a plasma of colour charges @xcite and that such situation corresponds to percolation and creation of a large conducting area @xcite we obtain for the j/@xmath0 over drell - yan ratio , @xmath33^{-1 } \\ , ,            \\label{eq:4}\\ ] ] where @xmath34 @xcite is the value of the ratio at moderate energy .    </S>",
    "<S> the problem now is simply the problem of relating @xmath9 to @xmath35 ,  ( [ eq : eta1 ] ) . in other words , </S>",
    "<S> we need to obtain a reasonable estimate for the energy dependence of @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this is what we shall attempt now .    </S>",
    "<S> if in nucleus - nucleus collisions @xmath36 is the average number of nucleon - nucleon collisions and @xmath7 is the number of strings per nucleon - nucleon collision , the average number of strings @xmath37 is given by , @xmath38    in nucleon - nucleon collisions @xmath39 and @xmath40 . from  ( [ eq : eta ] ) and  ( [ eq:5 ] ) the condition for the percolation transition , in the case of @xmath41 , is @xmath42    by interpreting the na50 anomalous j/@xmath0 suppression at @xmath43 gev as the result of percolation , one can try to estimate the number of formed strings in nucleon - nucleon collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the basic information is that anomalous suppression is absent in s - u central collisions , but it is present in pb - pb central collisions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this means , @xmath44 and @xmath45 .    at relatively low energy , it is known , from na49 and wa98 , sps experiments , that the number of nucleon - nucleon collisions in central nucleus - nucleus collisions is , roughly,(see , for instance @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the number of participants in a central ab , a@xmath48b , collision , @xmath49 on the other hand @xmath50 by using  ( [ eq:7 ] ) ,  ( [ eq:8 ] ) and  ( [ eq:9 ] ) in  ( [ eq:6 ] ) we obtain , from s - u @xmath51 and , from pb - pb , @xmath52 as we are not so confident with these estimates we shall include an error of the order of 15% and study the ratio j/@xmath0 over dy in the range @xmath53    if we look now at the charged particle densities in @xmath1(@xmath6 ) collisions , in the spirit of dpm , we have that particles are emitted from two kinds of strings : valence strings(v ) , always 2 from valence quark interactions and shorter sea strings(s ) , from sea parton interactions , in a number growing with energy , @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> the central charged particle density is written as(see , for instance , @xcite and @xcite ) , @xmath55 on the right hand side of  ( [ eq:13 ] ) we have both contributions , from v and s strings .    </S>",
    "<S> we assume that @xmath56 and @xmath57 are constant ( `` feynman scaling '' ) and that the observed rise of the plateau is determined by the increase in the number of strings , i.e. , by increase of @xmath21 . in the low energy limit , @xmath58 </S>",
    "<S> , we thus have feynman scaling with , from data @xcite , @xmath59    in order to determine the energy dependence of @xmath21 we do the following . </S>",
    "<S> solve de equation  ( [ eq:13 ] ) for @xmath21 , with @xmath56 fixed by  ( [ eq:14 ] ) and using for @xmath60 a parameterization to the @xmath1(@xmath6 ) data @xcite , @xmath61    for each of the limiting values of @xmath62  ( [ eq:12 ] ) , combined with the limiting values of @xmath56  ( [ eq:14 ] ) , we adjust the constant @xmath57 to obtain agreement with  ( [ eq:15 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the fit to @xmath60 high energy data for @xmath63 gev is shown in ( fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:2 ] ) .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig:3 ] we present the @xmath35 dependence of the j/@xmath0 over dy ratio , equation  ( [ eq:4 ] ) and  ( [ eq : eta1 ] ) , for the two limiting values of @xmath21 . in conclusion : we expect a fast drop of j/@xmath0 over dy ratio in @xmath1(@xmath6 ) collisions in the energy range @xmath64 gev / nucleon . </S>",
    "<S> these are energies of rihc and tevatron .    </S>",
    "<S> our work can be criticized from several different points of view :    1 .   </S>",
    "<S> the j/@xmath0 over dy ratio is also affected by internal absorption and as the number of strings increases with energy , absorption makes the ratio continuously decrease with energy . </S>",
    "<S> this effect was not included . </S>",
    "<S> 2 .   as charm production probability increases with energy the j/@xmath0 over dy ratio should have a tendency to increase with energy . </S>",
    "<S> this correction was also not included . </S>",
    "<S> one should , perhaps , in future consider the ratio j/@xmath0 over @xmath65 production as the reference quantity . </S>",
    "<S> 3 .   as in @xmath1(@xmath6 ) </S>",
    "<S> collisions the interaction radius increases slowly with energy the critical value of @xmath9 , @xmath18 , should decrease with energy . </S>",
    "<S> however the important effect is the actual decrease of @xmath66 with the consequence that the percolation transition occurs at higher value of energy . </S>",
    "<S> 4 .   </S>",
    "<S> the model is purely soft model and hard effects related to the increase of @xmath4 and changes in multiplicities were not included . </S>",
    "<S> these effects can be accounted for with fusion of strings but were not considered here . </S>",
    "<S> they are being studied now . </S>",
    "<S> 5 .   </S>",
    "<S> non - uniform distributions in impact parameter ( like gaussian distributions ) give rise to an increase of @xmath18 ( see last paper in@xcite ) , and consequently the percolation transition will tends to be displaced to higher energy . </S>",
    "<S> 6 .   </S>",
    "<S> one may question the validity of continuum percolation arguments when the ratio @xmath28 is so large , @xmath67 . </S>",
    "<S> technically there is no problem , but we are not sure of the validity of the treatment .    while finishing this paper we became aware of the work of t. alexopoulos et al . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite dealing with evidence for deconfinement at tevatron ( @xmath68 tev ) . </S>"
