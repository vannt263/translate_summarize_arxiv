    "one means of probing the nature of the phase diagram and the effective hydrophobic interactions would be by systematic alteration of the polarity of the amphiphilic polymers in solution .",
    "many theoretical and experimental studies have been conducted to describe the various aggregation phases of amphiphilic molecules in aqueous solutions  @xcite .",

    "the solvation of amphiphiles in aqueous solutions and their self - association into micellar aggregates are genreally considered as a consequence of the effective hydrophobic interaction between polar water and the non - polar regions of the solute molecules  @xcite .",
    "the unique properties of the aqueous medium which generate this interaction arise from the ability of water molecules to form strong hydrogen bonds both among themselves and with the polar groups of solute molecules .",
    "the formation and disruption of extended hydrogen - bonded networks leads directly to the delicate balance of enthalpic and entropic contributions to the solvent free energy which is responsible for the existence of a closed - loop aggregation regime in many solutions of polar molecules .",
    "this behavior is encapsulated in an adapted version of the model of muller , lee and graziano ( mlg )  @xcite , whose key features are as follows : consideration of a coarse - grained system whose sites contain clusters of water molecules of a size which matches that of the solute particles ; a bimodal distribution of water clusters reflecting `` ordered '' sites with mostly intact hydrogen bonds , and `` disordered '' sites with relatively fewer intact hydrogen bonds ; a further subdivision into `` shell '' sites neighboring the solute particles and `` bulk '' sites which are not disrupted by proximity to a polar surface ; a set of microscopic energy and degeneracy parameters for these sites whose sequences are determined by the fact that breaking of hydrogen bonds increases site enthalpy but simultaneously raises the site degeneracy ( number of orientational degrees of freedom of the water molecules ) , as represented in fig .  [ figmlg ] .",

    "@xcite . here",
    "we highlight the competition of enthalpy and entropy terms using only the example of the ordered states .",
    "although the insertion of a hydrophobic molecule leads to a destruction of local hydrogen - bonding , at low temperatures the water molecules are found to rearrange in a cage - like structure around the solute molecule , which because of the orientational effect of the polar surface is formed by stronger hydrogen bonds .",
    "the consequent net energy reduction results in dissolution of the solute particle  @xcite . at higher temperatures , however , the additional entropic contributions available from the bulk solvent favor a minimization of local water restructuring , which drives the aggregation of hydrophobic solute particles to minimize their total surface exposed to water .    while it is possible to find perfect cages of hydrogen bonds for small hydrophobic particles , the formation of complete cages around large solute particles is prevented sterically .",
    "however , such large solute particles , and also their aggregates , may instead be surrounded by a number of partial cages , depending on their shape and surface roughness  @xcite .",
    "atomic groups exposed at the surfaces of large molecules and aggregates present locally curved surface structures @xcite which allow for a confined formation of partial cages .",
    "the lipid molecules we analyze ( see fig .  1 ) have a characteristic lengthscale of order 0.3 nm for the diameter of the chain and any side groups , 0.5 nm for the polar head , and a maximum length of 2 - 3 nm for the longer chains .",
    "the chain and head diameters are the lengthscales which determine the curvature of the molecule , and thus the possibility for cage formation .",
    "the considerations of the previous paragraph , specifically low - temperature solution , are then expected to remain valid for amphiphilic and lipid molecules , and this is confirmed by the success of models based on these concepts in describing large molecular species  @xcite . that the analysis is applicable for solute particles with a certain degree of curvature and surface roughness does not appear to be a significant restriction for molecules in the size range of most interest for amphiphilic and lipid characteristics .    returning to the parameters of fig .",
    "[ figmlg ] , we stress that the properties of the sysytem are critically dependent on the sequences @xmath4 of energy levels and @xmath5 of the corresponding degeneracies , which describe the entropy .",
    "these sequences are confirmed by a range of experimental measurements , and indeed if they are not maintained the solution does not exhibit a closed - loop aggregation regime .",
    "however , the results of the calculations to follow are not particularly sensitive to the exact values of the differences between these parameters , and are of course independent of their absolute values . we have used the energy values @xmath6 , and @xmath7 , which are thought to be qualitatively representative for aqueous solutions , and which have been successful in describing different types of solution  @xcite .",
    "the respective degeneracies , normalized to a non - degenerate ordered shell conformation , are taken to be @xmath8 and @xmath9  @xcite .",
    "these relative values have been found to be appropriate for reproducing the phenomenology of hydrophobic interactions  @xcite , protein denaturation  @xcite , swelling of biopolymers  @xcite , and cosolvent effects on solubility of hydrophobic particles  @xcite .",
    "precise values of the microscopic parameters may in fact be refined by comparison with experimental measurements to yield semi - quantitative agreement for different solutions  @xcite .",
    "the energy scale is correlated directly with a relative temperature scale , which we define as @xmath10 .      to include not only purely hydrophobic solute particles but also amphiphilic molecules with varying conformations of polar and non - polar regions , as in the experiments of ref .",
    "@xcite , we represent the particles as cubes on which each face may be either polar or hydrophobic . a neighboring water site , which is homogeneously polar , interacts only with the side of the particle which is oriented in its direction .",
    "if this side represents a polar group , the neighboring water site is in a bulk state , whereas if the side is hydrophobic the water site is considered a shell state .",

    "lipids with a longer tail have more pronounced characteristics of hydrophobic solute particles than do lipids where the polar head represents a considerable fraction of the molecule .",
    "the solubility of long - tailed lipids is therefore lower than that of short - tailed ones , causing a decrease in lcst , an increase in ucst , and a decreased cmc at any given temperature as the tail becomes longer . for the parameters used in the model",
    "we find that an increase from @xmath117 to @xmath119 already enhances the coexistence region substantially , and for that @xmath123 the system is completely separated into pure water and essentially perfect micelles of density @xmath146 over a wide temperature range , which is fully consistent with experiment  @xcite .    a quantitative measure of micelle formation in amphiphilic and lipid systems is provided by the contact densities @xmath147 and @xmath148 , normalized by the corresponding probabilities of the contacts in a random system ( figs .

    "we have found fewer contacts between hydrophobic faces and more hydrophobic - polar contacts than would be expected for a random distribution below the lcst , indicating highly dissolved solute molecules . above the lcst",
    "this picture is inverted , thus confirming the aggregation of amphiphiles and lipids , and the separation of the solution into two phases . from a knowledge of the system geometry and densities , the values of the contact ratios may also be used to confirm the extent of solution or aggregation , and also the effective `` purity '' of the micelles which form for different polar distributions on the solute molecules . at temperatures in excess of the ucst , the solution approaches a random mixture due to dominant entropy effects ; in monte carlo studies the relative contact densities approach unity continuously , rather than undergoing a sharp transition .",
    "we close by emphasizing again the limits of our analysis .",
    "we have formulated a model for an aqueous solution using a minimal set of assumptions ; we have used an extremely crude representation of amphiphilic molecules , and have considered only a cubic system as the foundation on which our `` micelles '' are constrained to form .",
    "nevertheless , we have obtained a realistic set of aggregation phenomena and a surprising degree of agreement with the available experimental results .",
    "there are , however , several examples of phenomena which are beyond the reach of the model at its current level of refinement .",
    "a solution of lipids in water may produce a lamellar phase of bilayers at low temperature and rather high densities  @xcite .",
    "bilayer formation requires the possibility of smooth curvature and high flexibility  @xcite , and is precluded in the monte carlo simulations by geometrical constraints presented by the lattice .",
    "for the same geometrical reasons it is also difficult to find well - formed micelles in the more general case of amphiphiles in water .",
    "a further limitation is that the model considers explicitly the energy states of water sites , and therefore no distinction is made among p - p , h - h , s - h , and s - s contacts . because there is also no difference between a group of water molecules and the polar face of a solute particle , the model a llows amphiphiles to occur in the core of micelles , where their polar sides are in direct contact with those of other amphiphiles . for lipids , an s - h contact which is formed during the monte carlo simulation is as favorable as an s - s contact , although it is more likely to be broken in a later step .",
    "in addition , the orientation of a lipid molecule is irrelevant for the formation of an s - s contact , which prevents efficient alignment of the heads and may further hinder the formation of extended bilayers .",
    "the incorporation of these distinctions in a more sophisticated description of the lipid solution may be expected to reproduce further detailed properties of real systems .    in summary , we have extended the mlg framework to include the solvation of amphiphilic solutes in water . within a cubic hp model",
    "we have found the aggregation of solute particles , and the formation of various types of micelle as a function of the distribution of hydrophobic regions . by successive substitution of hydrophobic sides by polar ones",
    ", we have studied the aggregation behavior and the influence of the degree of hydrophobicity on the upper and lower critical solution temperatures .",
    "we have refined this model to describe lipid molecules of varying length , by adapting the interaction of the hydrophobic tail to include a corresponding number of neighboring water molecules , and have demonstrated the enhanced stability of aggregates with increasing tail length ( increasing hydrophobicity ) .",
    "we have shown that primary features of micelle formation , which are often attributed solely to the amphiphilic nature of the solute particles under consideration , are reproduced by our extension of the solvent - based mlg model to describe alterations of water structure in the vicinity of the different surface regions of dissolved amphiphiles ."
