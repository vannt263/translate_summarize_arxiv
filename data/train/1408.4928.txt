    "recent measurements of the basic double - pionic fusion to the deuteron , which comprises the reaction channels @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , reveal a narrow resonance - like structure in the total cross section at a mass @xmath9 2380 mev with a width of @xmath10 70 mev @xcite . from the isospin decomposition of the cross sections in the three fusion channels the isoscalar nature of this structure",
    "has been determined @xcite , whereas the determination of its spin - parity @xmath11 has been obtained from the angular distributions in the @xmath12 channel , which has a particularly low background from conventional reaction processes @xcite .",
    "further support for this resonance structure has been found in the @xmath13 reaction @xcite , where it was denoted by @xmath0  following its notation associated with the so - called `` inevitable '' dibaryon @xcite having identical quantum numbers .",
    "if the observed resonance - like structure constitutes an @xmath14-channel resonance in the neutron - proton system , then it has to be sensed also in the observables of elastic @xmath15 scattering . in ref .",
    "@xcite this resonance effect in @xmath15 scattering has been estimated and it was shown that a noticeable effect should appear in the analyzing power @xmath1 .",
    "this observable is most sensitive to small changes in the partial waves , since it is composed only of interference terms between partial waves .    for the analyzing power ,",
    "there are data only below and above the resonance region . these data sets , at @xmath16  =  1.095 gev ( @xmath17 = 2.36 gev ) @xcite and @xmath16  =  1.27 gev ( @xmath17 = 2.43 gev ) @xcite , exhibit very similar angular distributions .",
    "this gap in the existing measurements of @xmath1 has motivated the present study , the main results of which have been communicated recently already in a letter @xcite .",
    "the measurements of polarized @xmath18 elastic scattering over the energy region of interest have been carried out in the quasifree mode .",
    "the experiment was performed with the wasa detector @xcite at the cosy storage ring by use of a polarized deuteron beam of energy of @xmath5  =  2.27  gev , which impinged on the wasa hydrogen pellet target . utilizing the quasifree scattering process the full energy region of the conjectured resonance",
    "was covered .",
    "since we observe here the quasi - free scattering process @xmath19 in inverse kinematics , we were able to detect the fast spectator proton in the forward detector of wasa .    since elastic @xmath15 scattering has a large cross section , it was sufficient to have a trigger , which solely requested one hit in the first layer of the forward range hodoscope .",
    "such a hit could originate from either a charged particle or a neutron .",
    "for the case of quasifree @xmath15 scattering we thus have three event classes , with each of them having the spectator proton hit the forward detector :    * \\(i ) both scattered proton and scattered neutron are detected in the central detector .",
    "this event type covers the region @xmath20 of neutron angles . *",
    "\\(ii ) the scattered proton is detected in the forward detector , whereas the scattered neutron is not measured .",
    "this type concerns the region @xmath21 . *",
    "\\(iii ) the scattered proton is detected in the central detector with the neutron being unmeasured , since its scattering angle is outside the angular range of the central detector .",
    "this event type covers the angular range @xmath22 .",
    "thus nearly the full range of neutron scattering angles could be covered by use of all three event classes .",
    "since by use of inverse kinematics the spectator proton resides in the deuteron beam particle , the emitted spectator proton is very fast , which facilitates its detection in the forward detector .",
    "thus by reconstructing emission angles and kinetic energy the full four - momentum of the spectator proton can be determined .",
    "the four - momentum of the actively scattered proton has been obtained from its track information in either the forward or the central detector . in the latter case",
    "the energy information was not retrieved .    in the case",
    "that the actively scattered proton has been detected together with its scattering partner , the neutron ( case ( i ) ) , we checked in addition , whether the angular correlation for elastic kinematics is fulfilled .",
    "that way we were able to reconstruct the full event , which includes also the four - momentum of the neutron . in the case that the neutron was not measured , the subsequent kinematic fit had one overconstraint in case ( ii ) and none in case ( iii ) . in the case that the neutron could be detected by a hit in the calorimeter ( composed of 1012 csi(na ) crystals ) of the central detector  associated with no hit in the preceding plastic scintillator barrel , the directional information of the scattered neutron could be retrieved .",
    "therefore , such events , which correspond to case ( i ) , have undergone a kinematic fit with two overconstraints .      in order not to distort",
    "the beam polarization , the magnetic field of the solenoid in the central detector was switched off .",
    "the measurements have been carried out with cycles of the beam polarization `` up '' , `` down '' and unpolarized ( originating from the same polarized source ) , where `` up '' and `` down '' refers to a horizontal scattering plane .",
    "runs with the conventional unpolarized source verified that the beam originating from the polarized source indeed was unpolarized when using it in its `` unpolarized '' mode .",
    "the magnitude of the beam polarization has been determined and monitored by @xmath23 elastic scattering , which was measured in parallel by detecting the scattered deuteron in the forward detector as well as the associated scattered proton in the central detector . in case of a transversally polarized deuteron beam the dependence of the count rate @xmath24 on the polar and azimuthal scattering angles @xmath25 and @xmath26 is given by      here @xmath28 and @xmath29 denote vector and tensor polarization of the deuteron beam , whereas @xmath1 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are the respective vector and tensor analyzing powers of the @xmath23 scattering process .    with wasa covering the full azimuthal angular range , we may decompose vector and tensor parts by fitting the observed azimuthal angular dependence for specific polar angles by use of eq .",
    "the absolute values for the vector and tensor components of the deuteron beam have been obtained by fitting our results for the vector @xmath1 ( fig .  1 , top ) and tensor analyzing power @xmath31 ( fig .  1 , bottom ) in absolute height to those obtained previously at anl @xcite for @xmath5 = 2.0 gev .",
    "though this energy is somewhat below the one used here , the analyzing powers in @xmath32 scattering have been observed @xcite to be only weakly dependent on the beam energy .",

    "since we have measurements with spin `` up '' , `` down '' and unpolarized , the vector analyzing power for @xmath15 scattering can be derived in three different ways by using each two of the three spin situations .",

    "since we deal here only with 0 - 2 overconstraints in the kinematic fits , the @xmath17 determination is less precise than , _",
    "e.g. _ , in the @xmath61 reaction , where we have three overconstraints in the case that the proton spectator is not detected .",
    "the new @xmath1 data have been included in the said database and the phenomenological approach used in generating the @xmath62 partial - wave solution , sp07  @xcite , has been retained .",
    "here we are simply considering whether the existing form is capable of describing the new @xmath1 measurements .",
    "one advantage of this approach is that the employed chew - mandelstam k - matrix can produce a pole in the complex energy plane without the explicit inclusion of a k - matrix pole in the fit form .",
    "neither the existence of a pole nor the effected partial waves are predetermined .",
    "the energy - dependent fits use a product s - matrix approach as described in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite with @xmath63 being an exchange part , including the one - pion - exchange piece , plus smooth phenomenological terms , and @xmath64 , a production part .",
    "the full s matrix is @xmath65 where @xmath66 for spin - uncoupled waves , the production t - matrix is parameterized using a chew - mandelstam k - matrix , as is also used in the gw @xmath67  @xcite and @xmath68  @xcite analyses , with @xmath69 where @xmath70 is a phase space factor , @xmath71 is a real symmetric matrix coupling the @xmath62 and an inelastic channel , and @xmath72 is a chew - mandelstam matrix . for isovector waves , the inelastic channel is identified as @xmath73 ; in the isoscalar case , this inelastic channel is generic . for spin - uncoupled waves , the matrices are @xmath74 ; for coupled waves , the matrices are @xmath75 , as described in ref .",
    "the global energy - dependent fit includes @xmath34 data from threshold up to a lab kinetic energy of 3 gev , and @xmath15 data from threshold up to 2 gev .",
    "since above 1.3 gev the amount of @xmath15 data is sparse , the fit is considered to be valid only up to 1.3 gev for the @xmath15 case .",
    "single - energy ( narrow energy bin ) fits are also carried out , with constraints on the energy - dependence over a particular energy bin fixed to the underlying global analysis .",
    "the new @xmath1 data are angular distributions at @xmath76 values of 1.108 , 1.125 , 1.135 , 1.139 , 1.156 , 1.171 , and 1.197 gev .",
    "starting from the functional form of the current sp07 fit , and only varying the associated free parameters , a @xmath77/datum of 1.8 was found for all angular distributions apart from the one at 1.135 gev .",
    "this is fairly consistent with the overall @xmath77/datum given by the global fit of @xmath15 to 2 gev .",
    "however , the set at 1.135 gev contributes a @xmath77/datum of about 25 , has better statistics and a wider angular coverage .",
    "the fit form was scanned to find partial waves for which an added term in the k - matrix expansion produced the most efficient reduction in @xmath77 .",
    "adding parameters and re - fitting resulted in a rapid variation of the coupled @xmath2 and @xmath3 waves in the vicinity of the problematic 1.135 gev data set .",
    "some weighting seemed necessary in this fit , as only a few angular points from the full set were determining the altered energy dependence .",
    "the fit was repeated with different weightings ( with a factor of 2 or 4 ) for the new @xmath1 data .",
    "initially , the full set of energies was weighted equally .",
    "however , it was found that just weighting the 1.135 gev angular distribution improved the fit to the new analyzing power data at all energies .",
    "the results reported here thus considered only the weighting at this single energy . as we have seen in fits to other reactions , heavily weighting new and precise polarization observables inevitably degrades the fit to older data .",
    "therefore , as a test , the parameterization producing a pole was re - fitted to the full database with no weighting .",
    "this gave , as expected , a worse fit to the 1.135 gev angular distribution but did not change the shape qualitatively .    in figs .",
    "4 - 6 and 9 -11 we plot the sp07 prediction ( not including the new data ) , a weighted fit ( errors decreased by a factor of 4 ) , and an unweighted fit including the new data and using the fit form having added parameters .",

    "as pointed out by hhler @xcite both argand diagram and speed plot allow also the determination of the modulus r of the residue , which corresponds to just half of the partial decay width @xmath83 of the resonance into the elastic channel .",

    "exactly such a state with identical quantum numbers has been predicted first by dyson and xuang @xcite based on su(6 ) symmetry breaking already in 1964  just shortly after gell - mann s publication of the quark model @xcite . whereas this dibaryon state",

    "the first one has been studied at wasa and is on the way of being published .",
    "the latter channel has been measured at hades and preliminary results have been reported already at conferences .",

    "together with the results of the new calculations based on quark @xcite and/or hadron dynamics @xcite this might give some confidence in the predictive power of these theoretical considerations on further dibaryon states .",
    "we finally note that very recently an alternative explanation of the wasa data has been suggested by d. v. bugg @xcite . among the issuses raised in this paper we just mention here one .",
    "the specific intermediate @xmath115 system proposed for the production of the narrow resonance - like structure is not restricted to the isoscalar channel and hence should show up both in @xmath15 and @xmath34 initiated two - pion production . however , as we have shown , this narrow resonance structure is missing in all @xmath34-initiated two - pion production channels including double - pionic fusion @xcite .",
