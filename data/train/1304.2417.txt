    "much of the motivation for dark matter in the form of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimps ) has been based on the observation that if there exists a stable particle species with a weak - scale mass and annihilation cross section , it will be thermally produced in the early universe in a quantity similar to the measured abundance of dark matter  @xcite . in no particle physics framework has this been considered in more detail than in that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) , with dark matter in the form the of the lightest neutralino  @xcite .",
    "dark matter candidates motivated by this argument are also interesting from an experimental perspective ; it has long been appreciated that such particles could eventually be detected and observed through their interactions with nuclei  @xcite .",
    "as the sensitivity of direct detection experiments has improved , however , this appeal has begun to become something of a liability ; for many wimp candidates , the very interactions that enable them to annihilate and avoid being overproduced in the early universe also lead to elastic scattering cross sections with nuclei that are in excess of the constraints currently provided by the leading direct detection experiments .    as a simple illustration ,",
    "consider a dark matter candidate in the form of a majorana fermion , which annihilates into standard model fermions through couplings proportional to mass ( such as a neutralino annihilating through the exchange of a pseudoscalar higgs boson ) . turning this annihilation diagram on its side ( and replacing the pseuodoscalar with a scalar higgs boson ) , this interaction induces an elastic scattering cross section between the dark matter and nuclei , typically dominated by couplings to the strange quark content of the nucleon , and to gluons through heavy quark loops  @xcite .",
    "if the exchanged particles are much heavier than the dark matter particle , we can use effective field theory to relate the elastic scattering cross section by a crossing symmetry to the cross section for annihilation  @xcite . for a 100 gev dark matter candidate with couplings chosen to yield the desired thermal relic abundance , this leads to a coherent ( spin - independent ) elastic scattering cross section with nucleons that is on the order of a few times @xmath9 pb .",
    "this is in considerable excess of existing constraints from direct detection experiments  @xcite .",
    "the xenon100 collaboration , in particular , excludes elastic scattering cross sections that are greater than approximately @xmath10 pb for 100 gev wimps .",
    "this simple example ( and many others like it - exchange ( such as sneutrinos , or fourth generation neutrinos  @xcite ) predict rates at direct detection experiments that are currently ruled out by several orders of magnitude . ] ) shows that direct detection experiments are currently capable of excluding many dark matter candidates motivated by the thermal production arguments . in light of these considerations",
    ", we can ask what types of mechanisms or features might enable a dark matter candidate to evade such constraints . broadly speaking , there at least five ways in which such arguments can be circumvented :    * the dark matter",
    "is depleted in the early universe though coannihilations with another particle , rather than through self - annihilations  @xcite . *",
    "only a subdominant fraction of dark matter annihilations produce quarks , but instead proceed to states such as leptons , gauge bosons , and/or higgs bosons .",
    "* the wimp is sufficiently light as to fall below the detection thresholds of the most sensitive direct detection experiments ( @xmath11@xmath12@xmath13 gev )  @xcite . * after inflation , the universe was never reheated to temperatures sufficient for the dark matter to reach thermal equilibrium . *",
    "the dark matter annihilates efficiently through an @xmath14-channel resonance  @xcite .    within the context of the mssm ,",
    "three of these possibilities are most commonly discussed .",
    "coannihilation regions of parameter space ( with staus , charginos , stops , and other sparticles ) are currently viable , so long as the lightest neutralino is only slightly less massive than the next lightest state ( typically within a few percent , although stop coannihilations can be effective with larger mass splittings ) . in the bulk and focus point regions of the mssm , most neutralino annihilations proceed to gauge and/or higgs bosons , relaxing the impact of direct detection constraints to some extent",
    ". that being said , the most recent constraints from xenon100 appear to rule out nearly all of the remaining focus point parameter space  @xcite ( as well as much of the more general parameter space associated with dark matter in the form of a `` well - tempered '' neutralino  @xcite ) ; see , however , ref .",
    "if the lightest supersymmetric particle is a relatively pure wino or higgsino , its annihilations can proceed overwhelmingly to gauge boson final states , enabling current direct detection constraints to be evaded , especially if @xmath8 is very large  @xcite . and",
    "lastly , the lightest neutralino can annihilate through the resonant exchange of a higgs or @xmath5 boson .",
    "particularly efficient is the so - called @xmath15-funnel region of parameter space , in which the resonant exchange of the pseudoscalar higgs can efficiently deplete the abundance of neutralinos in the early universe without exceeding direct detection constraints .    in this paper ,",
    "we focus on the last of these possibilities , and determine the level to which the mssm @xmath15-funnel resonance must be tuned ( _ ie_. how close to @xmath16 we must set @xmath8 ) in order to evade the constraints from xenon100 and other direct detection experiments .",
    "we also project how this required degree of tuning is expected to increase as direct detection constraints become more stringent ( assuming no detection is made ) , eventually closing the @xmath15-funnel region entirely .",
    "we also present a similar analysis for the light higgs and @xmath5 pole regions , as well as more general arguments pertaining to a broad class of resonant annihilating dark matter models .",
    "the tree level diagrams for neutralino - quark spin - independent elastic scattering include @xmath17-channel cp - even higgs exchange and @xmath14-channel squark exchange . in light of stringent constraints on squark and gluino masses from the lhc  @xcite , and in order to focus on the @xmath15-funnel region , we set all sfermion and gaugino masses ( except @xmath18 ) to a high mass scale , @xmath19 .",
    "after this simplifying set of assumptions , the following parameter set completely defines our mssm : @xmath20    here , @xmath8 is the mass of the pseudoscalar higgs , @xmath21 is the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two higgs doublets , @xmath18 is the bino mass , @xmath22 is the higgsino mass parameter , and @xmath23 is the common trilinear coupling .",
    "we begin by imposing two constraints : that the thermal relic density of neutralinos ( as calculated using micromegas  @xcite ) falls within the dark matter abundance as reported by wmap  @xcite , and that the mass of the lightest higgs boson ( as calculated using feynhiggs  @xcite ) falls within the range reported by atlas and cms ( which we generously take to be 123 - 128 gev ) . in practice",
    ", we use this pair of constraints to set the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : mu - a0 ] , we show the relic density and higgs mass as a function of @xmath22 and @xmath23 for the case of @xmath24tev , @xmath25gev , @xmath26gev , and @xmath27 . from these figures ,",
    "it is clear that these constraints are nearly orthogonal on the @xmath23-@xmath22 parameter space , making it possible to fix both of these values .    with the values of @xmath22 and @xmath23 set ( for any given combination of @xmath19 , @xmath8 , @xmath18 and @xmath28 )",
    ", we proceed to evaluate the elastic scattering cross section of the lightest neutralino and compare this to constraints from xenon100 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbeta ] , we plot this cross section as a function of @xmath18 ( which in most cases shown is roughly equal to the mass of the lightest neutralino ) , for several values of @xmath8 and @xmath21 .",
    "+    .    .",
    "as anticipated , the xenon100 constraint rules out any value of @xmath18 up to @xmath11 tev that is not fairly close to the @xmath15 resonance ( @xmath29 ) . for values near the resonance , however , these direct detection constraints can be evaded .",
    "note that we only plot results for parameter values that yield acceptable relic densities and higgs masses .",
    "for example , there are no values at all for @xmath30 , while the thick black line for @xmath31 extends only a short distance up the funnel ( for small @xmath28 , the higgs mass can not be made large enough without introducing problems with vacuum stability ) .",
    "note that the @xmath32 and 60 contours in the @xmath33 gev frame have been excluded by the lhc  @xcite , and should be taken only as a point of comparison .    to ensure that the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbeta ] do not depend strongly on our ( somewhat arbitrary ) choice of @xmath19 , we consider the impact of this parameter in the left frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : m0-ma ] . as can be seen ,",
    "while the depth of the @xmath15-funnel ( the minimum elastic scattering cross section ) depends mildly on the value of @xmath19 that is being considered , this variation is quite small compared to the much larger range shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbeta ] . throughout the entire range of @xmath19 and @xmath8 ,",
    "the minimum cross section for @xmath15-funnel models is always within a factor of a few of @xmath34 pb .    for a viable thermal neutralino model to predict such a small elastic scattering cross section , the parameters @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath28 must each take on rather specific values .",
    "first of all , at the very bottom of the funnel , annihilations are very efficient , and @xmath35 must be very large ( and the neutralino s couplings to the @xmath15 must be very small ) to accommodate the measured dark matter abundance , as evident in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : m0-ma ] .",
    "as noted earlier , we also require large values of @xmath23 ( typically 1.3 - 2.5@xmath19 ) to accommodate the higgs mass measured at the lhc .",
    "the maximum depth of the funnel occurs for intermediate values of @xmath21 , typically around @xmath1@xmath13 .",
    "lastly , we note that we have not explicitly scanned over negative values of @xmath22 in this study . in the case of negative @xmath22 , loop - level cancellations can in some cases enhance the @xmath15 and @xmath36 decay widths  @xcite , potentially making the @xmath15-funnel more broad and less deep .",
    "furthermore , the coupling of the lightest neutralino to the light higgs can be suppressed relative to the positive case . in the parameter space with small or moderate @xmath28 and high @xmath8 ( where the elastic scattering is dominated by light higgs exchange )",
    ", the choice of negative @xmath22 can lead to direct detection rates that are smaller by a factor of a few than those presented here  @xcite .",
    "when direct detection experiments become sensitive to dark matter - nucleon cross sections as small as @xmath37 pb , the @xmath15-funnel region of supersymmetric parameter space will be ruled out .",
    "current constraints are three orders of magnitude away from this sensitivity , however , and it will most likely be another decade or more before such tiny cross sections will be probed .",
    "fortunately , it is unlikely that nature will be described by a dark matter model that lies at the absolute minimum of such a resonance . in this section",
    ", we will quantify how precisely one needs to tune such a resonance in order for neutralino dark matter to provide the measured thermal abundance without violating current and projected direct detection constraints .    at present , in order for an @xmath15-funnel model to be viable , the neutralino mass must be fine tuned to a modest degree , not far from @xmath38 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbeta ] , we can see that the neutralino mass must fall within roughly 10% of @xmath39 if direct detection constraints are to be evaded . and while this is not yet a highly unacceptable degree of tuning , this requirement will become increasingly severe as the constraints placed by direct detection experiments become more stringent .    over the past decade",
    ", the sensitivities of direct detection experiments have collectively improved exponentially with time , strengthening their constraints on average by a factor of two every 15 months . for comparison , moore s law describing the rate of advancement in computational performance exhibits a similar but somewhat slower doubling time of approximately 18 months . in fig .",
    "[ limits ] we show the current and past constraints placed by a number of direct detection experiments ( from the cdms , edelweiss , xenon10 , and xenon100 collaborations ) as a function of time , for the case of a 100 gev wimp mass  @xcite .",
    "the dashed line represents the exponential progress that has taken place over the past 13 years .",
    "there are compelling reasons to anticipate this rate of progress to continue , at least for the next several years . in the near term",
    ", lux is anticipated to produce its first constraint by the end of 2013 , and to reach a sensitivity of a few @xmath40 pb after roughly a year of live time  @xcite . in the meantime , construction of xenon1 t is scheduled to begin later this year , with a projected reach of a few @xmath41 pb  @xcite .",
    "even with a reasonable allotment for unanticipated delays , the prospects for meeting or exceeding the historical rate of progress appear very encouraging .. ]    @xmath42 pb , where irreducible neutrino backgrounds are predicted to become important  @xcite . ]      +      in fig .",
    "[ tuning ] , we show how these projected improvements in direct detection sensitivity will impact the degree of fine tuning required for neutralinos in the @xmath15-funnel region of parameter space . with present constraints , @xmath8 must fall within 316% of the central resonant value , depending on the values of @xmath21 and @xmath43 . assuming the rate of progress shown in fig .",
    "[ limits ] ( and assuming that no detection is made ) , in only five years approximately 1 - 4% tuning will be required . in a little over a decade ,",
    "these experiments are anticipated to reach the sensitivity needed to test even the most highly tuned resonances , closing the entire @xmath15-funnel region of parameter space .",
    "the pseudoscalar higgs is not the only resonance through which neutralinos could efficiently annihilate . in this section",
    ", we will consider dark matter particles that annihilate through other resonances , including the light higgs and @xmath5 resonances of the mssm .      in the upper left frame of fig .",
    "[ fig : tanbeta ] , in addition to the @xmath15-funnel , one can see the effect of the light higgs resonance ( at @xmath44 ) . while for the value of @xmath8 shown , the presence of the light higgs resonance does not enable us to evade the constraints from xenon100 , if we increase @xmath8 to a high value we can reduce the prediction for the elastic scattering cross section while still allowing for efficient annihilations through the light higgs resonance  @xcite .    in fig .",
    "[ zh ] we focus on this possibility , along with that of neutralinos annihilating through the @xmath5 resonance . here , we have set @xmath8 to 5 tev , but otherwise follow the same procedure as described in sec .",
    "notice that while these resonances are sufficient to potentially evade current direct detection constraints , they do not extend to elastic scattering cross sections that are as small as those found in the @xmath15-funnel . based on the extrapolation shown in fig .  [ limits ] , we project that both the light higgs and @xmath5 resonance regions will be closed by direct detection experiments within the next approximately 7 years .     for several values of @xmath21 , in the regions of the light higgs and @xmath5 resonances .",
    "we have set @xmath45 , @xmath46 , @xmath8 and the sfermion masses to 5 tev and fixed @xmath22 and @xmath23 to obtain the measured dark matter density and higgs mass . ]",
    "many of the arguments and conclusions discussed in this article apply to a broad class of scenarios in which the dark matter annihilates through an efficient resonance , supersymmetric or otherwise . in this subsection , we briefly comment on the current and future viability of resonant scenarios that might be found outside of the context of the mssm .    for a general dark matter candidate that annihilates through a scalar resonance ( such as through a scalar higgs ) ,",
    "the arguments presented here for the case of the mssm remain valid , with conclusions that are essentially unchanged .",
    "other types of particles that might be exchanged on resonance , however , can in some cases evade these considerations .",
    "for example , in a model in which the dark matter annihilates through a pseudoscalar ( without the accompanying scalars found in the mssm ) , no low - velocity elastic scattering cross section is generated .",
    "similarly , if the dark matter is a majorana fermion , it could annihilate through a vector resonance without generating a corresponding spin - independent elastic scattering cross section ( although a spin - dependent interaction would be induced , the current constraints on spin - dependent scattering are much less stringent ) .",
    "the reason that the @xmath5 pole region of the mssm can be successfully probed by direct detection experiments ( see sec .",
    "[ zhsec ] ) is that a neutralino near the @xmath5 pole must have a significant bino component ( due to lep constraints on chargino masses ) and thus will couple significantly to the light higgs .",
    "a purely - higgsino neutralino near the @xmath5 pole that somehow was not accompanied by a corresponding light chargino could satisfy all direct detection constraints , although icecube would likely be able to rule out such a scenario  @xcite .",
    "more realistically , one could imagine a heavier vector resonance ( _ i.e. _  a @xmath47 ) though which a majorana dark matter candidate could annihilate without violating direct detection constraints .",
    "in this article , we have discussed the viability of resonant regions of the mssm , in which the lightest neutralino avoids being over produced in the early universe by annihilating through the @xmath6 , @xmath48 or @xmath5 resonance . at present",
    ", direct detection constraints can be respected if the neutralino s mass falls within about 16% of the central resonant value ( for some mass ranges and values of @xmath21 , the neutralino s mass is already constrained to fall even closer to the resonance , within as little as 3% in some cases ) .",
    "this degree of tuning is comparable to the mass splittings required in viable coannihilation regions of the mssm , and appears to be somewhat less severe than the degree of electroweak fine tuning required in currently viable regions of the mssm  @xcite .",
    "as direct dark matter detection experiments continue to increase in sensitivity , the degree to which the neutralino s mass will be required to fall near a resonance ( or near the mass of a coannihilating superparticle ) will increase .",
    "in particular , as such constraints become more stringent and requirements on the neutralino s couplings to higgs bosons become more severe , overproduction in the early universe will occur unless the neutralino s mass is very close to the optimal value of the resonance . assuming that direct detection experiments improve in sensitivity at a rate similar to that observed over the past decade",
    ", they will be able to entirely close the light higgs and @xmath5 resonance regions within the next approximately 7 years . at that time",
    ", the @xmath15-funnel region will remain viable , but will require that the neutralino mass ( or equivalently , @xmath8 ) resides within 4% of the central resonant value . at this rate of progress , direct detection experiments will reach the sensitivity required to close the @xmath15-funnel region of parameter space in approximately 12 years , even for optimal values of the masses .",
