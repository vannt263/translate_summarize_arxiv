    "in this paper we present the qualitative and quantitative analysis of the influence of imperfect structure of a crystalline undulator ( in particular , the influence of the variation of the bending amplitude over the crystal thickness due to the stress applied to its surface ) on the spectral distribution of the radiation .",
    "the parameters of crystalline undulators ( including the types and lengths of crystals , the periods of bending , the positron energies , and the range of photon energies ) as well as the methods of preparation of periodically bent structures discussed below in the paper correspond to those which are available for the experiments to be carried out within the pecu project@xcite .",
    "a periodically bent crystal together with a bunch of ultra - relativistic charged particles which undergo planar channeling constitute a crystalline undulator .",
    "in such a system there appears , in addition to the well - known channeling radiation , the undulator type radiation which is due to the periodic motion of channeling particles which follow the bending of the crystallographic planes@xcite .",
    "the intensity and characteristic frequencies of this radiation can be varied by changing the beam energy and the parameters of bending . in the cited papers as well as in the subsequent publications ( see the review ref .",
    "@xcite and the references therein ) a feasibility was proven to create a short - wave crystalline undulator that will emit intensive monochromatic radiation when a pulse of ultra - relativistic positrons is passed through its channels .",
    "more recently , it was demonstrated @xcite that the undulator based on the electron channeling is also feasible .",
    "a number of corresponding novel numerical results were presented to illustrate the developed theory , including , in particular , the calculation of the spectral and angular characteristics of the new type of radiation .",
    "although the operational principle of a crystalline undulator does not depend on the type of a projectile below in this paper we will consider the case of a positron channeling . under certain conditions",
    "@xcite , an ultra - relativistic positron , which enters the crystal at the angle smaller than the lindhard critical angle @xcite , will penetrate through the crystal following the bendings of its planes .",
    "provided the bending amplitude @xmath0 greatly exceeds the interplanar distance @xmath1 ( see figure [ figure.1 ] left ) one can disregard the oscillations due to the action of the interplanar force ,  the channeling oscillations@xcite . in this case",
    "the trajectory of the particle can be associated with the periodic profile of channel centerline .",
    "the undulator radiation appears as a result of this periodic motion of the particle .",
    "thus , the operational principle of a crystalline undulator is the same as for a conventional one@xcite , in which the monochromaticity of the radiation is the result of a constructive interference of the photons emitted from similar parts of trajectory .",
    "usually , when discussing the properties of a crystalline undulator and of its radiation , one considers the case of _ a perfect _ crystalline undulator . by this term",
    "we will understand the crystal whose planes are bent periodically following a perfect harmonic shape , @xmath2 , see figure [ figure.1 ] ( left ) . for clarity , let us stress that we consider the case when the quantities @xmath1 , @xmath0 and @xmath3 satisfy the double inequality @xmath4 .",
    "typically , @xmath5  , @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the spectral - angular distribution from the perfect undulator is characterized by a specific pattern which implies that for each value of the emission angle the spectrum consists of a set of narrow , well - separated and powerful peaks corresponding to different harmonics of radiation . in principle , the perfect crystalline undulators can be produced by using the technologies of growing si@xmath8ge@xmath9 structures @xcite . in this case , by varying the ge content @xmath10 one can obtain periodically bent crystalline structure @xcite .",
    "the technological restrictions imposed by this method on the crystalline undulator length is @xmath11 m .",
    "the periodic bending can also be achieved by making regularly spaced grooves on the crystal surface either by using a diamond blade @xcite or by means of laser - ablation .",
    "the latter method was used @xcite to prepare the si - based crystalline undulators for the pecu experiments . in either case , the regular surface deformation results in the periodic pattern of the crystallographic planes bending in the bulk .",
    "the question which appears in connection with these methods of preparation concerns the quality of the periodically bending .",
    "indeed , for a crystal of a finite thickness it is natural to expect that the surface deformations , regularly spaced with the period @xmath3 , result in the volume deformations of the same period but of a varied amplitude of bending , @xmath12 ( see figure [ figure.1 ] ( right ) ) .",
    "the latter has maximum value in the surface layer but decreases with the penetration distance .",
    "therefore , it is important to carry out a quantitative analysis ( a ) of the structure of this _ imperfect _ periodic bending in the bulk , and ( b ) of its influence on the spectrum of undulator radiation . both of these problems constitute the subject of the present paper .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ de ]",
    "we briefly outline the basic formulae and definitions which refer to a perfect crystalline undulator .",
    "section [ averaging ] describes , in general terms , the modifications to be introduced to the formalism due to the imperfectness of the crystalline undulator . in section [ formalism ]",
    "we present the formalism and carry out numerical analysis of the periodic deformations in the bulk caused by a regular stress applied to the crystal surface .",
    "finally , in section [ averagedspectra ] we carry out quantitative analysis of the differences in the emission spectra formed in a perfect undulator and in the undulator created by means of periodic surface deformations .",
    "the spectral distribution of the energy @xmath13 of radiation emitted by an ultra - relativistic ( @xmath14 ) positron in a perfect crystalline undulator can be written in the following form @xcite : @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the emission angles with respect to the undulator axis chosen along @xmath18 , @xmath19 is the emission solid angle .",
    "the factor @xmath20 is explained further in this section .",
    "the function @xmath21 is given by @xmath22 \\biggr ) , \\quad m=0,1\\ , .",
    "\\label{de.3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath23 is the fine structure constant , @xmath24 is the relativistic lorentz factor with @xmath25 standing for the positron mass and @xmath26 for its energy , @xmath27 and @xmath28 is the undulator parameter , @xmath29 the parameter @xmath30 is defined as follows @xmath31 a peculiar feature of the undulator radiation is that for each value of the emission angle @xmath32 the spectral distribution consists of a set of narrow and equally spaced peaks ( harmonics ) the frequencies @xmath33 one defines letting @xmath34 : @xmath35 the widths @xmath36 of the peaks satisfy the inequality @xmath37 , so that all peaks are well separated .    in an ideal undulator ( i.e. , in which positrons and photons propagate in vacuum ) the peak intensity is proportional to the squared number of periods .",
    "formally , it follows from the fact that @xmath38 is proportional to @xmath39 which behaves as @xmath40 for integer @xmath30 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this factor reflects the constructive interference of radiation emitted from each of the undulator periods .",
    "consequently , in an ideal undulator one can increase unrestrictedly the radiated intensity by increasing of the undulator length @xmath41 .",
    "the situation is different for a crystalline undulator , where the number of channeling particles and the number of photons which can emerge from the crystal decrease with the growth of @xmath42 . in refs .",
    "@xcite the quantitative study of the influence of the dechanneling and the photon attenuation on the spectral - angular distribution was presented .",
    "the main result of this analysis is that the peak intensity is no longer proportional to @xmath40 .",
    "it was shown , that in a crystalline undulator the factor @xmath43 must be substituted with @xmath20 , which depends not only on @xmath44 and @xmath30 but also on the ratios @xmath45 and @xmath46 . here",
    "@xmath47 stands for the dechanneling length which is the mean penetration distance covered by a channeling particle .",
    "the quantity @xmath48 , called the attenuation length , defines the scale within which the intensity of a photon flux propagating through a crystal decreases by a factor of @xmath49 due to the processes of absorption and scattering . a convenient formula for @xmath20 , which enters the right - hand side of ( [ de.1 ] ) , is as follows @xcite : @xmath50\\ , , \\label{de.5 } \\ ] ] where @xmath51 ( with @xmath52 being the closest positive integer to @xmath30 ) .    despite a cumbersome form of the right - hand side of ( [ de.5 ] )",
    "its main features can be easily understood .",
    "the most important is that , as in the case of an ideal undulator ( to which @xmath20 reduces in the limit @xmath53 ) the main maxima of @xmath20 correspond to @xmath30 integers , and , therefore , the harmonic frequencies are still defined by ( [ de.4 ] ) with @xmath54 . for finite @xmath47 and @xmath48 , the maximum value of @xmath20 is smaller than @xmath40 whereas the width of the peak is larger than that in the corresponding ideal undulator .",
    "the attenuation length depends on the photon energy , @xmath55 , and can be calculated as the inverse mass attenuation coefficient which are tabulated for all elements and for a wide range of photon frequencies @xcite .",
    "the dechanneling effect stands for a gradual increase in the transverse energy of a channeled particle due to inelastic collisions with the crystal constituents @xcite . at some point",
    "the particle gains a transverse energy higher than the planar potential barrier and leaves the channel . in a straight crystal dechanneling length @xmath47 of a positron",
    "depends on the crystal and on the energy of the projectile . in a bent crystal the potential barrier changes due to the centrifugal force , and , as a result , @xmath47 becomes dependent on the curvature of the channel .",
    "a stable channeling of a projectile in a periodically bent channel occurs if the maximal centrifugal force in the channel @xmath56 is less than the maximal interplanar force @xmath57 , i.e. @xmath58 . for an ultra - relativistic particle @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the minimum curvature radius of the bent channel . in a perfect crystalline undulator @xmath61 ,",
    "therefore , the condition for a stable channeling reads @xcite : @xmath62 using the diffusion model @xcite one can be demonstrated that dechanneling length in a periodically bent crystal becomes dependent on the parameter @xmath63 . in the case of ultra - relativistic positrons",
    "the expression for @xmath64 can be written as follows @xcite : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is the dechanneling length a straight channel .",
    "this quantity can be estimated as @xmath67 @xcite , where @xmath68 and @xmath69 are the classical radius of the electron and the thomas - fermi radius of the crystal atom , and @xmath70 ( @xmath71 stands for an average ionization potential of the atom ) .",
    "apart from the dechanneling length , the bending parameter @xmath63 also defines another important quantity , _ the acceptance _ of the crystal .",
    "the acceptance represents by itself the fraction of the particles trapped in the channeling mode ( or , in other words , it is equal to the ratio of the phase volume corresponding to the channeling regime to the phase volume of the beam particles at the entrance of the crystal ) . in comparison with a linear crystal , the acceptance of the bent crystal gains additional decrease due to the presence of the centrifugal force in the channels @xcite . generalizing the result of ref .",
    "@xcite , one writes the following expression for the acceptance @xmath72 of the periodically bent channel and for the case of a parallel beam : @xmath73 where @xmath74 is the acceptance of the linear crystal and @xmath75 . if the centrifugal force exceeds the interplanar force ( i.e. , @xmath76 ) then one uses the identity @xmath77 , which means that the channel does capture the particles .    in connection with the radiation from a crystalline undulator , the acceptance comes into play when one calculates the energy emitted per particle of the bunch . to obtain this quantity in a perfect undulator ,",
    "one multiplies the right - hand side of ( [ de.1 ] ) by the acceptance @xmath72 .",
    "the formulae ( [ de.1])-([de.8 ] ) allow one to carry out numerical analysis of the spectral - angular distribution formed in a perfect crystalline undulator .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite the results of such analysis were reported for 0.6 and 10 gev positrons channeling through periodically bent si and si@xmath8ge@xmath9 crystals .",
    "in this section we analyze the modifications in the formalism of spectral - angular distribution of the radiation from a crystalline undulator which appear due to the imperfectness of periodic bending of the crystallographic planes .    for the sake of clarity",
    "let us discuss the geometrical conventions which will be used below .",
    "figures [ figure.1 ] and [ figure.2 ] help a reader to follow the text .",
    "we assume that the crystal has the form of a rectangular box .",
    "its length , @xmath42 , width , @xmath78 , and thickness , @xmath79 , are measured along the @xmath18 , @xmath10 and @xmath80 directions , respectively .",
    "we chose the frame in which the values @xmath81 denote the @xmath80-coordinates of the upper and lower surfaces of the crystal .",
    "hence , it is assumed that @xmath82 labels the central @xmath83-plane of the crystal ( the midplane ) .",
    "initially non - deformed crystallographic planes are perpendicular to the @xmath80 axis .",
    "we assume that periodic deformation of the crystalline structure occurs only in the @xmath84-plane , so that there is no deformation in the @xmath10-direction . in the deformed crystal",
    "the bunch of channeling particles propagates in the @xmath84-plane along @xmath18 direction .",
    "with @xmath85 we denote the bunch size along the @xmath80 direction .",
    "the width of the bunch ( i.e. , its size in @xmath10 ) is not used in our model .",
    "suppose that bending amplitude is not constant over the crystal thickness but changes according to a law @xmath12 , as illustrated by figure [ figure.1 ] .",
    "the particular form of this dependence is discussed in section [ formalism ] where we analyze the deformation of the crystal interior due to the periodic stress applied to its surfaces . at the moment ,",
    "the only restrictions implied on the dependence @xmath86 are : ( a ) the change in amplitude on the scale of interplanar spacing @xmath1 is negligible ; ( b ) a strong inequality @xmath87 is valid for all @xmath80",
    ".    particles in the bunch are randomly distributed along the @xmath80-axis .",
    "therefore , we may assume that at the entrance a particle can be captured in any channel located within the interval @xmath88 $ ] , where @xmath89 stands for the smallest from @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "being captured in the channel at some @xmath80 point , the particle undulates and emits the radiation corresponding to the undulator with the amplitude @xmath86 . for a fixed value of the period @xmath3 ,",
    "the amplitude defines two important quantities which are the undulator parameter @xmath28 and the bending parameter @xmath63 .",
    "the latter , in turn , defines the dechanneling length and the acceptance ( see eqs .",
    "( [ de.7 ] ) and ( [ de.8 ] ) ) .",
    "the influence of @xmath28 and @xmath47 on the spectral - angular distribution of radiation is discussed in detail further in this section . here",
    "we note that the acceptance @xmath72 determines the probability of a particle to be captured in the channeling more .",
    "if @xmath92 , this probability depends on the entrance coordinate @xmath80 . therefore , to obtain the distribution ( per particle ) of radiation formed in the crystal with varied amplitude of bending one should ( a ) multiply eq .",
    "( [ de.1 ] ) by the acceptance ( [ de.8 ] ) , and ( b ) carry out the averaging over the interval @xmath88 $ ] .",
    "this leads to the formula : @xmath93 here @xmath94 stands for the the distribution ( [ de.1 ] ) obtained for the amplitude @xmath86 .",
    "the right - hand side of this equation represents the spectral - angular distribution per particle averaged over the width of the crystal ( or of the bunch if @xmath95 ) , otherwise @xmath77 , see eq .",
    "( [ de.8 ] ) . ] .",
    "if the amplitude does not change within the interval of integration , the formula ( [ averaging.1 ] ) reduces to eq .",
    "( [ de.1 ] ) multiplied by the acceptance corresponding to the fixed @xmath63-value .",
    "let us discuss in more detail the influence of the dependence @xmath86 on the characteristics of the crystalline undulator radiation .",
    "it is clear that for the @xmath80-varying amplitude the terms , dependent on @xmath28 in the function @xmath21 ( see ( [ de.2 ] ) ) , change with @xmath80 since @xmath96 ( see ( [ no.3 ] ) ) . apart from this influence",
    ", the proportionality can lead to the variation of the harmonics frequencies @xmath33 and , consequently , to the loss of the monochromaticity of the radiation . indeed , let @xmath97 and @xmath98 denote the minimum and maximum amplitudes within the interval @xmath99 $ ] .",
    "the corresponding extremum values of the undulator parameter , @xmath100 and @xmath101 , having been used in ( [ de.4a ] ) , produce the lower , @xmath102 , and the upper , @xmath103 , bounds on @xmath33 . in the limit @xmath104",
    "there is a weak variation of the harmonics frequencies , @xmath105 .",
    "however , in the case @xmath106 the change in the undulator parameter leads to the emission within the band @xmath107 which can greatly exceed not only the peak width @xmath36 but also the interval between the neighbouring harmonics . in the latter case the monochromaticity of the radiation",
    "will be smeared out if one carries out the averaging procedure ( [ averaging.1 ] ) .",
    "however , the change in the undulator parameter and the harmonics frequencies is not the only impact caused by the amplitude variation . as mentioned above , in a crystalline undulator the peak intensity is defined by the maximum value of the factor @xmath20 , which depends on the ratios @xmath108 and @xmath109 ( see ( [ de.5 ] ) ) .",
    "typically , in the crystalline undulators based on @xmath110 gev positrons channeling in crystals ( so far si monocrystals and si - ge mixtures were used @xcite ) the energy of emitted photons lies within the range @xmath111 kev . for these energies of positrons and photons",
    "the attenuation length @xmath112 is on the level of several cm @xcite and by far exceeds the positron dechanneling lengths ( lying within @xmath113 cm in straight channels @xcite ) .",
    "therefore , assuming @xmath114 in ( [ de.5 ] ) , one finds that the peak value of the factor @xmath20 ( i.e. , at @xmath54 ) in an undulator with fixed number of periods , @xmath115 , is given by @xmath116 the dechanneling length in a channel , which is periodically bent with the amplitude @xmath0 , is defined by equations ( [ de.6 ] ) and ( [ de.7 ] ) .",
    "hence , for @xmath12 the right - hand side of ( [ averaging.2 ] ) ( and , generally , of ( [ de.5 ] ) as well ) becomes dependent on @xmath80 since @xmath117 with @xmath118 . in turn , the variation of the factor @xmath20 can strongly influence the averaged spectral - angular distribution ( [ averaging.1 ] ) .",
    "in this section we present a formalism which allows one to carry out a quantitative analysis of the parameters of periodic bending in the bulk of a crystal .",
    "we consider the case when the bendings in the bulk are due to the periodic deformations on the crystal surfaces .",
    "such a situation is illustrated by figure [ figure.2 ] : two parallel opposite surfaces are deformed periodically by means of identical sets of parallel grooves applied to each of the surfaces ( the two sets are shifted by half - period , @xmath119 ) .    the deformation of this type can be achieved either by mechanical scratching of the crystal surface @xcite or by means of a more accurate laser - ablation method @xcite .",
    "another possible method is in a deposition of si@xmath120n@xmath121 layers onto a si wafer @xcite .    in either case",
    "the crystallographic planes in the bulk become bent periodically although the shape @xmath122 of bent planes does not follow an ideal harmonic form @xmath123 .",
    "the main deviations are : ( a ) the amplitude of bending depends on the distance from the surface , and ( b ) in general case , higher subharmonics ( i.e. the fourier components of @xmath124 with smaller periods , @xmath125 , where @xmath126 ) contribute noticeably into the formation of the periodic shape .    however , as we demonstrate below , it is possible to establish the ranges of parameters ( these include @xmath3 , the thickness @xmath79 and elastic constants of the crystal ) within which the deviations of the resulting periodic shape from the ideal form do not affect the spectral - angular distribution of the undulator radiation .",
    "direction ) : @xmath3 stands for the period of deformations and @xmath127 denote the width of a groove .",
    "the set on the lower surface is shifted by @xmath119 ( along the @xmath18-axis ) with respect to that on the upper surface .",
    "the surface stress gives rise to the periodic bending of crystallographic planes in the bulk of crystal .",
    ", width=491,height=188 ]      to start with , let us formulate the approximations which will be used in our formalism .",
    "firstly , we assume that the width of a crystal @xmath78 ( i.e. its size in the @xmath10-direction , see figure [ figure.2 ] ) is much larger than the thickness @xmath79 : @xmath128 . as a result",
    ", one can disregard the deformations in the @xmath10-direction and consider the deformations of a solid body in the @xmath84-plane only .",
    "additionally , we assume that the period @xmath3 is incomparably smaller than the length @xmath42 of the crystal in the @xmath18 direction . then , taking into account the periodicity of the surface deformations , one represents the displacement vector @xmath129 ( i.e. the vector which characterizes the change in the position vector of a point in the body due to the deformation ) in the form of fourier series : @xmath130 where @xmath131 . the vectors @xmath132 ( with @xmath133 standing for an integer ) are to be defined by solving the equation of equilibrium with proper boundary conditions . in what follows",
    "we adopt that the @xmath80 coordinate is measured from the crystal midline , and thus @xmath134 corresponds to the lower surface , and @xmath135 - to the upper one .",
    "secondly , we will consider the limit of small deformations only . in this case",
    "the _ strain tensor _",
    "@xmath136 is defined as follows ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) : @xmath137 with @xmath138 and @xmath139 .",
    "the third approximation concerns the _ stress tensor _",
    ", @xmath140 ( we remind , that physically @xmath140 stands for a stress on the @xmath141-th plane along the @xmath142-th direction ) . in an isotropic media the components of the stress tensor can be related to @xmath136 by means of the two elastic constants : the young s modulus @xmath13 and the poisson s ratio @xmath143 . in the case of a planar deformation",
    "the relationship is as follows ( see , e.g. ,  5 in @xcite ) : @xmath144 ,   \\\\",
    "\\sigma_{zz } = { e \\over ( 1+\\nu)(1 - 2 \\nu ) }   \\bigl[(1-\\nu ) u_{zz } + \\nu u_{yy}\\bigr ] ,    \\\\",
    "\\sigma_{yz }   =   \\sigma_{zy }   =   { e \\over ( 1+\\nu ) } u_{yz}. } \\label{formalism1.3 } \\ ] ] in anisotropic media ( e.g. , in a crystal ) @xmath13 and @xmath143 depend on the directions of the applied stress and of the deformation .",
    "for example , depending on a crystallographic direction the poisson s ratio and the young s modulus in a si crystal varies within the intervals @xmath145 and @xmath146 gpa @xcite . however , to simplify the analysis one can chose some average values . in our numerical analysis",
    "we use @xmath147 and @xmath148 gpa which are close to the values used in modeling various deformation processes in silicon @xcite . to check the sensitivity of the results to the choice of the poisson s ratio we also carried out the calculations using the extreme values of @xmath143 in silicon .",
    "it turned out that nearly an order of magnitude change in @xmath143 does not noticeably affect the results which are presented below in the paper .",
    "the components of the stress tensor satisfy the following equations of equilibrium : @xmath149 using ( [ formalism1.1])([formalism1.3 ] ) in ( [ formalism1.4 ] ) one derives the system of coupled equations for the functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 : @xmath152 to find the unique solution of this system one has to impose the boundary conditions .",
    "these can be formulated as follows .",
    "each trench acts as a source of a normal ( ` @xmath153 ' ) and a tangential , or a shear ( @xmath154 ) tension which are characterized by the average pressures @xmath155 and @xmath156 applied to the crystal surface in vicinity of the trench . in the case when the period @xmath3 the width @xmath127 ( see figure [ figure.2 ] ) , the trenches are equivalent to the sets of concentrated normal and shear forces applied along the equally spaced lines on the upper and lower surfaces . is well fulfilled in the crystalline undulators which have been manufactured .",
    "typical values are : @xmath157 @xmath158 m and @xmath159 @xmath158 m @xcite . ] within this model the pressures @xmath155 and @xmath156 can be related to the components of the stress tensor calculated at the upper ( @xmath135 ) and the lower ( @xmath134 ) surfaces .",
    "let us first formulate the boundary conditions due to the normal tension .",
    "the pressure @xmath155 is applied inward the crystal along straight lines , parallel to the @xmath10 axis , passing through the equally - spaced points in the @xmath18 direction .",
    "therefore , recalling that @xmath160 represents the @xmath141-th component of the force per unit area ( with @xmath161 standing for the @xmath142-th component of the outward - pointing normal ) one derives the boundary conditions : @xmath162 here the coefficient @xmath3 ensures that the period - averaged pressure , equals to @xmath155 .",
    "the arguments of the delta functions fix the @xmath18 coordinates of the lines parallel to the @xmath80 axis . as mentioned , the sets of trenches on the upper and lower surfaces are shifted by @xmath119 , and this explains the difference of the arguments of the delta functions for @xmath135 and @xmath134 .    in the case of shear stress , supposing that the trench profile is symmetric , one notices that the tangential forces created at the opposite edges of a trench are equal in magnitude but are antiparallel . therefore , the component @xmath163 as a function of @xmath18 must change the sign when crossing a trench .",
    "it means that in the limit of infinitesimal width @xmath164 this component becomes proportional not to the delta functions as in ( [ formalism1.6 ] ) but to their derivatives . as a result ,",
    "one writes the boundary conditions in the form : @xmath165 where @xmath166 stands for the tangential force associated with the period - averaged pressure @xmath156 .    with the help of ( [ formalism1.1])([formalism1.3 ] )",
    "the equations ( [ formalism1.6 ] ) and ( [ formalism1.7 ] ) can be re - written in terms of the functions @xmath150 and @xmath151 taken at @xmath167 .",
    "the obtained formulae suffice to determine completely the solutions @xmath168 ( @xmath169 ) for the normal or the shear stress . to obtain the solution in the case when both types of stress act",
    "simultaneously one constructs the corresponding linear combinations of the functions @xmath170 and @xmath171 .    using these functions",
    "further in ( [ formalism1.1 ] ) one determines the displacement vector @xmath172 .",
    "the @xmath80 component of this vector is of a special interest in connection of the crystalline undulator problem since it determines the profile of the periodically bent channel in the bulk .",
    "let us first analyze the periodic deformation in the bulk due to the normal and the shear stresses separately .    resolving the system ( [ formalism1.5 ] ) with the boundary conditions ( [ formalism1.6 ] ) ( or ( [ formalism1.7 ] ) ) one finds the functions @xmath174 ( or @xmath175 ) for all @xmath133 . using these in ( [ formalism1.1 ] )",
    "one represents the @xmath80-component of the displacement vector in the following form : @xmath176 here @xmath177 can be associated with the amplitude of the @xmath133th harmonic of teh periodic bending , i.e. , the one with the period @xmath125 .",
    "a perfect crystalline undulator ( see figure [ figure.1 ] , left panel ) is characterized only by the term @xmath178 whose amplitude is independent on @xmath179 $ ] . however ,",
    "if a crystalline undulator is prepared by applying concentrated periodic normal or shear stress then : ( a ) higher amplitude harmonics ( with @xmath180 ) appear , and ( b ) the homogeneity of the bending amplitudes is lost since they become @xmath80-dependent .",
    "to stress these features of the amplitudes one can use the formulae which conveniently expresses @xmath177 via @xmath181 - the first harmonic amplitudes is the midplane of the crystal ( i.e. in the @xmath182-plane with @xmath82 ) .    in the case of normal stress alone",
    "the formula is as follows : @xmath183 for a shear stress the relationship reads : @xmath184    in ( [ formalism2.2 ] ) and ( [ formalism2.3 ] ) the following notations are used : @xmath185 and @xmath186 the amplitudes @xmath181 are proportional to the applied stresses and are given by : @xmath187 where @xmath188 let us note that due to the half - period relative displacement of the deformations on the upper and lower surfaces of the crystal the amplitudes @xmath177 with odd values of @xmath133 are even functions of @xmath80 and vice versa ( see ( [ formalism2.2 ] ) and ( [ formalism2.3 ] ) ) .",
    "therefore , it is sufficient to analyze the amplitudes in the upper half of the crystal , i.e. for @xmath189 $ ] .",
    "the behaviour of the ratios @xmath192 and @xmath193 as functions of the scaled distance @xmath194 from the midplane is illustrated by figures [ figure.any2a10_perp ] and [ figure.any2a10_par ] .",
    "the dependences were calculated for several values of the crystal thickness @xmath79 ( measured in the periods @xmath3 as specified by the ratio @xmath195 ) and several even and odd values of @xmath133 .",
    "the data refer to a si crystal and the poisson s ratio was chosen as @xmath147 .",
    "( see ( [ formalism2.2 ] ) and ( [ formalism2.8 ] ) ) versus @xmath194 ( for @xmath196 $ ] ) calculated for several values of the si crystal thickness as indicated by the parameter @xmath195 .",
    "the solid curves correspond to @xmath133 odd ( which are indicated explicitly in the top left graph ) , the dashed curves - to @xmath133 even ( see the bottom left graph ) . ]",
    "but for the ratio @xmath193 ( see ( [ formalism2.3 ] ) and ( [ formalism2.8 ] ) ) . ]    it is clearly seen from the figures that for either type of stress the inhomogeneity of the bending amplitudes along the @xmath80 direction is much more pronounced for a thick crystal ( i.e. , when @xmath197 ) than for a thin one with @xmath198 .",
    "indeed , in the limit @xmath199 the amplitudes corresponding to odd values of @xmath200 do not vary noticeably over the crystal thickness .",
    "being even functions of @xmath80 , the odd-@xmath133 amplitudes @xmath177 depend quadratically on @xmath80 in the vicinity of the midplane , @xmath201 , and have minimum at @xmath82 . in a thin crystal",
    "the quadratic term is small for all @xmath80 provided @xmath133 satisfies the condition written above . as a result , @xmath202 for these @xmath133 .",
    "the main reason for the even-@xmath133 amplitudes to vary even in the case of a thin crystal is that they are odd functions of @xmath80 .",
    "therefore , being non - zero at the surfaces @xmath167 these amplitudes attain zero in the midplane .",
    "( a non - monotonous behaviour of @xmath191 for particular @xmath133 and @xmath195 , which is most pronounced for the @xmath203 curves on the top left graph of figure [ figure.any2a10_par ] , just reflects the fact that the right - hand side of ( [ formalism2.3 ] ) is not , generally , a monotonous function of @xmath80 . )",
    "another important feature of a thin crystal is that over the whole thickness the amplitude with @xmath178 greatly exceeds those with higher @xmath133 .",
    "this dominance is more pronounced for a normal stress than for a shear one as reflected by additional factor @xmath204 on the right - hand side of ( [ formalism2.2 ] ) . as a result ,",
    "the terms with @xmath205 prevail in the series from ( [ formalism1.1 ] ) , so that the periodic bending in a thin crystal is of nearly harmonic shape : @xmath206 .",
    "as the crystal thickness increases the variation of the amplitudes over half - width evolves dramatically . in the case of a thick crystal",
    "this variation reaches orders of magnitudes .",
    "such a behaviour one understands analyzing the right - hand sides of ( [ formalism2.2 ] ) and ( [ formalism2.3 ] ) . assuming @xmath207 one derives the following expressions for the amplitudes on the surface and in the midplane : @xmath208 where @xmath209 in the case of a normal stress and @xmath210 for a shear stress .",
    "for even @xmath133 the identity @xmath211 is valid .",
    "equations from ( [ formalism3.1 ] ) demonstrate that for all @xmath133 the amplitudes decrease exponentially with the penetration distance into the crystal .",
    "for a fixed odd @xmath133 the decrease rate can be characterized by the ratio @xmath212 , which is , basically , independent on the type of applied stress ( the difference manifests itself only in the pre - factor @xmath213 ) . on the other hand",
    ", the first line in ( [ formalism3.1 ] ) indicates that in the limit of a very thick crystal the amplitudes weakly depend on @xmath133 in a surface layer of the width @xmath214 ( this dependence is more pronounced in the case of a normal stress due to the additional factor @xmath133 ) .",
    "these two features of the amplitude suggest that deviation of the periodic bending from the harmonic shape is very strong in the outer layers of the crystal whereas in the central layer the terms with @xmath180 are negligibly small and the profile of bending @xmath215 is nearly perfect .",
    "the deviation of the amplitudes @xmath216 from their values at @xmath82 is described by the following formulae : @xmath217    to conclude this section we note that figures [ figure.any2a10_perp ] and [ figure.any2a10_par ] suggest that the use of crystalline undulators manufactured by means of periodic surface deformation can be justified in two cases ( irrelevantly to the type of the stress applied to crystal ) .",
    "firstly , it is the limit of a thin crystal @xmath198 which ensures ( a ) the ( nearly ) constant value of the amplitude @xmath218 , and , ( b ) a small contribution of higher-@xmath133 terms to sum on the right - hand side of ( [ formalism2.1 ] ) .",
    "secondly , for @xmath219 it is meaningful to use only the central part of the crystal , i.e. , where @xmath220 , as an undulator . in this case",
    "it is necessary to use a narrow beam ( along the @xmath80-direction ) which is accurately aligned with the crystal midplane .      equation ( [ formalism2.1 ] ) shows that in general case the profile of bending contains contributions of the terms with various @xmath133 thus deviating from a pure harmonic shape @xmath221 .",
    "hence , it is meaningful to analyze the influence of this deviation on the undulator parameter @xmath28 and the bending parameter @xmath63 which , as it was discussed at the end of section [ averaging ] , are of importance for the calculation of the averaged spectral - angular distribution ( [ averaging.1 ] ) of radiation .      generally , the parameter @xmath28 characterizes the mean - square velocity , @xmath222 , of the periodic transverse motion of a particle moving in an undulator ( e.g. , @xcite ) . for an ultra - relativistic projectile",
    "the relationship is as follows : @xmath223 . in a perfect undulator",
    "this formula leads to equation ( [ no.3 ] ) . in the imperfect undulator discussed here ,",
    "a particle moves along the trajectory defined by the right - hand side of ( [ formalism2.1 ] ) with @xmath224 . calculating the transverse velocity @xmath225 and averaging over the period @xmath226 ,",
    "one derives the expression for the undulator parameter as a function of @xmath80 : @xmath227 where @xmath228 stands for the partial undulator parameters corresponding to the @xmath133-th subharmonics of the trajectory .",
    "in figure [ figure.py ] we present the dependences of the ratio @xmath229 on @xmath194 calculated for several values of the crystal thickness and for the two types of stress , as indicated in the caption .",
    "as it was discussed in section [ averaging ] the dependence of the undulator parameter on @xmath80 leads to a variation in the harmonic frequencies @xmath33 ( [ de.4a ] ) over the crystal thickness .",
    "if this variation becomes large enough ( e.g. , when the shift in the harmonic position becomes comparable with the separation @xmath230 of the neighbouring harmonics ) then the spectral - angular distribution will loose the peak - like pattern typical for the undulator radiation . from this viewpoint the graphs from figure [ figure.py ] allow one to estimate the influence of the change in the undulator parameter across the crystal cross section on the shape of spectral - angular distribution .    for both types of stress the dependences @xmath231 exhibit the common trend :",
    "the undulator parameter slowly varies with @xmath80 in the limit of a thin crystal but becomes a rapidly ( exponentially ) increasing function for a thick crystal .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the definition ( [ formalism4.1 ] ) and the behaviour of the amplitudes @xmath177 ( see figures [ figure.any2a10_perp ] and [ figure.any2a10_par ] ) .",
    "another peculiarity , which one notices comparing the two panels in figure [ figure.py ] , is that for the same value of @xmath195 the ratio @xmath232 grows faster than @xmath233 .",
    "such a feature , which is more pronounced for higher @xmath195 values , can be understood if one recalls the differences in the @xmath133-dependences of the bending amplitudes in the case of normal and shear stresses , and the behaviour of @xmath234 as functions of @xmath80 . indeed , for moderate and large @xmath195 ratios and for both types of the stress , the amplitudes @xmath234 with @xmath180 , being rapidly increasing functions , satisfy the relations @xmath235 and @xmath236 ( see ( [ formalism3.1 ] ) ) .",
    "hence , for @xmath82 the sum on the right - hand side of ( [ formalism4.1 ] ) is defined , basically , by the term with @xmath178 , whereas for larger @xmath80 also the terms with higher @xmath133 contribute noticeably to the sum .",
    "on the other hand , it follows from ( [ formalism2.2 ] ) and ( [ formalism2.3 ] ) that @xmath237 , resulting in a similar estimate for the ratio of the partial undulator parameters : @xmath238 .",
    "therefore , in the case of the shear stress the undulator parameter varies with @xmath80 more rapidly than for the normal stress .    typically , in crystalline undulators prepared by means of surface deformation and based on @xmath110 gev positron channeling @xcite ) , the values of parameter @xmath28 lie within the range @xmath239 .",
    "the curves in figure [ figure.py ] allow us to estimate the degree of consistency of using the undulators with various @xmath240 and @xmath195 values .",
    "it was pointed out in section [ averaging ] , that there will be no dramatic change in the spectral - angular distribution of the radiation due to the imperfectness of the undulator provided the variation of the undulator parameter does not lead to a noticeable change in the position of the peaks located at the frequencies @xmath33 ( see ( [ de.4a ] ) ) . to analyze this condition",
    "let us consider , for the sake of clarity , emission in the forward direction ( @xmath241 ) . in this case the frequency of the @xmath142-th harmonics , radiated from the the channel located at the distance @xmath80 from the midplane , is given by @xmath242",
    "it is clear that in the limit @xmath243 the position of the peak will be practically unchanged for those @xmath80 where @xmath244 .",
    "these two inequalities , depending on the absolute value of @xmath245 , allow for a wide - range variation of the ratio @xmath229 , up to the order of magnitude .",
    "it follows from figure [ figure.py ] that for a thin crystal such a situation can be realizes over the full thickness @xmath79 . in a thick crystal ( @xmath219 )",
    "only the central part ensures the needed variation of the undulator parameter .    in the opposite limit of large undulator parameters , when @xmath246 , the stability of the peak position can be achieved only in that part of the crystal where @xmath247 .",
    "taking into account rapid variation of the ratio @xmath229 in the case of a thick crystal , one deduces that this inequality can be ensured only by using very thin crystals with @xmath248 .",
    "the channeling process in a bent crystal takes place if the centrifugal force , @xmath249 , due to the channel bending is less than the interplanar force @xmath57 @xcite . in a perfect crystalline undulator",
    "this condition , applied to the points of maximum curvature , results in the inequality ( [ de.6 ] ) which relates @xmath57 with the period and the amplitude of periodic bending @xcite . in the case when the profile of periodic bending contains a number of subharmonics , e.g. , as in ( [ formalism2.1 ] ) , is it more constructive to relate the parameter @xmath63 to the mean - square curvature @xmath250 where the averaging is carried out over the period @xmath3 .",
    "recalling that the curvature @xmath251 is proportional to the modulus of the second derivative of the bending profile , @xmath252 , and carrying out the averaging , one derives the following expression for average bending parameter as a function of @xmath80 : @xmath253 where @xmath254 is the mean - square partial bending parameter corresponding to the @xmath133-th subharmonics of the trajectory ( [ formalism2.1 ] ) .",

    "nevertheless , there is a quantitative difference : for a fixed value of @xmath195 the curves @xmath257 increase faster with @xmath80 than the corresponding ratio of the undulator parameters .",
    "this feature is due to the difference in the @xmath133-dependence of the partial terms in ( [ formalism2.1 ] ) and in ( [ formalism2.2 ] ) .",

    "a crystalline undulator can operate only in the regime when @xmath261 .",
    "if otherwise , then the centrifugal force will drive the particles out of the channel .",

    "we demonstrated that this method inevitably leads to two main deviations from the perfect harmonic shape @xmath319 .",
    "thsese are : ( a ) the dependence of the bending amplitude on the distance @xmath80 from crystal midplane , and ( b ) the presence of subharmonics with smaller bending periods . as a result",
    ", the quantities which characterize the crystalline undulator ,  the undulator parameter @xmath28 and the bending parameter @xmath63 , vary over the crystal thickness @xmath79 . in turn , this leads to the loss of the monochromaticity of the radiation formed in the undulator .",
    "typical scale , within which the parameters vary noticeably , is equal to the period @xmath3 of the surface deformations . as we demonstrated in the paper",
    ", one can choose the following two strategies to partly restore the monochromaticity of radiation .",
    "firstly , one can use thin crystals , @xmath320 . in this case , the variation of the amplitude over the width as well as the contribution of higher subharmonics do not lead to dramatic changes in the spectrum .",
    "however , this limit corresponds to very thin crystals , if one takes into account that the period of surface deformations lies within the range @xmath321 @xmath158 m @xcite .",
    "the second approach prescribes the use of a thick crystal but in combination with a narrow ( @xmath322 ) positron beam along the midplane .",
    "this limit seems to be achievable by using existing positron beams in the gev range and with the size ( along one direction ) of several microns ( see @xcite ) .    to minimize the destructive role of the imperfect structure",
    ", one can also consider alternative schemes of the surface deformations .",
    "namely , if instead of just a periodic surface deformation one applies a _ harmonic _ surface deformation with a period @xmath3 , then the only imperfectness of the periodic bending in the bulk will be associated with the variation of the amplitude @xmath323 since for the amplitudes of subharmonics with @xmath324 will be identically equal to zero .",
    "this , in turn , will result in a much smaller variation of the undulator parameter and the bending parameter over the crystal width ( see eqs .",
    "( [ formalism4.1 ] ) and ( [ formalism4.2 ] ) , and figures [ figure.py ] and [ figure.cy ] ) since this variation is to a great extent due to the contribution of higher subharmonics . to achieve the harmonic shape of the surface deformation one can either place a crystal between two press molds of the harmonic profile ( shifted by @xmath119 with respect to each other ) or apply a modulated pressure by means of two piezoelectric layers .",
