    "the high temperature superconductors show remarkable deviations from fermi - liquid behaviour in their normal state above t@xmath1 , the superconducting transition temperature . although this seems to be experimentally well established , no consistent microscopic theoretical explanation has been found .",
    "there are a number of major differences with usual metallic ( bcs - type ) superconductors on which we concentrate for a theoretical understanding .",
    "the first one is the low dimensionality .",
    "for example , the normal state conductivity mainly takes place in the two - dimensional ( @xmath2-dimensions shall be denoted by @xmath2d throughout this paper ) copper oxide planes .",
    "the second difference is the extremely short coherence length of the cooper pairs in the superconducting state .",
    "these are known to be of the order of 20 @xmath3 ( 3 - 4 lattice constants ) , and therefore much smaller than in usual superconductors ( @xmath4 ) .",
    "this fact , together with the extremely low (  bad metals  ) quasiparticle density leads to pairs which are barely overlapping ( @xmath5 pairs / coherence volume ) with each other .",
    "such arguments were first stated in detail by randeria @xcite who investigated conditions for a crossover between superconductivity and bose condensation of pairs of electrons .",
    "the small overlap is claimed to be related to a separation of a temperature t@xmath6 , at which pairing takes place , from the temperature t@xmath1 , at which phase coherence and therefore superconductivity is established .",
    "in contrast to this , usual superconductors have @xmath7 pairs / coherence volume which is believed to be the reason why pairing and phase coherence take place at the same temperature , the mean - field t@xmath1 .",
    "another unusual property of the cuprate superconductors is the linear resistivity in the normal state of the optimally doped materials .",
    "an ideal fermi liquid should show a resistivity caused by electron - electron scattering near the fermi surface which varies quadratically with the temperature . on the other hand",
    ", a crossover to a linear resistivity due to phonons is expected to take place at much higher temperatures , above the debye temperature .",
    "finally , one last observation that we wish to focus on is the presence of a pseudo gap .",
    "this feature was first observed with nmr @xcite by measuring the spin - lattice relaxation rate for the @xmath8cu nucleus",
    ". the relaxation rate , @xmath9 , which is temperature independent in normal metals , decreases strongly with decreasing t even above t@xmath1 , in the high - t@xmath1-cuprates .",
    "the pseudogap has also been measured by optical experiments where it is found in the temperature dependence of the scattering time obtained from a generalized drude theory for optical conductivity data @xcite .",
    "the momentum dependence of the pseudo gap has been investigated with recent arpes experiments , and it is found to be present mainly along the @xmath10-direction , consistent with the proposed @xmath2-wave symmetry of the superconducting order parameter . it has also been observed by @xmath11sr @xcite and stm @xcite measurements . at present",
    ", there is ongoing discussion addressing the notion that the gap can be related to pair formation , or other possible precursor phenomena of superconductivity , which takes place at temperatures above that at which macroscopic phase coherence is established .",
    "the above - mentioned ideas have led us to consider a simple model system in 2d which can describe short coherence length pairs which might exist as preformed pairs above t@xmath1 .",
    "this model , the attractive hubbard model , for on - site , @xmath12-wave pairing only , allows us to focus on many of the above - mentioned properties .",
    "in particular , we have examined the dynamical properties of this model to see if the attractive hubbard model in 2d possesses a pseudogap .",
    "further , we have examined the temperature dependence of the imaginary part of the single - particle self energy to learn how the scattering rate behaves .",
    "we have focussed on this model in the low density limit . when studied in the limit of low band filling",
    "the attractive hubbard model represents a system with low quasiparticle densities , and therefore the weakly overlapping pairs proposed to characterize the cuprate superconductors are a natural consequence of this problem .",
    "an approximation which works well in the dilute limit is the ladder approximation ; this formalism accounts for all possible scattering events between particles that can occur in the particle - particle channel ( only particle - hole scatterings are ignored ) .    in a simple and elegant paper @xcite , schmitt - rink _ et al .",
    "_ , studied such model systems and concluded , at least in a non self - consistent treatment of such problems , that in 2d a stable , 2-particle bound state persists down to t=0 , and this leads to a t=0 bose condensation of composite bosons ( two fermions pair to form a boson ) .",
    "the physics of this phenomenon is that the appearance of preformed pairs leads to the elimination of the fermi surface ( there are no fermions left ) , and therefore superconductivity is suppressed in favour of t=0 bose condensation .",
    "the consequence of this work to the model system under consideration is as follows : in a non self - consistent treatment of the attractive hubbard model at low densities , employing the ladder approximation , the system is always unstable towards t=0 bose condensation of preformed pairs into an infinite lifetime , two - particle bound state @xcite .",
    "one of the focuses of this paper , and a second motivating force behind our study , is to test if this idea survives when the theory is solved in a fully self - consistent fashion . that is , when one includes interactions between pairs , does the physics of ref .",
    "@xcite survive ?",
    "a careful and detailed study of the interaction between pairs was given by haussmann @xcite , and here we will consider these ideas as applied to the observed normal state anomalies , including the formation of a pseudogap , and to the physics of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the numerical work of haussmann in 3d suggests that the physics of this problem is very different than that of its non self - consistent counterpart .",
    "in particular , he suggests that the bound state strongly hybridizes with the two - particle scattering continuum , and that this greatly reduces the appearance of preformed pairs .",
    "such a tendency has also been suggested by the work of several other authors .",
    "_ @xcite found in 2d , by applying the selfconsistent ladder approximation , that in the low doping regime the fermi - liquid properties are fully recovered and that only in the strong coupling regime can deviations from fermi - liquid behaviour be expected .",
    "( the work of these authors differs from our own work in that they use a very different method to obtain the dynamical properties of this model in this approximation . ) also , singer _",
    "et al . _ ,",
    "@xcite employed quantum monte carlo methods and concluded that the two - particle bound state , which they refer to as a `` band of pairs '' , is strongly overlapping with the one particle continuum , and only at very large attractive interactions does it become well separated from the one particle continuum .",
    "lastly , recent analytical work of kagan _ et al . _",
    "@xcite shows that when pair - pair interactions are included in a t=0 calculation , in the dilute limit the gap between the two - particle bound state and the one - particle continuum starts to close .",
    "our results are consistent with the above - state trends , and we do not find that the physics of ref .",
    "@xcite survives when pair - pair interactions are included .",
    "further , we find no evidence of a pseudogap . we have used double - time green s functions to study this system at t@xmath130 , and thus unlike other studies that examined this system using imaginary times ( the conventional matsubara frequency formulation ) who had to rely on pad approximants or maximum entropy techniques , we are able to examine the dynamical properties of this system directly .",
    "thus , we believe that we have a somewhat more reliable representation of the dynamics of this system .    we organize our paper as follows . in ",
    "[ sec : model ] we introduce the model and describe different levels of approximation which can be used for the ladder approximation . in the next section",
    "we introduce a @xmath14-averaged method along with a generalized spectral representation of all temperature - dependent green s functions which enables us to obtain results in a fully self - consistent calculation along the real time axis . in  [ subsec : justify ] we present numerical evidence that aids in justifying these approximations .",
    "our main results are presented in  [ sec : results ] , and in  [ sec : conclusion ] we present our conclusions .",
    "the model hamiltonian which we consider is the attractive ( negative - u ) hubbard model , given by @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the transfer integral between neighbouring lattice sites @xmath17 , @xmath18 are electronic creation , annihilation operators , respectively , and @xmath19 is the strength of the on - site attractive interaction between two electrons occupying the same lattice site . throughout this paper",
    "we restrict our attention to @xmath2-dimensional hyper - cubic lattices .    for completeness , we begin by reviewing the well studied ladder approximation to the bethe - salpeter equation @xcite .",
    "the dyson equation which has to be solved to obtain the full one - particle green s function contains a large number of complicated diagrams and can not be solved exactly .",
    "however , in the ladder approximation , which accounts for all possible scattering events between particles that can occur in the particle - particle channel ( only particle - hole scatterings are ignored ) , one can find a solution for the single - particle self energy .",
    "the ladder approximation can be motivated in the dilute limit by taking @xmath20 , the fermi momentum multiplied with the scattering length ( which in 3d is given by @xmath21 , which is the effective range of the attractive potential ) as an additional small parameter .",
    "this is so because all diagrams which include more than one hole propagator ( crossing diagrams ) are neglected , and therefore this approximation is valid in the low density limit .",
    "the repeated scattering enters the equation through the vertex function @xmath22 , and since the interaction @xmath19 is constant , the bethe - salpeter equation which determines @xmath22 becomes exactly solvable .    to display this solution",
    "we introduce the pair susceptibility , @xmath23 , given by @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the one - particle thermal green s function .",
    "note that the sign of this function is chosen to be different by different authors , and readers should take note the consequence of this sign choice in future equations .",
    "then , we can express the solution for the vertex function as @xmath26 which is shown diagrammatically in fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder ] .",
    "( 7,4.5 ) ( -1.0,-5.5 )    in our work we have chosen to subtract the interaction strength from @xmath27 to obtain an analytic function @xmath28 with properties appropriate for examination by a generalized kramers - kroning analysis ( this is equivalent to subtracting the hartree potential from the self energy ) , and thus introduce @xmath29 from now on , we shall only refer to @xmath30 .",
    "the criterion which determines a breakdown of the normal state due to superconducting pair formation with decreasing temperature is known as the thouless criterion @xcite .",
    "we have examined this condition in detail , and will report on our results elsewhere . here , we simply remark that the thouless condition is associated with the occurrence of a two - particle bound state ( with infinite lifetime ) at the chemical potential , and is signified by @xmath31    this equation , and the associated normal state properties , can be examined in a variety of increasingly more accurate approximations , and we review these approximations before proceeding to our results .      the self energy in this case ( from now on denoted by nscnc ) is given by @xmath32 the index @xmath33 indicates the use of free green s functions . the full green s function in this approximation",
    "is : @xmath34    most importantly , schmitt - rink _ et al .",
    "_ , @xcite have used this level of approximation and have shown that for any 2d system with an attractive interaction the system is unstable to the effective emptying of the fermi  circle  into the two - particle bound state .",
    "then , a condensation at t=0 of these noninteracting composite bosons takes place .",
    "while some criticism of this simple and elegant idea exists @xcite , we believe that for any non self - consistent theory the ideas of ref .",
    "@xcite are solid .",
    "what happens when one includes self consistency , namely when one includes pair interactions , is one of the focuses of this paper .",

    "@xcite using the same kind of formalism .",

    "@xcite is still correct and , in fact , is greatly simplified when one uses a nscc .",
    "one may treat the ladder approximation fully self consistently by calculating the self energy using the full interacting green s function .",

    "the significant achievement of a self - consistent calculation is the inclusion of pair - pair interactions , as was stated previously by haussmann @xcite ; unlike haussmann , who studied a 3d continuous system , here we study a 2d lattice system , and are thus able to critique the physics of ref . @xcite .",
    "( 7,4.5 ) ( -0.5,-5.5 )    equations ( [ eq : chi],[eq : gamma],[eq : sigscf],[eq : greenscf ] ) have to be solved in an iterative way until self consistency is achieved .",

    "in this section we outline how we solved the self - consistency problem in our @xmath14-averaged approximation .",
    "also , we have employed another approximation in the spectral representations for certain functions , and here we make this approach clear .",
    "lastly , as was mentioned earlier , our work on this problem involves the real - frequency formulation of the thermal green s functions .",
    "this formulation follows naturally from the analyticity of the retarded ( and advanced ) green s function which is , _",
    "e.g. _ , explained in the work of zubarev @xcite , and we refer the reader to this reference for further details .",
    "the work in this section makes clear the relationship between this formalism and the matsubara frequency formalism .    in order to solve for the non self - consistent version of the ladder approximation , in either conserving or non - conserving theories",

    "the susceptibility is used to calculate the vertex , from which one can evaluate the self energy . in order to solve for these equations self consistently",
    ", one uses the self energy to evaluate a new approximation for the green s function , and repeats the above process until the resulting green s function converges .    in our @xmath14-averaged approximation , we require only the momentum averaged pair susceptibility ; thus , only the momentum averaged green s function is required .",
    "that is , denoting the @xmath14-averaged quantities by overlined quantities @xmath37    as a computational approximation , we use a spectral representation for the @xmath14-averaged functions : they are approximated by a number of @xmath38-functions ( typically several hundred ) along the real axis .",
    "these @xmath38-functions were placed in a fashion such that they are exponentially dense around the chemical potential ( with a spacing @xmath39e @xmath40 ) and around the lower band edge .",
    "the advantage of this representation is that all frequency summations appearing in our @xmath14-averaged approximation can be done analytically .",
    "according to our spectral representation , the averaged one - particle green s function reads : @xmath41 to express the green s function entirely by a series of poles along the real axis where to every frequency can belong a superposition of different degenerate energy levels , is usually called the lehmann representation @xcite . in this way we also understand our approximation above .",
    "the function @xmath42 is the imaginary part of the ( retarded ) one - particle green s function along the real axis @xcite .",
    "the superscript @xmath43 in this and future quantities labels the number of the iteration step as convergence to self consistency is performed .",
    "further , @xmath44 is the number of @xmath38 functions which were used , @xmath45 is the position of each @xmath38 peak on the real axis , and @xmath46 is the weight of this peak .",

    "( [ greennp1 ] ) .    by going through one loop of self - consistency in this equations the number of poles",
    "is increased from @xmath44 to @xmath69 . to avoid that the number of @xmath38-functions we have to deal with exceeds the number we can handle numerically and to avoid divergences which can occur if two poles come too close to each other we apply two additional approximations .",
    "first , we unite two delta peaks to a single one if their positions come closer to each other then @xmath70 , where @xmath71 is smallest at the chemical potential and at the lower band edge of the unperturbed system .",
    "second , we neglect a pole whose weight is smaller than a certain boundary @xmath72 which is again smallest at the chemical potential .",
    "this has to be done in the way that the loss of spectral weight is distributed onto all other poles in order to fulfill the sum rules .    in this way we have solved eq .",

    ".    we can therefore do the whole self - consistency loop by calculating all quantities * _ along the real axis_*. in order to show that this is indeed equivalent to the imaginary axis matsubara frequency formalism we show how one can calculate the particle number in both formalisms .",

    "which can be expressed by using the spectral representation as an integration along the real axis : @xmath77 this can be reduced by approximating the spectral function as a sum of @xmath38 functions as done above : @xmath78 together we can express the particle number with these @xmath38 functions : @xmath79    note that the dimensionality of the system enters into this calculation as the shape of @xmath80 , whose imaginary part is the spectral function of the uncorrelated system . to obtain numerical results",
    "we composed the unperturbed green function @xmath80 of a number ( typically 20 ) of @xmath38-functions .",

    "( [ eq : gammakav ] ) becomes manifestly justifiable .",
    "this is the case for large temperatures since @xmath83 , as the numerator for the calculation of @xmath84 , is small .",
    "therefore @xmath84 becomes small .",
    "of course , this is simply the uncorrelated limit ( note that a @xmath14 dependence still survives in the green s function , since the free green s function has such a dependence ) .",

    "the dispersion becomes weaker for larger @xmath19 since the effective transfer of a pair is @xmath87 .",
    "so , in this case the average over @xmath14-space is also a good approximation , since all we are doing is replacing the bound state below the continuum by its average .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig:2pdisp ] .",
    "( 7,7.5 ) ( -4.2,-1 )    probably the most interesting limit is that of large spatial dimensions .",

    "such an approximation gives several results which are seemingly also valid in 2d and 3d ; for a review see @xcite .",

    "also , the physics in the scc result is more easily seen .",
    "these figures show quite clearly that ( i ) the chemical potential is in the band ( for the scc formulation , this is true for temperatures below about 0.9 ) , and ( ii ) no evidence of a pseudo gap is found . instead ,",

    "the physics can be related to the behaviour of chemical potential , namely , when an attractive potential of any strength is present in 2d ( or 1d ) a bound state is formed , and this state",

    "we note that the reappearance of the fermi surface was also seen in the scc work of fresard et al .",
    "@xcite .    to better understand this",
    ", we now consider the behaviour of this bound state via the scc vertex function . examining the vertex function",
    "@xmath99 probably best explains the different physics between the nscc and the scc formulations : for the nscc calculation , the infinite lifetime bound state is seen as a ( numerically broadened ) delta function in @xmath100 ( inset in fig .",

    "so , we stress again that for the scc calculation there is no infinite lifetime bound state , opposite to the nscc calculation . when treating the system self - consistently , pair - pair interactions are included which lead to a finite lifetime of the pairs and therefore the condensation of the fermions into a bound state is hindered .",
    "( 7,7.5 ) ( -4.2,-1 )      the above results showed that in a scc theory the fermi surface survives at low temperatures .",
    "the natural question is then : is this a fermi liquid ?    to help us answer this question , we consider the ( real ) frequency dependence of the imaginary part of the self energy @xmath60 . in a scc theory it exhibits a minimum at the chemical potential , and this qualitative behaviour is indeed similar to a fermi liquid . however , in fig . [",
    "fig : sigmaimag2d ] we have plotted this quantity , which is related to the inverse quasi - particle lifetime at the chemical potential , as a function of temperature . the calculated value seems to indicate a linear variation with temperature ( the extrapolated value is simply a function of our numerical broadening , and in this calculation has no physical significance ) .",
    "( 7,7.5 ) ( -4.2,-1 )    to understand this we note that standard arguments , based on , e.g. , fermi s golden rule , predict the @xmath104 behaviour of a fermi liquid . however ,",
    "and we argue , that if the dominant scattering is between lifetime broadened two - particle bound states and quasiparticles , then such a linear t behaviour is indeed expected .",
    "crucial to this argument is the approximate temperature independence of the lifetime of the two - particle bound state , something that our numerics make clear .",
    "further consequences of this simple phenomenology are presently being explored .",
    "we have examined the attractive hubbard model in 2d using a @xmath14-averaged method .",
    "further , we have studied the dynamical properties of this model using real time axis thermal green s functions  this allows for an accurate determination of quantities like the single - particle density of states , and the energy dependencies of the self energy and vertex function .",
    "we have compared our approach to the more familiar matusbara frequency method in 1d , and have found little difference between the results obtained by the two methods .",
    "however , the @xmath14-averaged method allows us to reach much lower temperatures without enormous computational efforts .",
    "we have included pair - pair interactions , as formulated by haussmann , in a scc theory .",
    "our results for such a theory lead us to believe that the attractive hubbard model in 2d , for a correlation energy roughly equal to the bandwidth , does not have a pseudo gap .",
    "instead , there is actually an enhancement of the spectral weight near the fermi surface .",
    "the nature of the ground state properties is uncertain , since we find a linear temperature dependence of the quasi - particle scattering rate over a wide temperature range .",
