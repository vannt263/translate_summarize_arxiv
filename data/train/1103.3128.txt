    "it has always been accepted that a star cluster ( sc ) is composed of stars belonging to a single , simple stellar population with a uniform age and chemical composition . in recent years , however , due to the increase in spatial resolution and photometric accuracy , it has been discovered that some scs have unusual structures in their observed color - magnitude diagrams ( cmds ) .",
    "for example , ngc 2173 in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) has an unusually large spread in color about its main - sequence turn - off ( msto ) @xcite ; omega centauri exhibits a main sequence ( ms ) bifurcation @xcite ; ngc 2808 possesses a triple ms split @xcite ; and other clusters also contain mutiple stellar populations @xcite .",
    "more interesting discoveries are that the intermediate - age massive clusters in the lmc , such as ngc 1846 , 1806 , and 1783 , possess double main - sequence turn - offs ( dmstos ) on their cmds @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite found that the spread of the msto is fairly continuous rather than strongly bimodal . @xcite and @xcite argued that these clusters do not possess a significant line - of - sigth depth or internal dispersion in [ fe / h ] , or suffer from significant differential extinction .",
    "@xcite showed that spreads in [ fe / h ] in scs like ngc 1783 are very small .",
    "the apparent homogeneity in [ fe / h ] of all stars in ngc 1846 indicates that capture of pre - existing field stars during cluster formation seems to hard to explain the dmstos @xcite .",
    "the dmstos are interpreted as that the clusters have two distinct stellar populations with differences in age of @xmath0 200 - 300 myr but with similar metal abundance @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xcite found multiple mstos ( mmstos ) in ngc 419 in the small magellanic cloud , and @xcite found two distinct red clumps ( rc ) in this cluster .",
    "these observational results are challenging the traditional picture .    in order to understand how a cluster can contain multiple populations with different ages ,",
    "many scenarios were proposed .",
    "@xcite put forward the scenario of merger of two ( or more ) scs .",
    "however , @xcite pointed out that this scenario seems unlikely .",
    "@xcite simulated the merger of a sc with a giant molecular cloud ( gmc ) .",
    "they found that this merger can produce a second - generation of stars that are required to explain the dmstos .",
    "however , in order to obtain the differences in age of @xmath0 200 - 300 myr , this scenario require rather strongly constrained ranges of gmc parameters such as their spatial distribution , mass function , and chemical composition @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite put forward the scenario of formation of a second generation of stars from the ejecta of first generation asymptotic giant branch stars . in this scenario ,",
    "the young second generation is usually less than the first one @xcite , which is not consistent with observations @xcite .",
    "recently , using two scaling relations to mimic the effects of rotation , @xcite considered the effect of rotation on stellar evolutions .",
    "they found that stellar rotation in stars with masses between 1.2 and 1.7 can mimic the effect of a double population when rotation rates reach 20 - 50 per cent of the critical rotation , whereas in actuality only a single population exists .",
    "however , @xcite and @xcite argued that rotational effect could not explain the presence of mmstos .",
    "they proposed a prolonged star formation ( psf ) to explain the mmstos and the dual rc . in @xcite models , in order to reproduce the dual rc of ngc 419 , a psf of about 700 myr is required .",
    "the dual rc was also found in ngc 1751 @xcite . in order to explain this dual rc , a psf of about 460 myr",
    "is required @xcite .",
    "this age spread is twice longer than @xmath0 200 myr estimated by @xcite using the method of isochrone fitting .",
    "furthermore , recently , @xcite argued that the isolation of extended msto clusters to intermediate ages could be the consequence of observational selection effects .",
    "in addition , binary stars of lmc clusters are unresolved even with hubble space telescope @xcite .",
    "the binary system should appear as a single point - source object .",
    "thus the unresolved binary systems may have contributions to the spread of msto .",
    "however , several investigators @xcite had found that unresolved binaries can not alone reproduce the peculiar msto structures . nevertheless , after a star in a binary system accretes mass from its companion",
    ", it will become younger apparently .",
    "hence , interactive binaries may have contributions to the spread of msto .",
    "@xcite found that the younger populations in clusters are more centrally concentrated than the older populations .",
    "thus the interactive binaries may be important in interpreting the observed cmds . in this paper , using the hurley rapid single and binary evolution codes @xcite and a stellar population - synthesis method , we investigated the contributions of interactive binaries to the dmstos and dual rc .",
    "the paper is organized as follow .",
    "we show our stellar population - synthesis method in section 2 .",
    "we present the results in section 3 and discuss and summarize them in section 4 .",
    "to investigate dmstos and dual rc of scs , we calculated a binary - star stellar population ( bsp ) .",
    "stellar samples are generated by monte carlo simulations .",
    "the basic assumptions for the simulations are as follows .",
    "( i ) the lognormal initial mass function ( imf ) of @xcite is adopted .",
    "( ii ) we generate the mass of the primary , @xmath1 , according to the imf .",
    "the ratio ( @xmath2 ) of the mass of the secondary to that of the primary is assumed to be a uniform distribution within 0 - 1 for simplicity .",
    "the mass of the secondary star is then determined by @xmath3 .",
    "( iii ) we assume that all stars are members of binary systems and that the distribution of separations ( @xmath4 ) is constant in @xmath5 for wide binaries and falls off smoothly at close separation : @xmath6 where @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "this distribution implies that the numbers of wide binary system per logarithmic interval are equal , and that approximately 50% of the stellar systems are binary systems with orbital periods less than 100 yr @xcite .",
    "* however , binaries account for typically @xmath030 - 40% of all stars in the clusters of lmc , such as in ngc 1818 and 1806 @xcite . *",
    "( iv ) the eccentricity ( e ) of each binary system is assumed to be a uniform distribution within 0 - 1 . with these assumptions , we calculated the evolutions of 5@xmath11 binaries with @xmath1 between 0.8 and 5.0 .",
    "the metal abundance z of evolutionary models was converted firstly into [ fe / h ]",
    ". then the theoretical properties ( [ fe / h ] , t@xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 ) have been transformed into colors and magnitudes using the color transformation tables of @xcite . the binaries with @xmath15 were treated as unresolved ones , while others were treated as resolved ones when we computed their colors and magnitudes .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the cmds of the simulated bsp with z = 0.008 and age = 1.8 gyr .",
    "the interactive binaries are shown in red , while non - interactive binaries are shown in green .",
    "the population of the brighter msto ( bmsto ) is mainly from the unresolved binaries with @xmath16 0.7 and no interactions .",
    "the isochrones of single - star stellar populations ( ssp ) with the same z but different ages are overplotted on the cmd in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . the stars that experienced binary interactions clearly deviate from the isochrone of non - interactive binaries in the region around msto , which leads to a large spread in color .",
    "the interactive binaries clearly produce an extended msto rather than bimodal msto . for main sequence * binary * stars with @xmath17 22.5 mag , * about 10% of the binary stars lie between the 1.8 and 1.5 gyr isochrones in our models , not including the binaries on the 1.8 gyr isochrone*. however , interactive binaries hardly affect the rest of ms , subgiant branch and first giant branch ( fgb ) .",
    "moreover , interactive binaries result in the appearance of a secondary rc ( src ) at about 0.5 mag below the main rc .",
    "the src is slightly bluer than the ridgeline of fgb stars .",
    "the contribution of non - interactive binaries to the src is negligible .",
    "the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] shows that the ridge of the src is almost coincident with the isochrone of rc stars of the ssp with age = 1.2 gyr .",
    "about 12% of core - helium burning ( cheb ) * binary * stars are located between the 1.8 and 1.5 gyr isochrones .",
    "however , about 30% of cheb * binary * stars are located between the main rc and 1.2 gyr isochrone , not including * the binary * stars on the main rc but including those on 1.2 gyr isochrone .",
    "the mass of the src stars is mainly located between 1.85 and 2.1 , while that of the main rc stars is less than 1.7 .",
    "the dual rc was discovered in ngc 752 , 7789 and 419 @xcite and ngc 1751 @xcite .",
    "cluster ngc 419 has an age of about 1.35 gyr @xcite .",
    "we computed a cluster with age = 1.3 gyr and z = 0.004 .",
    "its cmds are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] . just as above results ,",
    "the interactive binaries lead to a large spread in color in the region around msto , but they do not reproduce dmstos . however , the interactive binaries lead to the presence of a distinct src .",
    "the ridge of the src is almost coincident with the isochrone of rc stars of the ssp with age = 1.1 gyr .",
    "this implies that the src produced by binary interactions has an apparent age of about 1.1 gyr in our models , whereas actually it has an age of 1.3 gyr .",
    "* for this dual rc , about 15% of binary stars * are located between the 1.3 and 1.1 gyr isochrones , including the * binaries * on the 1.1 gyr isochrone but not including those on 1.3 gyr isochrone .",
    "the magnitude extension between main rc and src is about 0.35 mag .",
    "the mass of the src stars is mainly located between 1.85 and 2.05 , while that of the main rc stars is mainly located between 1.78 and 1.81 . for z = 0.004 , in stars more massive than about 1.88 ( this value is about 2.0 for z = 0.02 ) ,",
    "helium - burning temperatures are reached at the center before electrons become degenerate there . for these stars ,",
    "when they are on zero - age horizontal branch ( zahb ) , their magnitudes decrease with decreasing mass .",
    "however , for the stars with @xmath18 1.88 , electrons in the hydrogen - exhausted core are highly degenerate before helium ignition occurs . when they are on zahb , their magnitudes increase rapidly with decreasing mass except for stars with @xmath18 1.5 .",
    "the magnitudes of zahb stars with @xmath18 1.5 increase very slowly with decreasing mass . for z = 0.004 ,",
    "the evolutionary tracks of rc stars with mass between about 1.85 and 2.0 are very near each other in cmds .",
    "thus the interactive binaries with mass between about 1.85 and 2.0 can gather to form a src .",
    "our calculations show that the src caused by binary interactions appears mainly in clusters with 1.2 gyr @xmath19 age @xmath19 3.0 gyr .",
    "@xcite showed that the fraction of younger ( brighter ) population is about 75% in the case of ngc 1846 . in our models ,",
    "the ` younger ' population are mainly from the merged binary systems and interactive binaries with mass transfer .",
    "the merging and mass transfer in binary systems can be affected by the distributions of separation ( @xmath4 ) , eccentricity ( @xmath20 ) and mass - ratio ( @xmath2 ) of systems .",
    "we computed the bsp by using the distributions @xmath21 = constant @xcite , @xmath22 and @xmath23 and the imf of @xcite .",
    "however , the fraction of the interactive binaries are not obviously enhanced .",
    "we also computed the bsp using the distribution @xmath21 = constant and gaussian distributions for @xmath20 and @xmath2 .",
    "the mean value and standard deviation of the gaussian distributions is 0.5 and 0.13 for @xmath20 , 0.6 and 0.1 for @xmath2 , respectively .",
    "the values of the standard deviation are chosen in order to make the values of @xmath20 and @xmath2 are located between 0 and 1 . in this simulation , * about 20% of binary stars lie between the 1.8 and 1.5 gyr isochrones for the cluster with z = 0.008 and age = 1.8 gyr ; while for the rc of the cluster with z = 0.004 and age = 1.3 gyr , about 30% of binary stars lie between the 1.3 and 1.1 gyr isochrones . *",
    "the mass of turn - off stars is about 1.46 for the cluster with z = 0.008 and age = 1.8 gyr in our models .",
    "the evolutions of a wide binary system without mass transfer are similar to those of single stars with the same mass",
    ". however , the evolution of stars whose mass increased via mass accretion or merging is always slower than that of single stars with the same mass .",
    "for example , a mass - accreted star with @xmath24 = 1.55 , which was reached by accretion , just arrives at around msto at the age of 1.8 gyr .",
    "however , a single star with an initial mass of 1.55 has left the msto at the same age .",
    "thus the mass - accreted stars clearly deviate from the ridge of the isochrone in the region around msto and have an apparent younger age .",
    "the more the accreted mass , the more the deviation .",
    "thus the spread of msto of bsp is continuous rather than bimodal .",
    "however , for the mass - accreted stars with @xmath18 1.25 , an increase in mass leads to a shift of their position in cmds almost along ms .",
    "therefore , the most of ms are hardly spread by binary interactions .",
    "the src is almost made of the mass - accreted or merged stars whose mass is slightly more massive than the critical mass that is just enough to avoid electron - degeneracy occurring in stellar h - exhausted cores in our models .",
    "the stars with the critical mass usually evolve into rc at the age of about 1.1 - 1.2 gyr ( for the stars with @xmath25 , this age can increase to about 1.3 gyr ) .",
    "hence , the src caused by interactive binaries should have an apparent age of about 1.1 - 1.2 gyr , whereas actually it has an age as old as that of main rc .",
    "the apparent age of about 1.1 - 1.2 gyr is consistent with the estimates of @xcite for ngc 1751 and 419 .",
    "the main rc stars passed through electron degeneracy .",
    "the magnitude of these stars increases with decreasing mass .",
    "the older the age of clusters , the lower the mass of main rc stars .",
    "thus , the magnitude extension between main rc and src increases with age until the mass of the main rc is less than about 1.5 . because the magnitude of zahb stars with @xmath18 1.5 increases very slowly with decreasing mass , there is an upper limit of magnitude extension of about 0.8 mag between main rc and src in our models .",
    "moreover , with increasing age , the src becomes slightly bluer than fgb .",
    "for the clusters with age @xmath19 1.2 gyr , the mass of all rc stars is almost larger than the critical mass .",
    "therefore , the src caused by interactive binaries should not appear in these clusters .",
    "in addition , in old clusters , the initial mass of rc stars is low .",
    "if the mass is not enough to be increased to above the critical mass by accretion or merging , the src should not be produced by binary interactions in the old clusters . moreover ,",
    "if the fraction of binaries is too low , the src also could not be produced .",
    "@xcite argued that the ms+red clump binaries can not mimic the dual rc in ngc 419 . in our models ,",
    "the src stars are from the merged binaries and binary systems with mass transfer .    in this paper",
    ", we showed that binary interactions such as mass transfer and binary merging can produce an extended msto and dual rc in cmds of intermediate - age clusters , whereas in actuality only a single population exists . despite these , the rest of ms , subgiant branch and fgb are not clearly spread by the binary interactions .",
    "interactive binaries can lead to an extension of msto rather than dmstos . for a cluster with z = 0.008 and age = 1.8 gyr",
    ", its isochrone can be spread down to @xmath0 1.5 gyr by interactive binaries .",
    "however , * only about 10% of binary stars lie between the 1.8 and 1.5 gyr isochrones * in our models .",
    "moreover , the src that is caused by interactive binaries should have an apparent age of about 1.1 - 1.2 gyr .",
    "although binary interactions can not lead to the bimodal msto , the src in ngc 419 and extended msto of ngc 1846 may be partly from the mass - accreted or merged binary stars .",
