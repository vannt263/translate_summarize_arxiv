    "stars form from the cold interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "the resulting stellar mass growth , chemical enrichment and energy feedback to the ism and intergalactic medium ( igm ) are key processes of galaxy formation and evolution . understanding how stars form is thus one of the central questions in galactic and extragalactic astronomy .",
    "star formation invokes a series of complicated processes from gas accretion , gas cooling and h@xmath6 formation to the final molecular cloud collapse and stellar feedback .",
    "empirical scaling laws between star formation and gas reservoirs provide critical tests of our modeling of the above various processes and have crucial applications to studies of galaxy formation and evolution in the cosmological context .    in the pioneering work of @xcite ,",
    "a simple power law relation is proposed to relate the star formation rate ( sfr ) density to the gas density : @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the sfr volume density , @xmath9 is the volume density of total cold gas including hi and molecular hydrogen ( h@xmath6 ) and @xmath10 is the power index while @xmath11 is simply assumed to be constant .",
    "@xcite demonstrated this unambiguously in its observable form ( surface density ) with 61 nearby spiral galaxies and 36 infrared - selected nuclear starburst regions that span a large dynamic range and concluded : @xmath12 which is often referred as the kennicutt - schmidt ( ks ) law .",
    "it makes general sense that the gas reservoir determines how many stars can form , i.e. , the gas density plays the dominant role in regulating sfr . with this basic relation between sfr and gas , the star formation efficiency ( sfe = sfr / gas - mass in this study )",
    "follows : @xmath13 it should be noted that the ks law does not hold for the whole range of gas densities .",
    "an accompanying rule is the star formation threshold , introduced to explain the fact that the sfr is significantly lower than predicted by the ks law at low gas densities ( @xmath14@xmath151 - 10 m@xmath16 pc@xmath17 ) , e.g. , in low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) galaxies or regions far outside the optical disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "other forms of the schmidt law have also been proposed , such as those that invoke the dynamical factors @xcite : @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the orbital dynamical timescale .",
    "this relation has been demonstrated to predict the sfr as well as the ks law when considering the orbital timescale @xcite , while the break may still show up at the low density end @xcite .",
    "although the above two schmidt relations are valid for a range of galaxy types both in the local universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and at high - z ( e.g. * ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it is surprising that they only invoke the gas component while in reality various ism and stellar components are intimately involved in processes of converting gas into new stars .",
    "many of these processes are related to existing stars that form over the whole galaxy s history .",
    "for example , the gravitational effects of stellar bars can remove gas angular momentum and increase nuclear sfrs in normal galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "their effects are also recognized in numerical simulations of gas - rich galaxy merging and thought to be the main factor to determine how much gas can be converted into stars @xcite . the gas hydrostatic pressure produced by gas self - gravity and stellar gravity",
    "is further shown empirically to be related to the h@xmath6-to - hi ratio @xcite . besides the stellar gravity , the metal outputs of stellar evolution are the main coolants of gas and thus star formation should show dependencies on the metallicity .",
    "theoretical works have indicated significantly lower sfes at low metallicity @xcite .",
    "dust grains that form from metals catalyze the h@xmath6 formation and shield it from radiation destruction ( for a review , see * ? ? ?",
    "current proposed schmidt relations do not have any hint for these effects , as they only invoke the gas component .    to evaluate the importance of existing stars in the empirical scaling law , we demonstrate the existence of a tight relationship between sfes and stellar mass surface densities , referred as the extended schmidt law .",
    "this relation not only predicts the sfe and sfr as well as the ks law for galaxies and spatially - resolved regions ( @xmath151 kpc sizes ) where the ks law works , but also holds for lsb galaxies and regions where the ks law fails .",
    "similar close links between star formation and total stars have been recognized in previous works for certain galaxy types or limited stellar mass surface density ranges .",
    "for example , @xcite have shown for radial azimuthally - averaged quantities in lsb galaxies that the stellar mass density is the only quantity spatially related to the sfr density .",
    "similar close associations between stellar masses and sfr densities are also seen within and among galaxies by @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and recently by @xcite for specific galaxy types or limited density ranges .",
    "here , we demonstrate this intimate association directly by showing a tight relation between the sfe and stellar mass density over a large dynamic range . in   [ sample_data ] , we present the sample selection and data collection .",
    "we show the result in   [ result ] . in",
    "  [ discussion ] , we first compare the extended schmidt law to the model of the star formation recipe and then discuss its implication for the main sequence of star - forming galaxies .",
    "conclusions are presented in   [ paper_conclusion ] . throughout this paper , we assume @xmath20=70 km s@xmath21 mpc@xmath21 , @xmath22=0.3 and @xmath23=0.7 .",
    "our whole sample is listed in table  [ tab_samp_cohi ] and composed of five sub - samples including low - redshift late - type galaxies , early - type galaxies , lsb galaxies , luminous infrared galaxies and high - z objects .",
    "the co and hi data are collected from the literature .",
    "molecular gas masses are derived from the co by assuming a constant co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factor of @xmath24=2.0@xmath2510@xmath26 cm@xmath17 ( k km s@xmath21)@xmath21 or 3.17 m@xmath16 pc@xmath17 ( k km s@xmath21)@xmath21 or 7845@xmath28 m@xmath16 ( jy km s@xmath21)@xmath21 where @xmath29 is the luminosity distance in mpc @xcite . different conversion factors for mergers and non - mergers are also discussed in   [ res_ind_gal ] .",
    "a factor of 1.36 is further included to account for the presence of heavier elements in both the h@xmath6 and hi masses .",
    "the sfr data are collected from the same references as the gas data ( see table  [ tab_samp_cohi ] ) , and all are corrected to chabrier initial mass function ( imf ) where sfr@xmath30@xmath31sfr@xmath32=0.66sfr@xmath33 @xcite .",
    "the stellar masses are measured by fitting the @xcite population synthesis model to the multi - band sed with chabrier imf following @xcite .",
    "the details of the parameters to produce the models are listed in table  [ bc_model ] .",
    "the model of @xcite generally produces consistent color and mass - to - light ratio at various bands compared to others @xcite .",
    "however , it still lacks accurate evolutionary tracks of thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars . at the stellar age around 0.1 - 3 gyr where agb stars are prominent",
    ", the mass - to - light ratio in the near - ir can be overestimated by @xmath1560% @xcite .",
    "the effect of this on the result of this paper is shown to be small ( see   [ res_ind_gal ] ) . to minimize systematic errors that may be caused by different template population models ,",
    "the range of input parameter spaces , numerical method and etc , we have applied the above method to all of our objects except for 23 galaxies from @xcite whose masses are derived from irac 3.6 @xmath34 m emission in that work . for these objects ,",
    "the published gas and sfr surface densities are defined within 1.5@xmath35 where the available optical photometry does not exist . for the spiral objects in their sample where the majority ( @xmath3695% ) of the optical light is enclosed within @xmath35 @xcite , the median offset between their stellar masses and ours by fitting models to optical",
    "/ irac photometry is only 0.1 dex .",
    "the broad - band wavelengths used to calculate the stellar masses for all objects are listed in table  [ tab_samp_cohi ] and the majority covers both the optical and near - ir bands .",
    "the surface densities of gas , sfr and stellar masses are measured within the same aperture and corrected for inclinations .",
    "table  [ tab_samp_cohi ] lists the aperture definitions and their relations to optical isophotal radii ( @xmath37 ) if available in @xcite .",
    "different apertures are adopted for different galaxy types , partly because of the heterogeneous nature of the sample but also because of different light structures of individual galaxy types . since a star formation law describes how star forms from gas , an ideal aperture for a galaxy - averaged star formation relationship should enclose the majority of star formation or gas .",
    "this certainly results in different aperture sizes for galaxies with different types , e.g. , compact apertures for ultra luminous infrared galaxies ( ulirgs ) and wide ones for low surface - brightness ( lsb ) galaxies . as discussed in   [ res_ind_gal ] ,",
    "the extended schmidt law depends little on how exactly an aperture is defined .",
    "we estimated a typical error of 0.30 dex for each quantity ( sfr , gas and stellar mass densities ) based on our own experiences of measurements , while local lirgs and high - z galaxies have higher uncertainties ( @xmath150.5 dex ) due to low spatial resolution .",
    "late - type galaxies : this subsample includes 61 and 18 objects from @xcite and @xcite , respectively . for 11 objects included in both samples , the data from the latter is used in this work because of higher data quality .",
    "galaxies from @xcite have published sfr and gas surface densities that are defined to be within the optical isophotal radii ( @xmath35 , * ? ? ?",
    "the sfr is based on the extinction - corrected h@xmath38 emission with @xmath39=1.1 mag ( see their paper for the equation ) .",
    "the optical / near - ir photometry used to derive stellar masses are collected from ned .",
    "since the aperture of @xmath35 encloses the majority ( @xmath3695% ) of optical light for spiral galaxies @xcite , the aperture - matched stellar mass density is thus defined by dividing the total mass with @xmath40 .",
    "all spiral galaxies from @xcite have published gas , sfr and stellar mass densities , where the aperture radius is defined to be 1.5@xmath41 .",
    "the sfr is measured from the combination of fuv and 24 @xmath34 m emission ( see their paper for the equation ) . for 11 objects from this study",
    "also included in the sample of @xcite , we checked the median offset in the stellar mass between ours and theirs is only 0.1 dex .",
    "early - type galaxies : low level star formation has been detected in circumnuclear regions of many early - type galaxies @xcite . although the difficulty of sfr measurements due to contamination from large populations of old stars and possible agn , these objects are shown to follow more or less the kennicutt - schmidt law .",
    "we here included nine objects from @xcite and 10 objects from @xcite .",
    "@xcite have published aperture - matched h@xmath6 mass from co data and sfr from a combination of 24 @xmath34 m and uv emission following @xcite . for six of nine objects , we estimated the hi mass from the available vla hi map in the literature ( see table  [ tab_samp_cohi ] ) and found that the hi mass in the co - aperture is @xmath14 10% of the total hi . based on this ,",
    "we therefore included three more objects with the total hi mass @xmath14 1.6 times the h@xmath6 mass , which implies the hi mass within the co aperture is smaller than 16% of h@xmath6 .",
    "objects in @xcite have available aperture - matched total gas mass and sfr measurements .",
    "as recommended in that work , we have used 24@xmath34m+h@xmath38 or pah+h@xmath38 if available and radio+h@xmath38 for two more objects , where they have used formula calibrated in @xcite ( see their table 4 ) . for objects from both works ,",
    "the aperture - matched stellar mass density is estimated in this work by fitting the stellar synthesis models to the aperture - matched 2mass j , h and k photometry and sdss optical photometry for most of them .",
    "low - surface - brightness ( lsb ) galaxies : we defined the lsb objects as an independent subsample as they show deviations from the ks law .",
    "the subsample includes all the 19 objects from @xcite and 5 gas - rich dwarf galaxies from @xcite that have stellar mass surface densities below 1 m@xmath16 pc@xmath17 that is roughly the upper limit of the @xcite sample .",
    "@xcite measured the surface densities of the sfr and gas mass through uv emission ( using @xcite equation ) and hi , respectively , where the aperture is defined to be the minimum of the maximum radii of uv and hi emission . for these objects ,",
    "the contribution from obscured star formation should be negligible to the total sfr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while the hi should dominate the total gas mass ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we derived the stellar mass from the sdss photometry while additional near - ir photometry from ned was also used for two objects .",
    "as the published sdss data under - estimate the sizes and thus brightness of these objects , we have re - measured five - band sdss photometry in the aperture adopted in @xcite .",
    "the majority of these objects have optical emission out to the adopted radius as observed by sdss ( see the @xmath42-band radial profile in @xcite ) .",
    "the comparison of our r - band photometry to those measured by @xcite shows @xmath1410% discrepancy .",
    "all dwarf galaxies from @xcite have published gas , sfr and stellar mass densities within 1.5@xmath41 .",
    "local lirgs ( z=0 lirgs ) : we have collected seven local lirgs from the literature with two criteria : ( 1 ) the spatially - resolved co interferometer images are available and well resolved ( i.e. the deconvolved size is larger than the resolution ) ; ( 2 ) the interferometer fluxes recover the majority ( @xmath3690% ) of single - dish measurements . as listed in table 1 , the aperture to define the surface density is the maximum extent of the co emission . for the total gas density ,",
    "we have neglected the contribution from the atomic gas in these gas rich objects .",
    "since star formation takes place in molecular clouds , we assume all star formation is included in the co aperture where the sfr is based on the ir luminosity assuming @xcite relations and corrected to chabrier imf . to measure the aperture - matched stellar mass density , we first calculated the total mass by fitting stellar models to the uv / optical / near - ir sed collected from ned , and then measured the part in the co aperture with the hst / acs - f814w image assuming a constant mass - to - light ratio , which can cause additional stellar mass uncertainty ( @xmath150.3 dex ) .",
    "high - redshift star - forming galaxies ( high - z sfgs ) and merging sub - millimeter galaxies ( high - z smgs ) : we here included 21 optically / near - ir selected star - forming galaxies ( egs , bzk and bxmd ) and 7 sub - millimeter objects from @xcite .",
    "the sfr and gas are available in that work .",
    "the sfr for the egs is estimated from a combination of extinction - corrected h@xmath38/[o ii]/galex - uv and spitzer 24 @xmath34 m emission .",
    "for the bzk , it is a combination of extinction - corrected uv and 24 @xmath34 m emission . for the bxmd objects , it is from extinction - corrected h@xmath38 emission while the sfr of the smg is from 850 @xmath34 m emission ( see @xcite for the equation ) .",
    "we measured stellar masses by our own to reduce systematic errors among different studies .",
    "the median offset of our stellar masses compared to the literature data are -0.16 dex , 0.34 dex , -0.55 dex and 0.00 dex for egs , bzk , bxmd and submm galaxies , respectively ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite , respectively ) .",
    "the large offsets for bxmd ( @xmath432.2 ) and bzk ( @xmath431.5 ) are mainly due to the lack of the rest - frame near - ir photometry , which could cause large differences when different template seds are used . with the unified stellar mass measurement , the scatter among them in the extended schmidt law does become smaller .",
    "the galaxy size is defined as the half light radius obtained from the fit to h@xmath38 , optical / uv or co images .",
    "similar to @xcite , all densities are defined within the half light radius ( @xmath44 ) , e.g. , @xmath45 = 0.5m@xmath46/(@xmath47 ) .",
    "here we did not account for the difference in the half - light radius among sfr , gas and stars for individual galaxies , since these three half light radii are on average quite close to each other ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .      with the advent of high spatial - resolution sfr , gas and stellar images of nearby galaxies ,",
    "the star formation law at sub - kpc scales have been studied extensively ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the general conclusion is that the relationship between sfr and total gas varies strongly both within galaxies and across different objects .",
    "this implies that the physics other than those directly related to the total gas strongly affect the sfe of the total gas .",
    "to test the idea of the sfe regulated by existing stars as proposed by the extended schmidt law , we have carried measurements of sfr , gas and stellar masses in a sample of 12 spiral galaxies as listed in table  [ samp_ind_region ] .",
    "they are derived from the hi nearby galaxy survey ( things , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the sirtf nearby galaxies survey ( sings , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    for each object ,",
    "the sfr and gas mass are measured within individual 750@xmath25750 pc@xmath48 regions across the main optical disk ( semi - major axis @xmath14 @xmath35 ) , with the technical procedure basically following @xcite ( also see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) but corrected to our imf and co - to - h@xmath6 conversion factors .",
    "the sfr is estimated from combination of galex far - uv @xcite and spitzer 24 @xmath34 m @xcite , with the 3-@xmath3 lower - limit around 10@xmath49 m@xmath16/yr / kpc@xmath48 .",
    "the gas mass is derived from a combination of things hi data @xcite and bima song co j=1 - 0 map @xcite , with the limiting surface density around 1.5 m@xmath16 pc@xmath17 .",
    "since the spatial coverage of bima song does not extend significantly beyond the hi - to - h@xmath6 transition radius where the total gas is dominated by hi emission , we have extrapolated the co data to pixels without observations based on the observed co / hi ratio as a function of semi - major axis .",
    "the result changes little if adopting the mean co / hi ratio as a function of radius derived from @xcite . for seven galaxies with significantly extended co coverage in @xcite , our derived slope of the ks law is consistent with theirs within 20% .",
    "the stellar mass is estimated based on the mass - to - light ratio at spitzer 3.6 @xmath34 m .",
    "the sings 3.6 @xmath34 m image is further subtracted by the median sky level after binning to the resolution of 750@xmath25750 pc@xmath48 , while the 3-@xmath3 sky fluctuation gives the limiting stellar mass surface density around 1 m@xmath16 pc@xmath17 . to reduce the effect of radial gradient of stellar age , extinction and metallicity on the stellar mass measurement ,",
    "the 3.6@xmath34 m mass - to - light ratio is derived based on the optical color , for which the theoretical trend is computed from our stellar population synthesis models with solar and 0.25 solar metallicity . for five galaxies with available sdss images ,",
    "the optical color is defined to be the g - r color , while the mean trend of these objects is used for the remaining objects .",
    "by treating @xmath50 as a dependent variable , and @xmath51 and @xmath1 as independent variables , we search for the best power - law exponents relating them . a linear regression fit ( idl regress.pro )",
    "gives : @xmath52 the most important result of the fit is that the derived index for @xmath1 is not zero that would be expected by the ks law .",
    "secondly , the derived exponent for @xmath53 , namely approximately unity , suggests a clear physical implication of the relation , i.e. , that the sfe ( = @xmath54 ) is related to the stellar mass surface density .",
    "we thus carry out directly the fit between sfe and @xmath55 as shown in figure  [ sfe_sbmstar](a ) through a bayesian approach to linear regression @xcite that also accounts for uncertainties in both variables .",
    "as shown in table  [ fit_result ] , the best - fit gives : @xmath56 where errors of the best - fit parameters are the intrinsic ones .",
    "the sfe-@xmath1 relation is obviously different from the ks law , although both of them could be used to predict the sfe . by invoking the stellar mass density",
    ", the sfe-@xmath55 correlation describes another scaling relation for star formation with emphasis on the role of the existing stellar component in the current star formation activity . in what follows",
    ", we refer to the relation in equation  [ eq_sfe_star ] or the sfe-@xmath1 relation as the extended schmidt law as it includes additional parameter ( stellar surface density ) .",
    "we now compare the extended schmidt law to the ks law in the ability to predict the sfe and sfr for various galaxy types as shown in figure  [ sfe_sbmstar ] and figure  [ sfr_mgasmstar ] , respectively .",
    "the main difference of the extended schmidt law from the standard ks law is to bring the lsb objects back to the relationship .",
    "while the ks law was first defined for late - type galaxies and lirgs @xcite , lsb galaxies / regions show significant deviations from it ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "the median offsets of the lsb from the best fit are -0.75 dex and -0.71 dex in figure  [ sfe_sbmstar](b ) and figure  [ sfr_mgasmstar](b ) , respectively , where the best - fit is done by excluding lsb and early - type objects due to their apparent offsets .",
    "the cause for this deviation is still unclear but is most likely related to some instabilities either gravitationally or thermally and chemically . on the other hand ,",
    "these lsb objects follow more or less the extended schmidt law with median offsets of -0.16 and -0.08 dex in two figures , respectively , where the fit is done for all objects .",
    "this is the main advantage of the extended schmidt law compared to the ks one .",
    "the observed scatter of the extended schmidt law is slightly smaller than that of the ks law ( see table  [ fit_result ] ) . for early - type galaxies",
    ", we here included objects from studies of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they follow more or less the ks law with median offsets of 0.30 dex and 0.32 dex toward higher sfe ( figure  [ sfe_sbmstar](b ) ) and sfr ( figure  [ sfr_mgasmstar](b ) ) , respectively .",
    "the objects from @xcite show slightly larger offsets than @xcite , probably due to the contribution from old stellar populations to the uv emission that has been included in their sfr measurements . as shown in figure  [ sfe_sbmstar](a ) and figure  [ sfr_mgasmstar](a ) , these early - type galaxies lie generally on the extended schmidt law with median offsets of -0.19 dex and -0.26 dex on two figures , respectively . as a summary , we found that the extended schmidt law is a universal relationship that holds for various galaxy types especially including lsb ones that do not follow the ks law .",
    "as described in   [ sample_ind_gal ] , different galaxy apertures are used for different galaxy types . as listed in table  [ tab_samp_cohi ] , their relative sizes to optical isophotal radii @xmath35 ranges from around 0.2@xmath35 for lirgs and early - type galaxies with circumnuclear star formation to 2 - 3@xmath35 for lsb galaxies with widely - distributed star formation .",
    "most of these apertures are indeed defined to enclose the majority of star formation and gas , which is consistent with the definition of star formation law that empirically describes how stars from gas . in spite of different apertures ,",
    "the extended schmidt law depends little on the aperture size as long as three quantities ( sfr , gas and stellar mass ) are measured within the same aperture which is what has been done in this study . as shown in the below , galaxies basically move along the relation without large offsets from the best - fit if different apertures are used . for 11 lsb galaxies from @xcite with available radial profiles of sfr , gas and stellar mass , we measured the relative offset in the y - axis from the best - fit compared to the aperture ( @xmath152@xmath35 ) used in figure  [ sfr_mgasmstar ] .",
    "three apertures of 0.2@xmath35 , 0.5@xmath35 and @xmath35 are tested .",
    "although they move along the relation , the median relative offsets are only -0.02 dex , 0.12 dex and 0.04 dex , respectively , where the positive sign mean offset toward higher sfrs .",
    "for 12 spiral galaxies with apertures of 1.5@xmath35 from @xcite , the median offset for 0.5@xmath35 and @xmath35 are -0.1 dex and -0.02 dex , respectively .",
    "for early - type and ulirgs , if we assume no star formation and gas outside the circumnuclear region , the median offset will be around 0.3 dex and 0.6 dex for the aperture radius of 0.5 r@xmath57 and @xmath35 , respectively , which is still with tolerance given the observed 1-@xmath3 scatter of 0.5 dex in figure  [ sfr_mgasmstar ] .",
    "overall , we have found that the extended schmidt law changes a little if the aperture radius vary several times ( 3 - 5 ) .",
    "accurate stellar mass measurements are important to the result of the extended schmidt law . to reduce systematic errors by different studies ,",
    "we have measured the masses by our own based on @xcite model for almost all objects except for 23 galaxies in @xcite for which the median offset from our method is only 0.1 dex .",
    "the @xcite model underestimates the contribution from agb stars in the near - ir and thus overestimates the near - ir mass - to - light ratio at ages around 0.1 - 3gyr .",
    "if the stellar masses are reduced by 60% for galaxies with characteristic ages defined by stellar - mass / sfr around the above range , the slope of the extended schmidt law increases only by @xmath150.01 dex .",
    "as listed in table  [ bc_model ] , we adopted exponentially declining or constant star formation history ( sfh ) .",
    "if the sfh is exponentially increasing for the high - z objects @xcite , the inferred stellar mass decreases by about 0.2 dex and the slope of the extended schmidt law only increases by 0.01 dex .",
    "we notice that the photometric coverage of lsb galaxies is generally not as good as other types .",
    "while those from @xcite is essentially based on the sdss optical photometry , the ones from @xcite are based on irac 3.6 @xmath34 m .",
    "the median offset in the stellar mass density between the two subsample is only 0.04 dex , implying that there is no significant bias in the mass estimate based only on either optical or near - ir photometry .",
    "recently @xcite published the hi - based sfe measurement for a large sample of local massive galaxies ( @xmath58 @xmath36 10@xmath59 m@xmath16 ) .",
    "they claimed an almost constant sfe ( 10@xmath60 yr@xmath21 ) in their sample for a range of log(@xmath1 ) of 2 to 3.3 m@xmath16kpc@xmath17 . the detailed comparison to our result is hampered by the lack of the h@xmath6 data of their objects , possible large uncertainties in their sfr measurements ( uv - based ones vs. our recombination - line / ir / uv based ones ) and most importantly the aperture - unmatched sfe measurements relative to those of the stellar densities measured within the half light radius ( @xmath61 ) . to estimate a rough deviation of their sample from the prediction of our relation given their median density , we assume @xmath62 @xmath31 10 within @xmath61 @xcite and @xmath63 @xmath31 50 derived from the things hi radial profile in @xcite .",
    "the resulting offset is @xmath14 0.3 dex .",

    "however , the stellar gravity can affect gas motion critically in configurations where stars show spatial and velocity differences from gas , such as stellar bars .",
    "an example of this may be seen in the numerical simulation of gas - dominated merging galaxies @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite have shown that gas - rich mergers result in disk galaxies instead of elliptical galaxies .",
    "the reason for this is not just that gas - rich mergers have too much gas to consume but also that they lack existing stars .",

    "since the physical models of star formation do not translate directly into the extended schmidt law , one is not free to interpret the latter as a causal formula suggesting that stellar gravity regulates sfe . instead , @xmath1 may be a proxy for other physical parameters or a combination thereof , signifying regulation by more subtle or complex physics .",
