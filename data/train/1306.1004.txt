    "the single spin asymmetry ( ssa ) appearing in high energy scattering process , known as a powerful tool to probe the internal structure of the nucleon , has attracted extensive attention in qcd spin physics @xcite in the past two decades .",

    ", the beam spin asymmetry was observed in sidis by colliding the longitudinal polarized electron  @xcite or positron beam  @xcite on the unpolarized nucleon target .",
    "originally , two different mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed asymmetry .",
    "one is the so called boer - mulders effect  @xcite , which suggests that the beam ssa is contributed by the convolution of the boer - mulders function @xmath8  @xcite and the fragmentation function ( ff ) @xmath9  @xcite .",

    "apart from the above - mentioned mechanisms , a new source giving rise to the beam ssa at the twist-3 level has been found through model calculations  @xcite .",
    "this mechanism involves a new twist-3 transverse momentum dependent ( tmd ) distribution function ( df ) , denoted by @xmath12  @xcite , which appears in the decomposition of the quark correlator if the dependence on the light - cone vector is included .",

    "<S> we present a study on the beam single spin asymmetries @xmath0 of @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath3 production in semi - inclusive deep inelastic scattering process , by considering collins effect and the @xmath4 term simultaneously . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate the twist-3 distributions @xmath5 and @xmath6 for the valence quarks inside the proton in a spectator model . </S>",
    "<S> we consider two different options for the form of diquark propagator , as well as two different choices for the model parameters in the calculation . </S>",
    "<S> using the model results , we estimate the beam spin asymmetries @xmath0 for the charged and neutral pions and compare the results with the measurement from the hermes collaboration . </S>",
    "<S> we also make predictions on the asymmetries at clas with a @xmath7 beam using the same model results . </S>",
    "<S> it is found that different choices for the diquark propagator will not only lead to different expressions for the distribution functions , but also result in different sizes of the asymmetries . </S>",
    "<S> our study also shows that , although the spectator model calculation can describe the asymmetries for certain pion production in some kinematic regions , it seems difficult to explain the asymmetries of pion production for all three pions in a consistent way from the current versions . </S>"
