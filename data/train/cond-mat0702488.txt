    "in a seminal paper tomonaga @xcite presented the exact solution for the long wavelength density response of a system of _ interacting _ fermions in one spatial dimension . in order to simplify the problem tomonaga studied the",
    "_ high density limit _ where the range of the interaction is much larger than the interparticle distance .",
    "then the fourier transform @xmath0 of the two - body interaction is nonzero only for values @xmath1 where the cut - off @xmath2 is much smaller than the fermi momentum @xmath3 .",
    "this implies that for not too strong interaction the ground state and the low energy excited states have negligible admixtures of holes deep in the fermi sea and particles with momenta @xmath4 .",
    "therefore tomonaga _ linearized _ the nonrelativistic quadratic dispersion in the vicinity of the two fermi points @xmath5 .",
    "he then used bloch s method of sound waves @xcite now called `` bosonization '' to obtain the ground state of the interacting system as well as its low energy excitations .",
    "as an application tomonaga calculated the density response of the ( spinless ) system in the long wavelength limit .",
    "this result was obtained before the pioneering paper by bohm and pines@xcite in which the authors introduced the `` random phase approximation '' ( rpa ) for the ( linear ) density response of the ( three - dimensional ) interacting electron gas in order to obtain e.g. the collective plasmon mode .",
    "the rpa is a good approximation in the high - density limit .",
    "various alternative derivations of this approxmation can be given @xcite , e.g. using diagramatic techniques or linearizing the time dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) equation @xcite and neglecting the exchange contribution and replacing the hf - eigenvalues by the noninteracting ones .",
    "if these additional approximations in the tdhf equation are not made the corresponding response functions are called rpae , where the `` e '' stands for exchange .",
    "while the rpa result is a simple expression in terms of the response function of the noninteracting system , the calculation of the rpae response function usually requires the solution of an integral equation.@xcite    for spin @xmath6 fermions collective modes usually occur in the charge and the spin density response .",
    "they were studied by dzyaloshinski and larkin @xcite using standard many body techniques ( avoiding bosonzation ) .",
    "they showed that for linear dispersion the exact results for the collective modes for the tomonaga model are identical to the rpa result .",
    "diagramatically this can be understood in terms of the `` closed loop theorem '' which holds if one assumes strictly linear energy dispersion around the two fermi points @xcite .",
    "recently various activities started to study the charge and spin density response when deviations from a strictly linear dispersion for one - dimensional fermions is taken into account @xcite .",
    "then the approximation using the `` bare bubble '' is no longer exact .",
    "it is one purpose of this paper to point out that the bare rpa is not even a good starting point for a perturbative calculation as e.g. it has the one - particle one - hole ( 1p-1h ) continuum in the wrong place .",
    "it is much better to use tdhf which is a conserving approximation @xcite as the starting point to calculate the damping of the collective mode(s ) .",
    "we show that it is possible to solve the rpae equation for the tomonaga model analytically when the two - body interaction @xmath7 takes a constant value for @xmath8 and is zero otherwise .",
    "this exact solution reduces to the rpa result with the noninteracting response function ( `` bubble '' ) for strictly linear energy dispersion but differs markedly for nonlinear dispersion .",
    "the continua are in different places and the dispersion of the collective modes differ .",
    "this is most drastically seen for the collective spin mode which exists in rpae but not in the bare rpa .",
    "we want to describe the density response of a system of fermions on a ring of circumference @xmath9 .",
    "the hamiltonian is given by    @xmath10    the index @xmath11 in addition to the momentum ( possibly ) includes a spin index .",
    "the first term presents the kinetic energy with the nonrelativistic dispersion @xmath12 .",
    "the two - body matrix element @xmath13 contains a factor @xmath14 due to total momentum conservation .",
    "the remaining @xmath11-dependences are specified later .    in order to study the linear charge or spin density response the heisenberg equations of motion for @xmath15 have to be solved in the presence of a time dependent external one - body potential with matrix elements @xmath16 . using the hartree - fock approximation to factorize the four fermion expectation values and linearizing the expectation values around the hf ground state @xmath17 yields @xmath18   \\langle c_k^\\dagger c_{k'}\\rangle_t & = & \\\\ \\left ( f(\\epsilon_k^{\\rm hf})-f(\\epsilon_{k'}^{\\rm hf})\\right ) [   v_{k'k}&+&\\sum_{k_2,k_4}\\bar v_{k'k_4k k_2 } \\delta   \\langle c_{k_4}^\\dagger c_{k_2}\\rangle_t ] ~ , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the hf - energies are given by @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the antisymmetrized two - body matrix elements . at @xmath21",

    "its location is given by @xmath100 which in the limit @xmath76 agrees with the result in eq .",
    "( [ linearmodes ] ) which is independent of the interaction strength for the tomonaga model with linear dispersion .",
    "the rpa spin response function @xmath101 has only a continuous non - vanishing imaginary part .",
    "this is different for the rpae result for nonlinear dispersion , where the delta spike of the spin mode is always below the hf 1p-1h continuum .    in fig .",
    "1 we show the dispersion of the modes relative to the hf - continuum for @xmath102 .    7.5 cm    the imaginary part of the rpae spin response function as a function of @xmath46 for fixed @xmath103",

    "2 , where it is compared to the result of the ( bare ) rpa result , which shows no collective mode .",
    "the weight of the rpae collective spin mode which is slightly below @xmath104 carries 94.8 per cent of the total rpae spectral weight .",

    "3 we show numerical results for @xmath112 for the spinfull model for @xmath113 .    7.5 cm    as a comparison we also show the corresponding bare rpa result . for @xmath114 the charge velocity for linear dispersion @xmath115 is larger than @xmath116 . for these @xmath117 values",
    "the rpae charge mode is above the hf 1p-1h continuum . for larger repulsive interactions @xmath118",
    "the charge velocity for linear dispersion is smaller than @xmath119 which puts the rpae charge mode below the hf 1p-1h continuum .    in the spinless model",
    "the rpae charge mode for all @xmath120 lies below the hf 1p-1h continuum .",
    "this can easily be seen by examining the denominator in eq .",
    "( [ spinless ] ) .",
    "this is qualitatively different from the rpa result which has the charge mode above the noninteracting continuum .    in an approximation beyond rpae",
    "the collective modes discussed above are expected to aquire a finite lifetime leading to a broadening of the delta peaks in the imaginary part of the response function .",
    "because the higher hf p - h continua have an additional extent for energies above the 1p-1h continuum but not below it , the damping of the collective modes will depend crucially on how they are located relative to the hf 1p-1h continuum .",
    "in this paper we have revisited the old problem of the long wavelength linear charge and spin response of interacting fermions in one spatial dimension . as there is renewed interest in the questions of the lifetime of the ideal bosonic modes of the tomonaga model due to deviations from the linear electronic dispersion@xcite we hope to have clarified the often quoted statement that `` rpa becomes exact in the long wavelength limit '' .",
    "we have shown that a naive generalizaton of this result fails badly .",
    "we have not presented a calculation for the lifetimes but only set the proper stage from where to start a perturbative approach . in order to avoid tadpole diagrams hf - propagators have to be used .",
    "the use of bare propagators is useful only for the case of linear dispersion because of the `` closed loop theorem''.@xcite    for the spinfull model and not too strong repulsive interactions the collective charge and spin modes are above respectively below the hf 1p-1h continuum . as the higher particle - hole continua for fixed @xmath121 with particle hole pairs around both fermi points are higher in energy the damping of the spin mode is expected to be quite different from the charge mode . for the spinless model and repulsive",
    "interaction the rpae charge mode is always below the 1p@xmath1221h continuum .",
    "therefore we also expect the spinfull and the spinless model to behave differently concerning the damping of the charge mode for weak repulsive interactions .",
