    "it has been shown in @xcite that asymptotically flat rotation curves , typically observed in spiral galaxies , can be reproduced by prescribing dark matter distribution of a special type .",
    "the dark matter is composed of non - interacting particles , moving along geodesic world lines , radially diverging from the center of the galaxy . in a static spherically symmetric",
    "scenario , a spatial projection of this configuration , being viewed from a large distance , looks like fig.[f1 ] left .",
    "the projection involving time and radial coordinate , shown on fig.[f1 ] right , comprises ingoing and outgoing radial flows of the dark matter .",
    "stationarity of solution implies a necessary condition of energetic balance , the flow of energy through spheres @xmath1 for ingoing and outgoing flows must coincide .",
    "equivalently , the total flow of energy must vanish , implying a condition @xmath2 on the corresponding component of energy - momentum tensor . solving this scenario in weak field approximation",
    ", @xcite obtains the rotation curves composed of a positive constant and short - range newtonian term .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to continue this consideration in the range of strong fields .",
    "concerning the composition , the study in @xcite was concentrated on tachyonic dark matter .",
    "the tachyonic models of dark matter are becoming widespread @xcite . considering a scenario proposed in @xcite ,",
    "let us introduce a supermassive elementary particle @xmath3 , decaying into two particles of normal and tachyonic type : @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "considering both vertices in the rest frame of @xmath3 , it is easy to verify that the both processes satisfy the conservation laws and are kinematically allowed . joining these processes together : @xmath6 , one obtains a process of conversion of normal matter to tachyons . due to high mass threshold",
    ", this process is suppressed at low energies and becomes active only at the energies comparable with the mass of @xmath3 .",
    "singularities of the black holes are the places where arbitrarily large energies are available , therefore they can become generators of tachyons .",
    "the event horizons surrounding the singularities are transparent for superluminal particles , thus the tachyons can leave the black holes and further can propagate along radial geodesics . at low energies they do not enter in direct interaction with normal matter and reveal their presence only by gravitational effects ,",
    "i.e. , possess the properties of astrophysical dark matter .",
    "radially diverging configuration of world lines leads to the density decreasing as @xmath7 , exactly what is necessary for reproduction of flat rotation curves .    strictly speaking",
    ", this consideration does not rule out the dark matter of normal type , consisting of massive or null particles .",
    "the condition of energetic balance can be satisfied for the flows of normal matter and for mixed flows of normal and tachyonic matter .",
    "in all these cases the computation @xcite produces asymptotically flat rotation curves .",
    "we will show in this paper that such indifference to the type of matter persists also in strong fields .",
    "the argument that tachyons go out of event horizons ( while normal matter does not ) can be countered by the fact that the considered solutions do not have event horizons . for the purpose of objectivity , we will consider all types of matter in this paper , making the distinctions among them when necessary .",
    "we will consider a static scenario , where the field configuration and ingoing and outgoing flows do not change in time .",
    "it differs from a dynamical collapse scenario , when the ingoing normal matter is once converted to outgoing tachyonic matter , which then disperses .",
    "we think about the static solution as an asymptotic state , a remnant of a real collapse , which possesses persistent ingoing and outgoing flows and lasts indefinitely . in this paper",
    "we will not consider a dynamical simulation of real collapse , which can end in such self - sustaining state .",
    "this can be an interesting topic for future work .",
    "there are also several complex and interesting questions concerning the relation of causality principle with @xmath8-invariance of the given problem . in full generality",
    "these questions were considered in the classical works by wheeler and feynman @xcite , later in @xcite and recently in @xcite .",
    "following argumentation in these papers , the direction of the world lines as well as the direction of energy - momentum vector is a matter of convention .",
    "the action of the particle , equal to the length of the world line , is invariant under reversal of its direction , as a result , all physically meaningful quantities as tensor of energy - momentum , are invariant under such reversal .",
    "the ingoing flows of matter are equivalent to the outgoing flows directed backward in time .",
    "the energetically balanced processes are equivalent to the self - compensated emission of positive energy into the future and negative energy into the past .",
    "the tachyons are kinematically different from the normal particles , in the sense that tachyon momentum is constrained by a mass shell condition @xmath9 , defining one - sheeted hyperboloid , while the normal matter corresponds to @xmath10 , two - sheeted hyperboloid , from which only the sheet @xmath11 is normally taken",
    ". therefore continuous lorentz transformations can make tachyons reversing time direction , while the momenta of normal particles remain future - directed .",
    "nevertheless , one can formally introduce past - directed normal particles , e.g. , by transferring the reagents in particle reactions to one side , from @xmath4 to @xmath12 .",
    "if one considers this vertex as a network of three world lines connected in one node , the last record means that all energy - momenta vectors directed away from the node are summed to zero , a condition coincident with the stationarity of action for this network @xcite . in this view , there is not much difference between tachyonic and normal particles , both can be considered as future - directed or past - directed , while the physical content of the theory is completely invariant under the reversal of this direction .",
    "the interpretation involving the concepts of causality and entropy is not so invariant .",
    "for example , it is easy to explain the appearance of the radially outgoing flow of matter by its creation in the center . in @xmath8-symmetric theories ,",
    "it is equally easy to explain the radially ingoing flow of matter by @xmath8-conjugation .",
    "however , it is difficult to explain the radially ingoing flow in terms of usual causal and entropic concepts .",
    "it is not clear why the ingoing flow must be directed to the center already at very large distances , where the gravitational influence of the center is negligible and there are no forces favoring this direction .",
    "the obstacle here can be a methodological asymmetry in the treatment of initial and final conditions mentioned in @xcite . while the causal reasoning is based on setting initial conditions and tracking the evolution into the future",
    ", @xmath8-symmetric problems can involve final conditions , e.g. , a point in space - time where the world line must end . in everyday experience",
    "such conditions are quite unusual , this leads to the difficulties with their interpretation . further we will rely on @xmath8-symmetry of the problem and for the discussion of causality questions forward the interested reader to the references above .    in this paper",
    "we will study the configuration shown on fig.[f1 ] , with two layers , formed by @xmath8-conjugated ingoing and outgoing flows .",
    "this configuration automatically satisfies energetic balance condition .",
    "we note , however , that energetic balance requires neither that there are only two layers nor that they are @xmath8-conjugated .",
    "in general case there can be many or even a continuous set of layers , not possessing @xmath8-symmetry , but summed to zero in energetic balance condition .",
    "here we restrict ourselves to the study of a particular set of solutions .    in sec .",

    "the models replacing central black holes in the galaxies by wormholes are becoming widespread @xcite .    while the present study focuses mainly on the question , what happens if the dark matter flows radially diverge from the center of the galaxy , the proposed extensions can answer the question , why they are doing so .",
    "the base model assumes that at normal energies the dark matter is passive and on the level of elementary particles does not interact with itself and other types of matter , except of the gravitational way .",
    "the first two extensions assume that at high energies , available only in the inner core , the dark matter starts to interact with itself and with the matter in the core . in this way",
    "the world lines of dark matter become connected to the core , i.e. , can start and end only in the core .",
    "since the black holes become sources and sinks of dark matter , at large distances the world lines of dark matter radially diverge from the black holes .",
    "the third possibility considers the world lines passing through the wormhole and then radially diverging from it . in this case",
    "the dark matter can be completely non - interactive , while its world lines become connected to the wormholes by the topology of the space - time .",
    "we have studied a static spherically symmetric problem with a black hole and @xmath8-symmetric radially directed geodesic flows of dark matter . the problem is relevant to the modeling of the galaxies .",
    "its solutions have the following structure . at large distances",
    "the gravitational acceleration decreases with a distance as @xmath155 , corresponding to flat rotation curves of the galaxies . at smaller distances the dependence switches to newtonian regime @xmath156 ,",
    "then to schwarzschild regime .",
    "the deviation from schwarzschild regime starts below the gravitational radius @xmath32 , where the dark matter prevents the creation of event horizon . instead",
    ", a region is created where the metric components @xmath157 and @xmath158 are extremely small .",
    "although the region possesses extremely large redshift and for an external observer looks completely black , the observer can enter the region and leave it in a finite time .",
    "the structure of radial geodesics implies that the solution has a single patch , where standard @xmath159 coordinates are globally applicable .",
    "the analysis of circular geodesics shows the second island of stable circular orbits present under the gravitational radius .",
    "matching of the model with parameters of the milky way galaxy allows to reconstruct the ranges of typical field behavior . below the gravitational radius",
    "the model shows principally different structure of the central black hole . at large distances",
    "the model reproduces observable asymptotically flat rotation curves , providing for them a natural explanation , which does not require a special adjustment of parameters .",
    "the model also predicts the range , where the rotation curves have almost keplerian behavior , containing the observed orbits of s0 - 2 and s0 - 102 stars .",
    "the possible extensions of the model have been discussed , including connections to the models of filaments , a hot inner core composed of interacting dark matter and a wormhole directing the dark matter to the other part of the universe .",
