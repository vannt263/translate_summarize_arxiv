    "the theory of inflation predicts the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) to be close to gaussian distributed .",
    "however , a small degree of non - gaussianity is generally present in all the inflationary scenarios .",
    "the primordial non - gaussian signal predicted by many models can be parametrized in the form : @xmath3 where @xmath4 is the primordial curvature perturbation field at the end of inflation and @xmath5 is the gaussian part of the perturbation .",
    "the dimensionless parameter @xmath6 describes the amplitude of non - gaussianity .",
    "the non - gaussian part of the primordial curvature perturbation is a local functional of the gaussian part and for this reason this kind of parametrization is often referred to as _",
    "local _ non - gaussianity .",
    "local non - gaussianity is predicted to arise from standard single - field slow - roll inflation @xcite as well as from alternative inflationary scenarios for the generation of primordial perturbations , like the curvaton @xcite or inhomogeneous ( pre)reheating models @xcite , or even from alternatives to inflation , such as ekpyrotic and cyclic models @xcite .",
    "other models , such as dbi inflation @xcite and ghost inflation @xcite , predict a different kind of primordial non - gaussianity , called `` equilateral '' , because the three point function for this kind of non - gaussianity is peaked on equilateral configurations , in which the lengths of the three wavevectors forming a triangle in fourier space are equal @xcite . in this paper",
    "we will focus only on non - gaussianity of the local type , described by equation [ eqn : primordialng ] .",
    "the interesting aspect of primordial non - gaussianity is that the expected non - gaussian amplitude @xmath7 varies significantly from model to model .",
    "putting experimental bounds on @xmath6 is then equivalent to constraining primordial scenarios of inflation .",
    "for example standard single - field slow - roll inflation predicts @xmath8 at the end of inflation @xcite ( and therefore a final value @xmath9 unity after general relativistic second - order perturbation effects are taken into account @xcite ) .",
    "such a small value is not experimentally detectable and for this reason an eventual detection of a gaussian signal in present and forthcoming cmb data will rule out single - field slow - roll inflation as a viable scenario . motivated by these considerations",
    "many groups have attempted to measure @xmath6 using cmb datasets , and wmap data in particular .",
    "a detection of non - zero @xmath0 at more than the @xmath10 level was found by @xcite using the wmap data with the kp0 galactic cut .",
    "the wmap team found similar values but stating that only the value obtained with the slightly larger kq75 galactic cut is reliable due to possible foreground residuals . in this case a value of @xmath11 was found . in both these cases ,",
    "an extended version @xcite of the @xcite ( ksw - method ) based on the full bispectrum was used .",
    "consistent results were found by @xcite and @xcite using parts of the bispectrum of spherical mexican hat wavelets @xcite and the skewness of needlet coefficients .",
    "a recent estimate has now been made by @xcite obtaining the smallest error bars on @xmath0 so far finding @xmath12 .",
    "recently , it was shown in @xcite that needlet coefficients can be used to construct statistics which are directly related to the bispectrum .",
    "these statistics share most of the useful properties of the bispectrum , while at the same time they do present important advantages , especially in terms of robustness to masked data and computational rapidity . motivated from these results , in this paper we will use the full bispectrum of needlet coefficients as an estimator of @xmath0 , introducing moreover a set of consistency tests to check the stability of our findings . in particular , we shall investigate whether changes in the estimated values of @xmath0 using different galactic cuts , different frequency bands and different multipoles are within the variations expected from simulations .",
    "of course , variations in @xmath0 among these different cases which are significantly larger than statistical fluctuations might point out the presence of foreground residuals or other systematic effects that could have biased the estimate of @xmath0 .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : data ] , we describe the data used in the analysis . then in section [ sec : method ] , the needlets and the needlet bispectrum estimator are described in detail .",
    "finally , the results on the wmap data are presented in section [ sec : results ] and conclusions are made in section [ sec : concl ] .",
    "for this analysis we used the noise weighted average of the v and w frequency band of the wmap 5 year cmb map , as well as the corresponding instrumental beam and noise properties .",
    "we have also performed the analysis on the individual q ( 41 ghz ) , v ( 61 ghz ) and w ( 94 ghz ) bands . for masking out galactic foregrounds and point sources",
    ", we used the @xmath13 and @xmath14 mask supplied by the wmap team .",
    "for particular cases , we also used the much smaller kp12 mask ( maintaining @xmath15 of the sky ) as well as an extended kq75 + mask .",
    "the kq75 + mask is constructed from the kq75 mask , extending the mask with 5 degrees along the rim , maintaining a total of @xmath16 of the sky .",
    "we have used the maps at healpix resolution @xmath17 .",
    "needlets are a new form of ( second generation ) spherical wavelets , which were introduced into functional analysis by ( @xcite ) and have attracted a lot of attention in the cosmological literature hereafter . the possibility to use needlets for the statistical analysis of spherical random fields , with a view to cmb applications ,",
    "is first discussed in @xcite , where the stochastic properties of needlet coefficients are established and their possible roles for data analysis ( spectrum estimation , gaussianity testing ) are described ; further mathematical properties where then given in @xcite . the first application to cmb data , in particular , for the analysis of cross - correlation of cmb and large scale structure data was provided by @xcite ; a general presentation of the method for a cmb audience is given in @xcite , while in @xcite the properties of different weighting schemes are investigated and compared .",
    "further papers have applied needlets on cmb data , for issues such as map - making , spectrum estimation , detection of features and anisotropies ( @xcite ) ; more recently , needlets have also been considered for the analysis of directional data , with a view to high energy cosmic rays ( @xcite ) and for the analysis of polarization data ( @xcite ) , whereas extensions to the so - called mexican needlets case are discussed by @xcite , their stochastic properties being established in@xcite .",
    "the spherical needlet ( function ) is defined as @xmath18here , @xmath19 is a direction on the sphere , and @xmath20 is the frequency ( multipole range ) of the needlet and @xmath21 is a normalizing factor .",
    "the points @xmath22 can be identified with the pixel centres in the healpix pixelization scheme .",
    "the number b defines the needlet basis such that only multipoles in the range @xmath23 $ ] are included , i.e. the function @xmath24 is zero outside this range . for details in the functional form of @xmath24 .",
    "please refer to @xcite and references therein .",
    "the advantages of needlets have already been discussed in several papers in the literature ; in short , we recall that needlets do not rely on any tangent plane approximation ; they are computationally very convenient , and inherently adapted to standard packages such as healpix ; they allow for a simple reconstruction formula ( a property which is _ not _ shared by other wavelets systems ) ; they are quasi - exponentially ( i.e. faster than any polynomial ) concentrated in pixel space . moreover ,",
    "needlets are exactly localized on a finite number of multipoles ( the width of this support is explicitly known and can be specified as an input parameter , see eq .  [ needlets_expansion ] ) ) .",
    "random needlet coefficients can be shown to be asymptotically uncorrelated ( and hence , in the gaussian case , independent ) at any fixed angular distance , when the frequency increases .",
    "this capital property is in general not shared by other wavelet systems ( see ( @xcite ) ) and can be exploited in several statistical procedures , as it allows one to treat needlet coefficients as a sample of independent and identically distributed coefficients on small scales , at least under the gaussianity assumption .    in this paper ,",
    "for notational simplicity we shall take random needlet coefficients to be @xmath25    here @xmath20 denotes the frequency of the coefficient and @xmath26 denotes the direction on the sky .",
    "we are dropping a normalizing term @xmath27 this comes at no cost , because in this paper needlet coefficients always appear after normalization with their own standard deviation , so that this deterministic factor cancels . from the notational point of view , however , this allows a major simplification , as it permits to avoid considering different weights at different frequencies @xmath28 as before , the index @xmath29 can in practice be the pixel number on the healpix grid .",
    "starting from some highly influential papers ( @xcite ) , the bispectrum has emerged in the last decade as the most promising statistics for the detection of non - gaussianity in cmb data . to fix notation ,",
    "we recall that , under the assumption of statistical isotropy for cmb radiation , we must have ( @xcite)@xmath30where on the right hand side we have introduced the wigner s 3j coefficients , which are different from zero only for configurations of @xmath31 which satisfy the triangle conditions ( see again @xcite ) . the _ unreduced bispectrum _ @xmath32 is identically zero in the gaussian case ; under non - gaussianity , it can be estimated by@xmath33it was shown by ( @xcite ) that , in the idealistic circumstance with the absence of masked regions , the bispectrum can constrain non - gaussianity very efficiently , with a signal - to - noise ratio equal to unity for @xmath0 smaller than 10 at the planck resolution . in the presence of masked regions , however , these properties deteriorate consistently ; many statistical solutions have been discussed so far , see for instance @xcite for the most recent developments .",
    "a large literature has also focussed on the determinations of the multipole configurations where the signal - to - noise ratio should be expected to be stronger , in view of a given model : see for instance @xcite and many others .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to combine ideas from the bispectrum and the needlets literature , to propose a needlet bispectrum method to test non - gaussianity and estimate the nonlinearity parameter @xmath34 more precisely , we suggest to focus on the needlet bispectrum , defined by@xmath35where @xmath36 is the standard deviation of @xmath37 the needlet bispectrum was first considered in ( @xcite ) , and we refer to that paper for more discussion and details on its mathematical properties ; the use of needlets for a non - gaussianity test is also proposed in @xcite , where the focus is instead on the skewness of the coefficients ( which can be viewed as a special case of the bispectrum , for @xmath38 .",
    "of course , many other papers had previously used wavelet - related techniques to search for non - gaussianity in cmb , see for instance @xcite .    in short , to understand the motivations of our proposals , note that , denoting by @xmath39 the cardinality of the points @xmath29 ( i.e. , the number of points in the pixelization scheme , so that @xmath40 provides an approximation for the pixel area ) , and neglecting for simplicity beam factors , we have approximately@xmath41@xmath42 @xmath43write @xmath44hence we obtain@xmath45 @xmath46from the previous computations , it should be clear that the needlets bispectrum can be viewed as a smoothed and normalized form of the standard bispectrum estimator . as usual with wavelet techniques ,",
    "the advantage is that , while the standard bispectrum is known to be heavily affected by the presence of masked regions , needlet coefficients are much more robust and consequently the needlet bispectrum makes up a more reliable statistics even for incomplete maps .",
    "furthermore , the needlet bispectrum is computationally very convenient , as it does not require the evaluation of wigner s 3j coefficients , which is extremely time - consuming .    from the mathematical point of view , further properties of the needlets bispectrum are discussed by @xcite ; in particular , it is shown that , after normalization , @xmath47 is asymptotically gaussian as the frequency increases .",
    "furthermore , it can be shown that ( under idealistic experimental circumstances ) the values of the needlet bispectrum are asymptotically independent over different frequencies , so that chi - square statistics can be suitably implemented . in @xcite , some analytic discussion on the power properties of the needlet bispectrum for a pure sachs - wolfe model were also provided , showing that its expected valued diverges to infinity at high frequencies . although those results were derived in a mathematical setting and did not take into account many features of cmb data , the simulations in the present paper show ( in a much more realistic setting ) that this procedure does have very satisfactory power properties in the presence of non - gaussianity .",
    "we will now use the needlets bispectrum for estimating @xmath0 by a @xmath48 minimization procedure .",
    "we define @xmath49 as @xmath50 where the elements @xmath51 of the data vector @xmath52 are defined as @xmath53 for all combinations of @xmath54 satisfying the triangle condition . here",
    "@xmath55 is the needlets bispectrum of the observed data and @xmath56 is the expectation value of the needlet bispectrum for a given value of @xmath0 .",
    "the correlation matrix @xmath57 is given by @xmath58 the correlation matrix is obtained from gaussian simulations . in order to avoid cumbersome numeric grid - calculations of @xmath59 , we seek an expression with a more explicit dependency of @xmath0 . in order to arrive at such an expression ,",
    "we write out again the needlets bispectrum as @xmath60 as usual , the non - gaussian @xmath61 s are assumed to be a combination of a linear ( gaussian ) and a non - linear term : @xmath62 .",
    "this allows us to write the three - point correlations in @xmath61 s as @xmath63 the non - linear terms are assumed to be small , and thus we will neglect the higher order terms , @xmath64 .",
    "we will also neglect the pure gaussian term , since the three point correlation function of a gaussian field is zero .",
    "we insert the remaining terms into eq .",
