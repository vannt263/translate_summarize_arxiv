    "dark matter and dark energy are the most fascinating astronomical puzzles presented to modern physics of particles and gravitation . to this date , the terms dm and de are descriptive terms without a clear and unique underlying physics . finding a home for dm and de in the edifice of symmetry - based physics is a challenge .",
    "although analogy is often drawn in the literature about dm , de and modified gravity ( mg ) effects , the more fundamental links of these three effects have not been systematically shown .",
    "first many mg theories are de in disguise where a special de field is allowed to be non - uniform and non - minimally coupled to the metric .",
    "the modification term enters the einstein s equation on the left or right as @xmath0,$ ] where @xmath1 is due to stress energy of known matter , e.g. , neutrinos and baryons , @xmath2 is due to the curvature tensor of the metric , and @xmath3 is due to extra fields coupled to the metric , and can equivalently viewed as the stress energy @xmath4 coming from new fields in the de sectors @xcite .",
    "second the vector , spinor or scalar in mg and de are special kinds of charge - neutral dm fields where dm particles are allowed to self - interact in pairs ( e.g. , annihilate or be created from vacuum ) , but are forbidden to interact with fields of baryons .",
    "this is because for mg and de we have @xmath5 exactly for a lagrangian construction for the de or the coupling of mg field with the metric . but",
    "@xmath6 for dm because of a very small rate of exchange of energy when dm and known matter collide .",
    "so a dm field with a small cross - section to interact with itself and with the baryons is a more general description of mg and de .",
    "third mg , de , dm fields can be described as a dark fluid with a varying equation of state in the framework of general relativity .",
    "the proper treatment involves relativistic hydrodynamics rather than cdm - like n - body simulations because dm particles are not point masses moving on geodesics , they are packets of energy or fluid which propagates according to the equation of motion of the spin field , and the generally non - trivial coupling to itself and to the metric deflects the path of dm particles from geodesics .",
    "this deflection appears as a fluid - like pressure in the stress tensor .",
    "depending on the varying sound speed of the fluid and the compton wavelength , the self - interaction can exhibit as short - range collisions by exchanging massive particles or long - range fifth force by exchanging low - energy particle @xcite or both as in context of the lensing and velocity of the bullet clusters velocity @xcite .",
    "the fluid is a mixture of de , cold , warm and hot dm etc states , and needs not be stable , can make transitions among these as the sound speed changes with position and redshift .",
    "the energy of the dark fluid is nearly conserved , and its cosmic abundance of the dark fluid is nearly fixed at decoupling with the radiations .",
    "in fact , a plausible candidate for the multi - phased dark fluid is the cosmic mixture of multi - flavored neutrinos and antineutrinos , which can make transition among at least several energy states , some very low in energy , some very high .",
    "already the uncertain low - energy physics of neutrino mass and flavor makes a plausible case for de in the mass - varying neutrino theory ( mass - varying neutrinos , mavans , by @xcite .",
    "fourth the self - interaction cross - section must be small and a running function .",
    "many theories introducing a zero or a fixed cross - section for self - interaction are excluded by data on either small scales ( e.g. , cold dm ) or large scales ( e.g. , collisional dm ) .",
    "deviations from the @xmath7cdm model must be small and gradual to preserve its success on large scale .",
    "previous multi - field models ignore the regularity of dm in galaxies and introduce more degrees of freedoms than justified by data . from the perspective of measuring weak lensing , dynamics or sne distances , astronomers detect only the bending of the space - time by the stress energy of all dark fields summed together , yet we see a cosmic  coincidence \" over @xmath8 order in length scale : everywhere a characteristic pressure exists @xmath9 .",
    "this pressure adapts to the environment satisfying a tully - fisher - milgrom - mcgaugh ( tfmm ) relation@xcite , where the cosmological constant @xmath7 is related to milgrom s @xmath10 .",
    "we expect this small pressure @xmath11  km / s@xmath12kpc@xmath13 can prevent the formation of cold dm cusps in galaxies . a possible home for mg and de in fundamental physics",
    "might well be based on low - energy self - interactions of dm , especially what give neutrino mass difference @xmath14ev@xmath15 .    for each galaxy , especially each spiral galaxy , the radial distribution of dm mass @xmath16 and baryons",
    "@xmath17 could have enjoyed a large scatter as typically seen in cdm simulations depending on formation history , but instead the two strictly follow the very tight rule of tully - fisher - mcgaugh globally and the formula of milgrom @xcite at every observable radius without significant scatter .",
    "these rules hold tightly over many orders of magnitude scatter in the gas and stellar surface brightness and a wide range of formation history , including tidal dwarfs@xcite .    on bigger scale",
    "the universe is in a state of very delicate balance , with an extremely fine - tuned ratio of the stress energy coming from the dm and de , neutrinos and baryons .",
    "these effects are all within about one order of magnitude of each other at the present instead of some 100 orders of magnitude apart if they come from truly independent physics .",
    "the way to reduce fine - tuning is to insist symmetry or restrict degrees of freedom .",
    "e.g. , these come from a common field coupling to all sectors with a cross - section comparable to that of neutrino self - coupling .",
    "an ecological view of the cosmos most - wanted pizza ( cmp ) , where different dark components ( de , cold dark matter , neutrino hot dark matter ) need not be separately conserved .",
    "they might be phases of one dark fluid .",
    "an analogy is drawn with the distribution of @xmath18 molecule on earth in phases of water - ice - vapor ; any theory with a built - in conservation of mass of ice would fail since ice melts .",
    "a pure @xmath7cdm approach would fail to capture the possibility of non - conservation of ( cold ) dark matter , and while an dynamical / ecological approach allows for the possibility of neutrino , cdm and de to be phase change into each other , and explain the coincidence of scales in these three forms of non - baryonic energies in the universe.,width=453 ]    in short we argue for a theory - independent approach to dm , de and mg .",
    "we propose to parametrize all these effects and the effects of neutrinos in terms of a chameleon - like `` dark fluid '' ( _ cdf _ ) with an approximately conserved stress energy tensor @xmath19 plus gr .",
    "it is a more systematic approach to dm interactions , since it combines the strength of previous methods using purely mond modified gravity , or warm dm , or neutrino or fifth - force .",
    "a natural way to extend @xmath7cdm is to build in the tfmm relation as the local minimum of the action of the self - interacting dm fields .",
    "if the dm - de coupling injects an uneven tiny pressure of order @xmath20 to the random motion pressure of dark matter in dwarf galaxies , this would suffice to remove the undesired dm cusps in dwarf galaxies .",
    "the general inspirations of the models are illustrated by figure .  1 , where we seek to address the coincidence problems of de , cdm / mond and hdm ( neutrinos ) by one mechanism .",
    "in the following  2 and  3 we illustrate two possible approaches to unify the treatment of dark matter and modified gravity . ",
    "4 illustrates a mathematical equivalence of these two treatments by a metric redefinition .",
    "what gives mass to active neutrinos is an open question , and it is not even clear whether the mass is constant or not . interaction with higgs - like field in other sectors or perhaps self - interactions in the neutrino sector ( perhaps with sterile neutrinos ) give an effective mass @xmath21 to the neutrinos observed ( chirially left - handed ) .",
    "this argues that the active neutrinos form a self - collisional fluid with free - streaming reduced by the pressure . since the exact mechanism of interactions are unknown , one could assume most generally that the effective mass could depend on environment .",
    "the original mavans corresponds to a neutrino fluid of pressure @xmath22 so that the neutrinos can be modeled as a nearly polytropic fluid with an imaginary sound speed in an expanding universe .",
    "more generally the neutrino pressure @xmath23 is likely some function of a scalar field and its temporal and spatial gradient , @xmath24 , where @xmath25 depends on the density @xmath26 and its rate of change and spatial gradient ( @xmath27 ) , and @xmath28 is a constant energy scale .",
    "unlike mavans , here we assume that certain species of neutrinos have zero mass in the absence of perturbations , and the effects of mass appear only in collapsed systems , like galaxies and the solar system .",
    "we assume that the cosmic fluid of neutrinos has a pressure @xmath23 due to interaction of a current vector @xmath29 of neutrinos and a current vector @xmath30 of anti - neutrinos .",
    "these two generally do not follow the same equations of motion due to their opposite spin - gravity coupling .",
    "it is possible for these two currents to interact ( creating a pressure ) in a way reminiscent of how positive and negative charged particles interact in a plasma to keep average charge - neutrality on scales larger than the spacing of particles .",
    "one expects @xmath31 , and a coupling like @xmath32 eventually reduces to terms like @xmath33 , which in galaxies reduces to terms like @xmath34 .",
    "to be specific we define @xmath35 to be the sound speed the relativistic neutrino fluid in units of the speed of light @xmath36 , and we adopt a variable sound speed such that [ pres ] = 1 = 1 + , p_g = ||^2 8 g ,  a^2 8 g n e_0 , where @xmath28 is certain fixed low - energy threshold in the neutrino sector respectively , whose microphysics is not specified in detail , but could be thought as certain energy gap in neutrinos ; note @xmath37 for the uniform universe with @xmath38 . the quantity",
    "@xmath39 carries the meaning of the ratio of gravitational wave speed @xmath36 vs the sound speed @xmath40 of the neutrino fluid , or the  refraction index \" of the neutrino fluid , which is assumed to be function of the ratio of the gravitational stress p_g = ||^2 8 g vs a characteristic stress @xmath41 of the neutrino fluid .",
    "one can motivate such a correction by saying quantum effects must be considered to model interactions of the metric with a spin 1/2 neutrino fluid in a box of debroglie wavelength @xmath42 ; when the gravitational energy inside this box is just below or above certain threshold @xmath28 , one might expect that anti - particles can disappear or appear ( reminiscent of the famous klein paradox ) , hence can change the energy density of neutrinos and anti - neutrinos , hence the sound speed of the neutrino fluid .",
    "interpreting in the picture of the the dielectric analogy of mond @xcite one would say that the neutrino medium is  polarized \" by a variable amount due to a varying gravitational stress .",
    "the adopted refraction index is such that the perturbations in the stress of the neutrino fluid propagate as the speed of light ( as in vacuum ) in strong gravity , but much slower in weak gravity ; no propagation or pressure in minkowski space , where @xmath38 . in the solar system , where @xmath43 is much bigger than @xmath44",
    ", we have @xmath45 .",
    "we consider a classical newtonian theory where one minimizes the action @xmath46 given by s & = & dt dx^3 l ,  l = _",
    "b + p_g - p , p=(n e_0 ) ^2 , where the relativistic pressure of neutrino fluid is included by a term @xmath47 , and @xmath48 is the lagrangian of gravitational field and the baryons of density field @xmath49 , which couples to gravitational potential @xmath50 .",
    "here we use the non - covariant formulation of gravity as an external field , which is the weak perturbation limit of general relativity . to be clear",
    ", @xmath51 is the scale factor , so that in the lagrangian @xmath52 we are free to add or drop terms like @xmath53 and @xmath54 , which are the total number of baryons or neutrinos respectively ; the @xmath55 here plays the role of the chemical potential .",
    "the total lagrangian now resembles the classical mond of bekenstein - milgrom @xcite = a^2 8 g ( y - f(y ) ) + _ b , where f(y ) = y ( + 1)^2 , y .",
    "apply the lagrangian equation by varying the total lagrangian with respect to @xmath50 , we obtain the mond - like poisson equation 2 = 8 g _ b , where = 1- df / dy = 1- ( 1+)^-3 = 1-(1 + || 3 a_0)^-3 .",
    "it is interesting that a relativistic neutrino fluid with a non - trivial pressure can give the physics of mond . to match with mond acceleration",
    ", we can set a =3 a_0 = 3.6 10 ^ -10m / s^2 .",
    "the resulting @xmath56 function here matches that of zhao ( 2007 ) , which are shown to be compatible with solar system data and spiral galaxy rotation curves , especially the tully - fisher - milgrom relations",
    ". the mond acceleration scale would corresponds to a mass or energy scale in the neutrino sector e_0 = 3a_0 ^ 2 8 g n ~2ev , n= 200 cm^-3 . note that any ev range neutrinos with a normal non - relativistic pressure is insignificant to galaxy potential",
    "the non - linear coupling of the neutrino pressure to the metric through some unspecified quantum effects is the key . in our picture neutrinos",
    "are not localized , this can create the effects of a ubiquitous dark matter fluid or modified gravity .",
    "the above example belongs to a more general class of variable mass theory where one minimizes the action @xmath46 given by s & = & dt dx^3 ,  l = _ f n_f m_f - m_p^2 r , where we use the natural units @xmath57 and @xmath58 , and @xmath59 is the planck mass , @xmath51 is the ricci scalar for the metric @xmath60 , and @xmath61 is the proper number density of the fermion of species @xmath62 and m_f is the fermion s effective mass , which is determined by a vector field @xmath63 by f^a s_f ( ) m_0 u^a + c_f ( ) ^a,^a u^b _ b u^a , where @xmath64 is an auxiliary field , and @xmath65 is a vector field of unit - norm in a metric @xmath66 , defined by _",

    ", we can set @xmath70 in present day galaxies , and set @xmath71 , and @xmath72 for baryons so that baryons have a fixed mass of order @xmath73 and go on geodesics of @xmath60 , and so that @xmath74 has a fixed norm in galaxies , where @xmath75 with @xmath50 being the quasi - static gravitational potential .",

    "this resembles the mond - like equation in @xcite .",
    "so @xmath78 and the auxiliary field @xmath64 and the neutrino effective mass @xmath79 all track @xmath80 or the acceleration @xmath81 with a characteristic scale @xmath82 . minimizing against the metric @xmath83 or the potential @xmath50 , we find = 4 g _ f ( n_f m_f ) , = 1- where @xmath84 .",
    "these models have properties in between that of classical mond , mavans and dark matter .    in higgs - doublet models , @xmath85 and @xmath64 are dynamical fields with a lagrangian made of following kinetic and potential terms _",

    "here we illustrate how the roles of both dm and de could be replaced by a vector field in a modified metric theory .",
    "this follows from merging two long lines of investigations pursued by kostelecky , jacobson , lim and others on consequences of symmetry - breaking in string theory , and by milgrom , bekenstein , sanders , skordis and others driven by astronomical needs @xcite .    in einstein s",
    "theory of gravity , the slightly bent metrics for a galaxy in an uniform expanding background set by the flat frw cosmology is given by @xmath96 where @xmath97 is the euclidian distance in cartesian coordinates .",
    "in the collapsed region of galaxies , the metric is quasi - static with the potential @xmath98 due to dm plus baryon , which all follow the geodesics of @xmath99 .",
    "modified gravity theories are often inspired to preserve the weak equivalence principle , i.e. , particles or small objects still go on geodesics of above physical metric independent of their chemical composition .",
    "unlike in einstein s theory , the strong equivalence principle and cpt can be violated by , e.g. , creating a preferred frame using a vector field by , e.g. , a unit time - like vector field @xmath100 which is designed to couple only to the metric but not matter directly .",
    "it does nt violate spatial rotation symmetry since it is time - like .",
    "it has a kinetic lagrangian with linear superposition of quadratic co - variant derivatives @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is constrained to be a time - like four - momentum vector per unit mass by @xmath103 the norm condition means the vector field introduces up to 3 new degrees of freedom",
    "; e.g. , a perturbation in the frw metric ( eq.[metric ] ) has @xmath104 , containing a four - vector made of an electric - like potential @xmath50 and three new magnetic - like potentials . but for spin-0 mode perturbations with a wavenumber vector @xmath105 , we can approximate @xmath106 , which contains just one degree of freedom , i.e. , the flow potential @xmath107 .",
    "we expect an initial fluctuation of @xmath108 can be sourced by a standard inflaton ; the vector field tracks the spectrum of metric perturbation .    when it comes to writing down a specific lagrangian of the vector field , simplicity is the guide since gr plus simple @xmath7cdm largely works .",
    "let s start with forming two pressure terms for any four - momentum - like field @xmath109 with a positive norm @xmath110 by @xmath111 where the rhss are co - variant with dimension of acceleration squared , and @xmath112 or @xmath113 stands for the co - variant derivative with space - time coordinates along the direction of the vector @xmath44 or the dummy index @xmath114 respectively . from these we can generate two simpler pressure terms @xmath115 and @xmath116 of the unit vector field @xmath117 by @xmath118 where the approximations hold for @xmath117 with negligible spatial components and nearly flat metric ( eq.[metric ] ) .",
    "note the @xmath116 and @xmath115 are constructed so that we can control time - like hubble expansion and space - like galaxy dynamics _",
    "separately_. the @xmath115-term , with a characteristic pressure scale @xmath119 in galaxies , is the key for our model .",
    "the @xmath116-term , meaning critical density , has a characteristic scale @xmath120 : at the epoch of recombination @xmath121 when baryons , neutrinos , and photons contribute @xmath122 respectively to the term @xmath123 ; so the epochs of equality and recombination nearly coincide .",
    "now we are ready to construct our total action @xmath124 in physical coordinates , where the lagrangian density @xmath125 where @xmath51 is the ricci scalar , @xmath126 is the ordinary matter lagrangian . for the vector field part , @xmath127 is the lagrangian multiplier for the unit norm and we propose the new lagrangian @xmath128 where the non - negative continuous functions @xmath129 , and @xmath130 , where @xmath131 . a more fine - tuned parametrization is given in zhao ( 2007 ) , which passes the bbn constraints better .",
    "taking variations of the action with respect to the metric and the vector field , we can derive the modified einstein s equation ( ee ) and the dynamical equation for the vector field .",
    "the expressions are generally tedious , but the results simplifies in the perturbation and matter - dominated regime that interest us . as anticipated in @xcite the @xmath132-cross - term of ee yields @xmath133 for all our models , which means incidentally twice as much deflection for light rays as in newtonian .",
    "the tt - equation of einstein reduces to the simple form @xmath134,~\\mbox{\\rm in galaxies } \\\\ { 8 \\pi g \\bar{\\rho } \\over 3\\mu_b } & = & h^2 - { \\lambda_0 \\over 3\\mu_b } , ~\\mbox{\\rm in matter - dominated frw } \\label{hubble}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here the pressure from the vector field creates new sources for the curvature .",
    "the term @xmath135 in the poisson equation acts as if adding dm for quasi - static galaxies .",
    "a cosmological constant in the hubble equation is created by @xmath136 _ for binary stars and the solar system _ , @xmath137 is true because the gravity at distances 0.3au to 30au from a sun - like star is much greater than the maximum vector field gradient strength @xmath138 , so @xmath139 ; in fact , @xmath140 , and the typical anomalous acceleration is @xmath141 , well - below the current detection limit of @xmath142 ( soreno & jezter 2006 ) .",
    "this might explain why most tests of non - gr effects around binary pulsars , black holes and in the solar system yield negative results ; pluto at 40 au and the pioneer satellites at 100 au might show interesting effects .",
    "extrapolating the analysis of @xcite , we expect gr - like ppn parameters and gravitational wave speeds in the inner solar system .",
    "_ near the edges of galaxies _ , we recover the non - relativistic theory of bekenstein & milgrom @xcite with a function [ mu ] ( x ) 1-_n(x ) ~_min + x ,  .",
    "note that @xmath143 hence rotation curves are asymptotically flat except for a negligible correction @xmath144 . in the intermediate regime @xmath145 our function with @xmath146 for @xmath147 respectively .",
    "galaxy rotation curves prefer a relatively sharper transition than @xmath148 at @xmath145 @xcite where we can identify @xmath149 .",
    "so our model should fit observed rotation curves .",
    "_ for the hubble expansion : _ the vector field creates cosmological constant - like term @xmath150 below the zero - point of the energy density in the solar system because the zero point of our lagrangian ( eq.[lk ] ) is chosen at @xmath151 . during matter domination ,",
    "the contribution of matter @xmath152 and @xmath153 to the hubble expansion @xmath154 ( eq.[hubble ] ) is further scaled - up because the effective gravitational constant @xmath155 .",
    "coming back to the original issue of the @xmath156 ratio of matter density to our cosmological constant , eq.([hubble ] ) predicts that @xmath157 , which is close to the desired @xmath158 ratio .",
    "adding neutrinos makes the explanation slightly poorer .",
    "so the de scale is traced back to a separate coincidence of scale , i.e. , the present baryon energy density @xmath159 , where @xmath160 contains a scale @xmath138 for the anomalous accelerations on galactic scale .",

    "the effective dm ( the dog ) follows the baryons ( the tail ) throughout the universal @xmath161 expansion with a ratio set by the parameter @xmath162 . to fit the @xmath7cdm - like expansion exactly",

    "finally we illustrate the relation between modified gravity and interacting dark matter .",
    "let s consider einsteinian gravity but with the normal matter ( of standard model of particle physics ) being coupled to the field of a dark matter particle .",

    "<S> modern astronomical data on galaxy and cosmological scales have revealed powerfully the existence of certain dark sectors of fundamental physics , i.e. , existence of particles and fields outside the standard models and inaccessible by current experiments . </S>",

    "<S> we argue that these ad hoc divisions of sectors miss important clues from the data . </S>",
