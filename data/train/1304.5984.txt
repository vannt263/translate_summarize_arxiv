    "@xcite was the pioneer in using star clusters as tracers of the galactic structure .",
    "since then , several works have used open clusters ( ocs ) as probes to trace the structure and understand the dynamics of our galaxy , especially the disk @xcite .",
    "given the importance of ocs to increase our knowledge of the galaxy , numerous efforts have been made to expand the oc sample and improve the accuracy of the derived parameters .",
    "on the observational point of view , several catalogues and surveys were compiled @xcite . in this sense , we have contributed significantly to increase the number of clusters with parameters derived towards the galactic anticentre ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* - thereafter papers i , ii , and iii ) .    to improve the accuracy of the cluster parameters , our group has developed a series of tools and procedures @xcite . in particular , a field decontamination algorithm ( sect .  [ sec:3 ] ) that is essential to better determine the cluster members and differentiate physical systems from field fluctuations , mainly in the analysis of poorly populated objects , those in crowded fields or embedded in nebulae @xcite .    in the present work",
    "we investigate the nature of some subsamples of star cluster candidates . in the first one , we test the nature of cluster candidates towards the galactic anticentre , in the sector @xmath1 .",
    "ten of them are ngc cluster candidates .",
    "these objects have recently been included in a catalogue of overlooked ngc ocs @xcite .",
    "we employ a field decontamination procedure to uncover the intrinsic cluster cmds .",
    "another subsample is candidate clusters from @xcite .",
    "we also analyse some interesting objects outside the anticentre region .",
    "in addition , we provide new clusters discovered by ourselves ( cbb 10 to cbb 16 ) following the cbb series ( papers ii and iii ) .",
    "the search for new clusters are made by eye on wise , 2mass , and xdss images .",
    "then , we condensed our recent contributions to the anticentre clusters into a catalogue ( papers i , ii , and iii ) . using this catalogue",
    "we investigate properties of both anticentre clusters and the 2nd and 3rd quadrants .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] we present the 2mass photometry and describe the methods and tools employed in the cmd analyses , especially the field star decontamination algorithm . sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] is dedicated to the discussion of the methods and tools used for the analysis of the cluster structure . in sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] we present the results of the analyses of cluster candidates , and derive astrophysical parameters ( _ age , reddening , distance , core and cluster radii _ ) of the confirmed ocs . in sect .",
    "[ sec:7 ] we discuss the results . finally , in sect .",
    "[ sec:8 ] we provide the concluding remarks .",
    "we analyse the cluster candidates with 2mass photometry @xcite in the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 bands , extracted in circular concentric regions centred on the coordinates given in table  [ tab4 ] using vizier .",
    "large extraction areas are essential for a consistent field star decontamination ( sect .",
    "[ sec:3.1 ] ) and to obtain rdps ( sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] ) with a high contrast relative to the background .",
    "in addition , 2mass provides an all - sky coverage with the spatial and photometric uniformity required for high star - count statistics . as a photometric quality constraint ,",
    "the 2mass extractions were restricted to stars with errors in @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 smaller than @xmath5 mag .",
    "the extraction radius was chosen by visual inspetion on the wise image and taking into account the rdp , in the sense that the profile must become relatively stable in the outer region .",
    "the wide extraction area is needed to provide the required statistics , in terms of magnitude and colours , for a consistent field star decontamination .",
    "there is evident contamination by field stars in the observed cmds of the present cluster candidates .",
    "therefore , we applied the field - star decontamination procedure given by @xcite to uncover the intrinsic cmd morphology from the foreground / background stars .",
    "the decontamination algorithm is described in detail in @xcite and @xcite , therefore we provide a brief description .",
    "the tool divides the cmd into a 3d grid of cells with axes along the @xmath2 magnitude and the ( @xmath6 ) and ( @xmath7 ) colours , computing the expected number - density of field stars in a given cell based on the number of comparison field stars with magnitude and colours compatible with those of the cell .",
    "subsequently , it subtracts the expected number of field stars from each cell .",
    "typical cell dimensions are @xmath8 , and @xmath9 , which are large enough to allow sufficient star - count statistics in individual cells and small enough to maintain the morphology of the cmd evolutionary sequences .    the comparison field used in the decontamination procedure",
    "is chosen by considering the field in the cluster neighbourhood .",
    "in general , large field areas are required to ensure statistical representativeness of field stars .",
    "the decontamination constraints more the parameters derived , especially for low - latitude ocs and ecs .",
    "we argue that it is not an easy task to establish the nature of faint objects and/or those in crowded field , thus the field star decontamination algorithm plays an important role in disentangling physical cmd sequences from field fluctuations .",
    "we estimate the fundamental parameters using the decontaminated cmd morphology fitted by eye with padova isochrones @xcite .",
    "the derived parameters are the observed distance modulus @xmath10 and reddening @xmath11 , which converts to @xmath12 and @xmath13 with the relations @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "we assume a constant total - to - selective absorption ratio @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "the analysis is based on both cmds , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , but for brevity we show only one of them for most objects . for clusters presenting stars with ir - excess",
    "we provide @xmath21 cmds .",
    "decontaminated cmds are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:1 ] to [ fig:09 ] .",
    "the parameter errors have been estimated by displacing the best - fitting isochrone in colour and magnitude to the limiting point where the fit remains acceptable .",
