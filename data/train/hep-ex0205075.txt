    "while a number of previous solar neutrino experiments  @xcite have measured a smaller neutrino interaction rate than that predicted by the standard solar model ( ssm ) @xcite , in 1996 super - kamiokande ( sk ) began collecting data of unprecedented precision and quantity .",
    "in addition to a reduced interaction rate of solar @xmath0b neutrinos ( originating from @xmath8 decay of @xmath0b nuclei ) with electrons in the detector , sk measured with high precision the spectrum of the recoiling electrons as well as time variations of this reduced rate  @xcite .",
    "neutrino flavor oscillations are able to explain all observed solar neutrino interaction rates , including the rate difference between sk and sno  @xcite .",
    "the large neutrino flavor mixing between the second and third generation inferred from atmospheric neutrino data  @xcite in conjunction with the absence of an oscillation signal in the chooz reactor neutrino experiment  @xcite ( which is sensitive to oscillations in a similar region of mass square difference ) requires the neutrino flavor mixing between the first and third generation to be small .",
    "solar neutrino oscillations can therefore be approximated by a two - neutrino description with the parameters @xmath5 ( mixing angle ) and @xmath1 ( difference in mass square ) .",
    "the mass eigenstate @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is chosen to have the smaller ( bigger ) mass .",
    "( @xmath10 ) which has the larger coupling to electrons ( muons ) . in that case ,",
    "@xmath5 ranges between 0 and @xmath11 and @xmath1 might be negative .",
    "the oscillation probability remains invariant under the transformation @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "] therefore , @xmath14 is always positive and the mixing angle ranges between 0 and @xmath15 . for @xmath1 between @xmath16ev@xmath4 and @xmath17ev@xmath4 , matter densities in the sun and the earth can strongly affect the oscillation probability .",
    "consequently , the symmetry of the vacuum oscillation probability around @xmath18 is broken .",
    "for @xmath19 , resonant enhancement of the oscillations ( msw effect  @xcite ) can occur in the sun , while for @xmath20 , an anti - resonance can suppress the oscillations .",
    "since matter - dominated solutions usually do nt occur for @xmath20 , we have not shown this `` dark side '' of the parameter space in previous reports .",
    "below @xmath21ev@xmath4 , the oscillation probability is more affected by the oscillation phase than by matter effects .",
    "a logarithmic scale of the variable @xmath22 illustrates the mirror symmetry of the vacuum region ( below @xmath23ev@xmath4 ) at the maximal mixing line .",
    "figure  [ fig : singleexp ] ( a ) shows the experimentally allowed areas using various measurements .",
    "in addition to the suppression of the @xmath24 rates , neutrino oscillations also produce other neutrino flavors .",
    "furthermore , they can induce distortions of the neutrino spectrum and time variations of the solar neutrino fluxes . in the msw region ,",
    "the time variations arise from matter effects inside the earth ( daily variations ) . in the vacuum regions ,",
    "the time variations are the consequence of the change of the oscillation phase due to the yearly variation of the oscillation baseline ",
    "the distance between the sun and the earth .        in this paper",
    "we report on the new sk data set of 1496 days , which represents the completion of the analysis of all the data from super - kamiokande - i .",
    "previous sk energy spectrum and time - variation measurements ruled out large regions of the oscillation parameter space allowed by other experiments  @xcite . when combined with the ssm , these measurements also restricted @xmath22 to be bigger than @xmath250.2 disfavored oscillation to a sterile neutrino .",
    "our final data set confirms our previous measurements and further constrains the range of possible oscillation parameters .",
    "even stronger constraints can be obtained by combining sk results with the rate measurements of other experiments . in particular , the combination of sno s measurement of the solar @xmath0b @xmath24 interaction rate  @xcite with the sk rate yields additional information  @xcite about @xmath0b flavor conversion , since sk also has sensitivity to other active neutrino flavors .",
    "if the @xmath24 survival probability is moderately small for @xmath0b neutrinos ( less than about 50% ) then sk can observe a significant excess due to the presence of other active species in its precise measurement of the elastic scattering rate .",
    "a similar signature can be observed in the combination of sk and the homestake rate . in this case , however , the lower energy threshold of homestake and its resulting sensitivity to other than @xmath0b neutrinos lead to an ambiguity between spectral distortion and appearance signatures and therefore to a larger uncertainty in the observed excess .",
    "without sk data , the strongest constraint of the parameters is a @xmath26 fit to the charged - current neutrino rates from gallex / gno , sage ( combined into a single `` gallium '' rate ) , homestake ( `` chlorine '' ) and sno experiments  @xcite .",
    "the light gray areas of figure  [ fig : singleexp ] ( b ) use only these three rates and their ssm - based predictions .",
    "the regions can be understood as the `` overlap '' of the three allowed regions of figure  [ fig : singleexp ] ( a ) . above @xmath27ev@xmath4 near @xmath28 ( maximal mixing )",
    "all three regions meet and form the large mixing angle ( lma ) solution . the small mixing angle solution ( sma )",
    "is the `` crossing point '' of the gallium region and the chlorine region and lies between @xmath29ev@xmath4 and @xmath30ev@xmath4 at @xmath31 .",
    "the low solution is the large @xmath1 part of the extensive region(s ) between @xmath32ev@xmath4 and @xmath21ev@xmath4 , while the lower part of this region is called the quasi - vacuum ( quasi - vac ) solution .",
    "finally , the vacuum solutions ( vac ) are found below @xmath33ev@xmath4 .",
    "all regions have similar @xmath26 ( though the low fits are slightly worse with @xmath34 ) .",

    "here we utilize the zenith angle spectrum from the entire sk - i data set collected between may 31st , 1996 and july 15th , 2001 ( 1496 live days ) .",
    "the numerical results are listed in tables  [ tab : zenspec ] and [ tab : zenspec2 ] .",
    "there is no indication of spectral distortion , the @xmath26 to an undistorted spectrum is 4.6 for 7 degrees of freedom ( 71% c.l . ) .",
    "no significant daily variation is found , the day / night rate asymmetry is @xmath630.020(stat)@xmath64(syst ) .",
    "the gray excluded regions of figure  [ fig : sk ] ( a ) are the result of the zenith angle spectrum fit .",
    "the sma and vac regions are excluded since they require a distorted @xmath0b neutrino spectrum .",
    "the lower part of the lma and the upper part of the low solution predict daily variations and are therefore disfavored .",
    "the excluded areas are independent of the ssm neutrino fluxes . while the sk zenith angle spectrum shape is best described by quasi - vac solutions , lma fits have similar @xmath26 .    since there is no indication of a distortion of the sk zenith spectrum , an analysis of the zenith spectrum shape alone can only yield excluded regions .",
    "however , if the @xmath0b flux is known , the sk rate can be predicted .",
    "then , the zenith spectrum shape can be combined with the sk rate into a single measurement .",
    "figure  [ fig : sk](b ) shows the allowed regions using sk rate and zenith angle spectrum in combination with the @xmath0b flux prediction and uncertainty of the ssm . unlike other experiments , whose allowed",
    "areas are shown in figure  [ fig : singleexp ] ( a ) , sk allows only large mixing at 95% c.l , and there are two allowed regions : the lma and quasi - vac solution .",
    "a comparison between the sk rate and sno s charged - current rate  @xcite yields another @xmath0b flux constraint which is independent of the ssm , so a combination of the sk rate and zenith angle spectrum with the sno charged - current rate need not rely on any neutrino flux prediction  @xcite .",
    "the sk rate of @xmath65ssm ( see table  [ tab : zenspec ] ) exceeds the sno charged - current rate  @xcite of @xmath66ssm , by about @xmath67 .",
    "if this is interpreted as an appearance signal of other active neutrino flavors , these flavors contribute about 25% to the sk rate and 70% to the @xmath0b flux ( the @xmath68 elastic scattering cross section for the other flavors is six to seven times smaller than for @xmath24 ) . as a consequence of this appearance signal , the two allowed regions ( dashed - dotted lines ) of figure  [ fig : global ] ( a ) result from a combined fit : a lma and a quasi - vac solution .",
    "if the sno neutral - current rate is used as well , the quasi - vac solutions are disfavored as seen in figure  [ fig : global ] ( a ) ( gray shaded areas ) .    to constrain the quasi - vac region below the low solution",
    ", it is necessary to add the gallium  @xcite ( @xmath69  snu or @xmath70ssm ) and chlorine rates  @xcite ( @xmath71  snu or @xmath72ssm ) to the fit .",
    "such a global fit is still not influenced by the @xmath0b and _ hep _ neutrino ( arising from @xmath73he@xmath74p@xmath75he+e@xmath76+@xmath24 ) flux predictions of the ssm , which suffer from the largest uncertainties .",
    "however , it relies on the other ssm neutrino fluxes , in particular the @xmath77be flux ( 10% uncertainty ) and the neutrino fluxes of the cno cycle ( @xmath78 uncertainty ) .",
    "those fluxes contribute  @xcite about 15% ( @xmath77be ) and 6% ( cno ) to the chlorine rate and 27% ( @xmath77be ) and 7% ( cno ) to the gallium rate in the ssm .",
    "the allowed areas of this global fit shown in figure  [ fig : global ] ( b ) looks quite different when compared with the fit without sk data displayed in figure  [ fig : singleexp ] ( b ) : only the upper part of the lma survives .",
    "table  [ tab : solution ] compares the four smallest local minima of the @xmath26 describing the global fit .",
    "the best fit is located in the upper lma area .",
    "the @xmath0b flux resulting from this fit is somewhat higher than expected by the ssm ( @xmath79@xmath80s ) but well within the uncertainty .",
    "the _ hep _",
    "flux is considerably higher than expected by the ssm ( @xmath81@xmath80s ) ; however , the uncertainty of this prediction is thought to be very large .",
    "the fit agrees with the sk zenith angle spectrum moderately well and easily accommodates the gallium , sk and sno rates , though the predicted chlorine rate is about @xmath82 too high .",
    "this worsens the otherwise very good best fit @xmath26 .",
    "b flux calculation .",
    "the dashed - dotted lines include all experimental information , while the dashed ( no sno rates ) and dotted lines ( no radio - chemical rate measurements ) do not . , height=294 ]",
    "the quasi - vac solution describes the sk zenith angle spectrum slightly better than the lma does , however , the rates do not fit well .",
    "the resulting best fit @xmath0b flux falls @xmath83 short of the ssm prediction .",
    "the surviving ( at 99% c.l . ) low solution fits the rates about as poorly as the quasi - vac solution .",
    "the sk zenith angle spectrum fits low worse than it does either lma or quasi - vac .",
    "the lack of zenith angle variation in the sk data reduces the @xmath1 ( usually around @xmath84ev@xmath4 ) and worsens the low best fit which is already under pressure from the rates .    at around the @xmath85 level",
    "a small mixing angle solution appears .",
    "the mixing angle is about a factor of four smaller than the usual sma . for",
    "any given @xmath0b flux , such a small mixing angle region can be defined by the crossing of the gallium and the chlorine allowed areas ; those two rates therefore automatically fit very well . in case of the classic sma ,",
    "the sk spectral data lack the predicted distortion . as a consequence ,",
    "the region gets shifted towards smaller mixing , and even then the sk zenith angle spectrum considerably ( about 3.5 @xmath86 ) disfavors this fit . due to the reduced mixing angle , the predicted sno charged - current rate is more than @xmath82 above the measurement .",
