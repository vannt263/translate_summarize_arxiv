    "the formation of planets is one of the most complex problems in astrophysics , involving accumulation of bodies over some @xmath2 orders of magnitude in mass  from dust grains to giant planets .",
    "one issue which has received a lot of attention is the formation of planetary embryos by the accretion of planetesimals . from the perspective of dynamics we call an object an embryo when it becomes so massive that one can no longer describe its behavior by means of simple kinetic theory ( in this paper we use names embryo , protoplanet and massive body interchangeably ) . in other words , in the presence of embryos the multiparticle distribution function can not be taken as a product of one - particle distribution functions ; the gravitational influence of the embryo is strong enough to affect the distribution of planetesimals with which it interacts .",
    "for example , a gap could form around the embryo . to study properties of systems containing embryos",
    "one must either resort to n - body simulations or try to account properly for their influence on the underlying planetesimal population and on each other .    in the standard scenario ,",
    "protoplanets grow in orderly ( safronov , 1972 ) or runaway fashion ( wetherill & stewart , 1989 ; wetherill & stewart , 1993 ) by accreting planetesimals from the protoplanetary nebula .",
    "after the largest bodies become embryos , they open gaps and accretion slows or stops .",
    "thereafter these massive bodies evolve more slowly as gravitational encounters perturb them into crossing orbits and violent impacts occur , thus gradually forming more massive objects .",
    "it is a common belief now that the earth - type planets and rocky cores of the giant planets were formed by this two - stage process .",
    "the question which is not very often addressed is where the boundary between these two stages occurs .",
    "this is an important issue , because the answer tells us the final mass of the objects which further evolve through chaotic collisional evolution , as well as the number of such bodies , and the conditions for which statistical treatments of collisional evolution are valid .    the standard paradigm for determining the embryo mass ( lissauer , 1987 ; weidenschilling et al .",
    "1997 ) presumes that planetary growth stops when the embryo `` eats up '' all the planetesimals within a `` feeding zone ''  an annulus of radial width of one hill radius . here",
    "the hill radius is defined as @xmath3 with @xmath4 being the distance between the massive body with mass @xmath5 and the central star with mass @xmath6 .",
    "if the surface mass density of planetesimals is @xmath7 , then this `` isolation mass '' is @xmath8 , which means that @xmath9 the estimate of @xmath10 is made for @xmath0 au and is based on standard assumptions for the protosolar nebula : @xmath11 g @xmath12 , implying that @xmath13 per cent of the minimum mass solar nebula is contained in solids ( hayashi 1981 ) .",
    "the usual assumption is that before the mass of the largest protoplanet reaches @xmath14 , the distribution of planetesimals is basically homogeneous . in some cases",
    "this is not a reasonable assumption . in particular",
    "ida & makino ( 1993 ) demonstrated using n - body simulations that a protoplanet could scatter planetesimals strongly if it is massive enough and , thus , clear a zone around it which is free from any solid bodies .",
    "the mass required to clear a gap in this way is not simply related to @xmath14 .",
    "kokubo & ida ( 1998 ) later emphasized the importance of rapid heating of the planetesimal population by the forming planet in slowing down the subsequent accretion of planetesimals .",
    "the process of clearing a gap in the planetesimal disk around a massive body is analogous to gap formation in gaseous disks ( takeuchi et al .",
    "1996 ) , which results from a competition between viscous spreading of the disk and gravitational interactions with the protoplanet . in a planetesimal disk",
    "the role of viscosity is played by mutual scattering of planetesimals .",
    "one can easily estimate the planetary embryo mass determined by this process .",
    "let us assume that the planetesimal random velocities are small  the disk is cold .",
    "let @xmath15 be the orbital angular velocity .",
    "if @xmath16 is the mass of each of two planetesimal and @xmath17 is the corresponding hill radius , then the typical displacement in a close encounter of these planetesimals on circular orbits separated by @xmath18 is @xmath19 , and the typical random velocity kick is @xmath20 .",
    "similarly , planetesimals within @xmath21 from the massive object get kicked by @xmath22 with frequency @xmath23 ( the inverse of the synodic period ) . if they are not able to diffuse back this distance during the time interval between kicks by the embryo , then a gap forms .",
    "the `` viscous '' spreading distance is @xmath24 during one synodic period , where @xmath25 is the number of collisions of a given small body with other planetesimals between consecutive approaches to the massive body . assuming that the thickness of the planetesimal disk is @xmath19",
    ", one can easily see that @xmath26 .",
    "this implies that a gap in the planetesimal disk opens when @xmath27 , or when @xmath28 or , alternatively , when @xmath29 here @xmath30 is a dimensionless function characterizing the effect of the planetesimal velocity dispersion @xmath31 ; we expect @xmath32 for @xmath33 and @xmath34 for @xmath35 ( see  [ randmot ] )",
    ". if the mass given by equation ( [ critestim ] ) is smaller than the isolation mass given by equation ( [ isol ] ) , the accretion stops because the protoplanet forms a gap , rather than because it consumes all the bodies in its feeding zone .",
    "assuming typical values for protoplanetary disks one can get @xmath36 it is obvious from this estimate that gap formation could be very important in slowing down planetary accretion .",
    "in this paper we analytically study the process of clearing a gap around a massive body in a planetesimal disk .",
    "we use an approach to treating the surface density evolution that was first developed by petit & hnon in their seminal series of papers ( 1987a , 1987b , hereafter ph , 1988 ) . in  [ equations ] and appendix [ ap1 ]",
    "we derive a generalized form of their evolution equation , including the fluxes produced by the protoplanet and those generated by mutual gravitational perturbations between the planetesimals of the swarm .    in  [ res ] we describe the solutions of the evolution equations for cold planetesimal disks , and compare our results with those obtained using n - body simulations .",
    "we comment on the applicability of our findings to the planet formation in the early solar system , and describe briefly the relation between the surface density and planetesimal velocity dispersion evolution in  [ disc ] .",
    "all the following calculations assume a keplerian disk , although they could be easily extended to the case of an arbitrary rotation law .",
    "we consider a disk of bodies ( we will refer to them as planetesimals , but these could be other bodies , such as planetary ring particles ) with @xmath37 being the surface number density of particles with mass between @xmath38 and @xmath39 , whose guiding centers move at a distance @xmath40 from the central body .",
    "it is important to keep in mind that @xmath40 is the guiding center radius rather than the instantaneous radius .",
    "the instantaneous surface number density can only be obtained if @xmath41 is supplemented by the random velocity distribution of planetesimals .",
    "we also assume that a single massive body with mass @xmath5 moves on a circular orbit in this planetesimal swarm ( we take orbit to have a fixed radius and we comment later on the effects of migration ) and we assume that its mass is much larger than the masses of the individual swarm particles .",
    "the mass of the central body is @xmath6 and the distance of the planet from the central body is @xmath4 .",
    "we will also use the relative masses of the bodies with respect to @xmath6 : @xmath42 for the planet and @xmath43 for the planetesimals with mass @xmath38 .",
    "the interactions between particles in the gravitational field of a central body are described by hill s equations , which are valid in the limit @xmath44 , which is always true in problems which we will study .",
    "it was demonstrated by hnon & petit ( 1986 ) that in this case the motion of nearby gravitationally interacting particles can be separated into center - of - mass motion , which is invariant during the interaction , and relative motion .",
    "if one defines new dimensionless coordinates where all the distances and relative velocities are normalized by @xmath45 , then the equations of relative motion of particles 1 and 2 do not depend on their masses in these coordinates .",
    "let us set @xmath46 to be the distance between the guiding centers of interacting particles in these coordinates and @xmath47 to be the probability of having a change in @xmath46 in the range @xmath48 in an encounter .",
    "then @xmath49 does not depend upon the masses of particles involved in a collision , but does depend on the random velocity distribution function of the planetesimals .",
    "in appendix [ ap1 ] we derive the general equation of the surface density evolution , which in many aspects parallels the derivation of equation ( 44 ) in ph .",
    "let us set @xmath50 .",
    "let @xmath51 be the function determining the local shear , @xmath52 for a keplerian rotation law .",

    "this differs from the equation derived in ph because it does not assume that surface density varies slowly on scales of the order of the hill radius .",
    "if we made this assumption and expanded @xmath55 up to the second order in @xmath46 locally we would reduce equation ( [ geneq ] ) to the one derived in ph , equation ( 44 ) , which we reproduce here : @xmath56 . \\label{ph}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath57 and @xmath58 are dimensionless moments of the probability distribution @xmath49 : @xmath59 and symmetry dictates that @xmath60    for a cold disk it was demonstrated by ph that @xmath61    we can now easily include the effect of a massive body on the surface density evolution . to do this we take surface density to consist of two parts : one representing a continuous distribution of small masses , corresponding to planetesimals , and another arising from the massive body .",
    "one can write the contribution from the embryo in the following form : @xmath62 we neglect migration of the embryo , so we assume @xmath4 is fixed .    substituting ( [ formdistr ] ) into ( [ geneq ] ) and assuming that the embryo is much more massive than any of the planetesimals , @xmath63 , we get @xmath64\\nonumber \\\\-\\left .",

    "planetesimals can get kicks when interacting with the massive body which change their guiding centers by @xmath22 . at the same time",
    "mutual interactions between the planetesimals are unable to produce such large displacements ( since @xmath65 ) .",
    "one can thus assume that for planetesimal - planetesimal interactions the surface density varies only slowly on the scale @xmath66 , and locally expand the first part of the r.h.s .",
    "of equation ( [ geneq ] ) in a taylor series in @xmath46 , as was done in equation ( [ ph ] ) . at the same time the second part of the r.h.s .",

    "we also make some additional changes : we move the origin of @xmath40 to @xmath4 ( simply set @xmath67 ) and switch from @xmath68 to a dimensionless distance from the planetary embryo @xmath69 .",

    "the constituent bodies of planetesimal disks are likely to have quite a broad range of masses .",
    "however , right now we are going to concentrate on the simple case of single mass planetesimals , that is we assume all planetesimals to have a unique mass @xmath16 .",

    "we obtain using ( [ ivalues ] ) that @xmath83 and , thus , @xmath84    for a hot disk ( @xmath85 ) one has [ see the discussion after equation ( [ i ] ) in  [ randmot ] ] @xmath86 it is assumed here that the ratio of vertical to radial random velocity dispersions in a planetesimal disk is equal to @xmath87 . using ( [ ihot ] ) one finds that @xmath88 in the intermediate regime , when @xmath89",
    ", there is no analytic expression for @xmath90 and one has to interpolate between the two asymptotic behaviors given by ( [ icold ] ) and ( [ ihot ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath81 quantifies the influence of the planetary perturbations on the uniformity of the planetesimal disk . the first term on the r.h.s . of ( [ 1pop ] )",
    "describes the nonlinear diffusion of particles due to mutual gravitational scattering , and tends to iron out any initial inhomogeneities .",
    "the second term represents the effect of the planet , which tends to carve out a gap in the distribution of planetesimals .",
    "the steady state originates when these two effects balance each other .    when the protoplanetary mass is large , @xmath81 is also large and the expression in brackets dominates the evolution .",
    "it leads to gap formation . on the contrary",
    ", if the planetary mass is small we can neglect the corresponding term in the r.h.s . of ( [ 1pop ] ) and obtain a nonlinear diffusion equation , which drives the planetesimal distribution towards a homogeneous state .",
    "so , one can say that a gap ( or at least a significant depression in the surface density of the planetesimals ) is formed when @xmath91 . from equations",
    "( [ 1pop ] ) - ( [ crit ] ) one can derive the characteristic time required for a gap to form when @xmath91 : @xmath92 where @xmath93 is the orbital period of the embryo .",
    "note that @xmath94 is approximately the synodic period of a body at @xmath21 from the embryo and , thus , is independent of the planetesimal mass @xmath16 , the surface density @xmath95 , and the numerical factor @xmath90 .",
    "in  [ res ] we confirm these arguments by solving equation ( [ 1pop ] ) numerically .",
    "we solved equation ( [ 1pop ] ) in a simplified setting , in which we completely neglect the velocity evolution of the planetesimal population .",
    "thus , we assume the integral @xmath90 embodying all the kinetic properties of planetesimals to be fixed in time . for simplicity we set @xmath96 ; this only affects the timescale of the gap formation by a constant factor and does not change the evolution at all .",
    "we also assume that planetesimals have very small random motion on the scale of the embryo s hill radius : @xmath97 .",
    "this simplifies our treatment a lot , because in this case scattering is deterministic so that @xmath98 .",
    "the behavior of the function @xmath99 which gives the final semimajor axis difference as a function of the initial difference was described in detail by ph . for the sake of convenience",
    "we reproduce this dependence in appendix [ ap2 ] .",
    "also , in this approximation , the instantaneous surface number density is given simply by @xmath100 , because the guiding center and instantaneous radii coincide .",
    "the assumption of a cold disk might be reasonable in cases such as the early stages of gap clearing in a planetesimal disk , when scattering by the embryo could be in the shear - dominated regime , or all the time in dense planetary rings ( petit & hnon 1987a ) .",
    "we solved equation ( [ 1pop ] ) with periodic boundary conditions , simply assuming that @xmath101 at @xmath102 .",
    "the functional form of @xmath49 is given by equation ( [ phscat ] ) .",
    "we usually assume @xmath103 here ( in units of the hill radius of planet ) and take the initial surface number density to be constant : @xmath104 .    in figure",
    "[ fig : evolution ] we show the evolution of the surface density with time [ we use the dimensionless time @xmath78 given by equation ( [ taudef ] ) ] for @xmath105 and @xmath106 . in the first case",
    "a gap is never actually formed and in the steady state there is only a density depression around the planet .",
    "thus the particles can be still accreted by the protoplanet , but the efficiency of this process is reduced .    in the case @xmath107 the gap is formed very quickly , which is in general agreement with the expected timescale for gap formation ( @xmath108 in this case ) , although it takes some time after that for the density distribution to settle to a steady state .    in both cases",
    "one should notice a bump inside the gap which decays with time .",
    "it corresponds to the horseshoe orbits in the immediate vicinity of an embryo .",
    "this is in agreement with monte - carlo and n - body simulations performed earlier ( petit & hnon , 1988 ; tanaka & ida , 1997 ; spahn & sremevi 2000 ) .    in figure",
    "[ fig : steadystate ] we show the final state of the surface density for several values of @xmath81 , so that one can see that gap gets deeper and wider as @xmath81 increases .",
    "it also looks like the condition @xmath105 is a reasonable approximate criterion for gap formation .",
    "we may compare our analytical results from equation ( [ crit ] ) with n - body simulations by ida & makino ( 1993 , hereafter im93 ) and tanaka & ida ( 1997 , hereafter ti97 ) .",
    "figure 3 of im93 and figure 1 of ti97 show well developed gaps in a gas - free planetesimal disk .",
    "the gaps seen in n - body simulations are never clean because random motion of planetesimals is naturally included , and this permits some of them to be present in the gap .",
    "the parameters used in the production of these figures correspond to @xmath109 in the first case while in the second @xmath110 . in both cases",
    "the velocity dispersion of planetesimals is large ( @xmath111 ) and we expect @xmath112 ( see  [ randmot ] ) , meaning that @xmath113 and the condition for gap formation in the distribution of guiding centers of planetesimals should be fulfilled .",
    "it was also demonstrated by ti that gas drag could clear the gap of residual high - velocity planetesimals and thus stop accretion completely .    in figure 6 of im93 there is shown a sequence of scenarios for different ratios of the @xmath114  planet to planetesimal masses . in the case @xmath115 , when the gap is barely seen at all , @xmath116 ; since planetesimals are not strongly heated , presumably @xmath117 . for @xmath118",
    ", when the gap becomes pronounced , @xmath119 and @xmath120 .",
    "finally for @xmath121 , when the gap is quite significant , @xmath122 ; heating also becomes important and @xmath113 .",
    "in addition , these results confirm our prediction below in  [ randmot ] that for @xmath123 , when gap starts to form , planetary perturbations begin to dominate planetesimal random velocity stirring within @xmath22 of the planet .",
    "this comparison shows that estimates of gap formation based on the parameter @xmath81 are qualitatively consistent with n - body simulations .",
    "we have established the usefulness of the parameter @xmath81 in describing gap formation .",
    "now we are going to use it to determine the mass of the body which could open a gap in a planetesimal disk .",
    "this is simply done by setting @xmath105 .",
    "we rewrite this condition as @xmath124 where @xmath125 is the planet mass for which @xmath105 .",
    "one can easily see that this value of critical planetary mass coincides with our simple estimate in equation ( [ critestim ] ) if we set @xmath126 .    as we mentioned in ",
    "[ intro ] , it is usually assumed that accretion stops when planet hoovers up a zone in the planetesimal disk with width equal to its hill radius [ eq . ( [ isol ] ) ]",
    ". then the ratio of the two critical masses is @xmath127    we expect the total mass of the circumstellar disk to be of order @xmath128 of the mass of the central star @xmath6 ( osterloh & beckwith 1995 ; mannings & sargent 2000 ) . for the protosolar nebula it is often assumed that surface density of gas at @xmath0 au is @xmath129 g @xmath12 ( hayashi 1981 ) .",
    "the mass fraction of heavy elements , which contribute to solid body formation in this disk , is @xmath130 . using this information",
    "we can estimate that @xmath131 at @xmath0 au and the corresponding factor does not contribute a lot to the ratio in ( [ massratio ] ) ( it varies roughly from @xmath132 to @xmath133 ) .",

    "( [ icold ] ) ] , and is significantly smaller for hot disks [ it is likely to be @xmath135 , see  [ randmot ] ] .    if we take planetesimals to be rocky bodies with radius @xmath136 km and mass @xmath137 g , then @xmath138 . in the end",
    "we obtain that @xmath139 this result means that accretion is slowed down long before the clearing of the feeding zone . we conclude that the masses of planetary embryos are @xmath140 to @xmath106 times smaller than predicted by arguments based on clearing the feeding zone [ see eq .",
    "( [ isol ] ) ] .      equation ( [ 1pop ] ) fully describes the surface density evolution ( or its steady - state structure ) only if it is supplied with information about random motions of particles within the planetesimal disk , which determine @xmath49 and its moment @xmath90 .    for a cold disk ( zero velocity dispersion",
    ") @xmath90 is given by ( [ icold ] ) . in our case",
    "the planetesimal swarm is unlikely to be cold , because planetesimals will be scattered by the planet , and also will scatter each other .",
    "an important point to note here is that these two types of scattering probably operate in quite different regimes .",
    "indeed , the natural parameter determining the heating regime is the ratio of the velocity dispersion to the shear across the hill radius . for the scattering by the planet",
    "this parameter is @xmath141 , with @xmath142 while for the interaction with other planetesimals it is @xmath143 , with @xmath144 , so that @xmath145 .",
    "thus , scattering by the planetary embryo could be in a shear - dominated regime , while mutual scattering of planetesimals is practically always in a dispersion - dominated one .    during a passage within a hill radius from a massive body ,",
    "a planetesimal initially on a circular orbit gets a significant kick , so that its velocity dispersion increases by @xmath146 .",
    "thus , the part of the disk within a hill radius from the planetary embryo will be heated to @xmath147 corresponding to @xmath148 in time @xmath149",
    ". thus the stirring rate by planetary scattering is @xmath150 within a radial distance @xmath21 from the embryo .",
    "the same kind of estimate could be derived for the excitation of the vertical random motions .",
    "this heating rate quickly leads to @xmath151 and , thus , the self - heating of the planetesimal population should be calculated in a dispersion - dominated regime .",
    "in particular the integral @xmath90 in equation ( [ 1pop ] ) describing the scattering of planetesimals by their mutual interactions should be calculated in this approximation .",
    "stewart & ida ( 2000 ) considered velocity stirring in the dispersion - dominated regime .",
    "their results demonstrate that the horizontal stirring rate is @xmath152 if the vertical velocity dispersion is of the same order as a horizontal one ( as we normally expect ) , and they provide a closed analytic form for the stirring coefficient @xmath153 as a function of planetesimal velocity dispersion .",
    "the coefficient @xmath153 is defined to represent the change in the square of the relative eccentricity [ see hnon & petit ( 1986 ) ] , averaged over the vertical and horizontal orbital phases , and the velocity distribution of planetesimals ( ida , 1990 ; stewart & ida , 2000 ) : @xmath154 where @xmath155 are the relative eccentricity , inclination , horizontal and vertical orbital phases , @xmath46 is the separation of semimajor axes of the interacting particles and @xmath156 is the corresponding distribution function .",
    "we assume that @xmath157 , @xmath158 , and @xmath46 are properly normalized by the hill radius for particles participating in the collision [ in this case our definition of @xmath153 differs from stewart & ida ( 2000 ) by a factor of @xmath159 , where @xmath160 and @xmath74 are the masses of interacting planetesimals ] .",
    "vertical stirring is described by a formula similar to ( [ selfheat ] ) but with a different stirring coefficient @xmath161    now we can say more about the relation of the integral @xmath90 to the kinetic properties of the planetesimal population .",
    "one can easily see that the averaging over all possible @xmath162 for a given initial @xmath46 used in definition ( [ igen ] ) is equivalent to averaging over the vertical and horizontal orbital phases at a given relative eccentricity and inclination and then over the distribution of relative eccentricities and inclinations , that is @xmath163.\\label{inter1}\\ ] ] from the conservation of jacobi constant one has @xmath164 $ ] .",
    "then , substituting into ( [ inter1 ] ) we get that @xmath165 this is an important result , because it relates the evolution of the surface density of a spatially inhomogeneous planetesimal population to the viscous stirring in a homogeneous disk .    using these expressions",
    "we can determine the relative role of self - heating of the disk and planetary heating in the vicinity of the massive body .",
    "of course , the former dominates beyond several @xmath21 from planet , but within @xmath22 of the embryo one can get from equations ( [ crit ] ) , ( [ plstir ] ) , ( [ selfheat ] ) , and ( [ i ] ) the simple result that @xmath166 this means that for @xmath167 , when a gap starts to form , embryo perturbations begin to dominate planetesimal heating within @xmath22 of the planet , i.e. when the planet dominates the surface density evolution it also dominates the heating .    the evolution of kinetic properties of planetesimals could be neglected if there is an effective velocity damping due to inelastic collisions between bodies , as in the case of planetary rings ( petit & hnon , 1987a ) , or if there is a strong gas drag . in the planetesimal case , however , gravitational stirring dominates over damping ( kenyon & luu 1998 ) and then the fact that a gap in the distribution of guiding centers is opened does not automatically mean that planetesimals can not reach the planet , because in the course of scattering their velocity dispersion grows as well [ see equation ( [ heatrat ] ) ] .",
    "however , the accretion rate will drop anyway at least because of the less pronounced focussing ( safronov , 1972 ; dones & tremaine , 1996 ) .",
    "also , inhomogeneous random velocity evolution or gas drag could remove the residual planetesimals from the forming gap , thus bringing their surface density around the embryo to zero and shutting down accretion completely ( see ti for n - body simulations in the presence of the gas drag ) .",
    "for this reason we believe that our results with no velocity evolution are applicable to the problem of planet accumulation in many cases .",
    "all the stirring coefficients are functions of the vertical and horizontal velocity dispersions of planetesimal population .",
    "stewart & ida ( 2000 ) have in particular shown that @xmath168 for @xmath151 [ we used this result to derive equation ( [ ihot ] ) ] .",
    "it means that to close properly the problem we need to couple equations for the velocity evolution to equation ( [ 1pop ] ) . in doing so",
    ", one should bear in mind that random motions are highly nonuniform in space , since stirring by the massive body is strongly localized within several hill radii from it .",
    "also , it is not clear that the velocity distribution of planetesimals can be adequately described by the schwarzschild distribution , as is usually assumed for simplicity . for this reason we will not pursue this subject here and postpone its more detailed exploration to a future work .",
    "it is important to note however , that @xmath169 and @xmath170 for @xmath151 , as follows from the equations ( [ ihot ] ) and ( [ hotcrit ] ) .",
    "thus , as @xmath81 grows and the embryo heats up planetesimal population around it , the planetesimal `` viscosity '' decreases ( increasing @xmath81 even more through this velocity coupling ) , which facilitates gap opening .",
    "this only strengthens our conclusion that a gap must form when the condition @xmath91 is fulfilled , even without knowing the details of the random velocity evolution of planetesimals .",
    "in  [ res ] we studied gap opening around a massive body , assuming that the background distribution of surface density of planetesimals is symmetric with respect to the position of the embryo . in this case",
    "we assumed that the embryo is fixed in radius and there is no migration at all .",
    "it is more than likely that in real protoplanetary disks there are significant surface density gradients , which could drive embryo migration .",
    "this could in principle introduce significant changes into our picture . indeed ,",
    "if the embryo is able to migrate quickly it may move out of the gap it starts to form and , thus , gap formation would be suppressed .",
    "planetary migration will naturally occur in the course of embryo accumulation , since in the process of scattering planetesimals , the massive body exchanges its angular momentum with them , which leads to its migration .",
    "indeed , planetesimals passing within @xmath21 from the embryo get displaced by a distance @xmath22 , thus an embryo itself is displaced by @xmath171 . during the time interval @xmath172 approximately @xmath173 planetesimals pass within embryo s hill sphere .",
    "the surface number densities on both sides will likely be different by @xmath174 , although it is likely that as the embryo moves in some direction it plows planetesimals in front of it , leaving behind a depression , which would tend to oppose the migration [ see ward & hourigan ( 1989 ) for a similar effect in gaseous disks ] .",
    "thus , our previous assumption about the surface density difference is likely to be an upper limit and the actual migration will be weaker .",
    "one can easily calculate that the rate of this `` maximum '' migration is @xmath175 the time it takes the embryo to migrate through a zone with a width equal to its own hill radius is then @xmath176 and should be longer than @xmath94 given by equation ( [ topen ] ) if a gap is to be maintained .",
    "thus , the necessary condition here is @xmath177 if , say , @xmath178 , ( and @xmath91 ) then all bodies with masses @xmath179 g will open a gap faster than they migrate through it .",
    "another type of migration could arise if the whole system is immersed in a massive gaseous disk , as should be the case in the early stages of protoplanetary evolution . in this case",
    "goldreich & tremaine ( 1980 ) demonstrated that it takes time @xmath180 for a planet to migrate a distance @xmath181 in the radial direction , where @xmath46 is the disk thickness , determined by its temperature , and @xmath182 is the surface density of gaseous disk . in our case ,",
    "the relevant lengthscale is again @xmath183 , thus migration timescale is @xmath184 comparing these two timescales we obtain : @xmath185    thus , migration due to the interaction with a gaseous disk is unlikely to have an important effect on gap opening .",
    "we studied the possibility that planetary formation due to the accretion of planetesimals could be significantly slowed or even stopped , due to gap formation around a forming planetary embryo , caused by the strong gravitational perturbations of planetesimals in its vicinity .",
    "we find a critical parameter @xmath81 which describes the importance of gap formation [ eq .",
    "( [ crit ] ) ] .",
    "predictions based on this parameter were compared with numerical n - body simulations of this process ( im93 , ti97 ) , and they are in good agreement .    only the case of a single mass distribution of the particles in a disk was studied here .",
    "but it is plausible that our basic results hold true even if a distribution of masses exists .",
    "only the characteristic planetesimal mass entering this parameter should be chosen carefully , and this question merits further investigation [ see kokubo & ida ( 1996 ) , ( 1998 ) for some numerical results ] .",
    "our findings were confirmed by solving the evolution equation ( [ 1pop ] ) neglecting the velocity dispersion evolution of planetesimals in the disk .",
    "the kinematic properties of the planetesimal population are important in this sort of study , and the surface density evolution and velocity evolution of planetesimals are closely related .",
    "nevertheless , we hope to have grasped the main qualitative features of the evolution of the distribution of guiding centers even without keeping track of the velocity evolution .",
    "the instantaneous density of planetesimals depends on their kinematic properties and should experience at least a decrease by a factor of several in the vicinity of the embryo , leading to slowing down the accretion ( and gas drag and inhomogeneous velocity evolution could clear out the gap completely ) .",
    "we also stress that our results for a cold disk provide an upper limit to the embryo mass required to open a gap .    if the disk is not uniform , migration of the embryo itself also likely to occur in the course of its interaction with planetesimals or with the more massive gaseous disk from which the whole embryo - planetesimal system originally condensed .",
    "we have estimated how this could affect our results and show that gap formation is likely to occur even when migration is present .",
    "finally , the evolution equation itself , coupled with the equations of planetesimal velocity evolution , provide us with a powerful tool to study the formation and evolution of planetary embryos .",
    "since our results seem to be in good agreement with n - body simulations , we may use this machinery for other problems of a similar nature .",
    "an obvious example is the coupled evolution of several planetary embryos .",
