    "this fact promoted the need for a mysterious dark matter to form halos around galaxies , resolving the discrepancy with gravity . to date , there is no convincing evidence either in deep underground laboratory experiments such as lux  @xcite and panda - x  @xcite , and astrophysical and lhc experiments to support the existence of exotic dark matter particles .",
    "modified gravitation is an alternative explanation for the dynamics of galaxies and clusters .",
    "a fully covariant and relativistic theory of gravitation called scalar - tensor - vector - gravity ( stvg ) or mog ( modified gravity ) has been developed to explain the dynamics of galaxies , clusters and the large - scale structure of the universe without detectable dark matter  @xcite .",

    "the transition from newtonian acceleration behavior for small @xmath44 to non - newtonian behavior for intermediate values of @xmath44 is due to the repulsive yukawa contribution in ( [ mogaccelerationlaw ] ) .",

    "we observe from ( [ mondvel ] ) that the rotational velocity @xmath71 remains flat and constant to infinity , while for mog ( [ asymptoticmog ] ) leads for asymptotically large @xmath44 to a more realistic newtonian - kepler fall - off for @xmath72 . in the fits to milky way galaxy data  @xcite , it has been shown that mog fits data out to @xmath73 kpc , while mond fails to fit the data for isotropic behavior of rotational velocities of stars and tracers .",
    "mcgaugh et al . ,  @xcite have demonstrated that the tight one - to - one correlation between @xmath74 and @xmath75 strongly suggests that ordinary baryons are the source of the gravitational potential for galaxies .",
    "the results demonstrating the correlation between the observed galaxy accelerations and the baryonic matter is described in fig 2  .",
    "unless a dark matter paradigm can explain this correlation , then one will be motivated to consider altering the gravitational dynamical laws rather than invoke dark matter .",
