    "pulsars in double - neutron - star binaries provide the best known laboratories for experimental tests of gravity in the radiative and strong field regimes .",
    "timing analysis of pulsar signals allows measurement of five keplerian orbital elements as well as a number of post - keplerian ( pk ) orbital parameters .",
    "the pk parameters can be analyzed using a theory - independent procedure in which the masses of the two stars are the only dynamically important _ a priori _ unknowns ( @xcite ) .",
    "each of the pk parameters depends on the masses in a different way ; consequently , if any two of them are measured , the relevant parameters of the two - body system are fully determined within any gravitational theory . if three or more pk parameters can be measured , the overdetermined system can be used to test the gravitational theory itself .",
    "measured values of the pk parameters @xmath3 ( rate of advance of periastron ) , @xmath4 ( time dilation and gravitational redshift ) and @xmath5 ( orbital period derivative ) for binary pulsar psr  b1913 + 16 have been found to be in excellent agreement with the predictions of general relativity ( @xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the observed value of @xmath5 confirms that the system is losing energy in the form of quadrupolar gravitational waves at the rate expected according to general relativity ( gr ) .    an opportunity to repeat and extend this test of relativistic gravitation",
    "was provided by discovery of a second suitable binary pulsar , psr  b1534 + 12 , in a 10.1  hour orbit ( @xcite ) .",
    "psr  b1534 + 12 is significantly brighter than psr  b1913 + 16 , and its pulse has a narrow peak , allowing more precise timing measurements . because the orbit is nearly edge - on as viewed from the earth , the pk parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 ( the `` range '' and `` shape '' of the shapiro time delay ) are more easily measured .",
    "in addition , both @xmath3 and @xmath4 are measurable , as for psr b1913 + 16 , because of their contribution to secularly accumulating effects in the data .",
    "the resulting overdetermination of the orbit has already led to a non - radiative test of gravitation theory in the strong - field regime , complementing the @xmath3-@xmath4-@xmath8 test for psr  b1913 + 16 ( @xcite ) .",
    "previously published timing measurements of psr  b1534 + 12 were all made with the arecibo 305 m telescope .",
    "we have extended this sequence of observations ( @xcite ) through early 1994 , when the telescope went out of normal service for a major upgrading ; since then we have used the 43 m telescope at green bank , west virginia , and the 76 m lovell telescope at jodrell bank , england , to acquire additional data .",
    "owing to its slower and less eccentric orbit , the expected rate of orbital period decay for psr b1534 + 12 is more than an order of magnitude less than for psr b1913 + 16 . however the timing data are considerably more precise , and we find that fitting our full sequence of pulse times of arrival ( toas ) to the standard relativistic pulsar timing model now yields a measurement of @xmath8 in the solar - system barycentric rest frame with uncertainty approximately 7% of the expected gr value .",
    "the result is a convincing second test of the dissipative coupling between accelerating masses and a gravitational radiation field that carries energy and angular momentum away from the system . like the first such test ( @xcite ) these results are in good accord with general relativity theory .",
    "the precision of the new result is limited by uncertainty in the necessary kinematic corrections , which depend on the poorly known pulsar distance .",
    "interestingly , we can invert the test , assuming that gr is the correct theory of gravity , and calculate that the distance of psr  b1534 + 12 must be about 1.6 times that estimated from the dispersion measure ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations at the 305 m arecibo telescope were made primarily with the princeton mark  iii system ( @xcite ) , using dual - polarization @xmath9-channel filterbanks with 0.25mhz channels at 430mhz and 1.25mhz channels at 1400mhz .",
    "the signals in each channel were square - law detected , and the two polarizations summed in hardware and then folded at the topocentric pulsar period .",
    "integration times were typically 3 minutes at 430mhz and 5 minutes at 1400mhz .",
    "the resulting total - intensity profiles have 512 ( 430mhz ) or 1024 ( 1400mhz ) bins across the 37.9ms period .",
    "the effective time resolution is dominated by the dispersion smearing in a single channel , approximately 304@xmath10s at 430mhz and 44@xmath10s at 1400mhz ; quadrature addition of the post - detection time constants and the boxcar - averaging bin sizes used for these observations yields the total resolutions quoted in table  [ tab : obsparms ] .",
    "the arecibo observations extend from august 1990 through march 1994 .",
    "we observed psr b1534 + 12 with the national radio astronomy observatory 43 m telescope at green bank west virginia , between march 1994 and may 1997 .",
    "observing sessions were spaced typically at two month intervals , and we used frequencies of 575 and 800mhz .",
    "a digital fourier transform spectrometer ( the `` spectral processor '' ) analyzed signals in each of two polarizations into 512 spectral channels across a 40mhz passband .",
    "the spectra were folded synchronously at the predicted topocentric pulse period and averaged for three minutes .",
    "the resulting pulse profiles had 128 phase bins , or a resolution of @xmath11s .",
    "the data were de - dispersed after detection and opposite polarizations summed to produce a single total - intensity pulse profile for each integration .",
    "we observed psr  b1534 + 12 with the 76 m lovell telescope between january and july 1997 , using the princeton mark  iv data acquisition system at 610mhz ( @xcite ) .",
    "exploratory observations were made in january and february , followed by a concentrated campaign from 16 june to 14 july during which time the pulsar was observed for up to 3 hours , during scintillation maxima , nearly every day . for each sense of circular polarization ,",
    "a 5mhz bandpass was mixed to baseband using local oscillators in phase quadrature .",
    "the four resulting signals were low - pass filtered at 2.35mhz ( filters 60  db down at 2.5mhz ) , sampled at 5mhz , quantized to 4 bits , and written to a large disk array and later to magnetic tapes . upon playback",
    ", the undetected signal voltages were dedispersed using the phase - coherent technique described by hankins and rickett ( 1975 ) .",
    "after amplitude calibrations are applied , self- and cross - products of the right- and left - handed complex voltages yield the stokes parameters of the incoming signal .",
    "these products were folded at the topocentric pulsar period using 2048 phase bins , and pulse toas were determined from the resulting total - intensity profiles using 190s integrations .",
    "a summary of the more important parameters and statistics of all four observing systems is presented in table  [ tab : obsparms ] .",
    "we used the same toa - fitting procedure for all data sets .",
    "each observed profile was fitted to a standard template , using a least - squares method in the fourier transform domain to measure its time offset ( @xcite ) .",
    "the offset was added to the time of the first sample of a period near the middle of the integration , thereby yielding an effective pulse arrival time .",
    "a different standard template was used for each observing system and frequency ; they were made by averaging the available profiles over several hours or more .",
    "uncertainties in the toas were estimated from the least squares procedure , and also from the observed scatter of the toas within 30 minutes of each one .",
    "each observatory s local time standard was corrected retroactively to the utc timescale , using data from the global positioning system ( gps ) satellites .",
    "a pulse received on earth at topocentric time @xmath12 is emitted at a time in the comoving pulsar frame given by @xmath13 here @xmath14 is a reference epoch and @xmath15 is the offset between the observatory master clock and the reference standard of terrestrial time .",
    "the dispersive delay is @xmath16 , where @xmath17 , with dispersion measure dm in @xmath18pc , radio frequency @xmath19 in mhz , and the delay in seconds .",
    "finally , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 are propagation delays and relativistic time adjustments for effects within the solar system , and @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 are similar terms accounting for phenomena within the pulsar s orbit ( @xcite ) .",

    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at a given time @xmath12 , then , the propagation delay across the pulsar orbit is calculated by a model which incorporates ten parameters implicitly defined in the above equations : five keplerian parameters ( @xmath32 , @xmath30 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 ) and five pk parameters ( @xmath36 , @xmath5 , @xmath4 , @xmath6 , @xmath7 ) .",
    "these quantities , in conjunction with a simple time polynomial to model the spin of the pulsar and with astrometric parameters to model the propagation of the signal across the solar system , constitute the free parameters to be fit in the theory - independent timing model .    in a particular theory of gravity",
    ", the five pk parameters can be written as functions of the pulsar and companion star masses , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , and the well - determined keplerian parameters .",
    "of particular interest is general relativity , where the equations are as follows ( see @xcite ) : @xmath39 here the masses @xmath37 , @xmath38 , and @xmath40 are expressed in solar units , and we use the additional shorthand notations @xmath41 and @xmath42s , where @xmath43 is the angle between the orbital angular momentum and the line of sight , @xmath44 the newtonian constant of gravity , and @xmath45 the speed of light .",
    "we used the standard tempo analysis software ( @xcite ; see also internet location http:@xmath46pulsar.princeton.edu/tempo ) together with the jpl  de200 solar - system ephemeris ( @xcite ) to fit the measured pulse arrival times to the timing model with a least - squares technique .",
    "results for the astrometric , spin , and dispersion parameters of psr b1534 + 12 are presented in table  2 .",
    "initial tests indicated the likely presence of systematic errors in the arecibo data taken at 430mhz ( see below ) , so these data were used only for the calculation of the dispersion correction . the uncertainty quoted for dm",
    "is dominated by the unavoidable difficulty in aligning the frequency - dependent pulse shapes obtained in the different observing bands .",
    "we list for the first time a significant measurement of the rate of change of dispersion measure for this pulsar , determined from the dual - frequency data collected at arecibo from 1990 to 1994 .",
    "we note that there is no guarantee that this parameter will have remained constant since 1994 .",
    "we fit the data to two models of the pulsar orbit .",
    "the theory - independent `` dd '' model ( @xcite ) treats all five pk parameters defined in  3.1 as free parameters in the fit .",
    "alternatively , the `` ddgr '' model ( @xcite ) assumes general relativity to be correct and uses equations  [ eq : omdot ] through  [ eq : s ] to link the pk parameters to @xmath40 and @xmath38 ; consequently it requires only two post - keplerian free parameters .",
    "table  [ tab : orbparms ] presents our adopted orbital parameters .",
    "uncertainties given in the table are approximately twice the formal `` @xmath47 '' errors from the fit ; we believe them to be conservative estimates of the true 68%-confidence uncertainties , including both random and systematic effects .",
    "the keplerian orbital parameters include the period @xmath48 , projected semi - major axis @xmath49 , eccentricity @xmath35 , longitude of periastron @xmath30 , and time of periastron @xmath33 .",
    "these quantities are followed by the measured post - keplerian parameters relevant to each of the two models .",
    "for the first time , the precision of this experiment requires the ddgr solution to include a parameter we call `` excess @xmath50 , '' which accounts for an otherwise unmodeled acceleration resulting from galactic kinematics .",
    "the best estimates of the masses of the pulsar and its companion come from the ddgr solution .",
    "we find the masses to be equal : @xmath51 .",
    "for the sake of comparison table  [ tab : orbparms ] lists , in italic numbers , computed pk parameter values corresponding to the measured masses in the ddgr fit .",
    "we call attention to the fact that the fitted and derived parameter values are in excellent accord , indicating good agreement of the theory - independent solution with general relativity .",
    "figure 1 shows the post - fit residuals for the arecibo 1400mhz data , the green bank data , and the jodrell bank data , plotted as functions of date . even within a single data set",
    ", the toa uncertainties can vary by factors of three or more , above and below the median values @xmath52 listed in table  1 , because of scintillation - induced intensity variations .",
    "we have not attempted to show these differences in data quality by means of error bars in the residual plots .",
    "figure  2 illustrates the average post - fit residuals for the arecibo measurements at 1400mhz and the jodrell bank data at 610mhz , plotted as functions of orbital phase .",
    "for some time we have suspected that solutions for the fitted parameters of psr b1534 + 12 , as determined from the arecibo 430mhz data , are biased by small systematic errors in the toas .",
    "these errors likely arise from imperfect post - detection dispersion removal that follows as a consequence of the relatively coarse frequency resolution of the filter - bank spectrometer .",
    "it is extremely difficult to achieve toas with systematic errors less than a few percent of the dominant instrumental smoothing effects in the data  in this instance , the dispersion time across a single channel .",
    "variable spectral features caused by interstellar scintillation , together with slightly irregular filter passbands and center frequencies , make the arecibo 430mhz measurements unreliable at the several microsecond level .",
    "some further information on the data quality is presented in figure  3 .",
    "here we follow taylor and weisberg ( 1989 ) and explore the statistical properties of the post - fit residuals to see if they `` integrate down '' as @xmath53 when @xmath54 consecutive values are averaged . as expected",
    ", this test confirms that the arecibo 430mhz data ( and to a lesser extent the green bank data , which anyway receive low weight ) deviate from the ideal @xmath53 behavior .",
    "this indicates the likely presence of systematic errors in the toas , though we can not completely rule out the possibility of a frequency - dependent deviation from the timing model ( e.g. , aberration - induced pulse profile variations ) . in any case , it is clear that for the highest accuracy within our preferred models we must omit the existing arecibo 430mhz measurements from our solution , as described above .",
    "the parameters of psr b1534 + 12 are therefore best determined from the arecibo 1400mhz data along with the green bank and jodrell bank data sets .",
    "the higher observing frequency of 1400mhz assures that for these measurements the total instrumental smoothing , even with 1.25mhz channel bandwidths , is only 97@xmath10s ( see table  1 ) .",
    "better still , the princeton mark iv system used at jodrell bank was explicitly designed to minimize or eliminate dispersion - related systematic errors in toas .",
    "we used these two data sets , both with and without the much lower - weighted green bank data , to measure and check the system parameters with highest accuracy .",
    "arbitrary offsets were allowed between the different data sets to allow for frequency - dependent changes in pulse shape and slight differences in the standard profile alignments . for obvious reasons ,",
    "we look forward to making improved measurements at 430mhz with the princeton mark iv system , when the arecibo telescope is available for use following its upgrade .",
    "note that each of the data sets treated in figure  3 may deviate at least slightly from the ideal @xmath53 behavior , suggesting small systematic errors of unknown origin . to partially compensate for this effect ,",
    "uncertainties in toas were increased ( in quadrature ) by 2.9 , 17.1 , and 20.5@xmath10s , respectively , when calculating weights for the arecibo , jodrell bank , and green bank data sets .",
    "before proceeding to tests of gr we must correct the observed @xmath50 , which is expressed in the reference frame of the solar system barycenter , to the center - of - mass frame of the binary pulsar .",
    "damour and taylor ( 1991 ) derived an expression for the most significant bias , which arises from galactic kinematic effects .",
    "it can be written as the sum of terms arising from acceleration toward the plane of the galaxy , acceleration within the plane of the galaxy , and an apparent acceleration due to the proper motion of the binary system : @xmath55    + \\mu^2\\frac{d}{c}.\\ ] ] here @xmath56 is the vertical component of galactic acceleration , @xmath57 and @xmath58 the galactic coordinates of the pulsar , @xmath10 the proper motion , @xmath59 the circular velocity at the sun s galactocentric radius @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 the corresponding values at the pulsar s location , @xmath63 the angle between the sun and the galactic center as seen from the pulsar , and @xmath64 the distance from the pulsar to the sun .",
    "the pulsar distance can be estimated from the dispersion measure , together with a smoothed - out model of the free electron distribution in the galaxy .",
    "the taylor and cordes ( 1993 ) model yields @xmath65kpc for psr b1534 + 12 , with an uncertainty of perhaps 0.2kpc . at this distance",
    "we estimate @xmath66 from the model of kuijken and gilmore ( 1989 ) .",
    "following damour and taylor ( 1991 ) , we assume a flat galactic rotation curve and take @xmath67kms@xmath68 and @xmath69kpc .",
    "then , summing the terms in equation  ( [ eqn : gal ] ) and multiplying by @xmath34 , we find the total kinematic correction to be @xmath70 the uncertainty in this correction is dominated by the uncertainty in distance , which is only roughly estimated by the taylor and cordes model .",
    "our measurement of the intrinsic rate of orbital period decay is therefore @xmath71 under general relativity , the orbital period decay due to gravitational radiation damping , @xmath72 , can be predicted from the masses @xmath37 and @xmath38 ( eq .  [ eq : pbdot ] ) , which in turn can be deduced from the high precision measurements of @xmath36 and @xmath4 .",
    "the expected value is @xmath73 although the measured value in the pulsar center - of - mass frame differs from this prediction by 1.4 standard deviations , it can be brought into good agreement by increasing the pulsar distance to slightly over 1kpc .",
    "stated another way , we can assume that gr is the correct theory of gravity , measure the `` excess @xmath8 '' for the system as described above and presented in table  3 , and then invert equation  [ eqn : gal ] to determine the pulsar distance ( @xcite ) . by this method",
    "we obtain @xmath1  kpc ( 68% confidence limit ) .",
    "the uncertainty is dominated by the measurement uncertainty of @xmath74 , rather than uncertainties in the galactic rotation parameters or the acceleration @xmath56 .",
    "it follows that continued timing of this system should lead to a much more precise distance measurement , in due time .",
    "we note that the timing solution provides a second , independent constraint on the distance . the upper limit on parallax , @xmath75mas ( table 2 )",
    "constrains the distance to @xmath76kpc . while the parallax distance has less precision than the kinematic distance , it is reassuring that these measurements are in agreement .    an accurate distance for psr  b1534 + 12 is of considerable interest because of the importance of this system to estimates of the rate of coalescence of binary neutron - star pairs in a typical galaxy .",
    "previous estimates of this rate have used much smaller distances for psr  b1534 + 12 , including 0.4  kpc ( @xcite ) , 0.5  kpc ( @xcite ) , and 0.7  kpc ( @xcite ) , leading to a low estimate of its intrinsic luminosity .",
    "if our newly determined distance is correct , as we believe it must be , the earlier studies have overestimated the number density of systems like psr  b1534 + 12 in the universe by factors of 2.5 to 20 .",
    "we find that the most recent observational estimate of the double neutron star inspiral rate , @xmath77 ( @xcite ) , must be reduced to between @xmath78 and @xmath79 , depending on the unknown scale height of such systems in the galaxy .",
    "this is , of course , a lower bound on the number of coalescence events ; the actual rate will be higher by unknown factors that account for the fraction of pulsars with beams that do not cross the earth and the number of double neutron star binaries that do not contain an active pulsar .",
    "our analysis of this experiment represents the second test of general relativity based on the @xmath3 , @xmath4 , and @xmath8 parameters of a binary pulsar system , and the first one to add significant measurements of the shapiro - delay parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "the left - hand sides of equations  ( [ eq : omdot][eq : s ] ) represent measured quantities , as specified for this experiment in the `` dd '' column of table  3 .",
    "if gr is consistent with the measurements and there are no significant unmodeled effects , we should expect the five curves corresponding to equations  ( [ eq : omdot][eq : s ] ) to intersect at a single point in the @xmath37-@xmath38 plane . a graphical summary of the situation for psr b1534 + 12 is presented in figure  [ fig : massmass ] , in which a pair of lines delimit the 68% confidence limit for each pk parameter ( a single line for @xmath3 , whose uncertainty is too small to show ) . a filled circle at @xmath80 marks the ddgr solution of table  3 , and its location on the @xmath3 line agrees well ( better than 1% ) with the measured dd values of @xmath4 and @xmath7 .",
    "we have already noted that the dd value of @xmath8 is slightly too small when corrected to the dispersion - estimated distance .",
    "however , as discussed above , this discrepancy can be removed by invoking a larger distance to the pulsar .",
    "finally , the value of @xmath6 , although presently little better than a 20% measurement , is also well centered on its expected value . altogether we find the measured parameters of the psr b1534 + 12 system to be in excellent accord with general relativity , and consequently this theory has passed another very significant astrophysical test .",
