    "fe@xmath0sib@xmath1  was identified as a uniaxial ferromagnet at room temperature as well @xcite , and a spin reorientation was seen to occur near 140 k , resulting in planar magnetic anisotropy at lower temperature @xcite .",
    "the curie temperatures ( @xmath4 ) of both phases were found to be well above room temperature , near 630 k for fe@xmath0pb@xmath1  @xcite and 784 k for fe@xmath0sib@xmath1@xcite .",
    "a very recent study of fe@xmath0pb@xmath1  reports @xmath4 = 655 k , magnetic anisotropy comparable to hard ferrites , and a magnetic moment per fe of 1.72 @xmath5 @xcite . the isostructural mn compounds are also ferromagnetic , but with curie temperatures closer to room temperature , making them perhaps more interesting as magnetocaloric rather than magnet materials @xcite .",

    "this can be parameterized by the anisotropy field @xmath23 , which is the applied field required to saturate the material in the magnetically hard direction .",
    "since a polycrystalline material with randomly oriented crystallites contains some fraction with the hard axis along the measurement direction , _ j _ vs _ h _ will also saturate near the anisotropy field , but the approach is typically quite gradual and @xmath23 can be difficult to define precisely in this way . in some cases ,",
    "the singular point detection technique @xcite can be used to identify anomalies in d@xmath24/d@xmath25 which occur at @xmath23 , but that was not successful using the data for the present samples .",

    "[ fig : jvsh]c , and this disagreement might be due to the neglect of demagnetization effects in the present analysis . with these limitations in mind , the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : jvsh]c suggest that co and mn substitution reduces @xmath23 in fe@xmath0pb@xmath1 , but may slightly increase @xmath23 in fe@xmath0sib@xmath1 .",

    "approximately 1000 k - points in the full brillouin zone were used for these calculations , with spin - orbit coupling included ( excepting the internal coordinate optimization ) .",
    "we briefly summarize the results for the p compound ( a more detailed discussion of these calculations can be found in ref . ) .",
    "we find an average saturation moment of 1.79 @xmath31/fe , in good agreement with our experimental value ; this value includes small negative moments ( @xmath32 ) on the p and b atoms and a small orbital fe moment of approximately 0.03 @xmath31/fe . from the calculations we find uniaxial anisotropy , as in the experiment , with a magnetic anisotropy constant k@xmath33 of 0.46 mj / m@xmath34 , which yields an anisotropy field h@xmath35 of approximately 0.9 tesla , in reasonable agreement with the experiment .",
    "the situation for the fe@xmath0sib@xmath1 compound is significantly more complex and interesting . as with the p compound",
    "we find a ferromagnetic state with a saturation moment of 1.83 @xmath31/fe , including negative moments of -0.06 @xmath31 on the si and -0.1 @xmath31 on the b and a small orbital moment of 0.04 @xmath31 per fe .",

    "= 0 configuration .",
    "note that the theoretical calculations were performed using a 300 k structure ( with internal coordinates optimized ) , so that the observed spin - reorientation does not appear to be the result of lattice expansion but may rather originate in dynamical effects .",
    "these two scenarios were hypothesized @xcite as competing explanations for the spin reorientation @xcite in the manganese - based ferromagnet mnbi , which is planar below 90 k and uniaxial above .",
    "here we suggest that dynamical effects from the variation in magnetic anisotropy associated with the motion of the ions away from their equilibrium positions are responsible for the spin - reorientation .",
    "this is an effect distinct from both that of lattice expansion as well as that of the general reduction of magnetic moment with increasing temperature , which generally reduces magnetic anisotropy .",
    "we have also performed calculations of the magnetic properties ( using the virtual crystal approximation ) of the partially mn substituted compound fe@xmath2mnsib@xmath1 . as with the other compounds we find a strongly ferromagnetic ordering , with average spin moment 1.88 @xmath5 per transition metal , which is slightly larger than the experimental value of 1.50 @xmath5 per transition metal ( table [ tab : properties ] ) .",
    "it is possible that some of the alloyed mn anti - align with the fe , which would reduce the overall moment . unlike in the pure compound fe@xmath0sib@xmath1",

    "our calculations agree with this finding , showing uniaxial anisotropy in fe@xmath2mnsib@xmath1 .",
    "substitution of co is seen to strongly suppress the ferromagnetic behavior , reducing the magnetic moment by about 20% and the curie temperature by more than 100 k. mn substitution has a much smaller effect .",

    "<S> anisotropic thermal expansion is observed in fe@xmath0pb@xmath1  and fe@xmath0sib@xmath1 , with negative thermal expansion seen along the _ c_-axis of fe@xmath0sib@xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> first principles calculations of the magnetic properties of fe@xmath0sib@xmath1  and fe@xmath2mnsib@xmath1  are reported . </S>",
    "<S> the results , including the magnetic moment and anisotropy , and are in good agreement with experiment . </S>"
