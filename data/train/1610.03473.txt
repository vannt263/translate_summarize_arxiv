    "<S> it was found that the intrinsic spin - hall effect is possible at the edges of the sample  @xcite or in mesoscopic systems  @xcite . in the hopping regime </S>",
    "<S> the electric current flows in a narrow quasi - one - dimensional cluster . </S>",
    "<S> therefore the intrinsic spin current is expected to be nonzero in the strongly inhomogeneous system under study .    in order to make an estimation of cisp by eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ sigma_cisp ] ) we present the hopping resistivity as @xmath97 , where @xmath98 is the maximum distance between neighboring sites in the percolation cluster . </S>",
    "<S> we adopt the model where the hopping amplitudes are @xmath99 and @xmath100 . under these assumptions @xmath101 . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical simulation of spin dynamics in the hopping regime was performed on the square sample with @xmath102 sites  @xcite .    . </S>",
    "<S> the black curve shows the function @xmath92 . ]    </S>",
    "<S> all the three effects under study are described by a single dimensionless function @xmath94 and obey the common dependence on the site concentration and on the spin relaxation time . </S>",
    "<S> the spin current as a function @xmath103 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : js ] for the small concentration @xmath104 . </S>",
    "<S> the drift and diffusion contributions to the spin current are shown separately . </S>",
    "<S> as expected , in the limit of slow spin relaxation the drift and diffusion currents completely compensate each other , so the total spin current is zero . </S>",
    "<S> we stress that the spin separation is still present in this limit and represents the intrinsic she . </S>",
    "<S> as the spin relaxation rate increases the diffusion spin current diminishes , and in the limit @xmath105 only the drift spin current survives in agreement with eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> for small concentrations @xmath106 we find a finite value @xmath107 , so the drift spin current is independent of @xmath13 in this limit .    for typical parameters </S>",
    "<S> @xmath108  @xmath109 , @xmath110  nm , @xmath111  mev , @xmath112  mev , @xmath113 , @xmath114  kv / cm , @xmath115  kohm , @xmath116  ps , and @xmath117  ns , we obtain a small value @xmath118 . however , increase of @xmath13 results in drastic enhancement of the electrical spin polarization . at the crossover from hopping to the diffusion conductivity </S>",
    "<S> we get a relatively large value of cisp @xmath119  % easily detectable in experiments .    _ </S>",
    "<S> conclusion._we have proposed a unified description of cisp , sge and she in the hopping regime . based on numerical simulations and percolation theory we made the estimations of the corresponding susceptibilities . due to the suppression of spin relaxation in the hopping conductivity regime , </S>",
    "<S> the spin effects are underlined , in particular the degree of current induced spin polarization for real structures can be large .    </S>",
