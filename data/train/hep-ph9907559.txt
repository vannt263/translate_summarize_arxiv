    "it was first pointed out by thooft in 1976 that instanton - like nonperturbative effects violate baryon - number conservation in the standard electroweak gauge theory @xcite .",
    "these effects are exponentially suppressed by a large factor at zero temperature and hence the stability of proton is practically guaranteed .",
    "kuzmin , rubakov and shaposhnikov suggested @xcite , however , that the baryon - number violation is not suppressed and can be even efficient at high temperatures above the electroweak phase transition .",
    "these baryon - number violating ( `` sphaleron '' ) processes conserve a linear combination of baryon ( @xmath3 ) and lepton ( @xmath4 ) numbers , that is , @xmath5 . therefore ,",
    "if the baryon asymmetry was generated in the early universe with @xmath5 conserving processes as in the standard @xmath6 grand unified theory , all baryon asymmetry would be washed out by the `` sphaleron '' effects @xcite .",
    "the existence of baryon ( matter - antimatter ) asymmetry in the present universe , thus , indicates that the @xmath5 violating processes played an important role on generating the baryon asymmetry in the early universe .",
    "it is quite natural to consider that such @xmath5 violating interactions induce effective operators of @xmath5 violation at low energies .",
    "the lowest dimensional possible operators in the electroweak gauge theory is @xmath7 where @xmath8 ( @xmath9=1 , 2 , 3 ) and @xmath10 denote lepton doublets and the higgs scalar field , respectively , and @xmath11 is the scale of @xmath5 violation . these operators induce small neutrino masses in the vacuum @xmath12 246/@xmath13 gev @xcite .",
    "there is now a convincing experimental evidence @xcite that one of neutrinos has indeed a small mass @xmath14 of order 0.1 ev , which would encourage us to continue the above consideration to some extent .    the lepton ( or @xmath5)-number violating operators ( [ eq : lv - o ] ) arise from the exchange of heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath15 ( @xmath16 1 , 2 , 3 ) @xcite .",
    "decays of these heavy neutrinos @xmath15 produce very naturally lepton ( or @xmath5 ) asymmetry if @xmath17 and @xmath18 are not conserved @xcite .",
    "the produced lepton asymmetry is converted to baryon asymmetry through the `` sphaleron '' effects in the early universe @xcite .",
    "therefore , the leptogenesis seems the most natural mechanism to account for the baryon asymmetry in the present universe .",
    "there have been , so far , proposed various scenarios for the leptogenesis depending on production mechanisms of the heavy majorana neutrinos @xmath15 @xcite . among them",
    "the most conventional is the thermal production of @xmath15 in the early universe .",
    "the detail analysis @xcite shows that sufficient lepton asymmetry to explain the present baryon asymmetry can be obtained if the reheating temperature @xmath19 of inflation is @xmath20 gev .",
    "however , when we consider the leptogenesis in the framework of supergravity , we have a cosmological gravitino problem : too many gravitinos are produced with @xmath21 gev to maintain the success of the big - bang nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) @xcite .",
    "one way to solve the problem is to assume that the gravitino is the lightest supersymmetry ( susy ) particle of mass @xmath22@xmath23 gev @xcite .",
    "kev @xcite . ]",
    "although this solution is a consistent and even interesting possibility , it is very important to find other leptogenesis scenarios consistent with the bbn in a wide region of the gravitino mass @xmath24 gev1 tev .",
    "in a recent article @xcite we discussed leptogenesis via decays of the heavy majorana neutrinos produced non - thermally in inflaton decays and found that the desired amount of lepton asymmetry is obtained for @xmath25 gev . in this case the gravitino of mass @xmath26 500gev1 tev becomes consistent with the bbn @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to perform a detailed analysis on the leptogenesis , adopting a larger class of inflation models .",
    "we find that the required lepton asymmetry @xmath27 ( the ratio of the lepton - number density @xmath28 to the entropy density of the universe @xmath29 ) can be obtained even for @xmath1 gev in some of the inflation models , and hence we conclude that there is no cosmological gravitino problem in the interesting wide region of the gravitino mass @xmath30 gev1 tev .",
    "we assume susy and hence supergravity throughout this paper .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : la - infdecay ] we review briefly the lepton - number production in the decays of the heavy majorana neutrinos .",
    "the magnitude of the lepton - asymmetry parameter @xmath31 depends on various yukawa coupling constants @xmath32 and the mass ratios @xmath33 ( @xmath34 denote masses of the @xmath15 ) . for an estimation of @xmath31",
    "we adopt the froggatt - nielsen model @xcite for mass matrices of quarks and leptons including @xmath15 , since it is very `` successful '' in explaining the observed mass hierarchies and mixing angles .",
    "the leptogenesis in a hybrid inflationary universe is discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : lg - hybridinf ] , where we consider two different types of susy hybrid inflation models . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lg - newinf ] we discuss the leptogenesis in a susy new inflation model .",
    "we also consider the case of a susy topological inflation in sec .",
    "[ sec : lg - topinf ] .",
    "the last section is devoted to discussion and conclusions .",
    "before discussing lepton - number generation in decays of the heavy majorana neutrinos , we briefly review the froggatt - nielsen ( fn ) model @xcite for mass matrices of quarks and leptons .",
    "we adopt the fn model throughout this paper , since it seems the most attractive mechanism for explaining the observed hierarchies in the quark and charged lepton mass matrices .",
    "the model is based on a broken @xmath35 family symmetry .",
    "a gauge - singlet field @xmath36 carrying the fn charge @xmath37 is assumed to have a vacuum - expectation value ( vev ) @xmath38 and then the yukawa couplings of higgs supermultiplets arise from nonrenormalizable interactions of @xmath36 as @xmath39 where @xmath40 are the fn charges of various supermultiplets @xmath41 , @xmath42 @xmath43 coupling constants . @xmath44 and @xmath45 are higgs supermultiplets which couple to up - type and down - type quarks , respectively .",
    "here and hereafter , we take the gravitational scale @xmath46 gev equal to unity .",
    "the mass hierarchies for quarks and charged leptons are well explained in terms of their fn charges listed in table [ tab : fncharges ] with @xmath47 @xcite .",
    "the charges for @xmath48 are taken to be the same as those of up - type quarks assuming that they belong to the same * 10 * s in the @xmath6 grand unified theory .",
    "the charge @xmath49 of the @xmath50 may be 0 or 1 ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for details ) .",
    "now we discuss , by taking @xmath51 for example , a breaking of @xmath55 to induce a khler potential ( [ eq : kh - hinf ] ) , which is very important to cause the inflaton @xmath56 decay in the second hybrid inflation model as explained in the text .",
    "we assume that the @xmath55 symmetry is broken down to @xmath57-symmetry by the vev of the @xmath58 supermultiplet carrying a @xmath55-charge @xmath59 . because of the positive @xmath60-charge of @xmath58 the superpotential does not receive any @xmath55-breaking effects",
    ". however , we may have the following khler potential : @xmath61 then , the non - vanishing vev of the @xmath58 field gives rise to eq .",
    "( [ eq : kh - hinf ] ) and the coupling constant @xmath62 in eq .",
