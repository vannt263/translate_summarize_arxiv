    "since in practical optimisation problems the values of the data usually are not known exactly and/or are subject to disturbances , stability and sensitivity analysis constitute a crucial element of the so - called post - optimisation analysis , which helps to evaluate the practical usefulness of the obtained results .    here",
    "we study the structural stability of a bang  singular ",
    "bang extremal in the minimum time problem where the dynamics is single - input and control - affine .",
    "the paper is based on the hamiltonian approach which is used both in the optimality and in the stability results .",
    "we point out that , as in the classically studied regular cases ( see @xcite ) , the assumptions on the nominal problem are the ones which give optimality , see @xcite , together with a controllability assumption which grants the uniqueness of the adjoint covector .    the parameter - dependent minimum time problem @xmath2 we study is given by @xmath3 \\label{eq:4r}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and is constrained to @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 are two given points .",
    "the parameter @xmath1 is in @xmath7 , the state space is @xmath8 ( but the result can be easily generalised to the case when the state space is a smooth finite dimensional manifold ) and all the data are assumed to be smooth , say @xmath9 .",
    "we study two different kinds of strong local optimality of a triplet @xmath10 which is admissible for @xmath2 according to the following definitions    the trajectory @xmath11 \\to { \\r^n}$ ] is a _ ( time , state)local minimiser _ of @xmath2 if there is a neighbourhood @xmath12 of its graph in @xmath13 and @xmath14 such that @xmath15 is a minimiser among the admissible trajectories whose graphs are in @xmath12 and whose final time is greater than @xmath16 , independently of the values of the associated controls .",
    "we point out that this kind of optimality is local both with respect to time and space .",
    "a _ stronger version _ of strong local optimality is the so  called _ state  local optimality _ which is defined as follows :    the trajectory @xmath15 is a _ state",
    " local minimiser _ of @xmath2 if there is a neighbourhood @xmath17 of its range in @xmath18 such that @xmath15 is a minimiser among the admissible trajectories whose range is in @xmath17 , independently of the values of the associated controls .    for the nominal problem ( @xmath19 )",
    ", we assume the coercivity of a suitable second variation along the singular arc and regularity both of the bang arcs and of the junction points , thus obtaining the strict state local optimality for the given bang - singular - bang extremal , and a suitable controllability assumption along the singular arc only , see section [ sec : assnominal ] .",
    "under these assumptions we shall prove that , for any sufficiently small @xmath20 , there is a bang - singular - bang extremal trajectory @xmath15 which is a strict strong local optimiser for problem @xmath2 .",
    "moreover , if @xmath21 is the costate associated to @xmath15 , then there exists a neighbourhood @xmath22 of the graph of the nominal pair @xmath23 such that @xmath24 is the only extremal pair of @xmath2 whose graph is in @xmath22 .",
    "the results are proven via the hamiltonian approach to optimal control and by taking advantage of the implicit function theorem .",
    "thus the trajectory @xmath15 and its switching times depend smoothly on the parameter @xmath1 , so that a sensitivity analysis could also be carried out .    for the regular cases we refer to @xcite and the references therein . for control",
    "affine dynamics we mention @xcite where bang - bang extremals for the nominal problem are considered .",
    "bang - singular - bang extremals for the mayer problem are studied also in @xcite where the author , under suitable assumptions , shows that if the perturbed problem has an extremal which is some sense _ near _ the reference one , then this extremal has the same bang - singular - bang structure .",
    "we assume we are given a reference triplet @xmath25 which is a normal bang  singular  bang pontryagin extremal for the nominal problem @xmath26 that is @xmath27 has the following structure @xmath28 \\ , .",
