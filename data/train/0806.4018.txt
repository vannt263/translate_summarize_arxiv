    "the jisp16 @xmath6 interaction is good enough and provides reliable predictions for energies of levels in all @xmath160 and @xmath159 shell nuclei @xcite .",
    "however , there are small differences between jisp16 level energy predictions and experiment ; these differences are of the same order as the differences between the @xmath0-matrix @xmath171 values and our no - core shell model results .",
    "probably we shall use the @xmath0-matrix results discussed above while attempting to design a new improved version of the jisp16 interaction by trying to eliminate the discrepancy between the shell model results and the @xmath0-matrix analysis of nucleon-@xmath151 scattering .",
    "of course , the @xmath0-matrix can be used to relate the shell model energies and data on nucleon scattering by other nuclei .",
    "generally , one can also use other elastic scattering data , for example , nucleus - nucleus elastic scattering phase shifts to get the @xmath90 values that should be obtained in the shell model studies of the respective compound nuclear systems : the shell model must generate the states with the same energies in the same model space and with the same @xmath2 value to have a chance to generate the experimental phase shifts .",
