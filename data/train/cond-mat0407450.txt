    "nanoscale inhomogeneities have been widely observed in the high temperature superconductor ( hts ) bi@xmath1sr@xmath1cacu@xmath1o@xmath2(bscco ) , primarily through scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) experiments performed in the superconducting state.@xcite at present , the origins of the inhomogeneity are not well understood , although it is very plausible that they are directly correlated with variations in the local doping concentration . in bscco ,",
    "the hole concentration is controlled by the addition of interstitial oxygen atoms which appear to reside @xmath3 above the conducting cuo@xmath1 layers .",
    "because of the short distance , large spatial fluctuations of the coulomb potential are expected in the cuo@xmath1 layers , especially in underdoped samples where screening is poor . in stm experiments ( which do not measure local doping directly ) ,",
    "nanoscale inhomogeneities are manifested most strongly in the magnitude @xmath4 of the superconducting gap in the tunneling spectrum .",
    "interestingly , regions with small @xmath4 exhibit large coherence peaks at the gap edge , while the coherence peaks are essentially missing in regions with @xmath5 mev .",
    "these latter regions are assumed to represent an underdoped `` pseudogap '' phase which may be quite distinct from the small - gap `` superconducting '' ( sc ) regions .",
    "though speculative , this labelling is supported by the fact that the `` pseudogap '' regions occupy a large fraction of the strongly underdoped samples , and relatively little of the optimally doped samples.@xcite    the simplest model of the inhomogeneities is that the pairing energy depends strongly on doping,@xcite with the `` pseudogap '' domains corresponding to regions of large pairing energy which are nonsuperconducting because of phase fluctuations .",
    "it is also possible that secondary phases may coexist with the sc state , forming spontaneously , or perhaps being nucleated in hole - poor domains .",
    "theoretical calculations from the early days of high - temperature superconductivity@xcite suggest the possibility of self - organized stripe formation , and in some materials ( notably la@xmath6nd@xmath7sr@xmath8cuo@xmath9@xcite ) there is solid evidence for stripes , though it has generally been hard to substantiate in other materials .",
    "a large variety of other competing or coexisting phases have been discussed since the discovery of hts , and the list includes charge density wave ( cdw),@xcite spin peierls,@xcite antiferromagnetic or spin density wave,@xcite pair density wave,@xcite , staggered flux@xcite , and orbital current@xcite phases .",
    "experimentally , optimally - doped bscco@xcite appears to support a fairly straightforward @xmath0-wave bcs picture of superconductivity rather well , @xcite although similar experiments@xcite have been interpreted in terms of commensurate stripe formation with a periodicity of @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the lattice constant . at lower doping ,",
    "other recent work@xcite finds weak `` checkerboard '' charge modulations with a periodicity close to that measured in refs .",
    "[ ] , with the weight of the modulations being reduced as the doping increases .",
    "however , the situation is not transparent since the modulations are only seen at energies larger than the gap edge ( contrary to what one might expect in a stripe scenario ) , are only seen in the `` pseudogap '' regions , and the modulation wavelength is comparable to the typical size of the `` pseudogap '' domains .",
    "there is a further ambiguity in determining what , if any , ordering is present : many ordered phases ( eg .  antiferromagnetism ) which may be relevant to bscco couple weakly to the local charge density and are not easily identified in stm experiments .",
    "thus , it is not clear whether the weak charge modulations seen in experiments are the dominant ordering , or whether they are secondary manifestations of some hidden order . for these reasons",
    ", it may be difficult to detect and study coexisting order based on spatial modulations of the local density of states ( ldos ) alone .",
    "the goal of the present work is to look for signatures of inhomogeneously coexisting order in the energy dependence of the local spectrum . for definiteness",
    ", i adopt a model in which antiferromagnetic ( af ) correlations compete with sc order . from a calculational perspective , this is the simplest and least ambiguous choice , although other order parameters  particularly cdw order ( including checkerboard order)are also potentially relevant to the stm experiments cited above .",
    "many of the results of this paper will actually apply broadly to other forms of competing order , and i will try distinguish these results from those which are specific to antiferromagnetism .",
    "having said this , i want to remark that antiferromagnetism is a natural choice to make given the proximity of the af and sc phases in the hts phase diagram , and that other authors have studied similar models.@xcite in addition , there is mounting evidence that glassy ( short - ranged ) quasistatic af correlations are significant in underdoped hts,@xcite including bscco,@xcite and it is important to understand how these correlations are manifested in the ldos .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec2a ] , i introduce the model , and perform calculations for a finite - sized , inhomogeneously doped @xmath0-wave superconductor with competing af and sc order . short range",
    "af order arises naturally in the current work because the system is doped inhomogeneously by charged out - of - plane donors and af moments form preferentially in underdoped regions . at low doping levels ,",
    "i find that the self - consistently determined electronic state resembles a  pinned smectic \" in which superconductivity is pronounced along domain walls of the af background . at higher doping , there is a crossover to a fairly homogeneous @xmath0-wave sc state with occasional pockets of af order . in all cases , there is a well defined @xmath0-wave gap in the spectrum .",
    "since the spectral energy resolution suffers from finite - size effects , i discuss the ldos in the context of a single underdoped pocket embedded in a homogeneous @xmath0-wave superconductor in sec.[sec2b ] .",
    "several spectral features measured in [ ] , notably the suppression of coherence peaks , the appearance of shoulders in the spectrum , and the homogeneity of the low energy spectrum , can be understood in these calculations , although no single parameter set reproduces simultaneously all the experimentally measured spectral features .",
    "one of the most important conclusions of this section is that , because of the nonlocality of quasiparticles , the local spectrum of an af pocket resembles neither that of macroscopic antiferromagnets or superconductors ( nor is it an average of the two ) : the introduction of inhomogeneity on the nanometer length scales leads to a qualitatively new spectrum .",
    "this is a significant finding since one of the main arguments against coexisting secondary phases is that , apart from the special case of a nested fermi surface , any _ macroscopic _ ordering which is commensurate with the lattice has a spectrum which is not particle - hole symmetric , in contradiction with experiments .",
    "i find , however , that inhomogeneous ordering on nanometer length scales _ may _ , in fact , yield a particle - hole symmetric spectrum .",

    "the average hole density is @xmath51 holes / site , but the hole distribution is quite inhomogeneous . in a homogeneously doped sample with @xmath42 and @xmath41",

    "it is worth stressing that this behavior is very different from single - phase models in which the magnitude of the local order parameter is directly correlated with the local charge density,@xcite regardless of the size of the domain .",
    "note also that , although the doped and undoped regions in fig .",
    "[ fig_1 ] lie firmly on either side of the first order phase transition separating af and sc phases , both order parameters are finite throughout the system because of a pronounced proximity effect . in this sense",
    ", the introduction of disorder in the doping leads to a qualitative change in the phase diagram .",
    "this aspect of the calculations appears to be consistent with neutron scattering studies in lsco@xcite suggesting that af and sc coexist locally .",
    "one factor which appears inconsistent with experiment is that the @xmath0-wave order parameter is suppressed by static af correlations , whereas there is good evidence that it actually grows rapidly as the insulating phase is approached in hts .",
    "this disparity may be the result of the simplicity of the current mean - field approximation . in a more sophisticated treatment , the suppression of sc order",
    "will be compensated to some extent by the fact that the pairing interaction is doping dependent : numerical studies of the @xmath55-@xmath56 model@xcite find that @xmath57 .",
    "since this result was originally derived for homogeneous systems , and can not be trivially extended to inhomogeneous systems ( but should not change our conclusions qualitatively ) , i will defer its discussion rather than introduce an _ ad hoc _ local renormalisation of @xmath56 .    .",
    "the color scales are identical for all panels within a row , and are the same as in fig .",
    "[ fig_1](a ) and ( c ) . ]    figure [ fig_2 ] shows how the coexisting phases evolve with hole doping . at low doping",
    ", the situation qualitatively resembles a pinned smectic .",
    "smectic phases have been proposed as a natural mechanism by which doped antiferromagnets can accomodate holes while minimizing both the hole kinetic , antiferromagnetic exchange , and long range coulomb energies.@xcite consistent with the smectic picture , the af moments in fig .  [ fig_2 ]",
    "spontaneously form @xmath58-shifted domains whose boundaries are pinned to donor - impurity locations , and the sc order parameter @xmath59 is largest along the domain walls .",
    "however , there are a number of differences between the current `` weak coupling '' mean - field calculations and the canonical `` strong - coupling '' smectic picture . first , because of frustration introduced by next - nearest neighbor hopping , the af phase is never fully polarized .",
    "this same frustration leads to a gapless quasiparticle spectrum in the pure af phase provided @xmath31 is less than some model - dependent critical value . as a consequence ,",
    "holes are not confined to domain walls but are mobile throughout the volume of the sample . in other words , although there are static af correlations , the system is on the metallic side of the metal - insulator transition .",
    "a further consequence , which distinguishes weak and strong - coupling approaches , is that the sc order parameter remains finite everywhere in the weak - coupling calculations .",
    "as hole doping increases , the af phase is suppressed through a proliferation of domain walls . in fig .",
    "[ fig_2 ] , significant af moments form at higher doping only in regions where , due to randomness in the donor - atom distribution , undoped regions have diameters larger than @xmath60 .",
    "the system is then better understood as consisting of isolated af pockets embedded in a relatively homogeneous @xmath0-wave superconductor . in this model , annealing ( which tends to homogenize the charge distribution ) will have significant effect on the extent of af order .",
    "figure [ fig_2 ] also shows the spatially averaged density of states @xmath61 for each of the disorder configurations .",
    "although the data is noisy , several clear features are evident : first , as one underdopes , there is a gradual suppression of spectral weight on an energy scale which is large relative to the sc gap .",
    "second , there is a robust @xmath0-wave gap , even in situations where a large fraction of the sample is antiferromagnetic .",
    "i emphasize that this latter effect is not necessarily anticipated since , in the absence of a nested fermi surface , af ordering tends to destroy the particle - hole symmetry of the spectrum .",
    "third , as one underdopes , the superconducting coherence peaks are suppressed . as discussed in the introduction ,",
    "the suppression of coherence peaks is one of the hallmarks of the pseudogap phase of the underdoped cuprates . to my knowledge , this is the first reproduction of such an effect in terms of a static mean field model .",
    "these results are rather encouraging and , ideally , the next step should be a detailed examination of the ldos .",
    "however , finite size effects limit the spectral resolution to the extent that the ldos is impossible to interpret .",
    "consequently , i will focus for the remainder of the paper on intermediate doping levels where one can improve the energy resolution by studying isolated underdoped pockets embedded in a large superconducting domain .",
    "a more detailed exploration of the pinned smectic phase requires a different approach and is , unfortunately , beyond the scope of this work .",
    "it is difficult to discuss the stm spectrum in detail for finite - sized lattices because of the discreteness of the spectrum . for a @xmath62 lattice",
    ", one might typically have @xmath63 subgap states , with the resulting spectrum being too noisy for anything other than the grossest analysis .",
    "i therefore study a single , isolated , af pocket which is embedded in a homogeneous background potential corresponding to a hole doping level of @xmath64 ( in fact , the hole doping level is less important than the fermi surface shape , and should not be taken too seriously ) . in this calculation",

    "the particle - hole asymmetry at large energies comes from a van hove singularity at @xmath81 . at lower energies ,",
    "the spectrum is determined by the interplay between sc and af order .",
    "there are several noteworthy features of this calculation .",
    "first , there is an overall suppression of spectral weight at site @xmath18 on an energy scale @xmath82 . for a nested fermi surface , with homogeneous magnetization",
    ", @xmath83 is the energy of the af gap , but in the absence of nesting , af correlations lead to a shift of states away from the fermi level even when a true gap does not open .",
    "this shift is a precursor to the formation of lower and upper hubbard bands , and is consistent with the observation of spectral weight shifts on a large energy scale as a function of doping in the cuprates .",
    "two factors tend to suppress the nucleated moment : the frustration introduced by the next - nearest neighbor hopping ( ie .",
    "the absence of complete nesting of the fermi surfaces ) , and the competition with the superconducting phase .",
    "i want to emphasize a consequence of this which may not be intuitive : although a large @xmath31 may not generate a substantial moment @xmath54 , the energy scale @xmath84 over which the quasiparticle spectrum is affected by magnetic correlations can still be quite large .",
    "this is likely to be a universal feature of models of competing order in the cuprates .",
    "one could similarly imagine that , in a model with a charge ordered phase , frustration due to imperfect fermi surface nesting and competition with sc order would tend to suppress the magnitude of charge modulations but still affect the spectrum over a relatively large energy scale .    a second feature of fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] is that the local dispersion in the af pocket near the fermi level is quasilinear when @xmath85 [ fig .",
    "[ fig_3](a ) ] .",
    "this is a significant result since one of the main arguments against coexisting commensurate order in the cuprates is the absence of a linear dispersion at the fermi level . when @xmath86 , the ldos becomes particle - hole asymmetric : as @xmath83 increases ( either as one moves into the af pocket , or as one turns up @xmath31 ) , a shoulder develops in the dispersion at low energies , which ultimately evolves into a well - defined resonance [ fig .",
    "[ fig_3](b ) ] .",
    "the energy of the resonance depends on the details of the band structure , and on @xmath87 , but is a universal feature in nearly all numerical results .",
    "one of the most interesting aspects of fig .",
    "[ fig_3 ] is the evolution of the coherence peaks between the sc and af regions .",
    "there are actually two qualitatively different ways in which this occurs . in figs .",
    "[ fig_3](a ) and ( b ) , the coherence peaks shift to lower energies , sharpen , and lose spectral weight as one moves into the af domain .",
    "the coherence peak positions approximately reflect the local value of @xmath87 , which is what one might naively expect for a smoothly varying hamiltonian .",
    "the situation is different in fig .",
    "[ fig_3](c ) where the magnetization is larger : the coherence peaks ( starting at a point exterior to the af domain and moving inwards ) rapidly collapse , but shift rather little .",
    "the absence of a shift indicates that one is seeing the decaying tails of bulk bcs - like states .",
    "in other words , antinodal quasiparticles from the sc domain _ tunnel _ ( rather than propagate freely ) into the af domain , and decay over some characteristic distance which determines the extent of the coherence peaks into the af domain .",
    "i will argue below that this arises from a mismatch in the sc and af energy dispersions : when @xmath84 is sufficiently large , the states at the antinodal @xmath88-vector are gapped in the af domain .    the fact that the coherence peaks sharpen as one moves into the af region in fig .",
    "[ fig_3](a ) and ( b ) is the result of the fact that the fermi surfaces nest at isolated points ( the contours @xmath89 and @xmath90 shown in fig .  [ fig_4 ] intersect at two points ) . because of this peculiar nesting ,",
    "spectral weight is removed at energies both above and below the antinodal saddle point energy ( the point which generates the coherence peaks ) by the af correlations , but the saddle point itself survives until the af moment becomes very large .",
    "thus , the coherence peaks lose weight by narrowing rather than by being suppressed . other competing phases ( such as charge density waves ) which nest differently should have a qualitatively different effect on the coherence peaks .    one surprising aspect of fig .",
    "[ fig_3](b ) and ( c ) is that although the transition from sc to af domains occurs differently depending on the magnetization , the spectrum at the core of the af pocket is quite similar . for comparison , a non - self - consistent calculation is shown in fig .  [ fig_3](d ) for the ansatz @xmath91 with @xmath92 .",
    "again , the spectrum at the core of the af disk is quite similar to that of the self - consistent calculations shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_3](b ) and ( c ) .",
    "( note the similarity in the peak positions ) , but bears little resemblance to the spectrum of the macroscopic af phase shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_3](h ) .",
    "this calculation demonstrates that the boundary conditions ( the coupling between the af pocket and the sc bulk ) have as large an impact on the local spectrum at the core of the af pocket as the local value of the sc order parameter .",
    "this is a central result : when the scale of the inhomogeneity is atomic , one can not assume a direct correspondence between the local ordering and the local spectrum .",

    "fourth , it suggests that because af nesting does little to disrupt the band structure near the nodal points , there will be a much smaller fermi surface discontinuity for nodal quasiparticles crossing between sc and af domains than for antinodal quasiparticles .",
    "this mechanism is one possible explanation for relative uniformity of the low energy spectrum measured in stm experiments when compared with the spectrum near the gap edge .",

    "for example , a charge density wave which nests between parallel antinodal sections of the fermi surface may gap out the coherence peaks for any degree of ordering .",

    "weak charge modulations have been observed in underdoped bscco,@xcite sparking an ongoing debate as to the extent to which spatial modulations of the ldos can distinguish friedel oscillations of quasiparticles from a tendency towards charge - ordering . in this section",
    "i will address two slightly different questions which arise from this debate .",
    "first , i will discuss charge ordering in the context of the current calculations .",
    "second , i will discuss the broader question of the extent to which a hidden order ( an order which does not couple directly to the charge ) can be revealed by quasiparticle scattering .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2a ] , the self - consistent calculations show that a large charge inhomogeneity occurs in the hole - doped domains , and arises because of randomness in the impurity locations .",
    "in contrast , the undoped domains are remarkably homogeneous simply because they are free from impurities .",
    "the charge inhomogeneities are not particularly evident at energies near the fermi level , but become apparent at large energies .",
    "the calculations do not find a local charge ordering , although the kind of weak modulations seen in ref .",
    "[ ] would be difficult to see on the finite - size lattices used in numerical calculations . even if the current calculations do not admit charge ordering , it is likely that only minor modifications to eq .",
    "( [ hu ] ) are needed to generate charge - ordered phases . by analogy with the self - consistent solutions for the af phase",
    ", one would expect that these charge ordered phases would coexist with superconductivity throughout the system because of the proximity effect .",
    "this is in contrast to experiments in bscco,@xcite however , which see ordered charge modulations only in  pseudogap \" domains . a resolution to this puzzle",
    "may be the fact that the charge distribution is uniform in underdoped domains , but is disordered in hole - doped domains .",
    "if the cdw order parameter is easily pinned by donor atoms , then it may also be locally suppressed by donor - related disorder .",
    "the second question is whether hidden order can be revealed through the fourier transformed density of states of a disordered superconductor . in order to get some sense of how disorder affects the ldos , i return to the model of homogeneously coexisting order described in the previous section .",
    "i calculate the response kernel,@xcite @xmath120,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which describes the effects of scattering from impurities on the fourier transformed density of states @xmath121 .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_5 ] . at low @xmath116",
    ", @xmath122 is similar for both coexisting order and for the pure @xmath0-wave superconductor while , at higher energies , the effects of antiferromagnetism become significant . at @xmath118 ( the energy of the saddle point marked `` a '' in fig .",
    "[ fig_4 ] ) the pronounced resonances along the @xmath123 and @xmath124 directions are split by the antiferromagnetism .",
    "one surprising result of these calculations is that @xmath122 differs significantly from the pure @xmath0-wave result even for energies much larger than @xmath84 , suggesting that the effects of even weak ordering should be easily visible . at the same time , however , there is no obvious signature of the af @xmath125-vector in the response kernel at most energies .",
    "in other words , af ordering distorts the response kernel from the bare kernel , but does so in a nontrivial way .",
    "in particular , all features in @xmath122 disperse with @xmath116 .",
    "thus , it appears that unless the nucleated order couples directly to the charge density , it will generally be difficult to distinguish different kinds of order from the fourier transformed density of states .",
    "i have studied a mean - field extended hubbard model in which charge is doped inhomogeneously because of randomness in the donor - atom positions . af and sc order compete , and in the homogeneous case , are separated by a first order phase transition .",
    "self - consistent calculations find that , because of inhomogeneity in the local doping , af order coexists inhomogeneously with superconductivity .",
    "the af moments spontaneously form @xmath58-shifted domain walls which are pinned to donor - atom sites . at low doping , the self - consistent solutions resemble pinned smectics , ie .  quasi - one - dimensional superconductors running along af domain walls . because of the proximity effect , both sc and af correlations are actually present throughout the lattice .",
    "this picture appears to be consistent with neutron scattering studies in lsco,@xcite suggesting that af and sc order coexist , and naturally explains the field - dependence of the af moment , since any suppression of superconductivity by a magnetic field will enhance the af moment .    at higher doping ,",
    "the self - consistent calculations evolve towards a homogeneous @xmath0-wave superconductor interspersed with underdoped pockets with large af moments .",
    "this latter `` phase - separated '' system superficially resembles the situation in bscco , although it is generally unclear whether the `` pseudogap '' domains in bscco have any kind of nucleated secondary phase . to address this question",
    ", i studied the local spectrum of a single , isolated af pocket embedded in a homogeneous sc background .",
    "while no single calculated spectrum reproduces all details of the experimental measurements , several features such as the collapse of the coherence peaks , the occurence of low - energy spectral features , and the relative homogeneity of the low energy spectrum , are broadly consistent with the kinds of spectra measured in , for example , ref .",
    "certain experimental aspects  notably the presence of weak nondispersing charge modulations  are not reproduced in my calculations .",
    "in general , the calculated spectra at low energies show a richer spectrum of peaks than is observed experimentally .    at this point ,",
    "the effect of disorder on the spectrum of the isolated af pocket is not understood .",
    "earlier studies of point - like defects in @xmath0-wave superconductors show that this may not be a trivial effect .",
    "a single strong - scattering point - like impurity introduces a sharp resonance near the fermi level .",
    "as the disorder level increases , the resonances split , are inhomogeneously broadened , and evolve into an impurity band ( see ref .",
    "[ ] for a recent summary ) .",
    "when the response of the sc order parameter to the disorder is included self - consistently , the sc gap tends to restore itself@xcite by shifting spectral weight away from the fermi level .",
    "indeed , it is a general feature of interacting electrons in disordered media that the system can lower its energy by suppressing the density of states at the fermi level .",
    "further calculations , currently in progress , are needed to establish whether all the spectral features discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec2b ] survive in the disordered limit .    finally ,",
    "although the calculations were performed for a model in which superconductivity and antiferromagnetism compete , i expect many of the findings to apply to other models of competing order .",
    "three results , in particular , are expected to be general . first , when the domain sizes are small ( as they appear to be in bscco ) , the proximity effect is extremely important , and has a significant impact on the local density of states .",
    "it was _ never _ found , in calculations , that the spectrum of the antiferromagnetic pocket resembles that of a bulk antiferromagnet .",
    "rather , a better toy model appears to be one of coexisting homogeneous superconductivity and antiferromagnetism .",
    "second , the gapping of the spectrum near the antinodal points by local ordering is a mean - field mechanism by which coherence peaks may be locally suppressed . up to now",
    ", it has been generally understood that suppression of coherence peaks occurs through strong inelastic scattering at higher energies . for af order",
    ", there is a threshold value of the magnetization for the gapping of the antinodal quasiparticles , but this may not be universal and other kinds of order ( eg .",
    "cdw ) may lead to suppression of coherence peaks for even small ordering .",
    "finally , these calculations also suggest a natural reason that nodal quasiparticles should be less affected than antinodal quasiparticles by charge inhomogneities , since the fermi surface mismatch between domains is smallest for the nodal quasiparticles .",
