    "such a theoretical description is of fundamental importance in understanding practical problems involving granular systems , such as the rupture dynamics of a sheared fault gouge and the nucleation of earthquakes .    in doing so",
    ", we build upon our recent work  @xcite in which we combine the basic elements of the shear - transformation - zone ( stz ) theory of amorphous molecular plasticity @xcite with edwards statistical theory of granular materials @xcite to construct a theory of shear flow in a noncrystalline system of thermalized hard spheres .",
    "the stz theory is based on the premise that irreversible particle rearrangements occur at isolated flow defects ( i.e.  stz s ) ; in deforming systems , stz s are activated fluctuations which appear and disappear in response to thermal or mechanical noise .",

    "the granular material is subject to a shear stress @xmath8 and a confining pressure @xmath9 .",
    "grains can undergo rearrangement or comminution upon the onset of shear stress . ]",
    "the hard - sphere system is a simplified model of a granular material , composed of grains with no internal structure .",
    "real granular systems , however , consists of grains that come in a variety of sizes and shapes .",
    "often , these grains can break apart upon the application of a sufficiently large force , as seen in many simulations and geophysical field observations @xcite .",
    "a theoretical description of grain fragmentation in sheared granular flow should provide plausible explanations to key features of those observations and offer predictive capabilities ; such a theory is clearly of practical utility to the granular physics community at large .",
    "our goal , therefore , is to bridge the gap between macroscopic constitutive laws and microscopic physics of grain fragmentation , by drawing on the familiar concept of disorder from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "specifically , we shall propose an evolution equation that quantifies the breakage process , and combine that with the stz theory of dense , sheared granular flow  @xcite . while the compactivity @xmath6 as defined in eq .",
    "remains a valid measure of the amount of configurational disorder , it is clear that new theoretical elements are needed in order to accurately describe these additional phenomena within our statistical - thermodynamic framework , and to understand the interplay between grain rearrangement and fragmentation processes .",
    "this is the purpose of our present paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is structured as follows .",
    "section ii is devoted to a review of experimental findings and modeling efforts in the literature ; the purpose is to highlight the aspects of observations in experiments and simulations , as well as to examine elements of existing theories , that motivate our theoretical model .",

    "vi , and conclude our theoretical development with an equation of motion for the compactivity @xmath6 in sec .  vii . in sec .",
    "viii , we elucidate some features of the temporal behavior of the shear stress and the characteristic grain size , and discuss the implications of grain size reduction on the energy partition into fracture energy , plastic work and heat dissipation . in sec .",
    "ix we expand our development to describe shear localization , by introducing spatial heterogeneity in the initial conditions , as we did for amorphous , molecular systems  @xcite .",
    "we shall show several different kinds of localization behaviors that can arise , and examine the implication of grain breakage on strain localization .",
    "section x concludes our paper with a summary of our results and a discussion of future directions .",
    "among the many simulations , experiments , and geophysical observations on grain breakage in the literature , mair and abe  @xcite modeled grains as aggregates of particles stuck together with elastic bonds , and used three - dimensional discrete element simulations to study the fragmentation processes in fault gouge ; they found that grain splitting dominates under high normal stress and at small shear strains , while grain abrasion dominates under low normal stress and at large shear strains .",
    "sammis and coworkers  @xcite examined samples of exhumed fault gouge and concluded that the particle size distribution evolves into a self - similar distribution under generic conditions .",
    "these findings indicate that the confining pressure plays an important role in determining the occurrence of grain breakage and the size distribution of particles thus formed .",
    "reches and lockner  @xcite and han et al .",
    "@xcite found that extremely fine gouge particles lubricate the fault , and suggested that grain breakage is a weakening mechanism at seismic slip rates .",
    "reches and lockner additionally found significant strengthening at intermediate slip rates , but they concluded that this strengthening could be traced to factors such as dehydration due to heating as well as agglomeration . on the other hand , mair et al .",
    "@xcite found that grain breakage is a strengthening mechanism for a granular material composed of initially smooth , spherical grains but is neither intrinsically strengthening nor weakening for rough , angular grains ; they attributed the strengthening seen in smooth grains to the increasing angularity as grains break apart .",
    "guo and morgan  @xcite performed distinct element simulations of grains constructed from clusters of circular particles , and found that grain fragmentation could be strengthening or weakening depending on the effect of fragmentation of grain angularity and elongation .",
    "these observations suggest that it is prudent to decouple the effects of grain fragmentation from the strengthening or weakening effects due to particle shape , roughness and friction in a basic theoretical model ; this is the approach that we shall adopt in this paper .",
    "many others ( e.g.  @xcite ) have identified the presence of localization in a sheared granular system ; the particles in the shear band are often a few orders of magnitude smaller than particles outside the shear zone .",
    "these observations point to a feedback between plastic deformation and grain fragmentation within the shear zone ; an attempt to elucidate this feedback mechanism , as well as its implications on shear strength , is of fundamental significance .",
    "there have been few theoretical attempts to model grain breakage and track the temporal evolution of properties characterizing the state of the system . among such attempts ,",
    "the most notable is the work by einav and coworkers  @xcite , who proposed a constitutive model based on the theory of breakage mechanics .",
    "they introduced an internal `` breakage '' variable to characterize the distance of the instantaneous particle size distribution from the ultimate size distribution , and postulated constitutive relations between that quantity and associated thermodynamic potentials within the framework of continuum mechanics . in this manner , they connected the energetics and micromechanics of grain comminution .",
    "the breakage mechanics model was used to compute the stress - strain behavior and quantify the energy budget in sheared fault gouge , and was able to account for permeability reduction in rocks .",
    "lyakhovsky and ben - zion  @xcite further refined the model to describe brittle instability and shear localization as a phase transition between a damaged solid and a granular phase .",
    "this breakage model , however , did not explicitly account for the underlying fundamental physics and the microscopic processes at the grain scale .",
    "neither did the model entail spatial heterogeneities that contribute to shear localization .",
    "after briefly surveying experiments , simulations and theories of grain breakage in the literature , we turn now to our main theoretical development . consider a noncrystalline system of hard grains in contact with a thermal reservoir at fixed temperature @xmath10 .",
    "let @xmath11 denote the thermal energy of this system .",
    "if the grains interact only via contact forces , they have no configurational potential energy and , therefore , no such energy is included in @xmath11 .",
    "denote by @xmath12 the surface energy of all grains ; the total energy of the system is then given by @xmath13 .",
    "suppose that this system is driven in simple ( not pure ) shear by a shear stress @xmath8 and a pressure @xmath9 .",
    "the first law of thermodynamics for this system is @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the plastic shear rate , @xmath2 is the granular configurational entropy introduced above in eq .",
    "( [ eq : compactivity_def ] ) , and the @xmath16 are internal variables that specify the configurational state of the granular subsystem .",
    "let @xmath17 denote the entropy of the reservoir plus the ( quantitatively negligible ) entropy of the kinetic degrees of freedom of the grains .",
    "then @xmath18 and @xmath19 the second law of thermodynamics requires that the total entropy be a non - decreasing function of time : @xmath20 substituting eq .   for @xmath21 into the second law above , and using the fact that each individually variable term in the resulting inequality must be non - negative @xcite , we arrive at the second - law constraints @xmath22 in arriving at these two constraints , we have arranged terms in such a way that terms pertaining to the degrees of freedom that belong to the same subsystem are grouped together .",
    "the dissipation rate @xmath23 , as defined in @xcite , is the difference between the rate at which inelastic work is done on the configurational subsystem and the rate at which energy is stored in the internal degrees of freedom .",
    "the second constraint implies that @xmath24 and @xmath25 must carry the same sign if they are nonzero , so that @xmath26 where @xmath27 is a non - negative thermal transport coefficient .",
    "it is already clear from this analysis that @xmath28 plays the role of a temperature .",
    "@xmath28 approaches @xmath10 in an equilibrating system ; and a heat flux @xmath29 flows from the granular subsystem into the reservoir when the two subsystems are not in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other .",
    "in this section , we repeat the derivation of the stz equations of motion as in  @xcite , but with the additional ingredient that grains may break apart , so that both the characteristic grain size @xmath3 and the number of particles @xmath30 change with time .    at this point , we make the cautionary remark that real granular systems consists of grains with many different sizes and shapes ; one might thus call into question the validity of describing the comminution process in terms of a single characteristic grain size @xmath3 instead of tracking the evolution of the size distribution @xmath31 , which often has the form of a heavy - tail power law  @xcite .",
    "an elementary calculation shows , however , that if the functional form of @xmath31 does not change in the course of the comminution process  as suggested by self - similar nature of the distribution , then the total surface energy @xmath12 scales with the inverse of some characteristic grain size @xmath3 . in the following we shall",
    "therefore only refer to this characteristic grain size for simplicity .    as usual  @xcite , we suppose for simplicity that stz s can be classified as `` plus '' and `` minus '' according to their orientations relative to the applied shear stress .",
    "we let @xmath32 and @xmath33 denote the number of stzs in each of the two orientations , and let @xmath34 denote the density and orientational bias of stz s , where @xmath35 is the number of grains , now a function of the characteristic grain size @xmath3 : @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath5 denote the excess volume per stz .",
    "then the total volume @xmath1 is the sum of the constant volume @xmath37 of grain material plus the configurational volume associated with structural defects : @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the volume and entropy of all configurational degrees of freedom of the granular system not associated with stz s , and @xmath41 is the entropy associated with the stz s .",
    "then , under the assumption the stz s are two - state entities , we can compute @xmath41 easily by counting the number of possible configurations of distributing @xmath32 and @xmath33 stz s of each orientation among @xmath30 sites  @xcite .",

    ", there is a factor of @xmath48 up front .    in eq .",
    ", @xmath49 , where @xmath50 denotes the material density of the grains , is the inertial time scale that characterizes the typical duration of a pressure - driven particle rearrangement event  @xcite ; it is proportional to the average time between successive grain - grain collisions .",
    "this time scale also applies in a dense granular medium where inter - particle friction is important , as long as the friction is proportional to the normal force at the contact interface .",
    "its product with the shear rate @xmath15 gives the so - called inertial number , the magnitude of which determines the flow regime of dense granular flow  @xcite . @xmath51",
    "represent the rates ( in units of @xmath52 ) at which the stz s are making forward and backward transitions .",
    "the term proportional to @xmath53 represents the rates of stz creation and annihilation ; @xmath54 is the steady - state , total number of stz s .",
    "@xmath55 is an attempt frequency consisting of additive thermal and mechanical parts : @xmath56 the quantity @xmath57 is best understood as a dimensionless , thermal noise strength . in systems composed of aggregate grains that we presently consider , @xmath57 is associated with the acoustic - vibrational motion of the grains  @xcite ; vibration provides a means to un - jam a granular system so that it can explore packing configurations . in granular experiments ,",
    "acoustic vibrations have been found to trigger compaction and stick - slip events  @xcite , or cause a transition from a disordered to a crystalline state  @xcite . when @xmath58 , the system is fully jammed in the sense that configurational rearrangements can occur only in response to sufficiently large driving forces .",
    "if the grains are extremely fine , with size of the order of several nanometers , thermal fluctuations alone may be able to unjam the system ; in such a case @xmath59 .    in analogy to @xmath60 , the quantity",
    "@xmath61 is the contribution to the attempt frequency in eq .",
    "( [ eq : master ] ) due to externally applied shear .",
    "it will be computed below in eq .   in terms of the rate of entropy generation .",
    "bearing in mind that the grain size @xmath3 and hence the total number of grains @xmath62 are now dynamical variables ( the equation of motion for @xmath3 will be specified in the next section ) , the stz equations of motion for the intensive state variables @xmath63 and @xmath64 can be written as : @xmath65 where @xmath66 is independent of @xmath3 , and @xmath67 . in writing eq .",
    "we have implicitly made the approximation @xmath68 and @xmath69 in eq .",
    "so that @xmath70 in eq .  .",
    "we also define @xmath71 and @xmath72",
    "at this point we introduce the evolution equation for the characteristic grain size @xmath3 ; it will be derived based upon basic principles and dimensional analysis alone .",
    "first , it is natural to expect that the rate at which grain comminution occurs is directly proportional to the plastic work per unit volume @xmath73 done by the imposed shear , that being the only external source of energy .",
    "this hypothesis is supported by the observation  @xcite that shearing significantly reduces the compressive load necessary to fracture grains , because shear motion continuously reconfigures force chains and generates exceptionally high local contact forces which ultimately result in grain crushing .",
    "then the evolution equation for @xmath3 must be of the form @xmath74 here , @xmath75 is a dimensionless quantity that specifies the fraction of plastic work expended in the creation of new grain surfaces , and @xmath76 is a quantity with the dimensions of energy per unit volume .",
    "the factor @xmath3 on the right - hand side has been inserted for obvious dimensional reasons .",
    "it is clear that @xmath75 is a function of the pressure @xmath9 .",
    "it ought to reflect the existence of a threshold confining pressure @xmath77 below which grain fragmentation is rare ; experiments such as @xcite suggest that this pressure is of the order of 25 mpa",
    ". it must also reflect the fact that grain breakage below some threshold grain size rarely occurs .",
    "thus we expect that @xmath78 where @xmath79 is a constant .",
    "the threshold pressure can be estimated using fracture mechanics as the stress necessary to fracture a grain with a characteristic flaw size proportional to its size @xmath3  @xcite ; thus @xmath80 where @xmath81 is the young modulus of the grain material . for quartz sand grains with typical young modulus @xmath82 gpa , @xmath83 j m@xmath84 , and @xmath85 m , @xmath86 mpa , roughly equal to the pressure above which grain breakage is pervasive . notice",
    "that @xmath87 as the pressure decreases towards zero , as it should",
    ". the characteristic grain size below which grain breakage becomes unlikely is then @xmath88 .",
    "we propose that @xmath76 may simply be proportional to the surface energy @xmath89 per unit new area .",
    "dimensional analysis now implies that @xmath90 , so that @xmath91 note that eq .",
    "involves a direct comparison of the plastic work done by the shear stress per unit volume , and the grain surface energy per unit volume .",
    "eq .  , as written , suggests that @xmath92 never vanishes as long as the plastic strain rate is nonzero ; however , the dynamics of @xmath3 becomes exponentially slow once @xmath93 , suggesting that abrasion dominates in that regime , in conformity with the simulations of mair and abe  @xcite , as we shall see below .",
    "as for the third term , we have @xmath110 the two factors on the left - hand side must be monotonically increasing functions of @xmath8 that change sign at the same point for arbitrary values of @xmath64 . according to eq .",

    "( see for example @xcite . )",
    "we also have introduced the dimensionless compactivity @xmath131 .",
    "the dimensionless compactivity @xmath132 , introduced above , measures the amount of configurational ( i.e.   structural ) disorder in the granular system .",
    "when the system is completely jammed , i.e.  @xmath121 , externally applied shear constitute the only means to `` stir '' the system and cause granular rearrangement ; in such a case , the steady - state compactivity ought to be a function of the strain rate alone : @xmath133 .",
    "it should approach some constant in the limit of small @xmath130 , and should become a rapidly increasing function of @xmath130 once the shear rate becomes comparable to the rate of intrinsic structural relaxation .",
    "a deeper discussion of the quantity @xmath134 can be found in  @xcite ; for our purposes it suffices to write the inverse relation @xmath135 in the vogel - fulcher - tamann ( vft ) form @xmath136 , \\ ] ] where @xmath137    the quantity @xmath132 evolves according to the first law of thermodynamics . remembering the @xmath138 is dimensionless and dependent on the time - dependent grain size @xmath3 , and that the compactivity @xmath0 , having the dimensions of volume , is the more fundamental temperature - like quantity , we see that it is necessary to return to the extensive variable for the time being , to deduce the equation of motion for the compactivity based on concepts of energy flow . to this end , note that @xmath139 here @xmath140 can be interpreted as an effective volume expansion coefficient . because @xmath1 is independent of the number of grains @xmath141 , and @xmath142 , we have @xmath143 , as it should ( see also the remark following eq .  ) , so that @xmath144 . then @xmath145 in arriving at the last expression , we used eq .",

    "we also used the fact that @xmath150 , with @xmath40 being indepedent of the @xmath16 degrees of freedom , to write @xmath151 .",
    "furthermore , we used the smallness of @xmath63 to drop the residual term proportional to @xmath101 .",
    "@xmath27 is the thermal transport coefficient that first appeared in eq .  .",
    "we now specialize to athermal situations for which we may set @xmath152 , and compute @xmath27 based on knowledge about the steady state in @xmath132 : @xmath133 . because @xmath153 , @xmath154 does not imply @xmath155 ; rather , @xmath156 with this in mind , we substitute @xmath157 into eq .   and set @xmath154 there .",

    "the spirit of this simplification is to permit us capture the key qualitative features of the effect of grain fragmentation , without specifying model - specific ingredients such as deformation by rolling and slipping , that the rate factor might depend on .",

    "shear banding was previously exhibited in amorphous , molecular solids within the stz framework  @xcite ; there is no analog of grain comminution in molecular glasses , and a model of strain localization in granular materials ought to be able to predict the inception of a finely granulated layer upon the onset of shear deformation .",

    "[ fig : ayplotf51 ] shows that grains in the shear band are subject to intense fragmentation , while those away from the shear band are not affected , in conformity with experimental and field observations . at a shear strain of @xmath239 , the characteristic grain size at the middle of the shear band",
    "roughly equals @xmath240 m , which is @xmath241 the grain size at the edge of the material .",

    "[ fig : xyplotf51b ] which shows that configurational disorder slowly diffuses across the material in the absence grain breakage .",
    "we propose to explain these observations in terms of the lubrication effect that small particles have on the rolling motion of large particles  @xcite .",
    "the initial condition for @xmath178 is inhomogeneous ; there is a spike at the middle axis , @xmath243 , of the material .",
    "this implies that upon the onset of plastic deformation , the plastic strain rate @xmath15 is larger at @xmath243 . since the rate of grain size reduction , eq .",
    ", is proportional to the amount of plastic work per unit volume , this heterogeneity enhances grain fragmentation about the center of the material .",
    "the smaller grains produced at the center lubricate the surrounding grains , causing the diffusion of configurational disorder via the diffusion term in eq .   and promoting slip motion .",
    "the corresponding increase in the plastic strain rate nearby intensifies grain fragmentation and causes the spread of the width of the comminuted region .",
    "however , the diffusion length scale , proportional to @xmath217 , sharply decreases as a result of grain size reduction .",
    "in addition , the sharp grain size gradient at the interface between the comminuted and uncomminuted regions provides lubrication and shields the large grains from fracturing .",
    "these effects slow down the diffusion of configurational disorder across the entire width of the material .",
    "said differently , the large grains just outside of the shear band , now lubricated by the fine grains at the edge of the shear band , move in concert with the uncomminuted grains far away from the shear band .",
    "the plastic strain rate in the uncomminuted region is therefore zero ; since the diffusion coefficient in eq .",
    "is proportional to the strain rate , diffusion of disorder stops . from this point on , plastic",
    "deformation and grain fragmentation is confined within the shear band ; the shear band diffuses very slowly outward , if at all .",
    "configurational disorder is now uniformly distributed within the shear band with @xmath242 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xyplotf51 ] ) , but particles at the middle of the shear band , @xmath243 , are smaller than those nearby ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ayplotf51 ] ) . according to eq .",
    "and the remarks that follow , the stz time scale @xmath244 is proportional to the characteristic grain size @xmath3 ; thus , with the same amount of configurational disorder , the plastic strain rate @xmath15 increases with decreasing grain size .",
    "this accounts for a higher plastic strain rate at the middle of the shear band than closer to its edge .",
    "we noted above that at a shear strain of @xmath239 , the grain size at the center of the shear band equals 5 @xmath236 m , which is below the grind limit given above in sec .",
    "v. therefore , grain comminution slows down appreciably , granular rearrangement becomes the dominant dissipative mechanism , and the shear band appears to be long - lived .    while not shown here , the width of the finely comminuted shear band decreases upon decreasing @xmath180 , the initial amount of configurational disorder ( or configurational dilatation ) , within the disorder - limited shear localization regime .",
    "there is yet another class of shear localization phenomena for which there is no well - defined boundary between the intensely comminuted region and the surrounding material ; the entire granular system experiences grain fragmentation , though the extent of fragmentation depends on the distance from the central shear band .",
    "the shear band , whose width is a function of the initial conditions , persists at large shear strains ; relaxtion to homogeneous deformation occurs extremely slowly .",
    "in addition , the dimensionless compactivity @xmath132 equilibrates to @xmath200 , the steady - state value , across the entire material .",
    "this kind of scenario arises primarily when the initial compactivity is somewhat large , and occasionally when the shear rate is sufficiently fast .    in this subsection",
    ", we start with a material with identical initial shear stress , confining pressure and grain size as the one in subsection a in which disorder - limited shear localization occurred ",
    "i.e. ,  @xmath245 pa , @xmath173 mpa , and @xmath246 mm  but with less aging and more configurational disorder . thus @xmath247 with @xmath248 , @xmath249 , and @xmath229 .",
    "in addition , we impose a higher strain rate @xmath177 s@xmath166 .",
    "we explore the implication of grain fragmentation on flow rheology at this large shear rate ; we also examine the effect of strain localization by numerically integrating the stz equations of motion , eqs .  ,   and  , in the case of homogeneous flow , where we set @xmath250 , and compare that to the spatially heterogeneous solution .",
    "figure  [ fig : sxplotf65 ] in the previous section shows that at this fast shear rate , grain fragmentation significantly softens the material , independent of strain localization .",
    "this validates the observation by han et al .",
    "@xcite that fine particles lubricate gouge material and result in significant flow stress reduction at fast shear rates .",
    "the same figure also shows that strain localization provides another weakening mechanism by lowering the peak stress .",
    "( color online ) variation of characteristic grain size @xmath3 across the width of the material , at various accumulated shear strains @xmath164 , for a diffusion - limited shear band .",
    "the perturbation to the initial configurational disorder does result in the formation of a comminuted zone whose width is about @xmath251 of the whole material , but the surrounding region also experiences continuous grain fragmentation , though to a somewhat lesser extent . at a shear strain of @xmath252 , the grain size at the middle of the shear band and at the edge of the material equal 6.5 @xmath236 m and 16 @xmath236 m , respectively . ]",
    "the temporal evolution of the characteristic grain size @xmath3 and the plastic strain rate @xmath15 , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : ayplotf65 ] and  [ fig : vyplotf65a ] respectively , exhibit important features qualitatively different from a disorder - limited shear band above . while significant grain size reduction and accumulation of plastic strain occur near the center of the material , a sharp boundary between the comminuted region and the surrounding region is not observed ; instead , particles across the entire material experience fragmentation .",
    "moreover , the plastic strain rate across the material appears to stabilize shortly after reaching the yield stress at @xmath253 , and grain fragmentation near the center of the shear band retards significantly thereafter .",
    "direct comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig : vyplotf65a ] and  [ fig : vyplotf65b ] shows that comminution promotes shear localization , as in a disorder - limited shear band above ( fig .",
    "[ fig : vyplotf51 ] ) ; in fact , in the present case , the effect of comminution on shear banding is even more pronounced . the plastic strain rate distribution remains nonuniform in the presence of grain breakage , but when grain fragmentation does not occur , deformation becomes spatially uniform .",
    "the larger initial compactivity @xmath180 in here is key to explaining these qualitative differences that distinguish a diffusion - limited shear band from the disorder - limited shear band in subsection a. ( indeed , at @xmath248 , these qualitative features persist down to an imposed strain rate of @xmath165 s@xmath166 ; we used @xmath177 s@xmath166 here only to depict the softening effect of grain fragmentation at fast shear rates , independent of strain localization . ) to see this , remember that the stz density @xmath254 upon the onset of plastic deformation increases rapidly with @xmath180 , and that the plastic strain rate @xmath15 is proportional to @xmath63 .",
    "because the diffusion term in eq .   is proportional to @xmath15 , the increased plastic strain rate facilitates diffusion of configurational disorder , and therefore the spread of plastic strain , throughout the entire material .",
    "this enables the dimensionless compactivity @xmath132 to equilibrate to @xmath200 across the material ( fig .",
    "[ fig : xyplotf65 ] ) .",
    "the equilibration of @xmath132 to @xmath200 , however , occurs while plastic strain remains localized in the shear band .",
    "now that @xmath255 ( because @xmath256 and the diffusion term vanishes ) , the localized plastic shear becomes long - lived .",
    "relaxtion of the localized strain rate distribution occurs very slowly .",
    "the large imposed shear rate , and the absence of a sharp boundary that differentiates the comminuted region from the surrounding particles , permit the dissipation of energy throughout the material .",
    "( color online ) variation of dimensionless compactivity @xmath132 across the width of the material , at various accumulated shear strains @xmath164 , for a diffusion - limited shear band subject to grain fragmentation . at large strains , @xmath189 across the entire material .",
    "the temporal evolution of compactivity without grain breakage is quantitatively similar and is therefore not separately shown . ]",
    "it is interesting to note that with @xmath202 ( see the remark following eq .  )",
    ", the extremely fine grains at the middle of the shear band in fact correspond to a smaller dimensionless plastic strain rate @xmath257 , for a given @xmath162 .",
    "thus , for the diffusion - limited shear band above in fig .",
    "[ fig : vyplotf65a ] , a strain rate of @xmath258 s@xmath166 at the middle of the shear band , where the grain size approaches @xmath259 m at a shear strain of @xmath260 , corresponds to a dimensionless plastic strain rate of @xmath261 , which is an order of magnitude smaller than the dimensionless strain rate of @xmath262 when grains do not break apart .      in summary , if the initial compactivity @xmath178 is large enough ( i.e.  if the granular material is loose ) and is spatially heterogeneous , the resultant shear band is of the diffusion - limited type . in contrast , if @xmath178 is small enough ( i.e.  if the material has undergone a large amount of aging ) , and if the shear rate is slow , the shear band is disorder - limited , with a sharp boundary between the comminuted and uncomminuted regions .",
    "in this paper we have developed a model for grain fragmentation processes within the framework of nonequilibrium thermodynamics . by incorporating the model into the stz theory for hard - core materials , where the characteristic grain size @xmath3 now becomes a dynamical variable ,",
    "we have analyzed the implications of grain breakage on the frictional and shear deformation behavior of granular materials .",
    "we have found that grain breakage serves as a weakening mechanism when shear localization occurs , and most remarkably , when the strain rate @xmath162 is fast if the material is rate - strengthening . in the latter case ,",
    "grain breakage results in a sharp drop in the flow stress , and dissipates energy through the creation of new grain surfaces .",
    "grain size reduction is most abrupt shortly after the onset of plastic strain , and slows down considerably afterwards , indicating that grain splitting is dominant at small strains while grain abrasion becomes prominent at large strains .",
    "in addition , we have shown that there exists a feedback between disorder configuration and grain fragmentation ; a variety of distinct qualitative shear localization behaviors , dependent on the initial state of the granular material , may occur . in one type of localization  the disorder - limited shear band",
    " there is a clear boundary between the finely comminuted region and surrounding particles .",
    "this type of behavior occurs for a sufficiently aged , or densely packed , granular material .",
    "the metastable boundary between the comminuted region and the surrounding particles is associated with the lubrication effect that small , nano - sized particles exert on larger particles nearby , as seen in model fault gouge  @xcite .",
    "another type of localization  the diffusion - limited shear band  occurs in looser granular packings .",
    "there is no sharp boundary that separates the comminuted region from the rest of the material ; all particles are crushed , though to different extents at different positions .",
    "this is accounted for by the augmented stz density that increases the plastic strain rate @xmath15 drives the diffusion of configurational disorder across the material .",
    "one remarkable feature is that the dimensionless compactivity @xmath132 equilibrates across the material to its steady - state value @xmath200 before plastic strain becomes delocalized , leading to a long - lived quasi - static state of inhomogeneous deformation ; it relaxes to homogeneous deformation very slowly , if at all .",
    "geophysical observations indicate that in a sheared fault gouge , particles within the shear band are significantly smaller than those outside of the shear band  @xcite .",
    "this appears to validate our large - strain predictions .",
    "however , to the best of our knowledge , there appear to be no direct verification of the short - time dynamical behavior , nor is there a direct verification of our proposed grain size evolution equation , eq .  , which is based solely on physical grounds .",
    "because of this , it is not possible to rigorously constrain the various parameters in our theory ; in this study , some of them have been chosen based on knowledge of the material properties of sand particles , while other parameter values have been chosen to display the distinctive qualitative implications that grain breakage have on the dynamical material behavior .",
    "do similar qualitative features arise if a different evolution equation for the grain size @xmath3 is used ?",
    "it would be beneficial if future experiments and simulations could direct track the temporal evolution of the characteristic grain size , and validate eq .   and its various ingredients .    with the simplification that @xmath263 and @xmath264",
    ", we implicitly assumed that inter - particle friction , grain angularity , and the effects of grain rotation versus slipping , etc . ,",
    "are subsumed under the choice of parameters , and that the rate and forces associated with granular rearrangement is independent of whether it occurs by slipping or rotation .",
    "this approach is certainly justified if grain fragmentation has only minor effects on grain angularity and roughness , as in the experiments on angular grains by mair , frye and marone  @xcite , in which grain breakage is neither intrinsically strengthening nor weakening .",
    "other experiments , however , point to the effect of grain characteristics on flow rheology ; fragmentation of spherical grains into angular ones could strengthen the material  @xcite , while abrasion could result in increase in roundedness and provide weakening effects at high shearing velocities  @xcite . as such , the microscopic physics of friction , angularity , sliding and rotation could have important implications on elements of the model and , as a result , the macroscopic behavior .",
    "we speculate that a multi - species stz model  @xcite , with a system - specific distribution of activation stresses and transition rates corresponding to different grain characteristics and deformation mechanisms , could provide a description of the second - order effects of grain characteristics on macroscopic behavior .",
    "the effect of grain angularity and friction on the transition rate @xmath265 and the activation stress @xmath117 would be the first and foremost issue that needs to be addressed in a refined model .",
    "in this paper we employed the simplifying assumption that stz transitions and grain breakage are independent of thermal temperature . in a granular fault",
    "gouge , however , various thermal processes ( such as flash heating  @xcite ) become prominent ; they may have important implications on material properties .",
    "would this influence the stz transition rate @xmath266 or the rate of grain size reduction , or would they cause broken - up particles to recombine ?",
