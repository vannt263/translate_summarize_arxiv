    "in this article , we propose a formalism for cloning partial quantum information beyond the restrictions imposed by the aforementioned no - go theorems .",

    ", we are able to transmit more than just classical information to the forthcoming generation , i.e. , both the diagonal elements and coherences of the associated density matrix .",
    "finally , we analyze the feasibility of a possible experimental implementation with trapped ions .    to introduce our protocol , let @xmath0 and @xmath1 be an arbitrary state and a blank state , respectively , and let @xmath2 be a hermitian operator .",

    ", we extend their results to an arbitrary dimension and show the existence of an additional operator @xmath5 , which does not commute with @xmath2 , and whose statistics is encoded in the global state of the system @xmath6        at this stage , it is convenient to point out the differences between both processes . on the one hand , eq .",
    "can be regarded as a replication of a characteristic from an individual into its progeny . in this sense ,",
    "the global state is traced out and the only important feature is the information of the individual . on the other hand , eq .",
    "can be considered as a spread of the quantum coherences of the initial individuals to the forthcoming generations as a whole .",
    "our formalism combines the notions of cloning and preserving quantum information without contradicting the no - cloning and no - broadcasting theorems  @xcite .",
    "this allows the propagation of the statistics of two non - commuting observables in a controllable way .",
    "the explanation of the cloning method requires a selection of the basis , provided here by an external environment .",
    "the dark state of an unknown environment dynamics is the blank qubit for the copying process , i.e. , the state that we define as the @xmath7 .",
    "this point will be relevant later in the discussion about the quantumness of the process .    *",
    "cloning method .",
    "* let us work without loss of generality in a basis in which @xmath2 is diagonal .",
    "then , we define the cloning operation @xmath8 in terms of the generator of @xmath9-dimensional irreducible representation of the translation group @xmath10 and the projectors into each subspace @xmath11 .",
    "we clarify that @xmath12 , after all , does not explicitly depend on @xmath2 .",
    "@xmath13 for example , for @xmath14 , @xmath15 , and for @xmath16 , @xmath17 is given by @xmath18    we will demonstrate below that eq .   fullfils eq .  .",
    "the forthcoming theorems are proved in the supplementary information  @xcite .",

    ", @xmath21 , and @xmath22 @xmath23 bounded hermitian operators .",
    "then , the unitary @xmath24 satisfies eq .  .",
    "we analyze now if the cloning unitary @xmath24 transmits information from the initial individual to the progeny as a whole , apart from cloning its expectation value independently .",
    "the process mimics the information transmission underlying collective behaviors present in many biological systems , such as self - organizing neurons .",
    "let @xmath20 be the unitary transformation defined in eq .  .",
    "then , there exists a bounded antidiagonal operator @xmath5 , whose matrix elements are @xmath25 or @xmath26 , fulfilling eq .  .",
    "notice that , in previous theorems , we have worked in a basis in which @xmath2 is diagonal .",
    "however , the cloning operation can be rewritten in any basis just by rotating the matrix with the proper unitary , @xmath27 , transforming @xmath5 into @xmath28 and @xmath24 into @xmath29 .",
    "when the cloning operation is sequentially reapplied , it propagates the information of the initial state , i.e. , it transmits the full statistics of the density matrix , tr@xmath30 $ ] , @xmath31 .",
    "we show here how two - qubit operations are extended into @xmath32-qubit states , @xmath33 where the subscripts of @xmath24 refer to the pair of qubits that is acted upon .",
    "the cloning for the subsequent generations , see fig .",
    "[ mas ] , is constructed through the product of pairwise cloning operations , @xmath34 .",
    "for instance , the density matrices of the first and second generations reads @xmath35 therefore , the mechanism is straightforwardly generalizable for obtaining sequential generations with the same information in each individual , in the spirit of a quantum genetic code .",
    "moreover , although eq .   holds only for qubits , it is noteworthy to mention that an extension to higher dimensions is possible .",
    "this can be achieved using as building block the unitary gate @xmath12 defined in eq .  .",
    "we will present now a counter - example showing that the cloning operation is not unique .",

    "recently introduced a criterion to determine the nonclassicality of an operation @xmath47 .",
    "this method is based on the distance between the outcome of the operation and the pointer basis einselected by the environment .",
    "the quantum operation @xmath47 is composed with the completely dephasing channel @xmath48 , provided by the environment .",
    "the measurement of nonclassicality is obtained by maximizing over all states the relative entropy of both operations acting on an arbitrary quantum state .",
    "the completely dephasing channel plays the role of an external environment that einselects the pointer basis , in which @xmath47 is represented . effectively , as proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , any operation is quantum whenever its column vectors are superpositions of the elements of the basis . on the contrary ,",
    "the operation is classical if they are just permutations of the basis .",
    "it is natural to identify the basis of the ancillary qudits , @xmath49 , with the pointer states , since we assume that the system naturally provides blank qudits . by applying the classification formalism for qubits ,",
    "the process of copying @xmath50 in the individual state and @xmath51 in the global state is classical , because the @xmath52 is written in terms of permutations of the pointer states . nevertheless , the complementary operation @xmath53 which clones @xmath51 in the individual state and @xmath50 in the global state , is quantum .",
    "another possibility is to consider that the classical pointer basis is defined by the @xmath47 operator itself .",
    "this means that we can construct the quantum channel @xmath54 which maps the initial state to any of the outcomes , considering the blank qudit and the other outcome as the environment . by construction ,",
    "the unitary given by eq",
    ".   leads to an injective channel , since the number of kraus operators is the same as the square of the matrix dimension .",
    "therefore , the only fixed point is the identity and the cloning operations are classical when written in the einselected basis  @xcite .",
    "according to these results , the cloning formalism copies classical information but preserves quantum correlations , which makes the global operation quantum .",
    "the interpretation of this property is that the quantum part of the information is encoded in the global state . by analogy with biological systems ,",
    "the environment plays a fundamental role in the kind of information that , similar to quantum darwinism  @xcite , is preserved and cloned through a pure quantum mechanism . in our work ,",
    "the quantumness is only revealed when considering collectively all outcomes of the copying process .",
    "* experimental implementation .",
    "* we consider that an experimental realization of our protocol in a quantum platform sets a significant step towards quantum artificial life .",
    "we propose an experimental setup of our formalism in trapped ions , arguably the most advanced quantum technologies in terms of coherence times and gate fidelities  @xcite .",
    "current experimental resources would allow copying processes for qubits and qutrits of three and two generations , respectively .",
    "the number of logical gates and trapped ions required to perform the experiment is presented in table  [ reo ] .",
    "we point out that the only limitations for performing trapped - ion experiments with higher dimensions and larger number of generations are decoherence times and gate errors . none of these are fundamental and near future improvements may allow to reach the implementation of higher dimensional individuals and many more generations with near perfect fidelities .",
    "sequential generation step & 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 + total gates ( 2 qubit gates ) & 0 & 19(2 ) & 57(6 ) & 133(14 ) + ions & 1 & 2 & 4 & 8 +   + sequential generation step & 0 & 1 & 2 & - + total gates ( 2 qubit gates ) & 0 & 38(4 ) & 114(12 ) & - + ions & 2 & 4 & 8 & - +    [ reo ]    we encode the initial state in one of the ions , while the rest are initialized in the @xmath7 state .",
    "the cloning operation for two qubits is the cnot gate , which can be reproduced performing the m@xmath55lmer - s@xmath55rensen gate  @xcite and a sequence of single qubit gates  @xcite , @xmath56 . here",
    ", @xmath57 is the phase gate , @xmath58 is the hadamard gate , @xmath59 is the m@xmath55lmer - s@xmath55rensen gate , and the subindex denotes the ion number .",
    "we express the gates as products of carrier transitions @xmath60 and a phase factor , @xmath61 the first and second generations of cloned qubits are obtained as indicated in eq .  .",
    "the next step in the copying process , i.e. , the third generation , is given by @xmath62 .",
    "+ we consider now the implementation of the qutrit case in trapped ions .",
    "as there is no direct access to qutrit gates , we have to engineer a protocol with one and two - qubit gates .",
    "we suggest to add three ancillary levels that split the unitary operation into three subspaces of @xmath63 matrices . to achieve this , for the @xmath64 given in eq . , the modified @xmath65 is @xmath66 the first submatrix does not require any quantum gate .",
    "the second and third submatrices are the products of two cnot gates , for which the role of control and target ions is interchanged .",
    "hence , the implementation is reduced from qutrit to qubit operations .",
    "in summary , inspired by biological systems , we have brought concepts and applications into quantum information theory .",
    "for instance , our partial quantum cloning method makes use of global and local measurements in order to encode information of nonconmuting observables beyond the classical realm .",
    "moreover , we prove that the information transmission is purely quantum for a certain kind of operators . in parallel",
    ", we show that it is possible to implement our ideas in an ion - trap platform with current technology .",
    "replication is the most fundamental property that one may require from a biological system .",
    "we leave to forthcoming works the introduction of additional biological behaviors such as mutations , evolution and natural selection , englobed by the frame of quantum artificial life .",
    "this proposal should be considered as the first step towards mimicking biological behaviours in controllable quantum systems , a concept that we have called quantum biomimetics .",
