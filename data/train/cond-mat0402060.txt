    "the first of these intervals is featured by the fact that , for turned - off disorder , the infinite slope of the dispersion relation produces a tail of the density of states at the high - energy part of the spectrum .",
    "the effect of disorder , which introduces the mixing of states only within a narrow energy interval , is seriously weakened due to the small number of available states . in accordance with such qualitative argument ,",
    "the tail - like part of the density of states , found in a self - consistent way , remains similar to that of the disorder - free system , apart for a small uniform shift induced by disorder .",
    "for @xmath29 the zero broadening at the edge of the tail was shown to result in the divergence of the phase coherence length , while for @xmath69 it remained finite across the band .",
    "irrespectively of @xmath0 , the real - space propagator was demonstrated to contain a component decaying with coordinate as @xmath36 .",
    "the model studied in the present paper is applicable to various materials in which the energy of one - particle excitations is of dipolar origin .",
    "as an example , let us mention dipolar frenkel excitons on two - dimensional regular lattices where molecules are subjected to randomness due to a disordered environment .",
    "@xcite some biological light - harvesting antenna systems  @xcite as well as dendrimers  @xcite may represent a realization of this model .",
    "the form of dipolar interactions dictates the value of the hopping exponent , @xmath163 . for this value of @xmath0 ,",
    "@xmath164 was shown to be the marginal case at which one starts to observe the divergence of the pcl at the upper band - edge . increasing the pcl for frenkel excitons could be deduced after measurement of the linear absorption spectra , that in this case should fit the power - law form  ( [ absorption ] ) .",
    "this opens the feasibility to test our predictions from experiments at low temperature .",
