    "lepton pairs are an ideal probe for studying phenomena at high densities and temperatures .",
    "they are created at all stages of a heavy - ion collision , but unlike hadrons they can escape the hot and dense zone almost undisturbed ( since they only interact electromagnetically ) and thus can carry genuine in - medium information out to the detector .",
    "dileptons are particularly well - suited to study the in - medium properties of vector mesons , since the latter can directly convert into a virtual photon , and thus a lepton pair @xcite .",
    "one of the groundbreaking experiments in this field was na60 at the cern sps , which revealed that the @xmath0 spectral function is strongly broadened in the medium .",
    "calculations by rapp et al .  have shown that this collisional broadening is mostly driven by baryonic effects , i.e. , the coupling of the @xmath0 meson to baryon resonances ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 ) @xcite . in the low - energy regime ,",
    "the data taken by the dls detector have puzzled theorists for years and have recently been confirmed and extended by new measurements by the hades collaboration @xcite . at such low energies , it is expected that not only the in - medium properties are determined by baryonic effects , but that already the production mechanism of vector mesons is dominated by the coupling to baryons ( even in the vacuum ) .",
    "already our previous investigations @xcite based on the gibuu transport model @xcite have shown that the baryonic @xmath1 and @xmath2 resonances give important dalitz - like contributions to dilepton spectra at sis energies for pp as well as aa collisions .",
    "this finding is based on the assumption that these resonances decay into a lepton pair exclusively via an intermediate @xmath0 meson ( i.e. , strict vector - meson dominance ) . in the transport simulation",
    ", the dalitz decays @xmath3 are treated as a two - step process , where the first part is an @xmath4 decay , followed by a subsequent conversion of the @xmath0 into a lepton pair ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the branching ratios for the @xmath4 decays are taken from the partial - wave analysis by manley et al .",
    "@xcite , while the decay width for the second part is calculated under the strict - vmd assumption .",
    "recently we have extended the vmd assumption also to the @xmath6 state @xcite .    in principle",
    "it is clear that all the dilepton dalitz decays of the baryonic resonances ( @xmath7 ) must involve an electromagnetic transition form factor . from an experimental point of view",
    "this form factor is essentially unknown in the time - like region . in consequence",
    "it is frequently neglected in transport simulations .",
    "our approach is to use strict vmd as a sensible ansatz for this form factor , which is easy to implement in a transport scheme .",
    "in fig .  1 we present two examples of results obtained with our model @xcite .",
    "the left - hand side shows the simulated dilepton mass spectrum from elementary p+p collisions at @xmath8 ( inside the detector acceptance ) compared to the data measured by the hades collaboration .",
    "while the low - mass regime is dominated by the dalitz decays of the @xmath9 and @xmath10 mesons , the region of higher masses shows a clear @xmath11 peak ( whose width is dictated by detector resolution ) and a hint of a @xmath12 peak at the very end of the spectrum .",
    "the most interesting region , however , is the intermediate - mass regime below the @xmath11 peak , which according to our model is dominated by baryonic contributions from @xmath1 ( and @xmath2 ) resonances .",
    "there is a whole cocktail of such resonances which are known to couple to the @xmath0 meson , but in particular the light ones , such as the @xmath13 , give important contributions here , without which the data in the intermediate - mass regime could not be described .",
    "the @xmath6 only gives subdominant contributions in our model ( both in the qed and vmd approaches ) , which is in conflict with other results @xcite , which claim a much more dominant role of the @xmath14 .    the right panel of fig .",
    "1 shows the dilepton spectrum from ar+kcl collisions at an energy of 1.76 agev compared to the hades data .",
    "there are additional channels in this medium - sized nucleus - nucleus system , which do not occur in pure pp collisions , such as @xmath15 bremsstrahlung or the contribution from @xmath16 , but they are not dominant . as in the elementary case ,",
    "the contributions from the baryonic resonances are significant .",
    "overall we observe an underestimation at intermediate masses and a slight excess in the vector - meson pole region .",
    "reasons for these deviations could be uncertainties in the used resonance parameters or a missing dynamical treatment of density - dependent spectral functions .",
    "such a treatment may be provided by the so - called  coarse - graining ",
    "approach , which is subject of ongoing investigations @xcite .",
    "it could help to improve the description of heavy systems and to make the connection to dilepton measurements at higher energies .",
    "and @xmath17 collisions at @xmath18.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]   and @xmath17 collisions at @xmath18.,title=\"fig:\",scaledwidth=45.0% ]    pion - induced reactions offer a much cleaner testing ground for dilepton production than aa or pp reactions , since the latter always involve excitation of baryonic resonances at various energies , while @xmath15 collisions operate at a fixed @xmath19 , corresponding to a fixed resonance mass .",
    "this makes it much easier to disentangle contributions from different resonances , as pointed out e.g. in @xcite .",
    "2 shows the prediction of our model for dilepton mass spectra from pion - induced reactions on proton and carbon targets at a beam kinetic energy of @xmath20 ( corresponding to @xmath21 or @xmath22 ) which have recently been measured at gsi .",
    "in contrast to fig .  1 , no detector acceptance and resolution effects are included here .",
    "the considered energy is just above the @xmath10 threshold and close to the pole masses of resonance states like @xmath13 and @xmath23 .",
    "in particular the former is believed to have a strong coupling to the @xmath0 meson and thus should have a large influence on dilepton spectra . in our model ,",
    "the @xmath13 plays a very dominant role at this energy . when disregarding the @xmath10 dalitz contribution , which can be subtracted in the experimental spectra , essentially all of the high - mass yield is due to the @xmath13 , while contributions from other resonances like the @xmath23 or the @xmath6 are suppressed by roughly an order of magnitude in the elementary @xmath24 reaction .",
    "the @xmath14 contribution is again shown in two different approaches , and there also is a @xmath15 bremsstrahlung contribution .",
    "however , the latter should be taken with a grain of salt , since it is only calculated in soft - photon approximation , which may not be very reliable in the @xmath15 case , in particular for large dilepton masses .    when moving to the carbon target , as shown on the right - hand side of fig .  2",
    ", one can see that the @xmath14 and bremsstrahlung contributions gain additional strength from secondary collisions .",
    "yet , the relative strength of the @xmath10 contribution drops a bit , since it is produced only in the primary collisions , but can be absorbed afterwards .",
    "the dominance of the @xmath13 in the high - mass regions persists .",
    "we stress that our model currently relies on the assumption of a strict - vmd form factor for the @xmath13 ( as for all other @xmath1 resonances )",
    ". however , the strong dominance of this resonance in the reaction considered here might make it possible to obtain a rather direct measurement of its electromagnetic transition form factor",
    ". it will be very interesting to see whether the experimental data will reveal any deviation from the vmd assumption .    in any case",
    ", it should also be mentioned that some models claim rather strong destructive interference effects at this energy @xcite ( which are neglected in our transport simulation , since they are very hard to handle )",
    ". however , those effects are subject to controversy and do not show up so strongly at this energy in other models @xcite .",
    "we have shown that the hades dilepton data from pp and aa collisions can be described rather well with a combination of a resonance - model - based transport approach with a strict - vmd coupling of the baryons to the electromagnetic sector , where a mix of different baryonic resonances contributes to the total dilepton yield .",
    "unfortunately not all parameters of these resonances are known sufficiently well .",
    "however , recent pion - beam measurements at gsi could help to shed new light on the baryonic resonances and possibly even fix the transition form factor of their electromagnetic dalitz decays .",
