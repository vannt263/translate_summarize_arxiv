    "different numerical simulations ( for instance @xcite ) suggested scaling laws with widely different exponents .",
    "more careful simulations @xcite , however , showed that the behaviour of hysteresis cycles depends in a complicated way on the mechanism of magnetization reversal , and no universal scaling law of the form should be expected .",
    "rigorous results on hysteresis in the ising model are only available for discontinuous reversal ( quenching ) of the field @xcite .",
    "a third kind of models for which scaling laws of hysteresis cycles have been investigated belong to the mean field class , and include the curie@xmath13@xmath14weiss model .",
    "a one - dimensional deterministic equation modeling a bistable laser , and being equivalent to the equation of motion of an overdamped particle in a periodically forced double - well potential , was considered in @xcite .",

    "a similar equation governs the dynamics of the magnetization in the curie@xmath13@xmath14weiss model , in the limit of infinite system size .",
    "this equation was examined in @xcite , where it was shown that the behaviour changes drastically when the amplitude of the forcing crosses a threshold , a phenomenon they termed dynamic phase transition .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the difference between the scaling laws and can be attributed to the existence of a potential barrier for the one - dimensional order parameter , which is absent in higher dimensions .",

    ", @xmath0 is likely to be close to a reference area @xmath33 of order @xmath34 , which is smaller than the static hysteresis area .",
