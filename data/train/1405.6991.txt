    "recently , there has been considerable interest in coupling mechanical resonators to optical and microwave radiation , as well as to electric conduction  @xcite .",
    "resulting devices , nanoelectromechanical and optomechanical systems , combine excellent mechanical and electrical / optical properties , such as low dissipation both in the cavity and in the mechanical resonator .",
    "these systems have already displayed a rich variety of interesting physical phenomena . at the same time they found applications _",
    "e.g. _ as sensors and transducers .",
    "most of the experiments so far have been carried out in the regime of classical mechanical motion , though recently the quantum regime has been demonstrated as well  @xcite .",
    "an important problem in this field is to find efficient schemes to detect the mechanical motion . to this end",
    ", one should find systems whose properties are significantly affected by the mechanical resonator , carrying consequently distinct signature of this coupling . on the other side",
    "the coupling to the detector has sizeable consequences on the resonator too .",
    "backaction , understood as an effect of the detector ( for example , an optical or a microwave cavity ) on the properties of the mechanical resonator is one of the fundamental issues in the field of nano- and optomechanics  @xcite .",
    "even though backaction is not always wanted in the experiment and can be suppressed with backaction - evasion techniques  @xcite , one can nevertheless use it as an advantage in order to manipulate , for example to cool  @xcite and to heat the resonator . in optomechanics",
    "backaction is provided by radiation pressure and its properties are very well established , both theoretically and experimentally  @xcite .",
    "more recently , backaction in nanomechanical devices , caused by electrostatic interactions @xcite and by lorentz force @xcite , both in the classical regime , has been demonstrated experimentally .",
    "it is important that in all these examples , the mechanical resonators were in the linear regime .",
    "the backaction effect consisted in the modification of the frequency ( optical spring ) and the quality factor , as well as in the induced non - linearity of the mechanical resonator .    within the area of superconducting nanomechanical systems ,",
    "squid - based circuits have been intensively investigated .",
    "a dc squid and its integration with the mechanical resonator has been theoretically proposed@xcite and experimentally demonstrated@xcite .",
    "the detection of the mechanical oscillations was possible through an analysis of the dynamics of the electrical response of the superconducting circuit .",
    "a squid is a non - linear cavity .",
    "non - linear effects in opto- and nano - mechanical systems recently drew a lot of attention ( see ref . ) .",
    "they originate from different sources  non - linear coupling between the resonator and the cavity , mechanical non - linearities of resonators made of carbon nanotubes and graphene , and also from the cavity itself .",
    "the aim of this paper is to study the role of non - linearity in the dynamics of a squid coupled to a mechanical resonator .",
    "our interest is two - fold . on one hand",
    ", we would like to explore further the impact of mechanical oscillation to the stability of the squid dynamics , thinking to eventually use this informalion as a detection mean . on the other hand , backaction in the presence of strong non - linearities",
    "requires a closer inspection . due to the complexity of dynamic behavior of non - linear systems",
    "one can expect that even small effect of backaction can considerably alter the properties of a non - linear oscillator .    in this article",
    ", we make the first step in this direction .",
    "we consider a dc squid coupled to a driven harmonic mechanical resonator . whereas formally this system is similar to the one studied experimentally in ref . , to explore the regime where the backaction is the strongest , we consider the situation when the mechanical and the cavity frequencies are of the same order .",
    "this is the regime when the dc squid acts as a josephson parametric amplifier ( jpa ) @xcite and displays a multistable behavior : the amplitude of the oscillations of a driven jpa can assume two values in a wide frequency range , such behavior was seen in the response of the non - linear oscillators to the parametric forcing  @xcite .",
    "this feature of the jpa can be used to readout the state of the qubit , since different amplitude correspond to different states of the qubit .",
    "we consider the situation when both the field of the cavity ( the phase of the josephson junctions ) and the coordinate of the mechanical motion are classical variables . in our chosen setup",
    ", jpa is parametrically driven . assuming a weak coupling between the jpa and the mechanical oscillator , we demonstrate that the backaction can considerably modify the dynamics of jpa and lead to multistability rather than bistability .",
    "we obtain this result analytically , approximating jpa by the duffing oscillator , and also confirm it numerically , relaxing this approximation .",
    "the results of this article demonstrate that backaction can indeed essentially modify the behavior of a non - linear oscillator .",
    "the present analysis is therefore relevant when considering the jpa as a detector for mechanical motion . in comparison with the qubit detection , where the hysteretic regime permits a readout",
    ", the mechanical motion detection uses the whole finite amplitude regime .",
    "therefore , here jpa acts as a threshold detector .",
    "moreover , the multistability results in the extra hysteretic region , which enhances the sensitivity and range of the detector .    the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : system ] we describe the device and set up the model to describe it . in sec .",
    "[ sec : eom ] , we consider the case of negligible coupling ( no backaction of the squid on the mechanical oscillator ) and solve the corresponding equations . in sec .",

    "we consider a dc squid with two ( nearly ) identical josephson junctions coupled to a mechanical resonator .",
    "the resonator is formed by a suspended segment of superconductor .",
    "we only consider one mode of the mechanical resonator .",
    "it can be externally driven , which is experimentally realized by fabricating the suspended part of the setup close to a piezoelectric element .",
    "the schematic overview of the system is shown on fig.[fig : squid ] .",
    "the coupling between the squid and the mechanical resonator is based on the fact that the critical current of the squid periodically depends on the magnetic flux , making it a very sensitive magnetic flux detector .",
    "the oscillations of the resonator induce a variation of the area thus affecting the flux .",
    "when the mechanical resonator is driven , the flux modulation leads to a parametric driving for the squid.@xcite .",
    "the mechanical resonator is modelled as a harmonic oscillator driven by external periodic force @xmath0 with driving frequency @xmath1 .",

    "the effective hamiltonian is composed of the contribution from the resonator @xmath22 , the kinetic energy of the squid @xmath23 , and the potential energy of the squid @xmath24 . since the potential energy @xmath24 depends on the phase difference it provides the coupling between the squid and the oscillator through eq.([phiminus ] ) . from our system",

    "the numerical solution confirms the multistability .",
    "one of the most popular applications of josephson parametric amplifier is the readout of the qubit state @xcite .",
    "this application uses the fact that when jpa is in a bistable regime , different values of the amplitude may be coupled differently to two states of the qubit , and thus a projective measurement of the amplitude of jpa yields the information of the occupied qubit state . in this subsection",
    ", we analyze how jpa can be used for the readout of the amplitude of the oscillations of the mechanical resonator it is coupled to . whereas we are only considering a classical problem here , the next step would be to investigate the oscillator in the quantum regime , when the amplitude becomes quantized , and this is why we have chosen the oscillation amplitude as the parameter of interest .    for this purpose , we redrew our results as the dependence of the dc squid amplitude on the resonator oscillation amplitude .",

    "the exact location of the high amplitude bistable point is outside the scope of our article and can be determined by means of singularity analysis .",

    "[ fig : displacement_amplitude]a which corresponds to weak backaction , shows that jpa can only detect the amplitude in a ( narrow ) range of values , where the curve is not flat .",
    "in contrast to the qubit detection , here it is best to use not the hysteretic range , which is narrow , but the whole branch corresponding to the non - zero amplitude @xmath63 .",
    "thus , jpa serves as a threshold detector .",
    "if one increases the coupling , the curve becomes steeper , and the range where detection is possible , increases .",
    "[ fig : displacement_amplitude ] c , which corresponds to even stronger coupling and has an additional hysteretic region , shows that in this case , the detection is possible in two separate regions , separated by the bifurcation region .",

    "we found that above the bifurcation point , the phase of the squid does not respond to the parametric driving .",
    "the bifurcation point is located at the frequency slightly above the point where the condition @xmath90 is met .",
    "the precise location of the bifurcation point depends on the dissipation and the driving force , but not on the backaction strength . below the bifurcation point ,",
    "a non - trivial solution for the amplitude of the squid oscillation arises .",
    "we found that the dissipation suppresses this non - trivial solution whereas the driving strength enhances it .",
    "furthermore , we discover that at strong enough backaction , the non - trivial solution may become multistable , and thus the physics of the systems goes beyond the duffing oscillator .",
    "we have obtained the multistability by analytical calculations within the duffing oscillator approximation and also by numerical solution of the full model .",
    "we demonstrated that this system can be used as the displacement detector by translating squid amplitude into mechanical displacement .",
    "multistability increases the range and the sensitivity of the detector .",
    "one can experimentally control the strength of backaction by changing the geometry of the resonator or parameters of the squid . in our model",
    "the magnetic field was applied perpendicular to the squid loop , instead one can use parallel orientation of magnetic field and tune flux @xmath122 using _",
    "e.g. _ a stripline , which also changes the backaction strength .    currently , the most stringent condition in our theory which hinders the experimental verification is that the frequencies of the squid and the mechanical resonator are of the same order . in the existing experiments",
    "@xcite , the plasma frequency of the squid was several orders of magnitude higher than the mechanical frequency .",
    "however , currently there is an interest to the fabrication of superconducting junctions with suspended carbon nanotubes  @xcite and graphene sheet integrated into the microwave cavities @xcite . whereas the frequency of mechanical motion in the existing devices is still lower than the cavity frequency",
    ", the regime @xmath123 can be achieved .",
    "another limitation is that we assumed the two josephson junctions to be identical .",
    "we do not expect however that the asymmetry of the squid would qualitatively affect our results .",
    "finally , we emphasize that we have only made the first step towards exploring non - linear cavity properties in cavity electrodynamics .",
    "we certainly expect more rich and interesting physics in the situations which lies outside the scope of our article  strong backaction ( beyond the perturbation theory ) , dispersive coupling between the squid and the resonator , as well as quantum effects in both the phase of the squid and the mechanical motion of the resonator .",
