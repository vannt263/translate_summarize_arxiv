    "the very real possibility of finding new quantum phases and excitations has made frustrated magnetism one of the most exciting and dynamic research areas in contemporary condensed matter physics@xcite .",
    "often , frustrated magnets have the potential to support many different ground states , and can be tuned at will between these states by applying a magnetic field .",
    "relative to other approaches , such as chemical doping , this field control of phase transitions has the great advantage that it does not introduce new complications  such as disorder  into the system .",
    "the advent of powerful new magnets , in some cases capable of reaching many hundreds of tesla , has made it possible to study new magnetic phases and the ( quantum ) phase transitions between them in a wide range of materials for the first time .",
    "these high - field experiments have already yielded new insights into phenomena as diverse as bose - einstein condensation  @xcite , and the delicate interplay between magnetism and structural transitions in cr spinels  @xcite .",
    "triangular lattice antiferromagnets have been central to our understanding of frustration since the pioneering work of wannier@xcite . a wide range of novel phases",
    "have first been proposed in the context of the triangular lattice , including the celebrated `` resonating valence bond '' ( rvb ) spin - liquid  @xcite , two - dimensional chiral phases  @xcite , magnetisation plateaux  @xcite , and a collection of different multipolar states  @xcite .",
    "recently , spin - liquid behaviour has been established experimentally in a variety of triangular - lattice systems , including the quasi-2d organics  @xcite and etme@xmath3sb[pd(dmit)@xmath0]@xmath0 @xcite , thin films of @xmath5he  [ ref .  ] , and",

    " i.e. the absence of magnetic anisotropy  this is rarely true of real materials .",
    "generically , these exhibit some degree of magnetic anisotropy , either at the level of a single ion , or in their exchange interactions  @xcite .",
    "it has been known for a long time that the interplay between magnetic field , frustration and magnetic anisotropy can lead to novel magnetic phases on the triangular lattice , even in simple classical models .",
    "the classical heisenberg antiferromagnet with easy - axis anisotropy , first studied by miyashita and kawamura@xcite , exhibits a competition between the coplanarity favoured by magnetic interactions @xcite , and collinear order driven by anisotropy and magnetic field@xcite .",
    "more recent studies have highlighted successive berezinskii - kosterlitz - thouless phase transitions as a function of temperature @xcite and exotic quantum effects at large single - ion anisotropy @xcite .",
    "one possible outcome of the competition between exchange interactions , magnetic anisotropy and magnetic field is a state which breaks both spin and lattice symmetries , exhibiting a finite ( staggered ) magnetisation perpendicular to the field , and broken translational symmetry .",
    "matsuda and tstuneto  @xcite and liu and fisher  @xcite argued , via a quantum lattice gas mapping , that such a mixed - symmetry phase could be an exact analogue of the supersolid phase proposed in @xmath8he  [ ref .  ] . in the model considered by liu and fisher ,",

    "have lead to a renaissance of interest in supersolid phases  @xcite and their magnetic analogues .",
    "quantum monte carlo simulations now provide clear evidence for magnetic supersolids in @xmath9=@xmath10 , easy - axis models on the triangular lattice@xcite . in this case , following the original logic of andreev  @xcite , the transition into a magnetic supersolid can be interpreted as a field - driven bose - einstein condensation of magnons within a magnetic solid  a collinear , magnetically ordered phase .",

    "we have argued that the low - field transition observed in agnio@xmath0 converts the collinear ground state into a novel state which is a magnetic supersolid in the sense of matsuda and tstuneto or liu and fisher  @xcite . in this case , the expected first - order spin - flop transition is replaced by a continuous transition into a magnetic supersolid .",
    "this occurs through the bose - einstein condensation of magnons with a _",
    "finite _ momentum , leading to a novel magnetic supersolid distinct from any of the cases considered above .    in this paper",
    "we extend the analysis began in ref .   to explore systematically how competing exchange interactions and easy - axis anisotropy",
    "provide a route to novel magnetic phases under applied field in , e.g. , hexagonal delafossites .",
    "we consider explicitly the model used to fit low - energy magnetic excitations in agnio@xmath0 , with competing first - neighbour ( @xmath11 ) and second - neighbour ( @xmath12 ) exchange interactions on a triangular lattice , small but finite inter - layer coupling ( @xmath13 ) , and a varying degree of easy - axis anisotropy @xmath1 [ ref .  ] .",
    "while there have been some theoretical studies on the interplay of further - neighbour interactions and anisotropy on the triangular lattice @xcite , the possibility of finding new phases in magnetic field remains largely unexplored .    in this paper",
    "we constrain the ratio between exchange parameters to values relevant to agnio@xmath0 and explore how the magnetic phase diagram evolves as a function of easy - axis anisotropy .",
    "the resulting behaviour is extremely rich , exhibiting a wide variety of magnetic supersolid and collinear plateau phases , ( almost ) all of which share a common four - site unit cell . since our main interest is in finite - temperature phases and phase transitions , we consider the classical limit @xmath14 , which opens the problem to large - scale monte carlo simulation .",
    "this is complemented by zero - temperature mean - field theory , low - temperature spin - wave expansions , and landau theory .",
    "particular attention is paid to the novel magnetic supersolid phase introduced in ref .  .",
    "this is shown to have qualitatively different properties at finite temperature from any previously studied supersolid , and to be remarkably robust against changes in parameters .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : model+mft ] we introduce the model , discuss the choice of parameters and present mean - field arguments .",

    "the ordered observed phases are those collinear phases which can be accommodated in a three- or a four - site unit cell , i.e. the collinear stripe phase at low field and then the @xmath40=1/3- and @xmath40=1/2 magnetisation plateaux . at @xmath31=0",
    "the transition fields are independent of the anisotropy value and agree with the established results for the ising model .",
    "all phase transitions are first order for all temperatures and fields",
    ".    nevertheless , even in this strong - anisotropy regime the features above identified previously as robust characteristics of the model are still clearly visible .",
    "these include the persistence of the first - order transition between the stripe - collinear and @xmath40=@xmath10 phases , and the points with @xmath165=0 in both the paramagnet - plateau and plateau - plateau transitions .",
    "it is instructive to compare the strong anisotropy results with the pure ising limit , , previously investigated at @xmath31=0 [ ref .  ] .",
    "the most obvious difference is that in the ising limit the @xmath40=1/3 plateau is now directly connected to the paramagnetic state .",
    "the two values of field where the magnetisation jump at the first - order paramagnet - m=@xmath10 plateau transition are still present , but one of them now arises where both plateaux and the paramagnet meet .",
    "the inner transition fields all show very little dependence with temperature , indicating the validity of the mean - field picture and that all three phases possess roughly the same amount of entropy . as a final comment",
    ", we observe that the zero field nel temperature is a monotonically function of anisotropy .",
    "empirically , this can be written as @xmath166 , until saturating at @xmath167 in the ising limit .",
    ".catalogue of phases and associated phase diagrams for different values of @xmath1 . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     in this paper , we have explored the magnetic - field properties of a frustrated easy - axis heisenberg model , originally introduced to explain the magnetic properties of the hexagonal delafossite 2h - agnio@xmath0  [ ] .",
    "we have used extensive monte carlo simulations , combined with landau theory and spin - wave analysis , to obtain a set of magnetic phase diagrams for a set of values of single - ion anisotropy , ranging from the heisenberg [ @xmath1=0 ] to the ising [ @xmath1=@xmath2 ] limits .",
    "the model exhibits a spectacularly rich set of phase diagrams , with a wide variety of competing collinear and non - collinear states , some of which are magnetic supersolids in the sense of matsuda and tsuneto or liu and fisher .",
    "a catalogue of these phases , together with the values of @xmath1 for which they occur , is given in table  [ table : phases ] .",
    "the key to understanding the properties of the model for small values of anisotropy lies in the heisenberg limit , @xmath169 [ fig .  [ fig : d0-panel ] ] . here",
    "the system breaks up into two , decoupled , sublattices [ fig  [ fig : twosublattice ] ] , and the ordered states seen at finite temperature are selected by considerations of entropy , rather than energy .",
    "however the difference in entropy between these phases is very small , and so any finite magnetic anisotropy can stabilize new phases at low temperature , as observed for @xmath170 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : d002-panel ] ] .",
    "these new phases include the collinear stripe state observed in agnio@xmath0  [ ] , and the novel magnetic supersolid [ fig  [ fig : configs](c ) ] introduced in [ ] .",
    "that such a supersolid should be _ stabilized _ by easy - axis anisotropy might at first seem surprising , since easy - axis anisotropy naturally suppresses the in - plane magnetization which lends a magnetic supersolid its `` superfluid '' character . in this case , however , the supersolid is driven by the balance of competing exchange interactions and anisotropy , and not by any delicate order - from - disorder effect .",
    "this energetic origin of the supersolid makes it very robust  it is present at low temperatures for a wide range of values of anisotropy @xmath171 , as illustrated in the phase diagrams for @xmath1=0.02 [ fig .  [ fig : d002-panel ] ] , @xmath1=0.25 [ fig .  [ fig : d025-panel ] ] , @xmath1=0.5 [ fig .  [ fig : d05-panel ] ] and @xmath1=0.675 [ fig .  [ fig : d0675-panel ] ] .",
    "the transition from the collinear `` stripe '' state [ fig .",
    "[ fig : configs](a ) ] into the magnetic supersolid , as a function of magnetic field , can be viewed as the condensation of spin wave excitations with _ finite _ momentum .",
    "this sets the new state apart from other , known examples of magnetic supersolids , where the mode which condenses has zero momentum . as a consequence",
    "the supersolid does not simply interpolate between collinear stripe ( solid ) and spin - flop ( superfluid ) states , or terminate in a tetracritical point , as envisaged by liu and fisher  @xcite .    instead ,",
    "at higher temperatures , the supersolid is `` squeezed out '' of the magnetic phase diagram by competing phases with higher entropy  the collinear `` stripe '' phase from which it descends , its canted `` spin - flop '' analogue [ @xmath1=0.02 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : d002-panel ] ] and , at higher values of @xmath1 , collinear [ @xmath1=0.25 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : d025-panel ] and @xmath1=0.5 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : d05-panel ] ] and magnetization plateaux [ @xmath1=0.675 ; fig .",
    "[ fig : d0675-panel ] ] .",
    "we anticipate that increasing the second - neighbour interaction @xmath12 ( fixed in these simulations at @xmath172 ) , will make the magnetic supersolid more robust at higher temperatures .",
    "a similar story is repeated with the two other magnetic supersolid phases found at higher values of magnetic fields : an unusual 2:1:1 canted state [ fig .",
    "[ fig : configs](e ) ] , and a 3:1 canted state [ fig .",
    "[ fig : configs](g ) ] .",
    "the 2:1:1 canted state interpolates between the magnetic supersolid and a collinear @xmath40=1/2 plateau . like the supersolid",
    ", it owes its stability to a balance of competing interactions , and is displaced at high temperatures by the collinear @xmath40=1/2 plateau , which has superior entropy .",
    "it not only exhibits a substantial staggered magnetization in the @xmath38@xmath39 plane , but also a finite ( if small ) uniform magnetization @xmath131 , perpendicular to the magnetic field . in turn , the 3:1 canted phase interpolates between the collinear @xmath40=1/2 plateau and saturation . like the 2:1:1 canted phase it exhibits a small magnetization @xmath131 in the @xmath38@xmath39 plane .",
    "it is the only supersolid phase present for @xmath41 ( where @xmath173 ) , [ fig .",
    "[ fig : d0-panel ] ] , and the only supersolid phase favoured by considerations of entropy alone . for this reason it is also the only supersolid connected to the paramagnetic phase at high temperatures .",
    "the phase transitions which link these different phases also evolve as a function of @xmath1 .",
    "each of the canted phases is connected to neighbouring collinear phases by a soft spin - wave mode within the collinear state , and so these transitions can be continuous",
    ". however phase transitions at high temperatures are generically first order , and become more strongly so as anisotropy is increased , as observed by e.g. comparing the phase diagrams for @xmath158 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : d05-panel ] ] , @xmath159 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : d0675-panel ] ] and @xmath174 [ fig .",
    "[ fig : d15-panel ] ] .",
    "this trend is seem most clearly in phase diagrams plotted as a function of temperature and magnetization , which begin to exhibit large regions of phase coexistence as @xmath1 is increased .",
    "the anaysis in this paper clarifies the origin of the novel magnetic supersolid introduced in  [ ] , explores its unusual properties at finite temperature , and confirms its robustness against other competing phases for a wide range of parameters .",
    "however a number of interesting questions remain .",
    "one of these is , how would the system respond for magnetic field _ not _ aligned with the easy axis  ?",
    "an obvious limiting case is a field perpendicular to the easy axis . in this case",
    ", the two sublattices of the collinear stripe phase can respond to field simply by canting , and ( zero temperature ) mean - field calculation indicate that a canted stripe phase interpolates to saturation for all finite @xmath1 .",
    "the second obvious limit is that of a field at a small angle to the easy axis . in this case",
    ", the states described in this paper will generally survive , but the symmetries they break will be modified by the presence of a component of magnetic field in the @xmath38-@xmath39 plane .",
    "this in turn will lead to a modification of the phase transitions between them .",
    "the limit of small angle is also of relevance to experiments which measure magnetization through magnetic torque , discussed in the context of agnio@xmath0 above .",
    "away from either of these limits , for intermediate angle , the story is not so simple  the balance of energy and entropy can favour many different states .",
    "this remains an interesting topic for future study .",
    "another interesting open question is the study of the quantum mechanical effects in this spin model .",
    "the succession of continuous phase transitions observed in our model for moderate values of anisotropy , raises the intriguing possibility that a quantum magnet like agnio@xmath0 could exhibit a series of quantum phase transitions as a function of magnetic field .",
    "concentrating on the supersolid phases , two - dimensional quantum models with broadly similar hamiltonians support supersolids both at t=0 [ ref .  ] and finite temperature@xcite .",
    "however , recent calculations suggest that the supersolid phase in the original three - dimensional model considered by liu and fisher may not survive quantum fluctuations @xcite .",
    "each case therefore needs to be considered on its own merits .",
    "one simple , phenomenological , way to incorporate quantum fluctuations is through the addition an effective biquadratic interaction term , mimicking the selection of collinear states by quantum fluctuations@xcite .",
    "we have checked within classical monte carlo simulations that such a term does not change the nature of the transition into the supersolid phase . on the strength of this , and on general grounds",
    ", we anticipate that the supersolid introduced in [ ] will prove robust against quantum effects .",
    "however this remains to be tested .",
    "the advent of high field facilities offering static fields of up to 45 t , and pulsed fields of up to 600 t , has made it possible to explore the high - field properties of a wide range of magnets for the first time .",
    "frustrated magnets are foremost among these , with model systems like tlcucl@xmath3 providing a perfect opportunity to study how the bose - einstein condensation of magnons gives rise to a magnetic superfluid  [ ref .  ] .",
    "generically , these systems exhibit some degree of magnetic anisotropy , either at the level of a single ion , or in their exchange interactions .",
    "triangular lattice antiferromagnets are no exception .",
    "examples with weak easy - axis anisotropy ( relative to exchange interactions ) include the quasi - two dimensional halides vbr@xmath0 and vcl@xmath0@xcite , which contain antiferromagnetically coupled spin-3/2 v@xmath175 ions on a triangular lattice . the insulating oxide rb@xmath6mn(moo@xmath6)@xmath3  @xcite and the multiferroic material rbfe(moo@xmath6)@xmath0  @xcite , are well - described by a spin-5/2 nearest - neighbour heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice with moderate easy - axis anisotropy ( rb@xmath6mn(moo@xmath6)@xmath3 ) , or easy - plane anisotropy ( rbfe(moo@xmath6)@xmath0 ) .",
    "the multiferroic material kfe(moo@xmath6)@xmath0 has similar underlying chemistry to rbfe(moo@xmath6)@xmath0 , but a distortion of the triangular lattice leads to a somewhat more complex phenomenology  @xcite .",
    "much stronger single - ion anisotropy , of order of the exchange interactions , is found in the hexagonal ni halides csnicl@xmath3 , csnibr@xmath3@xcite and in the cr oxide licro@xmath0@xcite , where triangularly coordinated @xmath9=3/2 spins order on the magnetic easy - axis .",
    "the insulating oxide    further examples are found in the delafossite family , including @xmath9=5/2 cufeo@xmath0  @xcite , @xmath9=3/2",
    "pdcro@xmath0@xcite and @xmath9=1 agnio@xmath0@xcite with easy - axis anisotropy , and @xmath9=3/2 cucro@xmath0@xcite with easy - plane anisotropy . notably , all of these delafossite materials require a frustrated model such as eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) , with second ( or further ) neighbour interactions , to accurately describe their magnetic properties . here",
    "we have concentrate on agnio@xmath0 , where powder neutron scattering studies provide clear evidence for a collinear , stripe ground state in zero magnetic field  @xcite , as would be expected for the frustrated , easy  axis model considered in this paper with moderate @xmath12 and @xmath1 .    at present , single crystals of agnio@xmath0 are too small for inelastic neutron scattering experiments to be performed on them .",
    "however angle  integrated spin  wave spectra can be measured in powder samples .",
    "these show clear evidence of a spin - gap , and spectra are well - described by the present model [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) ] , with parameters @xmath11=1.32mev , @xmath12=0.20mev , @xmath1=1.78mev , @xmath13=-0.14 mev  @xcite . for spin",
    "@xmath9=1 , the effective value of @xmath1 seen in quantum spin wave spectra is renormalized by a factor two relative to its classical value  @xcite , and so comparison should be made with classical monte carlo simulation results for @xmath1=0.675@xmath176 .",
    "thus , under the ( strong ) assumption that this simple spin model provides an adequate description of agnio@xmath0 in high magnetic field , the field - temperature phase diagram for agnio@xmath0 should be of the form shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : d0675-panel ] [ @xmath1=0.675 ] . given the simplifications inherent in using _ any _ spin model to describe a metal , the critical fields and transitions temperatures predicted here should be approached with some caution .",
    "are unlikely to be quantitatively correct .",
    "however our monte carlo simulation results should provide a reasonable first guide to the different phases occuring in agnio@xmath0 in magnetic field , and the nature of the phase transitions between them .",
    "the actual phase transitions which occur in agnio@xmath0 for fields of up to 40 t , have been studied through meaurements of magnetic torque @xmath177 , heat capacity and electrical transport  @xcite .",
    "these experiments indicate that a continuous ( or very weakly first order ) phase transition out of the collinear stripe state occurs at about 12.5 t ( at a base temperature of 1.5k ) .",
    "this phase transition is accompanied by a weak anomaly in the specific heat . and ,",
    "crucially , it occurs at a critical field which increases steadily with temperature , indicating that the collinear stripe phase has a higher entropy than its successor .",
    "these are _ exactly _ the characteristics of the phase transition from the collinear stripe phase into the supersolid for the frustrated easy - axis model eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) .    in ref .",
    "[ ] we therefore proposed that a novel magnetic supersolid is realised in agnio@xmath0 for magnetic fields greater than 12.5@xmath31 .",
    "we further suggested that torque was a good tool for distinguishing phase transitions in easy - axis magnets , exhibiting changes in sign as well as in magnitude , and made explicit predictions for the torque signature of the proposed magnetic supersolid  @xcite .",
    "it is also interesting to note that torque clearly distinguishes those phases , such as the 2:1:1 canted phase and the 3:1 canted phase above , which have a finite magnetization @xmath131 in the @xmath38@xmath39 plane .",
    "the results of this paper confirm that the scenario presented in [ ] is robust across a wide range of parameter space , and does not require any special assumptions or fine - tuning of the model . in this context it would be interesting to look for evidence of the spin gap closing at the putative supersolid transition in agnio@xmath0 , either from powder neutron scattering , or nmr relaxation rates .",
    "however it is important also to remember this model is a gross simplification of the physics of agnio@xmath0 , which contains itinerant electrons as well as local moments .",
    "the development of a more realistic model for agnio@xmath0 , which takes these itinerant electrons into account , remains an important avenue for future study .",
    "in this paper we have studied a realistic , three - dimensional spin model motivated by the hexagonal delafossite 2h - agnio@xmath0 .",
    "we have obtained the full magnetic phase diagram of this model as a function of temperature and magnetic field for values of easy - axis anisotropy @xmath1 ranging from the heisenberg ( @xmath1=0 ) to the ising ( @xmath1=@xmath2 ) limits .",
    "we uncovered a rich variety of different magnetic phases , including several phases which are magnetic supersolids ( in the sense of matsuda and tstuneto or liu and fisher ) , one of which may already have been observed in agnio@xmath0@xcite .",
    "we explored how this particular supersolid , first introduced in  [ ] , arises through the closing of a gap in the spin - wave spectrum , and how it competes with neighbouring phases as the easy - axis anisotropy is increased .",
    "this novel phase was shown to have qualitatively different finite - temperature properties from any previously studied magnetic supersolid , and to be remarkably robust against changes in parameters .",
    "these results suggest that magnetic supersolids in frustrated systems can have a richer phonomenolgy , and be far more robust , than previously supposed .",
