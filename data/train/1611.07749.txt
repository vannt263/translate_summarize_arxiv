    "its symmetry properties ( degeneracy ) , captured by pseudospin description , are determined by the gross features of the ligand field and do not depend on the material details .",
    "the size of the local magnetic moment , encoded in the @xmath3-factor , is affected by hybridization with ligands which modifies the shape of the local orbitals .",

    "first we carried out _ ab initio _ calculations within the the generalized gradient approximation  @xcite to the density functional theory using the full - potential code wien2k .",
    "@xcite we studied three compounds : the cubic perovskite srvo@xmath9 ( svo ) as a simple model system to debug our codes and two cubic double perovskites bnoo and byoo as the actual goals of the present work .",

    "next , the wannier functions ( wfs ) with the @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 symmetry spanning the isolated @xmath16 manifold were obtained using the wannier90@xcite and wien2wannier@xcite codes . without soi these wfs are well defined by their symmetry properties . with soi",
    "this in general is not the case due to mixing of the spin species .",
    "however , since the effect of soi is predominantly localized on the @xmath0 ion , it is possible to construct the wfs which are to high accuracy eigenstates of the spin @xmath23 operator .",
    "the on - site one - particle hamiltonian in this @xmath16 wannier basis has the textbook form .",
    "we have used @xmath24 @xmath25-mesh for svo and @xmath26 @xmath25-mesh for bnoo and byoo , which ensured that the wfs were spatially well separated from their aliases .",

    "the maximum values of @xmath15 for this expansion were @xmath33=16 for svo and 30 for bnoo and byoo , which were sufficient to capture 99% of the wf .",

( [ eq2 ] ) yields @xmath52 which amounts to @xmath53 .      the structural and magnetic properties of byoo ware recently investigated by kermarrec  _ et al . _",
    "@xcite , who reported a frustrated a - type antiferromagnet ( afm ) with the nel temperature @xmath54  69  k , curie - weiss temperature @xmath55  k , and the effective paramagnetic moment @xmath56  @xmath57 close to the spin only value of 3.87  @xmath57 .    using the above procedure we have obtained @xmath41 of 0.587 for wannier functions built from the subspace spanning the os @xmath0 bands ( @xmath7-only model ) .",
    "next , we have used the on - site part of the tight - binding hamiltonian ( including soi ) augmented with the atomic - like coulomb interaction , parameterized with @xmath58  ev and @xmath59  ev  @xcite , and diagonalized it .",
    "the fourfold degenerate ground state can be represented as @xmath60 pseudospin . calculating the matrix elements of the magnetic moment @xmath49 in the ground state multiplet",
    ", we arrive at the @xmath3-factor of 1.89 , leading to @xmath61 .",
    "the matrix elements of @xmath62 and @xmath63 are shown in the appendix .",
    "this shows that even the relatively strong soi leads to only a small correction in case of a half - filled @xmath0 ( @xmath16 ) shell and that the local moment is dominated by the spin component.@xcite    next , we have calculated the effective interaction between the @xmath60 pseudospins on the nearest- and next - nearest - neighbor ( nnn ) bonds .",
    "a full @xmath64 interaction matrix was calculated using the perturbation theory in hopping ( ` @xmath65'-expansion ) and expanded in spherical tensors .",
    "consistent with the dominant spin nature of the pseudospins we find that the isotropic dipole - dipole exchange dominates by more than order of magnitude .",
    "a small anisotropy was found between @xmath66  mev and @xmath67  mev the interaction of components in and out - of the cubic plane for a given nn bond .",
    "the nnn interactions are about 30 times weaker than the nn ones .",
    "the dominant nn afm interaction is consistent with the a - type ordering .",
    "we also point out the exchange anisotropy favors the ordered moments to lie in the ferromagnetic ( fm ) planes . however , the observed anisotropy is rather small to draw solid conclusions without detailed calculations , which are beyond the scope of the present study .",
    "the estimated curie - weiss temperature @xmath68  k is somewhat smaller than the experimental value .",
    "both the theoretical and experimental values contain uncertainties . on the theoretical side",
    "it is the value of the on - site coulomb interaction @xmath69 and the limitations of the perturbative expansion . on the experimental side",
    "it is in particular the temperature range of the study which is substantially below the experimental @xmath70 as pointed by authors of ref .",
    "bnoo is a unusual example of @xmath5 mott insulator .",
    "it exhibits a fm polarization below 10  k.@xcite the crystal and magnetic structures are still under debate .",
    "specific heat measurements indicate that only @xmath71 entropy is released above the transition temperature which contradicts the fourfold degenerate @xmath60 ground state in cubic site symmetry .",
    "the structural measurements , nevertheless , indicate that a potential non - cubic distortion must be rather small . in the following ,",
    "we address the question of the origin of the high temperature paramagnetic response and the size of the @xmath3-factor .",
    "this is motivated by an observation that the magnetic moment @xmath49 has only zero matrix elements within the ground state @xmath60 multiplet of @xmath5 system .",
    "@xcite in other words , in the @xmath60 quadruplet the spin and orbital contributions to the magnetic moment exactly compensate each other .",
    "this conclusion remains valid also in case of weak non - cubic perturbations as long as the mixing with excited @xmath72 states can be neglected .",
    "the likely explanation of the paramagnetic moment is the fact that the local orbitals ( wannier functions ) do not have the exact @xmath7-symmetry , but contain also higher harmonics which rescale the orbital momentum by @xmath41 .",
    "the interaction is not effective in the @xmath5 case and thus we only need to consider the soi .",
    "the relationship between @xmath3 and @xmath41 in the @xmath60 ground state is given by @xmath73 .",
    "our calculations yield @xmath74 leading to @xmath75 and @xmath76 . the calculated matrix elements @xmath38 as well as @xmath77 and @xmath63 are shown in the appendix .",
    "this value compares well to the experimentally reported values of 0.596 - 0.647  @xcite and 0.677  @xcite .",
    "we have presented a first principles calculation of the @xmath3-factors of @xmath0 ions in selected double perovskite mott insulators .",
    "the calculated effective paramagnetic moments @xmath51 compare well to their experimental counterpart obtained from curie - weiss fits to the high temperature susceptibility .",
    "we find that even in the case of @xmath0 electrons with relatively strong soi the half - filled shell @xmath4 configuration is dominated by the first hund s rule and the local moments have predominantly spin character . in @xmath5 configuration",
    "the spin and orbital contributions to @xmath51 cancel each other for orbitals with pure @xmath7 character .",
    "the admixture of higher harmonics to the @xmath7-like wannier functions due to the hybridization with ligands partially lifts this exact cancelation and gives rise to small @xmath51 observed in experiments .",
