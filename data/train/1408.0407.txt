    "as the semiconductor process further scales down to the 14 nanometer logic node and beyond , the industry encounters many lithography - related issues .",
    "triple patterning lithography ( tpl ) @xcite is one of the most promising candidates as next generation lithography techniques , along with extreme ultraviolet lithography ( euvl ) , electron beam lithography ( ebl ) , directed self - assembly ( dsa ) , and nanoimprint lithography ( nil ) @xcite .",
    "however , all these new techniques are challenged by some problems , such as tremendous technical barriers , or low throughput . therefore , tpl earns more attentions recently from both industry and academia .",
    "one conventional process of tpl , called lelele , is with the same principle of litho - etch - litho - etch ( lele ) type double patterning lithography ( dpl ) . here",
    "`` l '' and `` e '' represent one lithography process and one etch process , respectively . although lelele process has been widely studied by industry and academia , there are twofold issues derived .",
    "on one side , even with stitch insertion , there are some native conflicts in lelele , like 4-clique conflict @xcite .",
    "for example , fig .",
    "[ fig : tplec_le3 ] illustrates a 4-clique conflict among features @xmath0 , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 .",
    "no matter how to assign the colors , there is at least one conflict .",
    "since this 4-clique structure is common in advanced standard cell design , lelele type tpl still suffers from the native conflict problem . on the other side , compared with lele type double patterning , there are more serious overlapping problem in lelele @xcite",
    ".     + ( a ) ( b )     + ( a ) ( b ) ( c )    to overcome all these limitations from lelele , recently lin @xcite proposed a new tpl manufacturing process , called lele - end - cutting ( lele - ec ) . as a tpl , this new manufacturing process contains three mask steps , namely first mask , second mask , and _ trim _ mask .",
    "[ fig : tplec ] illustrates an example of the lele - ec process . to generate target features in fig .",
    "[ fig : tplec](a ) , the first and second masks are used for pitch splitting , which is similar to lele type dpl process .",
    "these two masks are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : tplec](b ) .",
    "finally , a trim mask is applied to trim out the desired region as in fig .",
    "[ fig : tplec](c ) . in other words ,",
    "the trim mask is used to generate some end - cuts to further split feature patterns .",
    "although the target features are not lelele - friendly , they are lele - ec process friendly that with lele - ec the features can be decomposed without any conflict .",
    "in addition , if all cuts are properly designed or distributed , lele - ec can introduce better printability then conventional lelele process @xcite .    for a design with four short features , fig .",

    "we can make several observations from these simulated images . first , there are some round - offs around the line ends ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tplec_le3_img ] ( c ) ) .",
    "second , to reduce the round - off issues , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : tplec_ec_img ] ( b ) , in lele - ec process the short lines can be merged into longer lines , then the trim mask is used to cut off some spaces .",
    "it shall be noted that there might be some corner roundings due to the edge shorting of trim mask patterns . however , since the line shortening or rounding is a strong function of the line width @xcite , and we observe that usually trim mask patterns can be much longer than line - end width , thus we assume the rounding caused by the trim mask is insignificant . this assumption is demonstrated as in fig .",

    "in addition , the related constraints have been considered in early physical design stages , like routing @xcite , standard cell design @xcite , and detailed placement @xcite .",

    "<S> triple patterning lithography ( tpl ) is one of the most promising techniques in the 14 nm logic node and beyond . </S>",
    "<S> conventional lelele type tpl technology suffers from native conflict and overlapping problems . </S>",
    "<S> recently , as an alternative process , triple patterning lithography with end cutting ( lele - ec ) was proposed to overcome the limitations of lelele manufacturing . in lele - ec process </S>",
    "<S> the first two masks are lele type double patterning , while the third mask is used to generate the end - cuts . </S>",
    "<S> although the layout decomposition problem for lelele has been well - studied in the literature , only few attempts have been made to address the lele - ec layout decomposition problem . in this paper we propose the comprehensive study for lele - ec layout decomposition . </S>",
    "<S> conflict graph and end - cut graph are constructed to extract all the geometrical relationships of both input layout and end - cut candidates . </S>",
    "<S> based on these graphs , integer linear programming ( ilp ) is formulated to minimize the conflict number and the stitch number . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms .    </S>",
