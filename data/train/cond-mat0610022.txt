    "the analysis of financial time series has become an important field of application for physicists . a special role plays the analysis of serial correlation in the time series , as it gives useful insight to the price formation mechanism .",
    "the study of serial correlation is not new , both in econometrics and econophysics .",
    "the presence of serial correlation in the time series of log - returns is forbidden by the efficient market hypothesis in its weak form , see  @xcite . at daily level",
    "the presence of these fluctuations has been found in several markets and interpreted in the rational framework , with non - synchronous trading  @xcite or institutional factors  @xcite , or invoking behavioral factors  @xcite .",
    "+ the number of works on serial correlation with intraday and high - frequency data is , at our knowledge , very limited due mainly to the presence of microstructure effects in the time series that make difficult a direct analysis of the problem .",
    "recent examples are refs .",
    "@xcite on the italian futures index ,  @xcite on the exchange rates and  @xcite on the indian market . in this paper",
    "we show how the adoption of popular methods of statistical data analysis to infer about the presence of serial correlations at intraday level , can be meaningful interpreted at the light of econometrics measures , if the microstructure of the market is correctly taken into account .",
    "particularly , we adopt a simple analysis of the power spectrum ( psa ) associated with the signal , and the famous detrended fluctuation analysis ( dfa ) method . + the paper is organized as follows : sections",
    "[ psa ] and  [ dfa ] introduce the statistical instruments used , the data set is described in section  [ data ] , section  [ methodology ] shows the methodology that we employ and discuss the results at the light of recent works on the same topic , while section  [ conclusion ] concludes .",
    "let @xmath0 be a stochastic process , we define the power spectrum as the square modulus of the fourier transform of the signal , namely : @xmath1 the power spectrum is linked to the autocorrelation function of the signal by the wiener - khintchine theorem , namely by the following equation : @xmath2 which admits the following inverse relation : @xmath3 in absence of correlations , the correlation function is @xmath4peaked and the power spectrum is flat ( white noise ) .",
    "if on the contrary there is serial correlation , this does not hold anymore and therefore we observe a decay in the power spectrum with the frequency as follows : @xmath5 by monitoring the decay of @xmath6 we can infer about the memory properties of the time series under study . to perform the psa we use a fast fourier transform algorithm .",
    "the method of dfa has been widely adopted in the literature , starting from the analysis of dna sequences  @xcite to financial time series  @xcite , from ecological applications  @xcite to nuclear reactions related problems  @xcite .",
    "it consists on the evaluation of the scaling properties of the locally detrended standard deviation of the time series .",
    "we shall now briefly introduce the algorithm .",
    "+ let again @xmath7 , ( @xmath8 ) be a stochastic process .",
    "the method consists on the following steps :    * build the integrated time series @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the mean value of the signal ; * divide the new sequence in @xmath11 non - overlapping subsequences of length @xmath12 ; * evaluate the local trend of each subsequence , @xmath13 ; * evaluate the summation of the differences between the integrated time series and the local trend in the time window @xmath12 , and take its standard deviation , t. i. the quantity : @xmath14 ^ 2}.\\ ] ]    the modified standard deviation @xmath15 so built has the following scaling property : @xmath16 if @xmath17 the process is a white noise and there no autocorrelation ; if @xmath18 , then there is significant autocorrelation in the time series . in the next section",
    "we shall describe the data set we use for the analysis of this paper .",
    "the data set at our disposal consists of all the transactions taken from the italian futures on the stock index s&pmib , named fib30 , in the period from january 2000 to december 2002 .",
    "we use only the next - to - expiration contracts .",
    "the data are evenly spaced according to a previous interpolation procedure at a time lag of @xmath19 minute .",
    "the spacing has the effect of getting rid of microstructure effects that can spoil the analysis , see ref .",
    "@xcite for a complete discussion .",
    "we have @xmath20 trading days , for a total of @xmath21 transactions . after the spacing procedure",
    ", we have @xmath22 @xmath23minute returns per day .",
    "the same data set has been also used in recent publications , see refs .",
    "+ in the next section we shall see how the analysis is performed .",
    "in this section we describe the methodology that we use to evaluate the memory properties of the time series .",
    "we apply the methods introduced in the previous sections to three time series : one made of high - frequency returns , whose memory properties are unknown , one obtained by shuffling the returns and therefore without memory , and one of absolute returns , which are known to be long range autocorrelated .",
    "we repeat the procedure for every day of our data set and build the distribution of the coefficients obtained from the psa and the dfa .",
    "we then plot the three distributions and compare them to infer the memory characteristics of the original time series .",
    "the results are in figs .",
    "[ fft60 ] and  [ dfa60 ] .     obtained from the psa algorithm on three time series : a time series of absolute returns ( dotted line ) , a time series of shuffled returns ( dashed line ) and the original time series of returns ( solid line).,width=453,height=226 ]     obtained from the application of dfa on three time series : a time series of absolute returns ( dotted line ) , a time series of shuffled returns ( dashed line ) and the original time series of returns ( solid line).,width=453,height=226 ]    it is evident from the figures that both the methods agree in detecting no memory in the time series of shuffled returns : both distributions are centered around the expected value , that is @xmath24 for psa and @xmath25 for dfa .",
    "we note that the standard deviation of the distributions is a reliable measure of the statistical uncertainty of the coefficient .",
    "moreover the results of the two methods when applied to the time series of absolute returns are , as expected , compatible with the hypothesis of long memory of this time series .",
    "when applied to the time series of real returns , both dfa and psa suggest the presence of short memory effects in the time series , being the distributions of coefficients between the other two .",
    "+ in order to properly address the results we refer again to ref .",
    "@xcite , where the authors were able to prove , adopting only econometric indicators , the presence of short memory in the time series of returns .",
    "our study therefore suggests that the adoption of dfa and psa is effective in the evaluation of short and long term memory in financial time series .",
    "in this paper we prove that an effective relation exists between what is expected adopting scaling method of analysis , as dfa , spectral methods , as psa , and econometric indicators , as in ref .",
    "@xcite in the evaluation of intraday serial correlations in high - frequency financial time series .",
    "as far as our knowledge is concern this study is the first to highlight this equivalence on high - frequency data .",
    "we think that might be interesting to extend the analysis on more liquid markets , as the us stock market , and we plan to address this problem in the future ."
