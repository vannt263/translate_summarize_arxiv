    "starting from the pioneering works of edwards @xcite , statistical studies of winding properties of topologically constrained random processes have been a subject of keen interest in various contexts such as in the physics of polymers @xcite , the fluxlines in superconductors @xcite and many others .",
    "the winding properties of planar brownian paths have also been a subject of interest to mathematicians for a long time . in 1958 , spitzer @xcite studied the distribution of the total angle @xmath1 wound by a planar brownian path around a prescribed point in time @xmath0 .",
    "he showed that in the large time limit the scaled random variable @xmath2 has a cauchy distribution _",
    "i.e. _ with infinite first moment . later",
    ", various generalizations and extensions of this classic result have been put forward @xcite .",
    "further asymptotic laws of planar brownian motion unifying and extending this approach to the case of @xmath3 different points were obtained by pitman and yor @xcite .",
    "recently , winding properties of other planar processes such as time correlated gaussian process @xcite , schramm - loewner evolution@xcite , loop erased random walk @xcite and conformally invariant curves @xcite have also been studied .",
    "for constrained brownian trajectories on a surface , the methods of computing probabilities associated with the winding properties are mathematically similar to the path integral of a quantum particle coupled to magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "this similarity has been exploited in various situations , for example , the algebraic number of full turns a polymer makes around a cylinder on which it lays , can be analyzed by studying the physics of a charged quantum particle interacting with a tube of magnetic flux @xcite .",
    "thermal fluctuation in the trajectory of a vortex defect in the superconducting order parameter @xcite , which are characterized by winding numbers , can be analyzed by studying path integrals of a polymer melt .",
    "these kind of path integral techniques have also been used to study other quantities , like e.g. the area between a brownian path and its subtending chord @xcite .",
    "other functionals of the brownian motion that occur in the context of weak localization have been discussed in @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study winding properties of a brownian particle moving on a ring of unit radius ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) analytically . in mesoscopic physics ,",
    "such diffusion on a ring geometry appears important in quantum transport through a connected ring .",
    "the weak localization correction to the classical conductance of the ring can be computed from the knowledge of the net number of complete turns around the ring @xcite .",
    "here we are , in particular , interested in the distributions of total number of turns @xmath4 and the net number of counter - clockwise turns @xmath5 the particle makes around the circle till time @xmath0 in the following two different cases : ( a ) _ free _ : the position @xmath1 of the particle at time @xmath0 is not constrained and , ( b ) _ constrained _ : the position @xmath1 of the particle at time @xmath0 is constrained to be the starting point ( a in fig . [ fig1 ] ) _ i.e. _ @xmath6 where @xmath7 is an integer .",
    "the path configurations in case ( b ) are called brownian bridges on a circle .",
    "if @xmath1 represents the position of the particle on the circle , then its stochastic evolution is given by the following equations @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the diffusion constant and @xmath10 is a mean zero white gaussian noise .",
    "as time increases , the particle turns around the circle both clockwise and counter - clockwise .",
    "let @xmath11 be the number of full counter clockwise turns and @xmath12 be the number of full clockwise turns the particle makes in time @xmath0 , then the total number of full turns and the net number of full counter - clockwise turns are given by @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively .",
    "clearly , @xmath4 and @xmath5 are random variables and they are called the total winding number and net winding number respectively .",
    "we would like to compute the distributions @xmath15 of @xmath4 , @xmath16 of @xmath5 and also the joint distribution @xmath17 for both the _ free _ and the _ constrained _ cases . in previous studies for example in the context of polymers @xcite , in the context planar brownian trajectories @xcite or in the context of vortex lines in type ii superconductors @xcite , path integral techniques have been successfully used to evaluate winding statistics of net winding numbers , where one maps the problem of finding the probabilities to the problem of finding the propagator of a suitable quantum particle .",
    "in contrast , here it seems adapting the path integral techniques is not easy .",
    "for example , it is hard to implement the path integral techniques for computing the distributions of quantities like the total winding number @xmath4 and the net winding number @xmath5 especially in the _ free _ case .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present an alternative method based on _ renewal _ properties of the process that allows us to compute the winding distribution exactly .",
    "next we study the case where the trajectories of the brownian particle are constrained to be exactly at @xmath41 with @xmath42 at time @xmath0 . in this case",
    "we denote the probability distributions of @xmath3 and @xmath18 by @xmath43 and @xmath44 respectively and the joint distribution by @xmath45 where the subscript `` c '' stands for _ constrained _ trajectories .",
    "we find exact expressions of these distributions at any time @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we show that in the large @xmath0 limit , the scaling forms and the large deviation functions associated to the distributions @xmath43 and @xmath44 are exactly same as in the previous case _ i.e _ the scaling distributions are described by the same functions @xmath46 and @xmath47 whereas the large deviation functions are also described by @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "[ free ] we study the winding statistics for the _ free _ case _ i.e. _ for unconstrained brownian motion on the ring . in the beginning of this section",
    "we discuss in detail about the connection between making a complete turn around the circle and making first exit from a box of size @xmath48 .",
    "then in the subsection [ mvs - dis ] we compute the time dependence of the moments of @xmath3 and @xmath18 and also their scaling distributions . in the next subsection [ ldfs ]",
    "we find the large deviation forms associated to the distributions @xmath15 and @xmath16 . in subsection [ exact ]",
    "we derive exact explicit expressions of the @xmath15 and @xmath16 for arbitrary @xmath3 and @xmath18 . after completing the analysis for the _ free _ case , in section [ brow - brdg ] we study the moments and the distributions @xmath43 and @xmath44 corresponding to @xmath3 and @xmath18 for brownian bridge on a ring . in the last section [ conclusion ] we present our conclusion .",
    "few details are left in the appendix .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , the renewal properties of the brownian walker helps us to find the distributions of the number of complete counter - clockwise turns @xmath11 and the number of complete clockwise turns @xmath12 around the circle in time @xmath0 . to see how , let us look at ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] ) a typical trajectory of the brownian particle on the ring , starting at the origin . in fig .",
    "[ fig1a ] we see that the particle makes its first full turn around the circle at time @xmath49 when it makes , starting at the origin , a first exit from the box @xmath50 $ ] ( magenta box ) . in the next time interval",

    "similar first exit events happen for each of the successive complete turns at later time intervals except in the last time interval where the particle may not have enough time to perform a complete turn .",
    "so we see that , each complete turn around the circle is associated to a first exit from a box of size @xmath48 given that the particle starts from the center of the box and after each complete turn the location of the center of the box gets shifted to the particle s current position to perform similar first exit for the next complete turn _",
    "i.e. _ to renew the first exit process for the next complete turn .    .",
    "this particular trajectory wounds the circle around completely five times in time intervals @xmath55 successively .",
    "each of these complete turn around the circle is associated to the first exit of the particle from a box of size @xmath48 given that the particle started from the center of the box .",
