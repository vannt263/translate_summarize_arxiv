    "non - local ( crossed ) andreev reflection @xcite is the process which occurs in multi - terminal hybrid normal metal - superconductor - normal metal ( nsn ) proximity structures and involves two subgap electrons entering a superconductor from two _ different _ normal terminals and forming a cooper pair there .",
    "this is in contrast to the standard mechanism of ( local ) andreev reflection @xcite ( ar ) in which case two subgap electrons enter a superconductor from the same normal electrode through the same interface .",
    "the phenomenon of crossed andreev reflection ( car ) manifests itself , e.g. , in the dependence of the current @xmath0 through the left ns interface of an nsn structure on the voltage @xmath1 across the right ns interface . as a result ,",
    "the non - local conductance @xmath2 of an nsn device differs from zero and can be detected experimentally .",
    "such experiments have recently been performed by several groups @xcite providing a number of interesting observations some of which remain not fully understood .",
    "it is important to mention that car is not the only process which contributes to the non - local conductance @xmath3 .",
    "another relevant process is direct electron transfer ( det ) between two normal terminals through the superconductor . in the tunneling limit",
    "this process is nothing but the so - called elastic cotunneling ( ec ) .",
    "it turned out @xcite that in the lowest order in tunneling the contributions from ec and car to @xmath3 exactly cancel each other in the limit of low temperatures and voltages , i.e. the non - local conductance @xmath3 should vanish in this limit .",
    "note that this result @xcite is applicable only provided transmissions of both ns interfaces remain small which is not always the case in the experiments . at higher transmissions processes to all orders should be taken into account and the contributions of det and car do not anymore cancel each other .",
    "hence , @xmath3 does not vanish beyond the tunneling limit . in the case of ballistic electrodes a non - perturbative ( in barrier transmissions ) theory was recently developed by kalenkov and one of the authors @xcite .",
    "this theory allowed to study the non - local conductance of nsn devices at arbitrary transmissions leading to a conclusion that car contribution to @xmath3 _ vanishes _ in the limit of fully open ns barriers .",
    "this result might seem counterintuitive since ordinary ( local ) ar reaches its maximum at full barrier transmissions .",
    "in contrast , car is essentially a non - local effect which requires `` mixing '' of trajectories for electrons going between two normal terminals with those for electrons going deep into a superconductor and describing the flow of cooper pairs out of the contact area .",
    "provided there exists no normal electron reflection at both ns interfaces such mixing does not occur , car vanishes and the only remaining contribution to @xmath3 in this case is one from det .    for completeness , let us point out that the exact cancellation between ec and car contributions @xcite can also be violated by other means",
    ". one of them is simply to lift the spin degeneracy in the system .",
    "this can be achieved , e.g. , by considering nsn structures with spin - active interfaces @xcite or by using ferromagnets ( f ) as normal metallic electrodes @xcite .",
    "experiments with fsf structures @xcite directly demonstrated the dependence of the non - local conductance @xmath3 on the polarization of f - electrodes .",
    "yet another way to avoid the cancellation between ec and car terms already in the tunneling limit is to include interactions .",
    "this idea has been put forward in ref . .",
    "the effect of electron - electron interactions on non - local conductance of nsn devices  in particular in the presence of disorder  is an interesting issue to be investigated further .",
    "such investigation is , however , beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "here we only want to point out that interactions are not very likely to play the dominant role in the experiments @xcite .",
    "this is because typical resistances involved in these experiments were rather low and the corresponding dimensionless conductances strongly exceeded unity . under such conditions",
    "the effect of coulomb interactions on ar is weak @xcite and a similar situation with ec and car can be expected . in general , however , the combined effect of electron - electron interactions and disorder on non - local properties of nsn devices can be important .    in the absence of coulomb interaction the effect of disorder on non - local electron transport in nsn",
    "was recently considered in refs . .",
    "brinkman and golubov @xcite employed the quasiclassical formalism of usadel equations and proceeded perturbatively in the interface transmissions .",
    "they found that the proximity effect in the normal electrodes in combination with disorder can strongly enhance both ec and car contributions to the non - local conductance .",
    "duhot and melin @xcite argued that weak - localization - type of effects inside the superconductor may influence non - local electron transport in nsn structures .",
    "@xcite considered a device with normal terminals attached to a superconductor via an additional _ normal _ island ( dot ) and analyzed this structure within the framework of the circuit theory . in this paper",
    "we will extend and generalize this model by considering a _ superconducting _ dot attached to one superconducting and two normal terminals as shown in fig . 1 .",
    "our main goal is to study the combined effect of proximity and disorder _ inside _ the superconductor ( dot ) .",
    "in addition , as it was demonstrated in experiments @xcite , non - equilibrium effects , such as charge imbalance , inside a superconducting electrode may play a significant role .",
    "these effects will be included into our consideration too .",
    "we are going to show that the `` peaked '' temperature dependence of the non - local resistance @xmath4 observed in the experiments @xcite can be explained as a result of the competition between charge imbalance and andreev reflection . the crossover temperature between these two processes @xmath5 ( defined in eq .",
    "( [ tstar ] ) below ) sets the position of the maximum in the dependence @xmath6 .    in order to illustrate the main idea of our approach",
    "let us recall that the exact cancellation between ec and car terms @xcite occurs only at energies below the superconducting gap while at higher energies ( or in the normal state ) car vanishes and ec remains the only relevant mechanism of electron transport .",
    "it is clear , therefore , that including the proximity effect due to the presence of normal electrodes immediately yields non - zero subgap density of states inside the supercoducting electrode which in turn should yield a decrease of car , thus eliminating its compensation by ec and leaving the non - local conductance @xmath3 non - zero .",
    "this is precisely what we find . in order to correctly account for the above effects it is necessary to proceed non - perturbatively in tunneling and consider interface conductances exceeding unity . under these conditions",
    "the concept of elastic cotunneling becomes irrelevant and it would be more appropriate to speak about direct electron transfer between two n - electrodes which includes processes of all orders in the interface transmissions .",
    "the structure of our paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we will introduce our model and outline the formalism to be used below . in sec .",
    "3 we will evaluate the green - keldysh functions of our system which will be used in sec . 4 in order to derive the general expressions for the non - local currents in our nsn device .",
    "in the limit of low bias voltages these general results are further analyzed in details in sec . 5 where we also illustrate their relation to previous theoretical works and to experimental findings @xcite .",
    "below we will consider a chaotic superconducting quantum dot with the mean level spacing @xmath7 connected to one superconducting ( @xmath8 ) and two normal ( @xmath9 and @xmath10 ) massive electrodes by means of tunnel barriers .",
    "this structure is schematically shown in fig .",

    "<S> does not cancel that of direct electron transfer between two normal terminals . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that temperature dependence of the non - local resistance of nsn devices is determined by the two competing processes  andreev reflection and charge imbalance  and it has a pronounced peak occurring at the crossover between these two processes . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is in a good agreement with recent experimental observations . </S>"
