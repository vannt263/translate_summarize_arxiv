    "in his general catalogue of nebulae , sir john herschel ( 1864 ) discussed two non - stellar , extended objects which were later added to the compilation of dreyer ( 1888 ) and given their long - lasting designations , ngc  6907 and ngc  6908 . translated from the shorthand notation as published ngc  6907 was described as _",
    "`` considerably faint , considerably large , very little extended , very gradually a little brighter towards the middle , mottled , 3 stars preceding '' _ , and the eastern object , ngc  6908 was said to be _",
    "`` extremely faint , very small , little extended , herschel 2076 ( aka ngc  6907 ) preceding '' .",
    "_    on the sky , the two objects discussed by herschel are found only @xmath140  arcsec apart ; a close pair by any standards , but otherwise unremarkable . with time",
    "these objects were observed again , not directly at the eyepiece of the telescope as was done by herschel , but only after having been recorded on photographic plates and then visually re - inspected by eye .",
    "what was revealed at that point in time was a single much more expansive parent object , the galaxy ngc  6907 , having a `` massive '' arm , asymmetrically placed to the east , and ` certainly ' to be identified with ngc  6908 . from this point",
    "onward this nebulous object to the east lost its independent status and was absorbed into the galactic sub - structure of ngc  6907 .",
    "subsequent observers and classifiers agreed ( e.g. , nilson 1974 ) that the dominant spiral galaxy ngc  6907 had an `` asymmetric disk '' and with `` two massive , asymmetric arms '' , the more prominent one being seen to the east .",
    "after an abbreviated search for a cause of this imbalance nilson made the point of saying in his notes that there was `` no disturbing object visible . ''",
    "this of course suggests that the asymmetry was generated internally .    in nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) ,",
    "ngc  6907 is designated as sb(s)bc ( from the rc3 , de vaucouleurs , et al .",
    "1991 ) and has a published optical radial velocity of 3,186 @xmath08  km / s ( da costa et al .",
    "a search of ned , over a circular area one degree ( @xmath1 700  kpc ) in radius , surrounding the galaxy reveals no objects with cataloged radial velocities near to ngc  6907 itself .",
    "locally ngc  6907 is quite isolated , although it is associated more widely with ic  4995 and ic  5005 in the group catalog of maia , da costa & latham ( 1989).7  mpc ) in diameter all clustered at @xmath13,100  km / s , having an rms velocity dispersion about the mean of only @xmath052  km / s .",
    "in addition to ngc  6907 itself , the galaxies making up this sheet are ic  5005 [ 3,112  km / s ] , eso  527-g019 [ 3,117  km / s ] , ic  4999 [ 3,156  km / s ] , am  2029 - 235 ned01 [ 3,065  km / s ] , am  2029 - 235 ned02 [ 3,061  km / s ] , eso  462-g025 [ 3,057  km / s ] , eso  462-g016 [ 3,054  km / s ] , eso  462-g028 [ 3,017  km / s ] , eso  596-g030 [ 3,110  km / s ] . ]",
    "until recently ngc  6908 was classified in ned as being a pofg (= part of a galaxy ) consistent with the above comments that it was a high - surface - brightness part of the asymmetric eastern arm of ngc  6907 .",
    "a picture of ngc  6907 is shown in figure  1 ( upper right panel ) taken in the b band .",
    "outside of the general catalogs there are no references in the modern literature to ngc  6908 , except for its inclusion ( without comment ) in a search for companions to barred galaxies undertaken by garcia - barreto , carrillo & vera - villamizar ( 2003 ) using ned ( after the reclassification ) , and the enigmatic identification of ngc  6908 with ngc  6907 in rc1 ( de vaucouleurs & de vaucouleurs 1961 ) .",
    "for all intents and purposes then , ngc  6908 had disappeared from the astronomical literature for the better part of the last century .",
    "the primary objective of the present study is to re - affirm the individuality of ngc  6908 and to prove that it is indeed a galaxy in its own right , albeit one heavily implicated with the disk and spiral structure of ngc  6907 . the first indication of its true identity came from multi - color imaging . and h@xmath2 )",
    "archives , the osu bright spiral galaxy survey ( deep h band ; eskridge et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the 2mass large galaxy atlas ( jhks bands ; jarrett et al . 2003 ) . ]",
    "panels in figure  1 progressively reveal ngc  6908 for what it is , and laterally show why it was so easy to mistake this object for an enhancement of the eastern arm of ngc  6907 .",
    "the upper left panel of figure  1 shows what observers using b - band photographic plates would have been confronted with .",
    "as one moves progressively to longer and longer wavelength images the color contrast between ngc  6908 ( an intrinsically red object ) and the surrounding ( intrinsically blue ) spiral structure increases . by the time the i - band image is seen the identity of ngc  6908 is already clear . indeed , the immediate visual impression from the near - infrared image is that ngc  6908 is a very early - type galaxy , an e or s0 of rather large apparent flattening .",
    "isophotometry of images at all available wavelengths confirm and quantify this impression : outside of the central 4 arcseconds ( where seeing effects are still important ) the axial ratio a / b settles down to a value in the range 0.3 - 0.4 as measured in all seven bandpasses from u to k. this gives an integer ellipticity of 6 - 7 .",
    "having established the general nature of ngc  6908 the question naturally arises : is this object a chance projection of a background galaxy along the line of sight , or is it truly involved in an on - going interaction with the large spiral , ngc  6907 ?",
    "the asymmetry in the arm structure in ngc  6907 ( ngc  6908 to the contrary ) is still very suggestive of an interaction event , be it past or present .",
    "the surface brightness profile of ngc  6908 is very close to a pure exponential at all wavelengths ( see figure  2 ) .",
    "this suggests that ngc  6908 is not a luminous elliptical ( background or otherwise ) but more likely a lenticular s0 system or even possibly a dwarf elliptical galaxy .",
    "however , the high extrapolated central surface brightness ( @xmath3=19.6  mag / arcsec@xmath4 ; see binggeli & cameron 1991 ) and the lack of a significant nuclear excess , common to the majority of dwarf ellipticals of this luminosity ( ferguson & binggeli 1994 ) , favor the classification of ngc  6908 as a lenticular s0(6/7 ) galaxy .    in order to finally exclude the possibility of ngc  6908 being a projection of a foreground or background object along the line of sight of ngc  6907 , on the night of 01 august 2002 we determined its recession velocity . on that date",
    "an optical spectrum was obtained at the 6.5 m baade telescope at las campanas ( chile ) using the b&c camera with a 1200-line grating and a 0.9-arcsec - wide slit .",
    "our 10  min exposure quickly revealed a hydrogen absorption - line spectrum including forbidden [ oii ] emission at 3727@xmath5 ; and a subsequent reduction with respect to a k - star template gave a heliocentric radial velocity of 3,113 @xmath0 73  km / s .",
    "since the parent galaxy ngc  6907 has a published radial velocity of 3,161  km / s ( rc3 ) this was immediate and conclusive proof that the two galaxies are coincident in space .",
    "this conclusion was also confirmed by the presence of h@xmath6 and possibly also h@xmath2 emission arising from the nucleus of ngc  6908 as seen in archival narrow - band images ( tuned to the redshift ngc  6907 ) obtained at the aat ( figure  3 ) .",
    "follow - up observations of both ngc  6907 and ngc  6908 were later made at the dupont 2.5 m telescope , also at las campanas , but this time using the long - slit capabilities of the wide - field camera and spectrograph so as to simultaneous measure the absolute and differential velocities of the two galaxies .",
    "those spectra are shown in figure  4 .",
    "the radial velocity derived from the emission lines in the spectrum of ngc  6908 is 3,060 @xmath0 16  km / s , while for the nucleus of ngc  6907 we obtain 3,190 @xmath0 5  km / s .",
    "this yields a velocity difference between the two systems of 130 @xmath0 17  km / s .",
    "for h@xmath7=70km / s / mpc the absolute magnitude of ngc  6908 is m@xmath8=@xmath917.4  mag .",
    "the high [ nii]@xmath106583 / h@xmath6 ( @xmath10.9 ) and [ sii]@xmath116717,6731 / h@xmath6 ( @xmath11.7 ) line ratios and relatively narrow emission lines ( fwhm @xmath12 250  km / s ) found in the spectrum of ngc  6908 suggest the existence of a seyfert 2 or more probably ( considering the high intensity of the [ sii ] doublet ) a liner nucleus in this galaxy ( e.g. ho , filippenko , & sargent 1997 ) .",
    "oxygen lines traditionally used in the classification of active nuclei ( [ oii]@xmath113726,3729 , [ oiii]@xmath105007 , [ oi]@xmath106300 ) were not detected by our spectroscopic observations .",
    "although these line ratios are compatible with emission arising from a supernova remnant ( snr ) , the h@xmath6 luminosities of snr ( especially those with high [ sii]/h@xmath6 line ratios ; see blair & long 1997 ) are well below the detection limits of both our imaging and spectroscopic observations .",
    "indeed , from the h@xmath6 equivalent width measured in the spectrum of ngc  6908 ( figure  4 ) , @xmath14 , and the @xmath13-band surface brightness in the nuclear regions of this galaxy ( @xmath118.5magarcsec@xmath14 ; figure  2 ) we estimate the h@xmath6 luminosity of ngc  6908 ( within the slit ) to be roughly @xmath110@xmath15ergs@xmath16 , which is well within the range of luminosities found in nearby liners ( terashima , ho , & ptak 2000 ) .",
    "the sum of evidence , both kinematic and morphological , suggests that the asymmetry in the disk and in the arm structure of ngc  6907 is due to an on - going and rather highly advanced interaction with the low - luminosity s0(6/7 ) galaxy ngc  6908 at a ( projected ) velocity difference of @xmath1130  km / s . and , we suggest , that the rather rare form ( _ i.e. , _ the large ellipticity ) and moderate nuclear activity of ngc  6908 are also likely due to the interaction . figure  5 shows a rgb composite map produced by combining the b ( blue ) , r ( green ) , h - band ( red ) images of the ngc  6907/8 system .",
    "in addition to the dust lanes seen along the leading edges of the spiral arms ( common in strongly barred sb and sbc galaxies like ngc  6907 ) this figure shows a dust lane crossing the western spiral arm of ngc  6907 almost perpendicular to it and extending well into the inter - arm region to the south of the galaxy nucleus ( see also sandage & bedke 1994 ) .",
    "we speculate that this feature also might well also be a by - product of the interaction between ngc  6907 and ngc  6908 .    beyond the high - surface - brightness inner disk of ngc  6907",
    "there is further evidence that a merger is underway .",
    "figure 6 shows a 10 @xmath17 10  arcmin image of the ngc  6907/8 pair cut from the digital sky survey and heavily stretched so as to emphasize very low - surface - brightness features .",
    "as can be readly seen the evidence for an earlier phase in the interaction can be seen in the asymmetrically placed tail of debris found to be extending out from the northern part of the main body of the galaxy to the west and then down to south - west .",
    "even lower surface brightness regions can also be seen to the east folding over the galaxy clock - wise to the north . had the galaxy ngc  6907 been inspected first at this low a surface - brightness level it is likely that a merger event would have been independently suggested .",
    "figure 7 is a confirming image taken with a ccd camera mounted on the 2.5 m dupont telescope on las campanas , chile",
    ". the tidal feature , although very faint and close in surface brightness to the night sky , is visible both in the blue ( photographic ) and in the red ( r - band ccd ) images , confirming its reality and general structure .",
    "once thought to be a relative brightening in the `` massive '' eastern spiral arm in the asymmetric spiral galaxy ngc  6907 , ngc  6908 is revealed by near - infrared imaging to be , in fact , a low - luminosity ( m@xmath8=@xmath917.4  mag ) s0(6/7 ) galaxy , embedded in the disk of and strongly interacting with its larger spiral galaxy host , ngc  6907 .",
    "this on - going merger of two systems is almost certainly responsible for the observed asymmetries in the disk and the spiral structure of ngc  6907 , as well as the strong , asymmetrical ( tidal debris ) tails seen at low light levels beyond the main body of the spiral .",
    "the present - day interaction may also plausibly account for the unusually large ellipticity and mild nuclear activity of ngc  6908 itself .    if this pair of galaxies was mistakenly overlooked , are there more examples of embedded companions in the disks of nearby spirals ?",
    "it seems reasonable to suppose that there are some less spectacular examples , and some more highly advanced ( more deeply embedded ) on - going mergers still awaiting revelation , even in relatively nearby galaxies already well studied at blueward wavelengths .",
    "as more near - infrared imaging of nearby galaxies comes available it will be of interest to see whether this serendipitous discovery of an embedded merger remnant generalizes to a larger number of incidents or whether this is such a short - lived part of a rare event that it alone is our only local example .    anticipating the results of a larger and more comprehensive survey ( madore 2007 , in preparation ) we can say that the answer to the above question is yes .",
    "the larger survey is based upon the simultaneous visual inspection and intercomparison of both the near - infrared and the optical images of the entire ngc galaxy sample .",
    "a few early examples , ic  5135 , ngc  0238 , ngc  5430 and ngc  5534 , are given in figure  8 .",
    "these were found by inspecting the 2mass near - infrared jhks images as made available by ned , many of which were originally published by jarrett , et al .",
    "( 2003 ) and comparing them with on - line versions of their optical images from the poss .",
    "new wavelengths reveal new phenomena .",
    "the last word goes to de vaucouleurs & de vaucouleurs ( rc1 : 1964 ) who comment that ngc  6907 is _",
    "`` slightly asymmetric , and similar to ngc  1097 '' . _",
    "the irony , of course , is that the asymmetry in ngc  1097 was , even then , clearly due to its interaction with its elliptical companion ngc  1097a ; the latter being a radial - velocity companion falling within 100  km / s of its parent galaxy and being clearly visible on any wide - field image of the system . and",
    "so now the analogy is confirmed ; at low surface - brightness levels ngc  1097 shows many of the same signs of tidal debris coming from the earlier interaction phase as in ngc  6907 . had the companion , ngc  1097a , been along the same line of sight as one of the main spiral arms of ngc  1097 the correspondence between ngc  1097 and ngc",
    "6907 would have been exact .",
    "we thank harold corwin for his comments on early descriptions of these galaxies .",
    "this research made use of the nasa / ipac extragalactic database ( ned ) which is operated by the jet propulsion laboratory , california institute of technology , under contract with the national aeronautics and space administration ."
