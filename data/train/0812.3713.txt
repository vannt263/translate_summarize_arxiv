    "magnetization reversal driven by spin - polarized electric current had attracted considerable interests over the last decade .",
    "@xcite recent experiments@xcite demonstrated that a pure spin current accompanied by no net charge current can also be used to reverse the magnetization of a ferromagnetic particle . in this setup , the particle is attached to a nonmagnetic metal wire , in which the chemical potentials of two spin components are split by using the non - local spin injection technique.@xcite by changing only the direction of injection current , the sign of the splitting can be reversed , leading to the magnetization reversal in both orientations.@xcite application of only pure spin current is appealing for spintronics devices , because it helps to reduce critical currents , joule heat , noise , etc .",
    "meanwhile , another family of intensively studied nanoscale magnetic materials , the single molecular magnets ( smm),@xcite was reported recently to be trapped in a typical field effect transistor geometry , allowing electronic transport measurement to be performed on an individual smm with great tunability.@xcite the experiment progresses inspired many transport theories of smms , including magnetic signatures of smms in transport,@xcite kondo effect,@xcite berry phase,@xcite full counting statistics,@xcite quantum computing,@xcite cotunneling,@xcite and vibrational excitation.@xcite    ion spins of magnetic metal in an smm are interlocked to form a collective giant spin , whose two maximally magnetized ground states orient to opposite directions due to uniaxial anisotropy , a property that implies to be a promising candidate for high - density information storage .",
    "therefore , one of the important issues is how to manipulate and measure the magnetization of an smm,@xcite i.e. , the processes of writing and reading qubit encoded by smm,@xcite using transport approaches .",
    "it has been discussed that spin accumulation can be induced by charge current.@xcite besides , it has been proposed that spin - polarized electric current injected from ferromagnetic electrodes can be used to switch the magnetization of smm.@xcite     and @xmath1 fermi levels of the only source lead is phenomenologically denoted as @xmath2 . throughout the work the middle point of @xmath3",
    "is set at 0 so that @xmath4 .",
    "the horizontal lines in the smm region correspond to resonant energies to add an extra electron into the smm via transitions from state @xmath5 to @xmath6 , which is tunable with respect to @xmath7 by the gate voltage @xmath8.,scaledwidth=30.0% ]    gold electrode is used in all the smm transport experiments by far,@xcite which is also among the metals ( au , ag , al , cu ) employed in nonlocal spin injection technique ( for a review , see ref . and references therein ) .",
    "therefore , it is natural to expect that the magnetization reversal achieved in ferromagnetic particle@xcite could also be realized in smm , using the nonlocal spin injection .",
    "after all , the magnetic moment of smm is much smaller than that of ferromagnetic particle .",
    "although generating considerable spin - dependent splitting of chemical potentials with high efficiency remains a challenge , it has been demonstrated experimentally by many other approaches such as the spin hall effect,@xcite the spin pumping effect@xcite and incidence of polarized light into two - dimensional electron gas.@xcite    motivated by the progresses in both the non - local spin injection and smms , in this work , we demonstrate theoretically that a pure spin current induced by the spin - dependent splitting of chemical potential ( spin bias ) in a nonmagnetic electrode@xcite is enough to reverse the smm magnetization , as shown in fig .

    "fig : model ] , where @xmath2 phenomenologically denotes the spin dependent splitting of the fermi levels for @xmath9 and @xmath10 electrons in the electrode , i.e. , @xmath11 .",
    "we find that in the context of the spin bias : ( i ) to reverse the smm magnetization , only one nonmagnetic electrode is needed .",
    "neither magnetic field@xcite nor magnetic contact @xcite is required .",
    "( ii ) only a pure spin current without accompanying a net electric current flows in the process of reversal ( fig .",
    "[ fig : avalanche ] ) , which avoids the relaxation of magnetization induced by electric current.@xcite ( iii ) it sheds a light on the mechanism of magnetization reversal from a microscopic point of view , and may be extended to mesoscopic magnetic particles or films.@xcite    moreover , we will discuss , in the context of using spin bias , several effects not addressed or not clarified in the previous literatures on the current - induced magnetic reversal in smm : ( i ) by analyzing the transition energy spectrum(fig . [ fig : transitionenergies ] ) , we find that the activation energy at which the magnetic reversal starts is determined not only by the highest,@xcite but also by the lowest transition energy , and is tunable by the gate voltage .",
    "( ii ) the smm magnetization show magnetic hysteresis loop when scanning the spin bias back and forth .",
    "the hysteresis loop can be tuned by the gate voltage and shrinks with increasing temperature ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis ] ) .",
    "( iii ) the avalanche dynamics at the magnetic reversal point is demonstrated ( fig . [",
    "fig : avalanche ] ) , which supports a microscopic magnetization reversal mechanism .",
    "( iv ) we show that the ground - state orientation of the giant spin in smm can be read out noninvasively , by measuring the charge current through smm driven by a small spin bias ( fig .",
    "[ fig : measure ] ) .",
    "( iv ) the effect of weak transverse anisotropy is considered .",
    "( v ) the situation when there is an angle between the smm easy axis and the spin quantization direction of the electrode is discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "first , we will show that the reversal mechanism is irrelevant to specific model used in sec .",
    "[ sec : mechanism ] . the model and general formalism of theoretical approach will be introduced in details in sec .",
    "[ sec : model ] . in sec ,",
    "[ sec : numericals ] , we present the numerical simulations of the hysteresis loops tunable by the gate voltage , the avalanche dynamics at the magnetic reversal point , and the nondestructive detection to the orientation of the giant spin . in sec . [",
    "sec : transverse ] , the correction by the transverse anisotropy is considered . in sec .",
    "[ sec : theta ] , the case when smm easy axis is not collinear with the spin quantization direction of the electrode is investigated .",
    "finally , a summary is presented to compare the advantages of the present work to the existing proposals .",
    "@xmath12 mv . arrows indicate all the steps required to reverse the smm magnetization from @xmath13 to @xmath14 . right ( four panels ) : the schematic of a single step that increases the smm magnetization by 1 .",
    "this mechanism is supported by the simulation shown in figs .",
    "[ fig : avalanche ] and [ fig : avalanche probabilities].,scaledwidth=45.0% ]    by far , many models are proposed to describe smm , with extra electrons added into it .",
    "these models include the giant spin model,@xcite multi - ion model,@xcite and those based on the density - functional theory.@xcite    despite the model employed , one can always select out two branches of many - body states of smm .",
    "one is for the neutral smm , the other is for when the smm is charged with an extra electron .",
    "assume the total angular momentum of the ground state of the neutral smm is @xmath15 , which has @xmath16 states for different @xmath17 component of total angular momentum , denoted as @xmath5 ( @xmath18 $ ] ) .",
    "adding the extra electron is like coupling two angular momenta , leading to two possible ground - state total angular momenta for the charged branches , @xmath19 , respectively . for simplicity , we assume the total angular momentum of the ground state of the charged branch is @xmath20 , which has @xmath21 states , denoted as @xmath22 ( @xmath23 $ ] ) . because of the easy axis anisotropy , the ground states of the two branches are @xmath24 and @xmath25 , respectively . as an example , two such branches with uniaxial anisotropy barriers are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transitions ] , using the giant spin model proposed by timm and elste.@xcite    suppose one wants to reverse the giant spin originally orienting antiparallel with the @xmath17 axis , i.e. , at the state @xmath26 or @xmath27 , to parallel orientation , i.e. , the state @xmath28 or @xmath29 . by connecting smm to the lead , one can generate a sequence of transitions that charge smm with spin - up electrons and discharge smm with spin - down electrons @xmath30 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transitions ] . during each of these transitions , the magnetic moment of an electron spin",
    "is transferred to smm , by either adding an spin-@xmath9 electron into or removing a spin-@xmath1 electron from smm .",
    "the right four panels in the fig .",
    "[ fig : transitions ] depict a typical step , in which an @xmath9 spin enters , flips to @xmath1 spin owing to the exchange coupling while increases the giant spin orientation by one unit , and escapes from smm .",
    "such a step repeats until the giant spin orientation is reversed .",
    "energetically , to generate this charging - discharging sequence , the fermi level for the spin - up electrons in the lead should be higher than all the transition energies of adding an spin - up electron from a neutral state @xmath5 to a charged state @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 while the spin - down fermi level of the lead should be lower than all the transition energies of adding an spin - down electron from a neutral state @xmath5 to a charged state @xmath33 , i.e. , @xmath34 because of the anisotropy of smm , the spectrum of the transitions for all the possible @xmath35 has a finite width , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : transitionenergies ] .",
    "therefore , the splitting of @xmath36 and @xmath37 , i.e. , the spin bias , must be large enough to overcome this spectrum width .",
    "this thereby defines a threshold spin bias for the reversal .    in the process of the reversal ,",
    "only @xmath9 electrons enter smm while only @xmath1 electrons leave smm at almost the identical rate . as a result , a nearly pure spin current , instead of electric current , flows between the lead and the smm .",
    "once the reversal is accomplished , i.e. , @xmath28 is occupied , no more @xmath38 ( @xmath1 ) electron can enter ( leave ) , and the pure spin current decays to zero .",
    "the magnetization reversal mechanism discussed above is supported by the simulation results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : avalanche ] .",
    "note that the neutral and charged branches employed in the above reversal mechanism universally exist not only within the giant spin approximation,@xcite but also in the multi - ion model@xcite and density functional theory.@xcite in the multi - ion model of lehmann and loss,@xcite the case of ferromagnetic inter - ion interaction corresponds to the type of smm discussed in the present work .",
    "the green dash - dotted lines in fig .",
    "1(a ) of their paper describe the transitions between the neutral and charged branches with the difference of the total angular momentum by @xmath39 .",
    "recent density - functional theory calculation also concludes that the total angular momenta for the ground - state neutral and anionic branches are @xmath40 and @xmath14 , respectively.@xcite therefore the above reversal mechanism should be universally described by most models proposed by far .",
    "later we will also show that the above mechanism is not qualitatively affected by the transverse anisotropy ( sec .",
    "[ sec : transverse ] ) and non - collinearity ( sec . [",
    "sec : theta ] ) .",
    "in this work , we want to focus on the possibility of using spin bias , and what we need are one neutral branch and one charged branch as discussed above .",
    "specifically , we adopt the model proposed by timm and elste@xcite to describe smm , which consists of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital ( lumo ) and the phenomenological giant spin ( gs ) @xmath41 of the molecule , @xmath42 where the first two terms depict the lumo , @xmath43 , and @xmath44(@xmath45 ) are the annihilation ( creation ) operators for the lumo , whose on - site energy is tunable by a gate voltage @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath46 is the electron charge .",
    "@xmath47 is the on - site coulomb repulsion .",
    "the third and forth terms are for the anisotropy of gs , where @xmath48 describes the easy axis anisotropy and @xmath49 accounts for the correction to the easy axis anisotropy by the occupation of lumo .",
    "@xmath50 describes the transverse anisotropy .",
    "we formally consider its possible leading terms @xmath51 for mn@xmath0ac , there is usually only @xmath52 term .",
    "we also include @xmath53 term because we want to investigate the effect of the transverse terms in a general way . for mn@xmath0ac ,",
    "@xmath52 are several orders smaller than the easy axis anisotropy @xmath48 ( table 4.1 of ref . ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that the extra electron brings no correction to them .",
    "following most experiments and theories by far,@xcite we assume the extra electrons change only the magnitude of the easy axis anisotropy .",
    "the fifth term is the energy of ions that form the giant spin , which is also proportional to @xmath8 in the same way as lumo .",
    "the last term describes the hund s rule coupling @xmath54 between the giant spin @xmath41 and the electron spin @xmath55 in the lumo .",
    "@xmath56 , where @xmath57 are the vector of pauli matrices .",
    "the hamiltonian for the electrodes used to probe smm reads @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the creation ( annihilation ) operator for a continuous state in the @xmath60(@xmath61 ) lead with energy @xmath62 and spin @xmath63 . in reality",
    ", there should be an angle @xmath64 between the easy axis of smm and the spin orientation in the electrodes , so the spin quantization in smm is denoted @xmath65 , and in the lead as @xmath66 .",
    "the operator for spin-@xmath67 electron in the lead is related to spin-@xmath68 operator through an su(2 ) rotation .",
    "the tunneling between the lumo and the electrodes is described by @xmath69+h.c.,\\nonumber\\\\\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath70 $ ] .",
    "we set the easy axis of the smm as @xmath17 axis . for @xmath71",
    "$ ] one just reverses the positive direction of @xmath17 axis . in short , the total hamiltonian for the system we are studying is @xmath72    we believe that the hamiltonian employed in this work captures the physics required for the magnetization reversal , though it is a simplified model .",
    "the physical picture of this model can be understood as follows . in a @xmath73ac molecule ,",
    "eight spin-2 @xmath74 ions and four spin-@xmath75 @xmath76 ions are exchange - coupled . as a good quantum number , their total angular momentum may adopt many values , referred as different branches .",
    "the branch with the lowest energy consists of 21 states with a total angular momentum @xmath77 .",
    "the branches with other values of total angular momentum are much higher in energy . due to the anisotropy along the easy axis ,",
    "two degenerate ground states of @xmath77 branch are the states with @xmath17 component of the total angular momentum @xmath78 , respectively . in this sense",
    "the system is regarded as a giant spin of @xmath77 , and is simply described by the term @xmath79 . by adding an extra electron , the energy of the molecule changes in several aspects : ( i ) the first is the on - site and charging energy to add this electron .",
    "this is described by @xmath80 .",
    "if we set the fermi level of the lead as the reference point , this energy can be compensated by the gate voltage , so it is absorbed into the term @xmath81 .",
    "the @xmath47 term is due to adding the second excess electron to the same lumo . to simplify the problem",
    ", we assume the second electron will also occupy the same lumo , and exclude the possibility to occupy other states .",
    "this is purely theoretical simplification , and is believed not to affect qualitatively the physical consequences in the present problem .",
    "we have to emphasize that the energy of the ions @xmath82 is also tunable to the gate voltage @xmath8 in the same way as the excess electron .",
    "it does not have to explicitly appear in the hamiltonian because it is counted in the energy of each many - body state of the smm , thus can be discarded .",
    "( ii ) second , the added electron will interact with the giant spin to form spin @xmath83 and @xmath84 branches of states .",
    "the energy difference between these two branches can be characterized by the term @xmath85 , where @xmath54 can be found by the splitting between the two branches by using first - principle calculation,@xcite because of the splitting is around @xmath86 .",
    "( iii ) the third is the correction of the anisotropy due to the excess electron .",
    "because the angular momentum of electron spin is much smaller than that of the giant spin , the variation of anisotropy in the presence of the excess electron , which mainly leads to a curvature change in the energy spectrum , can be roughly absorbed into the correction parameter @xmath49 .",
    "either the giant spin model proposed by timm and elste@xcite or by romeike and co - workers@xcite describes the above physical picture .",
    "both characterize the many - body eigen states by the electron occupation , the total angular momentum ( note that @xmath87 correspond to the total angular momentum @xmath88 ) , and the @xmath17 component of total angular momentum . when calculating the matrix elements @xmath89 .",
    "most importantly , both model are able to capture the main features of the experiments , e.g. , the sophisticated magnetic excitations and the negative differential conductance observed in the experiments.@xcite    besides , lehmann and loss@xcite think that the inclusion of the excess electron with respect to the uncharged smm should start with a multi - ion model , in which @xmath90 ion sites are considered , each with an ion spin @xmath91 .",
    "nearest ions are coupled , by either ferromagnetic or anti - ferromagnetic exchange interaction .",
    "the excess electron can occupy and hop among any of these ion sites .",
    "the hund s rule coupling between the excess electron and each ion is local , as well as the anisotropy .",
    "when considering anti - ferromagnetic inter - ion coupling , the ground state adopts a zero total angular momentum and apparently is not the case for @xmath73ac ( but valid for other smms , such as @xmath92 dimer@xcite ) .",
    "the spatial selection rules they predicted mainly occur for the anti - ferromagnetic case , thus will not be considered in this work .",
    "when considering ferromagnetic inter - ion coupling , the ground state adopts a maximal angular momentum @xmath93 .",
    "they considered only one excess electron . in this case , the electron is free to hop and couple to all the ions . as a result ,",
    "the local hund s rule coupling and anisotropy give rise to global giant spin properties . in a word , the single excess electron and ferromagnetic inter - ion case of lehmann and loss s model shares the same spirit of those by timm and elste and romeike _",
    "et al_.    the spatial selection rules are also predicted by using the density functional theory.@xcite however , because of the lead ( @xmath94 nm ) used in the experiment@xcite is much wider than the size of the molecule ( @xmath95 nm ) , we think the spatial selection rules , which need precise contacts between the lead and the ion sites of the molecule , could be smeared in realistic samples .",
    "though the coexistence of electron - phonon interaction and magnetic excitation is observed,@xcite the phonon frequency is beyond the energy scale of the current work .",
    "for example , the phonon frequency observed by heersche _ et al_.@xcite is about @xmath96 mev , while the magnetic excitations observed@xcite or in this work ( fig .",
    "[ fig : transitionenergies ] ) and the spin bias ( fig .",
    "[ fig : hysteresis ] ) are of order of mev .",
    "therefore , we do not consider electron - phonon interaction and its related effect in this work , e.g. , franck - cordon blockade@xcite or thermal - activated effect induced by spin - phonon interaction.@xcite      we will use the eigen states of @xmath97 when @xmath98 as unperturbed states.@xcite the transverse anisotropy will be taken into account by perturbation for small @xmath53 and @xmath52 .",
    "when @xmath98 , @xmath97 leads to four branches of states for the isolated smm denoted by @xmath99 , where @xmath100(@xmath101 ) is the lumo occupation and @xmath35 is the quantum number for ( @xmath102 ) , the @xmath17 component of total angular moment.@xcite degeneracy index @xmath103 only appears when @xmath104 .",
