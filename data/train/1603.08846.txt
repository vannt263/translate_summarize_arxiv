    "<S> tantalum arsenide is a member of the non - centrosymmetric monopnictides , which are putative weyl semimetals . in these materials , three - dimensional chiral massless quasiparticles , the so - called weyl fermions , are predicted to induce novel quantum mechanical phenomena , such as the chiral anomaly and topological surface states . </S>",
    "<S> however , their chirality is only well - defined if the fermi level is close enough to the weyl points that separate fermi surface pockets of opposite chirality exist . in this article , we present the bulk fermi surface topology of high quality single crystals of taas , as determined by angle - dependent shubnikov - de haas and de haas - van alphen measurements combined with _ </S>",
    "<S> ab - initio _ band - structure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> quantum oscillations originating from three different types of fermi surface pocket were found in magnetization , magnetic torque , and magnetoresistance measurements performed in magnetic fields up to @xmath0 and temperatures down to @xmath1 . of these fermi pockets , </S>",
    "<S> two are pairs of topologically non - trivial electron pockets around the weyl points and one is a trivial hole pocket . unlike the other members of the non - centrosymmetric monopnictides , taas is the first weyl semimetal candidate with the fermi energy sufficiently close to both types of weyl points to generate chiral quasiparticles at the fermi surface .    </S>",
    "<S> the non - centrosymmetric monophosphides ( tap , nbp ) and monoarsenides ( taas , nbas ) are members of a new class of topological materials , the weyl semimetals . </S>",
    "<S> these are thought to host new exotic quantum mechanical phenomena such as topological surface states @xcite and the chiral transport anomaly @xcite due to the presence of three - dimensional chiral massless weyl fermions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> quasiparticles in semimetals behave as weyl fermions if the bands disperse linearly in reciprocal space near three dimensional band crossing points ( weyl nodes ) , and the spin is locked to the wave vector @xmath2 such that the chirality is given by the sign of @xmath3 , where @xmath4 are the pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> this can be realized in semimetals with strong spin - orbit coupling and broken inversion or time - reversal symmetry , which induces pairs of weyl nodes of opposite chirality @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> probes sensitive to the fermi surface ( fs ) , such as specific heat , magnetization and electrical transport are expected to show unconventional behavior related to massless chiral fermions only if the fermi energy @xmath5 is close to the weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> more precisely , this window of energies is defined by the existence of separate fermi pockets around each weyl point ( weyl pockets ) , giving rise to quasiparticles of well - defined chirality . </S>",
    "<S> detuning the fermi energy beyond this range leads to the merging of neighboring weyl pockets and cancellation of the associated berry flux and chirality . </S>",
    "<S> thus precise knowledge of the band structure and fermi energy are needed in order to attribute observed anomalous quantum phenomena to chiral weyl fermions .     </S>",

    "<S> the grey - shaded area corresponds to the fermi energy window in which separate fermi surface pockets of opposite chirality exist . ]        </S>",
    "<S> early angle - resolved photo emission spectroscopy ( arpes ) studies observed fermi arcs on the sample surface of tap and taas and linearly dispersing bands in the bulk , proving the existence of two sets of weyl nodes ( w1 and w2 ) in these materials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , due to the limited energy resolution of arpes , the precise fermi energy location with respect to the weyl points and the resulting fs topology remained an open question . </S>",
    "<S> recently klotz _ et al . _ and arnold _ et al . </S>",
    "<S> _ reported on the bulk fs topology of nbp and tap , respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it was shown that the fermi energy in both materials is well outside the range for observing chiral weyl fermions , and the fs consists only of topologically trivial pockets .    here </S>",
    "<S> we present the first demonstration of fermi - level weyl fermions of opposite chirality in a monoarsenide or monophosphide , by showing that in as - grown crystals of taas @xmath5 is within the window of separate fs pockets around each weyk point . </S>",
    "<S> a full angular dependence study of the de haas - van alphen ( dhva ) and shubnikov - de haas ( sdh ) effect of high quality single crystals of taas was performed by means of magnetization , magnetic torque and electrical transport measurements . unlike previous studies @xcite </S>",
    "<S> , we obtain a unique solution for the fs topology by considering hitherto undiscovered quantum oscillation frequencies of the minor weyl and hole pockets , which allow us to locate the fermi energy with millielectronvolt precision .        </S>",
    "<S> the band structure of taas was calculated using the vienna _ ab - initio _ simulation package ( vasp ) @xcite ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bandstructure ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the modified becke - johnson exchange potential @xcite was employed for accurate band structure calculations . </S>",
    "<S> fss were interpolated using maximally localized wannier functions @xcite in dense k - grids ( equivalent to @xmath6 points over the entire bz ) . in the absence of spin - orbit coupling , the valence and conduction band cross each other along four so called nodal rings. these rings lie in the ( 100 ) and ( 010 ) mirror planes ( see dashed rings in fig . </S>",

    "<S> soc is found to gap out the nodal ring except for the band crossings at the weyl points . </S>",
    "<S> the grey - shaded bands in fig . [ fig : bandstructure ] give the energy range where separate weyl pockets can be found in taas .    </S>",
    "<S> crystals of taas were grown by chemical vapor transport starting from micro - crystalline powder . the initial taas powder was synthesized by reacting tantalum ( chempur @xmath7 ) and arsenic ( alfa aesar @xmath8 ) in an evacuated fused silica tube for 24 hours at @xmath9 and 24 hours at @xmath10 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> subsequently , large single crystals were grown by vapor transport in a temperature gradient between @xmath11 ( source ) an @xmath12 ( sink ) using iodine ( alfa aesar @xmath13 ) as transport agent with a concentration of @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the resulting crystals showed a residual resistivity ratio of 10 ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> s3 of the supplemental online material ( som ) @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> their crystalline structure , lattice constants and alignment were confirmed using x - ray diffraction techniques @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> quantum oscillations ( qos ) , the dhva and sdh effect , arise due to the @xmath15-periodic depopulation of landau levels ( lls ) at @xmath5 with increasing magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> their frequencies are related to the extremal fs cross section @xmath16 normal to the magnetic field , and can be used to reconstruct the fs topology of metals@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization of taas along all major axes and selected angles in between were measured in a qd @xmath17 squid - vsm at temperatures between 2 and @xmath18 ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : data]a and fig . </S>",
    "<S> s6 of the som @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> angle - dependent sdh and dhva measurements were performed in a @xmath0 quantum design ( qd ) physical - property measurement system ( ppms ) using the qd rotator probe and tqmag piezoelectric torque cantilevers @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> measurements were taken at @xmath1 while the magnetic field was swept from @xmath19 to @xmath20 ( sdh ) and @xmath19 to zero field ( dhva ) at a rate of @xmath21 at highest and @xmath22 at lowest fields . </S>",
    "<S> resistance and off - balance signals were measured using external stanford research sr830 and sr850 lock - in amplifiers . </S>",
    "<S> typical excitation currents of 1 to @xmath23 at 16 to @xmath24 were applied to the sample and tqmag cantilever . raw resistance and torque data for magnetic fields applied within the ( 100 ) and ( 110)-plane </S>",

    "<S> magnetization data and their background subtracted dhva oscillations for @xmath25 $ ] , @xmath26 $ ] and @xmath27 $ ] at @xmath28 are shown in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : data]a . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen , taas shows a diamagnetic magnetization along the @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath26$]-axis , and paramagnetic magnetization along the @xmath27$]-axis . </S>",
    "<S> strong qos are visible in all three directions . </S>",
    "<S> this is in contrast to nbp and tap where the magnetization is diamagnetic for all field directions and quantum oscillations are weak for magnetic fields applied in the @xmath30-plane @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : data]a shows the background subtracted dhva oscillations plotted against @xmath31 . </S>",
    "<S> the observed low frequencies are indicative of very small fs pockets as are typical for semimetals with low charge carrier densities . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of @xmath32 for @xmath33 $ ] agrees well with previous reports by other groups @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , we find a step - like magnetization feature along the @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath26$]-direction starting at @xmath34 or equivalently 1.4 and @xmath35 which is attributed to the quantum limit of the lowest frequency . at this step </S>",
    "<S> the dominant frequency vanishes and a second larger frequency of another fs pocket becomes visible .    </S>",
    "<S> the detailed angular dependence of the qo frequencies was determined by combined electrical transport ( see e.g. fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : data]b ) and magnetic torque measurements . </S>",
    "<S> fourier transforms of multiple field windows and measurement techniques were correlated to produce the angular dependence shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : angulardependence]a . </S>",
    "<S> table [ tab : summary ] contains a summary of all qo frequencies along the major axes .    by tuning @xmath5 to @xmath36 in our mbj band structure ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bandstructure ] ) , we can fit our measured qo frequencies with the predicted angular dependence of the extremal orbit size ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : angulardependence]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> this energy is well within the energy window for observing chiral fs pockets ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : bandstructure ] ) and the fs is described by three weyl pocket pairs , one w1 and two w2 pairs . </S>",
    "<S> these coexist with two trivial hole pockets , h1 , aligned along the nodal ring ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : angulardependence]b and c ) . </S>",
    "<S> crucially , a unique solution of the fs topology was only achieved by including all three qo frequency branches . </S>",
    "<S> this way it was possible to eliminate alternative topologies deep in the hole and electron doped regime , which give rise to a similar @xmath37 dependence of the dominant @xmath17 frequency ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> s10 of the som @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tetragonal crystal symmetry and consequential @xmath38 repetition of the fs pockets around the [ 001]-axis gives rise to a frequency splitting when the magnetic field is tilted away from the [ 001]-axis .     </S>",
    "<S> along the high symmetry axes . </S>",
    "<S> the dashed lines are fits to the lifshitz - kosevich temperature reduction term @xmath39 with @xmath40 @xcite . ]    </S>",
    "<S> the banana - shaped electron w1 pockets at the zone boundary , which are aligned parallel to the @xmath27$]-axis , give rise to an inverse @xmath41-like angular dependence of the @xmath42 branch ( dark blue lines in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : angulardependence]a ) when the magnetic field is tilted away from the [ 001]-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the extremal cross section of w1 is equivalent to @xmath17 for @xmath33 $ ] and increases up to 29 and @xmath43 for @xmath44 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding aspect ratio of these pockets is approximately @xmath45 ( mean @xmath30-plane diameter:@xmath27$]-axis length ) . </S>",
    "<S> the charge carrier effective mass of the according electrons has been determined by fits of the lifshitz - kosevich temperature reduction term ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lifshitzkosevichfits ] ) and yields @xmath46 for @xmath33 $ ] where @xmath47 is the free electron mass @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is in excellent agreement with the effective mass of 0.06 predicted by our band structure calculation @xcite .    the w2 pockets on the other hand are rather isotropic spheres . </S>",
    "<S> their angular dependence is split into four branches due to their off - planar position and low symmetry . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding frequency @xmath48 ( light blue lines in fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : angulardependence]a ) is almost independent of the magnetic field direction . </S>",
    "<S> the effective mass for @xmath25 $ ] has been determined from the visible magnetization oscillations between @xmath49 and @xmath50 ( see fig . [ </S>",
    "<S> fig : data]a ) as @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> the h1 hole pockets give rise to the @xmath52 branch ( red lines in figure [ fig : angulardependence]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath52 starts at @xmath53 for @xmath33 $ ] and drops quickly to @xmath54 and @xmath35 along the @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath26$]-axis . </S>",
    "<S> this is indicative of a strongly anisotropic ellipsoidal pocket aligned almost parallel to the @xmath29$]-axes . </S>",
    "<S> its aspect ratio is approximately 1:10 . </S>",
    "<S> experimentally , we observe a continuous decrease of the extremal orbit size when the magnetic field is tilted away from the @xmath27$]-axis . </S>",
    "<S> the calculations on the other hand shows an initial increase , peaking around @xmath55 , towards the a - axis . </S>",
    "<S> this initial increase is due to the non - horizontal alignment of the hole pocket in the brillouin zone . </S>",
    "<S> the observed discrepancy can originate from a stronger bend or fine structure of the hole pocket , which is beyond the accuracy of our calculations and stabilizes a larger orbit for magnetic fields along the c-axis.the fitted effective masses of the h1 pocket are @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath25 $ ] and @xmath44 $ ] respectively ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : lifshitzkosevichfits ] ) . as we saw in the magnetization data , it is the h1 pocket which reaches its quantum limit above @xmath58 for magnetic fields within the @xmath30-plane . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetization steps at @xmath59 along the @xmath29 $ ] and @xmath26$]-axis correspond to the second last ll crossing @xmath5 . beyond this field </S>",
    "<S> only the @xmath60 ll remains occupied . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum limit field scales with the qo frequency and @xmath61\\approx\\sqrt{2}f_\\beta[100]$ ] , as expected for a quasi - two dimensional fs aligned parallel to the @xmath29$]-axis . </S>",
    "<S> thus no quantum limit signature is expected in the magnetic field range up to @xmath17 for @xmath62 . as the electrical transport is dominated by the larger w1 and w2 pockets , which are still described by multiple lls in this field range , </S>",
    "<S> no clear transport anomalies are observed .    </S>",
    "<S> .experimental and calculated effective cyclotron masses @xmath63 and quantum oscillation frequencies @xmath64 for different extremal orbits and magnetic field orientations . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath47 is the free electron mass . </S>",
    "<S> [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ tab : summary ]    as the measured @xmath5 lies @xmath65 above the charge neutral point ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : bandstructure ] ) the system is slightly electron doped . </S>",
    "<S> by comparing the hole and electron fs volumina we obtain a theoretical electron doping of @xmath66 . </S>",
    "<S> this electron doping is also seen as a negative hall resistance ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> s4 of the som @xcite ) . </S>",
    "<S> a single band analysis of the high field hall resistance yields an electron doping of @xmath67 , which is in reasonable agreement with our qo measurements . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to an ideal compensated semimetal the observed doping indicates slight deviations from a defect free stoichiometric crystal . in general , different growth conditions do not seem to affect the qo frequencies of taas and thus its doping level and @xmath5 @xcite .    a dingle analysis of the w1 and h1 dhva oscillations ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> s7 of the som @xcite ) reveals scattering times of @xmath68 and @xmath69 or equivalently dingle temperatures of @xmath70 and @xmath71 respectively @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> taking into account the theoretical fermi velocity of both pockets @xmath72 and @xmath73 we obtain a charge carrier mean - free path of @xmath74 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding dhva electron and hole mobilities @xmath75 are @xmath76 and @xmath77 .    in summary , we observed quantum oscillations from three types of fs pockets in taas . by considering </S>",
    "<S> the angular dependence of all observed qo frequency branches , we were able to obtain a unique solution for the fs topology based on additional dft calculations . </S>",
    "<S> the fs consists of three pairs of topological weyl pockets and two trivial hole pockets aligned along each nodal ring of the tetragonal brillouin zone . in taas , @xmath5 is such that each weyl point is surrounded by a distinct fs pocket . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the other members of the non - centrosymmetric monopnictides @xcite , taas is the first weyl semimetal with confirmed chiral quasiparticles at @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> thus taas is a prime candidate for the observation of chiral effects such as the alder - bell - jackiw anomaly . </S>"
