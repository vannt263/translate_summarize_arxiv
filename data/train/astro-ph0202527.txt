    "the discovery of extrasolar planets in the past few years ( starting with mayor & queloz 1995 ) has led to the realization that they are common around solar - type main sequence stars ( for a review , see marcy & butler 1998 ) .",
    "most of the discovered planets have masses comparable to that of jupiter and saturn , but have orbital characteristics ( such as short period or large eccentricity ) that are very different from those of the giant planets in the solar system .",
    "some of these properties result from the circumstances of their formation , while others are determined by post - formation dynamical evolution .",
    "an important challenge is to isolate the dominant cause behind the orbital properties of the population of planetary systems .",
    "nearly all extrasolar planets have been found with radial velocity surveys of nearby stars , and in order to optimize the detection efficiency , these surveys have been focused on mature solar - type stars with quiet atmospheres .",
    "a particularly interesting characteristic of the planet - bearing stars is that they tend to be metal rich with respect to the sun and the f - g field star average in the solar neighborhood ( e.g. gonzales et al .",
    "2001 ; santos , israelian & mayor 2001 ) .",
    "two explanations have been advanced to explain the association of metal - rich stars with planets .",
    "first , metal - rich planetesimals or planets could have been consumed in the outer convective layers of the host star during the process of planet formation ( e.g. gonzalez 1997 ; ford , rasio , & sills 1999 ) .",
    "our main focus for this paper is planetary consumption following migration through the protoplanetary disk ( lin 1997 ; laughlin & adams 1997 ; sandquist et al .",
    "1998 ) or gravitational interaction with other planets ( rasio & ford 1996 ) .",
    "even though the contaminants are expected to be thoroughly mixed within the convective envelope , this surface layer is sufficiently shallow for f - g stars that the consumption of one or a few jupiter - like planets would be adequate to account for observed metallicity enhancements above the field star average .",
    "second , enhanced metallicity in the planet - forming disk ( probably resulting from a metal - rich parent cloud ) might be especially conducive to planet formation .",
    "in fact , pollack et al . ( 1996 ) show that the timescale for giant planet formation in the disk ( by the conventional accretion of gas onto a solid core ) decreases rapidly with the surface density of solid material , which presumably derives from metal content of the gas .",
    "thus , the first scenario attributes the excess metal content of planet - bearing stars to the dynamical evolution of the planet , whereas the second scenario assumes it to be associated with planet formation .",
    "detailed analysis of the chemical composition of stars with planets may hold the key to determining the relative importance of these two possibilities ( santos , israelian , & mayor 2000 , gonzalez et al .",
    "for example , light element abundances can constrain the time of pollution . this conjecture",
    "has recently been spotlighted by the apparent discovery of in the spectrum of the star with planet ( swp ) hd 82943 ( israelian et al .",
    "together with be and b , is produced primarily through cosmic ray nucleosynthesis .",
    "nuclear burning destroys at @xmath4 k and at even lower temperature . because hd 82943 is a mature main sequence star , the temperature at the base of its surface convection zone is low enough to preserve any remaining and",
    "however , during the pre - main sequence phase of its evolution , the temperature at the base of the more extended convection zone is large enough to completely destroy surface , and deplete . in  2 , we briefly discuss our own stellar models of swps , and examine the possibility of detecting any signature of a pollution mechanism that may operate while a star is on the main sequence by using observations of and .",
    "we also discuss the parameters of the swp hd 82943 .    as described above , one possible avenue for the late accretion of li isotopes",
    "is the consumption of a giant planet . in ",
    "3 we present new numerical simulations to examine the possibility of dissolving a giant planet in the convective envelope of a swp . this calculation is an extension of our previous calculations to the limiting case of f stars that have relatively low - mass convection zones .",
    "our primary interest is to determine whether a jupiter - mass planet can avoid total disintegration after entering into the atmosphere of a host star of that type . in  4 , we consider the dynamical origin of such a planet .",
    "we find one possible scenario for bringing the giant planet into contact with its host star that involves disk migration of the giant planet to an orbital period slightly less than the minimum observed for known extrasolar planets .",
    "subsequent internal tidal dissipation causes this hypothetical planet to dissipate its orbital energy . if the planet reaches the proximity of the host star with a modest eccentricity , tidal dissipation may cause it to overflow its roche lobe and become tidally disrupted .",
    "if the planet s initial orbit is essentially circular , it would undergo moderate tidal interaction with its host star .",
    "we show that it is possible for a planet with an initial period comparable to that of known short - period planets to spiral into the envelope of a swp within 1 gyr .",
    "we also use hd 82943 as an example to demonstrate the existence of initial dynamically decoupled configurations in which the observed kinematic properties of known planets may be preserved despite the presence and demise of doomed short - period planets .",
    "finally in  5 , we summarize our results and discuss their implications .",
    "to produce stellar structure models for input into our hydrodynamics code ( see  3 ) , we have used the one - dimensional stellar evolution code developed by eggleton ( 1971 , 1972 ) , with input physics updated by pols et al .",
    "our implementation of the code includes recent opacities for the surface ( alexander & ferguson 1994 ) and interior ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) , and reaction rates ( bahcall & pinsonneault 1995 ) .",
    "chemical diffusion has also been incorporated using rates calculated using the method of thoul , bahcall , & loeb ( 1994 ) .",
    "our intent is to ensure that we are modeling the stellar structure and convection zone depth as accurately as possible with current physics .",
    "we have tested the accuracy of our numerical methods by obtaining the sound speed and density residuals of our standard solar model using the radial profiles derived from helioseismic data by basu , pinsonneault , & bahcall ( 2000 ) . as found by basu et al .",
    ", models that do not include diffusion are much poorer matches to the sun s density and sound speed profiles , particularly near the base of the convection zone .",
    "typical residuals for our models that included diffusion were about 0.4% in sound speed and 3% for density .",
    "we have also compared the radius of the convection zone boundary and surface helium abundance of our standard model with the values of the diffusion - inclusive solar model of brun , turck - chize , & morel ( 1998 ) , and again found satisfactory agreement .",
    "our stellar evolution code has also been modified to follow abundances of light elements , , and . before examining other details of the pollution process",
    ", we will discuss these chemical tracers and their observability in swps .",
    "as many others have noted previously , the absolute value of can be used to distinguish substellar objects from stars ( see chabrier & baraffe 2000 and basri 2000 for recent reviews ) , and because li is preserved in these objects , stars could well be enriched by pollution mechanisms ( alexander 1967 ) .",
    "however , evidence from open clusters indicates that it is apparently depleted by single - star mechanisms on timescales of @xmath5 myr for main sequence stars with effective temperatures at or slightly above that of the sun ( see figs . 3 and 4 of pinsonneault 1997 ) .",
    "thus , the use of to look for signs of pollution requires a fairly accurate estimation of the age of a swp .",
    "scatter in measured values in open clusters makes definitive detection of a pollution signal even more difficult .    because burns at a lower temperature than , models show that primordial is destroyed while the star is still on the pre - main sequence ( before an age of about @xmath6 yr ; forestini 1994 ) .",
    "however , for stars with masses comparable to that of the sun , the subsequent retreat of the convection zone base means that surface material is no longer exposed to temperatures high enough to deplete .",
    "this evolutionary process places in a unique position : species like which burn at lower temperatures would be depleted rapidly even on the main sequence , while and are not depleted by large amounts on the pre - main sequence , so that initial abundance variations and not - yet - understood mixing processes complicate the interpretation of abundances .",
    "is the equivalent of an on - off switch for a range of star masses near @xmath7 .",
    "( because convection - zone mass increases steeply with decreasing stellar mass , the dilution of pollutants is an important consideration for stars less massive than the sun , and so detection depends on the sensitivity of observational techniques . for stars of solar metallicity below @xmath7 ,",
    "the mass in the convection zone can be approximated as @xmath8 . for stars more massive than the sun ,",
    "detectability of pollution depends on details of the pollution process : for example , what fraction of the pollutants penetrate below the convection zone of the star .",
    "we will discuss this issue in the last paragraph of this subsection . )",
    "if detected in significant amounts in a swp , would provide definitive evidence of a pollution process in effect after an age of about @xmath9 yr .",
    "because is not depleted after @xmath9 yr , the amount of detected can be used to constrain the amount of polluting material ( israelian et al .",
    "however , it should be noted that the amount of _ heavy element pollution _ can probably be much more accurately constrained than total pollution .",
    "the abundance of and in solar system meteorites is measured relative to other heavy elements that have well - determined abundances relative to hydrogen in the sun .",
    "after correcting these comparison heavy elements to a solar composition , the abundance is determined to be @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ; anders & grevesse 1989 ) , while that of is found to be an order of magnitude smaller . the more directly observed abundance in the interstellar medium yields a similar value ( lemoine et al .",
    "1993 ; knauth et al .",
    "2000 ) . using the assumption that the li / h ratio in the interior of giant planets is the same as the corrected meteoritic value , israelian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) infer that for swp hd 82943 a giant planet of mass @xmath12 could have provided the necessary to pollute the shallow convective envelope of the star .",
    "however , this inference is probably an overestimate of the amount of giant planet material needed to account for the measurement . as indicated above",
    ", the nature of meteoritic abundance measurements makes the relative abundance of li and fe more accurate than the relative abundance of li and h. independent of that , many planetesimals or one giant planet could pollute a star by the same amount  the measured places no direct constraint on the hydrogen ( and helium ) content of the polluter . as a result , it is more accurate to use a measured abundance to calculate the amount of heavy elements consumed .",
    "the mechanism by which giant planets form can have an important bearing on pollution though .",
    "if planets are formed by gravitational instabilities in the protoplanetary disk ( hereafter gi ; see boss 2001 for a recent reference ) , then there should be a roughly linear relationship between pollution amount and consumed giant planet mass ( and the solar li / h ratio is appropriate to use in computing total pollutant mass ) . if giant planets are instead nucleated around a rock / ice core which accretes gas after it reaches a critical mass of @xmath13 or more ( hereafter ca ; podolak , hubbard , & pollack 1993 ) , the pollution mass would also be a linearly increasing function of the planet mass , but with non - zero pollution for low giant planet masses .",
    "the necessity of a solid core in this case implies that the average metal content for a giant planet will be higher than that of the gas used to form the star . even in the absence of a core structure today",
    ", high metal content is still needed to account the relatively compact sizes of solar system giant planets .",
    "models of jupiter indicate that @xmath14 ( guillot et al .",
    "1997 ) .    for a giant - planet core of @xmath15",
    ", one would expect approximately @xmath16 atoms , assuming a constant /ratio ( @xmath17 ) , @xmath18 , and / = 0.08 ( all from meteoritic measurements ; anders & grevesse 1989 ) .",
    "the importance of this mass estimate is that a giant planet of nearly _ any _ mass could provide the necessary lithium . planets of larger mass would contain significantly more lithium because accreted gas still has cosmic abundances .",
    "however , because of the overwhelming abundance of hydrogen and helium in accreted gas , that gas would generally be more than an order of magnitude less rich in heavy elements . as a result",
    ", can provide a means of looking for consumed planets that is nearly independent of planet mass .",
    "if indeed the planet mass function rises steeply toward low masses like @xmath19 ( marcy & butler 2000 ; jorissen , mayor , & udry 2001 ) , then the traces of destroyed low - mass giant planets are the ones most likely to be found .",
    "low - mass planets are also more likely to be scattered by gravitational interactions with other planets within a given system .",
    "if the mass of the host star s convection zone can be estimated via stellar models , this inference could provide a telling signature of giant planet consumption .",
    "it is reasonable to ask whether post - formation accretion of planetesimals or planets could return the abundance to near primordial levels without noticeably over - enriching the star in .",
    "the best measurements of the / ratio come from solar system meteorites ( @xmath20 ; anders & grevesse 1989 ) and from clouds in the interstellar medium .",
    "interstellar clouds appear to show significant variations in / , ranging from near solar values toward @xmath21 oph , @xmath22 oph , and @xmath22 per ( @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , respectively ) , to low values seen in another cloud toward @xmath22 oph ( @xmath26 ) and two toward o per ( @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) [ see lemoine , ferlet , & vidal - madjar ( 1995 ) and knauth et al .",
    "( 2000 ) ] .",
    "if the low ratio values seen toward the interstellar clouds are preserved in planetesimals , effective enrichment in is possible without substantially increasing the abundance .",
    "the discussion so far has assumed that the entire planet is destroyed either immediately outside the host star ( and then accreted ) or in its convection zone  if this is not the case , the uncertainty increases again because the initial abundance and present distribution of li and other metals within gaseous giant planets are poorly constrained by observations .",
    "the abundance of both and in the upper atmosphere of jupiter is too small to be detected because it is depleted via the formation of the molecule li@xmath29s , which condenses under pressure at @xmath30k ( fegley & lodders 1994 , lodders 1999 ) .",
    "the distribution of li within a giant planet can play a role in some pollution scenarios because the planet s envelope can shield the core from dissolution until late in its plunge into a star .",
    "if li is uniformly distributed in the planet , a substantial amount will be deposited into the star s convection zone . however ,",
    "if li is held primarily in the core , it could be almost entirely deposited in the radiative interior where it would not be observable . at this time",
    ", it can not be ruled out that a large fraction of a giant planet s li is contained in the core or deep atmosphere of the planet ( fegley , private communication ) . according to the ca theory , these portions of the planet form ( along with meteorites ) through the coagulation of solid condensates that hold most of the lithium in the protostellar disk .",
    "a major question is whether core material is re - melted and redistributed throughout the planet s envelope by convection . as a result of these uncertainties ,",
    "it is important to examine _ how _ a giant planet is destroyed during its collision with the host star .",
    "we attend to this issue in  3 .",
    "because of the importance of the claimed detection of in hd 82943 , we devote the discussion below to an examination of the characteristics of the star . because the detection depends on a delicate fit of synthetic spectra to the shape of a much stronger line and because the israelian et al .",
    "( 2001 ) measurements have not yet been confirmed by an independent analysis , we must leave open the possibility that the measurement might be disputed . nevertheless , it is useful to consider the theoretical implications of any swp with a relatively high abundance , including hd 82943 .",
    "the observations we used to constrain our models of hd 82943 are summarized in table  [ obs ] .",
    "we list surface gravity as a potential constraint , although we elected not to use it .",
    "first , an error bar of @xmath31 results in a large uncertainty ( @xmath32% ) in @xmath33 ( ford , rasio , & sills 1999 ) .",
    "second , there is some indication that there are significant systematic differences in values measured by different groups ( gonzalez et al .",
    "2001 ) .",
    "the relatively high effective temperature and metallicity of hd 82943 required us to consider masses near @xmath34 , which is at the high end of the range quoted by israelian et al .",

    "( detailed estimation of the errors in the mass and initial metal abundance are beyond the scope of this paper .",
    ") figure  [ hrtrack ] shows the evolutionary tracks for our models for comparison with the error box for hd 82943 .",
    "the `` unpolluted model '' is a standard model including diffusion with a uniform initial [ fe / h ] throughout the interior .",
    "the surface convection zone for this model contains a mass approximately half the mass of the sun s convection zone .",
    "the observed metallicity for hd 82943 is at the high end of the the field star distribution for g and early k field dwarf stars ( favata et al .",
    "for this reason , we considered the possibility that the outer layer of hd 82943 was contaminated by heavy elements from the accretion of planetesimals or terrestrial planets after its formation .",
    "pollution would raise [ fe / h ] in the convection zone , but would leave the deep interior with a metallicity lower than the convective surface layers ( although diffusion will transport some of the convection zone s metals into the interior ) . assuming pollution by @xmath39 of heavy elements starting around the time the star reached the end of the hayashi track and continuing at a constant rate for @xmath40 yr",
    ", we obtained a good candidate model with @xmath41 ( labelled `` polluted model '' in table  [ smods ] ) .",
    "this post - formation addition would result in increased lithium abundances that can be ruled out by the observations .",
    "earlier pollution would probably have been diluted to a degree that it would not have been observable .",
    "in addition , @xmath42 of heavy element pollution can probably be ruled out based on an examination of higher - mass swps ( pinsonneault , depoy , & coffee 2001 ; murray & chaboyer 2002 ) and limits on metallicity variation among solar - type stars in the pleiades cluster that have a dispersion in lithium abundance ( wilden et al .",
    "nevertheless , we conducted the calculation as a test of the extremes possible in the envelope of hd 82943 . with [ fe / h]@xmath43 ,",
    "the consumption of a giant planet could boost the metallicity of the convection zone ( cz ) to near the observed value of @xmath44 .",
    "we note that our models indicate that an age of 6 gyr for hd 82943 ( as quoted by israelian et al . )",
    "is very unlikely .",
    "our unpolluted model falls within the hd 82943 error box between an age of 0.5 and 1.3 gyr , while the polluted run falls in the box between ages of 1.4 and 2.2 gyr .",
    "the isochrones of schaerer et al .",
    "( 1993 ) also put the age of hd 82943 between about 1 and 2 gyr .",
    "in addition , both of our models require hd 82943 to have started with a super - solar metallicity .",
    "so , independent of our assumptions about pollution after the pre - main sequence , this seems to indicate that hd 82943 had to have a high initial metal abundance , supporting the scenario that high metallicity in star - forming gas may enhance the probability of planet formation ( see  1 ) .",
    "israelian et al . (",
    "2001 ) compared hd 82943 with the open cluster m67 ( age @xmath45 gyr ) , and found that hd 82943 s abundance was at the high end of the distribution of stars from that cluster , consistent with pollution .",
    "however , the error in their quoted age makes such an analysis misleading . since is continuously being depleted on the main sequence",
    ", a more realistic comparison would be with stars from the younger cluster ngc 752 ( hobbs & pilachowski 1986 ) which has an age ( @xmath46 gyr ) similar to that of hd 82943 .",
    "the abundance of hd 82943 is consistent with the mean trend in li abundances for ngc 752 .",
    "although this similarity weakens the case for enrichment ( see also ryan 2000 ) , it does not rule out the possibility that hd 82943 has been enriched in .    in   [ li6 ]",
    ", we have already argued that more constraints may be placed on pollution by measurements . using the estimate of @xmath47 nuclei in the convection zone of hd 82943 ( israelian et al .",
    "2001 ) , we find that the corresponding mass of heavy element pollutants should be near @xmath48 , consistent with theoretical values for the critical core mass of giant planets ( podolak et al .",
    "for the assumptions , only about @xmath49 of iron would have been consumed , which would not have noticeably changed the star s heavy - element abundance ( @xmath50 dex ) .",
    "we next consider the process of contaminating the stellar convective envelope via planet consumption . in the next section ,",
    "we suggest that ultra - short - period planets may migrate toward their host stars as a consequence of the tidal interaction between them",
    ". such a planet may either disintegrate before it reaches the surface of the host star or it may spiral into the star s atmosphere and envelope .",
    "for the first case , the planet s tidal debris may form an accretion disk or a swarm of much smaller bodies . through mutual collisions and the secular perturbations of other planets , the debris fragments would fall onto the surface and become dissolved into the convective zone of the host .",
    "for the second possibility , below we discuss the details of the hydrodynamical interaction between a short - period giant planet and the envelope of the host star . here",
    "we model the degree to which the planet can be ablated and dissolved before it passes through the base of the convection zone of the star . for planetary disruption in the deeper radiative zone ,",
    "the deposited pollutants become essentially unobservable .      the hydrodynamics code used to do the calculations is largely identical to that used in sandquist et al .",
    "briefly , the computational domain was three - dimensional and composed of a main grid and a nested subgrid , both of @xmath51 zones .",
    "the size of the subgrid was chosen to be comparable to the size of the gas giant planet , and the main grid was then taken to be approximately 4 times larger in each dimension .",
    "each simulation follows the center - of - mass frame of the planet , which was initially taken to be on a circular orbit at the star s surface .",
    "the gas that flows onto the grid was given densities taken from the stellar evolution models described earlier .",
    "aerodynamical drag causes the planet to move relative to the grid , and the adjustments the code makes to keep the planet at the center of the subgrid are used to update the radial distance from the center of the star , and the radial and tangential velocities .    in our previous simulations ( sandquist et al .",
    "1998 ) , we examined the interactions between cold jupiter- and saturn - mass giant planets and stars of 1 and 1.22 @xmath52 .",
    "the simulations presented here were carried out to assess the feasibility of polluting hd 82943 with a giant planet . however , these simulations have broader interest because stars near this mass have easily polluted low - mass convection zones with a large enough spatial extent that destruction of the planet in the convection zone is still likely . in addition , we have examined the effects that larger planet mass and `` inflated '' planet structure have on the survivability of the planet .",
    "the discovery of an unexpectedly large - size planet transiting hd 209458 ( henry et al . 2000 , charbonneau et al .",
    "2000 ) has made the last issue especially relevant .    in our simulations",
    ", we chose several planet models , which included : a cold compact jupiter - mass planet with a size @xmath53 , a hot inflated jupiter - mass planet with a size @xmath54 similar to the planet orbiting hd 209458 ( @xmath55 , brown et al .",
    "2001 ; @xmath56 , hubbard et al .",
    "2001 ) , a cold compact ( @xmath57 ) @xmath58 planet , and a hot inflated @xmath58 planet ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "there are several physical effects that may lead to the inflation of a short - period planet .",
    "for example , models of giant planets that develop near their host stars which include the effects of stellar insulation predict that the planets gravitationally contract less rapidly than they would if they had evolved much farther away ( burrows et al . 2000 ) . during the course of spin synchronization , orbital circularization , and decay ,",
    "tidal heating of short - period planets is also expected to maintain a larger planet radius , or inflate a planet that started out as cold and compact ( bodenheimer , lin , & mardling 2001 ) .",
    "a larger radius for a planet results in a larger cross section , increased aerodynamical drag , and quicker orbital evolution , but also lower envelope binding energy and ease of ablation by the stellar gas .    in our hydrodynamic simulations , we have started the planet at the surface of the host star in order to model the last stages of the star - planet interaction .",
    "( the dynamical origin of this configuration will be discussed in the next section . )",
    "all four planets were modeled as @xmath59 polytropes ( hubbard 1984 ) .",
    "the core structure of giant planets is still poorly understood ( particularly whether rock / ice cores are present , and whether the existence of a core is affected by heating mechanisms ) , although this issue has a relatively minor effect on the overall structure of the planet ( see fig .",
    "2 of bodenheimer et al .",
    "the structure of the @xmath58 planet is worth more discussion , given that models are not constrained by observations as yet .",
    "the overall planetary radius is the most uncertain quantity , primarily because of uncertainties in albedo ( e.g. , marley et al . 1999 ) .",
    "the indications from more detailed models are that the structures ( most importantly , the dependence of density on radius ) of planets with different total radii are likely to obey a rough homology relationship . for the cold @xmath58 planet , we estimated the radius using the models of saumon et al .",
    "based on the insensitivity of giant planet radii to mass near @xmath60 ( see figs . 4 and 6 of saumon et al . ) and the desire to make useful comparisons with our jupiter - mass runs , we chose to give our `` hot '' @xmath58 model the same radius as our `` hot jupiter '' model ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "this degree of inflation for a @xmath58 planet would require a larger heating rate than a jupiter - mass planet would , but the _ possibility _ of inflation to that size is likely to be insensitive to where in the planet heat is input ( bodenheimer et al . 2001 ) , and thus insensitive to the exact cause of the inflation .",
    "the primary results are shown in figure  [ hydro ] .",
    "our simulations of cold planets show , as expected , that they penetrate deeply into the star before finally being destroyed . in our star models ,",
    "the radius of the convection zone base is @xmath62 so that a jupiter - mass planet was able to penetrate to the base of the star s convection zone with approximately 50% of its original mass .",
    "so , if much of the heavy element content ( including li ) of the planet is in its core , it would not be observable at the star s surface after the planet s destruction .",
    "the cold @xmath58 planet also penetrates deeply into the star , although the majority of the planet s mass is stripped away before we were forced to end the run ( when the code had difficulty following the motion of the planet ) .",
    "again , it is likely that some portion of the planet s core would make it through the base of the star s convection zone .",
    "by contrast , the hot giant planets were much more easily ablated near the surface of the star . in all four simulations ( 1 and 3 @xmath0 planets interacting with our 1.14 and @xmath63 model stars )",
    ", the planet is entirely destroyed before penetrating through even half of the extent of the star s convection zone .",
    "the initial orbital decay timescales appear to be similar for all runs , indicating that the timescale depends primarily on the structure of the host star , which is similar for both of our stellar structure models . a comparison with the cold planet simulations of sandquist et al .",
    "( 1998 ) shows that the lower density of the stellar envelopes in the current simulations results in longer timescales for orbital decay .",
    "our results also show clearly that the orbits of the cold planets take longer to decay on average than the hot ones because the hydrodynamic drag is reduced for the more compact planets .",
    "the majority of the orbital evolution occurs after the planet has already lost a significant portion ( @xmath64 % ) of its envelope mass .",
    "presumably , orbital evolution in the late stages of the interaction is related to the amount of mass that is ablated and the amount of momentum transferred .",
    "the larger binding energy of the cold planets results in delayed mass loss and slower orbital evolution while the planet is still near the surface .",
    "the orbital motions of the planets are also characterized by different degrees of `` skipping '' across the star s surface  an oblique shock is quickly set up on the lower forward facing side of the planet .",
    "the stellar gas flowing past the planet is thus able to transfer a fraction of its momentum to the planet in the radially outward direction , delaying orbital decay .",
    "we conducted one additional simulation involving a cold jupiter - mass planet and a @xmath65 star , but with the planet starting with only one - quarter of its diameter initially immersed in the star surface .",
    "the lower initial drag forces resulted in a longer timescale for orbital decay and a substantially longer computation .",
    "the run hints that a cold planet hitting a star at a shallow angle could be destroyed before reaching the base of the star s convection zone .",
    "more realistic simulations would certainly answer this question , but most factors ( mass loss from the planet prior to the hydrodynamic interaction , tidal distortion , etc . )",
    "seem to favor planet destruction .",
    "although simulation of the destruction of a planet on an elliptical orbit is currently impractical due to long interaction timescales , our results support the idea that heated planets of small - to - moderate mass ( and probably also cold planets ) could be destroyed relatively easily just below the star s surface .",
    "thus , the consumption of a heated planet is clearly a plausible mechanism for polluting stars .",
    "the basic assumption of the planet - consumption scenario is that some metal - rich host swps may once have had close planetary companions which migrated into their envelopes . in order to enhance the metallicity by a detectable amount ,",
    "planet consumption must occur after these stars have reached the end of their hayashi track pre - main - sequence evolution .",
    "in addition , the dynamical stability of the planetary system has to be considered .",
    "if we currently observe some planets on stable orbits around a star that is suspected to have been polluted , we have to monitor the effects of the time - varying gravitational potential of the doomed planet before its destruction , as well as the effects of the removal of its gravitational influence afterward ( for example , orbital resonances ) . in this section ,",
    "we examine some processes which may be able to bring planets to the surface of metal - rich swps .",
    "while our objective is to provide a general assessment for the planet - consumption scenario , our analysis is applied to the hd 82943 system because the dynamical constraint for this system is particularly stringent .",
    "the coexistence of two planets in a 2:1 resonance with periods of 221 and 446 d and eccentricities of @xmath66 and 0.41 have been reported ( see http://obswww.unige.ch/@xmath67udry/planet/hd82943syst.html ) .",
    "the requirement that this delicate configuration be preserved can be used to constrain the initial conditions for the system .",
    "the analytical methods developed for this case can then be applied to other systems .",
    "we first considered the possibility that the doomed planet was gravitationally scattered off another giant planet onto an orbit that brought it near the stellar surface as a consequence .",
    "multiple planets are found around more than half of all the swps ( fischer et al .",
    "2001 ) , and they form in a variety of configurations . during the epoch of their formation , the presence of residual gas in their nascent disks may provide sufficient dissipation to preserve a stable configuration .",
    "but after the gas is largely removed , long - term dynamical instabilities may lead to the excitation of large eccentricities and induce planets to cross orbits in some systems ( rasio & ford , 1996 , wiedenschilling & marzari 1996 , lin & ida 1997 , levison et al .",
    "subsequently , strong interactions and close encounters between planets may scatter some of them close to the surface or directly into the envelope of their host stars .",
    "although this is a promising mechanism to account for the enhanced metallicity of some swps , this scenario can not be applied to hd 82943 because the stability of the observed current 2:1 resonant system is finely tuned in the sense that small changes in the orbital elements would render this system unstable .",
    "therefore , we consider less disruptive avenues of planetary migration .      during formation , tidal interactions between protoplanets and their viscously - evolving nascent disk induce orbital migration of the planets ( goldreich & tremaine 1980 , lin & papaloizou 1986 ) .",
    "planets formed in the inner regions of the disk migrate toward their host stars .",
    "the migration of a given planet is halted if it enters a magnetospheric cavity in the disk or if it undergoes tidal interaction with a young , rapidly - rotating host star ( lin et al . 1996 ) .",
    "these different mechanisms can both excite and damp the incoming planet s eccentricity . at such close range",
    ", the dissipation of tidal energy within the planet s envelope leads to strong damping of the planet s orbital eccentricity ( @xmath68 ) and evolution of its spin frequency ( @xmath69 ) toward synchronization with the orbital mean motion @xmath70 .",
    "this process also heats the planet s interior and causes it to inflate ( bodenheimer et al .",
    "2000 ) , and under some circumstances , to overflow its roche lobe ( gu et al .",
    "but due to its small moment of inertia , very little angular momentum is exchanged between the planet s spin and its orbit . in contrast , tidal dissipation within the envelope of a slowly / fast spinning host star does lead to significant angular momentum transfer from / to the planet s orbit to / from the stellar spin , and thus causes a reduction / increase in the planets semi - major axis @xmath71 . in this subsection",
    ", we assess the likelihood that these processes leading to the disruption of the planet and contamination of the host star s outer envelope .",
    "first we examine the dominant effects of the tidal dissipation in the planet s envelope , which induces @xmath69 to evolve towards @xmath72 , and @xmath68 to damp on timescales @xmath73 and @xmath74 respectively , where @xmath75 is the planet s radius , @xmath76 its moment of inertia coefficient , and @xmath77 its effective dissipation parameter ( goldreich & soter 1966 ) . since tidal dissipation within the planet",
    "does not significantly modify its orbital angular momentum @xmath78 , the damping of @xmath68 leads to an evolution in @xmath71 at a rate @xmath79 . in the absence of ongoing eccentricity excitation ,",
    "the maximum change in the semi - major axis is @xmath80 . unless the planet is on a nearly parabolic orbit",
    ", @xmath81 is not adequate to bring it to the stellar surface from large distances .",
    "eccentricity damping also leads to the tidal dissipation of the planet s orbital energy @xmath82 which is deposited as heat into the interior at a rate @xmath83 in response , the gravitational binding energy of the planet is reduced and the radius @xmath75 expands at a rate @xmath84 provided @xmath85 @xmath86 and the planet s envelope expands before @xmath68 is damped out .",
    "a radiative equilibrium is established for the planet at a critical size @xmath87 such that the planets surface luminosity @xmath88 is balanced by @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath87 is larger than the roche radius @xmath90 , the inflated planet begins to lose mass once @xmath91 ( further discussion of this process will be presented by gu et al .",
    "at least a fraction of the lost mass flows through the l1 point and is accreted onto the host star .    in the context of migration due to planet - disk interaction , the necessary condition for planetary inflation in eq([eq : crita ] )",
    "is marginally attained as the migrating planet approaches its host star .",
    "provided the migration is halted at a modest value of @xmath71 , the planetary inflation timescale @xmath92 can be longer than the timescale for the solar - type host stars to evolve onto the main sequence ( @xmath93 yr ) . since @xmath94 , the planet s tidal debris can not significantly modify the host star s metallicity until the mass contained in the star s convection zone",
    "is reduced to a small fraction of @xmath95 , which occurs on the timescale of @xmath96 ( ford et al .",
    "in addition , the preservation of is only possible after the star has reached the end of the hayashi track when the stellar convection zone has decreased to approximately the present size of the solar convection zone ( see discussion in  2 ) .    for short - period planets that are scattered into the vicinity of the host star as a consequence of dynamical instability in multiple - planet systems , the condition for planetary inflation",
    "is not generally satisfied immediately after the first close approach to the stellar surface .",
    "however , as @xmath71 and @xmath68 decline during the subsequent circularization of the orbit , the condition in eq([eq : crita ] ) may be satisfied .",
    "since this process is more likely to occur well after the host star has evolved onto the main sequence , the stellar convection zone can be noticeably polluted by tidally - disrupted stray planets .",
    "although this mechanism is a viable process for swp contamination , it is not likely to apply to the case of hd 82945 because the delicate two - planet orbital resonance would not have survived , as we have indicated above .",
    "the orbital eccentricity of mature planets can also be excited long after the nascent disk is depleted . according to the pollution hypothesis ,",
    "metal - rich swps must have possessed two or more planets originally .",
    "even today , multiple planet systems are indicated for more than half of the swps ( fischer et al . 2001 ) . in some multiple systems ( such as @xmath97 and ; butler et al .",
    "1999 ) , short - period planets coexist with intermediate- and long - period planets . in such a configuration , a short - period planet interacts both tidally with its host star and dynamically with other planets .",
    "while tidal dissipation within the planet removes energy from its orbit ( goldreich & soter 1966 ) , secular interactions among planets transfer angular momentum and excite eccentricity ( cf .",

    "thus , the relative speed of the orbiting planet and the spinning convective envelope is expected to be large , leading to the initial state of our dynamical models and hydrodynamical simulations .",
    "if the contamination scenario is to be able to explain the high metal abundances in a large fraction of swps , it will be necessary to require some of the planetary systems to have stable ( at the very least , dynamically ) configurations prior to and after the planet consumption event .",
    "for those swps that contain one or more intermediate- or long - period planets today , the surviving planets can have been dynamically decoupled from the hypothesized short - period planet such that its existence and disruption had little dynamical consequence . for systems containing short - period planets today ,",
    "even though the surviving planets may have intensely interacted with their demised siblings , the signatures of the encounters can be erased by their own subsequent tidal interactions with the host star .",
    "however , systems containing resonant planets , such as hd 82943 , may be more sensitive to perturbations by the hypothesized short - period planet .",
    "therefore it is important to assess the requirements for coexistence . in this subsection , we carry out numerical simulations to establish the existence of stable and perhaps dynamically decoupled systems , which contain both short - period and resonant planets , and then follow their dynamical evolution , taking into account the effects of tidal and secular interactions as well as stellar spindown .    in order to quantitatively determine the relative importance of these processes , we used the ( direct ) numerical model described in mardling & lin ( 2002a ) for all our dynamical studies .",
    "this code can be used to study the dynamical evolution of up to three planets , including the secular effects of the relativistic potential of the star and the tidal evolution and spin - orbit coupling of the star and innermost planet .",
    "orbit averaging was not used because , among other things , we were interested in stability issues .",
    "a comprehensive stability analysis requires an extensive simulation for a large number of orbital parameters such as the planets masses , semi - major axis , and eccentricity distribution .",
    "such a study is beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "here we use the specific example of hd 82943 to demonstrate that resonant planets can easily retain their observed dynamical properties despite the initial existence and subsequent disruption of hypothetical short - period planets .",
    "an understanding of the stability of the observed resonant system including the resonant capture process deserves its own dedicated study ( for a study of the other known , and much shorter period , 2:1 resonant system gj 876 , see lee & peale 2001 ) . the high eccentricities and similar masses of the two planets orbiting hd 82943 present a challenge to existing theories of stability and resonant capture ( murray & dermott 2000 ) . from an empirical point of view , it is possible to constrain the configuration parameters using observational data as has been done for gj 876 ( laughlin & chambers 2001 ) . in lieu of such a study , we chose our working orbital parameters as follows .",
    "we started by considering the stability of the observed two - planet system .",
    "using the orbital parameters available at the time of writing ( @xmath149 , @xmath150 , @xmath151 au , @xmath152 au , @xmath153 not determined , @xmath154 , where subscripts 1 and 2 refer to the inner and outer planets respectively and @xmath155 is the longitude of periastron ) , together with the minimum masses ( @xmath156 , @xmath157 ) , and zero internal inclination ( in the absence of a measured estimate ) , there exist stable configurations only for _ some _ values of the initial relative phases , at least for the short times we integrated the orbits ( @xmath158 yr ) .",
    "however , these `` stable '' systems exhibit large variations in the eccentricities of both planets , as well as large variations in the relative longitude of periastron ( for whatever value we choose for the initial value of @xmath153 ) .",
    "our study of gj 876 ( lin & mardling , in preparation ) together with the theory of resonant capture ( murray & dermott 2000 ) lead us to believe there should be very little variation in these parameters , and hence we expect future observations of the hd 82943 system to reveal slightly different values for the eccentricities .    for the present study , we chose to vary the outer eccentricity in order to produce a system with the above properties . to do this",
    "we used a formula derived by mardling & lin ( 2002a ; equation  9 ) which gives the critical ratio of eccentricities for which there is no secular variation in the eccentricities and relative longitude of periastron for systems of two planets .",
    "this formulation does not take into account any variations due to resonant effects , but nonetheless yields a system with essentially the desirable properties .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] illustrates this for a three - planet system with @xmath159 .",
    "the addition of a short - period planet at 0.02 au ( @xmath160 ) does not disturb the stability , nor does it affect the extent of variations of the orbital parameters of the two outer planets . in this configuration ,",
    "provided @xmath161 , the secular evolution of the outer two planets proceeds as if the innermost planet did not exist ; similarly the orbit of the innermost planet decays on the same timescale it would were it isolated .",
    "the orbit of the innermost planet is also unaffected by the secular perturbation of the outer two resonant planets because the relativistic correction dominates the precession of its periastron longitude .",
    "although we can not investigate the long - term evolution of this system with our numerical code , we are confident that stability of the system persists because the innermost planet becomes more and more decoupled from the outer two as time goes on .",
    "it is likely that nature has arranged for the observed system to suffer even less secular variation than illustrated here ; however our hypothetical system serves the purpose of the present discussion .    in order to be consistent with our hydrodynamical simulations",
    ", we considered a range of masses for the hypothetical short - period planet , with the eccentricity taken to be 0.01 in each case and the spin period of the star taken to be 500 h ( the solar value ) .",
    "for the present calculation we adopt @xmath162 so that given a planet with @xmath163 , the initial semi - major axis needed to achieve the prescribed decay timescale ( @xmath164 1 gyr ) is @xmath165 au ( model 1 ; see figure  [ fig3 ] ) , while a planet of @xmath166 can start a little further out at @xmath167 au ( model 2 ) .",
    "these simulations show that 1 ) the orbit of the innermost planet does indeed decay on the timescale @xmath168 gyr , 2 ) the resonant configuration of the outer two planets is preserved despite the demise of the hypothetical planet , and 3 ) the host star can lose sufficient angular momentum to account for its observed slow spin .",
    "the hydrodynamical simulations presented here indicate that if a heated giant planet can be brought into contact with the stellar surface , it is likely that the planet would be easily destroyed , and its ablated material would be thoroughly mixed in the star s convection zone , thereby modifying the surface abundances in an observable way .",
    "such a planet may have formed several au from its host star and migrated inward as a consequence of tidal interaction with the protoplanetary disk shortly after formation .",
    "this early phase of migration may be halted if the planet enters a magnetospheric cavity near the inner boundary of the disk or if it interacts tidally with a slowly rotating host star .",
    "if it arrives near the stellar surface with a modest eccentricity , such a planet may be disrupted outside the star as a consequence of intense tidal dissipation on a timescale longer than the time needed for the star to reach the main sequence .",
    "but if it arrives near the stellar surface with an almost circular orbit , the planet may resume its inward migration as its host star s spin frequency declines below its orbit frequency . the driving force in this latter scenario is the dissipation of the planet s tidal disturbance in the star .",
    "this tidal interaction can cause the planet to eventually enter into the atmosphere and envelope of its host star while the star is still on the main sequence .",
    "a substantial portion of a cold planet s mass ( most importantly , a core ) may survive the plunge , although a definitive answer will require more sophisticated simulations .",
    "regardless , the destruction of a cold planet in a star could still pollute the star if the planet has little or no rock / ice core ( in other words , if its heavy elements are mixed throughout the planet ) .",
    "if a giant planet mostly disintegrates within the convection zone of its host star , the momentum input from the planet would increase the rotational velocity of the star s convection zone above @xmath169 if the convection zone rotates as a solid body . at the interface between the convective and radiative zones ,",
    "there is likely to be a large shear as a result .",
    "this shear could in principle result in mixing between the convection zone and interior , and thus would tend to weaken any pollution signature . to gain some guidance as to whether this could occur , we can look at the sun ( thompson et al . 1996 ) . for the sun , a tachocline transition layer ( spiegel & zahn 1992 ) separates the surface convection zone and the radiative interior , which have distinct rotational properties . it has been suggested that an interior magnetic field is responsible for confining the shear in the tachocline and quenching mixing between these regions ( gough & mcintyre 1998 ) . extrapolating from these solar phenomena , it it possible that the rotational and compositional mixing between the convection zone and the radiative interior of swps with masses near that of the sun would be limited",
    ". application of the stellar spin - down formula would imply that the surface rotational speed may be reduced substantially in less than a gyr , limiting the duration of any mixing that might occur .",
    "in stellar evolution , atomic species like , , , and b all provide valuable diagnostics of the evolution of surface convection zones , so it is worthwhile to try to understand how much information they can reveal about the frequency of pollution among planetary systems .",
    "the temperatures at the base of the convection zones of pre - main sequence stars result in complete depletion of and moderate depletion of , while is mostly unaffected .",
    "abundances constrain the pollution that can have occurred since an age of about 30 myr after star formation .",
    "we point out that the amount of detected in a star could distinguish between _ different _ pollution mechanisms if giant planets are formed around massive planetesimal cores , and that this test is mostly independent of giant planet mass .    the diagnostic usefulness of and the other species is limited for low - mass stars ( @xmath170 ) because their convection zones are too massive , diluting pollutants to the point that they are unobservable .",
    "unfortunately , these stars are also the ones that have the most nuclear processing of diagnostic species , and thus would be easiest to distinguish from an unpolluted star .",
    "stars with @xmath171 have relatively shallow convection zones that are easily polluted , but this also reduces the temperature at the base of the convection zone to the point that the depletion rates for the lithium isotopes are small . there is some evidence for depletion ( and therefore , presumably ) in this range from comparisons of stars in the pleiades , hyades , and older clusters like ngc 752 and m67 . and b are unlikely to be affected .    stars with masses a little above @xmath172 are not currently understood .",
    "standard models predict a small surface convection zone or none at all , while stars in the hyades ( a very well - studied cluster ) show severe depletion ( the so - called `` li dip '' ) .",
    "comparison with observations of other open clusters indicates that the depletion timescale for stars in the dip is less than about the age of the hyades ( @xmath173 myr ) .",
    "though a theoretical understanding of the depletion mechanism is currently lacking ( see pinsonneault 1997 ) , stars that would normally fall in the li dip seem to be excellent candidates for a search for evidence of pollution . deposited",
    "would be expected to survive for a large enough fraction of a swp s main sequence lifetime ( @xmath174 that the chances of detecting a pollution signature are favorable .",
    "this would be best accomplished using comparisons with open clusters of age similar to the host star .",
    "murray & chaboyer ( 2002 ) have recently asserted that the [ fe / h ] abundances for swps in the li dip can be explained by hypothesizing a mixed layer at the star s surface of the size needed to explain the depletion pattern .",
    "if true , a pollution signature would of course be diluted . in either case ,",
    "the diagnostic possibilities are good , and so we would like to add our voices to encourage observations of swps in this range .",
    "finally , we present a scenario which may account for the dynamical history of the system hd 82943 .",
    "we show that the resonant planets around hd 82943 are dynamically stable if the inner and outer planets have eccentricities @xmath175 and @xmath176 respectively . in this scenario , although the eccentricity of the inner resonant planet is the same as observed , that of the outer resonant planet is considerably smaller than that reported .",
    "we find that a planet with a mass @xmath177 and a semi - major axis @xmath178 au is dynamically decoupled from the resonant planets with semi - major axes of 0.73 and 1.16 au",
    ". the orbital configuration of this planetary system is similar to that of @xmath97 and , and it is formed naturally as a consequence of planet - disk interaction . under the action of tidal orbital evolution , this hypothetical short - period planet may have undergone orbital decay into the host star on a timescale less than 1 gyr .",
    "the analogues of such a planetary system might be observed around young stars after the t tauri phase of the star s evolution .",
    "the existence of short - period planets around relatively young stars with normal metal abundance is a natural prediction of this scenario .",

    "<S> third , we examine whether dynamical processes could bring a giant planet close enough to the star to destroy it , and whether the destruction of a planet would necessarily affect other planets in the system . while tidal interaction between protoplanets and their nascent disks may have led them to the proximity of their host stars , post - formation star - planet interaction can lead to tidal disruption of the planet and accretion of its material , or orbital decay followed by hydrodynamical interaction . throughout , we consider the case of hd 82943 , a star known to have two planets and having a preliminary detection of </S>",
