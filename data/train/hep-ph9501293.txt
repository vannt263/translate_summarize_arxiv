    "<S> the problem of the cosmological constant ( @xmath9 ) has been with us for over 75 years , ever since einstein introduced it in order to avoid an expanding universe . </S>",
    "<S> of course , einstein was misinformed , although on the other hand , since  whatever is not forbidden is mandatory \" one can say that he acted in a physically reasonable way . </S>",
    "<S> a lot of effort has been spent tackling this monumental problem , and yet a universally acceptable solution is still lacking . </S>",
    "<S> the basic problem is that the vacuum energy of ( spontaneously broken ) gauge quantum field theories , when coupled to gravity is metamorphosed into a cosmological constant which is usually much larger than the _ presently _ allowed one .    in this short note </S>",
    "<S> we propose yet another cosmological constant model . </S>",
    "<S> while our model contains seeds of some ideas that have been developed recently in the framework of non - critical string theory @xcite , it is motivated by more general , phenomenologically oriented principles , as well as by the recent determination of the hubble parameter ( @xmath10 ) by the hubble space telescope .    </S>",
    "<S> let us start from the einstein - friedmann equation of standard big - bang cosmology @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the hubble parameter , @xmath13 is the scale factor , @xmath14 is newton s constant , @xmath15 is the particle energy density , and @xmath16 is the curvature parameter for a closed / open / flat universe . </S>",
    "<S> the present day values of the various parameters ( @xmath17 , with @xmath18 the age ; @xmath19 , @xmath20 ) are extremely small or large , and make the standard big - bang cosmology rather unnatural . </S>",
    "<S> inflation has been introduced to solve some of these problems with great success : an  instantaneous \" blow up of the scale factor ( @xmath21 ) creates a smooth , effectively  </S>",
    "<S> flat \" ( , @xmath22 ) universe of the right size and entropy to describe our universe . </S>",
    "<S> this natural obliteration of the curvature term is rather effective , and it is interesting to see whether the same can be done to the cosmological  constant \" term . let us suppose that @xmath23 where @xmath1 is the </S>",
    "<S>  natural \" size of the cosmological constant , @xmath24 is the scale factor in units of the planck length , and @xmath25 is a constant to be determined by the present upper bound on @xmath9 : @xmath20 , and the present value of @xmath13 : @xmath26 . </S>",
    "<S> that is @xmath27 , and @xmath28 has the same @xmath13 dependence as the curvature term , and would give us today an acceptable and perhaps even detectable cosmological  constant \" . </S>",
    "<S> let us emphasize the effect of inflation by rewriting eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ friedman ] ) as @xmath29 . before inflation @xmath30 and </S>",
    "<S> both terms are comparable ; after inflation and reheating @xmath31 , @xmath32 and the cosmological constant term is very small compared to the radiation term . </S>",
    "<S> in the subsequent adiabatic expansion @xmath33 and we can write @xmath34 . </S>",
    "<S> this relation shows that the cosmological constant term becomes comparable to the radiation term at @xmath35 , , the usual early universe cosmology is undisturbed .    </S>",
    "<S> it is also useful to give the time dependence of @xmath9 , since this avoids keeping track of the rapid change in @xmath13 during the inflationary phase . </S>",
    "<S> an ansatz similar to that in eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ lambda - alpha ] ) gives @xmath36 implying that @xmath37 somehow ( this relation is only valid at late times ; in the early universe @xmath38 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> the above analysis is purely phenomenological , but suggests strongly that we should seek a fundamental theory which can produce such @xmath13 or @xmath39 dependence of the cosmological constant . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , an example of such a theory in the context of non - critical string theory already exists in the literature . in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite it was found that string theory admits only a few cosmologically interesting ( , expanding universe ) solutions , all leading asymptotically to a  vacuum \" characterized by @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the dilaton field , and the central charge deficit @xmath42 reflects the departure from criticality and gives rise to the cosmological constant @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the curvature ( ricci ) scalar @xmath43 , and in suitable units @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> that is , even in a flat universe ( @xmath45 ) we have an effective curvature which  fakes \" the cosmology of an _ open _ universe , as we discuss below . </S>",
    "<S> in other words , the detailed string equations of motion for this cosmological vacuum reduce , sufficiently below the planck scale , to an _ effective _ einstein - friedmann equation ( [ friedman ] ) with the phenomenologically desired @xmath13-dependent cosmological  constant \" .    </S>",
    "<S> it should be stressed that the above cosmological string vacuum should be viewed as the correct asymptotic vacuum of string theory , just as the minkowski vacuum is to ordinary point - particle quantum field theory . as such </S>",
    "<S> , we expect the above discussed ( @xmath13-dependent ) relations to hold in any realistic string vacuum where the full gravitational and matter multiplets are accounted for . the picture presented in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite has been completed by the addition of string dynamics in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , where it was argued that not only the cosmological  constant \" , but all  constants \" in nature ( , @xmath46 ) become time dependent . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the desired initial conditions @xmath47 and @xmath45 are derived in this dynamical scenario @xcite . also , in this dynamical scenario one obtains @xmath48 without an explicit reference to a time - dependent dilaton field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this is important since , as is , our toy model above entails a possibly troublesome time - dependent gauge coupling ( @xmath49 ) . </S>",
    "<S> our present phenomenological approach will be incorporated in the more rigorous string dynamics picture of ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite elsewhere  @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> we now elaborate on the observational consequences of our cosmological model . starting from eq .  </S>",
    "<S> ( [ friedman ] ) , one can easily determine the age of the universe in the matter - dominated era , with @xmath50 and @xmath51 ( also @xmath45 ) . in our flat universe model @xmath52 ( where @xmath53 , @xmath54 , and @xmath55 ) and we get @xmath56 this result has the property that @xmath57 is finite ( , @xmath58 ) for all values of @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> for comparison , the traditional cosmological constant model , where @xmath60 is truly constant , gives @xmath61 which diverges for @xmath62 . in numbers , the age of the universe is @xmath63 , where we take the recent hubble space telescope determination of @xmath64 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the results for various values of @xmath65 and both cosmological constant models are shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ age ] . </S>",
    "<S> we note that for sufficiently high values of @xmath3 , both models are generally consistent with the estimated age range of @xmath66 , although @xmath3 needs to be larger in our new model . </S>",
    "<S> for instance , if @xmath67 , @xmath68 for @xmath69 in our model , whereas @xmath70 would do in the traditional model .    by integrating the einstein - friedmann equation up to an arbitrary time @xmath39 </S>",
    "<S> , we can also determine the time - dependence of the scale factor , which for an  empty \" ( although  filled \" with a @xmath39-dependent cosmological  constant \" ) universe is supposed to be @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath71 where @xmath72 and @xmath73 . for @xmath74 </S>",
    "<S> this reduces to @xmath75 as anticipated . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the result in the traditional cosmological constant model is @xmath76 which for @xmath62 gives @xmath77 as expected . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath39-dependence of the scale factor for various values of @xmath3 is shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ r(t ) ] .    </S>",
    "<S> since the age of the universe constraint appears to require a substantial value of @xmath3 ( , @xmath69 ) , in our flat model the matter relic abundance will need to be suppressed ( , @xmath78 ) . </S>",
    "<S> this situation would appear to be similar to the traditional cosmological constant model studied in the literature @xcite which has some advantages and some disadvantages . </S>",
    "<S> however , this is not so , since in our case we effectively have a low - density open universe , with different ( and perhaps more desirable ) properties regarding structure formation @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the particle physics contribution to the relic density ( @xmath79 ) can be easily accomodated in a supersymmetric model with say @xmath80 , as explored previously in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    in sum </S>",
    "<S> , we have proposed a new cosmological model with a  running \" cosmological constant which , starting at the planck time at its natural value , evolves with time as @xmath81 and attains a present - day value in agreement with observations . </S>",
    "<S> this model is supported by non - critical string theory considerations , which also provide a justification for the initial conditions used . our effectively low - density open universe model should be testable in ongoing particle physics experiments as well as through cosmological observations of the age and structure of the universe . curiously enough , </S>",
    "<S> if indeed it holds true that the cosmological constant is both non - zero and time - dependent , it would fulfill dirac s prophesy that there are no small constants , simply the universe is too old @xcite , and at the same time it would redeem einstein from what he thought was the biggest blunder of his life , , the introduction of the cosmological constant , leaving only the very minor blunder of thinking that a cosmological constant different from zero was indeed a blunder ! </S>"
