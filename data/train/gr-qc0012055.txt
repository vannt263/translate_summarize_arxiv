    "black holes are among the simplest and most beautiful objects in the universe .",
    "they are made of spacetime and electromagnetic field only , and they have just three classical degrees of freedom which may be taken to be the mass @xmath0 , electric charge @xmath1 and the angular momentum @xmath2 of the hole .",
    "although the number of classical degrees of freedom of black holes is just three , however , one expects that there is an enormous number of quantum mechanical degrees of freedom associated with black holes . during some recent years , string theory and loop theoretic approaches to quantum gravity",
    "have greatly improved our understanding on the nature of these quantum mechanical degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "as it happens , there is a resemblance between black holes and hydrogen atoms . like a black hole",
    ", a hydrogen atom has just three classical degrees of freedom .",
    "indeed , the system looks very simple : an electron whirls around the proton , and the classical degrees of freedom may be taken to be the @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9coordinates of the electron .",
    "quantum field theoretical investigations reveal , however , an enormous number of quantum mechanical degrees of freedom associated with virtual electron - positron pairs and photons .",
    "still , the quantum mechanical properties of the hydrogen atom may be described , as an excellent approximation , by its non - relativistic schrdinger equation which takes into account the three classical degrees of freedom only .",
    "the resemblance between black holes and hydrogen atoms gives rise to an interesting question of a possibility to construct a quantum - mechanical model of a black hole which , although it takes into account the three classical degrees of freedon of black holes only , nevertheless describes their quantum mechanical properties with a reasonable accuracy . in this paper",
    "we shall consider one such model of black holes .",
    "of course , even classical black hole spacetimes may perform all sorts of vibrations and oscillations which provide them with an enormous number of additional degrees of freedom , but in this paper we are interested in stationary black holes only . in other words",
    ", we are quantizing the stationary sector of black hole spacetimes , and such a sector is characterized by just three classical degrees of freedom  @xcite .",
    "our model is based on an observation that even stationary black hole spacetimes have _",
    "dynamics_. more precisely , even stationary black hole spacetimes have a region which does not admit a timelike killing vector field .",
    "this means that in a certain spacetime region the black hole spacetime geometry evolves in time no matter how we choose the time coordinate .",
    "it is this time evolution of black hole spacetime geometry on which we focus our attention and which , in our model , is responsible for the quantum mechanical properties of black holes .    to see what this means consider , as an example , the simplest possible black hole , the schwarzschild black hole .",
    "it has the spacetime metric @xmath10 one observes that when @xmath11 , the coordinate @xmath12 becomes timelike , and because spacetime geometry inside the event horizon depends on @xmath12 , it evolves in time . in that region",
    "@xmath12 describes the radius of the wormhole throat of the black hole . in a more precise manner",
    "the fact that spacetime inside the event horizon really has dynamics in its geometry can be seen if one considers the conformal diagram of kruskal spacetime : when @xmath11 one can not move in any timelike direction without changing @xmath12 , and therefore the geometry of the spacelike hypersurfaces of spacetime . in reissner - nordstrm and kerr - newman black hole",
    "spacetimes the dynamical region lies in the intermediate region between the outer and the inner horizons of the hole .",
    "in this paper we consider the hamiltonian quantization of kerr - newman black hole spacetimes in such a manner that , in the classical level , the phase space coordinates of the theory describe the dynamics of the intermediate region between the horizons in a natural way .",
    "the kerr - newman solution is a specific solution to einstein s and maxwell s equations in vacuum . because of that",
    ", we begin our investigations in section  [ sec : hamfor ] by a general study of the hamiltonian formulation of the einstein - maxwell theory , paying particular attention to the boundary terms which are needed in asymptotically flat electrovacuum spacetimes , such as kerr - newman spacetimes , to make the hamiltonian formulation consistent .",
    "we shall see in later sections that these boundary terms play a most fundamental role in the quantum theory of kerr - newman black holes . in section  [ sec : bound ]",
    "we calculate these boundary terms for maximally extended kerr - newman spacetimes .",
    "it turns out that from the boundary terms one can read off the mass , electric charge and angular momentum of the black hole .",
    "the study of the classical hamiltonian dynamics of kerr - newman black hole spacetimes is performed in section  [ sec : hamdyn ] .",
    "basically , our study is based on an important theorem proved by regge and teitelboim  @xcite .",
    "this theorem states , essentially , that the physical hamiltonian of asymptotically flat spacetime with matter fields can be gained if we first solve the classical constraints , and then substitute the solutions to the constraints , in terms of the physical phase space coordinates of the theory , to the boundary terms at asymptotic spacelike infinity .",
    "at the first stage we take the phase space coordinates to be the mass @xmath0 , the electric charge @xmath1 and the angular momentum @xmath2 of the hole , together with the corresponding canonical momenta @xmath13 and @xmath14 , and we write the sum of the boundary terms , and hence the classical hamiltonian , in terms of these phase space coordinates .",
    "it is unclear whether the assumptions of the regge s and teitelboim s theorem are valid for kerr - newman spacetime and the variables @xmath15 and @xmath14 , but we accept this as an unproved hypothesis and see where it takes us . at the second stage",
    "we perform a canonical transformation from the variables @xmath16 and @xmath2 and their canonical momenta to the new variables and their canonically conjugate momenta which describe better the dynamics of the intermediate region between the horizons of the kerr - newman black hole . in terms of these phase space variables",
    "we write the classical hamiltonian of kerr - newman spacetimes in a specific foliation where the flat minkowski time coordinate of an asymptotic observer at rest at a faraway infinity coincides with the the proper time of a freely falling observer at the throat of the black hole .",
    "an explicit example of such a foliation is presented in appendix  [ app : b ] .    in section  [ sec : quant ] we proceed to quantization",
    ". a straightforward replacement of the classical hamiltonian by the corresponding self - adjoint hamiltonian operator yields an equation which , in a certain very restricted sense , may be considered as a sort of `` schrdinger equation of black holes '' .",
    "that equation is the main result of this paper . in the natural units , where @xmath17 , and when a particular operator ordering has been chosen , it can be written , in terms of the configuration variables @xmath18 and @xmath19 of the theory , as : @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the wave function of the kerr - newman black hole .    besides of being an equation of considerable simplicity , our `` schrdinger equation '' has many interesting consequences .",
    "for instance , it predicts that the mass , electric charge and angular momentum spectra of black holes are discrete .",
    "in particular , the mass spectrum is bounded from below and can be made positive by means of an appropriate choice of a self - adjoint extension . as a matter of fact , one may prove even more than that : it is possible to choose operator orderings and self - adjoint extensions such that the spectrum of the quantity @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the angular momentum per unit mass , is _ strictly positive_. regarding hawking radiation ,",
    "this is very interesting result : it implies that a non - extreme black hole can never become , by means of hawking radiation , an extreme hole .",
    "this result is in agreement with the third law of black hole thermodynamics , and is therefore a strong argument in favor of the physical validity of our model .    at the high end of the spectrum , we find that the eigenvalues of the sum of the areas of the horizons of the hole which we shall call , for the sake of convenience , the _ total area _ of the black hole , are of the form @xmath24 where @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the planck length . as such our result",
    "is closely related , although not quite identical to bekenstein s proposal  @xcite . according to that proposal , the spectrum of the outer horizon of the hole is of the form @xmath27 where @xmath25 and @xmath28 is pure number of order one .",
    "arguments in favor of the claim that it is perhaps not the area of the exterior horizon but the sum of the areas which should have an equal spacing in its spectrum will be given in section  [ sec : conc ] .",
    "finally , our model implies a very interesting discrete spectrum for the angular momentum of kerr - newman black holes . for uncharged holes near extremality , the angular momentum eigenvalues are of the form @xmath29 where @xmath30",
    "the einstein - maxwell theory is a theory of electromagnetic field interacting with gravitational field . in this section",
    "we shall develope the hamiltonian formulation of such a theory in all details , paying particular attention to the boundary terms appearing in asymptotically flat spacetimes as a consequence of the requirement of internal consistency of the theory .",

    "the fundamental ideas behind our model were based on the black hole uniqueness theorems . according to these theorems a black hole in stationary spacetime",
    "is completely characterized by exactly three free variables which may taken to be the mass @xmath0 , the electric charge @xmath1 and the angular momentum @xmath2 of the hole . from these theorems",
    "it follows that the kerr - newman solution , being completely characterized by these three free variables , is the most general stationary black hole solution to combined einstein - maxwell equations . in our model",
    "we considered a hamiltonian quantum theory of stationary black hole spacetimes in such a way that the phase space was spanned by the variables @xmath0 , @xmath2 and @xmath1 , together with the corresponding canonical momenta @xmath149 , @xmath14 and @xmath150 .",
    "the problem with these phase space coordinates , however , is that they describe the _",
    "static _ aspects of black hole spacetimes only .",
    "however , there is _ dynamics _ in kerr - newman spacetimes in the sense that between the horizons there is no timelike killing vector field , and we managed to find new phase space coordinates which describe the dynamical properties of kerr - newman spacetime in a particularly natural manner .",
    "these phase space coordinates were replaced by the corresponding quantum mechanical operators yielding the symmetric hamiltonian operator .",
    "our analysis produced eq .",
    "( [ eigeneq ] ) which , in a certain very restricted sense , may be considered as a sort of `` schrdinger equation of black holes '' .",
    "that equation gives , in the context of our model , the mass , electric charge and angular momentum spectra of black holes .",
    "( [ eigeneq ] ) , which is the main result of this paper , implies that the mass , electric charge and angular momentum spectra of black holes are discrete .",
    "moreover , it implies that the mass spectrum is bounded from below and can be made positive . by means of a choice of an appropriate self - adjoint extension",
    "one may show that the spectrum of the quantity @xmath22 where @xmath4 is the angular momentum per unit mass of the hole , is always positive .",
    "regarding hawking radiation , this is a very important result : it means that a non - extreme black hole can never become an extreme black hole by means of the hawking radiation of black holes .",
    "this result is in agreement with the third law of black hole thermodynamics , and is therefore a strong argument in favor of the physical validity of our model .    at the high end of the spectrum , eq .",
    "( [ eigeneq ] ) implied that the eigenvalues of the quantities @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath4 are all quantized , in natural units , in a very similar manner : in natural units the eigenvalues of these quantities are all of the form @xmath5 , where n is an integer .",
    "although this kind of a spectrum might appear very odd for an electric charge spectrum of black holes , it is exactly what one expects on dimensional grounds . in the extremal limit , eq .",
    "( [ eigeneq ] ) implied that the angular momentum eigenvalues of black holes are of the form @xmath333 where @xmath334 .",
    "of particular interest is the area spectrum of black holes given by eq .",
    "( [ eigeneq ] ) .",
    "( [ eigeneq ] ) implied that the sum of the areas of the two horizons of kerr - newman black hole is of the form @xmath335 where @xmath336 is the planck length .",
    "hence , we get a result which is closely related , although not quite identical to , the proposal made by bekenstein in 1974 .",
    "according to bekenstein s proposal , it is not the sum of areas of horizon but the area of the outer horizon which has an equal spacing in its spectrum .",
    "although our result about an equal spacing for the spectrum of the sum of the horizon areas may have certain esthetic merits , it also involves some problems . for instance , the fact that the mass eigenvalues are of the form @xmath337 which , together with the fact that @xmath1 and @xmath4 have similar spectra , implied the area spectrum under consideration , also implies that the angular frequencies of quanta of hawking radiation emitted in transitions between nearby states is @xmath338 for schwarzschild black holes this is something one might expect because the hawking temperature of such a hole is  @xcite @xmath339 and therefore it follows from wien s displacement law that the maximum of the thermal spectrum of black hole radiation corresponds to the angular frequency @xmath340 in other words , the angular frequency associated with the discrete spectrum of hawking radiation as predicted by our model , behaves , as a function of @xmath0 , in the same way as does the angular frequency corresponding to the maximum of the thermal spectrum as predicted by hawking and others .",
    "unfortunately , this nice correspondence between hawking s result and our model breaks down when @xmath1 or @xmath4 are different from zero . in that case",
    "the hawking temperature of the black hole is  @xcite @xmath341 } \\ , \\label{th}\\ ] ] and one finds that the maximum of the thermal spectrum corresponds to the angular frequency @xmath342 in other words , the angular frequency ( [ omegam ] ) predicted by our model corresponds , when the hole is near extremality , to a temperature which is much _ higher _ than the hawking temperature .",
    "however , there may be a possible way out of this problem . in all our investigation",
    "we have emphasized the importance of the dynamics of the intermediate region between the horizons of the black hole .",
    "the dynamics of this intermediate region is , in our model , responsible for the discrete eigenvalues of the mass , electric charge and angular momentum of the hole .",
    "now , if we take this point of view to its extreme limits we are tempted to speculate that both of the horizons of the hole , acting as the boundaries of the intermediate region , may participate , in one way or another , in the radiation process of the black hole . in other words ,",
    "both of the horizons may radiate .",
    "the radiation emitted by the inner horizon is probably emitted inside the inner horizon , and is therefore not observed by the external observer .",
    "nevertheless , an emission of this radiation is likely to reduce considerably the number of quanta , and hence the temperature , of the radiation coming out from the hole : the more the inner horizon radiates , the less quanta are left for the outer horizon .",
    "let us give up for a moment our resistance to this most charming temptation and have a play with the thought that both of the horizons have an important role in black hole radiation .",
    "for instance , one might consider one quarter of the total area of the hole as a sort of a `` total entropy '' of the hole @xmath343 moreover , one might be inclined to define a temperature @xmath344 corresponding to this entropy ( whatever that means ) such that @xmath345 and one finds , quite unexpectedly , that @xmath346 in other words , we have recovered the hawking temperature of the schwarzschild black hole ( see eq .",
    "( [ htemp ] ) ) .",
    "this expression is the same for all black holes , and it is inversely proportional to the mass @xmath0 of the hole .",
    "it may well be that all this is just meaningless play with symbols , without any physical content , but nevertheless the idea that it is the total area , and not the area of the outer horizon , which is of fundamental importance in black hole quantum mechanics , appears to possess remarkable internal consistency : if the total area of the hole has equal spacing in its spectrum , one expects the temperature of the hole to be inversely proportional to the mass @xmath0 , and this result is recovered if the total entropy of the hole is taken to be one quarter of not the area of the outer horizon but of the total area of the hole .",
    "we shall investigate these ideas in more details in forthcoming papers .",
    "to conclude , our quantum - mechanical model of kerr - newman black holes appears to involve several physically sensible properties but also some problems .",
    "for instance , the claim that kerr - newman spacetime and our phase space variables satisfy the assumptions of regge s and teitelboim s theorem has been left unproved . the proper analysis of the hamiltonian dynamics of kerr - newman spacetimes along the lines shown by kucha for schwarzscild spacetime should therefore be performed  @xcite .",
    "another problem is , whether the quantum mechanics of black holes can be described with a sufficient accuracy by means of a model having just three independent degrees of freedom .",
    "in other words , are the mass , electric charge and angular momentum spectra obtained from our model reliable ?",
    "when answering to this question one can just say that at least the spectra are such as one might expect on semiclassical and dimensional grounds .",
    "as to the problems related to the statistical origin of black hole entropy and things like that our model says nothing .",
    "another , more esoteric , reason why our model may probably contain some hints of truth is its simplicity and certain naturality . such things , however , are merely matters of taste and should not be trusted too much",
