    "<S> the competition between crystal field anisotropy , exchange interaction and zeeman energy and their coupling to lattice degrees of freedom must be critical for the understanding of the experiment observations and the me effect . in any case , the break - down of lro in dyfeo@xmath0 observed in our experiments challenges the theory that the @xmath12 afm structure of dy remains unchanged under applied magnetic field and the mf transition is a result of the fe spin reorientation alone .     </S>",

    "<S> the field induced lro to sro transition is further demonstrated in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ hdepd](a , b ) . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic field reduces the correlation length of the dy afm order as shown by the broaden peak width and reduces the bragg intensity . </S>",
    "<S> the sro stabilizes and becomes field independent above the critical field . </S>",
    "<S> the fe reorientation occurs almost simultaneously with the dy lro to sro transition , see fig .  </S>",

    "<S> this explains why in magnetization measurement only one anomaly remains at high fields in fig .  </S>",

    "<S> is observed at the critical field . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to note that such a magnetostrictive coupling exists at 5 k without the dy magnetic ordering . </S>",
    "<S> but the multiferroice behavior emerges only when the dy moments form short - range ordered afm structure .    </S>",
    "<S> significant hysteresis in dyfeo@xmath0 was observed recently in magnetization , polarization and thermal conductivity measurements under magnetic field @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> a new phase of fe magnetic order is proposed for the hysteresis region @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , our neutron diffraction results in fig .  [ hdepd ] clearly show that there is no detectable hysteresis in the fe magnetic transition . </S>",
    "<S> the hysteresis exists only in the dy lro - sro transition . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the sizable non - reversible effects in the bulk measurements @xcite are due to the coupling to the dy sro . complex domain competition has been observed in other orthoferrites @xmath4feo@xmath0 @xcite , and different tuning rate could lead to different macroscopic response @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hysteresis of the sro could also play a role in these materials .    </S>",
    "<S> the sro phase is important for the formation of electric polarization in the realization of the mf effect . </S>",
    "<S> if zero field cooled into well formed lro phase , there s no polarization even under finite electric field in the paraelectric state ( fig .  4 in @xcite ) , until close to the critical magnetic field where we now know that the dy sro state has appeared . according to the exchange striction mechanism </S>",
    "<S> , the spontaneous electric polarization emerges out of displacements of dy@xmath43 ions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such displacement is likely disfavored by the lro , and the relaxing into the sro state could lower the energy . </S>",
    "<S> the poling treatment in multiferroic study usually helps to select one favorable domain . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting that in the case of dyfeo@xmath0 , field cooling also helps to ` freeze ' the dy moments into sro state and hinders the restoring of lro even when field is released .    in summary </S>",
    "<S> , in the combined neutron diffraction and magnetization work on dyfeo@xmath0 , we found that the fe spin reorientation phase is stabilized by the dy long - range afm order , both of which are suppressed by a magnetic field applying in the @xmath1-axis at @xmath45 . while the fe order is replaced by the wfm order , the dy lro by the sro of the same @xmath12 afm structure of a correlation length @xmath46 . </S>",
    "<S> the shortening of the correlation length and the break - up of the dy lro by the field are gradual and show substantial hysteresis . </S>",
    "<S> the appearance of the dy sro phase and its hysteresis coincide with the appearance and hysteresis of the magnetoelectric effect in this strong multiferroic material . </S>",
    "<S> the understanding of this prototype rare - earth orthoferrite multiferroic material ought to be refined by considering the field - induced dy antiferromagnetic short - range order in addition to the fe wfm order .    </S>",
