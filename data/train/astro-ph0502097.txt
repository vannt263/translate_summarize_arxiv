    "the general astrometric principle of gaia is similar to that of hipparcos .",
    "it scans the sky with a pre - defined scanning law measuring the relative positions of objects .",
    "however , the two missions are fundamentally different in various ways , one of the most relevant being that gaia goes much deeper , namely to about @xmath1=20 rather than @xmath2=12.4 as with hipparcos .",
    "thus whereas hipparcos had an input catalogue , gaia performs real - time onboard detection .",
    "consequently , we generally have very little prior information about the targets which gaia observes .",
    "for this reason , gaia is equipped with multiband ccd photometry in order to characterize its targets . as described elsewhere in these proceedings , this consists of 46 broad band filters in the astrometric instrument , and around 12 medium band filters in the spectroscopic instrument .",
    "the main scientific goal of gaia is to study the composition , origin and evolution of our galaxy .",
    "its main contribution to this topic is establishing very accurate stellar distances and 2d ( or 3d ) space motions , enabling us to study the 3d spatial structure and 3d kinematic phase space of different types of stars in the galaxy .",
    "however , such information is of limited use if it can not be associated with the intrinsic physical properties of these stars , in particular their abundances , masses and ages ( or evolutionary state ) .",
    "hence gaia is not `` just '' about producing a catalogue of highly accurate astrometry and multiband photometry on hundreds of millions of stars .",
    "an integral part of the mission and data processing is to add essential scientific value to these by providing fundamental physical information on the targets .",
    "the challenge is to design a classification system  and develop appropriate algorithms  which can take the heterogeneous gaia data and extract reliable estimations of the classes of objects and their physical parameters .",
    "this article gives a brief outline of the goals , requirements and issues facing this work .",
    "the main objectives of the classification are as follows    discrete source classification : :    determination of whether an object is a star , galaxy , quasar or    asteroid etc .",
    "this could also include the use of morphological    information .",
    "estimation of astrophysical parameters ( aps ) : :    for those objects identified as stars , determine their intrinsic    physical properties .",
    "the relevant ( and obtainable ) ones are effective    temperature , , surface gravity , , metallicity , , and line - of - sight    interstellar extinction , .",
    "although this last one is of course not    intrinsic to the star , we would ideally determine it on a star - by - star    basis , so we can consider it as such .",
    "other aps of interest ( and which    could be determined for bright stars with the spectroscopy from the    rvs instrument ) include : alpha - process elements , , cno abundance    anomalies , the microturbulence velocity , rotational velocity and    activity .",
    "identification of unresolved binaries : :    most stars are in multiple systems .",
    "some of these can be recognised    from the astrometry , and a few will be visual binaries , but most will    go undetected in this way .",
    "nonetheless , with favourable brightness    ratios , a binary could be detected from the shape of its composite    spectral energy distribution .",
    "this is important for determining the    stellar mass function ( as opposed to the system mass function ) and for    investigating the evolution of stellar clusters .",
    "identification of new types of objects : :    the history of astronomical discovery shows that new instruments ,    surveys and data analysis techniques lead to new , unexpected    discoveries .",
    "thus with gaia we must be open to the prospect of    detecting new types of objects ( summarized by the cliche `` expect the    unexpected '' . )",
    "this includes new types of variable stars , rare stars    ( e.g.  brief phases of stellar evolution ) , abnormal abundance patterns    or multiple systems .",
    "those supervised classification methods which are    commonly used for determining stellar parameters from spectra are    generally forced to classify new types of objects into pre - existing    classes .",
    "new objects would therefore go undetected ( and samples of    known types of objects would be contaminated ) . thus special attention ,    including the use of unsupervised methods , is required to deal with    this .",
    "these classification tasks must rely mostly on the photometric data , as only these extend to the magnitude limit of gaia s onboard detection and thus astrometry . but recall that the photometry is obtained in two separate instruments , bbp and mbp . only the former is obtained at the same spatial resolution as the astrometric data .",
    "thus in sufficiently crowded fields we will only have bbp data , that is between 4 and 6 broad photometric bands . for bright stars ,",
    "say brighter than @xmath3 , we will also have reasonable quality rvs spectra , which will add considerable information , in particular on detailed abundances , peculiarities , rapid rotation and so forth .",
    "finally , the parallaxes will of course also be valuable , as discussed in the next section .",
    "the most fundamental properties of a star are its mass , age and chemical composition . of course , age is not directly observable and masses can only be determined directly ( i.e.  dynamically ) in select binary systems .",
    "thus we must rely on indirect atmospheric indicators which can be obtained from the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) .",
    "in particular , we are interested in the effective temperature , , surface gravity ,  and the iron - peak metallicity , . combined with the parallax and interstellar extinction , the luminosity , radius and mass can be determined .",
    "llll + nsed , ( rvs ) & @xmath4 & , , , & + & & , bc , ? & atmospheric model +   +   + sed , bc , ,   & @xmath4 & l & @xmath5 + & & & @xmath6 + l ,   & @xmath4 & r & @xmath7 + , r & @xmath4 & m & @xmath8 +   + sed , rvs , ( t ) , ( t ) & @xmath4 & detect unresolved binaries & orbital model + sed(t ) , rvs(t ) & @xmath4 & detect variables & variability model +    most work on stellar parametrization has relied on relatively high resolution spectra from which ,  and  have been determined .",
    "gaia is rather different in that it observes at lower spectral resolution but measures absolute fluxes as well as parallaxes .",
    "table  [ parameters ] shows how stellar parameters can in principle be derived from these data .",
    "the distance measurement accuracy for v=15 is 1% at 1kpc and 5% at 5kpc . at v=18",
    "these are about 4% and 20% respectively .",
    "( these improve by a factor of two or more for late - type or very reddened stars . )",
    "thus some 20 million stars will have their distances determined to better than 1% and have high precision seds . if  can be established to 1% then the radii of many of these stars is determinable to within 2% .",
    "if  can be measured to 0.2  dex , then provided r ( radius ) can be established to within 10% , a mass determination to within 50% is possible without calibration from binary systems .",
    "although poor for an individual star , it becomes statistically meaningful for a large sample of similar stars , which is where gaia s strength lies .",
    "better individual masses will be possible from calibration using the tens of thousands of visual binaries observed by gaia for which masses should be obtained to within 10% ( and many thousands within 1% ) .",
    "individual ages ( possibly with large uncertainties ) can be quantified from evolutionary models .",
    "a proper treatment of interstellar extinction is very important . without accurate line - of - sight extinction measurements ,",
    "the accurate parallaxes and apparent magnitude measurements can not be converted into absolute magnitudes and thus intrinsic luminosities and radii .",
    "for example , to determine the radius to 2% , the extinction must be measured to within 0.03 mags .",
    "when trying to determine several astrometric parameters from a dataset there exists the problem of parameter degeneracy , i.e.  two different astrophysical parameters manifesting themselves in the same way in the sed in certain parts of the astrophysical parameter space .",
    "an example is  and extinction in late - type stars , where lowering  has a similar effect on the sed ( at low resolution ) as increasing the extinction .",
    "clearly , for degenerate cases , a parametrization algorithm is required which can give a range of possible parameters , and not just a single set .",
    "most stellar systems consist of more than one component .",
    "undetected binaries bias the parameter determinations when the brightness ratio is small ( e.g.  a higher luminosity for a given  leads to an erroneous  determination ) .",
    "many long period and/or distant binaries will go undetected with the astrometry . in these cases ,",
    "parametrization techniques are required which can identify binary stars from their composite seds and ideally parametrize both components .",
    "classification and parameter estimation is the problem of assigning object classes or aps and generally involves determining some kind of mapping from the data space to the parameter space ( fig .",
    "[ mapping ] ) .",
    "a frequently used approach is the _ supervised _ or pattern matching approach , in which pre - classified data ( _ templates _ ) are used to infer the desired mapping .",
    "this mapping is then applied to new data to establish their classes or aps .",
    "perhaps the most familiar such technique is the minimum distance method ( mdm ) , shown schematically in fig .",
    "this is a _ local _ template matching method , in which only the properties of the local neighbours in the data space influence the aps of the new object . here",
    ", we make a local fit of the mapping function , or even just assign the aps of the nearest template to the new object .",
    "= 0.45    = 0.35 = 0.40    however , such local approaches quickly run into the well - known ` curse of dimensionality ' . as the dimensionality , @xmath9 , of the data space increases , the density of the templates decreases ( for a fixed number of templates ) .",
    "for example , with mdm we may assign aps by averaging the aps of those nearest neighbours selected such that they fill a fraction @xmath10 of the entire data space around the new object . to do this in @xmath9 dimensions , and if the templates were uniformly spaced , we would have to include neighbours out to a fractional distance of order @xmath11 in each data dimension . with @xmath12 and @xmath13",
    "this gives @xmath14 , i.e.  templates out to 10% of the full range of each data dimension are included .",
    "but if we increase the number of data dimensions ( i.e.  if we have more filters or more spectral bins ) , to , say @xmath15 , then we see that @xmath16 .",
    "that is , the `` nearest '' neighbours now extend to 63% of the entire range of each data dimension .",
    "such distant neighbours are likely to be completely unrelated to the new object .",
    "the result is that we get a very large bias in our ap estimation using local methods .",
    "the only way to avoid this is if we increase the number of templates exponentially with @xmath9 , but this quickly becomes inhibitive .",
    "if we simply shrink our neighbourhood volume we may not have any neighbours at all , or , if we have only one or two neighbours then we will get a large variance in the ap estimate .    a more sensible way of overcoming this problem is to either use structured regression or a global regression approach . in the former we compensate for the lack of data at a local scale by making assumptions about the shape or properties of the mapping function . with global regression",
    "we also do this , but we furthermore use all of the available data to form a single regression over the entire data .",
    "examples of this include neural networks and support vector machines .",
    "= 0.35 = 0.35    there are , however , additional issues . classification and",
    "ap estimation is the process of mapping from the data space to the ap or class space .",
    "by contrast , simulation of source seds is the opposite mapping , i.e.  from the ap space to the data space .",
    "the fomer mapping which we are interested in determining is therefore an inverse mapping .",
    "this is generally non - unique . in other words , whereas a given set of aps provides a unique sed , two sets of aps could produce the same sed .",
    "this is compounded by the effects of noise",
    ". the larger the photometric noise on a sed or set of flux measurements , the greater the number of different possible sets of aps this could correspond to .",
    "this is illustrated schematically in fig .",
    "[ degeneracy ] . in the top panel",
    "we see that there are four templates ( those lying within the noise bounds ) which give rise to data consistent with the new observation .",
    "confronted with this degeneracy we must decide what to do .",
    "do we quote all results ?",
    "do we average the aps ?",
    "there are in fact whole ranges of the ap which are consistent with the data , so an unweighted average will be biased by the distribution of the nearest templates .",
    "moreover , at large ap , there is actually another solution which we have completely failed to recognise due to the low density of templates in that region .",
    "the problem is worse with a lower density template grid ( bottom panel ) , or , equivalently , lower noise data .",
    "clearly , a local method which just assigns the aps using the nearest neighbours will give biased results .",
    "but even with a global regression we have problems , as the function we are trying to approximate may not be single valued , so the regression could go very wrong where we have these degeneracies .",
    "( think of rotating the top panel of fig .",
    "[ degeneracy ] by 90@xmath17 and trying to fit a single - valued function through the templates . )",
    "we may assess this by training a global model ( in this case a neural network ) on simulated gaia photometric data and then examining the mapping it has learned .",
    "this is shown in figs .",
    "[ pred_teff ] and  [ pred_feh ] .",
    "projections of the true relationship between the filter fluxes and the aps are shown as stars .",
    "projections of the mapping learned by the network are shown as triangles .",
    "of course , the network is learning the mapping in the inverse sense from the way it is plotted ( that is , given the fluxes in all filters , it predicts the aps ) .",
    "both plots are derived from the same network which had 15 inputs ( one per filter ) and 3 inputs ( one per ap ) .",
    "the training data grid consisted of many thousands of spectra over a wide range of ,  and  combinations for stars of @xmath18 with simulated end - of - mission photometry .",
    "examining fig .",
    "[ pred_teff ] we see that the network has done very well in determining the  mapping .",
    "it manages to reproduce most of the small scale feature of the mappings . only at the lowest temperatures",
    "does it have problems .",
    "this is due at least in part to the difficulty most regression models have at the boundaries of data sets , which arises because the regression is essentially only constrained on one side . in many of these one - dimensional cuts , the data to ap mapping",
    "is not single valued .",
    "the fact that the neural network can nonetheless produce the correct mapping shows that in this 15 dimensional data space the stellar data must lie on a lower dimensional manifold which does not show any serious degeneracies ( for  and  fixed ) .",
    "[ pred_feh ] shows the mapping as a function of metallicity keeping  and  fixed .",
    "we straight away see that even though the true mapping is simpler , the neural network has more problems reproducing it .",
    "the reason for this can be seen when we compare the vertical ( photon count ) scale of the two plots : the variance in counts across the full range of  is much smaller than the count variance across the full range of .",
    "putting it another way ,  is a ` weak ' ap compared to , in that varying  by x percent of its full range has a much smaller effect on the data ( sed ) than does varying  by the same amount .",
    "the effects of  are subtler and therefore harder to extract from the dominant effect of .",
    "this is compounded further by noise ( which is small here ) and the effects of the other parameters .",
    "the task of designing the classification system for gaia , and for developing , testing and implementing the required algorithms , is the task of the gaia classification working group .",

    "work on the classification system for gaia is still in its early days .",
    "given the heterogeneity of the gaia data , plus the enormous range of objects and aps which it must deal with , classifying the gaia data is not a simple task of applying some black box classifier to the entire data set .",
    "some of the key issues which need to be addressed are as follows .    1 .   a proper handling of ap degeneracies .",
    "if degeneracies can not be avoided in the photometric system ( and they almost certainly can not be ) , then we must at least identify where they occur . because we know the forward mapping ( data @xmath20 aps ) from stellar models , we can in principle determine this .",
    "this information could be used to perform a partition of the data space such that each partition is handled by a separate regression model , free of degeneracies .",
    "2 .   coping with ` weak ' aps .",
    "methods exist for boosting the sensitivity of a regression model to weak aps , e.g.  increasing their contribution in the error minimization used to train the model ( this is already used in our neural network models ) .",
    "however , other approaches need to be considered , such as iterative or hierarchical approaches in which first the strong aps are determined and then the weaker ones given our knowledge of the strong aps .",
    "3 .   dealing with systematic and correlated errors .",
    "this is related to the issue of ` strong ' and ` weak ' aps .",
    "4 .   training and regularization of models . while global models have some advantages over local ones , they are sensitive to the distribution ( across aps ) of the training data",
    "this can introduce biases in the sense that it implicitly sets a prior probability on the aps of new objects .",
    "5 .   combining heterogeneous data . for sufficiently bright objects we have available two sets of photometric data ( at different spatial resolutions ) , spectroscopic data and a parallax .",
    "it needs to be carefully considered how , from an algorithmic perspective , these data should best be combined to yield a self - consistent set of aps for a object . on the other hand , discrepancies could be important as they could indicate peculiar objects .",
    "not all objects can be treated the same way .",
    "for example , the quality of the rvs data will vary enormously , and the good estimates of the data uncertainties which we can get from our instrument models should also be utilized .",
    "so far we have trained models and assessed performance mostly using synthetic data , as this is the only source of data at the required resolution and wavelength coverage ( for simulating the gaia photometry ) covering the required wide range of aps .",
    "determining physical parameters is the ultimate goal , so at some level stellar models and synthetic spectra must be used .",
    "but there will be limitations if we rely only on synthetic data for training models .",
    "one idea is to use a limited set of actual gaia data of well - known stars to calibrate the classification models , for example by adjusting the training data . if insufficient well - known stars ( with well determined aps )",
    "exist in gaia s catalogue , additional ground - based observations will be necessary to better characterize them in a homogeneous way . such observing programs could and should start before the gaia mission . 7 .",
    "so far no attention has been paid to using morphological information , for example to perform star / galaxy discrimination .",
    "this will be partly the role of the onboard detection algorithms .",
    "a number of issues have not yet been addressed , although work is starting on them .",
    "these include : galaxy classification ; asteroid classification ; classification of special types of stars ( i.e.  those for which we do not have reliable synthetic spectra ) ; dealing with anomalous extinction .",
    "finally , some kind of unsupervised classification , or internal classification scheme , should be investigated .",
    "such approaches are independent of any physical models or pre - defined classification scheme and allow us to look for natural groupings within the data .",
    "this type of exploratory data analysis is an important complement for discovering new types of objects ."
