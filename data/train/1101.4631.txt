    "loop quantum gravity is a candidate theory for quantum gravity that attempts to quantize general relativity in a diffeomorphism invariant way .",
    "( see , for example , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and references therein . )",
    "one issue that is often cited as one that should be addressed by a theory of quantum gravity is that of the source of black hole entropy .",
    "some believe that the source of this entropy is purely gravitational in nature , and that counting the number of gravitational quantum states attributable to the black hole should yield a measure of its entropy , and should agree with the @xmath3 law at lowest order . in loop quantum gravity",
    ", the gravitational field can be described by an su(2 ) spin - network .",
    "such a network has edges and vertices , and these give rise to a quantum geometry where the vertices may be associated with volume elements and the edges with `` fluxes of area '' .",
    "this yields a natural way to associate quantum states with a black hole horizon .",
    "the spin network , when puncturing a surface , @xmath4 endows the surface with an amount of area given by the eigenvalue . the general case yields eigenvalues which are slightly more complicated than ( [ eq : aevals ] ) . ]",
    "@xmath5 where @xmath6 denotes some surface element of @xmath4 , @xmath7 is the immirzi parameter , @xmath8 denotes which puncture is under consideration , and @xmath9 can take on half - integer values which represents the spin carried by the puncture .",
    "the total area of @xmath4 is given by adding up all the area eigenvalues contributed by all of the punctures on the surface .",
    "it is very interesting that the structure of space is naturally discrete in this theory .",
    "the entropy of a black hole is then normally calculated as follows : one fixes the area of the black hole event horizon under consideration within some narrow range @xmath10 .",
    "one then counts the number of ways spin - networks may puncture the surface , and yield a total area within the allowed range .",
    "the logarithm of this number yields the entropy which , from ( [ eq : aevals ] ) , will involve the barbero - immirzi parameter @xmath7 . by setting the calculated entropy to @xmath11 ,",
    "one gets a value for @xmath7 . since @xmath7 plays a pivotal role in the theory , determining its value is of great importance .",
    "it should be noted that even with the @xmath7 ambiguity , careful calculations have shown that the entropy using this technique is indeed linearly proportional to the area of the black hole @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the degeneracy spectrum of black holes and its relation to the entropy has also recently been studied in @xcite .",
    "a calculation of the entropy in the su(2 ) formalism incorporating quantum group corrections has recently been conducted in @xcite .    from a phase - space point of view , what are known as _ isolated horizons _ have been studied in the pioneering work of @xcite and these isolated horizons have been used to study the entropy problem @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it is found that on the isolated horizon ( inner boundary ) the su(2 ) theory produces a chern - simons theory , which in turn reduces to only u(1 ) true degrees of freedom @xcite , and this has ramifications for the sub - leading correction coefficient ( for example , see @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , the last reference utilising a combinatoric approach ) . there has been some ambiguity regarding this reduction . since the original work several very interesting clarifying studies have emerged @xcite , @xcite .",
    "specifically , engle , noui and perez @xcite have studied the problem from a purely su(2 ) perspective , which more easily reveals the connection between loop quantum gravity and the boundary theory that it produces on the horizon .",
    "more details on their work is provided in @xcite . in another series of interesting papers , by basu , kaul and majumdar ,",
    "they show that the u(1 ) formulation is equivalent to the su(2 ) formulation subject to several natural constraints on the solder forms @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the authors have also previously studied the problem by analogy with the su(2 ) wess - zumino model @xcite , @xcite . as well , by studying the laws of black hole mechanics using weakly isolated horizons , the topological theory on the boundary of the black hole is a u(1 ) chern - simons theory @xcite .",
    "a u(1 ) result for spherical horizons has also been acheived by further relaxation of the horizon conditions , indicating that the u(1 ) nature is rather natural on black hole horizons @xcite .",
    "much of the work thus far has been done utilizing spherical topology ; arguably the most physically relevant .",
    "however , general relativity admits horizons with other topologies such as planar , toroidal and higher genus topologies @xcite-@xcite .",
    "although these topologies may not be as physically relevant as their spherical counter - parts , there is good reason to study them .",
    "for example , quantum gravity is an arena that has very little experimental guidance . in regard of this",
    ", one has to resort to considerations of what one _ expects _ from a theory of quantum gravity .",
    "black hole entropy and the resolution of the classical singularities may be several desireable criteria for a viable quantum theory .",
    "one also wishes the theory to be self consistent in some way .",
    "that is , it should be able to produce the correct entropy and remove the singularity for all types of black holes found in the classical theory . in this vein ,",
    "the exotic topologies have been studied in loop quantum gravity in @xcite and @xcite . in these studies",
    "the @xmath3 law was reproduced , as expected , and the sub - leading contribution was found to be genus dependent , which turns out to be in agreement with studies of higher genus black hole entropy utilizing non - loop quantum gravity techniques @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "singularities were also resolved in a mini - superspace context under similar assumptions as with spherical black holes @xcite .    in this note",
    "we wish to elaborate on the boundary structure of the higher genus horizons ( although the treatment here is general enough to also cover the @xmath12 spherical black holes as well ) , especially regarding the issue of symmetry reduction on the horizon and its relation to the sub - leading order contribution to the entropy . in section 2",
    "we briefly outline the conditions of an isolated horizon . in section 3",
    "we discuss the boundary theory in the context of black holes of various topologies , discussing the role played by the internal symmetry group .",
    "we also provide a specific calculation to elucidate the arguments . finally , we issue some concluding remarks in section 4 .",
    "we use the notation that indices @xmath13 etc . denote tetrad and su(2 ) components and",
    "span the list @xmath14 , whereas indices @xmath15 etc .",
    "denote spatial components ( not space - time , as we are explicitly using a 3 + 1 decomposition ) and span the list @xmath16 .",
    "greek indices span the full space - time .",
    "the isolated horizon framework was originally developed by ashtekar , beetle and fairhurst @xcite based on earlier works by hayward @xcite .",
    "the minimal definitions of an isolated horizon most commonly found in the literature may be summarized as follows :    a.   the isolated horizon sub - manifold , denoted by @xmath17 , is topologically @xmath18 and is null .",
    "this topological restriction can be relaxed , and many results are insensitive to topology . however , allowing the surface to have a richer topology does lead to some interesting new results @xcite , @xcite .",
    "b.   the @xmath19 sub - sector can be mapped to a null normal , denoted by @xmath20 .",
    "we will assume @xmath20 is future pointing .",
    "furthermore , on @xmath17 , @xmath20 ( and therefore any vector related to @xmath20 by a constant re - scaling ) possesses zero expansion .",
    "a second null vector on @xmath17 , @xmath21 , defined from the condition @xmath22 , has negative expansion . c.   the equations of motion on @xmath17 hold .",
    "also , the flux vector , @xmath23 , on @xmath17 is future - causal ( @xmath24 being the stress - energy tensor of any matter fields present ) .",
    "it should be stressed that these conditions are usually enforced _ only on _ @xmath17 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath17 can be `` sliced '' into preferred foliations , which we denote as @xmath25 , and which are transverse to @xmath20 . a schematic",
    "is provided in figure  [ fig : ih ]",
    ".    , may be foliated by 2-surfaces of various topologies , @xmath25 . ]",
    "general relativity also admits solutions to the field equations representing asymptotically anti - de sitter cylindrical , toroidal , and higher genus black holes .",
    "such black holes , described below , are represented by asymptotically anti - de sitter metrics with various 2-space symmetries ( spherical , flat toroidal , and higher - genus hyperbolic ) .      for studies in the ashtekar variables ,",
    "we require an ansatz for a connection , @xmath28 , as well as a densitized triad , @xmath29 , which is capable of accommodating the symmetries under study .",
    "we utilize the following for this :    @xmath30    with @xmath31 and where the functions @xmath32 and @xmath33 may be functions of the `` time '' coordinate , @xmath34 , only .",
    "this ansatz is a generalization of a modification of witten s spherically symmetric ansatz @xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that ( [ eq : hypera ] ) and ( [ eq : hypere ] ) are sufficient to yield the spherical as well as the non - rotating higher genus black holes of general relativity .",

    "such surfaces may be compact or non - compact @xcite , @xcite . + it turns out that the torus case ( @xmath43 ) is exceptional due to the fact that the pull - back of the su(2 ) connection on to the @xmath44 two - torus is constant and can be gauged to zero .",
    "this is not an issue in the higher genus cases .",
    "it should be noted that in the @xmath45 cases the coordinate @xmath46 is periodic for the construction to work .",
    "this also enforces the uniqueness of relevant quantities under large translations .",
    "we start by imposing the gauss constraint to eliminate excess gauge rotational freedom . in the system above",
    ", the gauss constraint reads : @xmath47 which in the scenarios studied here yields only one non - trivial condition : @xmath48=0\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : hypergc}\\ ] ] to satisfy ( [ eq : hypergc ] ) we set @xmath49 .",
    "this amounts only to a partial gauge fixing , eliminating redundant degrees of freedom , and therefore does not affect the physical conclusions .",
    "the field strength tensor will also be required later and may be calculated via : @xmath50 this yields ( subject to the fixed gauss constraint ) :    @xmath51    in the variables utilized here , the boundary term on @xmath17 ( often called the inner boundary to distinguish it from infinity or other horizons , such as the de sitter horizon ) that arises in varying the gravitational action with respect to the connection takes the form : @xmath52\\ , , \\label{eq : bt}\\ ] ] where @xmath53 denotes the planck length and @xmath54 is often called the ` solder form' , which can be constructed from the triad and the metric - independent levi - civita , @xmath55 .",
    "specifically , @xmath56 yields : @xmath57    now , the fact that the vector @xmath20 is null dictates that , on @xmath17 , @xmath58 , where @xmath59 denotes that the equality only must hold on @xmath17 . therefore , from ( [ eq : gensolder ] ) only the @xmath60 component of @xmath54 survives .",
    "the equations of motion dictate that @xmath61 must also vanish on @xmath17 and that only components @xmath62 are therefore non - zero on the inner boundary , indicating that the theory has a u(1 ) content .",
    "furthermore , the zero expansion condition dictates that @xmath63 must be constant valued on @xmath17 and therefore , by comparing ( [ eq : genf1 ] ) to ( [ eq : gensolder ] ) on @xmath17 , allows us to re - write ( [ eq : bt ] ) as @xmath64\\ , \\label{eq : fbt}\\ ] ] which , from ( [ eq : fdef ] ) yields : @xmath65\\ , .",
    "\\label{eq : csbt}\\ ] ] here , @xmath66 and @xmath67 are constants of proportionality related to the chern - number of the theory .",
    "note that on @xmath17 , due to the fact that @xmath61 and @xmath68 are both zero , we may write the @xmath26 connection as a u(1 ) connection ; @xmath69 , and the previous expression reduces to @xmath70 = -\\frac{k^{\\prime}}{8\\pi l_{p}}\\,\\ , \\delta \\hspace{-1mm}\\int_{\\delta}\\mbox{tr}\\left[{\\mathcal{a}_{{\\mbox{\\tiny{iii}}}}}\\sqrt{c}\\beta\\,{\\sinh\\left(\\sqrt{\\beta}\\varrho\\right)}\\right]\\ , , \\label{eq : u1bt}\\ ] ] yielding a boundary action for a u(1 ) theory .",
    "note that , as mentioned previously , the @xmath43 torus case , @xmath71 , is exceptional from the other cases and yields a trivial theory .",
    "( however , certain results , such as entropy , pertaining to higher genus black holes may be analytically extended to encompass the @xmath43 scenario @xcite . ) regarding the triviality of the @xmath43 scenario , it is possible to rule out many possibilities for the total space @xmath72 for a bundle with base @xmath73 and fiber @xmath74 , using techniques from algebraic topology .",
    "( for the necessary background for these techniques , see @xcite . )",
    "to do this , note that a bundle @xmath75 with fiber @xmath76 gives rise to a long exact sequence    @xmath77    in this case , @xmath78 and @xmath79 , which gives us    @xmath80    since @xmath81 , and @xmath82 , we find the exact sequence @xmath83 .",
    "exactness of this sequence implies that @xmath84 , which rules out , among many other things , @xmath85 ( to which @xmath86 is diffeomorphic ) .",
    "one remaining possibility is @xmath87 .",
    "we can actually get somewhat more of a handle on the structure of the possibly allowed bundles by using a slightly different point of view .",
    "@xmath74 bundles over @xmath73 are classified by the classifying space @xmath88 $ ] , which consists of homotopy classes of maps from @xmath73 to @xmath89 ( infinite - dimensional complex projective space ) .",
    "since the latter can be thought of as the eilenberg - maclane space @xmath90 , it follows that the classifying space is the second singular cohomology @xmath91 .",
    "it follows ( for instance from poincar duality ) that @xmath92 , so there exists an integer s worth of bundles with base @xmath73 and fiber @xmath74 , none of which correspond to a total space of @xmath85 .",
    "it should be noted that the above comments apply only on @xmath93 ( @xmath43 ) and they do _ not _ imply that one can not have a u(1 ) theory or su(2 ) theory on a torus , but they do indicate that one can not possess a u(1 ) theory whose total space is @xmath94 , meaning that a u(1 ) theory on @xmath95 can not come from an su(2 ) reduction .",
    "arguments similar to the above can be used to show that u(1 ) is the natural fiber over @xmath96 . as well for the sphere , one may consider the bianchi identity @xmath97 .",
    "if the wedge product terms vanish , the identity then implies that @xmath98 is exact on @xmath99 .",
    "therefore , the field - strength reduces to the abelian version on @xmath99 ( after possibly further gauge transformations ) .",
    "this of course is not necessarily true for the higher genera , and the fact that the surface obeys the horizon conditions is crucial for the reduction of the boundary action to a u(1 ) theory , as shown above .",

    "it was shown that the chern - level , @xmath137 , of the theory for higher - genus scenarios is given by @xmath138 where @xmath139 is the ( fixed ) horizon area and @xmath100 is the genus of the horizon . from ( [ eq : hordt]-d ) , the following relationship therefore holds between the field - strength and the solder forms on the horizon : @xmath140 with @xmath141 - 1\\right|\\,d\\phi$ ] , which comes from the area integral .. in the spherical case , @xmath142 .",

    "it can be seen that the above system is equivalent to a gauge - fixed u(1 ) sub - group of an su(2 ) chern - simons theory with sources .",
    "the sources can be interpreted to arise from considerations of the quantum theory , where the genus @xmath100 surface is replaced by a genus @xmath100 surface with punctures from the quantum gravitational spin - network , and the punctures act as source terms .",
    "a 2 + 1 dimensional su(2 ) chern - simons theory with source possesses an action of the form @xmath145 +   \\int_{\\delta } \\mbox{tr}\\left[j\\cdot a\\right]\\ , \\label{eq : csact}\\ ] ] where @xmath146 is a constant related to the chern level of the theory .",

    "the only non - trivial equation of motion is @xmath148 where we can identify the source term with the solder form @xmath149 from ( [ eq : fsigmarel ] ) , the other two components of the source vanishing via the conditions ( [ eq : fzero ] ) .",
    "therefore , classically , the boundary theory is indeed equivalent to a gauge - fixed ( @xmath150 ) u(1 ) chern - simons theory with u(1 ) source current @xmath151 .",
    "this is analogous to the results obtained for the @xmath99 horizons in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the difference between the @xmath99 case and the higher genus cases is the presence of non - trivial cycles on the higher genus surface , even in the absence of the punctures .",
    "this means that holonomy paths on the surface may be decomposed into a basis of holonomies along these cycles .",

    "the other half of the path traverses the shown path but in the reverse direction . ]",
    "when the punctures from the gravitational spin - network are added , the genus cycles add a non - trivial relationship amongst the topological degrees of freedom of the spin - network .",
    "namely , the following condition must be respected : @xmath155 here , @xmath156 represent cycles around the @xmath157 punctures from the spin - network whereas @xmath158 and @xmath159 represent cycles around the poloidal and toroidal paths of the genus @xmath100 surface respectively . the symplectic structure to be quantized is then of the form @xmath160\\ , , \\label{eq : symp}\\ ] ] where @xmath161 and @xmath162 are u(1)-valued forms dual to the non - trivial cycles due to the surface and the punctures , and their conjugate paths respectively .",
    "one then quantizes the symplectic structure ( [ eq : symp ] ) subject to the constraint ( [ eq : torusrelg ] ) .",
    "it is the constraint ( [ eq : torusrelg ] ) which gives rise to a genus dependent sub - leading coefficient to the entropy of the black hole @xcite . in a different context , chern - simons theories at the classical and quantum level",
    "have been studied at @xmath163 in , for example , @xcite-@xcite and references therein .",
