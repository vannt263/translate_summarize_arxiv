    "let us consider a smooth compact connected orientable surface @xmath0 , together with a smooth area form @xmath1 .",
    "any smooth closed 1-form induces a smooth area - preserving flow on @xmath0 , which is given locally by the solution of some hamiltonian equations ( see  2 for definitions ) ; it is hence called _ locally hamiltonian flow _ or _ multi - valued hamiltonian flow_.    the study of such flows was initiated by novikov @xcite , motivated by some problems in solid - state physics .",
    "orbits of locally hamiltonian flows can be seen as hyperplane sections of periodic manifolds , as pointed out by arnold @xcite , who studied the case when @xmath0 is the 2-dimensional torus @xmath2 .",
    "he proved that @xmath2 can be decomposed into finitely many regions filled with periodic trajectories and one minimal ergodic component ; in the same paper he asked whether the restriction of the flow to this ergodic component is mixing .",
    "we recall that a flow @xmath3 on a measure space @xmath4 is _ mixing _ if for any measurable sets @xmath5 we have @xmath6 i.e. , if the events @xmath7 and @xmath8 become asymptotically independent . by choosing an appropriate poincar section , the flow on this ergodic component is isomorphic to a suspension flow over a circle rotation with a roof function with asymmetric logarithmic singularities . the question posed by arnold",
    "was answered by sinai and khanin @xcite , who proved that , under a full - measure diophantine condition on the rotation angle , the flow is mixing .",
    "this condition was weakened by kochergin @xcite .",
    "the presence of singularities in the roof function is necessary , as well as the asymmetry condition : in this setting , mixing does not occur for functions of bounded variation or with symmetric logarithmic singularities , see the results by kochergin in @xcite and @xcite respectively . indeed , mixing is produced by shearing of transversal segments close to singular points , which is a result of different deceleration rates .",
    "similarly , if the genus @xmath9 of the surface @xmath0 is greater than @xmath10 , any locally hamiltonian flow can be decomposed into _ periodic components _ ,",
    "i.e.  regions filled with periodic orbits , and _ minimal components _ , namely regions which are the closure of a nonperiodic orbit , as it was shown independently by several authors , see levitt @xcite , mayer @xcite and zorich @xcite .",
    "the first return map of a poincar section on any of the minimal components is an interval exchange transformation ( iet ) , namely a piecewise orientation - preserving isometry of the interval @xmath11 $ ] ; in particular , typical ( in a measure - theoretic sense ) flows on minimal components are ergodic , since almost every iet is ergodic , due to a classical result proved by masur @xcite and veech @xcite independently .    on the other hand , mixing depends on the type of singularities of the first return time function : kochergin proved mixing for suspension flows over iets with roof functions with power - like singularities @xcite .",
    "however , this case corresponds to degenerate zeros of the 1-form defining the locally hamiltonian flow ; the complement of the set of these 1-forms is open and dense in the set of 1-forms with isolated zeros .",
    "generic flows have logarithmic singularities : in this case , if the surface @xmath0 is the closure of a single orbit , i.e.  if the flow is minimal , ulcigrai proved that _ almost every _ flow is not mixing @xcite , but weak mixing @xcite . here , we consider the measure class sometimes called _ katok fundamental class _ , described in  2 .",
    "an example of an _ exceptional _ minimal mixing flow in this setup has been constructed recently by chaika and wright @xcite , who exhibited a locally hamiltonian minimal mixing flow with simple saddles on a surface of genus 5 .    in this paper",
    "we address the question of mixing when the 1-form has isolated simple zeros and the flow is not minimal ; typically , minimal components are bounded by saddle loops homologous to zero ( see  2 for definitions ) .",
    "we prove the following result ; a more precise formulation is given in theorem [ th : mix ] .",
    "[ th:1.1 ] there exists an open and dense subset of the set of smooth closed 1-forms on @xmath0 with isolated zeros which admit at least one saddle loop homologous to zero such that almost every 1-form in it induces a mixing locally hamiltonian flow on each minimal component .",
    "moreover , we provide an estimate on the decay of correlations for a dense set of smooth functions , namely we prove the following theorem .",
    "[ th:1.2 ] let @xmath3 be the locally hamiltonian flow induced by a smooth 1-form @xmath12 as in theorem [ th:1.1 ] and let @xmath13 be a minimal component .",
    "consider the set @xmath14 of @xmath15 functions on @xmath16 with compact support in the complement of the singularities of @xmath12 .",
    "there exists @xmath17 such that for all @xmath18 with @xmath19 we have @xmath20 for some constant @xmath21 .    to the best of my knowledge ,",
    "this is the first quantitative mixing result for locally hamiltonian flows , apart from a theorem by fayad @xcite , which states that a certain class of suspension flows over irrational rotations with roof function with power - like singularities have polynomial speed of mixing .",
    "the proof of theorem [ th:1.1 ] consists of two parts : first , we describe the open and dense set of 1-forms we consider ( with a measure class defined on it ) and we show how to represent the restriction of the induced locally hamiltonian flows to any of its minimal component as a suspension flow over an interval exchange transformation with roof function with asymmetric logarithmic singularities .",
    "secondly , we show that for almost every iet , every such suspension flow is mixing by proving a version of theorem [ th:1.2 ] for suspension flows .",
    "ulcigrai @xcite treated the special case when the roof function has only one asymmetric logarithmic singularity ; in this paper , we show that her techniques can be made quantitative and applied to this more general setting .",
    "the first step of the proof is to obtain sharp estimates for the birkhoff sums of the derivative @xmath22 of the roof function @xmath23 , see theorem [ th : bs ] .",
    "these estimates are also used by kanigowski , kulaga and ulcigrai to prove mixing of all orders for such flows @xcite . in order to deduce the result on the decay of correlations ,",
    "we apply a _ bootstrap trick _ analogous to the one used by forni and ulcigrai in @xcite and an estimate on the deviation of ergodic averages for typical iets by athreya and forni  @xcite .      in  2 we recall the definition of locally hamiltonian flow induced by a smooth closed 1-form and we focus on the set of closed 1-forms with isolated zeros ; we describe some of its topological properties and we equip it with katoks measure class . in ",
    "3 we show how to represent the locally hamiltonian flows we consider as suspension flows over iets and we discuss the relation between katoks measure class and the measure on the set of iets . in ",
    "4 we recall some basic facts about the rauzy - veech induction for iets ( a renormalization algorithm which corresponds to inducing the iet to a neighbourhood of zero ) and in doing so we introduce some notation for the proof of theorem [ th : bs ] ; moreover , we state a full - measure diophantine condition for iet first used by ulcigrai in @xcite to bound the growth of the rauzy - veech cocycle matrices along a subsequence of induction times ( see theorem [ th : ulcigrai ] ) .",
    "we remark that , although in general we have more than one singularity , we do not need to induce at other points by using different renormalization algorithms , but we are able to show that the diophantine condition in @xcite can be used to treat also the case of several singularities . in  5 we state the results on the birkhoff sums of the roof function of the suspension flow and its derivative ( theorem [ th : bs ] ) , and the quantitative estimate on the speed of the decay of correlations for a dense set of smooth functions in the language of suspension flows ( theorem [ th : decayofcorr ] ) ; we also deduce theorem [ th:1.2 ] and theorem [ th : ietgoal ] from it .",
    "section 6 is devoted to the proof of theorem [ th : decayofcorr ] , which is carried out in several steps : we first define partitions of the unit interval analogous to the ones used by ulcigrai in @xcite , with explicit bounds on their size , and then we apply a bootstrap trick to reduce the problem to estimate the deviations of ergodic averages for iets , for which we apply a result by athreya and forni  @xcite . in the appendix 7",
    "we prove theorem  [ th : bs ] .",
