    "the detection and identification of the dark matter ( dm ) is a challenging goal that is currently being pursued by a large number of experiments around the world using different techniques .",
    "dm can be searched for directly ( attempting to observe its scattering off nuclei in a detector ) , indirectly ( looking for the products of its annihilation or decay ) , and in particle colliders ( which explore the nature of physics at the tev scale , the typical scale for many models of particle dm ) .",
    "such variety of strategies is sensitive to dm candidates with very different properties , allowing the exploration of a wide range of particle models . among the various possibilities , a generic weakly - interacting massive particle ( wimp )",
    "is well motivated since it predicts quite naturally a value for the dm thermal relic density that is of the same order of magnitude as the observed cold dm relic abundance .",
    "direct dm detection is currently undergoing an exciting situation , with several experimental collaborations ( using different targets and techniques ) reporting potential signals of wimp dm that have , nevertheless , not showed up in other detectors .",
    "in particular , an annual modulation in the detection rate was observed by the dama collaboration using nai(tl ) as target @xcite and was later confirmed by the extended experiment dama / libra @xcite reaching a statistical significance of 8.9@xmath15 .",
    "a new experiment , anais , projected to be carried out at the canfranc underground laboratory with up to 250 kg of nai(tl ) would test this observation in a model independent way @xcite . also , the cogent collaboration ( using a germanium target ) observed an irreducible excess in their data @xcite that , if interpreted in terms of wimps , would correspond to a very light particle , with mass in the range @xmath16  gev , and a large elastic scattering cross section , of order @xmath17  pb .",
    "furthermore , hints of an annual modulation in the cogent experiment were also claimed @xcite but with a limited statistical significance of 2.8@xmath15 in the first year data .",
    "moreover , data presented by the cresst collaboration ( which uses cawo@xmath4 as target and beta / gamma background rejection ) also displayed an excess that could be compatible with light wimps @xcite .",
    "several analyses have investigated the compatibility of these three signals @xcite , although this only seems possible if extreme assumptions are made for the different uncertainties , such as the inclusion of large quenching factors or channeling effects .",
    "these observations are challenged by the negative results obtained by other experimental collaborations .",
    "most notably ,",
    "cdms ii @xcite , xenon10 @xcite , xenon100 @xcite , simple @xcite , kims @xcite and a combination of cdms and edelweiss data @xcite have set upper bounds on the spin - independent ( si ) part of the wimp - nucleon cross section that are in strong tension with the regions of the parameter space compatible with wimp signals in the dama / libra or cogent experiments .",
    "several alternatives to ordinary wimp dm have been proposed in the literature , trying to account for this discrepancy .",
    "moreover , cdms  ii has recently searched for annual modulation in a reanalysis of their data and did not observe any indication for it @xcite .",
    "this further strengthens its incompatibility with cogent since both use the same target , leaving no room for model dependence affecting the comparison .",
    "similarly , the spin - dependent ( sd ) contribution to the wimp - nucleon cross section is also constrained from negative results in direct detection experiments .",
    "the leading constraints are due to xenon100 @xcite ( sd cross section with neutrons , @xmath18 ) and coupp @xcite , picasso @xcite , simple @xcite and kims @xcite ( sd cross section with protons , @xmath19 ) .    in the near future more sensitive experiments",
    "are going to continue probing the dm parameter space .",
    "this will allow us to clarify the current situation regarding light wimps and also explore dm candidates with smaller interaction cross sections .",
    "in particular , some of the existing experiments are involved in the upgrading of their detectors , moving towards several hundreds kilograms of target material or even reaching the 1 ton scale .",
    "this is the case of the xenon1 t @xcite and lux @xcite collaborations , with a xenon target , supercdms @xcite , using germanium , coupp , with a c@xmath1fi target , and ardm , using liquid argon @xcite . on a similar timescale",
    ", the eureca @xcite consortium has plans for a 1 ton scale experiment , able to operate different types of cryogenic detectors consisting of ge bolometers measuring heat and ionization , and cawo@xmath4 scintillating bolometers measuring heat and light , although other scintillating targets could also be accommodated .",
    "the cresst @xcite and rosebud @xcite collaborations have worked on r&d and tested other potential scintillating targets , focusing especially on targets that contain nuclei with enhanced sensitivity to sd interactions and low mass wimps . according to the characterization and performances of the different scintillating bolometers and their complementarity with ge and xe for the determination of the dm properties ,",
    "some of these materials could be incorporated as additional targets for eureca , probably in the second phase .",
    "if dm is detected , the use of different targets is crucial , as it can serve to unambiguously determine some of the wimp properties ( e.g. , its mass and interaction cross section off protons and neutrons ) , thus helping to discriminate among the various wimp candidates .",
    "this idea was applied to the case of the coupp experiment in ref.@xcite , emphasizing the relevant role of targets which are sensitive to sd wimp - nucleus interactions and showing how detection in two complementary targets ( in that case c@xmath4f@xmath20 and c@xmath1fi ) could allow a better measurement of the wimp couplings .",
    "the idea of target complementarity has later been applied to the determination of the wimp mass and cross section from different dm experiments @xcite and the relevance of targets sensitive to the sd cross section has been analytically studied in ref.@xcite .    in this paper",
    "we focus on the determination of the phenomenological parameters of a generic wimp , namely its mass , @xmath21 , the si contribution to the wimp - nucleon cross section , @xmath22 , and the sd component , @xmath23 . in doing",
    "so we take into account all known sources of uncertainties , including those in the astrophysical parameters describing the dm halo , but also considering uncertainties in the nuclear form factors along the lines of our previous analysis in ref.@xcite .",
    "we follow an approach based on bayesian statistics that allows us to incorporate these uncertainties in a consistent way , thereby quantifying their effect .    with these tools , we carry out a systematic study of the performance of various targets used in direct dm searches .",
    "we first show that 1 ton experiments based on germanium and xenon might be unable to determine some of the wimp parameters ( in particular failing to measure the sd component of the cross section ) .",
    "we also show that although c@xmath1fi is a good alternative , the complementary capability of coupp is limited by its detection technique since it does not provide information about the recoil spectrum .",
    "we then turn our attention to other possible experiments and study how their use in combination with germanium and xenon can serve to unambiguously determine @xmath21 , @xmath22 , and @xmath23 in certain scenarios , a situation that we define as _",
    "complementarity_. we concentrate on the scintillating bolometers currently used by cresst ( cawo@xmath4 ) and on those characterised by the rosebud collaboration ( al@xmath0o@xmath1 and lif ) , which contain nuclei which are sensitive to the wimp sd coupling and are also optimal for searches for low mass wimps .",
    "we show how for a certain range in the phenomenological parameter space , al@xmath0o@xmath1 and lif can provide a good complementary measurement which allows the degeneracy to be disentangled in the si and sd contributions to the total cross section .",
    "this is generally the case when the detection rate in germanium and xenon is dominated by the si component . on the other hand , cawo@xmath4 is a more convenient target when the rate in germanium or xenon is mostly sd ( since tungsten is heavier and more sensitive to the si component ) and can be used to provide a good measurement of @xmath22 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in section[sec",
    ": dd ] we summarise the physics of direct dm detection and the determination of wimp parameters from the observed number of events and energy spectrum .",
    "we describe the reconstruction method used in this work , based on bayesian statistics and show explicitly that conventional targets which are more sensitive to the si wimp - nucleus cross section ( such as xe and ge ) do not , in general , allow for a complete reconstruction of all the wimp parameters .",
    "we also show how the situation changes when a target that is sensitive to sd interactions ( using a hypothetical 1 ton version of the coupp experiment ) . in section[sec :",
    "rosebud ] we study various possible targets used in the cresst and rosebud experiments and analyse the conditions under which complementarity is achieved .",
    "the conclusions are left for section[sec : conclusions ] .",
    "we start by summarising the basic expressions that describe the wimp rate in a direct dm detection experiment @xcite ( for a recent review see ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the differential event rate for the elastic scattering of a wimp with mass @xmath21 off a nucleus with mass @xmath24 and a detector mass @xmath25 is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the local wimp density , @xmath28 is the wimp speed distribution normalized to unity and velocities are expressed in the detector reference frame .",
    "the integration over the wimp velocity is performed from the minimum wimp speed needed to induce a recoil of energy @xmath29 , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the wimp - nucleus reduced mass , to a escape velocity @xmath32 also in the detector reference frame , above which wimps are not gravitationally bound to the milky way .",
    "the wimp - nucleus differential cross section @xmath33 is computed from the lagrangian that describes the interaction of a given wimp with ordinary matter and encodes the particle physics input .",
    "the total event rate is then calculated by integrating the differential event rate over all the possible recoil energies , @xmath34 the window for wimp searches is selected from a threshold energy , @xmath35 , to a maximal recoil energy , @xmath36 , and depends on the specific experiment .",
    "the total number of dm recoils is @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the live time of the experiment . in the following",
    ", we will also refer to the exposure , defined as @xmath39 .",
    "in general , the wimp - nucleon scattering cross section can be separated into a si and a sd contribution .",
    "the total wimp - nucleus cross section is calculated by adding these coherently , using nuclear wave functions .",
    "the differential cross section thus reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the si and sd components of the wimp - nucleus cross sections at zero momentum transfer , and the form factors @xmath43 account for the coherence loss which leads to a suppression in the event rate for heavy nuclei in the si and sd contributions .",
    "see ref.@xcite for a complete description of these prescriptions .",
    "the wimp - nucleus cross section at zero momentum transfer can be written as @xcite @xmath44 ^ 2\\,,\\nonumber\\\\ { \\sigma^{sd,\\,n}_0}&= & \\frac{32\\redn^2g_f^2}{\\pi}\\,\\left[a_p s_p+ a_n s_n\\right]^2\\,\\left(\\frac{j+1}{j}\\right)\\,,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the expectation values of the total proton and neutron spin operators ; @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 , @xmath50 are the effective wimp couplings to protons and neutrons in the si and sd case , respectively ; @xmath51 is the fermi coupling constant , and @xmath52 is the total nuclear spin .. ]    in the following we will assume that @xmath53 , so that @xmath54 where @xmath22 is the wimp - nucleon si cross section and @xmath55 is the wimp - nucleon reduced mass . in the sd",
    "dependent case we can also express @xmath42 in terms of the wimp - proton and wimp - neutron cross sections as @xcite @xmath56 we will assume a specific relation between the couplings to protons and neutrons , namely @xmath57 so that only one parameter @xmath58 will be needed to describe sd interactions . ]",
    "( see section[sec : complementarity ] ) .    in this paper",
    "we follow a phenomenological approach , where no specific particle physics model for the dm is assumed . instead",
    ", the wimp is characterised simply by its mass @xmath59 , spin - independent and spin - dependent wimp - nucleon interaction cross sections , @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "if a dm signal is obtained in a direct detection experiment , the observed number of events and ( if the experiment provides it ) the energy dependence of the differential rate , i.e. , the energy spectrum , can be used to reconstruct the properties of the dm particle @xcite . in doing this",
    ", it is important to remember that expression ( [ drate ] ) is subject to uncertainties in the nuclear form factors and in the parameters describing the dm halo . determining the impact of these is crucial to understand the capability of a dm experiment to reconstruct the wimp properties . in particular ,",
    "astrophysical uncertainties are known to significantly affect the reconstruction of the mass and scattering cross section of the dm , see e.g. , refs.@xcite .",
    "similarly , uncertainties in the sd structure functions can lead to a mis - reconstruction of the wimp mass and sd scattering cross section @xcite .    for a given experimental setup ( we use the label @xmath60 to denote the target )",
    "we define an energy window for wimp searches , from a threshold , @xmath61 to a maximum energy @xmath62 .",
    "we divide that energy range into energy bins @xmath63 with a width @xmath64 .",
    "we then compute , for a choice of dm parameters , the expected number of events @xmath65 in each energy bin , by integrating eq.([drate ] ) in the corresponding interval for a given live time and adding a certain level of background events @xmath66 .",
    "the specific energy windows , bin size and background assumed can be found in appendix[sec : targets ] for the experimental set - ups considered .",
    "we consider the quantities @xmath65 as the experimental information from which we attempt to reconstruct the dm parameters .",
    "our analysis is based on the bayes theorem , which determines the posterior probability distribution function ( pdf ) @xmath67 of a set of parameters @xmath68 ( for which a prior probability is assumed @xmath69 ) from a set of experimental data @xmath70 , encoded in the likelihood function @xmath71 ( or @xmath72 ) ) , @xmath73 the evidence @xmath74 in the denominator of eq.([eqn : bayes ] ) is a function of only the experimental data . for our purposes it works as a normalization factor and can therefore be ignored .",
    "the pdf in eq.([eqn : bayes ] ) , in principle , depends on the priors @xmath69 and different choices of priors can affect the shape of the final pdf .",
    "however , should this happen , it would mean that the experimental data are not constraining enough , not being able to dominate the final probability distribution .",
    "residual prior dependence can be seen , e.g. , in refs.@xcite .",
    "the scans over the parameter space that allow us to retrieve the pdf are performed with multinest 2.9 @xcite interfaced with our own code for the computation of the number of recoil events and the likelihood .",
    "scans are performed with 20000 live points and a tolerance of 0.0001 to reach a good sampling of the profile likelihood ( see below ) as found in ref.@xcite .    in our case",
    "the experimental data consists of the predicted sets of binned wimp induced nuclear recoils for each target , @xmath75 .",
    "the parameter space is @xmath76 and our scans span the following range : @xmath77  gev , @xmath78  pb , and @xmath79  pb . logarithmic flat priors are assumed for the three variables .",
    "the parameter space is further extended with inputs describing the astrophysical and nuclear uncertainties , which are considered nuisance parameters .",
    "see appendix[app : sdsf ] for a detailed description of the parameterization of nuclear uncertainties for the different targets .",
    "astrophysical uncertainties have been included as in ref.@xcite .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all the scans in this work include both astrophysical and nuclear uncertainties .    the likelihood @xmath80 is computed for each point in the scan , computing the number of recoil events @xmath81 in the @xmath82-th bin for the experiment @xmath60 , and comparing it with the prediction of the benchmark model in the same bin , @xmath83 for the same target , assuming that data from each experiment follow independent poissonian distributions , @xmath84 notice that this is equivalent to the product of the likelihoods for each experiment @xmath85 .",
    "the number of recoil events @xmath81 in the @xmath82-th bin for each experiment is obtained by integrating eq.([drate ] ) between @xmath86 and @xmath87 , for a given live time and including a certain number of background events @xmath88 .",
    "@xmath89 indicates the number of background events in the whole energy for target @xmath60 , so that , assuming no energy dependence , @xmath88 is the predicted number of background events in each energy bin .",
    "we scan over @xmath89 , included in the scan as a nuisance parameter .",
    "we assume the number of background events @xmath89 follows a poissonian distribution function with a mean value that coincides with the nominal background level expected for the different experiments ( see appendix[sec : targets ] ) .    in the next sections ,",
    "the results of our scans will be plotted by means of two - dimensional plots .",
    "when the probability for a subset of the original @xmath68 is considered , one can account for the presence of the hidden parameters in two different ways :    * by marginalizing over them , obtaining the pdf for the @xmath90-th parameter integrating over all the others @xmath91 * by maximizing over them , obtaining the so - called profile likelihood ( pl ) @xmath92    the pl is usually more sensitive to small fine - tuned regions with large likelihood , while the integration implemented for the pdf allows to account for volume effects .",
    "thus , a parameter space characterized by a complicated likelihood function @xmath80 may result in different pdf and pl for the same parameters . in our work , to avoid the inclusion of too many figures , we will only represent the results for the pl . in the following sections , we demand closed contours in the pl 68% and 99% confidence regions ( i.e. a good reconstruction of the dm parameters ) as a requirement for complementarity . in general , when closed contours are obtained in the distribution of the pl for the dm parameters we have also observed closed contours in the pdf .",
    "the detection of wimp dm in more than one target could provide more information about the nature of this particle @xcite .",
    "first , the consistency of the energy spectra measured by experiments using different target nuclei would confirm that the events were due to wimp scattering ( rather than , for instance , neutron background )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , part of the astrophysical uncertainty can potentially be removed , and in fact the comparison of the differential rates could be used to determine the moments of the halo wimp velocity distribution @xcite .",
    "this is one of the motivations for the multitarget project eureca .",
    "the use of targets which are sensitive to both the si and sd components of the wimp - nucleus cross section might allow us to determine the wimp couplings to matter in an unambiguous way , potentially discriminating between different dm models . in ref.@xcite",
    "this idea was put to the test by studying two of the possible targets of the coupp experiment ( c@xmath1fi and c@xmath4f@xmath20 ) .",
    "these two materials are sensitive to different combinations of si and sd wimp - nucleon couplings and it was shown that this information could be used , in the case of a hypothetical detection , to discriminate the lightest supersymmetric particle ( lsp ) in the minimal supersymmetric extension of standard model ( mssm ) from the lightest kaluza - klein particle ( lkp ) in the universal extra dimension scenario .",
    "this is a direction that we explore in more detail in this work . in particular , _ we investigate how well we can reconstruct the dm properties assuming an observation in more than one direct detection experiment and define complementarity as the capability of a combination of targets to determine these properties with a certain precision_.    let us start by assuming a future detection of wimp dm in a single direct detection experiment . as explained in the former subsection , the phenomenological parameters defining the wimp dm particle can be extracted from the study of the total number of events and the differential recoil rate .",
    "however , one can easily understand that this procedure does not lead to an unique solution and the parameter space is indeed affected by degeneracies , since in general the experimental information is not enough to constrain the three unknown quantities .    to illustrate this more clearly",
    ", we note that the total number of wimp recoil events can be expressed as @xmath93 where the coefficients @xmath94 contain the integration in velocities and energies ( and a dependence on the wimp mass ) for a given exposure , @xmath95 notice that all the dependence on the astrophysical halo parameters and most of the dependence on experimental setup , such as target material , energy threshold , energy resolution , are contained in them ( there is also a dependence on the target material in @xmath45 and @xmath46 ) .",
    "as previously stated , we particularise our analysis to the specific case @xmath96 and therefore eq.([sigmadeg ] ) contains three unknown quantities : the si and sd components of the wimp scattering cross section and its mass . even if we assume that the wimp mass can be determined independently with a reasonable accuracy , we are still left with two parameters to reconstruct .",
    "thus , given only one experimental result , the same number of events can be accounted for by different combinations of si and sd couplings .",
    "this is illustrated in fig.[fig : complementarity ] , where each of the color shaded areas corresponds schematically to the region in the @xmath97 plane that is compatible with the detection of a certain number of recoils in one particular detector .",
    "the detection of a wimp in a second experiment with a different target can provide complementary information with which this degeneracy can be partially resolved , since changing target implies that also the @xmath98 coefficients in eq.([sigmadeg ] ) are different .",
    "fig.[fig : complementarity ] depicts two possible situations . on the left hand - side we consider an example in which two targets are complementary and allow a good reconstruction of both the sd and si couplings",
    "this is the case , for example , if one target is mostly sensitive to si interactions and the other one to sd ones .",
    "it can be seen that the region compatible with both experiments is closed , a situation that we call complementary . on the right hand - side",
    "we show another case in which complementarity is not present since the overlapping region is unbounded from below .",
    "this is generically the case when the two targets are mostly sensitive to the si coupling , and therefore , is a very common situation . in particular , as we will argue in section[sec : gexe ] , this could happen when combining signals from germanium and xenon detectors .",
    "notice that this example suggests that in such a case the si coupling can be relatively well reconstructed but only an upper bound can be derived for the sd one .",
    "the extension of the overlapping region is a result of the various uncertainties .",
    "first of all , there is an obvious statistical component : if the detected number of events is small , it is subject to large statistical fluctuations and therefore the reconstruction of parameters is poor .",
    "thus , the larger the exposure of the experiment ( or alternatively ,",
    "the larger the scattering cross section ) , the narrower the reconstructed band is . on top of this",
    ", astrophysical and nuclear uncertainties further contribute to worsening the reconstruction .",
    "this is clearly a limiting factor that needs a careful implementation in order to describe a realistic experimental situation .",
    "finally , in the examples above we have assumed that the mass of the wimp is known , but in the following the wimp mass is part of the parameter space we scan over and it will be determined along with the rest of the parameters .      two technologies which have been very successfully applied to direct dm searches are semiconductor cryogenic detectors ( e.g. , the germanium detectors of cdms and edelweiss ) and noble liquid detectors ( a xenon target in the case of xenon10 and xenon100 ) .",
    "both techniques show great potential and there are plans to extend target masses up to several hundred kilograms or even one ton within the next years ( e.g. , supercdms , eureca and xenon1 t ) .",
    "it is therefore conceivable that a future wimp observation could take place in any of these targets .",
    "let us therefore start by contemplating that possibility and assessing how well the dm properties can be reconstructed in germanium and xenon targets for different wimp scenarios . for concreteness",
    "we consider the energy window for wimp searches corresponding to cdms - ii in the case of germanium , xenon100 in the case of a xenon target ( see appendix[sec : targets ] ) .",
    "we consider the set of wimp benchmark points from table[tab : bm ] , which take into account various mass choices and include cases in which either the si or the sd contribution dominates the detection rate .",
    "we simulate the expected differential spectrum by considering a 1 ton experiment with a 30% live time operating for a year , i.e. a total exposure of @xmath99  kgyr .",
    "the expected dm signal is computed as described in the previous section , and implemented in the scan as experimental information , in the attempt to reconstruct the dm phenomenological parameters .",
    ".set of benchmark points used in this work .",
    "we consider three regimes for the wimp mass , very light ( vl ) , light ( l ) and medium ( m ) .",
    "the label si or sd in each benchmark indicates which component of the scattering cross section dominates the detection rate in germanium and xenon targets . for reference",
    "we also include the expected number of wimp recoil events in ge , xe and c@xmath1fi for an exposure @xmath99  kgyr , where the number in parenthesis corresponds to the contribution from only si interactions .",

    "<S> we study how the combined observation of dark matter in various direct detection experiments can be used to determine the phenomenological properties of wimp dark matter : mass , spin - dependent ( sd ) and spin - independent ( si ) scattering cross section off nucleons . a convenient choice of target materials , including nuclei that couple to dark matter particles through a significantly different ratio of sd vs si interactions , could break the degeneracies in the determination of those parameters that a single experiment can not discriminate . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we investigate different targets that can be used as scintillating bolometers and could provide complementary information to germanium and xenon detectors . we observe that al@xmath0o@xmath1 and lif bolometers could allow a good reconstruction of the dm properties over regions of the parameter space with a sd scattering cross section as small as @xmath2 pb and a si cross section as small as @xmath3  pb for a 50 gev wimp . in the case of a cawo@xmath4 bolometer </S>",
    "<S> the area in which full complementarity is obtained is smaller but we show that it can be used to determine the wimp mass and its si cross section . for each target we study the required exposure and background .    </S>",
