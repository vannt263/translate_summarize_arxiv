    "quantum coherence in the quantum hall ( qh ) system has proved to be a fascinating subject during the past decade@xcite .",
    "electron spins are spontaneously polarized even in the absence of the zeeman effect due to the exchange coulomb interaction , leading to the qh ferromagnet .",
    "a prominent characteristic is that a charged excitation is a spin texture called skyrmion@xcite .",
    "it is a coherent excitation of spins , and its excitation can be confirmed if the number of flipped spins is found to be more than that of a hole excitation@xcite .",
    "a conventional way is to measure the increase of the activation energy by tilting samples@xcite , which is roughly proportional to the number of flipped spins due to the zeeman effect .",
