    "vector fields play a prominent role in modern particle physics .",
    "we detect vector fields in laboratory and we expect them to participate actively in the physics of the early universe . as shown in literature , vector fields can contribute to generation of the observed large scale structure @xcite , background anisotropies @xcite , inflation @xcite and gravitational waves @xcite , so that , in principle , one could reconstruct standard frw cosmology without scalar fields . in order to obtain slow - roll evolution and flat power spectra of initial inhomogeneities ,",
    "vector fields need to have a time dependent mass term .",
    "it may originate from the higgs mechanism , non - canonical kinetic terms or from a non - minimal coupling to gravity .",
    "on the other hand , a study of the influence of loop quantum cosmology correction on evolution of frw universes @xcite and bianchi i models @xcite has been performed . in both cases",
    "the existence of the quantum of length changes significantly the evolution of scale factors near the planck scale , resolving the problem of the initial singularity .",
    "the big bounce model usually assumes , that the universe is filled with a homogeneous scalar field , so there is no physical argument for breaking the @xmath0 symmetry of the metric tensor . in this paper",
    "we shall analyse the lqc in the universe filled with a vector field .",
    "we start with a simple example , where the universe is dominated by a massless or a massive vector field .",
    "next , to study the influence of the vector field in more realistic set - ups we consider a case , where a vector and a scalar fields are present .",
    "they can be uncoupled , or strongly coupled .",
    "the last case corresponds in this paper to the time dependent mass term for the vector field .",
    "an interesting idea is to introduce vectors with a non - minimal coupling to gravity , however it is not known how to take into account the lqc corrections in this case .    in all of those scenarios the vector field produces anisotropic pressure , which forms a physical source for the anisotropic expansion in the bianchi i model .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to find out , whether vectors could change significantly the behaviour of scale factors close to the moment of the big bounce .    in this paper",
    "we investigate two generalisations of the isotropic lqc model .",
    "two schemes of constructing the @xmath1 functions are presented and compared .",
    "it is worth to note , that both of them give similar results . + this paper is organized as follows : in section [ sec : rozdzial1 ] we introduce the hamiltonian formalism for the metric tensor with two scale factors and we calculate the einstein s equation together with equations of motion for matter fields . in section [ sec : rozdzial2 ] we analyse the influence of the loop correction on the classical evolution of scale factors and matter fields for the case of the vector field domination . in section [ sec : rozdzial3 ] we study the universe dominated by both , vector and scalar fields in the context of lqc .",

    "the full discussion of this issue can be found in @xcite .",
    "let us consider a homogeneous , massive vector field @xcite @xmath2 , which contributes to the universe s energy density .",
    "since the vector field breaks the @xmath0 symmetry of the universe , one needs to introduce two scale factors - @xmath3 for the direction pointed by the vector and @xmath4 for transverse directions .",
    "this means , that the model is a simplified version of diagonal bianchi i. let us set the lapse function to be @xmath5 , which means , that the metric tensor is given by @xmath6 using the eq .",

    "together with ashtekar variables we shall also define the total physical volume of the fiducial cell @xmath22 .",

    "during inflation the subdominant @xmath47 is much heavier than the inflaton , so after a few e - folds it reaches its minimum and starts oscillating .",
    "the energy density of a vector field behaves matter - like , @xmath52 , and vectors are expected to be washed out during inflation . on the other hand",
    "the power spectrum of the vector field perturbation would not be flat enough to fit the cmb data .",
    "for the time of the cosmic inflation we need thus an extra tachyonic mass term @xmath53 which would allow the slow roll evolution . after the reheating the vector field",
