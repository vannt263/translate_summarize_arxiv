    "representing algebraic lattices as congruence lattices of algebras often gives rise to very hard open problems .",
    "the most well - known of those problems , the _ congruence lattice problem _ , usually abbreviated clp , asks whether every distributive algebraic lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some lattice , see the survey paper @xcite .",
    "this problem has been solved recently by the third author in  @xcite . for algebraic lattices that are not necessarily distributive",
    ", there are several deep results , one of the most remarkable , due to w.a .",
    "lampe  @xcite , stating that _ every algebraic lattice with compact unit is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some groupoid_. this result is further extended to join - complete , unit - preserving , compactness preserving maps between two algebraic lattices @xcite .",
    "although some of our methods are formally related to lampe s , for example the proof of theorem  [ t : reprtype2 ] _ via _ proposition  [ p : reprtype2 ] , we shall be concerned only about _ distributive _ algebraic lattices .",
    "this topic contains some not so well - known but also unsolved problems , as , for example , whether every distributive algebraic lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of an algebra in some _ congruence - distributive variety_.    if one drops congruence - distributivity , then one would expect the problems to become easier . consider , for example , the two following problems :    cgp is every distributive algebraic lattice isomorphic to the normal subgroup lattice of some group ?",
    "cmp is every distributive algebraic lattice isomorphic to the submodule lattice of some module ?",
    "the problem cgp was originally posed for _ finite _ distributive ( semi)lattices by e.t .",
    "schmidt as ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem  5 ) .",
    "a positive solution was provided by h.l .",
    "silcock , who proved in particular that every finite distributive lattice  @xmath1 is isomorphic to the normal subgroup lattice of some _ finite _ group  @xmath5 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "plfy proved later that  @xmath5 may be taken _ finite solvable _ ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "however , the general question seemed open until now .",
    "similarly , the statement of cmp has been communicated to the authors by jan trlifaj , and nothing seemed to be known about the general case .",
    "a common feature of the varieties of all groups and of all modules over a given ring is that they are _ congruence - permutable _ , for example , any two congruences of a group are permutable .",
    "thus both cgp and cmp are , in some sense , particular instances of the following question :    cpp ( see ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem  3 ) ) is every distributive algebraic lattice isomorphic to the congruence lattice of some algebra with permuting congruences ?",
    "although the exact formulation of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* problem  3 ) asked whether every _ arguesian _ algebraic lattice is isomorphic to the congruence lattice of an algebra with permutable congruences , it was mentioned there that even the _ distributive _ case was open . meanwhile",
    ", the arguesian case was solved negatively by m.d .",
    "haiman @xcite , however , the distributive case remained open .",
    "recall that an algebra @xmath6 has _ almost permutable congruences _",
    "( see @xcite ) , if @xmath7 , for all congruences @xmath8 , @xmath9 ( where the notation @xmath10 stands for the usual composition of relations ) .",
    "the three - element chain is an easy example of a lattice with almost permutable congruences but not with permutable congruences . on the other hand , it is not difficult to verify that _ every almost congruence - permutable variety of algebras is congruence - permutable_. the last two authors of the present paper obtained in @xcite negative congruence representation results of distributive semilattices by _ lattices _ with almost permutable congruences , but nothing was said there about arbitrary _",
    "algebras _ with permutable congruences . furthermore",
    ", our attempts based on the `` uniform refinement properties '' introduced in that paper failed , as these properties turned out to be quite lattice - specific .    in the present paper , we introduce a general framework that makes it possible to extend the methods of @xcite to arbitrary algebras , and thus solving cpp  and , in fact , its generalization to algebras with almost permutable congruences  negatively .",
    "hence , both cgp and cmp also have negative solutions .",
    "in fact , the negative solution obtained in cgp for _ groups _ extends to _ loops _ , as the variety of all loops is also congruence - permutable .",
    "another byproduct is that we also get a negative solution for the corresponding problem for _ lattice - ordered groups _ , see also problem  [ pb : lgroups ] .",
    "our counterexample is the same as in  @xcite and in  @xcite , namely the congruence lattice of a free lattice with at least @xmath2 generators in any non - distributive variety of lattices .",
    "we also show that the size @xmath2 is optimal , by showing that _ every distributive algebraic lattice with at most  @xmath0 compact elements is isomorphic to the submodule lattice of some module , and also to the normal subgroup lattice of some locally finite group _ , see theorems  [ t : submal1 ] and  [ t : al1grprepr ] .",
    "we also prove that _ every distributive algebraic lattice with at most countably many compact elements is isomorphic to the @xmath11-ideal lattice of some lattice - ordered group _ , see theorem  [ t : reprlgroups ] .    in order to reach our negative results ,",
    "the main ideas are the following .",
    "* forget about the algebraic structure , just keep the partition lattice representation .",
    "* state a weaker `` uniform refinement property '' that settles the negative result .    for point  ( 1 )",
    ", we are looking for a very special sort of lattice homomorphism of a given lattice into some partition lattice , namely , the sort that is induced , as in proposition  [ p : dist2part ] , by a _",
    "semilattice - valued distance _ , see definition  [ d : vdist ] . for a @xmath4-semilattice",
    "@xmath12 and a set @xmath13 , an  @xmath12-valued distance on @xmath13 is a map @xmath14 satisfying the three usual statements characterizing distances ( see definition  [ d : vdist ] ) .",
    "every such @xmath15 induces a map @xmath16 from @xmath12 to the partition lattice of @xmath13 ( see proposition  [ p : dist2part ] ) , and if @xmath15 satisfies the so - called _ v - condition _ , then @xmath16 is a join - homomorphism",
    ". furthermore , the v - condition of type  @xmath17 says that the equivalences in the range of  @xmath16 are pairwise @xmath18-permutable .",
    "those `` distances '' have been introduced by b. jnsson for providing a simple proof of whitman s theorem that every lattice can be embedded into some partition lattice , see @xcite or theorems  iv.4.4 and  iv.4.8 in  @xcite .    while it is difficult to find a suitable notion of morphism between partition lattices , it is easy to do such a thing with our distances , see definition  [ d : vdist ] .",
    "this makes it possible to define what it means for a commutative diagram of @xmath4-semilattices to have a lifting , modulo the forgetful functor , by distances . in particular , we prove , in theorem  [ t : nolifttyp1 ] , that the cube @xmath19 considered in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section  7 ) does not have a lifting by any diagram of v - distances `` of type  @xmath3 '' , that is , the equivalences in the ranges of the corresponding partition lattice representations can not all be almost permutable .",
    "this result had been obtained only for lattices in  @xcite .",
    "the original proof of theorem  [ t : nolifttyp1 ] was our main inspiration for getting a weaker `` uniform refinement property '' , that we denote here by @xmath20 ( see definition  [ d : vwurpe ] ) .",
    "first , we prove that if @xmath14 is an  @xmath12-valued v - distance of type  @xmath3 with range generating @xmath12 , then  @xmath12 satisfies @xmath20 ( see theorem  [ t : type152wurp ] ) .",
    "next , we prove that for any free lattice  @xmath21 with at least  @xmath2 generators in any non - distributive variety of lattices , the compact congruence semilattice @xmath22 does not satisfy @xmath20 ( see corollary  [ c : freenon2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 is not isomorphic to @xmath24 , for any algebra  @xmath6 with almost permutable congruences ( see corollary  [ c : freenon ] ) .    on the positive side , we explain why all previous attempts at finding similar negative results for representations of type  @xmath25 ( and above ) failed .",
    "we prove , in particular , that _ for every distributive @xmath4-semilattice@xmath12 , there exists a surjective v - distance @xmath26 of type  @xmath25 , which , moreover , depends functorially on  @xmath12 _ ( see theorem  [ t : reprtype2 ] ) .",
    "in particular , the diagram @xmath27 considered in @xcite , which is not liftable , with respect to the congruence lattice functor , in any variety whose congruence lattices satisfy a nontrivial identity , is nevertheless liftable by v - distances of type  @xmath25 .",
