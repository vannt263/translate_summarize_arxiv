    "in the early evolution of substellar objects , the formation of brown dwarfs in molecular clouds is of particular interest ; several formation mechanisms have been proposed ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "one possibility is the same mechanism as low - mass stars , but with much smaller cores ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the l1014 dense core is a potential site for such a process .",
    "l1014 was previously thought to be starless because it lacks iras point sources @xcite .",
    "@xcite discovered a very faint infrared source ( l1014-irs ) toward the center of l1014 with the spitzer space telescope .",
    "recent detections of a molecular outflow and a reflection nebula revealed that this central object is really embedded within the cloud core and is not a background source associated with the perseus arm at 2.6 kpc @xcite .",
    "assuming the distance of l1014 is @xmath3 200 pc , as adopted in recent literature , this embedded source becomes an ideal candidate for a very low mass protostar , i.e. , a proto - brown dwarf .",
    "however , the mass estimate of a protostellar object depends on its adopted distance .",
    "it is , in general , not easy to determine the distance to the surrounding dark cloud , particularly that of a small , nearby dense core as its small size implies a small number of background / foreground stars .",
    "in fact , the assumption that l1014 is 200 pc away seems to originate from the distance estimate of b362 , which is located @xmath4 north of l1014 , but this estimate is based upon the similarity of @xmath5 @xcite to that of nearby clouds with a kinematic distance @xmath3 100200 pc @xcite .",
    "the l1014 dense core is thought to be a site of very recent ( @xmath6 1 myr ) star formation .",
    "we interpret the slightly extinct region extending southwest of l1014 in the dss - ii red image as thinner molecular gas extending from the dense core .",
    "in fact , co observations @xcite showed the existence of molecular material in this region .",
    "we suspected that the thin molecular gas and the dense core are remnants of previous low - mass star formation over the past few myr .",
    "if so , pre - main - sequence stars , i.e. , t tauri stars , could be detected toward l1014 and the validity of the distance estimate of l1014 can be examined with the color - magnitude diagram by using theoretical isochrones of pre - main - sequence stars .    in order to substantiate the presence of previous star formation , we surveyed h@xmath1 emission line stars by slit - less spectroscopy around this remarkable core . slit spectroscopy and @xmath0 photometry",
    "were then performed on the selected stars . in this letter , we present our spectroscopic results and discuss whether the detected h@xmath1 emission line stars are t tauri stars associated with the l1014 core .",
    "we also discuss the distance to l1014 .",
    "slit - less grism spectroscopy and @xmath0 photometry of l1014 were made with the wide field grism spectrograph 2 ( wfgs2 ; @xcite ) mounted on the university of hawaii ( uh ) 2.2-m telescope on 2004 november 13 ut .",
    "the detector used was a tektronix 2048@xmath72048 ccd .",
    "the field of view is 11@xmath85 with a pixel scale of 0@xmath934 pixel@xmath10 . for the slit - less spectroscopy",
    ", we took three 300 s exposures dithered by @xmath3 20@xmath11 with a wide h@xmath1 filter ( fwhm = 50 nm ) and a 300 line mm@xmath10 grism . for the @xmath0 photometry",
    ", we took one 2 s exposure and three 10 s exposures dithered by @xmath12 for each band .",
    "for the photometric calibration the sdss standard star bd + 25@xmath134655@xcite was observed nearly at the same airmass as target ( difference @xmath14 0.16 ) .",
    "twilight images were also taken for the flat - fielding .",
    "the limiting magnitudes were @xmath15 @xmath3 20.9 , @xmath16 @xmath3 20.6 , and @xmath17 @xmath3 20.0 for 10 @xmath18 detections .",
    "we extracted about 2000 spectra from the slit - less spectroscopy image and examined them for the presence of h@xmath1 emission . as a result",
    ", we found three h@xmath1 emission line stars ( figure  [ fig1 ] ) . from the measurements of equivalent widths ( ews )",
    ", we identified one candidate ( star-1 ) as weak - line t tauri star ( wtts ) and two candidates ( star-2 and 3 ) as classical t tauri stars ( ctts ) .",
    "star-1 and 2 were previously reported as h@xmath1 emission line stars toward b362 , but their ews were not measured @xcite .",

    "for stars whose colors are between m0 and m5 , we adopted a color transformation estimated from a comparison between our @xmath0 photometry of ngc 2264 and the @xmath26 photometry of @xcite .    to classify the spectral types of the t tauri star candidates , we performed slit spectroscopy using wfgs2 during 2005 november 2528 ut . we obtained low - dispersion spectra of star-1 and 2 with a 300 line mm@xmath10 grism and a 0@xmath97 slit .",
    "the spectra covered 426810 nm with a resolving power of @xmath27 820 at 650 nm .",
    "the total integration times were 2350 s for star-1 and 1200 s for star-2 .",
    "we also obtained a higher - dispersion spectrum of star-2 using a volume - phase holographic ( vph ) grism @xcite and a 0@xmath97 slit . the vph grism spectrum covered 586742 nm with a resolving power of @xmath27 4200 at 664 nm .",
    "the total integration time was 2940 s.    we classified the stars by comparing the spectra with the spectral atlas of @xcite after normalizing each observed spectrum by fitting the continuum with a spline function .",
    "the features of the absorption lines in the low - dispersion spectra of star-1 and 2 are almost identical , closely resembling a k3v spectrum ( figure  [ fig2 ] )",
    ". however the h@xmath1 emission line intensities differ .",
    "in addition , three absorption lines of cah ( 6346 , 6382 , and 6389  ) , which are features of mid k through m type stars , are seen in the higher - dispersion spectrum of star-2 ( figure  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "furthermore , a low - dispersion spectrum over 420700 nm of star-1 was obtained with the 65-cm telescope of the gunma astronomical observatory on 2005 december 21 ut , and it is consistent with the spectrum of reddened k2v to k4v star with a visual extinction of @xmath3 0.81.5 mag .",
    "thus , we classified both star-1 and 2 as k3 type .",
    "the error of classification is one or two in the subclass .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig2.eps    ( 80mm,80mm)fig3.eps",
    "we detected three h@xmath1 emission line stars near the small dense core .",
    "these emission line stars are likely to be t tauri stars because of their proximity to the molecular cloud .",
    "however , some other possibilities , including those noted by @xcite , should also be considered :    * classical be stars , * herbig ae / be stars , * dme stars ( ew @xmath6 10  , late k through m types ) , * chromospherically active giants , and * rs cvn binaries , cataclysmic variables and symbiotic variables ( ew @xmath28 10  ) .    for star-1 , possibilities 1)3 ) are eliminated because the classified spectral type is not b or a and is earlier than late k types .",
    "possibility 5 ) is unlikely because such stars usually have an h@xmath1 emission line ew larger than 10  .",
    "given star-1 s observed @xmath2 color of 1.56 mag , and assuming an intrinsic color @xmath3 1.05 mag from the color of a k3v star in the @xmath25 system described in  2 , we obtain a color excess of @xmath3 0.51 mag .",
    "we estimate the visual extinction of star-1 to be @xmath3 0.88 from this color excess and @xmath29 @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the total extinction of the cloud toward star-1 is about 23 mag from the c@xmath30o and visual extinction maps of @xcite .",
    "therefore , star-1 is probably embedded in the l1014 core envelope , eliminating possibility 4 ) .",
    "we examined the spitzer archival data of l1014 , obtained by the c2d legacy program @xcite .",
    "we identified star-1 with object sstc2d j212358.5 + 495809 .",
    "its fluxes at 3.6 , 4.5 , 5.8 , 8.0 and 24.0 @xmath31 are 11.2 @xmath23 0.473 , 9.97 @xmath23 0.121 , 6.89 @xmath23 0.258 , 4.23 @xmath23 0.0379 , and 1.42 @xmath23 0.0759 mjy , respectively .",
    "these fluxes give irac colors of [ 3.6]@xmath32[4.5 ] @xmath3 0.36 and [ 5.8]@xmath32[8.0 ] @xmath3 0.11 , placing it outside the class ii region on the irac color - color diagram ( see figure 4 of @xcite ) .",
    "these colors and the detection at 24.0 @xmath31 support that star-1 is wtts with a thin disk or a disk having a large inner hole .",
    "many stars are detected in optical wavelengths as can be seen in figure  [ fig1 ] , but only a small number , including l1014-irs , are detected on the 24.0 @xmath31 image , suggesting a probable association of circumstellar material with them .    for star-2 , possibilities 1)3 )",
    "are eliminated for the same reasons as star-1 .",
    "star-2 s observed color is almost the same as that expected from its spectral type , whereas the c@xmath30o map @xcite gives an extinction of @xmath3 0.5 mag at its location .",
    "we conclude that star-2 is located on the outskirts of the core , eliminating possibilities 4 ) and 5 ) .",
    "star-2 is outside the spitzer irac images and is not cataloged , but it is detected at the edge of the 24.0 @xmath31 image and its 24.0 @xmath31 flux is larger than that of star-1 .",
    "this also suggests that star-2 is ctts .",
    "since star-3 s ew is larger than 10  , it is unlikely to be 3 ) .",
    "although the extinction of star-3 is unclear because its spectral type is unknown , the upper limit of extinction can be estimated to be @xmath3 1.3 mag from the @xmath33 map of @xcite . even if the upper limit is adopted for the extinction ,",
    "the color of star-3 is still red ( late k type ) relative to a or b type stars .",
    "therefore , star-3 can not be 1 ) or 2 ) .",
    "we note that the lower limit of cloud extinction toward star-3 can be estimated to be @xmath3 0.1 mag from the @xmath34co map of @xcite .",
    "possibilities 4 ) and 5 ) remain , however these types of stars are extremely rare .",
    "for example , @xcite classified only a few candidates for rs cvn binaries out of a @xmath3 300 square degree area in the south of the taurus molecular clouds based on their x - ray and optical studies .",
    "the co and @xmath33 maps have relatively low spatial resolution , and provide average extinctions toward these stars .",
    "it would be possible that the cloud is clumpy , and that these stars are located toward a part of the cloud which is slightly thinner than the average .",
    "however , the reverse would be also possible .",
    "moreover , no major molecular clouds are identified between l1014 and the perseus arm @xcite .",
    "thus their association with l1014 is very likely since t tauri stars are usually found near molecular clouds , and most of the co emission probably comes from the l1014 region , although it is difficult to definitely eliminate the possibility that they are background sources .",
    "we constructed the color - magnitude diagram ( @xmath17 vs. @xmath2 ) for l1014 to estimate ages and masses of the t tauri star candidates .",
    "although it is not yet clear whether star-3 is associated with the l1014 core or not , here we assume that all the three stars are associated with the cloud .",
    "we adopted the isochrones and the evolutionary tracks of @xcite .",
    "first , we assumed a distance of 200 pc for l1014 @xcite to construct the color - magnitude diagram ( figure  [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the diagram indicates ages of about 100 myr .",
    "this is not consistent with the typical age , @xmath14 10 myr , of t tauri stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "thus , our observations are incompatible with a distance of 200 pc .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig4.eps    second , we assumed a distance of 400 pc for l1014 , as suspected by @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig5 ] shows the color - magnitude diagram for this distance and indicates that the stars ages lie between @xmath3 5 myr and 10 myr .",
    "this is consistent with the typical age of @xmath14 10 myr .",
    "since these stars are not embedded in the dense core but located toward the envelope or more outer region , they could not be so young and probably have ages of @xmath35 1 myr .",
    "thus @xmath3 110 myr is plausible as their age range . adopting this range",
    ", @xmath3 400900 pc seems to be more reasonable than 200 pc .",
    "( 80mm,80mm)fig5.eps    using the color - magnitude diagram at a distance of @xmath3400900 pc and applying an extinction correction for each star , we estimate masses of @xmath3 1.21.8 @xmath36 , @xmath3 1.21.8 @xmath36 , and 0.30.5 @xmath36 for star-1 , 2 , and 3 , respectively",
    ". extinctions of 0.88 and 0.11.3 were adopted for star-1 and 3 , and no extinction was assumed for star-2 .",
    "the locations of the three stars in the color - magnitude diagram suggest that these stars have almost the same age .",
    "this suggests that star-3 is at the same distance as the other two associated with the l1014 cloud and that it might also be associated with the cloud .",
    "we identified three t tauri stars toward the l1014 core by slit - less spectroscopy , @xmath0 photometry and slit spectroscopy .",
    "one of them is a wtts and the others are ctts .",
    "the estimation of the extinction and the ages of t tauri stars suggests that they are associated with l1014 .",
    "this indicates that star formation took place previously in l1014 s progenitor cloud .",
    "an examination of the color - magnitude diagram suggests that the distance to l1014 is @xmath3 400900 pc .",
