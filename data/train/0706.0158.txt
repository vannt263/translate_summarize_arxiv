    "the charmonium singlet states have resisted a firm identification for many years @xcite , but , now the @xmath2 , @xmath3 and @xmath4 are well identified .",
    "the mass of the latter , as given by the cleoc collaboration is @xcite @xmath5 , where the first uncertainty comes from statistics and the second one from estimated systematic errors . for the previous attempts and other measurements , see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "it is perfectly legitimate to _ define _ the hyperfine splitting by @xmath6 .",
    "this leads to the experimental value @xcite @xmath7  . but a superficial reading of @xmath8 could be misleading , as it suggests a very small or even vanishing effect of spin  spin forces in the 1p multiplet , while it is arguably larger , and positive , of the order of a few mev .    in the potential models ,",
    "if the spin - orbit , @xmath9 and tensor , @xmath10 terms are treated in perturbation , the masses of triplet p - states with @xmath11 , @xmath12 and @xmath13 are shifted by @xmath14 and @xmath15 , respectively , and it is readily seen that the contributions of @xmath16 and @xmath17 disappear in the @xmath18-weighted centre of gravity .",
    "now the @xmath19 splitting is of the order of 150mev , suggesting that at the level of 1mev accuracy , the calculation of the spin splittings should be pushed beyond first order . as the spin operators @xmath20 and",
    "@xmath21 enter the hamiltonian linearly , the ground state of the spin - triplet p - state is a concave function of the values of these operators .",
    "this means that in any potential model where the components @xmath22 and @xmath23 are suitably regularised and inserted non - pertubatively into the wave equation , the genuine spin - orbit- and tensor - free triplet state is _ above _ the naive centre of gravity . as an example , if one adopts the potential of ref .",
    "@xcite , which is rather conventional in the heavy - quark sector ( the light - quark one is more speculative , with goldstone - boson exchanges ) , the difference is about 3mev , which locates the experimental @xmath4 about 4mev above this improved triplet benchmark .",
    "unfortunately , the convexity effect depends rather sensitively on the details of the regularisation of the spin - orbit and tensor terms , and many other effects have to be taken into account , for instance , the p  f orbital mixing , which pushes down the @xmath24 state .",
    "phenomenological potentials could also include further spin operators that are not necessary in the simplest non - relativistic reduction of one - gluon exchange , or in the thomas precession , and , for spin triplet , can not be reduced to spin  orbit and tensor and thus do not average out to zero in the naive centre of gravity .",
    "an example is the `` quadratic spin  orbit '' operator used in nuclear physics to describe the nucleon  nucleon potential .    on the theoretical side",
    ", the zero - range property of the spin - spin interaction , @xmath25 only holds in the simplest non - relativistic reduction  la breit  fermi of the coulomb term due to one - gluon - exchange . a range of about the inverse quark mass would be reasonable , and would give a non - vanishing matrix element for p - states .",
    "higher - order terms in perturbative qcd have been discussed in the literature , see , e.g.,@xcite and refs .  there .",
    "the spin  spin potential has also been estimated non - perturbatively with the lattice techniques @xcite , exhibiting a range that is short but finite . in some other lattice studies",
    "@xcite , the states @xmath26 and @xmath4 are calculated directly ( not  la born  oppenheimer through a potential ) , each with a specific operator adapted to its quantum numbers , as in qcd sum rules @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the mass of the @xmath27 also reveals the limits of simple potentials .",
    "the splitting @xmath28 , is appreciably smaller than the predicted one in most @xmath29 constituent models tuned to reproduce @xmath30mev .",
    "a likely explanation is that for this 2s multiplet lying very close to the @xmath31 threshold , the coupling to higher fock configurations is enhanced .",
    "the @xmath32 is pushed down by the very close @xmath31 threshold , while @xmath27 is less affected , since only influenced by the higher lying @xmath33 and @xmath34 thresholds .",
    "this reduces the effect of the quark ",
    "antiquark spin  spin forces @xcite .    hopefully , the @xmath35 will be found shortly .",
    "its mass can be estimated with sophisticated techniques . if one accounts for the @xmath36 factor in front of the spin - spin interaction , and the squeezing of wave - functions when the constituent masses increase , which for a logarithmic potential gives a factor @xmath37 for the squared wave function at the origin , one gets @xmath38 in ratio @xmath39 to its charm analogue , i.e. , about 68mev .",
    "a few years ago , several new results came in the meson sector with single charm , in particular the @xmath40 states , and this stimulated an intense activity . more recently , several new baryons have been found , and nowadays , the family of charmed baryons include many states @xcite .",
    "a key question in baryon spectroscopy is to find evidence for the three - body structure , i.e. , states in which both @xmath41 and @xmath42 degrees of freedom are excited . in the harmonic - oscillator of light quarks , with flavour su(3 ) symmery , this corresponds to the @xmath43 multiplet , with an antisymmetric orbital wave - function @xmath44 $ ] that couples to an antisymmetric spin ",
    "isospin wave function and an antisymmetric colour wave function .",
    "the lack of firm experimental candidate is perhaps due to the small cross - sections in pion- or photo - production experiments , which favour states having better overlap with the quark wave function of the target nucleon .",
    "another picture is proposed by diquark models , in which these states do not exist , if the diquark is in its ground state .",
    "perhaps the first baryon with excitation in both jacobi variables will be found in the charm sector : this state is expected to be rather narrow and to have preferentially at least one orbital excitation in its decay products .    among ordinary hadrons ,",
    "the @xmath45 baryons with two heavy quarks are particularly interesting , as they combine the adiabatic motion of two heavy quarks , as in charmonium , and the relativistic motion of a light quark around a coloured source , as in @xmath46 mesons .",
    "the ground state has interesting weak - decay properties.there are huge differences among the lifetimes of @xmath46 , @xmath47 mesons and single - charm baryons .",
    "the hierarchy of the lifetimes is well understood in terms of @xmath48-exchange , or interference effects , but the differences are usually larger than estimated in calculations . in the case of hadrons with two heavy quarks , binding effects also play a role .",
    "selex has serious candidates for the ground states , and more fragile evidence for the isospin partner , spin or orbital excitations @xcite .",
    "however , other experiments were not able to find any double - charm baryons , in particular in @xmath49 @xcite .",
    "this is a little surprising , because meanwhile the b - factories found an excess ( vs.  simple qcd expectations ) of double charm - pair production , @xmath50 , leading to beautiful @xmath29 spectra recoiling against the j/@xmath51 .",
    "one would naively expect that if a @xmath52 primary system is easily produced , it sometimes rearranges into a doubly - charm diquark and a conjugate antidiquark .",
    "when the first studies of double - charm baryons were carried out , their experimental study was out of reach .",
    "now , with the @xmath53 well measured , and the first indication for @xmath54 , the sector of two heavy flavours seems ready for detailed spectroscopy , and one could already envisage one step beyond , i.e. , triple charm . the spectrum of @xmath55 was called @xcite `` the ultimate goal of baryon spectroscopy '' , the true analogue of charmonium for baryons . here",
    "the three - quark dynamics can be tested in the static limit and confronted with theory .",
    "for instance , the level order is expected to be similar to that of charmonium , with the first excitation having a parity opposite to that of the ground - state .",
    "remember that for light baryons , the roper resonance , with the same positive parity as the ground - state nucleon , comes slightly lower than the first orbital excitations , and this can not be accommodated in simple quark models .",
    "several intriguing states have been identified in the hidden - charm sector , that are hardly compatible with genuine @xmath29 states . the experimental situation concerning the @xmath56 , the various @xmath0 s near 3940 , the @xmath57 , etc .",
    ", is reviewed in several contributions to this conference @xcite .",
    "the most popular explanation of @xmath56 is that of a @xmath58 molecule , see , e.g. , @xcite and refs .",
    "there on the pioneering works by voloshin et al . ,",
    "trnqvist , glashow et al . , ericson and karl , manohar et al . , braaten et al .",
    "nuclear forces acting between charmed mesons generate a nuclear potential which is weaker that the proton  neutron spin - triplet interaction , but being experienced by heavier particles , it gives comparable spectral properties , at the edge between binding and non - binding .",
    "interesting developments have been proposed , in particular bound sates of two or several charmed or doubly - charmed baryons @xcite .",
    "also , as the @xmath46 and the @xmath59 are not strictly bound in this approach , but slightly above their threshold , one could envisage the borromean binding of three or more heavy mesons .",
    "there are , however , some caution in order . as stressed by suzuki @xcite , due to the @xmath60 mass difference , the yukawa potential in @xmath58 is non local , and this might weaken its efficiency .",
    "also , the miracle in nuclear physics is the presence of a hard core , which prevents the nucleons from collapse and reinforces the role of long - range dynamics . there is no such hard core in @xmath58 , and one should account for the direct interaction between the quarks of @xmath46 and these of @xmath59 .",
    "this leads us to the alternative four - quark models .    among these models",
    ", there is the diquark  antidiquark picture , as developed in particular by maiani et al .",
    "@xcite , giving an unified picture of several new states .",
    "notice that the diquark is an effective cluster , an approximation valid only in a given environment .",
    "if taken too seriously , some of the diquark models of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , with a relatively low mass for the diquarks , could lead to predict the existence of stable triple - charm dibaryons , such as @xmath61 , below the @xmath62 threshold .",
    "the four - quark dynamics , and its application to @xmath56 , is also discussed by lipkin and hgaasen et al .",
    "@xcite , among others .",
    "the chromomagnetic interaction , with a realistic treatment of flavour - symmetry breaking gives a simple explanation of the mass and decay properties of @xmath56 @xcite .",
    "now , a lesson from atomic physics , is that the best place for stable four - body states is not @xmath63 , which is slightly stable for @xmath64 , but loses stability for @xmath65 @xcite .",
    "however , the configurations @xmath66 are more stable that these with equal masses @xcite .",
    "the crucial rule is that the coulomb interaction remains unchanged when the masses evolve from electron to muon or heavier constituents . in qcd",
    ", we have the same property , called _ flavour independence _ , for the spin - independent interaction .",
    "this is why states of the type @xmath67 are predicted to exist @xcite , at least in the limit of large @xmath68 mass ratio .",
    "their production and identification could be carried out in the experiments searching for the double - charm baryons .",
    "a good surprise of recent high - energy experiments has been the ability of performing productively in hadron physics , and even to clarify the results claimed by dedicated low - energy experiments .",
    "another good surprise is the ability to produce fragile and complex structures , such as antideuterium @xcite , bound only by 2mev .",
    "it is reasonable to anticipate significant progress on heavy hadrons , in particular exotic multiquarks , from the future lhc experiments , provided a small fraction of the analysis is devoted to this physics .",
