    "a preliminary question is in order , however : can this formal program be carried if particle number is conserved in the mean only , as occurs with lagrange multiplier techniques ? according to @xcite , the chemical potential , as a function of a continuous particle number , shows derivative discontinuities .",

    "now we shall mix several slater determinants , each made of @xmath281 harmonic oscillator , one dimensional orbitals taken from @xmath282 the hamiltonian is a complete one , @xmath283   - v_a \\sum_{i > j=1}^4   \\left[\\delta(r_i - r_j - r_a)+\\delta(r_i - r_j+r_a)\\right ] .\\ ] ] this contact , finite range attraction between particles is expected to create a reasonable amount of correlations and was chosen to allow an easy precalculation and tabulation of matrix elements of @xmath284 such matrix elements are again understood to be antisymmetrized .    the first slater determinant , @xmath285 in the mixture contains the lowest @xmath26 orbitals of the harmonic oscillator .",
    "it is expected to make the dominant component of the configuration mixture @xmath5 as we shall keep @xmath286 @xmath287 within the grid seen in fig . 1 , and also the strength @xmath288 moderate .",
    "let @xmath289 and @xmath290 @xmath291 be the orbitals of two slater determinants @xmath292 and @xmath293 respectively . define the cofactors @xmath294 and double cofactors @xmath295 of the determinant of scalar products @xmath296 such cofactors are very simple in the present orthogonal basis of orbitals , obviously .",
    "then the matrix elements needed for the hamiltonian matrix and the calculation of the hk functional read , @xmath297    with @xmath298 and @xmath299 the grids shown by figures 7 and 8 come from a calculation with a single particle basis made of the first 10 harmonic oscillator orbitals and a corresponding slater basis of 61 states made of @xmath300 and all positive parity one - particle - one - hole and two - particle - two - hole determinants built upon @xmath301 because of @xmath108 the centers of the density grids are not at the origin defined by @xmath285 obviously .",
    "indeed , for @xmath302 this calculation gives @xmath303 as the coordinates of the ground state density shift @xmath304 and the ground state energy is @xmath305 significantly down from @xmath306    had we taken as the origin in density space the density of the hf solution for @xmath203 different drifts of grid centers would have been observed .",
    "such new drifts are likely to make better signals of true correlations in @xmath67 for the sake of comparison between the first and the second toy models we kept @xmath307 as a reference , but we have a direct access to the amount of true correlations : it is easy here to calculate the density _ matrix _ @xmath308 the diagonal of which gives @xmath101 here , for @xmath203 the trace of @xmath309 is of order 5% , a reasonable amount . at that grid corner ,",
    "@xmath310 the trace even reaches 8% .",
    "it can be concluded that this second toy model does create correlations .",
    "while @xmath263 and @xmath274 both vary by @xmath311 across their grid and @xmath312 can be neglected , the variation of @xmath313 and @xmath314 across the grid is of order @xmath315 which is not so small .",
    "for the sake of comparison with fig .",
    "4 we now show in figure 9 a plot of the hk functional in terms of @xmath316 again , but it will not be not forgotten in our agenda to find those two orthonormal combinations @xmath317 of @xmath318 @xmath319 @xmath313 and @xmath314 which allow the `` flattest '' projection of the grid .",
    "it is clear that , in the spirit of eqs .",
    "( [ fapp ] ) and ( [ numfapp ] ) , the best parametrization of @xmath9 should now be in terms of @xmath320 in any case , from fig .",
    "9 , the minimum of @xmath9 occurs at @xmath321 the grid center , as should be .",
    "9 also shows deviations from a paraboloid clearly stronger than those of fig .",
    "particle number conservation is essential to that key element in the proof of the hk theorem , the one - to - one correspondence between density and external potential .",
    "however , variations of the potential should not be trivial : they should differ from constants .",
    "we treated both constraints of i ) matter conservation and ii ) non triviality of potential variations on the same footing : a vanishing average for both the potential and the density variations .",
    "this constraint of vanishing average was implemented by means of a new family of orthogonal polynomials ; hence appeared a set of modes in both the density and the potential spaces .",
    "we proved , numerically with toy models , that such modes might have a physical meaning , on two counts , i ) converse linear responses @xmath82 @xmath322 might be reasonably simple when described in terms of such modes , and ii ) the hk functional itself might be practically truncated into projections into subspaces spanned by a few modes .",
    "we have not discussed in this paper the constraints of positivity of the density , but it is clear that , within an algebra of polynomials such as ours , positivity conditions are not too difficult to implement .",
    "we have not discussed either more subtle constraints related to the sobolev nature of the topological spaces available for densities . for this question ,",
    "we refer to @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it can be stressed again that the compatibility of truncations of densities into a finite number of `` polynomial modes '' with such fine constraints can easily be tested .",
    "an ultimate goal would be to create a constructive theory of the hk functional .",
    "the functional differential equation , @xmath323,$ ] can not be integrated in the density space as long as @xmath324 $ ] is not known accurately enough .",
    "because of our detour through many - body perturbation theories we are clearly far from the goal , but this work gives a frame in which the task should become easier .",
    "the detour might allow a compression of the needed information through , for instance , the parametrization of a limited set of matrix elements of our matrices @xmath59 for mean field approximations or @xmath325 in the correlated cases .",
    "our main results are i ) the existence of those special , orthogonal constrained polynomials @xmath326 and associated modes @xmath64 which design convenient sets of coordinates and convenient parametrizations of @xmath110 @xmath18 @xmath327 etc . , ii ) the explicit relation we showed between these modes and the traditional perturbation theories used in the many - body problem and iii ) the likely possibility of truncated descriptions and accurate parametrizations .    actually , in the context of extended systems ,",
    "the idea of density waves as important modes of the system has always been present .",
    "there remains to be seen , obviously , if our modes can be generalized to infinite systems .",
    "it also remains to be seen whether , for finite or infinite systems , our truncations are always justified , whether infinite resummations are possible , whether collective degrees of freedom are present , or absent , because of our new representation .",
    "also , because of our choice of a gaussian weight for the new family @xmath328 the present results are better meaningful if restricted to nuclei .",
    "a generalization to atoms and molecules obviously demands other weights for the constrained polynomials .",
    "the usual perturbation theories have their hierarchy of modes in many - body space , most often a hierarchy of particle - hole components .",
    "our approach , tuned to the one - body nature of the density functional , replaces the particle - holes by other modes , in a transparent way .",
