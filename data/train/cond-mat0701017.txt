    "since the qpc scattering matrices contain parameters that are not under experimental control , it is relevant to ask how the results are altered when a more general choice @xmath184 with @xmath185 $ ] and @xmath186 $ ] is made for the scattering matrices . with this choice",

    "the phase of @xmath96 does not return to its original value after the transfer of two eigenvalues .",
    "rather , one expects fluctuations associated with an energy @xmath189 because @xmath96 is no longer real , positive and negative frequencies do nt contribute equally .",
    "however , while the eigenvalue trajectories lie close to the real line , one can expect results similar to those obtained for real @xmath96 .",
    "we obtained numerical results for four scattering matrices of the form ( [ eqs2 ] ) .",
    "we chose @xmath190 and @xmath191 . to sharpen abrupt features we chose @xmath192 so that the exponential decay of @xmath96 is associated with a long decoherence time : @xmath193 .",
    "as depicted in fig .",
    "( [ sfig1 ] ) , we found @xmath136 to behave as follows . for @xmath194 close to zero ,",
    "@xmath136 consists of one peak situated at @xmath195 .",

    "the closer to zero that @xmath194 is taken , the more abrupt this behavior of the tails become . as @xmath194",
    "is increased , a second peak starts appearing at @xmath197 .",
    "when @xmath198 , the height ( and width ) of this peak exactly equals that of the peak at @xmath199 . in the interval",
    "@xmath200 $ ] that is bounded by the peaks , @xmath96 is significantly larger than in the region outside the peaks .",
    "this behavior of @xmath136 translates into the occupation probabilities @xmath180 depicted in fig .",

    "@xmath180 still changes from unity to zero in an interval of length @xmath183 manifesting excitations with charge @xmath21 while for @xmath201 the interval shrinks to @xmath14 , indication half - integer charge .",
    "the closer @xmath194 moves to @xmath18 or @xmath182 , the sharper the interval becomes defined .",
    "we therefore conclude that the fractional charge phenomenon in the qpc is not confined to the special choice ( [ eqs1 ] ) of scattering matrices .",
    "up to this point we have considered spinless electrons in the qpc . in this appendix",
    "we investigate the effect of including spin . we still take the interaction between the qpc and the qubit to be spin independent .",
    "however , the mere existence of a spin degree of freedom for qpc electrons doubles the dimension of channel space .",
    "the narrowest qpc now has two channels in stead of one and @xmath202 , i.e. the determinant @xmath203 with spin included is the square of the determinant @xmath204 without spin . for real determinants",
    ", squaring kills the phase .",
    "this means that the observed period doubling for the parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ eqs1 ] ) disappears and with it the half integer charge features of @xmath13 .",
    "physically , it could be that two charge @xmath32 excitations are transmitted through the qpc simultaneously",
    ". however , fractional charge is saved by the fact that , for @xmath205 , @xmath206 has two peaks with different heights .",
    "suppose the relative peak heights are @xmath207 and @xmath208 , i.e. @xmath209 where @xmath207 is a real number between @xmath18 and @xmath210 .",
    "( @xmath211 corresponds to @xmath212 while @xmath213 corresponds to @xmath214 . )",
    "it follows that @xmath215 has three peaks at      as long as @xmath207 is small , i.e. @xmath194 is not too close to @xmath182 , the first two peaks will dominate the third , and a signature of fractional charge may still be observable in @xmath180 . fig .",

    "<S> @xmath0 is the qubit level splitting , a parameter that can be tuned easily in an experiment by means of a gate voltage . </S>",
    "<S> the qpc supplies the energy by transfering charge from the high voltage reservoir to the low voltage reservoir . </S>",

    "<S> current @xmath11 gives the average over many switches and is thus related to the stationary probability by @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> the values of @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are determined through measurement and @xmath13 is inferred .    when the qpc and qubit are weakly coupled @xcite , a single electron is transfered @xcite . </S>",

    "<S> straight - forward energy balance arguments force us to conclude that qubit switching is accompanied by the transfer of charge @xmath32 through the qpc . </S>",
    "<S> this frees up energy @xmath33 , stimulating qubit transitions when @xmath34 . in other words </S>",
    "<S> , the qubit switching excites a half - integer charge and simultaneously detects it . </S>",

    "<S> still , it oscillates and the period of these oscillations doubles as we go from weak to strong coupling ( fig . 3*b * ) . </S>",
    "<S> the doubling can be understood in terms of the transfer of the eigenvalues of @xmath94 upon increasing @xmath74 ( fig 3*a * ) assuming the parametrization ( [ scat ] ) . in the large @xmath74 </S>",
    "<S> limit , energy - time uncertainty can be neglected in a `` quasi - classical '' approximation : the operator @xmath97 projects onto a very long time interval , and is replaced by the identity operator . @xmath98 becomes diagonal in energy . </S>",
    "<S> all eigenvalues that are not equal to @xmath17 are concentrated in the transport energy window @xmath99 where the filling factors in the qpc reservoirs are not the same . </S>",

    "<S> numerical diagonalization of @xmath104 ( fig . 3*a </S>",
    "<S> * ) shows that one eigenvalue is transfered from @xmath17 to @xmath101 during time @xmath105 . </S>",
    "<S> if @xmath106 as in the weak coupling case , this gives rise to @xmath107 oscillations with frequency @xmath108 manifesting integer charges . </S>",
    "<S> however @xmath103 becomes negative at stronger couplings , so that @xmath107 changes sign with each eigenvalue transfer . </S>",
    "<S> two eigenvalues have to transfer to give the same sign . </S>",
    "<S> the result is a period _ doubling _ of the oscillations in @xmath96 and hence half - integer charges . </S>",
    "<S> this resembles the behavior of the wave vectors of the bethe - ansatz solution in @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the parametrization ( [ scat ] ) of the @xmath109 is not general . however , the eigenvalue transfer arguments help to understand general scattering matrices . </S>",
    "<S> eigenvalue transfer still occurs at frequency @xmath108 but instead of traveling along the real line , eigenvalues follow a trajectory inside the unit circle in the complex plane . </S>",
    "<S> fractional charge is pronounced if the end point of the trajectory has a negative real part . </S>",
    "<S> numerical results for general scattering matrices are presented in appendix b.    results presented so far are for `` spinless '' electrons . </S>",
    "<S> spin degeneracy is removed by e.g. high magnetic field . if spin is included , but scattering remains spin independend , then two degenerate eigenvalues are transported simultaneously . in this case , the half - integer charge dissapears for the parametrization ( [ scat ] ) but persists for the more general choice of complex eigenvalues . </S>",
    "<S> the results of further numerical work that confirm this are presented in appendix c.    we have studied a quantum transport setup that can easily be realized with current technology , namely that of a quantum point contact coupled to a charge qubit . </S>",
    "<S> the qubit is operated as a measuring device , its output signal  the probability @xmath13  is directly seen in the qpc current . </S>",
    "<S> the dependence of the signal on the qubit level splitting reveals the nature of charged excitations in the voltage - driven qpc . </S>",
    "<S> when the qubit is weakly coupled to the qpc , the dependence reveals excitations with electron charge @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrated that for stronger coupling , the dependence suggests the existence of the excitations that carry half the charge of an electron . </S>"
