    "the energy density of magnetic field in local interstellar gas is not negligible , which plays significant roles on the formation of stars in our galaxy .",
    "this magnetic field is generally regarded as a consequence of dynamo amplification of initial seed magnetic field generated in the early universe .",
    "various generation mechanism of this seed field have been proposed so far : magnetic field generation in the very early universe due to the coupling of gravity and electromagnetic field(e.g . * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , non - zero @xmath3 term due to the inhomogeneity of radiation field at the recombination of the universe(e.g .",
    "* ) , the biermann battery effect@xcite at the shock front in forming galaxies(e.g .",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) / at the ionization fronts in the reionizing universe@xcite .",
    "it has also been proposed that the radiation force and the biermann battery effect in the neighbor of luminous sources can generate seed field@xcite .",
    "interestingly , all of these models suggest the seed field strength of @xmath4 g at igm densities , that is well below the observational constraint ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and the references therein )",
    ".    the generated seed magnatic fields could potentially affect the star formation process in the early universe as seen in our galaxy , e.g. , through launching jets , transferring angular momentum , and suppressing the gravitational fragmentation of disks .",
    "it has been pointed out that the registivity of the primordial gas should be relatively low throughout the collapse of a cloud ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "as a result , magnetic fields do not dissipate from the cloud at jeans scale .",
    "thus , given a same strength of seed magnetic field at the onset of the collapse , magnetic field should has larger impact on star formation in the primordial gas than that in the present - day molecular cloud in which magnetic field dissipate within a certain range of densities(e.g .",
    "@xcite have addressed the dynamical effects of magnetic field on the star formation in primordial gas , assuming ideal mhd , which is correct as far as we consider larger scales than the jeans length .",
    "they found that the magnetic field do have dynamical impact on the collapsing gas including the formation of jets if @xmath5 g at @xmath6 .",
    "@xcite addressed the later evolution of the system ( the gas accretion phase ) by resistive mhd calculations .",
    "they found that the fragmentation of the disk is significantly suppressed by the magnetic field in case @xmath7 g .",
    "however if we convert this field strength to the igm density at @xmath8 assuming flux freezing , we obtain @xmath9 g which is much larger than the seed field strength predicted by various models as mentioned above .",
    "hence , magnetic field seems unlikely to affect the dynamics of the formation of primordial stars . to put it the other way around , if seed field of @xmath9 g is generated by some mechanism ,",
    "magnetic field is a vital part of star formation in the early universe .",
    "it has been suggested that small scale turbulence can amplify the seed magnetic field with a dynamical time scale , and it inversely cascade into larger scales to affect the dynamics of star forming cloud at jeans scale@xcite , although the sufficient amplification to affect the dynamics of the gas has not been shown starting from very week seed field of @xmath10 g by ab initio numerical simulations so far@xcite . in any case",
    "the amplitude of seed magnetic field is an important key parameter to understand the primordial star formation .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the seed magnetic field generation mechanism regarding anisotropic radiation field and complex density / temperature structures in the very neighbor of forming first stars , which was originally discussed in our previous studies at 100pc-10kpc scales @xcite .",
    "we focus on the magnetic field generation especially in the very neighbor of proto - first - stars at 100 - 1000au scale where accreting / outflowing gas create intricate structures . since the generated field strength depends on the radiation flux from the source star , stronger magnetic field is expected .",
    "such complicated structures have already been calculated by @xcite .",
    "they investigated the gas accretion process onto a proto - first - star by two dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulations , although the generation process of magnetic field was not taken into account . in this paper , we evaluate the growth of magnetic field by post - processing scheme utilizing their simulation as a background .",
    "then we discuss the impact of the magnetic field generated through this process on the evolution of the proto - first - stars and the formation of second generation stars .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we describe the fundamental processes of seed field generation in section [ mag_generation ] . in section [ model ]",
    "we show our numerical model , and the results are shown in section [ results ] .",
    "section [ discussion ] is devoted to discussion and conclusion .",
    "in this section , we briefly describe the basic equations of magnetic field generation , more detailed description can be found in @xcite though .",
    "the growth of magnetic field is described by the following induction equation with two source terms :    @xmath11    this equation is obtained by combining the equation of the force balance on a single electron with the maxwell s equations .",
    "here we omitted the hall current term , which is proportional to @xmath12 , since the this is the higher order term than the others , in case we consider the generation of weak magnetic field .    the first term in the r.h.s .",
    "denotes the advection of magnetic field lines which stick to the gas .",
    "if the second and third term is neglected , frozen - in condition is satisfied .",
    "thus , the first term is not the source of the magnetic field generation .",
    "the second term is the biermann battery term@xcite , which is non - zero in case the gradient of electron density and pressure are not perfectly parallel with each other .",
    "the third term is the radiation term , which is proportional to the rotation of the radiation force field on a single electron ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "the radiation force @xmath13 is composed of two micro processes that could be potentially important for the momentum transfer from photons to electrons .",
    "first one is the thomson scattering .",
    "we use formal solution of radiation transfer equation for @xmath14 as follows : @xmath15   d\\nu,\\label{eq : momtr_t}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath14 denotes the radiation force per single electron due to thomson scattering , @xmath16 is the cross section , @xmath17 is the incident energy flux density . @xmath18",
    "denotes the lyman - limit frequency , @xmath19 is the optical depth at the lyman limit regarding the photoionization , and @xmath20 denotes the frequency dependence of photoionization cross section , which is normalized at the lyman limit , i.e. @xmath21 is satisfied .",
    "the second process is the photoionization , whose contribution to @xmath13 is given as @xmath22   d\\nu , \\label{eq : momtr_ion}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 denotes the photoionization cross section at the lyman limit .",
    "we remark that the factor @xmath24 in r.h.s .",
    "of equation ( [ eq : momtr_ion ] ) is due to the fact that the photon momentum is equally delivered to protons and electrons .",
    "then , we also can safely assume that only electrons are accelerated by this momentum transfer process , since protons have much larger inertia than electrons .",
    "we take the underlying model of the proto - first - star formation from @xcite .",
    "the initial condition of the model is taken from @xcite , where the formation of the embryo protostar is simulated in a fully cosmological context . the subsequent evolution in the mass accretion stage",
    "is followed with 2d radiation hydrodynamic simulations coupled with the protostellar evolution calculations ( see hosokawa et al .",
    "2011 for full details ) .",
    "the stellar mass rapidly increases in this stage , as the gas accretes onto the star through a circumstellar disk .",
    "the stellar uv luminosity also sharply rises with increasing the stellar mass , and a bipolar hii region emerges .",
    "the hii region then begins to expand dynamically in the accreting envelope , which blows away the gas in the envelope .",
    "the circumstellar disk is exposed to the stellar ionizing radiation , and gradually loses its mass owing to the photoevaporation . in the fiducial case , which is adopted here ,",
    "a @xmath25 star forms as the mass accretion is finally shut off by the stellar uv feedback effect .",
    "+    now we are able to simulate the generation of magnetic field by integrating the equation ( [ eq : b_growth ] ) by postprocessing method utilizing the results of radiation hydrodynamics simulation mentioned above , i.e. , the snapshots of the spacial distributions of density , temperature , velocity and chemical abundances in the accretion envelope .",
    "then we assess the biermann battery term by a simple finite difference scheme . because of axis symmetry , @xmath26 and @xmath27 are both perpendicular to @xmath28 , the base vector of the azimuthal angle .",
    "thus , the source term @xmath29 is parallel to @xmath28(fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "we can also calculate the radiation term by ray - tracing from the central protostar .",
    "this radiation term @xmath30 is also directed to @xmath28 , because of the axial symmetry again(fig.[fig1 ] ) .",
    "we also remark that this term is expected to be significant on the ionization front , where the shear of @xmath13 is large .",
    "thus , the seed field generated by these source terms is parallel to @xmath28 .",
    "in addition to these source terms , the dynamo term @xmath31 is also parallel to @xmath28 as long as @xmath32 is satisfied .",
    "since we assume zero field strength at the initial state in the present simulations , magnetic field is always parallel to @xmath28 throughout the simulation .",
    "it is also worth noting that the dynamo term reduces to a simple advection term under the assumed symmetry in the present simulation .",
    "we ignore the contribution from the diffuse radiation emitted from the surface of the disk , since its contribution to the photoionization is smaller than the direct radiation from the protostar .",
    "we use time stepping given by the courant condition to integrate equation ( [ eq : b_growth ] ) , so that we can handle the advection of magnetic field . since the output interval of the radiation hydrodynamics simulation is larger than the required time step , we interpolate the data between the output time steps .",
    "+    fig.[fig2 ] shows the evolution of electron number density and magnetic field around the protostar .",
    "top three panels show the distribution of electron number density on @xmath33 plane of cylindrical coordinate at @xmath34 yrs , @xmath35 yrs , and @xmath36 yrs after the formation of the protostar .",
    "middle panels show the spatial distribution of magnetic field strength at the corresponding epochs .",
    "the box is 1800au on a side .",
    "the protostars are located at the bottom left corners of the boxes , and their masses at the three epochs are @xmath37 and @xmath38 , respectively .",
    "bottom row shows the volume weighted probability distribution function on @xmath39}-\\log b{\\rm [ g]}$ ] plane .",
    "the left column corresponds to the time just after the breakout of ionization front , when the magnetic field is generated in the very neighbor of the protostar .",
    "roughly speaking , the ionized / photoheated small bubble ( top ) is magnetized ( middle ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the field strength is weak in the outer less dense regions ( bottom ) .",
    "another @xmath40yrs later ( middle column ) , an ionization front expand out to this box size to form an hourglass shaped ionized polar region ( top ) .",
    "magnetic field is generated at the ionization front , and the generated magnetic field is transferred to outer less dense regions , riding on the outflow into the polar direction following @xmath41 law ( bottom ) , roughly .    finally , at @xmath36yrs(right column )",
    ", the generated field strength is @xmath42 ( bottom ) .",
    "this magnitude is still less than the critical field strength shown by white solid line , above which the fragmentation of the accretion disks around proto - first - stars are suppressed@xcite .",
    "fig.[fig3 ] show the color contour maps of source terms regarding the magnetic field generation at @xmath43yrs after the formation of the protostar .",
    "this epoch corresponds to the final snapshot in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "top left panel shows the biermann battery term , the second term of the left hand side in equation ( [ eq : b_growth ] ) , while top right is the radiation term , i.e. the third term in equation ( [ eq : b_growth ] ) .",
    "the radiation term is prominent at the ionization front , since the shear field of radiation force is maximized at the border between the ionized region and the shadowed neutral region .",
    "the biermann battery term is also important at the ionization front , across which the temperature and the density changes dramatically .",
    "we also remark that the biermann battery term dominates in more extended regions ( see bottom left , total source term ) since the temperature of the ionized region depends on the distance from the source star very weakly , while the radiation force @xmath13 is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the source .",
    "thus , the radiation term dominates in the neighbor of the protostar .",
    "we also mention that the generated magnetic field has smoother structure than the source terms , because the gas temperature / density changes with time and the generated field is transferred to outer less dense regions ( bottom right ) .",
    "fig.[fig4 ] shows the ratio of the radiation term to the biermann battery term of each cell in the finest numerical box ( the nested grid scheme are employed in the rhd simulation ) .",
    "three colors of points corresponds to the three epochs shown in fig.[fig2 ] .",
    "it is clear that the biermann term is more important than the radiation term just after the break out of the ionization front(blue stars ) , while the radiation term dominates in the later epochs(green and red symbols ) .",
    "this is because the gas is more dynamical in the phase of i - front break out , which leads to larger gradient of density / pressure , so is the biermann battery term . in the later phase ,",
    "the density / pressure structure becomes smoother than that in the earlier phase , and the luminosity of ultraviolet radiation from the protostar becomes larger .",
    "thus , the relative importance of radiation source term becomes larger at later epochs .",
    "the magnetic field is generated by two source terms : the radiation term and the biermann battery term .",
    "the order of magnitude of magnetic field strength generated via these processes in the neighbor of the central protostar can be assessed as follows : @xmath44 here , @xmath45 is the luminosity of the source protostar , @xmath46 denotes the length scale across which @xmath13 or the temperature / density changes , @xmath47 is the distance from the star , @xmath48 is the duration of field generation , and the @xmath49 represents the typical angle between @xmath50 and @xmath26 .    the duration @xmath51 could be assessed as the time scale that the gas is sent brazing out distance @xmath47 by the outflow of typical velocity @xmath52 , as @xmath53 . substituting this expression and typical values ,",
    "we have @xmath54 here we assume @xmath55 .",
    "these estimated orders of magnitude are consisent with the numerical results at the inner high density regions , @xmath56 .",
    "( see bottom three panels of fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "the generate field strength is @xmath57 at the final stage of the present simulation , which is account for @xmath58 , at igm densities of @xmath8 .",
    "this magnitude is comparable to the value obtained by previous estimates at 100pc-1kpc scales @xcite .",
    "the coherence length is also similar with each other , since the outflow will extend out to the host minihalos of @xmath59pc .",
    "this obtained field strength is less than the critical value above which the fragmentation of disk is suppressed by two orders of magnitude @xcite .",
    "in addition , we also remark that such relatively large magnetic field emerges after the central protostar grows up to @xmath60 , since the protostar has to be massive enough to emit ultraviolet radiation . according to a three dimensional radiation hydrodynamics simulation ,",
    "the gas disk is heated by the radiation from the protostar at such epoch , hence the disk is stabilized against gravitational instability @xcite .",
    "thus , the generated magnetic field in this context seems hardly affect the on - site fragmentation of the disk directly .",
    "however , as for the second generation star formation , these field strength could play important roles .",
    "firstly , recent cosmological magneto - hydrodynamics simulations of first star formation revealed that the minihalos that host primordial star forming gas clouds are very turbulent ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "according to the theoretical model , such turbulent motion at much less than the jeans scale could amplify the seed magnetic field with a dynamical time scale , and it inversely cascade into larger scales to affect the dynamics of star forming cloud at the jeans scale .",
    "if this mechanism also works in the collapsing gas clouds in the neighbor of first stars , the seed field formed in the present mechanism would be important for the formation of second generation stars .",
    "secondly , we might have underestimated the field strength . according to the equation ( [ eq : b_o_m ] ) , we have @xmath61 , assuming @xmath62",
    ". however , the very vicinity around the central protostar is not spatially resolved in the underlying simulations . with the higher - resolution simulations resolving the innermost part of the disk , the magnetic fields generated",
    "there should be much stronger than the current estimates . at the disk surface of @xmath63 , which is slightly larger than the radius of a @xmath64 star ,",
    "the generated magnetic field could reach @xmath65 g. we also can assess the density at the surface of the disk of @xmath63 by extrapolating the results of numerical simulation , where the gas density is approximately proportional to @xmath66 .",
    "consequently , we obtain @xmath67 . the generated magnetic field of @xmath65 g at @xmath68 will be blown out to outer less dense regions , and result in @xmath69 .",
    "this is obviously important for the dynamics of gravitationally collapsing gas cloud even without the amplification by small scale dynamo action quoted in the previous paragraph .",
    "however , we remark that higher resolution studies are necessary to find the actual field strength in the very neighbor of the proto - first - star , since this is an estimate based upon the extrapolation of the present results .",
    "we also point out the three dimensional effects can also enhance the magnetic field strength . as shown by recent three dimensional calculations ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) , the gas disk around the protostar is highly non - axisymmetric .",
    "such 3d structures induce poloidal component of the magnetic field , which will result in the dynamo amplification in the disk .    in this paper , we assess the magnetic field generated in the very neighbor of proto - first - star due to the biermann battery effect as well as radiation force . as a result , we find that a weak magnetic field is generated in the inner @xmath70 region and they are blown out to the outer less dense regions riding on the outflows roughly following the @xmath71 low .",
    "the resultant field strength is @xmath72 .",
    "this field strength can be the seed magnetic field of the universe and should be important for the next generation star formation , while it hardly affect the dynamics of the on - site first star formation unless very efficient amplification process is taken into consideration .",
