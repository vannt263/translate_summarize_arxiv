    "transformation optics @xcite in the recent years became an important design tool for new types of artificial materials ( metamaterials . ) in transformation optics one starts from the constitutive equations of vacuum of a possibly curved spacetime , written in generic coordinates : .",
    "furthermore einstein s summation convention is used , which implies a summation over all repeated indices .",
    "further details of our notation are explained in appendix [ sec : conventions ] . ]",
    "@xmath0 it is then observed that these equations resemble the constitutive equations of a special medium with @xmath1 and bi - anisotropic contributions @xmath2 @xcite .",
    "thus , if empty spacetime can look like a medium , it should be possible to find media that look like empty spacetime .",
    "transformation media @xcite are media of this type .",
    "they are linear media that may be interpreted as to mimic a different spacetime . in other words ,",
    "the solutions of the maxwell equations in the medium , which is placed in a certain spacetime called laboratory space , can be mapped on the solutions of the electromagnetic fields propagating in a different , but empty spacetime .",
    "transformation optics thus is a tool to express the solution of the maxwell equations in a yet unexplored medium ( the transformation medium ) in terms of well - known solutions ( here vacuum solutions . )",
    "additionally , transformation optics allows to design media with a pre - defined propagation of light ( a pre - defined solution of fermat s principle @xcite ) in an easy way , since this propagation is encoded geometrically in the chosen transformation of spacetime , locally expressed as a coordinate transformation . as most popular examples",
    ", light can be guided around a volume in space ( e.g.  a sphere or a cylinder ) leading to an invisibility cloak @xcite or the transformation medium can mimic an inversion of space , which leads to a perfect lens @xcite . in these applications it appeared natural to make the interface between vacuum ( outer space ) and the transformation medium reflectionless .",
    "though transformation optics today is used in a much broader context than these two examples , somewhat surprisingly the complete conditions for a reflectionless interface only have been presented recently @xcite and the study of boundary conditions at a generic interface still seems to be missing .    despite its successes ,",
    "transformation optics also has its limitations , mainly in terms of the accessible effective media parameters . as can be seen from eqs .   and",
    ", the constitutive relation of vacuum always has the form of a reciprocal medium with permittivity and permeability being equal .",
    "these restrictions led to ideas how the original setup could be generalized , either within the geometric approach of transformation optics @xcite or by replacing geometric transformations by direct field transformations @xcite . though these generalizations also provide a mapping of vacuum solutions of the maxwell equations onto the solutions of the medium , the implications of this map are often less immediate than in standard transformation optics , where the medium just mimics a free spacetime .",
    "thus a thorough analysis of reflection and refraction at interfaces between such media or between a medium of this type and vacuum is important to improve our understanding of these tools .",
    "it is the aim of this paper to study interfaces between two arbitrary transformation media in detail .",
    "we will concentrate on standard transformation media or media of the generalization of ref .",
    "@xcite , which will be explained more in detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : troptics ] . at these interfaces",
    "standard boundary conditions , @xmath3 will be imposed ( @xmath4 is the unit vector normal to the interface and the indices 1 and 2 refer to the two different sides of the interface . ) the implications of these boundary conditions can be studied in two different ways . since a solution of the maxwell equations in a transformation medium is expressed in terms of a vacuum solution , one can ask the question for which combinations of media the boundary conditions are met if the same vacuum solution is used on both sides of the interface . in this approach",
    "( worked out in detail in sect .",
    "[ sec : boundaryi ] ) the implementation of the boundary conditions yields constraints on the geometric transformations used to describe the two media and it is shown that these constraints can be reduced to two simple rules .",
    "they provide a sufficient ( though not necessary ) condition for a reflectionless interface .",
    "if these constraints are met everywhere on the interface , this interface disappears completely in the formulation in terms of vacuum solutions and consequently becomes invisible .",
    "of course , one can consider the interface between two arbitrary transformation media , which in general is not reflectionless . in this case , as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : boundaryii ] , the solutions in the two different media are expressed in terms of two different vacuum solutions . still , it is possible to re - formulate the boundary conditions completely in terms of the vacuum solutions and the geometric manipulations . in this reformulation",
    "the boundary conditions are no longer independent of the media as is the case in eqs .   and , but depend on the geometric transformations and thus on the characteristics of the media ( the physical content of the boundary conditions of course remains unchanged . ) as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] one advantage of this formulation is the fact that the implications of the boundary conditions for a whole class of media derive from only one specific formula . as basic examples we will show in sect .  [ sec : boundaryii ] how the laws of reflection and refraction at the interface between vacuum and a homogeneous and isotropic medium can be understood in a geometric way .",
    "in this section a brief introduction to standard transformation optics and a generalization thereof are presented .",
    "originally , transformation optics was introduced as a tool to design invisibility cloaks @xcite , the full concept as used in this paper was introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , a pedagogical review was presented by the same authors in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "as already mentioned in the introduction , transformation optics is based on the fact that the constitutive relations of vacuum of a possibly curved spacetime and written in general coordinates resemble those of a reciprocal medium .",
    "thus it should be possible to find media , which may be interpreted as to mimic an empty spacetime , which however is different from the spacetime the medium is placed in .",
    "though in principle no restrictions on the nature of the spacetime to be mimicked exist , the two spacetimes in most applications are related by a diffeomorphism , locally implemented as a coordinate transformation ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : leonhardt ] . )        to design a specific medium by means of transformation optics one starts with the definition of laboratory space , which is the spacetime where the transformation medium shall be placed in . in this spacetime",
    "a coordinate system with coordinates @xmath5 is chosen and in these coordinates the spacetime metric @xmath6 takes a certain form .",
    "one can write down the vacuum solutions of the maxwell equations in laboratory space , which we denote by @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 . now a mapping from laboratory space to a different spacetime , called electromagnetic space , is defined .",
    "mathematically this transformation is a diffeomorphism , locally it is implemented as a coordinate transformation @xmath11 . since electrodynamics is invariant under diffeomorphisms , the two spacetimes are physically equivalent and one simply rewrites the vacuum solutions in terms of the new coordinates @xmath12 and the new metric @xmath13 . until now",
    "no medium parameters have been defined , but the maxwell equations just have been rewritten in terms of different coordinates . in a second step , it is claimed that the physical spacetime still is laboratory space , but the electromagnetic fields shall propagate as if the spacetime was electromagnetic space .",
    "this makes the presence of a medium necessary .",
    "technically this means that the solutions @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , which are solutions of the maxwell equations in the spacetime with metric @xmath13 , have to be turned back into solutions in the spacetime with metric @xmath18 . since the maxwell equations in general coordinates only depend on the determinant of the spacetime metric ( see eqs .   and ) , this can be achieved by a simple rescaling of fields .",
    "as has been shown in refs .",
    "@xcite , a possible rescaling is @xmath19 here , @xmath20 is the determinant of the induced space metric according to eq .  , @xmath21 is positive , if the transformation @xmath22 does not change the orientation of the manifold ( i.e.  a right - handed coordinate system in laboratory space is mapped onto a right - handed one in electromagnetic space ) and @xmath23 otherwise . finally , @xmath24 is positive , if space and spacetime in electromagnetic space have the same orientation , @xmath23 otherwise .",
    "the signs @xmath25 and @xmath26 play an important role in the context of negative refractive index media @xcite and will be written explicitly in all equations to keep full generality of the result . since this paper does not deal specifically with negative refractive index media , these signs are not explained in detail at this point .",
    "further comments are made in the appendix , for a detailed discussion we refer to @xcite . our notation is also summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : leonhardt ] and explained more in detail in the appendix .",
    ", the explicit coordinates of laboratory space with medium are distinguished from the ones of empty laboratory space .",
    "this is necessary , since a particular point in spacetime may be represented by _",
    "different _ values of the coordinates in empty laboratory space and in laboratory space with the medium . ]",
    "if the barred electromagnetic fields constitute a solution of the maxwell equations in electromagnetic space then it is easy to check that the fields with a tilde are indeed a solution in laboratory space .",
    "it is important to notice that the rescalings and are not a symmetry transformation and thus the barred solutions are not physically equivalent to the solutions labeled with a tilde . instead , by means of this rescaling",
    "a medium has been introduced which mimics the electromagnetic space in laboratory space . from the constitutive relation in electromagnetic space , eqs .   and in terms of barred variables , the constitutive relation of the transformation medium",
    "is easily derived with eqs .   and",
    "as @xmath27 we mention that transformation optics does not only provide the constitutive relation and the solutions of the maxwell equations , but it also defines the dispersion relation in a purely geometric way . the vacuum dispersion relation , @xmath28 , rewritten in terms of the generic coordinates of the electromagnetic space becomes @xmath29 with @xmath30 .",
    "this relation also has to hold in the transformation medium , but now is interpreted in laboratory space .     and @xmath31 , while diffeomorphism ii acts on @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "]    in ref .",
    "@xcite an extension of transformation optics was introduced , which is based on the same geometrical principles as standard transformation optics but allows to design media not covered by the constitutive relations and .",
    "this extension starts from the observation that the maxwell equations , @xmath34 split into two sets of equations with mutually excluding field content .",
    "thus , the sets of fields @xmath35 and @xmath36 can be transformed independently .",
    "this means that the generalized transformation media do not mimic a single electromagnetic space , but rather two electromagnetic spaces ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : triplespace ] . ) in these media @xmath37 and @xmath31 propagate as if the spacetime had metric @xmath13 , while @xmath32 and @xmath33 mimic a spacetime with metric @xmath38 .",
    "still , all three spaces ( laboratory space and the two electromagnetic spaces ) are related by diffeomorphisms and thus are physically equivalent . as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : triplespace ] , all variables referring to the electromagnetic space of @xmath37 and @xmath31 are written with a bar , while the variables of the electromagnetic space of @xmath32 and @xmath33 are double - barred . as in standard transformation",
    "optics the solution in laboratory space is obtained from the solution in the electromagnetic spaces by suitable rescalings of the fields .",
    "these rescalings are equivalent to eqs .   and if on the right hand side of the two equations in all barred variables are replaced by double - barred ones .",
    "now , the most general constitutive relation of generalized transformation optics can be derived as @xmath39 here @xmath26 and @xmath40 are @xmath41 if the corresponding maps do not change the orientation of the manifold and @xmath23 otherwise . as abbreviation the notation @xmath42 has been introduced .",
    "it is important to realize that @xmath43 is not an ( inverse ) spacetime metric , in particular it needs not be a symmetric matrix and it does not necessarily have signature @xmath44 .",
    "the most important physical differences between the two constitutive relations / and / can be summarized as follows : in standard transformation optics permittivity and permeability are always equal and proportional to the induced spatial metric @xmath45 ( see eq .  . )",
    "this implies that @xmath46 are symmetric matrices with three positive or three negative eigenvalues .",
    "in contrast to this result , @xmath47 in eq .   and @xmath48 in eq .",
    "are not spatial metrics and thus non - reciprocal media with an anti - symmetric contribution to permittivity and permeability can be described within the generalized setup .",
    "also , the eigenvalues of @xmath47 need not all be positive , which allows to obtain media with strong anisotropy ( also called indefinite media . )",
    "though permittivity and permeability are not equal , they are still related as @xmath49 . as an interesting special case",
    "a proportionality @xmath50 with a positive or negative proportionality constant @xmath51 is conceivable .",
    "an example of this type is presented in sect .",
    "[ sec : boundaryii ] .",
    "standard transformation optics intends to mimic as well as possible the electromagnetic space by means of a medium .",
    "in particular , in transformation media the trajectories of light according to fermat s principle are equivalent to the ones in electromagnetic space ( but differ from the ones in laboratory space without medium ; this aspect is discussed in detail in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "this is also seen from the fact that the poynting vector @xmath52 transforms under the spatial part of the coordinate transformations in the same way as @xmath53 and @xmath54 .",
    "this does not apply to generalized transformation optics as defined in ref .",
    "@xcite , since @xmath37 and @xmath33 are not affected by the same coordinate transformation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : triplespace ] and the discussion in ref .  @xcite . )",
    "finally we notice that bi - anisotropic contributions to the constitutive relations require a mixing of space and time in the transformation from laboratory space to electromagnetic space , such that @xmath55 and/or @xmath56 . in the main part of this paper we will not consider media of this type",
    ", some comments about bi - anisotropic media are made in sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in the main part of this work we will assume media without bi - anisotropic contributions to the constitutive relation , in other words @xmath57 in eqs .  , and @xmath58 , @xmath59 in eqs .",
    ", are assumed to vanish .",
    "bi - anisotropic media in principle can be treated along the same lines , however , the specific results get much more complicated .",
    "we want to study interfaces between two media of this type or between a medium and empty space , whereby empty space is interpreted as a trivial transformation medium ( all mappings are identity maps , thus the vacuum solution in laboratory space is mapped onto itself . ) at the interface we will impose the standard boundary conditions and . furthermore surface charge and current will be set to zero , @xmath60 and @xmath61 . of course , different types of boundary conditions could be studied as well , which however should be rather straightforward once the formalism itself has been developed .    as mentioned in the introduction already",
    ", the consequence of the boundary conditions and can be studied in two different ways . since the solutions of the maxwell equations in the media are constructed out of vacuum solutions we can ask the question under which restrictions on the transformations the boundary conditions are met if the same vacuum solution is used on both sides of the interface .",
    "this means that the interface disappears in electromagnetic space .",
    "since the trajectories of light rays in the media are equivalent to the ones in electromagnetic space it is evident that all interfaces of this type are reflectionless .",
    "alternatively interfaces between two arbitrary transformation media can be considered .",
    "since these interfaces are not necessarily reflectionless , the interface does not disappear in electromagnetic space , but will be visible as a discontinuity between two different vacuum solutions .",
    "still , it should be possible to express the laws of reflection and refraction in terms of vacuum solutions .    in both cases",
    "the exact knowledge of the maps from the vacuum solutions in laboratory space onto the media solutions is indispensable . in this context",
    "we should mention that these maps , as defined in refs .",
    "@xcite , are not unique . as explained in the previous section , generalized transformation optics consists of two steps , a transformation of the equations of motion from laboratory space to the electromagnetic spaces ( the diffeomorphisms i and ii ) and a suitable re - interpretation of the result in laboratory space .. ] under the diffeomorphisms the fields transform according to the standard law @xmath62 the additional signs @xmath63 are needed in order to obtain the correct transformation of the excitation tensor @xmath64 as defined in eq .   and are a consequence of the factors @xmath65 in that equation . as coordinate transformations ( or local representations of diffeomorphisms ) and are unambiguous .    for the second step the rescaling",
    "@xmath66 has been proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite as extension of eqs .   and to generalized transformation optics .",
    "obviously , any change in these equations which does not change the constitutive equations and represents a physically equivalent though mathematically different identification of the medium solution in terms of vacuum solutions of the maxwell equations and thus establishes an ambiguity .",
    "two ambiguities are important in the current work :    * diffeomorphisms which leave the metric invariant ( so - called isometries ) constitute an ambiguity of this kind .",
    "they comprise translations , rotations and lorentz transformations .",
    "this ambiguity is important since in the prescription of refs .",
    "@xcite it is by no means obvious that a certain point on the interface with coordinates @xmath67 is represented by the same values of the coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath68 on both sides of the interface . in other words , it is possible that the interface is represented by two different surfaces in the electromagnetic spaces of the two media .",
    "this leads to a discontinuity in the vacuum solutions , which however can be removed by a suitable choice of an isometry transformation .",
    "* the maxwell equations are invariant under a rescaling of all fields by a constant factor @xmath51 and thus this represents an ambiguity in the re - interpretation in laboratory space .",
    "we will keep this factor in the following and it will be seen below that it is relevant in the case of negative refractive indices . in eqs .   and changes sign under the transformation , as this sign has to be absorbed by a rescaling of @xmath37 and @xmath33 with a negative constant .",
    "however , in the relativistically covariant formulation the ( 4-dimensional ) levi - civita symbol only appears as an overall factor in the constraint @xmath69 , and thus the change of sign is without any consequences .",
    "thus , starting from the relativistically covariant formulation , the negative refractive index appears rather as an ambiguity . ]    combining eqs .  , with eqs .  ,",
    "and taking into account the new factor @xmath51 one obtains @xmath70    first we want to show that the transformations of @xmath37 and @xmath33 and of @xmath31 and @xmath32 are  up to the difference in the associated electromagnetic spaces ",
    "equivalent if bi - anisotropic terms in the constitutive relation are absent .",
    "indeed , if @xmath71 it easily follows from eq .   that @xmath72 with a similar relation for @xmath73 ( the symbol @xmath74 is used to indicate the absolute value of a number @xmath75 in order to distinguish it from the determinant of a matrix , @xmath76 . )",
    "using this equation with @xmath77 in eqs .   and straightforwardly establishes the equivalence . applying the transformation law to the spatial metric",
    ", @xmath78 allows to rewrite eqs .   as @xmath79 by means of the relations  the boundary conditions , which are imposed on the media solutions , can be translated into conditions imposed on the vacuum solutions .    to be able to write down these equations some notations and conventions have to be introduced .",
    "though the interface forms a surface in space , the boundary conditions only will be studied in one particular point of this interface , whose coordinates in laboratory spacetime are denoted by @xmath80 .",
    "furthermore , it is convenient to choose a certain time instance @xmath81 as well , since we allow transformations of time .",
    "most of the equations in this section only hold at this specific point in laboratory space , @xmath82 , which is not indicated specifically if the meaning of the equation is obvious in the context .",
    "since most equations are written in an index notation , an adapted coordinate system will be used . without loss of generality",
    "we can assume that at the point @xmath67 the space vector parallel to the interface is represented as @xmath83 , where indices with capital latin letters take values 1,2 .",
    "the vector perpendicular to the interface accordingly is written as @xmath84 . in concrete application we will also use @xmath85 , @xmath86 . to distinguish the two media",
    "we will denote them as _ left medium _",
    "( index @xmath87 ) and _ right medium _ ( index @xmath88 )",
    "this situation is also illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundarynot ] .        in our notation the boundary conditions and in absence of surface charges and currents can be written as @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , @xmath92 and with eqs .",
    " these are the boundary conditions in terms of the vacuum solutions which will be considered in the following .      in this",
    "section restrictions on the transformations shall be derived under which the boundary conditions and are satisfied automatically , in other words under which the same vacuum solution @xmath93 of the maxwell equations can be used on both sides of the interface : @xmath94 interfaces of this type disappear on the level of the vacuum solutions and thus they must be reflectionless .    most of the results of this section have been obtained elsewhere already , in particular refs .",
    "there are , however , a few differences in the approach taken here : in contrast to refs .  @xcite we intend to construct a solution of the maxwell equations in the media from the solutions in vacuo , furthermore stretching and eventual inversion of the time direction are included in our calculation and finally we work in the generalized approach of transformation optics according to ref .",
    "@xcite .    since we intend to construct a vacuum solution that extends over the interface , the location of the latter in the electromagnetic spaces must the same for the left and right medium , @xmath95 at this point the first ambiguity discussed above is important , since it allows to adjust the two transformations in such a way that this equation holds at the point @xmath96 without changing the physics .",
    "now we can choose without loss of generality our coordinate system @xmath97 according to the discussion above and as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : boundarynot ] .    to derive the restrictions on the transformations the map @xmath98 is considered first , which affects @xmath37 and @xmath31 . the discussed extension of the vacuum solution across the interface is required to hold for any solution of the maxwell equations in vacuum .",
    "therefore , the ensuing restrictions are derived from and as @xmath99 by multiplying eq .   by @xmath100 and summing over @xmath101",
    "this equation yields the conditions @xmath102 as the maps shall be continuous , the two transformations must agree along the boundary and thus @xmath103 to simplify condition the relation @xmath104 may be used .",
    "then the restriction on the transformation of the normal component @xmath105 can be written as @xmath106 by virtue of eq .",
    "the determinant reduces to @xmath107 where the fact that @xmath108 has been used .",
    "the different restrictions  now can be summarized in the following simple form : @xmath109 @xmath110 remains unrestricted .",
    "there exist no transformations with stretchings and/or reversal of time that allow an extension over an interface .",
    "still , space inversions of the type @xmath111 are possible and in these cases @xmath112 . without loss of generality",
    "it then can be assumed that @xmath113 in all mappings .",
    "the whole calculation needs to be redone for the fields @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this generates a new set of conditions , which is found simply by replacing all barred variables in eqs .",
    " by double - barred ones .",
    "an important comment is in order : since the global factors @xmath114 and @xmath115 only can be chosen once , they need to be the same for both mappings . thus solutions only extend over an interface if either none or both mappings include space inversions .",
    "thus , it is seen that indeed the ambiguity associated with the constant @xmath51 plays an important role in the discussion of boundary conditions as soon as negative refractive index media are involved .",
    "although many proposals of transformation designed devices , most importantly the invisibility cloak @xcite and the perfect lens @xcite , fit into the picture described in this section , it is important to realize that in many interesting situations this setup might be too limited . in many situations transformation",
    "designed devices do not exclusively contain reflectionless boundaries . this can happen if some surfaces do not contribute to the functionality of the device . in this case",
    "this might be regarded as a minor problem since the above calculation still applies locally .",
    "however , one also might deal with reflections at functional surfaces , which requires an extension of the approach .      in this",
    "section interfaces between two arbitrary generalized transformation media are considered .",
    "the transformations at such interfaces do not necessarily obey the restrictions and and consequently it can no longer be required that a certain solution of the maxwell equations in the two media is described by the same vacuum solution . of course , a specific solution for @xmath37 and @xmath33 via eqs .",
    " still provides solutions of the maxwell equations on both sides of the interface , but we no longer insist that these solutions obtained from the _ same _ vacuum solution meet the boundary conditions and . this allows to relax all constraints found in the previous section , in particular the transformations need not even be continuous at the interface .",
    "it will be shown in the following how the boundary conditions and ( still with @xmath60 and @xmath61 ) can be rewritten in terms of the vacuum solutions in laboratory space and the geometric transformations .",

    "in this paper boundary conditions at the interface of two generalized transformation media have been studied and it has been shown how the ensuing conditions can be expressed completely in terms of vacuum solutions of the maxwell equations and of geometric manipulations . this task has been carried out in two steps : in a first step we considered the most general situation that allows to describe the electromagnetic fields on both sides of the interface in terms of the same vacuum solution .",
    "obviously , all interfaces of this type are reflectionless . in a second step we relaxed the condition of a single vacuum solution and considered interfaces between two arbitrary transformation media",
    "of course , these are not reflectionless in general ; as basic example we showed how generalized transformation optics allows to derive the standard law of reflection and refraction at the interface of homogeneous and isotropic media in a geometric way .",
    "once this second step has been calculated it is worth to reconsider the meaning of the first result .",
    "we have shown that the boundary conditions at a generic ( not necessarily reflectionless ) interface can be described completely in terms of vacuum solutions of the maxwell equations in laboratory space and geometric manipulations ( diffeomorphisms , locally interpreted as coordinate transformations . )",
    "it is well known that diffeomorphisms have a group structure and it is evident that this group structure extends straightforwardly to transformation media : two transformations applied subsequently again yield a transformation that describes a transformation medium , there exist a unit element , which is the trivial transformation , and to each transformation there exists an inverse which reverts the action of the former .",
    "given an interface between two generalized transformation media , whose boundary conditions in terms of vacuum solutions are described by eqs .   and , we may ask the following question : which interfaces between two different transformation media yield the _ same _ boundary conditions in terms of the vacuum solutions ?",
    "the answer is given by the result of sect .",
    "[ sec : boundaryi ] . from our specific choice of media",
    "we can obtain physically different situations by applying to these media solutions additional transformations that obey the constraints and . under such transformations the eqs .   and do not change and thus the boundary conditions in terms of the vacuum solutions are not changed . therefore the transformations of sect .",
    "[ sec : boundaryi ] define equivalent classes of transformation media within the general result of sect .",
    "[ sec : boundaryii ] and with respect to the group structure of diffeomorphisms .",
    "the reflectionless media are those which are members of the equivalent class of an interface vacuum - vacuum .",
    "finally it should be mentioned that similar formulas could also be derived for bi - anisotropic media . still ,",
    "since the coordinate transformations associated with these media mix the spatial directions with the time direction in order to obtain @xmath55 and @xmath56 , they will also mix @xmath37 with @xmath31 and @xmath32 with @xmath33 .",
    "thus the ensuing conditions are expected to be considerably more involved .",
    "the author wishes to thank j.  llorens montolio for helpful discussions .",
    "this work profited a lot from fruitful discussion with m.  qiu and m.  yan and w.  yan during a cooperation of the advanced concepts team of the european space agency with the royal institute of technology ( kth ) .",
    "the cooperation was funded under the ariadna program of esa .",
    "in this appendix we present our notations and conventions regarding the covariant formulation the maxwell equations on a generic ( not necessarily flat ) manifold and written in general coordinates . for a detailed introduction to the topic we refer to the relevant literature , e.g.  @xcite . throughout the whole paper natural units with @xmath199",
    "are used .",
    "greek indices @xmath200 are spacetime indices and run from 0 to 3 , latin indices @xmath201 space indices with values from 1 to 3 .",
    "furthermore an adapted coordinate system is used at the interface , such that @xmath202 , where @xmath203 are the directions parallel to the interface , while @xmath204 is perpendicular .",
    "therefore capital latin indices take values 1,2 .    for the metric we use the `` mostly plus '' convention , so the standard flat metric is @xmath205 .",

    "an induced two - dimensional metric on the interface may be defined .    to motivate the transformation properties and we present the maxwell equations in terms of the field strength tensor @xmath213 and the excitation tensor @xmath64 .",
    "the field strength tensor @xmath213 encompasses the electric field and the magnetic induction , the excitation tensor @xmath64 the displacement vector and the magnetic field with the identification @xmath214 finally , electric charge and current are combined into a four - current @xmath215 . in this way the maxwell equations can be written in the compact form @xmath216 the maxwell equations depend on the metric through the covariant derivative @xmath217 . since @xmath218 it is seen that the maxwell equations just depend on the determinant of the metric , but not on its individual components .",
    "diffeomorphisms can change the orientation of a manifold , such that a right - handed coordinate system in laboratory space is mapped onto a left - handed one in electromagnetic space .",
    "this induces several changes of signs due to the levi - civita tensor that appears in the maxwell equations .",
    "the four dimensional levi - civita tensor is defined as @xmath219\\ , & \\epsilon^{\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma } & = - \\frac1{\\sqrt{-g}}[\\mu\\nu\\rho\\sigma]\\ , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath220 = 1 $ ] .",
    "the relation between the four - dimensional levi - civita tensors in the three different spaces can be written as @xmath221 where @xmath26 and @xmath40 are @xmath41 if the corresponding map does not change the orientation of the manifold , @xmath23 otherwise    the reduction of the four dimensional to the three dimensional tensor reads @xmath222 an additional complication arises in the definition of @xmath223 and @xmath224 , since the orientation of the spacetime manifold may change without changing the orientation of space ( e.g.  a map @xmath225 , @xmath226 changes the orientation of spacetime but not of space . )",
