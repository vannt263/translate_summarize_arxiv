    "the new generation dark energy experiments also impose severe challenges on understanding any possible systematic shifts in the bao signature due to nonlinear gravitational growth , scale - dependent bias and redshift space distortions ( rsd ) to a high precision , better than the measured statistical uncertainties .",

    "the bigmd simulations are designed to have sufficient resolution to resolve halos and subhalos within a cubic box of @xmath26 on a side with a completeness suitable to study the clustering of galaxies hosted by halo samples with bias down to 1.2 at @xmath21 .",
    "this bias regime has never been explored with decent numerical resolution for the study of the non - linear bao shift to a high - precision . for consistency",
    ", we have also studied the damping of acoustic oscillations both for dark matter and halo biased tracers .",

    "[ sec : bao ] , we describe the details of the methodology adopted to measure the bao shift and damping for dark matter and various halo samples . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we present our main results , and we summarise and conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     we provide in table  [ table : tab3 ] the best fit values of the bao shift and damping measured at different redshifts up to @xmath27 for four bigmd dark matter halo samples , in real - space , with number densities @xmath28 ; which scan a halo bias range from @xmath9 to @xmath10 over the entire explored redshift range .",
    "we measure in all halo samples a typical bao shift of @xmath29 which does not seems to evolve with redshift within the errors , that range from @xmath30 for the denser halo sample with number density @xmath31 to @xmath32 in the case of the sparsest sample with @xmath33 .",
    "we summarize our bao shift results for the halo tracers in figure  [ fig : fig5 ] .",
    "we plot the shift @xmath34 $ ] as a function of halo bias at @xmath21 , where we have adopted the assumption that @xmath35 @xcite . for each halo sample ,",
    "we plot with different tiny solid symbols for the different redshifts ( color coded ) each of the individual bao shift measurements .",
    "additionally , large open circles shows the mean values of the shift measurements for the four bias bins , and @xmath36 error bars correspond to the errors of the mean .",
    "we obtain @xmath34 $ ] shifts @xmath37 and @xmath38 for a mean halo bias of @xmath39 , and @xmath40 respectively .",
    "the size of the bias bins are about the diameter of the open symbols .",
    "thus , we conclude there is a flat dependence of the bao shift as a function of halo bias in our bigmd planck simulations .",
    "this is the first time that this level of accuracy has been reached for the study of the shift in the acoustic scale for halo tracers .",
    "most of works found in the literature adopted a halo occupation distribution ( hod ) modelling given their hardness to resolve well halos and subhalos for the bias samples studied in this work , which are typical tracers of large galaxy surveys .",
    "this result has to be reconciled with perturbation theory predictions found in the literature that predicted an increase of the shift with halo bias @xcite . a better understanding of the non - local bias would be required to allow the proper shifts of the acoustic scale reported in this work for the halo tracers .",
    "understanding this bao systematics is key , and represent a serious challenge for future redshift surveys , such as desi and euclid , that aim to reach an accuracy in the bao scale better than @xmath41 .",
    "redshift - space estimates for the bao shifts are provided in table  [ table : tab4 ] .",
    "results , in general , may suggest a larger shift as compared to real - space , although they are not as convincing given their larger errors , about @xmath42 times larger than real - space uncertainties ( see table  [ table : tab3 ] ) .",
    "our measurement results in real - space on the evolution with redshift of the bao damping for our four bigmd halo samples are also given in table  [ table : tab3 ] .",
    "we report a different behaviour as that seen , and discussed above , for the dark matter tracer .",
    "this is clearly observe in figure  [ fig : fig6 ] , where we see that the damping @xmath43 measurements in halos decreases down to @xmath44 with decreasing redshift as compared to dark matter , represented in the plot by a solid line that connects the measurements listed in table  [ table : tab1 ] , and shown in figure  [ fig : fig4 ] as open triangles .",
    "we also notice , at a given redshift , less damping of the bao signature for halo samples with smaller number densities , i.e. larger halo bias ( see bottom panel of figure  [ fig : fig6 ] ) . in summary , from our analysis we can conclude that the acoustic feature for halos suffers less broadening due to nonlinear effects than for dark matter , and remarkably , damping of the acoustic oscillations in halos seems to depends mildly on bias .",
    "the smaller damping seen in the bao signal for halo tracers is highlighted in figure  [ fig : fig7 ] when we show the ratio of the scale - dependent halo bias in the bigmdpl simulation with acoustic oscillations to that in the non - wiggle bigmdplnw simulation for the measurements of the @xmath21 halo sample with number density @xmath45 10@xmath46 mpc@xmath46 @xmath47 ( @xmath48 ) shown in figure  [ fig : power ] , i.e. @xmath49/[p^h_{nw}(k)/p^{dm}_{nw}(k)$ ] ] ( solid circles ) .",
    "the solid line represents the best fit model to the data as discussed in sec .",
    "a clear modulation in phase with the acoustic scale is observed in the halo bias , with an amplitude of @xmath50 , due to the presence of the baryonic acoustic oscillations .",
    "it is worth mentioning the work by @xcite , who using much worse numerical resolution and significantly less volume in their simulations , but performing many realisations and taking advantage of using non - wiggle realisations , did also detect this signature in the halo bias due to the bao for a halo sample with two order of magnitude @xmath51 mpc@xmath46 h@xmath52 higher number density , where they detected a modulation amplitude of @xmath53 due to the much larger bias of their sample ( @xmath54 ) ( see bottom panel of their fig .",
    "4 ) .    for all halo samples and redshifts",
    "we clearly observe a larger bao damping in redshift - space .",
    "our measurements are provided in table  [ table : tab4 ] , and within the errors they can be explained well by adopting a shift increase of @xmath55^{1/2}$ ] due to redshift - space distortions , as discussed above .",
    "we study , from redshift 1 to the present , the nonlinear evolution of the shift and damping of baryonic acoustic oscillations in the power spectrum of dark matter and halo tracers using cosmological simulations with high - mass resolution over a large volume .",
    "the results presented in this paper are based on the bigmultidark suite of simulations in the standard @xmath1cdm cosmology , with numerical parameters ( mass and force resolution ) that have been chosen to face the requirements imposed by current and future dark energy experiments on understanding any possible systematic shifts in the bao signal due to nonlinear gravitational growth , scale - dependent bias and redshift space distortions to a high precision , better than the measured statistical uncertainties .",
    "our measurements can also be useful for comparison with perturbation theory works that aim at explaining the nature of bao shift and damping in dark matter and haloes .",
    "our main results can be summarised as follows .    * for a given tracer , we measure at several redshifts the bao shift @xmath4 and damping @xmath43 by fitting the ratio @xmath56 of the power spectrum with acoustic oscillations to that with non - wiggle drawn from the planck bigmdpl / bigmdplnw simulation pair , adopting the model given in eq .",
    "[ eq : pkratio ] .",
    "the effect of cosmic variance is largely reduced when dividing by the no - bao power spectrum , which together with the proper numerical resolution and large volume allow us to report measurements of the bao shift and damping with unprecedented accuracy . * for dark matter , we report shifts of the acoustic scale towards larger k , relative to the linear power spectrum , measured with much better precision as previously reported in the literature .",
    "this , together with the good sampling in redshift allow us to provide an accurate parametrisation of the evolution of @xmath4 as a function of the linear growth factor @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath57 = ( 0.350\\pm 0.014)[d(z)/d(0)]^{1.74\\pm 0.14}$ ] for the data in real - space .",
    "and we find @xmath57 = ( 0.3716\\pm 0.0083)[d(z)/d(0)]^2 $ ] if we fix the power index to 2 , as expected from perturbation theory .",
    "furthermore , the evolution of bao damping @xmath43 in real - space agrees remarkably well with that from linear theory as given by eq .  [ eq : kstar ] . in redshift - space , we measure an increase of the shift and damping as compared to real - space , which is well described in linear theory by a constant factor that depends on @xmath58 , the logarithmic derivative of the linear growth rate .",
    "* we measure bao shift and damping also for four halo samples with number densities that scan a halo bias ranging from @xmath9 to @xmath10 over the entire explored redshift range .",
    "our bigmd simulations allows to resolve well halos and subhalos in those samples , contrary to previous studies that adopted an hod modelling due to their lack of numerical resolution .",
    "we measure in all halo samples a typical bao shift of @xmath11 in real - space , which does not seem to evolve with redshift within the uncertainties .",
    "moreover , we report a constant shift as a function of halo bias .",
    "redshift - space measurements are also performed , although the larger errors prevent us from a conclusive larger shift as compare to real - space .",
    "the damping of the acoustic feature for all halo samples shows a different behaviour as compared to that for dark matter . in summary",
    ", we see that halos suffer less damping , with some weak dependence on bias .",
    "a larger bao damping is measured in redshift - space , which can be well explained by an increase of a @xmath58-dependent factor in linear theory due to redshift - space distortions . * a clear modulation in phase with the acoustic scale",
