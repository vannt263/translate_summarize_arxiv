    "we can try to get some perspective by plotting all the decay rates of subnuclear particles .",
    "this can be done straightly from the tables provided by the particle data group @xcite in its website http://pdg.lbl.gov/. one can see three layers corresponding to decays strong , electromagnetic or weak , with the neutron being appart from the rest of weak decaying particles due to its quark composition . the area of strong decay is actively pushed forward by experimentalists , and",
    "one can see how the actual advances hit on one hand the need of having a noticeable width in the resonance plot , say @xmath9 , and on the other hand enough area .",
    "we have plotted the lines @xmath10 , @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) as reference , but we excuse ourselves about plotting the mass against spin dependence famously reported in chew - frautschi plots .",
    "when particles can not decay strongly -either because there are no other hadronic mode available , or because any available mode should change quark flavours or because asymptotic freedom activates ozi rule- they give way to electromagnetic decay or to weak decay .    in the weak decay area spectator models and other approaches ( even plain dimensional analysis )",
    "point to a @xmath13 scaling , and we have drawn one such line from the muon . note that such line in a spectator model should be used to meet the mass value of the decaying quark , not of the whole particle .",
    "the intermediate area , electromagnetic or radiative decays ( we are using both terms as exchangeable ones in this context ) , is the one we are interested .",
    "we have marked it in both figures [ fig1 ] , [ fig2 ] with a scaling @xmath14 , partly because of the usual @xmath15 decay calculation , partly because of dimensional comparison with weak decays : the weak decays have gained a dimensionful coupling constant ( fermi constant ) from the breaking of electroweak symmetry , and then an additional @xmath16 .",
    "it is interesting to stop a little to think how should the points in the plot move if electroweak symmetry were restored , playing with the parameters in the higgs sector , thus altering the value of fermi constant until a phase transition is reached and it disappears .",
    "it is even possible to use mass formula of mesons and baryons to determine when a given strong decay becomes available / unavailable and some particle leaves / enters the electroweak zone .",

    "the list of known particles whose main decay mode is neither strong nor weak is very short . in order of increasing mass",
    "we meet :    -the neutral pion    -@xmath18 , although it has already a mix with pions that makes use of the strong force .",

    "well , why not ?",
    "they do not decay strongly , and we can not say strictly that they decay weakly , no more than we can claim that death is dead .    if we calculate the reduced decay widths @xmath27 for the above group ,",
    "only the @xmath4 are noticeably appart .    .[inverse square root of ] reduced full decay widths @xmath28 for em ( generically , non strong non weak ) decaying particles [ cols=\"<,>\",options=\"header \" , ]      the particle data group list decays to @xmath30 for about a dozen of strongly decaying mesons but the corresponding widths are still scattered along various orders of magnitude and some extra organizing principle is still needed .    for the baryons , the dominant ( 100% ) @xmath31 is the only decay measured directly , although via primakoff method , and it fits very nicely in the expected range . we could try to add some decays built from the fit of @xmath32 and @xmath33 resonances , for instance from the database of @xcite ( see @xcite for a theoretical model and some experimental plots too ) , but we felt so blocked as in the meson case .      besides the above cases of @xmath19 and @xmath15 whose radiative decay is practically the whole decay , we are interested on considering the charmonium and bottomonium areas , where ozi rule ( a combination of asymptotic freedom and conservation laws ) forbids strong decay and hadron production also proceeds mainly via the electroweak forces .",
    "we find the amazing fact that @xmath3 total width scales respective to @xmath1 ( ! ) total decay as @xmath34 , while @xmath4 could be thought to scale from it as @xmath35 ( but the states of @xmath4 having allowed strong decays are closer to the cubic scaling than to quintic one ) .",
    ", which is strongly decaying , and also two points for @xmath18 ( total decay and @xmath36 only).,width=472 ]      while the decay to leptons stated by sakurai persists , it is to us be of a minor consideration when one takes into account that the whole @xmath3 decay must be electromagnetically dominated . in this case",
    "the property that becomes interesting is the alignment according a scaling @xmath37 already noticed in @xcite and which now incorporates sakurai vector meson decays for @xmath38 and @xmath39 as well as the baryon @xmath19 . besides , the consideration of the decay to @xmath36 of @xmath18 and @xmath40 , instead of the total width , lets one to put such particles near the approximate scaling rule , but this was perhaps already known ( * ? ? ? *",

    "we have eight electromagnetically decaying strong particles ( ten if we count @xmath41 and @xmath20 following a scaling rule across four orders of magnitude in mass and mysteriously fitting a purely electroweak quantity , the decay of @xmath1 ( that is controlled by @xmath42 basically@xcite ) . among spin 0 and spin 1 mesons , only @xmath4 ,",
    "@xmath43 and some excited states do not fit straightly into this rule , and really kinematic and symmetry arguments could be invoked to fit every except @xmath4 ; note for instance already in @xcite the expected 9:1 proportion between @xmath43 and @xmath38 .",
