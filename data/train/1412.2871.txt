    "in recent years , kinetic methods have drawn particular attention as newly - developing computational fluid dynamics(cfd ) technology . unlike the conventional cfd methods based on direct discretizations of the navier - stokes ( ns ) equations ,",
    "kinetic methods are based on kinetic theory or micropartical dynamics , which provides theoretical connection between hydrodynamics and the underlying microscopic physics , and thus yields efficient tools for multiscale flows .",
    "up to date , a variety of mesoscopic methods have been proposed , such as the lattice gas cellular automata ( lgca ) @xcite , the lattice boltzmann equation ( lbe ) @xcite , the gas - kinetic scheme ( gks ) @xcite , and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics(sph)@xcite , among which the lbe and gks are specifically designed for cfd .",
    "the kinetic nature of the lbe and gks has led to many distinctive advantages that distinguish them from the classical cfd methods .",
    "particularly , the gks for the navier - stokes solutions has been well developed @xcite , and successfully applied to a variety of flow problems @xcite .    as a kind of finite - volume scheme , the key ingredient in gks for ns solutions is to construct the flux at the cell interface .",
    "with different approaches , several kinetic schemes have been developed based on the kinetic theory , such as the kinetic flux vector splitting ( kfvs ) @xcite scheme based on the collisionless boltzmann equation and the gks based on the bhatnagar - gross - krook ( bgk ) equation where the particle collisions are considered in the construction of the numerical flux .",
    "it is shown that the gks methods avoids the ambiguity of adding _ ad hoc _  collisions \" for the kfvs to reduce the numerical dissipations @xcite . among the bgk - type schemes ,",
    "the gas - kinetic bgk - ns scheme for the ns solutions has been well developed @xcite , and has been successfully applied for the continuum flow simulation from low - speed incompressible to hypersonic compressible flows @xcite .    in this paper , we present a semi - lagrangian gas - kinetic scheme ( slgks ) , as an alternative bgk - type scheme , for smooth flows .",
    "the most distinguished feature of the proposed scheme is that the construction of the flux at the cell interface is based on the discrete characteristic solution of the bgk equation , which comes from the lagrangian aspect .",
    "this approach results in the particle collision and transport mechanisms coupled together within a time step , which makes the new scheme exhibited very low numerical dissipation and the time step decoupled from the particle collision time . in order to validate present scheme to be a feasible ns solver in the under - resolved region , a set of simulations",
    "are carried out , including the thermal couette flow , thermal poiseuille flow , the shock structure problem and the laminar flow over a flat plate .",
    "the rest of the article is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "[ slgks ] , the semi - lagrangian gas - kinetic scheme is developed .",
    "numerical tests are made in sec .",
    "[ numerical ] to validate the performance of the new scheme , and finally some conclusions are drawn in sec .",
    "the boltzmann equation expresses the behavior of a many - particle kinetic system in terms of the evolution equation of the singlet gas distribution function .",
    "one of its simplified version is the bgk model@xcite , @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the gas distribution function and @xmath2 is the equilibrium state approached by @xmath1 .",
    "both @xmath1 and @xmath2 are functions of space @xmath3 , time @xmath4 , particle velocities @xmath5 , and internal variable @xmath6 .",
    "the particle collision time @xmath7 is related to the viscosity and the heat conduction coefficients .",
    "the equilibrium state is a maxwellian distribution , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the spatial dimension , @xmath10 is the internal degree of freedom , @xmath11 is the density , @xmath12 is the macroscopic velocities , @xmath13 is the gas constant , and @xmath14 is the gas temperature .",
    "the connection between the distribution function @xmath1 and conservative variable @xmath15 is @xmath16 and the fluxes are computed as , @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the volume element in phase space with @xmath19 , and @xmath20 is given by @xmath21^{t}=\\left[1,{\\bm \\xi},\\frac{1}{2}\\left({\\bm \\xi}^{2}+{\\bm \\eta}^{2}\\right)\\right]^{t},\\ ] ] since mass , momentum and energy are conserved during particle collisions , @xmath1 and @xmath2 satisfy the conservation constraint @xmath22 at any point in space and time .    in order to develop a finite volume scheme ,",
    "the computational domain is first divided into a set of control volumes .",
    "then we multiply @xmath23 on both sides of eq .  , and integrate it in phase space and physical space over a control volume @xmath24 from @xmath25 to @xmath26 , due to the conservation of conservative variables during particle collision process , the update of the conservative variables at the center of the @xmath24 becomes    @xmath27    where @xmath28 is the macroscopic flux across the cell interface and @xmath29 .",
    "the mid - point rule is employed in the time domain integration of the convection term .    the key ingredient in updating the averaged conserved variables according to eq .",
    "is to evaluate the flux @xmath30 , which can be solely determined by the gas distribution function @xmath31 . here",
    "the lagrangian perspective is applied in the construction of @xmath32 : the eq .",
    "is integrated within a half time step along the characteristic line with the end point ( @xmath33 ) located at the cell interface , and the trapezoidal rule is used to evaluate the collision term , @xmath34.\\ ] ] in order to remove the implicity of eq .  , we introduce two auxiliary distribution functions    [ trans1 ] @xmath35 @xmath36    note that the particle collision effect is included in the above evolution of the interface gas distribution function",
    ", this is the key for the success of this kinetic method .",
    "then eq .   can be rewritten as @xmath37        for smooth flows , @xmath38 can be reconstructed by making taylor expansion around the cell interface @xmath33 , @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "fig.[fig ] shows the schematic in one - dimensional case .",
    "since the present scheme is targeting the numerical ns solutions in a resolved dissipative region , thus , the chapman - enskog expansion can be employed to approximate the original distribution function .",
    "then , combining with eq .",
    ", two approximations can be applied to eq .",
    "first , @xmath41 is approximated by the first - order chapman - enskog expansion of @xmath1 in the context of the bgk equation , i.e @xmath42 , and the second approximation is that @xmath43 , which is consistent with the first - order chapman - enskog expansion and includes only the first - order derivatives of the hydrodynamic variables @xmath11 , @xmath44 , and @xmath14 .",
    "up to this point , eq .",
    "can be expressed as @xmath45 then based on the compatibility condition and the relation between @xmath1 and @xmath46 , the conservative variables at the cell interface can be obtained , @xmath47 from which the equilibrium distribution function @xmath48 at the cell interface can be obtained .",
    "therefore , based on eq .   and",
    "the obtained equilibrium state , the original distribution function can be extracted from @xmath49 , @xmath50 where @xmath51 .",

    ", the numerical fluxes across the cell interface can be computed , and according to eq .  , the conservative variables at @xmath56 can be updated .",
    "the above procedure can be repeated in the next time step .    finally , we come to the prandtl number fix problem . due to the fact that all the molecules , regardless of the velocities , have the same particle collision time @xmath7 in the bgk model ,",
    "the bgk equation gives a fix prandtl number which is equal to @xmath57 . in order to fix the prandtl number to any realistic value ,",
    "here we use the heat flux modified method proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the energy flux in eq .  ,",
    "and @xmath60 is the heat flux ,    @xmath61    it is noted that , although sharing a common kinetic origin , there are some distinctive features in the semi - lagrangian gas - kinetic scheme and the original gks . first and foremost , different approaches are employed in the construction the flux at the cell interface . in the original gks , the flux is evaluated from an integral solution of the bgk equation @xcite , while in the present scheme the flux evaluation is based on the discrete characteristic solution of the bgk equation that results in a simpler formulation than the original one .",
    "second , unlike the original gks uses the conservative variables at the previous time step @xmath62 in the reconstruction of the distribution function , the present scheme uses the ",
    "instaneous \" half - time variables @xmath63 .",
