    "to understand the generic behavior of a quantum system , effective equations are useful .",
    "in contrast to individual wave functions , or even just stationary states , they directly provide ( approximate ) equations for time - dependent expectation values . since the dynamics of expectation values depends on the whole motion of a state  by quantum back - reaction , all moments of a state couple to the expectation values  these equations in general differ from the classical ones by quantum corrections .",
    "if quantum corrections , for instance an effective potential , can be found explicitly , an interpretation of quantum dynamics in generic terms becomes much easier .",
    "such results are more general compared to conclusions based on individual states .    especially in quantum cosmology ,",
    "the ability to draw generic conclusions is important .",
    "not much is known about the state of the universe except , perhaps , that it currently can well be considered semiclassical .",
    "but semiclassicality is not a sharp notion , and so wide classes of states , differing for instance by the sizes of their quantum fluctuations or correlations , are still allowed . in any such situation , a generic analysis",
    "is called for , most crucially when long - term evolution is involved , or when one evolves toward strong - curvature regimes such as the big bang singularity where quantum effects of all kinds are expected to be important .",
    "it is sometimes suggested , at least implicitly ( and especially in the context of loop quantization ) , that quantum cosmology might somehow be different from other quantum systems , and that quantum back - reaction could be ignored in its effective equations .",
    "quantum back - reaction might be weak for certain states or in certain regimes , especially for models close to solvable ones , but this observation can not be generalized . like the harmonic oscillator in quantum mechanics ,",
    "there are harmonic cosmologies @xcite where expectation values of states follow exactly the trajectories of a corresponding classical system .",
    "such systems are entirely free of quantum back - reaction . for `` small anharmonicity '' , quantum back - reaction might still be weak , as it is realized in quantum cosmology for matter dominated by its kinetic energy density @xcite .",
    "but the tough reality of stronger deviations from the solvable ideal of harmonic systems can introduce severe quantum back - reaction , which must be studied in an unbiased and systematic way .    here",
    ", we introduce a model of quantum cosmology which is not solvable but still treatable by two rather different methods : effective constraints and physical states .",
    "the model is an anisotropic cosmology of locally rotationally symmetric ( lrs ) bianchi i symmetry type , filled with an isotropic , slightly sub - stiff fluid of negative energy density @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the average scale factor of the anisotropic geometry . with this specific density ,",
    "the model becomes treatable by physical coherent states , which justifies its contrived and exotic form .",
    "effective constraint techniques @xcite , applicable much more widely , do not require such a tailored matter source ; they are considerably more powerful .",
    "as we will see by the explicit comparison of this paper , they capture the information in semiclassical physical states to an excellent degree .",
    "moreover , effective techniques self - consistently determine their ranges of validity",
    ". the general applicability of effective constraints will be demonstrated by our final analysis of a model whose matter content , more realistically , is pure radiation .",
    "an anisotropic bianchi i model has a line element @xmath2 with three independent scale factors @xmath3 as functions of proper time @xmath4 . for a canonical formulation ,",
    "we denote the momenta of @xmath5 by @xmath6 .",
    "it is convenient to introduce misner variables @xmath7 and their momenta @xmath8 by the canonical transformation @xcite @xmath9 in these definitions , @xmath10 is a reference scale factor ( e.g.@xmath11 at one moment of time ) introduced to be insensitive to coordinate rescalings .",
    "canonical dynamics in general relativity is determined by the hamiltonian constraint @xmath12 with the spatial metric @xmath13 , its ricci scalar @xmath14 and its momenta @xmath15 . reduced to bianchi i metrics in misner variables , specified to a lapse function @xmath16 , it simplifies considerably to the form @xmath17 as one can check directly , the constraint generates the correct hamiltonian equations of motion in coordinate time , from which the kasner solutions follow .",
    "we now restrict the model further by requiring the anisotropy parameter @xmath18 and its momentum @xmath19 to vanish : @xmath20 . in this way , which can easily be confirmed to be consistent with the equations of motion , we enhance the symmetry and leave two independent gravitational variables : the logarithm of the average scale factor , @xmath21 , and one anisotropy parameter @xmath22 .",
    "the resulting hamiltonian constraint is equivalent to that of a free , massless relativistic particle .    to introduce a `` potential ''",
    ", we will work with a matter source whose energy density is @xmath23 where , in addition to @xmath10 already introduced , @xmath24 is the matter energy density at some `` initial '' time . in the presence of matter , its density multiplied with @xmath25 is to be added to the constraint ( [ vacconstr ] ) .",
    "it becomes to integrate out homogeneous quantities such as the symplectic form @xmath26 , the momenta @xmath27 depend on the rather arbitrary @xmath28 .",
    "the lapse function as chosen here would then be homogeneous in @xmath28 , too , such that @xmath29 is the matter contribution to the constraint . with this ,",
    "all its terms scale in the same way if @xmath28 is changed . solving the constrained system",
    ", we obtain the same reduced phase space for all choices of @xmath28 . ]",
    "@xmath30 if we make convenient ( and irrelevant ) choices for the prefactors and define @xmath31 .",
    "our constraint then becomes that of a `` relativistic harmonic oscillator '' as studied in @xcite : @xmath32 in this analogy , we consider @xmath22 as our time variable , and @xmath33 as the corresponding `` energy . ''",
    "evolution of @xmath21 and @xmath34 with respect to @xmath22 is then generated by the hamiltonian @xmath35 .",
    "a more realistic matter content could be chosen as radiation , with an energy density @xmath36 . here , the hamiltonian is @xmath37 .",
    "we define @xmath38 , such that our constraint solved for @xmath33 takes the deparameterized form @xmath39 ( from now on we choose @xmath33 positive , to be specific . )",
    "this constraint generates hamiltonian equations of motion for the anisotropies @xmath40 and @xmath41 , allowing us to identify the time parameter along its flow with @xmath22 as an internal time .",
    "all derivatives in hamiltonian equations of motion are then with respect to @xmath22 , specifically @xmath42 since @xmath43 is constant in @xmath22 , we can combine these equations to a second order one for @xmath44 , @xmath45 solved by @xmath46 with integration constants @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the equation of motion for @xmath49 tells us that @xmath50 with this , the integration constants can be related to @xmath51 by @xmath52 .",
    "solutions in phase space are ellipses of axis lengths @xmath53 and @xmath54 , traversed in time @xmath22 with frequency @xmath55 .",
    "to derive the behavior with respect to proper time , we use the original constraint @xmath56 not yet deparameterized , and remember that we chose a lapse function @xmath57 .",
    "thus , the equation of motion for @xmath22 with respect to proper time @xmath58 is @xmath59 from here , we determine proper time as a function of @xmath22 by integrating @xmath60 with our solution @xmath44 . inverting the solution allows us to insert @xmath61 into @xmath44 and @xmath62 , resulting in solutions as functions of proper time .",
    "it is not easy to integrate @xmath63 explicitly , but it is clear from the integrand that @xmath63 is a monotonic , one - to - one function which can be inverted globally .",
    "thus , @xmath64 and @xmath65 are defined and finite for all values of proper time .",
    "there is no singularity in this model .",
    "clearly , the negative amount of matter energy violates energy conditions sufficiently strongly to provide the cyclic bouncing solutions embodied by ellipses in the @xmath66-plane .",
    "one can see this directly from the friedmann - type equation resulting from the hamiltonian constraint .",
    "we have @xmath67 , where @xmath33 is constant and @xmath34 can be obtained from the equation @xmath68 , relating it to the derivative of @xmath21 by proper time @xmath58 .",
    "thus , the constraint equation reads @xmath69 and for @xmath70 implies @xmath71 on the right hand side , we identify @xmath72 as the anisotropic shear term , and the contribution @xmath73 as our exotic energy density .",
    "the friedmann equation shows when @xmath74 can vanish , which is realized for @xmath75 , two solutions which correspond to the maximal and minimal @xmath21 along our circles .",
    "the extrema indeed give us a maximum for @xmath76 and a minimum for @xmath77 : the sign of @xmath78 , by the raychaudhuri equation , is determined by the sign of @xmath79 of all the matter sources combined . here",
    ", pressure is obtained from the energy density as the negative derivative of energy by volume , i.e.by @xmath80 resulting in @xmath81 for the negative energy fluid with @xmath82 , and @xmath83 for the shear contribution with @xmath84 . for @xmath79 ,",
    "this gives @xmath85 which at the extrema @xmath75 evaluates to @xmath86 .",
    "the extrema provide a maximum at @xmath87 and a minimum at @xmath77 , and the evolution is that of a cyclic model with infinitely many bounces and recollapses .    for the model with radiation",

    "although @xmath22 appears on the right hand side , the inner product evaluated on solutions ( [ states ] ) is time independent .",
    "however , @xmath112 is not positive definite : it is positive for positive - frequency solutions , but negative for negative - frequency solutions .",
    "a positive - frequency solution is automatically orthogonal to a solution with the sign of its frequency flipped . to correct the sign",
    ", we define the physical inner product as @xmath113 and extend it linearly to superpositions of positive and negative frequency solutions .",

    ", the closeness to the harmonic oscillator has an additional advantage in that it allows us to use its simple form of coherent states  gaussians of arbitrary width expanded in the stationary states  as initial values for evolution in @xmath22 . for the non - relativistic harmonic oscillator",

    "moreover , their expectation values follow the classical trajectories exactly , without quantum back - reaction .    for the relativistic harmonic oscillator , and",
    "thus our anisotropic toy model , the dynamical behavior of the states is still to be seen .",

    "the model introduced here does show spreading and quantum back - reaction , which makes it interesting for a comparison with effective constraint techniques .      in an effective treatment of a quantum system",

    "no approximations are required ; we are thus dealing with an exact quantum theory .",
    "only when evaluating the equations , which would give us expressions such as @xmath124 or moments of a state as functions of @xmath22 , do approximation schemes typically enter .",
    "this is no difference to a representation dependent treatment , where exact evaluations of expectation values such as ( [ alphaexp ] ) or ( [ pexp ] ) are hard to sum explicitly .    at the kinematical level ,",

    "a whole representation of these algebraic relationships on wave functions carries much more details than necessary for extracting physical results .",
    "instead , it is often convenient to focus directly on expectation values and derive dynamical equations for them , avoiding the detour of computing wave functions .",
    "expectation values are not sufficient to characterize a state or its dynamics , but when combined with all moments @xmath128 a complete set of variables results . here , the subscript `` weyl '' in the definition of the moments indicates that we are ordering all operator products totally symmetrically .",

    "this defines poisson brackets between all the moments and expectation values . in this way",

    "this infinite set of functions satisfies two important properties : ( i ) all these functions vanish on physical states annihilated by @xmath127 , and ( ii ) they form a first class set in the sense of classical constraint analysis , i.e.  @xmath141 vanishes on the subset of the phase space where all @xmath142 vanish .",
    "the quantum constraint @xmath127 can thus be implemented on the space of moments by imposing the infinite set @xmath143 as constraints as one would do it on a classical phase space .",
    "we have to find the submanifold on which all constraints vanish , and factor out the flow generated by them .",

    "this procedure has several advantages @xcite .",
    "as already mentioned , it is completely representation independent and instead focuses on algebraic aspects of a quantum system . as a consequence , implementing constraint operators with zero in their continuous spectra is no different from implementing those with zero in their discrete spectrum . any difficulties in finding physical inner products can be avoided , for the physical normalization arises automatically when the constraints are solved for moments .",
    "once we try to find specific solutions , there are of course practical difficulties .",
    "we are dealing with infinitely many constraints on an infinite - dimensional phase space .",
    "sometimes , this set of equations decouples to finitely many ones , but this happens only in rare solvable cases . in more general systems",
    ", we must use approximations to reduce the set to a finite one of relevant equations , with a semiclassical approximation as the main example . here , we look for solutions whose moments satisfy a certain hierarchy , higher moments in the semiclassical case being suppressed by powers of @xmath144 , @xmath145 . to",

    "the shortcomings of the latter technique are less obvious and are of practical nature . in order to apply the method one needs , first of all , to decompose the initial state as a sum of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , which for an arbitrary state and a typical hamiltonian can be complicated . during evolution , each of the eigenstates acquires a phase factor and they need to be re - summed to compute the wave function at a later time . for an arbitrary state , the sum may converge very slowly requiring one to sum over a very large number of eigenstates to obtain an accurate description of the wave function . finally , for expectation values and moments of observables further integrations must be done . in systems of several degrees of freedom , this will add considerably to computation times .    if one is to make robust predictions , a range of initially semiclassical states with a variety of initial values of moments should be considered  the procedure is very complicated to implement using state decomposition but amounts to nothing more than simply changing the initial conditions in the case of the effective equations . in the subsections that follow we use the methods separately and exploit their individual strengths .      knowing the state",
