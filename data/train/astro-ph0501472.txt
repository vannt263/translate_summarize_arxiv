    "no unusual abundance ratios are implied by the detected absorption features , and no emission or absorption features were found other than the expected absorption lines due to interstellar oxygen . for 4u  1850@xmath0087 , this is significantly different from what is implied by the earlier _ asca _ observation , which had established 4u  1850@xmath0087 as being part of a class of four ns / lmxbs all having a similar feature at 0.7  kev in their low - resolution spectra @xcite .",
    "this feature had originally been attributed to unresolved line emission from iron and oxygen ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , a high - resolution observation of the brightest of these sources , 4u  0614@xmath2091 , with _ chandra _ , failed to detect any emission lines , finding instead an unusually high ne / o number ratio in the absorption along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "we had subsequently pointed out that the _ asca _ spectra of all four sources are well fit without a 0.7  kev emission line using a model that includes photoelectric absorption due to excess neon along the lines of sight and presumably local to the sources @xcite .    of the other four sources that we previously proposed as neon - rich systems based on their low - resolution _ asca _ spectra , three ( 4u  0614@xmath2091 , 2s  0918@xmath0549 , and 4u  1543@xmath0624 ) have also shown unusual ne / o abundance ratios in their high - resolution x - ray spectra @xcite . however , a comparison of the _ chandra _ , _ xmm - newton _ , and _ asca _ results for 2s  0918@xmath0549 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 also revealed variability in the measured ne / o ratio , which seemed to be associated with changes in the source continuum properties @xcite .",
    "we previously suggested that changes in the spectral properties of the sources could lead to ionization effects that would produce the variable ne / o ratio found for the neutral edges .",
    "ionization would affect oxygen more than neon , inflating the measured neutral ne / o ratio .",
    "unfortunately , this means that the measured ne / o ratio would not reflect the donor composition .",
    "here we propose that for 4u  1850@xmath0087 as well , ionization effects due to continuum spectral variations are also responsible for the differences between the _ asca _ and _ chandra _ results .",
    "when the _ chandra _ spectrum is rebinned to a resolution comparable to that of _ asca _ , the _ chandra _ data do not show the 0.7  kev feature seen previously with _ asca _",
    "( see figure  [ fig : comp ] ) .",
    "this clearly indicates that the source spectrum changed between 1995 and 2002 .",
    "given our interpretation of the feature as being due to an unusual ne / o ratio in the absorbing material , the lack of the 0.7  kev feature in the _ chandra _ spectrum is consistent with the measured ne / o ratio of 0.22@xmath10.05 , which is close to the interstellar value . had the feature still been present in the binned _ chandra _ spectrum ,",
    "then our interpretation would have been incorrect .",
    "the variation of the ne / o ratio in the absorbing material is accompanied by differences in the continuum spectral properties of 4u  1850@xmath0087 .",
    "the _ chandra _ observation of 4u  1850@xmath0087 was taken during a lower luminosity state than the _ asca _ observation which showed the unusual ne / o ratio .",
    "this is comparable to what was observed in the other proposed neon - rich sources 2s  0918@xmath0549 and 4u  1543@xmath0624 .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data may shed more light on this source .",
    "given that the _ xmm - newton _ results show a ne / o ratio similar to that found in the _ chandra _ data @xcite , we would expect that the continuum properties should also be similar .    while x - ray spectra may be inconclusive in determining the donor composition of these systems , new results from optical spectroscopy",
    "have confirmed their unusual nature .",
    "optical spectra of three candidate ultracompact binaries with suggested neon - rich donors , 4u  0614@xmath2091 , 4u  1543@xmath0624 , and 2s  0918@xmath0549 @xcite , showed no prominent hydrogen or helium emission lines @xcite . in the brightest of these , 4u  0614@xmath2091 ,",
    "@xcite found emission lines which they attributed to carbon and oxygen .",
    "the other spectra were not as high quality , but hints of similar spectral features were seen .",
    "the optical spectra seem to confirm our suggestion that the donors in these systems are c - o wds @xcite . the notion of a class of ultracompact lmxbs with neon - rich c - o wd donors",
    "is motivated by the definite detection of one such system , 4u  1626@xmath067 @xcite . however , not all ultracompact binaries are expected to have c - o donors .",
