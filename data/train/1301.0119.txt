    "to understand the role of space in ecological communities in which individuals compete for resources , kang and the author @xcite recently introduced a stochastic spatial model of producer - consumer systems on the lattice . based on their numerical simulations of this spatial model and their analytical results for its nonspatial deterministic mean - field approximation",
    ", they concluded that the inclusion of space drastically affects the outcome of such biological interactions .",
    "their results for the models with two species are reminiscent of the ones found in @xcite for the spatially explicit lotka - volterra model and in @xcite for a non mendelian diploid model : in the parameter region where the nonspatial model displays bistability , there is a dominant type that wins regardless of its initial density in the spatial model , while the inclusion of space also translates into a significant reduction of the parameter region where both species coexist . in the presence of three species ,",
    "other disagreements between the spatial and nonspatial models appear .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to give rigorous proofs of some of the results stated in @xcite for the stochastic spatial model with two species , which we now describe in detail .",
    "each point of the @xmath0-dimensional square lattice is occupied by exactly one individual which is characterized by one of two possible types , say type 1 and type 2 .",
    "each individual is thought of as a producer and consumer of resources , and we described the dynamics based on four parameters @xmath1 that denote the ability of an individual of type @xmath2 to consume the resource produced by an individual of type @xmath3 , that we call resource @xmath3 . to avoid degenerate cases",
    ", we also assume that each resource can be consumed by at least one type : @xmath4 .",
    "each individual dies at rate one , i.e. , the type at each vertex is updated at rate one , with the new type being chosen at random from a certain neighborhood according to probabilities proportional to the ability of the neighbors to consume the resource produced by the individual to be updated .",
    "more precisely , the state space consists of all functions @xmath5 that map the square lattice into the set of types @xmath6 and the dynamics are described by the markov generator @xmath7\\ ] ] where @xmath8 denotes the number of type @xmath2 neighbors @xmath9 and where the configuration @xmath10 is obtained from the configuration @xmath5 by assigning type @xmath2 to vertex @xmath11 and leaving the type of all the other vertices unchanged . to avoid cumbersome notations , we will write later @xmath12 to indicate that vertices @xmath11 and @xmath13 are neighbors , i.e. , @xmath14 the positive integer @xmath15 is referred to as the range of the interactions .",
    "the fraction in means that the conditional probability that the new type is chosen to be type @xmath2 given that vertex @xmath11 is of type @xmath3 at the time of an update is equal to the overall ability of the neighbors of type @xmath2 to consume resource @xmath3 divided by the overall ability of all the neighbors to consume resource @xmath3 . note that the assumption on the parameters , @xmath4 for @xmath16 , allows to define @xmath17 \\qquad \\hbox{and } \\qquad a_2 \\ : = \\ a_{22 } \\ ( a_{12 }",

    "note also that if one of the original parameters in equation is equal to zero then the denominator in @xmath19 may be equal to zero , in which case the numerator is equal to zero as well .",
    "when this happens , we have the following alternative and define as follows :    1 .   @xmath20 .",
    "in this case , motivated by the fact that there is no neighbor of type @xmath2 , we define the probability at which vertex @xmath11 becomes type @xmath2 to be zero .",
    "@xmath21 . in this case , motivated by the fact that there are only neighbors of type @xmath2 , we define the probability at which vertex @xmath11 becomes type @xmath2 to be one .",
    "we point out that , in addition to be the most natural from a biological point of view , the two assumptions above also make the transition probability continuous with respect to the parameters , which is a key to some of our proofs .      as pointed out in @xcite , one of the most interesting aspects of the spatial model",
    "is that it results in predictions that differ significantly from its nonspatial deterministic mean - field approximation , thus indicating that the spatial component plays a key role in these interactions .",
    "we recall that the mean - field model is obtained by assuming that the population is well - mixing , and refer to durrett and levin @xcite for more details .",
    "this assumption results in a system of coupled differential equations for the densities of each type , and since the densities sum up to one , the mean - field model of reduces to the one - dimensional system @xmath22 where @xmath23 denotes the density of type @xmath2 individuals .",
    "interestingly , the limiting behavior of the mean - field model depends on whether the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 are smaller or larger than one half , which has a biological interpretation in terms of altruism and selfishness . more precisely ,    1 .",
    "type @xmath2 is said to be * altruistic * whenever @xmath26 since in this case the resources it produces are more beneficial for the other type than for its own type , 2 .",
    "type @xmath2 is said to be * selfish * whenever @xmath27 since in this case the resources it produces are more beneficial for its own type than for the other type .",
    "the mean - field model has two trivial equilibria given by @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively . by setting the right - hand side of equation equal to zero and assuming , in order to study the existence of nontrivial interior fixed points , that the product @xmath30",
    ", we find @xmath31 from which it follows that @xmath32 is the unique fixed point that may differ from zero and one . to analyze the global stability of the fixed points , we observe that the sign of the derivative is given by @xmath33 which leads to the following three possible regimes for the mean - field model .",
    "+ 1  a selfish type always wins against an altruistic type .",
    "+    without loss of generality , we may assume that @xmath34 indicating that type 1 is altruistic whereas type 2 is selfish .",
    "in this case , the first line of equation implies that the derivative of @xmath35 is always negative when @xmath36 hence there is no fixed point in @xmath37 , and the trivial equilibrium @xmath38 is unstable while the trivial equilibrium @xmath39 is globally stable .",
    "+ 2  in the presence of two selfish types , the system is bistable . +    since @xmath40 and @xmath41 we have @xmath42 .",
    "the second line of equation implies that the derivative of @xmath35 has the same sign as @xmath43 so the interior fixed point is unstable and the boundary equilibria locally stable : the system converges to @xmath38 if the initial density of type 1 is strictly larger than @xmath44 , and to @xmath39 if the initial density of type 1 is strictly smaller than @xmath44 .",
    "+ 3  in the presence of two altruistic types , coexistence occurs .",
    "+    since @xmath45 and @xmath46 the fixed point @xmath44 again belongs to @xmath37 as in the presence of two selfish types .",
    "however , the second line in equation now implies that the derivative of @xmath35 has the same sign as @xmath47 so the interior fixed point is globally stable whereas the two boundary equilibria @xmath38 and @xmath39 are unstable .      in order to state our results for the spatial model",

    "type @xmath2 * survives * if starting from any configuration with infinitely many type @xmath2 , @xmath50 4 .   both types * coexist * if they both survive .    as pointed out above",
    ", the analytical results for the spatial and the nonspatial models differ in many aspects , which reveals the importance of the spatial component in the interactions .",
    "these disagreements are more pronounced in low dimensions and emerge when both types are selfish or both types are altruistic , while in the presence of one selfish type and one altruistic type the analytical results for both the spatial and nonspatial models agree .",
    "to begin with , we focus on the one - dimensional nearest neighbor process . in this case",
    ", one obtains a complete picture of the phase diagram based on a simple analysis of the interfaces of the process which almost evolve according to a system of annihilating random walks , whereas the more challenging study in higher dimensions and for larger ranges of interactions relies on very different techniques .",
    "we point out that the one - dimensional nearest neighbor process appears as a degenerate case in which coexistence is not possible while increasing the spatial dimension or the range of the interactions may result in coexistence of altruistic types .",
    " [ th : spatial-1d ] assume that @xmath51 . then ,    1 .   except for the case @xmath52 , the process clusters .",
    "assuming in addition that @xmath53 , type 2 wins .",
    "the exclusion of the case @xmath52 is simply due to the fact that , under this assumption , a vertex may flip to a new type if and only if all its neighbors already have this type , which implies that the process has infinitely many absorbing states . while in the absence of space",
    "one type wins regardless of the initial densities only in selfish - altruistic systems , theorem [ th : spatial-1d ] indicates that the most selfish / least altruistic type always wins in the one - dimensional nearest neighbor case .",
    "in particular , coexistence no longer occurs even in altruistic systems .",
    "although this case is pathological , it is also symptomatic of the general behavior of the spatial model for which the existence of a dominant type that always wins may occur even when both types are altruistic .",
    "the next result shows that , in any spatial dimension and for any dispersal range , selfish - altruistic interactions result in the same outcome in the spatial and nonspatial mean - field models .",
    " [ th : invasion ] assume that @xmath34 . then , type 2 wins .    even though its rigorous proof is not straightforward , the result is predictable since , when one type is selfish and the other type is altruistic , regardless of the type of the vertex to be updated and the spatial configuration , each of the selfish neighbors is individually more likely to be selected to determine the new type than each of the altruistic neighbors . in contrast , in the case of selfish - selfish interactions covered by theorem [ th : pure - birth ] below",
    ", the spatial and nonspatial models disagree in all dimensions and for all dispersal ranges .",
    "recall that in this case the mean - field model is bistable , indicating that the long - term behavior is determined by both the parameters and the initial densities .",
    "the next result shows on the contrary that , including local interactions , even if both types are selfish , enough asymmetry in the parameters implies that the most selfish type wins .     [ th : pure - birth ] for all @xmath54 there is @xmath55 such that type 2 wins when @xmath56 .",
    "numerical simulations in two dimensions indicate more generally that , when type 2 is selfish , it wins whenever @xmath53 . in the neutral case",
    ", the obvious symmetry of the evolution rules implies that none of the types wins , but simulations indicate that the population again clusters , with boundaries getting sharper as the common value of @xmath57 increases .",
    "this suggests that , in the presence of two selfish types , the long - term behavior of the one - dimensional nearest neighbor process occurs in two dimensions as well , a property that we believe is true in any spatial dimension and for any range of interactions .",
    "looking finally at altruistic - altruistic interactions , recall that coexistence always occurs in the mean - field approximation whereas the least altruistic type always wins in the one - dimensional nearest neighbor process .",
    "our last two results show that the long - term behavior of the process in higher spatial dimensions and/or for larger dispersal ranges is intermediate between these two extreme behaviors .    ",
    "[ th : coexistence ] for all @xmath58 , there is @xmath55 such that coexistence occurs when @xmath59    in words , sufficiently strong mutual altruism translates into coexistence of both types .",
    "numerical simulations of the two - dimensional system suggest in addition that two altruistic types coexist in the neutral case @xmath60 therefore the coexistence region of the spatial model stretches up to the parameter point corresponding to voter model interactions .",
    "interestingly , our last result shows that there exists a parameter region for which even altruistic types can not coexist , thus indicating that the inclusion of local interactions translates into a reduction of the coexistence region in general and not only in the one - dimensional nearest neighbor case .    ",
    "[ th : reduction ] there exists @xmath55 such that type 2 wins whenever @xmath61    we note that , even though the inclusion of local interactions always translate into a reduction of the coexistence region , numerical simulations indicate that this reduction becomes less pronounced while increasing the spatial dimension or the range of the interactions . the results for the mean - field model and spatial model when @xmath58 are summarized in figure [ fig : diagrams ] . in the phase diagram of the spatial model , the dashed regions are the ones that are covered by our theorems , while the thick lines are the critical curves suggested by simulations .",
    "for a detailed analysis of the nonspatial model and additional results based on numerical simulations for the spatial model in the presence of three species , we refer the reader to the companion paper @xcite .",
    "the rest of this paper is devoted to the proofs . to avoid cumbersome notations and messy calculations , we prove all our results , with the exception of theorem [ th : coexistence ] , when the range of the interactions is equal to one . however , we point out that all the techniques used in the proofs easily extend to larger dispersal ranges .",
    "the reason for excluding theorem [ th : coexistence ] from this rule is that it is the only result that shows a disagreement between the one - dimensional nearest neighbor case and the other cases , thus indicating that the range of the interactions plays a specific role in the presence of strong altruistic - altruistic interactions .",
    "this section is devoted to the proof of theorem [ th : spatial-1d ] which gives a complete picture of the long - term behavior of the one - dimensional process with nearest neighbor interactions . to begin with",
    ", we study the evolution in the non - neutral case , and look at the process starting with only type 2 individuals in an interval of length @xmath62 .",
    "the following lemma shows that the survival probability of the individuals of type 1 decreases exponentially with @xmath63 when @xmath53 .    ",

    "first , we observe that the process is attractive , which directly follows from the monotonicity of the probabilities in with respect to the fractions of neighbors of each type .",
    "in particular , it suffices to prove the result when starting with exactly @xmath62 individuals of type 2 . to understand how the number of type 2 vertices evolve ,",
    "let @xmath66 and assume that the neighbors of @xmath11 have different types .",
    "then , the rate at which vertex @xmath11 jumps from type 2 to type 1 is @xmath67 while the rate at which it jumps from type 1 to type 2 is @xmath68 in particular , as long as there are at least two individuals of type 2 , the number of such individuals performs a random walk that jumps to the right at rate @xmath69 and to the left at rate @xmath70 since , due to one - dimensional nearest neighbor interactions and the choice of the initial configuration , at all times the set of vertices of type 2 is an interval .",
    "moreover , on the event that type 2 survives , the leftmost vertex of type 2 converges almost surely to @xmath71 while the rightmost vertex of type 2 converges almost surely to @xmath72 , therefore the probability to be estimated is equal to the probability that the asymmetric random walk described above tends to infinity .",
    "the result then reduces to a standard estimate for asymmetric random walks .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath73 denote the number of individuals of type 2 after @xmath74 updates of the system , and let @xmath75 then , using a first - step analysis , for all @xmath76 we have @xmath77 where @xmath78 .",

    ", the proof reduces to the analysis of an auxiliary process that we shall call the interface process : the spin system @xmath88 defined on the translated lattice @xmath89 by setting @xmath90 in words , the process has a one at sites @xmath91 which are located between two vertices that have different types , and a zero at sites which are located between two vertices that have the same type , so the process keeps track of the interfaces of the spatial model .    ",
    "[ lem : extinction ] assume that @xmath51 and @xmath87 .",
    "then , the process clusters .",
    "thinking of each site @xmath91 as being occupied by a particle if @xmath92 and as empty otherwise , the idea of the proof is to establish almost sure extinction of this system of particles , which is equivalent to clustering of the spatial model .",
    "first , the proof of lemma [ lem : drift ] indicates that a vertex of either type , say type @xmath2 , changes its type    1 .   at rate one if none of its two nearest neighbors is of type @xmath2 , 2 .   at rate @xmath93 defined in and if its neighbors have different types .",
    "this induces the following dynamics for the interface process : a particle at site @xmath91 jumps to each of its empty nearest neighbors at rate @xmath94 and two particles distance one apart annihilate each other at rate one .",
    "more formally , the markov generator is given by @xmath95 \\\\",

    "since particles can only annihilate , the probability that a given site is occupied by a particle decreases in time so it has a limit when time goes to infinity . since in addition the evolution rules of the process are translation invariant , this limit does not depend on the site under consideration : @xmath101 in other respects , given any two particles alive at time @xmath102 , at some random time @xmath103 almost surely finite , either one of these particles is killed due to a collision with a third particle or both particles annihilate each other .",
    "the latter follows immediately from the fact that one - dimensional random walks are recurrent while each time two particles are distance one apart , there is a positive probability that they annihilate at their next jump when @xmath87 .",
    "this implies that the limit @xmath104 must equal zero , from which we conclude that @xmath105 for all @xmath106 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "this section is devoted to the proof of theorem [ th : invasion ] which states that , in the presence of altruistic - selfish interactions , the selfish type always wins .",
    "the proof is divided into four steps .",
    "the first step is to show that , under the assumptions of the theorem , the set of type 2 dominates its counterpart in a process that we shall call perturbation of the voter model . in particular , in order to establish the theorem , it suffices to prove that type 2 wins for this new process .",
    "the reason for introducing a perturbation of the voter model is that , contrary to process , it can be studied using duality techniques , and the second step of the proof is to describe its dual process in detail , while the third step is to construct selected dual paths that are key to proving that type 2 survives .",
    "finally , the fourth step combines these selected dual paths to a block construction in order to prove that not only type 2 survives but also type 1 goes extinct . before giving the details of the proof",
    ", we note that the third step will be used again in the proof of theorem [ th : reduction ] while the fourth step in the proof of both theorems [ th : pure - birth ] and [ th : reduction ] , but these two steps are detailed in this section only .",
    "we also point out that theorem [ th : invasion ] can be proved without the use of a block construction , but since it is needed in the proof of theorems [ th : pure - birth ] and [ th : reduction ] , we follow the same approach for all three theorems .",
    "we first observe that , under the assumptions of the theorem , there exists a constant @xmath55 fixed from now on such that @xmath107 in which case the set of type 2 for the spatial model dominates stochastically its counterpart in a certain perturbation of the voter model that we denote later by @xmath88 .",
    "the dynamics of this voter model perturbation depend on a single parameter : @xmath108 and can be described as follows . as in the original spatial model",
    ", the type at each vertex @xmath11 is updated at rate one , but the new type is now chosen according to the following rules :    1 .   with probability @xmath109 , the new type at vertex @xmath11 is chosen uniformly at random from the set of the nearest neighbors , 2 .   with the residual probability @xmath110 , the new type at vertex @xmath11 is chosen to be type 1 if all the nearest neighbors are of type 1 , and type 2 otherwise .",

    "@xmath315 , @xmath124 , is a breaking point if the next solid arrow pointing at either vertex @xmath11 or vertex @xmath13 we see going down the graphical representation is directed from @xmath11 to @xmath13 .",
    "we refer to the right - hand side of figure [ fig : dual ] for an example of realization of the graphical representation along with the breaking points which are represented with black dots .",
    "the reason for looking at breaking points is that they allow , as in the proof of theorem [ th : invasion ] , to construct selected dual paths with a drift towards regions void of type 1 individuals and thus to prove invasion of type 2 .",
    "this good property of the breaking points is expressed in the following lemma .",
    "assume that @xmath124 and let @xmath319 .",
    "then , @xmath320 from , we deduce that @xmath321 where the last implication follows from the evolution rules of the process .",
    "this proves the necessary condition .",
    "the sufficient condition is trivial and we point out that it is always true provided an arrow points at @xmath315 whereas the reverse holds because @xmath315 is a breaking point .",
    "+   + motivated by lemma [ lem : breaking ] , we now construct from the graphical representation a certain system of branching coalescing random walks that we shall call a dual process as it allows to obtain information about the type of a given vertex , say @xmath11 , at the current time , say @xmath141 , based on the configuration at earlier times . to define the dual process starting at @xmath131 , the first step is to remove from the graphical representation all the dashed arrows that point at a space - time point which is not a breaking point .",
    "then , we say that there is a dual path from @xmath131 down to @xmath132 , which we again write @xmath133 , whenever there are sequences of times and vertices @xmath134 such that the following two conditions hold :      we point out that condition 1 above must hold after removal of the dashed arrows that are not directed to a breaking point .",
    "the dual process starting at @xmath131 is the set - valued process @xmath322 see the right - hand side of figure [ fig : dual ] where the dual process is represented in thick lines .",
    "one of the keys to proving theorem [ th : reduction ] is the following duality relationship which is simply obtained by applying lemma [ lem : breaking ] at each of the breaking points that occurs along the dual process : @xmath323      to bound the probability that space - time point @xmath131 is of type 1 , we follow the same approach as in section [ sec : invasion ] and construct a process @xmath324 that keeps track of a specific particle in the dual process . recall that @xmath325 in addition , we let @xmath326 for @xmath327 , where @xmath328 and where @xmath63 is a scaling parameter that will be fixed later .",
    "the choice of @xmath127 will become clear in the proof of lemma [ lem : extend ] below .",
    "the dual path starts at @xmath329 . to construct this path at later times assuming that it is defined up to time @xmath102",
    ", we introduce @xmath330 for all @xmath155 , we set @xmath331 while at time @xmath157 we have the alternative :      in words , the process goes backwards in time down the graphical representation following the solid arrows from tip to tail except when a breaking point is encountered in which case the process crosses the arrow , either dashed or solid , that makes it closer to the hyperplane @xmath167 between the times @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "after time @xmath170 only the solid arrows are crossed .",
    "the process is thus embedded in the dual process which , together with the relationship , implies that @xmath335 motivated by condition , the next step is to prove the analog of lemma [ lem : target ] for this new selected dual path .",
    "more precisely , we have the following lemma .    ",
    "[ lem : extend ] let @xmath199^d$ ] .",
    "then , there exists @xmath336 such that @xmath337^d \\ \\hbox{for some } \\",
    "t < c_8 n \\ \\hbox{or } \\",
    "y_{c_8 n } ( x ) \\notin ( - n , n]^d ) \\",
    "c_9 \\,\\exp ( - \\gamma_9 \\sqrt n)\\ ] ] for suitable @xmath338 and @xmath339 , and all @xmath63 sufficiently large .      1 .",
    "there is a unique neighbor @xmath13 of vertex @xmath341 such that there is a solid arrow @xmath342 in the time interval @xmath343 , 2 .",
    "there is a unique solid arrow @xmath344 in the time interval @xmath345 , 3 .",
    "no other solid arrows point at @xmath341 or @xmath13 in the time interval @xmath346 .",
    "note that these three conditions imply that the dual path crosses exactly one breaking point between dual times @xmath183 and @xmath347 .",
    "moreover , a simple calculation shows that @xmath348 since in addition disjoint parts of the graphical representations are independent , it follows that the discrete - time process @xmath349 is a markov chain that satisfies @xmath350 for all @xmath351 .",
    "this is the analog of . in particular",
    ", the rest of the proof follows from the exact same arguments as in the proofs of lemmas [ lem : go]-[lem : target ] .",
    "to complete the proof , we let @xmath352 and declare site @xmath208 to be a good site whenever the following event occurs : @xmath281 \\",

    "this , together with the exact same arguments as in the proofs of lemmas [ lem : invasion ] and [ lem : dry ] , implies that type 2 wins for the process .",
    "finally , using the continuity of the transition rates with respect to the parameters and the same approach as in the proof of lemma [ lem : perturbation ] , we deduce the existence of @xmath55 small such that type 2 wins as well for the process when @xmath353 and @xmath354 .",
