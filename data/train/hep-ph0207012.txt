    "one of the most crucial questions to answer in the effort to understand chiral restoration in relativistic heavy - ion collisions as well as in dense medium as in compact stars is : what are the relevant _ effective _ degrees of freedom just before and after the phase transition ?",
    "the standard scenario , generally accepted in the community , is that the only relevant excitations in the broken symmetry sector near the phase transition are the pions , the pseudo - nambu - goldstone modes of broken chiral symmetry , i.e. , the standard chiral theory .",
    "however there is no a priori reason to exclude other scenarios .",
    "in fact , it has been argued by harada and yamawaki  @xcite that the vector manifestation ( vm ) with the massless ( in the chiral limit ) vector mesons can correctly describe chiral restoration . in a recent attempt to understand some of the puzzling results coming out of relativistic heavy ion experiments at rhic , brown and rho  @xcite invoked the vm scenario in which the  light \" @xmath12 mesons play a crucial role : the vector mesons there are  relayed \" via a higgsing to the gluons in the qcd sector .    in this paper",
    ", we address the issue of what the relevant degrees of freedom can be at the chiral transition induced by high temperature and their possible implications on observables in heavy - ion physics . in doing this , we focus on the vector and axial - vector susceptibilities and the pion velocity very near the critical temperature @xmath13 using the result obtained in @xcite who have shown that the vm holds at @xmath14 .",
    "the issue of what happens at high density is discussed in @xcite .    as a way of introduction to the main objective of this paper , we begin by briefly summarizing the arguments and results obtained in the standard chiral theory scenario  @xcite .",
    "consider the vector isospin susceptibility ( vsus ) @xmath0 ( denoted by ss as @xmath15 ) and the axial - vector isospin susceptibility ( asus ) @xmath1 ( denoted by ss as @xmath16 ) defined in terms of the vector charge density @xmath17 and the axial - vector charge density @xmath18 by the euclidean correlators : ^ab_v&= & ^1/t_0 dd^3v_0^a ( , ) v_0^b ( 0 , ) _",

    "we are interested in these sus s near the critical temperature @xmath14 at zero baryon density @xmath23 .",
    "in particular we would like to compute them  bottom - up \" approaching @xmath13 from below . in order to do this , we need to resort to effective field theory of qcd which requires identifying , in the premise of an eft , _ all _ the relevant degrees of freedom .",
    "let us first assume as done by son and stephanov ( ss )  @xcite that the only relevant effective degrees of freedom in heat bath are the pions , and that all other degrees of freedom can be integrated out with their effects incorporated into the coefficients of higher order terms in the effective lagrangian . here",
    "the basic assumption is that near chiral restoration , there is no instability in the channel of the degrees of freedom that have been integrated out . in this pion - only case ,",
    "the appropriate effective lagrangian for the axial correlators is the in - medium chiral lagrangian dominated by the current algebra terms , _eff=(_0 u_0 u^- v_^2_i u_i u^ ) -12 | m^u[la]+[leff ] where @xmath2 is the pion velocity , @xmath24 is the mass matrix introduced as an external field , @xmath25 is the chiral field and the covariant derivative @xmath26 is given by @xmath27 with @xmath28 the axial isospin chemical potential .",
    "the ellipsis stands for higher order terms in spatial derivatives and covariant derivatives .",
    "( see eq.([v2 rel ] ) ) where @xmath4 ( @xmath3 ) is the temporal ( spatial ) component of the pion decay constant . ]",
    "given the effective action described by ( [ leff ] ) with possible non - local terms ignored , then the asus takes the simple form _ a =- _eff|__a=0=f_^t^2 .",
    "the principal point to note here is that _ as long as the effective action is given by local terms ( subsumed in the ellipsis ) involving the @xmath25 field , this is the whole story _ :",
    "there is no other contribution to the asus than the temporal component of the pion decay constant .",
    "next one assumes that at the chiral phase transition point @xmath14 , the restoration of chiral symmetry dictates the equality _",
    "while there is no lattice information on @xmath1 , @xmath0 has been measured as a function of temperature  @xcite .",
    "in particular , it is established that _",
    "v|_t = t_c0 , which leads to the conclusion  @xcite that f_^t|_t = t_c0 . on the other hand",
    ", it is expected and verified by lattice simulations that the space component of the pion decay constant @xmath3 should vanish at @xmath14 .",
    "one therefore arrives at v_^2~f_^s / f_^t0 ,  tt_c .",
    "this is the main conclusion of the standard chiral theory .    to check whether this prediction is firm ,",
    "let us see what one obtains for the vsus in the same effective field theory approach .",
    "the effective lagrangian for calculating the vector correlators is of the same form as the asus , eq .",
    "( [ leff ] ) , except that the covariant derivative is now defined with the vector isospin chemical potential @xmath29 as @xmath30 .",
    "now if one assumes as done above for @xmath1 that possible non - local terms can be dropped , then the sus is given by _",
    "v =- _eff|__v=0 which can be easily evaluated from the lagrangian .",
    "one finds that _ v=0 while it is expected to be zero at @xmath31 , the vanishing @xmath0 for @xmath32 is at variance with the lattice data at @xmath14 .",
    "we now turn to the main objective of this paper : the prediction by the vector manifestation ( vm )  @xcite .",
    "basically the same scenario was suggested some time ago in conjunction with brown - rho scaling  @xcite . as will be shown in detail in the following sections , the vm _",
    "requires _ that the vector mesons figure on the same footing with the pions as _ the _ relevant degrees of freedom as the chiral transition point is approached from below .",
    "the key reason for this conclusion is that the chiral transition coincides with the vm fixed point at which the vector meson mass must vanish in the chiral limit  @xcite .",
    "this means that the vector - meson degrees of freedom _ can not _ be integrated out near chiral restoration .",
    "our principal results - which are basically different from the standard chiral theory scenario - can be summarized as follows . in the presence of the @xmath12-meson , the only approach that is consistent with chiral perturbation theory is the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) with the vm fixed point  -meson mass is considered as of the same chiral order as the pion mass . in hls theory , this condition is naturally met by the @xmath12-meson mass near the chiral transition point , so chiral perturbation theory should be more effective in this regime .",
    "this point that underlines our arguments that follow justifies our one - loop calculation . ] .",
    "the present analysis based on this theory predicts   deviates from 1 will be explained below . ]",
    "f_^t _ t = t_c= f_^s _ t = t_c=0  , .",
    "v__t = t_c 1 [ main1 ] and @xmath33 where we have included the normalization factor of @xmath34 .",
    "note that the equality of @xmath1 and @xmath0 at @xmath14 is an output of the theory .",
    "this result is a direct consequence of the fact that the @xmath12 and @xmath35 enter on the same footing in the vm : at the vm fixed point , the longitudinal components of the vector mesons and the pions form a degenerate multiplet .",

    "however , as discussed in appendix  [ ssec : itdbp ] , such lorentz symmetry violating contributions caused from the lorentz non - scalar operators are suppressed by , at least , a factor of @xmath74 compared with @xmath75 , and the lorentz violating effects in the bare @xmath35 decay constant and the bare @xmath42 ( longitudinal @xmath12 ) decay constant are small : at bare level , the difference between @xmath76 and @xmath77 as well as that between @xmath78 and @xmath79 is small .",

    "the small deviation from 1 is also found in dense skyrmion matter studied in @xcite .    if one assumes that the only light degrees of freedom near @xmath13 are the pions , then one can simply take the current algebra terms in the lagrangian and the axial - vector susceptibility ( asus ) @xmath1 is uniquely given by the temporal component of the pion decay constant @xmath4 with the degrees of freedom that are integrated out renormalizing this constant .",
    "then the unquestionable equality @xmath268 at @xmath13 together with the lattice result @xmath269 leads to the son - stephanov result on the pion velocity @xmath270 .",
