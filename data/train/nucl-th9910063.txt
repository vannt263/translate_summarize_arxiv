    "one difficulty for standard treatments of hadronic reactions is that form factors are introduced at hadronic vertices in order to regulate integrals which would otherwise be divergent .",

    "methods which impose gauge invariance on an amplitude containing hadronic form factors have been formulated,@xcite but they are intrinsically non - unique , since they constrain only the longitudinal part of the photon s coupling to the hadronic system .    some of these difficulties can be resolved by using dimensional regularization ( dr)@xcite to render divergent integrals finite . this is the method of choice for dealing with the infinities which arise in perturbative field theoretic calculations . however , there are very few studies of the application of dimensional regularization to integral equations . one notable exception is the recent application of dr to a schwinger - dyson equation in quenched qed by schreiber _",

    "we consider one member of the class of potentials in which one subtraction at a fixed energy results in a finite integral equation at all energies . the potential we choose is separable and so provides a toy problem where the renormalized amplitude can be derived algebraically in a straightforward way .",
    "the amplitude thereby obtained can then be compared with that found by the numerical solution of the dimensionally - regulated integral equation .",
    "we will show that with careful numerical work the phase shifts obtained via these two different methods are in excellent agreement with each other .",

    "numerical dimensional regularization and renormalization \" facilitates the extraction of finite phase shifts from a particular class of divergent potentials .    in sec .",
    "[ sec2 ] we outline the general framework for implementing dimensional regularization and renormalization techniques numerically in the ls equation .",
    "we show how the ls equation can be analytically continued to lower numbers of dimensions , @xmath0 , thus ameliorating the divergences which appear in three dimensions .",
    "the application of a renormalization condition at one energy in @xmath1 dimensions can then lead to an amplitude which is finite at all energies in this lower number of dimensions , and thence to an amplitude which is well - defined as the limit @xmath2 is taken . in sec .",
    "[ sec3 ] the special case of a separable potential , which leads to a divergent amplitude as @xmath3 is considered .",
    "we obtain the amplitude for this potential for @xmath4 . renormalizing the amplitude by demanding that the binding energy of the deuteron be reproduced leads to a divergence in the inverse of the  bare \" coupling which appears in the original separable potential .",
    "we show that in dr this divergence goes as @xmath5 .",
    "we then observe that for this particular potential , it is not necessary to use dr , since the problem can be subtractively renormalized .",
    "that is to say , a subtraction at one energy , which can be carried out algebraically , renders the amplitude finite at all energies .",
    "however , it is not generally true that such algebraic renormalization of an integral equation is possible .",
    "therefore , in section  [ sec4 ] the general renormalization procedure of section  [ sec2 ] is applied directly to the ls equation in @xmath6 dimensions . in this approach no subtraction",
    "is carried out , and no assumption is made about the form of the potential .",
    "first , the ls equation is solved numerically in @xmath7 dimensions .",

    "dimensional regularization is often used to identify the infinities encountered in perturbative calculations  @xcite .",
    "the procedure involves replacing integrals that are infinite in @xmath10 dimensions by the same integrals in a lower dimension @xmath11 , where they have a finite result .",
    "the function defining this integral , say @xmath12 , can then be analytically continued back to @xmath10 dimensions . in this way",
    "the logarithmic singularities of @xmath13 can be isolated and then renormalized by adjusting the bare parameters of the theory .",
    "this is the method of choice for dealing with the infinities which arise in perturbative quantum field theory calculations , but it has not been widely applied to non - perturbative integral equations that contain divergences .",
    "it was used in the lippmann - schwinger equation for a divergent potential in refs .",
    "@xcite , but in the cases considered there the amplitude can be derived analytically . in the case of a general divergent potential , this will not be possible , and dr must be implemented numerically . recently ,",
    "schreiber _ et al . _",
    "@xcite have demonstrated the feasibility of such a procedure , successfully employing dr in the numerical solution of a divergent four - dimensional schwinger - dyson equation for the electron mass in quenched qed . in this section",
    "we explain how to adapt the methods of schreiber _ et al . _ for use in the three - dimensional lippmann - schwinger equation .    given a potential @xmath14",
    "the momentum - space ls equation for the scattering amplitude @xmath15 for two particles of mass @xmath16 is :    @xmath17    where @xmath18 is a positive infinitesimal .",

    "it follows that @xmath14 and @xmath15 can be expanded using the eigenfunctions of the rotation operator in @xmath6 dimensions , thus reducing eq .",

    "@xcite ) .    here",
    "we follow a slightly different approach .",
    "although the lippmann - schwinger equation is nominally a three - dimensional integral equation , in most instances it is written and solved as a one - dimensional integral equation for a given partial wave @xmath24 . in other words , making the expansion :    @xmath25    and an equivalent expansion for @xmath14 , leads , as is well - known , to the one - dimensional integral equation :    @xmath26    to dimensionally - regulate _ this _ equation is much easier , since the angular part of the problem has already been dealt with in the original number of dimensions , in this case , three .",
    "it only involves replacing the measure appropriate to three dimensions , by one for @xmath27 dimensions , i.e.    @xmath28    it is worth pointing out here that if the partial - wave expansion ( [ eq:2.0.2 ] ) is carried out in @xmath1 dimensions , rather than in three dimensions , then the potential @xmath29 ends up depending on @xmath9 as well as @xmath24 .",

    "choosing to dimensionally regularize the partial - wave - expanded equation , rather than the full three - dimensional equation , may be unfamiliar to those used to dr in perturbative settings , but it is justified .",

    "the next step is to renormalize it . to that end",
    "we pick one of the parameters of the potential , e.g. its strength , which we denote by @xmath31 , and regard it as a function of @xmath9 , @xmath32 .",
    "a renormalization condition is then chosen .",
    "this can be represented as the demand that the amplitude , @xmath33 , have some specified value at a particular kinematic point .",
    "for instance , we might demand that the amplitude has a pole at @xmath34 , so that a bound state exists at that energy .",
    "such a renormalization condition implicitly defines the function @xmath35 .",

    "this will certainly give finite results for @xmath4 , provided that @xmath9 is big enough .",
    "furthermore , if it is enough to renormalize only the strength of the potential , such a calculation will produce finite values for the on - shell amplitude and hence for the phase shift even in the limit @xmath3 .",
    "this  numerical renormalization \" program has been carried out before in the lippmann - schwinger equation with other regulators ( see , e.g.  @xcite ) , but here we will implement it for dr .    in the next section",
    "we illustrate how this numerical renormalization proceeds in the case of a simple separable potential .",
    "we show that the strength of the potential can always be adjusted so that the potential supports a bound state with energy @xmath34 .",

    "<S> dimensional regularization is applied to the lippmann - schwinger equation for a separable potential which gives rise to logarithmic singularities in the born series . for this potential a subtraction at a fixed energy </S>",
    "<S> can be used to renormalize the amplitude and produce a finite solution to the integral equation for all energies . </S>",
    "<S> this can be done either algebraically or numerically . in the latter case dimensional regularization </S>",
    "<S> can be implemented by solving the integral equation in a lower number of dimensions , fixing the potential strength , and computing the phase shifts , while taking the limit as the number of dimensions approaches three . </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate that these steps can be carried out in a numerically stable way , and show that the results thereby obtained agree with those found when the renormalization is performed algebraically to four significant figures .    </S>",
