    "the large scale behaviour of randomly stirred fluids was originally studied by forster , nelson and stephen ( fns ) @xcite .",
    "they used a dynamic renormalization procedure to explore the effects of the progressive removal of small ( length ) scales in a perturbative model under several types of forcing .",
    "as they note , their study is only valid at the smallest momentum scales , and as such the study is well below the momentum scale of the inertial range @xcite .",
    "later , the procedure used by fns was extended by yakhot & orszag ( yo ) @xcite to a more general forcing spectrum ( of which the studies of fns were special cases ) and used to calculate the energy spectrum and a value for the kolmogorov constant in the inertial region . while their arguments allowing them to calculate inertial range properties are contested @xcite , these issues are not the main focus of this paper .",
    "instead , we will concentrate on another disagreement related to the results for the renormalized viscosity and noise . in the papers of fns @xcite and yo @xcite ,",
    "the authors calculate the viscosity increment , quantifying the effect of the removed subgrid scales on the super - grid scales .",
    "they find the prefactor @xmath2 ( from @xcite , with fns in agreement for their specific cases of study ) .",
    "the disagreement is centred around the use of a certain change of variables employed by fns and yo .",
    "this substitution has been highlighted as a cause for concern ( for example , @xcite ) , since navely the symmetric domain of integration appears to be shifted , violating conditions for the identities used to be valid .",
    "using methods that do not introduce any substitution , again for a general forcing spectrum , wang & wu ( ww ) @xcite and teodorovich @xcite arrive at a different , incompatible result for the viscosity increment .",
    "instead , they find the prefactor @xmath3 .",
    "this @xmath4-free result is also used in the more field - theoretic work of adzhemyan _ et al .",
    "later , nandy @xcite attempted to determine which of the results was correct using a `` symmetrization argument '' and agreed with the original ( general forcing ) result by yo .",
    "the method used by fns and yo has found wide - ranging application , for example in soft matter systems , such as the kpz and burgers equations @xcite , and the coupled equations of magnetohydrodynamics @xcite . given the extensive use of this approach , it is unsatisfactory to have any lingering disagreement on the basic methodology .",
    "the aim of this paper is , therefore , to settle this dispute once and for all .",
    "there can not be two different results for the same quantity .",
    "we will show that an extra constraint mentioned by fns causes the elimination band not to be shifted , and that for substitution - free methods there are neglected boundary terms .",
    "these are evaluated and shown to compensate exactly the difference between @xmath5 and @xmath6 .",
    "we then show how correct treatment does not require a symmetrization to obtain the yakhot - orszag result .",
    "in addition to renormalization of the viscosity , there is also renormalization of the noise .",
    "all treatments consider an input noise that is gaussian with the forcing spectrum parametrized as @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the wavenumber associated with the force . at one - loop order each of the two vertices will have a factor of the inflowing momentum , thus leading to a @xmath9 contribution to the forcing spectrum .",
    "both fns and yo acknowledge this @xmath9 correction . in fns",
    "they treat two specific cases , @xmath10 and @xmath11 . in the former ,",
    "they find a renormalization to @xmath12 whereas , in the latter , they conclude that all higher order corrections are subleading .",
    "yo restrict their analysis to @xmath13 and once again conclude all higher order corrections are subleading .",
    "we explicitly show how the leading contribution will always go as @xmath9 and as such can only be taken as an multiplicative renormalization for the case @xmath14 , as noted in @xcite .",
    "we find the prefactor agrees with @xmath15 found by fns and yo ( with @xmath14 ) and show it to be incompatible with the @xmath4-independent @xmath16 .",
    "another author , ronis @xcite , calculates the viscosity and noise renormalization using a field - theoretic approach .",
    "his analysis agrees with fns and yo for @xmath14 , although appears to be presented for general @xmath17 . as we will argue in sec .",
    "[ sec : renorm_cond ] , this seems unjustified as the noise is only renormalized for the case @xmath14 .",
    "the paper is organised as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : discuss ] , we give a brief discussion on the validity and limitation of this type of low-@xmath8 renormalization scheme for a fluid system . in sec .",
    "[ sec : calculation ] our calculation for viscosity renormalization is done and then in sec .",
    "[ sec : renorm_cond ] for noise renormalization , along with comparison with other analyses .",
    "the results are summarised in table [ tbl : summary ] . finally , in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusion ] , we present our conclusions along with a brief discussion of the relevance of this type of renormalization scheme for calculating inertial range quantities .",
    "we start with a brief discussion on the region of validity of this method and its limitations .",
    "turbulence is often viewed as an energy cascade , where energy enters large length scales in the production range and is progressively transferred to smaller and smaller scales , until viscous effects dominate and it is dissipated as heat .",
    "there must be a balance between the energy dissipated and the energy transferred through the intermediate scales , otherwise energy would build up and the turbulence would not remain statistically steady .",
    "thus the dissipation rate , @xmath18 , controls how small the smallest length scales need to be to successfully remove the energy passed down , giving the kolmogorov scale @xmath19 .",
    "when the reynolds number is sufficiently large , there exists a range of intermediate scales where the energy flux entering a particular length scale from ones larger than it is the same as that leaving it to smaller ones and is thus not dependent on the wavenumber .",
    "this is the inertial range",
    ".     introduced by fns in their ir study of randomly stirred flows takes you to the fixed point at @xmath20 .",

    "[ fig : energy_spectrum ] ( based on a similar figure in @xcite ) . in the rg approach , the smallest length scales ( largest wavenumber scales @xmath8 ) are removed and an effective theory is obtained from the remaining scales .",
    "there is high- and low - energy asymptotic freedom since the renormalized coupling becomes weak in both limits @xcite .",
    "the dynamic rg method used by fns introduces a momentum cutoff @xmath24 well below the dissipation momentum scale , below the inertial range even ( see figure [ fig : energy_spectrum ] ) , in the production range and removes momentum scales towards @xmath25 . as such",
    ", this method can only ever account for the behaviour on the largest length scales .",
    "the production range is highly dependent on the method of energy input , and so it is obvious that the properties of the lowest modes will also share this dependence .",
    "taking the forcing to be gaussian then allows gaussian perturbation theory to be used , since the lowest order is simply the response to this forcing . since the inertial range is highly non - gaussian , we do not expect to study the inertial region with this analysis .",
    "an alternative rg scheme called iterative averaging ( mccomb @xcite ) instead takes a cutoff @xmath26 and removes successive shells of wavenumbers down to a non - gaussian fixed point @xmath22 , which marks the beginning of a line of fixed points following @xmath23 through the inertial region ( see figure [ fig : energy_spectrum ] ) .",
    "the asymptotic nature of this method therefore can not tell us anything about the forcing spectrum , and is only dependent on the rate at which energy is given to the system .",
    "no assumptions about gaussian behaviour are made .    using the energy spectrum ( figure [ fig : energy_spectrum ] ) ,",
    "we see the location of the ir procedure of fns / yo and how it is inapplicable for the calculation of inertial range statistics . put simply , it does not have access to the inertial range , just as iterative averaging does not have access to the production range .",

    "we see that as @xmath108 ( the triangles shrink to their vertical baselines ) the overlap increases and the resultant shifted shell is well approximated by the original , unshifted shell ( @xmath101 ) , as found in equation ( [ eq : shell_shift]).,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    we now turn our attention to the substitution @xmath109 made by fns and yo , under which our constraints become @xmath110 taylor expansion of these high - pass filters is now @xmath111 + { \\mathcal",

    "hence we have shown that a more careful consideration of the region of integration used by wang & wu instead leads to the result found by fns and then later yo . the approach taken by teodorovich @xcite uses a different method for evaluating the angular part of the self - energy integral .",

    "that said , some comments should be made on the application of this method to calculating inertial range statistics , which may not be so well justified . despite its applicability only on the largest of length scales , yakhot & orszag use the expressions obtained with this infra - red procedure to calculate inertial range properties @xcite , such as the kolmogorov constant .",
    "to do this , they use a set of assumptions that they term the _ correspondence principle_.    briefly , the correspondence principle states that an unforced system which started from some initial conditions with a developed inertial range is statistically equivalent to a system forced in such a way as to generate the same scaling exponents . in particular",
    "if forcing is introduced to generate the scaling exponents at low @xmath8 , this artificially generated `` inertial range '' can then be used to calculate values for various inertial range parameters using the properties of universality .",
    "there is an implicit assumption that , as long as the scaling exponents match , all other quantities will also match .",
    "this may be the reason that yo raise the cutoff @xmath24 out of the production range to @xmath190 ( see above equation ( 2.2 ) in @xcite ) so that the renormalization passes through the inertial range , whereas fns explicitly consider @xmath46 ( final paragraph of their section ii.a ) .",

    "this fixed point is at @xmath201 to leading order in @xmath4 , or @xmath202 when evaluated to all orders . *",
    "as shown by figure [ fig : energy_spectrum ] , the asymptotic nature of this renormalization scheme taking us to the infra - red means we do nt enter the inertial range , and are always sensitive to the forcing spectrum . *",

    "the condition of galilean invariance ( gi ) used by fns and adopted by yo to enforce the non - renormalization of the vertex at all orders is actually only valid at @xmath20 @xcite . in general , the consequences of gi are trivial and provide no constraint on the vertex @xcite .",
    "this is supported by recent numerical results @xcite from a kpz model on a discretized lattice with a broken gi symmetry , which have found the same critical exponents as the actual kpz model ( which does possess gi ) @xcite , even though gi has been explicitly violated .",
    "this questions the connection between gi and the scaling relations associated with the critical exponents .",
    "as such , care must be taken when extending this theory to @xmath211 .",
    "this introduces another issue for the study of inertial range properties using the correspondence principle , as @xmath8 can not be chosen to lie in the inertial range without the vertex being renormalized . * the assumed gaussian lowest - order behaviour of the fluid is only valid at the smallest wavenumbers when subject to gaussian forcing , since the response of the system is then also gaussian .",
    "however , this assumption can not be translated to the inertial range , which should be insensitive to the details of the energy input and is inherently non - gaussian @xcite .",
    "the need to use two different values for @xmath4 in the same formula to estimate inertial range properties is therefore not the only failure of this scheme .",
    "the solution for the renormalized viscosity at the largest scales ( @xmath212 ) can be found to behave as @xmath213 where @xmath214 is the new cut off . with the assumption",
    "@xmath192 , interestingly this does have the same form as that found by other methods ( e.g. @xcite ) , that the viscosity is proportional to @xmath215 and , with @xmath194 , the cut off @xmath216 .",
    "however , there is an important difference : the cut off @xmath217 is going to zero for this expression to hold , which is not the location of the inertial range , unlike the iterative averaging approach by mccomb @xcite .",

    "although rescaling the variables after performing an iteration of the renormalization procedure outlined above is not performed in the calculation of the renormalized viscosity ( and thus it can be argued not to be an rg procedure @xcite ) , it is still useful to consider how the rescaling would affect the equations of motion . using a scaling factor , @xmath218 ,",
