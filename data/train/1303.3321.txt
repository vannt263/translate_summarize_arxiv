    "evidence of magnetic reconnection and current sheets on the sun has been observed in various situations and wavelengths .",
    "a major advance in the last decade was the discovery of a second coronal source above a commonly observed loop - top source in x - rays and radio wavelengths .",
    "such double sources often exhibit higher - energy emission being closer to each other , indicating higher temperatures or harder spectra of accelerated electrons in the inner region nearer to the presumable magnetic reconnection site .",
    "another surprise has been the descent of the loop - top x - ray source at typically 10@xmath2 early in the impulsive phase before its common ascent through the decay phase .",
    "the upper coronal source , however , usually keeps ascending all the time .",
    "shrinkages of entire flare loops @xcite at speeds on the order of @xmath3 have been observed in soft x - rays ( sxrs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , extreme ultraviolet , and microwaves .",
    "they were interpreted as contractions of newly reconnected loops due to magnetic tension as they evolve from initially cusp shapes toward more relaxed round shapes .",
    "often after the impulsive phase , bright loops and dark voids seen in sxr or euv descend onto a flare arcade from above at greater speeds of typically 150@xmath4 . at even greater heights of a few @xmath5 ,",
    "similar descending loops are seen in white - light coronagraphs , usually hours after a coronal mass ejection .",
    "these features are also interpreted as contracting post - reconnection loops , but their observed speeds are only a small fraction of the expected coronal speed on the order of @xmath6@xmath7 .",
    "imaging and doppler observations have also revealed bi - directional magnetic reconnection inflows @xcite , outflows , or both @xcite .    the physics behind descending x - ray loop - top sources and their relationship with slow loop shrinkages , fast supra - arcade loop contractions , and reconnection outflows remain unclear , although some models have been proposed .",
    "to fill this gap , we present here observations of a recent eruptive m7.7 flare from the _ reuven ramaty high energy solar spectroscopic imager _ (; * ? ? ? * ) and _ solar dynamics observatory _ atmospheric imaging assembly ( /aia ; * ? ? ?",
    "we find in this flare all the above interrelated phenomena , which can be understood in a unified picture as contractions of post - reconnection loops modulated by the interplay between energy release and cooling .",
    "the observed highest speed of @xmath6@xmath7 of loop contractions is comparable to the expected speed .",
    "the maximum temperature and nonthermal loop - top emission being away from the inferred reconnection site suggest that primary heating and particle acceleration take place in the outflow regions , rather than the reconnection site itself .    after an observational overview in , we present motions of the overall x - ray and euv emission in .",

    "this configuration then gradually evolves for hours and finally becomes unstable , initiating the later , _ eruptive _ m7.7 flare , when the flux rope is expelled as a fast cme of @xmath12@xmath7 .",

    "not predicted in that picture is the initial upward growth of the cusp followed by its rapid downward shrinkage around the early impulsive phase , prior to another , expected upward growth through the decay phase in a commonly observed candle - flame shape ( ( a)(l ) ) .",
    "the initial growth and shrinkage are accompanied by the gradual rise and impulsive eruption of the overlying flux rope , respectively .",
    "equally interesting are high - speed bi - directional outflows involving upward - moving plasmoids and downward - contracting pointed cusps ( , bottom ; ) .",
    "we examine these and related features observed by and aia in next several sections .",

    "we reconstructed x - ray images in energy bands from 3 to 50  kev using the clean algorithm and detectors 39 .",
    "depending on the count rate , we chose variable integration time ranging from 20  s during the impulsive phase to 4  minutes during the decay phase . and its accompanying movie show examples of contours overlaid on aia images .",
    "there is a persistent loop - top source at 610  kev ( green ) near the apex of the cusp - shaped euv loops .",
    "accompanying the evolution of the euv loops mentioned above , this loop - top source undergoes a gradual ascent followed by a descent and then another ascent .",
    "this can be best seen in the last panel showing the temporal migration of the emission centroid obtained from a contour at 70% of the maximum of each image .",
    "early descents of loop - top x - ray sources have been recognized ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but this is the first time that an evident preceding ascent is observed .",
    "early in the event there is an additional , weaker coronal x - ray source ( panel ( b ) ) located in the lower portion of the overlying flux rope .",
    "it later falls below detection with the eruption of the flux rope . during the impulsive phase ( panel ( e ) ) at higher energies ( 2550  kev ) , there are double footpoint sources and a masuda - type ( * ? ? ?",
    "? * e.g. , ) coronal source located @xmath13 above the sxr ( 610  kev ) loop - top .",
    "this separation is twice that of the masuda case .",
    "the earlier c4.5 flare ( panel ( a ) ) , though more compact , exhibits surprisingly similar emission , including the additional x - ray source within the flux rope and the masuda - type hard x - ray ( hxr ) source .",
    "this suggests that the end state of the first , confined flare of a failed eruption serves as the initial state of the second , eruptive flare , making them homologous flares .",
    "note that the weaker , southern footpoint emission is ( partially ) occulted by the limb , especially for the first flare .",
    "to track various moving features , we placed eight cuts of @xmath14 wide centered on the limb , as shown in ( f ) .",
    "cut  0 is positioned along the presumable current sheet between the initial flare cusp and erupting flux rope , and is used as the fiducial line for obtaining projected heights up to @xmath608:00  ut .",
    "subsequent cuts are evenly spaced by @xmath15 to capture the cusp at different stages as it gradual turns toward the south . for each cut , we averaged pixels of an aia image sequence within it in the perpendicular direction to obtain a space - time plot .",

    "for example , at its greatest height prior to the impulsive phase , the 1625  kev centroid is @xmath31 above its 335    counterpart .",
    "this energy dispersion is consistent with previous observations and in line with the expected picture that higher loops are newly energized and thus are hotter and/or host nonthermal electrons of harder spectra , while lower loops are previously energized and have undergone cooling .",
    "we suggest that the so - called above - the - loop - top masuda - type sources , including the 2550  kev coronal source in ( d ) , could be extreme cases of this general trend .",
    "in , we list the initial heights of x - ray and euv loop - top centroids around 04:35  ut , together with the maximum and minimum heights during their descents and the percentage height reductions . in general , the above noted energy dispersion persists and the 1020% descents are in agreement with earlier reports .",
    "an exception is the 193 and 304    channels because of their response to both hot and cool emissions ( see appendix  a ) .",
    "there is a weak trend that higher energy x - ray descents start ( at the maximum heights ) later , but still within 5  minutes during 05:0205:07  ut , and x - ray descents end ( at the minimum heights ) earlier than euv descents by up to 10  minutes .",
    "we measured the average velocities of the loop - top centroids by fitting a piecewise linear function to the height - time data during their initial ascent , subsequent descent , and second ascent stages .",
    "as listed on the right hand side of , the result shows a general trend of higher velocities at higher energies .",
    "the x - ray descents of @xmath20 to @xmath32 are about twice faster than the euv descents except for 193    because of its dual temperature response .",
    "there is also a gradual decrease in velocity with time during the second ascent stage through the decay phase .",
    "these trends generally agree with previous observations .    to follow the temporal variations of the loop - top velocities , we took time derivatives of spline fits to the centroid heights of selected channels .",
    "the resulting velocities vs.  time are shown in ( c ) for the 610 & 1016  kev and 131 & 94    channels .",
    "the outstanding feature is that the maximum descent velocities ( also tabulated in ) in the range of @xmath9 to @xmath10 are all attained during 05:1505:20  ut , near the onset of the impulsive phase at 05:16  ut marked by a vertical dashed line .",
    "this time is delayed from the initial descent by about 10  minutes .",
    "this indicates that the loop - top descent velocity , rather than its height , is more intimately correlated with the energy release rate .",
    "we also show in ( e ) the centroid heights of the upper coronal x - ray source located in the lower portion of the flux rope .",
    "a parabolic fit indicates a final velocity of @xmath33 at 04:50  ut , comparable to or slower than those in other events @xcite .",
    "it is also 50% slower than the middle portion of the then accelerating flux rope , as indicated by the parabolic fit in ( e ) , which reaches @xmath34 later at 05:07  ut near the edge of aia s fov .",
    "the conjugate footpoints at 2550  kev during the impulsive phase move away from each other at an average velocity of @xmath35 ( see ( e ) ) , almost identical to the velocity of the simultaneous loop - top ascent ( see ) .",
    "this is consistent with previous observations @xcite and the classical picture of eruptive flares during the arcade growth phase .",
    "we now turn our attention to the bi - directional plasma outflows observed by aia .",
    "as shown in and its accompanying movie , emission features move both upward and downward from above the cusp - shaped flare loops .",
    "the upward outflows , observed only when the flux rope rises toward its eruption , are mainly bright blobs ( interpreted as plasmoids , top row ) , while the downward outflows are primarily in the form of retracting cusp - shaped loops ( bottom row ) observed throughout the event well into the decay phase . among the downward retracting loops , those seen at low altitudes tend to have lower speeds ( @xmath36@xmath37 ) and gradually decelerate when approaching and piling up onto the apex of the flare arcade , while those originating from high altitudes tend to have higher speeds ( @xmath38@xmath39 ) and decelerate more rapidly .",
    "according to these observational distinctions , we call the former _ slow loop shrinkages _ and the latter _ fast loop contractions _ , although they might share a common physical origin as discussed in .",
    "the former are likely analogous to shrinkages observed at sxr and other wavelengths @xcite , while the latter , especially those occurring after the flare arcade has formed , are likely so - called supra - arcade downflow loops savages.mckenzied.sa.downflow.stat.2011apj...730...98s",
    ".    to track these moving features , we obtained space - time plots from the cuts defined in ( f ) using the 131  channel because it provides the best coverage of these features .",
    "we then applied running ratio , namely , dividing the intensity profile at each time by its previous neighbor , which highlights moving features as intensity tracks ( see , e.g. , ( d ) ) .",
    "we exhaustively identified such tracks of more than @xmath14 long corresponding to unique moving features .",
    "if one feature is captured by multiple cuts , we included only the most complete track .",
    "following @xcite , we fitted the projected height @xmath40 of each track by a function of time @xmath41 , h(t)= h_0 + v_t t + a_0 ^2 ( e^-t/ - 1 ) , [ hfit.eq ] which gives the instantaneous velocity v(t ) = v_t - a_0 e^-t/ , [ vfit.eq ] and acceleration a(t ) = a_0 e^-t/ , [ afit.eq ] where @xmath42 and @xmath43 are the initial height and acceleration , @xmath44 is the terminal velocity , and @xmath45 is the @xmath46-folding decay time that characterizes the observed decreasing acceleration ( or deceleration ) with time .",
    "we present below the kinematics of the features categorized above and focus on their initial velocities @xmath47 and accelerations @xmath43",
    ".      shows kinematic measurements of the slow loop shrinkages .",
    "these loops traverse a hot ( up to @xmath48 ; see ) loop - top region , which is bright only in the hottest channels of 193 , 131 , and 94   , and descend toward the apex of the flare arcade seen in cooler channels , where they fade below detection ( see ) .",
    "they generally start at a low velocity with a median of @xmath49 ( @xmath50 for upward / downward ) and decelerate to typically @xmath51 within 0.52.5 h. their median initial deceleration is @xmath52 .",
    "such shrinkages are persistent throughout the flare , not only during the decay phase when the overall loop - top emission develops upward as previously observed @xcite , but also during the pre - impulsive and impulsive phases when the loop - top undergoes its initial ascent and subsequent descent .",
    "50 shrinkages are identified during 04:0016:00  ut with an average occurrence rate of once per 7.7  minutes up to 10:00  ut but more frequent around the impulsive phase ( ( b ) ) .",
    "regardless of the direction of motion of the loop - top emission , the initial height of loop shrinkage generally increases with time . the initial velocity @xmath53 exhibits more variability , as shown in ( c ) , and appears to be positively correlated with the flare energy release rate indicated by the time derivative of the flux ( black dotted line ) .",
    "in particular , near the onset of the impulsive phase at 05:16  ut ( vertical dashed line ) , @xmath53 increases rapidly and reaches a maximum of @xmath8 .",
    "there is a similar temporal correlation with the initial deceleration @xmath43 ( panel ( d ) ) that also generally correlates with @xmath53 .",
    "shows , in the same form as , kinematic measurements of fast downward loop contractions as well as upward plasmoid ejections that will be examined in .",
    "we color - code fits to tracks of different categories : upward ejections in _ red _ and downward contractions in cooler colors . for the latter , we use",
    "_ green _ for early contractions that occur simultaneously with upward ejections and originate from lower heights @xmath54 , and _ blue _ for later contractions that occur without observed upward counterparts ( possibly out of aia s fov , after the flux rope has erupted ) and originate from greater heights @xmath55 .",
    "we identified 29 green tracks and 174 blue tracks during 04:0016:00  ut .",
    "as shown in ( c ) , the fast downward contractions , especially those later blue - colored ones , start well above the hot loop - top region and travel into it with deceleration for some distance before fading below detection .",
    "their final heights are generally above the original heights of slow loop shrinkages ( see ( b ) ) . in original aia images , the fast contracting features are usually bright , cusp - shaped loops ( see , bottom ) , but occasionally dark , tadpole - like voids @xcite . in running ratio space - time plots ( , top ) ,",
    "the former each produce a bright track followed by a recovering dark track , while the latter produce tracks of reversed order .",

    "this estimated reconnection site leaves the aia fov at about 06:40  ut .    during 04:1505:25",
    "ut , we identified 25 upward ejections ( red ) and 29 downward , early fast contractions ( green ) , at average occurrence rates of once every 2.4 and 2.2  minutes , respectively .",

    "this may indicate that those waves are triggered by the energy release episodes associated with these contractions . ]",
    "the persistence throughout the entire flare of such contractions also agrees with the statistical result from .",
    "the initial velocity of upward ejections , as shown in ( d ) , increases with time and seems to be correlated with the height of the overlying flux rope as it evolves into eruption .",
    "in particular , there is a rapid velocity increase at the onset of the impulsive phase , reaching @xmath1 .",
    "this aspect of this event is independently studied by r.  @xcite .",
    "to infer the overall properties of nonthermal particles and thermal plasma , we analyzed spatially integrated spectra of individual detectors following the procedures detailed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "shows example spectra in three phases of the flare .",
    "( 1 ) during the pre - impulsive phase ( 04:59:0005:01:32  ut ) , we fitted the spectrum with two isothermal functions combined : a warm component ( red dotted ) of temperature @xmath136 and emission measure @xmath137 plus a hot component ( green dotted ) of @xmath138 ( also called super - hot , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a 40 times smaller em . if we were to replace the hot component with a power - law @xmath139 , we would have a steep slope of @xmath140 .",
    "( 2 ) during the impulsive phase ( 05:2505:26  ut ) , we used an isothermal ( @xmath141 , @xmath142 ) plus power - law ( blue dotted , @xmath143 ) model .",
    "( 3 ) during the decay phase , the data can be fitted with one isothermal function of a slightly reduced temperature of @xmath144 but twice higher em of @xmath145 .",
    "note that at @xmath146@xmath1225  kev , the power law in the impulsive phase is more than an order of magnitude higher than the thermal component .",
    "this indicates that the 2550  kev masuda - type loop - top source shown in is primarily nonthermal and likely a particle acceleration region itself ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .",
    "we applied such spectral fits throughout the flare and the temporal variations of the fitting parameters are shown in ( d ) and ( e ) . in general , the warm thermal component is persistent in time , and both its @xmath147 and em ( orange plus signs ) increase through the hxr burst followed by a more gradual decrease .",
    "a similar trend is present for the hot thermal component ( red crosses ) during the pre - impulsive phase .",
    "a thermal fit to data gives a somewhat lower @xmath147 but higher em ( black dotted lines ) , because of its well - known preferential response to relatively cooler plasma .",
    "the power - law component ( blue ) displays a common hardening trend before the night data gap .      in",
    "we have examined the energy - dependent height distribution of the loop - top x - ray source ( lower coronal source ) . here",
    "we extend this analysis to the upper coronal source during the pre - impulsive phase and compare the two sources together .",
    "as shown in ( a ) and ( b ) , the higher - energy emission ( 1215  kev , blue contours ) of the lower source is located at higher altitudes than lower - energy emission ( 38  kev , green contours ) , while the upper source has an opposite trend .",
    "that is , the two sources are closer to each other at higher energies , as can be better seen in panel ( d ) from the linear fits to their centroid heights as a function of logarithmic energy .",
    "this implies higher temperatures of the thermal plasma and/or harder spectra of the nonthermal particles within the inner regions .",
    "similar observations have been reported @xcite and interpreted as evidence of magnetic reconnection and associated energy release being located between the double coronal sources .    at the highest energies ( @xmath3810  kev ) , this trend seems to be reversed , especially for the upper source . in previous observations ( e.g. , figure  4 in @xcite ) ,",
    "more obvious reversals occurred at slightly higher energies of 1520  kev and were interpreted as a transition from the low - energy thermal regime to the high - energy nonthermal regime , in which greater stopping distances of higher energy electrons can cause higher energy bremsstrahlung x - rays being located farther away .",
    "we further suggest that this reversal may be an indication of the two x - ray sources being _ spatially separated _ , instead of merging together at the highest energies ; so are the locations of primary heating and particle acceleration from magnetic reconnection .",
    "this is supported by the _ separate temperature peaks _ at the two sources as shown in ( a ) and ( h ) and discussed in .          to infer the spatial distributions of temperature @xmath147 and emission measure ( em ) , we employed a forward - fitting algorithm using aia filter ratios ( @xcite ; for a different approach , see @xcite ) .",
    "this algorithm assumes a gaussian differential emission measure that has a peak em at temperature @xmath147 .",
    "such a model provides the simplest description of the em weighted temperature distribution along the line of sight .",
    "( left ) shows examples of @xmath147 and em maps .",
    "early in the event at 04:49  ut , the highest temperature of @xmath148 or @xmath149 is located in the rising flux rope and the underlying flare cusp , but em is highly concentrated in the latter .",
    "the temperature then increases with time especially in the flare cusp , reaching @xmath150 or @xmath151 at 05:09  ut , close to the 35  mk of the hot component at this time ( see ( d ) , red crosses ) . in the decay phase ,",
    "the highest temperatures are located in the outer layer of the flare arcade and the lower portion of the contracting cusps ( ray - like features ) above it .",
    "the em in the latter is nearly four orders of magnitude lower than in the central arcade , similar to those of hot fans of rays observed by @xcite .",
    "the considerable increase of em and thus density in the flare loops from panel ( d ) to ( e ) , prior to the impulsive phase , suggests chromospheric evaporation driven by thermal conduction or by waves @xcite , rather than electron beam heating that may be important later in the presence of hxr footpoints .",
    "to better follow the history of @xmath147 and em , we obtained their space - time plots , as shown in ( g ) and ( k ) , from corresponding maps using cut  0 .",
    "we identified the maximum temperature and em at each time and show their projected heights as orange and black symbols in panel  ( p ) .",
    "in general , both peaks follow the same upward - downward - upward motions as the loop - top emission centroids .",
    "the temperature peaks are near the 1625  kev centroids ( blue ) , while the em peaks are close to or slightly lower than the aia 131   centroids ( purple ) at lower heights .",
    "the _ peak offset _ of the temperature and em can be better seen in their height distributions at selected times shown in ( h ) and ( l ) .",
    "it explains the observed energy dispersion of the x - ray loop - top centroids shown in ( e ) because of the exponential shape of thermal bremsstrahlung spectra ( equation  ( [ thbremeq ] ) ) . as shown by the green and red lines in the middle of , a higher temperature but lower em produces a harder ( shallower ) spectrum of lower normalization that dominates at high energies , while a lower temperature but higher em produces a softer ( steeper ) spectrum of higher normalization that dominates at low energies .",
    "the temperature peak being located above the em peak thus shifts the higher energy x - rays toward greater heights .",
    "otherwise , if the temperature and em peaks are cospatial , they would dominate x - rays at all energies and there would be no separation of centroids with energy .",
    "we note in ( h ) that the em decreases more gradually near the flux rope .",
    "this may lead to the less pronounced energy dispersion of the upper coronal source there than the lower ( loop - top ) source ( see ) .    as a proof of concept , we modeled the observed x - rays of energy @xmath146 with thermal bremsstrahlung radiation @xcite : i_sxr ( em ) ( -e / kt ) e g(e / kt ) , [ thbremeq]where @xmath152 is the emission measure and @xmath153 is the gaunt factor .",
    "the resulting x - ray profiles at two selected times are shown in ( i ) and ( m ) for the corresponding @xmath147 and em profiles .",
    "as expected , the higher energy 20  kev emission ( blue ) is dominated by the temperature peak at a higher altitude , while the 3  kev emission ( red ) is dominated by the em peak at a lower altitude .",
    "their emission peaks , marked by open circles , differ in height by @xmath154 and @xmath155 for the two times .",
    "their peak heights are repeated in panel  ( p ) and are close to those of observed loop - top centroids .    as shown in ( g ) and",
    "( p ) , the high temperature region and particularly the temperature peak are close to the x - ray loop - top centroids but always below the reconnection site ( green dashed line ) .",
    "this indicates that primary plasma heating takes place in reconnection outflows . to illustrate this",
    ", we can follow a contracting loop and the temperature variation it senses as it travels away from the reconnection site .",
    "a selected track from ( c ) is shown here as the blue dotted arrow . the temperature history on its path , as shown in ( h ) and ( j ) , indicates rapid heating at an average rate of @xmath156 from 3.5 to 28  mk over 8  minutes and @xmath157 .",
    "this example gives us a sense of the heating rate averaged along the line of sight , not necessarily of a specific loop .",
    "likewise , the track of a slow loop shrinkage at lower altitudes reveals cooling at an average rate of @xmath158 from 25 to 7.9  mk within 54  minutes .",
    "the rate is @xmath159 earlier during the impulsive phase in the 289  mk range and @xmath160 later during 07:0008:30  ut in the 147  mk range .",
    "these cooling rates are somewhat lower than previously found at even lower temperatures @xcite .",
    "we have presented detailed euv and x - ray observations of the 2012 july 19 m7.7 flare , focusing on the signatures of _ magnetic reconnection _ and associated energy release .",
    "we summarize our findings and discuss their implications as follows .    1 .",
    "the v - shaped euv emission on the trailing edge of the flux rope cme and the underlying , inverted v - shaped flare loops , both associated with distinct x - ray emission , suggest two oppositely oriented y - type null points with a vertical _ current sheet _ formed in between ( and [ maps_blob.eps ] ) .",
    "2 .   originating from the inferred magnetic reconnection site within the current sheet",
    "are _ bi - directional outflows _ in the forms of plasmoids and cusp - shaped loops .",
    "the upward ejections have a median initial velocity of @xmath161 and a maximum of @xmath1 , while the concurrent downward cusp contractions are @xmath6@xmath162 slower with a median of @xmath163 .",
    "even faster contractions up to @xmath164 occur after the flux rope eruption for another 10  h , and a sizable fraction of 21% of them have speeds @xmath165@xmath166 , twice faster than previously reported @xcite . such high velocities are comparable to expected coronal speeds of @xmath6@xmath7 and sound speeds of 520@xmath167 for a 1030  mk flaring plasma . at lower altitudes ,",
    "flare loops persistently shrink at typical initial velocity of @xmath49 and gradually decelerate to about @xmath51 within 0.52.5  h. they are all evidence of _ reconnection outflows _ during different stages ( and [ tslice_sad.eps ] ) .",
    "the _ double coronal x - ray sources _ are spatially separated and located in the regions of bi - directional plasma outflows .",
    "the highest temperature is found near the loop - top x - ray source well below the reconnection site .",
    "this suggests that primary plasma heating and particle acceleration take place in the _ reconnection outflow regions _",
    "@xcite , rather than at the reconnection site itself .",
    "models with this ingredient were proposed long ago ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but solid observational evidence as presented here has been lacking ( and [ tem_map.eps ] ) .",
    "an _ energy dispersion _ is present in the loop - top position with higher - energy x - ray and hotter euv emission located at greater heights over a large range of @xmath168 .",
    "the 2550  kev nonthermal emission lies @xmath169 ( twice that of the masuda flare ) above the 610  kev thermal emission .",
    "this agrees with the expected trend of softer electron spectra in the nonthermal regime and lower temperatures in the thermal regime being associated with earlier energized loops , which are located further below the primary locus of energy release .",
    "the upper coronal x - ray source has an opposite trend because it is located in the oppositely directed reconnection outflow ( , [ cent_time.eps ] , and [ cent_e.eps ] ) .",
    "prior to the recently recognized descent followed by a continuous ascent , the overall loop - top emission experiences an _ initial ascent _ for nearly an hour .",
    "this is the first time that such motions , including the descent , are observed simultaneously from euv to hxrs covering a wide range of temperatures of 130  mk .",
    "the transition from ascent to descent coincides with the rapid acceleration of the flux rope cme .",
    "the loop - top descends at @xmath6@xmath3 , about 50% slower in euv than in x - ray ( ) .",
    "the flare impulsive phase starts when a rapid velocity increases occur for the overall loop - top descent , the individual loop shrinkages , and the upward plasmoid ejections .",
    "this is delayed by 10 minutes from the initial loop - top descent , implying that the energy release rate is more intimately correlated with these velocities than the loop - top position ( ) .",
    "we propose the following physical picture to tie together the observations .",
    "the major points , including the location of particle acceleration and the three - stage ( up - down - up ) motion of the loop - top x - ray source , are sketched in .",
    "the earlier _ confined _ c4.5 flare leads to the formation of a flux rope and cusp - shaped loops underneath it .",
    "after six hours of slow evolution , the flux rope becomes unstable and rises @xcite . a vertical current sheet forms between two y - type null points at the lower tip of the flux rope and the upper tip of the underlying cusp .",
    "magnetic reconnection ensues within the current sheet , leading to the _ eruptive _ m7.7 flare .",
    "magnetic reconnection produces _ bi - directional outflows _ in forms of the observed plasmoids and contracting loops .",
    "plasmoids are flux tubes formed by the tearing mode @xcite with a guiding field along the current sheet .",
    "they are magnetic islands in two dimension or when the current sheet is seen edge - on .",
    "these outflows are driven by the magnetic tension force of the highly bent , newly reconnected field lines , as in those pointed cusps .",
    "the outflows generally decelerate , as observed here , when they run into the ambient corona and when the contracting loops relax to less bent shapes with reduced magnetic tension .",
    "this implies that the low - altitude slow shrinkages could be the late stages of decelerated high - altitude fast contractions .",
    "several mechanisms can operate in the reconnection outflows and contribute to particle acceleration and plasma heating .",
    "_ turbulence or plasma waves",
    "_ , for example , can be generated by the interaction of the high speed flows with the ambient corona . upon cascading to smaller scales ( comparable to the gyro - radii of background particles ) at some distance from the reconnection site , turbulence can accelerate the particles and heat the plasma .",
    "additional contribution to particle acceleration and/or heating can come from fast - mode _ shocks _ in the outflow regions , gas dynamic shocks within contracting flux tubes @xcite , and the _ first - order fermi _ and _ betatron _ mechanisms within the collapsing traps formed by contracting loops .",
    "as the flux rope evolves into its fast rise and eruption stage , the current sheet could become sufficiently long causing significant tearing instability , and/or become thinner than the ion skin depth leading to a transition from sweet - parker reconnection to collisionless hall reconnection @xcite .",
    "both can result in enhanced rates of reconnection and energy release .",
    "the outflow velocity will also increase , producing stronger heating and particle acceleration by one or a combination of the above three mechanisms ( turbulence , shock , and betatron ) whose efficiency is expected to be positively correlated with the outflow velocity . for example , faster outflows can generate stronger turbulence that can lead to stronger particle acceleration ( see * ? ? ? * for a comparison between acceleration by turbulence and shocks ) .",
    "this explains the observed temporal correlation of the increase in outflow velocity and the onset of the impulse phase and hxr burst .",
    "the loop - top source seen in x - ray and euv represents the collective emission of the ensemble of flare loops , each of which undergoes post - reconnection contraction or shrinkage .",
    "the loop - top emission centroid is the average position of this ensemble , which in the thermal regime is determined by the convolution of the spatial distributions of temperature and emission measure .",
    "such distributions are influenced by several competing processes , including energization of new loops produced by the _",
    "upward _ developing reconnection , and _ downward _ contractions and cooling of previously reconnected loops .",
    "we suggest that the interplay of these processes results in the up - down - up migration of the loop - top source . around the early impulsive phase ,",
    "the observed higher velocities of loop contractions tend to shift the overall loop - top source downward , as depicted in ( c ) and ( d ) . within the contracting loops , conductive cooling",
    "can be considerably reduced by stronger turbulence produced by faster reconnection outflows @xcite .",
    "slower cooling helps the x - ray / euv emission of these hot loops last longer during their contractions and further contribute to the loop - top descent . before and after the early impulsive phase , the situation could be different .",
    "loop contractions are slower and associated faster cooling can make these loops cool below the instrumental temperature passband more rapidly .",
    "the upward development of reconnection could thus dominate , leading to the upward loop - top migration .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the observed temporal coincidence of the highest velocities of individual loop shrinkages and of the loop - top descent at the impulsive phase onset . like cooling , _ chromospheric evaporation _",
    "can also play a role .",
    "after the initial chromospheric evaporation associated with energization of newly reconnected loops , if it continues operating during the subsequent loop contractions , the densities and thus emission measures of these loops would keep rising and contribute to the downward loop - top drift . otherwise ,",
    "if it rapidly subsides , it would assist the upward loop - top drift .",
    "investigating such a complex interplay would require detailed numerical modeling , which is beyond our scope here .",
    "the fast downward contractions of euv loops are best seen during the decay phase , likely because of their greater distances traveled making them easier to be detected .",
    "likewise , different environments may explain the factor of two difference in the median deceleration between the early and later fast contractions ( ( f ) and ( g ) ) .",
    "the earlier , compact flare loops of stronger magnetic field can produce stronger resistance to quickly brake the contracting loops impinging on them from above , while the later , large flare arcade of weaker field at greater heights and greater travel distances may allow more gradual deceleration .",
    "the x - ray spectra are essentially thermal during the decay phase .",
    "this suggests that the late phase contractions are associated with plasma heating rather than particle acceleration .",
    "this is expected because the magnetic field strength decreases with height , and so does the available magnetic energy to be released by reconnection .",
    "such prolonged heating may contribute to the well - known slower than expected cooling of flare plasma ( see ( d ) ; @xcite ) .",
    "the fast high - altitude contractions and slow low - altitude shrinkages appear as two statistically distinct populations . the median _ final _ velocity of the former is more than four times the median _ initial _ velocity of the latter ( @xmath170 vs.  @xmath49 ; and [ tslice_sad.eps ] ) .",
    "we have interpreted the latter as the late stages of the former that have decelerated , but we rarely see a continuous track decelerating from @xmath12@xmath166 to a few @xmath4 . alternatively , this distinction may be due to inhomogeneity of reconnection ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in the current sheet above the flare arcade that is primarily oriented along the line of sight .",
    "the _ persistent _ slow shrinkages could result from reconnection at a moderate rate throughout the current sheet , which produces flare loops forming the arcade and double ribbons at their footpoints . the _ episodic _ fast contractions could be signatures of plasmoids within the current sheet , associated with enhanced reconnection and energy release rates .",
    "these fast contracting loops are dispersed along the line of sight amidst slowly shrinking loops , producing the observed effects ( e.g. , ( b ) ) .",
    "there are other physically different ( though not necessarily unrelated ) phenomena that share similar observational signatures and should not be confused with the contractions of _ newly reconnected _",
    "loops studied here . for example , _ pre - existing _ coronal loops can contract at typical speeds @xmath171@xmath39 during eruptions @xcite , interpreted as implosion due to the rapid release of magnetic energy and thus reduction of magnetic pressure within the eruption volume . when a cme eruption initiates at an elevated height , it can produces a downward push to displace ambient coronal loops ( e.g. , * ?",
    "* see their figure 12(h ) , at @xmath172 ) .",
    "even slower shrinkage at @xmath173 can occur in active region loops due to gradual cooling @xcite .",
    "sometimes , conjugate x - ray footpoints approach each other while the loop - top source descends , likely because of reconnection progressing toward less sheared loops at lower altitudes .",
    "we have not found these signatures in the flare under study here , except for a few overlying existing loops that contract at about @xmath123 during 05:4005:50  ut near the end of the impulsive phase .",
    "in addition , some high - lying loops continue to expand and erupt at @xmath6@xmath39 up to 08:00  ut , three hours after the original flux rope eruption .",
    "examination of such features and quantitative comparison of these observations with particle acceleration models will be subjects of future investigations .",
    "in the main text , we focused on the 131    channel . for a complete temperature coverage ,",
    "we examine all aia channels here . as shown in ( top ) , each channel has a generally broad response with one to a few peaks . in the order of approximately decreasing temperature response are 193 , 131 , 94 , 304 , 335 , 211 , and 171    channels",
    ".    shows space - time plots of all euv channels . on the left",
    "are base ratio from every other frame of short exposure so that bright flare loops are not over - exposed , while on the right are running ratio from frames of regular exposure that is needed for detecting faint emission , including fast loop contractions , above the flare arcade . on the left , the 131 and 94    channels capture the hot , diffuse loop - top emission , while the flare arcade underneath it is best seen in cooler channels .",
    "both regions appear in the 193    channel because of its dual response to hot emission peaking at @xmath144 and cool emission at @xmath174 . on the right - hand side , downward fast contractions and slow shrinkages can be identified in the three hottest channels . in cooler channels , cooling condensations rain down the arcade loops since 06:00  ut at up to @xmath6@xmath175 or 90% of the free fall speed , faster than typical coronal rain @xcite . in ( left ) , the erupting flux rope is best seen in the hot 131 and 94    channels as a bright , accelerating track , indicating its high temperature , as also shown in .",
    "its evolution from gradual rise to impulsive eruption is accompanied by the rapid increase in x - ray flux and the loop - top s ascent - to - descent transition .",
    "this is in line with observed synchronous eruption accelerations and flare onsets @xcite .",
    "\\(b ) and [ cent_time.eps](a ) show temporal emission profiles taken from the base - ratio space - time plots at @xmath176 marked by a cross . since 04:17  ut , the 131 and 94    emission increases considerably , while other emission remains essentially flat .",
    "this indicates gentle heating early in the flare , as seen in the temperature history at this position shown in ( j ) .",
    "the dip in all channels at the onset of the impulsive phase ( vertical dashed line ) is due to the descent of the loop - top source .",
    "the large hump afterwards results from the growth of the flare arcade toward greater heights .",
    "this hump generally progresses toward cooler channels , indicating a cooling sequence , similar to those recently observed in flares , ar loops , and prominence condensations @xcite .",
    "the double humps at 193    are again due to its dual temperature response .    like 193  ",
    ", the 304    channel responds to both hot emission at @xmath177 and cool emission at @xmath178 .",
    "the dual response of these two channels leads to their unusually large descent of about 40% of the loop - top centroids ( see ) .",
    "this is because their maximum loop - top heights are dominated by hot emission , while the minimum heights are dominated by cool emission at even lower heights ( ) .",
    "the limb view of /aia leaves an alternative possibility of the loop - top descent as the progression of energization from high- to low - lying loops along the arcade in the east - west direction . this possibility is not supported by -a ( sta ) that was @xmath179 ahead of the earth and observed the flare on the disk .",
    "when the x - ray loop - top descent occurs , the sta 195    image ( ( d ) ) shows a compact cusp - shaped loop , while the arcade system develops later ( panels  ( e ) and ( f ) ) .",
    "one could further argue that a temperature effect , i.e. , cooling or heating , can make a progression appear as a compact source rather than an arcade .",
    "if so , the loops being cooled or heated would have appeared at the same location and been captured by aia in cooler or hotter euv channels or by in x - rays . instead , all available euv and x - ray data covering a wide temperature range of @xmath180@xmath181 show a consistent loop - top descent , which must be a real mass motion ."
