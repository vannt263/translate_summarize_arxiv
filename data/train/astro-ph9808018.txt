    "galaxy clusters are often elongated . binggeli s ( 1982 ) study of abell cluster data gave the first indication that they have a strong tendency towards alignment with ( i.e. , their semi - major axes point toward ) other clusters at distances of less than around 30 h@xmath1mpc .",
    "west s ( 1989 ) study of 48 superclusters also gave clear evidence for alignment of clusters within superclusters on similar scales .",
    "simulations also indicate that cluster axes are aligned with neighbouring clusters ( splinter et al .",
    "1997 and references therein ) .",
    "it has become recognized within the context of structure formation in hierarchical clustering ( `` bottom - up '' ) due to gravitational instability that the large - scale weakly non - linear structure closely follows that produced in what used to be called the `` top - down '' or `` pancake '' theory ( melott et al .",
    "1983 ; pauls & melott 1995 and references therein ; bond , kofman , & pogosyan 1996 ) . in this picture ,",
    "most galaxy clusters are formed by the flow of matter along the sheets and filaments that connect neighbouring clusters ( shandarin & klypin 1984 , colberg et al .",
    "1998 ) .",
    "for this reason , merging events are often aligned with these structures .",
    "mergers inject a velocity anisotropy into the cluster that should persist for several crossing times . it may be a cause for the tendency of clusters to point to their neighbours as described above .",
    "the anisotropy is a fossil relic of recent merging events , which can be seen most clearly in the simulation video ( particularly the second sequence ) accompanying kauffmann & melott ( 1992 )",
    ".    burns ( 1998 ) has reviewed the evidence for persistent winds in the intra - cluster medium that may exist as a result of these recent mergers ( see also gomez et al .",
    "1997a , roettinger , burns , & loken 1996 ) .",
    "gomez et al . ( 1997b ) showed that there was a highly significant correlation between the orientation of the semi - major axis of the cluster and the direction of these winds , as indicated by the bending of jets from wide - angled tailed ( wat ) radio sources in the clusters . on the other hand , ulmer , mcmillan , &",
    "kowalski ( 1989 ) found no orientation of xray images toward nearest neighbour clusters .",
    "although there is evidence of alignment between cluster ellipticity and neighbour clusters and of alignment of cluster ellipticity with the winds blowing wat jets , there has been no study of the alignment of wat jets with neighbour clusters .",
    "it is possible that the `` prevailing wind '' seen in abell clusters with wats may be a remnant of drainage along large - scale structure .",
    "if this wind is a fossil of such drainage , one might expect that it would point either to neighbour clusters or along supercluster axes .",
    "images from gomez et al . ( 1997b ) , pinkney et al .",
    "( 1993 ) , zhao et al .",
    "( 1989 ) , odonoqhue , owen & eilek ( 1990 ) , and odea and owen ( 1985 ) are used in the determination of the orientation of wide - angle tailed radio source jets .",
    "these images are overlays of 6-cm or 20-cm vla data on x - ray emission contours in the energy band 0.52.0 kev from rosat pspc data .",
    "another image used was of data from the westbrook radio telescope at 6-cm .",
    "( vallee , wilson , & vanderlaan ( 1979 ) . to estimate the direction of the `` wind '' within a cluster",
    ", lines are drawn manually upon the wat jets , and a bisector drawn for the angle created by these lines . since the clusters are all at a large distance from earth , a small angle approximation is used .",
    "the orientation of each bisector in table 1 is reported with respect to the horizontal .",
    "an orientation of 0@xmath2 or 360@xmath2 corresponds to a cluster whose wat `` points '' to the east on a flattened section of celestial sphere . to reduce the effect of subjectivity upon the estimated orientation of the wats ,",
    "lines are constructed independently by five different individuals with no knowledge of the cluster s environment . as can be seen in table 1 , the random uncertainties in the wat angle estimation are relatively small and will have little effect on questions of alignment",
    ".    we do not consider sources for which orientations were difficult to ascertain for any reason ( e.g. extreme ambiguity of orientation ; difficulty in determining location of one of the wat jets ; poor spatial radio spatial resolution of the more distant wats ; no apparent wind as evidenced by an opening angle near 180@xmath2 ) .",
    "we also exclude wats which live in clusters for which no neighbours exist in our redshift catalog within 30 mpc @xmath0 , where @xmath3 = @xmath4 @xmath5 @xmath6 .",
    "( this is sometimes due to lack of redshift information . )",
    "this leaves us with twelve of the seventeen different wats that were present in our source studies .    due to the redshift survey incompleteness ,",
    "it is not possible to define a complete sample of clusters for the wats in this analysis .",
    "however , given these constraints , we believe that the remaining sample of wat clusters and their neighbours is not systematically biased and should be representative of such clusters and their environs .    .estimated orientation angles for winds in the wat clusters studied .",
    "note that all angles are taken with respect to the horizontal and are in degrees .",
    "uncertainties represent one standard deviation from estimates by five individuals . [ cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]",
    "we perform two kolmogorov - smirnov ( k - s ) tests . the first is done on our distribution of angles between the wat angle bisector and the line connecting the wat cluster to its nearest neighbour .",
    "this test indicates only a 1.6% confidence level that we may reject the hypothesis of uniform angle distribution .",
    "one may ask if cluster wind directions and nearest neighbour directions are correlated with cluster axes , why they are not correlated with one another . it is not required , but we would like a physical explanation . we speculate that cluster axes are affected by both tidal forces and by merger events . one would expect the nearest cluster to dominate the tidal field , but merger events should be correlated with the supercluster axis . further study is needed to understand this null result .",
    "= 3.3 in    the second test is on the distribution of angles between the wind ( wat angle bisector ) and the supercluster line as defined previously .",
    "the angle and therefore the significance of its distribution are obviously functions of @xmath7 . in figure 2 ,",
    "the heavy solid line shows the confidence level ( for rejection of the null hypothesis that the angles may be distributed uniformly ) as a function of @xmath7 .",
    "this confidence reaches a maximum of 97.0% for @xmath8 @xmath0 .",
    "the lighter solid lines are a measure of the uncertainty in this confidence , generated by choosing eleven best or eleven worst aligned out of the twelve regions .",
    "there is clearly a preferred scale , about 25 @xmath9 @xmath0 .",
    "the heavy dashed line is @xmath10 , which reaches a value of about 29.3@xmath2 , when the k - s test reaches maximum confidence .",
    "( this is not quite the minimum , which is 28.8@xmath2 . )",
    "the mean never exceeds 45@xmath2 , although the confidence is poor for small and large @xmath7 .",
    "discontinuities in the slope of the confidence curve occur when the slowly rotating supercluster orientations cross 0@xmath2or 90@xmath2 .    for small @xmath7",
    ", the supercluster orientation is poorly determined due to the small number of objects included .",
    "as @xmath7 approaches zero , this becomes the nearest neighbour test . for large @xmath7 , we exceed the scale of typical segments of the network .",
    "it is interesting that the region of best @xmath7 coincides with the wavelength of perturbations going non - linear today as estimated elsewhere ( melott and shandarin 1993 ) .",
    "it is also close to the neighbour linkage radius found necessary for percolation in one supercluster study ( batuski et al .",
    "we see here support for the idea that the structures found by percolation have a dynamical origin , and are not merely accidental artifacts .",
    "= 3.3 in    the first k - s test result is consistent with the wat orientations being completely uncorrelated with nearest neighbours .",
    "however , the second k - s test result indicates a strong correlation between wat wind orientation and the supercluster orientation .",
    "it should be noted that a sample size of twelve wat clusters is very small .",
    "west ( 1989 ) , for example , studied 48 clusters .",
    "we recommend investigation of a larger data sample .",
    "this will be a lengthy process , dealing with a large number of unclassified sources in the literature .    however , we believe our conclusions on the supercluster - wat alignment are robust , and offer several reasons for this . first , the k - s test is useful under certain conditions for small sample sizes .",
    "it is statistically robust at the sample size and confidence level of our result ( lehmann and dabrera 1975 ) .",
    "another approach is to use a completely different statistic .",
    "if we put the angles into four bins of 22.5@xmath2 , each of which would be equiprobable under a uniform population , we can use the binomial theorem to evaluate the probability that seven or more out of twelve will lie in the first bin .",
    "the result is 98.9% confidence that the distribution is not uniform . using three bins of 30@xmath2 produces a similar result ( 98.5% ) .",
    "apparently the effect we have found is so strong it is significant even for a small sample size .",
    "our results show a correlation between objects two orders of magnitude apart in size . they are also dynamical evidence in favor of quasi - linear hierarchical clustering following `` pancake '' dynamics ( melott and shandarin 1993 ) .",
    "this has had great success in reproducing large structure in n - body simulations .",
    "it predicted the supercluster - void picture of large - scale structure accepted today ( zeldovich , einasto , & shandarin 1982 , melott et al . 1983 ) .",
    "however , this general agreement between theory and observation has been based on statistical measures of the galaxy distribution , not on observed dynamics .",
    "analysis of cosmic flows has not yet progressed to showing features unique to the quasi - linear regime .",
    "the flows indicated here are not a part of linear theory , and thus lend empirical support to the quasi - linear analysis of gravitational instability .",
