    "kinetically constrained spin models ( kcsm ) are interacting particle systems which have been introduced and very much studied in the physics literature to model liquid / glass transition and more generally glassy dynamics ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "a configuration is given by assigning to each vertex @xmath2 of a ( finite or infinite ) connected graph @xmath3 its occupation variable @xmath4 which corresponds to an empty or filled site , respectively .",
    "the evolution is given by markovian stochastic dynamics of glauber type .",
    "each site with rate one refreshes its occupation variable to a filled or to an empty state with probability @xmath5 or @xmath6 respectively provided that the current configuration satisfies an a priori specified local constraint .",
    "here we focus on two of the most studied kcsm , the east @xcite and fa-1f models @xcite on hypercubic lattices ( @xmath7 ) : the constraint at @xmath2 requires for east model its right nearest neighbour to be empty , for fa-1f model at least one of its nearest neighbours to be empty .",
    "note that in both cases ( and this is a general feature of kcsm ) the constraint which should be satisfied to allow creation / annihilation of a particle at @xmath2 does not involve @xmath8 , thus detailed balance w.r.t .",
    "the bernoulli product measure at density @xmath5 is an invariant reversible measure for the process .",
    "both models are ergodic on @xmath9 for any @xmath10 with a positive spectral gap which shrinks to zero as @xmath11 corresponding to the occurrence of diverging mixing times @xcite .",
    "several numerical works and approximated analytical treatments have shown that relaxation for both models occurs in a more and more spatially heterogenous way as density is increased ( see section 1.5 of @xcite and references therein ) . for example when measuring the persistence field @xmath12 which equals to one if site @xmath2 has never changed its state up to time @xmath13 and zero otherwise a clear spatial segregation is observed among sites with 0/1 values of @xmath14 at time scales corresponding to the typical relaxation time of the persistence function which corresponds to the spatial average of the persistence field .",
    "more quantitatively , if one measures the spatial correlation function of this persistence field , a dynamical correlation length corresponding to the extent of these heterogeneities can be extracted .",
    "this length increases as the density is increased .",
    "the occurrence of these dynamical heterogeneites has lead to the idea that the dynamics of kcm takes place on a first - order coexistence line between active and inactive dynamical phases @xcite . in order to exploit this idea in @xcite the fluctuation of the dynamical activity @xmath0 defined as the number of microscopic configuration changes on a volume of linear size @xmath15 in the time interval",
    "@xmath1 $ ] has been investigated .",
    "the mean activity scales as @xmath16 where @xmath17 depends on the density and on the choice of the constraints , as we will detail in section [ models ] .",
    "thus one could expect that the probability of observing a deviation from the mean value scales as @xmath18 with @xmath19 for @xmath20 as it occurs for the models without constraints .",
    "however , as it has been observed in @xcite , due to the presence of the constraint it is possible to realize at a low cost a trajectory with zero activity by starting from a completely filled configuration and imposing that a single site does not change its state ( see section [ heuristics ] for a detailed explanation of the mechanism behind this phenomenon ) .",
    "analogously one can obtain a smaller activity than the mean one by blocking for a fraction of time a single site . as a consequence of this sub - extensive cost for lowering the activity @xmath21 for @xmath22 .",
    "for the same reason , the moment generating function @xmath23 is non analytic at @xmath24 with a discontinuous first order derivative @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we investigate the finite size scaling of the first order transition .",
    "our main results are estimates of the cost of phase coexistence between the active and inactive dynamical phases . from these estimates , the relevant scaling asymptotic in can be determined . for east and fa1f in one dimension ,",
    "we prove ( theorem [ teo : phasetrans ] ) that @xmath25 satisfies @xmath26 if @xmath27 and @xmath28 if @xmath29 .",
    "this shows that a transition in occurs for a value @xmath30 with @xmath31 . as a consequence ,",
    "the scaling of the large deviations differs for increasing or decreasing the activity ( see theorem [ fluctu1 ] ) .",
    "we also analyze the measure on the space - time configurations @xmath32 which corresponds to the conditional measure with a fixed activity @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the parameter conjugated to @xmath35 in legendre transform and prove ( theorem [ teo : condmes ] ) that depending on the value of @xmath36 this measure has very different typical configurations which can be interpreted as active and inactive dynamical phases : for @xmath27 , @xmath37 concentrates on trajectories with the mean activity and for @xmath29 , it concentrates on trajectories with zero activity .",
    "finally , we investigate the higher dimensional cases and show that the finite size scaling depends not only on the dimension but also on the boundary conditions ( theorem [ linearityd>1 ] ) .",
    "this leads to a variety of scalings for the large deviations when the activity is reduced ( theorem [ fluctu2 ] ) .",
    "the east and fa-1f models in one dimension are glauber type markov processes on the configuration space @xmath39 where @xmath40 .",
    "both models depend on a parameter @xmath5 , with @xmath10 , which we will call the _",
    "density_. here we will consider the models in finite volumes @xmath41 $ ] and we will be interested in the thermodynamic limit @xmath42 .",
    "we call @xmath43 the configuration space correspondent to @xmath44 and denote by greek letters @xmath45 the elements of @xmath46 .",
    "then for any site @xmath47 we let @xmath48 be the value of configuration @xmath49 at site @xmath50 and we say that @xmath50 is _ empty _",
    "( _ filled _ ) if @xmath51 ( @xmath52 , respectively ) .",
    "the markov process corresponding to both models can be informally described as follows .",
    "each site @xmath47 waits an independent mean one exponential time and then , provided the current configuration satisfies a proper local constraint , we refresh the value of the configuration at @xmath50 by setting it to @xmath53 with probability @xmath5 and to zero with probability @xmath6 . instead if the constraint is not satisfied nothing occurs",
    ". then the procedure starts again .",
    "the specific choice of the constraint identifies the model : for east one requires that the right nearest neighbour of @xmath50 is empty ; for fa-1f model one requires that at least one among the right and left nearest neighbours of @xmath50 is empty . in formulas",
    "the constraint at @xmath50 is satisfied for east and fa-1f in the configuration @xmath49 iff @xmath54 and @xmath55 , respectively .",
    "note that in both models the constraint is local ( it depends on the configuration on a finite neighborhood of the to - be - updated site ) and does not depend on the value of the configuration on the to - be - updated site .",
    "both models belongs to the larger class of kinetically constrained models ( kcm in short ) , which have been introduced and widely studied in physics literature ( see for reviews @xcite ) .    in order for the above description to be complete ,",
    "we need to specify what happens at sites near the boundary .",
    "a standard choice in statistical mechanics is to defined the dynamics in finite volume by imposing a fixed boundary condition . here",
    "the choice of this boundary condition is very delicate , indeed due to the presence of the constraints both models are very sensitive to the specific choice of these conditions even on large volumes .",
    "for example for the east model it is easy to verify that if we fix a boundary condition equal to one at @xmath56 , we start the evolution from @xmath57 and we let @xmath2 be the position of the rightmost zero of @xmath49 , then at any subsequent time site @xmath2 stays empty and sites @xmath58 $ ] stay filled . in this case we say that the configuration is _ frozen _ on @xmath59 $ ] meaning that under the evolution , the configuration on these sites remains unchanged . on the other hand , for a boundary condition equal to zero at @xmath56",
    ", it can be easily verified that there is no site on which the configuration is frozen no matter which is the choice of the initial configuration . from the above observation it follows that in the case of filled boundary condition the configuration space ( even on finite volume ) is not irreducible .",
    "indeed there exists configurations @xmath60 such that it is not possible to devise a path of elementary moves with strictly positive rates which connects @xmath61 to @xmath49 .",
    "instead if we take an empty boundary condition the configuration space is irreducible .",
    "this can be easily verified by constructing a path which completely empties any configuration starting from the right boundary .",
    "analogously for fa-1f model if one imposes filled boundary conditions both at @xmath62 and @xmath56 the configuration space is reducible . on the other hand",
    "any of the choices which has at least one empty site in the couple @xmath63 is sufficient to guarantee irreducibility . here for both models we will only be interested on choices of the boundary conditions which guarantee irreducibility ( and therefore ergodicity as we consider finite systems )",
    ".    note also that for both models , no matter which choice we perform for the boundary condition , the dynamics satisfy detailed balance with respect to bernoulli product measure @xmath64 at density @xmath5 , namely @xmath65 with @xmath66 ( this is a direct consequence of the above observed fact that the constraint at @xmath50 does not depend on the value of @xmath67 ) .",
    "therefore @xmath64 is an invariant measure for the process and in the irreducible case this is the unique invariant measure .",
    "let us now give a formal definition of these processes via the action of their generator @xmath68 on local functions @xmath69 .",
    "we introduce @xmath70 where @xmath71 stands for the configuration @xmath49 changed at @xmath50 , namely @xmath72 and we let @xmath73\\ ] ] with @xmath74 the function that encodes the constraint at site @xmath50 , namely @xmath75 ( @xmath76 iff the constraint at @xmath50 is ( is not ) satisfied . thus @xmath74 is model dependent and for the east model with frozen empty boundary condition at the right boundary we set @xmath77;\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,r_n=1\\ ] ] for fa-1f with empty boundary condition at the right and left boundary we set @xmath78;\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,r_1=1,\\,\\,\\,r_n=1\\ ] ] for fa-1f with empty boundary condition at the right boundary and occupied boundary condition at the left boundary we set @xmath79;\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,r_1=(1-\\eta_2),\\,\\,\\,r_n=1\\ ] ] and finally for fa-1f with empty boundary condition at the left boundary and occupied boundary condition at the right boundary we set @xmath80;\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,\\,r_1=1,\\,\\,\\,r_n=(1-\\eta_{n-1 } ) .",

    "therefore we never consider the case ) . also , when we state results referred to fa-1f model without further specifying the boundary conditions it means that these results hold for both the choices and .",
