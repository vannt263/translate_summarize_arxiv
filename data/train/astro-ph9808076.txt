    "the tight correlation between the total luminosity of disk galaxies and the rotation speed of their gas and stars ( tully & fisher 1977 ) has been a cornerstone of studies that attempt to measure galaxy distances and to map the dynamics of the local universe ( see , e.g. , strauss & willick 1995 for a review ) . the substantial observational effort devoted to the subject over the past two decades has provided a good understanding of the properties of this relation in the local universe .",
    "the tully - fisher ( tf ) relation steepens systematically from the blue to the red passbands and is surprisingly tight , especially at longer wavelengths ( the rms scatter is only @xmath6 mag in the i - band , see willick et al .",
    "the situation is less clear at higher redshift where , depending on sample selection and the details of the observational technique used to estimate rotation speeds , conflicting claims that the tf relation either brightens or dims at modest redshifts ( @xmath7 ) can be found in the literature ( rix et al .",
    "1997 , simard & pritchet 1996 , hudson et al .",
    "1998 , vogt et al .  1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "from a theoretical point of view , ideas regarding the origin of the tf relation can be divided into two broad camps : one that sees the tf relation as a result of self - regulated star formation in disks of different mass ( see , e.g. , silk 1997 ) ; and another where the tf relation is a direct consequence of the cosmological equivalence between mass and circular velocity ( see , e.g. , mo , mao & white 1998 ) .",
    "this equivalence is a consequence of the finite age of the universe , which imposes a maximum radius from where matter can accrete to form a galaxy .",
    "this radius ( sometimes called the `` virial '' radius ) corresponds roughly to that of a sphere with mean density about @xmath8 times the critical density for closure ( white & frenk 1991 , white et al .",
    "the circular velocity at the virial radius ( @xmath9 ) and its enclosed mass ( @xmath10 ) then are equivalent measures of the system mass related by @xmath11 @xmath12 is the value of hubble s constant at redshift @xmath13 , and @xmath14 km s@xmath15 mpc@xmath15 is its value at the present time . given this scaling , if disk rotation speeds ( @xmath16 ) are proportional to the circular velocity of the halo ( @xmath9 ) and stellar masses are proportional to @xmath10 , then luminosities should scale approximately like @xmath17 , a velocity dependence similar to that of the observed tf relation .",
    "both of these assumptions may fail in practice .",
    "disk rotation speeds depend in a non - trivial fashion on the stellar and gaseous mass of the galaxy , on the contribution of the dark halo within the optical radius of the galaxy , and on the radius where rotation speeds are measured .",
    "all these parameters may vary significantly from galaxy to galaxy ( see , e.g. , navarro 1998 and references therein ) .",
    "furthermore , luminosities , especially in the blue passbands , are not simply proportional to the stellar mass , but rather reflect a subtle interplay between the integrated and instantaneous star formation history of each galaxy .",
    "theoretical progress in this area then requires a careful evaluation of these effects .",
    "we present in this _ letter _ a first attempt at addressing these issues through direct numerical simulations of the formation of galaxies within their full cosmological context .",
    "our numerical experiments treat self - consistently many of the relevant physical processes of the problem : gravity , gas dynamics , and ( in a simplified manner ) the formation of stars and their energetic feedback .",
    "the star formation history of each galaxy is used as input to the latest spectrophotometric codes to compute broad - band luminosities that can be readily compared with observations .",
    "our simulations represent a significant improvement over prior numerical work on the subject , which either neglected star formation and feedback and focussed on the ability of gas the cool and collapse within dark halos , or lacked the proper numerical resolution to analyze the tf relation over a large range of mass and redshift ( see , e.g. , evrard , summers & davis 1994 , navarro & white 1994 , tissera , lambas & abadi 1997 ) .",
    "the simulations were performed using grapesph , a code that combines the smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) approach to numerical hydrodynamics with a direct summation n - body integrator optimized for the special - purpose hardware grape ( steinmetz 1996 ) .",
    "grapesph is fully lagrangian and highly adaptive in space and time due to the use of individual particle smoothing lengths and timesteps .",
    "it is thus optimally suited to study the formation of highly non - linear systems such as individual galaxy systems in a cosmological context .",
    "the code used for the simulations described in this paper include the self - gravity of gas , stars , and dark matter , a full @xmath18 hydrodynamical treatment of the gas , radiative and compton cooling , and a simple recipe for transforming gas into stars .",
    "the star formation algorithm we adopt is similar to that described in steinmetz & mller ( 1994 , 1995 , see also katz 1992 and navarro & white 1993 ) .",
    "star formation is modeled by creating new collisionless `` star '' particles in collapsing regions that are locally jeans - unstable at a rate given by @xmath19 . here",
    "@xmath20 is the gas density and @xmath21 and @xmath22 are the local cooling and dynamical timescales , respectively .",
    "the proportionality parameter , @xmath23 , is chosen so that most eligible gas is transformed into stars in about @xmath24 in dense regions , where @xmath25 .",
    "our results at @xmath0 are weakly dependent on our choice of @xmath26 since dynamical and cooling timescales in regions that actively form stars are much shorter than the age of the universe .",
    "after formation , `` star '' particles are only affected by gravitational forces , but they devolve energy to their surroundings in a crude attempt to mimic the energetic feedback from evolving stars and supernovae .",
    "star particles inject @xmath27 ergs per solar mass of stars formed into their surrounding gas @xmath28 yrs after their formation .",
    "this energy is invested into raising the internal energy ( temperature ) of the gas . however , because stars form in high - density regions , where cooling timescales are short , the feedback energy is almost immediately radiated away , and as a result the star formation history traces the rate at which gas cools and collapses to the center of dark matter halos .",
    "our implementation may thus be thought of as a `` minimal feedback '' model .",
    "we caution that other possible implementations , in particular those that include modifications to the kinetic energy of the gas surrounding star forming regions , may lead to quite different star formation histories than the ones we report here ( navarro & white 1993 ) .    the cosmological model we investigate is the standard cold dark matter ( cdm ) scenario , the paradigm of hierarchical clustering models of structure formation , with the following choice for the cosmological parameters : @xmath29 , @xmath30 , @xmath31 , and @xmath32 .",
    "the power spectrum is normalized so that at @xmath0 the rms amplitude of mass fluctuations in @xmath33mpc spheres is @xmath34 .",
    "although long discredited as a viable model for structure formation in the universe , the standard cold dark matter scenario is the best studied hierarchical clustering model and therefore it serves as a useful cosmological testbed of different galaxy formation models .",
    "we simulate spherical regions that evolve to form halos with circular velocities in the range ( 80 , 350 ) km s@xmath15 .",
    "these regions are identified in cosmological simulations of large periodic boxes and resimulated individually at higher resolution , including the tidal field of the original simulation .",
    "each region is filled initially with @xmath35 gas particles and the same number of dark matter particles .",
    "the size of the sphere is scaled in each case so that halos have about the same number of particles at @xmath0 .",
    "this ensures comparable numerical resolution in systems of very different mass .",
    "details of the procedure can be found in navarro & white ( 1994 ) .",
    "the gas particle mass varies between @xmath36 and @xmath37 , depending on the mass of the system under consideration .",
    "dark matter particle masses scale in the same way and vary from @xmath38 to @xmath39 .",
    "these particle masses are small enough to exclude artificial heating effects due to collisions between gas and dark matter particles ( steinmetz & white 1997 ) .",
    "all simulations start at @xmath40 and use gravitational softenings between @xmath41 and @xmath42 kpc .",
    "stars form preferentially in collapsed , dense clumps of gas , and therefore model `` galaxies '' are easily identified in these simulations as dense collections of star particles . in the interest of simplicity ,",
    "we retain for analysis only the most massive galaxy inhabiting each individual halo .",
    "most stars in a galaxy are contained within a radius @xmath43 km s@xmath44 kpc , which we use as a fiducial radius to compute all properties of the luminous component of model galaxies .",
    "we also cull from the sample all ongoing major mergers , defined as galaxies where the rms velocity of the stars differs from the circular velocity at @xmath45 by more than @xmath46 . in practice",
    "less than @xmath47 of the systems are eliminated this way from the analysis .",
    "the final sample consists of @xmath48 galaxies at @xmath0 and of @xmath49 galaxies at @xmath4 , most of which contain more than @xmath50 star particles .",
    "galaxy luminosities are computed by simply adding up the luminosities of each star particle , taking into account the time of creation of each particle ( its `` age '' ) and its metallicity , as described in detail by contardo , steinmetz & fritze - von alvensleben ( 1998 ) . the latest version of the spectrophotometric models of bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) is also used for comparison .",
    "figure 1 shows the simulated tully - fisher relation at @xmath0 in the i - band , compared with the data of giovanelli et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , mathewson , ford & buchhorn ( 1992 ) and han & mould ( 1992 ) .",
    "the lower panel shows i - band magnitudes versus @xmath9 , the circular velocity at the virial radius ; the upper panel uses instead @xmath16 , the circular velocity measured at the fiducial radius @xmath45 .",
    "the slope and scatter of the simulated tf relation are in fairly good agreement with the observational data , regardless of which velocity estimator is used .",
    "this result also holds in other bandpasses : the model tf relation becomes shallower ( and the scatter increases ) towards the blue , just as in observational samples ( see table 1 ) .",
    "the zero - point is also in good agreement with the data , provided that @xmath9 is used to estimate rotation speeds .",
    "circular velocities at @xmath45 ( the edge of the luminous galaxies ) are about @xmath51-@xmath52 higher , so that adopting @xmath16 as a velocity estimator results in a tf relation almost two magnitudes too faint at given rotation speed .",
    "the large difference between @xmath16 and @xmath9 is caused by the large fraction of baryons that assemble into the central galaxy and the dark mass they draw in as they settle at the center of the halo . on average ,",
    "about @xmath53-@xmath54 of all baryons within the virial radius are confined within @xmath45 at @xmath0 .",
    "[ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     * table 1 : * parameters of fits of the form @xmath55 to the tf relation in different bands",
    ". errors in @xmath56 and @xmath57 are @xmath58 percentile bootstrap deviations from the mean .",
    "@xmath59 is the rms scatter in magnitudes of a least square fit .",
    "this illustrates what is likely to be a fatal problem for this particular cosmological model . because dark halos formed in this scenario are quite centrally concentrated ( navarro et al .",
    "1997 ) , the assembly of a massive galaxy at the center raises @xmath16 above and beyond the halo circular velocity , by up to @xmath52 in the standard cdm scenario we investigate here .",
    "the effect of this increase is a significant mismatch of the zero - point in the model tf relation relative to observations .",
    "model galaxies would have to be almost 2 magnitudes brighter in order to match the observed tf relation .",
    "this is highly unlikely , since galaxies in our model contain most of the baryonic material within the virial radius .",
    "the only way to collect a massive disk galaxy without significantly increasing @xmath16 over @xmath9 is to have dark halos which are less dense than those formed in the standard cdm scenario .",
    "this favors low - density ( @xmath60 ) universes , where dark halos are less centrally concentrated ( navarro et al 1997 , navarro 1998 ) . in this case , the problem is further alleviated because the universal baryon fraction is larger ( by a factor @xmath61 ) and therefore massive , bright galaxies can be assembled by collecting a relatively small fraction of baryons into the central galaxy .",
    "1.i-band tully fisher relation at @xmath0 .",
    "the error bars in the simulated data indicate the difference in magnitudes that results from adopting a salpeter or a scalo imf .",
    "as discussed in  2 , our feedback implementation has minimal impact on the rate at which gas cools and collapses to the center of dark matter halos .",
    "the star forming history of a model galaxy thus traces the history of cooling and accretion of gas within halos , punctuated by small `` bursts '' of star formation that coincide with major mergers .",
    "this is shown in figure 2 , where we plot the combined star formation rate of four model galaxies , spanning a factor of @xmath62 in circular velocity .",
    "the large peak at early times is due to the nearly simultaneous collapse of a number of halos which later merge to form the final galaxy .",
    "the star formation rate in each progenitor rarely exceeds @xmath63/yr , although its combined rate can be much higher .",
    "most simulated galaxies form their stars quite early ( half of them typically by @xmath64-@xmath65 ) , and have almost exhausted their gas supply at @xmath0 , when the star formation rate is only about @xmath66-@xmath46 of the global rate averaged over the age of the universe .",
    "these star formation histories are thus similar to those deduced for e / s0/sa galaxies rather than to the nearly constant star formation rates characteristic of late - type spirals ( kennicutt 1998 ) .",
    "2.star formation rate smoothed over @xmath67 yr intervals ( in solar masses per year ) versus lookback time ( in gyr ) for 4 typical halos with virial velocities between 90 and 250 km s@xmath15 .      as discussed in the previous subsection , most gas cools and collapses before the merger events through which the galaxy is finally assembled .",
    "we therefore expect the angular momentum of the model galaxies to be significantly lower than those of disk galaxies , since angular momentum is transferred from the gas to the dark matter during mergers ( navarro , frenk & white 1995 , navarro & steinmetz 1997 ) .",
    "this is shown in figure 3 , where we compare the specific angular momentum of the model galaxies to the disk galaxies in the samples of courteau ( 1997 ) , mathewson et al .",
    "( 1992 ) , and the compilation of navarro ( 1998 ) .",
    "disk angular momenta are estimated assuming that they are pure exponential systems with flat rotation curves , @xmath68 , where @xmath16 is identified with the ( maximum ) rotation speed and @xmath69 is the exponential scalelength .",
    "the solid line shows , for comparison , the typical specific angular momentum of dark halos , @xmath70 km s@xmath71 km s@xmath72 kpc , where @xmath73 is a factor of order unity that depends on the internal structure of halos ( mo et al .",
    "1997 ) and @xmath74 is the usual dimensionless spin parameter , typically found to be @xmath75 in cosmological n - body simulations ( see , e.g. , cole & lacey 1996 ) .",
    "( we assume @xmath9=@xmath16 to plot the halo curve . )",
    "disk angular momenta scale with rotation speed just as @xmath76 scales with circular velocity , suggesting that baryons in disks have retained a roughly constant fraction of the angular momentum of their surrounding halos : about one half if @xmath77 ( see syer , mo & mao 1998 for a more detailed discussion ) .",
    "the simulated galaxies , on the other hand , have specific angular momenta which are more than one order of magnitude lower than those of observed disks .",
    "this confirms that the hierarchical assembly of a galaxy robs the baryonic component of much of its angular momentum if gas cooling and star formation precedes most major mergers .",
    "this angular momentum problem signal that feedback should be more effective at preventing gas from collapsing and cooling in the early stages of the hierarchy in order to ensure that most of the angular momentum is not lost as the luminous component of a galaxy is assembled ( see also weil , eke & efstathiou 1998 ) .",
    "3.specific angular momentum vs circular velocity of model galaxies compared to observational data .",
    "figure 4 shows the redshift evolution of the tf relation in the rest - frame b - band .",
    "the shaded region corresponds to the results at @xmath0 , as reported by pierce & tully ( 1992 ) .",
    "starred symbols show the @xmath64 data of vogt et al .",
    "( 1996 , 1997 ) .",
    "all data have been scaled to the value of @xmath78 used in this paper .",
    "note that for this value of @xmath79 the data from vogt et al .",
    "are consistent with a slight dimming of the tf relation at @xmath64 .",
    "their claim of a modest brightening holds only for the low value of @xmath80 adopted in their analysis .    at @xmath0",
    "the results for the b - band tf relation of simulated galaxies are similar to those presented in figure 1 for the i - band .",
    "the slope and scatter are in good agreement with observations , but the zero - point depends strongly on the radius at which circular velocities are measured .",
    "good agreement is found provided that @xmath9 is used as a measure of the rotation speed , but a significant zero - point offset is observed if @xmath16 is used instead .",
    "independent of which velocity estimator is adopted , the model tf relation brightens at @xmath4 , by @xmath3 or @xmath81 mag , depending on whether @xmath16 or @xmath9 is used , respectively .",
    "this is at odds with the observational results and perhaps a bit surprising since masses scale like @xmath82 at fixed circular velocity ( eq .  1 ) and",
    "are , therefore , a factor of @xmath83 times smaller at @xmath4 .",
    "however , star formation rates are much higher at @xmath4 ( by a factor of @xmath84 ) and the decrease in mass is more than compensated by the higher abundance of young stars present at that time .",
    "this interpretation is confirmed by results in other passbands less sensitive to the instantaneous star formation rate : the k - band tf relation actually dims by about @xmath85-@xmath86 mag between @xmath0 and @xmath87 ( depending again on whether @xmath9 or @xmath16 is used ) .",
    "the brightening trend observed in figure 4 is therefore a direct consequence of the star formation algorithm we use , and not a genuine feature of hierarchical clustering models .",
    "one example is provided by the study of mao , mo & white ( 1998 ) , who use different assumptions for the star formation history of disks , and argue for a roughly constant tf zero - point between @xmath0 and @xmath87 in a cosmological model similar to the one we adopt here .",
    "4.redshift evolution of the rest - frame b - band tully - fisher relation .",
    "we have used high - resolution cosmological simulations which incorporate the effects of gas pressure , hydrodynamical shocks , radiative cooling , star formation and supernova feedback to study the origin of the tf relation of spiral galaxies .",
    "our main conclusion is that the slope ( and scatter ) of this relation is naturally reproduced in hierarchically clustering universes , and reflect the equivalence between mass and circular velocity of systems formed in a cosmological context .",
    "the particular model we explore here ( the standard cdm scenario ) seems unable to account for the zero - point of the correlation .",
    "model galaxies are too faint at @xmath0 ( by about two magnitudes ) if the circular velocity at the edge of the luminous galaxy is used as an estimator of the rotation speed .",
    "this result had already been hinted at , although using different arguments , by semianalytic models of galaxy formation ( kauffmann , white & guiderdoni 1993 , cole et al .  1994 , but see somerville & primack 1997 for a dissenting view ) .    the model tf relation brightens in the past , at odds with current observational evidence .",
    "however , this is a direct result of the particular star formation algorithm we use , which transforms gas into stars very efficiently at high redshift .",
    "efficient gas cooling ( and star formation ) that precedes the final assembly of the galaxy through mergers leads to the formation of stellar systems with angular momenta far lower than those of observed disks .",
    "the combination of successes and failures we report here demonstrate the potential of galaxy scaling laws and their evolution as probes of the intricate physics of star formation and feedback operating in a cosmological context .",
