    "electric - field control of physical properties is highly desirable from fundamental and technological viewpoints , because it does not introduce any chemical or microscopic structural disorder in the pristine material@xcite .",
    "this is also a basis of field effect transistors ( fet ) , in which accumulation , depletion , and inversion layers are formed at the interface@xcite .",
    "`` where is the region , in which carriers are practically injected or depleted by electric fields ? '' is , thus , an important problem relating closely with the operation principle of fet and the electric - field control of physical properties .",
    "although it is quite a fundamental issue , there had been no investigation on evaluating experimentally the dimension of these regions .",
    "we propose a simple but powerful method to observe directly the regions in which the carriers are exhausted or injected by electric fields@xcite . as shown in the fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the source(s)-drain(d ) current in thin film transistors ( tft ) is measured as a function of the film thickness with a bottom - contact configuration .",
    "the gradual change in the conductivity is measured in - situ under the same condition at different gate voltages ( @xmath0 ) avoiding the problem of specimen dependence which is often encountered in the organic films due to the difference in grain size , crystallinity , interface state , etc .",
    "this in - situ and continuous measurement would provide information on the accumulation and depletion layers , which will be described later .    despite the above mentioned advantage , the in - situ and",
    "continuous measurement had not been examined except for a few cases@xcite .",
    "the major reason is that higher substrate temperature is required to obtain a flat film for inorganic semiconductors , and hence the measurement is difficult to be applied .",
    "in contrast , a flat organic film can be obtained even at low substrate temperature , which enables the in - situ and continuous measurement during growth of organic films .    in the present study",
    ", we applied the measurement to pentacene , and evaluated the thickness of the depletion layer and distribution curve of injected carriers in accumulation layer .",
    "the substrate is a highly doped silicon wafer , acting as a gate electrode .",
    "the gate dielectric layer is a 700 nm thermally grown silicon dioxide . on top of the surface ,",
    "30 nm thick gold s , d electrodes were deposited through a shadow mask . the channel length and",
    "the channel width were 100 @xmath1 m and 5.4 mm .",
    "the organic materials used were pentacene ( aldrich ) , sexithiophene ( @xmath2 - 6 t ; synthesized by syncom bv ) , and c@xmath3 ( materials and electrochemical research ) .",
    "organic films were deposited by means of vacuum deposition .",
    "the substrate temperature was kept at 310 k during the growth .",
    "all the measurements were performed under high - vacuum condition .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows s - d current ( @xmath4 ) versus s - d voltage ( @xmath5 ) for the 20 nm thick pentacene tft .",
    "typical p - type semiconductor features are exhibited .",
    "we observed ohmic behavior of the s , d contacts to the pentacene active layer .",
    "the carrier mobility , estimated in the linear transport regime , was 0.23 @xmath6 , which is comparable to the world s highest tft mobility value@xcite .",
    "we then discuss the depletion layer thickness from the in - situ and continuous measurement .",
    "@xmath5 was kept at 1 v and @xmath0 was set at three different voltages ; + 15 , 0 , -15 v. electric fields were not applied during the growth in order to exclude the influence of the electric current on the film growth .",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] shows @xmath4 as a function of pentacene film thickness at different @xmath0 .",
    "tft characteristics were measured at each film thickness to obtain the mobility , and the thickness dependence of the mobility was included in the bottom part of fig .  [ fig3 ] . here",
    "we find the presence of threshold thickness ( @xmath7 ) at which electric current begins to flow .",
    "there are two points to note about @xmath7 .",
    "first , @xmath7 is 0.6 nm at @xmath0=0 v , and electric current is observed even for the 1.0 nm thick film . considering the thickness ( 1.5 nm ) of 1 monolayer ( ml ) pentacene , the present result indicates that the s , d electrodes ( width 100 @xmath1 m ) can be electrically connected by only 1 ml pentacene@xcite .",
    "second , @xmath7 shows clear @xmath0 dependence , and it shifts up to 5.0 nm at @xmath0=15 v. when positive @xmath0 is applied to p - type semiconductors , the depletion layer with a low conductance is formed at the semiconductor / insulator interface .",
    "therefore , on the thin limit , the whole film can be depleted , and @xmath4 does not flow at positive @xmath0 .",
    "consequently , @xmath7 ( 5.0 nm ) corresponds to the thickness of the depletion layer at @xmath0=15 v. by the in - situ and continuous measurement , the thickness of the depletion layer can be observed directly as a shift of @xmath7 .    in order to discuss the meaning of the depletion thickness",
    ", we will try to apply the conventional model which has been already established for inorganic semiconductors . in the depletion approximation@xcite ,",
    "the carrier density is given by @xmath8 where @xmath9 , @xmath10 : thickness of the depletion layer , @xmath11 : dielectric constant of sio@xmath12 , @xmath13 : thickness of sio@xmath12 .",
    "using @xmath10=5.0 nm at @xmath0=15 v , the carrier density amounts to @xmath14=9.3@xmath1510@xmath16 @xmath17 . considering the mobility ( @xmath1=0.21 @xmath6 ) at @xmath10=5.0 nm ,",
    "the conductivity of pentacene is 3.1@xmath1510@xmath18 @xmath19@xmath20 for the 5.0 nm thick film .",
    "this value is obtained on the basis of fet characteristics . on the other hand",
    ", the conductivity can be calculated from @xmath4 ( 6.9@xmath1510@xmath21 a ) for the 5.0 nm thick film at @xmath0=0 v , taking account of the channel width and the channel length .",
    "this yields the conductivity of 2.6@xmath1510@xmath18 @xmath19@xmath20 .",
    "the fair agreement between these two values indicates the validity of the above estimation , showing that the depletion layer of the organic tft can be explained in terms of the conventional model applicable for inorganic semiconductors .",
    "clear @xmath0 dependence of @xmath7 was observed also for other organic films , 6 t and c@xmath3 . in case of 6 t",
    ", @xmath7 is 5.0 nm at @xmath0=15 v , while the onset was not observed even for the 100 nm thick c@xmath3 film at @xmath0=-15 v. the thickness of the depletion layer is inversely proportional to the major carrier concentration of the semiconductors .",
    "therefore , the onset was not observed for c@xmath3 with a low carrier concentration .",
    "here , we comment the carrier concentration of the present specimens .",
    "we used as - received specimens without extra purification , and thus the impurity ( carrier ) concentration is rather high , resulting in a small on / off ratio of fig .",
    ". however , the high carrier concentration never affects the present estimation of depletion layer , instead helps observe the depletion layer as a delay of the onset at moderate condition ( 5 nm at @xmath0=15 v ) , and assure the uniformity of electric field in the thin film thickness region .",
    "in the previous section , we have discussed the thickness of the depletion layer .",
    "we now proceed to the accumulation layer , relating closely with the electric - field control of physical properties through charge injection . here",
    ", we assume electric fields at the interface are determined only by @xmath0 , independently of film thickness , and hence the differentiation ( @xmath22 ) corresponds to the local conductance at the distance @xmath23 from the interface .",
    "the carrier density ( @xmath24 ) can be approximated by dividing the local conductance by the mobility @xmath1(@xmath23 ) ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) under the condition that the mobility is constant in the whole film at each film thickness .",
    "the carrier density thus obtained is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] as a function of the distance @xmath23 from the interface .",
    "the large carrier density at @xmath0=0 v in small @xmath23 region is due to the charge transfer from the au electrodes to the pentacene molecules .",
    "the density of the carriers injected by electric fields @xmath25 is , thus , the difference between the carrier density @xmath26 at @xmath0=-15 v and @xmath27 at @xmath0=0 v. as seen in the figure , @xmath25 decays steeply with increasing @xmath23 , meaning that the injected carriers are localized at the interface .",
    "the thickness of the accumulation layer is much smaller than that of the depletion layer , which is estimated to be 5.0 nm in the previous section . for quantitative estimation on the thickness of the accumulation layer",
    ", @xmath25 is fitted with an exponential function ( @xmath28 ) .",
    "the fitted value of @xmath29=0.91 nm can be considered as an effective thickness of the accumulation layer , which is just thinner than 1 ml . in other words , most of carriers are localized in the first ml next to the interface .",
    "the obtained results on the accumulation and depletion layers can be a guide to the operation principle of organic tft and electric - field control of physical properties by field induced charge injection .",
    "since charge carries reside in the first one ml from the interface , the physical properties only at the interface could be controlled by the charge injection .",
    "this implies the importance of a well - ordered interface through which charges are efficiently injected .",
    "furthermore , we propose that the semiconductor - metal or -superconductor transition is a promising target to study . when the semiconductor - metal transition occurs by charge injection ,",
    "metallic and semiconducting regions sit side by side with only an atomic distance apart in the organic film . under this situation",
    ", free carries can interact with exciton , associated with the semiconductor , at the interface , thus leading a possible ground for superconductivity by exciton mechanism@xcite .",
    "in conclusion , we present the in - situ and continuous measurement of the conductivity of growing organic films , as a simple but powerful method to determine the distribution curve of injected carriers and the dimension of the accumulation and depletion layers .",
