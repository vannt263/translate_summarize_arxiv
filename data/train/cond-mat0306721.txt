    "this paper discusses the influence of disorder on the properties of weakly hole doped cuprate materials . in cuprates ,",
    "the superconducting state emerges through chemical doping of a parent compound which is insulating and shows antiferromagnetic ( af ) order with a high critical nel temperature of typically a few hundred kelvin . as a consequence of chemical doping , the compounds are intrinsically disordered . especially at weak doping concentrations , disorder is known to strongly influence the behavior of these materials .",
    "this is evident in the simplest cuprate superconductor , @xmath0 , where the superconducting phase emerges via doping directly from a low temperature spin glass ( sg ) phase .",
    "recently , glassy characteristics were detected even inside the superconducting phase ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for a summary of the available experimental data ) .    understanding the very weak doping regime of cuprates",
    ", the insulating af and sg regime , should be relatively simple .",
    "this optimism is based on the belief that this regime is dominated by the behavior of isolated holes in presence of well developed af moments .",
    "the single hole properties seem now to be quite well understood and early theories of high temperature superconductivity were constructed from these one - hole wave functions .",
    "shraiman and siggia @xcite proposed a theory of interacting hole - quasiparticles based on the one - hole picture and predicted the formation of spiral correlations with a pitch proportional to the hole density .",
    "experiments have to date however not found any evidence of such spiral correlations inside the superconducting phase . the pairing mechanism suggested by this semiclassical picture , a dipole - dipole interaction between holes mediated by soft spin waves,@xcite has , perhaps unfairly , received scant attention of late .",
    "a potential weakness of the approach is the semiclassical treatment of spins ( large @xmath3 ) , which implies the assumption of a large af correlation length , whereas in the superconducting phase the spins are believed to form some kind of quantum disordered spin liquid",
    ". the scattering of holes by spin excitations would then be qualitatively different at large scales .",
    "however , while the semiclassical theory is formulated for large scales , the structure and energy of the resulting two - hole bound state is determined by the shortest cutoff in the system@xcite , where af correlations are still intact .",
    "furthermore , the correlation length can be substantial even in superconducting samples , e.g. it exceeds 200   in the stripe compound la@xmath4nd@xmath5sr@xmath6cuo@xmath7.@xcite thus , the pairing mechanism suggested by the semiclassical picture may hide some truth despite the absence of long range order .    while a semiclassical approach to the superconducting regime may or may not be valid , at sufficiently low hole concentrations , where static af correlations are still dominant , i.  e. in the sg and af phase , a semiclassical treatment of spins is certainly justified .",
    "however , at these low densities , where the system is still a mott insulator , screening is very poor and long - range coulomb interaction leads to a strong disorder potential which must be taken into account .",
    "here we discuss a model in which the entire charge distribution is assumed to be quenched .",
    "each hole , localized close to an ionized dopant , is assumed to produce a long - ranged dipolar - shaped frustration of the af , similar to the one known to be produced by delocalized holes .",
    "a polarization of the dipole moments then implies the appearance of spiral correlations .",
    "it is known that the spiral state described by shraiman and siggia , if one ignores disorder , is unstable toward a local enhancement of the spiral pitch .",
    "this instability arises from the fermionic susceptibility of the holes and may signal an instability towards charge density formation or phase separation.@xcite however , if the holes are quenched this instability is suppressed . therefore , disorder takes a prominent role in the creation of a spiral state .",
    "we here develop a renormalization approach for disordered spiral phases , where we study the scaling of the spin stiffness and of the disorder .",
    "the importance of topological defects of the spiral texture is analyzed and their relevance for the physics of the spin glass phase is discussed .",
    "undoped @xmath8 is a charge transfer insulator with an antiferromagnetically ordered ground - state .",
    "it is well described by a simple square lattice spin-@xmath9 heisenberg model , @xmath10 with the antiferromagnetic exchange @xmath11k . the sum is over nearest neighbor pairs of sites and @xmath12 are spin-@xmath9 operators .    in the study of magnetism of @xmath13 , an approach based on the quantum - non - linear-@xmath14 model ( qnl@xmath14 m )",
    "has been highly successful .",
    "it correctly describes the long wavelength hydrodynamic modes ( spin waves ) of the heisenberg model.@xcite in this continuum model , it is assumed that the antiferromagnetic correlation length is much larger than the lattice spacing and the model describes slow fluctuations of the locally well defined staggered magnetization @xmath15 ( with @xmath16 ) .",
    "the qnl@xmath14 m action is @xmath17 the spin stiffness @xmath18 and the spin wave velocity @xmath19 should be viewed as phenomenological parameters to be determined either from experiment or from other techniques such as spin wave theory or numerical simulations .",
    "the coupling constant of the model is @xmath20 ( @xmath21 is a high frequency cutoff ) .",
    "there is a zero temperature quantum phase transition at @xmath22 from a phase with long - range order ( @xmath23 , `` renormalized classical regime '' ) to a phase which exists for @xmath24 and which is quantum disordered with only finite spin correlations and no static magnetic order .",
    "it is now firmly believed that the @xmath25 heisenberg model described by ( [ sqlh ] ) has @xmath23 .",
    "measurements of the correlation length of @xmath8 have been fitted extremely well with the qnl@xmath14 m predictions for the renormalized classical regime.@xcite    once holes are added to the cuo@xmath26 planes , the magnetism becomes rather complex .",
    "[ niederm ] summarizes the magnetic phase diagram at weak doping concentrations of @xmath0 and @xmath27.@xcite here , we concentrate on @xmath0 . for very small sr concentration ,",
    "the most dramatic effect is a rapid reduction of @xmath28 with the complete destruction of long - range order occurring at a critical doping value of roughly @xmath29 .",
    "further , a spin freezing is observed inside the af phase below a temperature @xmath30 which scales linearly with the sr concentration , @xmath31k@xmath32 for @xmath33 .",
    "this spin freezing is inferred from a broad distribution of extremely slow relaxation times measured with local probes such as la nuclear quadrupole resonance @xcite ( nqr ) and muon spin resonance @xcite ( @xmath34sr ) .",
    "surprisingly , while at higher temperatures doping leads to a reduction of the local staggered moments , at temperatures lower than about 30 k the staggered moments recover and at zero temperature they are practically doping independent and approach the value of the undoped compound,@xcite see the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ niederm ] .",
    "however , the distribution of staggered moments is broad at finite doping , with a variance which is again simply linear in @xmath35 , see fig .",
    "[ niederm ] bottom.@xcite both the recovery of the staggered moments and the broad distribution of relaxation times are reminiscent of a transverse spin glass state , in which the transverse spin wave modes of the af freeze in a static but random pattern .",
    "these are clear signatures of disorder in the weakly doped af phase .",
    "this is further corroborated by transport measurements , which show a behavior typical for random systems.@xcite at temperatures below @xmath3650 k the conductivity roughly follows variable range hopping characteristics while at higher temperatures a thermally activated conductivity is observed , with activation energies of about 19 mev.@xcite this indicates that the holes localize near the randomly distributed sr donors .    both the presence of finite staggered magnetic moments and the broad distribution of slow relaxation times persist also above @xmath37 where long - range order is destroyed.@xcite again , there is a recovery of the staggered moments at very low temperatures , although the zero temperature moment is now slightly smaller than in the undoped compound .",
    "the @xmath35 dependence of @xmath30 follows now roughly a @xmath38 scaling .",
    "the regime @xmath39 is well described as a conventional spin glass ( sg ) and shows characteristic non - ergodic behavior.@xcite the freezing transition temperature @xmath30 in this regime can thus be identified as a sg transition temperature @xmath40 . the fact that staggered moments persist also above @xmath41 is important and excludes the possibility that the transition at @xmath41 is a disordering transition driven by quantum fluctuations as described in the qnl@xmath14 m formulation above .",
    "it is often argued that upon hole doping , the reshuffling of the spins by mobile holes leads to enhanced quantum fluctuations of the spins which would eventually drive the spin system past the quantum critical point of the qnl@xmath14 model , driving the af into a spin liquid phase . as the transition at @xmath41 is not followed by a spin liquid phase but rather a sg this scenario does not apply for the af - sg transition .",
    "only recently , it was found that the short ranged magnetic order in the sg regime is incommensurate , with a maximum of the imaginary part of the susceptibility located at the in - plane wave vector ( @xmath42 , @xmath43 ) , in units of @xmath44 where @xmath45 is the cu lattice spacing.@xcite here , @xmath46 is the incommensurability which roughly follows @xmath47 .",
    "this incommensurability has often been interpreted as diagonal stripe formation , even though no signatures of a charge modulation were observed .",
    "rather , all experiments point toward a quenched charge distribution and we thus argue that a more likely explanation is the formation of short ranged spiral order .",

    "thus , one might hope to gain considerable insight into these phases by solving the one - hole problem first and to proceed from there on .",
    "as mentioned in the beginning , the understanding of the spin - polaron state arising from one hole in an antiferromagnetic background is by now quite mature.@xcite for the @xmath53 model , the bottom of the dressed hole band lies at the zone face centers @xmath54 and the bandwidth scales with @xmath55 . because of the presence of two sub - lattices , there exists a pseudo - spin degeneracy for each @xmath56 vector .",
    "an important characteristic of the hole wave function is that it describes a long - ranged dipolar distortion of the af order which arises from a coupling of the spin current carried by the hole to the magnetization current of the af background.@xcite relative to the position of the moving hole , the fourier transform of the transverse spin deviations is then proportional to @xmath57,@xcite where @xmath58 , i.e.  the staggered magnetization shows a dipolar pattern in real space identical to the one produced by an isolated ferromagnetic bond , see sec .",
    "[ fbonds ] .",
    "the sr impurity position , located above the center of a cu plaquette , has a high symmetry and couples to both sub - lattices in the same way , so that the pseudo - spin degeneracy mentioned above should survive also in the bound hole state .",
    "the bound hole state is a superposition of plane wave states describing the mobile hole . for sufficiently weakly bound holes",
    ", we expect the main weight of the bound hole wave function to remain at wave vectors close to @xmath59 or equivalent positions , and , depending on the relative phases and the weight of these pockets , dipolar or quadrupolar frustration is associated with the localized hole .",
    "we note that dipolar frustration was also suggested by aharony _",
    "et al . _ for o doped systems , caused by a localization of holes in the o site with the liberation of one of the spins from the o @xmath60 state,@xcite leading to an effective ferromagnetic coupling for the two cu spins joint by the o. while the microscopic origin of frustration in the aharony model is very different from the quantum mechanical one that we assume here ,",
    "the phenomenological spin - only model we employ below is not sensitive to the microscopic details . in either case , the dipole moment of the localized hole state is characterized by two vectors , one in spin- and one in real space . the real space vector characterizing the dipole is simply the orientation of the ferromagnetic bond in the aharony picture while it is determined by the four coefficients @xmath61 and by the equivalent wave vectors of the bound hole wave function in the quantum mechanical model .",
    "the coupling to the spin background is then identical in both models .",
    "here we simply assume that the localized hole produces dipolar frustration and , rather than relating our phenomenological coupling parameters to a microscopic model , we derive our parameters from a comparison to experiments . as we discuss below",
    ", the dipole model can quite well explain all the important characteristics of the magnetism of the weakly doped af and sg phase .",
    "let us further mention that for sr doping , it was proposed that a chiral spin current is induced on the four cu sites closest to the sr impurity which leads to a skyrmion - like distortion of the af , where the mechanism of frustration is again the coupling between spin and background magnetization currents.@xcite    in section [ afphase ] we introduce the dipolar frustration model , summarize the main results of previous studies on this model , and discuss how they compare with experiments . in section [ noncollinear ]",
    "we first derive an extension of the model to allow for non - collinear correlations which arise from dipole ordering .",
    "we perform a rg calculation to understand the influence of disorder and discuss the importance of topological defects of the spin texture .",
    "finally , in section [ compexp ] our results are compared with neutron scattering data on the sg phase of @xmath62 .",
    "we find that the sg phase can be described as a strongly disordered spiral phase in which topological defects proliferate .",
    "we briefly sketch here the basis of the dipolar frustration model and the results of previous studies of this model in the collinear limit . the model",
    "as presented in this section is applicable only for the antiferromagnetic phase in which the dipoles do not have a preferred direction . at high temperatures , the collinear theory can then be used .",
    "we will show in the next section however , that the collinear model is not able to describe the low temperature and/or strong disorder regime , where non - collinear behavior emerges .    in the dipole model",
    ", it is assumed that each localized hole produces dipolar frustration .",
    "it is then possible to study the magnetism of the hole doped materials completely ignoring the charge degrees of freedom and to work with the spin sector only .",
    "further , as there are clear indications of static af correlations for @xmath63 , the antiferromagnet should be well described within the renormalized classical regime of the qnl@xmath14 m . in this regime ,",
    "quantum fluctuations simply lead to a renormalization of the coupling constant of the classical model",
    ". a classical model should thus suffice to describe the relevant physics in the af and sg regime .",
    "dipolar frustration was first discussed in the general context of insulating spin glasses by villain.@xcite the simplest way of producing dipolar spin textures is by placing a ferromagnetic bond in an otherwise af magnet , whose order parameter we denote by @xmath15 . at a distance @xmath64 away from the ferromagnetic bond ,",
    "this leads to a deviation of the nel order @xmath65 . here",
    ", @xmath66 is a vector both in spin and lattice space , where @xmath67,2 are the indices of the 2d lattice vector .",
    "the spin part corresponds to the local ferromagnetic moment ( with @xmath68 ) produced by the bond and the lattice part corresponds to the orientation of the bond on the lattice ( see fig .",
    "[ dipolst ] ) .",
    "this can be easily derived in a harmonic continuum approximation , where the energy density of the magnet away from the impurity is proportional to @xmath69 ^ 2 $ ] and the classical equation of motion is @xmath70 . for any impurity distribution ,",
    "the solution for @xmath71 can thus be written in a multipole expansion . as the monopole moment is energetically too costly@xcite",
    "the lowest order contributions , consistent with the symmetry of the one - bond problem , are dipolar .",
    "dipolar distortions produced by a ferromagnetic bond , width=188 ]      because of the long - range nature of dipolar frustration , a continuum field theory , such as a ( classical ) non - linear @xmath14-model ( nl@xmath14 m ) , should be well suited for a treatment of this problem . while the dipole spin structure discussed above",
    "is a solution of the harmonic theory , it is not a solution of the 2d nl@xmath14 m .",
    "nonetheless one can study the dipole model within the nl@xmath14 m , if one introduces the dipolar frustration through a minimal coupling scheme . as mentioned in ref .",
    "[ @xcite ] , the dipolar frustration can be reproduced ( on the harmonic level ) via a coupling of the dipoles to the gradient of the order parameter @xmath72 of the nl@xmath14 m .",
    "thus , within a nl@xmath14 m approach , the reduced hamiltonian of the model can be written as @xcite ( the factor @xmath73 is included in the hamiltonian and we set @xmath74=1 ) @xmath75 where @xmath16 , @xmath76 is the spin stiffness ( renormalized by quantum fluctuations ) , @xmath51 the temperature , @xmath15 a three component unit vector representing the local staggered moment and @xmath66 is a field representing the dipoles .",
    "we did not include here small corrections which lower the spin symmetry from heisenberg to xy or ising .",
    "while these are known to be present both in the undoped and weakly doped compounds @xcite , they have a very small characteristic energy scale and , as a first approximation , we set them to zero .",
    "note however that these terms dominate the static magnetic susceptibility near the nel transition . for a random distribution of localized dipoles",

    "this can be seen once short scale fluctuations are integrated out under a renormalization procedure.@xcite an integration over the short scale fluctuations up to a scale @xmath81 ( but @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the 2d spin correlation length ) leads to an effective interaction term of the form @xmath84=\\frac{\\rho_s { \\cal m}^2}{2 t } \\sum_{i , j } j_{ij } { \\bf m}_i \\cdot { \\bf m}_j\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath85 and @xmath86 thus , for an average separation of dipoles @xmath87 there is a random interaction among dipoles with a characteristic energy @xmath88 .",
    "it was further shown @xcite that at high temperatures , @xmath89 , the presence of dipoles lead to a renormalized effective stiffness @xmath90 .",
    "thus , the correlation length at high temperatures ( and small @xmath35 ) has the form @xmath91 this result agrees to lowest order in @xmath35 with that obtained by cherepanov _",
    "@xcite in a related renormalization group ( rg ) calculation where they calculated @xmath92 up to order @xmath93 .",

    "the doping dependence of @xmath28 was also found to be consistent with the dipole model.@xcite     @xmath95 data from la nqr relaxation measurements for @xmath62 and various @xmath96 , from ref .",
    "[ @xcite].,width=188 ]    a second independent test of the value of @xmath97 is to consider the spin relaxation times inside the af phase .",
    "this can be understood already within the theoretical framework just presented , using arguments similar to those from ref .",
    "@xcite where spin relaxation has been discussed within a slightly different frustration model .",
    "the relaxation rates inside the af phase can be explained within the dipole theory if one assumes that the relaxation is driven by the interaction among dipoles and hence controlled by the parameter @xmath97 . at temperatures well above the actual freezing temperature ,",
    "an arrhenius law is observed , with a characteristic energy @xmath98k@xmath35 , see fig .",
    "[ relax ] .",
    "the above estimate of @xmath97 correctly reproduces the linear scaling of the relaxation energy with @xmath35 and also gives a good estimate for the slope . with @xmath99 ,",
    "@xmath100 mev @xcite one obtains @xmath101k@xmath35 . considering that this is a very rough approximation ,",
    "the value is not too far off from the experimental one .",
    "we mention further that the linear scaling of the width of the distribution of local staggered moments is also consistent with a dipole model.@xcite",
    "while the dipole model presented above can well explain the temperature and doping dependence of the correlation length not just in the af but also , to some extent , in the sg regime,@xcite theoretical investigations of the model have always predicted ( or rather assumed ) short ranged commensurate antiferromagnetism .",
    "the recent observation of incommensurate ( ic ) correlations for the regime @xmath39 requires therefore a new approach to the sg phase.@xcite    as a possible explanation for the presence of ic correlations , a disordered striped phase has been proposed , similar to the ordered striped phase found near @xmath102 . while there is indeed an instability in the striped phase toward a disordered phase at low @xmath35,@xcite it is unlikely that the stripes will survive in presence of strong disorder .",
    "in fact , recent numerical simulations of shraimann - siggia dipoles with disorder have shown that the latter leads to a destruction of the stripe phase.@xcite    in the spin glass regime , there are two competing length scales .",
    "the first is related to the average separation between disorder centers ( sr ions ) @xmath103 which scales as @xmath104 .",
    "the other is the scaling of the periodicity @xmath105 associated with the incommensurability , which scales as @xmath106 . for small @xmath35 , @xmath107 . in a stripe scenario",
    "the charge distribution would also have a periodicity which scales with @xmath105 .",
    "thus , in a striped phase the charge can not take full advantage of the disorder .",
    "the stripes must either break up into short segments or reduce their on - stripe charge density considerably to take advantage of the disorder potential .",
    "instead we propose here a theory in which the charges are completely disordered and the incommensurability exists only in the spin sector .",
    "then , there is no conflict between the two scales @xmath105 and @xmath103 as @xmath105 relates only to the spins whereas @xmath103 characterizes the charge distribution .",
    "notice that even in the case that short segments of stripes should be present , these stripes would lose their anti - phase domain wall character and instead act like a row of ferromagnetic bonds , again causing dipolar frustration .",
    "thus , the theory we present here applies both to the case of localized hole states which produce dipolar frustration as it does to a system of randomly placed stripe segments .",
    "we view the scenario of localized holes however as the more plausible one .",
    "it is easy to see how the dipole model can lead to ic correlations.@xcite the hamiltonian eq .",
    "( [ dipham ] ) favors the formation of a spiral phase , with a non - zero average twist @xmath108 of the af order and a simultaneous alignment of the dipoles , @xmath109 , as long as the lattice and spin degrees of freedom of dipoles are annealed and free to orient themselves .",
    "the lattice position of the @xmath110 dopants ( located above the center of a @xmath111 plaquette ) , which pin the holes , suggests that this freedom indeed exists .",
    "we emphasize that a spatially homogeneous distribution of dipoles is not required for the formation of spiral correlations .",
    "the preferred orientation of the lattice part of the @xmath66 vector is determined by the nature of the localized hole state and therefore should reflect the symmetries of the underlying lattice .",

    "we here investigate the dipole model allowing for the presence of non - zero ordered moments but assume a random spatial distribution of the dipoles .",

    "this limit is approached as @xmath321 and @xmath322 with finite @xmath323 .",
    "thus , depending on whether one approaches the point @xmath324 with a slope larger or smaller than the critical one given by @xmath325 , one arrives at the disordered phase or the ordered phase of the xy model .",
    "this behavior is correctly reproduced by the free energy argument .",
    "the validity of the critical curve @xmath325 also for finite @xmath326 is at least plausible , as topological defect solutions also survive in this limit . below this line , the rg eqs .",

    "disorder will lead to the formation of free defects if @xmath329 . according to the free energy argument above",

    "the correct dependence of the correlation length at @xmath252 on the disorder is expected to be an interpolation between the nl@xmath14 m result and the xy behavior .",

    "numerical results do however not support such a scenario and rather point to the existence of a finite critical temperature.@xcite below we shall apply the free energy argument with the bare parameters , i.e. at the smallest possible scale , which , if anything , would overestimate the stability of the system against free defect formation .",
    "let us now compare our results with experimental data on the sg phase of @xmath0 .",
    "neutron scattering data @xcite have revealed an incommensurability of the spins which scales roughly linearly with @xmath35 . at",
    "very small @xmath35 , a small deviation from the linear dependence is observed .",
    "both features can be explained within the dipole model .",
    "the linear scaling is reproduced if the fraction of the dipoles which are ordered is doping independent , i.e. , the number of ordered dipoles scales linearly with doping .",
    "the deviation from linearity might be explained with the increase of the average separation between dipoles at small @xmath35 and a resulting diminished tendency of the dipoles to align .",
    "the same experimental data also shows the strong one dimensional character of the ic modulation , i.e. the incommensurability is observed only in one diagonal of the cu - lattice ( @xmath112-direction ) and thus breaks the symmetry of the square lattice .",
    "this phenomenon is usually interpreted as being due to the existence of charge and spin stripes running along the other diagonal ( @xmath45-direction ) . however",
    ", this ic is also expected for a spiral along the @xmath112-direction because its chirality breaks the translation symmetry ( it can spiral clock- or anticlock - wise ) .",
    "in addition , this symmetry breaking is expected to show long - range order because the dipoles prefer a discrete set of lattice orientations .",
    "another important consequence of the spiral chirality is the formation of topological defects . to judge , whether or not topological defects play a role in the lsco sg phase",
    ", we need an estimate of @xmath222 . we can use as a lower bound for @xmath222 the result obtained from the collinear analysis @xcite where a disorder parameter equivalent to ours , but defined on the much smaller scale of the af unit cell , was used .",
    "> from a fit of the @xmath35 dependence of the correlation length at @xmath96 and large temperatures @xmath333 , one obtains @xmath334 . in this regime of @xmath35 ,",
    "the low temperature phase has long - range af order and a collinear analysis is well justified .",
    "we assume that the linear dependence of the disorder parameter on @xmath35 , @xmath334 , also holds in the sg regime .",
    "this view is supported by measurements , which found that the width of the distribution of internal magnetic fields ( i.e. local staggered moments ) increases simply linearly with doping , with no detectable change on crossing the af / sg phase boundary,@xcite see also fig .",
    "[ niederm ] .",
    "it is remarkable that with our above estimate for the critical disorder strength @xmath314 we find a critical doping concentration @xmath335 . considering that @xmath334 is a conservative lower bound of @xmath222 at the long length scales relevant to spirals ,",
    "we conclude that in the entire sg phase , free topological defects will be present already at @xmath252 , leading to a strongly disordered spiral phase .",
    "experiments have in fact shown that the correlation lengths in the sg regime are rather short and of the same order as the periodicity of the ic modulation.@xcite while this is in accordance with the expected presence of topological defects , the correlation lengths are so short that the condition @xmath336 is not fulfilled .",
    "the regime where spiral correlations become dominant is therefore barely reached , and the rg scaling predictions can not be well tested .",
    "while qualitatively the experimental data supports a description of the sg phase as a strongly disordered spiral state , both the extremely short correlation lengths and our limited understanding of topological defects prevent a more quantitative comparison .    however , our suggestion that the incommensurability of the spins is related to ordered dipolar frustration centers can be directly tested experimentally on co - doped samples @xmath337 .",
    "zn replaces cu in the cuo@xmath26 planes and effectively removes one spin .",
    "zn doping leads therefore to a dilution of the af but does not introduce frustration .",
    "dilution is not very effective in destroying the af order and pure zn doping ( with @xmath338 ) leads to a destruction of long - range order only at percolation threshold that occurs for @xmath339 41% .",
    "@xcite surprisingly , for very small sr concentration @xmath340 it was found that co - doping with zn can increase @xmath28.@xcite this is remarkable as both kinds of impurities lead to a reduction of @xmath28 in singly doped samples .",
    "a possible explanation for this behavior was suggested by korenblit _",
    "et al._@xcite they put forward an argument , that zn impurities , if placed close enough to the localized hole state , will destroy the frustrating nature of the hole bound state .",
    "while their microscopic picture of frustration is a classical one , a zn impurity is also expected to strongly influence the properties of the bound hole state within a more realistic quantum mechanical picture of frustration .",
    "although zn couples only weakly to the spin degrees of freedom , if placed near a sr donor , it disturbs the symmetry around the sr atom and modifies the nature of the bound hole state .",
    "as the zn impurity breaks the sublattice pseudo - spin degeneracy of the bound hole , the orientation of the dipole moment is no longer annealed but becomes quenched .",
    "another effect of the breaking of the sublattice symmetry is that the weight of the bound hole wave function near the wavevector @xmath341 or equivalent points will be reduced .",
    "as it is these wavevectors which are responsible for frustrating the spin background , one would expect a reduction or possibly a complete destruction of the frustration caused by the hole .",
    "hence , the effective density of dipoles will be renormalized to @xmath342 where @xmath343 must be calculated from a microscopic theory ( experiments indicate that @xmath343 is of order 2).@xcite co - doping with zn then has two effects : first , it lowers the amount of frustration in the sample and thus increases the correlation length , which would explain the experimentally observed increase of @xmath28 with z for @xmath344.@xcite furthermore , the effect of quenching the dipole moments will be the same as destroying them altogether with respect to the incommensurability , as the incommensurability is determined solely by the ordered moments .",
    "thus , co - doping with zn will lead to a decrease of the incommensurability by a factor @xmath345 .",
    "in contrast , within a stripe picture , co - doping with zn is not expected to change the incommensurability as the hole density is not affected by zn doping .",
    "previous measurements in the superconducting phase ( @xmath346 and @xmath347 ) , where the stripe model is believed to be valid , have shown that the incommensurability indeed remains intact upon co - doping with zn.@xcite . within a stripe picture , the only effect of zn co - doping in the sg regime should be pinning of stripes , which would lead to a reduced correlation length.@xcite",
    "therefore , neutron scattering experiments within the sg regime of zn co - doped samples could clarify the debate , if the magnetic incommensurability observed in the sg regime is to be interpreted within a stripe or a frustration based model .",
    "it is interesting that symmetry arguments similar to those just used to discuss zn co - doping also give a simple explanation for the absence of any incommensurate signal in li doped la@xmath348cu@xmath349li@xmath350o@xmath7 . for small @xmath262 ,",
    "these compounds show a magnetic phase diagram which is almost identical to sr doped samples@xcite with the notable exception that the magnetic correlations always remain commensurate.@xcite like sr , each li atom introduces an excess hole in the cuo@xmath26 plane which , at least for small doping concentrations , remains weakly localized to its dopant .",
    "the important difference is that li replaces cu in the crystal and thus has a different symmetry with respect to the magnetic sublattice ordering than a sr hole .",
    "specifically , the sublattice position of the li atom breaks the pseudospin degeneracy present in sr doped samples .",
    "assuming that otherwise the origin of frustration is the same , the only difference between sr and li doped samples is that the dipole moment assigned to the li bound hole is quenched , whereas the one of the sr hole is annealed .",
    "thus , ordering of these moments and the development of incommensurate correlations can not occur in li doped samples .    in conclusion ,",
    "we have presented a detail picture of the dipole model of frustration and discussed its applicability to the weakly doped regime of cuprate materials .",
    "most of the key characteristics of these materials were already known to be in accordance with the model and we showed that incommensurate correlations appear also naturally within the dipole picture .",
    "we extended the commensurate model to allow for a description of the resulting disordered spiral spin phases .",
    "finally , we suggested an experiment which would allow to verify whether the frustration based dipole model or the stripe picture is realized within the weakly doped regime of cuprates .",

    "<S> we investigate a phenomenological model for the spin glass phase of @xmath0 , in which it is assumed that holes doped into the @xmath1 planes localize near their sr dopant , where they cause a dipolar frustration of the antiferromagnetic environment . in absence of long - range antiferromagnetic order , </S>",
    "<S> the spin system can reduce frustration , and also its free energy , by forming a state with an ordered orientation of the dipole moments , which leads to the appearance of spiral spin correlations . to investigate this model , a non - linear sigma model </S>",
    "<S> is used in which disorder is introduced via a randomly fluctuating gauge field . </S>",
    "<S> a renormalization group study shows that the collinear fixed point of the model is destroyed through the disorder and that the disorder coupling leads to an additive renormalization of the order parameter stiffness . </S>",
    "<S> further , the stability of the spiral state against the formation of topological defects is investigated with the use of the replica trick . </S>",
    "<S> a critical disorder strength is found beyond which topological defects proliferate . </S>",
    "<S> comparing our results with experimental data , it is found that for a hole density @xmath2 , i.e. in the entire spin glass regime , the disorder strength exceeds the critical threshold . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , some experiments are proposed in order to distinguish if the incommensurabilities observed in neutron scattering experiments correspond to a diagonal stripe or a spiral phase . </S>"
