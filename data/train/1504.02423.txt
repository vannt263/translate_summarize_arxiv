    "in standard textbooks , the lorentz transformation equations , which connect inertial reference frames , are deduced from the invariance of the speed of light , which implies the invariance of the minkowski interval .",
    "@xcite a different approach , however , was followed by von ignatowsky.@xcite only six years after the formulation of special relativity , he proved that the lorentz transformations arise under quite general conditions , without assuming _ a priori _ the existence of an invariant speed .",
    "von ignatowsky showed that the only admissible transformations consistent with the principle of inertia , the isotropy of space , the absence of preferred inertial frames , and a group structure ( i.e. , closure under composition ) , are the lorentz transformations , in which @xmath0 can be any velocity scale , or the galilei transformations .",
    "this surprising result shows that the lorentz transformations are not directly related to the properties of electromagnetic radiation .",
    "electromagnetism is only relevant , if present within the theory , as a way to fix the arbitrary velocity scale , which is then identified with the speed of light .",
    "this deep and fascinating result , although well known in the specialized literature , @xcite is not commonly found in textbooks,@xcite because its usual proof is rather complicated and uninspiring .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to present a derivation of the von ignatowsky result using elementary considerations which , in our opinion , shed new light on the result .",
    "we wish to characterize the transformations that relate two different inertial frames .",
    "let us consider two inertial observers @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "let @xmath3 and @xmath4 be space and time coordinates for @xmath1 and @xmath5 and @xmath6 be the corresponding quantities for @xmath2 .",
    "in order to simplify the argument , we will restrict our considerations to the subgroup of transformations involving @xmath7 and @xmath4 only , setting @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "this is equivalent to choosing coordinates so that @xmath1 and @xmath2 are in relative motion along the @xmath7 and @xmath10 direction.@xcite    -axis.,width=321 ]    we assume the validity of the principle of inertia : in an inertial frame free particles undergo rectilinear motion with constant speed .",
    "therefore , if the trajectory of a particle is a straight line in the frame of observer @xmath1 and its speed is constant , the trajectory is also a straight line in the frame of observer @xmath2 and also the speed in the new frame is constant .",
    "this condition implies @xcite that the two inertial frames are related by a _ linear",
    "_ transformation .",
    "we can therefore write @xmath11 where we have defined the time coordinates @xmath12 and @xmath13 , measured in units of distance , as @xmath14 where @xmath15 is an _",
    "arbitrary _ constant with units of speed .",
    "the inverse transformation follows immediately : @xmath16 with @xmath17    it is useful to rewrite the transformation in matrix notation , introducing @xmath18 and its inverse @xmath19 then , we have @xmath20 and @xmath21",
    "the main ingredient in the proof is the requirement that there are no privileged frames : all inertial frames are equivalent .",
    "we wish now to express this hypothesis in a more transparent way that allows us to put constraints on the matrix @xmath22 .",
    "let us consider two events , @xmath23 and @xmath24 , at the same spatial location in frame @xmath1 , but separated by a time difference  @xmath25 . in @xmath2",
    "the two events are separated by a time lapse @xmath26 .",
    "one natural requirement is that if we consider two different events , @xmath27 and @xmath28 , that are at the same spatial location in frame @xmath2 , but separated by the same time difference @xmath25 in @xmath2 , then these two events are separated by a time lapse @xmath29 in @xmath1 .",
    "similarly , we require that if observer @xmath1 measures the length @xmath30 ( along the @xmath7 axis ) of a rod that is at rest with respect to @xmath2 and has length @xmath31 in the @xmath2 frame , the same result is obtained by @xmath2 for an identical rod at rest with respect to @xmath1 , always along the @xmath7 axis .",
    "these requirements constrain the coefficients of the transformation @xmath22 .",
    "let us consider the two events @xmath23 and @xmath24 at the same spatial location in frame @xmath1 , separated in time by @xmath25 . from eq .",
    "( [ direct1 ] ) , observer @xmath2 measures a time lapse @xmath26 given by @xmath32 consider now the complementary situation in which an identical clock , at rest with respect to @xmath2 , measures the same time interval @xmath25 between two events @xmath27 and @xmath28 that are at the same location in @xmath2 .",
    "correspondingly , from eq .",
    "( [ inverse1 ] ) , the observer @xmath1 measures a time lapse @xmath33 given by @xmath34 as stated above , if neither @xmath1 nor @xmath2 is in some way privileged , the two time intervals @xmath33 and @xmath26 should be identical , i.e. , @xmath35 , which implies @xmath36    a similar argument applies in the case of a rod of rest length @xmath31 , oriented along the @xmath7 axis . if the rod is at rest with respect to @xmath2 , eq .",
    "( [ direct2 ] ) implies that the length @xmath30 measured by observer @xmath1 satisfies @xmath37 analogously , for a rod at rest in @xmath1 , we have , from eq .",
    "( [ inverse2 ] ) , that the length @xmath38 measured by @xmath2 satisfies @xmath39 again , the absence of privileged reference frames requires that @xmath40 and therefore @xmath41    combining eqs .",
    "( [ tempcov ] ) and ( [ spacecov ] ) , we have @xmath42 the solution @xmath43 is not acceptable on physical grounds , because it would lead to the meaningless result @xmath44 , so we are forced to choose @xmath45 so that @xmath46 these conditions imply that the transformation relating two different inertial frames is of the form @xmath47 with @xmath48 the latter condition being a consequence of eq .",
    "( [ detone ] ) .",
    "to further constrain the structure of the matrix @xmath22 , we now add the natural requirement that the transformations connecting two inertial frames constitute a group , i.e. , that the combination of two such transformations yields a third transformation of the same form .",
    "we consider two transformations , @xmath49 and their product , @xmath50 the matrix @xmath51 is an element of the set of admissible matrices only if its diagonal elements are equal [ see eq .",
    "( [ relativity1 ] ) ] , that is , if @xmath52    in order to satisfy eq .",
    "( [ grouppro ] ) for _ all _ transformations of the form ( [ twotransformations ] ) , we have three different possibilities :    1 .",
    "[ lorentz ] @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is a nonzero constant ; 2 .",
    "[ galileo ] @xmath55 and @xmath56 , where the second equation follows from eq .",
    "( [ relativity2 ] ) ; or 3 .",
    "[ notinter ] @xmath57 and @xmath56 .    case ( iii ) is easily recognized to be physically uninteresting .    case ( ii )",
    "corresponds to the galilean transformations : @xmath58 the parameter @xmath59 being the relative velocity of the two frames in units of @xmath60 .    in case ( i )",
    "we change the definition of @xmath61 in eq .",
    "( [ vconv ] ) introducing @xmath62 with @xmath63 then we obtain @xmath64 where @xmath65 eq .",
    "( [ relativity2 ] ) becomes now @xmath66 if @xmath54 is negative , then @xmath22 is an orthogonal rotation matrix . in this case",
    ", there are transformations @xmath22 such that @xmath67 is close to the identity for some value of  @xmath68 , and this is clearly unphysical .",
    "therefore , we can exclude this possibility and we are left with transformations of the form @xmath69 where @xmath70 . in this case the observer @xmath2 moves with speed @xmath71 with respect to observer @xmath1 , where @xmath71 is determined by @xmath72 the condition @xmath73 , implies @xmath74 so that @xmath22 is a generic lorentz transformation , with the speed of light identified with @xmath75 .",
    "lorentz and galilei transformations are the only structures compatible with the principles of inertia and relativity , i.e. , the nonexistence of privileged reference frames .",
    "this result , which is easily stated , is usually obtained by means of rather complicated proofs . in this paper",
