    "the morphological types of galaxies exhibit differences depending on their large - scale structure environment . more specifically",
    ", crowded regions of the nearby universe have a high fraction of elliptical and lenticular galaxies , while the field is dominated by spirals .",
    "a clear manifestation of this is found in galaxy clusters , the densest regions of the universe , where it has been shown that the fraction of spiral galaxies decreases rapidly from the cluster outskirts towards the dense core @xcite .",
    "because spiral galaxies are generally star forming , and early - type galaxies passive , this implies a possible relationship between star formation rate ( sfr ) and density , and a number of studies have focused on this sfr  density relation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "in particular , @xcite show that the average sfr per galaxy in clusters from the cnoc1 ( canadian network for observational cosmology ) survey ( @xmath4 ) is suppressed by almost a factor of two relative to the field , even at distances @xmath5 ( where @xmath6 ) is the radius at which the density of a cluster is equal to @xmath7 times the critical density of the universe ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath9 is defined as @xmath10 . ] .",
    "recently , the study of the sfr  density relation has been extended to galaxy groups ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "there are several reasons why these intermediate environments might be of interest .",
    "for example , the majority ( 50%-70% ) of the galaxy population in the local universe is contained in group - sized haloes of @xmath11 @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "in addition , in the hierarchical paradigm of structure formation , galaxy groups are the building blocks of massive clusters .",
    "thus , cluster galaxies spend a large fraction of their life in galaxy groups before entering the cluster environment and analysing sfrs in galaxies groups can help assess when , in the hierarchy of halo assembly , the sfr  density relation is established .",
    "the most recent analyses of gradients of star formation ( sf ) activity in groups focus on nearby , low redshift systems .",
    "@xcite find no gradient in the mean star - forming galaxy fraction in a sample of x - ray detected groups at @xmath13 , observed with _ spitzer _",
    "mips 24  @xmath14 m .",
    "in addition , these groups exhibit a higher star - forming galaxy fraction than the outer region of rich clusters .",
    "exploring the same sample of @xcite , @xcite use deep ultraviolet ( uv ) observations and detect a sf gradient within @xmath15 for galaxies less massive than @xmath16 , while they do not find any environmental effect for massive galaxies .",
    "a similar conclusion is reached by @xcite for a sample of groups in the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ; @xcite ) .",
    "they find that the fraction of galaxies whose sf has been quenched increases towards the halo centre , with a strong trend for the low - mass galaxies . at somewhat higher redshift , @xmath17 , @xcite observe an excess of 24  @xmath14 m star - forming galaxies with respect to the field in several groups connected to each other and forming a likely `` super - group '' , or a cluster in formation .",
    "it still remains to be established whether this excess is unique to this particular structure or whether it is characteristic of the group environment more generally .",
    "at much higher redshift ( @xmath18 ) , @xcite reveal a very high level of sf activity in one group observed with _ spitzer _",
    "mips 24 @xmath14 m .",
    "they find a @xmath19 anti - correlation between the level of sf activity and the group - centric distance .",
    "they refer to this as a reversal of the relation observed in local clusters .",
    "the reason for the reversal is hypothesized to be that , at high redshift , groups show the bulk of the sf in the central massive galaxies that will eventually evolve into early - type galaxies with low sfr by @xmath20 , while the group itself will evolve into a massive local cluster .    to shed further light on this topic",
    "we have assembled a homogeneously x - ray selected sample of groups at @xmath21 .",
    "we have also considered a `` super - group '' spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath22 by @xcite and dynamically studied by @xcite .",
    "our aim is to understand if the sf gradient observed in the local clusters is in place also in the group regime and at which epoch the gradient is established . for this purpose",
    "we use the latest and deepest available _ herschel _ pacs ( photoconducting array camera and spectrometer ; @xcite ) far - infrared surveys , from the pacs evolutionary probe ( pep ; @xcite ) and the great observatories origin deep survey ( goods)-herschel survey ( goods - h ; @xcite ) . these surveys provide far - infrared observation of the major blank fields , such as the extended chandra deep field south ( ecdfs ) , the goods and the cosmos ( cosmological evolution survey ) fields .",
    "the use of far - infrared pacs data allows us to overcome the so - called mid - infrared excess problem ( due to the uncertain extrapolation of the mips 24  @xmath14 m flux to extrapolate the bolometric infrared luminosity , @xmath23 ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ) , and any contamination by active galactic nuclei ( agn ) to the optical and mid - infrared emission of the host galaxies @xcite .",
    "this paper is structured as follows : in section  [ dataset ] we describe our data set ; section  [ calibration ] describes the computation of group membership , velocity dispersion , stellar masses and sfrs ; in section  [ sec : completeness_mock_cat ] we discuss our approach towards spectroscopic incompleteness ; section  [ results ] shows our main results on the sf gradients in galaxy groups , which are then discussed in section  [ discussion ] .",

    "the aim of this work is to study the evolution of the sf activity in galaxy groups .",
    "we have used x - ray emission to build the group sample .",
    "extended x - ray emitting sources pinpoint groups via the bremsstrahlung radiation of the intra - group medium ( igm ) .",
    "this selects virialized objects ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and avoids projection effects which can be problematic with optical selection techniques . optically selected systems which are not x - ray bright tend to be less evolved ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and might have more ongoing accretion of galaxies which are not - yet accreted on to the group itself , or even galaxies projected along filaments in the line of sight which are not bound to the group .",
    "x - ray selection ensures that a relatively relaxed halo of reasonable mass exists .",
    "once the groups are identified by their x - ray emission , deep multi - wavelength data are required to identify the group members and to determine their properties . specifically , we require extensive optical photometric and spectroscopic catalogues to identify galaxies and establish their group membership , and herschel data to determine their sfrs .",

    "we also show how the sfrs and stellar masses are estimated for each group galaxy member .",
    "our final aim is to perform the analysis of the evolution of the sf activity in the group environment .",
    "the galaxy membership is based on the _ clean _ algorithm of @xcite which is based on modelling of the mass and anisotropy profiles of cluster - sized haloes extracted from a cosmological numerical simulation . after selecting the main group peak in redshift space by the method of weighted gaps , the algorithm estimates the group velocity dispersion using the galaxies in the selected peak .",
    "this is then used to evaluate the virial velocity based on assumed models for the mass and velocity anisotropy profiles .",
    "these models with the estimated virial velocity are then used to predict the line - of - sight velocity dispersion of the system as a function of system - centric radius , @xmath97(r ) . any galaxy having a rest - frame velocity within @xmath98(r ) at its system - centric radial distance r is selected as group member .",
    "we use the x - ray surface - brightness peaks as centres of the x - ray detected systems .",

    "the dynamical and x - ray mass estimates are in good agreement in the cosmos field .",
    "we note much less agreement for the newly defined ( e)cdfs group sample , where the dynamical masses are on average higher than the x - ray masses .",
    "this could be due to the fact that ecdfs groups are on average much more distant than cosmos groups , and this is only partially explained by the deeper x - ray exposure in the ecdfs field with respect to the cosmos field . in the following we use the x - ray masses for all systems for which they are available , since unlike dynamical masses they do not suffer from projection effects , which may be considerable when the number of spectroscopic members is low , as in our sample .",
    "we compute the ir luminosities ( @xmath23 ) by fitting the photometry with the recent sed templates presented by @xcite and integrating them over the range 8 - 1000@xmath14 m .",
    "the pacs ( 100 and 160@xmath14 m ) fluxes , when available , together with the 24  fluxes are used to find the best - fitting templates among the main sequence ( ms ) and starburst ( sb ; @xcite ) templates .",
    "when only the 24  flux is available for undetected pacs sources , we rely only on this single point and we use the ms template for extrapolating the @xmath23 .",
    "indeed , the ms template turns out to be the best - fitting template in the majority of the cases ( 80% ) with both pacs and 24  detection .    in principle",
    ", the use of the ms template could cause only an underestimate of the extrapolated @xmath23 from 24  fluxes , in particular at high redshift or for off - sequence sources ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "this is due to the relatively higher pahs emission of the ms template ( see @xcite for more details ) .",
    "however , the @xmath23 estimated with the best - fitting templates based on pacs and 24  data agrees very well with the @xmath23 extrapolated from the 24  flux ( @xmath100 ) using the ms template .",

    "the estimates are broadly consistent , although the scatter is quite large : 0.73  dex for the whole range of redshifts , 0.74  dex for @xmath113 , 0.63  dex for @xmath114 and 0.68  dex for @xmath115 for the @xmath116 relation .",
    "the situation improves when only the spectroscopic sample is considered , probably because galaxies with a spectroscopic identification are on average brighter and bluer than the overall sample .",
    "for the spectroscopic sample the scatter ( see right - hand panel of fig .  [ calib_sfr ] ) is 0.61  dex for the whole range of redshifts , 0.58  dex for @xmath113 , 0.57  dex for @xmath114 and 0.67  dex for @xmath115 .",
    "we conclude that our estimates of the stellar mass are accurate within a factor of 2 , while the sfr are more difficult to constrain via sed fitting .",
    "indeed , previous studies @xcite already demonstrate that , while stellar masses are well determined , the sed fitting procedure does not strongly constrain sfr and histories at high redshifts , where the uncertainties become larger due to the sfr  age ",
    "metallicity degeneracies . in any event",

    "we bin the sample of groups by redshift to distinguish between the high - redshift groups that happen to be mainly in the goods - s area with a somewhat higher spectroscopic completeness than the full ecdfs area , and the three low - redshift groups that reside at the edge of the ecdfs area with lower spectroscopic completeness .",
    "the spectroscopic completeness of the cosmos field is much lower with respect to the other fields both in the full area and in the group area .",

    "the backward light - cone is defined as the set of all light - like worldlines intersecting the position of the observer at redshift zero .",
    "we use the mock catalogues from 2 out of 6 such light cones to take into account field to field variation .",
    "we select as information from each catalogue the johnson photometric band magnitudes available ( @xmath123 , @xmath124 and @xmath125 ) , the redshift , the stellar mass and the sfr of each galaxy with a cut at @xmath126 to limit the data volume to the galaxy population of interest . in order to simulate the spectroscopic completeness observed in the region of our groups , we randomly extract for each mock catalogue a sub - sample of galaxies by following the spectroscopic completeness of reference .",
    "namely , we choose one of the available photometric bands and extract randomly in each magnitude bin a percentage of galaxies consistent with the percentage of systems with spectroscopic redshift in the same magnitude bin of our galaxy sample in the group region .",
    "we follow this procedure to extract randomly 50 different catalogues from each light - cone .",
    "we end up with 100 different ( randomly extracted ) catalogues that appropriately reproduce the same characteristics of the selection function of our sample .    to check this",
    "we apply the following approach : taking advantage of the very high accuracy of the photometric redshifts of @xcite in the ecdfs , we estimate a spectroscopic completeness in physical properties such as stellar mass and sfr of our galaxy sample ( in the group region ) .",
    "we assume the photometric redshifts , and the physical properties based on those , to be correct .",
    "then , we divide our sample into four redshift bins following the separation done for the groups and the analysis presented in the next section .",
    "we then estimate the spectroscopic completeness as a function of stellar mass and sfr in each bin .",
    "the spectroscopic completeness is estimated as the ratio of the number of the galaxies with spectroscopic redshift to the number of all those with @xmath127 in the considered redshift bin and per bin of stellar mass or sfr .",
    "this procedure allows us to determine how the spectroscopic selection , based on the photometric information ( e.g. colour , magnitude cuts , etc . ) , affects the choice of galaxies as spectroscopic targets according to their physical properties . in order to check for possible biases ,",
    "we follow the same approach for the randomly - extracted mock catalogues .",
    "we apply the same redshift bin separation applied to the real catalogue .",

    "we show the mean completeness averaged over the 100 randomly - extracted catalogues created following the spectroscopic completeness of the ecdfs in johnson @xmath36 band . in all panels",
    "the mock catalogues tend to reproduce , to a level that we consider sufficient for our needs , the selection of massive and highly star - forming galaxies observed in the real ecdfs sample .",
    "we note a significant difference only in the region of very low sfr where the completeness is much higher in the ecdfs sample than in the mock catalogues at high redshift .",
    "this is due to the fact that massive early - type galaxies have been targeted in dedicated observations ( see @xcite for more details ) , especially in the goods - s field region and at @xmath128 .",
    "we point out that , while the galaxy mock catalogues of the millennium simulation provide a suitable representation of the relatively nearby galaxies , at higher redshift ( @xmath129 ) they fail in reproducing the correct distribution of star - forming galaxies in the sfr - stellar mass plane , as already shown by @xcite .",
    "this is related to the difficulty that the semi - analytical models have in predicting the observed evolution of the galaxy stellar mass function and the cosmic sf history of our universe @xcite .",
    "indeed @xcite estimate that at @xmath130 the galaxy sfr is underestimated , on average , by a factor of two , at fixed stellar mass , with respect to the observed values . by performing the same exercise with our data set , we find that this underestimation ranges between factors of 2.5 - 3 at @xmath131 .    however , we stress here that this does not represent a problem for our approach . indeed , the aim of using the millennium galaxy mock catalogues is to understand what is the bias introduced by a selection function similar `` in relative terms '' to the spectroscopic selection function caracterizing our data set . in other words , for our needs it is sufficient that the randomly - extracted mock catalogues reproduce the same bias in selecting , on average , the same percentage of most star - forming and most massive galaxies of the parent sample .",
    "the bias of our analysis will be estimated by comparing the results obtained in the biased randomly - extracted mock catalogues and the unbiased parent catalogue .",
    "since the underestimation of the sfr or the stellar mass of high - redshift galaxies is common to both biased and unbiased samples , it does not affect the result of this comparative analysis .",
    "we also stress that the aim of this analysis is not to provide correction factors for our observational results but a way to interpret our results in terms of possible biases introduced by the spectroscopic selection function .",

[ z_histo ] ) .",

    "we point out that the analysis of the bias introduced by the spectroscopic selection function conducted with the mock catalogues of the millennium simulation ( see section [ sec : completeness_mock_cat ] ) , shows that a strong degree of mass segregation in the very centre of groups would be hard to observe since massive galaxies with low level of sf activity could be missed by the selection function , which favours massive star - forming galaxies .",
    "thus , given this uncertainty , we can not exclude that the lack of any level of mass segregation in the analysed groups is caused by a bias introduced by our spectroscopic selection function",
    ".    there could be several different reasons for the lack of strong mass segregation in our group sample .",
    "for example , the small mass range considered in our analysis ( @xmath157 ) can prevent us from observing a strong underlying mass segregation .",
    "to check this possibility , we analyse the stellar mass  group - centric distance relation in the lowest redshift bin with a much lower mass cut of @xmath158 .",

    "a classical example is represented by the coma cluster @xcite with no significant sign of mass segregation within its virial radius ( see also @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the presence of strong mass segregation is expected to be found in massive clusters as the result of violent relaxation or dynamical friction .",
    "these processes together with progressive accretion , would create in the cluster environment an evolutionary sequence of sf and mass segregation @xcite , visible as gradients of mass and sfr .",
    "the lack of these gradients in the group environment could indicate that the relaxation or dynamical friction time - scales of group galaxies are longer than the group crossing time and that the spread in accretion times in groups is much smaller than that observed in clusters @xcite .",

    "the weak dependence of @xmath151 on group global properties , such as the group - centric distance , might be an indication that the sf properties of group galaxies are more affected by their immediate environment , e.g. , close neighbours or the presence of substructures @xcite , than the global environment .",
    "however , we have checked that this is not the case .",

    "moreover , as the galaxies enter the cluster potential , reservoirs of fresh fuel for sf are lost .",
    "thus , the origin of radial gradients in these properties is the natural consequence of the strong correlation between radius and accretion time , resulting from the hierarchical assembly of the cluster .    according to this model",
    ", the absence of an anti - correlation between mean galaxy sfr and the group - centric distance could reflect the much smaller spread in accretion times of low - mass objects such as the groups considered in our analysis .",
    "this is consistent also with the prediction of the millennium simulation . as described in section  [ sec : sfr_group - centric_dist ] , we use the mock catalogues of @xcite to build a sample of groups , identified via a friend of friend algorithm @xcite , in the same mass range of the observed sample in the different redshift bin .",
    "the analysis of the dependence of the sf activity of group galaxies as a function of the group - centric distance shows also that the millennium simulation does not predict any gradient in sfr or specific sfr , after we apply a mass cut of @xmath163 ( fig .",

    "a mild mass segregation is observed only at the very centre ( fig .",

    "the same result is achieved if we apply a mass cut of @xmath161 , as shown by the blue dashed line in fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_r_plots ] . the divergence might be due to the different range in the group - centric distance considered in the two works .",

    "on the other hand , our analysis focuses on the study of galaxy properties within @xmath168 , thus investigating a region more directly affected by the gravitational potential of the group .",

    "conversely , they find a radial dependence in the changing mix of red and blue galaxies for less massive galaxies ( @xmath174 ) , with red galaxies being found preferentially in the group centre .",
    "they note that this trend is stronger for poorer groups , while it disappears for richer groups .",

    "it must be noted , however , that @xcite use luminosity segregation to infer mass segregation .",
    "the absence of mass gradient is assessed also by @xcite who study a sample of optically selected groups in the sdss .",

    "indeed , not all galaxy clusters show a significant sign of mass segregation within the virial radius ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xcite compare the galaxy distribution observed in the coma cluster with the one obtained from n  body simulations .",
    "the main argument of @xcite to explain the disagreement between their model and the observation is that most of the cluster mass could not be bound to the galaxies ( this is known as `` the missing mass '' problem ) , since in their model the most massive galaxies end up always in the centre of the cluster ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "another plausible explanation can be related to the dynamical state of the cluster .",
    "the perturbations due to accretion or merging can delay the relaxation times , since more galaxy encounters are expected .    in general , the presence of strong mass segregation in bound structures is the result of violent relaxation or dynamical friction @xcite . in the first case , mass segregation occurs with an exchange of kinetic energy among group galaxies with the lighter galaxies having larger velocity than the heavier galaxies .",
    "after the energy is exchanged , most massive galaxies settle in the core of the cluster , while the lighter galaxies preferentially reside in the outer regions .",
    "dynamical friction , instead , represents a kind of frictional drag which causes the galaxy motions to slow down .",
    "if a galaxy is in an orbit that makes repeated passages through the cluster or group halo , its orbit will decay over time and it will spiral in and be accreted by the larger object , thus causing that larger object to grow in mass . since the time - scale of dynamical friction varies as @xmath179 ( where @xmath82 is the velocity dispersion and @xmath180 the density of the halo ) , high velocity dispersion clusters do not suffer much internal dynamical evolution of their galaxy populations after their primary formation phase .",
    "conversely , relatively low velocity dispersion groups could produce interactions and mergers on a cosmologically short time - scale , even at low redshifts .",
    "thus , if a correlation between the group - centric distance and time since the galaxy infall is expected @xcite , mass segregation and radial gradients should translate into an evolutionary sequence of sf . however , our results do not support this picture .",
    "instead , they suggest that the relaxation or the dynamical friction time - scales are too long to lead to a significant mass segregation at any of the redshifts considered .      throughout our analysis",
    "we have studied the dependence of galaxy properties on the group - centric distance for a sample of x - ray selected groups .",
    "we consider also a `` super - group '' or large - scale structure spectroscopically confirmed at @xmath22 by @xcite and dynamically studied by @xcite .",
    "this structure allows us to compare at higher refdhift our results on our group sample at @xmath181 .",
    "the analysis of the cdfs 4 ms map at the position of the @xmath22 structure leads to identification of a few extended x - ray emitting sources possibly associated with this super - group ( finoguenov et al . in preparation ) .",
    "one of these extended sources is studied by @xcite who report on a relaxed , x - ray bright group , part of the @xcite structure . in this work",
    "we study the super group as a large - scale structure rather than single x - ray emitting sources , since the few member identifications to the x - ray emitting sources do not offer good enough statistics to analyse them alone . the galaxy membership and main structure parameters ( @xmath136 , velocity disperion , @xmath182 ) are derived via dynamical analysis by @xcite .",
    "we must note that this structure could be in the process of formation and , thus , in a particular environmental condition .",
    "however , the inclusion of this `` super - group '' does not appear to have a strong influence on our results , as it naturally follows the trends found at @xmath150 .",
    "for instance , fig .",
    "[ fig : sfr_r_plots ] shows the mean sfr as a function of system - centric distance .",
    "the red curve shows no significant variation between the two radial bins , which represent the mean sfr among 6 and 5 galaxies , respectively .",
    "this is confirmed by the spearman test performed on the 11 galaxies .",
    "@xcite analyse the dependence of the sf activity as a function of the density in a group at @xmath76 .",
    "their @xmath183 mips data reveals a very high level of sf activity which increases with density . according to their estimate , the highest level of sf happens in the system core",
    "this is apparently in contrast with our results , according to which there is no dependence of sfr on group - centric distance .",
    "however , @xcite detect a correlation with a significance of only @xmath184 .",
    "furthermore , they consider strong ir emitting galaxies whose luminosities could be overestimated due to extrapolation of the flux at 24  @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , we have used @xmath2 pacs data for an accurate estimate of sfr .",
    "this allows us to avoid contamination by dust obscuration , or by the presence of an agn .",
    "[ fig : mass_r_plots ] shows the mean stellar mass as a function of system - centric distance .",
    "no significant difference in mean mass can be detected between the two radial bins for the structure at @xmath22 .",
    "the spearman test confirms the absence of mass segregation in this super - group .    as for the groups considered in our sample ,",
    "the absence of a sf gradient and of mass segregation is reflected in the ssfr  system - centric distance relation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : ssfr_r_plots ] ) .",
    "our results are qualitatively consistent with the predictions of the millennium simulation ( fig .",
    "indeed , we do not find any gradient of sfr or mass segregation in the simulated groups .",
    "in the hierarchical scenario of structure formation , galaxy groups are the `` building blocks '' of galaxy clusters .",
    "they are also the most common environment of galaxies in the present day universe , hosting up to 70% of the galaxy population @xcite . given that most galaxies will experience the group environment during their lifetime , an understanding of groups is critical to follow galaxy evolution in general .    in order to follow the evolution of the relation between sf activity and the group environment ,",
    "we have studied a sample of galaxies in x - ray selected groups in four redshift bins , @xmath132 , @xmath133 , @xmath134 , @xmath135 . to increase the statistics ,",
    "we have created a composite group in each redshift bin .",
    "we note that the last redshift bin is populated by just one structure at @xmath22 @xcite , which is likely a super - group or a cluster in formation . with the aim of limiting the selection effects and of taking into account the different level of spectroscopic completeness as a function of each physical property in the different redshift bins ,",
    "we have applied a stellar mass cut for all galaxies of @xmath185 @xmath12 .",
    "the uncertainties on the mean galaxy properties are evaluated with dedicated monte carlo simulations based on the mock catalogue of @xcite drawn from the millennium simulation @xcite .",
    "we have analysed the dependence of sf activity on the group - centric distance of the composite groups in each redshift bin .",
    "the radial distance from the halo centre is a proxy for the depth of the potential well .",
    "we have used our data set to shed light on the relations of the mean mass , sfr and ssfr with the group - centric distance and to follow for the first time their evolution up to @xmath22 .",
    "we find mild mass segregation up to @xmath186 and no correlation at higher redshift ( fig .",
    "[ fig : mass_r_plots ] , @xmath187 up to @xmath186 ) .",
    "the mean sfr of galaxies also appears not to be strongly dependent on the distance from the centre ( figs .",
    "[ fig : sfr_r_plots ] and [ fig : ssfr_r_plots ] ) , in contrast to the case for clusters .",
    "our findings are in agreement with the predictions of the millennium simulation mock catalogues of @xcite , as we show in fig .",
    "the absence of any measurable segregation of sf activity within the group environment could reflect the much smaller spread in accretion times of groups with respect to clusters .",
    "this result is not affected by the mild mass segregation that we observe up to @xmath186 , which indicates that the relaxation or the dynamical friction time - scales of group galaxies is longer than the group crossing time .",
    "thus , the time necessary for heavy galaxies to sink to the centre of the potential well is too long compared to the lifetime of the group itself .",
