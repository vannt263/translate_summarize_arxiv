    "in this paper we develop a general multi - mode gaussian representation for a density matrix of bosons . as well as classical phase - space variables like @xmath0 , the representation utilizes a dynamical space of quantum uncertainties or co - variances .",
    "the extended phase space accommodates more efficiently the content of a quantum state , and allows the physics of many kinds of problems to be incorporated into the basis itself .",
    "the gaussian expansion technique unifies and greatly extends all the previous gaussian - like phase - space representations used for bosons , including the wigner , @xmath1 , @xmath2 , positive-@xmath3 and squeezed - state expansions .",
    "the operator basis also includes non - hermitian gaussian operators , which are not density matrices themselves , but can form part of a probabilistic expansion of a physical density matrix . unlike previous approaches , _",
    "any _ initial state is found to evolve with a deterministic time - evolution under _ any _ quadratic hamiltonian or master equation .",
    "the complexity of many - body quantum physics is manifest in the enormity of the hilbert space of systems with even modest numbers of particles .",
    "this complexity makes it prohibitively difficult to simulate quantum dynamics with exact precision : no digital computer is large enough to store the dynamically evolving state .",
    "however , if a finite precision is permitted , then quantum dynamical calculations are possible , through what are known as phase - space methods .",
    "these methods represent the evolving quantum state as probability distributions on some suitable phase space , which can be sampled via stochastic techniques .",
    "the mapping to phase space can be made to be exact .",
    "thus the precision of the final result is limited only by sampling error , which can usually be reliably estimated and which can be reduced by an increased number of stochastic paths .",
    "arbitrary quantum mechanical evolution can not be represented ( even probabilistically ) on a phase space as is usually defined .",
    "thus the extended phase spaces employed here are a generalization of conventional phase spaces in several ways .",
    "first , it is a _",
    "quantum _ phase space , in which points can correspond to states with intrinsic uncertainty .",
    "heisenberg s uncertainty relations can thus be satisfied in this way , or more generally by considering genuine probability distributions over phase space , to be sampled stochastically .",
    "second , the phase space is of _ double dimension _",
    ", where classically real variables , such as @xmath4 and @xmath5 , now range over the complex plane .",
    "this allows arbitrary quantum _ evolution _ to be sampled stochastically .",
    "third , stochastic _ gauge _ variables are included .",
    "these arbitrary quantities do not affect the physical results , but they can be used to overcome problems in the stochastic sampling .",
    "fourth , the phase space includes the set of second - order moments , or _",
    "covariances_. a phase space that is enlarged in this way is able to accommodate more information about a general quantum state in a single point . in particular , any state ( pure or mixed ) with gaussian statistics",
    "can be represented as a single point in this phase space .",
    "the gaussian representation provides a link between phase - space methods and approximate methods used in many - body theory , which frequently treat normal and anomalous correlations or green s functions as dynamical objects@xcite .",
    "as well as being applicable to quantum optics and quantum information , a strong motivation for this representation is the striking experimental observation of bec in ultra - cold atomic systems@xcite . already the term ` atom laser ' is widely used , and experimental observation of quantum statistics in these systems is underway .",
    "yet there is a problem in using previous quantum optics formalisms to calculate coherence properties in atom optics : interactions are generally much stronger with atoms than they are with photons , relative to the damping rate .",
    "the consequence of this is that one must anticipate larger departures from semiclassical , coherent - state behaviour in atomic systems .",
    "the present paper includes these nonclassical and incoherent effects at the level of the basis for the operator representation itself .",
    "the purpose of employing a gaussian basis set is not only to enlarge the parameter set ( to hold more information about the quantum state ) , but also to include in the basis states that are a close match to the actual states that are likely to occur in interesting systems , such as dilute gases .",
    "the pay - off for increasing the parameter set is more efficient sampling of the dynamically evolving or equilibrium states of many - body systems .",
    "the idea of coherent states as a quasi - classical basis for quantum mechanics originated with schrdinger@xcite .",
    "subsequently , wigner @xcite introduced a distribution for quantum density matrices .",
    "this method was a phase - space mapping with classical dimensions and employed a symmetrically ordered operator correspondence principle .",
    "later developments included the antinormally ordered @xmath1 distribution@xcite , a normally ordered expansion called the diagonal @xmath2 distribution@xcite , methods that interpolate between these classical phase - space distributions@xcite , and diagonal squeezed - state representations@xcite .",
    "each of these expansions either employs an explicit gaussian density matrix basis or is related to one that does by convolution .",
    "they are suitable for phase - space representations of quantum states because of the overcompleteness of the set of coherent states on which they are based .",
    "arbitrary pure states of bosons with a gaussian wave - function or wigner representation are often called the squeezed states@xcite .",
    "these are a superset of the coherent states , and were investigated by bogoliubov@xcite to approximately represent the ground state of an interacting bose - einstein condensate - as well as in much recent work in quantum optics@xcite .",
    "diagonal expansions analogous to the diagonal @xmath2-representation have been introduced using a basis of squeezed - state projectors , typically with a fixed squeezing parameter@xcite .",
    "however , these have not generally resulted in useful dynamical applications , as they do not overcome the problems inherent in using a diagonal basis , as we discuss below .    in operator representations , one must utilize a complete basis in the hilbert space of density operators , rather than in the hilbert space of pure states .",
    "thermal density matrices , for example , are not pure states , but do have a gaussian @xmath2 representation and wigner function . to include all three types of commonly used gaussian states - the coherent , squeezed and thermal states - one can define a gaussian _ state _ as a density matrix having a gaussian positive-@xmath2 or wigner representation@xcite .",
    "this definition also includes displaced and squeezed thermal states .",
    "gaussian states have been investigated extensively in quantum information and quantum entanglement@xcite .",
    "it has been shown that an initial gaussian state will remain gaussian under linear evolution@xcite .",
    "however , the gaussian density matrices that correspond to physical states do _ not _ by themselves form a complete basis for the time - evolution of all quantum density matrices .",
    "this problem , inherent in all diagonal expansions , is related to known issues in constructing quantum ",
    "classical correspondences@xcite , and is caused by the non - positive - definite nature of the local propagator in a classical phase space .",
    "it is manifest in the fact that there is generally no equivalent fokker - planck equation ( with a positive - definite diffusion matrix ) that generates the quantum time - evolution , and hence no corresponding stochastic differential equation that can be efficiently simulated numerically .",
    "this difficulty occurs in nearly all cases except free fields , and represents a substantial limitation in the use of these diagonal expansion methods for exact simulation of the quantum dynamics of interacting systems .",
    "these problems can be solved by use of nonclassical phase spaces , which correspond to expansions in non - hermitian bases of operators _ _ ( rather than just physical density matrices ) .",
    "one established example is the non - diagonal positive-@xmath2@xcite representation .",
    "the non - hermitian basis in this case generates a representation with a positive propagator , which allows the use of stochastic methods to sample the quantum dynamics . by extending the expansion to include a stochastic gauge freedom in these evolution equations , one can select the most compact possible time - evolution equation@xcite . with an appropriate gauge choice , this method is exact for a large class of nonlinear hamiltonians , since it eliminates boundary terms that can otherwise arise@xcite .",
    "the general gaussian representation used here also includes these features , and extends them to allow treatment of any hamiltonian or master equation with up to fourth - order polynomial terms .",
    "other methods of theoretical physics that have comparable goals are the path - integral techniques of quantum field theory@xcite , and density functional methods@xcite that are widely used to treat atomic and molecular systems .",
    "the first of these is exact in principle , but is almost exclusively used in imaginary time calculations of canonical ensembles or ground states due to the notorious phase problem .",
    "the second method has similarities with our approach in that it also utilizes a density as we do .",
    "however , density functionals are normally combined with approximations like the local density approximation .",
    "gaussian representation methods have the advantage that they can treat both real and imaginary time evolution . in addition , the technique is exact in principle , provided boundary terms vanish on partial integration .    in section",
    "[ sec : gaussian  expansions ] , we define general gaussian operators for a density operator expansion and introduce a compact notation for these operators , either in terms of mode operators or quantum fields . in section [ sec : gaussian - expectation - values ] , we calculate the moments of the general gaussian representation , relating them to physical quantities as well as to the moments of previous representations . section [ sec : gaussian - differential - identities ] gives the necessary identities that enable first - principles quantum calculations with these representations .",
    "equation ( [ eq : matrixidentities ] ) summarizes the relevant operator mappings , and constitutes a key result of the paper .",
    "we give a number of examples in section [ sec : examples ] of specific pure and mixed states ( and their non - hermitian generalizations ) that are included in the basis , and we give simplified versions of important identities for these cases .",
    "section [ sec : time - evolution ] describes how the gaussian representation can be used to deal with evolution in either real or imaginary time .",
    "in particular , we show how it can be used to solve exactly any master equation that is quadratic in annihilation and creation operators . some useful normalization integrals and reordering",
    "identities for the gaussian operators are proved in the appendices .    in a subsequent paper",
    ", we will apply these methods to systems with nonlinear evolution .",
    "the representations that give exact mappings between operator equations and stochastic equations  an essential step toward representing operator dynamics in large hilbert spaces  are stochastic gauge expansions@xcite on a nonclassical phase space . here , the generic expansion is written down in terms of a complete set of operators that are typically non - hermitian .",
    "this leads to the typical form :    @xmath6    where @xmath7 is a probability distribution , @xmath8 is a suitable basis for the class of density matrices being considered , and @xmath9 is the integration measure for the corresponding generalized phase - space coordinate @xmath10 .",
    "see fig .",
    "[ figure1 ] for a conceptual illustration of this expansion .    in phase - space methods ,",
    "it is the distribution @xmath2 that is sampled stochastically .",
    "therefore if the basis resembles the typical physical states of a system , the sampling error will be minimized , and if the state coincides exactly with an element of the basis , then the distribution will be a delta function , with consequently no sampling error .",
    "a wigner or @xmath1-function basis , for example , generates a broad distribution even for minimum uncertainty states . a general gaussian basis ,",
    "on the other hand , can generate a delta - function distribution not only for any minimum uncertainty state , but also for the ground states of non - interacting finite - temperature systems .      in this paper",
    ", we define the operator basis @xmath8 to be the most general gaussian operator basis .",
    "the motivation for using the most general possible basis set is that when the basis set members nearly match the states of interest , the resulting distributions are more compact and have lower sampling errors in a monte - carlo or stochastic calculation .",
    "in addition , a larger basis allows more choice of mappings , so that lower - order differential correspondences can be utilized . in some cases , a large basis",
    "set can increase computational memory requirements , as more parameters are needed .",
    "this disadvantage is outweighed when there is a substantial decrease in sampling error , due to the use of a more physically appropriate basis . by choosing a general gaussian operator basis , rather than just a basis of gaussian density matrices ,",
    "one has the additional advantage of a complete representation for all non - gaussian density matrices as well .",
    "if @xmath11 is a column vector of @xmath12 bosonic annihilation operators , and @xmath13 the corresponding row vector of creation operators , their commutation relations are:@xmath14=\\delta_{kj}\\,\\,.\\label{eq : a - com}\\ ] ] we define a gaussian operator as an exponential of an arbitrary quadratic form in annihilation and creation operators ( or , equivalently , a quadratic form in position and momentum operators ) .    the simplest way to achieve",
    "this is to introduce extended @xmath15-vectors of c - numbers and operators : @xmath16 , and @xmath17 , with adjoints defined as @xmath18 and @xmath19 , together with a relative operator displacement of @xmath20 these extended vectors are indexed where necessary with greek indices : @xmath21 .",
    "a general gaussian operator is now an exponential of a general quadratic form in the @xmath15-vector mode operator @xmath22 . for algebraic reasons ,",
    "it is useful to employ normal ordering , and to introduce a compact notation using a generalized covariance @xmath23 :       here the normalization factor involving @xmath24 is introduced to simplify identities that occur later , and plays a very similar role to the exactly analogous normalization factor that occurs in the classical gaussian distribution of probability theory .",
    "the @xmath25 covariance matrix is conveniently parameterized in terms of @xmath26 submatrices as : @xmath27\\,\\,,\\label{covariance}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is a complex @xmath26 matrix and @xmath29 are two independent symmetric complex @xmath26 matrices .    with this choice",
    ", the covariance has a type of generalized hermitian symmetry in which @xmath30 , provided we interpret the matrix indices as cyclic in the sense that @xmath31 .",
    "this can also be written as @xmath32with the definition that :    @xmath33^{+}\\equiv\\left[\\begin{array}{cc } \\mathbf{d } & \\mathbf{c}\\\\ \\mathbf{b } & \\mathbf{a}\\end{array}\\right]^{t}\\,\\,.\\label{eq : sym}\\ ] ]    this definition implies that we intend the ` @xmath34 ' superscript to define an operation on the covariance matrix which is equivalent to hermitian conjugation of the underlying operators .",
    "if the gaussian operator is in fact an hermitian operator , then so is the corresponding covariance matrix . in this case , the ` @xmath34 ' superscript is identical to ordinary hermitian conjugation .",
    "the generalized hermitian symmetry of the covariance means that all elements of the number correlation @xmath28 appear twice , as do all except the diagonal elements of the squeezing correlations @xmath29 .",
    "the use of normal ordering allows simple operator identities to be obtained , but can easily be related to more commonly used unordered parameterizations .",
    "the gaussian operators include as special cases the density matrices of many useful and well - known physical states .",
    "for example , they include the thermal states of a bose - einstein distribution , the coherent states , and the squeezed states .",
    "they also include many more states than these , like the off - diagonal coherent state projectors used in the positive-@xmath2 expansion , which are not density operators themselves , but can be used to expand density operators .",
    "the details are given in section [ sec : examples ] .",
    "the representation phase space is thus extended to @xmath35 the complex amplitude @xmath36 , which appears in the normalisation , acts as a dynamical weight on different stochastic trajectories .",
    "it is useful in calculations in which the normalisation of the density matrix is not intrinsically preserved , such as canonical ensemble calculations , and also enables stochastic gauges to be included .",
    "the complex vectors @xmath37 and @xmath38 give the generalized coherent amplitudes for each mode : @xmath37 defines the amplitudes of annihilation operators @xmath11 , while its ` conjugate ' @xmath38 defines the amplitudes of the creation operators @xmath13 .",
    "the matrix @xmath28 gives the number , or normal , correlations between each pair of modes .",
    "the squeezing , or anomalous , correlations between each pair of modes are given by @xmath39 and @xmath40 : the matrix @xmath39 defines the correlations of annihilation operators , while its ` conjugate ' @xmath40 defines the correlations of the creation operators .",
    "these physical interpretations of the phase - space variables are supported by the results of section [ sec : gaussian - expectation - values ] , where we rigorously establish the connection of the phase - space variables to physical quantities .    in general ,",
    "apart from the complex amplitude @xmath36 , the total number of complex parameters needed to specify the normalized @xmath12-mode gaussian operator is :    @xmath41    hence the phase - space variables can be written as @xmath42 , with the corresponding integration measure as @xmath43 .",
    "the above results define a completely general gaussian operator in terms of arbitrary bosonic annihilation and creation operators , without reference to the field involved .",
    "it is sometimes useful to compare this to a field theoretic notation , in which we explicitly use a coordinate - space integral to define the correlations .",
    "this provides a means to extend operator representation theory for fields@xcite to more general basis sets . in a quantization volume @xmath44",

    "in order to use the gaussian operator basis , a number of basic identities are needed . in this section",
    ", we derive relations between operator expectation values and moments of the distribution .",
    "such moments also show how the general gaussian representation incorporates the previously used methods .",
    "the trace of a generalized gaussian is needed to normalize the density matrix .",
    "the trace is most readily calculated by using a well - known coherent - state identity@xcite ,    @xmath57=\\int\\left\\langle \\mathbf{z}\\right|\\widehat{\\lambda}\\left|\\mathbf{z}\\right\\rangle \\frac{d^{2m}\\mathbf{z}}{\\pi^{m}}\\,.\\label{eq : coherent - trace}\\ ] ]    here we define @xmath58 .",

    "for example , in the single - mode case , one obtains for the normalizing determinant that :    @xmath63    we can thus calculate the value of the normalization from standard gaussian integrals , as detailed in appendix [ sec : gaussian - integrals ] , provided @xmath23 has eigenvalues with a positive real part .",

    ", there may be terms which do not have this normalisation ; with the proviso the average weight still be @xmath66 .",
    "this freedom of having different weights on different members of the ensemble provides a way of introducing gauge variables , which can be used to improve the efficiency of the stochastic sampling but which do not affect of the average result .",
    "the weight also allows calculations to be performed in which the trace of the density matrix is not preserved , as in canonical - ensemble calculations .",
    "given a density matrix expanded in gaussian operators , it is essential to be able to calculate operator expectation values .",
    "this can be achieved most readily if the operator @xmath67 is written in antinormally ordered form , as:@xmath68    since the density matrix expansion is normally ordered by definition , the cyclic properties of a trace allows the expectation value of any antinormally ordered operator to be re - arranged as a completely normally ordered form .",
    "hence , following a similar coherent - state expansion procedure to that the previous subsection , we arrive at an expression analogous to the kernel trace , eq ( [ trace ] ) :    @xmath69}{{\\rm tr}\\left[\\widehat{\\rho}\\right]}\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\frac{\\int p(\\overrightarrow{\\lambda})o(\\overrightarrow{\\lambda})\\omega d\\overrightarrow{\\lambda}}{\\int p(\\overrightarrow{\\lambda})\\omega d\\overrightarrow{\\lambda}}\\,\\,,\\nonumber \\\\   & = & \\left\\langle o(\\overrightarrow{\\lambda})\\right\\rangle _ { p}\\,\\,.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    here we have introduced an equivalence between the quantum expectation value @xmath70 , and the weighted probabilistic average @xmath71 .",

    "in other words , all quantum averages are now obtained by a convolution of a classical gaussian average with a width @xmath76 that depends on the kernel parameter @xmath10 , together with a probabilistic average over @xmath10 , with a width @xmath77 that depends on the phase - space distribution @xmath78 .",
    "the situation is depicted schematically in fig [ figure1 ] .",
    "consider the first - order moment where @xmath79 .",
    "this is straightforward , as @xmath80 , and the gaussian average of @xmath75 is simply the gaussian mean @xmath81:@xmath82    more generally , to calculate the antinormally ordered moment @xmath83 , one must calculate the corresponding gaussian moment @xmath84 .",
    "this is most easily achieved by use of the moment - generating function for the gaussian distribution in eq .",

    "general moments of the gaussian distribution are then given by:@xmath87 where it must be remembered that the adjoint vector @xmath88 is not independent of @xmath89 .",

    "quadratic term as:@xmath91 where we have introduced the normally ordered covariance :    @xmath92    writing these out in more detail , we obtain the following central results for calculating normally ordered observables up to quadratic order : +       comparing these equations with the schematic diagram in fig [ figure1 ] , we see that , as expected from a convolution , the overall variance of any quantity is the sum of the variances of the two convolved distributions ; that is , @xmath93",
    ". the results also support our interpretation given in section [ sub : extended - phase - space ] that @xmath28 and @xmath39 are , respectively , the normal and anomalous correlations that appear in many - body theory - except for the additional feature that we can now allow for distributions over these correlations .",
    "the expressions in the @xmath2-averages on the right - hand side are not complex - conjugate for hermitian - conjugate operators , because the kernel @xmath94 is generically not hermitian . of course ,",
    "after averaging over the entire distribution , one must recover an hermitian density matrix , and hence the final expectation values of annihilation and creation operators will be complex - conjugate . using the characteristic function , one can extend these to higher order moments via the standard gaussian factorizations in which odd moments of fluctuations vanish , and even moments of fluctuations are expressed as the sum over all possible distinct pairwise correlations .",
    "the results obtained above can be applied directly to obtaining the corresponding expectation values of normally ordered field operators :    @xmath95    these results show that in the field formulation of the gaussian representation , the phase - space quantities @xmath96 and @xmath97 correspond to single - time greens functions , analogous to those found in the propagator theory of quantum fields .",

    "they can be written as:@xmath119      there are two ways to generalize the coherent projectors into operators that are not density matrices : either by altering the thermal boson number @xmath102 so it does not correspond to a physical state , or by changing the displacements so they are not complex conjugate to each other .    the first procedure is the most time - honored one , since it is the route by which one can generate the classical phase - space representations that correspond to different operator orderings .",
    "the wigner@xcite , q - function@xcite , and s - ordered@xcite bases are very similar to gaussian density matrices , except with negative mean boson numbers:@xmath120 as pointed out in the previous subsection , it is also possible to choose @xmath102 to be non - hermitian , which would allow one to obtain representations of coherently displaced number states .",
    "however , there is a problem with this class of non - normally ordered representations .",
    "generically , they have a restricted set of operator identities available , and typically lead to fokker - planck equations of higher than second order - with no stochastic equivalents - when employed to treat nonlinear liouville equations .",
    "another widely used complete basis is the scaled coherent - state projection operator used in the positive - p representation@xcite and its stochastic gauge extensions@xcite:@xmath121 here we have introduced @xmath122 as a vector amplitude for the coherent state @xmath123 , in a similar notation to that used previously .",
    "this expansion has a complex amplitude @xmath36 , and a dynamical phase space which is of twice the usual classical dimension .",
    "the extra dimensions are necessary if we wish to include superpositions of coherent states , which give rise to off - diagonal matrix elements in a coherent state expansion . to compare this with the gaussian notation ,",
    "the projector is re - written using displacement operators , as:@xmath124    this follows since the vacuum state is an example of a thermal gaussian , and the other terms are all normally ordered by construction . from earlier work@xcite , it is known that any hermitian density matrix @xmath125 can be expanded with positive probability in the over - complete basis @xmath126 , and it follows that the same is true for @xmath94 .",
    "the effects of the annihilation and creation operators on the projectors are obtained using the results for the actions of operators on the coherent states , giving :     note that here one has @xmath127 , and thus all the antinormally ordered identities have just coherent amplitudes without derivatives , in agreement with the general identities obtained in the previous section . in treating nonlinear time - evolution , this has the advantage that some fourth - order nonlinear hamiltonian evolution can be treated with only second - order derivatives , which means that stochastic equations can be used . in a similar way , one can treat some ( but not all ) quadratic hamiltonians using deterministic evolution only .",
    "the fact that all derivatives are analytic - which is possible since @xmath128 - is an essential feature in obtaining stochastic equations for these general cases@xcite .",
    "the zero - temperature subset of the gaussian density operators describe the set of minimum uncertainty states , which in quantum optics are the familiar squeezed states@xcite .",
    "these are most commonly defined as the result of a squeezing operator on a vacuum state , followed by a coherent displacement :    @xmath129    the action of the multi - mode squeezing operator on annihilation and creation operators is to produce  anti - squeezed operators:@xmath130 where the hermitian matrix @xmath131 and the symmetric matrix @xmath132 are defined as multi - mode generalizations of hyperbolic functions@xcite :    @xmath133    note that @xmath134 and @xmath135 obey the hyperbolic relation @xmath136 and have the symmetry property @xmath137 . in the physics of bose - einstein condensates , @xmath138 and @xmath139 are just the bogoliubov annihilation and creation operators for quasi - particle excitations .",
    "the bogoliubov parameters provide a convenient way of characterizing the minimum uncertainty gaussian operators .",
    "we therefore need to relate them to the parameters in the gaussian covariance matrix .",

    "the determinant of the covariance matrix , required for correct normalization , reduces to the simpler form :    @xmath148    this set of diagonal squeezing projectors forms the basis that has previously been used to define squeezed - state based representations@xcite .",
    "because the basis elements in such bases are not analytic and the resultant distribution not always positive , these previous representations suffer from the same deficiency as the glauber - sudarshan @xmath2 representation , ( as opposed to the positive-@xmath2 representation ) , i.e. the evolving quantum state can not always be sampled by stochastic methods .      a non - hermitian extension of the squeezed - state basis [ eq .

    "this is equivalent to the replacement @xmath152and to @xmath134 being no longer hermitian .",
    "these non - hermitian operators are in the form of off - diagonal squeezing projectors and constitute the basis of a positive - definite squeezed - state representation .",
    "they include as a special case ( @xmath153 , @xmath154 ) the kernel of the coherent - state positive-@xmath2 expansion .",
    "thus the completeness of the more general representation is guaranteed by the completeness of the coherent - state subset , and we can always find a positive-@xmath2 function for any density operator by using the coherent - state based representation .",
    "mixed ( or classical ) squeezed states are generated by applying the squeezing operators to the thermal kernel , rather than to the vacuum projector:@xmath155 in this way , a pure or mixed gaussian state of arbitrary spread can be generated .",
    "once again , we can relate the covariance parameters characterizing the final state to the thermal and squeezing parameters by comparing the moments : @xmath156 since there are no anomalous fluctuations in a thermal state .",
    "similarly , the squeezing moments are @xmath157 thus the two parameterizations are related by    @xmath158    which can be written in a compact form as@xmath159 where the thermal matrix is defined as@xmath160    as in the cases for the other bases , these squeezed thermal states can be analytically continued to form a non - hermitian basis for a positive - definite representation . such a representation",
    "would be suited to bose - condensed systems , which have a finite - temperature ( thermal ) character as well as a quantum ( squeezed , or bogoliubov ) character .",
    "furthermore , the lack of a coherent displacement is natural in atomic systems , where superpositions of total number are unphysical .",
    "finally , the most general gaussian density matrix is obtained as stated earlier , by coherent displacement of a squeezed thermal state:@xmath161 in this way , a pure or mixed gaussian state of arbitrary location as well as spread can be generated . in terms of the normally ordered gaussian notation , the displacement and covariance of this case",
    "are given by:@xmath162",
    "the utility of the gaussian representation arises when it is used to calculate real or imaginary time evolution of the density matrix . to understand why it is useful to treat both types of evolution with the same representation , we recall that the quantum theory of experimental observations generally requires three phases : state preparation , dynamical evolution , and measurement .",
    "it is clearly advantageous to carry out all three parts of the calculation in the same representation , in order that the computed trajectories and probabilities are compatible throughout .",
    "many - body state preparation is nontrivial , and often involves coupling to a reservoir , which may result in a canonical ensemble .",

    "for example , the initial condition and complete time evolution of either a squeezed state ( linear evolution in real time ) or a thermal state ( linear evolution in imaginary time ) , with a quadratic master equation , is totally deterministic with the present method . by comparison , any previously used technique would result in stochastic equations or stochastic initial conditions , with a finite sampling error , in either case . while this is not an issue when treating problems with a known analytic solution , it means that in more demanding problems it is possible to develop simulation techniques in which the quadratic terms only give rise to deterministic rather than random contributions to the simulation , thus removing the corresponding sampling errors .",
    "finally , we note that the generality of the gaussian formalism opens up the possibility of extending these representations to fermionic systems .",
    "we gratefully acknowledge useful discussions with k. v. kheruntsyan and m. j. davis .",
    "funding for this research was provided by an australian research council centre of excellence grant .",
    "to obtain the operator identities required to treat the time evolution of a general gaussian operator , we need a set of theorems and results about operator commutators .",
    "these can then be used to obtain the result of the action of any given quadratic operator on any gaussian operator , as described in the main text .",
    "we use the following bosonic identities which are known in the literature , but reproduced here for ease of reference :    commutation : :    theorem ( i ) : +    given an analytic function @xmath274 with    a power series expansion valid everywhere , the following commutation    rules hold:@xmath275 & = & \\frac{\\partial p(\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}})}{\\partial\\widehat{a_{i}}}\\,\\,,\\nonumber \\\\    \\left[\\widehat{a_{i}},\\ , p(\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}}^{\\dagger})\\right ] & = & \\frac{\\partial p(\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}}^{\\dagger})}{\\partial\\widehat{a_{i}}^{\\dagger}}\\,\\,.\\label{a_{c}ommute}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    proof : using a taylor series expansion of    @xmath274 around the origin in    @xmath276 , one can evaluate the commutator of    each term in the power series .",
    "hence,@xmath275 & = & \\sum_{n}\\left[\\frac{\\widehat{p}_{n}}{n!}\\widehat{a}_{i}^{n},\\,\\widehat{a_{i}}^{\\dagger}\\right]\\nonumber \\\\     & = & \\sum_{n>0}\\frac{\\widehat{p}_{n}}{(n-1)!}\\widehat{a}_{i}^{n-1}\\nonumber \\\\     & = & \\frac{\\partial p(\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}})}{\\partial\\widehat{a_{i}}}\\,\\,.\\label{a_{c}ommute_{p}}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] +    the second result follows by taking the hermitian conjugate .",
    "ordering : :    theorem ( ii ) : +    given any analytic normally ordered operator function    @xmath277    with a power series expansion , the following ordering rules    hold:@xmath278^{n}p(\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}}^{\\dagger},\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}})\\,\\,,\\nonumber \\\\    ( \\widehat{a}_{i})^{n}p(\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}}^{\\dagger},\\widehat{\\mathbf{a } } ) & = & p(\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}}^{\\dagger},\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}})\\left[\\widehat{a}_{i}+\\overleftarrow{\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial\\widehat{a_{i}}^{\\dagger}}}\\right]^{n}\\,\\,.\\label{a_order}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] +    here the left arrow of the differential operator indicates the    direction of differentiation .",
    "+    we can write these two identities in a unified form by introducing an    antinormal ordering bracket , denoted    @xmath279 , which places all operators    in antinormal order relative to the normal term    @xmath280 . with this notation , we can write a single    ordering rule for all    cases:@xmath281p(\\underline{\\widehat{a}}):\\,\\,.\\label{a_order_gen}\\ ] ] proof : : :    since @xmath282 commutes with all other    annihilation operators and @xmath283    commutes with creation operators , theorem ( i ) also holds for any    normally ordered operator    @xmath277 ,    with a power series expansion ; provided derivatives are interpreted as    normally ordered also .",
    "the first case above then follows directly from    theorem    ( i):@xmath284p(\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}}^{\\dagger},\\widehat{\\mathbf{a}})\\,\\,.\\label{a_{o}rder_{p}}\\ ] ]    the required result then follows by using the equation above    @xmath285 times , recursively__. _ _ the second result is the    hermitian conjugate of the first .",
    "the last result , eq ( [ a_order_gen ] )    is simply a unified form that recreates the previous two equations .    this can be applied recursively , since the rhs of this equation is    always normally ordered by construction .",
    "_ corollary _ : : :    the antinormal combination of a gaussian operator    @xmath286 and any    single creation or annihilation operator is given by a direct    application of the ordering theorem , eq    ( [ a_order]):@xmath287\\widehat{\\lambda}_{g}(\\underline{\\widehat{a}}):\\,\\,.\\ ] ] +    it should be noticed here that the above expression assumes the    covariance has the usual symmetry : then every operator occurs twice in    the gaussian quadratic term , which cancels the factor of two in the    exponent .    in the main text ,",
    "these results are used directly to obtain all the required operator identities on the gaussian operators .",
    "in deriving the normalization , moments and operator identities of the gaussian representations , we have had to calculate nonstandard integrals of complex , multidimensional gaussian functions .",
    "the basic gaussian integral that must be evaluated is of the form@xmath288 where , as in eq .",
    "( [ trace ] ) , the covariance @xmath23 is a @xmath25 non - hermitian matrix , and @xmath289 and @xmath290 are complex vectors of length @xmath15 .",
    "there are two major differences between this expression and the better known form of the gaussian integral .",
    "first , the vectors @xmath61 and @xmath291 contain offsets which are not complex - conjugate : @xmath292 .",
    "second , the vector @xmath293 does not consist of @xmath15 independent complex numbers .",
    "rather , it contains @xmath12 independent complex numbers @xmath294 and their conjugates @xmath295 .",
    "to evaluate such an integral , we first write it explicitly in terms of real variables as@xmath296 where @xmath297 , @xmath298 , and @xmath299 , with the transformation matrix@xmath300 note that the offset vector @xmath301 will be complex , unless @xmath302",
    ". we may remove it by changing variables @xmath303 and using contour integration methods to convert the integral back into an integral on a real manifold .",
    "with the offset removed , the square of the integral can be written in the form of a standard multidimensional gaussian:@xmath304 where @xmath305 .",
    "assuming that the matrix @xmath306 can be diagonalized : @xmath307 , we can factor the integral into a product of @xmath15 integrals over the complex plane:@xmath308 where @xmath309 .",
    "these integrals can be evaluated by a transformation to radial coordinates , giving @xmath310 which holds provided that all the @xmath311 , i. e. that all eigenvalues of @xmath312 have positive real part . finally , noting that @xmath313",
    ", we find that@xmath314 with the condition that the eigenvalues of @xmath315 have positive real part .",
