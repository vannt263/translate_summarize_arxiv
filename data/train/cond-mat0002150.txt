    "chain polymers are often approximated as self- and mutually avoiding walks ( saw s ) on a lattice , and much information about the behavior of polymers both in a melt or in solution has been understood theoretically through this model @xcite .",
    "one of the characterizations of the conformations of a walk is through its mean - square end - to - end distance @xmath1 , where the mean is taken over all configurations of the @xmath0-step walk on the lattice . in the limit @xmath2 a scaling behavior",
    "@xmath3 is observed , where the exponent @xmath4 exhibits universal behavior , with a mean - field value @xmath5 for random walks , which correspond to ideal chains , and @xmath6 for saw s on two - dimensional lattices @xcite , for example .",
    "an interesting question arises if the chains are not considered to be totally flexible , an energy being associated to bends of the chain .",
    "this is often observed for real polymers .",
    "let us , for simplicity , restrict ourselves to saw s on hypercubic lattices . in this case ,",
    "consecutive steps of the walk are either in the same direction or perpendicular .",
    "so , a boltzmann factor @xmath7 may be associated to each pair of perpendicular consecutive steps of walk .",
    "this problem of semiflexible polymers ( also called persistent or biased walks ) has been studied for some time@xcite , and there occurs a crossover in the behavior of the walk between a rodlike behavior @xmath8 for @xmath9 , where the polymer is totally stiff , and the usual behavior with a different exponent @xmath4 for nonzero values of @xmath7 .",
    "stating this point more precisely , the mean square end - to - end distance displays scaling behavior in the limit @xmath10 , which is given by @xmath11 the observed values being @xmath8 and @xmath12 .",
    "the scaling function has the behavior @xmath13 in the limit @xmath14 .",
    "this scaling form has been verified through several techniques , although in three dimensions a mean field exponent @xmath5 was found for intermediate values of the number of steps @xmath0 , the crossover to the three - dimensional value occurring at rather high values of @xmath0@xcite .    in this paper , we consider the problem of a semiflexible polymer on a bethe lattice@xcite , calculating exactly the mean square end - to - end distance of walks on the cayley tree which start at the central site and have @xmath0 steps , supposing that the walks will never reach the surface of the cayley tree , thus remaining in its core .",
    "we calculate also the mean square end - to - end distance in the case when the lattice is considered anisotropic , that is , when the edges of the lattice are not equivalent with respect to their occupation by a polymer bond .",
    "the definition of the distance between two sites of the cayley tree is not obvious , and some possibilities exploring the fact that the tree may be embedded in a hypersurface of a non - euclidean space have been given@xcite . in this paper , however , we used a simpler definition , considering the cayley tree in the thermodynamic limit to be embedded in an infinite - dimensional euclidean space . the result for @xmath15 , for the isotropic case",
    "has the scaling form of eq .",
    "not surprisingly the scaling function @xmath16 is equal to the one obtained for random walks with no immediate return on an hypercubic lattice with the same coordination number of the bethe lattice considered .",
    "this might be expected since bethe lattice calculations lead to mean - field critical exponents .",
    "also , in the limit @xmath17 for nonzero values of @xmath7 the scaling behavior @xmath18 with the classical value @xmath5 is verified in the expression for @xmath19 .",
    "it should be mentioned that our proposal of defining the euclidean distance between two points of the cayley tree is similar to earlier results in the literature relating this distance to the chemical distance , measured along the chain @xcite .",
    "however , the distinction between the chemical and the euclidean distances is not always properly considered in the literature , and this may lead to contradicting results @xcite , as we will discuss in more detail in the conclusion .    in section [ s2 ]",
    "we define the model and calculate the mean square end - to - end distance recursively on the anisotropic bethe lattice . the problem",
    "is then reduced to finding the general term of a _ linear _ mapping in six dimensions . in the particular case of an isotropic lattice",
    ", we find a closed expression for @xmath20 . in section [ s3 ] the asymptotic behavior",
    "is studied for the general case , based on the mapping . in section [ s4 ]",
    "final comments and discussions may be found .",
    "finally , we present in the appendices a combinatorial calculation for @xmath21 in the isotropic case .",
    "we consider a cayley tree of coordination number @xmath22 and place a chain on the tree starting at the central site .",
    "each bond of the tree is supposed to be of unit length .",
    "figure [ f1 ] shows a tree with @xmath23 and a polymer with @xmath24 steps placed on it .",
    "since we want the cayley tree to be an approximation of a hypercubic lattice in @xmath25 dimensions , we will restrict ourselves to even coordination numbers @xmath26 .",
    "as in the hypercubic lattice , the bonds incident on any site of the tree are in @xmath25 directions , orthogonal to each other . as may be seen in figure [ f1 ] , the central site of the tree is connected to @xmath22 other sites , which belong to the first generation of sites .",
    "each of the sites of the first generation is connected to @xmath27 sites of the second generation , and this process continues until the surface of the tree is reached , after a number of steps equal to the number of generations in the tree . upon reaching a site of the @xmath28th generation coming from a site belonging to generation @xmath29 , there are @xmath27 possibilities for the next step of the walk towards a site of generation @xmath30 .",
    "one of them will be in the same direction as the previous step , while the remaining @xmath31 will be in directions orthogonal to _ all _ previous steps . in the second case",
    ", a statistical weight @xmath7 is associated to the elementary bend in the walk .",
    "therefore , we admit that the @xmath31 bonds which are orthogonal to the last step are also orthogonal to _ all _ bonds of the lattice in earlier generations .",
    "let us stress two consequences of this supposition : ( i ) a tree of coordination number @xmath22 with @xmath32 generations will be embedded in a space of dimension @xmath33 the sites of the cayley tree will all be sites of a hypercubical lattice in @xmath34 dimensions .",
    "this may be seen in figure [ f1 ] where the sites of a tree with @xmath23 and @xmath35 are sites of a cubic @xmath36 lattice .",
    "( ii ) by construction , there will never be loops in the tree , a property which is true for any cayley tree .",
    "it is well known @xcite that it may be shown by other means that the cayley tree is a infinite - dimensional lattice in the thermodynamic limit @xmath37 .",
    "finally , the anisotropy is introduced into the model considering that _ bonds _ of the chain in @xmath38 of the @xmath39 directions ( we will call them special ) at each lattice site contribute with a factor @xmath40 to the partition function , while no additional contribution comes from bonds in the remaining @xmath41 directions at each lattice site .",
    "usually @xcite , the calculation of thermodynamic properties of models defined on the bethe lattice is done in a recursive manner , so we will follow a similar procedure in the calculation of the mean square end - to - end distance .",
    "we define a generalized partition ( or generating ) function for @xmath0-step chains @xmath42 where the sum is over all configurations of the chain , @xmath7 is the statistical weight of an elementary bend in the chain , @xmath40 is the statistical weight of bonds in special directions and @xmath43 is a parameter associated to the square of the end - to - end distance of the chain . at the end of the calculation , we will take @xmath44 .",
    "the numbers of elementary bends , bonds in special directions , and the square end - to - end distance of each chain are @xmath45 , @xmath46 , and @xmath47 , respectively . the mean square end - to - end distance",
    "may then be calculated through @xmath48    the partition function may then be calculated in a recursive way if we define partial partition functions @xmath49 and @xmath50 such that the first ones include all @xmath0-bond chains whose last @xmath51 bonds are collinear and in one of the special directions ( there is necessarily a bend before the @xmath51 bonds , if @xmath52 ) , while the last @xmath51 bonds of the chains contributing to @xmath50 are collinear and in one of the non - special directions . the partition function",
    "may then be written as @xmath53 due to the fact that there are no closed loops on the cayley tree , it is quite easy to write down recursion relations for the partial partition functions    [ e7 ] @xmath54    with the initial conditions    [ e8 ] @xmath55    for example , in the first expression above , the new bond may be preceded by a bond in a special direction , with @xmath56 possibilities , or by a bond in a non - special direction , with @xmath57 possibilities . in both cases ,",
    "a factor @xmath43 is present since the bond added is in a direction perpendicular to all previous ones , and thus @xmath47 is increased by one unit . finally , the inclusion of the new bond introduces one bend in the chain , thus explaining the factor @xmath7 , and since the bond is in a special direction the factor @xmath40 is justified . in the second expression",
    ", it should be mentioned that @xmath47 is increased by @xmath58 , thus explaining the exponent of @xmath43 .",

    "the mapping may easily be solved and leads to an expression for @xmath117 which is _ identical _ to the one obtained for random walks without immediate return on a hypercubic lattice with the same coordination number @xcite .",
    "the identity between the two problems regarding thermodynamic properties derived from the free energy is well known @xcite , and is here extended for a thermodynamic average of a geometric property .",
    "one point which should be stressed is that the definition of the euclidean distance between two points on the bethe lattice is rather arbitrary .",
    "here we defined the distance by embedding the cayley tree in a hypercubic lattice of sufficiently high dimensionality . in the thermodynamic limit",
    "the dimensionality of this lattice diverges , as expected @xcite .",
    "other definitions of distance may be proposed @xcite .",
    "the simple one we adopted here leads to meaningful conclusions . since calculations on the bethe lattice",
    "are usually done recursively , and one step in the recursion relations corresponds to adding another generation to the tree , it is tempting to define the distance between two sites on the tree as the difference between the numbers of the generations they belong to .",
    "this definition , although simple and operational , has serious drawbacks , however .",
    "this is quite clear for the particular problem we looked at here , since it implies that @xmath72 for _ any _ @xmath0-step chain is equal to @xmath118 .",
    "we would thus have @xmath119 , the one - dimensional value , and the identity between the results for the bethe lattice and for walks without immediate return on hypercubic lattices would break down .",
    "this definition of distance was used recently in the exact calculation of correlation functions for a general spin-@xmath120 magnetic model @xcite , leading to @xmath119 , in opposition to the generally accepted mean - field value @xmath5 @xcite .",
    "the fact that all walks we considered here have their initial site located at the central site of the cayley tree is of course convenient for the calculations and may be seen as a particular case . a closer consideration of this point , however , leads to the conclusion that our results are exact for any chains such that the assertion that at any bend the new direction is perpendicular to _ all _ previous directions of bonds holds .",
    "thus , it is clear that if the whole chain is contained in one of the @xmath22 rooted sub - trees attached to the central site the results are still the same .",
    "if portions of the chain are located on two of these sub - trees the calculation becomes more complicated since , as may be seen in figure [ f1 ] , there are bonds in the same direction in different sub - trees .",
    "however , this problem may be easily avoided by enlarging the dimension of the euclidean space in which the tree is embedded , thus assuring that any two bonds in the same direction are necessarily connected by a walk without any bend .",
    "for such a tree , our results hold for any chain , regardless of the location of its endpoints .    in the general anisotropic case , we restricted ourselves to the discussion of the asymptotic behavior of @xmath72 , which was studied in the semiflexible case and also in the quasi - rigid limit . the expected scaling behavior was obtained in both cases , and a interesting discontinuity in the quasi - rigid limit amplitude is observed as the isotropic value @xmath73 is crossed .",
    "we acknowledge partial financial support from the brazilian agencies cnpq and finep .",
    "any @xmath0-step walk on the cayley tree will visit a subset of sites of the d - dimensional hypercubic lattice defining a subspace whose dimensionality is between 1 and @xmath0 .",
    "the limiting cases are the ones of a polymer without any bend ( rod ) , which is one - dimensional , and a polymer where we have a bend at every internal site , and since at each bend the new bond is in a direction orthogonal to all precedent bonds of the polymer , the polymer is embedded in a @xmath0-dimensional subspace . since the initial site of the chain is supposed to be at the central site of the tree , the end - to - end distance will be given by the modulus of the position vector of the final site , denoted by @xmath84 . for a polymer with @xmath45 bends , the number of components of this vector will be equal to @xmath121 . for simplicity , we will admit that each bond is of unit length , so that the components of @xmath84 will be integers .",
