    "in @xcite we constructed complete steady gradient ricci soliton structures ( including ricci - flat metrics ) on manifolds of the form @xmath4 where @xmath5 are arbitrary closed einstein manifolds with positive scalar curvature .",
    "we also produced numerical solutions of the steady gradient ricci soliton equation on certain non - trivial @xmath6 and @xmath7 bundles over quaternionic projective spaces . in the current paper",
    "we will present the analogous results for the case of _ expanding _ solitons on the same underlying manifolds .",
    "recall that a gradient ricci soliton is a manifold @xmath8 together with a smooth riemannian metric @xmath9 and a smooth function @xmath10 , called the soliton potential , which give a solution to the equation : @xmath11 for some constant @xmath12 .",
    "the soliton is then called expanding , steady , or shrinking according to whether @xmath12 is greater , equal , or less than zero .",
    "a gradient ricci soliton is called _ complete _ if the metric @xmath9 is complete .",
    "the completeness of the vector field @xmath13 follows from that of the metric ( cf @xcite ) .",
    "if the metric of a gradient ricci soliton is einstein , then either @xmath14 ( i.e. , @xmath13 is parallel ) or we are in the case of the gaussian soliton ( cf @xcite or @xcite ) .    at present most examples of non - khlerian expanding solitons arise from left - invariant metrics on nilpotent and solvable lie groups ( resp .",
    "_ nilsolitons _ , _ solvsolitons _ ) , as a result of work by j. lauret @xcite , @xcite , m. jablonski @xcite , and many others ( cf the survey @xcite ) .",
    "these expanders are however not of gradient type , i.e. , they satisfy the more general equation @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a vector field on @xmath8 and @xmath17 denotes lie differentiation .    a large class of complete , non - einstein , non - khlerian expanders of gradient type ( with dimension @xmath18 ) consists of an @xmath19-parameter family of solutions to ( [ gradrs ] ) on @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath2 are positive einstein manifolds .",
    "the special case @xmath22 ( i.e. , no @xmath2 ) is due to bryant @xcite and the solitons have positive sectional curvature . the @xmath23 case is due to gastel and kronz @xcite , who adapted bhm s construction of complete einstein metrics with negative scalar curvature to the soliton case .",
    "the case of arbitrary @xmath19 was treated in @xcite via a generalization of the dynamical system studied by bryant .",
    "the soliton metrics in this family are all of multiple warped product type . in other words ,",
    "the manifold is thought of as being foliated by hypersurfaces of the form @xmath24 each equipped with a product metric depending smoothly on a real parameter @xmath25 .",
    "more recently , schulze and simon @xcite constructed expanding gradient ricci solitons with non - negative curvature operator in arbitrary dimensions by studying the scaling limits of the ricci flow on complete open riemannian manifolds with non - negative bounded curvature operator and positive asymptotic volume ratio .",
    "as pointed out in @xcite , the situation of multiple warped products on nonnegative einstein manifolds is rather special because of the automatic lower bound on the scalar curvature of the hypersurfaces .",
    "this leads , in the case where all factors have positive scalar curvature , i.e. , @xmath21 , to definiteness of certain energy functionals occurring in the analysis of the dynamical system arising from ( [ gradrs ] ) , and hence to coercive estimates on the flow . in the present case , where one factor is a circle , i.e. , @xmath26",
    ", we can pass , as in @xcite , to a subsystem where coercivity holds , and this is enough for the analysis to proceed .",
    "the new solitons obtained , like those of @xcite , have conical asymptotics , and are not of khler type ( theorem [ mainthm1 ] ) .",
    "we note that the lowest dimensional solitons we obtain form a @xmath27-parameter family on @xmath28 .",
    "the special case @xmath22 was analysed earlier by the physicists gutperle , headrick , minwalla and schomerus @xcite .    as in @xcite",
    "we also obtain a family of solutions to our soliton equations that yield complete einstein metrics of negative scalar curvature ( theorem [ mainthm2 ] ) .",
    "these are analogous to the metrics discovered by bhm in @xcite .",
    "recall that for bhm s construction the fact that the hyperbolic cone over the product einstein metric on the hypersurface acts as an attractor plays an important role in the convergence proof for the einstein trajectories . when @xmath26 , however , no product metric on the hypersurface can be einstein with positive scalar curvature , so the hyperbolic cone construction can not be exploited directly .",
    "it turns out that the analysis of the soliton case already contains most of the analysis required for the einstein case .",
    "the new einstein metrics we obtain have exponential volume growth .",
    "since the underlying smooth manifolds in the present paper are identical to those in @xcite , our constructions give rise to pairs of homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic non - einstein expanding gradient ricci solitons as well as similar pairs of complete einstein manifolds with negative scalar curvature . furthermore , since our expanders and einstein metrics have asymptotically conical structures , we also obtain pairs whose asymptotic cones are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic .",
    "the details can be found at the end of  3 .    to make further progress in the search for expanders",
    ", we need to consider more complicated hypersurface types where the scalar curvature may not be bounded below .",
    "in @xcite we carried out numerical investigations of steady solitons where the hypersurfaces are the total spaces of riemannian submersions for which the hypersurface metric involves two functions , one scaling the base and one the fibre of the submersion .",
    "we now look numerically at expanding solitons with such hypersurface types , in particular where the hypersurfaces are @xmath29 or @xmath30 bundles over quaternionic projective space .",
    "we produce numerical evidence of complete expanding gradient ricci soliton structures in these cases .    before undertaking our theoretical and numerical investigations , we first prove some general results about expanding solitons of cohomogeneity one type . some of the results follow from properties of general expanding gradient ricci solitons",
    "however , the proofs are much simpler and sometimes the statements are sharper , which is helpful in numerical studies .",
    "the results include monotonicity and concavity properties for the soliton potential similar to those proved in @xcite in the steady case , as well as an upper bound for the mean curvature of the hypersurfaces . to derive this bound , we need to know that complete _ non - einstein _ expanding gradient ricci solitons have infinite volume .",
    "we include a proof of this fact here ( prop .",
    "[ logvol ] ) since we were not able to find an explicit statement in the literature",
    ". finally we derive an asymptotic lower bound for the gradient of the soliton potential , which is in turn used to exhibit a general lyapunov function for the cohomogeneity one expander equations .",
    "we briefly review the formalism @xcite for ricci solitons of cohomogeneity one .",
    "we work on a manifold @xmath8 with an open dense set foliated by equidistant diffeomorphic hypersurfaces @xmath31 of real dimension @xmath32 .",
    "the dimension of @xmath8 , the manifold where we construct the soliton , is therefore @xmath33 .",
    "the metric is then of the form @xmath34 where @xmath35 is a metric on @xmath31 and @xmath25 is the arclength coordinate along a geodesic orthogonal to the hypersurfaces .",
    "this set - up is more general than the cohomogeneity one ansatz , as it allows us to consider metrics with no symmetry provided that appropriate additional conditions on @xmath31 are satisfied , see the following as well as remarks 2.18 and 3.18 in @xcite .",
    "we will also suppose that @xmath10 is a function of @xmath25 only .",
    "we let @xmath36 denote the ricci endomorphism of @xmath35 , defined by @xmath37 and viewed as an endomorphism via @xmath35 .",
    "also let @xmath38 be the shape operator of the hypersurfaces , defined by the equation @xmath39 where @xmath35 is regarded as an endomorphism with respect to a fixed background metric @xmath40 .",
    "the levi - civita connections of @xmath41 and @xmath35 will be denoted by @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively . the relative volume @xmath44 is defined by @xmath45    we assume that the scalar curvature @xmath46 and the mean curvature @xmath47 ( with respect to the normal @xmath48 ) are constant on each hypersurface .",
    "these assumptions hold , for example , if @xmath8 is of cohomogeneity one with respect to an isometric lie group action .",
    "they are satisfied also when @xmath8 is a multiple warped product over an interval .",
    "the gradient ricci soliton equation now becomes the system @xmath49 the first two equations represent the components of the equation in the directions normal and tangent to the hypersurfaces @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "the third equation represents the equation in mixed directions ",
    "here @xmath51 denotes the codifferential for @xmath52-valued @xmath53-forms .    in the warped product case the final equation involving the codifferential automatically holds",
    "this is also true for cohomogeneity one metrics that are _ monotypic _ , i.e. , when there are no repeated real irreducible summands in the isotropy representation of the principal orbits ( cf @xcite , prop . 3.18 ) .",
    "there is a conservation law @xmath54 for some constant @xmath55 . using our equations",
    "we may rewrite this as @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the scalar curvature @xmath58 of the principal orbits . if @xmath59 denotes the scalar curvature of the ambient metric @xmath41 , then @xmath60 we can deduce the equality @xmath61    we let @xmath62 denote the _ dilaton mean curvature _ @xmath63",
    "this is the mean curvature of the dilaton volume element @xmath64 .",
    "it is often useful to define a new independent variable @xmath65 by @xmath66 and use a prime to denote @xmath67 .",
    "we note that equation ( [ tt ] ) implies that @xmath68 .",
    "it is also useful , following @xcite , to introduce the quantity @xmath69 the conservation law may now be rewritten ( for nonzero @xmath12 ) as @xmath70 note that for a function @xmath71 , the quantity @xmath72 is just the @xmath10-laplacian in the sense of metric measure spaces .",
    "another useful quantity is the normalised mean curvature @xmath73 which was introduced in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we now specialise to the case of _ expanding solitons _ , that is @xmath74 we shall consider complete noncompact expanding solitons with one special orbit .",
    "we may take the interval @xmath75 over which @xmath25 ranges to be @xmath76 with the special orbit placed at @xmath77 .",
    "let @xmath78 denote the dimension of the collapsing sphere at @xmath77 .",
    "we will moreover assume in this section that @xmath79 , since adding a constant to the soliton potential does not affect the equations .    a basic result of b.l .",
    "chen @xcite together with the strong maximum principle says that for a non - einstein expanding gradient ricci soliton @xmath80 .",
    "so we deduce from ( [ ham ] ) that @xmath81 using the first inequality and the smoothness conditions at @xmath77 we find as in the steady case that @xmath82 , so completeness imposes restrictions on our initial conditions .    integrating the second inequality and using the initial conditions yield @xmath83 and @xmath84 for a non - einstein , complete , expanding gradient ricci soliton of cohomogeneity one with a special orbit , the soliton potential @xmath10 is strictly decreasing and strictly concave on @xmath85 .",
    "the conservation law ( [ econs ] ) and the fact that @xmath86 is negative and @xmath12 is positive show that @xmath10 is strictly concave on a neighbourhood of each critical point @xmath87 . as we noted above",
    ", we also have concavity at the special orbit @xmath77 .",
    "now , as in the steady case @xcite , we see there are no critical points of @xmath10 in @xmath85 . as @xmath88 , we see @xmath10 is strictly decreasing on @xmath85 .    now set @xmath89 and differentiate ( [ cons1 ] ) ; using ( [ tt ] ) we obtain @xmath90 in particular @xmath91 since @xmath92 is negative . integrating shows",
    "@xmath93 is strictly decreasing , where we recall that @xmath94 is the relative volume . as @xmath25 tends to @xmath95",
    ", the smoothness conditions imply that @xmath93 tends to zero , so @xmath96 is negative , as required .",
    "our next result is inspired by the work of munteanu - sesum @xcite for the case of steady solitons .",

    "\\(ii ) next suppose that @xmath123 is always negative .",
    "now if @xmath124 is ever zero then it is negative and bounded away from zero on some semi - infinite interval . recalling that @xmath125 and integrating , we see that the soliton volume is finite , which contradicts proposition [ vol ] .",
    "so @xmath124 is positive on @xmath85 , and , using proposition [ expander - pot ] , we see @xmath62 is also positive on this interval .",
    "theorem 11 of @xcite shows that @xmath62 tends to infinity as @xmath25 tends to @xmath126 .",
    "but @xmath62 also tends to infinity as @xmath25 tends to zero , so we have a minimum @xmath114 where @xmath127 vanishes .",
    "now ( [ tt ] ) shows @xmath128 at @xmath114 and cauchy - schwartz shows @xmath129 at @xmath114 .",
    "as @xmath124 is decreasing , we have the desired result .",
    "this bound on @xmath124 is best possible , at least if we allow the solitons to be einstein .",
    "indeed , the negative scalar curvature einstein metrics of bhm @xcite give exactly this bound , as @xmath124 is asymptotic to @xmath130 .",
    "next we consider properties of the lyapunov function @xmath131 which was introduced by bhm in @xcite for the einstein case and was subsequently studied in @xcite and @xcite for the soliton case .",

    "there is an @xmath19 parameter family of non - homothetic complete smooth expanding gradient ricci soliton structures on the trivial rank @xmath27 vector bundle over @xmath350 , with conical asymptotics in the sense given above .",
    "[ ricci ] as in @xcite , we can see directly from the equations that the soliton potential @xmath10 is concave , in accordance with proposition [ expander - pot ] .",
    "we can similarly deduce directly that @xmath351 is positive semidefinite , so @xmath352 is subharmonic .",
    "next we note that when @xmath1 , the sectional curvatures @xmath353 , for @xmath354 tangent to different einstein factors , satisfy @xmath355 for certain positive constants @xmath356 .",
    "this shows that the hypothesis of @xmath357 in many results in @xcite is not satisfied by our examples . in particular , the simplest hypersurface type in our examples",

    "furthermore , all sectional curvatures decay faster than @xmath359 for an arbitarily small @xmath360 .",
    "hence the ambient scalar curvature @xmath59 tends to zero .",
    "finally we note that none of the hypotheses ( topological or metric ) in the recent rigidity theorem of chodosh @xcite are satisfied by our examples .",
    "we may also consider the flow of equations ( [ eqnx])-([eqnw ] ) in the variety @xmath361 .",
    "such solutions of course correspond to einstein metrics with negative scalar curvature , the soliton potential now being constant . in the case",
    "when @xmath362 for all @xmath276 , such metrics were constructed earlier in @xcite by dynamical systems methods as well . in @xcite",
    "we pointed out ( in remark 4.13 there ) that a simpler proof of bhm s result can be obtained using our special variables and the embedding of the einstein system within the soliton system .    in the present situation , where @xmath256 , the hypersurfaces in the multiple warped product no longer admit a positive einstein product metric whose hyperbolic cone acts as an attractor for the einstein system",
    "nevertheless our setup allows us easily to deduce the following    [ mainthm2 ] let @xmath349 be compact einstein manifolds with positive scalar curvature .",
    "there is an @xmath363 parameter family of non - homothetic complete smooth einstein metrics on the trivial rank @xmath27 vector bundle over @xmath350 .    to prove the theorem",

    "note that this variety is smooth .",
    "as in the previous section , we see that the flow is defined for all @xmath65 by first restricting to the subsystem obtained by omitting the equation for @xmath260 and observing that the locus @xmath366 is compact . as usual",
    "we can take @xmath367 positive on our trajectories , and we can show @xmath252 are positive also . in the following",
    "we will work with the subsystem .",
    "the @xmath325-limit set @xmath326 of a fixed trajectory will lie within the locus @xmath368 by the same argument as in the soliton case .",
    "however , the difference now is that no point in @xmath326 can have @xmath303-coordinate equal to @xmath95 .",
    "otherwise , @xmath369 and such a point is a critical point of type ( ii ) in lemma [ zeros ] .",
    "the argument in the last part of the proof of proposition 3.6 in @xcite then leads to a contradiction .",
    "this in particular implies that the only critical point of the flow lying in @xmath326 is @xmath370 ( since @xmath371 along our trajectory ) .",
    "we next consider the trajectory starting from a non - critical point in @xmath326 .",
    "recall from @xcite that on the locus @xmath372 , the quantity @xmath373 satisfies @xmath374 and the equation @xmath375 moreover , @xmath376 exactly when @xmath274 and @xmath377 , and @xmath378 exactly at the critical points @xmath288 ( of type ( vi ) in lemma [ zeros ] ) .",

    "@xmath303 is necessarily positive , so we obtain a contradiction since @xmath326 is compact , flow - invariant , and contains no point with zero @xmath303-coordinate .",
    "we therefore deduce that @xmath326 is @xmath381 .",
    "now it was observed in lemma 3.8 of @xcite that for the flow on @xmath382 , the point @xmath370 is a sink , so our ( original ) trajectory converges to @xmath370 .    as @xmath335 and @xmath303 is converging to a positive constant we deduce the metric is complete . using ( [ def - xi ] )",
    "we see that the metric components @xmath383 grow exponentially fast asymptotically .",
    "we end this section with some consequences of combining our existence theorems with a study of the differential topology of some of our examples .",
    "we will focus on the case where @xmath23 and @xmath384 is a homotopy sphere .",
    "recall that boyer , galicki and kollr @xcite , @xcite have constructed sasakian einstein metrics with positive scalar curvature on all kervaire spheres ( with dimension @xmath385 ) and those homotopy spheres of dimension @xmath386 or @xmath387 which bound parallelizable manifolds . as in @xcite we can take these einstein manifolds or the standard sphere as @xmath384 in our constructions in  2 and  3 . since it follows from the independent work of k. kawakubo @xcite and r. schultz @xcite that the manifolds @xmath388 and @xmath389 are not diffeomorphic if @xmath384 is an exotic sphere ( cf @xcite ) , we deduce the following    [ diffstr ] in dimensions @xmath390 and all dimensions @xmath391 with @xmath392 there exist pairs of homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic manifolds both of which admit non - einstein , complete , expanding gradient ricci soliton structures .",
    "the same holds for complete einstein metrics with negative scalar curvature .",
    "note also that our expanding gradient ricci solitons and negative einstein manifolds also exhibit conical asymptotics .",
    "the corresponding cones are differentially of the form @xmath393 , where @xmath394 is the set of positive real numbers .",
    "we are indebted to ian hambleton for providing an outline of the proof of the following consequence of the above - mentioned work of kawakubo and schultz .",
    "[ diff - str - cone ] let @xmath395 and @xmath396 denote respectively a non - standard homotopy sphere and the standard @xmath397-sphere . then the open cones @xmath398 and @xmath399 are not diffeomorphic .",
    "( i. hambleton ) let @xmath400 be an orientation preserving diffeomorphism",

    "@xmath405 for some @xmath406 .",
    "moreover , by alexander duality ( applied e.g. to @xmath407 with the ends capped off by attaching @xmath408 ) , @xmath409 is a two - sided hypersurface that separates @xmath407 into two path - connected open submanifolds of @xmath410 .",
    "let @xmath411 denote the closures of these path components . then , using the diffeomorphism @xmath412 , which has to preserve the ends of @xmath413 and @xmath410 , one easily sees that @xmath414 ( resp .",
    "@xmath415 ) is a compact manifold whose boundary consists of @xmath416 and @xmath409 ( resp . @xmath409 and @xmath417 ) .",
    "moreover , by composition with suitable retractions and the restrictions of @xmath412 or @xmath418 to suitable subsets , one also sees easily that the inclusion of the boundary components into @xmath414 are homotopy equivalences , i.e. , @xmath414 is an @xmath419-cobordism between its boundary components . noting that the whitehead group of @xmath420 is trivial and applying the @xmath65-cobordism theorem",
    ", we get a contradiction to the result of kawakubo and schultz that @xmath421 and @xmath422 are not diffeomorphic .",
    "hence we obtain for the dimensions given in corollary [ diffstr ] pairs of non - einstein complete expanding gradient ricci solitons ( or complete negative einstein manifolds ) whose asymptotic cones are homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic .",
    "we shall now look at some numerical solutions of the equations ( [ tt])-([ts ] ) .",
    "the ricci soliton equation in the cohomogeneity one setting has an irregular singular point at @xmath77 .",
    "we therefore follow the procedure in @xcite ,  5 and @xcite .",
    "that is , we first find a series solution in a neighbourhood of the singular orbit satisfying the appropriate smoothness conditions .",
    "we then truncate the series and use the values of the resulting functions at some small @xmath100 as initial values to generate solutions of the equations for @xmath423 via a fourth order runge - kutta scheme . because the manifolds we are considering are non - compact",
    ", we check the numerics obtained against the general asymptotic properties given in the first section .    the explicit cases that we shall look at are those where the hypersurface is the twistor space of quaternionic projective space and the total space of the corresponding @xmath3 bundle . for these examples ,",
    "the estimates @xmath424 and @xmath425 do not give coercive estimates , and we do not yet have analytical existence proofs .",

    "a @xmath430-invariant background metric @xmath432 is chosen on @xmath426 such that it induces the constant curvature @xmath53 metric on @xmath431 .",
    "the cohomogeneity one manifolds are then the vector bundles @xmath433 where @xmath434 is regarded as the unit sphere .",
    "let @xmath435 be an @xmath436-invariant decomposition of the lie algebra of @xmath430 , so that @xmath437 is identified with the tangent space of @xmath426 at the base point .",
    "we can further decompose @xmath437 into irreducible @xmath438-modules ; thus @xmath439 where @xmath440 and @xmath441 are respectively the tangent spaces ( at the base point ) to the sphere @xmath431 and the singular orbit @xmath442 .",
    "their respective dimensions are denoted by @xmath443 and @xmath444 .",
    "the metrics of cohomogeneity one take the form @xmath445 letting @xmath446 , the gradient ricci soliton equations become @xmath447 where @xmath448 are positive constants which appear in the scalar curvature function of the principal orbit .",
    "note that because of the backgound metric chosen , the coefficient @xmath449 of the @xmath450 term in the second equation becomes @xmath451 , and for expanding solitons we have @xmath452 .",
    "recall also the general relation @xmath453 , which follows from the conservation law and the smoothness conditions at @xmath77 . in generating the numerics",
    ", we find it convenient to eliminate homothetic solutions by choosing @xmath12 to be @xmath53 .",
    "furthermore , rather than setting @xmath79 , as was done throughout  1 , we now set the constant @xmath55 to be zero .",
    "it then follows from the necessary condition @xmath454 that in the series solution we must arrange for @xmath455 , with @xmath456 as an otherwise arbitrary parameter .",
