    "the first hint of a connection between core - collapse supernovae ( sne ) and gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) came in april of 1998 , when sn1998bw was detected in the _ bepposax _ error box of grb980425 ( galama et al .",
    "1998 ) . while unremarkable in its apparent properties ( peak flux , duration , burst profile ) , grb980425 ( isotropic ) energy release of only @xmath1 erg was some four orders of magnitude smaller than that of _ typical _ grbs ( e.g. , bloom et al .",
    "1998 ) . the observational basis for",
    "a connection between grbs and type ib / c sne has been greatly strengthened by the recent discovery ( hjorth et al .",
    "2003 ; stanek et al .",
    "2003 ) of a sn1998bw - like spectrum lurking beneath the optical afterglow of grb030329 .",
    "this sn has been designated sn2003dh .",
    "due to its extreme brightness and slow decay , spectroscopic observations of grb030329 have been extensive .",
    "the early spectra consisted of a power - law decay continuum ( @xmath2 ) typical of grb afterglows with narrow emission features identifiable as h@xmath3 , [ oiii ] , h@xmath4 and [ oii ] at @xmath5 ( greiner et al .",
    "2003 ) , making grb030329 the second nearest burst overall ( grb980425 being possibly the nearest at @xmath6 ) and the _ classical _ burst with the lowest known redshift . at this distance , grb030329 is typical in its gamma - ray budget  its total isotropic energy release is @xmath7 erg ( hjorth et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "independent of their connection with a grb , sn1998bw and sn2003dh belong to the unusual class of type ic sne .",
    "the lack of hydrogen lines in both spectra is consistent with model expectations that the stellar progenitor lost its hydrogen envelope to become a wolf - rayet ( wr ) star before exploding ( woosley 1993 ) .",
    "the broad lines are also suggestive of an asymmetric explosion viewed along the axis of most rapid expansion ( e.g. , macfadyen & woosley 1999 ) .",
    "the radiated energy may therefore be considerably smaller than the total explosive energy  in the range @xmath8 erg  inferred assuming spherical symmetry ( woosley et al . 1999 ) .",
    "moreover , the larger ratio of afterglow luminosity to sn luminosity in grb030329 is consistent with a burst that has been observed nearly on axis , whereas the low luminosity of grb980425 and its afterglow hint to a substantially off - axis view ( nakamura 1999 ; eichler & levinson 1999 ; woosley et al . 1999 ; granot et al .",
    "2002 ) . in these models ,",
    "together with the afterglow radiation restricted to a narrow relativistic beam , there is also quasi - spherical emission from slower moving sn ejecta running into the circumburst medium ( ramirez - ruiz et al .",
    "2002 ; zhang et al .",
    "the flux associated with the beamed component declines rapidly with observer direction , thus making the task of detecting misaligned grb jets particularly challenging ( granot et al . 2002 ) .",
    "even if grbs were caused by a standard set of objects , their appearance would depend drastically on orientation relative to the line of sight .",
    "the gamma - rays we receive come from material the motion of which is directed preferentially along the rotation axis of the stellar progenitor , and therefore provide no information about the ejecta in other directions . the propagation of gamma - rays through an external medium would , however , randomize the initial photon pulse energy and , because of light - travel time effects , produce a luminous reflection echo ( dermer et al 1991 ; madau et al . 2000 ; ramirez - ruiz et al . 2001 ;",
    "sazonov & sunyaev 2003 ) .",
    "we show below that the x - ray luminosity of such an echo exceeds during the first few weeks that produced by the underlying subrelativistic sn .",
    "the detection of energetic scattered light , with luminosities high enough to be detected by _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations ( and the _ swift _ experiment now under construction ) , may therefore provide a means for uncovering a population of misaligned grb jets associated with nearby type ib / c sne .",
    "conversely , one may use the lack of evidence for a compton echo to set constraints on the the density profile of the circumburst material that surrounds a massive star at the time of its death .",
    "the deceleration of a relativistic jet propagating through a stellar wind starts when about half the initial energy has been transferred to the shocked matter , i.e. when an amount @xmath9 of its own rest mass has been swept up .",
    "the relativistic expansion is then gradually slowed down , and the blast wave evolves in a self - similar manner with a power - law lightcurve ( blandford & mckee 1976 ) .",
    "this phase ends when a total mass @xmath10 ( we denote with @xmath11 the burst energy per unit solid angle ) shares the energy and the lorentz factor drops to 1 . as , in the unshocked stellar wind , the mass within radius @xmath12 is @xmath13 , the blast wave deceleration radius is @xmath14 , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 . at observer times of more than a day , the blast wave would be decelerated to a moderate lorentz factor , irrespective of the initial value ( rhoads 1999 ) .",
    "the beaming and aberration effects are thereafter less extreme , so we observe afterglow emission not just from material moving almost directly towards us , but from a wider range of angles .",
    "a temporal break occurs when the angle @xmath17 of the doppler beaming cone equals the jet opening angle @xmath18 . for a blast - wave decelerating according to the approximation @xmath19 for @xmath20 , and @xmath21 for @xmath22 , the time @xmath23 at which the temporal break is observed after the explosion is given by @xmath24/c$ ] . here",
    "@xmath25^{1/2}$ ] is the speed of the blast wave .",
    "this gives @xmath26 { ( 1+z ) \\over c}\\ ; \\;. \\label{ttime}\\ ] ] the lightcurve seen by an observer located within the initial jet aperture @xmath27 is very similar to that for an on - axis observer ( e.g. , dermer et al . 2000 ) but differs markedly in intensity once the observer is outside the beaming cone .",
    "the emission remains at a very low level until the doppler cone of the beam intersects the observer s line of sight .",
    "this can be seen by comparing the @xmath18 and @xmath28 curves in figure 1 .",
    "following the arguments given to derive equation ( [ ttime ] ) , we find that an off - axis observer ( @xmath29 ) starts to detect emission at a level comparable to an on - axis observer at times given by equation ( [ ttime ] ) , but with @xmath18 replaced by @xmath30 . as shown in figure 1 , it appears that the x - ray emission from highly misaligned grb jets ( i.e. @xmath31 ) is not significantly larger than that emitted by the sn remnant itself . since the jet opening angle of a grb",
    "is typically assumed to be of the order of @xmath32 ( frail et al .",
    "2001 ; which represents 0.76% of the full sky ) it is fair to conclude that detection of short wavelength transients associated with core - collapse sne will not unambiguously demonstrate the presence of a grb jet . the ratios of the on - axis to off - axis fluxes are however much smaller at radio frequencies where the emission persists at comparable levels for about the same length of time ( paczyski 2001 ) .      the beaming angle for the gamma - ray emission could be far smaller than that of the late - time afterglow , and is much harder to constrain directly . if the gamma rays were much more narrowly beamed than the optical afterglow there should be many _ orphan _ afterglows .",
    "the sudden brilliance of a grb propagating in a preburst stellar wind will be reflected by the circumstellar gas . if @xmath33 is the total energy emitted by the burst , where @xmath34 is the energy emitted per unit energy @xmath35 and unit solid angle @xmath36 , then the equivalent isotropic luminosity of the compton echo inferred by a distant observer is @xmath37 where @xmath12 is the distance from the site of the burst , @xmath38 is the differential klein - nishina cross section for unpolarized incident radiation , @xmath39^{-1}$ ] is the energy of the scattered photon , and @xmath40 is the local electron density ( madau et al .",
    "the equal - arrival time scattering material lies on the paraboloid determined by @xmath41 , where @xmath42 is the angle between the line of sight and the direction of the reflecting gas as seen by the burst ( e.g. , blandford & rees 1972 ) , @xmath43 is measured since the burst is first detected , and @xmath44 is the cosmological time dilation factor for a source at redshift @xmath45 . at energies below 100 kev , where the echo mirrors the spectral energy distribution of the prompt pulse , echoes will typically be harder than the x - ray afterglows observed at around 1 day . above 200 kev , and independently of the incident gamma - ray spectrum , reflection echoes will show a high - energy cutoff because of compton downscattering ( madau et al .",
    ". one distinctive feature of the echo signal is that the scattered radiation is likely to be polarized .",
    "even when the incident beam is unpolarized , the expected fractional polarization is @xmath46 .",
    "therefore , in the case of observing the jet precisely at @xmath47 , the scattered radiation is 100% polarized . on the other hand ,",
    "if the prompt radiation is 100% polarized ( e.g. , coburn & boggs 2003 ) , no net intensity will be seen at @xmath47 , since the electron s motion is confined to a plane normal to the observer ( e.g. , rybicki & lightman 1979 ) ] .",
    "the reflected flash luminosity of a collimated grb propagating through a constant velocity wind with @xmath48 is dominated by the receding jet as , at a given observer time , it originates closer to the grb where the density is higher . in this case , @xmath49 ( madau et al .",
    "2000 ) , where @xmath50 is the thomson cross section @xmath51 is total energy of the collimated grb pulse , and @xmath52 .",
    "the echo declines with time faster than most afterglows observed on - axis but exceeds them in intensity once the observer is outside the beaming cone ( fig .",
    "1 ) . for this reason",
    ", backscattered radiation could provide a means for detecting a population of misaligned grbs in nearby core - collapse sne and provide important information about the circumburst environment .",
    "equations ( [ lumecho ] ) and ( [ lumecho2 ] ) assume that photons scatter only once and that absorption is negligible . as the reflecting zone propagates along the receding beam , the backscattered radiation on the way to the observer will pass with impact parameter @xmath53 through regions of even higher density than the scattering layer . for a jet inclined at angle @xmath42 to the line of sight ,",
    "the electron column density traversed by the backscattered radiation in the steady , spherically symmetric wind of a wr star is @xmath54 , where @xmath55 .",
    "this amounts to an optical depth for thomson scattering of @xmath56\\,t_{\\rm days}^{-1}(1+z)$ ] for @xmath57 $ ] .",
    "photoabsorption at 1 kev takes place with a cross section of @xmath58 @xmath59 ( for solar abundances ) .",
    "multiple scattering and photoabsorption can therefore be neglected all times , corresponding to @xmath60 for jets with @xmath61 , where @xmath62 is the velocity of the sn ejecta . ]",
    "but in the very early light curve .",
    "collimated grb outflows directed away from an observer will produce extended x - ray transients at a flux level orders of magnitude lower than transients observed along the jet axis .",
    "the off - axis jet interpretation of grb980425 requires the viewing angle to have been @xmath63 with @xmath18 the half angle of the most energetic part of the jet , otherwise the x - ray afterglow would have contaminated the sn light curve unacceptably ( fig . 1 ;",
    "similar requirements have been derived for the optical light curve by granot et al .",
    "the off - axis jet interpretation of grb980425 typically assumes that our line of sight is a few degrees from the sharp - edge conical jet ( see dashed lines in fig .",
    "1 ) . this interpretation would be inconsistent with radio observations since in this case the jet deceleration would bring our line of sight into the jet s radiation beaming cone , leading to strong emission on timescales @xmath64 year ( waxman 2004a ) .",
    "our line of sight must make a large angle with the jet axis ( @xmath65 ) in order to avoid observing strong radio emission .",
    "the observed gamma - ray flux of grb980425 can be explained in this case by assuming that the jet is not sharp - edged , but rather has wings of lower lorentz factors that extend to large @xmath66 ( woosley et al .",
    "1999 ) and produce the observed faint burst .",
    "interestingly , this material would also increase the afterglow luminosity at early times when almost nothing is seen of the inner jet . at early times , the x - ray emission of the underlying subrelativistic sn is probably small ( waxman 2004b ) .",
    "the x - ray emission during the first few weeks should be therefore dominated by the rapidly fading echo ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the fact that the echo decay is both so steep and presents little spectral evolution will unambiguously distinguish it from any relativistic blast wave in which the electrons emit a constant fraction of the energy gained in the shock ( cohen et al .",
    "the lack of a detectable compton echo therefore places severe constraints on the brightness of a possible grb jet associated with sn1998bw , and it is to this problem that we now turn our attention .    during the first day after the explosion",
    "no significant flux was observed by _",
    "bepposax _ in the direction of grb980425 to a limit of about @xmath67 erg s@xmath68 .",
    "an off - axis jet with standard @xmath69 erg energy expanding into a wind with @xmath70 and @xmath71 can therefore be ruled out . a misaligned jet interpretation for grb980425",
    "may still be consistent with the observations if it is assumed that the wind of the progenitor was atypically - low density , with @xmath72 ( fig .",
    "the lower value of @xmath73 is consistent with the observed radio emission from the shock driven into the progenitor wind by the sn ejecta ( waxman & loeb 1999 ; li & chevalier 1999 ) , although , as usually in the case of radio sne , the data are unable to brake the degeneracy between @xmath74 and @xmath75 ( i.e. the fraction of the sn post - shock thermal energy carried by magnetic field ) .",
    "a model with @xmath76 and @xmath77 would need @xmath78 in order to reconcile radio observations with the prediction of an off - axis jet ( waxman 2004a ; soderberg et al .",
    "if , on the other hand , one adopts a model with @xmath75 near equipartition , then @xmath79 is required .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the lack of detection of a grb echo places robust constraints ",
    "i.e. independent of @xmath75 and complementary to those derived via radio observations  on the assumed density profile . by the same token , similar constraints on the intrinsic energy of a misaligned grb ,",
    "compatible with the circumstellar density profile inferred from radio observations , can be placed for sn1993j , sn1999em , sn2002ap and sn1994i ( fig .",
    "grb explosions are conjectured to radiate an anisotropic , beamed component from the decelerating , ultrarelativistic outflow and an unbeamed , isotropic component from the slowly expanding stellar debris .",
    "the flux associated with the former depends upon the observer direction and declines rapidly with observer time ( fig .",
    "hence the x - ray flux detected by an on - axis observer is much larger than the flux that would be detected from an identical source viewed off - axis .",
    "the relative flux levels of on - axis and misaligned jet sources are , however , much smaller in the radio / infrared than at optical and x - ray frequencies .",
    "transients from misaligned grb outflows could then be detected at late times with radio follow - up observations ( e.g. , granot & loeb 2003 ) .",
    "here we have considered an alternative possibility : the detection of scattered radiation from a narrowly collimated but misaligned pulse of gamma - rays propagating through a wr - type wind . while emission from the sn shock would dominate over the scattered radiation at late times because of the steeper lightcurve of a reflection echo , this will not be true at early times when the echo may be 3 orders of magnitude brighter .",
    "compton echoes in nearby sne could be studied with _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observatories out to a distance of 0.1 gpc .",
    "the planned _ swift _ experiment may also soon provide some constraints for individual bursts at higher threshold energies .    we have argued that the lack of a detectable echo in grb980425 may be consistent with an off - axis jet interpretation only if the density of the circumburst wind is @xmath80 , lower than expected for a wr star .",
    "the mass - loss history of a wr star during its last few centuries could be quite complicated as the star enters advanced burning stages unlike those in any wr star observed so far .",
    "the lightcurve of the resulting echo will depend fairly strongly on the properties of the progenitor system , especially the mass - loss rate of the star .",
    "the deceleration of a presupernova wind by the pressure of the surrounding medium could create circumstellar shells , as would the interaction of fast and slow winds from massive stars .",
    "the complex density structure seen in sn1987a may be a hint of the immediate neighborhood of a grb .",
    "further data on x - ray emission from nearby core - collapse sne will therefore offer important clues to the nature of the precursor star .",
    "we have benefited from many useful discussions with j. granot , c. kouveliotou , b. paczyski , m. rees , and e. waxman .",
    "we are particularly grateful to s. woosley and the anonymous referee for helpful insights regarding the calculations .",
