    "a system of nonlinear stiffness having a square displacement force term , and simultaneously , excited externally or parametrically has been a subject of studies for many years @xcite .",

    "it was also one of intriguing examples of simple nonlinear systems which showed complex behaviour including chaotic oscillations @xcite .",
    "another important , partially separated , class of systems can be determined on the basis of nonlinear damping . such damping can , in some systems , change the sign depending on velocity or displacement values , and",
    "provide excitation energy to the examined system .",
    "these , so called , self  exited damping terms are often used to describe systems with dry friction , bearings lubricated by thin layer of oil , shimming in vehicle wheels or chatter in cutting process , @xcite .",
    "more recently such a nonlinear damping force has also been considered @xcite in modelling of a modern vehicle suspension system due to electro- or magneto - rheological fluid damping where it is causing a hysteretic effect . in this model",

    "it appeared that for @xmath6 escapes and returns of the considered system to a single well oscillatory motion can happen for an interval of @xmath73 parameter which is close but slightly below the value transition to chaotic vibration .",

    "damping makes it possible to overcome the potential barrier between two symmetric potential wells much easier comparing the case without self excitation effect . on the other hand , the size of attractor for given @xmath5 ( fig .",
    "5 ) is solely determined by the shape of the nonlinear potential ( eq . [ eq2 ] , fig .",
    "1 ) . for @xmath6",
    "we have also found that for @xmath108 a transition chaotic vibrations was preceded by transient chaotic behaviour .",
    "the steady state motion undergo escape from a potential well with formation of symmetric attractor spreading on two potential wells . with increasing @xmath73",
    "the symmetry of attractor was broken and the system transit a series of period doubling bifurcations as was discussed in earlier papers @xcite .",
    "in summary we have studied conditions of a global homoclinic bifurcation in a double well potential van der pol system with parametric excitation .",
    "such a bifurcation correspond to transit chaotic behaviour of the system and with some further increasing of the excitation amplitude can lead to the permanent chaos @xcite .    using the melnikov method we have got the analytical formula for transition to chaos in a one degree of freedom , system subjected to parametric excitation with a non - symmetric stiffness with self - excitation term . in our case",
    "this effect is mutually introduced through the van der pol damping and parametric excitation terms .",
    "our analytical results are consistent with direct computations on homoclinic orbits .",
    "note that our vector field ( eq . [ eq3 ] ) is of @xmath139 class due to non - continuity of the second derivative at @xmath23 line or a piece ",
