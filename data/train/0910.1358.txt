    "baade s discovery ( 1946 , 1958 ) that the central regions of the galaxy , like other sb spirals , contained population ii stars sparked intense interest in the galactic bulge .",
    "because it is the closest galactic spheroid to the sun , we can study the galactic bulge in unique detail and use it to better understand galaxy formation and evolution .",
    "proposed senarios for building bulges include mergers and secular dynamical evolution ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "discriminating between bulge formation theories hinges on age determinations of bulge stars , a process complicated by crowding , contamination by foreground stars , reddening , and dispersion in both metallicity and distance along the line of sight . comparing main - sequence photometry of bulge globular clusters with halo globular clusters demonstrated that they are coeval @xcite . examining the color - magnitude diagrams of both bulge fields and clusters",
    "shows that the bulge clusters are representative of the general bulge population , the majority of which are old stars ( @xmath3 gyr ) ( e.g.  ortolani et al .",
    "1995 ; zoccali et al .",
    "although @xcite agree that the bulge is mostly old , their interpretation of the photometry permits a young metal - rich population of stars .",
    "evidence for a short star formation phase comes from the chemical composition of bulge stars .",
    "the @xmath4-elements ( o , mg , si , ca , and ti ) are created in the evolution and explosion of massive stars as core collapse supernovae ( sncc ) and almost immediately recycled in the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( e.g.  @xcite ) . because of their longer progenitor lifespan , type ia supernovae ( snia ) do not enrich the ism with substantial amounts of iron until 1 - 1.5 gyr after star formation begins @xcite .",
    "the delayed snia iron contribution dilutes the sncc - enhanced @xmath4/fe ratio until it reaches solar levels @xcite .",
    "since bulge giants maintain an elevated @xmath4/fe ratio to high metallicity , the bulge must have evolved faster than the solar neighborhood and undergone an intense burst of star formation early in the history of the galaxy ( e.g.  @xcite ) .    within this framework , the @xmath4-elements exhibit different behavior .",
    "the explosive @xmath4-elements si , ca , and ti appear to track each other @xcite .",
    "surprisingly , the hydrostatic @xmath4-elements o and mg do not , even though both are made in sncc progenitors and released in sn explosions . in particular , mg remains enhanced in the bulge to supersolar metallicities @xcite . the bulge o abundance closely tracks the abundance trends in disk stars and begins declining around [ fe / h]@xmath5 dex ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite reconciles these trends by invoking wolf - rayet winds in metal - rich , massive stars to produce lower mass sncc progenitors , which @xcite predict yield less oxygen .",
    "neutron - capture elements also have the potential to act as clocks .",
    "agb stars are associated with the production of @xmath6-process elements , while supernovae may be responsible for @xmath7-process elements .",
    "little information about neutron - capture elements is available in the bulge since the absorption lines are concentrated in the crowded blue portion of the spectrum .",
    "nevertheless , @xcite observed an enhanced eu abundance and tentatively suggest a behavior similar to ca .",
    "@xcite find a subsolar @xmath6-process abundance , reminiscent of old , metal - poor halo stars , indicating that the @xmath7-process dominates in the bulge .",
    "light elements , like na , contain important information about the chemical evolution of the bulge .",
    "na production is sensitive to the neutron excess @xcite and its yield is therefore dependent on the metallicity of its sncc progenitor .",
    "although typically interpreted as sncc ejectum , na can also be synthesized in envelope burning of agb stars .",
    "@xcite report a flat na abundance trend in the bulge below solar metallicity , after which it increases abruptly with a dispersion at high - metallicities exceeding measurement error .",
    "lecureur et al .",
    "determine that the elevated na abundance can not be explained by the mild internal mixing seen in their sample of giants and therefore must reflect the composition of the ism at its formation .",
    "our knowledge of the bulge s chemical evolution comes from spectroscopic studies of k and m giants because they are typically the only stars accessible to high - resolution observations due to the far distance and the high degree of interstellar extinction toward the bulge .",
    "however , large surveys designed to identify and follow up microlensing events , such as the optical gravitional lens experiment ( ogle ) and the microlensing observations in astrophysics ( moa ) collaborationiabond / alert / alert.html ] , have made possible the high - resolution spectroscopic study of otherwise unobservable bulge dwarfs . @xcite performed the first spectroscopic abundance determination for a microlensed bulge dwarf , 96-blg-3 , detected by the macho collaboration .",
    "based on low - resolution data , they estimated a metallicity of between 0.3 and 0.6 dex .",
    "@xcite obtained a high - resolution spectrum of a dwarf using keck .",
    "@xcite presented a preliminary abundance analysis of six microlensed bulge stars , including the minniti et al .",
    "star and two other dwarfs .",
    "there are seven published abundances analyses of microlensed bulge dwarfs based on high - resolution data : ogle-2006-blg-265s @xcite , ogle-2007-blg-349s @xcite , moa-2006-blg-099s @xcite , ogle-2008-blg-209s @xcite , moa-2008-blg-310s and moa-2008-blg-311s @xcite , and ogle-2009-blg-076s @xcite .",
    "although ogle-2008-blg-209s is actually a sub - giant , we will refer to these seven stars collectively as bulge dwarfs .",

    "dwarfs , whose detailed abundances will appear in bensby et al .",
    "( in prep . ) and johnson et al . ( in prep . ) .    studying dwarfs offers several advantages .",
    "dwarfs are subject to different systematic effects than the giants .",
    "mixing on the red giant branch ( rgb ) can destroy some elements and dredge up others , altering a star s surface composition .",
    "some elements that are difficult to see in giants , like s and zn , can be measured in dwarfs since their hotter temperatures strengthen these atomic lines while weakening cn .",
    "additionally , we can compare the metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) for dwarfs and giants .",
    "the first - observed high - magnification bulge dwarf with a high - resolution spectrum had a surprisingly high metallicity of 0.56 dex @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations revealed more metal - rich dwarfs indicating that high metallicities are common in bulge dwarfs .",
    "by contrast , the bulge giant mdf peaks just below solar metallicity ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that high - metallicity stars experience a sufficiently high mass - loss rate to cause them to peel off the rgb before undergoing a he flash and become he white dwarfs ( wds ) .",
    "@xcite counter that this scenario would produce a decline in the rgb luminosity function , which is not observed in the @xcite data .",
    "ogle-2008-blg-209s , the first bulge sub - giant with a high - resolution spectrum , was found to have a subsolar metallicity , consistent with the giants also located in baade s window @xcite .",
    "the detection of metal - poor dwarf ogle-2009-blg-076s opposes the idea of a strong selection effect against metal - poor microlensed stars .",
    "here we present both the high - magnification bulge dwarf mdf and a detailed chemical abundance analysis of the eighth bulge dwarf , ogle-2007-blg-514s .",

    "ogle-2007-blg-514s s dereddened johnson - cousins color and magnitude relative to the red clump ( see  [ sec : photometric parameters ] ) are consistent with it being a main sequence turnoff star at the distance of the red clump .",
    "alerted to this situation , michael rauch and george becker took three high - resolution spectra of ogle-2007-blg-514s with the magellan inamori kyocera echelle ( mike ) double spectrograph mounted on the clay telescope at las campanas @xcite .",
    "the slit was 1@xmath12 wide , giving a resolution of 25,000 .",
    "one 20-minute and two 30-minute exposures were taken , in addition to the usual th - ar and flatfield calibration frames .",
    "we use only the red side of the spectrograph , covering the wavelength range @xmath13 .",
    "the three exposures were combined to make the final spectrum for analysis .",
    "these data were then reduced using the procedure described in @xcite .    at its peak , ogle-2007-blg-514s was magnified by a factor of @xmath141300 as it crossed a cusp in the caustic , brightening this @xmath15 mag star to approximately 13.3 mag .",
    "this is probably the faintest star for which a high - resolution spectrum has been obtained .",
    "finite source effects , in particular the magnification of the limb relative to the center occur during such crossings .",
    "we have modeled the effect of differential limb magnification on the spectrum , and find that in more extreme cases than the actual observations discussed here , the change in the derived temperature is @xmath16 k , in microturbulent velocity is @xmath17 km s@xmath18 , and in surface gravity is @xmath19 dex , all much smaller than the uncertainties in our atmospheric parameters ( see  [ sec : error analysis ] ) due to the s / n of the spectrum , blending of lines , and other effects that appear in all spectra , whether magnified or not ( johnson et al .",
    "2009 , in prep ) .",
    "johnson et al .  find that ignoring differential limb magnification when analyzing the spectrum results in abundance errors @xmath20 dex .",
    "we measure the per pixel signal - to - noise ratio ( s / n ) in the continuum regions at three different wavelengths to provide a sense how the s / n deteriorates due to reddening .",
    "the spectrum has a s / n of @xmath21 at @xmath22 , @xmath23 at @xmath24 , and @xmath25 at @xmath26 .",
    "bluer than that , the s / n additionally suffers from reduced flux from the star due to its relatively cool temperature and the strong metal - absorption lines in this portion of the spectrum .",
    "figure [ fig : otriplet ] gives an example of the quality of the data in the red portion of the spectrum .",
    "for ogle-2007-blg-514s , we measure an average radial velocity of @xmath27 km s@xmath18 from ten unblended iron lines with accurate laboratory wavelengths . at the time of observation",
