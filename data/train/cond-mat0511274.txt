    "@xmath23 is the spontaneous polarization along @xmath22 direction .",
    "there are only 3 independent piezoelectric coefficients : @xmath24 , @xmath25 , and @xmath26 .",
    "it is necessary to point out that here the definition of piezoelectricity is different from that in ref .   where the piezoelectricity reflects the relation between polarizations and stresses .",
    "the piezoelectric coefficients obtained by the present work are listed in table  [ piezoconst ] .",
    "good agreements have been achieved between the present results and those in literatures ( see tables  [ elaconst ] and [ piezoconst ] ) . confirming that our computational procedure can give reasonable results for bulk zno systems , we proceed to analyze zno single layers and nanotubes .",
    "in this section , we discuss the elasticity and piezoelectricity of zno single layers .",
    "first , as an initial configuration , we take a single zn - o layer ( shown in the left side of fig .",
    "[ singlelay ] ) cut from the wurtzite zno crystal , and then optimize its structure . as an stable configuration , we obtain a planar graphite - like structure as shown in the right side of fig .",
    "[ singlelay ] . here",
    "we use @xmath27 monkhorst - pack k - points and two different groups of other input parameters for calculations .",
    "the final optimized results , listed in table  [ planartab ] , are insensitive to the input parameters .",
    "the bond length of the planar structure is slightly smaller than that of zno crystals .",
    "its binding energy is -8.246 ev / zno , higher than the value -8.947 ev / zno of zno crystals .",
    "now we consider a wurtzite zno thin film with two polar surfaces ( @xmath28 faces ) . its energy is higher than that of bulk zno with the same number of atoms by @xmath29 j / m@xmath30 ( the cleavage energy density @xcite ) because of the spontaneous polarization in * c * direction . here",
    "we derive the the critical layer number based on our above result for planar zno single layers . considering the influence of spontaneous polarization",
    ", we estimate the total binding energy @xmath31 ev for the wurtzite thin film with @xmath32 zn - o single layers , where @xmath33 is the area for a unit cell of the zno crystal in ab plane and @xmath34 the number of unit cells in each layer . if we consider the thin film with @xmath32 planar single layers and neglect the very weak interlayer attractions , the total binding energy is about @xmath35 ev .",
    "we find @xmath36 for @xmath37 , which implies that a zno thin film less than @xmath38 zn - o layers prefers the planar graphite - like structure to the wurtzite structure . here",
    "the estimated value 4 is the lower bound of critical number @xmath39 because we neglect the weak interlayer attractions .",
    "note that the cleavage energy density may depend on the layer number and structural relaxation .",
    "considering the structural relaxation , meyer and marx @xcite found that the the cleavage energy density varied from 3.0 j / m@xmath30 to 3.4 j / m@xmath30 , weakly dependent on the the layer number . using these values , the lower bound of critical number @xmath39 is changed to 3 .",
    "if we consider the interlayer attractions coming from the dipole - dipole interaction between planar zno layers because of their spontaneous polarizations ( the ground state : spontaneous polarizations antiparallel in the neighbor layers ) , we should obtain @xmath40 , which is the exact meaning of `` the lower bound of critical number being 3 '' .",
    "et al . _ also obtained a critical thickness by dft calculations .",
    "@xcite they investigated the binding energy of the thin films with @xmath41 single planar layers ( layer distance 2.4  ) and compared it with the binding energy of the thin films ( wurtzite structure ) with the same number of zn - o layers .",
    "they found that the zno thin film less than eighteen zn - o layers prefers the planar graphite - like structure to the wurtzite structure .",
    "as is well known , the widely used dft packages can not accurately describe the interlayer interactions .",
    "@xcite thus the critical layer number @xmath42 obtained directly from dft calculations might be inaccurate although it satisfies @xmath40 . with the development of dft method ,",
    "one may obtain the accurate critical layer number in the future when dft packages can deal well with the interlayer interactions .    adopting the optimized structure",
    ", we can calculate the elastic and piezoelectric constants of zno single layers . from fig .",
    "[ graphicly ] , we find that the zno single layer has the 3-fold rotation symmetry and a reflection symmetry respect to @xmath43-axis . thus the stress - strain relation is expressed in the matrix form : @xcite @xmath44=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } c_{11 } & c_{12 } & 0\\\\ c_{12}&c_{11}&0\\\\ 0&0&\\frac{c_{11}-c_{12}}{2}\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\epsilon_1\\\\ \\epsilon_2\\\\ \\epsilon_6\\end{array}\\right].\\ ] ] there are only two independent elastic constants : @xmath12 and @xmath13 .",
    "the piezoelectricity can be expressed as @xmath45=\\left[\\begin{array}{ccc } e_{11 } & -e_{11 } & 0\\\\ 0&0&-e_{11}\\end{array}\\right]\\left[\\begin{array}{c } \\epsilon_1\\\\ \\epsilon_2\\\\ \\epsilon_6\\end{array}\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the spontaneous polarization in the @xmath43-direction .",
    "there is only one independent piezoelectric coefficient @xmath47 .",
    "the calculated values of the elastic and piezoelectric constants of zno single layers are listed in table  [ elaconstsl ] . using the elastic constants",
    ", we calculate the young s modulus per atom by @xmath48 ev / atom , which is quite smaller than the value @xmath49 ev / atom for a single graphite layer obtained in our previous work .",
    "@xcite additionally , we observe that the zno single layer ( @xmath50 e /  ) has stronger piezoelectricity than the bn single layer ( @xmath51 e /  ) . @xcite",
    "generally speaking , if a material can exist in graphite - like structure , the corresponding nanotubes can be synthesized in the laboratory .",
    "@xcite a natural question is : how can we fabricate swzonts ?",
    "we propose a possible way in this section .    without considering the two ends ,",
    "an swzont can be thought of as a cylinder rolled up from a single sheet of zno layer such that two equivalent sites of the hexagonal lattice coincide . to describe the swzont",
    ", we introduce several characteristic vectors in analogy with a single - walled carbon nanotube . as shown in fig .",
    "[ graphicly ] , the chiral vector @xmath52 , which defines the relative location of two sites , is specified by a pair of integers @xmath53 which is called the index of the swzont and relates @xmath52 to two unit vectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 of the hexagonal lattice ( @xmath56 ) .",
    "the chiral angle @xmath57 defines the angle between @xmath54 and @xmath52 . for an @xmath58 nanotube ,",
    "@xmath59 $ ] . the translational vector *",
    "t * corresponds to the first point in the hexagonal lattice through which the line normal to the chiral vector @xmath52 passes .    we calculate the binding energy of swzonts with different indexes which is shown in fig .",
    "[ bindzont ] . from this figure",
    "we find that : ( i ) the binding energy for different swzonts is negative , which suggests these swzonts can exist in principle ; ( ii ) the binding energy ( @xmath60 ) decreases with the increase of the radius ( @xmath61 ) of swzonts and can be well fit by @xmath62 obviously , @xmath63 ev / zno for @xmath64 .",
    "this value is quite close to the binding energy ( -8.246 ev / zno ) of a zno single planar layer .",
    "the term @xmath65 reflects the curvature effect of nanotubes .",
    "the classic shell theory also gives the same form , @xmath66 , for the curvature effect,@xcite where @xmath67 is the rigidity of the zno single layer and @xmath68@xmath30 is the area of the parallelogram generated by the unit vectors @xmath54 and @xmath55 .",
    "thus we obtain @xmath69 ev , which is quite smaller than the rigidity ( 1.17 ev)@xcite of a single graphite layer .",
    "the zno single layer is much softer than the graphite layer such that it should be more easily wrapped up into a nanotube .",
    "the solid - vapor phase process has been employed to successfully synthesize zno nanobelts , nanorings , and nanohelixes .",
    "@xcite it might also be used to realize swzonts with carbon nanotubes as templates . as shown in fig .",
    "[ vsphase ] , the zno powder decomposes into gaseous zn@xmath70 and o@xmath71 at high temperature and low pressure .",
    "@xcite after that , ar flow carries zn@xmath70 and o@xmath71 to the low temperature zone at relative higher pressure where zn@xmath70 and o@xmath71 will deposit on the carbon nanotube array prepared carefully in advance . controlling the low enough density of zn@xmath70 and o@xmath71 and the proper distance between carbon nanotubes ,",
    "one may obtain thin enough zno films , for example less than 3 single layers , coating on the surfaces of carbon nanotubes .",
    "these films prefer the multi - walled tubes to the wurtzite structure because the layer number is smaller than 3 .",
    "one may take out the swzonts from the multi - walled tubes by analogy with the method in carbon nanotubes .",
    "@xcite    now we discuss two points in the above process .",
    "the first point is the growth temperature . from the conditions for producing zno nanobelts , @xcite the growth temperature of zno nanotubes",
    "is expected to be 300500 @xmath72c . at this temperature ,",
    "the highly purified carbon nanotubes are chemically inactive , @xcite which ensures that they merely work as templates but do not react with zn@xmath70 or o@xmath71 .",
    "the other point is the critical radius of the synthesized swzonts .",
    "the carbon - zno multi - walled tubes can form in the above process if the attraction between nanotubes overcomes the curvature energy of zno nanotubes . for simplicity",
    ", we consider a carbon nanotube coated by an swzont .",
    "the attraction between them is approximately described by the lennard - jones potential .",
    "the layer distance is estimated to be 34   from the van der waals radii of carbon , oxygen , and zinc atoms .",
    "@xcite the attraction energy ( @xmath73 ) is about @xmath74 mev / zno .",
    "@xcite from @xmath75 , we obtain the smallest radius @xmath76   synthesized in the above process .",
    "we should emphasize that the above process is merely possible method to produce the zno nanotubes in terms of the first - principles calculation and the previous experiments @xcite on the growth of zno nanobelts .",
    "whether it works or not , experimental researches will gives an answer in the future .",
    "it is useful to discuss the piezoelectricity of swzonts .",
    "we need not to do additional dft calculations considering the experience obtained by sai _",
    "_ in the study of the piezoelectricity of single - walled bn nanotubes .",
    "@xcite they found that the piezoelectricity of bn nanotubes depends on the chirality .",
    "the physical origin is that an angle between local polarization of each unit cell and the tube axis depends on the chiral angle .",
    "their key point is that the curvature of nanotubes has so small effect on the piezoelectricity that we can directly deduce their piezoelectric property from the piezoelectricity of single layers .",
    "two deformation modes will result in the change of the polarization in the direction of tube axis : one is the tension or compression strain ( @xmath77 ) along the tube axis , another is the shear strain ( @xmath78 , the twist angle per length ) induced by the torsion around the tube axis .",
    "the variation of the polarization can be expressed as @xmath79 where @xmath80 represents the perimeter of the nanotube .",
    "following ref . , one can derive the coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 from the transformation between coordinate systems @xmath83 and @xmath84 shown in fig .",
    "[ graphicly ] . from above",
    "three equations , we find that the piezoelectricity of swzonts depends on their chiral angles . for zigzag tubes ( @xmath85 , @xmath86 ) , only tension or compression strains induce polarizations , while only shear strains play roles for armchair tubes ( @xmath87 , @xmath88 ) .",
    "both strains work for achiral tubes . for a specific pure axial strain ,",
    "the variation of the polarization decreases with the increase of chiral angle @xmath57 from @xmath89 to @xmath90 . for pure shear strain induced by the torsion around the tube axis , the absolute variation of the polarization increases with the increase of chiral angle @xmath57 from @xmath89 to @xmath90 .",
    "these effects are more evident in swzonts than in bn nanotubes because the zno single layer has a relative larger @xmath47 than the bn single layer .",
    "we have calculated the elastic constants and piezoelectric coefficients of zno crystals and single layers .",
    "we find that zno single layers are much more flexible than graphite single layers in the elasticity and stronger than boron nitride single layers in the piezoelectricity .",
    "swzonts are demonstrated to exist in principle and might be realized by the solid - vapor phase process with carbon nanotubes as templates .",
    "finally , we would like to point out some potential applications of swzonts and related structures .",
    "( i ) swzonts , same as other zno nanostructures , can be applied in optoelectric devices .",
    "the quality of swzont - based devices should be higher than others because of their very small thickness .",
    "( ii ) the piezoelectricity of swzonts depends on their chirality . for most zno nanotubes except the zigzag type , twists around the tube axis will induce axial polarizations .",
    "this property makes swzonts possible to be used in the torsion measurement devices .",
    "for example , one may use swzonts to make very small coulomb torsion balance .",
    "( iii ) swzonts , except the armchair tubes , are polar tubes .",
    "@xcite water transport , ice formation , and biopolymer translocation in polar tubes should exhibit quite different characteristics from those in non - polar tubes .",
    "the latter has been fully studied , especially for carbon nanotubes , @xcite while the former has attracted no attention even for bn tubes up to now .",
    "( iv ) the carbon - zno nanotubes formed in the solid - vapor phase process must have excellent mechanical and electrical properties : on the one hand , they have high enough rigidity and axial strength because of the contribution of carbon nanotubes .",
    "on the other hand , they exhibit strong piezoelectricity coming from the zno tubes .",
    "these structures may be employed to make electric nanotube motors @xcite where the axial voltage will be greatly reduced relative to carbon nanotube motors @xcite because of the high piezoelectricity of zno tubes .",
