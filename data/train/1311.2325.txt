    "the original motivation of this project is to study the transports of positive and negative charges in solar cells .",
    "we model a solar cell by a domain in @xmath0 that is divided into two disjoint sub - domains @xmath1 and @xmath2 by an interface @xmath3 , a @xmath4-dimensional hypersurface , which can be possibly disconnected . @xmath1 and @xmath2 represent the hybrid medium that confine the positive and the negative charges , respectively . at microscopic level ,",
    "positive and negative charges are initially modeled by @xmath5 independent reflected brownian motion ( rbm ) with drift on @xmath1 and on @xmath2 respectively .",
    "( in this paper , they are actually modeled by @xmath5 independent random walks on lattices inside @xmath1 and @xmath2 that serve as discrete approximation of rbm with drifts . )",
    "these random motions model the transport of positive ( respectively negative ) charges under an electric potential ( see figure [ fig : interface ] ) .",
    "is the interface of @xmath6 and @xmath2 ]    these two types of particles annihilate each other at a certain rate when they come close to each other near the interface @xmath3 .",
    "this interaction models the annihilation , trapping , recombination and separation phenomena of the charges .",
    "the interaction distance is of microscopic order @xmath8 where @xmath9 is comparable to 1 , and the intensity of annihilation per pair is of order @xmath10 where @xmath11 is a given parameter .",
    "this means that , intuitively and roughly speaking , according to a random time clock which runs with a speed proportional to the number of pairs ( one particle of each type ) of distance @xmath8 , we annihilate a pair ( picked uniformly among those pairs of distance less than @xmath8 ) with an exponential rate of parameter @xmath10 .",
    "the above scaling guarantees that in the limit , a nontrivial proportion of particles are annihilated in any open time interval .",
    "we investigate the scaling limit of the empirical distribution of positive and negative charges ; that is , the hydrodynamic limit of this interacting diffusion system . we show that in the macroscopic level , the empirical distribution converges to a deterministic measure whose density satisfies a system of partial differential equations that has non - linear interaction at the interface .",
    "the study of _ hydrodynamic limits _ of particle systems with stochastic dynamics is of fundamental importance in many areas .",
    "this study dates back to the sixth hilbert problem in year 1900 , which concerns the mathematical treatment of the axioms of physics , and to boltzmann s work on principles of mechanics .",
    "proving hydrodynamic limits corresponds to establishing _ the law of large number _ for the empirical measure of some attributes ( such as position , genetic type , spin type , etc . ) of the individuals in the systems .",
    "it contributes to our better understanding of the asymptotic behavior of many phenomena , such as chemical reactions @xcite , population dynamics @xcite , super - conductivity @xcite , quantum dynamics @xcite , fluid dynamics @xcite , etc .",
    "it reveals fascinating connections between the microscopic stochastic systems and deterministic partial differential equations that describe the macroscopic pictures .",
    "it also provides approximations via stochastic models to some partial differential equations that are hard or impossible to solve directly .    since the work of boltzmann and hilbert , there have been many different lines of research on stochastic particle systems .",
    "various models were constructed and different techniques were developed to establish hydrodynamic limits . among those techniques ,",
    "the entropy method @xcite and the relative entropy method @xcite are considered to be general methods .",
    "unfortunately these methods do not seem to work for our model due to the singular interaction near the interface .",
    "many models studied in literature are conservative , for example exclusion processes @xcite and fleming - viot type systems @xcite . reaction - diffusion systems ( r - d system ) constitute a class of models that are typically non - conservative .",
    "these are systems which have hydrodynamic limits of the form @xmath12 ( a reaction - diffusion equation , or r - d equation in short ) , where @xmath13 is a function in @xmath14 which is thought of as the reaction term .",
    "r - d systems arise from many different contexts and have been studied by many authors . for instance , for the case",
    "@xmath13 is a polynomial in @xmath14 , these systems contain the schlgl s model and were studied in @xcite on a cube with neumann boundary conditions , and in @xcite on a periodic lattice .",
    "recently , perturbations of the voter models which contain the lotka - volterra systems are considered in @xcite .",
    "in addition to results on hydrodynamic limit , @xcite also established general conditions for the existence of non - trivial stationary measures and for extinction of the particles .",
    "our model is a non - conservative stochastic particle system which consists of two types of particles . in @xcite ,",
    "burdzy and quastel studied an annihilating - branching system of two types of particles , for which the total number of particles of each type remains constant over the time .",
    "its hydrodynamic limit is described by a linear heat equation with zero average temperature .",
    "in contrast , besides being non - conservative , our model gives rise to a system of nonlinear differential equations that seems to be new .",
    "moreover , the interaction between two types of particles is singular near the interface of the two media , which gives rise to a boundary integral term in the hydrodynamic limit .",
    "the approach of this paper provides some new tools that are potentially useful for the study of other non - equilibrium systems .",
    "we now give some more details on the discrete approximation of the spatial motions in our modeling .",
    "we approximate @xmath15 by square lattices @xmath16 of side length @xmath8 , and then approximate reflected diffusions on @xmath15 by continuous time random walks ( ctrws ) on @xmath16 .",
    "the rigorous formulation of the particle system is captured by the operator @xmath17 in ( [ e : generator0 ] ) .",
    "let @xmath18 be the position of the particle with index @xmath19 in @xmath20 at time @xmath21 .",
    "we prescribe each particle a mass @xmath22 and consider the normalized empirical measures @xmath23 here @xmath24 stands for the dirac measure concentrated at the point @xmath25 , while @xmath26 if and only if the particle @xmath27 is alive at time @xmath21 , and @xmath28 if and only if the particle @xmath29 is alive at time @xmath21 . for fixed positive integer @xmath5 and @xmath30 , @xmath31 is a random measure on @xmath20 .",
    "we want to study the asymptotic behavior , when @xmath32 ( or equivalently @xmath33 ) , of the evolution in time @xmath21 of the pair @xmath34 .",
    "our first main result ( theorem [ t : conjecture ] ) implies the following .",
    "suppose each particle in @xmath15 is approximating a rbm with gradient drift @xmath35 , where @xmath36 is strictly positive .",
    "then under appropriate assumptions on the initial configuration @xmath37 , the normalized empirical measure @xmath38 converges in distribution to a deterministic measure @xmath39 for all @xmath30 , where @xmath40 is the solution of the following coupled heat equations : @xmath41 and @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the inward unit normal vector field on @xmath44 of @xmath15 and @xmath45 is the indicator function on @xmath3 .",
    "note that @xmath46 corresponds to the particular case when there is no drift .",
    "the above result tells us that for any fixed time @xmath30 , the probability distribution of a randomly picked particle in @xmath16 at time @xmath21 is close to @xmath47 when @xmath5 is large , where @xmath48 is a normalizing constant . in fact , the above convergence holds at the level of the path space .",
    "that is , the full trajectory ( and hence the joint law at different times ) of the particle profile converges to the deterministic scaling limit described by ( [ e : coupledpde:+ ] ) and ( [ e : coupledpde:- ] ) , not only its distribution at a given time .",
    "* question * : how about the limiting joint distribution of more than one particles ?",
    "our second main result ( theorem [ t : correlation ] ) answers this question .",
    "it asserts that * propagation of chaos * holds true for our system ; that is , when the number of particles tends to infinity , their positions appear to be independent of each other .",
    "more precisely , suppose @xmath49 and @xmath50 unlabeled particles in @xmath51 and @xmath52 , respectively , are chosen uniformly among the living particles at time @xmath21 .",
    "then , as @xmath32 , the probability joint density function for their positions converges to @xmath53 uniformly for @xmath54 and for @xmath21 in any compact time interval , where @xmath55 is a normalizing constant",
    ".      a key step in our proof of propagation of chaos ( theorem [ t : correlation ] ) is theorem [ t : uniqueness_hierarchy ] .",
    "the latter establishes uniqueness of solution for the infinite system of equations satisfied by the correlation functions of the particles in the limit @xmath32 .",
    "such infinite system of equations is sometimes called _ bbgky - hierarchy _ in statistical physics .",
    "our bbgky hierarchy involves boundary terms on the interface , which is new to the literature .",
    "our proof of uniqueness involves a representation and manipulations of the hierarchy in terms of trees .",
    "this technique is related to but different from that in @xcite which used feynman diagrams .",
    "it is potentially useful in the study of other stochastic models involving coupled differential equations .",
    "to establish hydrodynamic limit result ( theorem [ t : conjecture ] ) , we employ the classical tightness plus finite dimensional distribution approach .",
    "tightness of @xmath56 in the skorokhod space is proved in theorem [ t : tight ] .",
    "this together with the propagation of chaos result ( theorem [ t : correlation ] ) establishes the hydrodynamic limit of the interacting random walks .",
    "two new tools for discrete approximation of random walks in domains are developed in this article .",
    "namely , the local central limit theorem ( local clt ) for reflected random walk on bounded lipschitz domains ( theorem [ t : lclt_ctrw ] ) and the ` discrete surface measure ' ( lemma [ l : discreteapprox_surfacemea ] ) .",
    "we believe these tools are potentially useful in many discrete schemes which involve reflected brownian motions .    weak convergence of simple random walk on @xmath16 to rbm has been established for general bounded domains in @xcite and @xcite . however , we need more for our model ; namely a local convergence result which guarantees that the convergence rate is uniform up to the boundary .",
    "for this , we establish the local clt .",
    "we further generalize the weak convergence result and the local limit theorem to deal with rbms with gradient drift .",
    "there are two reasons for us to consider gradient drift .",
    "first , it is physically natural to assume the particles are subject to an electric potential .",
    "second , the maximal extension theorem , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.6.9 ) , which is a crucial technical tool used in @xcite and @xcite , has established only in symmetric setting .",
    "the proof of the local clt is based on a ` discrete relative isoperimetric inequality ' ( theorem [ t : isoperimetric_discrete ] ) which leads to the poincar inequality and the nash inequality .",
    "the crucial point is that these two inequalities are uniform in @xmath8 ( scaling of lattice size ) and is invariant under the dilation of the domain @xmath57 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we introduce the stochastic model and some preliminary facts that will be used later .",
    "we then prove the existence and uniqueness of solution for the coupled pde .",
    "the main results , theorem [ t : conjecture ] and theorem [ t : correlation ] , will be rigorously formulated .",
    "we also mention various extensions of our main results in remark [ rk : generalizationresults ] .",
    "section 3 and section 4 contains the proof of theorem [ t : correlation ] and theorem [ t : conjecture ] respectively .",
    "section 5 is devoted to the proofs of the discrete relative isoperimetric inequality and the local clt .",

    "we can now group the terms in each level @xmath63 as a sum of @xmath63 terms to obtain @xmath64 in the last term , we have used the observation that when @xmath65 , the smallest element in @xmath66 is at least 2 and so the sum stops before reaching @xmath67 . from this and the simple estimates like @xmath68",
    "we have derived the following    [ l : i_n_j_n ] @xmath69 where @xmath70      our goal in this section is show that @xmath72 for some @xmath73 .",
    "our proof relies on the following recursion formula pointed out to us by david speyer : @xmath74 we assume ( [ e : recursion_j_n(t ) ] ) for now and use it to establish the following lemma .",
    "the proof of ( [ e : recursion_j_n(t ) ] ) will be given immediately after it .",

    "unfortunately , the largest term is exactly @xmath88 which grows faster than @xmath89 for any @xmath90 .",
    "hence for the upper bound , we will employ the recursion formula ( [ e : recursion_j_n(t ) ] ) .",
    "we apply the homogeneity to the right hand side of ( [ e : recursion_j_n(t ) ] ) to obtain @xmath91 the integrals are now simple one dimensional and can be evaluated : @xmath92    since @xmath93 , we have @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is defined by the recursion @xmath96 with @xmath97 . the generating function",
