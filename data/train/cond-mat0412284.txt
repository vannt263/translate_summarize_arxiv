    "note that in the experimentally most relevant heavy fermion system , orbital effects are strongly suppressed compared to contributions from the zeeman term as the effective masses and magnetic susceptibilities are very large in those systems@xcite .    for simplicity , we assume that the antiferromagnet is commensurate ( incommensurate antiferromagnets show the same qualitative behavior for all quantities discussed below ) and introduce a real order parameter vector @xmath44 as a hubbard - stratonovich field which decouples the spin - density part of the interaction .",

    "<S> a magnetic field applied to a three - dimensional antiferromagnetic metal can destroy the long - range order and thereby induce a quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> such field - induced quantum critical behavior is the focus of many recent experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate theoretically the quantum critical behavior of clean antiferromagnetic metals subject to a static , spatially uniform external magnetic field </S>",
    "<S> . the external field does not only suppress ( or induce in some systems ) antiferromagnetism but also influences the dynamics of the order parameter by inducing spin precession . </S>",
    "<S> this leads to an exactly _ marginal _ correction to spin - fluctuation theory . </S>",
    "<S> we investigate how the interplay of precession and damping determines the specific heat , magnetization , magnetocaloric effect , susceptibility and scattering rates . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that the precession can change the sign of the leading @xmath0 correction to the specific heat coefficient @xmath1 and can induce a characteristic maximum in @xmath1 for certain parameters . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that the susceptibility @xmath2 is the thermodynamic quantity which shows the most significant change upon approaching the quantum critical point and which gives experimental access to the ( dangerously irrelevant ) spin - spin interactions .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of quantum phase transitions is currently a very active field of research in theoretical as well as experimental condensed matter physics . particularly in a large number of metals  mostly heavy fermion or transition metal compounds  </S>",
    "<S> the critical fluctuations associated with a quantum phase transition induce anomalous behavior in thermodynamic and transport quantities like diverging specific heat coefficients or a linear resistivity quite distinct from the behavior of a conventional fermi liquid .    </S>",
    "<S> experimentally there are three main methods to tune a system towards a quantum critical point : doping , pressure , and magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> doping has the disadvantage that it induces disorder and it can not be easily adjusted within a single sample . </S>",
    "<S> these problems are absent if pressure is used as the control parameter of the quantum phase transitions . </S>",
    "<S> however , the presence of a pressure cell makes many experiments difficult . for this reason </S>",
    "<S> , many recent experiments @xcite investigate field - tuned quantum critical behavior , where an external magnetic field is used to control the distance from the quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> generally it is expected that the presence of a magnetic field changes the universality class of the transition as in its presence time reversal invariance is broken . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we will therefore analyze theoretically the quantum critical behavior of a clean itinerant antiferromagnet in three dimensions subject to a static , spatially uniform external magnetic field @xmath3 .    </S>",
    "<S> such a situation has been investigated in a number of experiments@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> for example in cecu@xmath4ag@xmath5 @xcite and cecu@xmath6au@xmath7 @xcite magnetic order can be suppressed by moderate magnetic fields . in these systems the quantum critical behavior induced by a magnetic field @xmath3 appears to be qualitatively different compared to the critical properties for vanishing field ( controlled by pressure or doping ) . in the presence of a field </S>",
    "<S> these systems seem to follow@xcite the predictions from spin - fluctuation theory @xcite for three - dimensional nearly antiferromagnetic metals , while this is not the case for @xmath8 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similarly experiments@xcite in field tuned ybcu@xmath9al@xmath10 appear to be consistent with spin - fluctuation theory , which is not found to be the case in ybrh@xmath11si@xmath11 where magnetic order is suppressed by tiny magnetic fields @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recently , in cecoin@xmath12 @xcite the superconducting order was suppressed by a magnetic field  </S>",
    "<S> it is at the moment a controversial question whether the observed anomalous behavior is related to a superconducting quantum critical point or whether magnetism plays a role in this system .    </S>",
    "<S> another interesting class of systems are _ insulators _ like tlcucl@xmath13 @xcite , srcu@xmath11(bo@xmath13)@xmath11 @xcite or bacusi@xmath11o@xmath14 @xcite where antiferromagnetic order has been _ induced _ by the application of a magnetic field @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> these transitions @xcite can be interpreted as a bose - einstein condensation ( see below ) of spin-1 excitations . </S>",
    "<S> the energy of the `` spin - up '' component of such triplets is lowered by @xmath3 until it condenses at a critical field , @xmath15 , thereby inducing antiferromagnetic order perpendicular to the magnetic field .    </S>",
    "<S> in contrast to classical transitions , the dynamics , i.e.  the temporal quantum fluctuations , of the order parameter determines the nature and universality class of a quantum phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> for example , at the critical point of an insulating antiferromagnet , the dynamics of the order parameter @xmath16 can be described @xcite as in a klein gordon equation @xmath17 . </S>",
    "<S> in such a system , typical frequencies @xmath18 scale linearly with the momentum , @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the dynamical critical exponent . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , in a metal the excitation of particle - hole pairs leads to a landau damping @xcite of the antiferromagnetic order parameter , @xmath21 and therefore @xmath22 . </S>",
    "<S> here we assumed that the ordering vector @xmath23 is sufficiently small , @xmath24 , such that low - energy particle - hole pairs with momentum @xmath23 exist .    </S>",
    "<S> a magnetic field will have two main effects : first it will suppress ( or in some cases@xcite also induce ) magnetic order . </S>",
    "<S> more interesting is the second effect : it induces a precession of the magnetic moments @xmath25 perpendicular to the magnetic field @xmath26 and therefore modifies the dynamics of the order parameter . </S>",
    "<S> the linear time - derivative also translates to a dynamical exponent @xmath22 , and therefore the question arises how the precession competes with damping in a metal , which is characterized by the same @xmath27 . for insulating systems the physics of the precession term </S>",
    "<S> has been widely discussed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding quantum critical behavior as a function of magnetic field of such an insulating magnet in an external field is actually well known : it is expected to be in the same universality class as the quantum phase transition of a low - density interacting bose einstein condensate as a function of chemical potential . </S>",
    "<S> the linear time derivative @xmath28 of the schrdinger equation can in this case be identified with the precession term ( [ precession ] ) , see below .    in the following , </S>",
    "<S> we study the interplay of ohmic damping and spin precession terms in the case of a nearly antiferromagnetic metal . </S>",
    "<S> first we present the model for the order parameter field and a short derivation of the effective action . </S>",
    "<S> then we list the renormalization group equations for the parameters of the model and use them to derive the behavior of the correlation length . in the following sections we calculate the specific heat , thermal expansion , magnetocaloric effect , and susceptibility . </S>",
    "<S> we show for example that sufficiently large magnetic fields can induce sign changes in the critical contribution to the specific heat and that the susceptibility is particularly suited to probe the vicinity of the quantum critical point . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we investigate the influence of the @xmath3-field on the scattering rate of the electrons . </S>"
