    "the search for physics beyond the standard model has one of its most promising leads in neutrinoless double - beta decay ( ) in particular , and neutrino physics more generally .",
    "interest in  is extremely well - motivated in the literature @xcite .",
    "there are approximately 10 isotopes known to undergo two - neutrino double beta decay ( , _ i.e. _ @xmath2 ) , the slowest nuclear decay allowed in the standard model .",
    "these are also the isotopes of interest in the search for  ( _ i.e. _ @xmath3 ) , a  mode forbidden by the standard model .",
    "if observed ,  would imply the existence of massive majorana neutrinos@xcite and could also lead to the discovery of other physics beyond the standard model .",
    "if  could be measured in several isotopes , it would do much to elucidate this physics @xcite . to make a meaningful comparison between  measurements in several isotopes , the total experimental uncertainty must be sufficiently low .",
    "this places significant demands on the size of systematic uncertainties of the global experimental program .",
    "the importance of systematic uncertainties in potential results of  searches motivates the investigation of systematic uncertainties in pulse shape analysis ( psa ) presented here .",
    "is one of the  isotopes under investigation in the current generation of  searches ( the most stringent  limits already come from ) , and there are two next - generation experiments currently under development : @xcite and gerda @xcite .",
    "this article will present work performed in support of the  experiment . both  and gerda , as well as all  searches ( and indeed all searches for rare events ) , rely heavily on reducing backgrounds while retaining signals as effectively as possible .",
    "one of the ways that both experiments plan to reduce background and identify signal events is through psa on the array of high - purity germanium ( hpge ) detectors that will comprise the experiments . because of the inherent complexity of making pulse shape cuts , systematic uncertainties in psa - cut efficacy could be one of the leading contributors to the total systematic uncertainty budget of these experiments .",
    "an examination of these systematic uncertainties is the primary focus of this article .",
    "we will begin with a description of the detector used in this work , then move on to an overview of the use of psa in hpge detectors for  searches up to and including this article .",
    "we will then detail our survey of systematic effects on psa , and close with some discussion of the context of this work in the  experiment .",
    "the data presented in this article were taken using a clover detector at los alamos national laboratory .",
    "a clover is a commercially available detector system from canberra @xcite , consisting of four , n - type detectors in a single cryostat .",
    "the detectors in the clover used in this study had two - fold azimuthal segmentation .",
    "these characteristics make the clover a good off - the - shelf test bed for potential analysis techniques for .",
    "the individual detectors have a relative efficiency of 26% , this corresponding to a mass of roughly 750 g per detector .",
    "the clover is instrumented with four high - resolution , cold - fet energy readouts ( one for the central contact of each detector ) , and three low - resolution , warm - fet position readouts ( corresponding to the left two , middle four and right two segments of the detector ",
    "see figure [ fig : clovercartoon ] ) .",
    "coincidences between the energy and position readouts tell us which segment(s ) recorded energy depositions .",
    "all four detectors share a common bias and preamplifier power .",
    "all contacts on the clover were read out with a pair of dgf4c `` digital gamma finder '' digitizer cards from x - ray instrument associates ( xia)@xcite .",
    "these boards operate under a computer automated measurement and control ( camac ) architecture , and sample at 40 mhz ( 25 ns per sample ) with a 14-bit analog to digital converter ( adc ) .",
    "oversampling allows an effective resolution in the dgf4c boards of 16 bits .",
    "the data sets described in this paper fall into either `` calibration sets '' ( used to calibrate the psa algorithms ) and `` characterization sets '' ( used to characterize the efficacy of different event classes under psa ) . for each individual systematic study ,",
    "the characterization and calibration data sets were taken under identical hardware triggering and event selection conditions .",
    "the lack of neutrinos in the final state of  means that the only particles to carry away the available kinetic energy (  = 2039.04 kev for @xcite ) are the two electrons .",
    "this pair of electrons will have a very limited range in germanium compared to backgrounds near , such as multiple compton scatters from higher energy @xmath0 rays .",
    "most backgrounds near  will tend to produce interaction locations separated by up to several centimeters in germanium , allowing them to spread over a much larger volume and even across several detectors .",
    "events on the other hand will tend to stop in the hpge detector in which they originated , depositing all their kinetic energy with high efficiency .",
    "therefore , the signature of  is a spatially localized ( _ i.e. _ single - site ) event with a well - defined energy ( ) , uncorrelated in time with any other event in the data stream .",
    "pulse shape analysis , like most of the background tagging techniques employed in  experiments , exploits the single - site nature of the signal and the multi - site nature of most backgrounds of similar energy .",
    "psa tends to only be performed only on single - detector events , because any multi - detector event is clearly multi - site .",
    "nearly all psa methods rely on digitized waveforms from the detector(s ) ( some techniques can be implemented only with analog electronics ) .",
    "the waveforms analyzed here are recorded from the output of the integrating preamplifiers of the detector system .",
    "we refer to such a waveform as a `` charge pulse . ''",
    "many psa algorithms also analyze the `` current pulse '' of an event rather than the charge pulse .",
    "one can extract the current pulse by simply taking the time derivative of the charge pulse .",
    "most psa cut algorithms must first be calibrated on data containing known single and multi - site events , during which the calibration software associates typical waveform characteristics with each class of events ( single and multi - site ) . for calibration data",
    ", we primarily used the full - energy @xmath0-ray peak at 1588 kev from for our population of multi - site events and the 1592-kev double escape peak ( dep ) of the 2614-kev @xmath0 ray from for our population of single - site events .",
    "dep events occur when a @xmath0-ray of sufficiently high energy undergoes electron - positron pair production in a detector , and both 511-kev @xmath0 rays ( created after the positron stops and annihilates ) escape the detector without depositing any energy .",
    "dep events are single - site because the only particles depositing energy in the detector of interest are charged leptons with a short range .",
    "double escape peaks are described in more detail in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* chapter 12 ) .",
    "both the 1588-kev @xmath0-ray line and 1592-kev dep are part of the decay chain , making it operationally simple to collect both simultaneously .",
    "has become something of a standard source in the examination of psa in hpge detectors because its decay chain has a relatively high - energy @xmath0 ray at 2614 kev ( giving a double - escape peak at 1592 kev ) , coupled with a spectrum otherwise free of strong lines above @xmath4 kev .",
    "for some studies , we used the 1771-kev @xmath0 ray and one of the several dep peaks available in the spectrum of .",
    "although has several high - energy @xmath0 rays up to 3600 kev , giving dep lines from 1600 to 2600 kev , spanning  for , these @xmath0-ray lines also lead to a strong compton continuum in this region , meaning that dep events can be hard to separate from continuum events for the purpose of psa calibration . also has a relatively short half - life ( 77.27 days ) , meaning that sources must be replaced rather frequently . for these reasons ,",
    "tends to be favored for calibration most psa algorithms . throughout this article",
    "we will refer to `` dep events '' and `` @xmath0-ray events '' as those selected by making energy cuts on these features in either spectrum .",
    "the reverse of the techniques used in  searches ( _ i.e. _ rejecting single - site events while accepting multi - site events ) could have potential applications to searches for rare nuclear decays to excited states , by allowing for the separation of weak @xmath0-ray lines from a strong continuum .",
    "psa was used to varying degrees in both of the previous generation searches for  in : the international germanium experiment ( igex)@xcite and the heidelberg - moscow experiment ( hm ) @xcite .",
    "psa in the hm experiment is discussed in reference ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.2 ) .",
    "the psa work presented in this article is largely an extension of the psa work done in support of the igex experiment , which is discussed at greater length in references @xcite",
    ". our psa uses parameters calculated from the charge and current pulses to quantify the single and multi - site nature of events from hpge detectors .",
    "the way in which an algorithm associates single or multi - site events with numerical values of these parameters represents one of the key differences between parametric psa algorithms .",
    "this is true of the changes in psa from references @xcite to @xcite to that presented here .",
    "the igex experiment used three pulse shape parameters :    * pulse width ( defined as the time it took for the charge pulse to rise from 10% to 90% of its full amplitude ) , * front - back asymmetry ( defined as the difference in the area of the first and second halves of the current pulse , normalized by the total area of the current pulse ) , and * normalized moment ( defined essentially as the moment of inertia of the current pulse , were it treated as a mass distribution  see reference @xcite for the exact form ) .",
    "the igex psa algorithm was calibrated by creating a three - dimensional histogram of these parameters from a set of dep events .",
    "the fraction of the total number of calibration events in each bin was then calculated .",
    "the bins of that histogram were rank ordered by that fraction , and stepping down the list , the cumulative fraction of the total number of events in the list was calculated for each element ( so that the first element would have only the fraction of events in the most heavily - populated bin and the last element would have all of them ) .",
    "a cut was then made at an element on this list so that some nominal fraction ( 80% in most cases ) of calibration events were preserved .",
    "this defined the signal space for the cut . when production data was later analyzed and its pulse shape parameters calculated , the analysis software checked which bin in the three - dimensional psa parameter histogram each pulse occupied .",
    "if that bin was in the signal space , it passed the cut .",
    "this method was modified for the preparation of reference @xcite .",
    "the detectors in the clover are much smaller than those used in igex ( @xmath5 kg versus @xmath6 kg ) . as a result , there as little difference in drift times from different regions of the individual clover detectors , so the pulse width was largely degenerate between known single and multi - site events .",
    "reference @xcite therefore used only the second two parameters listed above .",
    "the calibration software created two - dimensional histograms for both @xmath0 rays and deps from a 25%-subset of the characterization data .",
    "a fit was then performed to the parameter space histogram for each detector using a complicated analytical model ( a sum of many two - dimensional gaussian and lorentzian functions ) .",
    "both fit functions were then normalized so that their integral over the parameter space was one , allowing for their treatment as probability density functions ( pdfs )",
    ". when the full characterization data set was analyzed , the analysis software calculated the parameters for each pulse , and the pdf ( fit function ) for that detector was evaluated at those parameter values . if the pdf from the dep ( @xmath0 ray ) data had the higher value , then the event in question was classified as single-(multi-)site and passed ( failed ) the psa cut .    the psa algorithm from reference @xcite",
    "was further modified for this work . here , we calibrated the psa algorithm with a data set completely independent of the characterization data ( we did quantify the bias resulting from different amounts of overlap in between the calibration and characterization data  see section [ sec : calibrationdata ] of this article for more detail ) .",
    "we also did away with the complicated fit described above .",
    "instead , we simply normalized the psa parameter histograms for dep and @xmath0-ray events from each detector so that their integral was one , treating them as a pdf .",
    "the analysis of characterization data was then performed by checking the value of the pdf histograms corresponding to the pulse shape parameter values for each characterization event .",
    "because a clover detector is actually a four - detector array , we could select calibration deps in two different ways : one in which we made a simple energy cut in the single - detector spectra , and another in which we looked for two - detector events with the dep energy in one detector , and one of the two @xmath7 annihilation @xmath0 rays in another .",
    "the coincidence tag severely limits the number of deps available for calibration but also provides a very clean population .",
    "most of the results presented in this article were made with single - detector , energy cut - selected deps .",
    "psa calibration @xmath0-rays were always selected with a single detector cut .",
    "when both analyses are presented , the pdf constructed with non - coincidence tagged deps is denoted with a subscript `` nc '' ( for `` no coincidence '' ) .",
    "figure [ fig : psakeycomp ] shows surface and contour plots of the pdf histograms for single - detector dep and @xmath0-ray events .    a zoomed - in view of the pdf histograms from data , populated with 1592-kev dep ( left ) and 1588-kev @xmath0-ray ( right ) events .",
    "the contour plots are also shown at top of both plots . ]",
    "we could have also tagged deps by demanding three - detector events : dep in one detector , plus both @xmath7 annihilation @xmath0 rays in other detectors .",
    "this would have provided an even cleaner population of calibration deps , but the efficiency for capturing such events in our array is impractically low for this study .    to evaluate the efficacy of different implementations of psa in this article , we examine the ratio of the number of events which pass the psa cut to the number of events on which the cut is performed , defining this as the survival probability .",
    "survival probabilities were calculated for three different event classes : the dep and @xmath0-ray events discussed above and compton continuum events near  for .",
    "understanding the survival probability of compton continuum events is important because they represent the most likely backgrounds to experiments like . for continuum events , calculating the number of events in the pre and post - psa cut spectra is simply an exercise in counting the number of events in an energy region . in this study ,",
    "the region was either 2.02.08 mev for the runs ( @xmath8 kev on either side of ) , or 2.042.08 mev for the source runs .",
    "the narrower energy region allowed the analysis to avoid the @xmath0-ray lines at 2015 and 2035 kev in the spectrum .",
    "the statistical uncertainties are then just those arising from poisson fluctuations . for peaks on top of continua , the situation is more complicated , because we need to separate out the strength of the peak from that of the continuum on which it rests .",
    "we do so by performing a standard @xmath9 fit in the root framework @xcite . in this case , the fit model is a flat background plus a gaussian peak ( or two , if multiple peaks reside near each other  this is the case for the 1588-kev @xmath0-ray peak and 1592-kev dep ) . to extract a peak s strength ,",
    "we calculate its area from the fit parameters .",
    "the area uncertainty comes from that for the fit parameters and the expression for the area of a gaussian using standard error propagation techniques .",
    "we can then take the ratio of these pre and post - psa cut peak areas to calculate the survival probability for that cut .",
    "we again propagate uncertainty through the expression to obtain the survival probability uncertainty . throughout this article , this is referred to as the `` fit uncertainty . ''",
    "all uncertainties presented are one - sigma , rather than another confidence interval .      in table",
    "[ tab : psasegeff ] , we present nominal values for the survival probability of pulse shape analysis cuts for @xmath0-ray , dep , and continuum events along with total uncertainties ( fit / statistical plus systematic ) . if the psa algorithm worked perfectly and the different event classes had no overlap in the range of their pulse shape parameter distributions , the survival probability for dep ( @xmath0-ray ) events would have a survival probability of 100% ( 0% ) .",
    ".[tab : psasegeff ] psa survival probabilities for different processes over a range of energy including systematic uncertainties detailed in section [ sec : sysunc ] .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     summing the effects in table [ tab : psasyssum ] in quadrature ( thereby neglecting any potential correlations in these effects ) , we arrive at a total uncertainty of 1.9% for @xmath0 rays and 2.5% for deps and 0.7% for continuum events .",
    "fractionally ( that is , normalized to the survival probability for each event class ) , this comes to 6.6% , 3.8% and 1.5% respectively .",
    "reference @xcite sets a goal for total uncertainty budgets required to extract information about the mechanism underlying  at roughly 20% to 50% , depending on the number of  measurements and model space of  mechanisms considered .",
    "we can see that the fractional uncertainties in psa performance will not be a major driver of that total uncertainty budget , but should nevertheless be kept as low as possible to increase confidence in the psa algorithm .",
    "it is also important to note that the psa performance demonstrated in this article used standard coaxial hpge detectors read out with digitizers based on rather old technology .",
    "current plans for data acquisition for the  experiment include digitizers which sample at 100 mhz ( as opposed to 40 mhz for the dgf4c boards used here ) .",
    "digitizers will also communicate over vme rather than camac architecture , thus avoiding the backplane throughput problems encountered here .",
    "the  collaboration also plans to field p - type point contact ( ppc ) detectors in its demonstrator phase@xcite .",
    "these detectors have been superior noise performance and excellent psa discrimination power@xcite .",
    "the  collaboration has already begun purchasing `` broad - energy germanium '' detectors ( a particular style of ppc detector ) from canberra for deployment in the demonstrator .",
    "the use of these detectors in lieu of standard semi - coaxial detectors as well as fielding more sophisticated digitization electronics should substantially improve psa discrimination of the  experiment over what has been shown here .",
    "much of this and previous work on psa in germanium - based  searches has focused on the notion of reducing backgrounds using psa , but that is not the primary way in which the next generation of  searches will exceed the sensitivity of the previous one . enhanced sensitivity for future  searches will be achieved primarily by building larger experiments out of cleaner materials , whereas novel analysis techniques will contribute to background reduction at a subdominant level .",
    "it is true however , that all analysis techniques employed in future  searches will be examined for systematic uncertainties using a process similar to the one outlined in this article",
    ". this will be particularly important if several positive detections are made in several isotopes and the community undertakes a global  analysis like the one in reference @xcite .",
    "we used dep and @xmath0-ray events as sample single and multi - site events , and quoting survival probabilities that are roughly a factor of two to three different between the two classes of events .",
    "it is far more likely that background events near  will be compton continuum events , and psa ( as well as most other background identification techniques ) will not work as effectively on them .",
    "the  sensitivity for an experiment is inversely proportional to the square root of the background level , given the same level of exposure ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 4.6 ) . reducing a background to 40% of its initial value ( commensurate with the psa efficacy for continuum events demonstrated here ) would correspond to an increase in sensitivity of only around 60% ( @xmath10 ) .",
    "even if the combination of many techniques resulted in a factor of 1020 reduction in background , this would correspond only to a roughly four - fold increase in  sensitivity . while that level of impact on an experimental program is certainly not negligible , it is not the sole reason that the next generation  searches should go to great lengths to tag backgrounds . another _",
    "extremely _ important reason to identify background events , is to demonstrate the single - site nature of any potential signal seen at or near .",
    "this would do much to identify that peak as  and not some hitherto unidentified background to a much higher degree of certainty .",

    "<S> pulse shape analysis is an important background reduction and signal identification technique for next generation of  experiments . </S>",
    "<S> we present a study of the systematic uncertainties in one such parametric pulse - shape analysis technique for separating multi - site background from single - site signal events . </S>",
    "<S> we examined systematic uncertainties for events in full - energy gamma peaks ( predominantly multi - site ) , double - escape peaks ( predominantly single - site ) and the compton continuum near  ( which will be the dominant background for most  searches ) . </S>",
    "<S> in short , we find total ( statistical plus systematic ) _ fractional _ uncertainties in the pulse shape cut survival probabilities of : 6.6% , 1.5% and 3.8% for double - escape , continuum and @xmath0-ray events respectively .    </S>",
