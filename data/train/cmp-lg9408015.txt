    "a common assumption in work on collaborative problem solving is that interaction should be efficient . when language is the mode of interaction , the measure of efficiency has been , in the main , the number of utterances required to complete the dialogue @xcite .",
    "one problem with this efficiency measure is that it ignores the cognitive effort required by resource limited agents in collaborative problem solving .",
    "another problem is that an utterance - based efficiency measure shows no sensitivity to the required quality and robustness of the problem solution .",
    "cognitive effort is involved in processes such as making inferences and swapping items from long term memory into working memory .",
    "when agents have limited working memory , then only a limited number of items can be salient , i.e. accessible in working memory .",
    "since other processes , e.g. inference , operate on salient items , an inference process may require the cognitive effort involved with retrieving items from long term memory , in addition to the effort involved with reasoning itself .",
    "the required quality and robustness of the problem solution often determines exactly how much cognitive effort is required .",
    "this means that a resource - limited agent may do well on some tasks but not on others @xcite .",
    "for example , consider constraint - based tasks where it is difficult for an agent to simultaneously keep all the constraints in mind , or inference - based tasks that require a long deductive chain or the retrieval of multiple premises , where an agent may not be able to simultaneously access all of the required premises .",
    "furthermore , contrary to the efficiency hypothesis , analyses of problem - solving dialogues shows that human agents in dialogue engage in apparently inefficient conversational behavior .",
    "for example , naturally - occurring dialogues often include utterances that realize facts that are already mutually believed , or that would be mutually believed if agents were logically omniscient @xcite .",
    "consider -26a , which repeats information given in -20 @xmath0 -23 :    utterances such as -26a , that repeat , paraphrase or make inferences explicit , are collectively called informationally redundant utterances , irus . in , the utterances that originally added the belief that _ they will get 400 dollars _ to the context are in _ italics _ and the iru is given in caps .    about 12% of the utterances in a corpus of 55 naturally - occurring problem - solving dialogues were irus @xcite , but the occurrence of irus contradicts fundamental assumptions of many theories of communication @xcite , _",
    "inter alia_. the hypothesis that is investigated in this paper is that irus such as -26a are related to agents limited attentional and inferential capacity and reflect the fact that beliefs must be salient to be used in deliberation and inference .",
    "hence apparently redundant information serves an important cognitive function .    in order to test the hypothesized relationship of communicative strategies to agents resource limits we developed a test - bed environment , design - world , in which we vary task requirements , agents resources and communicative strategies .",
    "our artificial agents are based on a cognitive model of attention and memory .",
    "our experimental results show that communicative strategies that incorporate irus can help resource - limited cognitive agents coordinate , limit processing , and improve the quality and robustness of the problem solution .",
    "we will show that the task determines whether a communicative strategy is beneficial , depending on how the task is defined in terms of fault intolerance and the level of belief coordination required .",
    "the design - world task consists of two agents who carry out a dialogue in order to come to an agreement on a furniture layout design for a two room house @xcite .",
    "figure [ final - state - fig ] shows a potential final plan constructed as a result of a dialogue .",
    "the agents shared intention is to design the house , which requires two subparts of designing room-1 ( the study ) and designing room-2 ( the living room ) .",
    "a room design consists of four intentions to put a furniture item into the room .",
    "each furniture item has a color and point value , which provides the basis for calculating the utility of a put - act involving that furniture item .",
    "agents start with private beliefs about the furniture items they have and their colors .",
    "beliefs about which furniture items exist and how many points they are worth are mutual .",
    "the agent architecture for deliberation and means - end reasoning is based on the irma architecture , also used in the tileworld simulation environment @xcite , with the addition of a model of limited attention / working memory , awm .",
    "see figure [ irma - fig ] .",
    "the attention / working memory model , awm , is adapted from @xcite .",
    "while the awm model is extremely simple , landauer showed that it could be parameterized to fit many empirical results on human memory and learning @xcite .",
    "awm consists of a three dimensional space in which propositions acquired from perceiving the world are stored in chronological sequence according to the location of a moving memory pointer .",
    "the sequence of memory loci used for storage constitutes a random walk through memory with each loci a short distance from the previous one . if items are encountered multiple times , they are stored multiple times @xcite .",
    "when an agent retrieves items from memory , search starts from the current pointer location and spreads out in a spherical fashion .",
    "search is restricted to a particular search radius : radius is defined in hamming distance .",
    "for example if the current memory pointer loci is ( 0 0 0 ) , the loci distance 1 away would be ( 0 1 0 ) ( 0 -1 0 ) ( 0 0 1 ) ( 0 0 -1 ) ( -1 0 0 ) ( 1 0 0 ) .",
    "the actual locations are calculated modulo the memory size .",
    "the limit on the search radius defines the capacity of attention / working memory and hence defines which stored beliefs and intentions are salient .",
    "the radius of the search sphere in the awm model is used as the parameter for design - world agents resource - bound on attentional capacity . in the experiments below , memory is 16x16x16 and the radius parameter varies between 1 and 16 , where awm of 1 gives severely attention limited agents and awm of 16 means that everything an agent knows is salient .",
    "the advantages of the awm model is that it was shown to reproduce , in simulation , many results on human memory and learning . because search starts from the current pointer location ,",
    "items that have been stored most recently are more likely to be retrieved , predicting recency effects @xcite .",
    "because items that are stored in multiple locations are more likely to be retrieved , the model predicts frequency effects @xcite .",
    "because items are stored in chronological sequence , the model produces natural associativity effects @xcite .",
    "because deliberation and means - end reasoning can only operate on salient beliefs , limited attention produces a concomitant inferential limitation , i.e. if a belief is not salient it can not be used in deliberation or means - end - reasoning .",
    "this means that mistakes that agents make in their planning process have a plausible cognitive basis .",
    "agents can both fail to access a belief that would allow them to produce an optimal plan , as well as make a mistake in planning if a belief about how the world has changed as a result of planning is not salient .",
    "a communicative strategy is a strategy for communicating with another agent , which varies according to the agents initiative , amount of information about the task , degree of resource - bounds , and communication style @xcite .",
    "design - world agents communicate with an artificial language whose primitive communicative acts are propose , accept , reject , say .",
    "these primitive acts can be composed to produce higher level discourse acts such as proposals , acceptances , rejections , openings and closings @xcite .",
    "see figure [ dial - stat - fig ] .",
    "a discourse act may be left implicit , or may be varied to consist of one or more communicative acts .",
    "discourse acts are different from actions on the environment because they are actions whose intended effect is a change in the other agent s mental state . because the other agent is an active intelligence , it is possible for it to supplement an underspecified discourse action with its own processing .",
    "the variation in the degree of explicitness of a discourse act is the basis of agents communicative strategies . here",
    "we will compare three communicative strategies : ( 1 ) all - implicit ; ( 2 ) close - consequence ; and ( 3 ) explicit - warrant .",
    "the all - implicit strategy is a ` bare bones ' strategy , exemplified by the partial dialogue in . in each utterance",
    "is shown both as a gloss in _ italics _ , and in the artificial language that the agents communicate with .    in design - world , unlike tileworld , an option that is generated via means - end reasoning or from proposals of other agents only becomes an intention if it is accepted by both agents .",
    "see figure [ dial - stat - fig ] . in dialogue",
    ", bill makes a proposal in 1 , and then kim implicitly accepts this proposal with a new proposal in 2 . in -3 bill rejects kim s proposal and makes a counter - proposal .",
    "the content of communicative acts are beliefs and ( potential ) intentions .",
    "dialogue illustrates part of the cycle for achieving a design - house plan : ( 1 ) individual agents means - end reason about options in the domain ; ( 2 ) individual agents deliberate about which options are preferable ; ( 3 ) then agents make proposals to other agents , based on the options identified in a reasoning cycle , about actions that contribute to the satisfaction of their intentions ; ( 4 ) then these proposals are accepted or rejected by the other agent , or acceptance / rejection is postponed by asking for more information",
    ". see figure [ irma - fig ] .",
    "deliberating whether to accept or reject a proposal is based on beliefs about the proposed action s utility @xcite .",
    "agents parameterized with the all - implicit strategy do not include irus in any discourse act or produce any discourse acts labelled as potentially implicit in figure [ dial - stat - fig ] .",
    "agents parameterized with the close - consequence and explicit - warrant strategies include irus at dialogue segment closings and in proposals .",
    "in dialogue agent clc uses the close - consequence strategy .",
    "clc makes explicit closing statements , such as -2 , on the completion of the intention associated with a discourse segment .",
    "clc s closing discourse act also includes irus as in -3 ; clc makes the inference explicit that since they have agreed on putting the green rug in the study , bill no longer has the green rug ( act - effect inference ) .",
    "the close - consequence strategy of making inferences explicit at the close of a segment is intended to parallel the naturally occurring example in [ so-400-examp ] . in both cases",
    "an inference is made explicit that follows from what has just been said , and the inference is sequentially located at the close of a discourse segment .    the explicit - warrant strategy varies the proposal discourse act by including warrant irus in each proposal . in general",
    "a warrant for an intention is a reason for adopting the intention , and here warrants are the score propositions that give the utility of the proposal , which are mutually believed at the outset of the dialogues . in , the warrant iru is in caps .",
    "since warrants are used by the other agent in deliberation , the explicit - warrant strategy can save the other agent the processing involved with determining which facts are relevant for deliberation and retrieving them from memory .",
    "the explicit - warrant strategy also occurs in natural dialogues @xcite .",
    "design - world supports the parameterization of the task so that it can be made more difficult to perform by making greater processing demands on the agents .",
    "these task variations will be shown to interact with variations in communicative strategies and attentional capacity in section [ results - sec ] .",
    "[ task - eval - fig ]      the standard task is defined so that the raw score that agents achieve for a design - house plan , constructed via the dialogue , is the sum of all the furniture items for each valid step in their plan .",
    "the point values for invalid steps in the plan are simply subtracted from the score so that agents are not heavily penalized for making mistakes .",
    "the zero - invalids task is a fault - intolerant version of the task in which any invalid intention invalidates the whole plan . in general",
    ", the effect of making a mistake in a plan depends on how interdependent different subparts of the problem solution are .",
    "figure [ task - eval - inval - fig ] shows the choices for the effect of invalid steps for the design - world task .",
    "the score for invalid steps ( mistakes ) can just be subtracted out ; this is how the standard task is defined .",
    "alternately , invalid steps can propagate up so that an invalid put - act means that the design - room plan is invalid .",
    "finally , mistakes can completely propagate so that the design - house plan is invalid if one step is invalid , as in the zero - invalids task .",
    "the zero - nonmatching - beliefs task is designed to investigate the effect of the level of agreement that agents must achieve .",
    "figure [ task - eval - fig ] illustrates different degrees of agreeing in a collaborative task , e.g. agents may agree on the actions to be done , but not agree on the * reasons * for intending that action .",
    "the zero - nonmatching - beliefs task is defined so that a warrant w , a reason for doing p , must be mutually supposed .",
    "we wish to evaluate the relative benefits of the communicative strategies in various tasks for a range of resource limits . in section [ task - def - effect - sec ]",
    "we defined an objective performance measure for the design - house plan for each task variation .",
    "we must also take cognitive costs into account . because cognitive effort can vary according to the communication situation and the agent architecture ,",
    "performance evaluation introduces three additional parameters : ( 1 ) commcost : cost of sending a message ; ( 2 ) infcost : cost of inference ; and ( 3 ) retcost : cost of retrieval from memory :    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ [ cols= \" < \" , ]    _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _    we simulate 100 dialogues at each parameter setting and calculate the normalized performance distributions for each sample run . in the results to follow , commcost , infcost and retcost are fixed at 1,1 , .01 respectively , and the parameters that are varied are ( 1 ) communication strategy ; ( 2 ) task definition ; and ( 3 ) awm settings .",
    "differences in the performance distributions for each set of parameters are evaluated for significance over the 100 dialogues using the kolmogorov - smirnov ( ks ) two sample test @xcite .    a strategy a is defined to be beneficial as compared to a strategy b , for a set of fixed parameter settings ,",
    "if the difference in distributions using the kolmogorov - smirnov two sample test is significant at p @xmath1 .05 , in the positive direction , for two or more awm settings .",
    "a strategy is detrimental if the differences go in the negative direction .",
    "strategies may be neither beneficial or detrimental , since there may be no difference between two strategies .",
    "a difference plot such as that in figure [ cost - clc - kim - fig ] will be used to summarize a comparison of strategy 1 and strategy 2 . in the comparisons below , strategy 1",
    "is either close - consequence or explicit - warrant and strategy 2 is the all - implicit strategy .",
    "* differences * in performance between two strategies are plotted on the y - axis against awm parameter settings on the x - axis .",
    "each point in the plot represents the difference in the means of 100 runs of each strategy at a particular awm setting .",
    "these plots summarize the information from 18 performance distributions ( 1800 simulated dialogues ) .",
    "every simulation run varies the awm radius from 1 to 16 to test whether a strategy only has an effect at particular awm settings .",
    "if the plot is above the dotted line for 2 or more awm settings , then strategy 1 may be beneficial , depending on whether the differences are significant .    in the reminder of this section , we first compare within strategy , for each task definition and",
    "show that whether or not a strategy is beneficial depends on the task .",
    "then we compare across strategies for a particular task , showing that the interaction of the strategy and task varies according to the strategy .",
    "the comparisons will show that what counts as a good collaborative strategy depends on cognitive limits on attention and the definition of success for the task .",
    "the difference plot in figure [ cost - clc - kim - fig ] shows that close - consequence is detrimental in the standard task at awm of 1 @xmath0 5 ( ks @xmath2 0.19 , p @xmath1 .05 ) .",
    "in contrast , if the task is the fault - intolerant zero - invalids task , then the close - consequence strategy is beneficial .",
    "figure [ clc - inval - fig ] demonstrates that strategies which include consequence irus can increase the robustness of the planning process by decreasing the frequency with which agents make mistakes ( ks for awm of 3 to 6 @xmath2 .19 , p @xmath1 .05 ) .",
    "this is a direct result of * rehearsing * the act - effect inferences , making it unlikely that attention - limited agents will forget that they have already used a furniture item .",
    "figure [ clc - nmb - fig ] shows that the close - consequence strategy is detrimental when the task requires agents to achieve matching beliefs on the warrants for their intentions ( ks 1,3 ) @xmath2 0.3 , p @xmath1 .01 ) .",
    "this is because irus displace other facts from awm . in this case",
    "agents forget the scores of furniture pieces under consideration , which are the warrants for their intentions .",
    "thus here , as elsewhere , we see that irus can be detrimental by making agents forget critical information .",
    "figure [ ret - iei - fig ] shows that explicit - warrant is beneficial in the standard task at awm values of 3 and above . here",
    ", the scores improve because the beliefs necessary for deliberating the proposal are made available in the current context with each proposal ( ks for awm of 3 and above @xmath2 .23 , p @xmath1 .01 ) , so that agents do nt have to search memory for them . at awm",
    "parameter settings of 16 , where agents can search a huge belief space for beliefs to be used as warrants , the saving in processing time is substantial .    when the task is zero - invalid ( no figure due to space ) , the benefits of the explicit - warrant strategy are dampened from the benefits of the standard task , because explicit - warrant does nothing to address the reasons for agents making mistakes .",
    "in comparison with the all - implicit strategy , it is detrimental at awm of 1 and 2 , but is still beneficial at awm of 5,6,7 , and 11 .",
    "in contrast to close - consequence , the explicit - warrant strategy is highly beneficial when the task is zero - nonmatching - beliefs , see figure [ iei - nmb - fig ] ( ks @xmath2 .23 for awm from 2 to 11 , p @xmath1 .01 ) .",
    "when agents must agree on the warrants underlying their intentions , including these warrants with proposals is a good strategy even if the agent already knows the warrants .",
    "this is due to agents resource limits , which means that retrieval is indeterminate and that there are costs associated with retrieving warrants from memory . at high",
    "awm the differences between the two strategies are small .",
    "design - world was inspired by the tileworld simulation environment : a rapidly changing robot world in which an artificial agent attempts to optimize reasoning and planning @xcite .",
    "tileworld is a single agent world in which the agent interacts with its environment , rather than with another agent .",
    "design - world uses similar methods to test a theory of the effect of resource limits on communicative behavior between two agents .",
    "the belief reasoning mechanism of design - world agents was informed by the theory of belief revision and the multi - agent simulation environment developed in the automated librarian project @xcite . the communicative acts and",
    "discourse acts used by design - world agents are similar to those used in @xcite .",
    "design - world is also based on the method used in carletta s jam simulation for the edinburgh map - task @xcite .",
    "jam is based on the map - task dialogue corpus , where the goal of the task is for the planning agent , the instructor , to instruct the reactive agent , the instructee , how to get from one place to another on the map .",
    "jam focuses on efficient strategies for recovery from error and parametrizes agents according to their communicative and error recovery strategies .",
    "given good error recovery strategies , carletta argues that ` high risk ' strategies are more efficient , where efficiency is a measure of the number of utterances in the dialogue .",
    "while the focus here is different , we have shown that that the number of utterances is just one parameter for evaluating performance , and that the task definition determines when strategies are effective .",
    "in this paper we showed that collaborative communicative behavior can not be defined in the abstract : what counts as collaborative depends on the task , and the definition of success in the task .",
    "we used two empirical methods to support our argument : corpus based analysis and experimentation in design - world .",
    "the methods and the focus of this work are novel ; previous work on resource limited agents has not examined the role of communicative strategies in multi - agent interaction whereas work on communication has not considered the effects of resource limits .",
    "we showed that strategies that are inefficient under assumptions of perfect reasoners with unlimited attention and retrieval are effective with resource limited agents .",
    "furthermore , different tasks make different cognitive demands , and place different requirements on agents collaborative behavior .",
    "tasks which require a high level of belief coordination can benefit from communicative strategies that include redundancy .",
    "fault intolerant tasks benefit from redundancy for rehearsing the effects of actions .",
    "because the communicative strategies that we tested were based on a corpus analysis of human human financial advice dialogues and because variations in the design - world task were parametrized , we believe the results presented here may be domain independent , though clearly more research is needed .    here",
    "we fixed the parameters for the cost of communication , inference and retrieval , only discussed a few of the implemented discourse strategies , and did nt discuss design - world parameters that increase the inferential complexity of the task and that limit inferential processing .",
    "elsewhere we show that : ( 1 ) when retrieval is free or when communication cost is high , that the explicit - warrant strategy is detrimental at low awm @xcite ; ( 2 ) some iru strategies are only beneficial when inferential complexity is higher than in the standard task @xcite ; ( 3 ) irus that make inferences explicit can help inference limited agents perform as well as logically omniscient ones @xcite .",
    "one ramification of the results presented here is that experimental environments for testing agent architectures should support task variation @xcite .",
    "furthermore the task variation should test aspects of the interaction of the agents involved .",
