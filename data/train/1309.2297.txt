    "however , even in this case , if the lightest chargino is above @xmath19 gev , only a moderate contribution to the @xmath18 partial width is achieved .",
    "for example , with @xmath36 , @xmath37 gev , we obtain the chargino mass eigenvalues @xmath38 gev and an enhancement in the @xmath39 rate of @xmath40 from eq .",
    "( [ rgamma - let ] ) . in this case ,",
    "the lightest chargino is just above the lep limit of @xmath41 gev assuming the decay @xmath42 and r - parity conservation resulting in a stable neutralino @xmath43 .",
    "this is the maximum enhancement possible for charginos heavier than the lep bound , and the effect decreases dramatically as the lightest chargino mass is raised and as @xmath44 is increased .",
    "we now relax the assumption that the chargino is heavier than 100 gev and consider lighter charginos .",
    "we restrict to values of the lightest chargino mass eigenstate greater than @xmath8 since otherwise the higgs boson will dominantly decay to a pair of charginos , which is not allowed by the higgs signal strength dataset .",
    "later we will present a concrete scenario in which such a light chargino evades all direct searches at lep , but the chargino contributions to the loop - induced higgs couplings are independent of these considerations .",
    "the point we wish to emphasize here is very simple : as the mass of the lightest chargino @xmath45 decreases towards @xmath8 , the one loop form factor @xmath46 exhibits a rise , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : form - factor ] .",
    "the form factor increases from its asymptotic value of @xmath47 for heavy charginos to @xmath48 for @xmath49 .",
    "this basic observation , which of course applies not only for charginos but for all light charged particles that couple to the higgs , allows for a large correction to the loop - induced couplings .",

    "we observe that it is possible to obtain enhancements as large as @xmath4 ( 75@xmath12 ) for the @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) rates in the extreme case of @xmath53 gev and @xmath54 .",
    "however , even for somewhat larger chargino masses and @xmath51 values , it is possible to achieve a sizable enhancement .",

    "this limit assumes that the sneutrinos are heavy , @xmath64 gev .",

    "the upper limit on the chargino pair production cross section  @xcite is larger than this in some regions of parameters space , particularly for chargino masses @xmath67 gev and light neutralinos , @xmath68 gev .",
    "a detailed investigation of this possible opening is beyond the scope of this paper , but we note that there are several important additional considerations besides the lep cross section limit : 1 ) constraints from higgs decays to neutralinos , 2 ) implications of a light sneutrino ( we will discuss this issue below ) , 3 ) collider searches from tevatron and lhc ( the chargino / neutralino production cross section at hadron colliders does not depend on the properties of the sneutrino ) .",
    "+ \\2 ) in the case of a small chargino - neutralino mass splitting @xmath63 , dedicated searches were carried out to cover this region  @xcite .",
    "the limits are quite strong in general , but there is a region from @xmath69 where the limit is slightly weaker than the naive kinematic limit , @xmath70 gev .",
    "we note that in this case , one can obtain a maximum enhancement of about @xmath57 in the @xmath9 decay rate from chargino loops . * _ sneutrino lsp - chargino nlsp _ : in this case , the chargino will decay to a lepton and a stable sneutrino , leading to a slepton - like signature of acoplanar leptons plus missing momentum .",
    "the combined lep2 upper limits on the slepton production cross section are very strong in this case , below 0.2 pb for the case of stau , and much lower for smuon and selectron  @xcite .",
    "there is a possible loophole in the region of small mass splitting between the slepton ( or chargino ) and lsp , as in this regime the leptons are very soft and the missing momentum is small as the lsps travel back - to - back .",
    "for example , the aleph slepton search  @xcite requires each lepton to have @xmath71 and missing transverse momentum @xmath72 , criteria which will generically not be met for splittings smaller than a gev .",
    "we note that , unlike a neutralino and chargino , there is no particular reason that a chargino and a sneutrino should be so close in mass , but it is nevertheless an interesting possibility .    [ [ r - parity - violation ] ] * r - parity violation * + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + +    we now consider scenarios with r - parity violation , in which the lsp is unstable .",
    "the signatures of chargino pair production are rich and varied in this case , with multiple leptons , jets and missing energy ( from neutrinos ) as a possible final states .",
    "if the chargino is the lsp , it will decay to three sm fermions : 2 charged leptons and a neutrino through @xmath73 , 2 jets and a lepton or neutrino via @xmath74 , and three jets via @xmath75 .",
    "if the chargino is the nlsp , or there are additional light superpartners in the spectrum , the final state multiplicity is even higher .",
    "the lep experiments performed a broad array of searches to cover this diversity of signatures .",
    "the aleph  @xcite , delphi  @xcite , and opal  @xcite analyses present _ inclusive _ limits from multiple search channels interpreted within the framework of the mssm in the @xmath76 parameter space ; the chargino mass limit is @xmath77 gev in all cases .",
    "in contrast , the l3 analysis  @xcite presents limits on specific decay modes for assumed spectra and rpv couplings , which are more easily interpreted .",
    "again , charginos are ruled out up to @xmath19 gev in all cases , though not all rpv couplings are considered .    for the aleph , delphi , and opal analyses , since explicit limits on specific decay modes of the chargino are not presented , it is difficult to make a concrete statement on the mass limit of the chargino for a specific spectrum and rpv coupling without further detailed analysis and simulation to recast these results .",
    "nonetheless , in all of the rpv searches referenced above the observed number of events and expected backgrounds are reported for each selection , and no statistically significant excess was observed . given the large chargino pair production cross section , one expects that the upper limit on the chargino mass will be close to the kinematic reach for any conceivable decay path .",
    "as we have seen , a variety of searches at lep place a fairly robust bound on charginos close to the naive kinematic limit , @xmath78 .",
    "an explicit assumption in the rpv searches is that the lsp decays promptly .",
    "however , as emphasized recently in ref .",
    "@xcite , these bounds are often severely weakened or even nullified if the lsp has a displaced decay within the detector . in this section",
    "we describe a viable scenario in which the lightest chargino has a mass @xmath79 . in our scenario ,",
    "the lsp is a sneutrino that has a macroscopic decay length of order @xmath80 .",
    "we will demonstrate that this scenario is compatible with all existing direct searches by experiments at lep , tevatron , and lhc .",

    ". we may first ask how such objects are classified during event reconstruction . for concreteness ,",
    "let us focus on the aleph experiment  @xcite , which uses an energy flow algorithm .",
    "the process begins with the identification of `` good '' charged tracks . any charged track which originates from within a cylinder of length 20 cm and coaxial radius 2 cm from the beam line and centered about the interaction point",
    "will be considered as a `` good '' track .",
    "crucially , for a long - lived neutral particle with a macroscopic lifetime , @xmath81 cm , the tracks associated with the charged decay products will be ignored as they will generally not point back to the collision point .",
    "the lep rpv searches typically require a minimum number of `` good '' tracks , a significant fraction of which are assumed to originate from the prompt decay of the lsp .",
    "this selection criterion will generally not be met if the lsp decays far away from the primary interaction region .",
    "similar conclusions hold for the delphi , opal , and l3 experiments  @xcite .",
    "what then becomes of the particles produced in the displaced decay of the long - lived neutral particle ?",
    "if the decay is displaced but still within the detector , the final state jets and/or leptons will deposit energy in the hadronic and/or electromagnetic calorimeters , and as such the long - lived neutral particle will not leave a signature of missing transverse momentum .",
    "instead , these particles will be classified as neutral hadrons by the energy flow algorithm  @xcite .    for lifetimes greater than several meters , the lsp can escape the detector altogether , leading to events with missing transverse momentum .",
    "thus , in this regime standard susy searches will place severe constraints on sparticle masses .",
    "however , as we will show , there is an important gap for lifetimes of @xmath82 for which a displaced neutral lsp can evade the searches at lep .",

    "2 ) the leptonic asymmetry parameter @xmath179 , predicted in the sm to be @xmath180 , becomes smaller due to a small positive @xmath181 parameter , increasing the tension with the experimental average @xmath182 .",
    "the tension in this region can be relaxed with a small positive @xmath183 parameter from a source other than the charginos .",
    "a new contribution of order @xmath184 raises the values of @xmath185 and @xmath179 , leading to a global fit that resembles that of the sm .",
    "as an example , a light , highly - mixed stop can easily yield the required contribution to @xmath183 , while at the same time not upsetting the observed higgs production rates .",
    "this is because the coupling of the light stops to the higgs is proportional to @xmath186 and therefore only mildly disturbs the gluon fusion rate if @xmath187 .",
    "for instance , with the inputs @xmath188 gev , @xmath189 tev , @xmath190 tev , @xmath191 gev , @xmath192 , one obtains a stop with mass close to the top , a contribution @xmath193 , as well as a small @xmath194 enhancement of the gluon fusion rate .",

    "in this work we have investigated a scenario with a very light chargino in the mass range @xmath14 gev , below the naive kinematic reach of lep2 .",
    "a chargino in this mass range can lead to dramatic deviations in the @xmath18 and @xmath50 decay rates , which could be measured at the lhc and future high energy colliders . a variety of lep2 , tevatron , and lhc searches place strong constraints on this hypothesis , but the analyses are model dependent and based on assumed decay channels of the charginos .",
    "we presented a concrete scenario which is not covered by existing searches : a chargino decaying to sneutrino lsp , which subsequently decays through a small rpv coupling with a macroscopic decay length of order @xmath195 .",
    "the charged particles in the sneutrino decay products generically fail to point back to the primary vertex , and as such do not pass basic track impact parameter selection cuts required at lep .",
    "furthermore , standard susy searches at lep looking for missing transverse momentum are weakened by a neutral veto which will be in effect unless both sneutrinos decay outside the detector .",
    "the 125 gev higgs mass can be obtained in this scenario in several ways . in the region of low @xmath44",
    "relevant for modifications to the @xmath196 rate , it is difficult to obtain a higgs mass of 125 gev in the mssm with superpartners at the tev scale .",
    "one possibility is to simply raise the masses of the scalars ( except for the light sneutrino and slepton ) , and in particular the stops into the multi - tev range . of course , such heavy stops require a finely - tuned weak scale , and in this scenario one can not rely on the stops to improve the precision electroweak data . for slightly larger values @xmath197",
    "it is also possible to obtain the observed higgs mass in the mssm with highly mixed stops at the tev scale .",
    "finally , one can investigate extensions of the mssm with new @xmath198- or @xmath199-term contributions to the higgs mass , see for example refs .",
    "these extensions can lead to modifications of the chargino interactions with the higgs ( see , _",
    "e.g. _ , refs .",
    "@xcite,@xcite ) .",
    "while our discussion has focused on charginos , similar considerations apply to other hypothetical light charged particles . with regards to the corrections to @xmath9 , the one - loop form factor for scalars , fermions , as vectors exhibit a rise in magnitude as the mass of the charged particle in the loop approaches @xmath8 , as we have illustrated for the case of the fermion in fig .",
    "[ fig : form - factor ] .",
    "the basic scenario for a hidden chargino described in this work can , with a few modifications , be used to hide other light charged particles . for example , a light stau nlsp decaying to a long - lived neutralino lsp will be weakly constrained if the neutralino lifetime is @xmath200 .",
    "it would also be interesting to consider non - supersymmetric scenarios .",
    "for example , light vector - like leptons above  100 gev can lead to large deviations in @xmath9 at the expense of a low scale @xmath201 tev vacuum instability  @xcite .",
    "however , if the charged states are lighter are below 100 gev , the same effect can be obtained with much weaker couplings of the vector - like leptons to the higgs , allowing for a much higher uv completion scale .",
    "given this window in which light charginos , and by extension various other hypothetical light charged particles with displaced neutral particles in their decay products , are unconstrained , it is important that the lhc experiments develop dedicated searches to probe this scenario .",

    "<S> we explore modifications to the loop - induced higgs couplings @xmath0 and @xmath1 from light charginos in the minimal supersymmetric standard model . when the lightest chargino mass is above the naive lep bound of order @xmath2 gev the effects are modest , with deviations in the decay branching ratios typically less than @xmath3 from the standard model predictions . however , if the charginos are lighter than @xmath2 gev , more dramatic alterations to these couplings are possible as a consequence of the rise of the one loop form factor . </S>",
    "<S> for example , the diphoton signal strength can be enhanced by as much as @xmath4 compared to the standard model value . </S>",
    "<S> we scrutinize in detail the existing lep , tevatron , and lhc searches and present a scenario in which a very light chargino with a mass as light as half the higgs mass is hidden at lep and is allowed by all direct collider constraints and electroweak precision tests . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario has a sneutrino lsp with a macroscopic decay length of order @xmath5 cm . </S>",
    "<S> we outline potential search strategies to test this scenario at the lhc .    </S>",
    "<S> the atlas and cms experiments at the large hadron collider have discovered a resonance at 125 gev that appears in all respects to be the long - sought higgs boson  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> while this discovery represents an important milestone in our efforts to understand the mechanism of electroweak symmetry breaking , it also presents an exciting opportunity to probe physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) through precise studies of the properties of this new state . in this direction </S>",
    "<S> , there is now a dedicated experimental program to measure its couplings and quantum numbers . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore of particular interest to understand the predicted range of higgs couplings in motivated extensions of the standard model ( sm ) , especially those that address the hierarchy problem such as the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we revisit the modifications to the loop - induced couplings @xmath0 and @xmath1 from charginos in the mssm . </S>",
    "<S> the higgs - chargino - chargino coupling descends from the @xmath6 higgs - wino - higgsino gauge interaction and thus has a magnitude of order @xmath7 , small in comparison to the top yukawa coupling . </S>",
    "<S> because of this fact , one generally expects that charginos lead to small deviations in the loop - induced couplings with respect to the sm predictions . </S>",
    "<S> this expectation was confirmed recently in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> this conclusion , however , rests on the assumption that the chargino is heavier than the naive kinematic lep bound of order 100 gev . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> we will relax this assumption and entertain the possibility of charginos lighter than 100 gev , and perhaps as light as @xmath8 . in this regime , there is a strong enhancement in the one loop form factors governing the @xmath9 , @xmath10 decays that can compensate the smallness of @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> we will demonstrate that enhancements as large as 70@xmath12 in the partial decay rates are then possible . while our focus is on the well - motivated case of charginos in the mssm , </S>",
    "<S> the rise of the form factor is a generic feature for any new light charged particles coupled to the higgs .    </S>",
    "<S> as we will review in detail , the lep experiments performed a suite of searches that are sensitive to chargino pair production , resulting in a fairly robust bound on the chargino mass that is close to the kinematic limit of order 100 gev . </S>",
    "<S> however , as stressed recently in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , these searches have very weak coverage for neutral particles with a displaced decay length of order 10 - 100 cm due to strict impact parameter requirements for charged particles </S>",
    "<S> . exploiting this fact , we present a scenario containing a very light chargino @xmath13 , with mass @xmath14 gev , that is allowed by all direct searches at lep , tevatron , and lhc . in our scenario , </S>",
    "<S> the lsp is a sneutrino with a macroscopic lifetime that decays within the detector through a small r - parity violating coupling . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that such light charginos can give an acceptable description of the precision electroweak data . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we describe several potential experimental strategies to test this scenario at the lhc .    a great deal of theoretical effort has been focused on possible new physics contributions to the coupling of the higgs to two photons . for example , besides the very light charginos that we discuss in this work , in the mssm one can obtain a sizable enhancement in the @xmath9 rate with light , highly mixed staus  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> these investigations have been motivated by data . early on in the search for the higgs particle both atlas and cms consistently reported measurements of the diphoton signal strength that were larger than one . while atlas still observes an enhancement in this channel , the latest cms study no longer reports an enhancement . </S>",
    "<S> the most up - to - date measurements of the diphoton signal strength as of susy 2013 read  @xcite,@xcite : @xmath15 the quoted cms result is based on a mva analysis ; a cut based analysis is also performed and yields a higher central value : @xmath16  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the situation is therefore not clear experimentally , with the atlas and cms disagreeing at the @xmath17 level . </S>",
    "<S> thus , while there is certainly no statistically significant evidence for a large enhancement in this channel , there is still ample room for deviations to show up with the data accumulated during the upcoming 13 tev run . </S>",
    "<S> if an unambiguous deviation in @xmath18 ( or @xmath10 ) is eventually established , then it will be important to revisit with experiment the possibility of charginos and other hypothetical charged particles below @xmath19 gev , since in this regime significant deviations are obtained even for weak couplings to the higgs . </S>"
