    "the collection , @xmath9 , of closed subsets of a topological space  @xmath10 , ordered by inclusion , forms a distributive complete lattice often referred to as the _ closed set lattice _ of  @xmath10 .",

    "it is natural to ask :    [ quest : first question ] which lattices have topological representations ?",
    "seymour papert was the first to characterize such lattices as those which are complete , distributive , and have a base consisting of irreducible elements ,  @xcite .",
    "we can also ask how much of the topological structure of a space is encoded in its closed set lattice . following wolfgang thron , @xcite",
    ", we say that two topological spaces @xmath10 and  @xmath12 are _ lattice - equivalent _ if their closed - set lattices are order - isomorphic . clearly , homeomorphic spaces are lattice - equivalent , but the converse fails .",

    "furthermore , any topological space  @xmath10 is lattice - equivalent to its sobrification @xmath16 and so it follows that @xmath2 can not contain a non - sober space  @xmath10 and its sobrification  @xmath16 at the same time , in other words , @xmath15 is a _ maximal _",
    "choice for  @xmath2 .",
    "the two questions above can also be asked in the context of a particular class of topological spaces .",
    "the ones we have in mind were introduced by dana scott , @xcite , and are known collectively as _",
    "domains_. the characteristic feature of domains is that they carry a partial order and that their topology is completely determined by the order .",
    "more precisely , let @xmath0 be a poset and @xmath17 a subset of  @xmath0 .",
    "one says that @xmath17 _ scott open _ , if ( i )  @xmath17  is an upper set , and ( ii )  @xmath17 is inaccessible by directed joins .",

    "we may now relativize our definitions to the context of scott spaces .",
    "we say that a lattice  @xmath11 has a _ scott - topological representation _ if @xmath11 is isomorphic to @xmath1 for some poset  @xmath0 , and ask :    [ prob : first problem ] which lattices have scott - topological representations ?",
    "although some work has been done on this problem , @xcite , as of now it remains open .",

    "a _ dcpo - completion _ of a poset @xmath0 is a dcpo @xmath24 together with a scott - continuous mapping @xmath25 such that for any scott - continuous mapping @xmath26 into a dcpo @xmath27 there exists a unique scott - continuous mapping @xmath28 satisfying @xmath29 .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that the dcpo - completion , @xmath30 , of a poset @xmath0 always exists ; furthermore @xmath31 .",

    "intrepid readers who are keen to pursue the detailed construction of @xmath41 and how it works in answering the ho - zhao problem may then continue their odyssey into section  [ sec : hoxi - structure ] .    for notions from domain theory",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite .",

    "two facts about irreducible sets will be important below :    * if @xmath24 is irreducible then so is its topological closure . *",
    "the direct image of an irreducible set under a continuous function is again irreducible .    in this paper",
    "we are exclusively interested in dcpos and the scott topology on them .",
    "when we say `` ( closed ) irreducible '' in this context we always mean ( closed ) irreducible with respect to the scott topology .",
    "it is a fact that every directed set in a dcpo is irreducible in this sense , while a set that is directed and closed is of course a principal ideal , that is , of the form @xmath52 .",
    "peter johnstone discovered in 1981 , @xcite , that a dcpo may have irreducible sets which are not directed , and closed irreducible sets which are not principal ideals ; we will discuss his famous example in section  [ sec : johnstones - countereg ] and someone not familiar with it may want to have a look at it before reading on .    given that we may view irreducible sets as a generalisation of directed sets , the following definition suggests itself :    a dcpo @xmath53 is called _ strongly complete _ if every irreducible subset of  @xmath54 has a supremum . in this case",
    "we also say that @xmath54 is an _",
    "scpo_. a subset of an scpo is called _ strongly closed _ if it closed under the formation of suprema of irreducible subsets .",
    "note that despite this terminology , strongly complete partial orders are a long way from being complete in the sense of lattice theory .      the basis of questions [ quest : first question ] and  [ quest : second question ] in the introduction is the well - known ( dual ) adjunction between topological spaces and frames , which for our purposes is expressed more appropriately as a ( dual ) adjunction between topological spaces and coframes : @xmath55[r]{$\\gamma:\\mathbf{top}$}\\ar@/^/[r]_\\bot & \\makebox[2em][l]{$\\mathbf{cofrm}^{\\mathrm{op}}:\\mathrm{spec}$}\\ar@/^/[l ]      } \\ ] ] here @xmath56 is the functor that assigns to a coframe its set of _ irreducible _ elements , that is , those elements  @xmath57 for which @xmath58 implies @xmath59 or @xmath60 , topologized by closed sets @xmath61 .",
    "starting with a topological space @xmath46 we obtain the _ sobrification _",
    "@xmath16 of  @xmath10 by composing @xmath56 with  @xmath4 .",
    "concretely , the points of @xmath16 are given by the closed irreducible subsets of  @xmath10 and the topology is given by closed sets @xmath62 where @xmath63 .    in order to present problems [ prob : first problem ] and  [ prob : second problem ] in a similar fashion ,",
    "it seems natural to replace @xmath64 with the category of _ dcpo spaces _",
    ", i.e. , directed - complete partially ordered sets equipped with the scott topology .",
    "however , while we know that @xmath56 yields topological spaces which are dcpos in their specialisation order , it is _ not the case _ that the topology on @xmath65 equals the scott topology with respect to that order ; all we know is that every @xmath66 is scott - closed .    rather than follow a topological route ,",
    "therefore , we reduce the picture entirely to one concerning _ ordered sets_. to this end we restrict the adjunction above to the category @xmath67 of _ monotone convergence spaces _ (",
    "* definition  ii-3.12 ) ) on the topological side and compose it with the adjunction between monotone convergence spaces and dcpos @xmath68_\\bot & \\mathbf{mcs}:\\mathrm{so}\\ar@/^/[l ]      } \\ ] ] which assigns to a dcpo its scott space and to a space its set of points with the _",

    "we assign to a coframe the _ ordered set _ of irreducible elements , where the order is inherited from the coframe . to emphasize the shift in perspective , we denote it with  @xmath71 rather than  @xmath56 or @xmath72",
    ". it will also prove worthwhile to recall the action of @xmath71 on morphisms : if @xmath73 is a coframe homomorphism , then @xmath74 maps an irreducible element  @xmath57 of  @xmath75 to @xmath76 .",

    "the counit @xmath80 ( as a concrete map between coframes ) sends an element  @xmath81 of a coframe  @xmath11 to the set @xmath82 which is clearly closed under directed suprema , hence an element of @xmath83 .",
    "combining @xmath71 with  @xmath4 yields a monad on @xmath8 which we denote with @xmath84 .",
    "concretely , it assigns to a dcpo  @xmath54 the set  @xmath85 of closed irreducible subsets ordered by inclusion .",
    "we call this structure the _ order sobrification of  @xmath54_. if @xmath86 is a scott - continuous function between dcpos , and @xmath87 is a closed irreducible set , then @xmath88 is the scott closure of the direct image  @xmath89 ( which is again irreducible as we noted at the beginning of this section ) .",
    "the monad unit is given by the unit of the adjunction and the multiplication @xmath90 maps a closed irreducible collection .",
    "] of closed irreducible subsets to their union .",
    "we will see in section  [ sec : hoxi - informal ] that this order - theoretic monad is _ not _ idempotent ; this is an important difference to its topological counterpart , the sobrification monad .",
    "the concrete description of @xmath91 as union allows us to conclude immediately :    [ prop : scpo ] for any dcpo  @xmath54 , @xmath85 is strongly complete .",

    "\\(3 ) this follows for categorical reasons because the union operation is the same as @xmath102 , but a direct proof is instructive for what follows : if @xmath103 is a directed subset of @xmath94 then each @xmath104 must belong to some @xmath105 .",
    "because each @xmath106 is a lower set of  @xmath54 we have @xmath107 and because @xmath93 is a lower set of @xmath85 it follows that @xmath108 .",

    "this is crucial as it allows us to invoke lemma  [ lem : strong](2 ) .",
    "the computation thus reads : @xmath140 the other composition , @xmath141 , simplifies in exactly the same way to the identity on  @xmath134 , and since all maps involved are order - preserving , we have shown that the pair  @xmath142 constitutes an order isomorphism between @xmath133 and  @xmath134 .",
    "our new version of question  [ prob : second problem ] requires us to infer @xmath126 from @xmath128 , and the most direct approach is to find a way to recognize _ purely order - theoretically _ inside  @xmath85 those elements which correspond closed irreducible subsets of the form  @xmath52 with @xmath143 .",

    "it follows that @xmath45 is highly non - algebraic , and indeed it could nt be algebraic as algebraic dcpos are always sober spaces in their scott topology .",
    "let us take a closer look at the scott topology on  @xmath45 .",
    "the two defining conditions of scott - closed sets manifest themselves in the following properties :    * closed sets are lower sets : if the set contains a limit point  @xmath202 , then it must contain the component  @xmath213 and all levels @xmath214 . *",
    "closed sets are closed under the formation of limits : if the set contains infinitely many elements of any one component then it must contain the limit point of that component .",

    "of course , @xmath45 is not the closure of a singleton since there is no largest element so we may conclude , as peter johnstone did in @xcite , that @xmath45 is not sober in its scott topology . in the terminology of the last section",

    "the result is that the infinite column generated by @xmath347 has been replaced with a finite column generated by @xmath351 where @xmath352 with @xmath295 the height of the `` lower rectangle '' in the language of proposition  [ p : closed ] . here . ]",
    "the construction continues in the same vein as we add more numbers to the front of the string @xmath353 .",
    "we always have to convert an infinite column into a finite one in case the generating limit point was removed in the parent sheet .",
    "if @xmath230 is not a suffix of @xmath333 , then we do nt need to manipulate @xmath324 at all in order to obtain  @xmath354 .    in summary",
    ", we have constructed the individual sets @xmath354 in such a way that they conform to the characterisation of locally closed set in proposition  [ p : closed ] , that they are compatible with the equivalence relation  @xmath240 , and that all elements in @xmath355 are below @xmath241 .",
    "crucially , @xmath356 does not contain the element @xmath241 we started out with .",
    "case 2 : @xmath357 : in this case we can also assume that @xmath358 because otherwise the maximal element @xmath258 is equivalent to @xmath259 on sheet @xmath261 , contradicting our assumption that the length of  @xmath230 is minimal . since we know that @xmath24 does not contain the whole level  @xmath359 , it contains only a finite subset of it by principle  @xmath291 and @xmath260 is a generator of part  i of @xmath360 . as before ,",
    "we convert the infinite column generated by @xmath260 to a finite column generated by some @xmath361 and continue with this process on subsequent sheets .    for the third and final step in our proof of  [ p : characterisation ] we turn our attention to closed sets that do not contain any `` isolated '' maximal elements , that is , sets that contain the full level @xmath334 whenever they contain the element @xmath241 for some @xmath206 .",
    "levels are indexed by a string ( indicating the sheet ) and a number , but since the equivalence relation identifies @xmath316 with @xmath362 we only need strings of numbers to index them .",
    "we say that level @xmath363 is below  @xmath364 if @xmath365 .",
    "this induces an order  @xmath366 between strings of numbers generated by the following two rules :    * @xmath367 for all @xmath222 , @xmath238 * @xmath368 for all @xmath369 , @xmath238    with respect to @xmath366 , @xmath227 is a tree with root  @xmath229 , in other words , @xmath370 is linearly ordered for all @xmath238 .",
    "it is easy to write out the chain above @xmath230 and to check that it is upwards closed , so must be all of  @xmath370 : @xmath371    a hasse diagram of @xmath372 would look exactly the same as the one shown in figure  [ fig : tree ] ( though there we used a different labelling scheme ) .",

    "the issue at hand is downward closure , so assume there is @xmath374 , i.e. , there is @xmath375 with @xmath376 .",
    "the element @xmath78 belongs to some level @xmath377 and since @xmath378 is linearly ordered with respect to  @xmath366 , we must have @xmath379 or @xmath380 . in the former case ,",
    "@xmath381 because we assumed @xmath364 to be maximal in  @xmath24 . in the latter case",
    "we have @xmath365 by the definition of  @xmath366 . in either case",
    "we get a contradiction to the assumption that @xmath382 .",
    "we decompose @xmath24 as @xmath383 and irreducibility now implies that the second component must be empty .",
    "having identified exactly which subsets of @xmath41 are closed irreducible with respect to the scott topology , we can now deliver on our promise , made at the end of section  [ sec : positive ] , of giving an example of a non - dominated dcpo .",
    "[ prop : hoxi is not dominated ] the dcpo @xmath41 is not dominated .    by the preceding proposition , @xmath384 and for every @xmath385 ,",

    "thus , @xmath41 fails to be dominated .    reassured by the above result , we now proceed to the next subsection to establish that the dcpos @xmath41 and @xmath42 form the desired counterexample to the ho - zhao conjecture .",
    "recall that the unit  @xmath392 of the order sobrification monad maps @xmath78 to  @xmath52 and is scott - continuous .",
    "we will employ this in our proof of theorem  [ thm : h = sobh ] :    we have the map @xmath393 described in the previous section ; it maps a closed set  @xmath48 to  @xmath394 . because @xmath395 is scott - continuous we have the map @xmath396 in the opposite direction .",
    "we show that they are inverses of each other . for the first calculation let @xmath48 be a scott - closed subset of  @xmath41 .",
    "@xmath397 for the other composition , let @xmath398 be a scott - closed subset of  @xmath42 . @xmath399 our proof will be complete if we can show the reverse of the first implication in the calculation above .",
    "for this we use our knowledge about the elements of  @xmath42 , that is , the irreducible closed subsets of  @xmath41 established in the previous subsection ( proposition  [ p : characterisation ] ) . for irreducible subsets of the form  @xmath52",
    "the reverse of  @xmath400 is trivially true , so assume that @xmath24 is the downset of some level  @xmath334 for @xmath238 , @xmath222 , and @xmath401 .",
    "in particular we have @xmath402 for the elements",
    "@xmath241 of  @xmath334 .",
    "because all elements of level  @xmath197 on sheet  @xmath346 are below @xmath403 , we have @xmath404 for all @xmath206 , and hence @xmath405 as the latter is downward closed .",
