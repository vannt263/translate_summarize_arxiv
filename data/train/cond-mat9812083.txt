    "ii . the difference is , however , that the relation eq .",

    "indeed , the renormalization of the effective mass@xcite is now determined by the effective interaction @xmath151 through @xmath152 , while @xmath68 is determined by the first fourier harmonics of @xmath153 ; accordingly , @xmath154 is determined by the zero s fourier component of @xmath153 .",

    "the main goal of this paper is to demonstrate that alongside with fundamental characteristics , @xmath158 , of interacting electron gas , which describes the enhacement of the @xmath0-factor , and was studied in many works , there exists another fundamental characteristics @xmath88 which describes the interaction - induced enhancement of the so coupling .",
    "we calculated this function analytically in the limit of high concentrations and estimated numerically at low concentrations .",
    "note that throughout the paper we assumed the bare so coupling to be small : @xmath159 .",
    "however , in the limit of high concentrations ( @xmath34 ) the corresponding condition is more strict : @xmath160 , which is equivalent to @xmath161 . in the intermediate region @xmath162 the enhancement factor is given by @xmath163    since experimentally the concentration of carriers is varied by changing the gate voltage@xcite , there exists another simple reason for the dependence of the so coupling on the concentration .",
    "indeed , the change of the gate voltage causes the redistribution of the confining potential , which , in turn @xcite , affects the parameter @xmath39 .",
    "this mechanism should be dominant at high concentrations when @xmath68 is small .",
    "note in conclusion , that if the bare so splitting is caused by the dresselhaus mechanism@xcite , which originates from the absence of the inversion symmetry in the bulk , the renormalization of the corresponding splitting of the spectrum , @xmath164 , has the same form as eq .",
    "( [ simple ] ) : @xmath165 . as a result ,",
    "when both @xmath164 and @xmath115 are present , the splitting of the energy spectrum is given by the same formula as for noninteracting electrons@xcite @xmath166    finally , let us point out that in conventional magnetotransport oscillations experiments performed up to now@xcite the typical concentrations of electrons was quite high @xmath167@xmath8 .",
    "as a result , the typical values of the interaction parameter @xmath1 were rather low ( @xmath168 ) . only in 2d hole",
    "gas@xcite the condition ( @xmath169 ) was fulfilled . for low values of @xmath1",
    "our theory predicts that the renormalization of the so coupling is weak .",
    "however , in recent experiments on the electron gases in silicon metal - oxide - semiconductor field - effect transistors@xcite and alas quantum wells@xcite , as well as in hole gases in sige quantum wells@xcite , gaas inverted semiconductor - insulator - semiconductor structures@xcite , and gaas - algaas heterostructures@xcite the values of @xmath1 ranged from@xcite @xmath170 to@xcite @xmath171 .",
    "for such large @xmath1 we predict a strong renormalization of the so coupling , which might be of relevance for metal - insulator transition observed in these systems .",
    "for example , the strong renormalization of so coupling at large @xmath1 might cause an instability of electronic spectrum in a clean system , so that the system in zero magnetic field would undergo a transition into an exotic `` chiral phase '' at some critical density . to be more specific , in the latest publication@xcite the critical density for metal - insulator transition in n - type gaas was reported to be @xmath172 @xmath8 . to accomodate all these electrons within the lower branch of the spectrum , corresponding to chirality `` @xmath173 '' ( see eq .",

    "on the other hand , the constant @xmath39 for relatively high - density gaas / algaas structure with @xmath176@xmath8 can be extracted from ref . to be @xmath177ev@xmath175 m .",
