    "@xcite an understanding of the mott insulating state and also of the transition from a correlated metal to a mott insulator is important for many transition - metal oxides including the parent compounds of cuprate - based high - temperature superconductors .",
    "@xcite the mott transition is generically described using lattice models with purely local interactions , such as the single - band hubbard model .",
    "@xcite correlations , however , are generally non - local or even long - ranged .",
    "it is a highly non - trivial question to what extent the mott transition is dominated by local correlations and whether or not local approximations , i.e.  approximations neglecting non - local correlations , are able to capture the essence of the mott physics .",
    "the implications of the dynamical mean - field theory , @xcite as a distinguished local approximation , have been worked out in detail in the past and have been compared with numerous experiments on transition - metal oxides .",
    "the dmft is a mean - field approach in the sense that the effects of non - local spin or charge two - particle correlations on the one - particle excitation spectrum are neglected . in case of layered , essentially two - dimensional compounds , for example , this is probably a too strong approximation .",
    "different generalizations of dmft have been suggested in the past to overcome this limitation .",
    "@xcite cluster extensions @xcite which restore the effects of non - local correlations step by step with increasing cluster size , are conceptually simple and interesting approaches in this respect .",
    "the idea is that , besides the local ( temporal ) correlations , it is the effect of the _ short - range _ correlations , treated exactly in a cluster approach , which dominates the physics of the mott transition or at least the physics of the mott - insulating state . as the importance of non - local correlations",
    "is expected to increase with decreasing lattice dimension , the most stringent test for a cluster approach consists in its application to the one - dimensional lattice .",
    "ideally , starting from a ( dynamical ) mean - field picture of the transition , the decisive step forward should be done with the smallest clusters already , while a further increase of the cluster size should add qualitatively unimportant corrections only .",
    "since exact results from the bethe ansatz are available for the hubbard model in one dimension , @xcite this model can very well be used to test this idea and to benchmark different cluster approximations .    apart from true extensions of dmft , @xcite where a small cluster with @xmath2 correlated sites and a continuum ( @xmath3 ) of uncorrelated ( `` bath '' ) sites is considered , there are also dynamical cluster approaches without any bath degrees of freedom ( i.e.  @xmath4 ) , such as the cluster - perturbation theory ( cpt ) @xcite and the variational cluster approach ( vca ) .",
    "@xcite the self - energy - functional theory ( sft ) , @xcite provides a unified framework for all these different cluster approximations which are characterized by different @xmath2 and @xmath5 .",
    "therefore , the purpose of this paper is to apply ( within the sft ) different cluster approaches to the one - dimensional hubbard model and to study the interaction- and the filling - controlled transition for benchmarking purposes .",
    "an obvious question concerns the rate of convergence to the exact solution which is approached in the @xmath6 limit . depending on the cluster scheme used and on the quantity of interest , an exponential or power - law dependence on @xmath2",
    "can be inferred .",
    "@xcite these considerations , however , apply to the large-@xmath2 limit only while for practical purposes the quality of a given approximation for _ small _ @xmath2 is much more important and can only be estimated _ a posteriori_.    it is also unclear whether or not the inclusion of bath sites makes a cluster approach more efficient , i.e.  speeds up the convergence to the exact solution ( see the discussion in ref .  ) . because of the exponential growth of the hilbert space with increasing @xmath5 , this is of particular importance for methods that are based on a full ( or lanczos ) diagonalization of the effective cluster model .",
    "a simple and frequently used @xcite cluster approximation is the `` direct '' cluster approximation where quantities for the infinite system are approximated by those of a finite cluster without any embedding of the cluster into a medium that mimics the disregarded cluster environment .",
    "due to particle - number conservation and due to the finite ( and usually small ) cluster size @xmath2 , it is inconvenient to study filling dependencies using the direct cluster approach .",
    "the filling - controlled mott transition , in particular , is hardly accessible in this way .",

    "note that the reference system has to be solved repeatedly to find a stationary point or to achieve self - consistency , respectively , and that due to open boundary conditions a few general symmetries can be exploited only .",
    "for a small cluster with @xmath48 , for example , this implies a limitation to less than @xmath49 local degrees of freedom , i.e.  less than two bath sites per correlated site , if @xmath50 is taken to be constant as usual .",

    "one of the advantages of the variational cluster approximation ( and of the sft in general ) consists in its flexibility to construct approximations of different quality and complexity .",
    "the most simple case is given by a reference system consisting of decoupled clusters ( chains ) with @xmath2 correlated sites each where only the intra - cluster nearest - neighbor hopping @xmath95 is considered as a variational parameter , see fig .",

    "clusters with an even number of sites @xmath2 are preferred to avoid a kramers - degenerate ground state ( for half - filling ) and odd - even effects when comparing results for different @xmath2 with each other .",
    "another variational parameter suggesting itself is the on - site energy . a homogeneous shift of all intra - cluster on - site energies acts like a separate cluster chemical potential .",
    "as has been discussed in ref .",
    ", this is actually one of the most important parameters as its optimization guarantees thermodynamical consistency with respect to the particle number . here , we start our discussion with the mott - insulating phase at half - filling ( @xmath17 ) . in this case , the optimal value of the cluster on - site energies is already predicted by particle - hole symmetry and is given by the on - site energy of the sites in the original model ( which is set to zero ) .",
    "this can also be reproduced explicitly within the vca : it turns out that @xmath65 $ ] is always at a maximum for vanishing on - site energies .",
    "we also ignore fictitious symmetry - breaking fields coupling to the local spin or the local charge density .",
    "since those coupling terms belong to the one - particle part of the hamiltonian , the corresponding field strengths can in principle be considered as additional variational parameters .",
    "@xcite a finite value of the optimized field would indicate long - range spin or charge order which , however , is absent in one dimension or , as concerns e.g.   ferromagnetism , is disregarded here . as discussed in ref .",
    ", the absence of antiferromagnetic order in the @xmath38 hubbard model at half - filling is respected by the vca for sufficiently large clusters .",
    "a non - trivial result , namely @xmath97 , is found when optimizing the nearest - neighbor hopping , see fig .",
    "[ fig : tprime ] . the physical idea behind this approximation",
    "is that switching off the _",
    "inter_-cluster hopping , which generates the approximate self - energy , can partially be compensated for by enhancing the _ intra_-cluster hopping .",
    "this is in fact seen in the figure : the optimal @xmath95 is larger than the physical hopping .",
    "the trends found for different cluster sizes @xmath2 and for different @xmath0 corroborate this interpretation : the larger the cluster the smaller is the necessary compensation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : tprime ] ) .",
    "furthermore , it is reasonable that in case of a stronger interaction and thus more localized electrons , switching off the inter - cluster hopping is less significant .",
    "the strongest approximation of the self - energy is therefore generated by the smallest cluster ( @xmath98 ) and in the limit @xmath25 .",

    "this might be explained by the argument that , even for @xmath189 and even with optimized cluster one - particle parameters , a trial self - energy taken from the @xmath216 subspace can not describe the physics of a metallic state entirely correct .",

    "as has been seen in the discussion of the results for half - filling , bath sites can considerably help to improve a cluster approximation .",

    "we also note that the vca calculation fully respects luttinger s sum rule @xcite in the entire filling range . while for a translationally invariant system the sum rule states that the filling equals the range in reciprocal space enclosed by the fermi points , a generalized form of the sum rule ( given in ref .  ) must be considered here to account for the artificially reduced symmetry resulting from the cluster approximation .",
    "the main idea is that the sum rule can be derived from the equation @xmath269 .",
    "this can be tested even if the approximate self - energy and the ( via dyson s equation ) related green s function do not respect the translational symmetries of the underlying lattice and even if the system under consideration is finite .",

    "as has been discussed recently , @xcite due to the conserving nature of the vca , the validity of the sum rule for the reference system is then transferred to the approximate quantities for the lattice problem .",
    "[ fig : babnmu ] also includes the prediction of single - site dmft .",
    "while close to half - filling the mean - field theory fails completely , hardly any difference to the exact result can be detected for fillings lower than @xmath270 .",
    "it is worth mentioning that the results of full dmft are _ quantitatively _ recovered by the most simple dynamical impurity approximation ( dia ) within the framework of sft , namely by using a reference system consisting of the single correlated and a single bath site only ( @xmath143 , @xmath170 ) . both @xmath217 curves , taken from dmft and from the dia , are identical on the scale of the figure .",
    "cluster mean - field theories that are based on full diagonalization or on the lanczos technique to treat the effective cluster problem , exhibit a number of advantages : they directly work at zero temperature , they are flexible and can equally well treat arbitrary geometries , and they provide the numerically exact solution of the cluster within a comparatively short cpu time .",
    "these advantages are achieved at the cost of a strongly limited cluster size ( of the order of 10 sites ) dictated by the exponential dependence of the cluster hilbert - space dimension on system size .",
    "it is therefore of highest importance to make use of the cluster degrees of freedom in the best possible way .",
    "this can be accomplished with the self - energy - functional theory .",
    "the sft allows to fix the cluster one - particle parameters with the help of a physical variational principle that is constructed for the optimization of the one - particle excitation properties .    the actual choice of the reference system , however , is not prescribed by the approach itself , i.e.  different cluster topologies and thus different cluster approximations are conceivable",
    "this is the motivation for the present study . with the focus on the interaction- and filling - dependent mott metal - insulator transition , as a prime example of a correlation effect",
    ", different reference systems have been tested against each other and against exact results available for the one - dimensional case .",
    "note that a one - dimensional lattice model actually represents the most difficult test case for a cluster approximation .    in the following we recapitulate the main results of our study .",
    "first of all , the mott insulating state of the model at the particle - hole symmetric point is well described by a cluster approximation using a few correlated sites only . in particular , the ground - state energy can be determined precisely using finite - size scaling .",
    "already the most simple implementation of the variational - cluster approach ( vca ) including merely an overall optimization of the intra - cluster hopping , clearly improves on the `` direct '' cluster approximation .",
    "however , as compared to plain cluster - perturbation theory without any parameter optimization at all ( but combined with the expression for the sft grand potential ) , the vca yields a marginally improved ground - state energy only .",
    "similarly , the independent optimization of several or even of all intra - cluster nearest - neighbor hopping parameters leads to a gain in binding energy but this is small compared to the gain obtained by increasing the cluster size by two more sites . with",
    "increasing distance to the chain edges , the optimized hopping quickly converges to the `` physical '' value , and bulk properties are already found for sites at a distance of more than two nearest - neighbor units from the cluster edge .",
    "hopping parameters vanishing in the original model can acquire a non - zero but small value in the optimized reference system . hopping parameters linking the edges of a cluster",
    "are found to vanish , i.e.  the vca prefers open boundary conditions .",
    "the same holds for hopping parameters which would imply a breaking of particle - hole symmetry : a next - nearest - neighbor hopping , for example , turns out to be zero at the stationary point .",
    "the vca correctly predicts a mott insulating state for any @xmath23 .",
    "it also gives a reasonable estimate for the size of the single - particle insulating gap .",
    "this estimate improves with increasing interaction strength . while for strong and intermediate coupling the optimal results ( for the ground - state energy as well as for the gap ) are obtained for reference systems with parameters close to the original model , strongly deviating parameters ( more than 100% ) are favorable in the weak - coupling regime .",
    "eventually , for @xmath25 the vca ( and presumably any real - space cluster approach ) fails to describe the low - energy physics of the mott _",
    "transition_. remembering the cluster mean - field nature of the approximation , this had to be expected .",
    "it is obvious that critical behavior can not be accessed while , on the other hand , it is satisfying that physical properties on a higher energy scale are accurately captured with rather small clusters only .",
    "the additional consideration of bath sites in the reference system always yields an improved ground - state energy .",
    "it has turned out that bath sites tend to decouple from a cluster reference system at the correlated sites in the cluster center while they tightly couple to the system at the chain edges .",
    "as concerns the ground - state energy , however , this hardly speeds up the convergence to the exact result with increasing cluster size .",
    "going to the next larger cluster is always found to be more effective .    on the contrary",
    ", bath sites decisively influence the description of the one - particle excitation spectrum .",
    "cluster reference systems with an even number of additional bath sites coupled to a correlated site ( at the cluster edge ) give a much better result for the gap than clusters without bath sites but more correlated sites .",
    "this demonstrates the importance of local correlations for the one - particle spectrum .",
    "an odd number of bath sites per correlated site overemphasizes the mean - field character and thereby fails to predict the gap accurately .",
    "the overall features of the local density of states ( insulating gap , moments , etc . ) are addressed when looking at the local one - particle green s function on the imaginary frequency axis .",
    "using essentially exact dynamical dmrg results as a benchmark , we find our vca results to be fully competitive with cellular dmft calculations for the same @xmath2 .",
    "while c - dmft combined with a stochastic technique as a cluster solver is much more time - consuming , c - dmft ( @xmath98 , @xmath49 ) combined with lanczos is less reliable as the vca ( @xmath98 , @xmath49 ) .",
    "the latter gives a significantly better result for the insulating gap which , apart from the choice of the reference system , is unbiased and free of parameter fitting .",
    "this shows that the thermodynamically consistent determination of the cluster parameters is worth the effort .",
    "predicting the detailed shape of the local density of states ( for real frequencies ) is beyond the capabilities of a cluster approach based on the lanczos method : finite - size effects are clearly present .    as concerns",
    "characteristic quantities of the mott insulator at half - filling , one can state that the convergence to the exact result is mainly determined by the number of correlated sites .",
    "the additional inclusion of a continuum of bath degrees of freedom or of a large number of bath sites appears to be unnecessary .",
    "few _ bath sites , however , can strongly improve the results . for the description of the metallic phase off half - filling and of the filling - dependent mott transition",
    "this is even more correct :    without the inclusion of bath degrees of freedom , the vca with optimization of an overall on - site energy shift predicts a smooth dependence of the filling @xmath197 on the chemical potential @xmath14 . while this represents a clear advantage as compared to the `` direct '' cluster approach and to cluster - perturbation theory , the main problem consists in the fact that the _ cluster _ particle number remains constant .",
    "consequently , starting from a half - filled cluster , results are less and less reliable for increasing hole concentration @xmath271 .",
    "on the other hand , for reference systems with at least a single bath site per correlated site ( @xmath272 ) there is a mechanism which solves the problem : with the _ total _ cluster particle number always being equal to the total number of cluster sites , @xmath273 , the particle density at the _ correlated _ sites and , related to that , also the filling of the original system may vary continuously in its entire range .    for clusters with @xmath2 correlated sites and @xmath229 additional bath site attached to each , this mechanism has turned out to work over a wide range of fillings .",
    "excellent agreement with the exact @xmath217 curve from the bethe ansatz is found for fillings lower than @xmath274 . for fillings close to half - filling in the critical regime ,",
    "the vca still gives a qualitatively satisfying result , comparable to c - dmft calculations , but slightly overestimates the critical chemical potential . while accessing the critical regime for @xmath275 poses difficulties , the compressibility divergence is clearly visible .",
    "a smooth @xmath14 dependence over the complete filling range as well as a good description of the mott insulator can be achieved when using ( for @xmath98 and @xmath170 ) a somewhat different cluster topology where a bath site couples to _ both _ correlated sites .",
    "we find that both the exact result as well as the best ( dmft ) mean - field result are almost quantitatively recovered with small ( @xmath98 , @xmath143 ) reference systems including the minimum number ( @xmath170 ) of local degrees of freedom .",
