    "we shall assume that there is a continuous action , denoted @xmath10 , of @xmath0 on @xmath1 .",
    "this means the following : first of all , @xmath10 must be a homomorphism from @xmath0 into the isomorphism groupoid of @xmath1 , @xmath11 , so that , in particular , @xmath12 is a @xmath2-isomorphism for each @xmath13 .",
    "secondly , let @xmath14 and @xmath15 be the bundles on @xmath0 obtained by pulling back @xmath1 via @xmath16 and @xmath17 , so that @xmath18 and similarly for @xmath19",

    "let @xmath25 denote the space of continuous sections of @xmath15 with compact support and for @xmath26 , set@xmath27 and set@xmath28 then , with respect to these operations and pointwise addition and scalar multiplication , @xmath25 becomes a topological @xmath29-algebra in the inductive limit topology to which renault s disintegration theorem @xcite applies .",
    "the enveloping @xmath2-algebra of @xmath25 is called the _ crossed product of _",
    "acting on _ @xmath1 and is denoted @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "the basic problem we study in this note is    [ fundquest]under what circumstances on @xmath0 and @xmath1 is @xmath3 a continuous trace @xmath2-algebra ?    the first systematic investigation into questions of this type that we know of is green s pioneering study @xcite .",
    "there , green deals with the case where @xmath0 is the transformation group groupoid obtained by letting a locally compact _ group _",
    "@xmath30 act on a locally compact hausdorff space @xmath5 and where @xmath1 is the trivial line bundle over @xmath31 .",

    "another precedent to this investigation is the work of the second two authors in @xcite . here , the hypothesis is that @xmath0 is a _ principal _ groupoid and the bundle @xmath1 is again the trivial line bundle .",
    "it was shown that @xmath33 has continuous trace if and only if the action of @xmath0 on @xmath8 is proper . in this event , again , @xmath34 is strongly morita equivalent to @xmath35 .",
    "the first example where the bundle @xmath1 is nontrivial was considered by raeburn and rosenberg in @xcite .",
    "they considered a locally compact _ group _ acting on a continuous trace @xmath2-algebra @xmath36 and showed that if the natural action of @xmath0 on the spectrum of @xmath36 , @xmath37 , is free and proper , then the cross product @xmath2-algebra @xmath38 has continuous trace . in @xcite ,",
    "olesen and raeburn proved a conditioned converse : if the group @xmath0 is abelian and acts freely on @xmath37 , then if @xmath38 is continuous trace , the action of @xmath0 on @xmath37 must be proper . quite recently , deicke @xcite used non - abelian duality theory to remove the hypothesis that @xmath0 is abelian . thus , the best result in this direction is : if @xmath0 acts on @xmath36 yielding a free action on @xmath37 , then @xmath38 is continuous trace if and only if the action of @xmath0 on @xmath37 is proper .",
    "our objective in this note , theorem  [ main ] , is to prove a result that contains all of these examples as special cases  and much more , as well .",
    "it is based on two hypotheses and some ancillary considerations that we will elaborate .",
    "the first hypothesis is    [ hyp1 ] the @xmath2-algebra @xmath39 is continuous trace .    here",
    ", @xmath39 denotes the @xmath2-algebra of continuous sections of the bundle @xmath1 that vanish at infinity on @xmath8 .",
    "an hypothesis on the bundle @xmath1 of this nature is natural and reasonable , in view of the fact that in the trivial case @xmath40 , we have @xmath41 .",
    "furthermore , we note that a compact group can act on an antiliminal @xmath2-algebra in such a way that the crossed product is continuous trace @xcite .",
    "to state our second hypothesis , we need a couple of remarks about the spectrum of @xmath39 .",
    "we shall denote it by @xmath5 throughout this note .",
    "observe that @xmath5 may be expressed as the disjoint union of spectra @xmath42 and the natural projection @xmath43 from @xmath5 to @xmath8 is continuous and open @xcite .",

    "the fact that the action of @xmath0 on @xmath5 is well defined and is continuous is easily checked ( as in ( * ? ? ?",

    "our second hypothesis  is    [ hyp2]the action of @xmath0 on @xmath5 is free .    for @xmath6 ,",
    "we shall write @xmath51 for the quotient @xmath52 . then @xmath51 is well defined ( i.e. , it is independent of the choice of @xmath53 ) and is an elementary @xmath54-algebra .",

    "we will show that there is a positive number @xmath292 such that @xmath293 eventually , where @xmath294 denotes the positive part of the selfadjoint operator @xmath295 therefore , eventually @xmath296 assume that we have shown this , and set @xmath297{cc}% 0 , & t\\leq a\\\\ 2(t - a ) , & a\\leq t\\leq2a\\\\ t , & 2a \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ] then @xmath298 is a positive element in the pedersen ideal of @xmath299 , and so the function @xmath300@xmath301 is finite and continuous in @xmath143 , with value @xmath302 at @xmath276 .",
