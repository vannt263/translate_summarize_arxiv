    "the recent spaced - based studies of @xmath0sct and @xmath2dor stars have revealed that most of these stars pulsate with a multitude of pulsation modes in both the low and high - frequency regions ( uytterhoeven et al .",
    "2011 ) , where the gravity ( g ) and pressure ( p ) modes are found .",
    "the numerical relationships between many low and high frequencies indicate that it is not possible to treat these regions independently of each other .",
    "for example , the low - frequency region contains g - mode pulsations as well as rotation peaks ( balona 2011 , breger et al .",
    "2011 ) , while the high - frequency region contains p - modes as well as high - degree g - modes ( monnier et al .",
    "2010 , breger et al .",
    "regrettably , pulsation mode identifications are generally not available for these fainter stars studied from space ; consequently , frequency patterns have been the most valuable tool . in the present investigation",
    ", we add amplitude and phase variations as an additional method to determine the modal origin .",
    "the rapidly rotating ( @xmath3km / s ) hybrid @xmath0sct/@xmath2dor pulsator kic8054146 has been measured extensively by the _ kepler _ spacecraft .",
    "altogether , 349 statistically significant frequencies were determined from three years of short - cadence _ kepler _ data ( breger et al .",
    "2012 , hereafter paper 1 ) .",
    "the amplitudes ranged from about 2 ppm ( parts - per - million ) to 200 ppm .",
    "the excellent frequency resolution of three years of data for kic8054146 also revealed that many frequencies are related over and beyond the expected simple harmonics and combinations .",
    "in fact , three separate families of frequencies spanning a 200 cycles day@xmath1 frequency range have been discovered so far . within each family ,",
    "the amplitude variations of the low - frequency members correlate with those of the high - frequency members .",
    "the unprecedented accuracy of the _ kepler _ allows us examine the physical origin of these families in detail .",
    "one of these families could already be interpreted as high - degree prograde kelvin modes ( breger et al .",
    "2013 ) .",
    ".dominant frequencies of the `` t '' family [ cols= \" < , < , > , < \" , ]     in a few amplitude spectra combining data from different quarters ( e.g. , q11 to q14 ) for increased frequency resolution , we see a small side - peak or asymmetry near 2.933 cycles day@xmath1 , which is caused by the ( smaller ) coupling of f63 with f60 .",
    "because this peak is uncertain , we have concentrated on the dominant 2.9305 cycles day@xmath1 peak .",
    "we have tested five models : ( i ) mode coupling between all three components of triplet 1 with a random - walk - type addition of the amplitudes of f66/f63 and f63/f60 , ( ii ) mode coupling between f66 and f63 of triplet 1 , ( iii ) amplitude scaling of only the central mode of triplet 1 , since that mode is responsible for most of the amplitude variations , ( iv ) mode coupling between the three components of triplet 2 , and ( v ) assuming that 5.86 cycles day@xmath1 is a harmonic of 2.93 cycles day@xmath1 , i.e. scaling the observed amplitudes of the 5.86 cycles day@xmath1 peak .",
    "lllll f34 & triplet 2 & f60  f26 & f26 * f60 & f60  f26 + f37 & triplet 2 & f63  f26 & f26 * f63 & f63  f26 + f40 & triplet 2 & f66  f26 & f26 * f66 & f66  f26 + f6 & low frequency & f66  f60 & f66 * f60 & f66  f60 + f3 , f3b & low frequency doublet & f66  f63 , f63  f60 & f66*f63 , f60*f63 & ... + f86 & triplet 3 & f60 + f26 & ... & ... + f92 & triplet 3 & f66 + f26 & f26 * f66 & ...    the results for the different quarters ( q5 to q14 ) are shown in table 2 .",
    "the first two models track the observed variations well , as expected from the mode - coupling model",
    ". we can immediately eliminate the triplet 2 model as well as the hypothesis that the 5.86 cycles day@xmath1 peak is a harmonic of the 2.93 cycles day@xmath1 peak .",
    "the mode coupling of triplet 1 with f26 results in triplet 2 as well as two dominant low frequencies .",
    "this represents the frequency - difference term of the mode - coupling equation ( eq .  [ freq ] ) .",
    "the mode - coupling equation also predicts the possibility of a frequency - sum term , i.e. , an additional triplet at very high frequencies .",
    "these components would be found at 86.3855 , 89.3189 and 92.2497 cycles day@xmath1 ( hereafter called f86 , f89 , and f92 ) .",
    "two of these predicted modes from the third triplet were detected before with small amplitudes in our analysis of the q5 to q10 data , which reported 349 statistically significant frequencies .",
    "we detected frequencies of 86.3858 @xmath4 0.0003 and 92.2497 @xmath4 0.0002 cycles day@xmath1 , which are in excellent agreement with the predictions from the present mode - coupling model .",
    "the amplitude signal / noise ratios were 4.7 and 7.1 , respectively .",
    "these values represent a statistically significant detection ( breger et al .",
    "the f89 mode was not seen and is probably hidden in the noise .",
    "the mode - coupling model also predicts the shape of the amplitude variability of the triplet 3 modes .",
    "only f92 has an amplitude large enough to examine its variability on a quarterly basis .",
    "we find a variation from 1.6 to 5.4 ppm from q5 to q14 .",
    "this variation accurately tracks the predicted changes of amplitude .",
    "we find an average deviation between the predicted and observed amplitude of only @xmath4 0.4 ppm per quarter .",
    "( at first sight , such extremely small deviations may be appear unrealistic , since the formal uncertainty in the quarterly amplitude solution is 1 ppm .",
    "however , the calculation of the formal uncertainties assumes white noise .",
    "the real noise at such high frequencies is much lower . )    thus , not only did the mode coupling model predict the existence of these additional frequencies , it correctly predicted the amplitude variation of the only component of the new third triplet for which this test could be made .",
    "we summarize our results in table 3 .",
    "combination modes are usually observed in a / f stars , i.e. , two simultaneously excited modes f@xmath5 and f@xmath6 lead to ( f@xmath5 @xmath4 f@xmath6 ) , observed at small amplitudes .",
    "( note that these frequencies , commonly called combination modes , may not be normal modes , but nonlinearities in the star . )",
    "a typical example is the star 44 tau , in which combinations of different @xmath7 values are detected ( breger & lenz 2008 ) . to quantify the size of these combination amplitudes we introduce the parameter @xmath8 , defined as follows : @xmath9 where @xmath10 and @xmath11 are the amplitudes of the parent modes ( in fractions ) .",
    "typical values of @xmath8 are found to be about 4 , which has also been seen in other stars ( @xmath8 is observed to lie within a factor of 2 of this value ) .",
    "furthermore , the amplitudes of the ( f@xmath5 - f@xmath6 ) combinations are generally slightly smaller than those of ( f@xmath5 + f@xmath6 ) .",
    "we have already noted earlier that kic8054146 exhibits many of these typical combination frequencies and their small amplitudes are typical for @xmath0 scuti stars .",
    "we can now compare the values above to those found for the coupled modes in kic8054146 .",
    "there is a wide range of @xmath8 values ranging from 7000 to 60000 for triplet 2 , and 11000 for the 5.86 cycles",
    "day@xmath1 low frequency .",
    "even for the small - amplitude upper component of triplet 3 , we find a value near 700 .",
    "we conclude that the observed coupling coefficients in this star are three to four orders of magnitude larger than those observed in other @xmath0  scuti stars .",
    "this makes it unlikely that these frequencies are produced by the same mechanism that generates combination frequencies in other @xmath0 scuti stars .",
    "the only way to rescue the combination hypothesis involves fortuitous geometry .",
    "in photometry we measure the integrated light across the visible disk . for nonradial modes ,",
    "the observed amplitudes of pulsation suffer from cancellation effects due to this integration .",
    "if a star is viewed nearly equator on , the measured amplitude of a nonradial @xmath7 = 1 , @xmath12 = 0 mode , for example , will be severely decreased . in the present discussion , we eliminated the combination - mode hypothesis because the observed amplitudes of the coupled modes were too large by about four orders of magnitude",
    ". could it be that instead the observed amplitudes of one or more parents are too small by these huge factors , i.e. , that the star is seen essentially exactly equator - on ?",
    "let us assume that one of the parent modes actually has an amplitude larger by four orders of magnitude .",
    "inspection of fig .",
    "2 shows that in this case , the intrinsic amplitude of the parent mode would be much larger than any known amplitude for a rapidly rotating @xmath0 scuti star .",
    "moreover , at least one of the parent modes of each of the coupled mode frequencies reported in this paper would also have to suffer from such geometric cancellation .",
    "consequently , we find the combination - mode hypothesis as well as the cancellation argument very improbable .",
    "the nearly equidistant spacing of the parent triplet identified in section  3 must be a result of the underlying frequency spectrum in the star . and , if the higher frequency child triplet is due to resonant mode coupling , then the star must have eigenfrequencies very close to these values as well , i.e.",
    ", this second equally - spaced triplet must also exist in the eigenfrequency spectrum of the star .    for a non - rotating star ,",
    "the frequency spectrum of p  modes in the asymptotic limit is given by @xmath13 where @xmath14^{-1}\\ ] ] is the inverse sound crossing time and we have ignored the small separation @xcite .",
    "thus , modes differing by @xmath15 or @xmath16 would appear nearly equally spaced .",
    "as it turns out , a modified form of equation  [ asymp ] exists for the case of rapid rotation : @xmath17 where @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and the coefficients @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 all depend on the structure of the star . @xcite . for this case we again see that evenly spaced modes can be produced by @xmath23 or @xmath24 modes .",
    "thus , evenly spaced modes can be a natural consequence of rapid rotation in this star .      small amplitude modulations of p - modes , caused by rotation , have been detected before and may be very common even in normal a and f stars , e. g. , in kic9700322 ( breger et al .",
    "the 2.93 cycles day@xmath1 peak would be the rotation frequency , which would agree with the known high measured stellar rotation ( paper i ) , while 5.86 cycles day@xmath1 would be the 2f harmonic .",
    "the problem of rotational frequency peaks with f and 2f of similar amplitudes has been noted before ( balona 2011 ) and awaits explanations .",
    "the upper and lower components of triplets 1 and 2 would be caused by the rotational amplitude modulation of the central component .",
    "this attractive hypothesis fails because the side peaks associated with the amplitude modulation are not symmetric and at most times are larger than the actual pulsation itself .",
    "it might be argued that kic 8054146 is unusual or unique due to its very high stellar rotation of @xmath25 = 300 km s@xmath1 ( paper i ) and almost equidistant frequency triplets .",
    "however , many of the properties shown by this star are shared by other stars of spectral type a / f . in this discussion , let us ignore `` normal '' combinations , @xmath26 - @xmath27 , where @xmath28 and @xmath29 are the frequencies of two pulsation modes with the combination frequencies having much smaller amplitudes than @xmath30 and @xmath31 .",
    "related frequency peaks of similar amplitudes have been seen before in a number of a / f stars , even between the low - frequency and high - frequency regions .",
    "the present results on kic 8054146 are unusual because the parent and child ( coupled ) modes could be uniquely identified : any two of four identified parent frequencies ( triplet 1 and 25.95 cycles day@xmath1 ) can correctly predict the variable amplitudes of a number of other frequencies .    let us compare kic 8054146 with two other a / f stars .",
    "our unpublished analysis of kic 9664869 also shows equidistant frequency spacings and corresponding relationships between low and high frequencies with relatively high amplitudes .",
    "however , the available data are insufficient to use the amplitude variations to separate the parent from the child modes .",
    "balona et al .",
    "( 2013 ) studied the roap star kic 8677585 .",
    "as in kic 8054146 , the value of the dominant low frequency corresponds to the spacing of some high - frequency modes .",
    "furthermore , it shares the amplitude and frequency variations of a high - frequency mode at 140.1 cycles day@xmath1 , suggestive of nonlinear interactions .",
    "note that in kic 8054146 , such a similarity with the behavior of a single mode is only superficial and the variations of the low - frequency peak are matched accurately only by the coupling of @xmath32 parent modes .",
    "however , the data ( and amplitudes ) for kic 8677585 are insufficient to test mode coupling between two modes and identify the parents .",
    "until more data of such other intriguing pulsators become available , the main result of the present paper can not be fully tested in other stars .",
    "the amplitude variability on a time scale of years found in kic 8054146 is not unique either for nonradial or even for some radial modes .",
    "an example is the star 4 cvn ( breger 2009 ) , for which systematic changes as a function of the azimuthal number , @xmath12 , were detected over 40 years .",
    "let us now turn to the relatively high frequencies of the parent triplet 1 ( 60 , 63 and 66 cycles day@xmath1 ) .",
    "are they unusually high for a @xmath0 sct star ?",
    "they certainly do not fit the `` classical '' picture of stellar excitation shown by the hads , the slowly rotating high - amplitude - delta scuti stars . in this picture ,",
    "pulsation is excited to high amplitude in a narrow range of frequencies corresponding to low - order radial modes .",
    "however , using ground - based telescopes , rodrguez et al . ( 2007 ) already showed that in the hads star bl cam , low - amplitude nonradial modes were detected up to 79 cycles day@xmath1 .",
    "these were explained by breger et al .",
    "( 2009 ) as nonradial modes trapped in the envelope of the star .",
    "the accurate , recent observations by @xmath33 and @xmath34 have further supported the detection of high - frequency oscillations in @xmath0 sct stars , e.g. , see the catalog by uytterhoeven et al .",
    "we note here that some of the high frequencies listed in the catalog are low - amplitude combination frequencies , rather than independent pulsation modes .",
    "also , some frequency peaks may actually be low frequencies in the stellar frame of reference , shifted to high frequencies in the observer s frame of reference due to rotational splitting ( breger et al . 2013 ) .",
    "consequently , the detected high frequencies should be individually examined for each star .",
    "nevertheless , based on the recent observations of a multitude of @xmath0 sct stars , the frequencies of the triplet 1 near 63 cycles day@xmath1 , which is the main mode - coupling parent in kic 8054146 , is not unusual . furthermore , present models of pulsation instability as a function of frequency confirm that high frequencies can indeed be excited ( daszynska - daszkiewicz et al .",
    "2005 , 2006 ) , but the results depend critically on the treatment of convection .    we conclude that while kic 8054146 may be the first @xmath0 sct star for which mode coupling and the identification of the parents and the children are reported , many of the star s properties are shared by other @xmath0 sct stars . at this stage ,",
    "considerably more data are required in order to test the mode - coupling hypothesis for these stars .",
    "for kic 8054146 we identify coupled modes and can uniquely distinguish which are the parent and child modes .",
    "this is made possible by the fact that for the simplest , lowest - order mode coupling the amplitudes of the coupled modes are given by the product of the amplitudes of the parents .",
    "we speculate that the simple mode - coupling model is applicable due to the relatively small amplitudes and therefore lowest - order nonlinear interaction of the modes involved .",
    "consequently , the present study is only made possible by the excellent time coverage and precision of the data from the _ kepler _ spacecraft .",
    "we note that the generally unknown mode - coupling constants do not present a problem for kic 8054146 due to the large amount of amplitude variability over the three years of data ; a single short stretch of data allows us to derive the mode - coupling coefficients , which subsequent data groups show to be constant .      1 .",
    "we detect `` normal '' nonlinearities in this star ; these are combination frequencies for which the amplitudes are related by @xmath35 , where @xmath8 is @xmath36 .",
    "these small nonlinearities are commonly seen in most if not all delta scuti stars .",
    "kic 8054146 also possesses larger - amplitude nonlinear signals , and we are able to use the measured amplitude and phase variations of these signals to determine which modes are the `` parent '' modes and which are the `` child '' modes . the derived value of @xmath8 relating the amplitudes of child and parent modes is @xmath37 to 10,000 or more .    a generic nonlinear model ( such as the nonlinear relation between temperature and flux at the surface ) is not able to simultaneously produce both these `` small '' and `` large '' nonlinearities . on the other hand ,",
    "if a subset of the combination frequencies lie close to eigenfrequencies in the star , then these modes and only these modes can be resonantly driven to larger amplitudes . while this is far from the last word on the subject , the data are fully consistent with this `` resonant mode coupling '' scenario .",
    "in particular , the present investigation showed that in kic 8054146 , two dominant low frequencies are actually coupled modes with amplitudes larger or equal to those of the dominant parents in the higher - frequency domain .",
    "the low - frequency region of these so - called hybrid pulsators contains a large number of linearly driven gravity modes , as was confirmed by chapellier et al .",
    "( 2012 ) from searching for equidistant period spacings in i d 105733033 .",
    "furthermore , in a number of hybrid pulsators , some frequency values in the gravity - mode and pressure - mode domains are numerically not independent of each other . given the existence of these gravity modes , we speculate that these could be the `` child '' modes that are resonantly excited to larger amplitudes . a confirmation of this resonance explanation would be provided if additional data could reveal that these particular low frequencies are part of a sequence of low - frequency modes equidistantly spaced in period .",
