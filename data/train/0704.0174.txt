    "the criticism relies heavily on the statistical treatment of data : frequentist vs. bayesian .",
    "the answer of the utfit collaboration @xcite rises some interesting points , both on the interpretation of the results and on the importance of the physical assumptions on the hadronic amplitudes .",
    "the authors of @xcite have recently answered to this utfit reply in @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present work is to clarify several issues central to an adequate understanding of the physics at stake .",
    "we also want to call the attention on the importance of reparametrization invariance ( rpi ) in the sense introduced by f.j.b . and j. silva in reference @xcite to do so .",
    "we will not enter the polemic arena of statistical confrontation . with regard to this",
    ", we will instead illustrate the compatibility of results obtained in both approaches as long as things are done properly ; notwithstanding , we will not ignore some `` obscure '' aspects of both approaches that are somehow swept under the rug as the statistical confrontation rages on , they illustrate that rather than sticking to one approach and deprecating the other it may be wiser to learn lessons from both .",
    "this work is organized as follows .",
    "we start section [ sec:02 ] with a short reminder on reparametrization invariance and its implications , then we use the exclusion or inclusion of @xmath13 data together with rpi to clarify the origin of our knowledge on @xmath0 . in section [ sec:04:0 ]",
    "we study critically standard model inspired parametrizations .",
    "we devote section [ sec:03 ] to a detailed analysis of the impact on the results of allowed ranges for some parameters .",

    "if , experimentally , the direct cp asymmetry @xmath35 is @xmath36 , then the decay amplitudes can be expressed in terms of a single weak phase , which could be sensibly extracted , up to discrete ambigities , through the indirect cp asymmetry @xmath37 . additionally , if the theoretical description of the decay amplitudes only involves a single weak phase from a basic lagrangian , then it can be identified with the phase measured through @xmath38 .",
    "as we will see , this two results apply respectively to the @xmath39 and @xmath40 channels .",
    "essentially , the first one will be operative in the @xmath4 piece and the second one in the @xmath2 .      to make our point transparent",
    "we will start by studying the extraction  in fact the _ non - extraction _  of @xmath0 from @xmath11 data when @xmath13 experimental information is removed .",
    "let us start with a widely used @xcite , standard model inspired , parametrization of the decay amplitudes : @xmath42 when @xmath43 experimental information is removed we have two _ decoupled _ decays :    1 .",
    "@xmath40 data , i.e. the average branching ratio @xmath44 and the direct cp asymmetry @xmath45 , provide , respectively , @xmath46 and a consistency check @xmath47 ; @xmath0 is _ irrelevant _ there .",

    "even worse , reparametrization invariance @xcite tells us that @xmath58 can also be written as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is any weak phase  known or unknown , @xmath61 . in this scenario the conclusion is clear : _ any _ information one would get for @xmath0 would also be valid for _ any _ @xmath60 and thus it can not be assigned to @xmath0 .",
    "this solves the puzzle raised in the ma and ri parametrizations within figure 4 of reference @xcite : those pdfs can not be attributable to @xmath0 . just with that data alone",
    "we can not extract @xmath60  whatever it is  , as we have emphasized in [ ssec:02:00 ] . to illustrate this issue we compute the pdfs of figure [ fig : alpha : alphaprime:01 ] in the following parametrization : @xmath62 notice that just with @xmath63 , eq .

    "when we incorporate @xmath13 data to the isospin construction , @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) gives the angle among @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) and @xmath72 ( @xmath73 ) ; using then the known phase difference between @xmath72 and @xmath73 , the angle among @xmath70 and @xmath71 is obtained .",

    "unfortunately the isospin analysis as explained above yields allowed values for @xmath0 spanning a wide range .",

    "in this situation @xmath75 do not really fix the hadronic parameters and , consequently , they tend to generate a spurious pdf for @xmath0 as we have seen .",
    "the final `` @xmath0 '' is thus a sort of convolution of the @xmath0 obtained from the isospin analysis and the spurious one `` extracted '' purely from @xmath39 data .",

    "the results shown in figures [ fig : alpha : alphaprime:01 ] , [ fig : alpha : alphaprime:02 ] and [ fig : alpha : alphaprime:03 ] deserve some comment :    1 .",
    "figures [ fig : alpha : alphaprime:01b ] and [ fig : alpha : alphaprime:02b ] are almost identical ; in the former we were not using @xmath13 information while in the later we were doing so .",

    "figure [ fig : alpha : alphaprime:02d ] is the cut of the joint pdf in figure [ fig : alpha : alphaprime:02c ] along the line @xmath63 .",
    "therefore the so called ma extraction of @xmath0 is a sort of convolution of the gronau - london @xmath0  figure [ fig : alpha : alphaprime:02a ]  and the spurious one .",
    "3 .   this @xmath60 pdf basically allows any value of @xmath60 except the neighborhoods of @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which are a priori forbidden by @xmath78 : obviously there is no way to produce cp violation in the @xmath39 channel without two weak phases in the amplitude that controls it .",

    "the main lesson from the previous example is : @xmath0 is obtained from purely @xmath2 amplitudes , without additional _ hadronic _ input . including it in @xmath4 pieces , as reparametrization invariance shows ,",

    "in section [ ssec:02:02 ] we used the parametrization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : alphaprime : parametrization ] ) to obtain figure [ fig : alpha : alphaprime:02 ] with flat @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath65 , @xmath141 , @xmath142 , @xmath0 and @xmath60 priors . for completness",
    "we also show  figure [ fig : ri ]  the pdfs of @xmath0 , @xmath60 and @xmath63 in case one uses flat @xmath51 , @xmath143}}$ ] , @xmath144}}$ ] , @xmath145}}$ ] , @xmath146}}$ ] , @xmath0 and @xmath60 priors . beside the effect of the spurious @xmath60 in the pdf of @xmath63",
    ", we can also appreciate the influence of the change in the priors : the integration domain is the same as in figure [ fig : alpha : alphaprime:02 ] but the integration measure is now different . the main effect is the relative enhancement of the contributions from regions with large parameters , including the contributions from the @xmath109 driven region .",
    "leaving completely aside philosophical aspects of probability , both frequentist and bayesian approaches start with a common likelihood function .",
    "each approach reduces the information provided by the likelihood function in a different manner .",
    "consequently , they do not yield strictly coincident results :    * bayesian posteriors obviously depend on the priors , for example the allowed ranges or the shape .",
    "as we have seen , we obtain different posteriors with different priors .",
    "however , as long as one is using sensible parametrizations and reasonable priors , we end up finding rather compatible results . *",
    "frequentist cl curves do depend on the parametrization , to be precise , they depend on the allowed ranges for the parameters ; once sensible parametrizations and adequate ranges are used , cl curves obtained with them are identical .",
    "the @xmath106 limit in the sm inspired parametrization of eq .",
    "( [ eq : smparam ] ) illustrates this issue .      1",
    ".   most probable values in the bayesian pdfs do not coincide with the analytical solutions for @xmath0 .",
    "2 .   intimately related to this aspect ,",
    "bayesian pdfs seem unable to distinguish among degenerate solutions .",
    "we remind that these statements concern one dimensional pdfs of @xmath0 .",
    "frequentist one dimensional cl curves distinguish @xmath0 solutions because they are obtained through best fitting points for fixed @xmath0 .",
    "bayesian pdfs do not distinguish them as the uncertainties produce distributions for the degenerate solutions which overlap and add up in the complete pdf .",
    "one can still have a hint of the proximity of different solutions from this kind of overlap , but this is not the point here .",
    "for reduced experimental uncertainties , bayesian pdfs would not overlap and would distinguish among those different solutions .",
    "this could be sufficient to think that , _ per se _ , there is no discriminating advantage in using one or the other approach . with present uncertainties ,",
    "bayesian analyses seem incapable of pinning down the right location of the solutions in @xmath0 and telling us something about their degeneracy .",
    "it is not a fundamental problem of bayesian methods as reduced uncertainties would overcome these `` difficulties '' .",
    "if it is not a fundamental problem , could we somehow overcome these `` difficulties '' with present uncertainties ?",
    "the answer is in the positive as the problem only arises because we are insisting in the reduction of the available experimental information to obtain one - dimensional pdfs of @xmath0 ; let us take a look to the joint pdfs in figure [ fig : joint ] .",
    "these are the joint pdfs of @xmath147 and @xmath148 obtained with the pld parametrization .",
    "they are quite illustrative , one can see the different solutions in @xmath0 concentrated around the values of @xmath0 dictated by the analytical expectations .",
    "the pretended fundamental drawbacks of bayesian methods to adequately place and distinguish the solutions are just a consequence of pushing too far , for the present level of experimental uncertainty in the results , the statistical `` reduction of information process '' . a simultaneous look to both frequentist and bayesian results will not put an end to the statistical discrepancies , notwithstanding it will be very helpful to understand the physical results we are interested in .",
    "both approaches are `` information reduction processes '' and strictly sticking to one and deprecating the other may not be the wiser strategy .",
