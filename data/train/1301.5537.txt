    "<S> the quantum mechanical approach to the well known prisoners dilemma , one of the basic examples to illustrate the concepts of game theory , is implemented with a classical optical resource , nonquantum entanglement between spin and orbital degrees of freedom of laser modes . </S>",
    "<S> the concept of entanglement is crucial in the quantum version of the game , which brings novel features with a richer universe of strategies . as we show </S>",
    "<S> , this richness can be achieved in a quite unexpected context , namely that of paraxial spin - orbit modes in classical optics .    </S>",
    "<S> numerous quantum information protocols rely on entanglement , a property usually attributed to composite quantum systems that can not be described by a tensor product state vector . </S>",
    "<S> quantum cryptography and teleportation are popular examples of protocols relying on quantum entanglement . while this property is considerably sensitive to local measurements performed in each party of the composite system , it is unaffected by local unitary operations . </S>",
    "<S> teleportation protocols , for example , are achieved by classical communication followed by local unitary operations and measurements . </S>",
    "<S> this framework is where quantum mechanics meets an important area of applied mathematics , the game theory , a powerful tool for decision making @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> , two or more agents ( players ) take their decisions by acting on a quantum system with unitary operations . </S>",
    "<S> these decisions or conflict situations can be as simple as tossing a coin@xcite or rather involved like the so - called minority game @xcite , where one models a competition among several players for a limited resource . in this sense games </S>",
    "<S> can be cooperative or non - cooperative like the prisoners dilemma , and with complete ( incomplete ) information where one player knows ( does not know ) all strategies his opponent can choose . </S>",
    "<S> quantum versions of this game was realized experimentally both with nuclear magnetic resonance @xcite and entangled photon pairs @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> although frequently attributed to quantum systems , entanglement has been recently identified in classical optics as the coherent superposition of paraxial modes with orthogonal spatial profiles and orthogonal polarizations . </S>",
    "<S> we shall refer to such superpositions as _ spin - orbit modes_. these modes were used in our group as a classical optical resource to investigate the topological phase acquired by an entangled state following a cyclic evolution under local unitary operations @xcite and to demonstrate alignment free bb84 quantum cryptography ref.@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> also , a spin - orbit bell inequality has been investigated both in the quantum @xcite and classical @xcite domains . </S>",
    "<S> an important tool for spin - orbit coupling was used in ref.@xcite to exchange quantum information between these two degrees of freedom . in a recent work @xcite the term _ nonquantum entanglement _ </S>",
    "<S> has been coined to designate the spin - orbit inseparability of paraxial modes in connection with the mueller matrices employed in polarization optics . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we demonstrate how this kind of nonquantum entanglement can be used to evaluate the performance of quantum strategies in a classical example of game theory , the prisoners dilemma .    </S>",
    "<S> a laser beam propagating along the @xmath0 direction is usually described by its polarization unit vector @xmath1 and its spatial mode @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> the spatial modes in rectangular coordinates are hermite - gaussian ( hg ) solutions of the paraxial wave equation described in many text books @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the subspace of first order spatial modes has a qubit structure similar to the polarization mode space , where hg modes along different orientations play the role of linear polarizations and the laguerre - gaussian ( lg ) modes are equivalent to circular polarization @xcite . by combining the two mode spaces , </S>",
    "<S> a general spin - orbit mode can be written as @xmath3 where @xmath4 are linear polarization unit vectors along the horizontal ( vertical ) directions , and @xmath5 are hg spatial modes along these same directions . in analogy to the usual entanglement measure used for bipartite quantum states @xcite , we can define the spin - orbit mode concurrence , which for eq.([spmode ] ) is @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> we shall refer to the spin - orbit modes with maximal concurrence @xmath7 as maximally entangled modes . in these modes neither the polarization nor the spatial profile is well defined , in fact they correspond to polarization vortices which have been extensively studied due to their potential applications to high resolution microscopy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in this work we demonstrate another appealing feature in the unexpected context of a quantum game . </S>",
    "<S> an example of such entangled spin - orbit mode is @xmath8 we use this mode to implement a classical optical version of the well known prisoners dilemma , in which two players , alice and bob , accused of a felony , have to decide whether they cooperate ( @xmath9 ) or defeat ( @xmath10 ) each other . </S>",
    "<S> in classical game theory , each agent decision is represented by one bit of information with possible states @xmath9 and @xmath10 . depending on their decision </S>",
    "<S> , a reduced penalty may be applied to each one of them . </S>",
    "<S> the penalty reduction is the payoff each player gets from their combined decisions . </S>",
    "<S> the penalty reductions for both players are shown in table [ redtab ] for all possible strategies adopted by alice ( rows ) and bob ( columns ) .    </S>",
    "<S> .penalty reduction table [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     from the table we see that both players are tempted to choose @xmath10 , although their added reduction would be maximized by @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> here comes the dilemma , the players are isolated without the permission to negotiate . </S>",
    "<S> each player is left to his own and has to decide whether to defeat or cooperate with the other , a bad choice may cost his freedom . for a cooperative game , players would choose strategies which maximize both payoffs , i.e. , they would search for pareto optimal strategies ; on the other hand , since prisoners dilemma is a non - cooperative game , each player will try to maximize solely his own payoff , i.e. , the intelligent choice is the nash equilibrium @xmath12 . at this point , </S>",
    "<S> the concepts of game theory are due . </S>",
    "<S> suppose this situation is repeated many times and the players adopt probabilistic strategies , that is , they randomly choose between @xmath9 and @xmath10 with prestablished probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> then , the payoff function of each player is given by the average penalty reduction obtained : @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath15 is the joint probability that alice chooses @xmath16 and bob chooses @xmath17 . in the classical approach to the problem , one shows that the payoff as a function of @xmath18 and @xmath19 has an absolute minimum at @xmath20 , that is the best the players can do is to defeat , as a consequence of the severe cost brought by a possible betrayment .    in ref.@xcite eisert proposes an ingenuous alternative to the classical approach , employing the concept of quantum entanglement . </S>",
    "<S> briefly , in this approach the prisoners share a pair of entangled qubits and rather than making a definite @xmath9 or @xmath10 statement , they are allowed to perform single qubit unitary operations ( strategies ) , each one on the qubit in his possession . </S>",
    "<S> the entangled two - qubit state is prepared by a nonlocal operation @xmath21 \\label{u}\\ ] ] acting on an initial state @xmath22 , so that @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> after each player has applied his own strategy @xmath24 ( @xmath14 ) , the qubits are nonlocally operated with @xmath25 and separately measured . </S>",
    "<S> the payoff function ( [ payoff ] ) is evaluated with the probabilities @xmath26 ( @xmath27 ) associated with the two possible outcomes ( @xmath9 or @xmath10 ) in each qubit . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the strategy space is much larger in this quantum approach , it corresponds to the space of @xmath28 matrices , apart from irrelevant global phases . </S>",
    "<S> this quantum version has been implemented experimentally with quantum correlated photon pairs generated by parametric down conversion @xcite .        </S>",
    "<S> we now demonstrate the implementation of the quantum game strategies with the nonquantum entanglement provided by the spin - orbit classical mode ( [ psi0 ] ) . in the game language , </S>",
    "<S> we shall make the identification @xmath29 and @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental setup is shown in fig.([setup ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> the tem@xmath31 output of a he - ne laser is diffracted by a hologram that generates an hg mode on the first diffraction order , so that the initial spin - orbit mode is @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> this mode is first sent to a quarter wave plate ( qwp ) rotated at @xmath33 , which makes the transformation @xmath34 , and then to a mach - zehnder ( mz ) interferometer with input and output polarizing beam splitters ( pbs ) . </S>",
    "<S> a dove prism ( dp ) is inserted in one arm of the mz interferometer , and the relative phase @xmath35 between the two arms is controlled by a piezoelectric transducer ( pzt ) . </S>",
    "<S> the dp oriented at @xmath33 makes the transformation @xmath36 , so that this mz interferometer coherently superposes modes @xmath37 and @xmath32 at its output with an adjustable phase @xmath35 . in the basis @xmath38 , </S>",
    "<S> the matrix representation of the mz transformation is : @xmath39\\ ; , \\label{mz}\\ ] ] so that after passing through the qwp and the balanced interferometer ( @xmath40 ) , the beam is prepared in mode ( [ psi0 ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> this mode is the object on which the players will implement their strategies .    in order to continue our experimental description , </S>",
    "<S> it is essential to define the mode converter operators which will be used to implement the players strategies and @xmath25 </S>",
    "<S> . we will be dealing with either polarization ( wave plates ) or spatial ( dp and cylindrical lenses ) mode converters , that is , elements acting on one degree of freedom only . </S>",
    "<S> we shall inform rotation angles in degrees and phase retardations in radians for immediate identification of the physical meaning all over the experimental description . </S>",
    "<S> when oriented along horizontal and vertical directions , they introduce a retardation phase @xmath35 between @xmath41 and @xmath42 modes . </S>",
    "<S> a mode converter rotated by the angle @xmath43 is described by the @xmath44 matrix : @xmath45\\;. \\label{c}\\ ] ] for example , quarter wave plates correspond to @xmath46 and half wave plates ( hwp ) to @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> spatial mode converters can be made with cylindrical lenses @xcite for variable retardation @xmath35 , or the dp for @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> now , alice is equipped with polarization elements and realizes strategies of the kind @xmath48 , whereas bob is equipped with dps and cylindrical lenses , and his strategies are @xmath49 . </S>",
    "<S> after the players have made their choices , the spin - orbit mode of the laser beam is : @xmath50 \\mathbf{\\psi}_0(\\mathbf{r } ) \\;. </S>",
    "<S> \\label{psi1}\\ ] ] the mode converters are also used together with @xmath51 to implement @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , one can easily show that : @xmath52\\,mz(\\pi/2)\\ ; , \\label{udagger}\\ ] ] which physically means that , after passing through the players strategies , the beam is sent through a mz interferometer with a @xmath53 phase shift , a quarter wave plate ( qwp ) rotated at @xmath54 , and another mz interferometer with balanced arms ( @xmath40 ) , where it gets transformed to mode @xmath55 where @xmath56 and @xmath57 .    </S>",
    "<S> after this transformation , we arrive at the measurement stage where the probabilities @xmath58 used in the payoff function eq.([payoff ] ) are obtained . in our setup , these probabilities are given by the projected intensities : @xmath59\\right\\rvert}^2 \\ ; , \\label{pmn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which , in fact , correspond to photodetection probabilities when the beam is attenuated down to the single photon regime . in order to measure the projected intensities , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath60 mode is first sent to a pbs where polarization projection is performed . </S>",
    "<S> then , each pbs output is sent to a balanced mach - zehnder interferometer with an additional mirror in one arm ( mzim ) , where spatial mode projection occurs @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the projected intensities are measured at the four outputs of the two mzims either with a ccd camera or with photodetectors . </S>",
    "<S> the payoff function is evaluated with the intensities measured with four photodetectors . </S>",
    "<S> the background noise is subtracted and the partial intensities are then normalized to the total intensity so that @xmath61 .        for each player , we implemented five different strategies : @xmath62 , @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , and @xmath66 . in this notation @xmath67 and @xmath68 </S>",
    "<S> are the usual pauli matrices . </S>",
    "<S> strategies @xmath69 and @xmath70 are equivalent to the classical ones where the players can only cooperate or defeat , while the other strategies are intrinsically quantum mechanical since they involve rotations and phase retardations not available in the classical scenario . </S>",
    "<S> a table with the coefficients @xmath71 resulting from these strategies is shown in fig.([tables]a ) . </S>",
    "<S> also , the images obtained with the ccd camera are displayed in the same table format in fig.([tables]b ) . as expected , </S>",
    "<S> only those output ports corresponding to nonzero coefficients are illuminated . in this sense , </S>",
    "<S> the qualitative agreement between the two tables is clear . </S>",
    "<S> we have also evaluated alice s payoff as a function of the strategy parameters @xmath72 and @xmath73 in the domain @xmath74 and @xmath75 . </S>",
    "<S> the analytical result is shown in fig.([figpayoff ] ) together with the points corresponding to all possible combinations of the experimental strategies . </S>",
    "<S> the experimental values were obtained from the intensity measurements , where the relative intensities play the role of measurement probabilities . </S>",
    "<S> we observe , from both theoretical and experimental results , that the quantum move @xmath76 proposed originally in @xcite dominates all classical ones and it is also a nash equilibrium with a better outcome than @xmath77 since no player can improve his respective payoff by changing unilaterally his strategy . </S>",
    "<S> note also that if bob could choose only between classical @xmath78 or @xmath79 , and alice keep @xmath80 then it would be better for him to cooperate since his payoff would be increased .     and @xmath73 . </S>",
    "<S> dots correspond to the experimental values obtained with the intensity measurements . ]    in conclusion , we have used the concept of nonquantum entanglement to implement a game theory task in the context of the well known prisoners dilemma . </S>",
    "<S> the advantages offered by the quantum mechanical approach could be realized in the classical optics framework . </S>",
    "<S> nonseparable spin - orbit modes corresponding to polarization vortices were used . </S>",
    "<S> this implementation opens promising perspectives regarding potential applications of nonquantum entanglement to the investigation of quantum information protocols . </S>"
