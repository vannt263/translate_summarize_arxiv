    "strongly interacting many - fermion systems have been a theoretical challenge for decades . while the bardeen  cooper  schrieffer ( bcs ) , or mean - field ( mf ) , theory provides an excellent description of conventional metallic superconductors , it is still inappropriate for a large range of other systems , from high - temperature superconductors to nuclear ( and more recently , quark ) matter .",
    "great theoretical interest was triggered by the conjecture that when the interaction strength is increased , bcs - type superconductivity evolves smoothly to the bose ",
    "einstein condensation ( bec ) of tightly bound difermion molecules @xcite .",
    "the crucial observation in this respect was that the standard bcs superconducting ground state has the same form as the ground state of a condensed bose gas once the composite operator creating a cooper pair is identified with that of a bosonic quasiparticle .",
    "however , in spite of the successful unified description of bcs superconductivity and bec , a quantitative understanding of the crossover between the two regimes was missing .",
    "spectacular progress in this direction has been made in the past decade thanks to the experiments using ultracold atomic fermi gases @xcite . from the theorists point of view , these provide an ideal tool to test the developing many - body techniques . in particular , a lot of interest has been attracted by the transition regime between the bcs and bec limits  the unitary fermi gas . in this case , the two - body scattering length is much larger ( ideally infinite ) than any other characteristic scale of the system such as the interaction range and interparticle distance .",
    "this , on the one hand , leads to intriguing universal behavior with connections to other branches of physics such as the quark ",
    "gluon plasma or even string theory @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "it poses a challenging problem due to the lack of a small expansion parameter .",
    "several approaches have been suggested to deal with the fermi gas at large scattering length , including various self - consistent resummation techniques for the many - body green s functions @xcite or the scattering matrix @xcite , expansion in the dimensionality of the space @xcite , or the @xmath0 expansion @xcite .",
    "an early review of the many - body approaches to the crossover problem may be found in ref .",
    "the predictions of the analytic approximation schemes as well as the available experimental results are now being tested by increasingly precise numerical simulations @xcite .    also in high - energy physics has the mechanism of cooper pairing proven extremely fruitful .",
    "the nambu  jona - lasinio ( njl ) model @xcite , constructed in direct analogy with the bcs theory of superconductivity , was one of the first models of dynamical symmetry breaking . for its simplicity and generality",

    "antiparticle correlations , the true cooper pairing of two relativistic fermions near their fermi surface appears in dense quark matter , leading to the so - called color superconductivity @xcite ( see @xcite for a recent review ) .",
    "due to the strong - interaction nature of quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , quark matter at moderate densities is a typical example of a relativistic many - fermion system where a departure from the bcs - like behavior is to be expected .",
    "the early work in this respect focused on the structural change of cooper pairs at strong coupling and precursor phenomena above the critical temperature for the superconducting phase transition , in particular the appearance of the pseudogap in the spectrum @xcite .    in principle , the size of the qcd running coupling depends just on the energy / momentum scale and is thus fixed by the density of the quark matter .",
    "however , in order to better understand the strong - coupling effects in color superconductors , one often considers models with variable coupling strength where the full bcs  bec crossover can be studied @xcite . in the color superconductivity context , most of the calculations are still done using the mf approximation .",

    "we consider here the gas of two nonrelativistic fermion species ( `` flavors '' ) which will be referred to as @xmath1 and @xmath2 . for simplicity they will be assumed to have equal masses and chemical potentials ( and thus also densities )",

    "@xcite is that since the action is proportional to @xmath5 , the expansion of the partition function , or the thermodynamic potential , in powers of @xmath0 is equivalent to the expansion in loops . here and in the following",
    ", the term `` loop '' is used to refer to a bosonic loop , unless explicitly indicated otherwise .",
    "note that all loops containing fermions of the original theory are resummed into the action , i.e. , are included at the tree level with respect to bosons .",
    "obviously , the leading order ( lo ) of the @xmath0 expansion is equivalent to the saddle - point approximation to the functional integral , that is , the usual mf approximation .",

    "the way this extrapolation is performed is to be understood as a part of the definition of the method , which distinguishes it from other approaches with formally equivalent thermodynamic potential @xcite .    in general",
    "one calculates , in a given approximation scheme , the thermodynamic potential @xmath16 as a function of the anticipated vacuum expectation value @xmath17 of the field @xmath14 , and of the chemical potential @xmath18 .",
    "their actual values in thermodynamic equilibrium are then determined by a simultaneous solution of the gap and number equations , @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the total particle density , related to the fermi momentum @xmath21 by the usual expression , @xmath22 .",
    "it is well known that already at one - loop level , an attempt to solve the equations self - consistently leads to unphysical results , in particular the violation of the goldstone theorem @xcite .",

    "the reason , of course , is that the pairing effects are suppressed exponentially and finite - temperature effects are also suppressed by the exponentially small value of the critical temperature in the bcs limit , so that they are both completely negligible with respect to the perturbative corrections in eq .",

    "[ sec : nrgas ] we saw using the scaling of the thermodynamic potential that the @xmath0 expansion reproduces the mf approximation at the leading order .",

    "now since the boson is a singlet of the @xmath10 symmetry , each fermion bubble contributes a factor @xmath5 from the trace over the flavor space , thus compensating for factors @xmath0 coming from the coupling @xmath8 .",
    "the point is that when the boson becomes a tensor of @xmath71 rather than a singlet , the trace factors are lost , as is most easily visualized with the help of the double - line notation , see fig .",
    "[ fig : ladder ] ( a ) . as a consequence ,",

    "no , because the thermodynamic potential is dominated by the planar diagrams with a single fermion loop ( rather than the rpa ones ) , which contain the same number of flavor traces as the coupling factors , see fig .",

    "to that end , we need to supplement eq . with an analogous one - loop correction to particle density , which in turn yields the term @xmath57 in eq . .",
    "this is how the results presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : nr_tc ] were obtained .    on the contrary , in the full relativistic description the one - loop term in eq .",
    "is badly divergent .",
    "this is , of course , no surprise since in a relativistic scalar self - interacting field theory the one - loop tadpole graph has a quadratic divergence .",
    "nevertheless , this divergence has nothing in common with the many - body physics , and can be removed by renormalizing the parameters of the theory in the vacuum . in order to avoid this complication and also the interference of all energy scales from the high - energy vacuum physics down to the scale of cooper pairing , we resort to a high - density approximation @xcite , which is appropriate in the far bcs region where",
    "the pairing energy scale is well separated from the fermi scale .",
    "this approximation is at the mf level known to soften the ultraviolet divergences and give some cutoff - independent predictions such as the universal bcs ratio of the gap at zero temperature and the critical temperature @xcite .    in our one - loop calculation",
    "we have to be more careful .",
    "we therefore spell explicitly all simplifying assumptions that we make .",
    "first , we neglect antiparticle contributions",
    ". this can be appropriate even in the ultrarelativistic limit as long as the pairing gap / critical temperature is much smaller than the fermi energy so that the relevant excitations are the quasiparticles and quasiholes near the fermi surface . in a strongly coupled relativistic superconductor",
    ", the antiparticle effects may be non - negligible @xcite but will not change our conclusions qualitatively .",
    "second , we approximate , as usual , the volume measure for the integral over fermionic momentum by @xmath105 where @xmath106 is the energy with respect to the fermi level and @xmath107 is the density of states on the fermi surface .",
    "this brings in one subtlety . in a nonrenormalizable theory such as the njl model",
    ", there is an inherent ambiguity in the way we label internal propagators of the feynman graphs with momenta which satisfy momentum conservation in the interaction vertices .",
    "for instance , in the one - loop pairing susceptibility one often labels the propagators with @xmath108 instead of @xmath109 used here , and imposes a cutoff on the loop momentum @xmath110 .",
    "this ambiguity can be removed by a proper renormalization which makes the graph finite . however , once we make the above introduced replacement of the integration measure in the high - density approximation , the new measure is no longer translationally invariant .",
    "that is , _ the result depends on the momentum assignment to the propagators _ even in an otherwise finite loop integral . in eq .",
    "we chose the symmetric momentum assignment because it reduces cutoff dependence of the result and also leads to a physically intuitive suppression of the high - momentum pair modes by pauli blocking .",
    "third and most importantly , in order to retain in the calculation only the physically relevant degrees of freedom , we cut off the @xmath111 integration at the pairing scale , @xmath112 . in",
    "quark matter , such a cutoff is effectively introduced in terms of the momentum - dependent gap function by solving the qcd schwinger ",
    "dyson equations @xcite .",
    "in addition , a cutoff much smaller than the fermi energy is necessary in order to make the high - density approximation consistent @xcite . in practice , we verify that the results are not sensitive to a precise value of the cutoff by doing all calculations for two different values , @xmath113 and @xmath114 .",
    "fourth , once we restrict ourselves to the low - energy excitations about the fermi surface , we expand the dispersion relations in terms of the fermi velocity and an `` effective mass '' .",
    "this allows us to introduce efficiently dimensionless variables and treat on the same footing the nonrelativistic ( nr ) limit of sec .",

    ", @xmath123 is the angle between the vectors @xmath110 and @xmath124 , and the nonrelativistic chemical potential is understood in the first line , without specifying the subscript @xmath125 in the following . using this procedure",
    ", all integrals would factorize into a product of powers of the temperature and fermi velocity and a universal dimensionless function of the ratio @xmath126 , were it not for the coupling @xmath8 .",
    "the last step in the construction therefore has to be the renormalization of the bare coupling . in the context of atomic gases near unitarity",
    "it is customary to do this by fixing the @xmath3-wave scattering length at zero momentum in the vacuum as in eq . .",
    "however , in an effective description near the fermi surface , this is no longer convenient .",
    "we therefore renormalize the bare coupling with the help of the gap equation at zero temperature , which has the same divergence structure as the inverse propagator .",
    "this is effectively done by the replacement @xmath127 in the inverse propagator in the high - density approximation .",
    "now everything is expressed in terms of the dimensionless ratios @xmath126 and @xmath128 .",
    "the ratio @xmath126 is used as the input parameter which measures the strength of the interaction .",
    "the ratio @xmath128 is equal to the bcs value @xmath129 in the infinite - cutoff limit . with the explicit cutoff on the @xmath111-integration , we adjust the value of @xmath130 appropriately in order to ensure that the goldstone theorem is satisfied and the propagator has an exactly massless pole .    due to the explicit cutoff ,",
    "the loop part of the inverse propagator drops rapidly for external momenta larger than the cutoff as a result of pauli blocking .",
    "the boson propagator approaches a constant value , equal to @xmath44 .",
    "this is natural : at large momentum , pairing fluctuations are suppressed and the auxiliary field propagator recovers the original contact four - fermion interaction .",
    "in order that we really include just the effect of the fluctuations of the order parameter , we make in the second term of eq .",
    "the replacement @xmath131 in terms of feynman graphs , this means removing from the rpa series of diagrams the first , constant term , keeping all other terms that involve multiple rescattering of the two fermions in the pair . formally , this subtraction can be justified by observing that the diagram in fig .",
    "[ fig : box_diagram ] may also be viewed as a fermion loop with the insertion of a one - loop fermion self - energy , see fig .",
    "[ fig : fermi_selfenergy ] .",
    "the fermion propagator with the insertion of @xmath44 is nothing else than the first - order perturbative correction by the contact four - fermion interaction .",

    "constitutes our final result regarding relativistic superconductors , written in the most general form : the coupling constant is completely eliminated in favor of the mf ratio @xmath126 .",
    "also , the specific form of the pairing channel only enters through the algebraic factor @xmath139 .",
    "two comments are in order here .",
    "first , eq . gives the correction to the critical temperature at fixed chemical potential ; we do not solve the number equation along with the thouless criterion to obtain a result at fixed density . in the context of color - superconducting quark matter ,",
    "the ( baryon number ) chemical potential is usually treated as a free parameter .",
    "in fact , it is a more suitable parameter than the density itself in the case that the phase diagram involves first - order phase transitions , where the density becomes discontinuous .",
    "second , the @xmath0 algorithm based on eq .",
    "( reduced to a one - variable problem by fixing the chemical potential ) would suggest to interpret the exponent in eq .",
    "as the relative change of the critical temperature , or minus the relative change of the inverse critical temperature , depending on the choice of variable . in this section",
    ", we used the @xmath0 expansion to derive eq .",
    "as the one - loop corrected thouless criterion , and to evaluate the loop correction at the mf value of the critical temperature .",
    "we now go slightly beyond the @xmath0 philosophy in the sense that our result , eq . , does not need any further expansion and defines the critical temperature @xmath28 in an unambiguous manner .",
    "the value of @xmath28 thus calculated is always positive , no matter how large the loop function @xmath138 is .",
    "( of course , we would still consider the used approximation unreliable once @xmath138 becomes of order one or larger . ) in addition , the temperature correction does not display a finite offset in the bcs limit , as found in sec .",
    "[ sec : nrgas ] and assigned to the @xmath0 expansion as an artifact . on the contrary",
    ", it drops rapidly with decreasing ratio @xmath126 , as one would naively expect .    to complete the discussion of the results , we show in figs .",
    "[ fig : hdet_nr ] and [ fig : hdet_r ] the numerically calculated values of the function @xmath138 in the nr and ur limits , respectively . for @xmath126",
    "smaller than about @xmath140 the functions may be very well approximated by a simple empirical power law , @xmath141 which can be used for a fast rough estimate of the size of fluctuation effects .",
    "2em     finally , we wish to illustrate a possible impact of fluctuations on the qcd phase diagram . in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] we display the phase diagrams from a simple njl - model calculation ; the model is the same one as adopted in ref .",
    "@xcite with the diquark coupling @xmath142 chosen such that the cfl gap is @xmath143 at @xmath144 in the chiral @xmath70 limit .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ( a ) shows the phase diagram at vanishing strange quark mass , i.e. , in the chiral @xmath70 limit .",
    "the dashed line is the critical temperature at the leading order in @xmath0 expansion , and the suppression of the critical temperature due to fluctuation effects at nlo is included by means of the analytic formula . interestingly , because @xmath145 in the cfl case while it is just @xmath146 in the 2sc phase , we expect a finite region with 2sc pairing below the normal phase even in the chiral @xmath70 limit .",
    "however , since the approximation which led to eq .",
    "is only valid in the high - density regime where @xmath147 is small , we have to keep in mind that the estimates are not quantitative at low density .",
    "it is also important to note that we derived the shift of critical temperature of the cfl phase , taking into account the fluctuations in the normal phase . now that we know that the 2sc phase interposes between the normal and cfl phases",
    ", it would be more appropriate to somehow take into account the fluctuations within the 2sc phase for a more realistic estimate of the temperature of the phase transition between the cfl and 2sc phases .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ( b ) shows the phase diagram at a finite strange quark mass , but without quantum fluctuation effects .",
    "the strange quark mass is set to @xmath148 , and is for simplicity treated as an external parameter rather than a dynamical one .",
    "also , the intricate charge neutrality effects are ignored here because they are not important for our purposes ; we just remark that the charge neutrality constraints bring fine splittings to the @xmath28 s resulting in the appearance of tiny regions with dsc or usc pairing @xcite . comparing the two plots",
    ", we can see that the quantum fluctuation effects may play a significant role at high density which may be similar to that of the strange quark mass .",
    "this can be understood in a model - independent way as follows . within a weak - coupling ginzburg ",
    "landau approach , it was shown that the strange quark mass and charge neutrality result in shifts in the melting temperatures @xmath149 of the order parameters @xmath150 of the cfl phase of the order @xcite @xmath151 these corrections die rapidly as @xmath152 at large @xmath18 , while the correction to @xmath117 from order parameter fluctuations prevails as it behaves asymptotically like @xmath126 .",
    "considering in addition the fact that @xmath153 is a decreasing function of @xmath18 whereas the superconducting gap turns out to increase as @xmath154 @xcite , we conclude that the quantum fluctuation is more important than the effect of a strange quark mass at high density .    in a more realistic situation , there would be another source of fluctuations from thermal configurations of gauge fields @xcite which makes the superconducting  normal transition first order .",
    "the shift of the critical temperature turns out to be positive and is estimated to be proportional to the qcd coupling @xmath8 in the weak - coupling regime @xcite .",
    "therefore , in realistic quark matter the order parameter and gauge field fluctuations will compete each other .",
    "this issue certainly deserves a further study in future .",
    "we have investigated the @xmath0 expansion for strongly interacting fermi systems , proposed recently @xcite .",
    "we first studied in detail the case of nonrelativistic fermi gas near unitarity , extending the previous results by the calculation of the critical temperature off the unitarity .",
    "even though the @xmath0 expansion can give a result for the critical temperature at unitarity which is very close to the prediction from monte carlo simulations @xcite , there is an inherent ambiguity due to the choice of observable to generate ( and truncate ) the @xmath0 series .",
    "this ambiguity makes the @xmath0 expansion in the current setting useless when the corrections to the mf theory are large , in particular on the bec side of the crossover .",
    "we paid particular attention to the evolution of the fluctuation corrections in the bcs regime , where they are expected to be small , and the @xmath0 series thus to converge fast .",
    "we showed that the next - to - leading order in the @xmath0 expansion reproduces the well - known perturbative correction to the chemical potential up to second order .",
    "as far as the critical temperature is concerned , the fluctuation correction indeed decreases at weak coupling , but leaves a finite offset in the @xmath49 limit .",
    "we argued that this is likely to be an artifact of the @xmath0 expansion .    in sec .",
    "[ sec : rel_matter ] we applied the idea to strongly coupled relativistic superconductors , having in mind in particular color - superconducting dense quark matter .",
    "we used a simple class of njl - type models and resorted to a high - density approximation in order to avoid conceptual difficulties associated with renormalization and entanglement of several energy scales .",
    "our results are summarized in eqs . and and figures [ fig : hdet_nr ] and [ fig : hdet_r ] .",
    "they are physically intuitive in the sense that the fluctuation corrections are small in the bcs limit , decreasing linearly with the ratio @xmath126 , i.e. , exponentially with the inverse coupling , and become large as @xmath126 approaches the order of @xmath140 and further grows .",
    "in particular for typical color superconductors , the corrections to critical temperature are expected to be as large as tens percent .",
    "another important conclusion is that , within the simple setting used here , the fluctuation corrections are expressed as a universal function of the dimensionless ratio @xmath126 .",
    "the whole dependence on the symmetry structure of the pairing is encoded in an algebraic prefactor , which counts the number of bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom .",
    "this makes it straightforward to compare the effects for different competing superconducting phases , and thus estimate the impact of the order parameter fluctuations on the phase diagram such as in fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] . upon this investigation of the fluctuation corrections within a simple model , we plan , in our future work , to include the effects of chemical potential mismatch and color neutrality in order to obtain a more realistic description of quark matter .",
    "finally , we would like to stress the conceptual simplicity of this approach to order parameter fluctuations .",
    "we do not need to solve a complicated set of self - consistent integral equations like in other techniques going beyond the mf approximation , such as the cornwall  jackiw  tomboulis one . instead , one just has to evaluate a single multidimensional sum - integral .",
    "we therefore believe that the @xmath0 expansion may provide an efficient tool to determine the fluctuation effects in such strongly - coupled systems as , for instance , the color superconductors .",
