    "@xcite found that if the outer planet is significantly less massive than the inner one , and if the two planets open overlapping gaps , then the migration of the pair can proceed outwards . in this situation , the inner planet lies close to the inner edge of the common gap , and far from its outer edge ; therefore , it feels a positive torque from the inner disk , and no torque from the outer disk .",
    "symmetrically , the outer planet mostly feels a negative torque from the outer disk .",
    "if the inner planet is more massive , it feels a larger torque , in absolute value , than the outer planet , and the total torque applied to the pair of planets is positive .",
    "the pair of planet therefore moves outwards .    in order for this process to last on the long term",
    ", the material lying outside of the common gap must be funneled towards the inner disk . otherwise , it piles up at the outer edge of the gap , which eventually reverses the torque balance .",
    "in addition , the inner disk must be refilled .",
    "in fact , assuming a local damping of the outer planet s wake , one finds in the simulations an outwards drift rate of the disk material significantly smaller than that of the planets . thus , the gas just outside the gap is necessarily caught up with the outer separatrix of the outer planet , and thrown inwards .",
    "the whole process may be enhanced by the horseshoe drag due to gas of the outer disk passing through the common gap like in type  iii migration @xcite .",
    "however , the outwards migration of the pair is observed at all disk mass in numerical simulations .",
    "since the corotational effects like in type  iii migration become virtually negligible at small disk mass , it is primarily the wake torque imbalance that drives the outward migration .",
    "another clue of the importance of the lindblad torque imbalance on the process is the sensitivity of the drift rate on the disk s aspect ratio @xmath7 ( @xmath8 being the scale height of the disk , and @xmath9 the distance to the star ) , as the one - sided lindblad torque is proportional to @xmath10 .",
    "@xcite and @xcite find that the migration rate is a decreasing function of the aspect ratio of the disk .",
    "this effect is further enhanced by the fact that the tidal truncation of the outer edge of the common gap by the outer planet is less pronounced in thicker disks .",
    "accurate numerical simulation of the evolution of giant planets requires simultaneous computation of planets - disk interactions and global evolution of the disk .",
    "therefore , we use the 2d1d version of fargo @xcite , in which the standard 2d polar grid is surrounded by a 1d grid to compute the disk evolution on all its physical extension @xcite .",
    "the 2d grid extends from @xmath11 to @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the length unit ( taken as @xmath14  au ) .",
    "the 1d grid that is , the disk extends from @xmath15 to @xmath16 .",
    "the resolution is @xmath17 , constant in the two grids . in the 2d grid , @xmath18 .",
    "the inner regions of protoplanetary disks are poorly constrained , and disk profiles must be assumed for typical inner disk migration studies .",
    "in contrast , millimeter interferometry ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) places strong constraints on disk structures between @xmath19 and @xmath20  au .    of particular relevance to scenarios of migration is the temperature profile , which can be recast as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the sound speed and @xmath23 the angular velocity .",
    "the aspect ratio follows @xmath24 . the flaring index @xmath25 is typically @xmath26 and ranges from @xmath27 to @xmath28 @xcite .",
    "the @xcite results are compatible with @xmath29 , for @xmath30 ( mean molecular weight ) and @xmath31 at @xmath32  au . because we use a locally isothermal equation of state in our simulations , the temperature and aspect ratio are a function of radius only , independent of time .    for the surface density profile , we assume @xmath33 .",
    "detection of dust in the continuum constrains the profile of the dust column density multiplied by its emissivity ( hence its temperature ) . assuming a uniform dust to gas ratio , this yields @xmath34 , thus @xmath35 , value adopted in this work ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "@xmath36 is much less constrained . however ,",
    "unless the disk mass is large enough for type  iii migration to affect the dynamics , our results should be essentially independent of @xmath36 .",
    "more precisely the drift rate should scale with @xmath37 ; this is approximately what is seen in our numerical simulations with @xmath36 varying by one order of magnitude .",
    "we therefore adopt values of the surface density that offer a good trade off between speed and the onset of type  iii migration of the outer planet that would take it away from the resonance with the inner one .",

    "a disk that is 10 times lighter than considered above represents the minimum mass required to migrate the outer planet beyond 100 au .",
    "such a disk would be light for a @xmath58 star , so we conclude that there is sufficient time for the resonance mechanism to transport a massive planet to more than @xmath32  au .",
    "to understand this process in general , we have performed additional short - term simulations , using a smaller 2d grid ( extending from @xmath59 to @xmath60 ) , with @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 ( @xmath64  kg.m@xmath65 in the case @xmath44 , @xmath53  au ) , and with varying @xmath66 and @xmath38 . in each case , the migration speed of the pair of planets is measured after the resonance capture . the result is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : h ] .",
    "the figure is almost filled with symbols , which means that outward migration is possible for a wide range of parameters .",
    "more precisely , the starred symbols ( connected with the vertical solid line ) display the migration rates obtained with aspect ratio @xmath67 , for various values of @xmath38 between @xmath68 ( bottom ) and @xmath69 ( top ) ; @xmath70 is a decreasing function of @xmath38 , and there exists a critical @xmath71 such that the migration is directed outward for @xmath72 and inward for @xmath73 .",
    "reciprocally , for a fixed @xmath38 , @xmath74 is a decreasing function of @xmath7 ( see the short - dashed ( @xmath75 ) and long - dashed ( @xmath76 ) curves ) . in both cases",
    ", there exists a critical aspect ratio @xmath77 such that the migration is directed outwards for @xmath78 and inwards for @xmath79 .",
    "this explains partly the slowing down of the migration as the semi major axes increase in fig .",
    "[ fig:100 ] , and suggests that in a flared disk with uniform @xmath38 , the pair of planets should reach the location where @xmath80 .",
    "this is a stable equilibrium point as far as migration is concerned : in the inside , @xmath81 , and migration is directed outwards ; further from the star , @xmath82 and migration is directed inwards . if @xmath7 increases with @xmath9 , there should be convergence toward the place where @xmath80 .",
    "the evolution of the density profile also plays a role , but the study of this parameter is beyond the scope of this letter .    one can expect that the efficiency of the @xcite mechanism is directly related to the size of the gap opened by the outer planet . to demonstrate this , we plot in fig .",
    "[ fig : p ] the same points and curves as in fig .",
    "[ fig : h ] , but the migration speed is expressed in viscous time @xmath83 , and the @xmath84-axis reports the parameter @xmath85 , defined as : @xmath86 this parameter is precisely related to the width and depth of the gap of the outer planet @xcite .",
    "the strong correlation is obvious . for a broad range of @xmath7 and @xmath38 ,",
    "the dependence of the migration speed on these two parameters can be approximated by a dependence on the sole parameter @xmath85 .",
    "the migration rate is close to stationary for @xmath87 , whatever the values of @xmath38 and @xmath7 that combine into this value of @xmath85 .",
    "then , using eq .",

    "[ fig : h_c ] shows the value of the aspect ratio that makes @xmath88 for the outer planet , as a function of @xmath38 , for @xmath89 .",

    "the equilibrium radius @xmath93 depends on @xmath38 , @xmath25 , and @xmath94 .",
    "since @xmath25 is generally small , @xmath93 can be very large with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "note that for a given value of @xmath85 , the migration speed may depend on other parameters .",
    "therefore , the critical value for stationary migration @xmath95 holds only in the case considered here , that is with @xmath96 , @xmath61 , @xmath63 and @xmath62 .",
    "a full analysis of all the parameter space is beyond the scope of this letter .",
    "a shortcoming of the mechanism presented here is that it disregards the accretion of gas onto the planets . as the pair of planets proceeds outwards , the gas proceeds inwards through the common gap .",
    "the outer planet should presumably accrete most of the incoming material , narrowing the mass difference with the inner planet , so that the torque balance could cancel or reverse at some point .",
    "accretion of the nebular gas onto a giant planet is a complex process .",
    "it is dependent on the global structure of the flow , on the local properties of the circum - planetary disk or envelope ( poorly described in numerical simulations ) , and on the micro - physics of the nebula , such as the opacity of the grains .",
    "most detailed studies of gas accretion onto giant planets ca nt be applied to the present case , because the conditions are different from the conditions that prevail at @xmath14  au , where these studies apply .",
    "this appeals for a thorough investigation of gas accretion in the conditions of outward migration in the outskirts of the disk , which is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "the gas self - gravity may yield , depending on the equation of state of the fluid and the mass of the disk , to a vertical compression of the fluid in the vicinity of the shock ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "this would increase the lindblad torque , more efficiently on the side of the most massive planet , thus it would actually enhance the mechanism of outward migration .",
    "but 3d effects apply mostly at high order resonances , close to the planet , which are depleted in our case .",
    "in addition , three dimensional semi - analytic calculations performed by @xcite show that the angular momentum is essentially exchanged with waves that have no vertical structure .",
    "therefore , owing to the size of the gap that our pair of planets carves in the disk , and owing to the relatively large value of the toomre parameter ( see table  [ table ] ) , we feel confident that non - self - gravitating , two dimensional isothermal simulations capture the main features of our mechanism and provide an acceptable order of magnitude of the outward drift rate .      in the above simulations , the equation of state was locally isothermal .",
    "this is realistic at large distances from the star , where the opacity is low and the cooling time is short with respect to the dynamical time .",
    "however , at @xmath97  au from the star , the cooling time can be larger than the orbital period .",
    "this can affect the aspect ratio , because of the heating of the disk by the wakes launched by the planets .",
    "additional simulations have been run , with the settings of sect .",
    "[ sec : result ] , and computing the full energy equation , with viscous heating @xmath98 , and no heat diffusion in the disk plane , but vertical radiative cooling @xmath99 ( where @xmath100 is the stefan - boltzmann constant ) .",
    "the opacity @xmath101 is constant and tuned for the unperturbed disk to be in thermal equilibrium ( see eq .",
    "( 6 ) of * ? ? ?",
    "this gives a cooling time of @xmath102 initially .",
    "the aspect ratio increases to about @xmath103 in the planets region after 100 orbits of the inner planet .",
    "this makes the migration rate after the resonance capture to decrease to @xmath104  au / year instead of @xmath105  au / year .    with a realistic opacity , given by ( *",
    "* appendix ) , @xmath106 and @xmath7 are increased for @xmath107  au , and shrink for @xmath108  au because we do nt take heating from the star into account . at @xmath14  au , the cooling time is then @xmath109 .",
    "migration proceeds outwards at a speed initially similar to the locally isothermal case ( which was expected as @xmath7 is not much changed around @xmath110  au ) , slightly accelerating while reaching the outer regions where @xmath7 is smaller .",
    "so , it seems that migration can proceed outwards on the long range also in non locally isothermal disks , even if a self - consistent radiative disk model still has to be tested .",
    "we find that a pair of planets formed in the @xmath4  au region can reach large semi major axes , if the outer planet is lighter than the inner one and they orbit in resonance in a common gap in the protoplanetary disk .",
    "the pair of planets tends to reach regions in the disk where @xmath7 has a critical value ( of the order of @xmath111 , depending on the other parameters ) ; this can be ten times further from the star than where they formed .",
    "after the disk has dissipated , the evolution of the planets may lead to the disruption of their original resonant configuration , due to various processes : ( i ) the eccentricities can rise too much if the planets are too massive ; ( ii ) a third planet could destabilize the system at some point ; ( iii ) the outer planet may enter a debris disk , in which it migrates independently of the inner planet by planetesimals scattering . such a phenomenon may account for the hr8799 system , where the outermost planet is the lightest one , but no resonance has been identified so far @xcite .    otherwise , the planets should remain on orbits in resonance far from the star .",
    "their eccentricities should therefore be non zero but moderate : during the outward migration , @xmath112 is excited by the resonance and simultaneously damped by the disk ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the simulation presented in fig .",
    "[ fig:100 ] , the eccentricities are about @xmath1 and @xmath113 for the inner and outer planet respectively . in contrast , the scattering of giant planets leads to very eccentric orbits ( up to @xmath114 ) .",
    "the typical final eccentricity of planets formed by gravitational instability is not known .",
    "the mechanism presented here could account for the case of fomalhaut  b. indeed , this planet has a mass smaller than @xmath115 ( @xmath116 ) @xcite , while @xcite predicted a planet smaller than saturn .",
    "thus , a more massive , inner planet could exist .",
    "in addition , @xcite notice that fomalhaut  b is not apsidally aligned with the dust belt , which suggests the presence of additional perturbers in the system .",
    "observations in the @xmath117-band by @xcite rule out the presence of a planet more massive than @xmath118 in the range @xmath119  au from fomalhaut .",
    "however , if our mechanism occurred in the fomalhaut system , then the second planet should be orbiting at about 75 au from the star , with a mass of the order of @xmath120 to @xmath14 jupiter masses .",
