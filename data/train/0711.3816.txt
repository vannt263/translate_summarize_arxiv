    "in refs . 2 and 3 , the action for a fundamental bosonic field was found to have the form    @xmath0    at energies that are far below the planck energy @xmath1 ( with @xmath2 and in a locally inertial coordinate system .",
    "this is the conventional form of the action for fermions , described by 2-component weyl spinors , but it is highly unconventional for bosons , because a boson described by @xmath3 would have spin 1/2 .",
    "we can , however , transform from the original 2-component field @xmath3 to two 1-component complex fields @xmath4 and @xmath5 by writing @xmath6 with @xmath7 @xmath8 substitution then gives @xmath9   \\\\ & = & \\int d^{4}x\\ , \\left [ - \\partial ^{\\mu } \\phi ^{\\ast } \\left ( x\\right ) \\partial _ { \\mu } \\phi \\left ( x\\right ) + f^{\\ast } \\left ( x\\right ) f\\left ( x\\right )   \\right ] \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is a 4-dimensional normalization volume .",
    "this is , of course , precisely the action for a massless scalar boson field @xmath4 and its auxiliary field @xmath5 .    with the fermionic action left in its original form",
    ", we now have the standard supersymmetric action for each pair of susy partners : @xmath13 \\,.\\ ] ]    there is a major point that will be discussed at length elsewhere , in a more complete treatment of the present theory : the above transformation works only for @xmath14 , since otherwise the sign of the integrand would be reversed .",
    "however , a stable vacuum already requires @xmath15 , so we must define time for would - be negative - frequency fields in such a way that this condition is satisfied .",
    "in our earlier work , the time coordinate @xmath17 was initially defined in exactly the same way as each spatial coordinate @xmath18 , so @xmath17 was initially a euclidean variable . for reasons given in the following section , however",
    ", this does not seem to be as physically reasonable as a picture in which time is lorentzian when it is first defined . in this section , therefore , we move to a new picture in which the initial `` path integral '' @xmath19 still has the euclidean form @xmath20 but there is _ initially no time_. we are then confronted with the well - known situation in canonical quantum gravity@xcite , where the `` wavefunction of the universe '' is a functional of only 3-geometries , with no time dependence . roughly speaking , cosmological time",
    "is then defined by the cosmic scale factor @xmath21 ( except that there can be different branches for the state of the universe , corresponding to , e.g. , expansion and contraction , as well as different initial conditions ) .",
    "more precisely , the progression of time is locally defined by the progression of local @xmath16-geometries .",
    "an analogy is a stationary state for a proton with coordinates @xmath22 passing a hydrogen atom with coordinates @xmath23 .",
    "the time - independent schrdinger equation can be written @xmath24 with @xmath25 required to satisfy @xmath26 then the equation for @xmath27 is @xmath28 the first term involves a local proton velocity @xmath29 for a state in which the proton is moving rapidly , with @xmath30 and in which @xmath31 is relatively small , we obtain @xmath32 one then has an `` internal time '' defined within a stationary state@xcite .",
    "similarly , one can define time as a progression of @xmath16-geometries , just as proposed 40 years ago by dewitt , whose formulation of canonical quantum gravity ( following the classical canonical decomposition of arnowitt , deser , and misner , and the work of dirac , wheeler , and others ) involves the local canonical momentum operator @xmath33 which corresponds to the proton momentum operator @xmath34 in the analogy above .",
    "after introducing the @xmath16-dimensional metric tensor in the way described in refs . 1 - 3 , and the gravitational action in a way that will be described in a more complete treatment",
    ", we move from the original path - integral quantization to canonical quantization , with a state @xmath35 \\;\\psi _ { \\mathrm{otherfields}}\\left [ \\phi _ { \\mathrm { otherfields}}\\left ( \\vec{x}\\right),g_{kl}\\left ( \\vec{x}\\right ) \\right]\\ ] ] and time is defined essentially in the same way as in the analogy .",
    "a euclidean path integral with the form of ( 9 ) , but with time included , is formally transformed into a lorentzian path integral @xmath38 through an inverse wick rotation @xmath39 .",
    "@xmath40 has the usual form of a classical action , and it leads to the usual description of quantized fields via path - integral quantization . in other words , the standard equations of physics follow from @xmath40 , and are therefore formulated in lorentzian time . the euclidean formulation , in either coordinate or momentum space , is ordinarily regarded as a mere mathematical tool which can simplify calculations and make them better defined .    hawking ,",
    "on the other hand , has suggested that euclidean spacetime may actually be more fundamental than lorentzian spacetime . in his well - known popular book ,",
    "he says@xcite `` so maybe what we call imaginary time is really more basic , and what we call real is just an idea that we invent to help us describe what we think the universe is like . '' and in a more technical paper he states@xcite `` in fact one could take the attitude that quantum theory and indeed the whole of physics is really defined in the euclidean region and that it is simply a consequence of our perception that we interpret it in the lorentzian regime . ''",
    "however , there is a fundamental problem with this point of view , because the factor @xmath41 in the lorentzian formulation results in interference effects , whereas the factor @xmath42 in the euclidean formulation does not . also , a formal transformation from @xmath43 to @xmath44 mixes all of the supposedly more fundamental euclidean times in the single lorentzian time that we actually experience .",
    "finally , it appears difficult to formulate a mathematically well - founded and physically well - motivated transformation of a general path integral from euclidean to lorentzian spacetime .",
    "here we adopt a very different point of view : ( 1 ) nature is fundamentally statistical , essentially as proposed in refs . 1 - 3 ,",
    "but the initial path integral ( or partition function ) does not contain the time as a fundamental coordinate .",
    "instead time is defined by the local 3-space geometry ( or more generally , ( d-1)-space geometry ) .",
    "( 2 ) it is , however , still necessary to transform from the euclidean form ( 9 ) , with @xmath45 , to the lorentzian form ( 18 ) , with @xmath46 ( but also with no time coordinate , so that @xmath47 in ( 18 ) ) , and this is our goal in the present section .    consider a single complex scalar field @xmath48 with a @xmath49-dimensional `` euclidean path integral '' @xmath50 in a discrete picture , the operator @xmath51 is replaced by a matrix with elements @xmath52 : @xmath53 @xmath51 can be diagonalized to @xmath54 .",
    "then @xmath55 \\exp \\left ( -\\sum_{\\vec{x},\\vec{x}^{\\prime } } \\phi^{\\ast } \\left ( \\vec{x}\\right ) \\,a\\left ( \\vec{x},\\vec{x}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\,\\phi\\left ( \\vec{x}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\right ) \\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] becomes@xcite @xmath56 \\exp \\left ( -\\sum _ { \\vec{k}}\\phi^{\\ast } \\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) \\,a\\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) \\phi \\,\\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) \\right ) .\\ ] ] the gaussian integrals over @xmath57 and @xmath58 may be evaluated as usual at each @xmath59 to give @xmath60    here , and in the earlier papers , two representations of the path integral are taken to be physically equivalent if they give the same result for all operators @xmath51 ( including those which produce zero except for arbitrarily restricted regions of space and sets of fields ) .",
    "for example , we might define a path integral @xmath61 with fields @xmath62 and @xmath63 which are treated as independent and which each vary along the real axis .",
    "it is then appropriate to include the formal jabobian , with a value of @xmath64 , which would correspond to a transformation from @xmath65 and @xmath66 to @xmath67 and @xmath68 .",
    "since @xmath69 \\exp \\left ( \\sum_{\\vec{k}}i\\,\\bar{\\phi } ^{\\prime } \\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) \\,a\\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) \\phi ^{\\prime } \\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) \\right ) \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\prod_{\\vec{k}}\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{-\\infty } ^{\\,\\infty } d\\left ( \\phi ^{\\prime } \\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) \\right ) \\int_{-\\infty } ^{\\,\\infty } \\,d\\left ( \\bar{\\phi}^{\\prime } \\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) \\right ) \\exp \\left ( i\\,\\bar{\\phi}^{\\prime } \\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) \\,a\\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) \\;\\phi^{\\prime } \\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) \\right )   \\nonumber \\\\ & = & \\prod_{\\vec{k}}\\frac{1}{2a\\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) } \\int_{-\\infty } ^{\\,\\infty } d\\left ( a\\left ( \\vec{k}\\right ) \\;\\phi^{\\prime } \\left ( \\vec { k}\\right ) \\right )",

    "now let us define a `` lorentzian path integral '' @xmath71 by @xmath72 \\exp \\left ( i\\sum_{\\vec{x},\\vec{x}^{\\prime } } \\phi^{\\ast } \\left ( \\vec{x}\\right ) \\,a\\left ( \\vec{x},\\vec{x}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\,\\phi\\left ( \\vec{x}^{\\prime } \\right ) \\right ) .",

    "this replacement is possible because time is introduced only after @xmath74 is in lorentzian form .",
    "the transformation from @xmath19 to @xmath71 can be regarded as a transformation of the fields in the integrand , with the lines along which @xmath75 and @xmath76 are integrated each being rotated by @xmath77 in the complex plane@xcite .",
    "the ideas above are part of a broad program to obtain standard physics , including supersymmetry , from a description at the planck scale which is purely statistical .",
    "the major steps in the complete program are as follows :          \\(4 ) the 3-dimensional gravitational metric tensor @xmath82 and @xmath83 gauge fields @xmath84 ( and their initial , primitive supersymmetric partners ) result from rotations of the vacuum state vector , in both @xmath85-dimensional external space and @xmath86 dimensional internal space .",
    "\\(6 ) the einstein - hilbert action for the gravitational field ( as well as the cosmological constant ) , the maxwell - yang - mills action for the gauge fields , and the analogous terms for the gaugino and gravitino fields are assumed to arise from a response of the vacuum that is analogous to the diamagnetic response of electrons .",
    "\\(10 ) one finally obtains an effective action which is the same as that of standard physics with supersymmetry , except that particle masses , yukawa couplings , and self - interactions are assumed to arise from supersymmetry breaking and radiative corrections .",
