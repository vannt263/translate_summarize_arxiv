    "measurements of the integrated light from a galaxy at 2000  provides a fairly direct measure of the instantaneous rate of star formation , since the massive stars that provide most of this radiation are short - lived compared with the age of the galaxy .",
    "knowledge of the star formation rate also gives a measure of the rate of heavy element production in a galaxy , or in the universe when a large sample of galaxies are measured ( @xcite ) .",
    "the integrated light from these galaxies contributes to the extragalactic background light at ultraviolet wavelengths , whose main sources are hot stars and active galactic nuclei .",
    "measurements of galaxy number counts in the ultraviolet have been made by @xcite using the foca balloon - borne uv telescope , @xcite and @xcite using hst archival fields .",
    "these data have been interpreted with models that predict number counts based on galaxy spectral energy distributions ( sed s ) and luminosity functions , such as those of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the total far - ultraviolet extragalactic background has been measured to be as high as 500 ph @xmath2 s@xmath3 @xmath3 and as low as 30 ph @xmath2",
    "s@xmath3 @xmath3 ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "predictions for the number of galaxies that might be detected in deep ultraviolet optical monitor ( om ) images are given by @xcite .",
    "in this paper , we detect galaxies in a deep uv image taken with the optical monitor ( om ) and use these galaxy number counts to place constraints on galaxy luminosity evolution via a a galaxy evolution model similar to that of @xcite .",
    "we also find a lower limit to the galaxy contribution to the extragalactic uv background .",
    "the om 13 hr deep field ( at j2000.0 13 34 37.00 , + 37 54 44.0 ) was observed for approximately 200 ks with xmm - newton around june 22 , 2001 .",

    "we searched each image for sources using sextractor and made a catalog of the sources we found .",
    "we concentrate here on sources in the uvw2 image ( fig .",
    "[ tsasseen - f7_fig1 ] ) and use measurements in the other filters to differentiate between stars , galaxies and qso s .",
    "we also use a deep r band image ( to r@xmath427 ) of this field taken with the 8 m subaru telescope on mauna kea ( fig .",
    "[ tsasseen - f7_fig2 ] ) to check for source shape and possible confusion .",
    "we perform two checks to discriminate stars from galaxies . first , we compare the sed of each uvw2 source ( determined from om photometry ) against stellar templates .",
    "second , we compute an inferred distance , as if the source were a main sequence star , from u - b color and b magnitude , as shown in fig .",
    "[ tsasseen - f7_fig3 ] .",
    "we find these checks form reliable stellar discriminators for more than 90% of the sources",
    "brighter than ab=22 . where @xmath5 is given in ergs @xmath2 s@xmath3 hz@xmath3 ( @xcite ) .",
    "] we also find a number of qso s in the field that show uv excess and appear point - like in the om and subaru images .",
    "we categorize these separately in our galaxy number counts .",
    "further work remains to completely discriminate any remaining stellar content and the qso populations .",
    "we plot the detected galaxy counts as a function of magnitude in fig .",
    "[ tsasseen - f7_fig4 ] .",
    "our counts are in approximate agreement with that of @xcite ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ tsasseen - f7_fig4 ] ) in the range of overlap , and we extend these counts to ab=22 .",
    "we have constructed a model is similar to that of @xcite and use it to predict galaxy counts at 2000  as a function of apparent magnitude .",
    "the model uses a schechter absolute luminosity distribution function for 6 different galaxy types at redshifts between zero and 1.2 , along with k - corrections and a single parameter luminosity evolution factor for each galaxy type .",
    "we have normalized the schechter function using observed counts at bj=17 , and set our evolution parameters to agree with the modeled galactic evolution of @xcite , following @xcite .",
    "our model implicitly includes the effects of dust absorption and scattering because it is based on observed uv sed s . like armand & milliard ,",
    "our model predicts fewer galaxies in each magnitude band than our measured number counts , as shown in figure  [ tsasseen - f7_fig4 ] .",
    "we also compare the observed counts with the model of @xcite , whose model explicitly includes expected contributions to the observed galaxy counts from starburst galaxies and dust .",
    "our model agrees well with the granato et al .",
    "model that includes dust , but our observed counts are higher than both models that include dust .",
    "the summed the flux from non - stellar sources detected in the uvw2 image totals 3236 ph @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 @xmath3 , with the higher limit including the contribution from qso s and active galaxies .",
    "the integrated far - ultraviolet light from discrete galaxies has been measured recently by @xcite to be 144195 ph @xmath2 s@xmath3 sr@xmath3 @xmath3 , based on galaxies detected in the range ab = 24 to 29.5 and a model to infer the flux from brighter galaxies .",
    "these authors claim there appears to be a break in the slope of the galaxy number counts that occurs around ab = 24 , with substantial flattening of function at fainter magnitudes .",
    "our measurements show an intriguing downturn in galaxy counts at the faint end , which may indicate the start of the change in the slope of the number counts .",
    "there still remains some uncertainty in the number counts in the gap between our measurements and those of @xcite , which indicates the total integrated flux of galaxies is still uncertain .",
    "the discrepancy between the models shown in fig .",
    "[ tsasseen - f7_fig4 ] and both our data and that of @xcite may indicate that we are missing some components in our understanding of how galaxies evolve .",
    "some possible reasons for the descrepancy between their model and measurements are given by @xcite , including faster evolution of the star formation rate or the possiblity that there is a population of blue galaxies that is substantially more numerous at z = 0.7 than they are today .",
    "there are a number of effects we have not yet evaluated in detail that may affect our measurement and conclusions .",
    "these include the effects of galaxy inclination , morphology and apertures on our photometry , the effects of comparing measurements made in slightly different bandpasses , and the detailed effects of dust absorption and possible evolution in galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "our simple model assumes a smooth evolution in star formation , but there is evidence that star formation may be espisodic or occur in bursts , possibly because of merger activity , _",
    "e.g. _ @xcite .",
    "galaxies change over time in many ways and our model predicts only one facet of these changes , namely an evolving star formation rate . the full picture of galaxy evolution is certainly more complicated .",
    "it remains to explore further the connections between changes in the star formation rate and changes in galaxy appearance and morphology , metallicity , gas content , spectral energy output , and merger activity that have been discussed at length by other researchers .",
    "\\1 ) we have obtained galaxy counts at 2000  to a magnitude of ab = 22 in deep images from the optical monitor on xmm - newton .",
    "the long om exposure allows us to measure galaxy counts 1.5 magnitudes fainter than @xcite , and we find similar counts in range of overlap .",
    "2 ) two evolutionary models underpredict the observed galaxy counts , and may indicate that several process may be at work , including episodic star formation , changes in the optical depth within galaxies to 2000  radiation , or a new population of galaxies that is less visible in the present epoch .",
    "3 ) the total integrated flux from the galaxies we detect to ab=22 is 3236 ph @xmath2 s@xmath6 @xmath3 sr@xmath3 .",
    "this flux is a lower limit to the integrated extragalactic background light at 2000  , and represents about 2025% of the integrated , far - ultraviolet flux from galaxies inferred from the deep hst measurements of @xcite .",
