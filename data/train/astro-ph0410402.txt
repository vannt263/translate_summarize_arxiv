    "the hard x - ray and gamma - ray bands have long been recognized as important windows for exploring the energetic universe .",
    "it is in these energy bands that non - thermal emission , primalily due to accelerated high energy particles , becomes dominant .",
    "however , by comparison with the soft x - ray band , where the spectacular data from the xmm - newton and chandra satellites are revolutionizing our understanding of the high - energy universe , the sensitivities of hard x - ray missions flown so far , or currently under construction , have not dramatically improved over the last decade . in order to study the energy content of non - thermal emission and to draw a more complete picture of the non - thermal universe , observations by highly sensitive missions are important . the next ( non - thermal energy exploration telescope )",
    "mission proposed in japan is a successor to the astro - e2 mission , and is optimised to study the high - energy non - thermal universe ( fig.[fig : next ] ) @xcite .",
    "next will carry three hard x - ray telescopes ( hxts ) for the wide band x - ray imager ( wxi ) , one soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ) for the soft x - ray spectrometer ( sxs ) , and a soft @xmath5-ray detector ( sgd ) . with the first imaging observations up to 80kev ,",
    "next is expected to achieve two orders of magnitude improvement in the sensitivity in the hard x - ray region .",
    "the sgd utilizes a new concept of a narrow - fov compton telescope@xcite to improve the sensitivity in the soft @xmath5-ray region for matching with the sensitivity of the hxt / wxi combination .",
    "the extremely low background brought by the sgd will allow us to measure the precise @xmath5-ray spectrum upto 1 mev .",
    "furthermore , as described in the separate paper@xcite , the sgd will be sensitive to the polarization of the incident @xmath5-rays , and will potentially be the first hard x - ray polarimeter in orbit .",
    "in addition to these high energy instruments , the soft x - ray spectrometer ( sxs ) will map out the velocity field in objects by means of x - ray line profiles .",
    "the sxs is based on a transition edge sensor ( tes ) and has both spectral and spatial resolution much better than the x - ray calorimeter ( xrs ) onboard the astro - e2@xcite . in this paper",
    ", we describe the current ideas about the wxi and the sgd .",
    "the non - imaging instruments flown so far were essentially limited to studies of sources with 10 - 100 kev fluxes of at best @xmath610@xmath7 @xmath8 10@xmath9 erg @xmath10s@xmath11 .",
    "this limitation is due to the presence of high un - rejected backgrounds from particle events and cosmic x - ray radiation , which increasingly dominate above 10 kev .",
    "imaging , and especially focusing instruments have two tremendous advantages : first , the volume of the focal plane detector can be made much smaller than for non - focusing instruments , and second , the residual background , often time - variable , can be measured simultaneously with the source , and can be reliably subtracted .    a depth - graded multi - layer mirror , referred to as a _ super mirror _ , reflects x - rays not only by total external reflection but also by bragg reflection .",
    "a super mirror consists of a stack of multi - layers with different sets of periodic length and number of layer pairs .",
    "the current mirror design of the hxt for next@xcite is based on a carbon / platinum coating , which is adopted in the infoc@xmath12s project by nagoya university and nasa s gsfc@xcite . with three hxt units ,",
    "effective areas of 1100 @xmath3 at 20 kev and 230 @xmath3 at 60 kev can be achieved with a focal length of 12m@xcite .",
    "[ fig : next - area ] compare the effective area of the three hxts with xmm - newton and astro - e2 .",
    "the effective area of the soft x - ray telescope ( sxt ) and the sgd are also shown in the figure .        in order to match the energy range covered by the super mirror ( 0.5 @xmath8 80kev ) ,",
    "the focal plane detector is required to cover a very wide energy band . to this end , we have proposed a new focal plane detector based on an idea of combining a fully depleted ccd and a cdte ( cadmium telluride ) pixel detector@xcite as the wxi @xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : wxi_concept ] is a schematic design of the wxi showing the concept .",
    "the wxi is composed of two sub - instruments ; the soft x - ray imager ( sxi ) and the hard x - ray imager ( hxi ) .",
    "specifications of the sxi and the hxi are listed in table  [ table : wxi ] .",
    "the sxi is based on an x - ray ccd with very thin dead layer in the device and the hxi is based on a fine - pitch cdte pixel detector . in the wxi ,",
    "soft x - rays will be absorbed in the ccd , while hard x - rays will penetrate through the ccd and be absorbed in the cdte pixel detector .",
    "semiconductor detectors with high mass absorption coefficient , such as cdte , are crucial for the detection of hard x - ray photons . for cdte , even a detector with a thickness of 0.5",
    "mm provides a good detection efficiency for the hard x - ray region covered by the hxt . as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wxi_concept ] , the cdte detector mounted in the hxi is shielded by a bgo ( bi@xmath13ge@xmath14o@xmath15 ) scintillator .",
    "this shield is indispensable , as the non x - ray background is the dominant source of the background in the energy range of the hxi .",
    "a thickness of @xmath02 cm for bgo will be required , not only for shielding against background photons but also for reducing the number of particles that reach the cdte detector and give rise to activation .     &",

    "it will be based on the technology which has been accumulated for the japanese maxi mission@xcite .",
    "the sxi utilizes a single , large - format ccd which covers 12@xmath112 arcmin@xmath18 at the focal plane .",
    "an energy resolution of 130 ev ( fwhm ) at 6 kev is expected at the operating temperature of @xmath890 deg .",
    "sxi utilizes a thinned ccd , whose undepleted layer is largely removed .",
    "this is necessary to make it transparent to hard x - rays .",
    "if we adopt a backside - illuminated ccd , no extra process is necessary as the undepleted layer is already removed .",
    "the ccd support and cooling structures are configured near the rim of the ccd so as not to interfere with the transmission of hard x - rays .",
    "thus the transparent portion to hard x - rays is smaller than the size of the ccd itself . in order further to reduce the undepleted layer and to improve the high energy response ,",
    "the development of fully depleted p - channel ccd fabricated on n - type high - resistivity silicon is now under way@xcite .",
    "the current goal for the cdte detector in the hxi is a pixel detector with both a fine position resolution of 200@xmath8250 @xmath12 m and a high energy resolution better than 1 kev ( fwhm ) , in the energy range from 5 kev to 80 kev . since",
    "significant progress has been made recently on the development of cdte technologies@xcite , it is now possible to fabricate a single crystal cdte device with the size of 2@xmath12 @xmath3 .",
    "signals from the individual pixel electrodes formed on the surface of the cdte wafer are fed into the readout circuit built in the asic . to realize the fine pitch cdte pixel detector for the hxi ,",
    "a low noise front - end asic with more than several thousand independent channels will be the key technology .",
    "development of a simple and robust connection technology is also necessary , because high compression and/or high ambient temperature would damage the cdte . in order to cooperate with the bgo shield",
    ", the detector should have fast timing resolution of 10 to 100 @xmath12s , such that we can veto the events when there is a hit in the shield .",
    "taking these requirements into consideration , we have been working on high performance cdte detectors for both planar and pixel configuration@xcite .",
    "based on the cdte wafers manufactured from the single crystal grown by the traveling heater method ( thm - cdte ) and with the technology for gold - stud bump bonding , we have developed cdte detectors with high energy resolution@xcite .    with next ,",
    "we expect to achieve an area of about 750@xmath3 at 30kev with a typical angular resolution of 30@xmath19 .",
    "[ fig : wxi_area ] shows the efficiency of the wxi with a 300 @xmath12 m thick x - ray ccd and a 0.5 or 1.0 mm cdte pixel detector . in the calculation ,",

    "would be roughly 10@xmath21erg@xmath3s@xmath11 in terms of the 1080kev flux for a power - law spectrum with a photon index of 2 .",

    "highly sensitive observations in the energy range above the hxt / wxi bandpass is crucial to study the spectrum of accelerated particles .",
    "the sgd outperforms previous soft-@xmath5-ray instruments in background rejection capability by adopting a new concept of narrow - fov compton telescope@xcite . in the energy range above one hundred kev ( sub - mev region ) ,",
    "shielding against background photons becomes important yet difficult .",
