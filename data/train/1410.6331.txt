    "systems in nature are almost always subject to noise . even though these random perturbations often are small in amplitude , they nevertheless have drastic consequences on the behavior of the system as a whole by facilitating rare but extreme excursions of the dynamics .",
    "many processes in biology , chemistry , physics and economics , including phase transitions @xcite , ocean dynamics @xcite , rates of chemical reactions @xcite , genetic switches @xcite and option pricing in finance @xcite are caused by rare extreme events .    in the small noise limit , these extreme events are in fact very predictable .",
    "the arising most probable transition trajectory of the rare event in turn allows for predictions regarding both the evolution of the rare event and its probability . in the context of the martin - siggia - rose / jansen / de dominicis formalism @xcite",
    "these field configurations are termed _",
    "instantons_. they correspond to the minimizers of the rate function in the freidlin - wentzell theory of large deviations @xcite .",
    "a number of numerical algorithms have been devised to compute these field configurations .",
    "some of them , like the nudged elastic band method @xcite or the string method @xcite , are only applicable to the important sub - class of gradient systems , while others , most notably the minimum action method @xcite and variants thereof @xcite , are able to find the instanton configuration for more general cases .",
    "all have in common that they solve the problem _ globally _ , by discretizing the trajectory along the physical time and applying global operations on its entirety . for pde systems with an infinite number of degrees of freedom , in particular in higher dimensions , such as arising in turbulent fluids , the memory requirements of these algorithms quickly become prohibitive .",
    "many questions in fluid dynamics , such as shock formation in compressible flows @xcite or the generation of rogue waves @xcite , allow an alternative to the global formulation due to the nature of their mixed initial / final boundary conditions . here , it is feasible to iteratively solve the equations of motion ( the _ instanton equations _ ) of the underlying hamiltonian system instead @xcite .",
    "the boundary conditions are propagated throughout the domain , which opens up possibilities to avoid saving the field configuration at every instance in time . in particular , a drastic reduction in memory is possible by combining a number of techniques : ( a ) considering the `` geometric '' reparametrization of the trajectory instead of parametrization by physical time , ( b ) recursive storage of transition states , inspired by multigrid techniques , ( c ) exploiting the compactness of the support of the force correlation in turbulence setups , and ( d ) further memory reductions through wavelet compression .",
    "the detailed presentation of the resulting algorithm constitutes the core of this work .",
    "we illustrate its effectiveness by applying it to 1d and 2d compressible turbulence .",
    "in fact we demonstrate that the combined optimizations reduce the memory footprint enough to fit optimization problems with @xmath0 degrees of freedom on a single graphics card .",
    "it therefore becomes feasible to solve the numerical problem on graphics processing units ( gpus ) instead of their host machines at a considerable gain in runtime performance . in consequence ,",
    "all algorithms presented in this paper are implemented on gpus using the cuda framework @xcite .",
    "furthermore , due to its memory efficiency , the scheme in principle allows attacking the important problem of the computation of instanton configurations for the 3d incompressible navier - stokes equation , which would yield scaling predictions for turbulent statistics .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : we first establish the instanton formalism and the associated minimization problem in section  [ sec:2 ] .",
    "we introduce the martin - siggia - rose / janssen / de dominicis formalism and present a beneficial modification of the action functional in terms of a geometric reparametrization . in section  [ sec:3 ] , we outline the composition of our proposed algorithm .",
    "this includes a discussion of the recursive integration of the mixed initial / final value problem posed by the instanton equations and its combination with the projection of the auxiliary field variable .",
    "section  [ sec:4 ] presents applications of the proposed algorithm to the problem of prototypical shock configurations of one- and two - dimensional compressible fluids .",
    "we demonstrate the efficiency in memory of the algorithm by computing the minimizer in a high degrees of freedom setup and discuss the computational overhead of the optimizations in terms of performance .",
    "we conclude in section  [ sec:5 ] with a discussion of the results , present possible future applications as well as comment on their potential impact on the understanding of turbulent fluids .",
    "consider a system of @xmath1 partial differential equations driven by a gaussian noise , @xmath2 + \\eta(x , t)\\ ] ] in @xmath3-dimensional domain , i.e. the field @xmath4 is a function @xmath5 \\rightarrow \\mathbb{r}^n$ ] .",

    "thus , the driving occurs only at scales larger than a cut - off scale @xmath14 .",
    "this setup appears naturally in turbulent fluid systems with a direct cascade , such as 3d incompressible navier - stokes turbulence , mhd turbulence or burgers turbulence : energy is inserted at large scales and transported to small scales by the non - linear term , where it is dissipated by viscosity .",
    "note that the opposite choice of small scale forcing , which is necessary for configurations with an inverse cascade , is equally viable despite being not of the form  , as the only necessary condition is a compact support of the forcing correlation .",
    "the martin - siggia - rose / janssen / de dominicis path integral formalism allows us to formally write down the expectation of any observable of the field variables , @xmath15 $ ] , under the noise @xmath7 as @xmath16 \\rangle_\\eta \\propto \\int du\\ , \\int d(ip )    \\mathcal{o}[u ] \\exp ( -i_t[u , p])\\ ] ] with the _ action functional _ or _ response functional _",

    "this approach is commonly taken in practice , most notably by the string method @xcite for gradient systems , and by the minimum action method @xcite and variants thereof @xcite in more general setups .    for a wide class of questions the form of the observable @xmath15",
    "$ ] allows for an efficient alternative approach : suppose we only want to measure the observable at the final time @xmath28 ( or any other distinct point in time ) , and furthermore only measure a single degree of freedom in the final field configuration .",
    "this could , for example , be the ocean surface elevation at a single point in a rogue wave setup , or an extreme velocity gradient for burgers shock formation ( see below ) .",
    "note that in contrast to the computation of transition probabilities , the exact form of the final condition of the field @xmath4 is not prescribed , but instead is recovered as part of the solution .",
    "this allows to recover the exact _ form _ in space and time of the extreme ocean surface wave form or extreme shock structure , respectively , from the formalism . in the outlined setup ,",
    "the observable takes the form @xmath29 = \\delta(f(u(x , t=0))-a)\\ ] ] for a scalar functional @xmath30 .",
    "for example , we choose @xmath31 to measure the probability of a gradient @xmath32 in the origin , or @xmath33 to measure a surface elevation of @xmath32 in the origin . in general",
    ", we can rewrite this observable as a fourier integral , @xmath34 = \\delta(f(u(x , t=0))-a ) = \\int d(i\\lambda ) \\exp\\big(\\int_{-t}^0 \\lambda ( f[u]-a ) \\delta(t ) \\big)\\ ] ] and insert it into the path integral formulation , @xmath35 \\rangle_\\eta",

    "_ instanton equations _ for the associated hamiltonian system instead @xcite .",
    "these follow from the realization that at the saddle point the variation of the functional @xmath36 $ ] with respect to the fields @xmath37 vanishes , leading to    [ eq : instanton_t ] @xmath38 + \\chi p \\label{eq : instanton_t1}\\\\       \\dot p & = -(\\nabla b[u])^t p + \\lambda\\nabla f[u ]                \\delta(t)\\ , , \\label{eq : instanton_t2 }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath39 is meant in the functional sense with respect to the field variable .",
    "now , the second term of the auxiliary equation , @xmath40 \\delta(t)$ ] , which incorporates the observable , acts only on the final time @xmath28 .",
    "it can therefore be understood as a _ final condition _ for the auxiliary field @xcite . on the other hand ,",
    "the final configuration of the field @xmath4 is not known .",
    "for this reason , global minimization techniques are harder to implement in this case .",
    "though in principle a modification of the variational formulation   is possible in terms of e.g. penalty methods which enforce the constraint on the final field configuration , integrating the equations of motions is a much more natural approach : the boundary constraints are automatically fulfilled when propagating the initial configuration of @xmath4 forward in time via equation  , while propagating the final conditions of @xmath18 backwards in time via equation  .",
    "the final field configuration @xmath41 adheres the constraints of the observable and at the same time yields the most probable composition of the unconstrained degrees of freedom .",
    "note also , that equation   resembles the original stochastic system , with the random noise @xmath7 being replaced by the convolution @xmath42 .",
    "a solution of the instanton equations   therefore not only allows for a prediction of the evolution of the field leading up to the extreme event at @xmath28 , but additionally yields the corresponding force .      we want to consider the case @xmath43 , i.e. the infinite time minimizer .",
    "this case arises in general when asking for the emergence of an extreme event out of a stationary state , which in terms of large deviations corresponds to a diffusive exit from a stable fixed point of the unperturbed dynamics . from a numerical point of view , the limit @xmath43 poses the obvious problem of how to discretize an infinite time interval appropriately .    for minimization problems of the form  ,",
    "the form of the instanton configuration is independent of the parametrization of the trajectory .",
    "it is therefore possible to reformulate the variational problem into a minimization on the space of arc - length parametrized curves instead .",
    "the modified action functional , @xmath44 = \\int_0 ^ 1 \\left ( \\|\\dot u\\|_{\\chi } \\|b[u]\\|_{\\chi } -    \\llangle \\dot u , b[u]\\rrangle_{\\chi } \\right ) ds,\\ ] ] is shown to be independent of the parametrization @xcite , such that the search space is restricted to trajectories of unit length .",
    "the metric is induced by the correlation matrix @xmath45 of the problem via @xmath46 where @xmath47 denotes the fourier transform operator and @xmath48 and the norm @xmath49 is defined accordingly .",
    "the action functional  , also termed the _",
    "geometric _ action functional , was considered in @xcite as foundation of a global minimization technique , the geometric minimum action method ( gmam ) .    in the context of this work",
    ", it is used to derive the corresponding geometric equations of motion :    [ eq : instanton ] @xmath50\\|_{\\chi}}\\left(b[u ] + \\chi\\star p\\right ) \\label{eq : instantonu}\\\\      \\dot p & = & - \\frac{\\|\\dot u\\|_{\\chi}}{\\|b[u]\\|_{\\chi } } \\big ( ( \\nabla b[u])^t p + \\lambda \\nabla f[u ] \\delta(t ) \\big ) .",
    "\\label{eq : instantonp }    \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    with this set of equations of motion it is possible to numerically discretize the instanton configuration with a finite number of grid points even if the trajectory is traversed in infinite physical time .",
    "furthermore , the arc - length parametrization , using the correlation as metric for the phase space , naturally improves the numerical resolution in phases with critical dynamics , as it automatically adapts to the evolution of the action density .",
    "above , the problem of the computation of instanton configurations has been narrowed down to numerically finding the solution to the instanton equations   or in the case of @xmath51 , together with an initial condition for the field @xmath52 and a final condition for the auxiliary field of the form @xmath53 $ ] .",
    "as the field equation and the auxiliary equation are mutually dependent , they can not be solved without knowledge of the solution of other equation .",
    "therefore , an iterative solution of the instanton equations was proposed in @xcite . for any approximation @xmath54 of the field variable",
    ", we can solve the auxiliary equation   backwards in time , starting the integration with from the final condition @xmath55 , to obtain an approximation @xmath56 .",
    "we then use this approximation to solve the field equation   forward in time , starting from its initial condition @xmath57 , to obtain the approximation @xmath58 for the field variable .",
    "the iteration is started with an initial guess for the field variable @xmath59 ( e.g. @xmath60 ) .",
    "we iterate until a fixed point is reached , at which point @xmath61 are a solution to the instanton equations .",
    "first , note that this scheme requires the storage of the field variable and the auxiliary variable for all times .",
    "this issue will be addressed below .",
    "furthermore , the instanton equations are formally very similar to the original noisy system  .",
    "the numerical solution can therefore be accomplished with a similar set of tools as the solution of the underlying fluid equation . in particular , for the field equation it is possible to reuse existing codes that solve a stochastically forced fluid system and simply replace the random force with the deterministic term @xmath62 .",
    "the auxiliary field , as visible in the example applications below , usually has a very similar structure .",
    "this is in contrast to the variational approach , which requires the development of a new toolset to numerically minimize the action functional .",
    "the most obvious challenge in computing the instanton in the above laid out fashion for large systems is the requirements in memory .",
    "both for global minimization techniques and for iterative solutions of the equations of motion , the field configuration has to be computed _ and saved _ for every instance in time , which basically increases the problem dimension by one . for a class of related problems ,",
    "an effective algorithm is proposed in @xcite which scales as @xmath63 in memory consumption instead of @xmath64 , with only a logarithmic increase in computational cost . in this section",
    ", we present the extension of this algorithm to the class of mutually dependent initial / final value problems in the case of instanton equations with large scale force correlations .",
    "note that similar ideas are known in the field of pde constrained optimization as `` checkpointing '' @xcite .",
    "the instanton equations represent a mixed initial / final value problem : half of the unknowns are given an initial value and propagated forward in time , while the others are given a final value and are propagated backwards in time .",
    "these conditions are also encountered in other physical contexts , e.g. the transport of a passive scalar by an evolving flow with a given final density , as described in @xcite .",
    "consider a simpler system of equations of the form    [ eq : modelproblem ] @xmath65    with @xmath66 , as considered in @xcite .",
    "the naive way to solve the system would be to first solve equation   forward in time , starting with the initial condition @xmath67 at @xmath68 , while saving the complete evolution of @xmath69 along the way , and subsequently solving equation   backward in time , starting from @xmath70 at @xmath71 , using the previous solution @xmath69 to evaluate @xmath72 along the way .",
    "this approach is @xmath64 in both memory and computing time .",
    "it represents the worst case in memory usage ( every time - step is saved ) and the optimal case in computation time ( every time - step is only computed once ) .",
    "the other extreme would be to only compute equation   backwards in time , starting from @xmath70 at @xmath71 , and computing the needed @xmath69 at each instance in time by integrating equation   from @xmath68 to @xmath73 . here , the memory cost is @xmath74 , while the computational cost scales like @xmath75 .",
    "of course , this variant is only possible due to the fact that equation   is independent of the field @xmath18 . in the case of mutual dependence , such as the system of instanton equations",
    ", this variant does not apply .",
    "a sensible compromise between memory and computing time can be achieved when realizing that both above algorithms can be used as building blocks in the following sense : divide the interval @xmath76 $ ] into @xmath77 sub - intervals .",
    "compute the solution of equation   forward in time from @xmath68 to @xmath71 , saving @xmath69 along the way only at the start of each of the @xmath77 intervals .",
    "now , it is possible to solve the original problem on each sub - interval of size @xmath78 with either of the two algorithms from above .",
    "note that this modification merely changes the constants , but does not modify the scaling behavior of memory and computing time .    .",
    "each square represents one of the 16 time - steps , showing steps computed but subsequently dropped ( red ) , computed and saved to memory ( blue / dark ) and loaded from memory ( yellow / light ) .",
    "total memory requirement is the maximum number of green and blue boxes in a line ( 5 in this example ) , which is @xmath63 .",
    "total computation time is the total number of red and green boxes ( 33 in this example ) , which is @xmath79 . ]    finally , since for each sub - interval the problem in structure resembles the original problem , the division outlined above can be recursively repeated , until the interval size corresponds to the time discretization @xmath80 . at this point",
    ", no further solution inside the sub - interval is necessary , since the interval represents only one integration step .",
    "as inspired by similar principles in multi - grid algorithms or the fast fourier - transform , a natural choice is @xmath81 .",
    "then , the memory requirement scales as @xmath63 and computing time as @xmath82 .",
    "a schematic depiction of the algorithm for @xmath81 is shown in figure  [ fig : recursive ] .",
    "for the initial solution of the field equation , the field is stored at the intermediate timesteps @xmath83 , of which the last 3 can immediately be used for the backwards propagating auxiliary equation . whenever a timestep is encountered for which the field configuration is not stored , it is propagated forward again from the last known position , while storing intermediate values again in the fashion lined out above .",
    "the choice @xmath81 proves to be a good compromise between memory and computing time , even though any @xmath77 is admissible to use the available memory at optimal efficiency ( even fractional @xmath77 are possible , choosing the interval boundaries at @xmath84 , @xmath85 ) . in the following section",
    ", we will apply this algorithm to instanton equations of the form   by taking advantage of the form of the forcing correlation  .",
    "in fact , the instanton equations   are not of the form of equation  : equations   and mutually depend on each other , prohibiting the purely recursive form lined out above , because neither @xmath4 nor @xmath18 can be integrated without knowledge of the other field .",
    "it is therefore necessary to store at least one field completely .",
    "yet , the dependence of the @xmath4-equation on the @xmath18 is solely through the term @xmath86 , which , due to its compact support in fourier space ( equation  ) , acts only on few modes .",
    "the convolution of the auxiliary field with the forcing correlation can therefore be seen as a projection on the active modes of the forcing .",
    "consequently it is advantageous , instead of saving any of the field configurations @xmath4 or @xmath18 , to only store the projection , i.e. the non - vanishing modes of the field @xmath86 for all time - steps .",
    "from this one can reconstruct the velocity field @xmath4 in the recursive manner lined out above .",
    "this approach does not recover the @xmath63 scaling in memory , but restricts the number of degrees of freedom in every other dimension , therefore preserving advantageous memory requirements .",
    "more importantly , since the physical cut - off scale @xmath87 is a constant , the memory cost of the auxiliary field becomes independent of the number of degrees of freedom in space @xmath88 .",
    "also note that in some applications it is actually feasible to integrate the whole auxiliary equation   in the convoluted field variable instead . even though this approach does",
    "not reduces the number of active modes ( as mixing of modes is possible through the nonlinear drift term ) , it provides a beneficial mollification of the auxiliary variable due to the large - scale nature of the correlation function @xmath89 .",
    "we now present several applications of the proposed algorithm .",
    "every integration of the instanton equations   is done with a second order runge - kutta integrator in time .",
    "spatial derivatives are computed with a pseudo - spectral scheme using fast fourier transforms ( fft ) . due to the high memory efficiency of the presented algorithm",

    "using only either the recursive algorithm or the compactness of the forcing ( denoted as `` @xmath62 '' ) roughly halves the memory usage . combining both methods leads to an improvement of memory efficiency of more than a factor @xmath99 ( @xmath100 mb naive vs.  @xmath101 mb optimized ) .",
    "[ fig : memuse1d ] ]    the physical implications of this choice are discussed in @xcite . in particular , the computation of the instanton for the observable   allows the computation of the shape of the far left tail for the velocity gradient probability distribution function .",
