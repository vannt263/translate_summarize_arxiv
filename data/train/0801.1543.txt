    "however , the main voltage dependences obtained above and those which can be found using the drift - diffusion model of the electron transport in the active region of the channel should be essentially the same . in some sense",
    ", the situation is similar to that which occurs in the theory of the schottky diodes and conventional p - n- junctions when the so - called thermionic and diffusion models are compared  @xcite .",
    "one can see that the device model used above adequately describes the operation of gnr - fets with realistic parameters at reasonable applied voltages .",
    "in conclusion , we developed an analytical device model for gnr - fets .",
    "the gnr - fet current - voltage characteristics , i.e. , the dependencies of the source - drain current versus the drain voltage as well as the back gate and top gate voltages , were calculated for the devices with different geometric parameters ( thicknesses of the gate layers and the top gate length ) using this model .",
    "in particular , we showed that shortening of the top ( controlling ) gate dives rise to a substantial transformation of the gnr - fet current - voltage characteristics ( the short - gate effect ) .",
    "the model can be used for the gnr - fet optimization .",
