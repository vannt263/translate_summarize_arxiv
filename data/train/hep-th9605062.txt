    "there is growing evidence that some disordered systems at criticality share two unusual features : the existence of logarithmic operators in the spectrum of the theory and the existence of an infinite number of relevant operators with negative conformal dimensions .",
    "logarithmic operators seem to be connected to hidden continuous symmetries . in @xcite logarithmic operators",
    "were found to generate a change in a coupling constant of the effective wznw action for @xmath2 , @xmath3 , obtained after use of the replica trick .",
    "the existence of an infinite number of conformal operators @xcite means that there is an infinite number of relevant perturbations which render the critical point unstable .",
    "such a set of conformal dimensions is also related to the phenomenon of multifractality .",
    "our aim in this paper is to show that both features follow naturally from a supersymmetric treatment of the disorder .",
    "we consider the two - dimensional random bond ising model at criticality and the random dirac model in @xmath4 dimensions .",
    "these gaussian models allow a supersymmetric formulation of averages over disorder @xcite .",
    "one identifies a global superalgebra symmetry of the effective action and assumes it is enhanced to an affine symmetry at a new critical point @xcite , as happened at the pure critical point .",
    "one then derives the sugawara stress - energy tensor and obtains the set of conformal dimensions associated with the primary fields .",
    "additional constraints such as locality allow to further restrict the operator content of the theory .",
    "this provides a class of , possibly disordered , critical points in two spatial dimensions .",
    "the specific structure of the superalgebra implies that such dimensions can generically be negative .",
    "the presence of logarithmic operators is also straightforward from the point of view of this algebra . unlike ordinary lie algebras ,",
    "superalgebras have indecomposable ( not fully reducible ) representations .",
    "it is then possible to show on general grounds that such representations imply the existence of logarithmic operators and logarithms in correlation functions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we briefly recall the supersymmetric approach for the random bond ising model and the random dirac model . in section 3",
    "we write down the @xmath5 current algebra and find the sugawara stress - tensor . in section 4",
    "we briefly review the representations of @xmath6 and obtain the conformal weights of primary fields . in section 5",
    "we derive the quantization of @xmath1 from locality constraints . in section 6",
    "we show how indecomposable representations lead to logarithmic operators and consider an atypical representation . in section 7",
    "we obtain some logarithm - dependent four - point functions .",
    "we conclude in section 8 .",
    "the supersymmetric method is applicable to models which are gaussian at fixed disorder , but it provides a good starting point for disentangling properties of a large class of disordered conformal field theories .",
    "the study of the random bond ising model reveals that an appropriate algebraic framework for studying gaussian disordered systems at criticality should be based on affine lie superalgebra with zero superdimension . in the case of the random ising model",
    "this algebra is @xmath7 .",
    "the fact that the algebra has an equal number of bosonic and fermionic generators ensures that the virasoro central charge of the sugawara stress - tensor vanishes .",
    "this is needed by construction for a disordered system .",
    "the vanishing of the central charge does not imply the triviality of the theory since it is not unitary .",
    "the relevance of affine lie superalgebras was independently realized in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "we now briefly recall the supersymmetric method for the study of the random bond ising model and the random dirac model .",
    "these models have been analyzed using the replica method in refs .",
    "the random bond ising model has also been studied in the context of massless scattering theories @xcite .    in the scaling limit , near criticality",
    ", the ising model is described by a massive real majorana fermion with mass @xmath8 were @xmath9 is the critical temperature . in the presence of disorder , _",
    "i.e. _ when the coupling constants between sites belong to a random set , the mass becomes a function of space position .",
    "the random ising model is defined by the action @xmath10 : @xmath11=\\int \\frac{d^2x}{4\\pi } \\left ( \\psi \\partial_\\zb \\psi + \\ov{\\psi } \\partial_z   \\ov{\\psi } + i\\ , m ( x ) \\ov{\\psi } \\psi \\right ) \\label{act1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are grassmanian fields .",

    "the harris criterion tells us that randomness in the bond interaction is marginal in the 2d ising model .",
    "it turns out that it is not exactly marginal but only marginally irrelevant . at criticality",
    "the disorder only induces logarithmic corrections to the pure system .    in order to compute averages of products of correlation functions",
    "one introduces a number of copies of fermions and of their supersymmetric partners equal to the number of correlation functions in the product @xcite .",
    "one then rewrites these averages as fermionic and bosonic path integrals . for the ising model with @xmath17",
    "one obtains the following effective action for the disorder average of the product of two correlation functions : @xmath18 with _ pert=(_- _",

    "the @xmath12 are complex fermions and @xmath19 and @xmath20 are complex bosonic fields .",
    "this action can be viewed as a perturbation of the ( non - unitary ) conformal field theory specified by the action @xmath21 .",
    "this fixes the normalization of the fields to be : @xmath22 the central charge of the virasoro algebra is zero .",
    "note that since the fermions @xmath23 have dimension one half the perturbing field @xmath24 has dimension two .",
    "it is therefore marginal .",
    "the conformal field theory specified by @xmath21 is invariant under an affine supersymmetric algebra whose conserved currents are : g_(z ) = ( z)_(z ) & , & g_(z ) = ( z)_(z ) , + k(z ) = ^2(z ) & , & k(z)=^2(z ) , + j(z)=:_-(z)_+(z ) : & , & h(z)=:(z)(z ) : .[curr ] the dots refer to fermionic and bosonic normal ordering",

    "the perturbing field can also be written as a bilinear in the currents , _ pert=2 .",
    "in other words the perturbation ( [ pert1 ] ) is a current - current perturbation .",

    "we also supposed that all the primary fields allowed by the @xmath6 selection rules ( and their descendants ) appear in the ope . for a kac - moody algebra",
    "this is not always the case ; the operator content of the theory depends on the value of the level @xmath1 .",

    "this gives rise to differential equations for the correlation functions of the operators @xmath49 and @xmath50 , through the conformal ward identities for @xmath52 .",
    "let us determine the two - point functions of these operators .",
    "the @xmath53 differential equations for these correlation functions are & ( z_z+2)=0 , ( z_z+2)+a=0 , + & ( z_z+2)+a+ a=0 , while for @xmath54 we have & ( z_z+2)+2 a=0 , + & ( z_z+2)+ 2 a = 0 .",

    "we now consider the generic case where @xmath140 is not an integer .",
    "contrary to what happens in the preceding section , it does not seem possible to isolate a solution which is regular at both @xmath119 and @xmath118 .",
    "a solution regular at 0 will have a logarithmic singularity at @xmath118 and vice - versa .",
    "this means that there is no way to get rid of logarithms if the correlators are not vanishing .",
    "we expect that there should be logarithmic operators , and the knowledge of the four - point functions allows one to find the ope s of the fields we consider , including the logarithmic ones .",
    "we now turn to the third and last possible scenario where @xmath141 is an integer but @xmath133 is not an integer : @xmath142 , @xmath143 .",
    "the theory of fuchsian differential equations indicates that there might be a solution with a @xmath144 dependence .",
    "a careful analysis shows that this is indeed the case .",
    "and again it seems impossible to isolate a logarithm - free solution .",
    "however one has to modify the form of @xmath127 .",
    "write the solutions as & f_a^(0)(z)=f_a(z ) , f_a^(1)(z)=f_a(z ) z + h_a(z ) , & + & f_a^(2)(z)=f_a(z ) ^2 z + 2 h_a(z ) z + g_a(z ) .",
    "& then the monodromy invariant combinations around @xmath119 are f_ab(z,)&= & _ 0 f_a^(0)(z ) f_b^(0 ) ( ) + _ 1 ( f_a^(0)(z ) f_b^(1 ) ( ) + f_a^(1)(z ) f_b^(0 ) ( ) ) + & + & _ 2 ( f_a^(0)(z ) f_b^(2 ) ( ) + f_a^(2)(z ) f_b^(0 ) ( ) + 2 f_a^(1)(z ) f_b^(1 ) ( ) ) .",
    "we expect such a form to be also invariant around 1 without any additional constraint on the @xmath125 . again , because there is no solution free of logarithms one expects a @xmath145 dependence if the physical correlators do not vanish .",
    "the current superalgebra approach to gaussian disordered systems provides a unifying framework for determining exponents of the models and correlation functions .",
    "the logarithmic dependence of correlation functions at critical points is traced back to indecomposable representations which are common in superalgebras .",
    "_ chiral _ correlation functions possess a logarithmic dependence .",
    "however for values of the level @xmath1 for which the theories have good locality properties , the physical operators do not have a logarithmic dependence .",
    "this conclusion was not apparent from the start ; it came out of imposing crossing symmetry .",
    "it is not clear at this stage what is the significance of the logarithmic operators in the context of the disordered systems .",
    "if they have vanishing dimension , as is the case here , they might be related to the density of states .",
    "the correlation functions with @xmath146 and @xmath145 dependence provide examples of correlators whose existence was predicted in @xcite .",
    "the negative conformal weights are natural in this treatment of disorder because one is considering non - unitary theories at @xmath147",
    ". it should be also possible to obtain similar results by considering @xmath148 models of cosets of kac - moody superalgebras .",
