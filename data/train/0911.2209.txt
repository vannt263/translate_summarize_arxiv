    "the kondo model gives a simplified description of the interaction of a single magnetic impurity with the conduction electrons in a host , with hamiltonian : @xmath4 here @xmath5 is the impurity spin operator and @xmath6 is the electron spin density at position @xmath7 : s_(r)^ _ _ ( r)where @xmath8 annihilates a conduction electron of spin @xmath9 at @xmath7 and repeated spin indices are summed over .",
    "we will focus on the case @xmath10 although much of the discussion here carries over to higher spin .",
    "the dispersion relation will often be assumed to be that of free electrons : _ k = k^22m-_f , although that is not crucial .",
    "( for a general review of the kondo model , see ref .  [ ] . )",
    "essentially the same model can be used to describe a quantum dot in the coulomb blockade regime in a spin 1/2 state , interacting with one or more metallic leads ( which can be formed by a 2 dimensional electron gas or by quantum wires in a semi - conductor inversion layer ) .",
    "the dimensionless parameter which measures the strength of the kondo interaction is @xmath11 where @xmath12 is the density of states at the fermi energy . for the free electron dispersion in d dimensions , this is : _",
    "d = k_f^d-1/(c_dv_f)where @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 .",
    "typically @xmath16 suggesting that perturbation theory could be useful .",

    "it is found that the leading logarithmic divergences can be summed by expressing perturbation theory in terms of the renormalized coupling constant at scale @xmath18 : ( e)_0 + _ 0 ^ 2(d / e)+  note that @xmath21 increases in magnitude , as @xmath18 is lowered , assuming it is initially positive ( antiferromagnetic ) .",
    "@xmath21 obeys the renormalization group equation : =( ) = -(e)^2+(1/2)(e)^3 +  [ rge]where @xmath22 is the @xmath23-function . keeping only the quadratic term in this rg equation",
    ", we find : ( e)[lambdae]note that @xmath24 , the bare coupling , is the value of the renormalized coupling at the ultraviolet scale , @xmath20 .",
    "as the energy scale is lowered , @xmath25 becomes of o(1 ) at the kondo energy scale : k_bt_k = de^-1/_0 .",
    "this renormalization group equation , ( [ rge ] ) is derived by integrating out high energy fourier modes , reducing the effective bandwidth from @xmath26 , in energy units , to @xmath27 .",
    "once the bandwidth becomes narrow ( as happens at low energies ) the width in wave - vector is related to the width in energy by @xmath28 where @xmath2 is the fermi velocity .",
    "thus we may equally well describe @xmath21 as the effective coupling at wave - vector scale @xmath29 as at energy @xmath18 . from this perspective",
    ", @xmath30 is the characteristic wave - vector scale at which the effective kondo coupling becomes large .",
    "thus it is natural to introduce the kondo length scale : _ kv_f/(k_bt_k)(we henceforth set @xmath31 and @xmath32 to one . )",
    "it seems appropriate to think of the effective kondo coupling as growing at large distances , becoming large at length scales of order @xmath3 .",
    "equivalently , we might expect physical quantities depending on a length scale @xmath33 to be scaling functions of the ratio @xmath34 rather than depending on @xmath33 and @xmath3 separately .",
    "there is an interesting analogy here with quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) the theory of the strong interactions in high energy physics .",
    "the renormalization group equation for the effective qcd coupling , @xmath35 , ( describing the interactions of gluons with themselves and with quarks ) is the same as eq .",
    "( [ rge ] ) at quadratic order",
    ". it also gets large as the energy scale is lowered , and small as it is raised . in this case , one switches back and forth from energy units to momentum units using the velocity of light , @xmath36 . the characteristic energy scale , @xmath37 where @xmath35 becomes @xmath38 is of order 1 gev , the mass of the proton , and the corresponding length scale is or order the compton wavelength of the proton , 1 fermi or @xmath39 m. if the quarks inside a proton are probed with high energy ( short wavelength ) photons they appear nearly free . on the other hand , they exhibit confinement ( with an interaction growing linearly with separation ) at long distances . in high energy physics",
    "it is commonplace to go back and forth freely between energy and length units using @xmath36 ( and @xmath32 ) .",
    "however , there are well understood pitfalls in taking this picture of the effective coupling getting weak at high energies and strong at low energies , too literally .",
    "( these pitfalls occur both in the energy and distance picture , and do not seem to be particularly related to the distance viewpoint . ) in this review article , we will be concerned with the validity of the corresponding picture for the kondo model .",
    "the @xmath40-function form of the kondo interaction implies that only the s - wave harmonic interacts with the impurity so that the model becomes fundamentally 1-dimensional .",
    "after linearizing the dispersion relation about the fermi surface , the low energy effective hamiltonian becomes : @xmath41 + v_f\\lambda   \\vec s_{\\hbox{imp}}\\cdot \\vec s_{\\hbox{el}}(0).\\label{h1d}\\ ] ] here @xmath33 is the radial coordinate and @xmath42 represent incoming and outgoing waves , with the boundary condition : _",

    "[ ] so that : \\{_l^(r),_l(r)}=2(r - r).in the limit of zero kondo interactions , @xmath45 , this describes a relativistic dirac fermion with the fermi velocity playing the role of the velocity of light .",
    "in such a model it is natural to go back and forth between energy and length units using @xmath2 .",
    "note that it is crucial to this estimate of @xmath3 that only one channel ( the s - wave ) couples to the kondo impurity , allowing a mapping into a 1d model . while this happens in a variety of circumstances , including the case of a quantum dot coupled to 2deg s , there are also important cases where it can fail , which will be discussed later",
    ".    an intuitive picture of this kondo length scale can be obtained from considering the low energy strong coupling behavior of the model .",
    "this is most easily understood from a 1 dimensional tight - binding version of the model with hamiltonian : @xmath46 the strong coupling limit is easily understood .",
    "when @xmath47 , one electron gets trapped at the origin to form a singlet with the impurity spin .",
    "note that this `` kondo screening '' actually corresponds to the formation of an entangled state between the impurity spin and one conduction electron .",
    "the other electrons can do whatever they want except that they can not enter or leave the origin since this would break up the kondo singlet , costing an energy of @xmath48 .",
    "they effectively feel an infinite repulsion from the origin , corresponding to a @xmath49 phase shift .",
    "this is simply a boundary condition on otherwise free electrons .    while the strong coupling limit is trivial , we are actually interested in the case of weak bare coupling , at low energies and long distances , where the effective coupling becomes strong .",
    "it is known from various approximate and exact calculations that the low energy physics ( at @xmath50 ) is described by a local spin singlet state and non - interacting electrons with a @xmath49 phase shift .",
    "on the other hand , the physics at intermediate energy scales , of @xmath51 is complicated . to form a spin singlet with an s=1/2 impurity ,",
    "only one electron is needed and an intuitive picture is that one electron is `` removed from the fermi sea '' for this purpose . however , unlike the simple case of large bare coupling , it would be quite wrong to think that this electron is localized at the origin .",
    "the natural length scale over which we may think of this electron s wave - function being non - negligible is @xmath3 .",
    "such a naive picture must be used with caution . at best , it is valid only at long distances and low energies .",
    "if we probe the screened impurity with a long wavelength probe , this picture may apply . at shorter distances",
    ", it certainly breaks down .",
    "while this is only an intuitive picture , it nonetheless seems reasonable that @xmath3 will appear as a characteristic scale in any distance dependent physical property of a kondo system .",
    "the nature of the crossover at @xmath3 is the subject of this review .",
    "nozires local fermi liquid theory is well - known to provide a powerful way of studying the behaviour of distance - independent quantities at low @xmath52 .",
    "it turns out to also be useful for studying distance - dependent quantities at large distances @xmath53 . in this approach ,",
    "the screened impurity spin is eliminated from the effective hamiltonian which , in lowest approximation , just consists of non - interacting electrons with a @xmath49 phase shift .",
    "then , interactions at the origin are added for these phase shifted electrons , which originate from virtual excitations of the screened impurity complex .",
    "we may simply list all possible interactions at the origin allowed by symmetry .",
    "assuming exact particle - hole symmetry , there is only one important leading irrelevant interaction : h_=-v_f^26t_kj_l^2(0).[hfl]here the current operator is defined as : j_l(r)_l^(r)2_l(r).@xmath54 contains a dimension 2 operator , so its coupling constant must have dimensions of inverse energy . on general grounds , we expect that this coupling constant will be of order the crossover scale , @xmath55 .",
    "the factor of @xmath56 in eq .",
    "( [ hfl ] ) is just a matter of convenience . with this normalization , a calculation of the impurity susceptibility , to first order in this interaction",
    "gives : ( t).we emphasize that various other definitions of @xmath0 are in common use , differing by factors of o(1 ) .    perhaps surprisingly , distance dependent aspects of kondo physics are much less well - studied than energy dependent ones . at a theoretical level this may be a consequence of the fact that it is very difficult to get distance dependence from two of the most powerful methods of studying the kondo effect : the numerical renormalization group ( nrg ) method , introduced by wilson,@xcite and the bethe ansatz ( ba ) solution , discovered by andrei@xcite and weigmann@xcite .",
    "the difficulty with nrg lies in the `` logarithmic discretization '' or the fact that an effective 1d tight binding model is introduced in which the hopping parameter decays exponentially with distance from the impurity .",
    "this is , in fact , only an approximation to the full problem and one which seems to fail to keep track of length - dependence properly .",
    "however , more recently a way around this difficulty is being exploited@xcite which involves a more complicated and numerically costly version of nrg .",
    "the difficulty with ba seems to be that while exact wave - functions are calculated , they are given in such a complicated form that it is very challenging to calculate any green s functions with them .",
    "thus much of our understanding of length dependence comes from perturbation theory and analytic rg arguments , various mean field theories , exact diagonalization of short systems and density matrix renormalization group ( dmrg ) numerical results which are also restricted to fairly short systems ( up to 32 sites ) .",
    "the reasons why this exponentially large scale , @xmath57 , has never been seen experimentally are probably that the associated crossover effects at this length scale are rather weak and subtle and that the basic kondo model may not be adequate to describe the experimental systems used .",
    "some inprovements to the model that might be neccessary are : including charge fluctuations ( as in the anderson model ) taking into account a finite density of magnetic impurities , taking into account a finite density of non - magnetic impurities and taking into account electron - electron interactions even away from the impurity location .",
    "thus searches for effects at this length scale represent both an experimental challenge to find sufficiently ideal systems and also an opportunity to study the limits of validity of the basic model .",
    "we will be concerned with two types of length dependence .",
    "the first type , analysed in sec .",
    "[ sec : inf ] , involves a single impurity in an infinite host , described by the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hk ] ) .",
    "we consider various observables as a function of distance from the impurity .",
    "the first one ( sub - section [ sec : knight ] ) is the knight shift , measurable in nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) experiments .",
    "this is simply the magnetic polarization of the electrons as a function of distance from the impurity , in linear response to a magnetic field ( applied to both the impurity and the conduction electrons ) .",
    "the second ( sub - section [ sec : friedel ] ) is the charge density ( friedel ) oscillations , as a function of distance from the impurity .",
    "these could be observed by scanning tunneling microscopy ( stm ) for a magnetic impurity on a metallic surface . the third ( subsection [ sec : corr ] )",
    "is the ground state equal time correlation function of the impurity spin and electron spin density at distance @xmath33 from the impurity . while probably not experimentally observable , this has a rather direct interpretation in terms of measuring the spatial probability distribution for the electron forming the spin singlet with the impurity .",
    "the second type of length dependence , analysed in sec .",
    "[ sec : meso ] , occurs in mesocopic samples containing a single localized s=1/2 where the size of some part of the device is comparable to @xmath3 .",
    "here we consider four different situations .",
    "two of them involve a s=1/2 quantum dot coupled to a finite length one - dimensional quantum wire . in the first case , ( subsection [ sec : pers ] ) this wire is closed into a ring and we consider the persistent current through it as a function of the ring length and magnetic flux . in the second case , ( subsection [ sec : steps ] ) the ring is straight with the quantum dot coupled to one end and the other end open . in subsection [ sec : transport ] we discuss an s=1/2 quantum dot embedded in the centre of a finite length quantum wire which is tunnel - coupled to leads . in subsection",
    "[ sec : box ] , we contrast these strictly 1d models with the case of a magnetic impurity inside a three dimensional magnetic sample containing non - magnetic disorder : the kondo box model.@xcite given certain simplifying assumptions about the disorder , the characteristic kondo length scale is much smaller than @xmath58 .",
    "it turns out that this is not just a consequence of the 3 dimensionality but also of the disorder . in an ideal 3d kondo box @xmath3",
    "would again be the characteristic length , as we discuss .",
    "electron - electron interactions away from the impurity are ignored in all sections except [ sec : steps ] , a quantum dot at the end of a finite quantum wire , where they are included using luttinger liquid techniques .",
    "[ sec : conclude ] contains conclusions .",
    "in this section , we consider the hamiltonian of eq .",
    "( [ hk ] ) for a single impurity interacting with electrons in an infinite volume .",
    "this is the traditional model for magnetic impurities in a metal .",
    "note , however , that we ignore the presence of other impurities .",
    "a simplifying feature of this situation is that the mapping onto a single channel 1d system is exact . as we will see in sub - section",
    "[ sec : box ] , this is not generally the case when we put a 3d system into a finite box .",
    "reflections off the boundary of the `` box '' greatly complicate the model .",
    "an immediate question that arises is : how dilute must the magnetic impurities be to justify a single impurity approximation ? given the screening cloud picture , one might come to the pessimistic conclusion that the average separation of impurities should be much larger than @xmath3 : n_^-1/3_k ? ?",
    "( here @xmath59 is the impurity density . )",
    "such low densities are rarely , perhaps never , acheived in experiments on metals with dilute concentrations of magnetic impurities .",
    "since typical ratios of @xmath3 to lattice constant can be in the thousands this would require densities @xmath60 per unit cell .",
    "the reason@xcite that the condition is much weaker than this is basically that screening cloud wave - functions around different impurities become nearly orthogonal even when their centres are much closer together than their size . to see this",
    "consider two spherically symmetric wave - functions , centred around the points @xmath61 but otherwise identical , only containing fourier modes within a narrow band of wave - vectors of width @xmath62 around @xmath63 .",
    "the overlap is : o(r)=d^3r^*(|r+r/2|)(|r - r/2|).in terms of the fourier transform of the screening cloud wave - function , this becomes : o(r)=e^ikr|(k)|^2 = _",
    "0^dkk^2|(k)|^2(kr)2 ^ 2kr.we expect the screening cloud wave - function to decay on the length scale @xmath3 but to oscillate at the fermi wave - vector .",
    "it should be built out of wave - vectors within @xmath62 of @xmath63 .",
    "thus we may assume : |(k)|^2(_k",
    "/ k_f^2)f[(k - k_f)_k]where the scaling function @xmath64 obeys the normalization conditon : dy f(y)=2 ^ 2 in order that @xmath65 .",
    "thus , o(r)=(1/2 ^ 2)dy f(y)/k_fr.for @xmath66 , this reduces to : o(r)=(k_fr)/k_frindependent of the details of the wave - function . thus screening clouds centred on different impurities have negigible overlap provided that they are separated by a distance @xmath67 .",
    "a simple estimate of the condition for validity of the single impurity kondo model is provided by the nozeres exhaustion principle .",
    "there must be enough available conduction electron states , within @xmath62 of the fermi wave - vector , to form linearly independent screening wave - functions around each impurity .",
    "this gives the conditions on the average impurity separation : n_imp^-1/3 & & _",
    "k^1/3k_f^-2/3   ( 3d ) + n_imp^-1/2 & & _ k^1/2k_f^-1/2   ( 2d ) + n_imp^-1 & & _ k   ( 1d ) .",
    "the knight shift is proportional to the @xmath33-dependent polarization of the electron spin density in linear response to an applied magnetic field . in nmr experiments , the total effective magnetic field felt by a nucleus",
    "is measured , from the nuclear resonance frequency .",
    "in addition to the applied magnetic field there is an additional contribution arising from the hyperfine interaction between the nuclear spin and the surrounding electron spins .",
    "assuming for simplicity that this hyperfine interaction is very short range , the knight - shift is just proportional to the local spin density at the location of the nucleus .",
    "for sufficiently weak applied fields , this is @xmath68 , the local susceptibility . in the absence , of the magnetic impurity , this is simply the @xmath33-independent pauli susceptibility , @xmath69 .",
    "the kondo interaction leads to an additional @xmath33-dependent term , which vanishes far from the impurity .",
    "let s_d^3rs_(r),[sel]be the total electron spin operator .",
    "the total conserved spin operator is : s_s_+s_. [ stot ] the @xmath33-dependent magnetic susceptibility is : ( r)/t .",
    "@xmath70 contains a constant term , present at zero kondo coupling , which is simply the usual pauli susceptibility , @xmath71 . since",
    "only the s - wave harmonic couples to the impurity spin , the other terms come entirely from the s - wave component of the electron field .",
    "it is convenient to take advantange of the boundary condition of eq .",
    "( [ freebc ] ) , to make an `` unfolding transformation '' , regarding @xmath72 as the continuation of @xmath73 to the negative @xmath33-axis : _",

    "the behaviour of the kondo box model follows immediately from the discussion of the 1d models earlier in this section , if we make the corresponding replacement for @xmath303 . as usual ,",
    "finite size effects become important when @xmath323 , the bulk kondo temperature is of order the level spacing .",
    "this implies@xcite that grains of order 10 nm . in linear dimension",
    "are required to see finite size effects , considerably smaller than the estimate of 1 micron in the 1d case .",
    "the behaviour of this model seems to contradict the naive kondo screening cloud picture since there are essentially no finite size effects even when the linear dimension of the grain is much smaller than @xmath58 .",
    "in fact , the behaviour of this model depends strongly on the assumptions 1 and 2 , above , which certainly do nt always apply . to make this point",
    "it is instructive , as a thought experiment , to consider another model of an ultra - small grain which is far less realistic than even the above one .",
    "imagine that    1 .",
    "the grain is completely clean with no disorder 2 .",
    "the kondo interaction is short range and spherically symmetric , the standard assumptions in the kondo model 3 .",
    "the grain is perfectly spherical with the impurity atom exactly at the centre    in this case , we may expand in spherical harmonics and project onto the s - wave , as usual .",
    "the s - wave model is essentially the one studied in sub - section [ sec : knight ] , with the impurity spin at one end of a finite length 1d wire . now",
    "finite size effects set in when the length @xmath173 is of order @xmath132 as discussed above .",
    "the essential difference between the two models ( or two sets of assumptions ) is that in the second case most of the states of the metal have zero ( or negligible ) coupling to the impurity , whereas in the first case , all states are assumed to have equal coupling . in the second model",
    "only the s - wave states couple , a negligible fraction of the total set of states .",
    "this happens because the higher harmonic wave - functions all vanish at the origin , where the impurity is assumed to be located .",
    "note also that the kondo temperature will be much lower for this spherical model since the relevant density of states , appearing in the dimensionless kondo coupling , scales with the volume in the first case but only as the length in the second .",
    "the behaviour of the second model is very strongly dependent on the assumptions , as can be seen by relaxing only the third of them .",
    "suppose that we allow the surface of the grain to have a non - spherical shape .",
    "then the usual wave - functions , involving products of spherical harmonics and spherical bessel functions , are no longer eigenstates of the non - interacting model . if we insist on using this basis , then the impurity only interacts with the s - wave as usual .",
    "however , the reflections of the spherical harmonic wave - functions off the walls of the grain mix these wave - functions together .",
    "actually , analogous phenomena occur in the 1d models considered earlier in this section if we take more realistic models of the quantum wires with several channels,@xcite corresponding to transverse wave - functions .",
    "consider , for example , the model in sec .",
    "[ sec : steps ] of a quantum dot at the end of a finite length quantum wire , which has several channels .",
    "the quantum dot hybridizes with some linear combination of channels in the wire .",
    "we can always adopt a basis such that one basis state is the one hybridizing with the quantum dot .",
    "however , these states are mixed by scattering off the other end of the wire ( away from the quantum dot ) .",
    "a simple , intuitive picture , is that the screening cloud wave - function is now a linear superposition of the various channels , or the screening cloud folds back upon itself many times inside the wire , due to the reflections off the ends .",
    "if the wire has @xmath179 channels , its effective length could be as long as @xmath324 .",
    "an important point is that embedding a kondo spin in a finite system typically destroys one of the key simplifying features of the kondo model - that the impurity spin only couples to one channel of unperturbed eigenstates ( eg . the s - wave ) .",
    "the only case where we can be sure this assumption is still valid is when the finite system is an ideal single channel 1d system .",
    "depending on various assumptions about the grain shape , magnetic impurity location and disorder , one could imagine the kondo temperature at which finite size effects set in ranging anywhere from order @xmath325 to order @xmath326 .",
    "in all cases , we expect that the condition for finite size effects to be important is that @xmath0 be of order the finite size gap , suitably weighted by the hybridization of the corresponding wave - functions with the impurity . only in single - channel situations",
    "does the simple kondo screening cloud picture apply .    note",
    "that this complication makes observation of the screening cloud relatively easier in bulk situations where there are no boundaries to mix the hybridizing wave - function with the other channels .",
    "however , even there , it seems likely that scattering off other kondo impurities might have a similar effect .",
    "in the standard kondo model , describing a single magnetic impurity in an infinite host , the length scale @xmath57 appears as a characteristic crossover length scale for many ( perhaps essentially all ) physical observables .",
    "some intuition about the nature of the crossover is provided by imagining that , in the ground state , the impurity spin forms a spin singlet with a single conduction electron , whose wave - function is constructed out of states within energy @xmath0 of the fermi surface and hence is spread out over a distance of order @xmath3 .",
    "one must be careful to only use this picture at low @xmath52 and even then it sould be used with caution .",
    "naively , we might expect to see weak coupling behaviour , even at @xmath146 , at distances @xmath94 and strong coupling behaviour , outside the screening cloud , at @xmath53 .",
    "while this seems to apply to the density oscillations and static impurity spin correlations , the first of these expectations turns out be be wrong , or at least to need some modifications , in the case of the knight shift .",
    "the crossover effects at @xmath3 appear to be very hard to observe experimentally , precisely because they occur at such long distances . in a d - dimensional sample ,",
    "they are suppressed by a factor of @xmath158 ( or @xmath114 ) making their observation more favourable in systems of reduced dimensionality .    in a mesoscopic single - channel 1d systems with a component of finite length , @xmath173",
    ", there is again typically a cross - over in physical quantities when @xmath3 is of order @xmath173 . in all cases ,",
    "weak coupling behaviour occurs when @xmath241 so that the screening cloud does nt `` fit '' inside the device and strong coupling behaviour occurs when @xmath242 so that finite size effects become unimportant .",
    "except in ideal circumstances , mesoscopic systems do not have only a single channel . while this is unimportant for the kondo effect in bulk",
    ", it can have important consequences for the observation of the kondo screening cloud in a mesoscopic device .",
    "for an @xmath179-channel system , the effective length `` seen '' by the kondo screening cloud may be as large as @xmath324 .    throughout most of this paper",
    "we have ignored coulomb interactions between the conduction electrons , only taking them into account at the magnetic impurity or quantum dot .",
    "while this may be justified at low @xmath83 by landau s fermi liquid theory , for d=2 or 3 , it would be necessary for the inelastic scattering length to exceed @xmath3 for our analyses to apply . in the d=1 case ,",
    "such interactions are important , even at @xmath146 .",
    "we analysed them only in a particularly simple case , the quantum dot end - coupled to a single channel quantum wire .",
    "while they somewhat reduced effects associated with the kondo screening cloud , we concluded that the effects are still present and qualitatively unchanged .",
    "another effect which can interfere with observation of the screening cloud is non - magnetic disorder .",
    "we only touched on this briefly in sec .",
    "[ sec : box ] , is our review of the `` kondo box '' model .",
    "in addition a finite density of magnetic impurities further complicates the situation .    throughout essentially",
    "all of this review , we have considered only the kondo model , not the more realistic anderson impurity model .",
    "we expect similar crossover effects to also occur in that case but with another characteristic length scale entering , where the crossover from the free orbital to ( unstable ) local moment fixed point occurs .",
    "the kondo crossover can only be observed if this other crossover occurs at a significantly shorter length than @xmath3 .",
    "after many years of theoretical and theoretical investigations , the kondo screening cloud , as predicted by the basic kondo model , remains undetected experimentally .",
    "this is likely due to a combination of experimental difficulties , and limitations of the basic kondo model .",
    "it is to be hoped that further experimental and theoretical progress will eventually bring this long search to a happy conclusion .",
    "i would like to thank all my collaborators in this work . in chronological order : erik srensen , victor barzykin , pascal simon , rodrigo pereria , nicolas laflorencie , bert halperin , hubert saleur and lazlo borda .",

    "<S> the kondo effect involves the formation of a spin singlet by a magnetic impurity and conduction electrons . </S>",
    "<S> it is characterized by a low temperature scale , the kondo temperature , @xmath0 , and an associated long length scale , @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> this kondo length is often estimated theoretically to be in the range of .1 to 1 microns but such a long characteristic length scale has never been observed experimentally . in this review , i will examine how @xmath3 appears as a crossover scale when one probes either the dependence of physical quantities an distance from the impurity or when the impurity is embedded in a finite size structure and discuss possible experiments that might finally observe this elusive length scale . </S>"
