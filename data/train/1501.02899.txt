    "the itinerant ferromagnetism is inherently a quantum phenomenon in which the electron correlation is essential .",
    "microscopic origin for the itinerant ferromagnetism has been studied in the framework of the hubbard model.@xcite a conventional mean - field treatment leads to the stoner criterion for the occurrence of band ferromagnetism.@xcite it tells us that the ferromagnetism occurs if the coulomb repulsion and/or the density of states at the fermi level are large enough .",
    "however , such a mean - field treatment overestimates the stability of the ferromagnetism and it is not adequate for the effect of the electron correlation .",
    "in fact , according to the multiple scattering theory,@xcite the coulomb repulsion is revised by a renormalized one in the stoner criterion , which improves the stability condition . on the other hand ,",
    "the occurrence of the ferromagnetism in the hubbard model has been proven rigorously in some limiting conditions.@xcite the nagaoka ferromagnetism is a well - known rigorous result,@xcite indicating that systems have a saturated ferromagnetic ground state when there is one hole added to the half - filling and the coulomb repulsion is infinitely large on appropriate lattices that satisfy the so - called connectivity condition .",
