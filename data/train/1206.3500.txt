    "in his 1946 seminal paper @xcite landau demonstrated that electrostatic plasma waves of vanishing amplitude can be damped , due to their interaction with particles that stream with velocities close to the wave phase speed , @xmath3 .",
    "for unmagnetized uniform plasmas , the wave damping rate is generally proportional to the slope of the equilibrium distribution of particle velocities at @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , for monotonically decreasing equilibrium velocity distribution functions ( such as the usual maxwellian ) plasma waves are damped exponentially in time .",
    "almost twenty years later oneil @xcite analyzed the effects of nonlinearity on the propagation of plasma waves and found that the process of particle trapping in the wave potential well can inhibit landau damping , by flattening the velocity distribution near the wave phase speed .    in 1991 holloway and dorning @xcite noted that certain nonlinear electrostatic oscillations can survive landau damping even when their phase velocities are comparable to the electron thermal speed , @xmath4 , due to the effect of particle trapping .",
    "they called these waves electron acoustic waves ( eaws ) , since in the range of small wavenumbers their dispersion relation is of the form @xmath5 .",
    "an eaw is in fact a bernstein - greene - kruskal ( bgk ) mode @xcite with a velocity distribution function that is effectively flat at the wave phase speed , due to trapping . in 1991 ,",
    "demeio and holloway @xcite performed vlasov - poisson simulations and provided evidence for the analytical results of ref .",
    "also in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors claimed that these undamped plasma oscillations have no linear counterpart , since in their construction the trapped particle distribution vanishes with wave amplitude and approaches a maxwellian , for which the waves are heavily damped .",
    "the latter point was discussed in 1994 by shadwick and morrison @xcite , where it was pointed out that stationary inflection point modes are the natural linear limit of the eaws ( bgk modes ) of ref .",
    "a stationary inflection point mode is an undamped mode with phase speed @xmath3 at a point where the first two derivatives of a stable homogeneous equilibrium velocity distribution function vanish , and by the penrose criterion this is necessary for the simultaneous existence of the mode and stability .",
    "the issue here is that the homogeneous equilibrium distribution function approached as the wave amplitude approaches zero is not unique , and there is no _ a priori _ reason it should be locally maxwellian , since the structure near @xmath6 is determined by the history of formation of the waves . given a nonlinear bgk wave , there are many ways the limit of the vanishing of trapped particles can be taken and the result is clearly norm dependent .",

    "@xcite for a discussion of bifurcations in @xmath7 . )",
    "the existence of the eaw branch has been investigated in many electrostatic particle - in - cell @xcite and vlasov - poisson @xcite simulations .",
    "moreover , recent vlasov - yukawa simulations ( with vlasov ions and linear adiabatic electrons ) led to the prediction of undamped electrostatic waves at low frequencies ( of the order of the proton plasma frequency ) , similar in nature to the eaws and dubbed ion - bulk waves @xcite .",
    "eaw - type fluctuations have been detected in spacecraft data from observations in the interplanetary medium @xcite .",
    "also , the excitation of the eaws has been obtained in laboratory experiments with nonneutral plasmas @xcite , in which an external driving electric field is applied to the plasma column for the time needed to create a population of trapped particles , with the waves surviving after the drive is turned off .",
    "the flat region in the particle velocity distribution generated by trapping at the wave phase speed inhibits landau damping and allows the eaws to survive .",
    "the experimental results discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite confirm the existence of eaws on the nonneutral analog of the so - called thumb curve of ref .",
    "@xcite , as is the case for the numerical results in refs .",
    "@xcite ; however , these experiments also suggest that wave excitation can be obtained off of the usual thumb curve of ref .",
    "@xcite , which we will refer to as off - dispersion eaws .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to shed some light on the nature of these off - dispersion eaws , by examining the sensitivity of the thumb curve to small deviations from the maxwellian used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "however , before starting our analysis , we note that in a separate research thread , motivated by experiments on nonlinear laser plasma interactions @xcite , afeyan and collaborators @xcite carried out extensive vlasov simulations and observed states that they referred to as kinetic electrostatic electron nonlinear ( keen ) waves .",
    "these large amplitude structures also exist off - dispersion ; however , the keen waves observed by these authors are large amplitude , while we focus on relatively low amplitude eaws , where any effect of nonlinearity is limited to a narrow velocity range of trapped particles .",
    "specifically , we investigate both on - dispersion and off - dispersion eaws with a simple linear dispersion analysis .",
    "as noted above , there is no _ a priori _ reason the distribution in the vicinity of @xmath6 should be maxwellian , since the structure near @xmath6 is determined by the history of formation of the waves , and since experimentally fine details of the distribution function are difficult to measure , it is natural to examine the alteration of the thumb curve of ref .",
    "@xcite caused by small deviations from the maxwellian . of main importance here is the alteration caused by replacing the trapped particle region of the velocity distribution by a plateau , but we also consider the alteration caused by altering the tail of the distribution function .    for the plateau distribution function ( see eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) ) the landau velocity integral is carefully evaluated using a high resolution trapezoidal scheme .",
    "we look for roots of the dispersion function in the high frequency range of electron modes , treating the ions as a stationary neutralizing background charge .",
    "consistent with the experiments @xcite the analysis shows that undamped eaws exist in a wide range of the @xmath0 plane , that is , off the thumb curve of @xcite .",
    "from the perspective of the linear dispersion analysis , the existence of the off - dispersion modes is easy to understand .",
    "the landau velocity integral in the dielectric function obtains contributions from velocities that are well away from the plateau ( the non - resonant particle contributions ) and contributions from near the plateau ( the resonant particle contributions ) .",
    "the thumb dispersion curve is determined exclusively by contributions from the non - resonant particles , that is , for @xmath0 on the dispersion curve , the non - resonant contribution alone yields a dielectric function that is zero . off the dispersion curve , the non - resonant contribution yields a dielectric function that is not zero , so the resonant contribution must make up the difference , yielding a total dielectric function that is zero .",
    "thus , for the off - dispersion modes , electrons in the resonant ( or plateau ) region make a significant contribution to the mode charge density . in that sense ,",
    "the off - dispersion modes are like beam modes , for which a significant part of the charge density resides on the beam @xcite . as we will see , for the case of the plateau ( rather than a beam ) , the resonant particle charge density is associated with the two corners of the plateau .",
    "thus , we call these waves _ corner modes_.    as one would expect , the charge density from the corners is a very sensitive function of @xmath6 in the plateau region .",
    "equivalently , the dielectric function has a spiky variation for @xmath6 in the plateau region .",
    "thus , a small change in @xmath6 can make the resonant particle charge density have whatever value is needed to compensate for the non - zero value of the non - resonant dielectric , yielding a total dielectric that is zero",
    ". on - dispersion eaws are special only in that the charge density from the two corners is equal and opposite adding to zero .",
    "this is the case if the phase velocity is equidistant from the two corners , that is , at the velocity mid - point of the plateau .",
    "from this perspective , there is little difference between the on - dispersion and off - dispersion eaws .",
    "however , there is a significant difference between the eaws ( or corner modes ) and weakly damped langmuir waves , where @xmath6 is well out on the tail of the velocity distribution and there is no significant corner contribution to the mode charge density .    another way to obtain off - dispersion waves",
    "is to alter the tail of the distribution function , which may not be known precisely .",
    "although the dispersion curve is not as sensitive to this kind of deviation , one can ascertain systematic shift of roots off of the thumb curve .",
    "in particular , we can show analytically that a fattening of the tail of the distribution shifts roots toward lower @xmath2-values and chopping the tail shifts them toward higher @xmath2-values .",
    "chopping produces perturbed corner charge and this idea leads to a derivation of a rule of thumb for assessing shifts caused by general plateau type of equilibrium distribution functions .    the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we numerically analyze the roots of the electrostatic dielectric function and discuss the wave dispersion relation for a velocity distribution flattened in a small velocity interval .",
    "this is followed by an analysis of the consequences of altering the tail and the derivation of the rule of thumb . in section",
    "iii the numerical results of vlasov - poisson simulations are presented and compared to the analytical predictions of section ii for the plateau distributions .",
    "summary and conclusions are given in section iv .",
    "the propagation of electrostatic waves in a collisionless unmagnetized plasmas can be described by a simplified 1 + 1 + 1 ( one space , one velocity , and one time dimension ) vlasov - poisson system , which is given in dimensionless form as follows :    @xmath8    where @xmath9 is the electron distribution function and @xmath10 the electric field . in ( [ eqvp ] ) ,",

    "dynamically accessible initial conditions are also important because they have a hamiltonian origin and , consequently , preserve phase space constraints . because the perturbed distribution function is obtained by evaluating the known state on particle orbits , the perturbed distribution function must have the same level set topology as the unperturbed and the areas between any level set contours must be preserved . for our simulations , the dynamically accessible initial conditions used amount to evaluating the plateau distribution of eq .",

    "thus , the initial condition for the undriven dynamics that begins at @xmath133 is a symplectic rearrangement of @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "we performed @xmath134 simulations for various values of the plateau velocity position @xmath45 of @xmath42 and the wavenumber @xmath2 , in order to numerically investigate the predictions of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] . for each simulation we chose @xmath135 , where @xmath136 is the wave period ( that is the plasma is driven for 20 wave periods ) and @xmath137 .",
    "typically the maximum time for the simulations is @xmath138 , but when needed the system evolution is followed up to @xmath139 .",
    "the driver amplitude is set for each simulation by adjusting the driver trapping time @xmath140 to be larger than @xmath141 .",
    "in particular , we set @xmath142 , so that trapping does not play a large role in the system evolution , i.e.  the distribution function changes little during the simulation .",

    "as is evident from the plots , in run a we observe damped ( more or less exponentially ) oscillations after the driver has been turned off , consistent with landau damping , while in run b we observe a stable electric response , consistent with plateau suppression .",
    "figure [ fig7 ] is a semi - log plot of the spectral electrostatic energy , obtained by the fourier analysis of @xmath126 for @xmath145 , as a function of @xmath3 , for the case of run b , where a stable plasma response is recovered at @xmath146 .",
    "this plot reveals that the electric field propagates with a phase velocity @xmath3 near the driver phase velocity @xmath147 ( red - vertical line ) .",
    "moreover , for run b we evaluated the electron charge density @xmath148 at the end of the simulation .",

    "[ dispersion ] as a threshold to divide our 64 simulations into two classes : class @xmath159 for which @xmath160 and class @xmath161 for which @xmath162 .",
    "these results are summarized in the @xmath71 scatter plot of fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] , where the simulations of class @xmath159 are indicated by black squares , while those of class @xmath161 by red diamonds . in this figure",

    "[ fig4 ] , where almost undamped roots of the dielectric function have been recovered .",
    "figure [ fig8 ] clearly shows that the black squares fall within the black - solid line , while the red diamonds lie outside this line ; thus , results of the analysis of fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] are well corroborated by the simulations .",
    "the simulations of runs run a , run b , and run c are indicated by capital letters in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] . runs a fall outside the black - solid lines , runs b fall inside the dark region with black solid - line boundaries , and runs c are exactly on the thumb curve indicated by the red - dashed line .",
    "in the present work , roots of the electrostatic dielectric function were analyzed when a velocity plateau of small but nonvanishing width is present in the equilibrium velocity distribution of electrons .",
    "the numerical solution of the landau integral , performed through a high resolution scheme , allowed us to show that quasi - undamped plasma oscillations can be obtained off of the thumb curve of ref .",
    "@xcite . by solving",
    "numerically the landau integral , we noted that the presence of the velocity plateau , even of very small width , can highly affect the real part of the dielectric function , producing marked spikes within the velocity interval around the plateau . in a wide region of the @xmath28 plane ,",
    "almost undamped roots of the dielectric function were obtained .",
    "examination of the perturbed electron distribution function revealed that most of the charge density associated with the off - dispersion oscillations comes from the sharp corners at the boundaries of the velocity plateau , and for this reason we called these new modes corner modes .",
    "a rule of thumb was derived by assuming infinitely sharp corners , a rule useful for gauging how a plateau shifts roots off of the thumb curve .",
    "next , these analytical predictions were compared with the results of eulerian vlasov - poisson simulations with high resolution in velocity space .",
    "our simulations were initiated by applying a wave - like external electric field to drive the plateau distribution of eq .",
    "( [ fp ] ) off of equilibrium .",
    "the external electric field was turned on and off adiabatically in such a way to avoid the excitation of usual langmuir waves .",
    "also , the amplitude of the external driver was chosen to be very small so trapping effects were minimized . as discussed in sec .  [ simulations ] , the numerical results of these nonlinear simulations corroborated the linear results of sec .  [ dispersion ] .",
    "although we spoke of off - dispersion results , it is important to note that all of the roots obtained in sec .",
    "[ dispersion ] are actual linear electrostatic plasma oscillations : while lan waves are approximate time asymptotic states as shown by landau ; eaws , corner modes , stationary inflection point modes , etc .",
    "are all exact linear plasma oscillations for specific homogeneous equilibrium distribution functions .",
    "in essence , what we are really attempting is to find a homogeneous equilibrium distribution function that best describes a weakly nonlinear theory .",
    "because plasmas can exist in states away from thermodynamic equilibrium for substantial lengths of time , there is no _ a priori _ reason to believe the distribution function is maxwellian , particularly if wave - like disturbances are excited .",
    "because of the sensitivity of the dispersion relation to equilibrium distribution functions , in the tail but particularly near @xmath3 , we conclude that the thumb curve of ref .",
    "@xcite is of limited predictive capability .    since the original bgk paper @xcite",
    ", it has been understood that there is nonuniqueness in the construction of these nonlinear modes : a given electric field can be consistent with a large class of distribution functions .",
    "it is difficult to pin down the shape of the distribution function for the trapped particle population , because the formation of this distribution depends on the time history .",
    "this is true both in experiments and simulations , whether the bgk modes evolve out of instability or arise by driving the plasma as we have done here . in the case of small amplitude disturbances",
    ", we make the point that this arbitrariness is the same as that in choosing the appropriate shape of @xmath163 near @xmath3 .",
    "for very small disturbances , the stationary inflection point modes of @xcite are natural candidates . for larger disturbances ,",
    "the off - dispersion modes of this paper appear to be an attractive alternative .",
    "thus , the present work bears on the interpretation of recent results of nonneutral plasma experiments that provide evidence for undamped off - dispersion modes . in the experiments of @xcite , any plateau - like structures in the electron velocity distribution are created dynamically by means of an external driver electric field that traps resonant particles .",
    "after the driving process , the plasma is strongly inhomogeneous , with the formation of humps and depressions in the particle distribution function , produced by the nonlinear dynamics triggered by the external field .",
    "thus , one would think that a linear analysis might not be relevant ; however , by designing a plateau and tail for a distribution function that has modes that match the experiment , it appears that one can obtain a linear theory consistent with some of the experimental results , and possibly even infer information about the trapped particles .",
    "in fact , we note that the rule of thumb explains the frequency shifts observed in the experiments of @xcite , but continuing with this line of investigation is beyond the scope of the present paper , so we conclude here .",
