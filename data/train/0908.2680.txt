    "<S> based on the updated urqmd transport model , the effect of the symmetry potential energy on the two - nucleon hbt correlation is investigated with the help of the coalescence program for constructing clusters , and the crab analyzing program of the two - particle hbt correlation . </S>",
    "<S> an obvious non - linear dependence of the neutron - proton ( or neutron - neutron ) hbt correlation function ( @xmath0 ) at small relative momenta on the stiffness factor @xmath1 of the symmetry potential energy is found : when @xmath2 , the @xmath0 increases rapidly with increasing @xmath1 , while it starts to saturate if @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> it is also found that both the symmetry potential energy at low densities and the conditions of constructing clusters at the late stage of the whole process influence the two - nucleon hbt correlation with the same power .    </S>",
    "<S> keywords : density dependence of the symmetry energy , sensitive observables , hbt correlation    in recent years , the isospin dependent equation of state ( eos ) of both infinite and finite nuclear matter has been investigated in both deeper and broader range . theoretically , a large amount of probes have been brought out to be sensitively affected by the isovector part of the eos , i.e. , the symmetry energy term . based on different theories </S>",
    "<S> , the symmetry energy has been parametrized in different ways ( please see @xcite for details ) . among these parametrizations , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath4 is often used ( @xmath5 being the symmetry energy at the normal density , and @xmath6 the reduced density , while @xmath1 is the stiffness factor of the density dependence of the symmetry energy ) . especially , the density dependence of the symmetry potential energy is paid much more attention since the uncertainty of the symmetry energy mainly comes from this term . </S>",
    "<S> recently , with some comparisons between the results of experimental data and dynamical model ibuu , the uncertainty in the density dependence of the symmetry energy at subnormal densities is reduced into the range of @xmath7 , depending on the probable medium modifications of the nucleon transport @xcite . nevertheless , recently a quite soft symmetry energy ( the corresponding @xmath1 factor is only about @xmath8 ) was implied experimentally at very low nuclear densities ( @xmath9 is @xmath10 times normal density ) @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> furthermore , in the most recent analyses by tsang s group @xcite , although they found that several different observables can provide consistent constraints on the density dependence of the symmetry energy , the constraints are still relatively loose . to bring forward more sensitive probes for symmetry energy at subnormal densities is still urgent and prerequisite . however , we think that one should firstly check more carefully the difficulties of detecting the existing observables for forthcoming experiments . therefore , the currently crucial question becomes : can the sensitive observable suggested by theoretical physicists be _ experimentally _ taken as a sensitive candidate for detecting the symmetry energy at subnormal densities ? in the previous work @xcite this question has been concerned for the free neutron / proton ( @xmath11 ) ratio as well as the @xmath12 ratio .    in this paper , we would like to continue this topic to further check the two - nucleon correlation , which is based on the hanbury - brown - twiss interferometry ( hbt ) @xcite technique . </S>",
    "<S> it was pointed out that it is a good candidate to probe the symmetry energy since it is quite unsensitive to the iso - scalar part of eos as well as the in - medium nn cross section @xcite . in their initiated investigations , </S>",
    "<S> the isospin effect is found to occur only in the late stage of the heavy ion collisions ( hics ) where the nuclear medium becomes dilute . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the two - nucleon correlation has the advantage in probing the density dependence of the symmetry potential at low densities . </S>",
    "<S> it was further claimed that the sensitivity of the correlation function of the nucleon pair to the density dependence of the symmetry energy is reduced after considering a ( isospin - dependent ) momentum dependent nuclear potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , in their studies , only several parameter sets of the stiffness of the symmetry energy were employed . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed to be enough in the studies of the density dependent symmetry energy by adopting the conventional single - particle observables since they behave monotonously with the increase of the stiffness factor @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> but , is that still true in the symmetry - energy dependence of the two - nucleon hbt correlation ? </S>",
    "<S> here we would like to vary the @xmath1 factor with a larger range to see the variance of the correlation function .    </S>",
    "<S> besides the symmetry potential energy , the freeze - out conditions of clusters should also heavily influence the final two - nucleon correlation function . in the transport model calculations , when the transport is stopped at a certain time , such as @xmath13 @xmath14 or so , one cluster constructing program is then used . generally speaking , two methods ( i.e. , buu - like and qmd - like ) for constructing clusters exist in the transport model calculations @xcite . in our urqmd calculations below , the coalescence model , which is often used for analyzing qmd - like model outputs , </S>",
    "<S> is employed , in which the nucleons with relative momenta smaller than @xmath15 and relative distances smaller than @xmath16 are considered to belong to one cluster . </S>",
    "<S> it is comparable to the buu - like coordinate density cut @xmath17 when we only adopt the relative distance @xmath16 but not the relative momentum @xmath15 in the qmd - like analysis . </S>",
    "<S> the freeze - out condition certainly influences the two - nucleon correlation function since it reflects the spatial ( and momentum ) separation of two nucleons . </S>",
    "<S> it is also interesting to see if the small uncertainty in the multiplicity of the observed particle changes the hbt correlation function accordingly .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we use the recently updated urqmd transport model @xcite for studies of intermediate energy hics to investigate the effects of the density dependent symmetry potential energy and the freeze - out conditions on the neutron - proton and the neutron - neutron hbt correlations . </S>",
    "<S> the proton - proton correlation will not be shown in this paper since it has similar isospin - dependent effect to the neutron - proton and neutron - neutron ones , although the largest effect is shown at the relative momentum of pair @xmath18 mev@xmath19 but not at @xmath20 mev@xmath19 . as a default , @xmath15 and @xmath16 used in the coalescence model </S>",
    "<S> are set to be @xmath8 gev@xmath19 and @xmath21 fm , respectively ( except otherwise stated ) . </S>",
    "<S> the central collisions ( @xmath22 of total cross section @xmath23 ) of neutron - rich intermediate - mass and heavy systems @xmath24ca@xmath25ca and @xmath26au@xmath27au are adopted in the urqmd calculations . as stated above </S>",
    "<S> , the correlation function of the nucleon pair from hics with the super - intermediate - mass system at the intermediate energy is claimed to be unsensitive to the isospin - scalar part of eos and the nn cross section @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is also reported that by using the imaging method the shape of the source of the two - proton pairs from the hics with medium sized system at beam energies around @xmath28a mev is sensitive to the medium modification of the nn cross section @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , the corresponding hbt correlation function is seen to be less and less affected by the medium modification with the increase of the beam energy . in this work </S>",
    "<S> , we focus our investigation on the correlation functions at beam energies @xmath28a @xmath29a mev . and </S>",
    "<S> , we randomly adopt several parameter sets of eos used in previous works @xcite , for checking . </S>",
    "<S> those are , s - eos , sm - eos , and hm - eos , without considering the medium modifications on nn cross sections .    to analyze the two - nucleon hbt interferometry , the correlation after burner ( crab v3.0@xmath30 ) program is employed @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the correlation function is expressed as @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the inclusive two - particle emission probability in the same event , @xmath33 is the product of two single - particle emission probability in different events . </S>",
    "<S> the squared relative two - particle wave function @xmath34 serves as a weight , while @xmath35 is the probability for emitting a particle with momentum @xmath36 from the space - time point @xmath37 . </S>",

    "<S> are adopted for @xmath24ca@xmath25ca central collisions ( @xmath22 of total cross section @xmath23 ) at @xmath43a mev . </S>",
    "<S> the marked area illustrates the value @xmath44 . </S>",
    "<S> the open squares in the top plot show the @xmath45 values when the symmetry potential energy is switched off at the reduced densities @xmath46.,scaledwidth=60.0% ]    figure  [ fig1 ] shows the neutron - proton correlation function ( @xmath45 ) within the relative momentum bin @xmath40 mev@xmath19 and the rapidity region @xmath41 ( @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the energy and longitudinal momentum of the nucleon in the center - of - mass system ) ( top plot ) , and the free @xmath11 ratio in the rapidity region @xmath42 ( bottom plot ) as a function of the stiffness factor @xmath1 of the symmetry potential energy . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath24ca@xmath25ca central collisions ( @xmath22 of total cross section @xmath23 ) at @xmath43a mev are adopted . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the @xmath11 ratio of free nucleons is obviously rapidity dependent . but </S>",
    "<S> conclusions of the two - nucleon hbt correlation drawn in this paper is not changed by the small rapidity - cut difference used in both observables @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the s - eos and the sm - eos are selected for comparison in each plot . </S>",
    "<S> it is seen that the iso - scalar part of the eos only affects slightly the sensitivity of both the @xmath45 and the @xmath11 ratio to the stiffness of the symmetry potential energy . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in the following calculations , we will randomly use various eos . </S>",
    "<S> it is also known that the @xmath11 value decreases monotonously with increasing @xmath1 factor , which is again shown in the bottom plot of this figure . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to see that , however , the @xmath45 moves up rapidly with increasing @xmath1 when @xmath1 is less than @xmath50 , and then saturates with the further increase of the @xmath1 value , the saturation value is @xmath44 , which is shown in a marked area . </S>",
    "<S> it is known that the symmetry potential plays obvious role on the two - nucleon hbt correlation at the late stage ( @xmath51 @xmath14 ) of the whole process @xcite , where the density surrounding the emitted protons is very small . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we further calculate the @xmath45 with @xmath52 and @xmath53 ( open squares ) but without considering the symmetry potential energy at very low densities ( the reduced density @xmath54 ) . it is obvious that the @xmath45 values move back to the marked area . we know that the stiffer the symmetry energy is , the smaller the value of the symmetry energy at subnormal density becomes . at densities </S>",
    "<S> @xmath46 the stiff symmetry energy is too weak to influence the two - particle correlation , while it plays strong role with a very soft symmetry energy @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is concluded that , firstly , the correlation function can hardly distinguish the stiffness of the symmetry energy when @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> secondly , the soft symmetry energy plays more obvious role on the neutron - proton correlation function at the late stage . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , the neutron - proton correlation function is suitable to explore the symmetry energy in the dilute nuclear medium , especially for a very soft symmetry - energy assumption .    at beam energy around @xmath28a mev </S>",
    "<S> , it is found that the isospin effect on the correlation function is reduced in heavy - system hics such as sn+sn . </S>",
    "<S> it is also confirmed in our calculations with the au+au reaction which is shown in the upper - left plot of figure[fig2 ] , even when a different stop time @xmath56 @xmath14 is chosen . </S>",
    "<S> further , we calculate the @xmath45 values at higher beam energies , i.e. , at @xmath57a , @xmath58a , @xmath59a , @xmath60a , and @xmath61a mev , which are shown in other plots of figure  [ fig2 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to see that with the increase of the beam energy , the effect of the density dependence of symmetry energy becomes visible </S>",
    "<S> . it might be understandable when considering the fact that with the increase of beam energy , more unstable light fragments emit and decay with a longer time and in the dilute medium so as to be influenced by the soft symmetry energy at the late stage .    a , @xmath62a , @xmath58a , @xmath59a , @xmath60a , and @xmath61a mev . </S>",

    "<S> the strong non - linear dependence of the neutron - neutron correlation function on the @xmath1 factor of the symmetry potential energy is due to the long time evolution of the neutron - rich unstable light fragments at the late stage .     </S>",
