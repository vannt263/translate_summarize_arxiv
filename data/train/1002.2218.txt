    "feedback and heating from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) is considered a prime candidate for solving the `` cooling flow '' problem @xcite in the hot gas of galaxy clusters @xcite , groups , and giant elliptical galaxies @xcite , although the details of this process are not yet fully understood .",
    "recent observations using _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ have produced a large increase in the detection of x - ray surface brightness depressions ( `` cavities '' or `` bubbles '' ) in many of these systems , interpreted as buoyantly rising bubbles created by agn outbursts .",
    "studies of such cavities in individual clusters , including hydra  a @xcite , perseus @xcite , a2052 @xcite , a2199 @xcite , and centaurus @xcite , indicate that the outburst energy required to inflate these cavities would be sufficient to balance cooling @xcite , explain the lack of gas cooling below @xmath2  kev in cluster cores @xcite , and reproduce the bright end of the galaxy luminosity function @xcite .",
    "detailed studies of larger samples of x - ray bright elliptical galaxies and their surrounding cavities has further elucidated the possible role of agn feedback for the thermal and morphological properties of the hot gas in these systems . @xcite",
    "combined observed cavity properties and central radio powers of the systems in the @xcite sample with the inferred fraction of radio - loud ellipticals in the sloan digital sky survey , to show that the time - averaged heating rate by radio agn in massive ellipticals can generally balance the cooling rate of the hot gas surrounding these galaxies . using a sample of x - ray luminous ellipticals with identified cavities , @xcite estimated agn jet powers from cavity properties and showed that these correlate tightly with the anticipated bondi accretion rate of the central supermassive black hole .",
    "evidence that radio agn may be able to affect their gaseous surroundings also in lower - mass ellipticals has been provided by @xcite , who demonstrated that the amount of asymmetry in the hot gas morphology of ellipticals correlates with the central radio agn luminosity , even down to the lowest detectable radio powers in relatively x - ray faint galaxies .",
    "these results all point to a close connection between central agn radio outbursts and the creation of x - ray cavities in the surrounding gas . in terms of establishing the incidence and nature of such cavities , most work so far has focused on studying cavity properties and agn interactions with the intracluster medium ( icm ) within galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "results suggest that roughly 2/3 of x - ray bright cool - core clusters harbor detectable cavities @xcite , and that these cavities appear to obey tight scaling relations between their size and projected clustercentric distance , offering a means of testing their nature and that of the inflating mechanism @xcite",
    ". comparable work on giant elliptical galaxies that do not represent central brightest cluster galaxies is so far limited @xcite , but indicates a significantly smaller detectable cavity fraction of @xmath3 @xcite .",
    "however , studies of agn heating and x - ray cavities within large samples of galaxy groups have largely been absent .",
    "although agn outbursts in groups are assumed to be smaller in scale and less energetic than those in clusters , they may play a more prominent role in the evolution of the host structure due to the shallower gravitational potential of groups .",
    "estimating the incidence and properties of x - ray cavities in groups is therefore an important step toward understanding the role played by agn outbursts for the evolution of baryons on group scales .",
    "in many x - ray bright clusters with high - quality data , x - ray cavities are prominent and can be easily identified as x - ray surface brightness depressions using visual inspection .",
    "this can be augmented by radio data revealing ongoing agn activity within the central cluster galaxy , or the presence of radio lobes coincident with the cavities . in this process",
    ", a number of factors could affect the detectability of x - ray cavities however , including the position , orientation , and angular extent of the cavities @xcite , along with observational details such as the sensitivity of the data .",
    "these issues are even more important in the group regime , where the lower intrinsic x - ray luminosities can further impede cavity identification . to search for x - ray cavities in groups ,",
    "it is therefore important to consider additional methods that can aid simple visual inspection in identifying these structures .    in the present work",
    ", we select a sample of 51 galaxy groups from the _ chandra _ archive , in order to systematically search for and characterize the presence of x - ray cavities in a large sample of galaxy groups .",
    "in addition to visual inspection of the raw x - ray data , we facilitate the detection process by employing two methods to first characterize the large - scale group emission , _ viz . _  unsharp masking and modeling of the surface brightness distribution . a good handful of the groups in our sample have been previously reported to harbor detectable cavities . here",
    "we find that at least 13 of the groups , and potentially as much as half of our group sample ( 26/51 ) , show evidence of x - ray cavities .",
    "we quantify the size , groupcentric distance , and relationship with the central agn radio luminosity for all these structures , in addition to offering some considerations as to the preferred method for identifying cavities in these relatively x - ray faint systems .",
    "the structure of this paper is as follows . in section  [ sec : sample ]",
    "we present the group sample and outline the data reduction process .",
    "our approach to searching for cavities and establishing their properties are described in detail in section  [ sec : analysis ] .",
    "section  [ sec : result ] presents the results of our _ chandra _ analysis . to understand the efficiency of the two methods employed for cavity detection",
    ", we generated a set of mock data sets , the analysis of which is described in section  [ sec : mock ] .",
    "this is followed by a discussion of our results in section  [ sec : discuss ] and conclusions in section  [ sec : conclude ] .",
    "the cosmological parameters assumed in this paper are @xmath4  km  s@xmath5  mpc@xmath5 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , all uncertainties are quoted at the 68% confidence level .",
    "the groups in this study were selected from the _ chandra _ archival samples of @xcite ( 43 groups ) and @xcite ( an additional 9 groups ) . to suppress the potential impact of instrumental artifacts on our results ,",
    "only groups for which the central bright regions are covered by a single acis ccd were considered .",
    "this excluded one group ( a160 ) from the sample .",
    "our final sample is listed in table  [ table : sample ] and includes 51 groups , ranging in distance from @xmath8 20550  mpc .",
    "a few of the groups have been covered by multiple _",
    "chandra _ observations . in those cases",
    ", we generally used the longest observation unless this had a large offset between the group center and the ccd aimpoint .",
    "we stress that the sample does not contain individual giant elliptical galaxies , nor any galaxy clusters , and that the two studies from which our sample is drawn were not themselves designed for cavity studies . hence , while the selection criteria employed in those two studies favor fairly undisturbed x - ray bright systems , the sample should not be inherently biased toward systems with prominent cavities .",
    "standard data reduction and calibration was performed to all data sets starting from level one event files .",
    "chandra interactive analysis of observations software ( ciao ) v.4.1.1 and chandra calibration database ( caldb ) 4.1.1 were used in this work .",
    "new level one event files were created with the `` acis@xmath9process@xmath9events '' task in ciao , including charge transfer inefficiency correction , time - dependent gain adjustment , and screening for bad pixels using the bad pixel map provided by the pipeline . for observations taken in very faint mode ,",
    "additional background screening was performed .",
    "grade / status filters were applied ( excluding _ asca _ grades 1 , 5 , and 7 ) along with good time intervals filters to produce level  two event files .",
    "times of high background were eliminated based on lightcurves extracted in regions away from the extended source center .",
    "images were then produced in the 0.32  kev band , chosen to optimize the signal - to - noise ratio at the typical group temperatures of our sample , using spatial bins of 1 or 2 pixels depending on source extent and data quality .",
    "exposure maps were produced assuming a monoenergetic distribution of source photons at the peak flux energy ( usually around 1  kev ) .",
    "the source image was normalized by the exposure map , correcting for the effect of strongly variable exposure near the detector edges .",
    "we adopt a threshold of @xmath10 of the maximum value of the exposure map , setting all pixels with exposure below this value equal to zero .",
    "to search for small - scale x - ray structure and identify potential cavities , we employ two methods : modeling the surface brightness distribution of the groups using a two - dimensional ( elliptical ) @xmath0model and performing an unsharp masking procedure .      with this method , we first aim to characterize the large - scale group emission by means of an elliptical @xmath0model @xcite .",
    "we use the sherpa package in ciao to fit this model along with a uniform background to the exposure - corrected 0.32  kev images of all groups .",
    "bright point sources were identified visually and masked out in all fitting , and only data from the central ccd were considered .",
    "free parameters of the model are @xmath0 , @xmath11 , ellipticity , position angle , and the normalization , in addition to the local background level .    for each group ,",
    "the best - fit model was subtracted from the input image to produce a residual image . for a good fit , the residual image will be flat almost everywhere ( modulo poisson fluctuations ) , with any remaining structure revealing departures from the model , such as cavities .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ fit ] shows an example of this , displaying the results for ngc5044 , the group with the largest number of source counts and the most prominent cavities within our sample . in this case , the two cavities are already visible in the original image but become much more prominent in the residual image .",
    "the middle panel of figure  [ fit ] shows the case of ngc3402 , in which cavities are not clearly detected . here",
    "the fitted model describes the group emission very well , and residual structure  can be largely ascribed to poisson fluctuations .",
    "finally , images with low signal - to - noise ratio tend to have no cavities detected , as illustrated in the bottom panel of figure  [ fit ] . in this case , the relatively low number of counts precludes any robust conclusion regarding the presence of cavities .    for some groups",
    "the model fitting fails to converge on sensible parameters , returning , e.g. , a best - fit core radius smaller than one pixel or a model eccentricity higher than 0.99 . the relevant systems are 3c442a , a1139 , a1238 , a1692 , a1992 , a2092 , a2462 , ngc507 , rbs461 , rxj1206 - 0744 , and ugc842 . we ascribe the failure of the fitting approach mainly to the fact that many of these data sets have relatively low signal - to - noise ratio , coupled with the possibility that some of those groups are simply not well described by an elliptical @xmath0model .",
    "we will return to these issues in section  [ sec : mock ] .      another way to smooth the large - scale group emission and test for structure on smaller scales",
    "is unsharp masking .",
    "this approach has been successfully employed to uncover faint features at fine spatial detail in deep cluster x - ray data ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "here we perform this procedure by smoothing the exposure - corrected images using the `` aconvolve '' task in ciao . for each group , the data are first smoothed using a wide gaussian kernel that preserves the overall morphology of the emission but erases small - scale structure .",
    "a separate smoothing is performed on smaller scales to suppress ( partly noise  induced ) pixel - to - pixel variations while preserving structure on the likely scale of any cavities in the data .",
    "the latter image is then divided by the former , with the resulting quotient image acting as an analog of the residual image from the model fitting approach . in principle , optimal choices for the characteristic smoothing scales vary among the groups . in practice , however , we found that large and small scales of 1030 and 25  pixels , respectively , generally produced the most visually compelling results , with the smaller values generally preferred for more distant and compact systems .",
    "figure  [ smooth ] illustrates this method applied to ngc5044 .",
    "the figure shows the original image , the image smoothed by narrow and wide gaussians of @xmath12 and 30  pixels , respectively , and the result of dividing the former by the latter .",
    "the result can be directly compared to the residual image from model fitting shown in the top row in figure  [ fit ] .    to illustrate the impact of different choices for the small smoothing scale , figure  [ smooth_scales ] shows the quotient image for ngc5044 with six different small scales employed along with a fixed large - scale kernel of @xmath13  pixels .",
    "all the quotient images clearly reveal x - ray depressions at the positions of the cavities , but it is easier to visually recognize the cavities as such in the images produced with relatively narrow small - scale kernels : the cavities in these images are more obvious and have a higher contrast with their surroundings . on the other hand , when the small scale becomes larger than 8  pixels ( i.e.  @xmath14 of the larger scale ) , distinguishing the cavities from other brightness depressions becomes more difficult as the sharp contrast between the cavities and their immediate surroundings is lost .",
    "however , we emphasize that ngc5044 is by far the highest - flux system in our sample , and that the choice of small smoothing scale is less straightforward for significantly fainter systems . as such , a major drawback of this method compared with surface brightness modeling is the need to make appropriate choices for the smoothing scales .",
    "based on the images described in sections  [ sec : fitting ] and [ sec : masking ] , visual inspection for x - ray cavities was performed for all groups .",
    "cavities were mainly identified in the residual images from model fitting , but the appearance of the unsmoothed exposure - corrected images was also taken into consideration . in most cases",
    "the impression gained from these two images agree . in the cases for which the fitting approach did not converge on reasonable model values ( typically for sources of low signal - to - noise ratio )",
    ", cavities were identified visually based on the raw images , aided by the quotient images from unsharp masking . for the groups",
    "judged to show evidence of cavities , differences in signal - to - noise ratio and in the contrast between the cavities and their surroundings led us to further subdivide the sample , leading to the following classification scheme :    _ groups with certain cavities _ ( denoted the `` c''sample in the following ) : cavities are clearly detected upon visual inspection of the residual images , and their presence is at least indicative in the raw and unsharp masked images as well .",
    "these cavities always present a high contrast with their surroundings , including the presence of a bright rim .    _",
    "groups with possible cavities _ ( `` p''sample ) , fulfilling one of two conditions : ( 1 ) cavities are apparent in only one of the residual and raw images .",
    "( 2 ) both the residual image and the raw image show a hint , if not conclusive , of the presence of cavities .",
    "cavities in this category always have a low contrast with their surroundings .    _ groups with no cavities _",
    "( `` n''sample ) : neither raw nor residual images show any visually obvious evidence of cavities .",
    "this category also includes cases in which the surface brightness depression in the residual image forms a ring around the group center .",
    "this is likely an artifact of the fitting procedure , owing to the presence of a strong central and extended excess above the best - fit @xmath0model .",
    "we emphasize that cavity detection was done solely on the basis of x - ray data , and that the presence or morphology of central radio emission in a group was not considered for this purpose .",
    "furthermore , as indicated by comparison with other existing studies ( see section  [ sec : result ] ) , we have likely been conservative in our classification .",
    "it is , therefore , conceivable that groups in the p  sample may generally have a high probability of containing cavities .",
    "in addition to identifying cavities we also provide quantitative estimates of their properties . in each case , the cavity center was first defined as the centroid of the x - ray surface brightness depression . in a few cases where the deepest depression point of the cavity in the residual image from model fitting differed significantly from the apparent geometrical center",
    ", we considered the cavity center to be the midpoint between the two locations .",
    "the location of cavity boundaries were identified as sharp drops in x - ray surface brightness , equivalent to where the pixel counts in the residual images become negative . on this basis",
    ", the cavities can be generally viewed as ellipses , with a major axis @xmath15 in the tangential direction ( perpendicular to the line joining the cavity with the group center ) and a minor axis @xmath16 in the radial direction .",
    "the cavity distance @xmath17 was defined as the distance between the cavity center and the group center , with the latter defined as the location of the central peak of the extended x - ray emission .",
    "since the accuracy of these somewhat subjective measurements generally depends in an unquantifiable manner on factors such as the signal - to - noise ratio of the data , we do not provide uncertainties on these results , and we stress that they should all be considered approximate .",
    "we do note , however , that the inferred properties of the cavities in the p - sample are generally more uncertain than those of the c sample .",
    "+   +   +   +   +   +      +   +   +   +   +   +      +   +   +   +   +   +   +   +",
    "based on the above criteria , 26 out of the 51 groups in our sample were identified as harboring certain or possible x - ray cavities .",
    "these systems are evenly split among the c and p  samples . in figure  [ certain_cavity ]",
    "we show the input image , the residual image from model fitting , and the quotient image from unsharp masking for all groups in the c  sample .",
    "figure  [ possible_cavity ] shows the corresponding results for the p  sample . for further comparison",
    ", we also show the images for the n sample in figure  [ no_cavity ] .    among the 26 groups in the combined c and p  samples , about half ( 8 in the c sample and 6 in the p sample ) show evidence of containing two cavities , and these are always at symmetric positions relative to the group center .",
    "we did not identify any groups showing evidence for more than two cavities as otherwise reported for a number of galaxy clusters ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "at least nine groups in our sample have been identified in previous work as hosting cavities : ic1262 @xcite , a262 @xcite , hcg62 @xcite , ngc507 @xcite , ngc5846 @xcite , ngc741 @xcite , ngc4325 @xcite , ngc5044 @xcite , and ngc5098 @xcite .",
    "eight of these were classified as belonging to the c or p  sample in our analysis .",
    "the only exception is ngc4325 , which shows weak hints of the presence of cavities but without satisfying our criteria for inclusion in the p  sample .",
    "the identification of cavities in this system by @xcite was based on a detailed bayesian model - fitting approach which clearly exceeds the level of sophistication employed in our analysis .",
    "furthermore , two of the above nine groups ( ngc507 and ngc741 ) were here classified as belonging to the p rather than c  sample .",
    "these comparisons confirm our suspicion that we have been fairly conservative in our classification .",
    "this might be anticipated given that we are not incorporating , e.g. , radio data to aid in cavity identification .",
    "we list the @xmath0model fit results and cavity measurements ( where applicable ) for all the groups in table  [ table : cavity ] , along with the total number of exposure - corrected 0.32  kev photons from diffuse emission within the model fitting region considered for each group ( typically the central @xmath18 ) . in agreement with many previous studies ( e.g. , @xcite )",
    ", we note that the mean @xmath0value derived for the sample is @xmath19 , considerably lower than the typical value of @xmath20 seen in clusters @xcite .",
    "we also tested for a relationship between @xmath0 and core radius @xmath11 for all three subsamples of groups , as illustrated in figure  [ beta_rc ] .",
    "no clear correlation between these two parameters is evident , neither for the individual subsamples nor for all groups combined .",
    "in addition , mean values of the two parameters do not show any clear variation among the subsamples , being ( @xmath21  kpc , @xmath22 ) for the c  sample , ( @xmath23  kpc , @xmath24 ) for the p ",
    "sample , and ( @xmath25 kpc , @xmath26 ) for the n  sample .    from the results in table  [ table : cavity ]",
    ", we can explore any correlations among the sizes and groupcentric distances of the identified cavities .",
    "figure  [ size_distance](a ) shows the relationship between the cavity size in the tangential direction @xmath15 and radial direction @xmath16 for the c and p  samples .",
    "remarkably , these two quantities appear strongly coupled , despite the potentially considerable systematic uncertainties associated with their estimation .",
    "motivated by the appearance of the data in figure  [ size_distance ] , we fitted linear relations to the data in log  log space to quantify the observed cavity behavior .",
    "for this , we used the orthogonal regression approach of @xcite , since there are ( unquantifiable ) errors on both parameters , but we note that results are consistent with those obtained using various ordinary least squares methods ( e.g. , @xmath27 vs.  @xmath28 , @xmath28 vs.  @xmath27 , bisector ) .",
    "for the data in figure  [ size_distance](a ) , we then find @xmath29 for @xmath15 and @xmath16 in kpc and with a high correlation coefficient of 0.95 .",
    "this shows that cavities maintain broadly similar shapes , with a mean ratio of @xmath30 that is roughly constant for all cavity sizes .",
    "cavity sizes are also strongly correlated with their projected distance @xmath17 from the group center .",
    "figure  [ size_distance](b ) and ( c ) show @xmath15 and @xmath16 as functions of @xmath17 ( also in kpc ) , with best - fit linear relationships of @xmath31 for a correlation coefficient @xmath32 , and @xmath33 for a coefficient @xmath34 . as illustrated by the dotted line in figure  [ size_distance](b ) , equation  ( [ eq : ad ] )",
    "implies that cavities are enclosed by a cone of roughly constant opening angle @xmath35 @xmath36 as they rise and expand within the surrounding medium .    in figure  [ size_distance ] ,",
    "the fits of equations  ( [ eq : ab])([eq : bd ] ) are represented by solid lines .",
    "for comparison , we also show by dashed lines our corresponding fits to the results for the cluster sample of brzan et  al.(2004 ; their table 3 ) , namely @xmath37 in addition , figure  [ size_distance](b ) further shows the relation between @xmath15 and @xmath17 found by @xcite for an even larger cluster sample . despite the somewhat subjective way cavity sizes are estimated by different authors",
    ", there is generally remarkable agreement between these three studies and hence between results for our groups and more massive clusters . in particular , the slopes of equations  ( [ eq : ab])([eq : bd ] ) , along with two out of three intercepts , are statistically consistent at the 1-@xmath38 level with the results of @xcite .",
    "we next tested for a correlation between the 1.4  ghz radio luminosity @xmath39 of the central brightest group galaxy ( i.e. , that of any central radio source associated with the galaxy itself rather than that of any radio lobes coinciding with the x - ray cavities ) and the detection of cavities . values of @xmath39 were extracted from the nrao vla sky survey ( nvss ) , and are listed in table  [ table : cavity ] .",
    "if data were missing at 1.4  ghz but available at a nearby frequency , we extrapolated to 1.4  ghz assuming a power - law spectrum of index unity , @xmath40 . for groups with nvss coverage but with no radio flux listed in ned , we used the 99@xmath41 completeness flux limit in the nvss survey ( 3.4  mjy ; @xcite ) to estimate an upper limit to @xmath42 .",
    "finally , if a source was not covered in nvss or if the 1.4  ghz emission could not be unambiguously associated with the central group galaxy in nvss or first @xcite data , we left @xmath39 as undetermined .",
    "figure  [ radio_stat ] shows the resulting distribution of @xmath43 for the different group subsamples . for groups with upper limits to @xmath39",
    ", we have assumed this upper limit when displaying these results , but we note that the results would not be substantially affected by excluding those groups .",
    "there is no strong link between the presence of detectable cavities and the current radio power of the central group galaxy .",
    "for example , the geometric mean of @xmath39 is very similar for the three subsamples , @xmath44  w  hz@xmath5 ( c  sample ) , @xmath45  w  hz@xmath5 ( p ) , and @xmath46  w  hz@xmath5 ( n ) .",
    "again , excluding groups with upper limits to @xmath39 does not change this conclusion .",
    "we also note that no strong trend is seen between projected cavity distance @xmath17 and @xmath39 , with the data showing a small correlation coefficient of 0.4 .",
    "finally , to search for evidence of a 1.4  ghz radio plasma at the location of the cavities , we have compared the x - ray and radio morphology of the groups in the c and p  samples , using radio data extracted from nvss and first .",
    "since the cavities are generally present on spatial scales well below the resolution of nvss data , comparison between _ chandra _ and nvss data generally provides no clear evidence of any morphological similarities . however , 12 of our groups have higher - resolution first data in ned , and of those 12 systems , we show the six groups belonging to the c or p  samples in figure  [ radio_images ] .",
    "no clear association between the x - ray cavities and any radio lobes is seen , however .",
    "it remains a possibility that the cavities coincide with radio emission at frequencies well below 1.4  ghz ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "to test the performance of the adopted methods for cavity detection and better understand the biases inherent in either method , we next generated a set of mock images designed to match typical _ chandra _ exposures within our sample .",
    "these images were then analyzed in a manner similar to that of the real data .",
    "this section describes the generation and analysis of these mock data .",
    "the mock images were generated by first modeling the group emission as an elliptical @xmath0model .",
    "cavities were superposed as circular depressions in local surface brightness , and a spatially uniform background was added .",
    "the following sets of model parameters were considered :    * @xmath47 \\{0.35 , 0.50 , 0.65}. * core radius @xmath48  pixels .",
    "* total number of source counts @xmath49 \\{5,000 , 15,000 , 30,000}. * cavity strength  ( the local surface brightness depression factor ) : \\{1.5 , 2.0 , 2.5}. * projected cavity distance @xmath17 from x - ray peak in pixels : \\{15 , 35}.    this choice of parameters was generally motivated by the results for our real sample .",
    "the adopted @xmath0values span the range of fitted values covered by all but four of our groups . to keep the number of output images at reasonable levels ,",
    "@xmath11 was fixed for all mock data .",
    "this should not introduce any substantial systematic bias in the results , since figure  [ beta_rc ] shows that @xmath11 does not vary systematically with @xmath0 for our groups .",
    "values of @xmath50 were chosen to range from the median of the groups with no detected cavities ( @xmath51 ) to a value below that of hcg62 , one of the groups with the most prominent and obvious cavities .",
    "for the cavity radii , we assumed @xmath52 , in rough agreement with equation  ( [ eq : ad ] ) .",
    "a total of 54 mock images were generated to span all combinations of the above parameters .",
    "for each image , a uniform background level was added , drawn from a gaussian distribution with a mean equal to the approximate 0.32  kev value for a typical 50-ks acis - s exposure ( @xmath53  counts  arcsec@xmath54 ) , and with @xmath38 = 0.2@xmath55mean .",
    "the minor - to - major axis ratio of the @xmath0model was drawn from a gaussian with mean 0.8 and @xmath56 @xcite , but was restricted to @xmath57 .",
    "position angles of the @xmath0model and of the cavities themselves were independently drawn randomly from a uniform distribution .",
    "the resulting surface brightness model was then convolved with the _ chandra _ point spread function , derived using the mkpsf  tool in ciao at a photon energy of 1  kev and at the detector position of the acis - s3 aimpoint .",
    "finally , poisson noise was added to the mock images .",
    "other instrumental effects ( or point sources ) were not included , since the model fitting to the real data was performed on exposure - corrected and point - source excised images .",
    "admittedly , the model setup is a rather simplistic one ; we assume the number of cavities in each system is always two , they represent similar ( local ) brightness depressions , appear circular , and are at the same distances from the center of the x - ray emission .",
    "as such , orientation effects were not taken into account ( e.g. , the cavities were assumed to be in the plane of the sky ) . however , since the purpose of this exercise was simply to test and understand our ability to recover cavities in the real data under reasonably favorable conditions , a detailed exploration of the full cavity parameter space would be beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we applied both the methods described in section  [ sec : analysis ] to the mock images in a test of the veracity of either approach .",
    "figure  [ mock_image ] shows two example mock images , with @xmath5830,000 and 5,000 , respectively , along with the results of our two methods . for the brighter source ,",
    "the input cavities are easily recognizable in both output images . for the fainter case , however , there is some ambiguity as to the apparent location of cavities in the two output images .",
    "we will return to this issue below .",
    "figure  [ mock_rcbeta ] shows the distributions of best - fit values of core radius and @xmath0 obtained from surface brightness modeling of all the mock images .",
    "encouragingly , all distributions are peaked at the input values , lending credibility to the use of this method for describing group emission on large scales .",
    "for example , even though the mock sources are , on average , fainter than our real ones , there is no overlap between the resulting distributions for the three input values of @xmath0 .",
    "figure  [ mock_eff ] summarizes the results of searching for cavities in both the output mock images , the quotient images , and the residual images .",
    "while the rate of `` certain '' cavity recovery is comparable for the unprocessed and quotient images , using the residual images is clearly more efficient , with the success rate increasing by a factor of two ( from 1417 to 30 out of the 54 data sets ) .",
    "+    we found that all four controllable input parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath59 , cavity strength and distance ) influence the identification of cavities , even when applying the relatively successful model fitting approach .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ mock_3d ] , which outlines the impact of changing the various model input parameters , again using the classification described in section  [ sec : detection ] .",
    "in particular , the value of @xmath50 emerges as a crucial factor for cavity recovery . among the 18 mock images with @xmath605,000 , only eight were identified as hosting possible cavities in the residual images , while for @xmath6130,000",
    ", the corresponding value is 17 out of 18 .",
    "remaining input parameters also play a role .",
    "for example , at fixed @xmath50 , cavity recovery is more efficient for @xmath62 compared to @xmath63 , and for higher cavity strength and smaller distance .",
    "another lesson from the mock data was that poisson noise can easily mask one of the two cavities in x - ray faint sources . in other words , visual identification of only one cavity in unprocessed data does not necessarily exclude the presence of a second cavity . finally , we note that we found no clear correlation between the identification or input properties of cavities and various statistical moments of the photon number distribution in the residual images .    naturally , we can not with confidence exclude the possibility that a few cavities have been falsely identified in the _",
    "chandra data_. this problem necessarily also plagues all other similar studies to some extent , but could be particularly acute for the present work since we have not incorporated radio data or other means to aid in cavity detection .",
    "we have reasons to believe that this issue is not important within our present analysis . first , as already discussed in section  [ sec : result ] , our comparison to existing results suggests that we have been rather conservative in our cavity identification .",
    "second , none of the identified cavities appears severely discrepant in figure  [ size_distance ] ( note in particular the tightness of the observed correlation between estimated major and minor axis ) , which argues against a significant population of falsely identified cavities .",
    "third , as mentioned above , within the lowest - s / n mock subsample ( featuring 5,000 net counts ) , we identified cavities in eight out of 18 cases .",
    "as can be gleaned from table  [ table : cavity ] , the corresponding fraction for all the real data sets with @xmath645,000 counts is comparable but slightly smaller , seven out of 19 .",
    "this further supports the notion that the incidence of falsely identified cavities in our _ chandra _ sample must be small .",
    "the two methods considered here for revealing small - scale structure in extended emission each have their strengths and weaknesses .",
    "the model - fitting approach clearly requires data of fairly high signal - to - noise ratio to ensure convergence in the fitting process .",
    "in addition , it assumes a model for the underlying large - scale emission which may not always provide a good description . with unsharp",
    "masking , no assumptions are needed for the large - scale morphology , but the method requires a highly non - trivial choice of smoothing scales .",
    "furthermore , the method normally assumes a circular smoothing kernel , so the smoothing on large scales could potentially generate spurious cavities in systems with a highly elliptical x - ray morphology .",
    "a general conclusion based on all 54  mock images is that the model - fitting method seems superior to unsharp masking in recovering clearly identifiable cavity structures , cf .",
    "figure  [ mock_eff ] .",
    "this is perhaps not surprising , given that the underlying group emission in these data is perfectly described by a @xmath0model ( modulo poisson uncertainties on source and background counts ) .",
    "however , this finding is not limited to our mock data ; despite careful consideration of the smoothing scales employed , figures  [ certain_cavity ] and figure  [ possible_cavity ] show that unsharp masking often produces a lower contrast between the cavities and their surroundings than the output from the model fitting approach .",
    "the top panel of figure  [ mock_image ] further illustrates this point for the mock data , showing another example in which cavities in the residual image are more prominent than those in the quotient image .",
    "another interesting conclusion can be reached from the bottom panel of figure  [ mock_image ] , which emulates a low - s /",
    "n data set with only weak cavities . in this case",
    ", the two input cavities are reasonably well recovered in the residual image , whereas the quotient image from unsharp masking would lead one to conclude , incorrectly , that cavities are present to the east and west of the center of the group emission .",
    "hence , even in an idealized case such as this , unsharp masking applied to low - s / n data can produce misleading results .",
    "this serves as a cautionary note if using this method alone to search for cavities .",
    "consistency tests using other methods , and/or the inclusion of radio data to support the existence of cavities , may be crucial for reliable identification of cavities in x - ray faint systems .",
    "in addition , the model fitting approach is occasionally able to recover structure that is not seen in the quotient images .",
    "for example , in the residual image of a1991 ( figure  [ certain_cavity ] ) , two cavities are clearly visible , while unsharp masking only hints at the presence of the northern cavity .",
    "nevertheless , unsharp masking can still provide a very useful supplement to visual inspection and surface brightness fitting .",
    "this is particularly true in the cases where model fitting clearly fails to converge on sensible parameters ( typically in relatively low ",
    "s / n data ) , and for groups in which there are more complicated structures which can not be described by an elliptical @xmath0model .",
    "as seen in figures  [ certain_cavity ] and [ possible_cavity ] , a number of our groups belong to the latter category . for example",
    ", ic1262 presents a sharp surface brightness discontinuity in the central regions , possibly related to a cold front @xcite .",
    "ngc4104 shows a clear depression in central surface brightness , possibly due to cavities being oriented along the line of sight . for rxj1159 + 5531 , the fitting approach fails to clearly uncover the two cavities hinted at north - east and south - west of the group center in the unprocessed image .",
    "these are located at either end of an x - ray jet , itself situated at the center of the diffuse emission and visible in the raw data ( although not clearly so in figure  [ possible_cavity ] ) . in the residual image , the cavities are overshadowed by some structure generated in the fitting process as a consequence of the complex core morphology in this system . in all these cases , unsharp masking provides valuable aid in cavity identification .",
    "in total , we find that 26 out of our 51 groups ( @xmath65% ) show at least tentative evidence for the presence of cavities .",
    "while this is statistically inconsistent at the @xmath66 level with _ all _ our groups showing cavities , our experimentation with mock images suggests that the real fraction might be higher . in particular , since the total number of source counts plays such an important role for the detectability of cavities in our mock data , it is relevant to examine the distribution of total source counts for our real sample .",
    "figure  [ cts_stat ] shows the connection between @xmath50 for the observed groups , as defined in section  [ sec : result ] , and our cavity detection results .",
    "groups with @xmath6710,000 are very likely to be identified as harboring cavities , while more than two - thirds of the systems with lower @xmath50 show no clear evidence of these .",
    "successful cavity detection is thus clearly biased towards groups with high - s / n data . despite this ,",
    "there _ are _ real ( and mock ) groups with a large number of counts ( @xmath6830,000 ) for which cavities are not detected . in real data",
    ", this could certainly be because cavities are absent or present a low intrinsic x - ray contrast , as suggested by our mock results .",
    "alternatively , it may be due to orientation effects , the impact of which we have not tested with the mock data .",
    "also , as discussed above , some of our groups show features which are clearly not well described by a @xmath0model , a fact which could also complicate cavity recovery when relying on surface brightness modeling in the process .    nevertheless , given the lower mean s / n of the mock systems with non - detected cavities , our inability to detect cavities in many of the low - s / n _ chandra _ data sets may still be consistent with the presence of cavities in these systems .",
    "as mentioned , for the lowest - s / n mock subsample , cavities are identified in 8/18 systems , consistent with the 7/19 found in real data . including brighter systems ( @xmath6915,000 net counts ) , corresponding values are @xmath70% ( mock ) and @xmath71% ( real ) , just consistent at 1-@xmath38 . the total rate of systems showing evidence of identifiable cavities in the mock data of 42/54 ( @xmath72% ) is higher than that of the _ chandra _ sample however , but the fractions are still consistent at the 90% confidence level . in that sense ,",
    "our results are broadly consistent with the possibility that most , if not all , of our real groups do harbor cavities .",
    "however , we strongly caution against over - interpreting these numbers .",
    "our simplified mock setup was not designed to reproduce the full complexity of the real sample , and the above comparison should be considered indicative at best .",
    "hence , we do not claim our results to suggest that _ all _ our groups contain cavities , only that the actual fraction is likely considerably higher than the @xmath73% suggested by our analysis .",
    "a somewhat related question is that of the incidence of central radio agn within our sample . since six of our groups",
    "are excluded from such considerations due to source confusion or lack of 1.4-ghz coverage , we can not make statistically robust statements for the full sample .",
    "however , among the remaining 45 systems , 34 ( @xmath74% ) host a detectable central radio source . this fraction is higher than the corresponding incidence of detectable cavities ( 23/45 , @xmath75% ) , but only marginally so , and it rises to 21/23 ( consistent with 100% ) if only considering the groups in the combined c and p  sample . as such",
    ", the fraction of detectable central radio agn is comparable to that of identifiable cavities , especially considering that the latter is likely a lower limit to the true fraction .",
    "we do note that while the n  sample is statistically underrepresented among groups with detectable radio agn , this is not necessarily the case if adopting a fixed cut in @xmath39 so as to focus on radio - loud agn alone .",
    "this is already hinted at in figure  [ radio_stat ] , which indicates no connection between the presence of detectable cavities and the current radio power of the central group galaxy .",
    "furthermore , given that nvss sensitivity is nearly uniform @xcite and that the weakest detected radio source within our sample is also the nearest and has a flux just below the nvss 99% completeness limit , it is clear that all our groups could potentially harbor a central agn with a 1.4-ghz luminosity brighter than this source ( @xmath76  w  hz@xmath5 ) .      with half of our sample showing some evidence of cavities",
    ", our groups are lying between results for individual giant elliptical galaxies ( @xmath77 ; @xcite ) and the x - ray brightest cool - core clusters ( @xmath78 ; @xcite ) .",
    "our results in section  [ sec : mock ] suggests that these differences can be at least partly explained by observational biases that favor cavity detection in high  flux systems . in addition , as discussed in section  [ sec : result ] , the surface brightness distribution of groups is generally flatter than in clusters across the relevant radial ranges . the dependence on @xmath0 of the cavity recovery rate ( cf .",
    "figure  [ mock_3d ] ) may therefore also play a role for the above results .",
    "alternatively , the observed differences in detectable cavity fraction may reflect a more fundamental connection between the presence of high - contrast x - ray cavities and global system properties such as x - ray luminosity or total mass . under the plausible assumption that x - ray cavities are generated by a radio outburst in the central agn",
    ", the lower cavity fraction in smaller systems could be explained by a systematic variation in central agn duty cycle with system mass .",
    "if x - ray fainter systems generally have shorter central radio outbursts , clearly detectable cavities are perhaps inflated by the agn in a smaller fraction of those systems .",
    "the observed lack of a link between the 1.4  ghz luminosity of any radio source within the central galaxy and the presence of detectable cavities in our sample seems consistent with this possibility .",
    "if the outburst phase is relatively short , bright 1.4  ghz emission within the central galaxy may already have subsided when detectable cavities emerge in the intragroup medium .",
    "this scenario should be testable with lower - frequency radio data which trace the older , less energetic electron populations from the outburst .",
    "such studies are currently underway @xcite .    with regard to the properties of the detected cavities themselves ,",
    "another finding of our study is that cavity radii in the radial and tangential directions are highly correlated , with the ratio of the two remaining roughly constant regardless of cavity size .",
    "the implication of equations  ( [ eq : ab])([eq : bd ] ) is that bubbles retain a mean axis ratio of @xmath79 as they rise and expand in the surrounding medium , until eventually shredded by hydrodynamic instabilities .",
    "this finding is in excellent quantitative agreement with results for massive galaxy clusters @xcite , as illustrated in figure  [ size_distance ] , suggesting that it is a generic feature of cavity evolution regardless of the depth of the local gravitational potential and the entropy gradient of the ambient medium ( which set the characteristic buoyancy rise time of the bubbles ) .",
    "moreover , the tight correlation between the size of the cavity and the projected cavity distance from the group center ( as shown in figure  [ size_distance ] ) indicates that the apparent angle opened by the cavity to the center of the group remains nearly constant at @xmath80 during the evolution of the cavity .",
    "this is also in remarkable agreement with the case of clusters @xcite , indicating that similar physical processes are responsible for bubble evolution , and their disruption , in systems covering a large range in total mass .",
    "it is interesting to note that the gas temperature profiles for our sample @xcite indicate that 43 of our groups host a cool core , with the eight non - cool core systems all belonging to the n  sample .",
    "hence , the ( c and p  sample ) cavity fraction is @xmath81% for cool - core groups , in contrast to the complete absence of identifiable cavities among our non  cool core systems .",
    "however , this need not reflect any intrinsic differences between cool - core and non - cool core systems , since cavity detectability is conceivably biased toward cool - core systems with bright central regions ( as suggested by figure  [ cts_stat ] and by the increase in cavity recovery rate with both @xmath50 and @xmath0 for our mock data sets ) . on the other hand , barring differences in normalization , the surface brightness profiles of our different subsamples show very similar behavior , with comparable mean values of @xmath0 and @xmath11 . as such",
    ", there is no clear evidence that the surface brightness distribution is more centrally peaked for the c and p  samples , making it worthwhile to briefly discuss whether the different cavity detection rates for cool - core and non - cool core systems reflect a real effect .",
    "while a detailed discussion of the cool core / non  cool core distinction and its possible origins is well beyond the scope of this work , we do note that an increased fraction of detectable cavities among cool - core groups would fit the picture of a self - sustained cooling - driven feedback loop : strong central cooling of icm material feeds the supermassive black hole in the central group galaxy , which responds with a radio outburst that creates cavities in the surrounding medium and temporarily re - heats it , until radiative cooling can re - ignite the process .",
    "some support for this comes from the work of @xcite , based on a _ chandra _ study of 36 ellipticals , ten of which are central group galaxies in our sample ( and of which eight show evidence of cavities in the present work ) .",
    "these authors found a relation between the inner radial gas temperature gradient and the central radio agn power , in the sense that positive ( and steeper ) inner gradients are preferentially found in optically brighter ellipticals with stronger central radio sources ( but see also @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "in addition , practically all our groups with identifiable cavities host a detectable central radio source .",
    "although these results suggest a connection between strong central icm cooling , a powerful agn radio output , and the presence of detectable cavities , we emphasize that there is still very little _ direct _ evidence for central gas cooling to low temperatures in groups or clusters . in particular , deep x - ray grating spectroscopy of a262 , a3581 , and hcg62 , all belonging to our c  sample , has failed to reveal material cooling to below @xmath82  kev in their central regions @xcite .",
    "it is also unclear how the central black hole would accomplish the distributed heating required to completely halt catastrophic cooling at the group core , even if only temporarily .",
    "thus , while the above picture may seem appealing , many of its details still await observational and theoretical verification .    once formed , the properties of cavities themselves may help to shed light on the processes responsible for their production . in recent years",
    "several authors have employed numerical techniques to study the evolution of buoyant bubbles in galaxy groups and clusters , including purely inviscid hydrodynamical simulations in two @xcite and three dimensions @xcite .",
    "results generally show that although under certain circumstances the bubbles could be long - lived , purely hydrodynamical evolution usually can not prevent bubbles from being rapidly shredded by rayleigh  taylor , kelvin ",
    "helmholtz , or richtmyer  meshkov instabilities ( e.g. , @xcite ) . to prevent bubble disruption , additional physics such as magnetic fields , thermal conductivity , and viscosity are probably required . with certain geometries ,",
    "a magnetic field could help to protect the bubble @xcite .",
    "our observation of cavities at projected distances of @xmath83  kpc from the group core implies that bubbles are reasonably resilient to disruption processes , thus confirming the necessity of incorporating such additional physics in numerical work @xcite .",
    "alternatively , it has been demonstrated that if a bubble is continuously being inflated by a purely hydrodynamical jet @xcite or a magnetically dominated jet @xcite , under some circumstances the development of hydrodynamical instabilities could also be suppressed , thus keeping bubbles intact for longer @xcite . however , the fact that we find no clear link between the presence of detectable cavities and the current luminosity of any central radio source seems to argue against this mechanism as a general feature in our groups .    to briefly explore the possibility of distinguishing between different model predictions for cavity evolution",
    ", we can adopt the approach of @xcite .",
    "these authors consider a range of different models for the formation and evolution of cavities , under the reasonable assumptions that the bubbles rise subsonically in the icm in pressure equilibrium with their surroundings , with the icm background density described by a @xmath0model .",
    "the models considered include one of purely hydrodynamic , adiabatically expanding bubbles containing gas with an adiabatic index @xmath84 ( here denoted `` ad53 '' for consistency with @xcite ) , and a model in which bubbles are generated by a current - dominated jet ( `` cdj '' , see , e.g. , @xcite ) and have magnetically dominated pressure . in both these models ,",
    "predicted bubble radii @xmath15 grow with clustercentric distance @xmath17 as @xmath85^\\alpha$ ] , with @xmath86 and @xmath87 for the ad53 and cdj models , respectively .",
    "the asymptotic growth of the bubbles ( at @xmath88 ) is thus a powerful discriminator of these different models . among the models discussed by @xcite",
    ", ad53 represents the slowest and cdj the fastest expansion of the bubbles . when plotted against @xmath89 , (",
    "* their figure  2 ) find that observed cavity sizes at @xmath90 suggest that bubbles expand relatively fast , with cdj the preferred model .    for comparison , we show a similar plot for our cavity sample in figure  [ models ] .",
    "overplotted are model predictions for the ad53 and cdj models , both assuming a fixed value of @xmath22 , the mean value for our groups with detectable cavities .",
    "it is clear that we can not easily distinguish between these two simple models .",
    "this is largely due to a dearth of systems with distant cavities in our sample , since  unlike @xcite  we have only a handful of cavities detected well outside the icm core radius . a larger group sample , particularly including systems with distant cavities , would be required to make robust statements on the nature of cavities in groups . however , since the cavities within our sample appear to obey the same scaling relations as seen in more massive systems , constraints from studies of cavities in clusters @xcite are likely to apply in our groups as well .",
    "based on _ chandra _ archival data of 51 galaxy groups , we have presented the first systematic search for , and analysis of , x - ray cavities in a large sample of groups .",
    "at least nine of these groups have previously been reported to show evidence of such cavities . in the present work",
    ", the cavities are identified from _",
    "chandra _ data alone , either by subtracting an elliptical @xmath0model fit from the x - ray surface brightness distribution , or by performing unsharp masking using two gaussian smoothing kernels . based on visual inspection of the resulting images ,",
    "13 groups ( @xmath77 ) within our sample are identified as clearly harboring cavities , and another 13 groups ( @xmath77 ) show tentative evidence for cavities .",
    "all of these 26 systems show clear evidence for a cool core .",
    "the remaining 25 groups have a lower cool - core fraction ( @xmath91% ) and do not show convincing evidence for the presence of cavities .",
    "the total fraction of groups with some evidence of cavities in our sample is thus 50% , rising to 60% if only considering the cool - core systems . in this respect , our groups are lying between results for individual giant elliptical galaxies ( @xmath77 ; @xcite ) and cool - core clusters ( @xmath78 ; @xcite ) .",
    "we found no clear link between the current 1.4  ghz radio luminosity of the central brightest group galaxy and the detection of cavities .    to test our ability to identify cavities using the two adopted approaches",
    ", we generated a set of mock images designed to mimic typical _",
    "chandra _ images of the observed groups . for these data",
    ", we find that surface brightness modeling is generally superior to unsharp masking in reliably recovering cavity properties , a conclusion echoing one already hinted at from our analysis of the real data .",
    "the results also show that cavity recovery is strongly influenced by a number of factors , including the projected distance between the cavity center and the group center , the significance of the surface brightness depression represented by the cavity , and most importantly , the signal - to - noise ratio of the diffuse group emission .",
    "cavity detectability is highly biased toward x - ray bright systems , implying that the observed cavity fraction in our sample is likely a lower limit .",
    "we find tight correlations between the radial and tangential radii of the cavities in our group sample , and between the size and projected groupcentric distance of cavities .",
    "while we are not able to clearly distinguish between simple model predictions for the evolution of cavities on the basis of our sample alone , we note that the observed correlations are in excellent quantitative agreement with results for more massive clusters .",
