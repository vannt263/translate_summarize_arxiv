    "there is now a big interest in studying strongly interacting matter at high density and/or temperature which is created in high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "indeed , at high densities and/or temperatures , qcd predicts the chiral symmetry restoration and quark deconfinement .",
    "how can we create such matter ?",
    "at present , high energy heavy ion collision is considered to be a unique way to create such dense and hot matter at laboratory . in order to find such a new form of nuclear matter ,",
    "several heavy ion experiments have been and are being performed with si(14.6 ) or au(11.6 ) beam at bnl - ags and with the o(200 ) , s(200 ) or pb(158 ) beam at cern - sps .    since high energy heavy ion collisions",
    "lead to a huge number of final states , many event generators have been proposed to explore these high energy nuclear collisions , with the aid of monte - carlo realization of complex processes . in these event generators , there are mainly three categories of models .",
    "the models in the first category assume glauber geometry for the treatment of aa collisions .",
    "for example , fritiof  @xcite , luciae  @xcite , venus  @xcite , hijing  @xcite , dpm  @xcite , hijet  @xcite and lexus@xcite belong to this category .",
    "final interaction among hadrons are included in venus , hijet and luciae . in these models ,",
    "main quantum features during the multiple scattering are preserved within the eikonal approximation , and efficiently fast calculations are possible .",
    "however , these approaches are mainly designed for the extremely high energy collisions ( @xmath1 ) .",
    "the models in the second category ( parton cascade models ) , such as vni  @xcite and zpc  @xcite , have been recently developed to implement the interaction among partons to study space - time evolution of partons produced in high energy nuclear collisions .",
    "these models have been originally designed to describe ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions at collider energies , such as bnl - rhic and cern - lhc , and they have met some successes in describing heavy ion collisions at cern - sps energies  @xcite .    the third category of models is a transport model which is often referred to as hadronic cascade. for example , rqmd  @xcite , qgsm  @xcite , arc  @xcite , art  @xcite , urqmd  @xcite and hsd  @xcite can be categorized here .",
    "they have been successfully used to describe many aspects of high energy heavy ion collisions in a wide range of incident energies . for the description of aa collisions in hadronic cascade models , the trajectories of all hadrons as well as resonances including produced particles",
    "are followed explicitly as a function of time .",
    "nuclear collisions are modeled by the sum of independent hadron - hadron ( @xmath2 ) collisions without interferences .",
    "two particles are made to collide if their closest distance is smaller than @xmath3 , here @xmath4 represents the total cross section at the c.m .",
    "energy @xmath5 . as a result of the @xmath2 collision",
    ", secondary particles will be produced according to the specific model with some formation time .",
    "one of the most distinct difference among these models may be in the way of implementing hadronic degrees of freedom . in rqmd and urqmd , many established hadronic resonances are explicitly propagated in space - time , while arc , art and hsd do not include higher hadronic resonances .",
    "although both modelings seem to give similar results if we see the final hadronic spectra inclusively , we expect thermodynamic quantities like pressure or temperature before freeze - out predicted by those models would be different from each other  @xcite . another difference is the treatment of multiparticle production . string model is adapted in rqmd , qgsm , urqmd and hsd , while in arc and art , final states are sampled according to the direct parameterization of the experimental data .",
    "the hadronic cascade model based on the string phenomenology implies that some partonic degrees of freedom play some roles in reaction dynamics implicitly .",
    "in fact , the estimation of partonic degrees of freedom has been done recently within urqmd  @xcite .",
    "arc  @xcite has shown that pure hadronic model can describe the data at ags energies . at collider energies , however ,",
    "explicit treatments of partonic degrees of freedom will be necessary .",
    "the main purpose of this work is to perform systematic analyses of collisions from pa to massive aa systems at ags energies , for which high - quality systematic experimental data are available  @xcite , within the hadronic cascade model , jam1.0 , which has been developed recently based on resonances , strings and pqcd .",
    "the main features included in jam are as follows .",
    "( 1 ) at low energies , inelastic @xmath2 collisions are modeled by the resonance productions based on the idea from rqmd and urqmd .",
    "( 2 ) above the resonance region , soft string excitation is implemented along the lines of the hijing model  @xcite .",
    "( 3 ) multiple minijet production is also included in the same way as the hijing model in which jet cross section and the number of jet are calculated using an eikonal formalism for perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) and hard parton - parton scatterings with initial and final state radiation are simulated using pythia  @xcite program .",
    "( 4 ) rescattering of hadrons which have original constituent quarks can occur with other hadrons assuming the additive quark cross section within a formation time .",
    "since these features of the present hadronic cascade model , jam1.0 , enables us to explore heavy ion collisions in a wide energy range , from 100a mev to rhic energies , in a unified way , it is a big challenge for us to make systematic analyses in these energies . in this paper , we focus on the mass dependence of the collision system at ags energies . other applications at higher energies are found elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows .",
    "we will present a detailed description of cross sections and modeling of inelastic processes for @xmath2 collisions in section  [ sec : hcm ] , because elementary @xmath2 processes are essential inputs for the hadronic cascade model . in sec .",
    "[ sec : results ] , we first study the transverse momentum distributions of protons , pions and kaons in p+be , p+al , p+cu , p+au , si+a , si+cu and si+au collisions at the laboratory incident momentum of 14.6a gev / c .",
    "we discuss the role of rescattering by comparing the cascade model results with the glauber type calculations .",
    "we then discuss the collision dynamics for truly heavy ion colliding system au+au collisions .",

    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : proton ] proton invariant transverse mass distributions calculated by our cascade model for the proton induced reactions , p+be , p+al , p+cu , p+au , and silicon induced reactions , central si+al , si+cu , si+au at 14.6gev / c in comparison to the data from the e802 collaboration  @xcite . in each figure , spectra are plotted in a rapidity interval of 0.2 and are displayed by multiplying each by a power of 10 from bottom to upper .",
    "si+al , si+cu and si+au data correspond to the central collision with 7 % centrality .",
    "for the calculations of si+a ( a = al , cu , au ) systems , impact parameter are distributed @xmath184 for si+al , @xmath185 for si+cu and @xmath186 for si+au .",
    "our calculations show good agreement with the data in proton induced reactions . in silicon induced reactions ,",
    "our calculations well account for the experimental data in general .",
    "however , we can see some overestimate at low transverse momenta , in particular for si+au system . as a result",
    ", our cascade model gives larger proton stopping than the data .",
    "now we compare the cascade model results with the glauber type calculation in order to see the effect of pion rescattering , nucleon cascading , and the consequent deviation from the linear extrapolation of sum of binary nucleon - nucleon collisions to proton - nucleus and nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "the glauber type models such as the fritiof model  @xcite have been widely used at higher energies , i.e. more than 200 agev .",
    "we use the same method as the fritiof model with some modifications .",
    "the wounded nucleons become resonances or strings in each nucleon - nucleon collisions , and strings can interact again before they fragment .",
    "resonances can be converted to nucleons , and strings are allowed to be de - excited to the minimum string mass .",
    "after all binary collisions are completed , strings and resonances are forced to decay .",
    "rescattering of produced particles are not considered . in a present treatment , we have used our parameterization in calculating the probability to excite nucleons to resonances or strings .",
    "figure  [ fig : protong ] shows the results obtained by this glauber type calculation . in beam rapidity region",
    ", for all systems , good agreements can be seen because the effect of rescattering would be small as expected . for proton - induced reactions ,",
    "the glauber type calculation gives steeper shape in comparison to the data at mid - rapidity and target regions . in heavy ion reactions , this deviation is significant at around the mid - rapidity .",
    "rescattering , therefore , is necessary to account for transverse momentum distributions of protons for reactions involving heavy nuclei .",
    "we now turn to the mass dependence of the pion transverse distributions . in fig .",
    "[ fig : pip ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : pin ] , we show the calculated @xmath176 and @xmath177 spectra by histograms together with the e802 data  @xcite .",
    "agreement between the cascade model and the data is very good for all the combination of projectile and target , and for both of the slope parameter and the absolute value of the cross section .    on the other hand , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pipg ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : ping ] , glauber type calculations well reproduce the data for small mass systems p+be , p+al , p+cu and si+al , and give similar slopes to the experimental data , while the multiplicity of pions in heavy systems are larger than those of the data .",
    "this is due to the effect of rescattering in which pions are absorbed during the evolution for the large mass systems .",
    "let us study the kaon and anti - kaon transverse mass spectra of e802 .",
    "the calculated transverse mass distributions of @xmath180 and @xmath187 in cascade model are compared with the e802 data  @xcite in figs .",
    "[ fig : kp ] and  [ fig : kn ] .",
    "figures  [ fig : kpg ] and  [ fig : kng ] are the results with the glauber type calculations for @xmath180 and @xmath187 invariant transverse momentum distributions .",
    "we find more significant differences between the cascade and glauber results of kaon productions than those in proton and pion spectra .",
    "this fact shows the importance of the rescattering : as discussed in [ subsec : mbmm ] , some of the exoergic @xmath9 reactions , which involve resonances , have very large strangeness production cross sections , and they contribute to @xmath188 and @xmath189 productions , especially in heavy ion reactions  @xcite .",
    "enhancements due to these meson rescattering are clearly seen in @xmath180 and @xmath187 spectra , except for the reactions of p+be and p+al , because there is no meson - baryon collision in glauber type calculation .",
    "we continue our comparison to e866 experimental data  @xcite with the truly heavy ion collision au+au at 11.6agev . our cascade model calculation with impact parameter @xmath190fm is compared to e866 data  @xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : auaumtp ] from c.m .",
    "rapidity of @xmath191 to @xmath192 with the rapidity bin of 0.1 scaled down by a factor of 10 from the top to the bottom spectrum .",
    "the cascade model results show good agreement with the data at the transverse mass above @xmath193gev/@xmath28 . the cascade model",
    ", however , overpredicts again the proton spectrum in the low transverse momentum region .    in figs .",
    "[ fig : auaurap ] and [ fig : auaumt ] , we compare the cascade model results with the experimental data by e802 collaboration  @xcite in central au+au collisions .",
    "pion multiplicities are in good agreement with data as well as the slopes of both @xmath176 and @xmath177 .",
    "however , the present cascade model does not describe the suppression of protons having low transverse momenta , and consequently it gives stronger stopping of proton than the data .",
    "this proton rapidity spectrum for central au+au collisions shows a similar amount of stopping as those with other cascade models like rqmd  @xcite , arc  @xcite and art  @xcite .",
    "in addition , glauber type calculation gives the same results for the proton rapidity distribution .",
    "therefore , this defect is not a consequence of the cascade model .",
    "since the deviation of the transverse mass spectrum of heavy hadrons from a single exponential behavior is generally considered as a result of the radial flow , it may be influenced by the nuclear mean field .",
    "in fact , it has been found in the works of rqmd  @xcite and art  @xcite nuclear mean field significantly reduces maximum baryon densities of the hadronic matter , and consequently the midrapidity protons becomes small .    in this work",
    ", we have assumed that the elastic and inelastic cross sections involving baryon resonances , except for the de - excitation processes to @xmath35 , are the same as that in @xmath35 channel at the same c.m .",
    "however , since the de - excitation cross sections are enhanced due to the generalized detailed balance as explained in section  [ subsec : detbal ] , if other cross sections is smaller than those of @xmath35 , stopping power may be reduced .      in this section ,",
    "we study the mass dependence of the collision dynamics within the hadronic cascade model .",
    "first we present the cascade model results of @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 collision number as a function of system mass ( @xmath194 ) in comparison to that of glauber type calculations .",
    "figure  [ fig : ncoll ] displays the total collision number of @xmath7 ( open squares ) and @xmath9 ( open circles ) and @xmath11 ( open crosses ) obtained from cascade calculation together with glauber type calculation ( open diamonds ) for the p+a ( left panel ) and si+a ( right panel ) collisions .",
    "when system becomes bigger , @xmath7 collisions are much more frequent in cascade model than in the glauber predictions even in the proton induced collisions .",
    "this indicates that there are successive nucleon cascading in the nuclear medium in the cascade model picture .",
    "it is interesting to see that the number of @xmath7 and @xmath9 collisions are almost the same in heavy ion collisions .",
    "this seems to be the origin of the pion number suppression , the increase in proton transverse momentum slope , and the increase in kaon yield .",
    "indeed we can see the reduction of produced pion multiplicity in cascade model compared to the glauber type calculations as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : mesons ] where the number of total produced mesons are plotted as a function of system mass number .",
    "pions are absorbed mainly in the two - step processes in the cascade model .",
    "for example , the most important pion absorption path at ags energies is @xmath195 therefore , large number of @xmath7 and @xmath9 collisions are necessary to describe appropriate pion absorptions .    in order to get more detailed information on the mass dependence of the collision dynamics at ags energies , we display in fig .",
    "[ fig : colls ] the colliding energy spectrum of @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath11 given by the cascade model together with those from the glauber typer calculations .",
    "the @xmath7 collision distributions as a function of invariant mass are very different between the cascade model and the glauber type model .",
    "the glauber type calculations predict the collisions which are spread around the initial @xmath35 c.m .",
    "energy , while the @xmath7 collisions occur at all available collision energies in the cascade model . in both p+a and a+b reactions ,",
    "the @xmath9 collisions are pronounced in the resonance region ( @xmath196gev ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that in p+au system , the number of low energy @xmath7 collision is much larger than that of p+be , p+al and p+cu systems . in a+b systems ( bottom of fig .",
    "[ fig : colls ] ) , collision number grows very quickly , however , the shape of the collision spectrum is similar in all the systems .",
    "we have systematically studied the system mass dependence of the particle distributions at ags energies with a newly developed cascade model ( jam1.0 ) .",
    "the cascade model is shown to provide a good description of the observed data for various combination of projectile and target without any change of model parameters .",
    "the effect of rescattering of produced particles and nucleon cascading are found to be important to explain both the pion yield and the transverse slope , which are demonstrated by comparing the cascade model results with the glauber type calculations .",
    "those effects increase the transverse momentum slopes of protons and pions , and reduce the pion yield .",
    "the importance of the rescattering among particles is more visible in kaon spectra .",
    "one of the problems in the hadronic cascade model jam is that it gives much larger stopping of the protons in nucleus - nucleus collisions .",
    "this large stopping is not the consequence of the rescattering because glauber type calculation also gives the same amount of baryon stopping .",
    "this problem of strong baryon stopping in cascade models has been reported that proton spectra can be fitted by the inclusion of nuclear mean field in rqmd  @xcite and art  @xcite .",
    "another possible solution may be to suppress the cross sections such as @xmath197 , which is assumed to be the same as that in @xmath35 ingoing channel at the same c.m .",
    "momentum in a present model .",
    "these interactions among resonances become important at ags energies where we have sufficiently dense matter in heavy ion collisions , and the baryon stopping is sensitive to the cross sections in the resonance ingoing reactions . in fact",
    ", we have checked that if resonance - resonance ( bb ) cross sections are reduced from nucleon - nucleon cross section , we get less proton stopping than the present results .",
    "detailed study in this line will be interesting .",
