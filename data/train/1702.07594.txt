    "the discovery of nucleon spin puzzle created the field of high - energy spin physics .",

    "there are some theoretical studies on the tensor - polarized structure functions , and the first measurement of @xmath1 was reported by the hermes collaboration @xcite .",
    "a useful parametrization was proposed for the tensor - polarized parton distribution functions ( pdfs ) from the hermes data @xcite by using a constraint for the @xmath1 sum proposed for the tensor - polarized valence - quark distributions @xcite .",
    "although the @xmath1 data are not still accurate , the measurement indicates interesting features different from conventional theoretical calculations . as the deviation from the naive - quark - model prediction created the topic of nucleon spin puzzle , it is important to show a conventional theoretical estimate with the standard deuteron model since a possible experimental deviation may indicate a",
    " tensor - polarization puzzle \" .",
    "as such a  standard \" model of the deuteron for describing the twist - two structure function @xmath1 , we use a convolution picture .",
    "namely , the tensor - polarized structure function @xmath1 is given by unpolarized structure functions convoluted with tensor - polarized lightcone momentum distributions of the nucleon .",
    "there are such studies for @xmath1 in refs .",
    "we try to test their results by independent ways .",
    "we use two theoretical descriptions .",
    "one is a basic convolution model and another is the virtual - nucleon - approximation model .",
    "such convolution models have been used also as a baseline calculation for the nuclear structure function @xmath3 at medium and large @xmath2 in which nuclear effects were taken into account through the binding and nucleon fermi motion in a nucleus together with short - range correlations .",
    "these physics ingredients are contained in the spectral function , which is the nucleon s four - momentum distribution in the nucleus .",
    "we directly apply such descriptions for calculating the structure function @xmath1 .",
    "if the calculated @xmath1 distribution is much different from the hermes measurement , a new hadron physics mechanism could be considered beyond the standard model of the deuteron in describing the tensor structure in terms of quark and gluon degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "the purpose of our research is to show the convolution result on @xmath1 as the standard theoretical estimate and to discuss its comparison with the hermes data @xcite .",
