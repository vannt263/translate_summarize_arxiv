    "globular clusters are important astrophysical laboratories for two different processes : stellar evolution and stellar dynamics .",
    "a population of stars with the same age , composition and distance has been an ideal place in which to test theories of stellar evolution , beginning with the basic evolutionary tracks and now including such details of stellar structure and evolution as diffusion of heavy elements or convective overshoot ( e.g. chaboyer _ et  al . _",
    "1992 , brocato _ et  al . _",
    "a globular cluster can also be considered to be a dense system of @xmath0 point masses which interact only under the influence of their mutual gravity .",
    "these simple systems are obvious choices in which to test n - body calculations and other dynamical simulations ( dull _ et  al . _  1997 ,",
    "et  al . _",
    "1987 , meylan & heggie 1997 and references therein ) .",
    "it is becoming apparent , however , that we can no longer study these two astrophysical processes independently if we are to completely understand globular clusters .",
    "stellar evolution tells us that contrary to the simple dynamic assumptions , stars are not point masses with infinite lifetimes , but instead have finite radii and have lifetimes which are shorter for more massive stars .",
    "these properties can have a significant impact on the dynamical processes .",
    "for example , a result of equipartition of energy in the cluster is mass segregation , which causes the more massive stars to sink toward the centre of the cluster ( lightman & shapiro 1978 ) .",
    "these massive stars have shorter lifetimes than their less massive counterparts , and will evolve into stellar remnants more quickly .",
    "these remnants tend to have a smaller mass than their parent star , and so the distribution of masses in the core of the cluster will change as the stars evolve .",
    "this change in the mass function will affect the rate of core collapse and other dynamical processes ( chernoff & weinberg 1990 ) .    the presence of stars with finite radii allows for the possibility of physical stellar collisions or tidal interactions .",
    "these collisions will change the energy budget in the cluster , which can influence the timescales on which core collapse , mass segregation and other dynamical processes occur ( spitzer 1987 ) .",
    "the collision products may be objects which can not be explained by standard stellar evolution theory , such as blue stragglers , low mass x - ray binaries and millisecond pulsars ( see bailyn 1995 for a review ) .",
    "since these stars have very different masses and lifetimes than normal globular cluster members , their presence can affect the mass function of a region of the cluster , which can then modify the timescales for dynamical processes .",
    "therefore , the study of stellar collision products can lead to an understanding of the interactions between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics in globular clusters .    one possible class of collision product to study is blue straggler stars .",
    "blue stragglers are stars which are bluer and brighter than the main sequence turnoff .",
    "they have the same surface gravity values as main sequence stars ( rodgers & roberts 1995 , shara _",
    "et  al . _",
    "1997 ) , and therefore must have been born more recently that the majority of stars in the cluster .",
    "blue stragglers are thought to be created by the merger of two normal globular cluster stars , either through the merger of the two components of a binary star system , or through direct stellar collisions ( stryker 1993 ) .",
    "both creation mechanisms are expected to occur , and which mechanism is dominant depends on the binary population and the density of the environment .",
    "recent studies of the creation and subsequent evolution of collisional blue stragglers ( bailyn & pinsonneault 1995 , sills",
    "_ et  al . _",
    "1995 , ouellette & pritchet 1996 , 1998 , sandquist _ et  al . _",
    "1997 ) used the results of sph simulations of stellar collisions to predict the initial structure and composition of blue stragglers . a number of different cases",
    "were then evolved using a stellar evolution code .",
    "the results were presented as a series of evolutionary tracks , or simple assumptions were made about the collision rate and luminosity functions were calculated ( bailyn & pinsonneault 1995 ) . in this paper , we extend these approaches , and combine the evolutionary tracks with detailed binary - single star encounter cross sections and crude cluster dynamics to model the distribution of blue stragglers in the colour - magnitude diagram of globular clusters .    in section 2 ,",
    "we present a method for calculating the total number and distribution of collisional blue stragglers in the colour - magnitude diagram . in section 3",
    ", we discuss our input assumptions , and in section 4 we produce theoretical colour - magnitude diagrams of blue stragglers for a variety of these assumptions . in section 5 , we apply this method to the globular cluster m3 as a specific example .",
    "we wish to determine the distribution of blue stragglers in a colour - magnitude diagram . in order to do that",
    ", we must calculate the number of stars in each ( colour , absolute magnitude ) box as follows : @xmath1 summed over all collision products @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the cross section for the @xmath2th collision product , a function of the parents of the collision and the outcome ; @xmath4 is the flux of the parents of the collision which results in a particular outcome @xmath2 , and @xmath5 is the time spent in a box of @xmath6 on the evolutionary track of the collision product .",
    "each of these three components are discussed in detail in the following sections .",
    "the cross sections for collisions between single stars is ( e.g. spitzer 1987 ) @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the masses of the two colliding stars , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are their radii , and @xmath12 is the relative velocity of the two stars at infinity .",
    "direct stellar collisions can also be mediated by binary systems . since binary systems have a larger effective area than single stars ( proportional to the semi - major axis rather than the stellar radius ) , interactions between single stars and binaries are more likely than between two single stars for a given density of the environment ( hills 1975 , heggie 1975 , leonard 1989 ) . when a binary and a single star interact , many outcomes are possible",
    ". in general , the third star perturbs the binary system for a time .",
    "if that perturbation is large enough , the three stars undergo a resonance encounter and form an unstable triple system with a very complicated orbit ( hut & bahcall 1983 ) . during this period , two , or even all three of the stars ,",
    "can pass close enough to each other to physically collide .",
    "we used a program based on starlab ( mcmillan 1996 ) for calculating cross sections for collisions between binary and single stars .",
    "this program is an automated monte carlo routine which chooses binary systems and single stars from some specified distribution , and then fires the single star at the binary system with a range of incoming angles .",
    "the results of each interaction are tallied , and a cross section is determined as a function of the binary system , the single star , and the resultant collision product ( or lack thereof ) .",
    "collisions between two stars and those between all three stars ( triple collisions ) are taken into account .",
    "the fluxes of the collision parents depend on many parameters , some relevant to the cluster as a whole , and some dependent on the specific star or binary system involved .",
    "fluxes are of the form @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the density of the objects involved , and @xmath15 is their relative velocity .",
    "a full exploration of the effects of the range of relative velocities and the variation of density with cluster radius expected in real physical systems requires a more complete dynamical model than we can explore in this paper . for simplicity",
    ", we have assumed that all objects in the cluster have a relative velocity equal to the velocity dispersion of the cluster .",
    "the overall density of the region of interest ( the core of the cluster ) was assumed to be constant and equal to the central density of the cluster .",
    "we need to then determine what fraction of that density is in the form of the particular parent stars and binary systems we wish to consider .",
    "the density of collision parents is simply the total density multiplied by the probability of choosing such systems from the total distribution of systems . that probability depends on the distribution of stars by mass , the binary fraction in the region of the cluster , and the period distribution of the binary systems .",
    "we have assumed a mass function of the form @xmath16 so that @xmath17 for a salpeter mass distribution .",
    "therefore , the probability of choosing a particular mass @xmath18 within @xmath19 from this distribution is @xmath20 where @xmath21    for collisions between two single stars , the probability of choosing the two stars in question from the global mass function is simply the product of the individual probabilities of choosing those stars , and so the flux of parents for a single star ",
    "single star collision is @xmath22 where @xmath23 is defined above .",
    "when a single star collides with a binary system , there are more parameters to consider .",
    "we must specify the masses of the binary system , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , the period of the binary @xmath24 and its eccentricity @xmath25 . in order to specify",
    "how likely it is to have a particular combination of @xmath8 and @xmath9 in a binary system , we must make some assumption about how the binary system was formed .",
    "in general , we assume that the binary components were randomly selected from a particular mass function which is not necessarily the same as the mass function of the single stars",
    ". then we must include the distribution of binary systems by total mass in the cluster .",
    "for this , we again use a mass function of the same form as in equation 3 above .",
    "thus , there are three mass functions relevant to the problem : one describing the distribution of single stars in the core of the cluster , one describing the distribution of binary stars in the cluster , and one describing the distribution of the components of the binary system . in principle",
    ", these three mass functions can be different , but in practice we have assumed that the single stars and the binary systems are currently distributed in the cluster with the same mass function .",
    "this is a reasonable assumption since mass segregation causes the more massive objects to sink to the centre of the cluster , resulting in a mass function heavily skewed toward massive stars and binaries .",
    "this should result in similar mass functions regardless of initial distribution .",
    "when the binary systems formed , however , their components were presumably drawn from the same initial mass function as the single stars , which will include fewer massive stars than the current mass function .",
    "note that we are assuming that the binary systems are primordial .",
    "we must also include the binary fraction , which we have defined to be the fraction of systems which are binary .    therefore , the flux of parents of a collision between a single star and a binary system is @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the binary fraction .",
    "the evolutionary tracks were calculated using the yale rotating evolution code ( yrec ) in its non - rotating configuration .",
    "we used the latest opal opacities ( iglesias & rogers 1996 ) for the interior of the star down to temperatures of @xmath28 . for lower temperatures",
    ", we used the low - temperature opacities of alexander & ferguson ( 1994 ) . for",
    "a detailed description of the other physics included in this stellar evolution code , see guenther _",
    "et  al . _   ( 1992 ) .",
    "we have calculated two sets of evolutionary tracks for blue stragglers .",
    "for the first set , we assumed that stellar collisions between globular cluster stars are violent events which result in fully mixed collision products ( benz & hills 1987 ) .",
    "these models are calculated in the following way .",
    "each parent star in the collision is evolved to 15 gyr and the total mass of helium in each star is calculated .",
    "the two ( or three , for a triple collision ) helium masses are summed , and the collision product is assumed to have lost 5% of its total mass during the collision ( 10% for a triple collision ) .",
    "the new helium content , y , of the collision product is the total helium mass of the parent stars divided by the total mass of the collision product .",
    "the stars were then evolved from the zero age main sequence up the giant branch .",
    "a more realistic set of evolutionary tracks can be created by using the results of smoothed particle hydrodynamics ( sph ) simulations of stellar collisions as starting models for stellar evolution calculations .",
    "this process is described in detail in sills _",
    "the tracks presented in that work ( and in sandquist _ et  al . _",
    "1997 ) resulted from sph simulations of head - on collisions between parent stars which were assumed to be polytropes .",
    "however , polytropes are not reasonable approximations to evolved main sequence stars . instead",
    ", stellar models taken from evolutionary codes should be used as the initial conditions for sph simulations ( sills & lombardi 1997 ) .",
    "therefore , rather than redoing the sph simulations , we used an interesting feature of the sph algorithm to determine the structure of the collision products without actually performing the sph simulations .",
    "the results of the sph simulations can be predicted by sorting the fluid from the parent stars in order of increasing entropy .",
    "we wish to reproduce as exactly as possible the stellar collision products as calculated by the smoothed particle hydrodynamics code . in order to accomplish this ,",
    "we need to understand what the sph code does , so that we can mimic it .",
    "a stellar collision calculation has reached hydrodynamic stability and is terminated when the ledoux criterion is satisfied .",
    "this criterion can be written @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is directly related to the entropy of the gas .",
    "the quantity @xmath31 can only be changed by shock heating .",
    "therefore , in the absence of shocks , the collision product is determined by ordering the particles of the two parent stars in order of increasing @xmath31 . in globular clusters ,",
    "the collisions between two stars are quite slow , and most of the shock heating is limited to the outermost few percent of the two stars .",
    "the interior structure of the collision product is not affected .",
    "the stability criterion is only valid for non - rotating collision products , so we are limited to the head - on collisions if we use this method .",
    "figure 1 shows the profiles of @xmath31 and @xmath32 vs. mass fraction for a collision product calculated using the sph code of lombardi _ et al . _",
    "( 1996 ) , and the profiles determined by the algorithm given above for a head - on collision between a @xmath33 star and a @xmath34 star .",
    "the stars are assumed to be ideal gases , with @xmath35 .",
    "after determining the @xmath31 vs. mass and @xmath32 vs. mass profiles , we then create a stellar model from those profiles as described in sills _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1997 ) .",
    "the final approximation necessary to make this product more closely resemble the results of the sph calculations is to reduce the star s total mass by 5% , since the collision does not result in all the mass being bound to the merger remnant .",
    "this mass is removed by reducing the mass in each shell .",
    "as can been seen in figure 2 , this procedure works well for a collision between a @xmath33 star and a @xmath36 star .",
    "the solid line is the track which results if we use our algorithm for mimicking the sph calculation to create a starting model for yrec .",
    "since we neglected shock heating , this star has not increased its energy content as much and begins its life much closer to the main sequence . however , the chemical profile is quite similar to that of the sph collision product , and so the evolution of the star follows the same path through the hr diagram after thermal equilibrium is reached .",
    "the thermal relaxation phase of evolution is quite short ( about @xmath37 years in this case ) and the timescales of the two tracks are essentially the same from the ` zero - age ' main sequence as well , indicating that we can effectively determine the future evolution of collision products simply by knowing the pressure , density and chemical profiles of the parent stars .    from the evolutionary tracks , we can determine @xmath38 , the time spent in each box in the hr diagram for a particular collision product .",
    "this time is combined with the flux and cross section to determine that collision s contribution to the number of blue stragglers at each position in the hr diagram .",
    "it has been standard practice to convert theoretical evolutionary tracks to ground - based ubvri magnitudes in order to more easily compare theory and observation . since globular clusters are so dense and therefore so crowded",
    ", it is often necessary to use the hubble space telescope to observe the cores of clusters .",
    "if we wish to compare our theoretical predictions with hst observations , we must convert our evolutionary tracks into hst system magnitudes .",
    "we calculated a transformation table with colours as a function of temperature , gravity and metallicity for the hst filters most like the johnson ground - based ubvri system , with one addition ( f255w , f336w , f439w , f555w , f675w , f814w ) .",
    "this table was calculated from kurucz atmospheres , using a similar technique to the one yi _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1995 ) used for the foc ultraviolet filters , and is available by request from the authors .",
    "to explore the effects of different input assumptions regarding the binary star population , we assumed a set of values for the velocity dispersion and central density of a ` standard ' globular cluster .",
    "we assumed a velocity dispersion of 10 km / s , which is a typical value for globular clusters .",
    "we assumed the density in the core to be @xmath39 stars / pc@xmath40 , or or about @xmath41/pc@xmath40 , an appropriate value for a reasonably dense cluster core prior to core collapse .",
    "we calculated cross sections for collisions between single stars using equation 2 .",
    "we used the program based on starlab to calculate cross sections for collisions between binary and single stars .",
    "for this program , we assumed a relative velocity of 10 km / s , and a flat mass function ( @xmath42 ) in order to evenly sample the mass ranges for both the binary and single stars .",
    "we then weighted the results appropriately to determine the results for other mass functions .",
    "our upper and lower mass limits were @xmath36 and @xmath33 respectively .",
    "we calculated cross sections for semi - major axes from 0.01 au to 30 au .",
    "the lower limit corresponds to stars which are not quite in contact , and the upper limit is approximately the maximum separation of a hard binary system ( one with a binding energy greater than the local stellar thermal energy ) .",
    "binaries with larger semi - major axes are soft binary systems , and are destroyed in globular clusters within a short time",
    ". we assumed a thermal eccentricity distribution ( @xmath43 ) for the binary systems , except for the close systems .",
    "binary systems with semi - major axes less than 0.1 a.u . were assumed to be circular , due to tidal circularization ( mathieu & mazeh 1988 ) .",
    "as described in section 2.2 , we use a number of different mass functions in this work .",
    "we therefore adopt a variety of exponents for the current distribution of stars and binary systems , ranging from salpeter ( @xmath17 ) to @xmath44 , which is strongly weighted towards massive stars .",
    "the binary fraction in globular clusters is not well known .",
    "therefore , we have considered the entire range of binary fractions , from 0 to 100% .",
    "if we assume a flat period distribution in @xmath45 for the binary stars , as suggested by yan & mateo ( 1994 ) for m71 , the probability of choosing a particular binary period @xmath46 within @xmath47 is @xmath48 .",
    "we have chosen our maximum and minimum periods to be @xmath49 and @xmath50 seconds respectively , which roughly correspond to the maximum and minimum semi - major axes used to determine the cross sections .",
    "the other option we have explored is the duquennoy & mayor ( 1991 ) period distribution for g dwarfs in the solar neighbourhood , which is weighted towards longer period distributions . to explore the efferent effects of long and short period binaries , we have also considered two artificial period distributions , which are flat in @xmath45 but have either a high or low period cutoff at @xmath51 seconds .",
    "after the collisions have occurred , the stars evolve .",
    "as described above , we have two sets of evolutionary tracks to choose from : fully mixed , and ` sph ' tracks .",
    "the fully mixed tracks provide an upper limit on the amount of mixing which can occur during the formation of the blue stragglers .",
    "table 1 gives a list of parameter combinations for which we have calculated blue straggler distributions , as well as the total number of blue stragglers predicted to exist in the region of interest .",
    "the resulting distributions of blue stragglers in the colour - magnitude diagram are shown in figures 3 through 7 . since the data are presented in the somewhat unfamiliar hst ultraviolet filters , figure 3",
    "presents the landmarks necessary to interpret the following figures .",
    "we have plotted the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) for m3 , as well as an evolutionary track of a turnoff mass star . the fiducial sequence of the cluster follows this evolutionary track quite well , and all blue stragglers should lie between the zams and the evolutionary track , brighter than the turnoff .",
    "the crosses are the data points from ferraro _",
    "et  al . _",
    "the large box surrounding those data points is the region shown in the following plots , and the small box to the lower right is 0.16 magnitudes on a side , which shows the resolution of the theoretical contours .    in figures 4 through 7 , the grey scale gives the relative density of blue stragglers at each position in the colour - magnitude diagram , with 5 density intervals at levels of 1 , 5 , 10 , 50 , and 100 stars per box 0.16 magnitudes on a side .",
    "these subsequent figures demonstrate the effects of the different parameters on the shape of the distributions and on the total number of blue stragglers produced , as discussed in the following section .      the overall shape of the distribution is most sensitive to the choice of evolutionary tracks .",
    "the blue stragglers which were fully mixed by the collision produce a distribution which remains quite close to the zams , since all stars begin their life on the zams .",
    "the distribution also reaches to brighter stars , because these stars have higher helium content than normal for stars in the cluster .",
    "the helium which was created in the cores of the collision parents has been spread throughout the star , creating a collision product which is bluer and brighter than might otherwise be expected .",
    "the results of the sph simulations produce distributions which are more spread out in colour than the fully mixed distributions , and does not extend to the high brightness of the mixed models .",
    "the distributions which result from these two kinds of evolutionary tracks are displayed in figure 4 , and compared again in figure 5 .",
    "the binary fraction determines how many binary star systems are available for collision .",
    "if the binary fraction is higher , more collisions will occur , increasing the total number of blue stragglers .",
    "figure 5 compares distributions for binary fractions of 0% , 20% and 100% . for this figure ,",
    "the distributions have been normalized to 100 blue stragglers each to emphasize the change in shape rather than the change in total number of blue stragglers .",
    "the total numbers produced are recorded in table 1 . while the total number of blue stragglers increases dramatically as the binary fraction increases , the underlying shape of the distribution does not change noticeably once the binary faction rises above zero .",
    "since the cross section for collision for binary stars is so much larger than that between single stars , the binary - single contributions quickly overpower the contribution of the single - single collisions .",
    "the period distribution of the binary systems affects the kinds of collisions that occur . if there are more short - period systems , triple collisions are more likely and we would expect to see more massive blue stragglers than low mass objects .",
    "figure 6 shows blue straggler distributions calculated using a period distribution which is flat in @xmath45 , the duquennoy & mayor ( dm ) period distribution , and two flat period distributions which have been artificially restricted to @xmath52 and @xmath53 for periods in seconds .",
    "these distributions have not been normalized and represent the actual number of stars created in each case .",
    "the overall differences in shape between the flat period distribution and the dm period distribution are quite small .",
    "the major difference between the two distributions of blue stragglers is that the dm period distribution produces more total blue stragglers than the flat distribution .",
    "the longer - period binary systems are more likely to interact with a passing single star , and so the cross sections for interaction are larger , increasing the contribution to the total distribution .",
    "the same effect is seen more clearly by comparing the two distributions with the high and low period cutoffs . the shape of the distribution , when normalized , is almost the same , but the long period group produces many more blue stragglers .",
    "the masses of these binary systems are not constrained by choosing a particular period distribution , and so the shape of the distributions does not change significantly .    as described in section 2.2",
    ", there are two mass functions which describe the populations involved in the collisions , namely the current mass function in the core , and the mass function from which the binary components are drawn .",
    "the nine distributions in figure 7 present the results of some possible combinations of these two mass functions .",
    "these distributions have been normalized to 100 total stars .",
    "the exponent of the current mass function decreases from 1.35 to -2 from left to right , and the exponent of the binary mass function decreases from 1.35 to -2 from top to bottom .",
    "mass functions with negative exponents are weighted towards massive stars . as expected , the greater the fraction of massive stars , the brighter the distribution becomes .",
    "this is true as either of the mass functions is changed , but the mass function of the binary components causes more change in the shape of the distribution than the current mass function .",
    "this suggests that the distribution of stars in the binary systems is more important than the population of the single stars in determining the total number and distribution of blue stragglers in the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "we have used a kolmogorov - smirnoff ( ks ) test in two dimensions using the algorithm given by press _",
    "et  al . _",
    "1992 to quantify the differences between the theoretical blue straggler distributions .",
    "this test is similar to the one dimensional ks test in that it gives the probability that the two distributions are drawn from the same distribution .",
    "while the two - dimensional test is not as robust as the one - dimensional test , it can indicate if two distributions are significantly different from each other .",
    "we compared a number of different distributions to our ` standard ' distribution , case j. this model uses the sph tracks and has a binary fraction of 20% , a flat binary period distribution , a current mass function with x=-2 , and a binary component mass function of x=1.35 .",
    "the ks statistic @xmath54 and the probability that the two distributions are drawn from the same underlying distribution are presented in table 2 .",
    "the total number of points in each distribution is given by the model predictions , and therefore the ks statistics are relevant for comparisons between two theoretical clusters .",
    "these statistics support the previous claims that the evolutionary tracks and binary mass function are more important to the overall shape of the theoretical distributions than the period distribution and current mass function , given the predicted total number of blue stragglers .",
    "as a specific example , we have modeled the distribution of blue stragglers in the globular cluster m3 . m3 is interesting for a number of reasons .",
    "it has the largest sample of blue stragglers of any globular cluster , which means that it is possible to discuss distributions of blue stragglers with some statistical significance .",
    "m3 also has a very odd radial distribution of blue stragglers which has not yet been seen in any other cluster , possibly because of small number statistics . rather than being spread evenly throughout the cluster or simply centrally concentrated , the blue stragglers appear to be concentrated in the core of the cluster , and in its outskirts , with a deficit of blue stragglers between 100 and 200 arc seconds from the cluster centre ( ferraro _ et  al . _  1993 ,",
    "et  al . _",
    "this may suggest two different blue straggler creation mechanisms at work .",
    "bailyn & pinsonneault ( 1995 ) suggested blue stragglers in the core of m3 are created by stellar collisions , and those in the sparser outer regions of the cluster are created by the merger of a binary system . on the other hand , sigurdsson _",
    "( 1994 ) suggest that all the blue stragglers in m3 are created by stellar collisions mediated by binary stars , and the outer blue stragglers were kicked out of the centre of the cluster by the recoil of the collision . in either case , the central blue stragglers in m3 are expected to have been created by stellar collisions .    in order to compare our theoretical results with observational data",
    ", we require data with a number of qualities . the data must be complete , both in magnitude and in position in the cluster .",
    "if the data are complete , we can be sure that their distribution is the distribution we must reproduce , and we can be sure that the total numbers of blue stragglers is accurate . we also need a large sample of blue stragglers so that any comparison between data and theory can be studied in a statistical sense , and we are not limited by small numbers .",
    "observations in the cluster m3 come closest to satisfying these criteria of any currently available data set .",
    "many groups ( e.g. ferraro _ et  al . _  1993 ,",
    "et  al . _",
    "1993 ) have observed blue stragglers outside the core of m3 , and many of those data sets have good photometry and are complete .",
    "we have chosen to restrict our investigation to the core of the cluster since that is the region in which we expect stellar collisions to dominate the blue straggler population .",
    "since we are assuming that all blue stragglers are created through stellar collisions , we wish to restrict ourselves to a dense environment where this approximation is more appropriate .",
    "we use the hst photometry of ferraro _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1997 ) of the core of m3 as the data to which we compare our theoretical distributions .",
    "these observations cover the core of the cluster , and were taken in hst ultraviolet filters specifically to study the hot stars ( including the blue stragglers ) in the cluster .",
    "this data set is reported to be complete down to @xmath55 for the entire area of the cluster covered , which includes the core .",
    "there are 72 blue stragglers in the inner 100  of the cluster with @xmath56 brighter than 19 in this sample .",
    "the photometric errors in this data are fairly large , on the order of 0.15 magnitudes in both colour and magnitude at the main sequence turnoff .",
    "the two distributions which used different evolutionary tracks ( shown in figure 4 ) have widths which are different in a statistically significant way .",
    "to demonstrate this , we took the average distance from the zams line in magnitude bins of size 0.2 mag from m=3.9 to m=1.3 .",
    "we then performed a two - sided kolmogorov - smirnoff ( ks ) test which determines if the two distributions were drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "we determined that the two distributions were drawn from the same distributions with a probability of 0.01% .",
    "we then compared each theoretical distribution to the observational data in the same way .",
    "if all data points are included in the ks test , the sph tracks have a 3.7% chance of being drawn from the same distribution as the observational data , and the fully mixed tracks have a 26% chance of being drawn from the same distribution .",
    "neither of these results are conclusive , but the indication is that the fully mixed tracks better represent the data . however ,",
    "if we exclude the three brightest stars from the data set and study the region from m=3.9 to m=2.1 , we get significantly different results .",
    "now , the sph tracks have a 67% probability of being drawn from the same distribution , and the fully mixed tracks have a 3% chance .",
    "this result is only valid at the 1-@xmath57 level , but it is strongly indicative that the fainter portion of the data is better modeled with the sph tracks , and the brightest three blue stragglers in m3 may be different from the rest of the population .",
    "we also created luminosity functions of our theoretical distributions by binning our distributions , and similarly we created temperature functions .",
    "these one - dimensional distributions can be compared to the data using a ks test .",
    "the data was binned in bins of 0.2 mag in luminosity , and 0.1 mag in temperature and then compared to the theory .",
    "the ks statistic @xmath54 and the related probability that the data is well - matched by the theory are given in columns 2 through 5 of table 2 .",
    "in general , ks tests only distinguish between distributions which are not drawn from the same underlying distribution .",
    "therefore , any distribution which has a probability of being the same as the observational distribution within about 50% is considered to be a good match to the observations .",
    "many of the theoretical distributions have ks probabilities which are greater than 50% for the luminosity function , the temperature function , or both .",
    "however , we can see that many of the distributions which have decent ks statistics for either the luminosity function or the temperature function do not fit the data well .",
    "therefore , we conclude that it is necessary to compare both axes of the colour - magnitude diagram simultaneously , rather than simply considering the luminosity function ( bailyn & pinsonneault 1995 ) or the distance from the zams ( ouellette & pritchet 1996 ) alone .",
    "to demonstrate the need for photometry with small observational errors , we have convolved one distribution ( case j ) with a gaussian of width 0.15 magnitudes in both magnitude and colour .",
    "the observational errors on the ferraro _",
    "et  al . _  ( 1997 ) data set are quoted to be about 0.15 magnitudes at the turnoff . as can be seen in figure 8 ,",
    "errors of this size mask any structure in the theoretical distributions , and only general statements about height and width can be made .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that even when the observational errors are taken into account , the brightest three blue stragglers in m3 are not modeled by the distribution .",
    "this result is even more striking when we consider that these bright blue stragglers are at least 3 magnitudes brighter than the cluster turnoff , and therefore we expect that the photometric errors on these stars are much smaller than 0.15 magnitudes ( as is demonstrated by the lack of scatter in the horizontal branch in the same data set ) .",
    "if such small observational errors are assumed , the probability that any of our theoretical distributions can fit the observed stars , including the brightest three , is greatly reduced .",
    "in order to study one component of the interaction of stellar dynamics with stellar evolution , we have made a number of simplifying assumptions about the cluster dynamics and populations .",
    "we attempted to make these assumptions as reasonable as possible while still retaining a tractable problem . in this section",
    "we attempt to characterize the effects of the assumptions on our conclusions .",
    "the first of the simplifying assumptions we have made is that the density in the region of interest is constant .",
    "this is clearly not the case in real globular clusters",
    ". the density decreases by a factor of @xmath58 between the centre and the edge of the core in a king model . by assuming that the core has a density equal to the central density",
    ", we have overpredicted the number of blue stragglers .",
    "we have also assumed that all populations have the same density at the same position .",
    "because of mass segregation , massive objects will be more centrally concentrated , so the relative number density of objects will vary radially .",
    "we expect that collisions involving binary stars will happen more frequently closer to the centre of the cluster , and that collisions involving more massive stars will happen closer to the centre .",
    "therefore , the shapes of the predicted distributions will vary with radius in the cluster .",
    "we have also assumed that the primary and secondary of each binary system was drawn at random from an initial mass function .",
    "therefore , the mass function of the secondaries is independent of the primary mass function .",
    "observational ( abt 1990 ) and theoretical ( kroupa 1995 ) evidence suggests that stars which form in aggregates of binary systems with flat period distributions and component masses paired at random will evolve dynamically to the field population seen today .",
    "therefore , our assumption of randomly paired masses is appropriate for a young cluster , but we have neglected dynamical modification of the binary mass ratios . during encounters involving binary stars , higher mass secondaries are preferentially swapped into the binary systems ( heggie 1975 , hut & bahcall 1983 , sigurdsson & phinney 1995 ) . therefore ,",
    "as the cluster evolves , the binary population will evolve towards higher mass ratios .",
    "the collisions involving these new binary stars will be more likely to produce more massive collision products , and therefore the distribution of the blue stragglers in the colour magnitude diagram will include more bright blue stragglers .    since this paper concentrates on a method rather than detailed comparison with observations , we chose cluster parameters which are typical for globular clusters rather than trying to model m3 in particular .",
    "for example , we have used a velocity dispersion of 10 km / s in the core of the cluster .",
    "observations ( gunn & griffin 1979 ) suggest that a value of 6 km / s may be more realistic as a global velocity dispersion in m3 .",
    "the velocity dispersion of the cluster influences the distributions in two ways : it helps determine the flux of stars , and it affects the cross sections for collisions involving binary stars .",
    "the flux of stars is essentially a density multiplied by the velocity dispersion .",
    "since we have assumed a uniform velocity dispersion for the entire region of interest , the velocity dispersion is simply a constant factor which determines the total number of blue stragglers . as the velocity increases ,",
    "more stars pass through a given point each second , and more collisions occur .",
    "the dependence of the cross sections on the velocity dispersion is rather more complicated . in general , if the velocity of the stars decreases , the cross section for each collision goes up since the stars are more likely to interact gravitationally if they do not fly past each other quickly .",
    "the nature of the collision can also change as the velocity of the stars changes , since the orbits of the stars around each other are determined by the stars initial velocities . neglecting the effect of the velocity dispersion on the cross sections , a value for @xmath59 of 6 km / s instead of 10 km / s will reduce our total number of blue stragglers , bringing our predictions closer to the observed number of bright blue stragglers in the central 100  of m3 .",
    "since the velocity dispersion in the core of m3 is about 6 km / s , binaries with longer periods can exist in m3 than in the theoretical cluster with a larger velocity dispersion .",
    "the cutoff between hard and soft binaries occurs at longer periods as the velocity dispersion decreases .",
    "soft binaries are disrupted early in the life of the cluster .",
    "therefore , the theoretical distributions in this paper have included too little contribution from long period binaries than is applicable for m3 . as is demonstrated in figure 6 ,",
    "if we add long period binaries to the distribution , the total number of stars is increased , but the overall shape of the distribution is not greatly affected .",
    "we have also assumed that a single number , the velocity dispersion , is sufficient to model the velocity distribution of stars in the cluster .",
    "however , all stars are not moving with the same velocity , but will have a nearly maxwellian velocity distribution which is characterized by the velocity dispersion .",
    "therefore , we expect that each quantity which is affected by the stellar velocity will have a range of values .",
    "the flux of stars will follow a maxwellian , and the cross section for each collision will be an appropriately weighted average of a range of cross sections .",
    "both these effects should result in smoothing of the theoretical blue straggler distributions .",
    "this smoothing effect should be small for most globular clusters since the velocity dispersion is fairly small .",
    "the metallicity of m3 is [ fe / h]=-1.57 ( harris & racine 1979 ) . the evolutionary tracks used in this work were more metal - rich , with a metallicity of [ fe / h]=-1.27 ( z=0.001 ) .",
    "therefore , all the evolutionary tracks are too red and a little too faint for m3 . however , since the data are not calibrated to a standard system , we simply shifted the evolutionary tracks by an amount which made the main sequence turnoff match the turnoff for an m=0.8 m@xmath60 star .",
    "since any differential shifts due to metallicity will be small , this change in metallicity will simply shift the distributions without changing their shape or the total number of predicted blue stragglers significantly .",
    "currently it is thought that two main mechanisms are responsible for creating blue stragglers : direct stellar collisions , and the merger of the two components of a binary system ( stryker 1993 ) . in this work ,",
    "we have concentrated on the direct stellar collisions , but it is expected that both mechanisms occur in different environments , perhaps even in the same cluster .",
    "one piece of evidence for this has been the bimodal radial distribution of blue stragglers in m3 , and the different luminosity functions of the inner and the outer populations ( bailyn & pinsonneault 1995 , but see also sigurdsson _",
    "et  al . _",
    "the results of this paper suggest that two different mechanisms may be at work in the same region of the cluster .",
    "we have shown that our theoretical distributions have difficulty in simultaneously explain both the brightest blue stragglers , and the width of the total distribution in the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "it seems likely that the brightest three blue stragglers in the centre of m3 belong to a different population than the rest of the blue stragglers .",
    "the globular cluster ngc 6397 shows a similar population of bright , central blue stragglers which may be different from the rest of the blue stragglers in that cluster ( sills _ et  al . _",
    "1995 ) . in both clusters",
    ", our theoretical distributions can not explain both the bright and the faint populations of blue stragglers using a consistent set of assumptions .",
    "the possible second population in m3 is brighter than the other blue stragglers , and separated from the rest by a gap of about 0.5 magnitudes , and the stars in ngc 6397 have similar properties .",
    "it is also separated from the horizontal branch by about the same amount .",
    "it is unlikely that these stars are horizontal branch stars since the horizontal branch is well defined .",
    "therefore , we assume that these stars are blue stragglers .",
    "blue stragglers can be made bright in two ways : they can have a large mass , or they can have a high helium content .",
    "these blue stragglers could have a large mass because they are the result of a collision between three stars instead of between two .",
    "triple collisions are expected to occur between three independent stars ( a very low probability occurrence ) , or to occur during an encounter of a binary system with a single star , or during an encounter between two binary systems .",
    "we included the triple collisions which occurred during encounters between binary and single stars our theoretical distributions .",
    "the structure of the collision products was determined using the same algorithm as for the other ` sph ' tracks .",
    "the evolutionary tracks of some of these products do indeed pass through the region in the colour - magnitude diagram in which these three stars exist .",
    "however , the triple collisions included in these calculations do not contribute significantly to the total number of blue stragglers ( about 1% for case n ) .",
    "there are two reasons for this .",
    "first , the lifetimes of stars with masses of about @xmath61 are much shorter than stars of @xmath62 by a factor of about 3 .",
    "second , the cross sections for triple collisions are in general smaller than the cross sections for collisions between two stars .",
    "this cross section is small because triple collisions are difficult to cause when only three stars are involved since there is no other star available to carry away angular momentum from the system .",
    "the cross sections are also small because triple collisions occur preferentially with small binary systems , and the cross section is proportional to the binary semi - major axis .    in order to sustain the hypothesis that triple collisions are responsible for the bright population , we need a larger contribution of triple collisions to the blue straggler distributions .",
    "it seems likely that we can increase the cross sections for triple collisions by considering encounters between two binary systems .",
    "we have not included binary - binary interactions in this work since the cross sections for the different kinds of products are not yet easily calculated for a global population of binary stars , in the same way that binary - single collisional cross sections can be calculated , using starlab .",
    "binary - binary interactions should produce many more collision products for the same binary fraction , and the distribution of collision products could be quite different .",
    "it is not yet clear that the addition of binary - binary collisions can explain the bright population of blue stragglers while maintaining the correct total number of blue stragglers observed in clusters .",
    "analysis of the cross sections for binary - single and binary - binary encounters suggest that unless the binary fraction is quite low , too many collisions take place ( bacon _ et  al . _  1996 ) .    the second method for creating bright blue stragglers is to increase their helium content .",
    "blue stragglers can have a higher than expected helium content if the star is made of two ( or three ) stars which evolved significantly before the collision , and their central helium is mixed to the surface of the star .",
    "the most extreme amount of mixing allowed is represented by the fully mixed distributions presented in this work .",
    "we have shown that stars which are fully mixed do indeed become as bright and as blue as the three blue stragglers in question .",
    "we can even produce these stars with the collisions between two stars only , without having to invoke a third star , as long as the product is fully mixed .",
    "since blue stragglers are not fully mixed during the collision or during the subsequent evolution , another process must be at work if these stars are indeed fully or significantly mixed .",
    "one possible process is rotation of the stars .",
    "we have neglected the intrinsic rotation of the stellar collision products in this work because we have been dealing with head - on collisions only .",
    "however , when two stars collide in an off - axis collision , the resulting product can be rotating as fast as 70% of its break - up speed .",
    "stars which rotate quickly are subject to a number of instabilities which can cause mixing of material , including meridional circulation ( tassoul 1978 ) .",
    "detailed modeling of the evolution of these rotating collision products will be necessary to determine if these processes produce a significant amount of mixing , enough to affect the position of the stars in the colour - magnitude diagram ( although see ouellette & pritchet 1998 ) .",
    "any investigation of the evolution of rotating blue stragglers must also explain two seemingly incongruous facts : we expect that stars of all masses may undergo rotational mixing , suggesting a continuum of stellar properties , but yet the bright blue stragglers in both m3 and ngc 6397 are separated by a gap from the faint blue stragglers .",
    "it is also possible that the merger of the two components of a binary system can result in a star which is significantly mixed .",
    "this star should be rotating rapidly also , so rotational mixing could play a role .",
    "also , if the merger involves any sort of common envelope evolution , it is unclear whether the two cores of the stars remain intact during the spiral - in phase or whether some significant portion of the helium of these cores is mixed into the outer layer of the star .",
    "if some mixing does occur , this may be enough to push some stars into the region of the colour - magnitude diagram in question .",
    "more detailed models of the process of binary mergers is necessary before this question can be answered .",
    "the above discussion of the two possible populations of blue stragglers brings up a number of areas which still need to be explored : encounters between two binary systems , rotation of the non - head - on collision products , and binary mergers .",
    "we made a number of other assumptions about the cluster which should be relaxed in order to further understanding of the blue straggler phenomenon .",
    "first of all , we have assumed that the inner region of this cluster is a uniform box with the same density and velocity dispersion everywhere .",
    "this is obviously not the case in real clusters .",
    "we should use either a static ( king ) model or an evolving dynamical model of the cluster to predict the density and velocity dispersion as a function of radius , and apply those values to our calculations in such a way as to take into account the stratification of the cluster .",
    "we have neglected the evolution of the globular cluster in a number of respects .",
    "we have assumed that the parents of these stellar collision products are drawn from the current population of the cluster .",
    "we are choosing stars which have evolved for 15 gyr .",
    "however , collisions have happened throughout the lifetime of the cluster , and so some of the parents will have evolved for less time than we have assumed .",
    "collisions between stars with higher masses than the current turnoff mass will also have occurred .",
    "we have also neglected to include the effects of the collisions on the parent populations .",
    "for example , blue stragglers can themselves be involved in stellar collisions sometime after they were created .",
    "also , interactions involving binary stars can change the characteristics of the binary population . in order to model the populations of collision products in a globular cluster properly",
    ", we need to incorporate the detailed evolutionary tracks used in this work into an n - body dynamical code , and follow the stellar collisions in some monte - carlo fashion .",
    "investigations of globular cluster dynamics with stellar collisions has been begun by portegies zwart _ et  al . _  ( 1997a , b ) .",
    "they have included a simple prescription for normal stellar evolution in a detailed n - body dynamics code , and have attempted to model the evolution of a cluster in which stellar collisions occur .",
    "their treatment of the stellar evolution is relatively crude , consisting of a table of masses , radii and luminosities .",
    "we have shown that the mass of the stellar collision product alone is not enough to determine its evolutionary state , and hence its effect on the cluster s evolution .",
    "however , portegies zwart s treatment of the dynamics of the cluster is far more detailed than anything we have attempted .",
    "we are approaching the same problem from opposite directions , and our two approaches must eventually be combined .",
    "we should also expand this work to other globular clusters .",
    "this will allow us to explore the effects of cluster metallicity and age on the blue straggler population .",
    "we will also be able to make stronger statements about the effects of cluster densities and central concentrations on the populations in the cluster , and possibly comment on the primordial binary population of the cluster . in order to draw valid conclusions from theoretical predictions of a sample of clusters",
    ", we should have high quality data to which we can compare our models .",
    "these data should be photometrically complete down to the turnoff of the cluster ( or at least within a magnitude )",
    ". they should also be complete spatially , reaching into the core of the cluster since most of the collisions will occur in the core .",
    "for many clusters , particularly the dense ( and hence interesting ) ones , this will require the hubble space telescope since ground - based observations of the cores of globular clusters are limited by crowding effects . to be able to compare our theory with the data in a statistically significant way",
    ", we also need on the order of 100 or more blue stragglers in each cluster .",
    "as clusters are surveyed more carefully and as the surveys reach into the cores , it is becoming clear that m3 is not alone in its large population of blue stragglers ( e.g. 47 tuc ",
    "edmonds 1998 , m55  mandushev _ et  al . _",
    "we feel confident that in a few years , a sufficient data set will exist to provide detailed comparison for our models .",
    "we have described a method to model the distributions of blue stragglers in the colour - magnitude diagram of globular clusters . by combining the results of detailed stellar evolution models of blue stragglers with relatively crude information about the dynamics of the cluster",
    ", we can determine the total number of blue stragglers produced by stellar collisions , and their expected positions in the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "as an example , we have applied this method to the cluster m3 , which has a large population of blue stragglers .",
    "we assumed that the blue stragglers were created by stellar collisions , and we restricted our investigation to the inner 100  of the cluster .",
    "the distribution of blue stragglers in the colour - magnitude diagram and the total number produced by stellar collisions is determined by the current dynamical state and population of the cluster , as well as by the evolutionary paths of the blue stragglers themselves .",
    "we have explored the effects of a number of different parameters on the shape of the blue straggler distributions , and on the total number of blue stragglers .",
    "we found that the binary fraction is the strongest factor in determining the total number of blue stragglers in a cluster .",
    "the mass distribution of the components of the binary system is more important than the current stellar mass function in determining the shape of the blue straggler distribution .",
    "the blue straggler distribution is relatively insensitive to the period distribution of the binary stars in the cluster .",
    "we have also investigated the effect of the evolutionary history of the blue stragglers on their distribution in the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "our theoretical distributions of blue stragglers can not simultaneously reproduce the brightest and the reddest blue stragglers observed in m3 .",
    "we have determined that most of the blue stragglers in the core of m3 can be produced by stellar collisions which did not result in significant mixing of the stellar collision product .",
    "there may also be a second population of brighter blue stragglers , which may have undergone significant mixing during their creation .",
    "this population consists of the brightest blue stragglers in m3 , but may also contain fainter stars .    in order for stellar collisions to produce the number of blue stragglers observed in the inner regions of m3 , a population of binary stars must be present in the cluster .",
    "a binary fraction of 20% is sufficient to reproduce the observed numbers .",
    "the binary fraction and the masses of binary stars seem to be more important in determining the total numbers and distribution of blue stragglers than the population of single stars .",
    "small changes in the binary period distribution do not affect the distribution of blue stragglers significantly , but the total number of blue stragglers increases when the period distribution favours longer periods .    to fully model collisional blue stragglers ,",
    "this work can be and needs to be expanded in a number of directions .",
    "we need to combine rigorous stellar dynamics with our detailed evolution calculations .",
    "the theory pertaining to blue stragglers needs to become more detailed . and finally , more detailed and more complete observations are required .",
    "we have begun combining stellar evolution and stellar dynamics to model globular clusters , but there is still much left to do , both observationally and theoretically .",

    "<S> a primary production mechanism for blue stragglers in globular clusters is thought to be collisionally - induced mergers , perhaps mediated by dynamical encounters involving binary stars . </S>",
    "<S> we model the formation and evolution of such blue stragglers , and produce theoretical distributions of them in the colour - magnitude diagram . </S>",
    "<S> we use a crude representation of cluster dynamics and detailed binary - single star encounter simulations to produce cross sections and rates for a variety of collisions . </S>",
    "<S> the results of the collisions are determined based on sph simulations of realistic star models . </S>",
    "<S> the evolution of the collision products are then followed in detail using the yale stellar evolution code . </S>",
    "<S> we present our results in the form of distributions in the observed colour - magnitude diagram .    </S>",
    "<S> we use our results to explore the effects of a variety of input assumptions on the number and kind of blue stragglers created by collisions . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we describe the changes in the blue straggler distribution that result from using realistic collision products rather than the `` fully - mixed '' assumption , and from changes in assumptions about the number and orbital period distribution of the primordial binary population . </S>",
    "<S> we then apply our models to existing data from the core of m3 , where the large blue straggler population is thought to be dominated by collision products . </S>",
    "<S> we find that we have difficulty successfully modeling the observed blue stragglers under a single consistent set of assumptions . </S>",
    "<S> however , if 3 particularly bright blue stragglers are considered to be part of a different observed population ( as has been previously suggested for other clusters ) and left out of the population , the remainder can be successfully modeled using realistic encounter products and assuming a 20% binary fraction with plausible period distribution . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we suggest a variety of routes towards a more comprehensive understanding of the blue straggler phenomenon . </S>"
