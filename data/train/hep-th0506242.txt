    "in recent years there has been a debate on whether microscopic black holes can induce quantum decoherence at a microscopic level .",
    "the presence of quantum - fluctuating microscopic horizons , of radius of the order of planck length ( @xmath0 m ) , may give space - time a `` foamy '' structure , causing decoherence of matter propagating in it .",
    "in particular , it has been suggested  @xcite that such planck - scale black holes and other topological fluctuations in the space - time background cause a breakdown of the conventional s - matrix description of asymptotic scattering in local quantum field theory .",
    "this may lead to experimentally testable predictions , at least in principle , for instance as regards the so - called sensitive particle - physics probes of quantum mechanics  @xcite .",
    "it must be pointed out that this suggestion is invalidated if there is _ holography _ in quantum gravity  @xcite , such that any information of quantum numbers of matter , that at first sight appears to be lost into the horizon , is somehow reflected back on the horizon surface , thereby maintaining quantum coherence .",
    "this may happen , for instance , in some highly supersymmetric effective theories of strings @xcite , which however do not represent realistic low - energy theories of quantum gravity .",
    "supersymmetry breaking complicates the issue , spoiling complete holography .",
    "recently , s. hawking , inspired by the above recent ideas in string theory , has also argued against the loss of coherence in a _",
    "euclidean _ quantum theory of gravity .",
    "in such a model , summation over trivial and non - trivial ( black - hole ) space - time topologies in the path over histories makes an asymptotic observer `` unsure '' as to the existence of the microscopic black hole fluctuation thus resulting in no loss of quantum coherence .",
    "however , this sort of argument is plagued not only by the euclidean formalism , with its concomitant problems of analytic continuation , but also by a lack of a concrete rigorous proof , at least up to now .",
    "therefore , for our purposes we still consider the matter of quantum - gravity - induced decoherence as wide open and worthy of further phenomenological exploitation .",
    "this is the point of view we shall take in this work .",
    "we shall restrict ourselves to a specific framework for analyzing decoherent propagation of low - energy matter in foamy space - time backgrounds in the context of string theory  @xcite , the so - called liouville - string  @xcite decoherence  @xcite .",
    "our motivation for using string theory is that it appears at present to be the best controlled theory of quantum gravity available to date . in this respect",
    "we also mention that there are other interesting approaches to quantum space - time foam , which also lead to experimental predictions , for instance the `` thermal bath '' approach advocated in @xcite , according to which the foamy gravitational environment may behave as a thermal bath , inducing decoherence and diffusion in the propagating matter , as well as quantum damping in the evolution of low - energy observables , features which are , at least in principle , testable experimentally .",
    "as we shall see later on , similar behaviour is exhibited by the specific models of foam that we study here , which may characterize modern versions of string theory  @xcite , specifically the d - particle foam model of @xcite , based on point - like membrane defects in space time ( d - particles ) .    in the presence of decoherence the s - matrix of the effective low - energy field theory",
    "would then have to be replaced by a linear non - factorisable superscattering operator @xmath1 relating initial and final - state density matrices  @xcite @xmath2if this is correct then the usual formulation of quantum mechanics has to be modified .",
    "arguments have been put forward for this modification of the liouville equation to take the form  @xcite@xmath3 + \\not{\\delta}h\\rho .",
    "\\label{liouvqm}\\]]equations of this form are encountered in the description of the time evolution of the state of open quantum mechanical systems where @xmath4 has a lindblad form  @xcite . in such systems",
    "observable degrees of freedom are coupled to unobservable components which are effectively integrated over .",
    "initial pure states evolve into mixed ones and so @xmath5where @xmath6 . in these circumstances",
    "wald  @xcite has shown that cpt is violated , at least in its strong form , i.e. there is _ no _ unitary invertible operator @xmath7 such that @xmath8    such considerations have more recently again come to the fore because of current neutrino data including lsnd data  @xcite .",
    "there is experimental evidence , that the neutrino has mass which leads to neutrino oscillations .",
    "however lsnd results appear consistent with the dominance of anti - neutrino oscillations @xmath9 @xmath10 over neutrino oscillations .",
    "in particular , provided lsnd results turn out to be correct , which is unclear at present , there is evidence for cpt violation .",
    "it has been suggested recently  @xcite that planck scale quantum decoherence may be a relevant contribution to the cpt violation seen in the experiments of lsnd .",
    "other examples of flavour oscillating systems with quite different mass scales are furnished by @xmath11 and @xmath12 systems  @xcite .",
    "the former , because of the large masses involved , provides a particularly sensitive system for investigating the planck scale fluctuations embodied by space - time foam . in all these cases experiments , such as cplear  @xcite ,",
    "provide very low bounds on cpt violation which are not inconsistent with dimensional analysis estimates for the magnitudes of effects from space - time foam .",
    "these systems have been analyzed within a dynamical semigroup approach to quantum markov processes .",
    "once the framework has been accepted then a master equation for finite - dimensional systems ensued which can be characterized by a small set of parameters .",
    "this approach is somewhat phenomenological and is primarily used to fit data .",
    "consequently it is important to obtain a better understanding of the nature of decoherence from a more fundamental viewpoint .",
    "an additional , and perhaps more plausible  @xcite , reason for considering quantum decoherence models of quantum gravity , comes from recent astrophysical evidence on a current - era acceleration of our universe .",
    "indeed , observations of distant supernovae  @xcite , as well as wmap data  @xcite on the thermal fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) , indicate that our universe is at present in an accelerating phase , and that 73% of its energy - density budget consists of an unknown substance , termed _",
    "dark energy_. best - fit models of such data include einstein - friedman - robertson - walker universes with a non - zero cosmological _",
    "constant_. however , the data are also currently compatible with ( cosmic ) time - dependent vacuum - energy - density components , relaxing asymptotically to zero  @xcite . in colliding brane - world models",
    "the dark energy component of the universe is considered to be a non - equilibrium energy density of the ( observable ) brane world  gravanis , emw .",
    "this density is identified with the central charge surplus of the supercritical @xmath13-models describing the ( recoil ) string excitations of the brane after the collision.the relaxation of the dark - energy density component can be a purely stringy feature of the logarithmic conformal field theory  @xcite describing the d - brane recoil  @xcite in a ( perturbative ) @xmath13-model framework .",
    "we shall discuss below how the theory of _ non - critical _ strings deals with the twin problems of cosmological constant , and dark energy .",
    "it is worth pointing out that the non - critical ( liouville ) string  @xcite provides a rather unified formalism for dealing not only with universes with a non - zero cosmological constant in string theory , but in general with decoherent quantum space - time foam backgrounds , that include microscopic quantum - fluctuating black holes  @xcite .    _  _",
    "given the very limited understanding of gravity at the quantum level , the analysis of modifications of the quantum liouville equation implied by non - critical strings can only be approximate and should be regarded as circumstantial evidence in favour of the dissipative master equation . in the context of two - dimensional toy black holes@xcite and in the presence of singular space - time fluctuations there",
    "are believed to be inherently unobservable delocalised modes which fail to decouple from light ( i.e. the observed ) states .",
    "the effective theory of the light states which are measured by local scattering experiments can be described by a non - critical liouville string .",
    "this results in an irreversible temporal evolution in target space with decoherence and associated entropy production .    the following master equation for the evolution of stringy low - energy matter in a non - conformal @xmath13-model  can be derived@xcite @xmath14 + : \\beta ^{i}\\mathcal{g}_{ij}\\left [ g^{j},\\rho \\right ] :   \\label{master}\\]]where @xmath15 denotes time ( liouville zero mode )",

    "hence the summation over @xmath23 in ( [ master ] ) corresponds to a discrete summation as well as a covariant integration @xmath24  where @xmath25 denotes a set of @xmath26-dimensional target",
    "space - time co - ordinates and @xmath27 is the space - time dimensionality of the original non - critical string .",
    "the discovery of new solitonic structures in superstring theory  @xcite has dramatically changed the understanding of target space structure .",
    "these new non - perturbative objects are known as d - branes and their inclusion leads to a scattering picture of space - time fluctuations .",
    "the study of d - brane dynamics has been made possible by polchinski s realization  @xcite that such solitonic string backgrounds can be described in a conformally invariant way in terms of world sheets with boundaries . on these boundaries",
    "dirichlet boundary conditions for the collective target - space coordinates of the soliton are imposed .",
    "heuristically , when low energy matter given by a closed ( or open ) string propagating in a @xmath26-dimensional space - time collides with a very massive d - particle embedded in this space - time , the d - particle recoils as a result .",
    "since there are no rigid bodies in general relativity the recoil fluctuations of the brane and their effectively stochastic back - reaction on space - time can not be neglected .",
    "based on these considerations , a model for a supersymmetric space - time foam has been suggested in @xcite .",
    "the model is based on parallel brane worlds ( with three spatial large dimensions ) , moving in a bulk space time which contains a `` gas '' of d - particles .",
    "the number of parallel branes used is dictated by the requirements of target - space supersymmetry in the limit of zero - velocity branes .",
    "one of these branes represents allegedly our observable universe .",
    "as the brane moves in the bulk space , d - particles cross the brane in a random way . from the point of view of an observer in the brane",
    "the crossing d - particles will appear as space - time defects which flashing on and off , i.e. microscopic space - time fluctuations .",
    "this will give the four - dimensional brane world a `` d - foamy '' structure .",
    ", implies a back reaction onto the space time , which is described by a logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "the method allows for the perturbative calculation of the induced space - time distortion due to the entangled state in ( b).__,width=188 ]    closed and open strings propagate on the brane .",
    "each time these strings cross with a d - particle , there is a possibility of being attached to it , as indicated in fig .",
    "[ fig : dfoam ] .",
    "the entangled state causes a back reaction onto the space - time , which can be calculated perturbatively using the formalism of logarithmic conformal field theory  @xcite .",
    "details are reviewed in appendix b.    using this model for space - time fluctuations we will obtain an expression for the induced space - time distortion as a result of d - particle recoil .",
    "the set @xmath28 includes the graviton fields @xmath29 where @xmath30 and @xmath31 are target space - time indices and in the weakly coupled string limit we can show that : @xmath32where the suffix @xmath33 denotes temporal ( liouville ) components and @xmath34with @xmath35 the momentum of the propagating closed - string state before ( after ) the recoil ; @xmath36 are the spatial collective coordinates of the d particle and @xmath37 is identified with the target minkowski time @xmath15 for @xmath38 after the collision  @xcite ( see appendix b ) .",
    "these relations have been calculated for non - relativistic branes where @xmath39 is small and require the machinery of logarithmic conformal field theory .",
    "now for large @xmath40 to leading order ,    @xmath41    where @xmath42 , @xmath43 , is the momentum transfer during a collision and @xmath44 is the planck mass ( actually , to be more precise , @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the ( weak ) string coupling , and @xmath47 is a string mass scale ) ; so @xmath48 is constant in space - time but depends on the energy content of the low energy particle and @xmath49 . since we are interested in fluctuations of the metric the indices @xmath22 will correspond to the pair @xmath50 .",
    "however , as already mentioned in the introduction , recent astrophysical observations from different experiments all seem to indicate that @xmath51% of the energy of the universe is in the form of dark energy .",

    "the master equation which has been derived is of relevance to the study of general features of gravity induced decoherence.the above d - particle inspired approach deals with possible non - perturbative quantum effects of gravitational degrees of freedom .",
    "the analysis is totally unrelated to the phenomenology of dynamical semigroups which does not embody specific properties of gravity . indeed",
    "the phenomenology is sufficiently generic that other mechanisms of decoherence such as the msw effect can be incorporated within the same framework .",
    "consequently an analysis which is less generic and is related to the specific  decoherence implied by non - critical strings is necessary .",
    "it is sufficient to study a massive non - relativistic particle propagating in one dimension to establish qualitative features of d - particle decoherence . the environment will be taken to consist of both gravitational and non - gravitational degrees of freedom ; hence we will consider a generalisation of quantum brownian motion for a particle which has additional interactions with d - particles .",
    "this will allow us to compare qualitatively the decoherence due to different environments.the non - gravitational degrees of freedom in the environment ( in a thermal state ) are conventionally modelled by a collection of harmonic oscillators with masses @xmath63 , frequency @xmath64 and co - ordinate operator @xmath65 coupled to the particle co - ordinate @xmath66 by an interaction of the form @xmath67 .",
    "the master equation which is derived can have time dependent coefficients due to the competing timescales , e.g. relaxation rate due to coupling to the thermal bath , the ratio of the time scale of the harmonic oscillator to the thermal time scale etc . however",

    "arguments , for example , arising from quintessence  quintess and cosmon scalar fields lead to a behaviour which is compatible with ( [ cosmological ] ) .",

    "although our simplified model for flavour oscillations , using a non - relativistic bosonic two - level system , is too simplified for realistic phenomenology of ( neutrino ) flavour oscillations , nevertheless we believe that it captures the basic features induced by liouville - decoherence , which are expected to persist in the relativistic neutrino case .",

    "this will be important only when we embark on a detailed phenomenology , by looking at specific experiments , in which case complications involving wave packets and the joint presence of the above effects must be incorporated .",
    "one should also take into account that the neutrino is a highly relativistic system , with a very small mass , in contrast to our non - relativistic bosonic system examined in this section for simplicity .",
    "one expects , therefore , that when we consider in our approach relativistic systems , with sharp energy , a similar form for the oscillatory term as in ( [ neutrino ] ) will be obtained .",
    "qualitatively , however , in both ( [ flavourprob ] ) and ( [ neutrino ] ) , the main reason for oscillations is the conventional mass difference between the mass eigenstates , which agrees with the present phenomenology .",
    "the exponential damping ( with time or oscillation length ) induced by the decoherence term is only present in our case in the case of a cosmological constant .",
    "the generic d - foam effects are time dependent in the way indicated in ( [ arctan2 ] ) , which does not introduce exponential damping .",
    "the important feature , however , is the quadratic momentum dependence @xmath171 of the exponent of these `` damping '' terms , which persists in the relativistic case , since it originates from the specific @xmath172 $ ] diffusion term of the master equation ( [ master5 ] ) , as well as their dependence on the specific characteristics of the foam , such as the dispersion @xmath173 ( random ) for the momentum transfer during the interaction of the particle probe with the foam .",
    "experimentally , therefore , one should be able to bound this dispersion by comparing the oscillation probability ( [ flavourprob ] ) as a function of the oscillation length ( time ) with the corresponding experimental curve .",
    "currently there are stringent limits from neutrino physics on quantum decoherence terms  @xcite , and one can envisage that such bounds provide important restrictions on our d - particle foam characteristic dispersion @xmath173 , when the model is applied to relativistic neutrino beams .",
    "we postpone a detailed phenomenological analysis of our effects for a future publication , due to the complications mentioned above .",
    "it is also worth noticing at this stage that damping factors , which resemble those due to decoherence , can arise simply  @xcite by conventional uncertainties in the energy ( or momentum , depending of the formalism adopted ) of the neutrino beam .",
    "if @xmath174 denotes the corresponding dispersion , then , for the two - flavour oscillation problem one finds : @xmath175the reader is invited to compare ( [ gaussian ] ) with ( [ flavourprob ] ) and ( [ neutrino ] ) .",
    "we note that by writing  @xcite : @xmath176 , with @xmath177 ( ignoring , as negligible , uncertainties in oscillation lengths ) , then one may rewrite ( [ gaussian ] ) in a decoherence form ( [ neutrino ] ) with the decoherence coefficient @xmath178 . for atmospheric neutrinos , this yields the bound @xmath179  gev , assuming @xmath180 .",
    "similar bounds can be obtained for the d - foam decoherence damping factor ( [ flavourprob ] ) , which notably is independent of the mass difference .",
    "indeed , one can also formally rewrite the damping factor in ( [ flavourprob ] ) as a decoherence ( [ neutrino ] ) term , with @xmath181 , with @xmath169 . however , for reasons explained above this formula is not quite precise , and for quantitative comparison one should repeat the analysis with relativistic neutrino systems , in the sharp energy formalism .",
    "this is left for future work .    finally , before closing this section we would like to compare our result ( [ flavourprob ] ) with the energy - driven lindblad decoherence models for two - flavour oscillations considered in @xcite .",
    "in the latter case , the pertinent master equation for the density matrix of matter propagating in a self - adjoint lindblad environment , spanned by operators @xmath182 , with @xmath183 = 0 $ ] , reads ( in units @xmath184 ) : @xmath185 - \\sum_n [ d_n , [ d_n , \\rho]]~. \\label{adler1}\\ ] ] when specialized to a two - level system , adler  @xcite asserts that the only possible choices that commute with @xmath16 are @xmath186 , with @xmath187 the identity operator , and @xmath188 , with @xmath189 appropriate constants . in the relativistic massive neutrino case , with fixed energy @xmath190 for the neutrino beam , @xmath191 , from which , by projecting onto mass eigenstates , and concentrating on the non - diagonal density - matrix elements , eq .",
    "( [ adler1 ] ) yields the following leading - order estimate for the decoherence coefficient @xmath192  @xcite : @xmath193 where @xmath194 is a characteristic quantum gravity scale . in the non - relativistic case at hand , from the rest - mass terms in the expansion of the hamiltonian @xmath195 , we obtain the following estimate for the decoherence term @xmath196",
    ". these estimates are much more suppressed.than the estimates of @xmath197 , who allowed for the decoherence coefficients ( in the relativistic case ) to be of order @xmath198 , with @xmath190 a fixed neutrino energy .",
    "we now note that this latter , quadratic in energy , dependence of the decoherence coefficient appears to be the case of our liouville decoherence , and owes its form to the peculiar ( quadratic ) momentum dependence of the liouville environmental decoherening entanglement term of the master equation ( [ master5 ] ) .",
    "the form of this term is independent of the relativistic or non - relativistic nature of the hamiltonian @xmath16 , whilst the form of ( [ adler1]),([adler2 ] ) depends crucially on the form of the hamiltonian @xmath16 .    in the liouville decoherence case of the d - particle foam , examined in the present work , the lindblads , given by @xmath199 ( c.f .",
    "( [ trnsf ] ) ) , although self - adjoint and commuting with the hamiltonian of the non - relativistic system , nevertheless are _ not _ proportional to it .",
    "this is due to the fact that the lindblad operators in this case are proportional to the metric tensor ( [ master3 ] ) , as a result of the underlying general coordinate invariance of the liouville - string system , which is not taken into account in the simple quantum mechanical case of @xcite .",
    "this leads to an entirely different energy ( momentum ) dependence ( @xmath200 ) of the decoherence coefficient in the liouville case , as we have seen above . with these comments",
    "we conclude our phenomenological analysis on liouville decoherence .",
    "in this work we have examined phenomenological consequences of a decoherence master equation describing the propagation of low - energy string matter in a space - time foam background .",
    "the basic machinery was the liouville - string approach to decoherence .",
    "we have restricted ourselves in a specific model for the space time foam , involving the interaction of strings with space - time d - particle defects .",
    "we have seen that the pertinent master equation exhibits diffusion terms and decoherence , but that there is not always exponential damping .",
    "the reason is the time dependence of some of the decoherence terms .",
    "the liouville decoherence involves a term which is quadratic in the momentum transfer encountered during the interaction of the particle probe with the space - time defect . by considering a specific model of random foam , characterized by the dispersion of such a momentum transfer",
    ", we have been able to solve the pertinent decoherence equation rather simply , and give the form of the corresponding probability for the oscillation from one flavour to another , in a toy non - relativistic bosonic model of two flavour oscillations .",
    "our formalism also allows for the consideration of possible decoherence effects arising from dark energy contributions in the space time .",
    "such effects have also been taken into account in the expression for the final oscillation probability    although the model is not strictly appropriate for neutrino physics , nevertheless it exhibits the basic properties of liouville decoherence that one expects to persist in the fully relativistic neutrino case .",
    "the basic feature is a damping looking factor @xmath201 , in front of the conventional oscillation terms that are due to the mass difference of the pertinent mass eigenstates .",
    "the damping factor depends on the characteristics of the foam , but leads to exponential damping ( with the time @xmath15 ) only in case there is a cosmological _ constant _ term in space time .",
    "the simplified analysis presented in the current article demonstrates that generic phenomenological analyses , based on constant decoherence coefficients , might be misleading , yielding sometimes incorrect bounds of the relevant space - time foam effects .",
    "one should resort , whenever possible , to rather detailed microscopic models of space - time foam , as we have done here , before embarking on detailed phenomenological analyses .",
    "one should also be careful to disentangle conventional matter effects , or effects related simply to uncertainties in the energy or oscillation lengths , before concluding on the possible rle of fundamental physics effects in particle processes , such as flavour oscillation .",
    "we hope to return to a detailed phenomenological analysis of d - particle foam effects in neutrinos and other particle probes , taking into account of the appropriate spin structures as well , in a future publication .",

    "<S> we pay particular attention to contrasting the decoherent role of a cosmological constant in inducing exponential quantum damping in the evolution of low - energy observables , such as the probability of flavour oscillations , with the situation where the dark energy relaxes to zero for asymptotically large times , in which case such a damping is absent . </S>",
