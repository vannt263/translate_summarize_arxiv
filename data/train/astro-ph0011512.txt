    "ethanol ( 2h5oh ) was first detected by @xcite towards the massive star forming region in the galactic center ( gc ) sgr b2 .",
    "subsequent observations of this molecule in the interstellar medium have shown that 2h5oh is only present in the dense ( 3 ) and hot ( 100k ) cores associated with newly formed massive stars @xcite .",
    "in hot cores , the abundance of 2h5oh in gas - phase ranges from to , and gas - phase chemistry can not account even for the lowest fractional abundance of this molecule . therefore , 2h5oh emission is considered one of the best tracers of dust chemistry @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the transient nature of the alcohol chemistry in molecular clouds , makes the abundance of 2h5oh an excellent clock to estimate when this molecule was injected to the gas - phase @xcite .",
    "the gc molecular clouds show high kinetic temperatures ( 80 k ) @xcite and widespread large abundance of refractory molecules like sio @xcite .",
    "shock waves have been invoked to explain the heating , the morphology and the relatively large abundance of sio in the gc @xcite .",
    "shocks are also expected to sputter molecules from the icy grain mantles increasing the gas - phase abundance of the molecules formed in grains .",
    "evidences for the release of molecules from grain mantles in selected molecular clouds close to sgr a comes from the detection of 2h5oh and hoco@xmath0  in this region @xcite . in the scenario that shocks",
    "drive the chemistry in the gc clouds , it is expected that widespread 2h5oh emission closely follows that of sio .    in this letter",
    "we present observations of 2h5oh toward molecular clouds in sgr a , sgr b2 complexes and associated with the thermal features ( arched filaments hereafter taf and the sickle ) and the non thermal radio arc ( ntra ) in the gc ( * ? ? ?",
    "* for the nomenclature ) .",
    "we find that the 2h5oh emission in the gc is widespread , but large variations in the abundance of this molecule are found between the different gc molecular clouds . the large 2h5oh abundance and its variations are consistent with a scenario in which recent ( years ) shocks dominate the chemistry in the gc by grain processing .",
    "the observations of the ,  and  lines of 2h5oh towards the gc were carried out simultaneously with the iram 30-m telescope . to estimate the  column density we also observed simultaneously the  line of   and , the  line of and the  line of cs .",
    "the half power beam width of the telescope was 24 , 17  and 12  for the 3 , 2 and 1.3 mm bands .",
    "the receivers , equipped with sis mixers , were tuned to single side band with image rejections of 10 db .",
    "the typical system temperatures were 300 , 500 and 900 k for the 3 , 2 and 1.3 mm lines respectively .",
    "we used two filter banks of 256@xmath11mhz and one of 512@xmath11mhz as spectrometers .",
    "the velocity resolution provided by the filter banks were 3 , 2 and 1.3 for the 3 , 2 and 1.3 mm bands respectively .",
    "the calibration was achieved by observing hot and cold loads .",
    "the line intensities are given in units of .",
    "the observed molecular clouds were selected from the sio maps of @xcite and their locations are shown in the upper panel of fig .",
    "the typical line profiles of 2h5oh ,  and cs towards selected clouds in sgra ( m-0.11 - 0.08 ) , in sgr b2 ( m+0.76 - 0.05 ) , and associated with the sickle ( m+0.20 - 0.03 ) and the ntra ( m+0.17 + 0.01 ) are shown in the lower panels of fig .",
    "1 . table 1 summarizes the results obtained for all molecular clouds .",
    "the emission in the  line of 2h5oh is widespread in sgr a and sgr b2 .",
    "however , the line profiles of 2h5oh are different from those of cs , , and .",
    "this is illustrated in fig . 1 for m+0.76 - 0.06 .",
    "the cs and the  emission appears from -20 to 120 .",
    "however , like the sio emission in sgr a and sgr b2 @xcite , the 2h5oh emission mainly appears for radial velocities between 10 and 70 .",
    "this indicates variations in the abundance of 2h5oh in the molecular clouds along the line of sight with different radial velocities .",
    "column 4 in table 1 gives the radial velocity of the peak intensity of the  2h5oh line and the velocity range where the 2h5oh emission is detected .",
    "the morphology of the 2h5oh emission in the gc is also different from those of cs , , and .",
    "2h5oh emission is not detected towards m-0.08 - 0.06 in sgra .",
    "furthermore , the 2h5oh emission shows different behavior towards the different kind of filaments in the gc . in general , the molecular clouds associated with the thermal features like the sickle ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m+0.18 - 0.04 and m+0.20 - 0.03 ) and the tafs e1 and e2 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* m+0.13 + 0.02 and m+0.17 + 0.01 ) do not show 2h5oh emission .",
    "an interesting exception is the detection of 2h5oh emission towards m+0.04 + 0.03 , a molecular cloud located south of the taf w1 .",
    "however , the rather narrow radial velocity range of the 2h5oh emission as compared with those of the cs and  emission @xcite suggests that the bulk of the molecular gas associated with thermal features does not show 2h5oh emission .",
    "mapping of the 2h5oh emission in this region will tell the possible association of this velocity component with the thermal features .",
    "in contrast to the lack of 2h5oh emission from the molecular clouds associated with the thermal features , weak 2h5oh emission is detected towards m+0.17 + 0.01 in the ntra .    in summary , 2h5oh emission in the gc molecular clouds is widespread , but it shows substantial differences between the different features in the gc .",
    "furthermore , the 2h5oh emission is mainly restricted to molecular clouds with radial velocities between 10 and 70 .",
    "the lack of 2h5oh emission towards some molecular clouds in the gc with cs emission can not be due to excitation effects since the  line of 2h5oh and the cs j=3 - 2 line have similar critical densities .",
    "the difference between cs and 2h5oh emissions must be due to changes in the abundance of these molecules .",
    "the three 2h5oh lines can be combined to estimate the  densities and the 2h5oh column densities .",
    "the excitation temperature , , derived from the column densities of the  and  lines are given in column 5 of table 1 .",
    "for the sources detected in both lines , the derived  ranges from 9 to 14 k. considering a collisional cross section of 2h5oh similar to that of ch@xmath2oh , the  derived from the 2h5oh lines indicates  densities of few @xmath3 .",
    "these densitites are in good agreement with those obtained from sio and cs for the gc clouds @xcite . for the other sources , the upper limits are between 8 and 13 k. in the following we will assume a  of 7 k for these sources .",
    "the total 2h5oh column densities have been derived by assuming optically thin emission , and using the three substates partition function given by @xcite for the  in table 1 . since the _ @xmath4 _ and _ gauche _ torsional substates are not excited , only the _ trans _",
    "substate has been considered .",
    "since the 2h5oh profiles are , in general , different from those of cs and , in table 1 we give two different column densities for 2h5oh .",
    "the first one derived for the velocity range ( column 4 in table 1 ) where the 2h5oh line has been detected ( yes column ) , and the second one the upper limit derived for the velocity range with cs and , but without 2h5oh emission ( no column ) .",
    "table 1 also gives the column densities of  and cs derived for the two velocity ranges using the typical conditions in the gc , an  density of 3 3 and a kinetic temperature of 80 k.    the ratio between cs and  column densities for all sources and the two velocity ranges is fairly constant with a value of .",
    "this indicates that the cs abundance in the gc molecular clouds is roughly constant . for the typical  to  abundance ratio in the gc of 5",
    ", we derive a cs abundance of 5 . for this cs abundance",
    "we derive a 2h5oh abundance ( see column 9 of table 1 ) of 0.4 - 5@xmath1 for the clouds with 2h5oh emission . for the other clouds such as those associated with the thermal features , the 2h5oh abundance decreases by at least more than one order of magnitude .",
    "we conclude that large 2h5oh abundance of a few is found in most of the gc molecular clouds in the sgr a and sgr b2 complexes with radial velocities between 10 and 70 and the ntra",
    ". however , the 2h5oh abundance is not uniform and drops by more than one order of magnitude towards some molecular clouds in both complexes and the material associated with the thermal features in the gc .",
    "the widespread large abundance of 2h5oh in most of the gc clouds is a clear signature that large scale grain mantle erosion is taking place in this region of the galaxy .",
    "the abundance of 2h5oh in the gc clouds is even larger than those measured in the hot cores in the galactic disk @xcite . in hot cores ,",
    "the high 2h5oh abundance is explained by grain surface chemistry and subsequent thermal evaporation from the grains when they are heated by recently formed massive stars @xcite . in the gc clouds ,",
    "most of the dust is cold with dust temperatures of 20 - 30 k @xcite which are too low to evaporate the icy mantle from the grains .",
    "further support for the association of 2h5oh with the cold dust comes from the low 2h5oh abundance measured toward the thermal features such as the sickle that show large column densities of warm dust @xcite .",
    "this is likely due to the fact that the uv photons that heat the dust also photodissociate the thermal evaporated 2h5oh .",
    "thus , thermal evaporation of grain mantles in the gc clouds does not seem to account for the measured 2h5oh abundance in the gc .",
    "shock waves are thought to dominate the heating and the chemistry of refractory elements in the gc @xcite .",
    "2h5oh sputtered off the grain mantles by shock waves can explain the observed widespread large abundance of this molecule associated with the cold dust in the gc .",
    "c - shocks with moderate velocities of 30 - 40 can produce substantial grain processing @xcite explaining the large abundance of sio , 2h5oh and hoco@xmath0 in the gc .",
    "the picture emerging from all the molecular data is that the chemistry in the gc is largely driven by widespread shocks with moderate velocities of 40 .",
    "one interesting aspect of alcohol chemistry is its transient nature @xcite .",
    "the typical time scale for ethanol destruction after the injection into gas - phase is years for the hot core conditions @xcite . for the typical  densities in the gc clouds , an order of magnitude smaller than those for the hot cores , the estimated time scale for destruction of 2h5oh would be years .",
    "this indicates that the widespread shocks that drive the chemistry in the gc have occurred in the last years .",
    "similar time scales for the shocks have been derived from the non - equilibrium  ortho - to - para ratios in two gc clouds @xcite .",
    "several possibilities have been proposed for the origin of the widespread shocks in the gc : shocks due to cloud - cloud collisions associated with the large scale dynamics in the context of a bar potential @xcite and shocks produced by wind - blown bubbles driven by evolved massive stars @xcite .",
    "both mechanisms seem to account for the time scales derived from the abundance of 2h5oh .",
    "the time scale derived for the cloud - cloud collisions would be less than the galactic rotation period of years @xcite .",
    "this scenario is supported by the large sio abundances found at the outer inner lindblad resonance in the milky way @xcite and in ngc253 @xcite .",
    "the wind - blown bubbles driven by evolved massive stars have typical dynamical ages of years , consistent with the life time derived from ethanol . furthermore , evolved massive stars also explain the correlation between the large 2h5oh and sio abundance in the molecular clouds with radial velocities between 10 and 70 and the fe 6.4 kev lines @xcite .",
    "however , this scenario can only explain the widespread large 2h5oh and sio abundance if a burst of massive star formation has occurred in the gc years ago .",
    "large scale mapping of the gc in molecular species dominated by different type of chemistry will help to establish the origin of the shocks .",
    "furthermore , the strong 2h5oh line intensities towards many sources in the gc makes these regions ideal targets to search for the large ether molecules predicted by @xcite .",
