    "<S> in this paper we study the persistent current ( pc ) of a staggered harper model , close to the half - filling . the harper model , which is a quasi - periodic system , is different than other one dimensional systems with uncorrelated disorder in the fact that it can be in the metallic regime . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , the pc for a wide range of parameters of the harper model does not show typical metallic behavior , although the system is in the metallic regime . this is a result of the nature of the central band states , which are a hybridization of gaussian states localized in superlattice points . </S>",
    "<S> when the superlattice is not commensurate with the system length , the pc behaves as in an insulator . </S>",
    "<S> thus even in the metallic regime a typical finite harper model may exhibit a pc expected from an insulator .    in the last decade , quasi - periodic one - dimensional ( 1d ) potential , </S>",
    "<S> also known as the aubry - andre - harper ( for short harper ) model @xcite , has garnered much interest . </S>",
    "<S> the main reason for this interest is that it is the disorder of choice for cold atoms , since it may be created by the superposition of two incommensurate periodic potentials @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to white noise disordered systems which are always localized for 1d @xcite , the harper model shows a 1d metal - insulator ( anderson ) transition for non - interacting particles as function of the strength of the potential @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this has been demonstrated experimentally in cold atoms @xcite , as well as for optical systems @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> additional effort has gone into understanding the influence of electron - electron interactions on this metal - insulator transition @xcite , and on the the many - body localization in these quasiperiodic system @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the harper model also exhibits topological edge state @xcite , and show counterintuitive behavior of the compressibility @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the current carried by the ground state of a ring threaded by a magnetic flux is called the persistent current ( pc ) @xcite . in the presence of elastic scatterers ( disorder ) , </S>",
    "<S> the persistent current is suppressed @xcite . in the diffusive regime , on the average it is suppressed by a power law of the circumference of the ring @xmath0 , while in the localized regime it suppressed exponentially by @xmath1 , where @xmath2 is the localization length . since for non correlated ( white noise ) disorder , all states of a 1d system are localized , one expects that for 1d systems the averaged pc is always suppressed exponential .    </S>",
    "<S> the pc is a very effective way to evaluate the sensitivity of the system to boundary conditions , i.e. , the conductance of the system @xcite , and therefore a great way to identify whether your system is metallic or localized . </S>",
    "<S> thus , naively , we would expect that the pc for the harper model in the metallic regime ( i.e. , not too strong on - site potentials ) will on the average be only weakly suppressed by the potential . here </S>",
    "<S> , we will show that the persistent current of the harper model can exhibit a rather intricate behavior , which can skew the simple picture presented above .    in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we study the pc of a harper model of spinless fermions on a ring threaded by a magnetic flux . </S>",
    "<S> this is a tight - binding model in which the on - site potential is spatially modulated with an irrational frequency </S>",
    "<S> . we would focus here on irrational frequencies which their modulus is close to half . </S>",
    "<S> this corresponds to a fast ( two site ) modulation with a slow envelope . </S>",
    "<S> these frequencies exhibit an increase of the compressibility when the electron - electron interactions are increased , opposite to the influence of interactions in regular disordered systems @xcite . here </S>",
    "<S> we will show that for this range of frequencies close to half - filling , the pc shows a non - monotonous dependence on the systems size , where for most values of @xmath0 the pc is strongly suppressed . </S>",
    "<S> the tight - binding harper model hamiltonian for spinless fermions on a ring threaded by a magnetic flux is :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the single particle annihilation operator on site @xmath5 , @xmath6 is a real hopping amplitude . </S>",
    "<S> the magnetic flux is denoted by @xmath7 , and @xmath8 is the quantum flux quanta @xmath9 . the strength of the on - site potential is controlled by @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the on - site potential is modulated by a frequency @xmath11 , and @xmath12 is an arbitrary phase factor </S>",
    "<S> . it should be clear that since we are interested in a ring , @xmath12 is irrelevant and will be ignored through the rest of this paper </S>",
    "<S> . we will be interested in the metallic regime of the model , </S>",
    "<S> i.e @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the irrational frequency may to written as @xmath14 , where @xmath15 is irrational . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we can write the on - site potential as :    @xmath16    when @xmath17 the system is called an almost staggered harper model for which the fast frequency of the @xmath18 term is modulated by the slow frequency , @xmath15 , of the @xmath19 term . in the almost staggered case </S>",
    "<S> the energy spectrum of system shows unique features such as a central band that is separated from the other bands by a large gap , of order @xmath20 , as can be seen in fig.[fig0 ] . </S>",
    "<S> also the two bands sandwiching the central band show similar features , i.e. , a rather narrow ( flat ) band and a large gap to the next band . changing </S>",
    "<S> the length of the sample length from @xmath21 to @xmath22 does not change its gross features , although some difference in the energies of the edge states in the gaps are apparent . as detailed in ref . </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , for @xmath23 , there are @xmath24 states in the central band , corresponding to the number of intersections with zero of the slow modulation envelope , which occur at @xmath25 . these valleys are shown in fig.[fig1 ] for a smaller system ( @xmath26 ) in order not to clutter the figure . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency of the envelope is @xmath15 and the distance between two consecutive valleys is half the period , i.e. , the distance is @xmath27 . </S>",
    "<S> for example , for the systems depicted in fig.[fig0 ] , @xmath28 , and therefore @xmath29 , resulting in @xmath30 for @xmath21 and @xmath31 for @xmath22 . while for the @xmath26 case shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig1 ] @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , the @xmath33 valley states are clearly seen , as well as the fact that the valley positions ate not exactly commensurate .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , to first approximation , there is a superlattice of valleys at points @xmath34 , with @xmath35 , each with a zero - energy state , @xmath36 , centered around @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> these states can be written as gaussians falling off at a length scale of @xmath38 . </S>",
    "<S> the central band eigenfunctions are composed of the hybridization of these localized state . </S>",
    "<S> for periodic boundary conditions , and when @xmath39 , the eigenstates of the central band are plane waves composed of the valley gaussian , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 . the spectrum @xmath42 @xcite , where @xmath43 ( @xmath44 ) and @xmath45 -   \\lambda \\exp(-\\pi^2 \\epsilon^2 \\xi^2)\\big)$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> thus , the central band spectrum is expected to show a degeneracy since @xmath46 </S>",
    "<S> . a closer look at this issue reveals that if the system is not _ </S>",
    "<S> exactly _ periodic , the degeneracy will be broken by the non perfect periodicity . </S>",
    "<S> one may think of the effect of the non perfect periodicity as an impurity at the region of the non - periodicity ( i.e. , around @xmath47 ) . for low - lying states in the central band , the impurity acts as a hard - wall , leading to low - lying states of the form : @xmath48 , with @xmath49 ( @xmath50 ) , and eigenvalues @xmath51 . </S>",
    "<S> thus , as can be seen in the inset of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig0 ] , for the low - lying states in the central band the degeneracy in the eigen - values is lost , both for the almost periodic case ( @xmath21 ) , as for the non - periodic one ( @xmath22 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the low - lying wave functions are depicted in the upper panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2 ] . for comparison the wave functions of a clean ring of the same length , with a single impurity at @xmath47 ( weak for @xmath21 , strong for @xmath22 ) , is drawn . for the clean system </S>",
    "<S> the ground state wave function corresponds to a half - sine , while the first excited state to a sine . </S>",
    "<S> this behavior is not very sensitive to the impurity strength . </S>",
    "<S> a similar situation can be seen for the harper model , where the half - sine and sine envelopes are composed of the gaussian superlattice states at points @xmath34 . as expected for the low - lying states there is no essential difference between the almost periodic case and the non - periodic one .    </S>",
    "<S> this changes when higher levels are considered . for higher energies </S>",
    "<S> , one expects that the effect of the impurity will be weaker . indeed , as can be seen for the clean system depicted in the lower panel of fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2a ] , if the strength of the impurity is weak ( the @xmath21 case ) , the wave function is homogeneous . only for the stronger impurity ( the @xmath22 case ) </S>",
    "<S> , the wave function shows a signature of the impurity . </S>",
    "<S> a similar behavior is seen for the central band of the harper model . for the almost commensurate case the states in the middle of the central band show only a slight degeneracy breaking ( see the inset of fig . [ fig0 ] , where the energies for @xmath21 clearly appear in pairs ) . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , when the non - commensurability is stronger , as for @xmath22 , the levels are non - degenerate even in the middle , thus corresponding to a hard wall boundary condition even for higher energies . </S>",
    "<S> this distinction can be seen also for the wave functions , where for the almost commensurate harper model the wave function is almost homogeneous , while for the non - commensurate case the wave function is non - homogeneous ( see fig . </S>",

    "<S> since we are considering here the metallic regime of the harper model ( @xmath53 ) , a metallic behavior of the pc is expected . </S>",
    "<S> the most obvious difference between the pc of a metallic and a localized system is the amplitude of the pc . </S>",
    "<S> as can be seen from the energy dependence on the threading flux presented in fig . </S>",

    "<S> for the commensurate case a high amplitude of the pc is seen , which is in line with our expectations from a metallic system . moreover , a unique sawtooth dependence as function of the flux is observed , similar to the typical behavior of the total pc in clean and weakly disordered systems @xcite . on the other hand , for the incommensurate case @xmath64 is almost flat and has a sine flux dependence , expected in the localized regime .     </S>",

    "<S> jumps in the red curve indicates a gap between the states . </S>",
    "<S> close to the gaps ( i.e. , at the band edge ) the total pc goes to zero . </S>",

    "<S> , title=\"fig:\",width=321 ]    an additional indicative feature for determining whether the pc corresponds to a metallic or a localized behavior , is the number of harmonics composing the pc . </S>",
    "<S> generally , the pc may be written as a harmonic expansion of the form @xmath69 and @xmath70 . </S>",
    "<S> for the localized regime the pc is described by the first harmonic , i.e. , @xmath71 and @xmath72 @xcite , while for the metallic regime , the weight of higher harmonics falls off rather slowly @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , both the amplitude and dependence on the flux of the almost commensurate and non - commensurate length demonstrate a completely different behavior at the middle of the central band . </S>",
    "<S> this is also evident from the fourier tranform of the pc ( fig . </S>",
    "<S> ( [ fig6 ] ) , where for the non - commensurate cases only the first harmonic is non - zero , while for almost commensurate cases the contribution of higher harmonics is still significant .    </S>",
    "<S> therefore , if one uses the total pc at half - filling , or the persistent current of a particular state in the middle of the central band to decide whether the harper model is metallic or localized , one would get different results as function of the length of the sample . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior is metallic for the almost commensurate length and localized like for the non commensurate length . </S>",
    "<S> of course the system remains essentially metallic in both cases . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , as we have seen from a direct inspection of the wave functions in the central band ( figs . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig2],[fig2a ] ) the non commensurate segment has an influence similar to an impurity embedded in the ring . </S>",
    "<S> since this impurity acts like a barrier , we expect that the pc amplitude will be suppressed proportionally to the overlap between two superlattice states , i.e. , proportionally to @xmath73 ( where @xmath74 is a constant ) . in fig.[fig4 ] we plot the first harmonic of the pc of the middle state @xmath75 is plotted as function of @xmath76 . here </S>",
    "<S> we keep the strength of the potential @xmath20 and system size @xmath0 constant , while changing @xmath77 . </S>",
    "<S> it can be seen that @xmath78 is suppressed exponentially as function of @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> this fits well with the description of the non - commensurate central band as a system with an impurity . </S>",
    "<S> it also confirms that pc can not be used in these systems to determine whether the system is metallic or localized .     </S>",
    "<S> ( color online ) fourier transform of the total pc at the middle of the spectrum . for the incommensurate cases ( @xmath22 , and @xmath63 ) the fourier transform has only one significant component which is relatively small . for the almost commensurate superlattice cases ( @xmath21 , and @xmath62 ) </S>",
    "<S> the first component is the biggest , but the contribution from the higher components goes down only gradually . </S>",
    "<S> , width=321 ]    1truecm   ( color online ) the first harmonic of the central state pc @xmath75 as a function of @xmath79 , with b=@xmath80 and @xmath53 . in order to change the width of the gaussian states on the superlattice points ( @xmath79 ) we change @xmath15 by either positive or negative values . </S>",
    "<S> it is clear that @xmath75 depends on @xmath77 , and is well described by an exponential decrease with @xmath79 . </S>",
    "<S> upper panel : @xmath81 lower panel : @xmath22,title=\"fig:\",width=321 ] 1truecm    in conclusion , we have considered the pc in the staggered harper model , mainly close to the half - filling . </S>",
    "<S> contrary to naive expectations the pc for most systems do not show typical metallic behavior , although the system is in the metallic regime . </S>",
    "<S> this stems from the unique character of the central band states , which are a hybridization of gaussian states localized in super lattice points . </S>",
    "<S> if the distance between the superlattice sites are ( almost ) commensurate with the system size , then the pc has metallic properties . on the other hand , when the superlattice sites are incommensurate the system has an effective impurity at the incommensurate section and the pc shows the signature of an insulator . since for most combinations of the harper frequency @xmath11 ( close to the staggered condition @xmath82 ) and length @xmath0 are incommensurate , a typical harper model will actually exhibit pc corresponding to an insulator .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , studying the pc at half - filling for the finite almost staggered harper model is not indicative of the phase of the system . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , also other stout method for identifying the metal - insulator transition , such as the level spacing statistics @xcite , will not show the expected transition in the level statistics from the poisson distribution for the localized regime to the wigner distribution in the metallic regime . as is evident from the inset in fig . </S>",
    "<S> [ fig0 ] , the distribution will change even in the metallic regime , between a picket fence distribution to a bi - model one . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , when studying the harper model in order to investigate the metal - insulator transition one must be careful to choose the appropriate measures .      </S>",
