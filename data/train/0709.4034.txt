    "the proton recoil - polarization observables were extracted by means of the maximum - likelihood technique , utilizing the azimuthal distribution of protons scattered by the graphite analyzer in a focal - plane polarimeter ( fpp ) @xcite .    since these experiments were designed to detect differences between the in - medium polarizations compared with the free values , both @xmath0he and @xmath23h targets were used .",
    "the results of the measurements are expressed in terms of the polarization - transfer double ratio , in which the helium polarization ratio is normalized to the hydrogen polarization ratio measured in the identical setting : @xmath24 as a cross - check , the hydrogen results were also used to extract the free - proton form - factor ratio @xmath25 , which was found to be in excellent agreement with previous polarization - transfer data @xcite .",
    "nearly all systematic uncertainties cancel in @xmath26 : the polarization - transfer observables are to first order independent of instrumental asymmetries in the fpp , and their ratio is independent of the electron - beam polarization and carbon analyzing power .",
    "small systematic uncertainties are predominantly due to uncertainties in the spin transport through the proton spectrometer .",
    "the induced proton polarization @xmath27 in @xmath28 is a direct measure of final - state interactions and was also measured in the jefferson lab experiments .",
    "its extraction is complicated by the presence of instrumental asymmetries .",

    "the baseline @xmath30 is the value of @xmath26 obtained in a plane - wave calculation , to account for the trivial effects of free _ vs. _ moving proton .",
    "the data are compared to calculations from the madrid group @xcite and schiavilla _ et al .",
    "[ fig : ratioplot ] ]    this agreement has been interpreted as a possible evidence of proton medium modifications @xcite .",
    "this interpretation is based on the more effective description of the data in a particular model in terms of medium modifications of nucleon form factors and requires to have excellent control of the inherent many - body effects , such as meson - exchange currents ( mec ) and isobar configurations ( ic ) .",
    "in addition , when probing nuclear structure , one has to deal with final - state interactions ( fsi ) . indeed , the observed suppression of the polarization - transfer ratio has been equally well described in a more traditional calculation by schiavilla @xcite using free form factors by including charge - exchange final - state interactions and two - body charge and current operators ( shaded band ) . yet ,",
    "the choice of the parameters for the charge - exchange fsi is not well constrained by data .    the preliminary results from e03 - 104 possibly hint at an unexpected trend in the @xmath3 dependence of @xmath26 .",
    "this is particularly interesting as other calculations of in - medium form factors suggest a different @xmath3 dependence than that of the qmc model .",
    "the high statistics of the data from e03 - 104 will allow for a study of the individual polarization observables as a function of missing momentum up to about 120 mev/@xmath4 .",
    "the difference in the modeling of final - state interactions is the origin of the major part of the difference between the results of the calculations by udias _",

    "@xcite for the polarization observables .",
    "effects from final - state interactions can be studied experimentally with the induced polarization , @xmath27 .",
    "figure [ fig : py ] shows the data for @xmath27 .",
    "the induced polarization is small in this reaction .",
    "the sizable systematic uncertainties are due to possible instrumental asymmetries .",
    "dedicated data have been taken during e03 - 104 to study these and we hope to significantly reduce the systematic uncertainties in @xmath27 in the final analysis .",
    "the data are compared with the results of the calculations from the madrid group and schiavilla _ et al .",
    "_ at missing momenta of about zero .",
    "the data have been corrected for the spectrometer acceptance to facilitate this comparison .      presently , the data suggest that the magnitude of the induced polarization ( and thus the final - state interaction ) is overestimated in the model of schiavilla _",
    "et al._. a comparison of the model calculations in figure [ fig : ratioplot ] and figure [ fig : py ] shows that the in - medium form factors ( solid curves ) mostly affect the ratio of polarization - transfer observables , not the induced polarization .",
    "it is a key element of e03 - 104 to have access to both .    in summary ,",
    "polarization transfer in the quasielastic @xmath31 reaction is sensitive to possible medium modifications of the bound - nucleon form factor , while at the same time largely insensitive to other reaction mechanisms .",
    "currently , the @xmath0he@xmath32h polarization - transfer data can be well described by either the inclusion of medium - modified form factors or strong charge - exchange fsi in the models . however",
    ", these strong fsi effects may not be consistent with the induced polarization data .",
    "the final analysis of our new high - precision data from jefferson lab hall a should provide a more stringent test of these calculations .",
