    "the charge ordering phenomena in the hole - doped r@xmath10a@xmath11mno@xmath1 ( r is a trivalent rare - earth ion and a is a divalent alkaline - earth ion ) have been a subject of extensive studies due to intriguing interplay of the charge , orbital and spin degrees of freedom .",
    "the charge ordered ( co ) state is formed due to localization of the mobile @xmath12-holes .    above @xmath6",
    "the @xmath12-holes provide fm correlations between electron spins of neighboring manganese ions through the double - exchange ( de ) mechanism proposed by zener @xcite .",
    "pr@xmath10ca@xmath11mno@xmath1 ( @xmath13 ) oxides are the most suitable for investigation of the co state since the onsets of the charge ( @xmath6 ) and spin ( @xmath9 ) order are well separated in temperature .",

    "recent resonant x - ray scattering @xcite , electron microscopy @xcite and neutron diffraction @xcite , @xcite studies of pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 have shown that the orbital order ( oo ) below @xmath27 results in an orbital domain state commensurate with the lattice .",

    "the partial orbital disorder turns on the fm spin fluctuations which become dominating near @xmath29 @xcite .",
    "the c - ic transition was considered in terms of the @xmath12-orbital polarization soft mode .",
    "the @xmath12-orbital completely polarized along mn - o bond corresponds to the amplitude of the wave at a given mn@xmath17 ion @xcite and its wave vector @xmath30 was considered as the order parameter of the transition .",

    "studies of spatial fluctuations of charge / orbital order with diffraction experiments @xcite , @xcite is restricted to short correlation times @xmath31 . whereas nmr experiments enable studying time - dependent spin fluctuations at much longer @xmath32 .    in this work",

    "oxygen atoms being placed between two mn ions bring valuable information about the spin / orbital configuration of the nearest mn ions .",
    "as expected the nuclear spin of oxygen @xmath33 probes its magnetic state through the dipolar and transferred hyperfine magnetic fields that depend on the spin / orbital configuration of the neighboring mn ions @xcite .",

    "first , the nmr spectrum of mn@xmath18 ion ( @xmath20 electron configuration ) is available only at low temperatures in the metastable co af phase . on the other hand , nmr of mn@xmath17(@xmath19 )",
    "is hard to detect due to extremely high nuclear spin - spin relaxation rate apparently controlled by abnormal low - frequency spin dynamic of the localized e@xmath35-electrons .",
    "this @xmath2o nmr report is focused on the study of the development of the charge / orbital ordering in pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 .",
    "the main result is that in pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 the ce - type magnetic correlations develop gradually below @xmath6 : first those between ab - layers arise and only at lower temperature the correlations within ab - planes appear .",
    "the static ( @xmath36 ) orbital order is established only on approaching @xmath9 .",
    "we used a powder sample of pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 prepared by traditional ceramic technology .",

    "@xmath2o nmr measurements were carried out on a phase - coherent nmr pulse bruker spectrometer over the temperature range of @xmath38 in magnetic field of @xmath5 . in this field the onset of the co and af spin ordering was found to shift slightly down to @xmath39 and @xmath40 compared to reported data at zero field and in accordance with @xmath41-dependence of @xmath6 reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "nmr spectra were obtained for a loose - packed powder sample with point - by - point frequency sweep measurements , the intensity of the spin - echo signal formed with the pulse sequence @xmath42-echo being measured .",
    "the width of the @xmath43- exciting pulse was @xmath44 and the distance between pulses varied in the range of @xmath45 . for each frequency , the amplitude of the exciting rf - pulse was adjusted in order to optimize the echo signal intensity while keeping the pulse duration fixed .",
    "all the echo - intensities were corrected to @xmath46 by measuring the rate of echo - decay at different frequencies of the broad spectrum .",
    "all the spectra for @xmath47 were measured during cooling down from room temperature to avoid the hysteresis uncertainties .",
    "the @xmath2o nmr signal in h@xmath48o was used as a frequency reference to determine the shift of nmr line in our sample .",
    "figure 2 shows the @xmath2o nmr spectra of pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 measured in the pm state . in the charge disorder",
    "paramagnetic state ( cd pm ) for @xmath49 the main signal @xmath50 in the spectrum is a rather asymmetric line .",
    "it has a positive and extremely large magnetic shift exceeding @xmath51 even at the highest measured temperature , @xmath52 with respect to those observed in nonmagnetic compounds .",
    "an additional line of small intensity @xmath53 is present at zero nmr - shift .",
    "it is supposed to originate from a small amount of the ca - based oxides , which arise as spurious precipitations during the solid - state reaction synthesis .",
    "it s well known that a small concentration of spurious phase formed with light atoms like ca is hard to detect by x - ray .",
    "let us now consider the quadrupolar and magnetic shift interactions of the oxygen nuclear spin with its environment .",
    "the oxygen atoms are located at the corners of octahedra with mn at the center .",
    "the noncubic local symmetry of oxygen sites leads to the interaction of @xmath2o electric quadrupole moment @xmath54 with electric field gradient @xmath55 ) .",
    "the resulting @xmath2o nmr spectrum is expected to split into @xmath56 lines separated by the quadrupole frequency @xmath57 at @xmath58 .",
    "experimentally this characteristic first - order quadrupole splitting has never been observed .",
    "it shows that @xmath59 does not exceed the nmr linewidth measured at @xmath52 i.e. @xmath60 in agreement with ref.@xcite .",
    "thus the quadrupolar interaction will only provide broadening effects on the observed pattern of nmr spectra , these quadrupolar effects being small compared to the magnetic interaction effects ( see below ) .",
    "the powder pattern spectrum of the pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 main line in the cd pm state may be described assuming an axial symmetry of the magnetic shift tensor @xmath61 .",
    "the subscripts @xmath62 or @xmath63 refer to the shift component @xmath64 of oxygen with mn - o bond directed perpendicular or parallel to the external magnetic field * @xmath65 * , respectively .",
    "the analysis of the line leads to @xmath66 and @xmath67 at @xmath68 .",
    "the thermal variation of the shift is shown in fig.3 .",
    "with decreasing temperature the peak of the line is further shifted following the curie - weiss law with @xmath69 . the corresponding fit curve drawn by a dashed line in figs .",
    "2,3 results in @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "a close value of @xmath72 is obtained by fitting the magnetic susceptibility @xmath73 data measured in the range of @xmath74 in ref.@xcite .",
    "the positive value of @xmath75 evidences that fm spin correlations between neighboring mn are the dominating ones in the cd pm state above @xmath6 .",
    "a similar conclusion about the prevalence of the fm spin correlations between mn ions in the cd pm phase was inferred from the @xmath76la nmr line shift in la@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 , which becomes fm - metal in the field of @xmath77 below @xmath78 @xcite .",
    "the slope of the @xmath79 vs @xmath80 plot corresponds to the local magnetic field @xmath81 ( the @xmath80-data are taken from fig.4 in ref.@xcite .",
    "it exceeds the magnitude of the classic dipolar field @xmath82 induced at oxygen by the magnetic moments of the neighboring mn ions : @xmath83 at room temperature @xmath84 may be estimated as @xmath85 where @xmath80 is defined per spin from ref.@xcite .",
    "the corresponding estimated anisotropic contribution to the total nmr line shift @xmath86 is much less than the experimental value .",
    "thus we assume that the classic dipole interaction of @xmath2o nucleus with the effective magnetic moments @xmath87 of the nearest mn has no strong influence on the total shape of the spectrum .",
    "the most probable origin of the observed giant isotropic magnetic shift @xmath88 is the fermi contact interaction of the nuclear spin @xmath89 with the transferred s - spin density of electrons participating both in the mn - o - mn bonding and in superexchange coupling of the neighboring mn , @xmath90 here @xmath91 , @xmath92 is the isotropic hyperfine coupling constant for oxygen ion @xcite , @xcite .",
    "@xmath93 is the corresponding hyperfine magnetic field due to the fermi - contact interaction with electron located on 2s - orbital with wave function @xmath94 .",
    "following @xcite , @xcite the corresponding isotropic spin density transferred at oxygen from neighboring mn ions may be defined in terms of the factor @xmath95 .",
    "this quantity estimated from ( 2 ) results in a rather large magnitude of the effective fractional occupancy of o(2s ) orbitals by unpaired spins .",
    "we found @xmath96 for insulating pm state of pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 .",
    "for comparison the lda+u band structure calculation results in @xmath97 for the fm - ordered state of lamno@xmath1 @xcite .",
    "another possible isotropic hyperfine interaction is the core - polarization term which provides @xmath98 @xcite when assuming that the doped electron is fully localized within the oxygen 2p - orbital .",
    "but this is not the case above @xmath6 in pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 .",
    "thus this interaction may be neglected for the light oxygen atom .",
    "the noncubic local symmetry of oxygen sites gives rise to an anisotropic part of the magnetic shift tensor @xmath99 .",
    "the most reasonable contribution to @xmath100 is the magnetic dipole - dipole hyperfine interaction of @xmath89 with electrons on 2p@xmath101 orbitals , which spin occupancies up and down become different through the polarizing interactions with neighboring manganese .",
    "the corresponding magnetic shift tensor @xmath102 may be expressed through the fractional spin density transfer @xmath103 on o-2p@xmath104 orbital from paramagnetic neighboring mn - ion @xcite as : @xmath105 @xmath106,(@xmath107 ) being defined for * @xmath65 * parallel ( perpendicular ) to the mn - o bond respectively .",
    "the resulting dipolar contribution to @xmath100 is thus determined by the difference of transferred spin density @xmath108 for different o-2p orbitals from neighboring mn - ion @xcite : @xmath109 taking @xmath110 @xcite for neutral oxygen atom we obtain a rather large positive value @xmath111 .",
    "the direct observation of the positive value of @xmath112 proves for the first time that the @xmath113-orbital directed along the mn - o bond is more polarized than the two other @xmath114-orbitals .",
    "we showed before that the @xmath2o nmr line position in the cd pm state is mainly determined by the isotropic transferred hyperfine coupling , arising from the hybridization of mn(3d ) and o(2s ) orbitals . in the ideal @xmath14 structure",
    "there is no overlap of mn(@xmath115)-o(2s ) orbitals due to their orthogonality , while @xmath12-orbitals of mn have a rather strong overlap with s - orbital of neighboring oxygen as shown in fig.1 .",
    "hereafter we restrict ourselves to the effects of overlap and covalency between mn(@xmath12 ) and o(2s ) orbitals .",
    "just below @xmath6 the @xmath2o nmr spectrum is substantially broadened .",
    "it splits into two parts as shown in fig.2 .",
    "the low - frequency spectrum in the range of @xmath116 is asymmetric ( a - line ) .",
    "its width decreases gradually as the temperature approaches @xmath9 .",
    "the high - frequency spectrum is approximately twice larger in intensity and forms a rather complicated pattern which center of gravity is shifted to extremely large positive @xmath117 . at @xmath118",
    "it splits into two broad lines ( b- and c - line ) of about equal intensity and peaked at @xmath119 and @xmath120 , respectively .    according to x - ray and neutron diffraction studies @xcite , the co and oo of the ce - type becomes commensurate in the co pm phase only near @xmath9 .",
    "if the domain structure of the oo @xcite,@xcite is ignored , one finds four groups of the oxygen atoms differentiated by the charge and/or by the direction of occupied @xmath12-orbital of the nearest - neighboring mn - ions .",
    "the first and the second groups are formed by apical oxygen located between two mn@xmath17-ions ( o1-site , shown in fig.1 ) or between mn@xmath18 ( o2/o3-site ) , respectively .",
    "note that the @xmath121-projections of electron spins are af correlated for neighboring mn from adjacent ab - planes . a third group is formed by oxygen ( o4 ) in the ab - plane which participates in the af coupling of neighboring mn@xmath18 , mn@xmath17 from adjacent zigzags . the last group ( o5 )",
    "is formed by oxygen in the ab - plane located between two fm coupled mn@xmath18and mn@xmath17 ions inside a zigzag .",
    "the concentration of each type of oxygen atoms obeys the `` structural '' ratio @xmath122 .    in order to assign a - c - lines measured in the co pm phase",
    "we analyze first the spectra near @xmath9 with resolved structure .",
    "we compare the `` structural '' ratio with the experimental `` nmr line intensity '' ratio , which is close to @xmath123 .",
    "we also take into account that the local magnetic fields at different oxygen sites are formed through the mn - o - mn exchange interactions which are short - range in space . in co",
    "pm phase the effective magnetic moment of mn ( shown in fig.1 by arrows ) is defined by its projection @xmath124 on the direction of the external magnetic field . in turn",
    "it controls the sign of the corresponding @xmath2o nmr shift contributed by each of the two neighboring mn .    a - line",
    "is attributed to the apical ( o1 and o2/o3 ) sites whereas b- and c - lines - to the in - plane ones .",
    "the magnetic shift of the a - line is small , and the local field at the corresponding @xmath2o is comparable in magnitude to the classic dipolar field estimated above ( 1 ) . at these apical sites the hyperfine magnetic shifts ( 2- 4 )",
    "are greatly reduced since both neighboring mn - ions are in the same valence state and their effective magnetic moments @xmath124 are af correlated in the co pm phase of ce - type .",
    "let us now consider the high - frequency part of the spectra .",
    "c - line demonstrating the largest positive shift may be attributed to oxygen positioned in o5 sites whereas b - line is presumably due to oxygen located in o4 sites .",
    "indeed for oxygen in o5 site the transferred s - wave spin density is maximal since within the zigzag the lobe of the partially occupied @xmath125 orbital of mn@xmath17 ion points toward the neighboring oxygen .",
    "furthermore the two neighboring mn ions are fm correlated . for o4",
    "we definitely expect a rather large transferred hyperfine field for the following reason .",
    "although the spins of mn in adjacent zigzags are antiparallel , the o4 oxygen is `` sandwiched '' between mn@xmath17and mn@xmath18 ions with different spin values and different orbital occupations , i.e. with different covalency . so that the transferred polarization from these two mn ions should not compensate as they do for the apical oxygen ( o1 , o2/o3 ) .",
    "this should again result in a substantial shift , although smaller than for o5 .",
    "moreover the transferred s - wave polarization from mn@xmath18 ion is expected to be negative due to effects of covalent mixing with the empty @xmath12-orbitals @xcite . as reviewed in @xcite",
    "the charge transfer from the occupied o-2s orbital to the empty eg - orbital is spin dependent .",
    "it is regulated by the intra - atomic exchange coupling with electrons on @xmath126-orbitals .",
    "thus in the co pm phase the static s - wave polarization is directed along @xmath127 , and the isotropic shift at o5 site may be expressed similarly to ( 2 ) through the corresponding transferred spin densities @xmath128 or @xmath129 of the neighboring mn ( with @xmath130 and @xmath131 ) : @xmath132 the effective magnetic moments of neighboring mn from adjacent zigzags are af correlated and we obtain for @xmath133(04 ) the following expression : @xmath134 the sign @xmath135 in ( 5),(6 ) takes into account the fact that fm / af spin correlations of the neighboring mn@xmath17 and mn@xmath18 ions are considered as static in the time interval which is much longer that the inverse splitting of the b- and c - line ( @xmath136 ) of the spectrum at @xmath137 , when the co and oo are completely formed in pm state .",
    "this agrees with the fact that the o(2s)-polarization is provided predominantly by the @xmath138-overlap with the @xmath12-orbitals of mn , and pauli blocking of part of @xmath12-orbitals in mn@xmath17 gives stronger polarization than in the case of mn@xmath18,where both 2s@xmath139 and 2s@xmath140-electrons of o2- may virtually hop to mn@xmath18 so that the net oxygen polarization due to covalency with mn@xmath18 will be smaller than for mn@xmath17-neighbor and negative .",
    "for crude estimate of the transferred s - spin density we have assumed in ( 5),(6 ) that the @xmath138-overlap of @xmath125 orbital of mn@xmath17 with 2s - orbital of o5 in zigzag of the ce - type charge and orbital ordered phase is twice larger than the overlap with corresponding 2s - orbital of oxygen o4 located between the neighboring zigzags in ab - plane .",
    "( _ of course under detailed consideration it should depend on interatomic distance and on the bending of the mn@xmath17-o bond in the tilted and jt distorted mno@xmath24 octahedra . _ ) inserting the value of the peak position of b - line @xmath141 and c - line @xmath142 into expressions ( 6),(5 ) respectively we get that the transferred s - wave polarization from mn@xmath17 ion is positive and its absolute value exceeds about 4 times the corresponding negative polarization transferred from mn@xmath18 @xmath143 .",
    "the large difference in spin densities transferred from mn@xmath17/mn@xmath18 ions indicates a substantial delocalization of the `` @xmath12-hole '' within the hybridized @xmath144 - 2p@xmath145(o ) orbital @xcite .",
    "it shows that a pure ionic approach where the @xmath12-hole is completely localized at the mn@xmath17 ion is a very rough approximation to describe in detail the co and oo in doped manganite .",
    "unfortunately the spatial distribution of the fermi contact hyperfine fields results in a large broadening of the separate nmr lines in spectrum measured at @xmath47 .",
    "it masks the anisotropy of the magnetic shift tensor and does not permit to trace the transfer of the 2p - spin density at oxygen in the co pm phase , i.e. to address the orbital order more directly by studying polarization of a given p - orbital .      different local fields for apical oxygen in o1 and ( o2/o3 ) sites are expected only in the spin - ordered phase below @xmath9 . in the af phase the af moment canting takes place when a rather high magnetic field ( @xmath5 ) is applied .",
    "the canted moment of mn in adjacent ab - planes will create at the apical oxygen an additional local field dependent on the valence state of neighboring mn . at o1 sites",
    "the neighboring mn@xmath17 ions create a larger isotropic magnetic shift than mn@xmath18 ions do at o2/o3 sites .",
    "indeed , as shown in fig.4 at @xmath146 a - line splits into two lines of roughly equal intensity .",
    "a loose packed powder sample in a strong enough external field may be considered as partially oriented with * c@xmath147h*. it should be noted that the observed splitting (  4mhz ) is not a result of the classic dipolar fields of the neighboring mn ions since the difference in their effective magnetic moments is too small ( @xmath148 for mn@xmath17 and @xmath149 for mn@xmath18 as estimated from fig.4 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "the only slight additional broadening of the nmr spectra even around @xmath150 evidences that the line shift is mainly determined by the short - range co and oo which have been completely formed in the co pm phase at @xmath151 . below 110k",
    "it appears that the optimal rf pulse duration increases about twice from the low to the high frequency part of the a - line as illustrated in fig.5 .",
    "the same feature was found for the high - frequency spectrum when the b- and c - lines are resolved .",
    "this striking effect of the nonmagnetic ligand atom on the echo formation may be related to a rather strong isotropic hyperfine interaction between @xmath2o nuclear spin and the mn electron spin system with long - range af spin order .",
    "the detailed analysis of the spectra measured below @xmath9 requires additional studies which are now in progress .",
    "based on the site assignment considered above we propose the following picture of the development of spin correlation in the pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 co pm phase as seen by @xmath2o nmr . in the low - temperature part of the co pm phase the nmr spectrum represents the spin density distribution on oxygen ions .",
    "its value is determined not just by the mn effective magnetic moment but , to a greater extent , by the type of spin correlations of the neighboring mn atoms .",
    "the presence of several lines in nmr spectrum , which can be attributed to the various oxygen sites in the lattice , shows that the corresponding spin correlations and effective magnetic moment of the neighboring cations do not change at the time scale @xmath152 - line splitting ) @xcite .",
    "the thermally activated hopping of @xmath12-holes seems to be the main mechanism changing the charge state of the ion ( mn@xmath17-mn@xmath18 ) and the spin correlations between the neighboring ions , which results in the `` melting '' of oo in co pm phase . with increasing temperature the fine structure of the spectrum",
    "is smeared as the corresponding correlation time @xmath153 of the specific hoping becomes comparable with @xmath154 . as a result the various spin configurations are no more distinguishable at higher temperature .",
    "the splitting of the nmr spectrum just below @xmath6 into the a- and ( b+c)-lines may be explained as follows . as has been mentioned above the oxygen nuclei responsible for a - line are located between two af correlated mn ions from adjacent ab - plane whereas those responsible for ( b+c)-line have two neighboring mn ions in the same ab - plane .",
    "the resolution of a - line shows that just below @xmath6 the correlation time of the af correlated spin of neighboring mn from adjacent ab - planes becomes long compared to the nmr time scale . by contrast ( b+c)-line is still unresolved just below @xmath6 .",
    "thus in the first stage of the charge ordering the three - dimensional ( 3d ) motion of eg - electrons transforms preferentially into a two - dimensional ( 2d ) hopping within the ab - planes .",
    "such an ordering phase transition may be considered as the nucleation of af ordered clusters which grow at the expense of the cd pm phase which dominates above @xmath6 .",
    "furthermore as the temperature decreases and the unresolved ( b+c)-line is shifted toward high frequency a shoulder appears on the low frequency part ( see spectra for @xmath155 at fig .",
    "the temperature dependence of this signal follows the same curie - weiss law as the peak in the cd pm phase ( dashed line in figs . 2 , 3 ) .",
    "its relative intensity decreases with temperature and becomes negligible only near @xmath9 .",
    "this may indicate that almost down to @xmath9 traces of the cd pm phase remain in the co pm phase .",
    "the proposed nmr interpretation of the ordering in the co pm phase is in a good agreement with the main results of the resonant x - ray @xcite and neutron diffraction studies @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "it should be noted that the time scales required to get a quasi - static picture of charge distribution in nmr @xmath156 and in neutron diffraction @xmath157 experiments are very different .",
    "both methods confirm the presence of fm correlations between mn as dominant spin fluctuations in the cd pm phase which reduce in intensity below @xmath6 . in the neutron scattering experiments",
    "the short - range fm correlations are considered as a static whereas it is seen still as a low - frequency dynamic phenomenon in the nmr spectra . in conclusion ,",
    "the distribution of spin density and the development of the charge and orbital ordering in the paramagnetic state of pr@xmath0ca@xmath0mno@xmath1 were studied for the first time by means of @xmath2o nmr .",
    "it is shown that the main interaction of oxygen is the isotropic hyperfine fermi - contact interaction with the s - electron spin density transferred from the nearest - neighboring mn ions .",
    "the resulting magnetic line shift is very sensitive to both the electronic configuration of the neighboring cation ( mn@xmath158/mn@xmath18 ) and to their specific spin - pair correlations that develop on cooling in the charge and orbital ordered pm phase .",
    "it is shown that with increasing temperature the melting of the orbital ordering first develops within the ab - plane whereas the af correlations between mn ions in adjacent layers are more stable and disappear only when t approaches @xmath6 .",
