    "galaxy clusters have long been considered one of the most important cosmological probes due to their privileged position in the hierarchical formation scenario as the most massive and virialized objects . as such",
    ", galaxy clusters can inform important tests of the standard concordance cosmological model , and provide unique laboratories for the understanding of dark matter ( dm ) properties ( see @xcite , for a review ) .",
    "for example , the number density of galaxy clusters is sensitive to the amplitude of the primordial density fluctuations , and can therefore be used as a powerful tool for estimating cosmological parameters , so long as the masses and redshifts of clusters are measured with good precision @xcite .    in recent years",
    "extensive efforts have been made to determine the mass and redshift distribution of samples of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "most of these mass measurements are based on baryonic signatures  e.g. optical light , x - ray emission , and the sunyaev zeldovich effect ( sze ) . however , there are pernicious systematic uncertainties that affect these baryonic signatures , which trace only a small fraction of the total matter content of galaxy clusters . the most robust and direct way to map the total ( baryonic and dark ) matter distribution in galaxy clusters is through the analysis of gravitational lensing effects , whereby background galaxy profiles are modified by the gravitational potential of foreground clusters , producing shape distortions and apparent flux magnification ( see reviews by *",

    "* ) .    in the outer regions of galaxy clusters the gravitational potential produces only tiny distortions that do not constrain the cluster profile individually , and",
    "therefore it is necessary to perform statistical measurements of the distortions affecting large ensembles of background galaxies .",
    "this is the so - called weak lensing ( wl ) regime , and the application of wl measurements has become a powerful tool in the recent years @xcite . in the innermost region of clusters  the strong lensing ( sl ) regime  the mass density can be high enough to produce dramatic distortions in the form of giant elongated arcs or multiple images of background sources , which can inform high - precision mass reconstruction studies of the cluster core ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ". statistical analysis of samples of galaxy clusters that exhibit the hallmarks  giant arcs and multiply - imaged sources  of strong lensing can also be used in tests of the @xmath6cdm cosmological model .",
    "for example , several different studies comparing observations and predictions for the abundance of giant arcs ( `` giant arc statistics '' ) find that simulations under - predict the number of giant arcs on the sky by perhaps as much as an order of magnitude @xcite .",
    "in addition to their cosmological applications , the large magnification effects that typically act on strongly lensed background galaxies allows the study of high - redshift galaxies which would otherwise be too faint to be observed .",
    "however , cases of bright , high - magnification strong lensing remain relatively rare phenomena , occurring in a only small fraction of galaxy clusters @xcite .",
    "it is therefore always valuable to identify and follow - up new samples of strong lensing galaxy clusters .",

    "the _ p_-values for the ds test are calculated as in @xcite ; by comparing the observed substructure estimator @xmath142 to the shuffled values @xmath143 , which are computed by randomly shuffling the observed velocities and reassigning these values to the member positions via 1000 monte carlo ( mc ) simulations , and by taking @xmath144 .",
    "p_-values are given by    @xmath145    where @xmath146 is the number of mc simulations used to compute the probability .",
    "the statistic of the ds test is performed by 100 realizations of the process above , with the central value given by the mean of the _ p_-values distribution and the uncertainties given by the upper and lower @xmath147 confidence intervals .",
    "one can see from eq .",
    "[ eq : p_values_ds ] that clusters with significant substructure will have low _ p_-values , since it is unlikely to obtain @xmath142 randomly .",
    "we have therefore set the threshold for substructure detection to a significance level ( s.l . ) of 0.05 within uncertainties , where false detections are not expected given the size of our sample @xcite .",
    "the results are listed in table [ table : vel_disp_m200_summary ] .",
    "there are 10 out of 24 clusters ( @xmath5 ) that have rejected the null hypothesis , indicating signs of dynamical substructure which is consistent with previous optical and x - ray studies of local clusters @xcite .",
    "however , high values of @xmath148 might also be obtained when the velocities are shuffled , leading to a higher probability - to - exceed or a lower significance detection of substructure , resulting in erroneous assumptions that are consistent with no substructure @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the ds test ( and almost all substructure indicators ) is highly viewing - angle dependent which complicates the inferences about the dynamical state of the clusters .",
    "since substructure does not affect the velocity dispersion measurements when the clusters under consideration have a uni - modal velocity distribution @xcite , we apply the kolmogorov - smirnov test ( ks ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) to those clusters in our sample with @xmath5 , to corroborate whether their velocity distributions are consistent with a gaussian distribution .",
    "the ks test is a non - parametric hypothesis test based on the _ supremum _ statistics that measures the distance between the empirical distribution function ( edf ) of a sample and the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of a chosen reference distribution .",
    "we set the mean and variance of the reference distribution to the mean velocity and velocity dispersion squared of each cluster , respectively .",
    "the statistic of the ks test is calculated by 5000 bootstrapped realizations of the velocity data of each cluster , with the final probability given by the mean of the _ p_-values distribution and the uncertainties given by the upper and lower @xmath147 confidence intervals . the threshold for rejecting the null hypothesis , that the sample is drawn from the reference distribution ,",
    "is set to a s.l .",
    "of 0.05 within uncertainties .",
    "the velocity distributions of 23 out of 24 clusters ( with @xmath5 ) show high _ p_-values , suggesting that the deviation between the velocity data of these clusters and a gaussian distribution is smaller than one would expect to arise from two different distributions .",
    "we therefore assume that the velocity distributions of these 23 sl clusters are uni - modal ; consequently , we can conclude that their velocity dispersion measurements are robust and that their the mass estimates are representative of their total masses , i.e. eq . [ eq : mass_evrard08 ] is valid for this subset .",
    "the results are listed in table [ table : vel_disp_m200_summary ] . for completeness",
    ", we also apply a gaussian fit to the binned data of the velocity histograms of these clusters . in all cases ,",
    "the best - fitting gaussian parameters are consistent with the mean velocity and velocity dispersion squared within @xmath149 , although the fit usually depends on the choice of the bin width .",
    "their velocity histograms together with their respective gaussian fits are shown in figure [ fig : vel_hist_1 ] and figure [ fig : vel_hist_2 ] , in appendix [ appendix : vel_hist ] .",
    "rcs2 j0309@xmath151437 is the only system in our sample ( with @xmath5 ) where the null hypothesis of the ks test is rejected , suggesting that its velocity data is not consistent with a uni - modal distribution .",
    "nonetheless , we list its velocity dispersion and virial mass in table [ table : vel_disp_m200_summary ] , along with the estimates for five systems with relatively few spectroscopically confirmed cluster members ( @xmath150 ) .",
    "it should be noted that the measurements for these six systems represent only a first guess and should not be considered as the final estimates .",
    "the velocity histograms for these clusters are shown in figure [ fig : vel_hist_3 ] , in appendix [ appendix : vel_hist ] .",
    "observational and theoretical studies have shown that velocity dispersion profiles are flat from @xmath151 @xmath119 outward @xcite , and highly biased in the innermost regions of the clusters ( @xmath134 @xmath119 ) . hence , estimating the effect of this potential sampling bias requires the knowledge of the virial radius for each cluster and also its projected angular size on the sky .",
    "we derive the virial radius of all clusters in our sample by assuming spherical symmetry ] and using the previous results of @xmath152 ( i.e. @xmath153 ) , resulting in a median virial radius of @xmath154 mpc h@xmath12 that corresponds to an angular size on the sky of @xmath155 .",
    "since our field of view has an average angular radius of @xmath156 from the cluster centers , we are sampling cluster galaxies till approximately @xmath157 @xmath119 of the clusters .",
    "therefore , the field restriction should not bias our results because the flatness of the velocity dispersion profiles begins to smaller radii .",
    "furthermore , since we are mainly sampling cluster members on average within @xmath158 @xmath119 ( figure [ fig : velocities_vs_r_mem ] ) , the probability to include interlopers is approximately @xmath159 lower than for sampling till twice @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "+      the number of cluster members plays a decisive role in the analysis of dynamical cluster properties and velocity dispersion measurements @xcite .",
    "@xcite , using high resolution n - body simulations , studied the stability of the cluster velocity dispersion as a function of the number of subhalos used to estimate it .",
    "they found that the results are generally stable once @xmath160 subhalos are included ; however , there is an intrinsic scatter of @xmath161 between the line - of - sight velocity dispersion and the dm halo velocity dispersion , mainly due to the halo triaxiality .",
    "they also found that the line - of - sight velocity dispersion is biased low when a small number of subhalos is used ( increasing the scatter ) , but estimates with @xmath5 tend asymptotically to the true velocity dispersion of clusters .",
    "indeed , there is a general consensus in the literature that identifying on the order of 20 member galaxies is sufficient to derive the velocity dispersion of clusters @xcite , although there could be a @xmath162 underestimation if only brighter galaxies are used , indicating that dynamical friction of brighter galaxies has a significant impact on the measured velocity dispersion @xcite .    as mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : results ] , we have recovered a total of 1004 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members , which gives us an average of @xmath61 35 member galaxies per cluster . therefore , we could assume that our estimates represent the `` true '' line - of - sight velocity dispersion of our clusters based on the studies above .",
    "however , we need to explore if these measurements are affected by dynamical friction since our spectroscopic strategy was to prioritize brighter galaxies ahead of fainter ones . in order to probe this possible systematic bias",
    ", we analyze the behavior of the velocity dispersion as a function of the number of brighter cluster members of 6 clusters from our sample with @xmath163 .",
    "we rank the member galaxies according to their absolute @xmath164band magnitude and calculate the line - of - sight velocity dispersion using the brightest galaxies from @xmath165 to @xmath166 .",
    "we plot the resultant velocity dispersions @xmath167 in figure [ fig : veldisp_vs_nmem_clusters ] ( top panel ) , normalized by the final dispersion @xmath126 , obtained using all available cluster members .",
    "as showed by previous studies , the scatter between @xmath167 and @xmath126 increases considerably for a lower number of cluster members ( @xmath168 ) , showing a clear underestimation of @xmath21 when @xmath169 . for measurements using @xmath5",
    ", the scatter is almost symmetric , i.e. the bias introduced by using only a fraction of the total number of member galaxies may underestimate or overestimate the `` true '' line - of - sight velocity dispersions , and whether the bias is from above or below depends upon the cluster under consideration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "therefore , estimates using @xmath5 are only slightly affected by dynamical friction ; pointing out that the most likely effect that is affecting our measurements should be associated to the lack of galaxy tracers .    to corroborate these conclusions , we repeat the previous process but choosing the member galaxies randomly with respect to their absolute @xmath170band magnitude .",
    "the results are shown in the bottom panel of figure [ fig : veldisp_vs_nmem_clusters ] .",
    "in this figure one can easily see that for estimates using @xmath5 , the scatter around the `` true '' line - of - sight velocity dispersion is symmetric and similar to the scatter obtained when cluster members are sorted by their brightness .",
    "therefore , we can assume that velocity dispersion estimates are mainly affected by the lack of cluster members rather than by dynamical friction .",
    "indeed , in both cases of figure [ fig : veldisp_vs_nmem_clusters ] , the average scatter is of the order of @xmath171 when @xmath172 is equal to the average number of cluster members , i.e. @xmath173 .",
    "it is to be noted that this @xmath174 of scatter should be considered as the lower scatter that we should include in our velocity dispersion estimates in order to take into account the lack of cluster members .",
    "but we leave this discussion for future observational and simulation studies , where we could compare results from a larger number of cluster members with specific simulations for the sl galaxy cluster population .",
    "it is well known that virialized halos that host galaxy clusters are triaxial @xcite , with the major axis approximately twice as long as the minor axes which are approximately equal in size .",
    "this prolate shape could potentially lead to a bias in the velocity dispersion estimates because the velocity tensor is quite anisotropic and generally well aligned with the inertia tensor , with a typical misalignment angle of @xmath175 @xcite . in other words , viewing along the major axis may contribute to a higher velocity dispersion , while the two minor axes to lower values ; hence , the final measurements depend significantly on the chosen line - of - sight .",
    "in fact , numerical simulations have shown that , although the 3d velocity dispersion of dm particles within @xmath119 is well correlated with @xmath152 and the galaxies show little velocity bias compared to the dm particles , the line - of - sight velocity dispersions show a considerably larger scatter and the mass estimates from these measurements are biased with respect to the true values @xcite .    studies based on simulations of sl halos have shown that the most effective strong lenses are not more triaxial than the general halo population @xcite ; however , they are more likely to have their major axes aligned along the line - of - sight .",
    "therefore , we should assume that the velocity dispersion estimates for a sample of sl - selected clusters will be biased high with respect to the velocity dispersions measured for clusters that are randomly oriented on the sky .",
    "however , the intrinsic misalignment between the halo positional ellipsoid and the velocity tensor introduces an element of randomization in the orientation of the velocity tensor with respect to the line - of - sight that reduces the impact of the orientation bias .",
    "specific predictions for the magnitude of this bias require the convolution of the probability distributions for the position orientation angle of the sl - selected clusters with their velocity principal axes .",
    "since we do not have these probability distributions , we leave this additional correction for future analyses and as in the previous section , we do not include this extra uncertainty in our estimates .",
    "but it is important to note that our line - of - sight velocity dispersion measurements should have , at least , a scatter of the same order as found by @xcite for the normal cluster population , i.e. a scatter of the order of @xmath176 between the line - of - sight and 3d velocity dispersions .",
    "we have conducted a large spectroscopic follow - up program of 29 sl - selected galaxy clusters discovered in the rcs-2 survey .",
    "our spectroscopic analysis has revealed the nature of 52 gravitational arcs present in the core of our galaxy clusters , which correspond to 35 background sources at high - redshifts that are clearly distorted by the gravitational potential of these clusters .",
    "these lensed galaxies span a wide redshift range of @xmath0 , with a median redshift of @xmath177 , that matches the expectations .",
    "this dataset extends the number of galaxy clusters with spectroscopic confirmation of their sl features that are available to perform lensing reconstructions of their mass distribution , especially at @xmath56 .",
    "this campaign has also yielded a total of 1004 spectroscopically confirmed cluster members that gives an average of @xmath61 35 member galaxies per cluster .",
    "these data allow us to obtain robust redshifts for each cluster and measure velocity dispersions with relatively high confidence level , which are translated into dynamical masses by using the @xcite @xmath2 scaling relation .",
    "the redshift and mass ranges of our sl sample are distributed from @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively .",
    "these wide redshift and mass ranges allow diverse kinds of studies : from the analysis of the relationship between the concentration of the cluster halos and their masses to studies of galaxy evolution in cluster environments .",
    "we have analyzed some effects that could affect our velocity dispersion measurements , such as the presence of substructure in our clusters , the region where cluster members were selected , the final number of confirmed members , and the line - of - sight effects .",
    "our primary conclusions are :    * we found that 10 out of 24 of our clusters , where analysis is possible , show signs of dynamical substructure , which is consistent with previous optical and x - ray studies of local clusters .",
    "the velocity distributions of 23 of these clusters are consistent with a uni - modal distribution and we therefore assumed that eq .",
    "[ eq : mass_evrard08 ] is applicable to these sl clusters in our sample .",
    "* we sampled cluster member galaxies within the inner @xmath178 @xmath119 of the clusters , which did not bias our results due to the flatness of the velocity dispersion profiles from @xmath179 @xmath119 . furthermore , since we mainly sampled cluster members within the virial radius , the probability to include interlopers is approximately @xmath159 lower than for sampling up to twice @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "* we have found that using @xmath5 , our velocity dispersion estimates are mainly affected by the lack of galaxy tracers rather than by dynamical friction .",
    "we found that in both cases , sorting the cluster members by their brightness or randomly , the scatter is symmetric and of the order of @xmath171 when @xmath180 .",
    "however , it is only a first guess of the magnitude of this potential bias .",
    "a better understanding of this effect needs deeper studies of the galaxy kinematics in sl clusters .    summing up",
    ", we have found that our velocity dispersion measurements should be affected by the lack of cluster members as well as by the scatter between the line - of - sight and 3d velocity dispersion .",
    "however , specific predictions for the magnitude of these biases require an improvement in both simulation and observational studies , with larger simulations oriented to the sl galaxy cluster population and more spectroscopic information of the cluster members . even though our measurements may be biased or",
    "may have large uncertainties , which are translated into large errors in the mass estimates , they serve as a base for a better understanding of the sl cluster properties . furthermore , these dynamical masses can be used as _",
    "priors _ for mass reconstruction studies , that combined with sl signatures yield one of the most robust measurements of the mass distribution of sl clusters .",
    "a complete characterization of the properties and biases of this population is crucial for taking full advantage of future sl samples coming from a new era of large area deep imaging surveys ( e.g. panstarrs , lsst , des ) .",
    "the data and analysis presented in this work represent the first steps in this direction and also pave the way for multi - wavelength studies , i.e. when sl information is combined with wl , dynamical masses , x - ray , and sze data .",
    "these kinds of studies will allow us to quantify the biases between the different observable masses in order to fully exploit the additional information provided by sl signatures , which can then be intelligently applied to scaling relations and mass estimates for the general cluster population .",

    "<S> we present an extensive spectroscopic follow - up campaign of 29 strong lensing ( sl ) selected galaxy clusters discovered primarily in the second red - sequence cluster survey ( rcs-2 ) . our spectroscopic analysis yields redshifts for 52 gravitational arcs present in the core of our galaxy clusters , which correspond to 35 distinct background sources that are clearly distorted by the gravitational potential of these clusters . </S>",
    "<S> these lensed galaxies span a wide redshift range of @xmath0 , with a median redshift of @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> we also measure reliable redshifts for 1004 cluster members , allowing us to obtain robust velocity dispersion measurements for 23 of these clusters , which we then use to determine their dynamical masses by using a simulation - based @xmath2 scaling relation . </S>",
    "<S> the redshift and mass ranges covered by our sl sample are @xmath3 and @xmath4 , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze and quantify some possible effects that might bias our mass estimates , such as the presence of substructure , the region where cluster members are selected for spectroscopic follow - up , the final number of confirmed members , and line - of - sight effects . </S>",
    "<S> we find that 10 clusters of our sample with @xmath5 show signs of dynamical substructure . </S>",
    "<S> however , the velocity data of only one system is inconsistent with a uni - modal distribution . </S>",
    "<S> we therefore assume that the substructures are only marginal and not of comparable size to the clusters themselves . </S>",
    "<S> consequently , our velocity dispersion and mass estimates can be used as _ priors _ for sl mass reconstruction studies and also represent an important step toward a better understanding of the properties of the sl galaxy cluster population . </S>"
