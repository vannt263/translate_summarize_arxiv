    "in the study of the phase behavior of colloidal mixtures there are two very distinct approaches . from a theoretical point of view",
    "one would like to keep the description of the mixture as simple as possible in order to be able to calculate the phase diagram using well established theoretical tools .",
    "furthermore , it is possible to _ understand _ the main physics , i.e. the phase behavior , bulk correlation functions , or inhomogeneous density distributions , in simple terms .",
    "one example of such an theoretical approach is the asakura - oosawa - vrij ( aov ) model for colloid - polymer mixtures.@xcite within the aov model , colloids are treated as hard spheres , while polymer behave like hard spheres only when interacting with colloids .",
    "the polymer - polymer interaction vanishes .",
    "based on this model , one finds that the phase diagram of a colloid - polymer mixture , assuming perfectly monodisperse colloids and polymer , resembles that of a simple fluid , and the reservoir polymer density plays the role of an inverse temperature .",
    "one , relatively simple but successful , theoretical approach for treating the phase behavior of this model colloid - polymer mixture is the free - volume theory ( fvt ) that assumes a low concentration of the depletion agent , the polymer.@xcite    a very different picture of the phase behavior of colloidal mixture originates from experimental studies . while in some cases it is possible to prepare model systems with almost monodisperse colloids and polymer,@xcite the generic case of a colloidal sample is polydisperse due to imperfections of the synthesis process .",
    "polydispersity can be found both in size and in shape distributions . from the theoretical point of view",
    ", polydispersity is often considered as a defect , because it complicates calculations . however , polydispersity can give rise to interesting behavior , which can be utilized in experiments,@xcite if the role of polydispersity is sufficiently well understood .",
    "one example is the study of the glass transition , where polydispersity in model hard colloidal spheres has the role as to suppress the freezing transition at high density of colloids so that a glass can form.@xcite    there are various very different ways to achieve a successful description . for hard and permeable spheres salacuse and",
    "stell@xcite showed a thermodynamic approach based on the percus - yevick equation of state and the more accurate approach by mansoori _",
    "et al_. the polydispersity in the chain - length of self - excluding polymer has been treated in ref .  .",
    "polydispersity has been incorporated in the theory in different manner .",
    "near - monodisperse distributions have been treated in a perturbative fashion@xcite and bimodal size distributions has been studied in ref .  .",
    "in the present study we wish to increase the understanding of effects that can be caused by polydispersity further . to this end",
    "we consider a mixture of monodisperse colloidal spheres with a polydisperse depletion agent .",
    "we keep the theory simple by assuming that the depletion agent is efficient and can produce a sufficiently strong depletion attraction between colloidal spheres at rather low concentrations . in this limit we can generalize the free - volume theory within the framework of fundamental measure theory@xcite ( fmt ) to cases of polydisperse size or shape distributions .    as an application of our general and powerful approach we study the phase behavior of a ternary mixture of ( monodisperse ) colloidal spheres with two polydisperse polymer components with distinct size difference .",
    "our study shows that the distribution of the depletion agent can be employed to tune the phase behavior of colloidal mixtures in a wide range and it is possible to generate a third fluid phase . beside the low density ( in colloids ) gas and a high density liquid , we find a low density liquid phase .",
    "this is similar to findings in systems in which two length scales are introduced in the inter - particle interaction potentials.@xcite    the paper is structured as follows . in section  [ sec::theory ]",
    "we recall the theoretical basics of free - volume theory within the framework of fmt .",
    "we extend the approach of ref .   to treat discrete and continuous distributions of the depletion agent . in section  [ sec::distributions ]",
    "we discuss a few distribution functions which are frequently used in studies of polydisperse systems and show that for infinitely thin needles or platelets various types of size distributions lead to explicit expressions for the effective free - volume fraction @xmath0 . in section  [ sec::results ]",
    "we show and discuss as an application of our theory the phase diagrams for the case of a ternary mixture of ( monodisperse ) colloidal spheres and two polydisperse polymer components .",
    "we discuss the results and conclude in section  [ sec::discussion ] .",
    "we study mixtures of colloidal spheres immersed in a solvent of depletion agent .",
    "the latter component can possess a polydisperse size or shape distribution . here",
    "we are mainly interested in mixtures where the depletion potential between the spheres is strongly attractive already at rather low concentrations of the depletion agent . in this case",
    "we can employ the description of asakura , oosawa@xcite and vrij@xcite for the mutual particle interactions , which keeps the model simple .",
    "the colloid - colloid and the colloid - depletion agent interactions are modeled as hard - core interactions , while the mutual interaction between particles of the depletion agent vanish .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the phase behavior of the asakura - oosawa - vrij model is closely related to the free - volume theory , in which the excess free energy of the mixture is expanded up to first order in the density of the depletion agent .",
    "this linearization of the excess free energy is equivalent to a vanishing interaction among particles of the depletion agent . as fmt@xcite provides a good framework for the free - volume theory we first recall its main ideas as presented in refs .   and for discrete mixtures and generalize it to continuous distributions of the depletion agent .      in order to describe the phase behavior of colloidal mixtures one has first to choose the thermodynamic ensemble . for our purpose",

    "furthermore , we have verified that it is possible to generate two critical points and hence _ three _ fluid phases by using a depletion agent of different than spherical shape .",
    "we have generalized a novel approach to free - volume theory@xcite based on fmt@xcite to treat a depletion agent of arbitrarily shaped particles with a continuous distribution . here , we introduced one parameter , @xmath55 , to specify a continuously varying distribution of depletion agent .    to evaluate the phase diagram within fvt an expression for the free - volume fraction",
    "is required . in the case of polydisperse size or shape distributions for the depletion agent",
    ", one can obtain an _ effective _ free - volume fraction , which in general has to be calculated numerically . in the cases of infinitely thin needles or platelets it is possible to get explicit expressions for the effective free - volume fraction for various distributions which are of interest from an experimental and a theoretical point of view .",
    "we give some expressions for @xmath0 in appendix  [ app::explicitexpressions ] .    beside size polydispersity",
    ", we have also considered _ shape _ polydispersity . to this end",
    "we have calculated phase diagrams of a mixture of colloidal spheres with penetrable ellipsoids with half - axes @xmath145 and @xmath114 .",
    "our results confirm that polydispersity has the tendency to stabilize the fluid - fluid coexistence region w.r.t .",
    "we have discussed this trend , in agreement with earlier studies,@xcite in section  [ sec::sizepoly ] for size polydisperse spherical polymer coils . in section  [ sec::shapepoly ]",
    "we have shown that similar behavior can be found for the case of shape polydisperse case . upon increasing the degree of polydispersity the fluid - fluid binodal `` crosses '' the fluid - solid coexistence line and one obtains a stable critical point with associated liquid and gas phases and a triple point .",
    "this effect seems to be robust against various ways to incorporate polydispersity , which can be rationalized by the fact that particles of a polydisperse depletion agent can fill the available free volume in a system better than a monodisperse species .",
    "our main result is the study of mixtures of colloids and two species of polydisperse ( spherical ) polymer coils .",
    "the polymer were described by a bimodal distribution consisting of two polydisperse distributions . for the averaged size ratios of the polymer components chosen here , i.e. @xmath146 and @xmath106 , we find in distinct parts of the phase diagram fluid - fluid phase separations in the two limiting cases @xmath104 , when only the smaller polymer species is present , and @xmath103 , when only the larger polymer species is present . for @xmath103",
    "the corresponding fluid - fluid phase separation is stable independent of the degree of polydispersity . in the second limiting case ,",
    "@xmath104 , the fluid - fluid phase separation has to be stabilized by a sufficient degree of polydispersity .",
    "we choose @xmath122 and find for a range of the mixing parameter @xmath99 two stable liquid phases : beside the gas phase , which is diluted in the density of colloids , we find a low density and a high density liquid phase .",
    "the fluid - fluid coexistence region is w - shaped in this case and the phase diagram exhibits two stable critical points and two triple points .    for systems for which the inter - particle interactions contains two length scales , such as short - range repulsion and long - range attraction , hemmer and stell@xcite found that two stable critical points may occur .",
    "more directly related to our situation is a system of star polymers@xcite in which similar features in the phase diagrams are reported , as the effective interaction potential is comparable to those of the model of stell and hemmer . for other model fluids",
    "similar effects were observed.@xcite we point out that our findings are not restricted to a polydisperse depletion agent .",
    "we find similar results for a ternary mixture in which we consider one colloid species and two distinct monodisperse species of depletion agent .    while often size or shape polydispersity is considered an undesirable side - effect , originating from imperfections of particle synthesis , it is possible to make use of this property by stabilizing fluid - fluid phase separations .",
    "moreover , the degree of polydispersity allows one to adjust the phase diagram . from this point of view",
    "one might speculate about fine tuning the phase behavior of colloidal mixtures by specifying the polydisperse distribution of the depletion agent .",
    "explicit expressions for the effective free - volume fraction in the case of infinitely thin needles for the schulz , gaussian and hat - like distributions , eqs .",
    "( [ eqn::schulzdist])-([eqn::hatlikedist ] ) , read      since only @xmath44 and @xmath148 enter these expressions for a one - dimensional depletion agent , there is no difference between an approach based on the py or the bmcsl equation of state . in terms of the colloid packing fraction @xmath19 , average asymmetry ratio @xmath71 and the polydispersity parameter @xmath68",
