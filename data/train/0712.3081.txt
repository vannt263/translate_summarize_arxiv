    "a riemann ellipsoid is a relative equilibrium for a dynamical model of a rotating self - gravitating fluid mass that remains an ellipsoid at all times , and for which the fluid velocity is a linear function of the coordinates .",
    "this model , first studied and formulated by dirichlet , is nowadays known as dirichlet s model .",
    "the linearity assumption on the allowed motions makes the study of these deformable bodies very attractive since it implies that their dynamics is governed by a system of ordinary differential equations with a finite number of degrees of freedom .",
    "these bodies are also known as affine - rigid bodies or pseudo - rigid bodies .",
    "dirichlet s model can be viewed as a first order model for the study of the shape of the earth , and the study of the stability of its solutions can be used in planetary stability research .",
    "the study of self - gravitating fluid masses has a long history which can be traced back to newton s times with many contributions from dirichlet , maclaurin , jacobi , dedekind , riemann , liapunov , poincar and cartan , just to name a few .",
    "we can distinguish two classical approaches to the study of the stability of riemann ellipsoids .",
    "one initiated independently in the latter part of the nineteenth century by poincar @xcite and liapunov @xcite who used expansions in spherical and ellipsoidal harmonics to study the stability of maclaurin ellipsoids and jacobi ellipsoids , not only under dirichlet s assumptions but also under more general conditions ( allowing perturbations not preserving the ellipsoidal shape ) .",
    "the other approach occurred in the middle of the twentieth century with the works of chandrasekhar and collaborators who developed the so - called virial method by applying it to the study of the linear stability of riemann ellipsoids .",
    "these works are collected in the book of chandrasekhar @xcite which constitutes a comprehensive survey on the subject and related problems with many historical facts on this model .    in recent times",
    "the subject has had the attention of several researchers , in particular in what respects to the application of new formulations and methods ( @xcite ) to study rotating deformable bodies , not only subject to the self - gravitating potential but also for other potentials modelling nuclei ( see for instance @xcite ) , or elastic bodies ( see @xcite and @xcite ) .",
    "our aim is to use geometric methods not only to obtain a complete characterization of the conditions for the existence of riemann ellipsoids having configurations with at least two equal axes but also to obtain the complete description of their nonlinear stability .",
    "these geometric methods exploit the geometry and symmetries of the problem and its hamiltonian structure .",
    "some works using the same philosophical approach to dirichlet s model are available in the literature for studying several aspects of the problem such as in @xcite which obtains riemann s theorem as a consequence of the symmetry alone , or @xcite where some results on the formal stability and bifurcations of maclaurin spheroids are obtained .",
    "we do not address the problem of the stability for riemann ellipsoids with three distinct axes for which the self - gravitating potential is an elliptic integral . in @xcite",
    "this has been studied employing numerical analysis techniques .",
    "we view dirichlet s model as a hamiltonian system where hamilton s function , @xmath0 , has the form kinetic plus potential energy and is defined on the cotangent bundle , @xmath1 , of the set of all @xmath2 matrices of determinant 1 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath0 is invariant for the action of @xmath3 on the phase space .",
    "the @xmath4 symmetry reflects the existence of two conserved vector quantities ( by noether s theorem ) : the angular momentum and circulation .",
    "the @xmath5 symmetry reflects the reciprocity theorem of dedekind : interchanging the angular velocity and vorticity vectors one obtains another ( physically different ) solution for dirichlet s model with the same geometric configuration .",
    "it is well known that noether s conserved quantities are organized as the components of the momentum map . in the case of relative equilibria with configurations having at least two equal axes ( symmetric configurations )",
    "the corresponding momentum map value can be singular .",
    "recently , one of the authors developed in @xcite a method appropriated for the study of nonlinear stability of this kind of relative equilibria .",
    "this construction extends the so - called reduced energy - momentum method of simo , lewis and marsden @xcite to the case of singular relative equilibria and so we will refer to the method @xcite as the singular reduced energy - momentum method .",
    "this is the approach we use in this work to study the nonlinear stability of riemann ellipsoids with symmetric configurations .",
    "the preliminary sections of the paper are organized as follow : in section  [ sec geometric formulation ] we give the geometric formulation of dirichlet s model , in section  [ sec singular reduced ] the singular reduced energy - momentum method is briefly reviewed and in section [ sec potential ] we compute the augmented potential energy for symmetric configurations , as a necessary step towards the stability analysis .",
    "the main results of the paper are in the following two sections . in section  [ sec existence ] ,",
    "theorem  [ theorem existence ] , we give the complete characterization of all the possible riemann ellipsoids with symmetric configurations . we prove that for dirichlet s model the only relative equilibria with configurations having at least two equal axes are : the spherical configuration which has zero angular momentum and circulation , the _ maclaurin spheroids _ which are oblate spheroids rotating around the ( shortest ) symmetry axis and have angular momentum and circulation aligned with it , and the _ transversal spheroids _ , which have prolate spheroidal configurations that rotate around an axis , say @xmath6 , perpendicular to the ( longest ) symmetry axis and have angular momentum and circulation aligned with @xmath6 .",
    "we also prove that there are no symmetric relative equilibria for which the angular velocity and vorticity are not aligned with a principal axis of the relative equilibrium configuration .",
    "that is , there are not symmetric configurations which are not of type s in chandrasekhar s terminology .    in section  [ sec stability ]",
    "we apply the singular reduced energy - momentum method to the study of the nonlinear stability of the relative equilibria found in the previous section .",
    "the main results of this section are theorems  [ spherical stability ] , [ maclaurin stability ] and [ transversal stability ] giving respectively necessary and sufficient conditions for the nonlinear stability of the spherical equilibrium , maclaurin spheroids and transversal spheroids .",
    "our results on the eccentricity range for the nonlinear @xmath7-stability of the maclaurin spheroids agree with those already obtained by liapunov and poincar ( see remark [ rem maclaurin ] ) . in the works of these authors",
    "there is no reference to the transversal spheroids , however their existence is acknowledged in pag .",
    "143 of chandrasekhar s book @xcite .",
    "it is not clear for us what are the results obtained by chandrasekhar with respect to the stability of the transversal spheroids , however his use of the virial method only gives linear stability . to the best of our knowledge , our result on the nonlinear stability of the transversal spheroids is new .    in conclusion",
    ", this work presents , from a purely geometric point of view , a self - contained and complete study of the nonlinear stability of all symmetric relative equilibria for dirichlet s model . at the same time",
    ", the richness of the model helps to clarify the applicability of the singular reduced energy - momentum method , providing also a methodology for its application to other models like .",

    "we construct a symmetric hamiltonian system on @xmath12 ( which is a manifold equipped with a natural symplectic structure ) as follows : the potential energy @xmath13 can be lifted to @xmath12 with the pullback of the cotangent bundle projection @xmath14 .",
    "we denote this lifted function also by @xmath13 .",
    "the riemannian metric on @xmath10 induces an inner product on each cotangent fiber @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "then the hamiltonian is defined as @xmath17 the @xmath9-action on @xmath10 induces a cotangent - lifted hamiltonian action on @xmath12 with associated equivariant momentum map @xmath18 defined by @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the fundamental vector field on @xmath10 associated to the generator @xmath21 , defined by @xmath22 this momentum map is @xmath23-equivariant in the sense that @xmath24 for every @xmath25 , @xmath26 .",
    "the hamiltonian @xmath0 is @xmath9-invariant for this lifted action ( this follows from the invariance of the metric and of @xmath13 ) .",

    "2 .   @xmath36 is a critical point of @xmath37 ,    where @xmath38 is defined by @xmath39 .",
    "moreover , the momentum @xmath40 of the relative equilibrium is given by @xmath41    note that , in virtue of the above theorem , any relative equilibrium is characterized by a configuration - velocity pair @xmath42 satisfying @xmath43 .",
    "the map @xmath44 is called the _ locked inertia tensor _ , while the function @xmath45 is called the _",
    "augmented potential_. we indicate for later use that the kernel of @xmath44 is precisely @xmath46 , the lie algebra of @xmath47 , the stabilizer of @xmath36 for the @xmath9-action on @xmath10 .",
    "the knowledge of the pair @xmath48 allows us to compute the stabilizer of the corresponding relative equilibrium @xmath49 with the formula ( see @xcite ) : @xmath50    dirichlet s model is a symmetric simple mechanical system for the motion of a homogenous and incompressible fluid mass of density @xmath51 having as reference configuration the unit ball centered at the origin in @xmath52 and subject to the self - gravitating potential .",
    "the only allowed configurations for this model are linear embeddings of the reference ball into @xmath52 preserving volume and orientation .",
    "the configuration manifold @xmath10 for a self - gravitating fluid mass under dirichlet s conditions is then @xmath53 , the group of all @xmath2 matrices with determinant equal to 1 , which is equivalent to the space of orientation and volume preserving linear automorphisms of @xmath52 . in what follows",
    "we review the geometric formulation of dirichlet s model as a symmetric simple mechanical system on @xmath54 , the group of all @xmath2 matrices with positive determinant , with a symmetric holonomic constraint .",
    "the singular value decomposition of any linear automorphism of @xmath52 allows to decompose ( non - uniquely ) any matrix @xmath55 as @xmath56 where @xmath57 , and @xmath58 is a diagonal matrix with positive entries called singular values ( the square roots of the eigenvalues of @xmath59 ) .",
    "it follows from this decomposition that the reference unit ball is mapped by @xmath60 into a solid ellipsoid of equation @xmath61 , having principal axes half - lengths equal to the entries of @xmath58 .",
    "physically the matrix @xmath62 describes the rigid rotation of the body in space relative to an inertial frame and @xmath63 is related to the rigid internal motion of the fluid with respect to a moving frame .",
    "then @xmath58 is an orientation preserving dilatation of the original reference body into an ellipsoid with principal axes aligned with the eigenvectors of @xmath58 .",
    "the condition on the volume preservation of the total embedding corresponds to impose the holonomic constraint @xmath64 ( or equivalently @xmath65 ) , which in turn amounts to consider our system as defined on @xmath53 .",
    "the tangent space at @xmath66 is isomorphic to @xmath67 , the vector space of @xmath2 matrices .",
    "we can define a riemannian metric on @xmath68 as : @xmath69 for @xmath70 , and @xmath71 is a constant depending on the density of the reference body and other physical parameters of the system . in the case of interest here ,",

    "that is , for a given ellipsoid there is an adjoint one , obtained by transposition .",
    "these adjoint type of ellipsoids are called dedekind ellipsoids . more generally , the transposition symmetry interchanges external rotations and internal motions for any solution of dirichlet s model .",
    "any @xmath9-invariant function @xmath97 on @xmath68 can be written as @xmath98 where @xmath99 , and @xmath100 and @xmath101 are the three principal invariants of a @xmath2 matrix , given by @xmath102 with @xmath103 ( also valid interchanging @xmath104 with @xmath59 ) .",

    "the generally adopted notion of stability for relative equilibria of symmetric hamiltonian systems is that of @xmath7-stability , introduced in @xcite and that we now review in the context of symmetric simple mechanical systems .",

    "we outline the implementation of this singular reduced energy - momentum method following @xcite",
    ". our setup will be as in definition [ patrick ] and section 2 .",
    "in particular we will fix a relative equilibrium @xmath31 with configuration - velocity pair @xmath48 and momentum @xmath140 .",
    "we will also assume that the @xmath9-action on @xmath10 is proper and that there exists a @xmath7-invariant complement to @xmath141 in @xmath142 .",
    "these last two conditions are always satisfied for any relative equilibrium in dirichlet s model due to the compactness of @xmath9 .",
