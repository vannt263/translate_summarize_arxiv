    "echo signals probably exist in the light curves of some sorts of astronomical objects , such as supernovae ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* rest   2005 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* krause  2008a ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* krause  2008b ) ) , x - ray binaries ( ( * ? ? ? * greiner 2001 ) ) and agns ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* perterson 1993 ) ) etc .. if the relative location between a central transmitter and a reflecting object is fixed , then auto - correlation ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edelson & krolik 1988 ) ) can be used to detect the reflected signal and estimate the distance thereafter . however , in common situation , the nearby reflecting object is always moving ( ( * ? ? ? * perterson 2008 ) ) , therefore , the delay between transmitted and reflected signal is variable , which means the coherence is broken and no echo signals could be detected by auto - correlation .    here",
    ", we are going to introduce a method which is called transformed auto - correlation .",
    "its aim is to rebuild the coherence and perform cross - correlation between the reflected and transmitted signals .",
    "suppose there are only one transmitter and one reflector , and @xmath0 is a transmitted signal , and @xmath1 is the received signal . since astronomical objects are usually far far away , the received light curve is the combination of transmitted and reflected signals , i.e. , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is reflectance , and @xmath4 is the variable delay which is model dependent , @xmath5 are the parameters of the model .    due to variable delay , a reflected signal will probably loss the coherence to the transmitted signal .",
    "in such situation , it is impossible to detect a reflected signal by auto - correlation .",
    "a transformation is needed to rebuild the coherence .",
    "let s set : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the inversion function of @xmath8 in term of @xmath9 .    applying equation .",
    "[ eqn2 ] and [ eqn3 ] into equation [ eqn1 ] , then we obtain a transformed received signal : @xmath10    * the definition of transformed auto - correlation is the cross - correlation between received signal @xmath1 and its transformation @xmath11 , i.e. * , @xmath12    if the parameters are correct , then after transformation , the reflected signal is coherent to transmitted signal now , with zero delay .",
    "so , only @xmath13 is important .",
    "we can calculate all @xmath13 in a given parametric space .",
    "the significant peaks of @xmath13 may indicate possible reflectors existed nearby the central transmitter , and the true parameters of these reflectors cab be estimated at the same time .",
    "here , an one - dimension simulation is used as an example , where a transmitter is fixed at @xmath14 , and several reflectors are moving or fixed in x axis .",
    "the transmitted signal , generated by convolving a gaussian white noise with a gaussian point spread function ( @xmath15 ) , is stochastic and band - limited .",
    "the sampling interval is @xmath16 . and 2 , 048",
    ", 000 sampled data are generated .",
    "four reflectors are set in the simulation .",
    "the model parameters including initial position , velocity and reflectance are listed in table [ tab1 ] , columns 2 - 4 .",
    ".the parameters of the reflectors .",
    "columns 2 - 4 are values of a model .",
    "columns 5 - 7 are estimated values by transformed auto - correlation . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     a part of received signal and its auto - correlation function are displayed in figure [ fig1 ] . as shown in the auto - correlation function , although there are four reflectors , only one reflector , which is fixed at position of 0.9 light second , has a fringe .",
    "other reflectors have variable delays , so the reflected signals are incoherent to the transmitted signals , and no fringes exist .",
    "now , it is able to search the possible reflectors and their parameters by transformed auto - correlation . here , @xmath17 is normalized by @xmath18",
    ". thus the intensity of the peak of a reflector is equal to reflectance @xmath3 .",
    "the generated map in parametric space ( initial position and velocity ) , which is called reflectance map , is shown in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "it is clearly seen that all of four reflectors have been detected .",
    "the estimated parameters ( initial position , velocity and reflectance ) are listed in table [ tab1 ] , columns 5 - 7 .",
    "the standard deviation of the background in reflectance map is about 0.0036 .",
    "transformed auto - correlation is able to detect reflected signals when there are constant or variable delays . with a priori reflecting model , the parameters ( such as position , velocity etc .. ) of reflectors can also be estimated ."
