    "the theory of abstract spaces of orderings was developed by murray marshall in a series of papers from the late 1970s , and provides an abstract framework for studying orderings of fields and the reduced theory of quadratic forms in general .",
    "the monograph @xcite will be of frequent use here as far as background , notation , and main results are concerned .",
    "spaces of orderings also occur in a natural way in other more general settings : from considering maximal orderings on semi - local rings , orderings on skew fields , or orderings on ternary fields .",
    "the axioms for spaces of orderings have been also generalized in various directions  to quaternionic schemes , to spaces of signatures of higher level , or to abstract real spectra that are used to study orderings on commutative rings .",
    "an elegant first - order description of spaces of orderings is given in @xcite .",
    "here , we prefer to use the earlier description given in @xcite , i.e. , a space of orderings is a pair @xmath3 such that @xmath4 is a nonempty set , @xmath5 is a subgroup of @xmath6 , which contains the constant function @xmath7 , separates points of @xmath4 , and satisfies two additional axioms .",
    "considering @xmath4 as a subset of the character group @xmath8 ( here by characters we mean group homomorphisms @xmath9 ) via the natural embedding @xmath10 obtained by identifying @xmath11 with the character @xmath12 , and denoting , for any pair @xmath13 : @xmath14 the two additional axioms state    1 .   if @xmath15 satisfies @xmath16 , and if @xmath17 then @xmath18 is in the image of the natural embedding @xmath10 , and 2 .",

    "spaces of orderings are easily made into a category by introducing morphisms in the following way : a morphism @xmath20 from a space of orderings @xmath21 to a space of orderings @xmath22 is a function @xmath23 such that @xmath24    in this paper we shall investigate quotient objects in the category of spaces of orderings .",
    "they have been first studied in @xcite and , up to present day , remain rather mysterious creatures : if @xmath3 is a space of orderings , and @xmath25 is a subgroup of @xmath5 containing the element @xmath7 , we denote by @xmath26 the set @xmath27 of all characters from @xmath4 restricted to @xmath25 , and call the pair @xmath28 a quotient structure . in the case when @xmath28 is a space of orderings , we call it a quotient space of @xmath3 . it has been shown in @xcite that quotient spaces are , indeed , quotients in the category of spaces of orderings . at the same time the problem of determining whether a given quotient structure is a quotient space proves to be surprisingly challenging .",
    "the main objective of this paper is to address this question in some special cases . in what follows",
    "we shall introduce some more notation , and then proceed to explain our motivation for the current work as well as present our main results .",
    "a space of orderings @xmath3 has a natural topology introduced by the family of subbasic clopen harrison sets : @xmath29 for a given @xmath30 , which makes @xmath4 into a boolean space ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.1.5 ) ) . whenever it is clear from the context which space of orderings we consider , we shall simply write @xmath31 instead of @xmath32 .    for any multiplicative group @xmath5 of exponent 2 with distinguished element @xmath7 , we set @xmath33 and call the pair @xmath34 a fan .",
    "a fan is also a space of orderings ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 3.1.1 ) ) . we can also consider fans within a bigger space of orderings , and for this we need the notion of a subspace of a space @xmath3  a subset @xmath35 is called a subspace of @xmath3 , if @xmath36 is expressible in the form @xmath37 , for some subset @xmath38 . for any subspace @xmath36 we will denote by @xmath39 the group of all restrictions @xmath40 , @xmath30 .",
    "the pair @xmath41 is a space of orderings itself ( ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.4.3 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.2 ) ) .",
    "finally , if @xmath3 is a space of orderings , by a fan in @xmath3 we understand a subspace @xmath42 such that the space @xmath43 is a fan .",
    "one easily checks that any one- or two - element subset of a space of orderings forms a fan ",
    "thus one- or two - element fans are called trivial fans .    the stability index @xmath44 of a space of orderings @xmath3 is the maximum @xmath2 such that there exists a fan @xmath45 with @xmath46 ( or @xmath47 if there is no such @xmath2 ) . it can be shown that the stability index of a space @xmath3 is at most equal to @xmath48 if every basic set in @xmath4 can be expressed as an intersection of @xmath48 harrison sets ( ( * ? ? ?",

    "spaces of stability index 1 are also called spaces with the strong approximation property or sap spaces .",

    "@xmath80 two forms @xmath78 and @xmath81 are isometric , written @xmath82 , if they are of the same dimension and signatures for all @xmath11 .",

    "the ideal of the ring @xmath89 additively generated by the set @xmath90 is denoted by @xmath91 and called the fundamental ideal of @xmath89 .    for a formally real field @xmath48",

    "* theorem 2.1.4 ) ) .",
    "for simplicity we shall denote by the same symbol @xmath99 both an element @xmath100 , a class of sums of squares @xmath101 , and a function @xmath102 .    since the invention of abstract spaces of orderings there has been a considerable interest in the question of when such a space is realized as a space of orderings of a field .",
    "it seems likely that spaces of orderings exist that are not so realized but , so far , no such examples are known .",
    "a possible way of proving that a space of orderings is not realized in such a way is to give an example of a form @xmath103 such that    @xmath104 and @xmath105 .",
    "here @xmath89 denotes the witt ring of the space of orderings @xmath3 , and @xmath106 denotes the @xmath2-th power of its fundamental ideal .",
    "the equivalence :    @xmath104 if and only if @xmath107 .",
    "is valid for any @xmath108 , if @xmath3 is a space of orderings of a field .",
    "this was conjectured by marshall and is also known as _",
    "lam s open problem b _ @xcite .",
    "for @xmath109 the equivalence is easy to show , but for @xmath110 the proof uses a deep result from @xcite and @xcite .",
    "a short explanation of how to derive the equivalence from that result can be found in @xcite , and a longer exposition on the theme in @xcite .",
    "the problem also has an affirmative solution for all spaces of orderings of stability index no greater than 3 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 6.2 ) .",
    "it is , therefore , desirable to seek for examples of spaces of orderings of high stability indices .",
    "a possible way of finding such spaces is to investigate quotients of already known spaces : for a given space of orderings @xmath3 one can imagine some large subset of @xmath4 that is itself not a fan , but , by descending to an appropriate subgroup @xmath25 of @xmath5 , can be forced to become a fan in the quotient space @xmath111 , thus increasing the stability index .",
    "the main problem , of course , is that in doing so one obtains a myriad of quotient structures with no way of knowing if they are actually quotient spaces .",
    "we begin our discussion in section 2 with the case when @xmath25 is a subgroup of @xmath5 of index two and provide a necessary and sufficient condition for a quotient structute of an sap space @xmath34 to be a quotient space .",
    "we then refine our condition and show that this refined condition is both necessary and sufficient for spaces of stability index two that satisfy an extra technical condition .",
    "the refinement process can be continued and provides a sequence of necessary conditions  unfortunately , other than in the two aforementioned cases and the finite case , we do not know when these conditions are sufficient .",
    "in section 3 we consider the special case when the space @xmath3 is the space of orderings of the field @xmath0 .",
    "the refined condition for spaces of stability index two is here also sufficient and , moreover , is also equivalent to saying that the quotient space is profinite .",
    "this generalizes results previously obtained in @xcite .",
    "section 4 contains a handful of examples to illustrate the theory .    finally , in section 5",
    ", we generalize the necessary conditions to the case of subgroups of arbitrary ( possibly infinite ) index and discuss some of the instances when they are also sufficient .",
    "surprisingly enough , the theory simplifies significantly in the case of the space of orderings of the field @xmath0 and we show that a quotient structure of any finite index is a quotient space if and only if it is profinite .",
    "let @xmath34 be a space of orderings and @xmath28 a quotient structure of @xmath34 .",
    "we search for necessary and sufficient conditions on @xmath25 for @xmath112 to be a quotient space of @xmath34 .",

    "since @xmath25 has index @xmath120 and @xmath113 , @xmath25 is determined by a character on @xmath121 , i.e. , there exists a unique @xmath122 , @xmath123 such that @xmath124 .",
