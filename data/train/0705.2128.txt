    "it is well known that the finiteness of @xmath7 is closely related to the possibility of constructing integrals @xmath8 for some functions @xmath9 .",
    "the simplest case is when @xmath10 is finite ( @xmath2 has finite variation ) ; then a signed measure @xmath11 ( the lebesgue  stieltjes measure ) is defined from @xmath2 , and the integral is well defined for any bounded borel function @xmath9 ; if moreover  @xmath9 has left and right limits , then the integral is also a riemann ",
    "stieltjes integral ( it is the limit of riemann sums ) .",
    "if now @xmath2 has infinite variation ( @xmath12 ) but @xmath7 is finite for a larger value of @xmath1 , it was proved by young @xcite that a riemann  stieltjes integral can still be constructed as soon as @xmath13 is finite for @xmath14 such that @xmath15 ; as an application , one can consider and solve stochastic differential equations driven by a multidimensional path with finite @xmath1-variation if @xmath16 ( in particular a typical fractional brownian path with hurst parameter @xmath17 ) .",
    "if now @xmath1 is greater than 2 , lyons s theory of rough paths @xcite provides a richer framework which is still suitable to consider and solve these equations .    on the other hand",
    ", one can associate to @xmath2 a metric space @xmath18 which is a compact real tree and which can be used to describe the excursions of @xmath2 above any level ; see @xcite or chapter 3 of @xcite .",
    "the tree @xmath19 can be endowed with its length measure @xmath20 , and our aim is to relate the properties of @xmath21 to the questions of @xmath1-variation of @xmath2 and of integration with respect to @xmath2 .",
    "these questions are also considered for cdlg paths @xmath2 ( paths which are right - continuous and have left limits ) , since these paths can be considered as time - changed continuous paths . as an application , we consider the case where @xmath22 is a path of a stochastic process such as a lvy process or a fractional brownian motion ( the case of a standard brownian path has been considered in @xcite ) .    in section [ trees ]",
    ", we introduce the tree @xmath19 and study its basic properties . in particular , in the finite variation case , we work out the interpretation of its length measure @xmath20 by means of the lebesgue  stieltjes measure of @xmath2 , extending a result of @xcite ; this result is fundamental for the construction of integrals in section [ integrals ] ( see below ) .",
    "we also explain how the tree can be defined in the cdlg case .    in section [ pvariation ] , we see in theorem [ dimtree ] ( theorem [ vpomp ] for the cdlg case ) that the finiteness of @xmath7 is related to some metric properties of @xmath19 , particularly its upper box dimension @xmath23 ; more precisely , @xmath24 we give applications of these results to martingales , fractional brownian motions and lvy processes .",
    "we prove in particular that upper box and hausdorff dimensions of @xmath19 coincide for fractional brownian motions ( with hurst parameter @xmath25 ) and stable lvy processes ( with index @xmath26 ) ; we also construct an estimator of @xmath25 based on @xmath19 , which can be computed by means of a sequence of stopping times ( proposition  [ estimator ] ) .",
    "the aim of section [ integrals ] is to construct integrals with respect to @xmath2 by means of the tree .",
    "let us assume that @xmath2 is continuous and @xmath27 ( considering the general case adds some notational complication ) .",
    "the construction of the integral is based on the following remark ( propositions [ lebesgue ] and [ finitevar ] ) : when @xmath2 has finite variation , the positive and negative parts @xmath28 and @xmath29 of @xmath30 can be viewed as the images of the length measure @xmath20 by two maps @xmath31 and @xmath32 from @xmath19 to @xmath6 $ ] ; thus @xmath33 when @xmath2 has infinite variation , this procedure can still be applied to construct @xmath28 and @xmath29 ; these measures are @xmath34-finite but no more finite .",
    "however , can be viewed as a definition of @xmath35 provided the term in the right - hand side is integrable ; this means that the tree can provide a mechanism by means of which @xmath28 and @xmath29 compensate each other .",
    "for instance , if @xmath15 , @xmath36 moreover , in this case , the integral defined by coincides with the young integral ( theorems [ young ] and [ cadlag ] ) .",
    "consequently , differential equations driven by multidimensional paths with finite @xmath1-variation with @xmath16 enter our framework .",
    "actually , we may take @xmath37 for one of the components ( theorem [ edo ] ) ; this is due to the fact that the condition @xmath38 can be replaced by some weaker condition @xmath39 .",
    "we also prove that the tree approach can be used to consider multidimensional fractional brownian motions with parameter @xmath40 ( theorem [ intfbm ] ) ; in this case , the right - hand side of should be understood as a generalized integral on @xmath19 ( a limit of integrals on subtrees @xmath41 obtained by trimming @xmath19 ) , and we recover the integrals of the rough paths theory .",
    "the is devoted to two results which are needed in the article , and which may also be of independent interest . in appendix [ mixing ] , we prove that increments of fractional brownian motions are asymptotically independent from the past . in appendix",
    "[ roughpaths ] , we study the time discretization of integrals in the rough paths calculus , in a spirit similar to @xcite .    a lot of work has been devoted to the links between random trees and excursions of some stochastic processes ; these links are an extension of the classical harris correspondence between random walks and random finite trees .",
    "historically , they have first been investigated in the context of brownian excursions in @xcite ( see also the courses @xcite ) with the aim of studying branching processes . in order to consider more general branching mechanisms , lvy trees , defined by means of lvy processes",
    "@xmath42 without negative jumps , have been introduced and studied in @xcite ; they have been related to the notion of real tree in @xcite .",
    "however , we will not focus here on properties of lvy trees ; a lvy tree is indeed a tree which is associated to some continuous process related to @xmath42 ( the height process ) , whereas we will rather consider in our applications the tree which is associated directly to the lvy process @xmath42 .",
    "we work out here a nonlinear approach to integration with respect to one - dimensional paths ; consequently , the integral with respect to @xmath43 is not simply related to integrals with respect to @xmath44 and @xmath45 ; moreover , integration with respect to a multidimensional path can be worked out by summing integrals with respect to each component , but this depends on the choice of a frame .    in the proofs of this article",
    ", the letter @xmath46 will denote constant numbers which may change from line to line . for quantities depending on the path  @xmath2 of a stochastic process",
    ", we will rather use the notation @xmath47 .",
    "in this section , we first define the tree associated to a continuous path , describe its length measure , and extend these objects to cdlg paths .",

    "actually , real trees can also be characterized as connected metric spaces satisfying the so - called four - point condition , and one can use this condition to prove that @xmath19 is a real tree ; see @xcite .",

    "the continuity of @xmath57 follows from the continuity of @xmath2 ; in particular , @xmath19 is compact . in this article",

    "if there is more than one branch above @xmath67 , then @xmath67 is said to be a branching point ; this means that there is more than one excursion , and the times between these excursions are local minima of @xmath2 ( a local minimum may be a constancy interval ) . on the other hand ,",
    "if there is no branch above @xmath67 , then @xmath67 is said to be a leaf ; this means that @xmath75 $ ] , so this holds when @xmath76 or when @xmath77 $ ] is a constancy interval of @xmath2 .",

    "if @xmath19 is not finite , then it has infinitely many branching points , or it has at least a branching point with infinitely many branches above it ; in both of these cases , @xmath2 has infinitely many local minima and is therefore not piecewise monotone .",
    "conversely , if @xmath2 is not piecewise monotone , then it has infinitely many local maxima , and each of them is projected on a different leaf of @xmath19 , so @xmath80 is not finite",
    ". thus @xmath81",
    "we shall also need an operation called trimming , or leaf erasure , due to @xcite ( see also @xcite ) ; to this end , we introduce the function @xmath82 this is the height of the ( or of the highest ) branch above @xmath67 .",
    "in particular , @xmath83 if and only if @xmath67 is a leaf .",

    "]    now consider the trimmed tree @xmath89 then @xmath41 is nonempty if and only if @xmath90 , and in this case , it is a rooted subtree of @xmath19 ( it contains the root @xmath91 ) .",
