    "most active galactic nuclei ( agn ) display a `` core+jet '' structure in very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) images . in the standard interpretation , the core is taken to be the optically thick base of the jet  @xcite .",
    "due to synchrotron self - absorption , the absolute position of the observed vlbi core ( @xmath2 surface ) shifts systematically with frequency , moving increasingly outward along the vlbi jet with lower frequency  @xcite .",
    "this frequency - dependent core shift has a direct effect on astrometric measurements performed in the radio and optical . in the near future ,",
    "the gaia astrometry mission and the space interferometry mission will begin .",
    "for both missions , matching the optical astrometric catalogues to the radio catalogues  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) presents a very important problem .",
    "the core shifts can introduce offsets between the optical and radio positions of agn of up to several milliarcseconds  @xcite , which will strongly affect the accuracy of matching the radio and optical catalogues .",
    "core shifts are also needed for the correct reconstruction of vlbi spectral - index and rotation - measure maps . moreover ,",
    "knowledge of the frequency - dependent core shifts can be used to derive physical parameters of the jet , such as the core magnetic field and the distance from the vlbi core to the base of the jet  @xcite .",
    "therefore , precise measurements of the core shifts are necessary .",
    "one way to obtain core shifts is through phase - referencing vlbi observations , however this is a complex and resource - intensive technique , and phase - referencing core shifts have been determined for only a few agn , such as 1038 + 528  @xcite , 4c  39.25  @xcite , 3c  395  @xcite , 3c  390.1  @xcite , and m  81  @xcite .",
    "another indirect method to measure core shifts is to align optically thin parts of an agn jet at different frequencies  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    ". however , this method requires simultaneous multi - frequency vlbi observations , which are likewise fairly resource intensive , and does not always yield unambiguous results .",
    "the limitations of these techniques are exacerbated by the fact that the core shift may well depend on the activity state of an agn , and therefore be time dependent , whereas at present only isolated core - shift measurements for individual agn are available .",
    "in addition , the magnitude of the core shifts that can be detected is limited by the resolution of the vlbi observations used .    in this paper",
    ", we discuss the opacity in the core regions of agn and describe a new method for deriving core shifts from the frequency - dependent time lags of flares observed with single - dish observations .",
    "we use these time lags to derive physical parameters of the jets , such as the distance from the vlbi core to the base of the jet and the magnetic fields in the core region .",
    "the core is a compact feature in the vlbi map of an agn with high brightness and a relatively flat spectrum , which is usually interpreted as that part of the jet where the optical depth is @xmath3 .",
    "since the @xmath3 surface has different locations at different frequencies  @xcite , the absolute position of the core should depend on the observing frequency . according to the standard shock - in - jet model , a change of electron density and pressure at the injection point near",
    "the base of the jet will cause a shock wave to propagate along the jet .",
    "this will cause brightening of the core region , which will be seen as a flare in the total flux - density light curves , and will be followed by the appearance of a jet component ( or components ) in vlbi maps  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "consider a conical jet geometry ( see figure  [ jet ] ) observed at a viewing angle @xmath4 .",
    "a shock wave appears at the distance @xmath5 and then propagates along the jet .",
    "it will cross the @xmath3 surface for a particular frequency @xmath6 at some time @xmath7 and emerge out of the core region . since the position of the @xmath3 surface",
    "is shifted further from the jet base at lower frequencies , the times @xmath7 will be delayed at lower frequencies .",
    "figure  [ jet ] shows how the @xmath7 correspond to the maxima of the total flux - density flares obtained with single - dish observations .",
    "crossing the @xmath3 surface corresponds to a maximum of the total flux - density outburst at the corresponding frequency , and the time of the flare maximum thus also depends on the frequency ; thus , the time lags contain information about core opacity .",
    "according to the geometry of figure  [ jet ] and the principles of superluminal motion  ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , the time @xmath8 that has passed after the shock wave s appearance at the distance @xmath5 in the observer s frame is @xmath9 where @xmath10 is the distance along the jet axis in the rest frame of the quasar , @xmath11 is the apparent velocity in the plane of the sky in units of @xmath12 , @xmath4 is the viewing angle , and @xmath13 is the redshift of the source . in this equation ,",
    "we assume that the apparent speed is the actual speed of the shock . observing at multiple frequencies @xmath14 and @xmath15 , we can estimate the time lags between the maxima of the total flux - density outburst : @xmath16.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] assuming that the shock wave appears at the same distance @xmath5 at all frequencies , we obtain @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the distance between @xmath10 at the two frequencies projected onto the plane of the sky .",
    "taking expression ( 33 ) for the frequency - dependent core shift from  @xcite , we can write the dependence of the time lags on the frequency , spectral index @xmath19 , magnetic field and electron density : @xmath20 where @xmath21 @xmath22 @xmath23 is a dimensionless variable for @xmath24 and @xmath25 is a function of @xmath26 , the spectral index , and the viewing angle .        defining the core - position ( or time - lag )",

    "formula [ eq : dt ] assumes that the electron number density and magnetic field scale with distance along the jet @xmath10 as @xmath32 where @xmath26 and @xmath33 refer to the values of @xmath34 and @xmath24 at @xmath35  pc .",
    "following  @xcite and  @xcite , we can write the distance between the core and the base of the jet in terms of the frequency - dependent time lags as @xmath36 where @xmath37 is estimated using the frequency - dependent time lags . we can calculate the magnetic field at 1  pc distance for the special case when there is equipartition between the energies of the particles and magnetic field ( @xmath38 ) and the spectral index is @xmath39  @xcite : @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the doppler factor , @xmath42 the jet half - opening angle , @xmath4 the viewing angle , and @xmath33 is in gauss . the equipartition magnetic - field strength in the core can then be found from the relation @xmath43 for @xmath44 at a particular frequency @xmath45 .",
    "in order to check the proposed method for measuring the frequency - dependent core shifts from the time lags and the validity of our assumptions , we calculated time lags from the total flux - density light curves for the agn 3c  345 , whose core shift has been measured at the same frequencies used to construct the light curves .",
    "the frequency - dependent time delays were calculated by fitting gaussian functions to the total flux - density light curves from the university of michigan  @xcite and metshovi radio observatory  @xcite monitoring databases at 4.8  ghz , 8  ghz , 14.5  ghz , 22  ghz , and 37  ghz .",
    "the total flux - density light curves were decomposed into gaussian components following the procedure discussed in  @xcite and  @xcite .",
    "long - term trends in the total flux - density variations were calculated as polynomial approximations for the deepest minima in the light curves and subtracted before the fitting .",
    "the gaussian decomposition was performed such that it first removed the trend , then found the highest peak in the light curve and fitted a gaussian to the peak , based on a @xmath46 minimization .",
    "the fitted component was then removed from the light curve and the procedure was repeated until all significant peaks were fitted with gaussians . during the fitting , we applied the general criterion that the smallest number of individual flares ( gaussian components ) providing a complete description of the light curve was used .",
    "the number of fitted gaussians depended on the time interval covered by the light curve and the characteristic time scale of the source variability .",

    "<S> we discuss the opacity in the core regions of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) observed with very long baseline radio interferometry ( vlbi ) and describe a new method for deriving the frequency - dependent shifts of the vlbi core from the frequency - dependent time lags of flares observed with single - dish observations . </S>",
    "<S> application of the method to the core shifts of the quasar 3c  345 shows a very good agreement between the core shifts directly measured from vlbi observations and derived from flares in the the total flux - density using the proposed method . this provides direct evidence that the observed jet component speeds in this agn represent the actual physical speed of the feature , rather than a pattern speed . </S>",
    "<S> the frequency - dependent time lags of flares can be used to derive physical parameters of the jets , such as distance from the vlbi core to the base of the jet and the magnetic fields in the core region . </S>",
