    "an interesting topic in recent years both in the general relativity community and in the string theory community is that the bh area ( or entropy ) product formula of all horizons independent of the adm ( arnowitt - deser - misner ) mass of the background space - time @xcite .",
    "for example , the area product formula for a kerr bh @xcite depends only on the angular momentum parameter : @xmath6 where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are area of the inner and outer horizons .",
    "whenever , we have taken the perturbed space - time with a spinning bh in some non - trivial environment e.g. a bh surrounded by a ring of matter or a multiple bh space - time the same formula holds .",
    "hence , the area product formula of outer horizon or event horizon ( @xmath9 ) and inner horizon or cauchy horizons ( @xmath10 ) for kerr bh is of an _ universal _ quantity : it holds independently of the environment of the bh .",
    "on the other hand , if we incorporate the bps ( bogomolni - prasad - sommerfeld ) states , the area product formula of @xmath11 should read @xcite @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the planck length .",
    "this indicates the area product should be quantized .    alternatively , the area products independent of mass implies that there should be an important role of the cauchy horizon in the bh thermodynamics as well as in bh physics .",
    "now the relevant question is that the mass independent product formula is generic ? it has been shown explicitly by visser @xcitethat by incorporating the cosmological constant , the area product of all physical horizons is not mass independent . but typically , some complicated function of inner and outer horizon area is indeed mass independent .",
    "previous studies have not made use of the extended phase space formalism .",
    "thus in this work , we wish to examine the thermodynamic product formula in _ extended phase space_. where the adm mass of an ads bh could be treated as the enthalpy of the space - time and the cosmological constant should be treated as the thermodynamic pressure @xcite .",
    "therefore there must exists a conjugate quantity which is a thermodynamic volume associated with the bh space - time .    besides area ( or entropy ) products",
    ", it needs to be evaluated whether other thermodynamic products @xcite like bh temperature products , specific heat products , komar energy products etc .",
    "are provide any universal characterization or not , and here we first introduced the _ thermodynamic volume products _ when one must considered the extended phase space thermodynamics .",
    "does it independent of the adm mass parameter",
    "? we will investigate this issues in the present work .",
    "so , when the cosmological constant treated as a thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate variable as a thermodynamic volume what happens the _ smarr mass formula _ , _ smarr - gibbs - duhem _ relation and bh _ equations of state _ in the extended phase space . additionally , we find the mass independent volume products relation in parallel with the entropy product relations .",
    "bh thermodynamic properties have been investigated for many decades and still it is going on . in the present study ,",
    "the main motivation comes from the seminal work of hawking and page @xcite where the thermodynamic properties of bhs in schwarzschild - ads space has been explicitly studied .",
    "the author discussed the phase transition ( between small and large bhs for schwarzschild - ads bh ) which is called famous hawking - page phase transition .",
    "the special interest is due to the application of ads space - time in gauge / gravity duality via dual conformal field theory ( cft ) through ads / cft correspondence @xcite .",
    "several exotic phenomena occurs in the ads space - time .",
    "first example of course be hawking - page phase transition in schwarzschild - ads spacetime .",
    "the second one is that in charged ads spacetime , the gravitational analogue of the liquid / gas phase transition has been observed in the phase diagram which was explicitly investigated by several authors @xcite and the fact that for charged ads bh the notion of thermodynamic equilibrium is a straightforward concept .",
    "the third one is that kerr - ads spacetime admits reentrant phase transition and showing a tri - critical point in their phase diagram @xcite .",
    "the current interest is involved due to the variation of negative cosmological constant and also it is proportional to the thermodynamic pressure @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic products especially area ( or entropy ) products in charged ads bhs were calculated in @xcite but the author has not been considered there the extended phase space .",
    "here we shall compute the volume products by considering the thermodynamic pressure ( @xmath14 ) is equal to the negative cosmological constant ( @xmath15 ) divided by @xmath16 ( where @xmath17=1 ) i.e. @xmath18 and the corresponding thermodynamic volume can be defined as @xmath19 this volume for charged - ads bh should read as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the corresponding horizon radius and @xmath22 .",
    "it has been shown that the _ reverse isoperimetric inequality _ is satisfied for event horizon @xcite . here",
    "we conjecture that this inequality is valid for all the horizons i.e. @xmath23 it should be noted that a class of bhs with non - compact event horizons do not satisfy this inequality @xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is as follows . in sec.([tnt ] ) , we have described the thermodynamic properties of rn - ads bh .",
    "the sec.([quint ] ) describes the thermodynamic properties of the rn - ads bh surrounded by quintessence . in sec .",
    "( [ fr ] ) , we have given the thermodynamic properties of the @xmath0 gravity .",
    "finally , we conclude in sec.([dis ] ) . in appendix - a",
    ", we have examined the thermodynamic volume products for axisymmetric space - time and in appendix - b , we have investigated the @xmath1 criticality of inner horizon for rn - ads bh .",
    "let us begin with the charged - ads space - time metric can be written as in terms of schwarzschild like coordinates@xcite : @xmath24 where , @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the metric on the unit sphere in two dimensions .",
    "the electromagnetic potential one form for the space - time ( [ metric ] ) is @xmath27    the bh horizons determined by the condition @xmath28 i.e. @xmath29 in terms of thermodynamic pressure , this could be rewritten as @xmath30 to finding the roots we apply the vieta s rule , we get @xmath31 the entropy of the bh can be defined as @xmath32 where the area of the bh is @xmath33 and now the bh temperature reads as @xmath34 the electric potential could be defined as @xmath35    we should be noted that in the extended phase space the adm mass can be treated as the total gravitational enthalpy of the system i.e. @xmath36 . where @xmath37 is the thermal energy of the system@xcite .",
    "then the first law of bh thermodynamics in the extended phase space becomes @xmath38 and the corresponding smarr - gibbs - duhem relation becomes @xmath39 now we compute the mass(or enthalpy ) independent entropy sum and entropy product formula using eqs.([eq1],[eq2],[eq4],[eq5],[eq6 ] ) : @xmath40 in terms of two horizons , the mass - independent entropy product formula should read @xmath41 although it is a complicated function of two horizons but it is explicitly mass independent function of inner horizon and outer horizons .",
    "now we turn into another important relations that is the _ volume sum _ and _ volume product _ which are mass independent : @xmath42 again in terms of two horizons , the mass independent volume product formula should be @xmath43   & = & \\frac{3}{8\\pi p }   ~. \\label{eqq2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] these are explicitly mass - independent relations in the extended phase space .",
    "finally , the equation of state in the extended phase space should read @xmath44 where @xmath45 .",
    "now in terms of specific volume @xmath46 the above equation could be re - written as @xmath47 the critical point can be obtained from the following conditions : @xmath48 the critical values are explicitly computed in @xcite . defining further @xmath49 , @xmath50 and @xmath51 ,",
    "the law of corresponding states become @xmath52 . , @xmath53 and @xmath54 in the extended phase space the gibbs free energy could be defined as @xmath55 and the helmholtz free energy is given by @xmath56 which is very important to determine the behavior of the critical exponents . ,",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath58 and @xmath59 .",
    "the numerical values for charged - ads bh are calculated in@xcite as @xmath60 , @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 .",
    "] one may compute the entropy via the relation : @xmath64 which is exactly same as in eq .",
    "( [ eq5 ] ) .",
    "there are two types of specific heat . the specific heat at constant thermodynamic volume and the specific heat at constant pressure .",
    "they are defined as @xmath65 and @xmath66 from eq .",
    "[ eq23 ] , we can easily see that the entropy @xmath67 is independent of @xmath68 therefore we get @xmath69 and we find @xmath70 the specific heat @xmath71 diverges at @xmath72 or i.e. at @xmath73 which implies a second order phase transition occurs at that point .",
    "in this section , we will show how the quintessence dark energy matter does affect on the thermodynamic product relation in the extended phase space . the metric function of eq .",
    "( [ metric ] ) for rn - ads bh surrounded by quintessence can be written as @xcite @xmath74 where @xmath75 is the state parameter and @xmath76 is the normalization factor related to the density of quintessence .",
    "the ranges for quintessence dark energy is @xmath77 and for phantom dark energy : @xmath78 . in terms of @xmath76 ,",
    "the density of quintessence can be defined as @xmath79 in the extended phase space the function can be written as @xmath80    now the horizon eq . can be written as @xmath81 using vieta s theorem , we find @xmath82 it should be mentioned that @xmath83 is an integer quantity .",
    "the entropy @xmath67 and electric potential @xmath84 are same as in rn - ads case .",
    "now the mass of the bh could be expressed in terms of the horizon radius and dynamic pressure : @xmath85 hence the first law of thermodynamics becomes @xmath86 where @xmath87 is defined to be a physical quantity conjugate to the state parameter @xcite .",
    "the corresponding smarr relation reads @xmath88 again the mass(or enthalpy ) independent entropy sum and entropy product relations are @xmath89 similarly , the mass independent volume sum and volume product relations are @xmath90 these are explicitly mass - independent relations for rn - ads bh surrounded by quintessence .",
    "it follows from the above analysis that the entropy product and volume product relations are strictly dependent on _ quintessence dark energy matter_. it is quite interesting to mentioned that the entropy product is mass - independent but there has been effect of quintessence dark energy matter on that thermodynamic product relations .",
    "now the bh temperature for all the horizons could be defined as @xmath91 and the bh equation of state should read @xmath92 where @xmath45 . again in terms of specific volume @xmath46 the above equation should be rewritten as @xmath93 the critical values are explicitly calculated in @xcite .",
    "so we do not written here .",
    "the gibbs free energy for all the horizons could be written as @xmath94 again we compute the specific heat at constant thermodynamic pressure to study the local stability of the bh given by @xmath95 it should be noted that the specific heat diverges at @xmath96 which signals a second order phase transition .",
    "this section is dedicated to study the thermodynamic properties of a static , spherically symmetric ads bh in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "it is a kind of modified gravity and it is very useful tool for explaining the current and future state of the accelerating universe .",
    "it is also helpful for explaining the inflation and structure formation in the early universe .",
    "the metric @xcite function for this kind of gravity can be written as @xmath97 where @xmath98 .",
    "the quantities @xmath99 and @xmath100 are related to the @xmath101(adm mass ) and @xmath102(electric charge ) in this gravity becomes @xmath103 as is the thermodynamic pressure in @xmath0 gravity can be written as @xmath104 and the constant scalar curvature as @xmath105 .",
    "the corresponding thermodynamic volume can be defined as @xmath106 .",
    "therefore the horizon equation should read @xmath107 to finding the roots we again apply the vieta s rule , we have @xmath108    the entropy can be defined as @xmath109 and the bh temperature@xcite should be @xmath110 again the electric potential in @xmath0 gravity could be defined as @xmath111    now the mass(or enthalpy ) independent entropy sum and entropy product formula in @xmath0 gravity should read : @xmath112 in terms of two horizons , the mass - independent entropy product formula reads as @xmath113 again the mass independent _ volume sum _ and _ volume product _ becomes @xmath114 again in terms of two horizons , the mass independent volume product formula reads @xmath115   & = & \\frac{3}{8\\pi p } ~. \\label{eqq4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] once again these are explicitly mass - independent relation in the extended phase space in @xmath0 gravity .",
    "it should be noted that in the limit @xmath116 , one obtains the result of rn - ads bh in extended phase space . for our record",
    "we should be noted that the equation of state in @xmath0 gravity@xcite : @xmath117 in terms of specific volume @xmath46 , the above eq .",
    "could be rewritten as @xmath118 from the equation of state we can easily derived the critical constants by applying the appropriate condition .. gravity explicitly computed in @xcite are @xmath119 , @xmath120 and @xmath121    finally , the gibbs free energy @xcite should read @xmath122    in this case , the specific heat at constant pressure is found to be @xmath123 the specific heat diverges at @xmath124 or i.e. at @xmath125 again it signals a second order phase transition .",
    "the present study demonstrated that the thermodynamic properties of spherically symmetric charged - ads black hole , charged ads bh surrounded by quintessence and charged ads bh in @xmath0 gravity in the extended phase - space .",
    "the extended phase space means where the cosmological constant should be treated as thermodynamic pressure and its conjugate variable as a thermodynamic volume .",
    "we derived various thermodynamic products particularly entropy products and thernodynamic volume products .",
    "in all the three cases , it has been shown that the mass(or enthalpy ) independent properties turn out to be an universal like quantities .",
    "it should be noted that the presence of the quintessence matter does affect on the expression of entropy product and thermodynamic volume products .",
    "the first law of bh thermodynamics and smarr formula have been studied for all the horizons .",
    "the bh equation of state has been derived for all the horizons .",
    "the divergence of the specific heat indicates that the second order phase transition should occur at a certain condition . in summary , the thermodynamic relations that we derived",
    "provide some universal characterization of the bh which _ may _ provide insight into the origin of bh entropy both _ inner and outer_.    [ [ section ] ]    in the main work , we have considered the thermodynamic volume for different spherically symmetric cases where it is related to the entropy via a proportionality of the type @xmath126 and we proved that for each cases , the thermodynamic product relations are _ independent of mass _ thus the relations are _ universal _ in nature .",
    "now here we shall show what happens in case of axisymmetric cases where the thermodynamic volume is _ not _ directly proportional to the above mentioned relation ?",
    "for example , we have taken the kerr bh .",
    "the thermodynamic quantities for all the horizons @xmath127 @xcite are @xmath128 and the thermodynamic volume @xcite for @xmath9 is @xmath129 ~.\\label{ap1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we claim that the thermodynamic volume for @xmath10 is defined to be @xmath130 ~.\\label{vi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we find an interesting relation between volume products and area products for an axisymmetric spacetime having two physical horizons namely @xmath9 and @xmath10 : @xmath131 the main potential point of interest here is that the product of thermodynamic volume of @xmath127 and it is found to be for kerr bh : @xmath132 it indicates that the thermodynamic volume product does _ depend _ on the mass parameter and the universality that we have found in spherically symmetric cases breaks down for axisymmetric cases . thus the conclusion is that although the area ( or entropy product ) of @xmath127 is universal for simple kerr bh but the volume product is _ not universal_. the result should be valid for kn bh as well and the volume product is found to be @xmath133 therefore , it can be easily extend to kerr - ads bh and kn - ads bh also .",
    "[ [ section-1 ] ]    in this section , we shortly introduce @xmath1 criticality of cauchy horizon for charged ads bh .",
    "does the inner horizon obey an equation of state ?",
    "what happens to the inner horizons during phase transition has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "here we are interested to show what happens the bh equation of state in case of cauchy horizon ?",
    "what are the values of critical constant for this horizon does it same as is for event horizon .",
    "this is the main interest here .",
    "since we have taken charged ads space - time and we have assumed that the bh should have at least two physical horizons . the outer horizon @xmath134 and inner horizon @xmath135 .",
    "then we find the relevant thermodynamic quantities for @xmath9 @xcite : @xmath136 @xmath137 @xmath138 @xmath139 the critical point can be obtained at the point of inflection of @xmath9 : @xmath140 and the critical values explicitly derived in @xcite are @xmath141 now we have derived the thermodynamic quantities for @xmath10 : @xmath142 @xmath143 @xmath144 @xmath145 similarly , we can compute the critical values for @xmath10 by applying the condition at the point of inflection : @xmath146 and the critical values we find @xmath147 the only difference in critical values between two horizons is @xmath148 the critical temperature for @xmath10 is negative but other values are same .",
    "it is also true that the @xmath1 diagram is qualitatively different for @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the critical ratio for @xmath10 is calculated to be @xmath149 where as for @xmath9 , @xmath150 .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath151    finally , using the properties of symmetry in nature of @xmath152 , one obtains the following thermodynamic quantities at @xmath10 : @xmath153",
