    "in a wireless multi - hop network , nodes communicate by passing messages for one another ; permitting multi - hop communications , rather than requiring one - hop communications , can increase network capacity and allow for a more ad hoc ( and thus scalable ) system ( with little or no centralized control ) . for these reasons , and because of their potential for commercial , military , and civil applications , wireless multi - hop networks have attracted considerable attention over the past few years . in these networks ,",
    "energy efficient communication is important because the nodes are typically battery - powered and therefore energy - limited .",
    "work on energy - efficient communication in these multi - hop networks has often focused on routing protocols ; this work instead looks at power control and receiver design choices that can be implemented independently of ( and thus in conjunction with ) the routing protocol .",
    "one approach that has been very successful in researching energy efficient communications in both cellular and multi - hop networks is the game - theoretic approach described in @xcite .",
    "much of the game - theoretic research in multi - hop networks has focused on pricing schemes ( e.g. @xcite ) . in this work",
    ", we avoid the need for such a pricing scheme by using instead a nodal utility function to capture the energy costs .",
    "it further differs from previous research by considering receiver design , as @xcite does for cellular networks .",
    "this work further differs from existing research , including @xcite , through an extension of the utility function that considers the total energy costs , not just the transmit energy .",
    "we propose a distributed noncooperative game in which the nodes can choose their transmit power and linear receiver design to maximize the number of bits that they can send per unit of power . after describing the network and internodal communications in section 2 ,",
    "we describe the nash equilibrium for this game , as well as for a set of games with set receivers , in section 3 .",
    "we present numerical results and a conclusion in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "consider a wireless multi - hop network with @xmath0 nodes ( users ) and an established logical topology , where a sequence of connected link - nodes @xmath1 forms a route originating from a source @xmath2 ( with @xmath3 by definition ) .",
    "let @xmath4 be the node after node @xmath2 in the route for node @xmath2 .",
    "assume that all routes that go through a node @xmath2 continue through @xmath4 so that node @xmath2 transmits only to @xmath4 .",
    ", transmitting to multiple nodes , new `` nodes '' can be introduced , collocated with @xmath2 , each with a different destination . the modifications to the results , taking into account the channel dependence , is straightforward . ]",
    "nodes communicate with each other using ds - cdma with processing gain @xmath5 ( @xmath5 chips per bit ) .",
    "the signal received at any node @xmath6 ( after chip - matched filtering ) sampled at the chip rate over one symbol duration can be expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 are the transmit power , transmitted symbol , and ( binary ) spreading sequence for node @xmath2 ; @xmath11 is the channel gain between nodes @xmath2 and @xmath6 ; and @xmath12 is the noise vector which is assumed to be gaussian with mean @xmath13 and covariance @xmath14 .",
    "( we assume here @xmath15 . )",

    "denote the cross - correlations between spreading sequences as @xmath19 , noting that @xmath20 for all @xmath2 .",
    "let the vector @xmath21 represent the linear receiver at the @xmath6th node for the @xmath2th signature sequence .",
    "the output of this receiver can be written as @xmath22 the signal - to - interference - plus - noise ratio ( sinr ) , @xmath23 , of the @xmath2th user at the output of receiver @xmath4 is @xmath24    each user has a utility function that is the ratio of its effective throughput to its expended transmit and computation power , i.e. , @xmath25 here , the throughput , @xmath26 , is the net number of information bits sent by @xmath2 ( generated by @xmath2 or any node whose route goes through @xmath2 ) and received without error at the intended destination , @xmath4 , per unit of time and @xmath27 is the power expended by the node to implement the receiver .",
    "( we assume that all the congestion control is done in the choice of routing . )",
    "following the discussion in @xcite , we will use @xmath28 where @xmath29 and @xmath30 are the number of information bits and the total number of bits in a packet , respectively ( without loss of generality assumed here to be the same for all users ) ; @xmath31 is the transmission rate , which is the ratio of the bandwidth to the processing gain and is taken for now to be equal for all users ; and @xmath32 is an efficiency function that closely approximates the packet success rate .",
    "this efficiency function can be any increasing , continuously differentiable , sigmoidal function with @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",

    "this means that @xmath48 so @xmath23 is strictly increasing in @xmath49 .",
    "thus , for a fixed receiver type and fixed powers for the other users , there is a one - to - one relationship between the power of user @xmath2 and its sinr .",

    "each strategy in @xmath58 can be written as @xmath59 , where @xmath49 and @xmath60 are the transmit power and the receiver type , respectively , of user @xmath2 .",
    "then the resulting noncooperative game can be expressed as the maximization problem for @xmath61 : @xmath62 where @xmath23 and @xmath27 are expressed explicitly as functions of the transmit power and receiver type .",
    "for each of the receivers , @xmath63 , in @xmath57 , let @xmath64\\},\\{u_k\\}\\bigr]$ ] denote the noncooperative game that differs from @xmath65 in that users can not choose their linear receivers but are forced to use the receiver @xmath63 .",
    "the resulting noncooperative game can be expressed as the following maximization problem for @xmath61 : @xmath66    the following results are summarized without proof due to space constraints .    when given the choice between receivers , it is optimal for the users to use mmse receivers .",
    "given a certain system and fixed powers ( @xmath67 ) for all other users , there is a unique optimal power level for each user , @xmath68 , that satisfies for each @xmath2 @xmath69 and it occurs in the concave region of the efficiency function : @xmath70 .",
    "the game has at least one nash equilibrium and for any nash equilibrium , @xmath71 , it holds that @xmath72 . then , as long as @xmath73 ( that is , that a node never lowers its power when other nodes do nt lower theirs ) , the nash equilibrium is unique .",
    "furthermore , the algorithm where , for each time @xmath74 , the users use the power described by @xmath75 converges to the unique nash equilibrium for any initial choice of power vector .",
    "the solution to @xmath76 is a lower bound on the achieved sinr at the nash equilibrium ; as @xmath27 increases , so does @xmath23 .",
    "that is , as the power necessary to run increases , the nodes aim for a higher sinr : to make the transmission worthwhile , they need more throughput . because of this , for the mf and mmse receivers , the utilities of _ all _ users decreases when any user s value of @xmath27 increases ( for the de receiver , only the @xmath2th user s utility decreases ) .    for the decorrelator ,",
    "the nash equilibrium is pareto optimal . for the mmse and mf receivers",
    ", the nash equilibrium is not pareto optimal and can be improved upon if every user decreases its power by a small factor .",
    "consider a multi - hop network with @xmath0 nodes distributed randomly in a square whose area is @xmath77 square km , surrounding an access point in the center . for simplicity ,",
    "the simulations assume a routing scheme where all nodes transmit to the closest node that is closer to the access point ( or the access point of that is closest ) .",
    "the packets each contain 100 bits of data and no overhead ( @xmath78 ) ; the transmission rate is @xmath79 kb / s ; the thermal noise power is @xmath80 watts ; the channel gains are distributed with a rayleigh distribution with mean @xmath81 , where @xmath82 is the distance between the transmitter and receiver ; and the processing gain is @xmath83 .",
    "we use the same efficiency function as @xcite , namely @xmath84 , which can be shown to satisfy the conditions for the existence of a unique nash equilibrium .",
    "finally , the amount of energy that a node has to expend to run , @xmath27 , is assumed to be the same for all nodes and is allow to range from @xmath85 joules to @xmath86 joule per transmission ( equivalently , for the rate and packet size given , it ranges between @xmath87 watts and 10 watts ) .",
    "+    figure [ meanutil_beta ] shows the mean utility ( averaged over 100 realizations of the system ) for the different receivers as a function of the system load . here",
    "the load ranges from 0 to 1.5 . for loads greater than 1",
    ", the de receiver can not be used . changing the value of @xmath88 by a factor of ten for all the users",
    "changes the mean utility by roughly a factor of ten as well .",
    "the mf receiver is most affected by the increased load , with the mean utility dropping by about a factor of ten when the load increases from 10% to 50% .",
    "the performance of the de and mmse receivers are similar , although the mmse receiver outperforms the de receiver at all points , with more significant gains at high load .     and @xmath89,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ]",
    "+     and @xmath89,title=\"fig:\",width=307 ] +    as shown above , for the mmse and mf receivers , the nash equilibrium point is not pareto optimal .",
    "this is particularly obvious for the matched filter .",
    "figure [ mfutil_time ] shows how the utility for all 16 users in one scenario change with time when the simple algorithm described above is run .",
    "notice that all users have better utility before convergence .",
    "in fact , for this example , @xmath90 achieves its maximum at @xmath91 while @xmath92 achieves its maximum at @xmath93 .",
    "figure [ mfp_time ] shows the transmit power for all users in the same example ; from this it is clear that the users are transmitting at higher and higher powers to the detriment of their utilities .",
    "the mmse receiver tends to do much better ( though it would still be better for all users to use slightly less power each ) ; the mmse receiver also converges much faster .",
    "the de receiver converges in just one time step ( due to the independence of the power choices of different users ) and results in a pareto optimal solution .",
