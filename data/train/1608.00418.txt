    "in current quantum sensing experiments involving nitrogen vacancy ( nv ) centers in diamond  @xcite , dynamical decoupling ( dd ) pulse sequences such as carr - purcell - meiboom - gill ( cpmg )  @xcite , or the _ xy _ family  @xcite are used to design filter functions  @xcite only transmissive for particular frequencies by refocusing the undesired couplings . the operating principle to detect an external signal , either classical or quantum  @xcite , corresponds to having the nv center , i.e. , the quantum sensor , evolving under the action of these decoupling pulses and the signal .",
    "whenever the generated filter is permeable for a certain frequency component of the signal , the quantum sensor gathers a phase that will be subsequently measured leading to a spectrum that characterizes its environment  @xcite .",
    "a filter function is created by a sequence of microwave @xmath0-pulses applied on the nv center . for standard dd sequences such as the cpmg or the _ xy _ family",
    ", the expected resonances can only occur at the frequencies @xmath1 , where @xmath2 are odd integers and @xmath3 for a pulse interval of @xmath4  @xcite . in the same manner",
    "dd schemes employing composite pulses admit a similar description  @xcite . however it has been recently shown  @xcite that , due to the finite width of the applied pulses , the quantum sensor still accumulates a phase if @xmath5 matches the signal frequency @xmath6 or , equivalently , @xmath7 with @xmath8 . here @xmath9 with the maximum value of @xmath10 defined by the outer period of the sequence , and odd numbers of @xmath10 are excluded by symmetric sequences  @xcite .",
    "therefore the spurious responses with @xmath11 lead to spectral ambiguities and to a misinterpretation of the signals present in the environment . in particular , the @xmath12 spurious resonance of a @xmath13c spin may be falsely interpreted as the @xmath14 resonance of a hydrogen spin .    in this work",
    "we show that spurious responses in the measured spectrum can be identified and separated from the real ones by controlling the initial phase of the quantum sensor or the phase of the decoupling pulses .",
    "more specifically , we show how the intensity of the spurious peaks changes when we vary this phase while the real peaks do not change in the spectrum .",
    "furthermore we show how this method can be combined with recently proposed robust dd sequences for an accurate characterization of the spin environment .",

    "furthermore we will combine our protocol with the recently proposed adaptive xy ( axy ) dd pulse sequences for accurate spin detection  @xcite .",
    "to understand the presence and detection of spurious resonances we consider a sensor spin subjected to a static magnetic field , @xmath15 , and driven by a classical ac - field , i.e. , the external signal , applied in the same @xmath16 direction with angular frequency @xmath6 and amplitude @xmath17 . for the case of an nv based sensor , we choose the @xmath16-direction along the nv symmetry axis .",
    "in addition we consider the action of microwave @xmath0-pulses for both coherence protection of the sensor spin and detection of the ac - field .",

    "hence these resonances are independent up to the order @xmath83 , therefore the effect of @xmath30 is entirely negligible for short pulses .",

    "spurious resonances differ already at the order @xmath82 .",

    "we derived the above criterion for pulses which are only disturbed by the action of the ac - field during the pulse time .",

    "it is worth to mention that the preparation of the initial state in the @xmath26-@xmath27 plane with different initial phases @xmath122 , or different choices of the rotation axis for the decoupling pulses are interchangeable .",
    "the later can be achieved by a variation of @xmath28 in eq .  .",
    "more specifically , a preparation in @xmath123 and choosing the rotation axis @xmath124 and @xmath125 is equivalent to the situation described throughout the paper .",
    "when both phases are changed , the equations above still hold if one makes the identification @xmath126 .",
    "in a quantum setting the classical field is replaced by one or more nuclei , each of them oscillating at its own larmor frequency , and coupled differently to the sensor spin . for the sake of simplicity , we stick to a single remote spin . in that case the free evolution of the system is dictated by the hamiltonian @xmath127 where @xmath128 is the hyperfine tensor describing the interaction between the sensor and the target spin .",
    "we assumed that the energy splitting is much larger than the interaction with each remote spin , @xmath129 , therefore the central spin does not flip and we applied the secular approximation which removes the corresponding flip - flop terms . in a rotating frame of the free energy terms @xmath130 we obtain the following hamiltonian @xmath131 .",

    "thus , if we want to use our criterion for the identification of spurious resonances we have to ensure that @xmath133 which is the condition giving rise to small tilting angles .    the regime where this condition holds is easily satisfied in nv based schemes , that we will comment below , as typical couplings to remote spins are around @xmath134 ( with @xmath135 being the distance between the nv center and each nuclear spin ) , while driving frequencies can be easily selected around @xmath136 .",
    "a widely used sensor spin corresponds to an nv center in diamond which qualifies itself through through long decay and coherence times even at room temperatures  @xcite .",

    "the applied field strength of the external magnetic field reads @xmath152 . concerning the possible error sources we have taken into account that the nitrogen atom inherent to the nv center might change the energy splitting of the electronic spin due to a hyperfine interaction of up to @xmath153mhz  @xcite when the intrinsic nitrogen spin is not polarized .",
    "the detuning is stable because of the long @xmath154 time of the nitrogen spin .",

    "the axy-8 sequence shows less amplitude in the @xmath164 spurious peaks , as it reduces the effective coupling to the remote spins by @xmath165 ( a fraction of @xmath166 as the one of xy-8 ) and therefore reduces the tilting angle , in addition it employs rotations around 6 axis instead of 2 as xy-8 does and is therefore more robust against the accumulation of the fake signal .",

    "the occurrence for the @xmath167 resonance ( fig .",

    "increasing the selectivity of the axy-8 sequence by changing the sequence to @xmath179 ( @xmath191 ) and changing to @xmath192 leads to the spectrum ( b ) which clearly shows the resonance peak of the hydrogen and marks the spurious @xmath13c resonance , which can be identified undoubtedly by changing the phase as shown in fig.[carbonhydrogen ] ( c ) .",

    "the five sub - pulses are non equally spaced but the spacing is symmetric around the 3rd pulse and they obey a specific phase relation similar to the knill - sequence @xcite , making the sequence highly robust against pulse errors . in addition , the sequence allows for single spin addressing as under resonance @xmath205 with @xmath206 the larmor frequency of the target spin , it dictates an evolution with the effective hamiltonian @xmath207 where @xmath208 the spin quantum number of the nv center electron spin-1 , @xmath209 the effective coupling vector and @xmath210 the fourier coefficient of the @xmath211 term in the fourier representation of the applied filter function . by changing the interpulse spacing of the introduced composite pulses ,",
    "the first four coefficients can be controlled as @xmath212 where @xmath213 and the corresponding pulse times @xmath214 are given by @xmath215 as well as @xmath216 and @xmath217 and we defined @xmath218 and @xmath219 $ ] .",
