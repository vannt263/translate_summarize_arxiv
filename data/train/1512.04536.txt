    "recent large - scale deep photometric surveys have revealed that the distribution of stars in the galactic halo is not smooth , but that the stellar halo contains many filamentary substructures dubbed stellar streams ( see @xcite and references therein ) . since these filaments are thought to be remnants of tidally disrupted systems such as dwarf galaxies or globular clusters , these stellar streams are also called tidal streams .",
    "the discovery of stellar streams is of importance in galactic astronomy in two respects .",
    "first , their discovery is evidence that the milky way is still growing in mass by accreting smaller systems , which favours the hierarchical formation scenario of the milky way @xcite .",
    "second , since a stellar stream is shaped by the tidal forces from the milky way , kinematic information on stellar streams provides constraints on the shape of the galactic potential @xcite . since the astrometric satellite _ gaia _ @xcite will provide accurate positions and velocities of a billion stars in the milky way in the near future , studies on the dynamics of stellar streams and their use as a probe of the galactic potential are particularly timely .    to date ,",
    "most of the studies on stream dynamics have been focused on the evolution of stellar streams in static potentials ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , the existence of streams itself suggests that the milky way mass is increasing in time and hence that the galactic potential is not static .",
    "recently , @xcite studied the evolution of streams in time - dependent spherical potentials and found that the evolution of the galactic potential is imprinted on the morphology of the stellar stream .",
    "these results suggest that more general time evolution of the potential should also be important in shaping tidal streams .",
    "one obvious contribution to the time - varying potential is provided by the rotating bar towards the centre of the milky way so it is natural to ask what impact this rotating quadrupole in the potential has on stream formation .",
    "the effect of the rotating bar is expected to be particularly important for those stellar streams that pass near the bulge region .",
    "recently , @xcite discovered the ophiuchus stellar stream in pan - starrs1 data near the bulge region of the milky way .",
    "intriguingly , the ophiuchus stream is only @xmath0 long with an aspect ratio of @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "based on orbit fitting in a static axisymmetric potential , @xcite estimated that the ophiuchus stream began disrupting only @xmath2 ago , possibly triggered by a disc crossing .",
    "however , since the ages of the member stars are around @xmath3 @xcite , the progenitor system should have experienced @xmath4 disc - crossings before . thus , if we are to adopt their dynamical age , we need to explain why the progenitor was able to remain unscathed for @xmath5 .",
    "on the other hand , if the progenitor of the ophiuchus stream only entered the potential of the milky way recently , it likely entered as part of a larger system whose remnants should still be visible . in this paper",
    "we will consider an alternative explanation .",
    "we will see that a rotating barred potential can significantly slow the growth rate of a stream that is in resonance with the bar such that long - lived short streams are achievable .",
    "this is clearly an important part of the history of the ophiuchus stream .",
    "this paper is organised in the following manner . in section [ section : theory ] , we provide a qualitative explanation of how a rotating bar affects the evolution of a stream confined to the galactic plane and show how the stream length is sensitive to the bar pattern speed . in section [ section : method ] , we explain the lagrange - point stripping method we use to generate mock stellar streams . in section [ section:2d ] , we quantitatively study how streams confined to the equatorial plane grow in rotating barred potentials using lagrange - point stripping simulations .",
    "we demonstrate that stellar streams can be shorter or longer than expected if the progenitor s orbit is in resonance with the bar s rotation . in section [ section:3d ] , we analyse ophiuchus - like streams that evolve in rotating barred potentials using lagrange - point stripping simulations as well as @xmath6-body simulations .",
    "we compare our @xmath6-body models with the observed properties of the ophiuchus stream and find a good match . in section [ section : discussion ] , we discuss how this resonance compares to the well - known lindblad resonance , as well as the implications of this mechanism for finding substructures in future surveys .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ section : conclusion ] .",
    "we motivated the study of streams in rotating barred potentials by considering the case of the ophiuchus stream . before constructing models of the ophiuchus stream we present a qualitative discussion of the dynamics of streams in rotating barred potentials .",
    "we restrict ourselves to orbits which are confined to the plane in which the bar rotates to simplify the discussion .",
    "we begin by revising how streams grow in non - rotating potentials .      in order to understand how a rotating bar affects a stream ,",
    "we need to first consider how streams evolve in static potentials .",
    "this has been discussed many times previously ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "stream particles arrive at the tidal radius with a distribution of energies and angular momenta .",
    "once released from the progenitor , the effect of the progenitor s gravity is negligible and these particles conserve their energy since the potential is static and conserve the components of their angular momentum corresponding to each rotational symmetry in the potential . at leading order , the orbital frequency of these particles",
    "is governed by their energy so particles from each stripping event distribute themselves along the stream , ordered by energy .",
    "the energy of the leading tail is lower than the progenitor and the energy of the trailing tail is higher than that of the progenitor .",
    "as the stream evolves forwards in time , the distribution of energies in the stream causes it to stretch out with a larger energy spread producing a faster growth .",
    "now , let us consider a simple model of a stream produced by a progenitor on an eccentric orbit confined to the equatorial plane , @xmath7 , in an axisymmetric potential .",
    "we call this model ` model a ' . our ` stream ' consists of three particles : a progenitor particle , a leading tail particle and a trailing tail particle .",
    "the orbits of these three particles around pericentric passage are shown in the leftmost column of figure  [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ] .",
    "the top panel shows the orbit in the galactic rest frame and the second panel shows the orbit in a co - rotating frame which is identical since the potential is static .",
    "the particles follow roughly the same orbit as their respective energies are very similar .",
    "the third and fourth panels show @xmath8 and @xmath9 which are conserved as expected .",
    "the details of these orbits , the stream they are drawn from , and the potential they are evolved in are given in section [ section:2d ] .",
    "for now , these details are unimportant and figure [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ] should be thought of as a cartoon .",
    "next , we consider a potential with a non - rotating bar with its major axis aligned along the @xmath10 axis .",
    "since the bar is not axisymmetric , it generates a torque in the @xmath11 direction which changes @xmath8 . in figure",
    "[ fig : torque ] we show contours of the @xmath11 component of the torque in the disc plane for this bar .",
    "the details of the bar model which generates this torque are given in section [ section:2d ] .",
    "the exact details of this torque are unimportant for the qualitative explanation .",
    "we only rely on the sign of the torque in each quadrant , and the fact that the torque decreases as we move away from the bar .",
    "crucially , since the torque falls off with radius , the main change in angular momentum occurs when particles are near pericentre .",
    "again , we consider a simple stream model confined to the equatorial plane in this potential ( model b ) . since this potential is still static , @xmath9 is conserved .",
    "however , @xmath8 is no longer conserved since rotational symmetry is broken .",
    "we show the orbit and changes in @xmath8 and @xmath9 for this case in the second column of panels in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ] .",
    "the second panel ( co - rotating frame ) also shows the orientation of the bar and the sign of the torque as a reminder that @xmath8 is no longer conserved . as the particles approach pericentre , they receive a torque which first decreases @xmath8 and then increases it , as expected from the signs of the torque .",
    "each particle experiences an almost identical change in angular momentum since they are roughly on the same orbit .",
    "finally , @xmath9 is conserved since the potential is static .",
    "thus we see that a non - rotating bar affects each particle in the stream almost equally and will not dramatically change the stream growth rate .      much of the same intuition applies to streams evolving in the presence of rotating bars . when stream particles are far from the bar , their energy is conserved and the stream growth is governed by the distribution of energies along the stream since the potential is effectively static",
    "however , when the stream is near the bar , the potential is strongly time dependent and energy is no longer conserved .",
    "this time dependent potential can reshape the energy distribution of the stream and cause its growth rate to increase , decrease , or even become negative .",
    "we consider a simple setup with a potential made up of two parts : a static axisymmetric component and a bar rotating in the @xmath7-plane with a pattern speed of @xmath12 . in this potential ,",
    "the energy is no longer conserved since the potential is time dependent . instead",
    ", the jacobi integral , @xmath13 is conserved ( see * ? ? ?",
    "as discussed above , we are interested in how the energy of stream particles is affected by the bar .",
    "however , it is conceptually easier to understand how the angular momentum of these particles is affected using the torque .",
    "the jacobi integral allows us to translate the change in angular momentum into a change in energy , and thus into how the bar affects the stream growth rate .",
    "-component of the torque in units of @xmath14 from a @xcite bar .",
    "the solid - line and dashed - line contours show positive and negative torque , respectively .",
    "the @xmath15-frame is the co - rotating system of the bar in which the bar is aligned with the @xmath16-axis .",
    "the details of the bar are given in section [ section : potential ] . ]      in the third column of panels in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ] we consider a simple stream model confined to the @xmath7 plane in the presence of a bar rotating at @xmath17 ( model c ) .",
    "now both @xmath9 and @xmath8 are no longer conserved . in the top panel",
    "we see the orbit in the galactic rest frame looks almost identical to the previous two cases . however , the orbit in the frame co - rotating with the bar now looks dramatically different .",
    "although particles in the stream are roughly on the same orbit , particles in the leading arm arrive first and particles in the trailing arm arrive last .",
    "this time difference between particles means the bar rotates and each particle sees the bar in a different orientation .",
    "equivalently , in the co - rotating frame , the orbit of each particle is rotated by the pattern speed times this time delay .",
    "each part of the stream can now experience a different torque .",
    "in this example , the progenitor has a pericentre near the minor axis of the bar .",
    "the torque on the progenitor is nearly zero during the pericentric passage so @xmath8 is almost conserved .",
    "the particle in the leading arm , which arrived at pericentre earlier , receives a predominantly negative torque , decreasing its angular momentum .",
    "this decrease in angular momentum translates into an increase in energy via the jacobi integral .",
    "the opposite is true for the particle in the trailing arm which decreases its energy . as a result of this pattern of energy changes",
    ", we see that the energy spread between the leading and trailing arm has decreased .",
    "we can thus expect the growth rate of the stream to decrease .      in the fourth column of panels in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ]",
    "we consider another simple stream model evolved in the presence of rotating bar which is now rotating slightly faster ( @xmath18 , model d ) . from the top panel",
    "we see that the orbit in the galactic rest frame looks almost identical to the previous cases . however , the orientation of the bar near pericentre is now different .",
    "the progenitor s pericentre is near the major axis of the bar and receives almost no torque .",
    "the leading arm which arrived earlier receives a predominantly positive torque , leading to an increase in angular momentum and a decrease in energy .",
    "the trailing arm receives the opposite torque and increase its energy .",
    "this pattern of torques is opposite to that in model c. as a result , the difference in energy between the leading and trailing arm has increased and we expect the growth rate of the stream to increase .      in figure [ fig : time_length_comparison ] , we show the evolution in the stream length for the four stream models in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ] . as expected , we see that model d which has pericentres near the major axis of the bar has the longest stream while model c which has pericentres near the minor axis of the bar has the shortest stream .",
    "the static potential models ( model a and model b ) both give rise to a similar intermediate length stream since they can not reshape the energy distribution of stream particles .    .",
    "although these simulations end with the progenitor having the same location and velocity , their time - evolutions are very diverse . ]    since the location of the progenitor s pericentre controls whether the stream gets longer or shorter , there exists a resonance condition ( @xmath19 ) to ensure that the progenitor approaches the bar in the same orientation for each pericentric passage , thus magnifying the effect .",
    "it is simplest to formulate this condition in the co - rotating frame since the bar is static in this frame . for each radial period , we require that the progenitor undergoes a half - integer number of angular periods in the co - rotating frame , i.e. @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the angular frequency , @xmath22 is the radial frequency , @xmath6 is an integer , and @xmath23 is the resonant frequency .",
    "this condition ensures that the progenitor approaches the bar in the same orientation modulo a rotation by 180@xmath24 which leaves the bar s torque unchanged .",
    "of course , this condition alone is not sufficient since the phase of the bar is also essential in determining how the growth rate will change .",
    "these resonant frequencies were used to select the bar pattern speeds in the examples shown in figures [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ] and [ fig : time_length_comparison ] , resulting in extremely short and long streams .    we can now summarise the simple picture of bar shepherding which is encapsulated in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ] .",
    "put simply : particles in the stream approach the bar at different times and receive different torques and hence different changes to their energy . depending on where along the bar the progenitor has a pericentre , this mechanism can either increase or decrease the stream s growth rate .",
    "if the progenitor has a pericentre near the major axis of the bar , the stream growth rate will increase . however , if the progenitor has a pericentre near the minor axis of the bar , the stream growth rate will decrease .",
    "we emphasise that the orbits in the galactic rest frame in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ] are almost identical but the presence of a rotating bar can lead to a dramatically different energy spread and hence stream length .",
    "in this section , we will describe the details of how we generate numerical models of stellar streams using the lagrange point stripping method @xcite , as well as our potential choice and coordinate system .",
    "this method allows us to rapidly produce stellar streams and thus allows us to explore a large parameter space .      throughout this paper ,",
    "we use two types of galactocentric coordinate systems .",
    "the first one is the inertial coordinate system @xmath25 where the @xmath7-plane is the galactic plane and @xmath11-axis is directed toward the north galactic pole .",
    "the current position of the sun is assumed to be @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "the velocity of the sun is assumed to be @xmath28 @xcite , following @xcite .",
    "the second coordinate system is the bar s co - rotating frame @xmath29 in which the bar is aligned to the @xmath16-axis . for later discussion",
    ", we introduce the azimuthal angle @xmath30 in this co - rotating frame .",
    "finally , we define @xmath31 to be the cylindrical galactocentric radius which is the same in both systems .",
    "we use two milky way potential models : an axisymmetric model and a barred potential .",
    "the rotation curves of these models are shown in figure [ fig : rotation_curve ] .",
    "the axisymmetric model is the three - component mwpotential2014 model @xcite adopted in @xcite , but with the bulge component replaced by a hernquist profile @xcite with a mass of @xmath32 and a scale radius of @xmath33 .",
    "our barred potential is produced by replacing the hernquist bulge in the axisymmetric model with the prolate bar model of @xcite .",
    "the symmetry axis lies in the disc @xmath7 plane , and the semi - major and semi - minor axes for the bar are taken to be @xmath34 and @xmath35 , respectively @xcite .",
    "the pattern speed of the bar , @xmath12 , and the current bar inclination with respect to the sun - galactic centre line , @xmath36 , are free parameters .",
    "we define the sign of @xmath12 to be negative if the bar s rotation is prograde .",
    "this definition is mathematically natural in our coordinate system , since disc stars have negative values of @xmath8 . in section [ section:2d ] , we set @xmath37 for simplicity . in section [ section:3d ] ,",
    "we set @xmath38 to match observations of the bar @xcite , where the negative sign means that the positive galactic longitude @xmath39 part of the bar is closer to the sun .    figure [ fig : rotation_curve ] shows the rotation curves of our axisymmetric potential and barred potential . for the barred potential , we show the rotation curves for different values of @xmath36 .",
    "we see a slight dependence on @xmath36 of the rotation curve near @xmath40 .",
    "however , the overall shape of the four rotation curves is very similar .     represents the solar position . ]",
    "we generate mock stellar streams based on the lagrange point stripping method in the following manner :    \\(1 ) first we assume the position and velocity of the progenitor system at the current epoch @xmath41 ( ` final condition ' ) .",
    "\\(2 ) then we rewind the progenitor s orbit backward in time from @xmath41 to @xmath42 in the chosen potential .",
    "@xcite estimated the dynamical age of the ophiuchus stream to be @xmath2 by orbit fitting in an axisymmetric potential .",
    "we fix @xmath43 throughout this paper to investigate if the dynamical age of the ophiuchus stream can be significantly older than @xmath2 while keeping it as short as @xmath44 .",
    "\\(3 ) finally , we evolve the system from @xmath42 to @xmath41 and release particles from two lagrange points at a certain stripping rate . the position and velocity of the progenitor at time @xmath45 are given by @xmath46 and @xmath47 , respectively .",
    "the galactocentric distances of the lagrange points are given by @xmath48 , where @xmath49 .",
    "the tidal radius @xmath50 is defined by @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the potential of the milky way .",
    "the initial velocity of a stripped star with respect to the progenitor is randomly drawn from an isotropic gaussian distribution with zero mean relative velocity . the dispersion in each velocity component",
    "is assumed to be @xmath53 , where @xmath54 is the progenitor s mass . in this paper , we assume that @xmath55 is constant in time .",
    "we define the length of the stream as the arc length of the stream covering 80% of stream stars .",
    "we note that this length is different from the photometrically determined length that is used in @xcite . instead",
    ", our definition can be thought of as a proxy for the length .",
    "in section [ section : theory ] we gave a qualitative explanation of the effect of the bar on streams by inspecting three representative orbits . in this section",
    ", we will look at this effect quantitatively and in more detail by inspecting the evolution of the full distribution of stream particles . as in section [ section : theory ] , we will restrict the progenitor s orbit and the bar to lie in the same plane in order to give some physical insight . in section [ section:3d ] , we will consider the three dimensional problem .      here",
    "we consider a stellar stream generated from a globular cluster of mass @xmath56 that has been disrupted for @xmath57 .",
    "we run a set of lagrange - point stripping simulations in either the axisymmetric potential or the barred potential . for the barred potential ,",
    "we fix @xmath58 for simplicity and adopt a range of @xmath12 .",
    "we assume that the progenitor is currently located at @xmath59 with a prograde rotational velocity of @xmath60 and zero radial and vertical velocity . in the simulations with a barred potential , the progenitor s final location is @xmath61 , or @xmath62 away from the bar . in all the cases ,",
    "the progenitor experiences a pericentric passage at @xmath41 and moves within the disc plane .",
    "we note that the angular velocity of the progenitor near the pericentre is @xmath63 .      in order to demonstrate how a rotating bar affects the stream length , here we focus on four representative simulations , models a , b , c , and d , for which the progenitor s final azimuthal angle is @xmath64 .",
    "these are the same four models as in section [ section : theory ] .",
    "model a is run in the axisymmetric potential , and the other models are run in the barred potentials . for models b , c , and d , the pattern speeds are @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",
    "the time - evolution of the progenitor and the stellar stream for these models are shown in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases ] .",
    "these four models are identical to the four simulations shown in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ] .    in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases ]",
    "we show the orbit of the progenitor in the inertial and co - rotating frame for our four models .",
    "we also show the evolution of @xmath9 and @xmath8 for the progenitor , @xmath67 and @xmath68 for the stream , and the stream length .",
    "this figure is a counterpart to figure [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ] where we looked at the progenitor and two representative stars in the leading and trail arms . in figure",
    "[ fig:2d_special_cases ] we see that the progenitor s orbits in the inertial frame are almost identical for these models , reflecting the fact that these potentials have similar rotation curves and that the progenitors final conditions are identical .",
    "however , they look very different in the co - rotating frame .",
    "this difference causes different evolutions of the stream length as we argued in section [ section : theory ] .",
    "we will now examine how the energy and angular momentum , as well as their dispersions and the stream length , are affected by the bar .",
    "essentially , the role of the bar on the stellar stream is to change the energy and angular momentum of the progenitor and stream stars .",
    "thus , understanding the time - evolution of @xmath70 of the progenitor is an important step in our study .    in our barred potentials , the angular momentum of the progenitor , @xmath8 ,",
    "is not conserved .",
    "the change in @xmath8 is most prominent near pericentre , where the non - axisymmetry due to the bar is most important .",
    "since the potential is almost axisymmetric at large @xmath31 , @xmath8 is nearly conserved between consecutive pericentric passages .",
    "figure [ fig : torque ] shows the contour plot of the torque from the bar , which is responsible for the change in @xmath8 .",
    "we see that the torque vanishes on both the @xmath16- and @xmath71-axes .",
    "this property means that @xmath8 does not change notably when the progenitor s pericentre is located near the major axis of the bar or near the minor axis .",
    "we also see from figure [ fig : torque ] that @xmath8 increases ( positive torque ) in the first and third quadrants of the @xmath15-plane and that @xmath8 decreases ( negative torque ) in the second and fourth quadrants .",
    "this is why the progenitor s @xmath8 shows a sharp rise or drop when the pericentre location is far from both the @xmath16- and @xmath71-axes . in the rotating",
    "barred potentials , the changes in @xmath9 and @xmath8 are related since the jacobi energy is conserved [ see equation ( [ eq : jacobi ] ) ] .      since the dispersions ,",
    "@xmath67 and @xmath68 , of stream stars govern the growth rate of the stream , it is important to understand how these quantities are affected by the rotating bar .    as we can see from the fourth row of figure [ fig:2d_special_cases ] , stream stars in our four models exhibit different evolutions of the dispersions @xmath68 and @xmath67 .",
    "this difference can be understood using figure [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ] in which we presented the evolution of three representative orbits .",
    "these three representative orbits can be considered as samples from the full distributions shown in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases ] . in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ]",
    ", we showed the orbital evolutions of the progenitor system ( black solid line ) , a typical leading - tail star ( blue dotted line ) , and a typical trailing - tail star ( red dashed line ) from @xmath72 to @xmath73 .    in model a , both @xmath8 and @xmath9 are conserved , so that the differences in @xmath8 and @xmath9 between the leading and trailing stars do not change during this pericentric passage .",
    "correspondingly @xmath68 and @xmath67 in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases ] do not evolve significantly over the course of the simulation .",
    "the situation is similar in model b. in this case , the three orbits in the co - rotating frame look almost identical , so the three orbits feel the torque from the bar in a similar fashion . as a result ,",
    "the difference in @xmath8 between the leading and trailing stars is almost conserved .",
    "the difference in @xmath9 is also conserved since each orbit conserves @xmath9 . as with model a , the @xmath68 and @xmath67 of model b from figure [ fig:2d_special_cases ] do not evolve significantly over the course of the simulation .",
    "in contrast , the situation in the rotation barred potentials ( models c and d ) , is rather different . in model c ,",
    "the three orbits in the co - rotating frame look notably different from each other . before the pericentric passage , @xmath8 is larger for the leading star than for the trailing star . at the pericentre of the orbit , the leading and trailing stars receive negative and positive torques from the bar , respectively , reflecting their pericentre locations in the co - rotating frame . inspecting figure [ fig:2d_special_cases ] we note that this behaviour corresponds to a small decreases in @xmath67 , most notably around the third pericentric passage at @xmath74 . as a result , after this pericentric passage , the gap in @xmath8 between the leading and trailing stars shrinks ; and the gap in @xmath9 also shrinks . in model d , on the other hand , the gaps in @xmath8 and @xmath9 increase , since the leading and trailing stars receive positive and negative torques , respectively .",
    "figure [ fig:2d_special_cases ] shows that in this case @xmath68 and @xmath67 increase significantly over the course of the simulation .",
    "the increases in the dispersions occur around pericentric passage and , as the simulation assumes a constant stripping rate , between pericentric passage the dispersions decay due to new material entering the stream .      here",
    "we investigate how the changes in @xmath68 of stream stars are translated into the time - evolution of the stream length .",
    "on the bottom row in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases ] , we show the time - evolution of the stream length .",
    "these lengths are identical in figure [ fig : time_length_comparison ] . in all of these cases",
    ", the stream length shows an oscillatory behaviour as it stretches and compresses near pericentres and apocentres respectively . in models",
    "a and b , @xmath68 is nearly constant in time , so that the stream gradually grows . in model c",
    ", we see a notable decrease in @xmath68 ( especially near the third pericentric passage ) , which suppresses the growth rate of the stream and results in a short stream . in model d ,",
    "on the other hand , we see a notable increase in @xmath68 , which enhances the growth rate and results in a long stream . from these representative models",

    "in addition to the resonant frequency given by equation ( [ eq : resonant_condition ] ) , the stream length in figure [ fig:2d_l_vs_omega ] has features which look like higher order resonances .",

    "the generalised resonance frequency reproduces our resonant frequency in equation ( [ eq : resonant_condition ] ) . for @xmath95",
    ", we would expect features with half of the frequency spacing of the main resonance .",
    "the effect on the stream length at these frequencies should not be as strong as the main resonance since the bar is only approached in the same orientation every @xmath91 radial oscillations . as a result , the bar s effect will not be as coherent .",
    "this naturally explains the small peaks between large peaks in the top two panels of figure [ fig:2d_l_vs_omega ] .",

    "in reality , the stripping of stars from the progenitor is most prominent near the pericentre ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in order to model the stripping realistically",
    ", we assume the stripping rate to be a sum of gaussians peaked at the time of pericentric passages with a dispersion of @xmath112 .",
    "the observationally determined values of @xmath12 of the galactic bar are distributed around @xmath113 @xcite .",
    "here we adopt a rather wide range of @xmath12 of the bar of @xmath114 .",
    "to validate our lagrange - point stripping simulations , we have run several @xmath6-body simulations of a king profile cluster disrupting in potentials with various pattern speeds , @xmath12 .",
    "these simulations are run with the @xmath6-body part of gadget-3 , which is similar to gadget-2 @xcite .",

    "each cluster is represented by @xmath118 particles and a softening of @xmath119 was used .",
    "we compare our @xmath6-body simulations against the lagrange - point stripping method in section [ section : final_length ] and against observations of the ophiuchus stream in section [ section : observations ] .",
    "next , we investigate how ophiuchus - like streams evolve . in figure",
    "[ fig:3d_special_cases ] we show the time evolution of the progenitor and the stream stars for two representative runs of the lagrange - point stripping simulations with @xmath120 and @xmath121 , which result in a long and a short stream , respectively .",
    "we see that the changes in @xmath70 are prominent only when the progenitor experiences its pericentric passages .",
    "this property is reminiscent of our 2d simulations ( figure [ fig:2d_special_cases ] ) , where these changes are notable only at the pericentres of the progenitor .",
    "figure [ fig:3d_special_cases ] also shows that @xmath67 and @xmath68 have a notable rise or drop only at the pericentric passages , just as in our 2d simulations .",
    "however , unlike the 2d simulations that used a constant stripping rate , the bursty stripping at pericentric passage leads to no decay in the dispersions between pericentres .",
    "in addition , we see that the decrease in @xmath68 causes a suppressed growth of the length for @xmath122 simulation and the increase in @xmath68 causes a rapid growth of the length for @xmath123 simulation .      here",
    "we have a closer look at the second pericentric passage in the @xmath122 simulation to demonstrate the shepherding mechanism of the bar .",
    "we choose this pericentric passage because @xmath68 decreases most prominently in figure [ fig:3d_special_cases ] ; and because we see a counter - intuitive behaviour that @xmath68 decreases while increasing @xmath67 .         in figure [ fig:3d_special_cases_track ]",
    "we show the orbit of the progenitor , a leading - tail star , and a trailing - tail star as they cross the disc plane and then ( only @xmath124 later ) experience a pericentric passage .",
    "these orbits cross the disc plane at a similar position in the @xmath7-plane , but at different positions in the @xmath15-plane , due to the different disc - crossing times . as a result , these orbits receive different torques from the bar .",
    "before the disc crossing ( or the pericentric passage ) , the leading star has the largest value of @xmath8 .",
    "however , since the leading star has the greatest loss in @xmath8 , @xmath125 becomes negative and @xmath126 increases .",
    "this is why @xmath67 increases . on the other hand , the gap in @xmath9 between the leading and trailing stars shrinks , in a similar fashion as in model c in figure [ fig:2d_special_cases_lz ] .",
    "the full explanation is due to the underlying distribution in @xmath9 and @xmath8 of the debris and is given in the appendix .",
    "figure [ fig:3d_length_omega ] shows the relationship between the final stream length and @xmath12 for our simulations .",
    "we see that the final stream length of the lagrange - point stripping simulations shows a periodic pattern as a function of @xmath12 , very similar to the 2d case in figure [ fig:2d_l_vs_omega ] . at @xmath127 and @xmath128 , we see troughs in the final length .",
    "these troughs suggest that the ophiuchus stream can be as short as @xmath44 even if its dynamical age is @xmath129 .",
    "also , we note that the final length changes by a factor of 5 or more for a modest change in @xmath12 .     for our ophiuchus - like stream simulations in barred potentials .",

    "the vertical band shows the recent constraint on the galactic bar s pattern speed of @xmath130 @xcite .",
    "note that negative values of @xmath12 correspond to bars with prograde rotation . ]",
    "the results from the lagrange - point stripping simulations are justified by the more realistic @xmath6-body results , since they are broadly consistent .",
    "for example , in both types of simulations , models with @xmath131 and @xmath132 result in long streams , and models with @xmath133 and @xmath121 result in short streams . also , the length of the stream is sensitive to @xmath12 at @xmath134 in both cases .",
    "we note that the @xmath6-body simulations tend to result in streams with more extreme lengths .",
    "for example , the final lengths of the simulations with @xmath135 and @xmath136 are @xmath137 and @xmath138 for the lagrange - point stripping models ; but are @xmath139 and @xmath140 for the @xmath6-body models . however , our lagrange - point stripping method is useful to search for conditions for short streams since it can generate a model in @xmath141 seconds .      in figure",
    "[ fig:3d_length_omega ] , the intervals between the peaks and between the troughs in the final stream length are around @xmath142 , which is reminiscent of equation ( [ eq : resonant_condition ] ) .",
    "the similarity between the 2d simulations and our ophiuchus - like stream simulations in terms of @xmath143 arises from the fact that the pericentre locations with respect to the bar @xmath89 are important in shepherding the stream stars for both cases .",
    "however , if we consider different 3d orbits , different resonance conditions may be important .",
    "now that have created old streams which are short , we can compare them against observations of the ophiuchus stream .",
    "our @xmath6-body simulations with @xmath144 and @xmath145 attain the final length of @xmath137 and @xmath139 , respectively .",
    "these lengths are comparable to the observed length of the ophiuchus stream ( @xmath0 ; @xcite ) .",
    "the case with @xmath122 is especially interesting , since this value of @xmath12 is consistent with a recent determination of @xmath12 @xcite .    according to @xcite ,",

    "at first sight , the mechanism described in this work seems similar to lindblad resonance @xcite .",
    "the lindblad resonance occurs at orbital frequencies of @xmath176 where @xmath177 is an integer .",
    "this should be contrasted with the resonant condition in this work from equation ( [ eq : resonant_condition ] ) which we repeat here for clarity : @xmath178 the lindblad resonance requires that resonant orbits are closed after one angular period in the co - rotating frame .",
    "particles on nearby orbits are drawn to the resonant orbit and the density along the orbit is nearly uniform . since stars are selected based on being near the resonant orbit , there can be a large scatter in age and metallicity of stars in the resonance .",
    "finally , the higher order resonances ( large @xmath177 ) are nearly circular .    in contrast",

    "these orbits can be much more eccentric than the orbits satisfying the lindblad resonance , especially at large @xmath6 .",
    "in addition , the density can vary significantly along the orbit since sections of the orbit which have pericentres near the centre of the bar will receive density enhancements , while those with pericentres near the major axis of the bar will have a depleted density .",
    "we note that both the lindblad resonance and our resonance condition are specific cases of the generalised condition in equation ( [ eq : generalized_resonance ] ) .",
    "the lindblad resonance corresponds to @xmath179 with arbitrary @xmath91 and our resonance condition corresponds to @xmath94 with arbitrary @xmath6 .      in recent work , @xcite explored the effect of chaos on streams .",

    "this fanning causes the stream density to drop off dramatically .",
    "@xcite proposed that if the ophiuchus stream stars were on chaotic orbits , this mechanism could explain the relative shortness of the ophiuchus stream . in order to distinguish whether chaotic fanning or the bar shepherding proposed in this work have contributed to the shortness of the ophiuchus stream , we can compare their observational signatures .",
    "if the stream density has decreased due to fanning , we should expect to see an increase in the width of the stream towards the end of the ophiuchus stream .",
    "we should also expect an increase in the velocity dispersion in the direction perpendicular to the stream plane .",
    "we note that this increase in dispersion may not necessarily be along the line of sight and may only be visible in the proper motion dispersion .",
    "in contrast to this , the bar shepherding mechanism does not appear to increase the dispersion or width near the end of the stream .",
    "in addition , better measurements of the bar s pattern speed and the ophiuchus stream orbit will give a better constraint on exactly how close to resonance the stream is .",
    "thus , we expect it should be possible to distinguish these mechanisms observationally .",
    "the arrival of the sdss data produced a number of discoveries of substructure in the halo of the milky way ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and it is hoped that the next generation of surveys will produce many more such discoveries . based on the sdss discoveries it seems the most promising place to look for substructure is in the outer halo and it is traditionally held that the inner halo is composed of material that is already well phase - mixed @xcite . however , the mechanism described in this work can either increase or decrease the phase - space density of tidal debris which comes near the bar . as a result , tidal debris which would otherwise have phase - mixed in the milky way potential can remain visible for long periods of time . since the effect depends sensitively on the phase at which the debris approaches the bar , we expect enhanced debris will belong to a single progenitor as opposed to the variety of stars seen in lindblad resonances .",
    "therefore , although stream - hunting in the outer halo is expected to be more profitable , stream - hunting within the central regions of the galaxy is also anticipated to bear fruit . with this regard ,",
    "it is worthwhile pointing out that an infrared satellite _ jasmine _ ( japan astrometry satellite mission for infrared exploration ; @xcite ) plans to perform an astrometric survey of the bulge in 2020s .",
    "our simulations have focussed on potentials with bars that rotate with a constant pattern speed .",
    "@xmath6-body simulations of discs embedded in halos have demonstrated that the bar can be torqued by the halo such that it gradually slows over time @xcite . for our model of the ophiuchus stream to be valid",
    "we require the pattern speed of the bar to change by only a few @xmath180 over a @xmath181 . this required rate of change in @xmath171 is comparable to the rate seen in numerical simulations ( see figure 2 of @xcite ) .",
    "significant evolution of the pattern speed would cause the progenitor orbit to shift from near a shortening resonance to near a lengthening resonance and would begin to wash out the signal we have observed .",
    "however , this situation also gives us hope that segments of longer streams may become resonantly trapped and be observed as overdensities in much longer less dense streams .",
    "optimistically , we might hope that observations of many short streams near the centre of the galaxy may provide constraints on the time evolution of the galactic bar .",
    "we have identified a novel mechanism which can modify the growth rate of streams which pass near the bar . since different parts of a stream arrive at pericentre at different times , they receive different torques and hence different changes in energy .",
    "this in turn modifies the orbital frequencies of each particle , which changes the growth rate of the stream .",
    "we have demonstrated that for streams confined to the equatorial plane of an axisymmetric potential plus a rotating bar , the length of the stream is a strong function of the bar pattern speed . when the pattern speed is such that the progenitor approaches the minor axis of the bar at each pericentric passage ,",
    "the resulting stream is much longer than if the stream were evolved in a completely axisymmetric potential .",
    "however , when the pericentric passages of the progenitor are along a line perpendicular to the bar s major axis the opposite effect is seen and the resulting stream is significantly shorter .",
    "this mechanism allows the existence of short and old stellar streams .",
    "we have run a series of lagrange - point stripping method simulations as well as @xmath6-body simulations and investigated how a rotating bar affects the length of the ophiuchus stream .",
    "we find that some of our ophiuchus - like @xmath6-body streams evolved in a barred potential for @xmath174 can be as short as 1 - 2 @xmath182 and can explain the observed properties , if the pattern speed of the bar is properly chosen .",
    "this finding suggests that the dynamical age of the ophiuchus stream can be at least as long as @xmath161 .",
    "this age is in contrast to the dynamical age of @xmath2 claimed by @xcite , who assumed an axisymmetric potential .",
    "we note that it might be possible to generate ophiuchus - like stream models with dynamical ages much older than @xmath174 by tuning the potential model .",
    "our mechanism opens a new possibility of unveiling the formation history of the inner halo .",
    "previously , it has been thought that the inner halo of the milky way is highly phase - mixed due to the short dynamical time @xcite .",
    "this conventional view suggests that the spatial and velocity distribution of inner halo stars are already smoothed out and have lost coherent structures that retain the initial conditions of the accreted stellar systems .",
    "however , our mechanism can enhance the density of some stellar streams in the inner halo . with future astrometric surveys near the bulge region ( _ gaia _ ) or within the bulge ( _ jasmine _ )",
    ", we might be able to detect more substructures similar to the ophiuchus stream in the inner halo .",

    "+   +   +   +     in this appendix we investigate how the distribution of @xmath70 of stream stars changes as the stream crosses the disc plane . in figure [ fig:3d_special_cases_distribution ]",
    "we show the distribution of stream stars in the @xmath149 simulation during the same disc - crossing as in figure [ fig:3d_special_cases ] .",
    "the left , middle and right columns show respectively the snapshot in the inertial @xmath183-plane , in the @xmath184-plane , and in the @xmath69-plane .",
    "the time evolves from the top row to the bottom , and the stream is moving towards @xmath185-direction .",
    "the leading star and the trailing star that we have probed in figure [ fig:3d_special_cases ] are marked by the open triangle and square , respectively ; while the progenitor is marked by the open circle .",
    "those stars in the leading and trailing tails are shown by blue @xmath186 and red @xmath187 , respectively .",
    "we note that the each star conserves @xmath188 , so that each star moves only vertically on the middle panels and in parallel to the inclined line on the right panels . finally , in each row we give the time relative to the disc crossing time , @xmath189 .      at @xmath191 ,",
    "the leading tail reaches the disc plane . here",
    ", the leading - tail stars decrease @xmath8 by a large amount .",
    "in contrast , the distribution of @xmath8 does not change a lot in the trailing tail since the trailing tail is yet too far from the disc plane . as a result ,",
    "the distributions in the @xmath184- and @xmath69-plane become notably asymmetric .",
    "this asymmetry can be well traced by looking at the relative position of the triangle and the square .    at @xmath192 ,",
    "the progenitor reaches the disc plane , and subsequently the trailing tail crosses the disc plane at @xmath193 . by the time the trailing tail experiences the disc crossing , the bar s influence on the stream is no longer strong , so that the change in @xmath8 is mild for the trailing - tail stars .",
    "thus , the distribution of the trailing - tail stars in the @xmath184- and @xmath69-plane is nearly frozen at @xmath194 .    as a result ,",
    "the correlation between @xmath9 and @xmath8 of the stream stars is changed during this disc crossing .",
    "this is the fundamental reason why we see a sharp increase in @xmath67 and sharp decrease in @xmath68 at the second disc crossing of the @xmath149 simulation ."

    "<S> the dynamics of stellar streams in rotating barred potentials is explained for the first time . </S>",
    "<S> naturally , neighbouring stream stars reach pericentre at slightly different times . in the presence of a rotating bar , </S>",
    "<S> these neighbouring stream stars experience different bar orientations during pericentric passage and hence each star receives a different torque from the bar . these differing torques reshape the angular momentum and energy distribution of stars in the stream , which in turn changes the growth rate of the stream . for a progenitor orbiting in the same sense as the bar s rotation and satisfying a resonance condition , the resultant stream can be substantially shorter or longer than expected , depending on whether the pericentric passages of the progenitor occur along the bar s minor or major axis respectively . </S>",
    "<S> we present a full discussion of this phenomenon focusing mainly on streams confined to the galactic plane . in stark contrast with the evolution in static potentials , which give rise to streams that grow steadily in time , </S>",
    "<S> rotating barred potentials can produce dynamically old , short streams . </S>",
    "<S> this challenges the traditional viewpoint that the inner halo consists of well phase - mixed material whilst the tidally - disrupted structures in the outer halo are more spatially coherent . </S>",
