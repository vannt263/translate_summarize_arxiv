    "it is generally accepted that pulsars are produced from massive progenitor stars with a masses of @xmath2 and typical radii @xmath3 , collapsing at the end of their evolution to neutron stars in an explosion , which ejects the outer envelope forming a supernova remnant .",
    "a pulsar is a rotating neutron star ( baade & zwicky 1934 ) with a mass of @xmath4 , a radius of @xmath5  km , and a rotational period typically of order @xmath6  s. pulsars are slowing down and loosing their rotational energy with the rate @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the measured rate of a pulsar slow - down , and @xmath9 is a generic moment of inertia of a pulsar . assuming that the pulsar releases its mechanical energy in form of magnetic dipole radiation ( ostriker & gunn 1969 ) one can estimate the pulsar surface magnetic field",
    "@xmath10 which appears to be very strong and for a typical pulsar is of the order of @xmath11 . assuming a constant magnetic field throughout the pulsar lifetime , the characteristic age of a pulsar can be determined from its rotational period and slow - down rate @xmath12 the @xmath0-ray luminosity of a pulsar , @xmath13 , can be roughly estimated using the measured flux of high - energy @xmath0-rays , @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the solid angle into which the pulsar beams and @xmath17 is the distance to the pulsar .",
    "the @xmath0-ray luminosity is widely supposed to be proportional to the total loss of pulsar rotational energy @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the efficiency of converting the rotational energy of neutron star into @xmath0-rays . on the other side",
    "the @xmath0-ray flux of a particular pulsar can be estimated as @xmath20 the conversion efficiency , @xmath19 , could be , in zero approximation , assumed as a phenomenological function of pulsar age , even though this function is not unique and not universal .",
    "the observed @xmath0-ray flux depends at first on the size of the pulsar beam .",
    "finally the spin - down powered pulsars can be characterized by a set of five parameters @xmath21 , which allow to predict approximate @xmath0-ray luminosity of a particular pulsar for a given @xmath22 and @xmath19 .",
    "more accurate calculations of @xmath0-ray fluxes , light - curves and energy spectra can be performed using elaborated models of spinning down pulsars .",
    "there are two major classes of models dealing with high - energy @xmath0-ray emission from the pulsars .",
    "they differ primarily by the initial assumptions on where the particle acceleration and radiation take place , either near the surface of neutron star at its _ polar caps _ or in the _ outer gaps _ , which may occur in the outer magnetosphere of a pulsar at relatively large distance from the surface of the neutron star ( see figure  1 ) .",
    "_ polar cap model_. a fast spinning , magnetized neutron star can generate a huge electric field , which induces an electrostatic potential @xmath23 right above the polar caps of a pulsar .",
    "as suggested by goldreich & julian ( 1969 ) the corresponding electrostatic force may overcome gravity and pull out the charged particles from the surface of the neutron star , forming the current given by @xmath24 .",
    "in addition charged particles may escape from the surface of the neutron star because its surface temperature @xmath25 ( becker & trmper 1997 ) may exceed the electron thermal emission temperature .",
    "the electrons can be accelerated in the regions above the poles where the open magnetic field lines , where @xmath26 is an angular velocity of a pulsar . ]",
    "originate ( sturrock 1971 ; ruderman & sutherland 1975 ) . those electrons may emit high - energy @xmath0-rays in three major processes : _",
    "( i ) _ synchrotron emission induced by electrons spinning around the magnetic field lines ; _",
    "( ii ) _ curvature radiation generated by the electrons moving along magnetic field lines ; _ ( iii ) _ inverse compton emission produced by high - energy electrons , which up - scatter low energy photons to @xmath0-ray energies . the @xmath0-rays interact with the pulsar magnetic field ( @xmath27 ) initiating the pair cascade ( harding 1981 ; daugherty & harding 1982 ) .",
    "the pair formation fronts occur at 0.5 - 1 stellar radii above the surface of the neutron star where the magnetic field is rather strong ( for a typical pulsar @xmath28 ) . for such magnetic fields only the @xmath0-rays below a certain energy ( a few gev for typical pulsars ) may freely escape from the pair production region .",
    "the super - exponential cut - off in the high - energy @xmath0-ray spectrum is an intrinsic feature the of polar cap model .    _",
    "outer gap model_. a vacuum gap may occur in the outer magnetosphere of a pulsar ( cheng , ho & ruderman 1986 ; romani 1996 ) , which is limited by the null charge surface @xmath29 and the light cylinder .",
    "charged particles can flow out through the light cylinder , whereas they could not run through the null charge surface .",
    "the @xmath0-rays ( curvature or inverse compton photons ) penetrating into the vacuum gap can produce a pair ( @xmath30 ) by interacting with non - thermal x - rays or infrared photons , which fill the gap .",
    "the secondary electrons can be accelerated in the vacuum gap electric field and emit synchrotron and curvature @xmath0-ray photons .",
    "the @xmath0-rays of energy at least up to 10  gev may escape from the vacuum gap .",
    "this model is suggestive of pulsed tev @xmath0-ray emission induced by the inverse compton up - scattering of infrared photons by high - energy electrons ( romani 1996 ) .",
    "@xmath31    r is a rank given according to the derived value of @xmath22 .",
    "@xmath32 was seen only with comptel ( kuiper et al . 1999 ) up to an energy of about 30  mev , and not with egret .",
    "even though both of the models can fit the variety of light - curves of radio pulsars as well as the photon spectra over the optical , radio , x - ray , and high - energy wavelengths , they inevitably predict very different spectra at energies above 10  gev .",
    "the harder spectra of high - energy @xmath0-rays are more plausible for outer gap model , whereas such spectra are almost excluded in the polar cap model ( see harding 2000 ) except for millisecond pulsars .",
    "future pulsar observations from the ground with erenkov telescopes will allow to measure the spectral shape of a pulsed emission in the relevant energy range ( above 10  gev ) , which will be tightly constraining the choice of an appropriate model of high - energy @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "there are a few other models , which do not fit into the two classes mentioned above , for instance a _ neutron star wind model _ suggested recently by kirk , skjaeraasen , gallant ( 2002 ) .",
    "the energy of the pulsar magnetic field may be converted into energy of accelerated particles within the magnetic field reconnections , which do occur at the null current sheet extending rather far from the surface of the neutron star beyond the light cylinder .",
    "spectra of @xmath0-ray emission computed using such a model might be challenging future observations at high - energies from the ground .",

    "the discovery of the first radio pulsar @xmath34 ( hewish et al .",
    "1968 ) has triggered further large - scale search for radio pulsars , which brought us a lot more detections .",
    "these days the catalogs of radio pulsars account for more than 1400 objects .",
    "about 50 of those have been seen in x - rays , but only 7 at high energies ( @xmath35  mev ) ( kanbach 2002 ) , recently observed with egret - ray telescope on board _ compton gamma ray observatory ( cgro ) _ ] .",
    "it is remarkable that most of the egret pulsars have got a top rank when they are listed according to the value of @xmath22 ( see table  1 ) .",
    "most of the high - energy @xmath0-ray pulsars have been seen at radio wavelengths , except geminga ( @xmath36 ) , which appears to be radio - quiet .",
    "the light - curves of pulsed high - energy @xmath0-ray emission generally do not resemble the light - curves of radio emission , even though they can be rather similar , e.g. for the crab pulsar ( @xmath37 ) .",
    "three pulsars , crab , vela ( @xmath38 ) , and geminga , have a double - peaked light - curve with a substantial contribution of a bridge ( inter - peak ) emission",
    ". the peculiar behavior of the light - curves reveals a complicated geometry of the pulsed emission , which is evidently not always similar to the light - curves at other wavelengths ( for detailed discussion see thompson 2000 ) .",
    "six @xmath0-ray pulsars show a clear evidence of the pulsed emission above 5  gev .",
    "spectral energy distributions ( sed ) of @xmath0-ray emission from the high - energy pulsars ( @xmath39 ) peak in the hard x - ray or @xmath0-ray range . the sed breaks at gev energies , which is an established distinctive feature of @xmath0-ray emission from the pulsars , which was predicted by the polar cap model .",
    "the energy spectra of egret pulsars can be well fitted by power laws with spectral indices within the range @xmath40=1.42.1 plus a super - exponential cut - off at the energy about @xmath41 ( de  jager et al .",
    "2001 ) @xmath42 where @xmath43 is in units of gev .",
    "parameters of the fit for six egret pulsars are summarized in table  2 .",
    "the normalization constant @xmath44 in eqn.([fit ] ) corresponds to the photon flux at energy of 1  gev , and is an approximate measure of the pulsar luminosity in high - energy @xmath0-rays , @xmath45 .",
    "one can expect that @xmath45 correlates with the total loss of the rotational energy of a pulsar ( @xmath22 ) . in figure  2 the scatter plot of @xmath44 over @xmath22 for six gev egret high - energy @xmath0-ray pulsars is shown .",
    "even though the current sample of high - energy @xmath0-ray is very poor one can see an evident trend , which can be fitted as @xmath46 .",
    "pulsar luminosity in high - energy @xmath0-rays is determined not only by the total loss of its rotational power but in addition by the efficiency of energy conversion from slow - down into high - energy @xmath0-rays ( see eqn.([epsi ] ) ) .",
    "in fact , even a pulsar with a rather low value of @xmath22 and low rank ( see table  1 ) could appear to be a powerful @xmath0-ray emitter .",
    "for instance @xmath0-ray pulsar @xmath47 has rather low rank  29 .",
    "naturally the efficiency @xmath48 could be a function of pulsar age .    the efficiency of energy conversion from rotational slow - down into high - energy @xmath0-rays can be determined at most by the increase of current flow out of the neutron star for elder pulsars ( harding 1981 ) , or by the corresponding increase in size of a particle acceleration region in the magnetosphere around the star ( ruderman , cheng 1988 ) .",
    "the measure of conversion efficiency as a function of pulsar apparent age is shown in figure  3 .",
    "the general tendency can be approximated by @xmath49 .    for a better understanding of pulsar workings a substantially more representative sample of @xmath0-ray pulsars",
    "is needed .",
    "future observations from space with glast and from the ground with future erenkov instruments may significantly increase the sample of @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "de  jager et al ( 2001 ) have estimated the minimal exposure for a 5@xmath50 detection of egret high - energy @xmath0-ray pulsars .",
    "pulsar @xmath51 appeared to be the best candidate for the future observations with h.e.s.s .",
    "( for a description of the experiment , see hofmann 2001 ) .",
    "a 10  hours exposure with h.e.s.s . will enable to resolve a pulsed high - energy @xmath0-ray emission above 30  gev from @xmath51 .",
    "based on the outer gap model of @xmath0-ray emission ( see discussion above ) romani ( 1996 ) predicted a pulsed very high energy ( vhe ) tev emission through the inverse compton ( ic ) up - scattering of synchrotron photons on the primary electrons accelerated in the strong electric field of a pulsar .",
    "it motivated numerous observations of pulsars with ground - based imaging and non - imaging atmospheric erenkov telescopes ( ong 1998 ; catanese & weekes 1999 ) . note that the ground - based instruments are approaching the energy range covered by satellite detectors and",
    "already nowadays achieve an energy threshold as low as 60  gev .",
    "basic results of these observations are summarized in table  2 . except for recent evidence for a detection of geminga with still low level of confidence",
    "( neshpor & stepanian 2001 ) none of the observations have resolved a pulsed vhe @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "the outer gap model could easily accommodate the non - detection of pulsed vhe @xmath0-ray emission by assuming higher fluxes of the microwave seed photons which cause the pair production of tev @xmath0-rays within the vacuum gap ( hirotani & shibata 2001 ) . predicted fluxes of pulsed ic tev @xmath0-rays rely heavily on the spectral energy distribution of the microwave seed photons , which is currently purely known .",
    "@xmath52    u.l .",
    "is an upper limit measured in @xmath53 .",
    "neshpor & stepanian ( 2001 ) claim the detection of geminga pulsar at 4.4@xmath50 confidence level .",
    "a detailed search for the ic component of vhe @xmath0-ray emission from pulsars will be performed with the ground - based imaging erenkov telescopes of the next generation with drastically improved flux sensitivity .",
    "what sets the puzzle is that the crab nebula ( hillas et al .",
    "1998 ; aharonian et al . 2000 ) , vela ( yoshikoshi et al . 1997 ; chadwick et al . 2000 ) , and @xmath51 ( kifune et al . 1995 ; chadwick et al . 1998 ) , are well established sources of dc gev - tev @xmath0-ray emission in the 60  gev - 50  tev energy range .",
    "this steady flux emission might be associated possibly with the x - ray synchrotron nebula around the pulsar ( de  jager & harding .",
    "1992 ; de  jager  et  al . 1996",
    "; aharonian , atoyan , kifune 1997 ) .",
    "however the spectral behavior of both , pulsed and unpulsed , components of high - energy @xmath0-rays within the energy range from 10  gev up to 100  gev remains unknown .",
    "this energy range can be effectively studied from the ground with the forthcoming imaging atmospheric erenkov light telescopes ( see for a review catanese , weekes 1999 ) .",
    "spectral measurements over this energy range will severely constrain the physics of particle injection and acceleration in a pulsar and within the surrounding pulsar nebula .",
    "note that h.e.s.s . could detect a crab like source of dc vhe @xmath0-rays after a few minutes of observation ( konopelko 2000 ) .",
    "most of the radio pulsars detected so far have their rotational periods within the range from 10  ms to 10  s , whereas a few of them form a separate sample of millisecond pulsars with rotational periods in the range from 1  ms to 10  ms .",
    "@xmath54 is the first detected millisecond pulsar , and has a rotational period of 1.5  ms ( backer et al .",
    "for such a short period it has a surprisingly small value of @xmath55 . using the relation given by eqn.([tau ] )",
    ", one can estimate the pulsar age as @xmath56  years .",
    "being rather old , the millisecond pulsars do not fit the general scheme of pulsar evolution , and most probably are re - accelerated by some external mechanism ( e.g. by accretion from a companion star in a binary system ) .",
    "the millisecond pulsars should have smaller surface magnetic field ( see eqn.([field ] ) ) , @xmath57 , and that makes them particularly interesting with respect to the high - energy @xmath0-ray emission .",
    "given such a low magnetic field , the cut - off energy of curvature photons due to the pair production ( see discussion in section  2 ) shifts to higher energies , and the maximum radiation of the millisecond pulsars should correspond to photons with energy @xmath58  ev ( usov 1983 ) .",
    "the value of the photon flux above 100  gev , estimated for @xmath54 by usov ( 1983 ) , is approximately an order of magnitude higher than that of the crab pulsar , @xmath59 .",
    "recent detailed calculations of the energy spectra of high - energy and very high energy @xmath0-ray emission from millisecond pulsars ( bulik , rudak , dyks 2000 ) in general have confirmed early expectations .",
    "pulsar @xmath60 ( @xmath61ms , @xmath62  pc ) is a prime candidate for observations in the energy range above 100  gev .",
    "its integral @xmath0-ray flux above 100  gev is expected to be as high as @xmath63 ( bulik , rudak , dyks 2000 ) , which is above the sensitivity limit of h.e.s.s .",
    "( konopelko 2000 ) . assuming rather conservative @xmath0-ray flux for @xmath60",
    "one needs a 50  hour exposure with h.e.s.s . in order to detect the pulsed @xmath0-rays .",
    "another millisecond pulsar , @xmath64 , is a good candidate for pulsed high - energy @xmath0-ray emission seen by egret , and it is certainly a valuable target for future observations with h.e.s.s .",
    "in addition to seven well established high - energy @xmath0-ray pulsars egret discovered a large number of unidentified @xmath0-ray sources at low galactic latitudes ( see kanbach 2002 ) . the recent parkes multi - beam radio surveys allowed to resolve a number of young energetic radio pulsars with some of those being in rather good positional coincidence with unidentified egret @xmath0-ray sources ( torres , butt , camilo 2001 ) .",
    "such associations resemble in many ways the established egret @xmath0-ray pulsars . for instance",
    "pulsar @xmath65 could be a counterpart of high - energy @xmath0-ray source @xmath66 ( kaspi et al . 2000 ) .",
    "it has the ninth highest value of @xmath22 , and its @xmath0-ray light - curve morphology is similar to other known @xmath0-ray pulsars , namely , two narrow peaks separated by @xmath67 in the light - curve phase .",

    "about 30 young energetic radio pulsars are currently known as positional associations with unidentified egret @xmath0-ray sources ( damico 2001 ) .",
    "in addition some of those pulsars are within the x - ray nebula , which confirms that they are plerions ( see roberts , romani , kawai 2001 ) , and may well be in addition the sources of dc high - energy @xmath0-ray emission coming from the x - ray nebula , surrounding the pulsar .",
    "such sources could be effectively studied at very high energies from the ground with an instrument like h.e.s.s .",

    "measurements of energy spectra for already established , as well as for newly discovered @xmath0-ray pulsars , will constrain the modeling of high - energy emission and in particular the location of the emitting regions with respect to the neutron star .",
    "future observations at high - energies , which can be effectively done with the ground - based erenkov instruments , will stretch the existing models and will help to understand the physics of millisecond pulsars .",
    "observations of associations of the energetic young radio pulsars at low galactic latitudes with unidentified egret @xmath0-ray sources will allow to prove that pulsars are in general powerful emitters of high - energy @xmath0-rays .",
