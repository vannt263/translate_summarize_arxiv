    "the physics of baryonic matter poses a challenge in nuclear and particle physics and is crucial to understand the equation of state relevant for compact stars and the qcd phase structure at low temperature .",
    "the difficulties in accessing compressed baryonic matter arise from the highly nonperturbative nature of strong interactions , lacking both experimental data and trustful theoretical tools .",
    "the situation is acerbated by that qcd lattice simulation suffers from the famous sign problem . as a possible way to access this difficult problem",
    ", we apply skyrme s approach@xcite , where the classical soliton solutions of the mesonic theory of qcd are interpreted as baryons in the sense of large @xmath4 limit .",
    "this model was proposed in ref .   as a natural framework to explore compressed baryonic matter by putting the skyrmions on the crystal lattice@xcite .",
    "this approach has the merit that allows one to study in a unified way the properties of elementary baryon , many - baryon systems and medium - modified hadron properties .    in pursuance of skyrme s seminal idea",
    ", we explored the nuclear matter and in - medium hadron properties by the hidden local symmetry ( hls ) lagrangian expanded to the chiral order @xmath2 including the lowest lying @xmath0 and @xmath1 vector mesons@xcite . relegating details to refs .",
    ", we give a brief summary of the main ideas and the main results of our approach . in comparison with what is available in the existing literature",
    ", our approach has the following distinctive features :    * we use a chiral effective theory of mesons , which has a self - consistent chiral counting mechanism , including pseudoscalar and lowest lying @xmath0 and @xmath1 vector mesons .",
    "the full lagrangian up to the next to leading order of the chiral counting including the homogeneous wess - zumino ( hwz ) terms is applied .",
    "* the low energy constants ( lecs ) of the effective lagrangian are self - consistently determined by a set of master formulas derived from a class of holographic qcd ( hqcd ) models .",
    "therefore , we can fix their values without ambiguity with only two input values of the pion decay constant @xmath5 and the vector meson mass @xmath6 . * using this lagrangian with the lecs determined as above , we explore the single skyrmion , skyrmion matter , and medium - modified hadron properties .",
    "the skyrmion matter is accessed by putting the skyrmions onto the face - centered cubic ( fcc ) crystal . by regarding mesons as fluctuations with respect to the skyrmion",
    ", we can study the in - medium properties of hadrons .",
    "* we include both the isovector @xmath0 meson and isoscalar @xmath1 meson to explore the different roles of these mesons in nuclear matter .    using the chiral order @xmath2 hls lagrangian we found the followings .    *",
    "compared with the original skyrme model that includes only pions , the existence of the @xmath0 meson reduces the skyrmion mass and suppresses its radius . however , the @xmath1 meson effect is exactly opposite to that of the @xmath0 meson , i.e. , with the existence of the @xmath1 the skyrmion mass is enhanced and its radius increases . *",
    "the vector mesons affect the skyrmion matter properties notably .",
    "the @xmath0 meson favors a high value for the half - skyrmion phase transition density @xmath3 , while the @xmath1 prefers a smaller value of @xmath3 .",
    "when the both effects are included @xmath3 becomes similar to the normal nuclear density @xmath7 .",
    "* in nuclear matter , @xmath8 decreases smoothly with increasing density until the density reaches @xmath3 and after that it becomes more or less a nonzero constant .",
    "moreover , the in - medium nucleon mass @xmath9 also has a similar density - dependence .",
    "these similarities are supported by the scaling of @xmath10 in the skyrme model where the skyrme parameter @xmath11 is @xmath12 .",
    "the features of our approach summarized above will be discussed in more detail in the following manner .",
    "we begin , in sec .",

    "moreover , the weak dependence of @xmath70 on density in hls@xmath61 is noticeable , which indicates that the inclusion of the @xmath0 meson reduces the soliton mass and almost saturates the bogomolnyi bound .",

    "in order to determine the lecs of our effective lagrangian we made use of the master formulas . as the simplest approximation in applying it to dense matter , we assume that the in - medium modification of all the lecs can be calculated using the in - medium values @xmath8 and @xmath97 which renders us to explore the medium modified baryon mass . with this approximation the in - medium",
    "single - skyrmion mass can be calculated and the results are hown in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] .",
    "this shows that the soliton mass @xmath98 has a nearly identical density dependence as @xmath8 .",

    "the nucleon mass staying as a constant in the half - skyrmion phase indicates the origin of the nucleon mass .",

    "we confirm the observation made by sutcliffe@xcite that the incorporation of the tower of isovector vector mesons brings the soliton mass close to the bps bound , where the lowest @xmath0 vector meson plays a striking role . as stressed by sutcliffe",
    ", this approach to the bps state would ameliorate the binding energy structure of heavy nuclei , which the skyrme model fails to describe .",
    "what is found in this work is that the presence of the isoscalar vector meson @xmath1 obstructs this approach to the bps state . whether the inclusion of the infinite tower of @xmath1 s as implied in hqcd will change this feature",

    "<S> we explore the hadron properties in dense baryonic matter in a unified way by using a skyrme model constructed with an effective lagrangian which includes the @xmath0 and @xmath1 vector mesons as hidden gauge bosons and is valid up to @xmath2 in chiral expansion including the homogeneous wess - zumino terms . with the two input values of pion decay constant and the lowest lying vector meson mass which can be fixed in free space , all the other low energy constants in the effective lagrangian </S>",
    "<S> are determined by their master formulas derived from holographic qcd models , which allows us to study the baryonic matter properties with no additional free parameters and thus without ambiguities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the @xmath1 field that figures in the homogeneous wess - zumino term plays a crucial role in the skyrmion structure and its matter properties . </S>",
    "<S> the most striking and intriguing observation is that the pion decay constant that smoothly drops with increasing density in the skyrmion phase stops decreasing at @xmath3 at which the skyrmions in medium fractionize into half - skyrmions and remains nearly constant in the half - skyrmion phase . in accordance with the large @xmath4 consideration , the baryon mass also stays non - scaling in the half - skyrmion phase . </S>",
    "<S> this feature is supported by the nuclear effective field theory with the parameters of the lagrangian scaling modified at the skyrmion  half - skyrmion phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> our exploration also uncovers the crucial role of the @xmath1 meson in multi - baryon systems as well as in the structure of a single skyrmion . </S>"
