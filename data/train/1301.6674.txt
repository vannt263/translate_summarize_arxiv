    "as of november , 2012 , more than 800 extra - solar planetary systems have been detected , and @xmath8 additional candidate systems from the _ kepler _ mission are waiting to be confirmed @xcite .",
    "one of the primary goals of the ongoing radial velocity ( rv ) and transit surveys is to identify a terrestrial mass planet ( @xmath9m@xmath10 ) in the so - called habitable zone ( hz ) , which is traditionally defined as the circumstellar region in which a terrestrial - mass planet with a @xmath0-@xmath1-n@xmath11 atmosphere can sustain liquid water on its surface @xcite .",
    "several potential hz planet candidates have already been detected , @xcite and it is expected that this number will greatly increase as time passes @xcite . in the near future we may be able to study habitable planets orbiting nearby m stars .",
    "these planets are relatively close to their parent stars , leading to shorter orbital periods and an increase in the probability of a transit .",
    "nasa s _ james webb space telescope _ ( jwst ) , scheduled to launch in 2018 ,",
    "is considered to be marginally capable of obtaining a transit spectrum of an earth - like planet orbiting a late m dwarf @xcite .",
    "several other surveys are either underway ( * ? ? ?",
    "* mearth ) or getting ready to be commissioned ( * ? ? ?",
    "* hpf ) in an attempt to discover rocky planets in the hzs of low mass stars .",
    "the hz limits that were cited in many recent discoveries were obtained from 1-d radiative - convective , cloud - free climate model calculations by @xcite . for our sun",
    ", these authors estimated the boundaries of the hz to be @xmath12 au for the inner edge and @xmath13 au for the outer edge .",
    "these values represent the `` water loss '' and `` maximum greenhouse '' limits , respectively .",
    "other , less conservative limits for the inner edge are the `` runaway greenhouse '' and `` recent venus '' limits .",
    "the latter estimate is empirical , based on the inference that venus has not had liquid water on its surface for at least the last 1 billion years @xcite . for the outer edge , there is a corresponding `` early mars '' empirical estimate , based on the inference that mars did have liquid water on its surface 3.8 billion years ago .",
    "( the `` 1st @xmath0 condensation '' limit of @xcite , should now be disregarded , as it has been shown that @xmath0 clouds generally warm a planet s climate @xcite ) .",
    "some studies have investigated the effects of clouds on planetary emission spectra of earth - like planets in a 1d model @xcite , while others studied the habitability of specific systems , particularly gl 581 , in 1d @xcite and 3d @xcite .",
    "several other studies @xcite parameterized these results to estimate relationships between hz boundaries and stellar parameters for stars of different spectral types .",
    "although these studies provided useful estimates of the hz width , the @xcite model has become outdated , for several reasons :    1 .",
    "@xcite used ` band models ' for @xmath1 and @xmath0 absorption in the thermal - infrared .",
    "these coefficients were considered valid up to @xmath14 k. these coefficients were later replaced @xcite by coefficients generated using the correlated-_k _ technique @xcite . a line - by - line ( lbl ) radiative transfer model , in this case lblrtm @xcite , was used to generate detailed spectra for @xmath1 and @xmath0 at a variety of different temperatures and pressures .",
    "once the detailed spectra were calculated , separate broad - band k - coefficients for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 were generated by r. freedman using standard procedures .",
    "but these coefficients were only derived for temperatures @xmath15 k and should therefore underestimate thermal - ir absorption in warm , moist greenhouse atmospheres .",
    "( this prediction was verified by direct experimentation with that model . )",
    "furthermore , the coefficients adopted by @xcite and used in subsequent climate modeling studies by the kasting research group were obtained using hitran 1996 database and had not been updated since then .",
    "recent studies @xcite have pointed that the @xcite model may have significantly overestimated absorption of thermal - ir radiation by collision - induced absorption ( cia ) bands of @xmath0 , which may affect the outer edge of the hz .",
    "the @xcite calculations spanned stellar effective temperatures from @xmath5 k to @xmath16 k , corresponding approximately to stellar classes f0 to m0 .",
    "stellar effective temperature affects the hz boundaries because the radiation from f stars is bluer relative to that from the sun , whereas the radiation from k and m stars is redder , and this affects calculated planetary albedos .",
    "the hz limits from @xcite model do not include m stars with effective temperatures lower than @xmath16 k. as pointed out above , such stars are promising candidates for current observational surveys because their hzs are closer to the star .",
    "therefore , potential rocky planets in the hzs will have shorter orbital periods and higher probability of transit .",
    "in this paper we address all the above major issues with the goal of deriving new , improved estimates for the boundaries of the hz .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows : in  [ model ] we describe our 1-d cloud - free climate model , corresponding model updates and model validation with other studies . in  [ results ] we present results from our climate model and discuss various hz limits for our earth . ",
    "[ fgkm ] presents hz boundaries around f , g , k and m spectral stellar spectral types , then provides a generalized expression to calculate hz boundaries and compares these boundaries with previous studies .",
    "we discuss the implications of these new results for currently known exoplanet planetary systems in  [ discussion ] and present our conclusions in  [ conclusions ] .",
    "we used a one - dimensional , radiative - convective , cloud - free climate model based on @xcite for the inner edge of the hz ( ihz ) and @xcite for the outer edge of the hz ( ohz ) calculations .",
    "following @xcite , we assumed an earth - mass planet with an @xmath1 ( ihz ) or @xmath0 ( ohz ) dominated atmosphere for our base model .",
    "sensitivity studies for different planetary masses are described in the following section .",
    "both the inner and outer edge calculations relied on so - called `` inverse climate modeling '' , in which the surface temperature is specified , and the model is used to calculate the corresponding solar flux needed to sustain it . to do this ,",
    "the atmosphere was divided into @xmath17 layers , and a specific pressure - temperature profile was assumed . for the inner edge ,",
    "this consisted of a moist pseudoadiabat extending from the surface up to an isothermal ( 200 k ) stratosphere .",
    "methodology for calculating the pseudoadiabat was taken from appendix a of @xcite .",
    "the surface temperature was varied from 200 - 2200 k during the course of the calculations .",
    "for the outer edge , the surface temperature was fixed at 273 k , and the @xmath0 partial pressure was varied from 1 to 37.8 bar ( the saturation @xmath0 partial pressure at that temperature ) .",
    "a moist @xmath1 adiabat was assumed in the lower troposphere , and a moist @xmath0 adiabat was used in the upper troposphere when condensation was encountered , following the methodology in appendix b of @xcite .",
    "@xmath1 and @xmath0 clouds are neglected in the model , but the effect of the former is accounted for by increasing the surface albedo , as done in previous climate simulations by the kasting research group @xcite . it has been argued that this methodology tends to overestimate the greenhouse effect of dense @xmath0 atmospheres @xcite . by contrast , our neglect of @xmath0 clouds may cause us to underestimate the greenhouse effect of such atmospheres @xcite .",
    "realistically determining the effects of clouds would require a 3-d climate model , as most clouds form in updrafts , which are absent in 1-d models .",
    "some 1-d climate modeling studies include partial cloud coverage @xcite and/or parameterized microphysical cloud model @xcite , but we do not consider them here because we can not model them self - consistently in our model .",
    "the effects of clouds on the inner and outer edge boundaries are qualitatively understood , as discussed later in the paper .",
    "testing these predictions quantitatively using 3-d climate models should be a fruitful topic for future research .",
    "radiative transfer was handled by methods used in recent versions of the kasting group climate model but with updated absorption coefficients ( see next section ) .",
    "a @xmath18 two - stream approximation @xcite was used to calculate the net absorbed solar radiation for each of the @xmath17 layers , using separate eight - term , correlated-@xmath19 coefficients for both @xmath0 and @xmath1 to parameterize absorption in each of the @xmath20 solar spectral intervals ranging from @xmath21 m . these terms are convolved with each other in each spectral interval , resulting in 64 separate radiative transfer calculations per interval .",
    "the solar flux was averaged over six zenith angles ( 11.0@xmath22 , 25.3@xmath22 , 39.6@xmath22 , 54@xmath22 , 68.4@xmath22 , 82.8@xmath22 ) using gaussian quadrature .",
    "the net outgoing infrared radiation per layer was calculated using separate eight - term correlated-@xmath19 coefficients for @xmath1 and @xmath0 in @xmath23 spectral intervals extending from @xmath24 @xmath25 .",
    "we used double gauss quadrature in place of a standard gaussian scheme @xcite using a code written by ramirez .",
    "half of the k - coefficients are chosen within the g - space interval 0.95 - 1.00 for improved resolution of the steeply rising portion of the cumulative distribution function , yielding smoother stratospheric temperature behavior .",
    "these coefficients also needed to be convolved with each other , as in the solar calculation .",
    "this produces 8@xmath26 8 @xmath26 55 @xmath27 3520 separate thermal - ir",
    "radiative transfer calculations at each time step in the climate model .",
    "this number is multiplied by a factor of 6 when we include @xmath28 in the model , using 6-term sums , and by another factor of 6 when we include c@xmath11h@xmath29 .",
    "thus , from a practical standpoint , the utility of this approach diminishes as the number of included greenhouse gases increases .",
    "the following are the most significant updates to the climate model :    1 .",
    "we have derived new _",
    "k- _ coefficients using a tool called kspectrum .",
    "it is a program to produce high - resolution spectrum of any gas mixture , in any thermodynamical conditions , from line - by - line ( lbl ) databases such as hitran 2008 @xcite and hitemp 2010 @xcite .",
    "it is intended to produce reliable spectra , which can then be used to compute k - distribution data sets that may be used for subsequent radiative transfer analysis .",
    "the source code and a detailed description of the program is available at http://code.google.com / p / kspectrum/. + we have produced two sets of coefficients , one using hitran 2008 and another using the hitemp 2010 database .",
    "for the hitran database we generated a matrix of 8-term absorption coefficients for both @xmath1 and @xmath0 , using kspectrum , for the following range of pressures and temperatures : @xmath30 $ ] and @xmath31 $ ] . in the case of hitemp , 8-term absorption coefficients were derived only for @xmath1 , as our ihz is @xmath1-dominated at high temperatures ( @xmath32 k ) with only trace amounts of @xmath0 ( 330 parts per million ) .",
    "the following grid was used to derive the @xmath1 hitemp coefficients : @xmath33 $ ] and @xmath34 $ ] .",
    "the grid is condensed because of the high number of line transitions in the hitemp database compared to hitran .",
    "the computational resources needed to derive absorption coefficients for the entire range of pressure & temperatures would be prohibitively large . moreover , as discussed further below , we justify the selection of this condensed grid by showing that the differences in coefficients generated from hitran and hitemp become negligible below 350 k. + in generating the @xmath35coefficients , we have used different methodologies for @xmath0 and @xmath1 . for co2 , we truncated the spectral lines at @xmath36 @xmath25 from the line center .",
    "experimental evidence indicates that the absorption by @xmath0 is overestimated if lorentzian line shapes are used @xcite .",
    "therefore , we used the prescription of @xcite for ` sub - lorentzian ' absorption in the far wings of the lines when running kspectrum . for @xmath1",
    ", we truncated the spectral lines @xmath37 @xmath25 and overlaid a semi - empirical `` continuum absorption '' .",
    "the lorentz line shape is known to underestimate absorption for @xmath1 in the far wings @xcite , possibly because of the tendency of @xmath1 to form dimers .",
    "the corresponding continuum absorption is therefore ` super - lorenztian ' for @xmath1 , and we have used the ` bps ' formalism of @xcite to parameterize this absorption .",
    "we have included rayleigh scattering by water vapor , as it can become important for wavelengths up to @xmath38 m ( which is where the wien peak occurs for low mass stars ) .",
    "rayleigh scattering by water was also considered by @xcite , but these authors used the scattering coefficient for air because the coefficient for @xmath1 was not available , or at least not known to them . the following expression for the scattering crosssection",
    "was adopted @xcite : @xmath39 here , @xmath40 is the depolarization ratio ( @xmath41 for @xmath1 , @xcite ) , @xmath42 is the wavelength ( @xmath43)-dependent refractivity which is calculated as @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 is obtained from eq.(4 ) of @xcite , and @xmath43 is in microns . by comparison , @xcite used a @xmath1 rayleigh scattering cross - section of @xmath46 @xmath47 at @xmath48 m . evaluating eq.([rayl ] ) at @xmath49 m",
    "gives a value of @xmath50 @xmath47 , which is similar to the @xcite value .",
    "previous climate model calculations by our group and others @xcite parametrized collision - induced absorption ( cia ) by @xmath0 near @xmath51 m and beyond @xmath52 m by the formulation given in the appendix of @xcite .",
    "this process is an important source of thermal - ir opacity in the types of dense , @xmath0-rich atmospheres predicted to be found near the outer edge of the habitable zone . in our model",
    "we have updated @xmath0-cia using the parametrization described in @xcite .",
    "4 .   the shomate equation was used to calculate new heat capacity ( @xmath53 ) relationships for @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "notably , at low temperatures , the heat capacity for @xmath0 decreased by @xmath54 relative to values in our previous model .",
    "this increased the dry adiabatic lapse rate , @xmath55 where @xmath56 is gravity , by an equivalent amount but had surprisingly little effect on computed surface temperatures , apparently because the steeper lapse rate in the upper troposphere was largely compensated by a decrease in tropopause height .",
    "see @xcite for further details .",
    "we have checked the accuracy of our climate model by comparing the output both with published results and with the 1-d line - by - line radiative transfer model smart ( _ spectral mapping atmospheric radiative transfer _ ) developed by d. crisp @xcite .",
    "smart is a well - tested model @xcite which accesses some of the same databases as does kspectrum ; however , its development and implementation are entirely independent . by comparing specific cases of interest with smart",
    ", we can gain confidence that our calculated fluxes are correct , or at least that they are consistent with our assumptions about @xmath0 and @xmath1 line shapes .",
    "for all our climate models that are compared with smart , we used 70 atmospheric layers ( we use 101 layers for all our hz calculations ) .",
    "we could not use 101 layers in our flux comparisons due to numerical accuracy issues with smart at high enough vertical resolution , although 70 layers produced a sufficiently accurate result with smart .",
    "dense @xmath0-rich atmospheres have been suggested as warming agents for early mars @xcite .",
    "planets close to the outer edge of the hz may develop dense , @xmath0-rich atmospheres as a consequence of outgassing from volcanism , which can only be balanced by surface weathering if the planets surface temperature remains above freezing .",
    "the @xmath0 feedback effect fails at some distance because @xmath0 begins to condense out of the atmosphere , lowering the tropospheric lapse rate and reducing the greenhouse effect .",
    "@xmath0 is also an effective rayleigh scatterer ( 2.5 times better than air ) , and so a dense @xmath0 atmosphere is predicted to have a high albedo , which offsets its greenhouse effect @xcite .",
    "the ohz boundary can then be taken as this `` maximum greenhouse limit '' where rayleigh scattering by @xmath0 begins to outweigh the greenhouse effect .",

    "our model has a coarser spectral resolution than does smart , and it appears that between @xmath64 and @xmath65 @xmath25 the differences could become important . but this is compensated by the fact that our olr in these intervals can be considered as a running average of the olr from smart .",
    "nevertheless , most of the difference in the olr arises from significant absorption in the @xmath66 @xmath25 ( 15 micron ) vibrational band of @xmath0 which is closer to the peak of the black - body curve .",
    "a similar study for early mars conditions with a 2-bar @xmath0 atmosphere was considered by @xcite .",
    "they have also used kspectrum to derive their absorption coefficients and truncated the spectral lines at @xmath36 @xmath25 from the line center for @xmath0 , as done here .",

    "we wish to compare the outgoing ir calculated from hitran & hitemp databases with and without overlaying the continuum absorption .",
    "[ bps ] shows two significant differences :    1 .   the limiting value of @xmath80 which leads to a runaway greenhouse happens at a much higher value ( 440 wm@xmath60 , black & green curves ) when the bps @xmath1 continuum formalism is not implemented , and at a lower @xmath80 ( 291 wm@xmath60 , red & blue curves ) when the bps continuum is included in our model .",
    "the continuum is based on measurements of absorption in the water vapor window regions ( i.e @xmath96 @xmath25 and @xmath97 @xmath25 ) . at high temperatures ,",
    "the contribution of the continuum absorption in these window regions becomes significant , and this , in turn , decreases the outgoing ir flux .",
    "the moist - greenhouse ( water loss ) limit moves much closer to the sun ( to 0.87 au ) when continuum absorption is not included , as compared to 0.99 au when it is included in our model .",
    "this is a direct consequence of the differences in @xmath80 described above : when @xmath80 increases with the continuum turned off , @xmath79 ( ratio of @xmath80 to @xmath81 ) increases and the ihz distance @xmath98 decreases .",
    "the result can be understood physically by noting that in the model where the continuum is absent , the planet needs more effective solar flux to maintain a given surface temperature because more thermal - ir radiation leaks away into space ; hence , the ihz boundary must move inward .",
    "+ a similar change can be seen in the runaway greenhouse limit : the ` no bps ' model transitions to runaway at a higher @xmath79 than does the ` with bps ' model .",
    "the corresponding runaway greenhouse limit changes from 0.97 au ( with continuum absorption ) to 0.76 au ( without continuum absorption ) . fig .",
    "[ bps ] also shows that the upturn in @xmath80 beyond 800 k happens at lower surface temperatures when continuum absorption is not included .",
    "it should be remembered that this upturn in @xmath80 happens because , as the surface warms , the region in the troposphere over which the temperature profile follows a dry adiabat expands upward , while the moist convective layer in the upper troposphere becomes thinner .",
    "eventually , when the moist convective region ( the cloud layer ) begins thin enough , radiation emitted from the dry adiabatic portion of the atmosphere begins to escape to space .",
    "the dry adiabatic lapse rate is steeper than the moist adiabatic lapse rate by about a factor of 9 ( @xmath99 k / km vs. 1.1 k / km ) ; hence , the emitted radiation flux is much higher .",
    "this can be understood from the integrated form of schwarzchild s equation , which shows that the emitted flux is proportional to the temperature gradient .",
    "( see , e.g. , eq . a4 in @xcite ) unlike @xcite , we find that the emitted flux increases at all thermal - ir wavelengths shorter than 4 @xmath100 m .",

    "<S> the inner edge of the hz in @xcite model was determined by loss of water , and the outer edge was determined by the maximum greenhouse provided by a @xmath0 atmosphere . </S>",

    "<S> additional calculations are performed for stars with effective temperatures between @xmath4 k and @xmath5 k , and the results are presented in parametric form , making them easy to apply to actual stars . </S>",
    "<S> the new model indicates that , near the inner edge of the hz , there is no clear distinction between runaway greenhouse and water loss limits for stars with t@xmath6 k which has implications for ongoing planet searches around k and m stars . to assess the potential habitability of extrasolar terrestrial planets , we propose using stellar flux incident on a planet rather than equilibrium temperature </S>",
    "<S> this removes the dependence on planetary ( bond ) albedo , which varies depending upon the host star s spectral type . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that conservative estimates of the hz ( water loss and maximum greenhouse limits ) should be used for current rv surveys and _ kepler _ mission to obtain a lower limit on @xmath7 , so that future flagship missions like _ tpf - c _ and _ darwin _ are not undersized . </S>",
    "<S> our model does not include the radiative effects of clouds ; thus , the actual hz boundaries may extend further in both directions than the estimates just given .    </S>",
