    "<S> we analyze hadro - chemical freeze - out in central pb+pb collisions at cern sps energies , employing the hybrid version of urqmd which models hadronization by the cooper - frye mechanism , and matches to a final hadron - resonance cascade . </S>",
    "<S> we fit the results both before and after the cascade stage using the statistical hadronization model , to assess the effect of the cascade phase . </S>",
    "<S> we observe a strong effect on antibaryon yields except anti-@xmath0 , resulting in a shift in @xmath1 and @xmath2 . </S>",
    "<S> we discuss the implications for the freeze - out curve .    </S>",
    "<S> hadron production in relativistic a+a collisions is supposed , since bevalac times  @xcite , to proceed via two separate freeze - out stages . </S>",
    "<S> the first , `` hadro - chemical '' freeze - out fixes the hadronic yields per species , and their ratios , which are conserved throughout the subsequent hadron - resonance cascade expansion . at its end </S>",
    "<S> , `` kinetic freeze - out '' delivers the eventually observed bulk properties such as @xmath3 spectra , hbt correlations , collective flow properties , etc .. most remarkably , the hadronic yield distributions over species is understood to resemble a grand canonical statistical gibbs equilibrium ensemble  @xcite , from ags up to rhic / lhc energies . </S>",
    "<S> its two most relevant parameters , temperature @xmath1 and baryochemical potential @xmath2 , thus capture a snapshot of the system dynamical evolution , taken at the instant of hadro - chemical freeze - out .    in relativistic a+a collisions the thus determined @xmath1 increases monotonically with @xmath4 , saturating at about 170  mev ( the a+a hagedorn temperature ) while @xmath2  approaches zero </S>",
    "<S> . systematic statistical model ( sm ) analysis reveals the `` freeze - out curve ''  @xcite in the @xmath5 plane , in which we usually also represent the conjectured plot of the phase diagram of qcd matter .    </S>",
    "<S> such a plot is given in figure  [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> it shows two principal lines , firstly a parton - hadron coexistence boundary line , inferred from lattice qcd  @xcite at low @xmath2 , and from chiral restoration theory  @xcite at high @xmath2 . and , second , the sm freeze - out curve . </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the lines merge toward @xmath6  mev , @xmath7 . </S>",
    "<S> the freeze - out curve locates the qcd hadronization transition temperature @xmath8 : hadronization thus coincides with hadronic freeze - out , here . </S>",
    "<S> equally remarkable , however , the two lines disentangle with increasing @xmath2 , becoming spaced by about 30 mev temperature difference toward @xmath9  mev which corresponds to @xmath10  gev in a+a collisions .    </S>",
    "<S> what are we freezing out from , here ? </S>",
    "<S> a phase transition like the parton - hadron transition at small @xmath2  would offer conditions that establish a grand canonical species equilibrium  @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> recent ideas concerning a further qcd phase at high @xmath2 , of quarkyonic matter  @xcite , come to mind . indicated in figure  [ fig:1 ] is a scenario in which the freeze - out curve is identified , tentatively , with a hypothetical quarkyonic matter phase boundary .    before embarking on this idea </S>",
    "<S> a different possible situation needs to be addressed . </S>",
    "<S> taking for granted that the hadron - resonance phase is indeed created at the coexistence curve it might be conceivable that an expansive hadron / resonance evolution stage , setting in at @xmath8 and @xmath11 , cools down the population maintaining chemical equilibrium until chemical freeze - out occurs by mere dilution ( the inelastic mean free path becoming longer than the system size ) , at lower @xmath1 , higher @xmath2 , thus defining the freeze - out curve .    </S>",
    "<S> in this note we test the latter scenario . </S>",
    "<S> we employ the framework of the microscopic transport model urqmd . </S>",
    "<S> its recent hybrid version  @xcite features a 3 + 1 hydrodynamic expansion during the high density stage , terminated by the cooper - frye hadronization mechanism once the energy density of flow cells falls below a `` critical '' energy density . </S>",
    "<S> this criterion resembles hadronization at the coexistence line of figure  [ fig:1 ] . </S>",
    "<S> the hadron / resonance population can be examined , either , by terminating the evolution at this stage , emitting into vacuum , and fitting the yield distribution by the grand canonical statistical model  @xcite . alternatively , </S>",
    "<S> the urqmd hadron / resonance cascade expansion stage is attached , as an `` afterburner '' . </S>",
    "<S> the outcome is again fitted by the sm . </S>",
    "<S> will the afterburner cool the system in equilibrium , to start from @xmath8 and arrive at @xmath1 on the freeze - out curve ?    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:2 ] shows the effect of the final urqmd cascade stage , in a plot of hadron multiplicities directly after the hydro stage , vs. the multiplicities at the end of the cascade . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate these conditions for central pb+pb collisions at the sps energies @xmath12 and @xmath13  gev . </S>",
    "<S> we see the bulk hadrons unaffected by the afterburner , including the @xmath14 , @xmath0 and @xmath15 . whereas the other antibaryons , @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are significantly and selectively suppressed .    </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:3 ] illustrates the fits to the hybrid urqmd results by the statistical model , choosing the @xmath13  gev case as an example . </S>",
    "<S> the afterburner stage indeed shifts ( @xmath19 ) considerably , from ( 162 , 250 ) to ( 153 , 261 ) . </S>",
    "<S> however , note the dramatic decrease of fit quality , from 4.4 to 21.5 in @xmath20 . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of the afterburner is , thus , not an in - equilibrium cooling but rather a distortion of the hadron yield distribution , away from equilibrium - as we could guess from figure  [ fig:2 ] already . </S>",
    "<S> the idea arises to exclude @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 from the sm fit . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:4 ] shows an example , again at @xmath13  gev . </S>",
    "<S> no cooling occurs . </S>",
    "<S> the fit to the afterburner output ( which features a tolerable @xmath20 ) now ignores the far off - diagonal @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 entries .    </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that the hadron / resonance cascade as modelled in the microscopic dynamics of urqmd can not transport an initially established hadrochemical equilibrium from the phase coexistence line of figure  [ fig:1 ] , down to the freeze - out line . </S>",
    "<S> however , it distorts the hadron yield distribution which leads to a downward shift of the freezeout parameters derived from sm analysis , albeit at the cost of rather unsatisfactory @xmath20 .    turning to sm analysis of real sps data , we note , first , that the @xmath20 values obtained from a parallel sm analysis of the na49 data  @xcite , which are exhibited in figure  [ fig:1 ] , </S>",
    "<S> were also found to be rather high . </S>",
    "<S> the idea thus arises to suppose effects in the data , similar to some extent to our urqmd findings . </S>",
    "<S> figure  [ fig:5 ] thus shows a prediction of the sm to the na49 data at @xmath13  gev where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are excluded from the fit . very much reminiscent of figure  [ fig:4 ] ( right ) , the sm fit here moves up from @xmath21  mev ( figure  [ fig:1 ] ) to above 170  mev , at reasonable @xmath20 : far above the conventional freeze - out curve at this energy . </S>",
    "<S> we shall thus revisit the freeze - out curve at @xmath2  from about 280 to 430  mev , obtained , hitherto , from an `` unfiltered '' application of the statistical model . at the much higher rhic energies , with @xmath2  approaching zero </S>",
    "<S> , we may expect a smaller such effect of the cascade stage because of the approximate baryon - antibaryon symmetry . </S>"
