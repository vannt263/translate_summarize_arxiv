    "it is well known that the energy spectrum does not provide sufficient information to determine the dynamics of mass accretion in x - ray binaries .",
    "this information can be obtained from the independent variability measurements .",
    "one of the frequently used variability measures is the phase or time lag of hard x - rays with respect to the soft ones . because in comptonization , the energy of the escaping photons increases with their residence time in the scattering medium , the hard photons lag with respect to softer ones by amounts which depend on the photon scattering time .",
    "thus , observations of these time lags provide a measure of the local electron density , a quantity inaccessible to the spectral analysis alone .",
    "since the high energy radiation is believed to be produced in the vicinity of the compact object of the size of a few radii , these lags should be roughly of the order @xmath0 msec or shorter .",
    "observations of these lags , however , have given results drastically different from our expectations : the lags measured from the black hole candidate cyg x-1 obtained by ginga @xcite has revealed that these lags increase linearly with increasing fourier period to @xmath1 sec for frequency @xmath2 hz ( figure 1a ) .",
    "similar results were obtained by the analysis of the higher quality rxte data from the high state of the same source @xcite ( figure 3b ) .",
    "analysis of the ginga data from the source gx 339 - 4@xcite and the rxte data from grs 1758 - 258(@xcite , figure 1b ) gave the similar dependence , with @xmath3 extending in the latter source to @xmath4 sec for @xmath5 hz ! finally , the high energy transient gro j0422 + 32 was observed by osse during outburst and the lags indicated a similar behavior ( @xcite , figure 2a ) .",
    "these results suggest that the _ frequency - dependent hard x - ray time lags may be a common property of these sources_.    -0.5truecm",
    "kazanas , hua & titarchuk @xcite proposed that the discrepancy between expectation and observation can be resolved if the the corona of comptonizing electrons is non - uniform and extending over several orders of magnitude in radius .",
    "specifically , they proposed the following density profile for the comptonizing medium : @xmath6 where the power index @xmath7 is a free parameter ; @xmath8 is the radial distance from the center of the spherical corona ; @xmath9 and @xmath10 are its radii of the inner and outer edges respectively .",
    "the density profile of eq .",
    "( 1 ) allows scattering to take place over a wide range of densities , thereby introducing time lags over a similar range of time , leading to the observed @xmath11dependent lags .    in particular , we considered density profiles with @xmath12 and 3/2 .",
    "a soft photon from a source located near @xmath13 would undergo the scattering process , which increases its energy and introduces hard photon time lags proportional to the scattering mean free time in the medium @xcite .",
    "the majority of the data available to - date ( figures 1a , 1b , 2a and 3b ) are consistent with the @xmath12 density profile .",
    "the density profile with @xmath14 , implied by the advection - dominated accretion model suggested by narayan & yi ( @xcite ) would result in a weaker dependence on fourier period .",
    "there are indications of such a dependence in the recent cyg x-1 data in its hard state ( @xcite , figure 2b ) and during the transitions @xcite .",
    "_ the above arguments , thus , lead us to the notion that that these lags can be used to probe the density structure of the corona . _",
    "these arguments have been verified by numerical simulation of the spectral - temporal properties of the comptonization process in media with density profile given by eq .",
    "( 1 ) ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) . the simulations also show that the density distribution of the comptonizing electrons can significantly affect the emergent spectrum .",
    "figure 3a displays the energy spectra of comptonizing coronae of various density profiles with properly chosen optical depths . these coronae give rise to spectra that can fit the batse data of cyg x-1 @xcite equally well",
    "this fact shows that fitting the spectra alone does not suffice to determine the optical depth @xmath15 if the density profile is unknown .    on the other hand ,",
    "the analysis of the lags between photons in the high and low energy ranges , resulting from comptonization in the above three coronae , yields widely different results ( figure 3b ) .",
    "also plotted in the figure are the lags obtained from the rxte observation @xcite whose corresponding photon spectrum is given in figure 3a .",
    "it is obvious that the observation favors the non - uniform electron density distributions , specifically the profile with @xmath16 .",
    "all the fits of the lags in figures 1a , 2a , 2b and 3b require that _ the outer edge of the coronae be at a distance as great as @xmath17 light second , or @xmath18 cm _ !",
    "this conclusion is rather inescapable , since the observed lags and energy spectra require scattering free path of the order 1 light second and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "it is clear that 1 ) appropriate modeling of the time properties of accreting compact sources suggests a very different picture than that assumed to - date in modeling their spectra , with direct consequences for the associated dynamics and 2 ) realistic models must consider the associated time variability properties of the system .",
    "the physically meaningful way to model these type of sources is through combined spectral - temporal models . -1.0truecm"
