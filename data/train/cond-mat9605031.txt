    "<S> we have used the hartree - fock random phase approximation ( hf - rpa ) to study the interacting electron gas in a quantum wire . </S>",

    "<S> the long wavelength dispersions of the intrasubband collective spin - density excitations are linear , but the sound velocities are renormalised due to the exchange interaction and screening </S>",
    "<S> . the in - phase intrasubband charge - density excitation has the long wavelength form @xmath0^{1/2}$ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we found good qualitative agreement of our results with experimental observations .    </S>",
    "<S> a semiconductor quantum wire can be fabricated by applying a voltage with a microstructured gate to a 2d electron gas . </S>",
    "<S> the single - particle energy ( spe ) spectrum typically consists of subbands separated by several @xmath1 . at a 1d electron density about @xmath2@xmath3 </S>",
    "<S> more than one subband can be occupied . in recent years progress has been made in spectroscopic study of such systems . in angular </S>",
    "<S> resolved raman spectra of gaas quantum wires@xcite , collective spin - density excitations ( sde ) and charge - density excitations ( cde , or plasmons ) were observed . </S>",
    "<S> the measured spectra cover from low to high frequency , and for low - frequency intrasubband excitations , the wave - vector dependence of the spin - wave energy was found to be linear . </S>",
    "<S> the correct interpretation of these experiments allows us not only to understand the interesting physical processes , but also to access important physical parameters .    </S>",
    "<S> the exchange interaction is crucial to the collective intrasubband and intersubband sde . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the direct long range coulomb interaction which leads to the depolarisation shift of single - particle excitations and to the appearance of collective plasma modes , exchange interaction gives rise to the red - shift of spe . if the red - shift is sufficiently large , the collective sde with a sizable oscillator strength splits off the continuum of spe . for semiconductor quantum wells </S>",
    "<S> , such split - off appears in the hartree - fock random phase approximation ( hf - rpa)@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , it is important to perform a hf - rpa analysis on collective electron excitations in a realistic gaas quantum wire with full coulomb interaction , and compare the results with measured spectra@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the selfconsistent and conserving@xcite hf - rpa is suitable for this task , because we will calculate the two - particle spectra but not single - particle properties . as in using any approximation </S>",
    "<S> , the hf - rpa calculation also contains error . however , our hf - rpa results agree very well with experimental measurements .    in this letter we will first outline the hf - rpa method to express the spin or charge correlation functions in terms of the corresponding spin- or charge - density induced matrix , which satisfies an eigenvalue matrix equation . in a realistic quantum wire , for high energy intrasubband excitations and for excitation spectra when more than one subband is occupied , the self - consistent equations have to be solved numerically . </S>",
    "<S> however , for the case that only one subband is occupied , the analytical expressions of sde and cde are derived . with additional approximation applied to the hf - rpa analytical solutions </S>",
    "<S> , they reduce to known results . </S>",
    "<S> this may be coincidental , but is outside the central theme of this letter .    to define the quantum wire , let us start from an electron gas in a narrow quantum well with interfaces parallel to the @xmath4-@xmath5 plane , and the well width shorter than any other relevant length scales . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the realistic experimental situation that only the lowest subband in the quantum well is occupied , so the motion of electrons in the @xmath6 direction can be ignored . by applying a properly designed gate potential , </S>",
    "<S> a quantum wire along the @xmath4 axis is fabricated with a longitudinal constant electrostatic potential , but a transverse parabolic one @xmath7/2 along the @xmath5 axis , where @xmath8 is the electronic effective mass . </S>",
    "<S> the quantum wire has a finite length @xmath9 , and we assume periodic boundary conditions . in the absence of electron - electron interaction , the single particle eigenfunctions are simply @xmath10=@xmath11 , with the corresponding eigenenergies @xmath12=@xmath13+@xmath14+@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the subband index , @xmath17=@xmath18 , and @xmath19 the harmonic oscillator wave function . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse confinement length of the electrons is @xmath20=@xmath21^{1/2}$ ] .    </S>",
    "<S> when the electron - electron interaction is turned on , we will use the hf approximation @xmath22 to derive a complete orthonormal basis @xmath23 of quasi - particle hartree - fock states , where @xmath24 is the hartree - fock energy , @xmath25 is the fermi occupation factor and @xmath26 the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium . in terms of this basis set , we will use the corresponding time dependent hf ( hf - rpa ) to calculate the charge - density and the spin - density correlation functions , which describe the self - consistent linear response of the electron gas to an external perturbation . in this letter </S>",
    "<S> , we restrict ourselves to the nonmagnetic ground state .    for inelastic light scattering not close to the band gap resonance , the raman intensities in polarised and depolarised scattering geometries are proportional , respectively , to the imaginary parts of the charge - charge correlation function and spin - spin correlation function@xcite . </S>",

    "<S> when @xmath30=@xmath38 , there is no direct coulomb interaction ( hartree term ) between the excited spins . </S>",
    "<S> if the exchange term ( fock term ) is neglected , the spin - density excitation spectra are simply given by the quasi - particle hartree - fock energies . in hf - rpa , </S>",
    "<S> the spin - density excitations are shifted from the quasi - particle hartree - fock energies due to the exchange terms . as a result </S>",
    "<S> , collective spin - density excitation may appear in the spectra . </S>",
    "<S> this shift is a measure of the effective strength of the exchange term in the system .    </S>",
    "<S> we will use the above hf - rpa analysis to investigate collective excitations in a multisubband system . </S>",
    "<S> this has to be done numerically , and the first step is to derive the quasiparticle basis set @xmath23 by solving ( [ hfground ] ) self - consistently via iteration </S>",
    "<S> . the functional basis must be sufficient large in order to ensure the required accuracy for the quasiparticle energy spectra and the spatial electron density of the ground state . when using this self - consistent quasiparticle basis set to calculate collective excitations , the required accuracy for the peak position of an excitation energy is the experimental linewidth @xmath390.1 @xmath1 .    </S>",
    "<S> the intrinsic materials parameters of a gaas quantum wire required in our calculation are @xmath8=@xmath40 and @xmath26=12.4 , where @xmath41 is the electron mass . </S>",
    "<S> the extrinsic sample parameters are the total electron density @xmath16 , the transverse potential @xmath42 , and the length of the quantum wire @xmath9 . </S>",
    "<S> our calculations are based on a sample with @xmath16=10.4@xmath43@xmath44 @xmath45 , which has been investigated experimentally in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the transverse potential @xmath42 is determined by the experimental conditions . since the experimental sample does not have a parabolic potential as can be seen from the intersubband cde </S>",
    "<S> , we will adjust @xmath46 to fit the subband electron occupations . </S>",
    "<S> when we set @xmath46=7.9 @xmath1 ( @xmath20=120  ) , the derived self - consistent hartree - fock subband spacing between the two lowest subbands is 5.4 @xmath1 at the zone center and 5.6 @xmath1 at the fermi level . </S>",
    "<S> the electron densities in the two occupied subbands are @xmath47=6.4@xmath43@xmath44 @xmath45 for the lowest subband ( labeled by @xmath48=0 ) , and @xmath49=4.0@xmath43@xmath44 @xmath45 for the second lowest subband ( labeled by @xmath48=1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the physical properties of the quantum wire are insensitive to its length , provided that the wire is sufficiently long . </S>",
    "<S> therefore , we set @xmath9=1.0 @xmath50 m . </S>",
    "<S> the experiment@xcite was done at a temperature 1.7 k , which is the temperature used in our calculation .    </S>",
    "<S> let @xmath51 and @xmath52 be , respectively , the fermi wave - vector and the fermi velocity of the @xmath48th subband . in the limit of long wavelength @xmath53@xmath540 , the transverse excitation is forbidden ( or allowed ) if the excitation energy is low ( or high ) , and so the corresponding physical processes are dominated by intrasubband ( or intersubband ) transitions . </S>",
    "<S> when @xmath53 increases to @xmath55-@xmath56 , the low energy intersubband transitions are activated . </S>",
    "<S> however , collective excitations with large energy and/or large @xmath53 are strongly damped . to illustrate the main features of long wavelength excitations , </S>",
    "<S> let us consider a very simply case by neglecting the electron self - energies and the vertex correction . </S>",
    "<S> in this case we obtain analytical results for both the sde and cde energies . </S>",
    "<S> the sde dispersion is linear in @xmath53 , with sound velocities @xmath57 and @xmath58 for intrasubband excitations in the two lowest subbands </S>",
    "<S> . with two subbands occupied , the cde dispersion has two branches . </S>",
    "<S> the in - phase mode is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the fourier transform of the coulomb potential @xmath61-@xmath62+@xmath63-@xmath64^{-1/2}$ ] , and the out - of - phase mode is @xmath65 such two - band sde and cde dispersions are exactly the same results as schulz@xcite obtained for a two - subband tomonaga - luttinger model ( tlm)@xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> when we turn on the intrasubband and intersubband exchange interaction , as well as the screening , the sde and cde energies will be modified from the above expressions , and have to be derived numerically . in the polarised spectrum , the higher energy region </S>",
    "<S> is dominated by strong intersubband cde . at @xmath53=0 , </S>",
    "<S> the calculated cde spectrum consists of a single peak which is characteristic to transverse parabolic confinement potentials@xcite . in the region of finite @xmath53 </S>",
    "<S> the intersubband hf spe energies show up at 5.5 @xmath1 . in the spin - flip </S>",
    "<S> depolarised raman spectrum , we obtained the red shift of intersubband sde with respect to hf spe . </S>",
    "<S> the sde has a dominant weight of the spectrum and appears at a resonance energy of 2.1 @xmath1 , which is shifted from the hf spe , indicating the importance of vertex correction . </S>",
    "<S> these overall features of our numerical results have been observed experimentally@xcite .    in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cdesde ] we show the calculated intrasubband sde and cde in the region of energy and frequency for which accurate experimental data are available . </S>",
    "<S> the mode with strong intensity is labeled as sde0 , and the next mode with weaker intensity is labeled as sde1 . </S>",
    "<S> the inset gives their dispersions , which are linear for small @xmath53 , with the corresponding sound velocities @xmath66=0.9@xmath57 and @xmath67=0.7@xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> these sound velocities are smaller than the respective fermi velocities because of the exchange screening of sde induced by the intersubband virtual transitions , and the renormalisation due to the intra- and intersubband exchange interaction . </S>",
    "<S> the experiments@xcite seem to have detected only @xmath66 , which corresponds to the high energy sde near the fermi wave vector @xmath55 of the lowest subband . </S>",
    "<S> it is probably the low electron density in the second lowest suband that causes the velocity @xmath67 of the sde around @xmath56 to be too small to be observed experimentally . </S>",
    "<S> the spin velocity @xmath66 agrees quantitatively with the experiment@xcite . for sufficiently large @xmath53 , because of the finite length of our quantum wire , the landau damping shows up in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cdesde ] in the form of enhanced intensities of satellite single - particle peaks around the sde , instead of a broad band if the quantum wire is infinitely long . </S>",
    "<S> the mode sde1 is not damped , since it does not enter the region of spes .    </S>",
    "<S> the dispersions of the cde and sde are also plotted in the inset in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cdesde ] . in the long wavelength limit </S>",
    "<S> , the in - phase cde+ can be well fitted with @xmath0^{-1/2}$ ] according to ( [ 2charge+ ] ) , as expected for 1d electron gas@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the out - of - phase cde- mode , corresponding to ( [ 2charge- ] ) with an expected linear dispersion@xcite , appears in our calculation as a weak band with a sound velocity @xmath68 . </S>",
    "<S> this happens to be the same as the sound velocity of the sde0 , an accidental result for this specific sample . </S>",
    "<S> the cde- mode has a much lower intensity compared to the cde+ mode . </S>",
    "<S> checking against the experiment@xcite , we believe the the lower energy band observed in the low frequency polarised raman spectrum is our calculated cde- mode . the decay of the plasmon ( cde+ ) and the cde- at higher @xmath53 due to the landau damping is stronger than the decay of sde0 and sde1 , as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ cdesde ] .    after the above complete study of a realistic quantum wire , perhaps it is worthwhile to mention some surprising findings for the special case that only the lowest subband occupied at zero temperature , namely , the pure 1d system including spin degrees of freedom . in this case we can drop the band index . for sde , the eigenvalue equation has the form @xmath69 where @xmath70=@xmath71 for the quasi-1d coulomb potential @xmath61-@xmath62+@xmath72^{-1/2}$ ] , which has a logarithmic singularity @xmath73 as @xmath53@xmath540 . since the hartree self - energy is canceled by the potential energy due to the positive background charges , the difference in exchange self - energy at the fermi energy , @xmath74=@xmath75+@xmath76-@xmath75-@xmath76 is @xmath77 $ ] . </S>",
    "<S> we define @xmath78 by @xmath79@xmath80@xmath81-@xmath82 , and at @xmath17=@xmath55 rewrite ( [ sdeone ] ) as @xmath83 \\nonumber \\\\ & & =    2\\pi\\left [ \\hbar\\omega -\\hbar qv_0 - \\delta_x(q)\\right ] y(k_0 ) \\ , . </S>",
    "<S> \\label{add1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the limit of long wavelength , by substituting @xmath84@xmath39@xmath85 and @xmath86@xmath39@xmath87 into the above equation , we see that the contributions of coulomb potential in the exchange energy and the vertex corrections , both behave as @xmath88 , exactly cancelling each other . </S>",
    "<S> hence , the @xmath88 behaviour of low - energy single - particle excitation due to the exchange self - energy is removed from the sde and the plasmon energies , and so only the exchange terms at momentum @xmath89 are important . an equation similar to ( [ add1 ] ) for @xmath90 at @xmath91 can also be derived . in the long wavelength limit </S>",
    "<S> , we find the sde energy @xmath92 where @xmath93=@xmath94 . </S>",
    "<S> the sound velocity is reduced with respect to the bare fermi velocity . </S>",
    "<S> we have also solved for the cde and found the plasmon dispersion @xmath95 for a long - range coulomb potential @xmath60@xmath96@xmath97 , the plasmon energy is not affected by the exchange interaction within the hf - rpa . </S>",
    "<S> these results ( [ 1spin ] ) and ( [ 1charge ] ) , derived with full coulomb interaction , differ from those obtained by schulz@xcite for the tlm including a nonsingular backscattering matrix element at @xmath89 , which mixes the right- and the left - traveling modes . nevertheless , in ( [ sdeone ] ) , if we replace the hartree - fock energy by the bare single - particle energy , and omit the singular part around v(q=0 ) in the vertex correction , then our results exactly reduce to schulz s results for the sde and the plasmon energies . </S>",
    "<S> whether this finding , as well as ( [ 2charge+ ] ) and ( [ 2charge- ] ) , is simply a coincidence remains to be clarified .    to close this letter , we should mention that according to our analysis , the frequency of the lowest energy sde decreases as @xmath53 increases towards @xmath56 , and then vanishes at a value of @xmath53 close to @xmath98 . </S>",
    "<S> this behaviour suggests a low temperature intrinsic instability of the electron gas against the formation of spin - density waves ( sdw ) , namely , the peierls instability . when this instability emerges from our mean - field analysis </S>",
    "<S> , we must take into account the sdw long - range order in the ground state . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , the results of the tlm with backscattering predict the absence of sdw long - range order , but instead the appearance of a slowly decaying wigner crystal at @xmath99@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we guess that the tlm with backscattering describes the real ground state better than hf - rpa . </S>",
    "<S> hence , we believe that our analysis based on a ground state without sdw long range order is a better approximation than that including sdw in the ground state .    </S>",
