    "when an alloy or a binary mixture in which both components are initially uniformly present undergoes rapid cooling below a critical temperature , both phases separate . in the absence of flow , domains of higher concentration in one or the other phase form and",
    "grow algebraically in time , obeying a coarsening process referred to as spinodal decomposition . in fluids , this phase separation is often more complex than in solid alloys because of the interaction between hydrodynamic and coarsening effects  @xcite . even when the flow is externally driven , the situation is complicated . in the presence of shear flow  @xcite or of turbulence @xcite , the coarsening can even be arrested  @xcite .",
    "the aim of this communication is to apply the methodology of these previous works to passive shear - driven phase separation in two and three dimensions , with a view to using the parameters inherent in the shear - flow model as a way of regulating the phase separation .",
    "although current supercomputing platforms enable the simulation of such flows at high resolution in three dimensions  @xcite , it can be noticed that most studies to date on stirred binary mixtures have focused on the two - dimensional case  @xcite .",
    "therefore , a further aim of the present work is to study the effects of dimensionality on the outcome of the phase separation .",
    "the model is the cahn  hilliard ( ch ) equation coupled to an externally - prescribed velocity field : we first of all review this approach before presenting our results .",

    "thus , @xmath2 denotes a perfectly mixed state .",
    "it is assumed that the system is in the spinodal region of the thermodynamic phase space , where the well mixed state is energetically unfavourable .",
    "consequently , the free energy for the mixture can be modelled as @xmath3=\\int { \\mathrm{d}}^d x\\left[\\tfrac{1}{4}(c^2 - 1)^2+\\tfrac{1}{2}\\gamma|\\nabla c|^2\\right]$ ] , where the first term promotes demixing and the second term smooths out sharp gradients in transition zones between demixed regions ; also , @xmath4 is a positive constant , and @xmath5 is the dimension of the space",
    ". the twin constraints of mass conservation and energy minimization suggest a gradient - flow dynamics for the evolution of the concentration : @xmath6 $ ] , where @xmath7 denotes the functional derivative of the free energy and @xmath8 is the mobility function . in this work , a constant mobility is assumed , such that the basic evolution equation reads @xmath9 models with variable mobility abound  @xcite , but their characteristics are very similar to the constant - mobility case . owing to the simplicity of the latter",
    ", a constant mobility is preferred here .",
    "equation   is modified in the presence of an incompressible velocity field @xmath10 : @xmath11 the velocity can either be externally prescribed ( passive advection ) or can arise due to coupling between hydrodynamics and phase separation ( active advection , modelled using the coupled navier  stokes  cahn ",
    "hilliard equations  @xcite ) .",

    " , an initially - symmetric mixture will stay symmetric for all times : @xmath14 , for all @xmath15 .",
    "since symmetric mixtures exemplify the generic properties of phase separation coupled with flow  @xcite , this specialization results in only a little loss of generality .",
    "the dynamics of the unstirred eq .   admit a constant solution @xmath16 , with @xmath17 most relevant for symmetric mixtures ; linear stability analysis shows this solution to be unstable with respect to small - amplitude perturbations .",
    "this instability is intimately connected to coarsening : starting with the initial condition @xmath18}$ ] , local demixing acts at early times to produce small domains where @xmath1 .",
    "these domains grow larger over time ; more precisely , the characteristic size @xmath19 of the domains grows as @xmath20 ( _ lifshitz  slyozov law _ ) . in the presence of shear flow ,",
    "the coarsening is interrupted , leading to _ coarsening arrest _ at a particular length scale set by the flow  @xcite .",
    "certainly , study of the cahn  hilliard equation is a well - worn furrow , with much insight available on the analytical side  @xcite , on the theory of coarsening arrest  @xcite , the influence of externally - prescribed flow ( references above ) , and in the area of active mixtures  @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present paper therefore is to investigate some narrow gaps in the existing literature , in particular the effects of dimensionality on the phase separation under the external shear flow , as well as the effects of flow anisotropy on the outcome of the same .",

    "however , by this point , finite - size effects spoil the scaling laws , since @xmath167 are all comparable to half the box size . the initial phase of the evolution up to @xmath160 can be explained again with respect to equation  , which now reads @xmath168 from equation   it therefore follows that any mode @xmath169 will be favoured by the linearized dynamics , meaning that dominant growth of the domains in the @xmath46 and @xmath44-directions is equally likely .",
    "thus , the dynamical model constructed in the two - dimensional case for the short correlation times persists in the 3d case also , albeit that an extra degree of freedom pertains , such that domain alignment in the @xmath46- and @xmath44- directions is equally likely in 3d .",
    "summarizing , we have performed a unified and detailed analysis of the phase separation in the presence of chaotic shear flow , for different values of the diffusivity and of the correlation time , in two and three dimensions .",
    "it is shown that the correlation time of the random - phase sine flow ( itself a simple model of turbulence ) can be used to tune the outcome of phase separation : for long correlation times , large flow amplitudes and sufficiently small diffusivities not only is the phase separation arrested and a filamentary concentration field produced , but the concentration variance decays exponentially , reminiscent of advection - diffusion .",
    "flow time scales therefore play an important role , and not just flow amplitudes and lengthscales . in earlier studies ( _ e.g. _ ref .  ) , results were presented as a function of these latter parameters , but the simulations were carried out with a dynamical model of flow ( navier - stokes equations ) . as a consequence , the correlation times",
    "obeyed the dynamics and might also vary from one case to the other .",
    "our findings are robust to changes in the cahn number and the dimensionality .",
    "the onset of the diffusive regime ( itself characterized by a decay of the concentration variance ) is interpreted herein in terms of batchelor lengthscales , a theory shown to be self - consistent . in the hyperdiffusive regime ,",
    "the importance of dimensionality is illustrated by investigating the concentration pdf in the ultimate state of phase separation . turning to anisotropic flows",
    ", it is found that the correlation time and the diffusivity can again be used as switches , this time to tune the direction in which the binary - fluid domains align .",
    "it will be useful to investigate the universality of these results with respect to active cahn ",
    "hilliard fluids forced in a turbulent manner according to various protocols in two and three dimensions .",

    "the calculation of the typical wavenumber @xmath94 is described in detail .",
    "this is the wavenumber characterising the domain scale and is obtained from structure - function calculations as follows .",
    "the wavenumber @xmath94 is defined as @xmath170 here , @xmath171 denotes a spherically - averaged power spectrum",
    ". however , its exact form warrants some further discussion .",

    "@xmath12 , and @xmath171 reduces to the spherically - averaged power spectrum : @xmath181 in this instance , the computation of @xmath94 dramatically simplifies : @xmath182 for postprocessing of the numerical data , this matters : evaluation of the formula   involves only summation of array elements and fast - fourier transforms , while evaluation of the equivalent formula   involves spherical averaging , which when done naively , has operation count @xmath183 .",
