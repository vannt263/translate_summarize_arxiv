    "in conclusion , we have studied in depth the dynamics of local structures in the 1d cgle .",
    "we have presented strong evidence that the origin of the chaotic behavior in the 1d cgle lies in the self  disordering action of the holes , rather than in the scatter of the defect profiles . using this insight ,",
    "we have then developed a minimal lattice model for spatiotemporal chaos , which , despite its simplicity , reproduces the essential spatiotemporally chaotic phenomenology of the full cgle .",
    "how general are these results ?",
    "we conjecture that there are two crucial properties needed for hole ",
    "defect type chaos : propagating saddle  like coherent structures ( the holes ) and a `` conserved '' field ( the phase field ) . of course , the phase is not strictly conserved here due to the occurrence of defects , but @xmath108 is a conserved quantity .",
    "it is this conservation that is weakly broken in our grid model for defect rule ( a ) , but is preserved for defect rule ( b ) . only the latter is truly chaotic .",
    "the conservation is also the underlying reason why an evolving hole leaves an inhomogeneous and self  disordered trail behind .",
    "without such a conserved field , there is no reason for `` self  disordering '' to occur , and the holes then typically will exhibit a fixed lifetime , leading to sierpinsky gasket type patterns as is often the case in reaction ",
    "diffusion models @xcite .",
    "a related scenario appears to occur in the periodically forced cgle @xcite .",
    "conserved fields of the type described here may be expected more generally for systems undergoing a hopf bifurcation , and can therefore be expected to also occur in ginzburg ",
    "landau type equations including higher order terms , and also in experiments .",
    "we have argued in ref .",
    "@xcite , that saddle  type structures like the homoclons here , may be much more general .",
    "this leads us to believe that the type of dynamics described here is not an artefact of the pure cgle , but could be far more widespread .",
    "our work opens up the possibility for quantitative studies of hole ",
    "defect and homoclon dynamics , states which have recently been observed in various convection experiments @xcite .",
    "we hope that our simple picture will advance these experimental studies of space  time chaos into the quantitative realm .",
    "local dynamics of the type studied here , such as the dependence of lifetime on initial conditions @xcite , or measurements of quantities like the daughter hole lifetimes @xmath38 and @xmath39 should be accessible in experiment , thereby circumventing the difficulties normally associated with characterizing fully  developed chaotic states .",
    "finally , we mention another commonly observed type of spatiotemporal chaos occurring in systems when a periodic state undergoes a certain symmetry breaking bifurcation @xcite .",
    "mathematically , such systems may be described by a complex ginzburg  landau equation , coupled to a phase field .",
    "such models are sometimes referred to as @xmath109 models @xcite .",
    "theoretically , the role of holes and defects has not yet been studied in great detail for these systems , but the main ingredients for hole ",
    "defect chaos of the type described here appear to be present .",
    "we hope that our work will encourage further studies in this area .",
    "this equation is a simplified version of the quadratic evolution equation for the holes introduced in ref .",
    "this quadratic equation describes the finite time divergence of the local phase gradient extremum @xmath111 as a hole evolves towards a defect .",
    "however , even though @xmath111 diverges at a defect , its local integral does not .",
    "hence , the finite time divergence of the local phase gradient maximum @xmath111 that signals a defect , can be replaced by a cutoff @xmath67 for @xmath73 @xcite .",
