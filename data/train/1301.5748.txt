    "next we examine higher - order soliton evolution near the photonic crystal band edge .",
    "soliton propagation is determined by two length scales @xcite , the nonlinear length @xmath18 ) [ with the effective nonlinear parameter @xmath19 defined by @xmath20@xcite and @xmath21 as the pulse peak power ] and the dispersion length @xmath22 [ where @xmath23 , @xmath24 as the pulse width ( fwhm ) , here @xmath25=2.3 ps , and @xmath26 for hyperbolic secant pulses ] .",
    "the soliton number @xmath27 defines the conditions for soliton propagation .",
    "let us first consider the canonical case of gvd and spm only , i.e. neglecting higher - order effects .",
    "when @xmath28=1 in this simple case , the pulse propagates without dispersing as a fundamental soliton due to a precise balance of gvd and spm .",
    "when @xmath291 in the simple case , the higher - order solitary pulse evolves recurrently by first compressing , then splitting temporally before regaining its initial shape after a soliton period @xmath30 .",
    "in contrast to these simple dynamics , in our semiconductor media the soliton propagation dynamics are governed by a complex nonlinear regime involving an intrapulse non - adiabatic free - carrier plasma ( with absorptive and dispersive terms ) generated from three - photon absorption , giving rise to the composite temporal and spectral features in the 2d spectrograms of figure  [ fig : frogtraces ] .    to discern the roles of each of these effects , we model the pulse propagation with a nonlinear schrdinger equation ( nlse ) @xcite that captures the underlying perturbed bloch lattice with an envelope function , including dispersive slow light , free - carrier dynamics ( density @xmath31 ) , three - photon absorption , and higher - order effects .",
    "the full model employed here ( detailed in the methods ) contrasts with the simple integrable nlse which neglects losses , gain , and any higher - order dispersion .",
    "importantly , free - electrons exhibit distinct ionization and loss dynamics in the two plasma ( multiphoton versus tunneling ) regimes . here in the multiphoton regime",

    "the high - sensitivity frog captures the exact pulse shape and phase of the input pulses , which subsequently serves as the initial launch pulse conditions into the nlse .",
    "the resulting nlse predicted intensity ( dashed red ) and solitary phase ( dash - dot black ) are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : frogtraces](f)-(h ) .",
    "since frog only gives the relative time , we temporally offset the frog traces to overlap the nlse for direct comparison . with all parameters precisely determined from experimental measurements ,",
    "e.g. with no free parameters , we observe a strong agreement between the femtojoule - resolution measurements and the nlse model across the diverse array of pulse energies and center frequencies .",

    "as we increase the pulse energy , the center of the pulse , defined by the first - order moment , forward shifts from 0 ps to -1.4 ps , indicating for the first time that the 19.4 pj ( 8.3 w ) pulse accelerates as it travels along the slow - light photonic crystal",
    ". the black dashed line indicates simulations with suppressed free - carrier effects ( @xmath31 = 0 ) at 19.4 pj ( 8.3 w ) . the pulse center shifts noticeably less in this case , with a difference of 0.68 ps , confirming the origin of the soliton acceleration and its accompanying blue - shift is free - carrier plasma .",
    "[ fig : pulsetimeshift](b ) shows the modeled pulse intensity and generated carrier population along the waveguide , with these frequencies near the band edge .",
    "[ fig : pulsetimeshift](b ) indeed indicates the self - induced blue - shift  or a self - induced frequency - chirp  is strongest near the input of the photonic crystal and at the location of largest pulse compression , correlating with the locations of highest powers and therefore generated free - electrons .",
    "these effects clearly arise from the non - adiabatic generation of a carrier plasma within the soliton itself .",
    "we additionally confirmed that third - order dispersion is negligible ( not pictured here ) in this regime by comparing it on and off in the model , indicating the acceleration is due completely to the generated plasma .",
    "the suppressed third - order - dispersion model further indicates the residual temporal shift is due to a small initial chirp in the pulses .",
    "this is in stark contrast with above - band - gap carrier - injection derived from adiabatic processes that shift the bands themselves ( see supplementary information ) @xcite .",
    "next we tune the soliton frequencies further away from the band edge , with an example 1533.5 nm case ( @xmath7 = 5.4 , @xmath8=  -0.49 ps@xmath10/mm ) shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : pulsetimeshift](c ) .",
    "though the input pulses are nearly identical , the pulse evolution is distinct due to a reduced dispersion and faster group velocity , and therefore weaker nonlinear and free - carrier plasma effects , compared to the 1546 nm case .",

    "[ fig : pulsetimeshift](c ) indicates a minimum duration of 440 fs ( @xmath33 , 330 fs shorter than the 1546 nm ( @xmath28 = 2.4 ) case due to the larger injected soliton number ( @xmath28=3.5 ) for optimal compression at this dispersion and sample length .",
    "the 1533.5 nm pulse also experiences less acceleration due to smaller self - induced frequency - chirp and free - carrier effects , as illustrated in fig .",

    "figure [ fig : carriereffects](a ) shows the experimentally captured frog trace at 14.8 pj ( 6.3 w ) alongside nlse modeling of the pulse propagation , including auxiliary free - electron non - instantaneous dynamics .",
    "the higher - order ultrafast soliton evolves by first compressing to a minimum duration , then splitting temporally , with the accelerated pulse induced by the multiphoton plasma .",
    "[ fig : carriereffects](b ) shows the measured temporal trace in comparison with the nlse simulations at the waveguide output , with remarkable agreement between experiment and theory .    based on the high - fidelity of our model ,",
    "we next consider numerically the case of a sample with twice the length @xmath34 , such that @xmath35 .",
    "given the input soliton number of @xmath28=3.2 , we expect the pulse to have nearly reformed since the simulated sample length @xmath36 mm is greater than the soliton period @xmath37 mm @xcite .",
    "[ fig : carriereffects](c ) , however , clearly demonstrates irreversible blue - shifting of the pulse energy , thereby breaking the symmetry of the optical pulse periodic evolution such that soliton recurrence is not possible in the presence of a plasma .",
    "the dominant loss mechanism at large peak powers is three - photon absorption , with a much smaller contribution from free - carrier absorption .",
    "further to this point , in fig .",
    "[ fig : carriereffects](d ) we illustrate the pulses with suppressed free - carrier effects ( @xmath31=0 ) while retaining three - photon absorption and an ideal hyperbolic secant input .",
    "these figures exhibit recovery of the pulse symmetry without temporal shifts , illustrating the sizable contribution of the multiphoton plasma to the nonlinear dynamics .",
    "though the temporal shape is symmetric , the higher - order periodic evolution is suppressed in this case due to three - photon absorption lowering soliton number @xmath38 . indeed here three - photon absorption is the ultimate limit to loss in the multiphoton regime , in contrast to carrier generation dominating in the tunneling regime .",
    "the strong contrast of panel ( d ) with the other panels demonstrates the suppression of periodic recurrence in the presence of free - carrier dynamics .",
    "we note that materials with large two - photon absorption such as silicon can not exhibit these dynamics at similar wavelengths and across the full range of pulse energies .      in soliton pulse compression schemes , it is important to consider the point of optimal temporal narrowing , @xmath39 .",
    "[ fig : minimumduration](a ) highlights the ratio of optimal length @xmath39 to soliton period @xmath40 versus soliton number @xmath28 in gainp computed via nlse .",
    "the results include the slow - light modified kerr , three - photon and free - carriers , and can be cast by the following fitted relation : @xmath41 in the experimental case of 1546 nm maximum compression was achieved at @xmath42 , corresponding to @xmath43 0.37 .",
    "this yields an estimate of @xmath39 of 1.37 mm , in solid agreement with the effective sample length of @xmath44 of 1.35 mm at this wavelength . to discern the role of the nonlinear effects @xmath45 and",
    "@xmath46 in the compression dynamics , we investigate a 50% larger @xmath46 ( same base @xmath45 ) and @xmath45 ( same base @xmath46 ) , indicated by the lines above and below the experimental case , respectively . as shown , a larger effective @xmath45 ( @xmath46 ) causes the @xmath47 vs. @xmath28 curve to move downwards ( upwards ) , e.g. decreasing ( increasing ) the length scale of compression , and indicating that desired compression effects can be achieved at lower ( higher ) intensities .",
    "thus different effective nonlinearities will have different scalings due to enhanced or suppressed compression dynamics .",
    "for soliton compression in semiconductor media it is clearly important to consider the balance between kerr and nonlinear absorption .",
    "we next carried out measurements to determine the minimum pulse duration for twelve different wavelengths , mapping the dispersion conditions across a broad range of slow group velocity regions .",
