    "coherent structures are very effective in transporting momentum across velocity gradients and thus contribute significantly to frictional drag in turbulent flows .",
    "depending on the type of flow and the position of the layer being studied , different kinds of structures can be identified ( robinson , 1991 ; panton 2001 ) . in wall bounded shear flows , robinson ( 1991 ) describes a dominance of streamwise vortices close to the walls and horseshoe - like structures in the outer region .",
    "for the intermediate region one might imagine a gradual transition in relative weight from one to the other . in transitional internal flows at low to intermediate reynolds numbers",
    "streamwise vortices and streaks are also present ( eggels _ et al .",
    "_ 1994 ; hof _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ; grossmann 2000 ) , and a complete self - regenerating cycle for the dynamics , in which vortices drive streaks which then generate vortices through a shear instability , has been proposed ( waleffe 1997 ) .",
    "the relation between internal and wall - bounded flow situations has been established through simulations in laterally confined geometries which show a similar dynamical behaviour ( hamilton _ et al .",
    "_ 1995 ) . the presence of vortices and streaks in flows with homogeneous shear ( kida & tanaka 1994 ; schumacher & eckhardt 2001 ) and calculations within rapid distortion theory ( nazarenko et al 2000 ) highlight the significance of the background shear for their evolution and dynamics .",
    "streamwise streaks result from the mixing of fluid across the shear gradient as induced , for instance , by streamwise vortices .",
    "this is a linear process that suggests a causal relation between their appearance : the vortices have to be there first , and can then be followed by the streaks . with the pointwise measurements in boundary layers in mind , we take velocity components as indicators for the structures : the streamwise turbulent velocity component @xmath0 for the streaks and the wall - normal or shear component @xmath1 for the vortices .",
    "the temporal correlation can then be verified for linear models of the vortex - streak interaction by direct calculation ( eckhardt & pandit 2003 ) . in particular , the model shows that the temporal cross - correlation function @xmath2 will be asymmetric , and it will have its extremum at a finite time - delay @xmath3 .",
    "the vortex as measured by @xmath1 has a chance to influence the streak in @xmath0 for @xmath4 , but not for @xmath5 .",
    "the question we address here is the extent to which this causal relation is reflected in an appropriate temporal correlation function in fully developed turbulent flows .",
    "the correlations we are interested in can be obtained from two - point data , from measurements displaced in space or time or both .",
    "apparently , the first such data were obtained by blackwelder & kovasznay ( 1972 ) in a turbulent boundary layer .",
    "their correlations for @xmath6 is defined as the distance between the wall and the height @xmath7 where @xmath8 with the free - stream velocity @xmath9 . ]",
    "show a weak asymmetry of under @xmath10 .",
    "later , blackwelder & eckelmann ( 1978 ) , studied cross - correlations between normal derivatives of the velocity components , and confirmed the asymmetry , as well as a shift in the maximum towards a positive time shift .",
    "lagrangian studies of this cross - correlation along particle paths also show this asymmetry ( pope 2002 ) .",
    "fully turbulent dynamics differs from the linear model with stochastic forcing by the presence of nonlinearities and a self - consistent generation of the turbulent fluctuations .",
    "in addition , the self - sustaining cycle proposed by waleffe ( 1997 ) for the complete dynamics consists not only of the non - normal amplification but also of a linear instability that generates normal vortices which are then tilted into the streamwise direction by the main flow .",
    "the asymmetry is a property of the first part of the cycle , but not of the second .",
    "the correlation function of the full cycle will thus be a superposition of the contributions from the both parts , and the asymmetry will show up if the statistical weight of the second part is smaller than that of the first part .    with this in mind , we want to turn to the analysis of the cross - correlation functions of the turbulent velocity components for evidence of the dynamical processes underlying the self - sustaining mechanism for the formation of coherent structures .",
    "we will study in detail data from a low - dimensional model , from direct numerical simulations ( dns ) of shear flows and from measurements with hot - wire probes in a boundary layer .",
    "the model allows for a detailed tracking of the dynamics of the various contributions to the spatial and temporal correlations .",
    "the dns allows for an extension to two - point cross - correlations in space and time since they do not have to rely on taylor s frozen flow hypothesis . finally , the experimental data , although restricted to time asymmetry , allow for much higher reynolds numbers and for a systematic study of the dependence of the correlation functions on the distance from the wall .",
    "we take coordinates with @xmath11 in streamwise , @xmath7 in wall - normal and @xmath12 in spanwise directions .",
    "the quantity we focus on is the correlation function between the normal velocity component @xmath1 and the streamwise component @xmath0 , displaced in the streamwise direction by @xmath13 and in time by @xmath3 , @xmath14 the averages are over time and also over all points in an @xmath11-@xmath12-plane at fixed height @xmath7 ( in the model and the dns ) .",
    "time correlations at one point are given by @xmath15 in order to quantify the asymmetry effects we introduce the following measure for the temporal cross - correlations @xmath16 ( the dependence on height is suppressed in these expressions ) .",
    "for the extended correlations due to the non - normal amplification we expect @xmath17 such that @xmath18 for these cases .",
    "the outline is as follows . in the next section , the low - dimensional model of a turbulent shear flow by moehlis _",
    "( 2004 , 2005 ) is discussed .",
    "section 3 describes the analysis of the dns in a nearly homogeneous shear flow followed in section 4 by the discussion of boundary layer experiments of knobloch & fernholz ( 2004 ) .",
    "finally , a summary and an outlook are given .",
    "the linear model of eckhardt & pandit ( 2003 ) can be extended to a nine - dimensional representation of shear flows , as discussed in more detail in moehlis _",
    "the system is confined between two free - slip planes and driven by a volume force that sustains a laminar sinusoidal flow profile .",
    "the model captures the non - normal amplification process and completes it with modes for transversal shear and instabilities of the streamwise streaks . with @xmath19 ,",
    "the aspect ratio is @xmath20 , and we simulate the flow at a reynolds number @xmath21 , where the reference value for the velocity @xmath22 is determined from the sustained laminar velocity profile at @xmath23 with @xmath24 being the distance between the free - slip planes .    with the galerkin modes @xmath25 and the amplitudes @xmath26 we can write the turbulent velocity field as @xmath27 the spatial part of the cross - correlations can be calculated analytically from the prescribed modes @xmath25 .",
    "the temporal part follows from the numerical solution of a system of ordinary differential equations for the @xmath26 that results with ( [ galerkin ] ) from the navier - stokes equations .",
    "equation ( [ cuv1 ] ) then becomes @xmath28 of the 45 possible pairs of modes that could contribute to the correlation function only four terms , involving five modes , do .",
    "the modes that contribute are : @xmath29 , a streamwise streak with no streamwise variations ; @xmath30 , a streamwise vortex ; @xmath31 and @xmath32 , which describe two different wall - normal vortices ; and @xmath33 , a mode that depends on all three coordinates .",
    "thus @xmath34 where the superscripts indicate the particular mode couplings . of these correlators",
    ", @xmath35 is exactly the one that probes the relation between streamwise vortices and streaks and therefore should have a significant variation with respect to @xmath3 .",
    "this is indeed the case , as fig .",
    "[ 9modeseparate ] shows .    when all contributions are collected , the space - time contours for @xmath36 at @xmath37 are obtained ( fig .",
    "[ vspec ] ) .",
    "the time correlations at a fixed position correspond to a cut along @xmath38 ( cf .",
    "1b ) and the space correlations for fixed time from a cut at @xmath39 .",
    "the time correlation function is negative , as is to be expected for a flow where the streamwise velocity increases in the positive @xmath7-direction .",
    "it is asymmetric and the asymmetry gives a positive @xmath40 in the center of the layer . because of the small number of modes in the system a more detailed dynamical system study is possible .",
    "an analysis of the periodic orbits in moehlis _",
    "( 2005 ) shows that some of them clearly follow the vortex - streak - instability sequence , but several do not",
    ". nevertheless , the correlation functions in fig .",
    "[ vspec ] show that the temporal asymmetry expected from the non - normal amplification process persists even after taking time averages .",
    "besides this similarity , there are differences to the linear model .",
    "the contour levels ( fig .",
    "1a ) show a global minimum that is shifted from the origin toward @xmath41 for this particular height .",
    "the shift in time stems from the streak - vortex coupling contributions @xmath35 and @xmath42 , and is compatible with the stochastic model ( eckhardt & pandit 2003 ) .",
    "the one in position can be traced back to the coupling of mode 8 with itself , @xmath43 for @xmath44 .",
    "the space - time contours are elongated along an axis whose slope has dimensions of velocity .",
    "this velocity is not the mean velocity at the height of the measurement . as we will show below",
    ", this is due to an asymmetry in the width of the structures in the normal direction .",
    "the direct numerical simulations of a turbulent shear flow also refer to a flow bounded by two parallel free - slip plates , driven by a volume force that sustains a linear shear flow in the mean , @xmath45 , except for a small boundary layer near the plates .",
    "details of the numerical simulations are given in schumacher & eckhardt ( 2000 ) and schumacher ( 2004 ) .",
    "relevant parameters for the simulation are listed in table 1 .",
    ".parameters of the two dns that were taken for the analysis .",
    "@xmath46 is the mean streamwise velocity at the free - slip boundary .",
    "the mean energy dissipation rate is given by @xmath47 , as in the experimental determinations .",
    "@xmath48 is the constant shear rate .",
    "the root mean square velocity is given by @xmath49 , the dimensionless shear parameter is @xmath50 and the taylor microscale reynolds number @xmath51 .",
    "the spectral resolution criterion @xmath52 is satisfied with @xmath53 . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab2 ]",
    "a comparison between the three sets of data shows that the vortex - streak interaction is reflected most strongly in the cross - correlation function closest to the wall or to bounding surfaces .",
    "further away the signal gets weaker , as expected by the change in structures ( robinson 1991 ) .",
    "the similarity of the asymmetry measure further out suggests the prevalence of a similar dynamics .",
    "interestingly , the asymmetry measures are similar when the height is measured in units of boundary layer thickness , rather than viscous length scales .",
    "it will be interesting to see how horsehoe vortices and their dynamics are reflected in correlation functions , and whether they can explain the cross - correlation functions or whether other dynamical processes have to be identified .",
