    "the presence and nature of accelerated particles in solar flares are deduced primarily from secondary impulsive radiations . because of the short thermalization and radiative timescales in the lower solar atmosphere , low - energy impulsive emissions from the dense chromosphere to photosphere can be thermal as well .",
    "gradual emission components are presumably thermal and early in the flare are strongly linked to the chromospheric evaporation .",
    "the electron acceleration timescale is much shorter than that for the chromospheric evaporation @xcite , and it appears that the two processes are decoupled",
    ". however , electron acceleration appears to be an inevitable component of the flare energy release @xcite , which itself is multi - scale as evident from the rich temporal , spatial , and energetic characteristics of flares , and electron acceleration in flares can be very efficient .",
    "solar flares are caused by energy release on macroscopic scales , and the amount of nonthermal electrons inferred from observations can be a significant fraction of the background electrons @xcite .",
    "energetic electrons in flares therefore are mostly accelerated from the background plasma , and the acceleration should depend in part on the background properties @xcite .",
    "one therefore may probe this dependence with observations over a relatively long timescale , when the properties of the background plasma have changed significantly .",
    "this is especially true for flares dominated by single loops @xcite , where the modification of the background plasma through chromospheric evaporation is expected to affect the characteristics of nonthermal radiations .    in the context of stochastic particle acceleration by turbulent electromagnetic fields , low - energy particles mostly couple with each other through coulomb collisions . in the high - energy range",
    "the energy gain of particles through interactions with the turbulent fields dominates over the energy loss through coulomb collisions with lower energy particles and radiation @xcite . a power - law high - energy particle distribution forms as this energy gain competes with the particle escape from the acceleration region through spatial diffusion with the power - law spectral index determined by the acceleration and escape rates .",
    "the particle distribution in the acceleration region generally has a thermal form at low energies and a high - energy power - law tail with the transition from the thermal to nonthermal component located at the energy @xmath0 , where the particle energy gain rate is comparable to the energy loss rate . over the past few decades",
    ", it has been demonstrated that this mechanism is compatible with many flare observations @xcite . however , there are very few testable predictions from detailed modeling .",
    "the same is true for other particle acceleration mechanisms @xcite .    given the important roles that turbulent electromagnetic fields play in the energy release processes of solar flares , in a previous paper we pointed out that direct modeling of the dynamics of turbulence may advance our studies of flares and lead to testable predictions @xcite .",
    "in the simplest scenario , where the turbulence is generated in a closed loop with a characteristic intensity and length scale  an elementary energy release event  the emission characteristics of the flaring loop are relatively well determined .",
    "we showed that these elementary energy release events might explain the soft - hard - soft spectral evolution of hard x - ray ( hxr ) pulses observed frequently both in chromospheric and coronal sources @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we have a summary of the elementary energy release events ( section [ events ] ) and quantify the chromospheric evaporation and x - ray emissions driven by this energy release ( section [ model ] ) .",
    "the model predicts faster rise and decay of hxr fluxes with a plateau near the turbulence peak for higher values of the ratio of @xmath0 to the thermal energy at this peak .",
    "the correlation between the nonthermal hxr flux and spectral index also depends on the temperature and/or density of the background electrons ( section [ results ] ) .",
    "this simple model does not quantitatively address the plasma heating and many important transport processes in flaring loops .",
    "we show , however , that it is possible to use rhessi observations to test the essence of the model and quantify the energy release , particle acceleration , and evaporation processes ( section [ dis ] ) .",
    "conclusions are drawn in section [ con ] .",
    "elementary flare bursts were noticed in early spectral observations of hxr flares , where these bursts are well correlated among all available energy channels @xcite .",
    "later high - resolution observations reveal soft - hard - soft spectral evolution , which @xcite attribute to elementary acceleration events .",
    "although the duration and peak flux may vary significantly from burst to burst , these events can be readily identified by the soft - hard - soft behavior .",
    "theoretically we called them elementary energy release events .",
    "the model for the elementary energy release event and stochastic acceleration of electrons is described in @xcite . for the sake of completeness",
    ", we summarize the key results here .",
    "the energy release is characterized with a turbulence generation length scale @xmath1 and turbulence energy density @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the background magnetic field and @xmath4 is a dimensionless parameter characterizing the fraction of magnetic energy dissipated during the event . considering the energy equipartition between the turbulence kinetic and magnetic energies ,",
    "the eddy speed at @xmath1 is given by @xmath5 , where @xmath6 is the alfvn speed and @xmath7 is the background mass density .",
    "the characteristic timescale is then given by @xmath8 .",
    "detailed analysis of correlation between hxr flux and spectral index reveals complicated quantitative results @xcite .",
    "the shapes of these bursts also show significant variations @xcite .",
    "these variations can be caused by changes in properties of the background plasma as the energy release triggers responses in coronal and chromospheric plasmas .",
    "the topology of magnetic fields may introduce additional features .",
    "we focus on flares associated with single loops so that particle acceleration , plasma heating , and chromospheric evaporation are the dominant physical processes in the impulsive phase .    in the 1d model for turbulence cascade and stochastic particle acceleration by @xcite ,",
    "the particle acceleration and plasma heating start almost instantaneously upon the arrival of turbulence at certain small scales , where background particles resonate effectively with turbulent plasma waves .",
    "applying such a model to elementary energy events would imply almost universal rise profile of hxr bursts .",
    "there is little observational evidence for such a universal hxr rise profile , and the turbulence cascade and particle acceleration are truly 2d processes , which are highly nonlinear , complicated , and not well understood @xcite .",
    "here we use @xmath9 with @xmath10 to characterize the effective intensity of turbulent magnetic fields in resonance with background particles and assume that @xmath11 where the ` dot ' indicates a derivative with respect to time @xmath12 and the kraichnan phenomenology has been used to obtain the turbulence decay time @xmath13 @xcite . both the kinetic and magnetic energy density of this turbulence is given by @xmath14 . the energy dissipation rate",

    "can then be parameterized , respectively , with @xmath20 where @xmath21 , @xmath22 is the electron speed , and @xmath23 and @xmath24 are two dimensionless coefficients characterizing the acceleration and scattering of electrons by the turbulent fields .",

    "this equation is slightly different from that in @xcite . considering that the escape time can not be shorter than the mean transit time @xmath27",
    ", we include the second term on the right - hand side .",
    "this term is important only in the limit of weak scattering when the scattering time @xmath28 is much longer than @xmath29 @xcite . in a more accurate treatment",
    ", one also needs to consider the reduction of the scattering time by coulomb collisions @xcite .",
    "the trapping of electrons by magnetic loops converging at both footpoints will also increase the escape time @xcite . in the regime , where scattering by turbulence dominates , the effects of coulomb scattering , the transit - time term , and magnetic trapping may be negligible and one obtains the expression in @xcite .",
    "in general , the electron distribution function at a given time @xmath12 depends on both the electron momentum and spatial location . for isotropic distributions ,",
    "the spatially integrated electron distribution in the acceleration region only depends on the electron kinetic energy @xmath30 : @xmath31 , where @xmath32 is the total number of free electrons in the acceleration region , @xmath33 is the average electron density , and @xmath34 is the cross section of the flaring loop .",
    "we first ignore the structure of the flaring loop and assume that the evolution timescale of the distribution function is much shorter than @xmath35",

    "features from the duration of the observed hxrs down to the time resolution of the instrument can be readily identified @xcite . even for the relatively simple early impulsive flares with the hxrs dominated by a few distinct bursts @xcite , finer structures with a timescale much shorter than the duration of individual bursts",
