    "tremendous progress has been made during the last years in the understanding of multiple scattering of waves in disordered media in so - called mesoscopic regime.@xcite this regime is commonly defined by @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the wavelength , @xmath2 is the mean free path , @xmath3 is the sample size ( or source - detector separation in the case of infinite medium ) , and @xmath4 is the absorption length . in particular ,",
    "considerable attention has been paid to the study of the correlation function of intensity fluctuations@xcite @xmath5 where @xmath6 is the intensity of the wave field @xmath7 , @xmath8 , angular brackets @xmath9 denote ensemble averaging , and the random fields @xmath7 , @xmath10 are assumed to be stationary . in the present paper , we are mainly interested in the correlation of intensities in two distant points separated by a distance superior to the mean free path : @xmath11 .",
    "several contributions to @xmath12 can be identified.@xcite short - range ( in both space and time ) correlations arise from interference between the waves arriving at the points @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "weak long - range correlations are due to the interaction of diffusing modes in the medium .",
    "finally , tiny infinite - range correlations manifest themselves in the phenomenon of universal conductance fluctuations,@xcite and have been recently observed for optical waves.@xcite the listed contributions to the correlation function are commonly denoted by @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 , respectively .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the magnitudes of these correlations scale with some dimensionless parameter and are not sensitive to the short - distance properties of disorder provided that @xmath18 . for the case of plane wave transmission through a slab , such a parameter is the dimensionless conductance @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the number of transport channels , @xmath21 is the wavenumber , and @xmath22 is the area of the slab surface . for @xmath23 , which is a typical experimental situation , one finds@xcite @xmath24 , @xmath25 , @xmath26 . for a medium of infinite extent , the relevant parameter is the product @xmath27 : @xmath24 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , where @xmath30 is assumed . in all cases ,",
    "the only medium - specific quantity determining the magnitude of the correlation is the mean free path @xmath2 , and thus we call the @xmath15 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 correlations _",
    "universal _ as they are independent of the particular features of disorder , and only depend on the global parameter @xmath2 .",
    "recently , a new contribution to the intensity correlation in random media ( @xmath31 ) has been conjectured.@xcite this contribution originates from the scattering of wave near its source . in the case of a point source",
    "embedded in an infinite three - dimensional medium with fluctuations of the dielectric constant obeying white - noise gaussian statistics , for @xmath11 and @xmath32 , it has been found@xcite @xmath33 the physical process giving rise to the @xmath31 correlation consists in the scattering of the wave in the immediate neighborhood of its source ( more precisely , at a distance of order @xmath1 from the source ) , which produces a secondary wave propagating to the distant points @xmath13 and @xmath14 by diffusion .",
    "it turns out that the secondary waves created in such a way are correlated , and hence the described physical process establishes correlation between intensities at different points of the medium .",
    "it is important to emphasize that this correlation has an infinite spatial range .",
    "a fundamental difference between @xmath31 and other types of correlation is that @xmath31 should be sensitive to the short - distance details of disorder ( e.g. , to its correlation length).@xcite moreover , as this contribution to the correlation function is due to the scattering in the vicinity of the source , one could expect that @xmath31 should depend on the geometrical parameters of the source and , in particular , on its size . finally , for moving scatterers and @xmath34 , @xmath31 should also be sensitive to the dynamics of disordered medium in the immediate neighborhood of the source .",
    "it follows then that the @xmath31 contribution to the correlation function is _ non - universal .",
    "_    in the present paper , we show that the @xmath31 correlation function does exhibit a strongly _ non - universal _ behavior .",

    "finally , we compute the space - time intensity correlation function @xmath42 .",

    "to get such an insight , we introduce @xmath102 as new variables of integration in eq .",
    "( [ ff ] ) .",

    "( [ ff4 ] ) and fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , the @xmath31 correlation decreases with increase of the disorder correlation length @xmath35 , and the characteristic scale of this decrease is set by @xmath1 .",
    "this is physically clear as @xmath31 originates from scattering at a distance of order @xmath1 from the source , which is only possible if the wave `` identifies '' its environment as disordered already after a distance of order @xmath1 . such an identification implies that @xmath52 changes significantly at the scale of @xmath1 , or , in other words , that the correlation length of the fluctuations of @xmath52 is shorter than @xmath1 .",
    "on the basis of this reasoning , we expect that @xmath31 should vanish for @xmath110 , while for @xmath111 the behavior of @xmath31 may be sensitive to a particular model of disorder . in contrast , the linear initial decay ( [ ff4 ] ) of the @xmath31 correlation function with the disorder correlation length @xmath35 seems to be rather general and independent of the model of disorder .",
    "we have verified that the linear law ( [ ff4 ] ) holds ( with an apparent change of numerical factors ) not only for the gaussian covariance of @xmath52 [ eq .

    ".    an essential result of our analysis is that the @xmath31 correlation function appears to be sensitive to the correlation length @xmath35 of the dielectric function fluctuations , which is a _ short - distance _ parameter of disorder .",
    "we remind that all the previously studied types of correlation ( @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) are not sensitive to such details of the scattering medium , and only depend on the mean free path @xmath2 .",
    "we conclude then that the sensitivity to the short - distance properties of disordered medium is a distinctive feature of the @xmath31 correlation function . measurements of @xmath31 could thus provide unambiguous information on the disorder correlation length .",
    "it is rather surprising that such information is not lost as a result of multiple scattering , as one would expect , but determines the long - range spatial _ correlation _ in the multiple - scattering speckle pattern .",
    "another important outcome of the presented consideration is that the correlation length @xmath35 entering into eq .",
    "( [ c01 ] ) is that characteristic for the disorder in the immediate neighborhood of the source ( more precisely , at a distance of order @xmath1 from it ) .",

    "when @xmath126 becomes larger than unity , @xmath124 decreases as @xmath127 .",
    "this indicates that although the small size of the source is important for the magnitude of the @xmath31 correlation , the correlation process leading to @xmath31 survives even for extended ( @xmath72 ) sources .",
