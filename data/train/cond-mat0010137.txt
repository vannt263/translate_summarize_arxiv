    "several condensed matter systems undergo phase transitions which are triggered by vortex - like defects .",
    "for instance , this is the case of superfluid helium , superconductors and the melting transition . in particular",
    ", the discovery of high - temperature superconductors has boosted the interest in the behavior of vortex lines in the mixed state and opened a new area which regards the physics of vortices as a new state of matter @xcite .",
    "the ginzburg - landau ( g - l ) model involving a complex field @xmath7 configurations ) is that amplitude fluctuations can be neglected and that the only relevant degree of freedom is the phase angle @xmath8 .",
    "the  phase only \" approximation is equivalent to consider the limit in which the quartic coefficient of the g - l hamiltonian @xmath9 which freezes the amplitude or equivalently to take the coherence length @xmath10 . on the lattice this is the well known xy model .",
    "thanks to the work of berezinskii @xcite and kosterlitz and thouless @xcite in the early 70 s we have a fair understanding of the xy model in two dimensions .",
    "it turns out that a topological phase transition , the so called kosterlitz - thouless ( kt ) transition , takes place driven by the unbinding of vortex - antivortex pairs at a temperature @xmath11 .",
    "a crucial ingredient of the kt transition is the logarithmic interaction between vortices .",
    "for that reason in ref .",
    "@xcite the authors concluded that in a charged superfluid , due to screening , vortices will always unbind at nonzero temperature .",
    "latter on , it was realized that vortices in sufficiently thin superconducting films indeed interact logarithmically @xcite-@xcite and it was pointed out that the kt phase transition might also apply to thin - film superconductors .",
    "the 2 dimensional flux line lattice ( fll ) melting transition was also regarded as based on a kt - type theory @xcite .",
    "more recently , it was suggested that some features of the kt theory might be present in under - doped superconducting cuprates @xcite .",
    "however , the nature of the phase transition triggered by vortices in 2d systems still remains under discussion . by means of monte carlo simulations of the xy model with a modified nearest neighbor interaction",
    "it was shown that , depending on the value of an additional parameter , continuous as well first - order transitions take place @xcite-@xcite .",
    "the existence of both kinds of phase transitions is in accordance with the richer structure of the 2d coulomb gas found by minnhagen and wallin @xcite using self - consistent renormalization group equations and with the tendency towards first - order transition which develops in the case of a strong disorder coupling constant @xcite .",
    "the 2d fll also still remains controversial theoretically as well as experimentally .",
    "experimental works and numerical simulations favor a kt - like transition in some cases and a discontinuous one in others @xcite .",
    "a recent extensive monte carlo simulation found a first order transition at a temperature close to the estimated one assuming a kt melting transition @xcite .",
    "as bormann and beck @xcite pointed out , at @xmath12 the amplitude fluctuations may affect the critical behavior and can not be neglected .",
    "therefore , instead of the xy model -with fixed amplitude fields- it is worth investigating the effects of vortices when amplitude fluctuations are taken into account .",
    "depending on the chosen parameterization , amplitude fluctuations are controlled by the quartic coefficient @xmath13 of the g - l hamiltonian or by the coherence length @xmath0 .",
    "hence , in this work we simulate the ginzburg - landau model ( with an amplitude and a phase degree of freedom per point ) on a lattice of spacing @xmath1 and obtain its two - dimensional phase diagram in the plane ( @xmath14 ) .",
    "we will see that the nature of the phase transition of the g - l model diverges dramatically from the kt when the parameter @xmath13 is chosen sufficiently small -which in fact is equivalent to take the coherence length @xmath15- and that this is connected with the appearance of a discontinuous jump in the number of vortices .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we define the lattice model , the observables to be computed as well as describe the used monte carlo procedure . in section iii",

    "it is better to introduce a dimensionless order parameter : @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is conventionally used because @xmath28 approaches this value infinitely deep in the interior of the superconductor .",

    "hard spins _ with fixed amplitude .",
    "a more interesting and less well studied limit is just the opposite i.e. @xmath35 ( by ( [ eq : connec ] ) small values of the @xmath13 parameter ) which corresponds to large amplitude fluctuations .",
    "we have simulated the hamiltonian ( [ eq : h2 ] ) using a metropolis monte carlo standard algorithm .",
    "the calculations were performed using periodic boundary conditions ( pbc ) . in order to increase the speed of the simulation we have discretized the @xmath36 global symmetry group to a @xmath37 and compared the results with previous runs carried out with the full o(2 ) group in relatively small lattices . for the case of @xmath38",
    "we found no appreciable differences .",
