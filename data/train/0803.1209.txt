    "superconducting circuits have gained increased interest in recent years , particularly for their possible use in quantum information processing and as artificial atoms @xcite . in relation to the artificial - atom concept ,",
    "the idea of placing such an atom in contact with a harmonic - oscillator circuit element , which serves as a cavity , has attracted a great deal of attention @xcite .",
    "such circuit - qed systems hold promise for studying various quantum - optics phenomena in a highly controllable and easily tunable setting , as well as exploring parameter regimes that are inaccessible using natural atoms .",
    "one of the most intriguing and counterintuitive phenomena in the fields of atomic physics and quantum optics is lasing @xcite .",
    "given the above - mentioned advantages of superconducting circuits for studying atomic - physics and quantum - optics phenomena , it is natural to investigate superconducting implementations of lasing .",
    "indeed , there have been a number of recent theoretical proposals @xcite and experimental demonstrations of lasing @xcite and population inversion @xcite in superconducting systems .    in ref .",

    "it should be mentioned here that similar models have been studied in the past in the study of single - atom lasing ( see e.g.  refs .",

    "the transition - rate - based calculation derives in a transparent manner the lasing suppression condition and the state of the cavity deep in the lasing and the suppressed - lasing regimes .",
    "the semiclassical calculation provides a good approximation for the state of the cavity throughout the lasing state , but is not suited to analyze the suppressed - lasing regime , where it turns out that the state of the cavity takes the form of a thermal state . for clarity , we start by analyzing a simplified two - level - atom model , and we later take the same approach to analyze a three - level - atom model that describes more accurately the experiment of ref .  @xcite . in particular",

    "the system is shown schematically in fig .  1 .",
    "the hamiltonian of the combined atom - cavity system is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the atom s characteristic frequency , @xmath4 is the cavity s natural frequency , @xmath5 is the atom - cavity coupling strength , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the usual pauli matrices operating on the atomic state , and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are , respectively , the annihilation and creation operators acting on the state of the cavity .",
    "we shall describe quantum states using the notation @xmath10 , where @xmath11 for the atomic ground state and @xmath12 for the excited state , and @xmath13 represents the number of photons in the cavity .    in order to have efficient emission of photons from the atom into the cavity , the",
    "atom and cavity frequencies must be almost equal . for the remainder of this paper",
    ", we shall take @xmath14 .",
    "we also take this frequency to be the largest frequency ( or energy ) scale in the problem .",
    "the setup is designed such that the atom s bias conditions cause it to ` relax ' from the ground state to the excited state , with rate @xmath0 @xcite . in this section",
    ", the inverted relaxation is assumed as part of the theoretical model under consideration ; a similar process will be derived from first principles in a realistic three - level - atom model in sec .",
    "it is this counter - intuitive , inverted relaxation that will provide the mechanism for population inversion , which plays a crucial role in the realization of the lasing state . as such",
    ", one can say that the ( usual ) threshold condition for lasing action is automatically satisfied in this model .",
    "note that we are ignoring any weak relaxation process pushing the atom from the excited to the ground state , since such a process would not affect the main points we wish to study .",
    "furthermore , since the atom s relaxation rate will be taken to be very large , we shall ignore any additional atomic dephasing mechanisms .",
    "the cavity is taken to possess a decay rate @xmath1 .",
    "an alternative description of the above situation concerning the bias conditions would be to say that the cavity is in contact with a heat bath that has a very small and positive temperature , while the atom is in contact with a heat bath that has a very small and negative temperature .",
    "it is worth mentioning here that a similar approach ( with negative effective bath temperature ) was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to describe an amplification process .",
    "in order to determine the state of the cavity for a given set of parameters , we first note that the above model contains a mechanism for photon emission into the cavity and a mechanism for photon loss from the cavity .",
    "we consider these two mechanisms separately .",
    "the loss rate of photons from the cavity ( i.e.  the transition rate from the state @xmath15 to the state @xmath16 , where @xmath17 represents the state of the atom ) is given simply by the decay rate @xmath1 multiplied by the number of photons in the cavity @xmath18 : @xmath19    obtaining the photon emission rate requires a somewhat more careful analysis .",
    "we first consider the situation where there are no or few photons in the cavity .",
    "the atom s bias conditions constantly push it to its excited state .",
    "we can therefore assume the atom to be initially in the excited state .",
    "if the atom is in its excited state and the cavity has @xmath20 photons , the atom - cavity coupling ( with matrix element @xmath21 ) induces dynamics between the states @xmath22 and @xmath23 . since @xmath24",
    ", the dynamics will take the form of an incoherent process described by the transition rate @xmath25 .",
    "any population that starts to accumulate in the state @xmath23 will quickly relax to the state @xmath26 , because the atom is constantly pushed in this direction by its surrounding environment .",
    "these two steps complete the transition from the state @xmath22 to the state @xmath26 , or in other words , the process of adding one photon to the cavity .",
    "since the upward - relaxation process occurs at a very large rate , it can be treated as being instantaneous .",
    "we therefore find that the photon emission rate ( i.e.  the transition rate from the state @xmath16 to the state @xmath15 ) is given by the rate of the @xmath27 transition , i.e. @xmath28 the photon emission rate therefore increases linearly with @xmath18 for small values of @xmath18 @xcite .",
    "clearly this situation can not persist for large @xmath18 , since this mechanism is ultimately limited by the atom s relaxation rate @xmath0 .",
    "indeed , when @xmath21 becomes comparable to or larger than @xmath0 , the @xmath29 transitions must be treated as coherent oscillations .",
    "one can now argue that in the limit of very large @xmath18 , where the system spends half of the time in each one of the two states ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 ) , the atom has a chance to incoherently relax from its ground state into its excited state only half of the time . in this case",
    "the photon emission rate asymptotically reaches the value @xmath30 , which it can not exceed .",
    "the main advantage of the above derivation of the photon emission rate is its simplicity , as well as the simplicity of the resulting expressions .",
    "a more detailed analysis of the photon emission rate for any value of @xmath18 is possible , assuming that cavity is in a coherent ( i.e.  lasing ) state .",
    "this calculation will be carried out in sec .",
    "ii.d below ( see also @xcite ) .      combing the photon emission and loss rates as functions of photon number @xmath18",
    ", one can obtain the probability distribution of photon number states in the cavity .",
    "in particular , if this probability distribution has a peak for some value of @xmath18 , the peak value can be obtained by locating the intersection point between the emission and loss rates .",
    "some relevant examples of such a peak - finding calculation are depicted schematically in fig .  2 .     ( green solid line ) and",
    "the photon loss rate @xmath31 ( blue dashed line ) as functions of the photon number in the cavity @xmath18 . the intersection point ( red circle )",
    "determines the value of @xmath18 in the photon - number probability distribution with the highest probability .",
    "going from ( a ) to ( d ) , @xmath0 is increased , while @xmath1 is kept fixed.,width=340 ]    we treat the atom s relaxation rate @xmath0 as the tunable parameter , keeping @xmath5 and @xmath1 fixed . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : emissionrate ] ) one can see that small values of @xmath0 correspond to a large initial slope of the emission rate ( at @xmath32 ) , even though the emission rate reaches the saturation level for a relatively small value of @xmath18 .",
    "figure 2(a ) represents this situation . if we increase @xmath0 , the initial slope of the emission rate decreases , but it eventually reaches a larger value . by comparing figs .",
    "2(a ) and 2(b ) , one can see that the peak value of the photon number in the cavity increases with increasing pumping rate .",
    "this result agrees with intuitive expectations .",
    "a change of behaviour occurs when @xmath0 reaches a certain regime , an expression for which will be given shortly . as can be seen from fig .",
    "2(c ) , the peak value of @xmath18 starts decreasing with increasing @xmath0 and vanishes at a certain value of @xmath0 .",
    "beyond this point the value of @xmath18 with maximum occupation probability remains at zero .",
    "this suppression of lasing action by strong pumping is quite counterintuitive .",
    "it can be understood in terms of the quantum zeno effect ; at a certain point , the decoherence associated with pumping becomes the most dominant effect and inhibits the emission of photons from the atom into the cavity @xcite . in the following",
    "we shall analyze this effect , as well as the state of the cavity in the different regimes , more quantitatively .    by combining eqs .",
    "( [ eq : lossrate ] ) and ( [ eq : emissionrate ] ) , we find that if @xmath33 the photon emission rate is larger than the photon loss rate , assuming a small photon number in the cavity .",
    "starting with a small photon number , the number increases exponentially in time [ the growth in photon number continues until the peak value of @xmath18 is reached , as represented by the circles in figs .",
    "2(a , b ) ] .",
    "if , on the other hand , eq .  ( [ eq : lasingcondition ] ) is not satisfied , the loss rate will be higher than the emission rate , and lasing would not occur .",
    "equation ( [ eq : lasingcondition ] ) can therefore be considered a second threshold condition for lasing in this setup .",
    "note that population inversion is guaranteed in this model and that all emission from the atom goes into the cavity .",
    "we now consider the situation where the lasing condition ( eq .  [ eq : lasingcondition ] ) is satisfied , and we analyze the probability distribution of the photon number in the cavity .",
    "deep in the lasing regime , we can assume that the emission rate is well approximated by @xmath30 .",
    "the loss rate is still given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : lossrate ] ) .",
    "the peak in the photon - number probability distribution therefore occurs at @xmath34 note that this steady - state photon number is independent of the atom - cavity coupling strength .",
    "it is also worth mentioning that this relation remains valid even if @xmath0 is smaller than @xmath5 .",
    "the width of the probability distribution can be calculated as follows .",
    "the ` probability current ' from the @xmath35-photon state to the @xmath18-photon state is given by @xmath36 whereas the probability current in the opposite direction is given by @xmath37 here @xmath38 is the probability of having @xmath18 photons in the cavity . using the detailed balance equation , i.e.  @xmath39",
    ", the above two equations can be combined to give @xmath40 which can be integrated to give the probability distribution @xmath41 the width of the probability distribution is therefore of the order of @xmath42 , as would be expected for the lasing state .",
    "we now turn to the situation where lasing is suppressed , i.e.  when @xmath43 . in the linear regime ( i.e.  when @xmath18 is small ) , we can write simple detailed balance equations for the probabilities @xmath38 ;",
    "@xmath44 this equation can be identified as the detailed - balance equation for a cavity in thermal equilibrium at effective temperature @xmath45^{-1}.\\ ] ] note that here we are neglecting the small ambient temperature of the cavity . using the bose - distribution formula , we find that the average number of photons at the above effective temperature is given by @xmath46 therefore , if we start from large values of @xmath0 and we gradually decrease it , the average number of photons in the cavity starts increasing .",
    "this number follows a @xmath47-type function that diverges at the threshold condition .",
    "the nonlinearity in the emission rate [ see fig .  2(c ) ] prevents the photon number from diverging at the critical value of @xmath0 ; instead the system changes behaviour and enters the lasing regime .      in this subsection",

    "it predicts that deep in the lasing regime , i.e.  when the second term inside the parentheses can be neglected , the number of photons will be given by @xmath58 .",

    "the inset in the top - right corner of the figure shows a truncated model of a three - level atom where relaxation processes take the atom from the ground state ( @xmath74 ) to an inert state ( @xmath75 ) and then to the excited state ( @xmath76).,width=377 ]    a schematic diagram of the photon emission mechanism is shown in fig .  5 , including the dissipative processes .",
    "the state with @xmath69 cooper pairs in the box can relax to the state with @xmath77 cooper pairs and an unpaired electron in the box and an electron added to the drain electrode ( this transition occurs with rate @xmath78 ) .",
    "this state can relax further when the unpaired electron tunnels from the box into the drain electrode ( with rate @xmath79 ) .",
    "once the box has @xmath77 cooper pairs and no unpaired electrons , its coupling to the source electrode allows a new cooper pair to tunnel from the source electrode to the box .",

    "the unpaired electron can tunnel from the box to the drain electrode and the atom relaxes to its excited state @xmath76 , thus completing the relaxation process .",
    "the fact that the states of the source and drain electrodes change during the relaxation processes , which is needed in order to ensure that energy is always lowered in each step of the relaxation process , does not need to be explicitly taken into account once we have established the mechanism for the inverted relaxation process in the cooper - pair box .",
