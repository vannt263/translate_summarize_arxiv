    "models with warped extra dimensions  @xcite are excellent candidates for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "they solve the hierarchy problem , provide a rationale for the observed flavor structure , and can potentially give striking signatures at the lhc .",
    "besides , they are weakly coupled duals of strongly coupled four - dimensional ( conformal ) theories and can therefore provide an intuition and quantitative predictions for models of strong electroweak symmetry breaking ( ewsb ) .",
    "models based on a purely ads@xmath6 background and a minimal field content are strongly constrained by electroweak precision tests ( ewpt ) .",
    "in particular , large contributions to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath1 parameter  @xcite can easily push the scale of new physics beyond the reach of the lhc  @xcite .",
    "the large top mass requires the third generation @xmath7 quark doublet ( as well as the top singlet ) to be relatively close to the infrared ( ir ) brane .",
    "when the light generations are localized near the ultraviolet ( uv ) brane , this can lead to large corrections to the @xmath0 coupling , which also impose important restrictions .",
    "a common solution invokes a custodial symmetry  @xcite , and a benchmark model of anarchic warped extra dimensions was proposed in ref .",
    "@xcite ( see  @xcite for alternatives ) . in that model ,",
    "the @xmath8 parameter together with the one - loop fermion contributions to @xmath1 and the @xmath9 coupling  @xcite , which are calculable in such models imposes the strongest constraint : the new vector bosons should be heavier than @xmath10 tev .",
    "the couplings of the quarks to these kaluza - klein ( kk ) vector bosons in the previous benchmark model were taken to be @xmath11 where @xmath12 represents any of the light standard model ( sm ) fermions and @xmath13 represents a typical sm couplings .",
    "the conclusion of lhc reach studies is that the gauge kk resonances are difficult to see at the lhc , mainly due to their large width and reduced production cross section , the latter resulting from the small coupling to valence quarks  @xcite .",
    "luckily , this benchmark model comes with another characteristic signature : light vector - like fermions ( fermion custodians )  @xcite , that are much easier to see at the lhc  @xcite ( see @xcite for an overview ) .",
    "it has been recently suggested  @xcite that a departure from pure ads@xmath6 near the infrared brane can substantially decrease the @xmath1 parameter ( and , although by a smaller amount , also the @xmath8 parameter , as was previously observed in  @xcite ) .",
    "the authors of  @xcite proposed a model in which the reduction of the @xmath1 and @xmath8 parameters is so effective that new vector bosons with masses below @xmath14 tev are compatible with the ewpt _ without the custodial symmetry_. the analysis in  @xcite assumes , however , that all fermions are localized on the uv brane .",
    "this is an excellent approximation for the light generations but not for the third one .",
    "we extend the previous study by incorporating bulk fermions and describing their effects on ewpt once the top and bottom masses are reproduced .",
    "this is important for a number of reasons : first , without the custodial symmetry the @xmath9 coupling is not protected  @xcite and can impose significant constraints on the model ; second , the loop - level contributions to the ew observables are expected to be strongly dependent on the localization of the third family of quarks , and can also impose significant constraints ; finally , the collider implications of the model depend crucially on the localization of the third generation quarks .",
    "nevertheless , we find that the signatures associated with the region of parameter space favored by the ew precision constraints are still characterized by eq .",

    "the outline of the paper is as follows .",
    "we introduce the model in section  [ model ] and discuss bulk fermions in section  [ fermions ]",

    "the model under consideration represents a departure from ads@xmath6 in the infrared .",
    "we simply summarize in this section the main results for the gravitational background and the bosonic field content , while referring the reader to  @xcite for full details .",
    "we will then introduce bulk fermions in the model and discuss their effects on the ewpt .",
    "the gravitational background is given by the metric @xmath16 with warp factor @xmath17 the extra dimension is bounded by two branes : the uv brane , localized at @xmath18 , and the ir brane , localized at @xmath19 .",
    "the warp factor would vanish at @xmath20 but we will always consider parameters such that this metric singularity remains hidden behind the ir brane ( @xmath21 ) .",
    "the gravitational parameters are therefore @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath20 and @xmath24 ( the curvature scale at the uv brane , of the order of the planck mass ) which is assumed to set the scale of all dimensionful 5d quantities .",
    "we will trade @xmath20 for the value of the curvature radius at the ir brane , given in units of @xmath24 by @xmath25 requiring perturbativity of the gravitational expansion bounds its value by @xmath26  @xcite .",
    "the position of the ir brane , @xmath23 , can be fixed by requiring the gravitational background to generate the @xmath27 hierarchy .",
    "we will simply set @xmath28 , which determines @xmath29 .",
    "the bosonic content of the model consists of the sm gauge fields , with neumann boundary conditions ( bc ) on both branes , and an electroweak scalar doublet , the higgs .",
    "other scalars involved in the gravitational background and the stabilization of the interbrane distance  @xcite are irrelevant for this discussion , although their phenomenology , in particular that of the radion , can be interesting .",

    "if flavor is explained by means of localization in the extra dimension , the effects of new physics in models with warped extra dimensions are almost universal and can therefore be encoded in the oblique parameters of  @xcite , with the most important exception being the couplings of the bottom quark .",

    "in fact , for the favored region of parameter space such couplings are well in the perturbative regime ( thus resembling more closely the case of flat rather than typical warped extra - dimensions ) . however , although higher - order contributions due to yukawa or weak gauge couplings can be expected to be further suppressed , there remains some uncertainty associated with higher order qcd contributions . as we will see in detail below ,",
    "one of the effects of the departure from ads@xmath6 of the gravitational background is to push the kk modes closer to the ir brane .",
    "this effect increases the coupling among kk modes , thus reducing the scale of strong coupling in the qcd sector .",

    "in addition , we find that the 1-loop corrections to the ew observables , which are finite in these scenarios , strongly restrict the allowed region of parameter space .",
    "in particular , a tension between the ( tree - level ) corrections to the @xmath0 coupling and the 1-loop contribution to the peskin - takeuchi @xmath1-parameter , strongly constrains the localization of the third generation quarks and the resulting 95% cl bound on the kk scale .",
    "nevertheless we find that for an optimal top / bottom @xmath7 doublet localization , and when the 5d bottom yukawa coupling is a factor of a _ few _ smaller than the top one , the kk - gluons can be as light as @xmath184 if the higgs is heavy , with the likelihood inferred from the ew fit still being reasonably large .",
    "however , if the higgs mass is allowed to float in the fit , one finds a 95% cl lower bound of @xmath166 ,    a kk - gluon mass of about @xmath184 can open the exciting possibility that the randall - sundrum solution to the hierarchy problem , based on warped compactifications , and with a bulk sm field content , could lead to observable resonances at the lhc with lower luminosities than previously thought .",
    "compared to the widely studied ads@xmath15 framework , the result arises from two opposing effects : the previously mentioned strong localization of the gauge boson resonances towards the ir brane implies a reduction of its couplings to the light fermions , thus leading to a suppression in production .",
    "this can be compensated by the lower allowed mass of the gauge kk modes .",
    "however , we find that discovering such a resonance in the dominant @xmath202 channel is likely to be challenging .",
    "boosted top techniques and a very detailed knowledge of the @xmath202 tail will likely be required to discover these modes .",
    "we also find that , unlike in the case of an ads@xmath15 background without the custodial symmetry , the present class of models allows for the production of single kk - fermion resonances of the sm fields , in kk - gluon decays .",

    "<S> we study the effect of bulk fermions on electroweak precision observables in a recently proposed model with warped extra dimensions and no custodial symmetry . we find that the top - quark mass , together with the corrections to the @xmath0 vertex and the one - loop contribution to the @xmath1 parameter , which is finite , impose important constraints that single out a well defined region of parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> new massive vector bosons can be as light as @xmath2 tev and have large couplings to the @xmath3 quark , and suppressed couplings to the @xmath4 , @xmath5 and lighter quarks . </S>",
