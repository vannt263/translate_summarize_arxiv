    "statistical characterization of dynamical systems , particularly weakly chaotic low - dimensional dissipative maps , have been made according to its sensitivity to the initial conditions , the rate of increase of the entropy , the rate of relaxation to the attractor , and the distribution of a statistical variable @xcite .",

    "weakly chaotic systems , that present zero _ largest lyapunov exponent _ ( lle )",

    "it has been observed that the nonextensive statistical mechanical framework is able to describe different features of various classes of complex systems @xcite , including the logistic map @xcite . if @xmath21 approaches zero , the sensitivity to the initial conditions and the rate of relaxation to the attractor follow @xmath5-exponential behaviors , the distributions follow a @xmath5-gaussian form , and the rate of increase of entropy demands @xmath22 entropy , instead of bg entropy .",
    "all these behaviors are parameterized by the indices @xmath9 , @xmath4 , @xmath15 , @xmath13 , for _ sensitivity _ , _ entropy production _ , _ relaxation _ , and _ stationary distribution _ , respectively .",
    "it has been observed ( and in some instances proved ) that , for low - dimensional systems , @xmath23 , through the @xmath5-generalized pesin equality @xcite .",
    "consequently , three ( possibly related ) quantities remain to be addressed , that are currently referred to as the @xmath5-triplet @xcite .",
    "the @xmath5-triplet has been experimentally observed in a variety of complex systems like in the ozone layer @xcite and in the voyager i data for the solar wind @xcite , among many others .",
    "relations are expected to connect @xmath4 , @xmath13 , and @xmath15 , ultimately completely determined by the nonlinear dynamics of the system .",
    "the possible relations between the @xmath5-triplet indices should in principle exhibit the fixed point @xmath24 ( bg statistics ) .",
    "at least for low - dimensional systems , if one of them equals unity , the others also equal unity .",
    "this typically happens whenever @xmath25 .",
    "in fact , lle plays a central role in the definition of which statistical framework is to be used in the description of nonlinear dynamical systems .    in the present work we address a low - dimensional conservative system , namely the standard map @xcite : @xmath26 ( @xmath27 and @xmath14",
    "are taken as modulo @xmath28 ) .",
    "its phase space can exhibit strongly chaotic regions , characterized by positive local lle @xmath21 , and weakly chaotic regions , with zero values of @xmath21 .",
    "the lle has been numerically evaluated through the benettin et al algorithm @xcite .",
    "it is calculated for each initial condition separately , as illustrated by fig .  2 of @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "the extent of the phase space for each case ( strongly or weakly chaotic ) is determined by the control parameter @xmath1 . for sufficiently small values of @xmath1 , for instance",
    "@xmath17 , the entire phase space is practically stable ( zero lle ) , and if @xmath1 takes high values ( @xmath2 ) , the points of the phase space have finite positive values of @xmath21 . in the present work ,",
    "we evaluate the values of @xmath9 , @xmath4 , and @xmath15 for both strongly and weakly chaotic cases .",
    "we also revisit the stationary distributions , particularly the mixed case ( strongly and weakly chaotic ) , that has been recently found for this system @xcite .",
    "finally , we have determined the relation of strongly and weakly chaotic @xmath13 indices , with respect to the stationary distributions of the map for arbitrary values of @xmath1 .",
    "the sensitivity to initial conditions is given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the temporal dependence of the discrepancy of two very close initial conditions at time @xmath31 .",
    "when ergodic behavior dominates over the whole phase space , eq .",
    "( [ eq : sensitiv ] ) is expressed by the exponential dependence , @xmath32 and @xmath21 is the standard maximum lyapunov exponent .",
    "strongly chaotic systems are those which present @xmath33 .",
    "they are strongly sensitive to initial conditions .",
    "insensitivity to initial conditions are described by @xmath34 .",
    "the marginal case @xmath35 is governed by a more subtle rule than eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi - exp ] ) @xcite : @xmath36 where @xmath37_+^{1/(1-q)}$ ] , @xmath38_+=\\max\\{u,0\\}$ ] , is the so called @xmath5exponential function @xcite , and @xmath39 is a generalized lyapunov exponent . if @xmath40 ( with @xmath41 ) the system is weakly chaotic , in the sense that @xmath42 diverges slower than the exponential ( strongly chaotic ) case ,",
    " asymptotically , a power law . if the system is strongly chaotic , @xmath43 , and eq .",
    "( [ eq : xi - q - exp ] ) recovers the standard exponential dependence , with @xmath44 .",
    "the correctness of this description can be checked , for both chaotic regimes of standard map , in figures [ fig : lnqzik10b ] and [ fig : lnqzik02 ] .",
    "they show , for different values of @xmath5 , the averages of @xmath45 ( where @xmath46 is the inverse function of the @xmath5-exponential , and @xmath47 ) over @xmath48 realizations .",
    "each realization starts with a randomly chosen pair of very close initial conditions , that are localized inside a particular cell of the @xmath8 equally partitioned phase space . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lnqzik10b ] , that corresponds to the case of strong chaos @xmath2 , where lle @xmath49 ) , we consider decreasing initial discrepancies in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sensitiv ] ) so as to obtain a well defined behavior for increasingly long times . in all cases ( strongly and weakly chaotic chaos ) , after a transient , we verify a nontrivial property @xcite namely that exists a special value of @xmath5 , noted @xmath50 ( where av stands for _ average _ ) , which yields a linear dependence of @xmath51 with time .",
    "in other words , we verify @xmath52 .    for the strongly chaotic case , exponential sensitivity to the initial conditions",
    "is verified with @xmath53 , and the same generalized lyapunov exponent characterizes the whole phase space no mater the value of @xmath8 or the particular cell to be chosen .",
    "[ fig : lnqzik10a ] exemplifies this fact , as it shows that the slope of the temporal evolution of the averaged sensitivity to initial conditions is preserved over an intermediate regime where correlation coefficient equals one and @xmath54 ( time steps)@xmath55 , in accordance with @xcite .",
    "consequently , generalized lyapunov exponent does not depend on the spreading occupation index @xcite of averaging cells , and it makes sense choosing the random pairs of initial conditions to compute the @xmath48 realizations all over the phase space , i.e. @xmath56 .    for the weakly chaotic case , stability islands dominate the phase space .",
    "consequently , the characterization of the spreading occupation index of cells is much more intricate . in this case , a `` global characterization '' of the map has tentatively been made @xcite . but fig .",
    "[ fig : occolk02w400 ] ( @xmath17 , where lle = @xmath57 ) demonstrates that a common transient time can not be defined , and this fact tends to preclude a neat linear dependence of @xmath51 with time .",
    "we now do not choose the @xmath48 random pairs of initial conditions all over the phase space , but in particular cells , i.e. , in local regions .",
    "nevertheless , we identify regions that exhibit @xmath58 , whose value of @xmath59 depend on the initial cell , as shown in figure [ fig : lnqzik02 ] .",
    "in fact , a huge set of randomly chosen cells exhibit analogous results of @xmath58 , but we have also found cells where linear behavior is satisfied for @xmath60 ( fig .  [",
    "fig : lnqzik02qneg ] ) .",
    "with respect to the entropy production per unit time , we may conveniently use the @xmath5-entropy ( @xmath61 , henceforth ) @xcite    @xmath62    the @xmath5-entropy production is estimated dividing the phase space in @xmath8 equal cells , and randomly choosing @xmath63 initial conditions inside one of the @xmath8 cells ( typically @xmath64 ) .",
    "we follow the spreading of points within the phase space , and calculate eq .",
    "( [ eq : qentropy ] ) from the set of occupancy probabilities @xmath65 ( @xmath66 ) .",
    "fluctuations are of course present , but they can be reduced when we choose @xmath67 initial cells within which the @xmath68 initial conditions are chosen , and average @xmath69 over the @xmath70 realizations .",
    "the proper value of the entropic parameter @xmath71 is the special value of @xmath5 which makes the averaged @xmath5-entropy production per unit time to be finite , which is ultimately related with the extensivity of the entropy .",
    "the @xmath5-entropy production per unit time is consequently obtained as @xmath72 and must be calculated taking into account that the partitions of phase space , @xmath73 and @xmath68 are such as to obtain robust results .    when the lle is largely positive and the phase space is dominated by a chaotic sea , the boltzmann - gibbs entropy ( @xmath74 ) is expected to be the appropriate one ( i.e. @xmath75 ) .",
    "our numerical results show , as expected , that the proper value of the entropic index is @xmath76 for @xmath2 ( see figure [ fig : s1k10 ] ) .",
    "both indexes have been obtained comparing the nonlinearity measure of the polynomial fitting curves over the intermediate regime ( after a transient and before saturation ) were the correlation coefficient is constant and equals @xmath77 .",
    "another interesting result that emerged is the coincidence of the slopes of the sensitivity and entropy functions of time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : lnqzik10a ] and fig .",
    "[ fig : s1k10 ] ) , i.e. , the @xmath5-entropy production per unit time satisfies @xmath78 .",
    "these results are numerically compatible with a @xmath5-generalization of a pesin - like identity for ensemble averages in strongly chaotic conservative maps , and reinforce those in @xcite .",
    "entropic characterization of weak chaos regime in _ conservative _ maps is much more subtle than in _ dissipative _ maps ( see @xcite ) .",
    "first , let us notice that one of the practical difficulties to identify the weak chaos regime are the huge computer times required , because of the slow convergence of the _ finite time larger lyapunov exponent _ to its @xmath79 limit value .",
    "furthermore , we know that the phase space of weakly chaotic conservative maps is dominated by stability islands and regions with a huge diversity of spreading occupation indexes , and this makes a hard task to reduce fluctuations by averaging the entropy .",
    "we have already pointed out that spreading occupation index of cells , and consequently their transient time scales , are essential in the @xmath5-sensitivity characterization of the map .",
    "[ fig : sq0fluctuations ] reveals the incidence of this phenomena on the entropy production , which is related to the sensibility to initial conditions , and we conclude that a smart averaging criterion must be adopted .",
    "initially we have tested the adequacy of the _ smaller alignment index _",
    "( sali ) @xcite to identify weak chaos in the @xmath17 standard map , so as to reduce the computer times required for lle computation .",
    "we observe that the sali temporal evolution is a computationally cheap tool to detect chaotic behavior of trajectories , as it tends to zero in both ordered and chaotic orbits , but with completely different time rates : sali decreases abruptly in strongly chaotic orbits and reaches the limit of accuracy of the computer after about 200 iterations and , in contrast , it decreases with time as a power law in ordered orbits .",
    "we have verified , for the first time to the best of our knowledge , that the sali decreases with time as a power law even in the case of weakly chaotic orbits .",
    "[ fig : salvslyap ] shows , for the standard map with @xmath17 , that the time required to characterize weak chaos of stability island is generically shorter if we study the sali temporal evolution instead of the lle @xmath79 limit computation .",
    "we then obtain the temporal production of the averaged entropy @xmath80 , selecting the @xmath73 cells between those that present analogous sali temporal evolution : the smoother the log - log sali evolution is , the smother its entropy production .",
    "this criterion provides averaged @xmath5-entropies , @xmath80 , that do not present the typical oscillations observed in conservative maps @xcite .",
    "[ fig : sqk02 ] exemplifies this fact .    summarizing , for weakly chaotic dissipative systems , particularly for the logistic map",
    ", it has been observed that there is a specific value of @xmath81 ( for the logistic map , @xmath82 @xcite ) which yields finite entropy production per unit time , and hence @xmath16 ( @xmath83 ) is the proper one to thermodynamically characterize the system .",
    "verification of this behavior for a conservative system ( the standard map ) is presently done .",
    "our numerical results show in both strongly and weakly chaotic regime , as expected , @xmath84 , and this points towards the conjecture of the generalized pesin equality @xcite . in particular , @xmath85 and @xmath86 for @xmath2 ( strong chaotic regime , as @xmath33 ) , and @xmath87 for @xmath17 ( weakly chaotic regime , as @xmath88 , @xmath89 ) .",
    "with respect to the weakly chaotic regime , a local characterization of generalized pesin - like remains to be made , as @xmath90 and @xmath59 have both shown to be local properties .",
    "the methods described in sections [ sec : q - sen ] and [ sec : q - ent ] take an ensemble of initial conditions inside one of @xmath8 cells of the phase space , and thus @xmath91 , @xmath92 . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the authors have considered an ensemble of initial conditions spread over the entire phase space of a dissipative system ( particularly , the logistic map ) , therefore , with the maximum possible value for the entropy @xmath93 .",
    "the time evolution brings the system to its attractor , and the number of occupied cells falls according to an exponential relation , in the case of a strongly chaotic system , or according to a @xmath5-exponential , in the case of a weakly chaotic system .",
    "later it was found a relation between @xmath15 and @xmath4 by analyzing the rate in which the entropy goes to its final value , beginning with @xmath94 , instead of @xmath93 @xcite .",
    "the method adopted in @xcite can not be identically applied to a conservative map , since there is no attractor , but that one introduced in @xcite can be adapted to area - preserving models .",
    "we consider the variable @xmath95 and evaluate its average over an ensemble of initial conditions for @xmath79 .",
    "the average must be computed with a different criterion in strong and weak chaos regimes , according to the respective stability distributions on the phase space .",
    "the strongly chaotic map is dominated all over the partitioned phase space by a chaotic sea , and we can analytically calculate @xmath96 . in that case , the average @xmath97 has been estimated over the most quickly spreading cells @xmath68 to minimize the time computation . on the contrary ,",
    "the stability islands dominate the phase space in the weakly chaotic regime , and their respective value of @xmath98 is unknown , as it numerically depends on the cells where the initial conditions are randomly chosen .",
    "we must find a proper criterion for the numerical estimation of @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and we privilege those cells that cover a region were sali behaves in a smoothly manner , such as to produce entropy in a smoothly manner too .",
    "it is expected that @xmath101 , where @xmath102 is a relaxation time .",
    "figures [ fig : relax - k10 ] and [ fig : relax - k02 ] show the time dependence of @xmath103 for the strongly chaotic case ( @xmath2 ) , and the weakly chaotic case ( @xmath17 ) , respectively .",
    "the former case displays an exponential relaxation , i.e. , @xmath104 , consistently with bg framework .",
    "the weakly chaotic case presents a @xmath5-exponential relaxation regime , with @xmath105 for @xmath17 .",
    "probability density distributions are among the most relevant items regarding the statistical description of dynamical systems .",
    "gaussian distributions are typical for ergodic and mixing systems , for which lle is positive @xcite , and @xmath5-gaussian distributions are typical for weakly chaotic systems for which lle@xmath106 @xcite and or chaotic layers are thin and lle@xmath107 @xcite .",

    "the scenario for intermediate values of @xmath1 is also quite rich . for these cases",
    ", the phase space displays regions with points that have positive lle ,  the chaotic sea  , and regions with @xmath124, the stability islands .",
    "the probability distributions of @xmath122 for initial conditions taken inside the strongly chaotic regions are gaussians , and those distributions for initial conditions that belong to the weakly chaotic regions are @xmath5-gaussians .",
    "one remarkable feature is that @xmath125 in all cases , regardless the value of @xmath1 .",
    "if the initial conditions are spread over the entire phase space , thus the initial conditions are from both the chaotic sea and the stability islands , the distribution that emerges is a linear combination of a gaussian and a @xmath5-gaussian .",
    "consequently , the probability distribution of the standard map , for any arbitrary value of @xmath1 , can be modeled as    @xmath126    where @xmath127 and @xmath128 are the probability densities of @xmath122 for the initial conditions taken inside the weak and strong chaos regions , respectively .    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was taken the linear combination of the probability distributions normalized to the maximum value @xmath129 , and the physical meaning of the interpolating parameter was not clear .",
