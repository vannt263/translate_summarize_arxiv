    "this is a convex set , and its extreme elements are the pure states . when the system is in the ( normalized ) pure state  @xmath6 the @xmath1-particle density matrix is of the form @xmath7 ; then @xmath8 .",
    "given  @xmath4 , one refers to the integral operator with kernel @xmath9 as the reduced @xmath10-matrix , or simply as the @xmath10-matrix .",
    "we denote by the same letter a @xmath10-matrix and its kernel and employ the standard notation @xmath11 , and so on , for the spatial and spin variables . these reduced matrices are still positive operators with trace  1 , but now they form only a proper subset of  @xmath12 .",
    "the case @xmath13 is of special importance , since the energy of system takes the form @xmath14 this is an exact linear functional of  @xmath15 , and the ground - state energy would be obtained by minimizing it on the set of 2-matrices .",
    "therein lies the rub , as the @xmath1-representability problem for 2-matrices has never been efficiently solved  @xcite .",
    "this is why the hohenberg  kohn",
    " sham density functional theory ( dft ) program and its generalizations , initiated by the proof that the ground state density determines every property of an electronic system , still enjoy a tremendous success .",
    "this paper has the aim of sprucing up an untended corner of the garden of generalized density functional theories .",
    "the original dft program is beset by our foreordained ignorance of the exact energy functional , while the reduced density matrix approach is hobbled by the unsolvability of the @xmath1-representability problem for two - electron densities .-",
    "representability ; ayers reformulation of the latter  @xcite ; and other recent remarkable progress both on it and on pending questions of the representability problem for 1-matrices @xcite .",
    "we return to the ayers method in the next section . ]",
    "we push forward here the use of a quasidensity or quasiprobability on phase space , which is nothing other than the reduced single - body wigner function , whose relation to 1-electron space @xmath16 and momentum @xmath17 densities is immediate .    mathematically , wigner functions  @xcite are equivalent to density matrices ; and in this sense our approach , dubbed wigner density functional theory ( wdft ) , is equivalent to matrix functional theory .",
    "the beginnings of the latter go back to  @xcite ; a surge of interest ensued , followed by a period of relative quiescence .",
    "more recently , this approach has seen a vigorous recent development centered around the notion of natural orbitals .",
    "however , wdft can be worked out autonomously , calls for a different type of physical intuition , and readily lends itself to semi - classical treatments .",
    "like one - body density matrix functional theory , it sits midway between ordinary  dft and the coulson proposal of replacing the wave function by the 2-matrix  @xcite .",
    "it stands to contribute to ( and to gain from ) both the kohn and coulson programs .",
    "chief among our motivations is the success of the energetic program by gill and coworkers see for instance  @xcite to attack the problem of correlation energies via the family of wigner intracules .",
    "their method is rooted in the fundamental observation by rassolov  @xcite that relative momentum is as important as relative position in determining interelectronic correlation ; and this naturally calls for a phase space treatment .",
    "since we assume from the reader only basic familiarity with wigner quasiprobabilities , we do most things from scratch , starting from a proof of the rayleigh  ritz principle in phase space quantum mechanics .",
    "after this , we give the main theorems for energy functionals based on the single - body wigner function , in parallel with standard treatments .",
    "there we are brief , since arguments of this type have become routine .",
    "the harmonium `` atom '' is treated exhaustively after that .",
    "phase - space methods provide a fast lane towards an elegant and complete description of this system ; it also serves as a training ground for employing the formalism .",
    "true atomic wigner functions are considered next .",
    "phase - space eigenfunctions which are not quasidensities are needed for that .",
    "we characterize them for gaussian basis wave functions ; this result seems to be new .",
    "we perform some numerical atomic computations with those eigenfunctions .",
    "afterwards we ( precisely define and ) study _ natural wigner orbitals_. this is the heart of our subject .",
    "they come in handy to give a simpler proof than that of  @xcite of the `` overbinding '' property of the mller 1-density matrix functional for helium . again turning to harmonium",
    ", we illustrate with them the workings of exact functionals . the shull ",
    "kutzelnigg series is analytically summed here , for the first time as far as we know .    in an appendix",
    ", we place the thomas  fermi ( tf ) models within our framework .",
    "the purpose is mainly pedagogical , illustrating how they fit harmoniously within wdft .",
    "another appendix elaborates on the characterization problem for wigner functions .",
    "the fundamental ideas of the present endeavour are found already in  @xcite ; they appeared more developed in  @xcite .",
    "wodarz came upon the same idea by the mid - nineties  @xcite .",
    "but apparently his paper had an almost negligible impact .",
    "it is perhaps prudent to clarify that our approach is not quite in the same spirit as the ( then recent ) work on a phase space distribution corresponding to a given electronic density  @xmath18 , reported in the texts  @xcite .",
    "this had been conjured by ghosh , berkowitz and parr  @xcite by means of heuristic `` local thermodynamics '' arguments .",
    "the gbp ansatz was put to good use  @xcite in the calculation of compton profiles , exchange energies and corrections to the thomas  fermi  dirac energy functional .",
    "since the gbp distribution can not be a true wigner quasiprobability , its success should partially be attributed to the intrinsic strength of the phase space formalism",
    ".    there might be an issue of the use of wigner quasiprobabilities versus other correspondences between ordinary quantum mechanics and @xmath19-numbers on phase space .",
    "let it be said that , in the context of our quest , the mathematical advantages of wigner functions are overwhelming",
    ". it would be difficult to develop natural orbital theory on phase space without the tracial property  @xcite underlying ( uniquely ) the wigner ",
    "moyal correspondence , that allows for an almost verbatim translation of the spectral resolution for quantum states .",
    "also the metaplectic invariance of this correspondence apparently is essential for the reconstruction of the 2-body wigner function from the 1-body wigner function for harmonium in section  [ sec : harm - foretold ] .",
    "it lies behind generalized wigner functions produced by fractional fourier transforms  @xcite , as well .",
    "last , but in no way least : this article seeks to continue and pay homage to outstanding work of many years by dahl and springborg ( see  @xcite and references given later ) on atomic and molecular wigner functions , by addressing several matters of principle .",
    "the wigner quasiprobability corresponding to a density matrix @xmath4 is given by @xmath20 this is symmetric under particle exchange .",
    "the definition extends to transitions @xmath21 , @xmath22 we can regard wigner quasiprobabilities as @xmath23 matrices on spin space . when there is no risk of confusion the corresponding spinless quantity , obtained by tracing on the spin variables , is denoted by the same name",
    ". then hermiticity of  @xmath4 in   translates into reality of  @xmath24 .",
    "the unit trace property translates into the normalization condition @xmath25 also , wigner functions are square - summable and bounded continuous . by interpolation , @xmath26 for all @xmath27 .",
    "notice that the above integral at any point of phase space is the expected value of a grossmann ",
    "royer parity observable @xcite ; those are stratonovich  weyl ( de)quantizers on kirillov coadjoint orbits @xcite . since a parity operator can not have expectation value greater than  1 , we note that @xmath28 with negative values being possible .",
    "this bound can not be reached in more than one point , and in view of   it is often remarked that the support of a wigner function is of bigger volume than @xmath29 . as a matter of fact , no square - summable wigner function can have compact support in all of its variables , since then both the corresponding wavefunction and its fourier transform would have compact support , which is impossible .",
    "the distinctive trait of the phase space formulation is that expected values are calculated as phase space averages .",
    "hence the classical observables reenter the quantum - mechanical game .",
    "let @xmath30 be a real function of  @xmath31 ( a _ symbol _ ) and let @xmath32 be its quantized operator version ( by the weyl rule ) .",
    "we work with symbols symmetric in their arguments .",
    "then we get : @xmath33 one must keep in mind that the symbol for the operator @xmath4 is _ not _  @xmath24 , but @xmath34 .",
    "that is , @xmath35 .",
    "a wigner quasiprobability behaves in almost every way like a probability density on phase space , except that in general is not nonnegative everywhere .",
    "it is not so easy , however , to recognize quantum state representatives among all functions on phase space : see appendix  [ app : through - a - glass - darkly ]",
    ".      reduced wigner quasiprobabilities , up to and including the single - particle quasidensity  @xmath36 on phase space , are obtained in the obvious way by integrating successively over groups of 6  variables .",
    "in particular : @xmath37 by partial integration of  @xmath36 one gets the 1-electron density  @xmath18 and momentum density  @xmath38 : @xmath39 also the form factors are easily expressed in terms of  @xmath40 . since dequantization and reduction commute",
    ", we may also use formulas analogous to   for reduced density matrices . at each order",
    "the reduced wigner distributions contain the same information as the corresponding reduced density matrices .",
    "it is convenient to have `` inversion formulas '' to recover the latter matrices from the wigner functions .",
    "it transpires that @xmath41 where @xmath42 and @xmath43 as usually defined in quantum chemistry .",

    "one may usefully translate coleman s theorems  @xcite on representable 1-density matrices into properties of  @xmath36 .",
    "this was done by harriman  @xcite .",
    "let @xmath48 denote the set of 1-matrices representable by  ; it happens that @xmath49 .",
    "in fact , @xmath36 is the 1-body wigner quasidensity corresponding to an element of  @xmath48 if and only if @xmath50 for any @xmath51 which is the symbol of an arbitrary element of  @xmath52 .",
    "recall that @xmath36 may be regarded as a @xmath53 matrix in spin space .",
    "we can write for instance , @xmath54 and @xmath55 in   means the trace of @xmath56 or its scalar part , in a more cogent specification of  @xmath36 according to the behaviour of its components under rotation .",
    "analogously @xmath44 may be regarded as a @xmath57 matrix in spin space or as a direct sum of higher tensor representations of the rotation group .",
    "the ayers trick see  @xcite for instance is easily reformulated here : the 1-body wigner quasidensity belongs to @xmath48 if and only if @xmath58\\ ] ] for every 1-body potential @xmath59 , where @xmath60 $ ] denotes the ground state energy of @xmath1 fermions under such potential ; likewise the 2-body wigner quasidensity @xmath44 is @xmath1-representable if and only if @xmath61\\ ] ] for any 2-body hamiltonian @xmath62 .",
    "the `` only if '' part is clear , for otherwise the variational principle would be violated .",
    "the `` if '' part requires the hahn  banach theorem .",
    "the quasidensity corresponding to a slater determinant ( that is , an extremal element of  @xmath48 ) is the sum with equal weight 1 of the contributions of the occupied orbitals  @xcite : @xmath63 with the @xmath64 being ( mutually orthogonal ) pure - state wigner functions .",
    "note , as well , that in this case @xmath65 in summary , quasidensities look like _ mixed - state _ wigner quasiprobabilities .",
    "typically , the latter are `` less negative '' than wigner functions representing pure states .",
    "the spectral theorem for phase space quantum mechanics was given in  @xcite .",
    "its formulation demands the concept of moyal or twisted product  @xmath66 , indirectly defined by @xmath67 . to alleviate notation in what follows",
    "we employ the convention @xmath68 , and similarly for the other variables .",

    "then :    * the solutions @xmath72 , for @xmath73 , of the simultaneous eigenvalue equations : @xmath74 form a doubly indexed orthogonal basis for the space of functions on phase space .",
    "these functions describe stationary states when @xmath75 ; when @xmath76 they describe transitions between pairs of states .",

    "the sequence of those eigenvalues gives precisely the spectrum of  @xmath78 .",

    "the validity of this variational principle is of course not restricted to electronic systems .",

    "the rest is obvious .",
    "let us invoke the classical hamiltonian of an electronic system under the form : @xmath95 where @xmath96 here @xmath97 denotes the external `` potential '' ( e.g. , due to the nucleus in an atom plus an external magnetic field ) .",
    "it is clear that the energy of a @xmath1-electronic system is a functional of  @xmath44 .",
    "but we can prove more .",
    "the many - body ground state of the system is determined by its 1-body quasidensity .    like in dft , we argue by contradiction .",
    "suppose that we have two different ( by more than a constant ) external potentials @xmath97 , @xmath98 acting on our electronic system , with corresponding ground wigner states @xmath99 , @xmath100 ( assumed different ) and respective ground state energies @xmath85 , @xmath101 , whose associated 1-body quasidensity is the same",

    "expression   is minimized . by corollary  [ cr : minimum - effort ] , @xmath119 , which means that @xmath99 can be obtained from @xmath120 directly even if the external potential is unknown . as in levy s formulation of the hohenberg ",
    "kohn functional  @xcite , @xmath107 is universal , i.e. , independent of  @xmath106 ; nor is a ground state @xmath106-representability condition required .",
    "thus our variational principle escapes the major problems of the original dft one see the discussion in  ( * ? ? ?",
    "systems with external potentials depending on momenta ( as with orbital magnetism ) fall into its purvey . also , in the variation above we need not restrict to one - body wigner quasiprobabilities corresponding to pure states ; only finiteness conditions , such as that @xmath36 should belong to the domain of the kinetic energy , @xmath121 = \\int \\frac{|{{\\mkern-1mu{\\vec{\\mkern1mu p}}}}|^2}{2}\\ , d({{\\mkern-1mu{\\vec{\\mkern1mu q}}}};{{\\mkern-1mu{\\vec{\\mkern1mu p } } } } ) \\,d{{\\mkern-1mu{\\vec{\\mkern1mu q}}}}\\,d{{\\mkern-1mu{\\vec{\\mkern1mu p } } } } < \\infty , \\label{eq : memento } \\ ] ] are implicit .",

    "we have seen in subsection  [ ssc : slkvsm ] that as suggested already in  @xcite the natural definition for the density of kinetic energy within phase space quantum mechanics is given by : @xmath581 for the kinetic energy of a pure state given by a wavefunction @xmath582 , so that @xmath583 , this leads to : @xmath584 rather than the standard @xmath585 .",
    "remarkably , for the ground state of a hydrogenoid ion this leads to a local form of the virial theorem  @xcite . on using   it",
    "is quickly seen that @xmath586 the above points to good local properties of quantities obtained through the phase space formalism : a long standing tenet of the work by dahl and springborg .",
    "for instance , it suggests a description of the exchange hole close to being optimally localized  @xcite . also for many atoms",
    "apparently @xmath587 obeys a local version of the lieb ",
    "oxford identities  @xcite .",
    "now , @xmath588 then with @xmath589 and with the help of and   we compute @xmath590 we have checked that @xmath591 = t[\\rho_{\\mathrm{tf}}]$ ] .",
    "however , we are walking on a tightrope .",
    "for reconsider  , under the more general form @xmath592 where @xmath593 , in the framework of spectral expansions ; it yields @xmath594 = \\sum_i \\frac{n_i}2 \\biggl [ \\bigl(\\nabla\\sqrt{\\rho_i}\\bigr)^2 - { \\beta}\\,\\nabla^2\\rho_i \\biggr].\\ ] ] the formula with any coefficients @xmath595 respecting the sum rule @xmath593 holds _ only for true quantum states_. the phase space formalism seems to `` choose '' @xmath596 ; suppose we had put @xmath597 , forcing @xmath598 , in the calculation .",
    "then we see at once that we would have obtained instead @xmath599 .",
    "this is all very well for a real atom , since then @xmath600 ; but for the thomas  fermi model @xmath601 diverges .",
    "the appearance in the last display of the term of the von weizscker type , everywhere positive and finite , is welcome .",
    "this kind of term is known to tame the worse aspects of the tf functional , in particular allowing for a good behaviour at the atomic nucleus site .",
    "because of the schwarz inequality , the von weizscker functional @xmath602 $ ] is convex ; this means in particular that @xmath603 : = \\int \\frac{(\\nabla\\rho)^2}{8\\rho } \\,d{{\\mkern-1mu{\\vec{\\mkern1mu q}}}}\\le \\sum_i n_i \\int \\frac{(\\nabla\\rho_i)^2}{8\\rho_i } \\ , d{{\\mkern-1mu{\\vec{\\mkern1mu q}}}},\\ ] ] for @xmath468 as in the foregoing ; for an atomic system the integral on right hand side should precisely give the total kinetic energy .",
    "links it to relative entropy ; but we refrain from going into that . ]    it is interesting to revisit harmonium in this context .",
    "it is not hard to see  @xcite that the kinetic energy density for this system is of the form @xmath604 + 3 \\rho(q)\\ ,",
    "\\frac{({\\omega}- \\mu)^2}{8({\\omega}+ \\mu)}.\\ ] ] note that only the von weizscker term contributes in the weak repulsion limit .",
    "we run a check on this .",
    "enter equation  ; from it we glean that @xmath605(q )   = 2\\biggl ( \\frac{{\\omega}\\mu}{{\\omega}+ \\mu } \\biggr)^2 q^2 \\rho_{\\mathrm{gs}}(q).\\ ] ] therefore @xmath606(q ) \\,d^3q + \\frac{3({\\omega}- \\mu)^2}{4({\\omega}+ \\mu ) } = \\frac{3{\\omega}\\mu}{{\\omega}+ \\mu } + \\frac{3({\\omega}- \\mu)^2}{4({\\omega}+ \\mu ) } = \\frac{3({\\omega}+ \\mu)}{4},\\ ] ] as it should be .",
    "nothing prevents making variational calculations with the functional , or appropriate corrections of it , by trial families of wigner gaussian orbitals , using the formulas of subsection  [ ssc : megisto ] .",
    "the facts indicated at the end of subsection  [ aps : eppure - si - muove ] ensure reasonable results .",
    "those who do not fancy gaussian basis sets then face the question of characterizing wigner quasiprobabilities .",
    "a one - body wigner function is just @xmath1 times a convex combination of _ pure _ states on a single copy of phase space .",
    "thus the question is how to recognize a quantum pure state representative among all functions on phase space . beyond reality and square summability ,",
    "some necessary conditions are easy : continuity ( not smoothness , as is sometimes erroneously assumed ) ; the bound  ; positivity of the integrals  , and indeed of the integral over any lagrangian plane of the phase space .",
    "a less known necessary condition is the following . given a wave function @xmath607 , for each @xmath608 consider the translated wave function @xmath609 its wigner counterpart is clearly given by @xmath610 , if @xmath611 corresponds to @xmath607 .",
    "thus we also have the necessary condition @xmath612 for all pure states  @xmath613 , all wigner quasiprobabilities @xmath272 and all @xmath608 .",
    "necessary and sufficient conditions are harder to come by .",
    "the defining condition @xmath614 is difficult to handle .",
    "equivalent conditions will have an oscillatory integral somewhere ; however , the following alternative may appear more convenient to some . performing a fourier",
    "transform on the second set of variables , we obtain @xmath615 thus , with @xmath616 , we get @xmath617 this condition is easily seen to be sufficient as well .",
    "also note that @xmath618      we are much indebted to jens peder dahl and michael springborg , who over the years followed the development of the ideas presented here , to which they have contributed numerous suggestions and needed criticism .",
    "many thanks are due to daniel gandolfo , for prompt and knowledgeable help with numerical computations , and to jan dereziski for pleasurable discussions .",
