    "easy access of publications via web has increased their visibility , leading the volume of authors and their publications increased exponentially , especially in computer science ( cs ) domain , during last decade  @xcite and made ranking authors harder .",
    "an effective index may help nominating an outstanding researcher for award , allocating research grants , etc .",
    "one may ask  _ is it possible to design an evaluation index for authors by combining multiple features , such as citation count , impact of coauthors , citing authors profiles , etc such that not only high performers but also performance of the beginners ( including young researchers ) can be quantified unambiguously ? _",
    "most popular way of ranking authors is based on citations their works receive from peers .",
    "based on citation count , several elegant yet simple indices exist : h - index , g - index , rank - citation index  @xcite , and so on . a closer look in fig .",
    "[ subfigure : h_distribution ] reveals a heavily skewed distribution of cs author count corresponding to the h - index they achieve as observed over a decade spanning from 1998 to 2008 . in 2008 , @xmath180% authors have h - index only upto 2 ; max - scale 43 .",
    "the drift of h - index of 1998 author set observed in 2008 is also very small ( fig .",
    "[ subfigure : bar_plot ] ) .",
    "the same holds true for other derivatives of h - index .",
    "hence , such indices are unable to provide sufficient resolution to bulk authors ( having low index ) including young promising researchers who possibly have published few good papers and would receive enough citations afterwards  @xcite",
    ".    the limitations of citation count can be compensated by considering other features like ( a ) co - authors profile - here an author s score is directly proportional to her co - authors score , assuming that high - performers will publish with promising ones , ( b ) citing authors profile - here an author s score is directly proportional to citing authors score , assuming that high - profile authors refer to quality papers .",
    "in contrast to h - index and its derivatives , there are approaches which model above features as author - author collaboration and author - author citation networks and applied page - rank based algorithms  @xcite to rank authors . obtaining a scoring function by modeling and combining multiple features is tricky ; and unfortunately , multi - layered modeling has not been tried much .",
    "moreover , existing literature broadly concerned on the dynamics of high and medium profile authors , and strangely ignored the bottom - liners who represent the bulk .    in this work we model the citations of papers and authors as well as coauthorship profile of authors in a novel way using a weighted multi - layered network and propose a variant of page - rank algorithm to rank authors .",
    "our evaluation score is consistent over years and can effectively be used for ranking authors and predict early risers . in the next section we explain the dataset , the underlying network model and ranking algorithm followed by the results .",
    "* dataset . *",
    "we use the dataset available in arnetminer project @xcite , containing 2,244,021 papers published between 1960 and 2013 .",
    "after preprocessing , we consider 1,421,121 papers and 833,306 authors respectively in the years 1960 - 2008 .",
    "while considering the impact of an author till year @xmath2 we only consider the evidences from our dataset till year @xmath2 .    * network model . *",
    "to utilize all the above features in parallel , we use network model shown in fig [ subfigure : network_model ] .    *",
    "measuring _ @xmath0-index_. * the strategy we propose is called _ @xmath0-index _ ( abbreviation of paper - paper * c*itations , author - author * c*itations and author - author * c*ollaborations ) , where the author score @xmath3 at iteration @xmath4 is obtained as the normalized sum described by : @xmath5 . here @xmath6 , set to 0.5 in our experiments , is the _ damping factor _ for the page - rank based strategy .",
    "the component scores , * a*uthor * c*itation * i*ndex ( _ aci _ ) , * a*uthor co*a*uthorship * i*ndex ( _ aai _ ) and * p*aper * c*itation * i*ndex ( _ pci _ ) are obtained in iteration @xmath4 using :    @xmath7    @xmath8    @xmath9 , where _ pqi _ , refers to as * p*aper * q*uality * i*ndex for a paper , is obtained as : @xmath10 . here , @xmath11 is set of papers of author @xmath12 , @xmath13 is set of authors citing author @xmath12 , and @xmath14 is set of authors coauthoring with @xmath12 .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 decides the way credit a paper being shared among coauthors .",
    "we set @xmath15 to 0 , meaning that all the coauthors will receive equal share .",
    "but other values of @xmath15 may be tried , the credit then will be shared based on current @xmath16-index of the coauthors .    * results . * scatter - plots in fig .",
    "[ subfigure : scatter_plot ] show @xmath0-index for authors against their h - index for citation dataset relevant till 1998 ( inset : till 2008 ) .",
    "we observe large pile of authors for each h - index values ; however , one can notice that the authors bearing same h - index are sufficiently dispersed along the vertical scale .",
    "this indicate that @xmath0-index may be used to break the ties between authors having same h - index .",
    "moreover , we observe large cluster of points close to the diagonal , indicating strong reasonable correlation among @xmath17-index and h - index .",
    ".h - index and @xmath0-index component scores of eight authors from 1998 author pool [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     to understand the inconsistent points of the diagram we choose eight points from fig .",
    "[ subfigure : scatter_plot ] and find their h - index and @xmath17-index component scores ( refer to table [ table : ecc_component_distribution ] ) .",
    "we observe h - index having strong correlation with aci scores , but weaker correlation with the others , inferring that h - index could capture aci score well , but tends to ignore the others .",
    "these components are related to coauthorship layer , and may provide additional information that h - index is unable to furnish .",
    "surprisingly , we further observe that the ranking of authors ( especially those having very low h - index ) ( layer 1 ) based on @xmath0-index at early stage of their careers has high resemblance in later time periods .",
    "for instance , ranking of authors ( with h - indices 1 and 2 ) in 1998 based on @xmath0-index has high correlation ( perason coefficient ) with the same in 2004 ( 0.75 , 0.74 ) and 2008 ( 0.55,0.50 ) .",
    "therefore , we anticipate that @xmath0-index can further be used to predict the successful authors as observed in fig .",
    "[ subfigure : author_flight ] , where growth of the same authors are shown till 2008 .",
    "the proposed multi - feature based evaluation score successfully resolves ambiguity among the major class of low profile authors which we believe is a major contribution .",
    "the impact of growth / failure / saturation of an author score needs to be studied more systematically with respect to features like topical influence in which the author primarily works .",
    "a thorough investigation is required to show the universality of our findings for other domains .",
    "one can think of categorizing the authors based on their future prospect ."
