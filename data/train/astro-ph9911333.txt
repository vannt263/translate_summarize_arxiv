    "mergers of galaxies in slow collisions and tidal interactions in rapid collisions are two key dynamical processes that occur in groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "cosmological @xmath0-body simulations are beginning to approach the resolution necessary to study galaxy dynamics in groups and clusters ( see moore , in these proceedings ) .",
    "moreover , mergers and tidal collisions leave significant observational signatures , in the form of tidal tails , asymmetries and generally disturbed morphologies and internal kinematics ( see amram , in these proceedings ) .",
    "also , galaxy merging is an essential mechanism for driving elliptical galaxy morphologies given disk - like progenitors . as such ,",
    "an understanding of galaxy merging is very important for semi - analytical modeling of galaxy formation .    in this review ,",
    "i compute analytically the rates at which a galaxy of given mass and position within a cluster or group with a @xcite ( @xcite , nfw ) potential undergoes slow major mergers with lower mass galaxies and rapid tidal encounters .",
    "since the collision cross - sections are strongly modulated by the tides from the group / cluster potential , i begin with a simple formalism for estimating the tides from the system potential .",
    "note that i will not consider ram pressure stripping on galaxies .",
    "the potential of a cluster can exert a strong differential force on a galaxy orbiting within it , but these tides are strongly dependent on the galaxy orbit .",
    "a galaxy on a nearly circular orbit is likely to be tidally locked , as the moon is with respect to the earth . in this case , the tidal force is simply @xcite @xmath1 \\label{ftide}\\ ] ] and equating @xmath2 in eq .",
    "( [ ftide ] ) to the force , @xmath3 that a galaxy exerts on one of its stars yields for @xmath4 a galaxy tidal radius @xmath5 that satisfies a velocity modulated density criterion ( see @xcite ) : @xmath6 \\ , \\label{circtide}\\ ] ] where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are respectively the galaxy s velocity at pericenter and the cluster s circular velocity .",
    "the term in brackets in eq .",
    "( [ circtide ] ) is 2 for circular orbits .",
    "moreover , for a singular isothermal law @xmath9 for both galaxy and cluster , one finds ( see @xcite ) that for circular orbits the galaxy size is proportional to its clustocentric radius : @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the circular velocity of the galaxy . for general density profiles , writing @xmath12 ,",
    "one obtains @xmath13",
    "@xcite used a similar circular - tide criterion to argue that galaxies are strongly tidally limited by the cluster potential .",
    "however , cosmological infall imposes elongated orbits . a galaxy on an elongated orbit experiences a strong tide during its rapid , hence short , passage at pericenter , prompting @xcite to introduce the term _ tidal shock_. during this shock , a star in the galaxy experiences a velocity impulse @xmath14 where we neglected the centrifugal term in @xmath2 , because the galaxy falls in too fast to be phase locked .",
    "a more precise calculation by @xcite , who introduced the _ impulsive approximation _ where the point - mass perturber moves at constant @xmath15 , produces the same relation as in eq .",
    "( [ dvimpulse ] ) with a constant of order unity .",
    "the impulse approximation can also be applied to extended perturbers @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite applied the impulsive approximation to the more realistic @xcite potential and found a dependence of @xmath16 matching that of eq .",
    "( [ dvimpulse ] ) , with a very small dependence on @xmath17 and again the constant is found to be of order unity for elongated orbits ( with order of unity changes when they performed orbit - integrated  instead of straight - line  tidal calculations ) .    the tidal radius",
    "can then be defined as that where the energy increment caused by the tidal perturbation is equal to the binding energy @xcite . with @xmath18 and @xmath19 ,",
    "one obtains another velocity modulated density criterion @xmath20 which for any density profile yields @xmath21    figure  [ tides ] shows the effects of velocity modulation on the tidal radii .",
    "the effective tidal radius should be taken as the largest of the circular and impulsive regimes ( otherwise one would be left with discontinuities in the transition @xmath7 from near - circular to elongated orbits ) .",
    "hence , with homogeneous cores , circular tidal theory produces increasingly smaller tidal radii for orbits of increasing but low elongation , as @xcite found in their @xmath0-body simulations . with cuspy cores as in the nfw profile , low - elongation non - circular orbits experience tidal shocks instead .",
    "the orbit elongation , @xmath22 , found in @xcite s ( @xcite ) high - resolution cosmological simulations corresponds to @xmath23 , roughly yielding @xmath24 as for singular isothermal models , where @xmath25 and @xmath26 are the mean galaxy and cluster velocity dispersions , respectively .",
    "if @xmath27 and if galaxy and cluster density profiles are self - similar , then tides from the cluster potential would force the simple relation @xmath28 .",
    "in fact , using @xmath29 expected for the nfw profile , assuming @xmath30 , and adopting the departures from self - similarity in the nfw profiles noted by @xcite ( @xcite , lower mass nfw profiles are more centrally concentrated ) , one finds @xmath31^{b_m } \\simeq a_r \\",

    "the rate of mergers is obtained by integrating over velocities the merger cross - sections : @xmath38 where @xmath39 ^ 2 $ ] is the merger cross - section and @xmath40 is the distribution of relative velocities ( with @xmath41 ) .",
    "hence , @xmath42 is the rate at which a galaxy suffers a merger . within the virialized regions of clusters with 1d velocity dispersion @xmath43 ,",
    "the velocity distribution is a gaussian with standard deviation @xmath44 : @xmath45 $ ] .",
    "@xcite , @xcite and @xcite have established merger cross - sections from very small @xmath0-body simulations of galaxy collisions , that were based upon the parameters at closest approach .",
    "the maximum distance of closest approach , @xmath46 , was 4 ( @xcite ) or 11 ( @xcite ) times the mean galaxy half - mass radius , @xmath47 .",
    "@xcite used the @xcite cross - section with the @xcite scaling to derive a merger rate .",
    "however , the gaussian approximation for the relative velocity distribution implies that the cross - sections used in eq .",
    "( [ genmergerrate ] ) are based upon impact parameters ( at infinity ) and not at closest approach .",
    "@xcite derived merger cross - sections using high resolution @xmath0-body simulations of colliding galaxies with more realistic density profiles .",
    "their cross - sections are expressed in terms of impact parameters .",
    "@xcite used a simple gravitational focusing recipe to connect the cross - section at closest approach ( which they assumed to be independent of pericentric velocity ) , in units of the velocity at infinity , to the cross - section at infinity ( without making any assumption on the potential energy of interaction of the colliding pair ) . note",
    "that @xcite show that @xmath48 , while @xcite argue that it is approximately the sum of the galaxy _ radii _ ( which are ill - defined ) .",
    "figure  [ globmergrate ] shows the dimensionless merger rates @xmath49 , where @xmath25 is the mean galaxy internal velocity dispersion , derived from @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite .",
    "i rescale the rates of @xcite in terms of half - mass radii using @xmath50 ( to obtain merger rates similar to those of @xcite ) , _",
    "i.e. , _ @xmath51 .",
    "the agreement between the merger rates of @xcite and @xcite is remarkable , given the very simple analytical formulation of the former authors ( but again this required a rescaling , or , in other words , a choice of @xmath52 ) .",
    "the very low merger rate of @xcite in the group regime ( @xmath53 ) is a consequence of the lack of gravitational focusing in that model .",
    "the merger rates of @xcite and @xcite agree to within 15% in the cluster regime ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "this agreement is almost fortuitous since @xcite shows that the merger rate with the @xcite cross - section scales as @xmath55 , while this ratio is very different in @xcite s cross - section . in any event , in the cluster regime the merger rate",
    "can then be written @xmath56 where @xmath57 @xcite . with @xmath58 @xcite ,",
    "appropriate for the @xcite model , the @xcite rate translates to @xmath59 .",
    "figure  [ globmergrate ] shows that @xmath60 , whichever merger cross - section is used .",
    "in fact , it is easy to show that _ for any merger cross - section rapidly decreasing with increasing velocity _ , the merger rate should scale as @xmath61 for @xmath62 , as first found by @xcite for the @xcite cross - section",
    ".    the important conclusion of figure  [ globmergrate ] is that _ for given galaxy parameters , the merger rate is roughly 100 times lower in rich clusters than in poor groups of galaxies_.      if the critical merging velocity @xmath63 is a function of @xmath64 @xcite , it is easy to show that @xmath65 , and if @xmath63 is a function of @xmath66 , then @xmath67 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "similarly , it is reasonable to expect that @xmath68 .",
    "then , given eq .",
    "( [ clustermergrate ] ) and that @xmath69 , the rate of mergers of a galaxy of mass @xmath70 with a galaxy of mass @xmath71 @xmath72    a given galaxy undergoes mergers with other galaxies at a rate @xmath73 where for major mergers with smaller galaxies ( that transform disk galaxies into ellipticals ) , @xmath74 and @xmath75 , while for destruction by mergers with larger galaxies , @xmath76 and @xmath77 . adopting a @xcite form for the mass function of galaxies , @xmath78 , where @xmath79 , eqs .",

    "the rise in merger rates at low mass reflects the rise of merger cross - section with mass , while the decrease at high mass is caused by the sharp decrease in the galaxy mass function yielding few galaxies to merge with .",
    "figure  [ mergratesvsm ] clearly indicates that _ the probability of merger for a given galaxy is always small .",
    "_ moreover , _ low and intermediate mass galaxies ( @xmath83 ) are usually cannibalized before undergoing major mergers_.      one can go one step further and predict the variation of the merger rate with position in the cluster . from eq .",
    "( [ nkofm ] ) , the merger rate scales with radius as @xmath84 where @xmath85 ( see eq .",
    "[ [ mtide ] ] ) , @xmath86 is the mass at the break of the _ field _ galaxy mass function and @xmath87 is the minimum galaxy mass in units of @xmath86 .    assuming a mass density profile @xmath88 and arguing that cluster galaxies are severely tidally truncated by the cluster potential as @xmath89 ( i.e. with eq .  [",
    "[ finalrt ] ] and assuming constant @xmath90 ) , @xcite showed that if galaxies also follow the law @xmath91 , then their masses obey @xmath92 .",
    "note that this sharp scaling of galaxy size with clustocentric distance is now confirmed in high resolution cosmological simulations of clusters @xcite .",
    "hence , _ the radial variation of merger rates are strongly modulated by potential tides_.    by writing @xmath93 , i derived @xmath94 , hence a higher merger rate inside the cluster , with a slope agreeing perfectly with the observed elliptical fraction @xcite , given @xmath95 as predicted in early models of cluster formation @xcite .",
    "the derivation above has one flaw : although galaxy masses were correctly scaled to increase with @xmath96 , i forgot to scale the fraction of cluster mass lying within galaxies in the same way .",
    "therefore , one really expects @xmath97 and @xmath98 yielding a slope @xmath99 for @xmath95 and a null slope for @xmath100 , both in disagreement with the logarithmic gradient of elliptical fraction found by @xcite .",
    "one can use the more realistic nfw density profiles to estimate the radial dependence of the merger rates .",
    "an essential parameter is @xmath101 , which measures the effectiveness of the tides from the cluster potential . because the dynamical friction time scales as @xmath102 times the orbital time @xcite , _ orbit circularization _ , which to first order operates on a dynamical friction time scale , should be very slow for galaxies falling onto clusters , but fairly effective for galaxies falling into small groups .",
    "figure  [ mergerratevsr ] shows the predicted number of major mergers in rich clusters and small groups , extrapolated over a hubble time , using the non - self - similarity of the nfw profiles , an exact scaling of the typical galaxy mass @xmath86 with radius ( see eq .  [",
    "[ mtide ] ] ) , and partial orbit circularization in groups .",
    "the merger rates for constant mass galaxies fall off sharply at small clustocentric radii , simply because tidal truncation of galaxies is so severe that there are no galaxies left that are massive enough to produce a major merger with our test galaxy . in general , the merger rates are maximum for intermediate radii for given test galaxy masses , and at low radii for fixed @xmath103 ( recall though that low mass galaxies get cannibalized before they can undergo a major merger with a smaller galaxy ) . in any event , figure  [ mergerratevsr ] confirms that _ mergers are ineffective in clusters , but very effective in small groups_. note that without resorting to partial orbit circularization within groups , the expected number of mergers in groups is somewhat less than expected from the @xmath104 scaling , because , relative to clusters , the more concentrated nfw profiles in groups lead to stronger modulation of the merger rate by the potential tides .",
    "because non - merging galaxy collisions are by essence rapid , they can be treated as tidal shocks , and it is reasonable to assume that for tidal features to be visible , one requires @xmath105 , where @xmath106 .",
    "hence , @xmath107 . denoting @xmath108 and",
    "@xmath109 the separation and relative velocity at pericenter , and @xmath110 the circular velocity of the perturbing galaxy out to @xmath108 , eq .",
    "( [ dvimpulse ] ) leads to a critical impact parameter @xmath111 where we note that @xmath112 , is almost independent of @xmath108 for realistic density profiles for the perturbing galaxy .",

    "again , _ the rate of tidal encounters is independent of the galaxy mass_. note that the @xmath116 dependence of the rate of tidal encounters illustrates the strong modulation of this rate by the tides from the cluster potential .",
    "figure  [ tideprof ] shows the expected ( eq .  [ [ tiderate ] ] ) number of strong tidal collisions for galaxies in clusters and groups , with @xmath117 as in figure  [ mergerratevsr ] .",
    "although groups are preferential sites for strong tidal encounters , galaxies in the outskirts of clusters should also witness such interactions .",
    "however , the signature of tidal interactions lasts of order @xmath118 , so that the fraction of galaxies in clusters and groups that are currently undergoing tidal interactions is roughly one - tenth of what is displayed in figure  [ tideprof ] .",
    "the strong radial dependence of galaxy masses , predicted by the tidal theory ( eq .  [ mtide ] ) , is clear in the cosmological simulations of @xcite .",
    "should we then witness _ inverse luminosity segregation _ in clusters where , outside of the core , galaxies become more luminous towards the cluster periphery ?",
    "indeed , @xcite found a weak trend of mean galaxy magnitude versus radius for an ensemble of clusters , although they worry that this trend is caused by observational bias .",
    "it may be that incompleteness of the observational samples is washing out the trend rather than creating it .",
    "the lack of mergers in present - day rich clusters has been noted in cosmological simulations of clusters @xcite .",
    "figure  [ mergerratevsr ] shows that in rich clusters , mergers are at best marginally probable for high mass galaxies lying in the cluster body .",
    "given that high mass galaxies are rare , such merging will be difficult ( but not impossible ) to detect observationally or in simulations .    from their h@xmath119 prism surveys of galaxies in clusters , moss and co - workers @xcite",
    "note @xmath120 of spiral galaxies in rich clusters exhibit a _",
    "h@xmath119 morphology and roughly half of these tend to be morphologically disturbed _ and _ have nearby neighbors .",
    "another half of these compact h@xmath119 emission galaxies are in the cluster core , and presumably those have no tidal companions , suggesting that they are harassed by the cluster potential .",
    "but the first half , outside the core are probably _ bona fide _ cases of strong tidal interactions within clusters , leading to an overall frequency of 20% of all galaxies outside the cores of clusters .",
    "it remains to be seen if they are associated to substructures such as infalling groups .",
    "correcting figure  [ tideprof ] for the 1 gyr duration of these tidal features produces an absolute frequency of tidally interacting galaxies in clusters in rough agreement with that found by moss and co - workers ."
