    "uncovering evidence for ( partial ) restoration of chiral symmetry in the medium created in nucleus - nucleus collisions at very high energy is one of the most important but also challenging problems @xcite .",
    "recently , experimental studies along this line have been carried out by measuring fluctuations of conserved charges @xcite as part of the rhic beam energy scan ( bes ) program .",
    "fluctuations of conserved charges are particularly interesting probes of critical phenomena and the phase diagram in qcd @xcite , as well as freezeout conditions in heavy ion collisions @xcite .",
    "the intent of the present work is to provide a link between fluctuations derived from measurements of particle yields in pb ",
    "pb collisions at the lhc and predictions from lattice qcd .",
    "early on , the qcd phase transition was conjectured to be of second order , belonging to the @xmath4 universality class @xcite , for massless light quarks .",
    "current lattice qcd ( lqcd ) simulations at physical quark masses show that , at vanishing or small baryon density , the transition from a hadron gas to a quark gluon plasma is most likely a crossover @xcite .",
    "the results further indicate that the chiral crossover appears in the critical region of the second order transition belonging to the o(2)/o(4 ) universality class @xcite .",
    "consequently , observables such as fluctuations of net baryon number and electric charge , which are sensitive to criticality related with a spontaneous breaking of chiral symmetry , should exhibit characteristic properties governed by the universal part of the free energy @xcite .",
    "the magnetic equation of state and cumulants of net charges at physical quark masses have been studied in lqcd calculations @xcite , as well as in effective chiral models @xcite .",
    "their properties have been shown to be consistent with general expectations for @xmath4 scaling .",
    "these results have opened a new approach to get experimental information on the qcd phase boundary , by measuring higher moments of distributions of event - by - event fluctuations of conserved charges @xcite , and their probability distributions @xcite .",
    "the direct measurement of higher moments of event - by - event fluctuations is complicated by several issues .",
    "first , quantities like fluctuations of the net baryon number can only be reliably obtained if effective methods are applied to correct the data for the efficiency of the detector .",
    "furthermore , for conserved quantities like baryon number , appropriate corrections need to be applied , due to the finite detector acceptance .",
    "the situation has been analyzed by @xcite and attempts at corrections have been applied for acceptance @xcite and for fluctuations induced by the difficult to measure neutral baryons @xcite .",
    "second , such measurements are sensitive to critical effects near the qcd phase boundary only for higher moments of the distributions @xcite , necessitating huge statistics as well as a very precise understanding of possible backgrounds in the measurements . here",
    "we present a different approach , where the second order cumulants and correlations of conserved charges are directly obtained from the measured inclusive distributions , albeit under a special assumption on the shape of the probability distributions .    in the special case that the probability distribution of the number of particles @xmath5 and antiparticles @xmath6 is uncorrelated and poisson , the probability distribution of the variable @xmath7 is a skellam function , which is entirely determined by the mean number of particles @xmath8 and antiparticles @xmath9 @xcite . as is explained in the following section one can then determine the 2nd order susceptibilities directly from inclusive measurements .",
    "the assumption of a skellam distribution for the distribution of net baryon number seems to be well fulfilled at rhic energies up to the second order cumulants @xcite , see also the discussion below . nevertheless , assuming independent production of baryons and anti - baryons is a strong assumption .",
    "however , one should note that generalized susceptibilities @xmath10 do not contain , at least for @xmath11 , any singular terms corresponding to chiral critical behavior if @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "further , there is strong evidence that the fireball is very close to thermal equilibrium as demonstrated by analysis within the framework of the hadron resonance gas ( hrg ) partition function @xcite , which also quantifies the lqcd equation of state in the confined phase @xcite .",
    "the current approach leads then to a direct connection between experimental data integrated over all transverse momenta and second order susceptibilities and , consequently , to direct contact between predictions from lqcd and experimental data without the need to consider , on the experimental side , effects of acceptance and , on the theoretical side , how to extract baryons from lqcd calculations .",
    "we consider a thermal medium of strongly interacting particles of volume @xmath13 at temperature @xmath14 , where the baryon number @xmath15 , strangeness @xmath16 and electric charge @xmath17 are conserved on the average .",
    "the thermodynamics of such a system is characterized by the pressure , @xmath18 in the grand canonical ensemble , where @xmath19 are chemical potentials which guarantee the conservation of all charges @xmath20 .    in this thermal medium , fluctuations of the net charge @xmath21 @xmath22 and correlations @xmath23 of charges @xmath21 and @xmath24 @xmath25 are obtained as derivatives of the reduced thermodynamic pressure @xmath26 , with respect to the corresponding reduced chemical potential @xmath27 , where @xmath28 .",

    "( [ var ] ) and ( [ moment ] ) , the susceptibility is determined by the total mean number of particles and antiparticles @xcite , @xmath34 the above result is valid if there are only particles of the same charge , as for baryons , where the charge is @xmath35 . for strangeness and an electric charge ,",
    "there are hadrons with charge two and three . in this case",
    ", the skellam probability distribution can be generalized , and @xmath30 is expressed by the mean numbers of all particles and antiparticles of different charges @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the net charge susceptibility is then obtained from @xmath37 where @xmath38 and @xmath39 for electric charge and strangeness , respectively .    for the correlation of different charges ,",
    "the corresponding expression reads @xmath40 where @xmath41 , is the mean number of particles and resonances carrying charges @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "the probability distribution of fluctuations of conserved charges can , in general , be measured in heavy ion collisions using event - by - event analysis .",
    "the results for fluctuations of the net baryon , or rather net proton number , obtained by the star collaboration at rhic @xcite , demonstrate clearly that , in central au - au collisions at @xmath44 gev , the fluctuations up to third order can be well described by the skellam distribution .",
    "thus , for small @xmath21 , the distribution @xmath30 of protons and antiprotons must be independent and very close to poisson .",
    "no dramatic changes in soft particle production have been observed so far when going from rhic to lhc energy .",
    "consequently , the assumption of independent particle production also at lhc energy seems well founded and , moreover , can be directly tested experimentally .",
