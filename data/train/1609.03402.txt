    "stars form in reservoirs of gas and dust , which collapse under their own gravity . however , a significant fraction of pre - stellar gas , thanks to the conservation of the gas net angular momentum , lands onto a centrifugally balanced circumstellar disc rather than falling directly onto the forming protostar .",
    "the manner in which matter accretes from the disc onto the star is still poorly understood and , notably , early spherical collapse models  @xcite that neglect the disc formation phase can not explain the variety of mass accretion rates observed in present - day star - forming regions  @xcite .",
    "in particular , these models yield accretion luminosities that are factors of 10@xmath0100 greater than the mean luminosity measured for nearby star - forming regions .",
    "this so - called `` luminosity problem ''  @xcite can be solved if the accretion history onto the protostar is not smooth or quasi - constant , as predicted by spherical collapse models , but highly time - variable , as it naturally occurs in self - consistent models that follow the transition from clouds to protostellar discs  @xcite . in these models ,",
    "protostars spend most of their time in the quiescent phase with low rate of accretion , which is interspersed with short but intense accretion bursts  ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "spectacular examples of these burst systems are a special class of young stars called fu orionis objects , which display outbursts of a factor of hundreds in luminosity which last several decades to hundreds of years .",
    "such flares are thought to be due to drastic increases in the mass accretion rate of such young stars  @xcite .    until recently , it was thought that fu - orionis - type accretion and luminosity bursts were constrained to occur in the solar mass regime of present - day star formation  @xcite .",
    "however , recent numerical hydrodynamics simulations of primordial disc formation around the first very massive stars have also revealed the presence of accretion bursts caused by disc gravitational fragmentation followed by rapid migration of the fragments onto the protostar  .",
    "these studies have revealed highly variable protostellar accretion with multiple bursts , exceeding in numbers their present - day counterparts  @xcite .",
    "the same process of bursts driven by disc fragmentation operates around primordial super - massive stars , relaxing the ultraviolet photon output and enabling the stellar growth to the limit where general - relativistic instability results in the formation of super - massive black holes  @xcite .",
    "consequently , the emerging question is , how universal is variable accretion with episodic bursts in star formation and whether it can be associated to a unique physical mechanism ?",
    "time - variability of accretion onto present - day massive stars at the early phase of their formation is a known they report how asymmetries can develop in self - gravitating discs and generate an azimuthal anisotropy in the accretion flow onto the protostars .",
    "one can particularly notice that in addition to its variable character , it is interspersed with several accretion peaks  ( see fig .  4 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the above cited references",
    ", the sharp increases of the accretion rate are generated in simulations assuming different pre - stellar core masses , ratio of kinetic by gravitational energy @xmath1 , assuming either a _ rigidly _ rotating cloud or a turbulent pre - stellar core .    additionally ,",
    "a luminosity outburst of the massive ( @xmath2 ) young star s255ir - nirs3 was reported in  @xcite by means of 6.7 ghz methanol maser emission .",
    "this emission line has been discovered by  @xcite and constitutes today a well known - tracer of high - mass star forming regions  ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .",
    "fu - orionis - type outbursts  @xcite .    motivated by the above listed numerical studies and observational arguments , we continue to investigate the burst phenomenon in the high - mass regime of star formation .",
    "we follow existing models showing accretion spikes in high - mass star formation , further analyze their nature in the context of the star - disc evolution and conjecture on possible observational implications .",
    "this study is organized as follows . in section  [",
    "sect : method ] , we review the methods that we utilise to carry out our high - resolution simulation of the formation and evolution of a disc surrounding a growing present - day massive protostar generated by the collapse of a _ non - rigidly _ rotating pre - stellar core .",
    "our outcomes are presented and discussed in section  [ sect : results ] .",
    "particularly , our model also generates such outbursts and we show that they are caused by the rapid migration of disc fragments onto the protostar . finally , we conclude on their significances in section  [ section : cc ] .",
    "we perform a 3d numerical radiation hydrodynamics simulation with the pluto code  @xcite that has been augmented with several physics modules for ( i ) self - gravity of the gas and ( ii ) a careful treatment of the proto - stellar irradiation feedback  .",
    "our model has been carried out using a spherical coordinate system ( r,@xmath3,@xmath4 ) mapped with a grid of size @xmath5\\times[0,\\pi/2]\\times[0,2\\pi]$ ] that is made of @xmath6 cells , respectively .",
    "the expands logarithmically in the radial direction , scales as @xmath7 in the polar direction , is uniform in the azimuthal direction and assumes mid - plane symmetry about @xmath8 , such that it allows us to reach sub - au spatial resolution in the inner region of the disc .",
    "the dynamics of the collapse and the accretion flow is calculated in the frame of reference of the fixed protostar that is considered to be evolving inside a as described in  @xcite , we utilise @xmath9 to self - consistently update the stellar mass and interpolate the pre - calculated proto - stellar evolutionary tracks of  @xcite to use them as boundary conditions for the radiation transport module .",
    "we follow the gravitational collapse of a @xmath10 pre - stellar core of outer radius @xmath11 .",
    "the radiation is regulated using the dust opacity prescription of  @xcite while the constant gas opacity is taken to be @xmath12 .",
    "this hybrid radiation transport method allows us to carefully treat disc thermodynamics and to generate the dust sublimation front in massive protostellar accretion discs  ( cf .",
    "* ) . the dust temperature @xmath13 is considered as equal to the gas temperature @xmath14 .",
    "the collapse of the core and the evolution of the accretion disc is followed during @xmath15 .",
    "the midplane density field from simulation ( in @xmath16 ) is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : disk_density_plots ] at different evolutionary times ( in @xmath17 ) . while panel ( a ) represents an overview of the whole disc , panels ( b)-(d )",
    "are zooms focusing on the inner region of the disc .",
    "the first snapshot ( a ) shows the circumstellar medium of the protostar at a time @xmath18 .",
    "in addition to the gas that is being accreted in the innermost @xmath19 of the disc , it develops inhomogeneities by gravitational instability that take the form of spiral arms terminated by dense blobs of gas orbiting at radii @xmath20@xmath0@xmath21 from the protostar .",
    "one of those truelove - resolved arms  ( @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the jeans length and @xmath24 is the grid cell size , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) experiences a local increase in density and develops an overdense clump of circumstellar material at a radial distance of @xmath25 to the central star .",
    "this is how fragmentation occurs at those radii ( @xmath26 ) predicted by the analytic study of  @xcite , despite the fact that only marginal fragmentation for discs like the one around our @xmath27 protostar is foreseen ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : zoom_burst]b ) .    by means of angular momentum transfer to the closest spiral arm",
    ", the clump migrates towards the protostar .",
    "this value is certainly an upper limit because the angular momentum of the clump decreases during its inward migration thanks to the gravitational interaction with the closest spiral arm ( the gravitational torque acting on the clump is negative ) , as was shown in application to low - mass star formation by  @xcite . to follow this process in detail , however , a much smaller ( than 10  au ) sink cell and , as a consequence , much longer integration times are needed .",
    "we leave this investigation for a subsequent .    at time @xmath28 , the clump is at about @xmath29 from the protostar ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disk_density_plots]b ) and its density reaches @xmath30 . .",
    "at time @xmath31 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disk_density_plots]c ) , the stretched clump starts wrapping around the sink cell .",
    "a part of its material is accreted onto the protostar , and , consequently , it affects the star s accretion luminosity @xmath32 ( see section  [ sect : burst ] ) .",
    "when the clump starts migrating towards the star its radius is 20  au .",
    "as the clump approaches the sink cell , its mass has decreased to @xmath33 and its hill radius decreases from approximately 35  au to @xmath34  au , causing the clump to lose part of its mass in the diffuse outer envelope . finally , about @xmath35 is accreted through the sink cell .",
    "after time @xmath36 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : disk_density_plots]d ) , the structure of the density field around the sink cell is that of a spiral of unaccreted dense gas material .    this scenario is episodic in the disc evolution and repeats itself at a time about @xmath37 when another clump is similarly accreted .",
    "the time interval between recurrent accretion bursts can be determined as the time needed to replenish the disc material lost during the last accretion event @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the clump mass and @xmath40 the mass infall rate onto the disc from the collapsing envelope ( see section 3.2 ) . for @xmath41 and @xmath42  yr@xmath43 , typical values for the time of the bursts ,",
    "the characteristic time of recurrent outbursts is @xmath44  kyr .",
    "if @xmath45 is regarded as the time required to increase the disc mass to the limit when the disc fragments , i.e. , as the fragmentation timescale , then the clump migration timescale is much shorter than the fragmentation timescale @xmath45 .",
    "this is indeed evident from figure  [ fig : disk_density_plots ] .",
    "the accretion rate @xmath9 onto the protostar exhibits rapid variations after the disc formation at about @xmath46 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gen_plots]a ) . comparing @xmath9 measured at @xmath47  au with the smooth infall rate @xmath40 from the envelope onto the disc measured at @xmath48 ,",
    "it becomes evident that the oscillations of @xmath9 from about @xmath49 to about @xmath50 are caused by the disc gravitational instability when filaments and spiral arms of different density and length converge towards the protostar .",
    "this correlation between the strength of disc gravitational instability and the protostellar accretion variability is well known in low - mass star formation  @xcite .",
    "the envelope , on the other hand , has a smooth density and velocity structure , and its infall rate that gradually increases with time .",
    "note also that the self - similar solution for the a singular isothermal sphere  @xcite computed as the mean isothermal infall rate at @xmath48 , underestimates the accretion onto the protostar by about an order of magnitude ( fig .",
    "[ fig : gen_plots]a ) , as previously noticed in the context of low - mass and high - mass star formation , see  @xcite and  @xcite , respectively .    at times",
    "@xmath51  kyr and @xmath52 the accretion of parts of the heaviest clumps occurs .",
    "the total luminosity of the protostar , i.e. , the sum of its photospheric luminosity @xmath53 and its accretion luminosity @xmath54 rises simultaneously ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : gen_plots]b ) .",
    "the first luminosity outburst is particularly strong reaching in magnitude @xmath55 .",
    "the second burst is notably weaker because the these accretion and luminosity outbursts are a direct consequence of the accretion of in - spiraling clumps that fall onto the protostar because of the loss of angular momentum that has been exchanged with other structures of the disc such as spiral arms , filaments , and arcs . in fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom_burst ] we present various disc and stellar properties around the time of the first burst .",
    "the accretion rate exhibits a rapid increase from @xmath56  yr@xmath43 to @xmath57 over a time interval of @xmath58 , while the protostar experiences a flare reaching @xmath59 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : zoom_burst]a ) . as the protostar accretes the clump , its mass increases while the disc mass decreases by the amount of mass of the accreted clump .",
    "this results in a remarkable step - like decrease of the ratio ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : zoom_burst]b ) , making the disc temporarily stable to gravitational fragmentation .",
    "it takes a several kyr for the disc to accrete additional mass from the collapsing envelope and produce another similar fragmentation episode .",
    "this phenomenon repeats for as long as there is enough material in the envelope to replenish the disc mass , as was previously found for low - mass  @xcite and primordial star formation  @xcite .     during the time interval corresponding to the first accretion - induced outburst .",
    "bottom panel : protostellar mass ( @xmath60 ) and disc - to - star mass ratio , for a time interval excluding the initial gravitational collapse where no disc has formed yet .",
    "the magenta dots mark the times of the zooms in fig .",

    ", scaledwidth=98.0% ]",
    "we have confirmed the presence of strong peaks in the variable accretion history of high - mass protostars , already present in the literature our higher spatial resolution in the inner disc allows us to explicitly capture the fall of forming circumstellar clumps rather than modelling overdense filaments in the disc that wrap onto the star .",
    "it enables to study this process , well - known in the low - mass and primordial regime of star formation as the so - called episodic accretion - driven outbursts , which we conclude to be also present in the high - mass regime of contemporary star formation . in the subsequent studies ,",
    "numerical simulations with a smaller sink cell are needed to determine more in detail the final fate of the accreted clumps .",
    "however , we expect that the protostellar accretion history remains quantitatively similar in models with sink radii varied by a factor of two , as was earlier shown for low - mass star formation  ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) .    the protostellar accretion history which is highly time - variable and shows sudden accretion spikes , as was found in several previous models of massive - star - forming pre - stellar cores and interpreted as caused by azimuthal asymmetries in the accretion flow . the higher spatial resolution of our model reveals that , in addition to variable accretion indeed caused by the asymmetric character of its disc , the growing massive protostar can accrete material of gaseous clumps formed in spiral arms owing to disc gravitational fragmentation , which rapidly migrate towards the protostar and induce luminous protostellar outbursts .",
    "a similar rapid migration of dense clumps is present in gravitationally unstable discs around solar - mass stars , in primordial discs around the first stars and when high - mass planets form  @xcite .",
    "our work indicates that this also applies to the high - mass regime of star formation , which implies a change in the paradigm which , to the best of our knowledge , considered episodic accretion - induced protostellar outbursts as inherent to low - mass and primordial star formation only .",
    "our study shows that it concerns star formation in general , for a wide range of the physical properties such as the initial mass , @xmath1-ratio , angular momentum distribution or chemical composition of the parent environment in which stars form .",
    "it supports the consideration of star formation as a process ruled by a common set of mechanisms leading to circum - protostellar structures similarly organized , but scaled - up with respect to each other as a function of the initial properties of their parental pre - stellar cores , as observationally suggested  @xcite .",
    "finally , we propose to consider flares from high - mass protostellar objects as a possible tracer of the fragmentation of their accretion discs .",
    "this may apply to the young star s255ir - nirs3 that has recently been associated to a 6.7 ghz methanol maser outburst  @xcite , but also to the other regions of high - mass star formation from which originated similar flares  @xcite and which are showing evidences of accretion flow associated to massive protostars , see e.g. w3(oh )  @xcite , w51  @xcite and w75  @xcite .",
