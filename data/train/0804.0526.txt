    "the uniform roe algebra @xmath1 is a @xmath0-algebra associated with any discrete metric space @xmath2 which encodes analytically the coarse geometry of the space ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ch .  4 ) .",
    "for example , the space @xmath2 has yu s property @xmath3 @xcite if and only if the uniform roe algebra of @xmath2 is nuclear @xcite .",
    "a rich source of examples of interesting metric spaces is the class of discrete groups equipped with a left invariant metric .",
    "for such a group @xmath4 , the uniform roe algebra contains the ( right ) reduced @xmath0-algebra of the group @xmath5 .",
    "the uniform roe algebra is vastly larger than @xmath5 , indeed , unless @xmath4 if finite , it is not separable .",
    "for this reason , it is useful for general metric spaces to consider an analogue of the reduced group @xmath0-algebra . in @xcite",
    "we introduced the notion of a partial translation algebra for a discrete metric space to play this role . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the power of this approach by exhibiting several well known algebras in the new framework . in the context of subspaces of @xmath6",
    "the partial translation algebra encodes the additive structure .",
    "we provide several examples of this phenomenon .",
    "in particular the toeplitz extension arises here by considering the algebra associated to the inclusion of the natural numbers in the integers ( theorem [ toeplitz ] ) . replacing the natural numbers by @xmath7 we obtain a trivial extension of @xmath8 by the compacts which is therefore inequivalent to the toeplitz extension ( theorem [ trivial ] ) .",
    "it is also natural to ask what the associated algebra tells us about the additive structure of the primes , and here we make a connection with the classical de polignac conjecture ( theorem [ primes ] ) .    by generalising these ideas to consider the inclusion of the 3-valent tree and the rooted 3-valent tree into the cayley graph of the free group on two generators we are able to recover the extension used by cuntz in his computation in @xcite of the @xmath9-theory of the cuntz algebra @xmath10 ( theorem [ cuntz ] ) .",
    "it is straightforward to generalise this method for the algebras @xmath11 , by considering the cayley graph of the free group @xmath12 on @xmath13 generators , and we give an outline of this .",
    "finally we use the geometry to construct an explicit embedding of @xmath14 into the cuntz algebra @xmath15 ( theorem [ cuntzembedding ] ) .",
    "we do this by exhibiting explicit injective quasi - isometries of the regular 4-valent tree into the regular @xmath16-valent tree which are well behaved with respect to the natural partial translations on these trees .",
    "let @xmath4 be a discrete group equipped with a left invariant metric @xmath17 .",
    "this means that for every element @xmath18 the map on @xmath4 defined using the left multiplication by @xmath19 is an _ isometry _ with respect to the metric @xmath17 . on the other hand , the right multiplication by an element @xmath20 moves every element @xmath21 by the same amount : @xmath22 by analogy with metric geometry",
    ", we will call such maps _ translations_. these two actions together are responsible for the symmetries and the homogeneity of the group @xmath4 regarded as a metric space with respect to the left invariant metric @xmath17 .",
    "it is clear that one can not hope to have the same amount of information for a general discrete metric space @xmath2 .",
    "however , in @xcite , we introduced a way of measuring homogeneity .",
    "a starting point of our investigations was the observation that , up to a bounded amount of distortion , a metric subspace of a discrete group retains a degree of symmetry .",
    "moreover , this induced structure can be codified .",
    "r5 cm      solid arrows describe the partial translation @xmath23 acting on the subset @xmath24 of the free group @xmath25 ; dashed arrows denote left multiplication by @xmath26 .    by a",
    "_ partial translation _ we mean a bijection @xmath27 defined on a subset @xmath28 , taking values in a subset of @xmath2 , such that @xmath29 is bounded for all @xmath30 .",
    "this notion was introduced by roe ( * ? ? ?",
    "* def .  10.21 ) in his discussion of the coarse groupoid of skandalis , tu and yu @xcite .",
    "equivalently , a partial translation may be described in terms of its graph ; from that point of view it may be defined as a subspace of @xmath31 which lies within a bounded distance of the diagonal and such that the coordinate projections are injective . in the case",
    "when @xmath2 is a discrete group , right multiplication by an element @xmath32 determines a partial translation @xmath33 , which is defined for every @xmath34 .",
    "let @xmath2 be a uniformly discrete bounded geometry space , and let @xmath35 be a family of disjoint partial translations on @xmath2 .",
    "each of the partial translations @xmath36 induces a partial isometry @xmath37 on @xmath38 defined by @xmath39 for @xmath40 in the domain of @xmath27 , and @xmath41 for @xmath40 not in the domain .    the _ partial translation algebra _",
    "@xmath42 is the @xmath0 sub - algebra of the uniform roe algebra , @xmath1 , generated by the partial translations in @xmath35 , regarded as partial isometries in @xmath38 ( see @xcite for a discussion of @xmath1 )",
    ".    note that for any partial translation @xmath27 the inverse @xmath43 is also defined as a partial translation on @xmath2 and that as an element of @xmath38 , it induces the adjoint @xmath44 of @xmath37 .",
    "the notion of a partial translation algebra was introduced to play the role of the reduced group @xmath0-algebra for a discrete metric space , and in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* thm 27 ) we prove that in a countable discrete group there is a canonical family of partial translations @xmath35 such that the algebra @xmath42 is isomorphic to @xmath5 .    in general , without additional constraints on the partial translations",
    ", we do not expect to be able to recover ( or use ) geometric information .",
    "however , as we showed in @xcite , in many cases , and in particular in the case of a subspace of a discrete group , we can choose our partial translations to satisfy strong ( partial ) homogeneity conditions which control the structure of the corresponding partial translation algebras and relate this to the geometry of the space .",
    "the analytic properties of this algebra capture some interesting metric properties of the space @xmath2 .",
    "one example of this relation is the statement that when @xmath2 is sufficiently homogeneous ( i.e. , in the language of @xcite it admits a free and globally controlled atlas for some partial translation structure ) , then the following statements are all equivalent ( * ? ? ? *",
    "thm 29 ) :    1 .",
    "the space @xmath2 has property @xmath3 ; 2 .",
    "the uniform roe algebra @xmath1 is nuclear ; 3 .",
    "the algebra @xmath1 is exact .",
    "the conditions of this statement are satisfied , for example , when @xmath2 admits an injective uniform embedding into a countable discrete group",
    ".    in this paper we will consider subspaces of trees , which of course embed in free groups and therefore inherit well behaved partial translations .",
    "coburn s theorem , @xcite , states that the toeplitz algebra is the middle term of an extension :    @xmath46    where @xmath47 denotes the compacts .",
    "this extension arises naturally by viewing the generator of the toeplitz algebra as the unilateral shift on @xmath48 and identifying the generator of @xmath8 with the biliteral shift on @xmath49 , induced by the identification of @xmath8 with the reduced @xmath0 algebra of @xmath50 .",
    "the point of introducing it here is that , as we shall see , it yields the first non - trivial example of a partial translation algebra , arising from the inclusion of @xmath51 in @xmath45 .      in this section",
    "we establish the following :    [ toeplitz ] the translation algebra @xmath52 arising from the inclusion of the natural numbers in the integers is isomorphic to the toeplitz algebra , and moreover the inclusion induces the toeplitz extension .    regarding @xmath45 as an infinite cyclic group , it is equipped with a canonical family of partial translations inherited from the right action of the group on itself .",
    "the partial translation algebra of @xmath45 induced by this is , by definition , the reduced group @xmath0-algebra @xmath53 .",
    "this is generated by a single element , @xmath54 , the _ bilateral _ shift on @xmath49 induced by the partial translation ( actually a translation ) @xmath55 .",
    "the subspace @xmath51 ( which for our purposes will include 0 ) inherits a family of partial translations by restricting , and corestricting the translations of @xmath45 to @xmath51 .",
    "that is , the set of partial translations on @xmath51 consists of all maps @xmath56 defined on @xmath51 of the form @xmath57 where @xmath58 , along with all maps of the form @xmath59 where @xmath60 .",
    "the corresponding partial translation algebra is by definition the @xmath0-algebra @xmath61 generated by the partial isometries @xmath62 and @xmath63 corresponding to the partial translations @xmath64 , @xmath65 and @xmath66 , @xmath67 .",
    "the partial translation algebra @xmath52 is generated by @xmath68 ( and its adjoint ) where @xmath68 acts on @xmath48 as a _",
    "unilateral _ shift .",
    "it contains the algebra of compact operators on @xmath48 .",
    "it is clear that for each @xmath13 the operator @xmath69 is induced by the partial translation @xmath56 , while @xmath70 is induced by @xmath71 proving the first part of the lemma .",
    "the operator @xmath72 is the projection onto the subspace spanned by @xmath73 , and conjugating by the operators @xmath74 we obtain all the matrix elements , so @xmath52 contains the algebra of compact operators .",
    "since one can cancel pairs @xmath75 , a general element of @xmath52 of the form @xmath76 can be reduced to @xmath77 .",
    "suppose that @xmath78 is positive .",
    "then it is easy to see that @xmath79 is a subtranslation of @xmath56 , that is , its domain is a subset of the domain of @xmath56 and where both are defined they are equal .",
    "moreover the domains differ only by a finite set .",
    "hence as operators @xmath80 and @xmath69 differ by a finite rank operator . similarly if @xmath81 is negative then @xmath79 is a subtranslation of @xmath56 , and the operators @xmath80 and @xmath82 again differ by a finite rank operator .",
    "thus elements of the form @xmath69 and @xmath70 along with finite rank operators span a dense subspace of @xmath52 .",
    "it is easy to see that @xmath83 and @xmath84 never differ by a compact operator ( there is no cancellation between them ) while @xmath83 and @xmath85 differ by a compact operator only if @xmath86 .",
    "hence the map @xmath87 , @xmath88 , and @xmath89 for every compact operator @xmath90 , extends to a well defined linear map from a dense subspace of @xmath52 to @xmath53 .",
    "this map is moreover a * -algebra homomorphism , and extends by continuity to a * -homomorphism from @xmath52 to @xmath53 with kernel consisting of compact operators , giving us an extension @xmath91    we now make the following identifications .",
    "the hilbert space @xmath48 is naturally identified with the hardy space @xmath92 , by taking @xmath93 to @xmath94 for @xmath95 . similarly @xmath49 is naturally identified with @xmath96 , again the map takes @xmath93 to @xmath94 ( however this is now for all @xmath97 ) . with these identifications",
    "@xmath68 is identified with @xmath98 , the toeplitz operator associated with the identity map @xmath99 , while the generator @xmath54 of @xmath53 is identified with @xmath100 , the operator of pointwise multiplication by the function @xmath101 . since @xmath52 and @xmath102 are generated by @xmath68 and @xmath98 respectively , the above identification of hilbert spaces gives an isomorphism @xmath103 .",
    "similarly we have @xmath104 .    the isomorphisms @xmath103 and @xmath105 identify this with the toeplitz extension ,    @xmath106      from now on we will abuse notation , denoting both a partial translation and the operator that it defines with the same symbol , using context to determine the meaning . hence if @xmath108 is a partial translation we may write @xmath109 to denote the adjoint of the operator corresponding to @xmath108 .",
    "we next consider the effect of removing a single point from the group @xmath45 .",
    "[ trivial ] the partial translation algebra @xmath107 is a trivial extension of @xmath8 by the compact operators which is therefore not equivalent ( in the sense of @xmath9-homology ) to the toeplitz extension .",
    "let @xmath110 .",
    "the partial translations on @xmath2 that we obtain by restricting and corestricting the translations of @xmath45 have the form @xmath111 note that @xmath112 is the identity and @xmath113 for all @xmath97 .",
    "it appears _ a priori _ that we need all of these partial translations to generate the algebra @xmath107 , since it is not true in this case that @xmath114 .",
    "in fact we will see that it suffices to have @xmath115 and @xmath116 .",
    "consider @xmath117 .",
    "this acts as the identity on @xmath118 for all @xmath119 , while it is undefined at 1 .",
    "thus , as an element of the algebra , @xmath120 where @xmath121 denotes the rank 1 projection onto the basis element @xmath122 in @xmath38 . hence the algebra @xmath123 contains the rank 1 projection @xmath121 .",
    "now for any @xmath124 , the matrix element @xmath125 is given by @xmath126 , hence the algebra contains all matrix elements , and hence all compact operators .",
    "now consider compositions of the form @xmath127 .",
    "where this is defined it translates by @xmath128 .",
    "in other words it is a subtranslation of @xmath129 .",

    "as before @xmath131 is compact only if @xmath86 and hence we deduce that we have an extension of the form @xmath132 where the map @xmath133 is given by extending linearly the map taking @xmath129 to @xmath134 $ ] and vanishing on the compacts .",
    "we can identify the algebra @xmath123 more explicitly as follows . consider the partial translation @xmath135 .",
    "this takes @xmath136 to @xmath137 .",
    "we can extend it to a globally defined translation @xmath27 on @xmath2 by defining @xmath138 for @xmath139 and @xmath140 .",
    "note that this is a compact perturbation of @xmath135 and hence lies in the algebra .",
    "moreover , @xmath141 is a compact perturbation of @xmath142 for all @xmath13 , thus @xmath123 is generated by @xmath27 along with all compact operators .    now consider the algebra generated by @xmath27 alone .",
    "let @xmath143 be the bijective coarse equivalence defined by @xmath144 for @xmath145 and @xmath146 for @xmath147 .",
    "if @xmath148 denotes the corresponding unitary from @xmath38 to @xmath49 then @xmath149 is right translation by 1 , i.e.  it is the element @xmath150 $ ] in @xmath53 . hence using @xmath148 to identify these two hilbert spaces ,",
    "the algebra @xmath151 is identified with @xmath53 , the algebra of compacts @xmath152 is identified with @xmath153 and hence ( since these together generate @xmath123 we deduce that @xmath123 is identified with the sum @xmath154 .",
    "this identifies the extension as @xmath155    as a @xmath9-homology cycle for @xmath53 this extension is @xmath156 where @xmath157 denotes the right regular representation .",
    "this cycle is degenerate , hence it is a trivial element in @xmath9-homology .",
    "however the k - homology class represented by the toeplitz extension is non - trivial , thus the two extensions are not equivalent .",
    "we will now consider subspaces of @xmath45 such as @xmath158 , having arbitrarily large gaps .",
    "these are said to be coarsely disconnected .",
    "let @xmath2 be a subset of @xmath45 which is coarsely equivalent to @xmath158 .",
    "then @xmath123 is isomorphic to the unitised compacts @xmath159 .",
    "subspaces of @xmath45 which are coarsely equivalent to @xmath158 can be characterised as follows .",
    "let @xmath160 denote the non - negative part of @xmath2 and let @xmath161 denote the negative part of @xmath2 .",
    "then @xmath160 is either finite or consists of an increasing sequence @xmath162 of points with @xmath163 tending to infinity as @xmath164 .",
    "similarly @xmath161 is either finite or consists of an decreasing sequence @xmath165 of points with @xmath166 tending to infinity as @xmath164 , and @xmath167 can not both be finite .",
    "now fix some @xmath168 , and consider @xmath56 the translation by @xmath13 on @xmath2 .",
    "the domain of @xmath56 consists of those @xmath169 such that @xmath170 lies in @xmath2 .",
    "since if @xmath161 is infinite , the gaps @xmath171 tend to infinity , it follows that if the domain is non - empty then there is a least such @xmath40 . similarly there is a greatest such @xmath40 , and",
    "hence the domain of @xmath56 is finite .",
    "thus as an operator on @xmath172 it follows that @xmath56 is compact . for @xmath173",
    "the translation by @xmath13 is the identity on @xmath2 , and hence we deduce that @xmath123 is a subalgebra of the unitisation of the compact operators @xmath159 .",
    "we will now show that @xmath123 contains all matrix elements .",
    "pick some @xmath60 for which the domain of @xmath56 is non - empty , let @xmath40 be the least element of the domain . , and let @xmath174 be the greatest element .",
    "then @xmath175 for some @xmath176 , and the translation @xmath177 takes @xmath40 to @xmath174 and is undefined otherwise .",
    "hence as an operator @xmath177 is the rank 1 operator taking @xmath178 to @xmath179 .",
    "now , for any @xmath180 in @xmath2 , the composition @xmath181 is the rank 1 operator taking @xmath182 to @xmath183 .",
    "the closed span of these operators is @xmath184 , hence we conclude that @xmath185 .    as in the previous examples there is an extension : in this case we see that taking the quotient by the compact operators we obtain a map to @xmath186 , since only the identity on @xmath2 has infinite support , and the quotient here can be regarded as the group @xmath0-algebra of the trivial group .",
    "thus we have the extension @xmath187      the primes inherit a partial translation algebra @xmath188 from the integers and for each positive integer @xmath13 there is specific element @xmath189 represented by translation by @xmath13 .",
    "since there is only one even prime the element @xmath190 is a rank 1 projection , and since the translations act transitively the partial translation algebra contains every compact operator .",
    "clearly the element @xmath191 is the identity , so the partial translation algebra of the primes actually contains the unitised algebra @xmath192 which is an extension of the form :    @xmath187    now the twin prime conjecture is equivalent to the statement that the operator @xmath193 is not compact .",
    "indeed de polignac s generalisation of the twin primes conjecture , which asserts the existence of infinitely many prime pairs separated by distance @xmath13 for each even @xmath13 , ( @xcite ) is equivalent to the statement that @xmath56 is not compact for any even @xmath13 .",
    "note that if de polignac s conjecture holds for some even @xmath13 then the algebra @xmath188 is strictly larger than @xmath159 .",
    "the algebra @xmath159 has a unique ideal , namely @xmath194 .",
    "if @xmath188 is isomorphic to @xmath159 it also must contain a unique ideal and this must be @xmath194 since this is an ideal in @xmath188 .",
    "it follows that taking the quotient by this ideal we obtain in both cases a copy of @xmath186 .",
    "hence @xmath195 .",
    "[ primes ] the algebra @xmath188 is not isomorphic to @xmath159 if and only if de polignac s conjecture holds for some even @xmath13 , if and only if the quotient of @xmath188 by the compact operators is strictly larger than @xmath186 .",
    "in this section we will consider the translation algebras arising from subspaces of the regular 4-valent tree , the cayley graph of the free group of rank 2 , @xmath196 .",
    "we will indicate briefly how the arguments carry over to the general case .",

    "note the reversal of the order of composition , due to the fact that we are using right multiplications , e.g.  the _ operator _",
    "@xmath213 is right multiplication by the _ group element _ @xmath214 .",
    "we now compare @xmath123 with the algebra @xmath216 of a slightly bigger subset of @xmath196 .",

    "consider the corresponding operator @xmath234 on @xmath225 , and let @xmath247 be the truncation @xmath248 where @xmath249 is the projection of @xmath225 onto @xmath38 .",
    "then @xmath247 is a compact perturbation of @xmath40 .",
    "note that as operators on @xmath225 , @xmath250 and @xmath251 differ only on a single basis vector . hence @xmath252 is a compact operator .",
    "thus @xmath253 is a compact perturbation of @xmath254 .",
    "it now suffices to note that @xmath255 , i.e.  for @xmath180 etc .",
    "viewed as translations of @xmath217 , truncating to @xmath2 gives the corresponding translation on @xmath2 .",
    "since we have a right - inverse , which is also a left - inverse modulo compact operators , it follows that the kernel is precisely the compact operators .",
    "we thus produce an extension of @xmath15 @xmath256 this is an analogue for the cuntz algebra of the toeplitz extension .",
    "note that the argument showing that there is a map from @xmath123 to @xmath216 in fact shows that @xmath123 has a universal property : if @xmath3 is any @xmath0-algebra generated by two elements @xmath257 satisfying @xmath258 then there is a surjection from @xmath123 to @xmath3 , taking @xmath198 to @xmath108 and @xmath199 to @xmath27 .",
    "these relations suffice to show that there is a homomorphism from the algebra spanned by the quasi - reduced words to @xmath3 , and this extends by continuity to a surjective * -homomorphism .",
    "another example of an algebra satisfying these relations is the algebra @xmath259 of cuntz , @xcite . by definition",
    "this is the subalgebra of @xmath260 generated by the first two isometries @xmath261 , and since @xmath262 , it follows that @xmath263 . thus there is a surjection from @xmath123 to @xmath259 . in @xcite",
    ", cuntz showed that there is an extension @xmath264 where @xmath265 is an ideal in @xmath259 isomorphic to the algebra of compact operators . here",
    "the quotient map takes the generators of @xmath259 to the generators of @xmath15 .",
    "thus the quotient map @xmath266 factors through the map @xmath267 .",
    "the kernel of the latter is thus an ideal in the kernel of the former , which is @xmath152 .",
    "since this is simple , and the kernel is not the whole of @xmath152 , we deduce that in fact the surjection from @xmath123 to @xmath259 is in fact an isomorphism .",
    "thus we have proved the following theorem .        following the construction in the previous section",
    "we replace the free group @xmath196 with @xmath12 .",
    "again we define the subtree @xmath2 to be spanned by all positive words , and choosing a generator we extend this to a regular @xmath270-valent tree which we call @xmath217 .",
    "the inclusions of @xmath2 and @xmath217 into the cayley graph endow them with partial translation algebras @xmath271 respectively and we obtain isomorphisms @xmath272 and @xmath273 , with the algebras defined by cuntz in @xcite . by the same argument as above the inclusion of @xmath2 into @xmath217",
    "can be shown to induce the extension        in @xcite it was shown that there is an injection of the reduced @xmath0-algebra @xmath275 into @xmath15 .",
    "we conclude by constructing such an inclusion explicitly using our identification of @xmath15 with @xmath216 . to do so we will construct explicit injective quasi - isometries from @xmath196 into @xmath217 .",
    "it is well known that for any @xmath276 the @xmath13-regular tree is quasi - isometric to the @xmath277-regular tree , and such quasi - isometries are easy to construct .",
    "the purpose of the construction given here is that these quasi - isometries are defined in such a way that they behave well with respect to the natural partial translations on @xmath196 and on @xmath217 .",
    "an element @xmath278 is uniquely determined by a geodesic segment emanating from the identity element , and this is encoded by a sequence of turns in the cayley graph of @xmath196 .",
    "to formalise what we mean by a turn we consider the extension of @xmath196 by the cyclic group of order @xmath279 generated by a rotation of the cayley graph around the base point as follows .",
    "let @xmath280 be the automorphism of @xmath196 taking @xmath198 to @xmath199 and @xmath199 to @xmath211 .",
    "we will use the notation @xmath281 for the image of @xmath40 under @xmath280 .",
    "let @xmath282 be the group of automorphisms of @xmath196 generated by @xmath280 , and let @xmath4 be the semi - direct product @xmath283 .",
    "this group is generated by @xmath284 with the relations @xmath285 , @xmath286 and @xmath287 .",
    "in general we have @xmath288 , for @xmath40 a word in @xmath196 .",
    "an element of @xmath196 , viewed as a subgroup of @xmath4 , can be written uniquely in the form @xmath289 , where @xmath290 , @xmath291 for @xmath292 , @xmath293 mod @xmath279 , and if @xmath60 then @xmath294 .",
    "a reduced word in @xmath196 can be directly transcribed in this form , and we note that the condition that the word is reduced translates directly into the restrictions that @xmath294 if @xmath60 , and that there are no factors of @xmath295 , except possibly for the final term @xmath296 .",
    "we will now consider a couple of examples .",
    "the word @xmath297 is equal to the normal form word @xmath298 .",
    "geometrically we can interpret this as saying that starting from an initial heading of east ( the @xmath198 direction ) we go forwards ( @xmath299 ) then turn left and move forward one unit ( @xmath300 ) then turn right and move forward one unit ( @xmath301 ) .",
    "our final heading is east and this may be read from the terminal @xmath302 .",
    "the word @xmath303 is equal to @xmath304 , which geometrically we interpret as moving backwards by 1 while facing east , turning left and moving one unit ( @xmath300 ) then continuing forwards for one unit ( @xmath299 ) . note that at the end we are facing north , which may also be read from the terminal @xmath301 .",
    "backwards moves are special in the following sense : they can only occur as initial moves , and they do not change the direction in which we are facing .",
    "we will call the direction in which we are facing at any stage the _",
    "heading_.    we define a heading function @xmath305 by @xmath306 . as @xmath293 mod @xmath279",
    ", we have @xmath307 .",
    "this justifies the observation above that our final heading can be read from the terminal exponent of @xmath280 .",
    "indeed we note that for a word @xmath40 in @xmath196 , if @xmath308 for @xmath58 then @xmath309 , otherwise @xmath310 determines the final term in the word : if @xmath311 then @xmath312 .    to embed @xmath196 into @xmath217 , we will need to encode the turns @xmath313 and the headings @xmath310 as words in @xmath180 .",
    "define @xmath314 , and define @xmath315 and @xmath316 ( the index is interpreted modulo 4 ) .",
    "we can now define an embedding of @xmath196 into @xmath217 @xmath317 this expression for @xmath318 is not necessarily a reduced word , however at most there is cancellation of one factor of @xmath198 from @xmath319 with one factor of @xmath211 .",
    "one can read off @xmath320 from the right of the word , hence one can recover the original word @xmath40 .",
    "thus @xmath321 is injective .",
    "we can extend @xmath321 to a map from @xmath4 to @xmath217 in the following simple way .",
    "a general element of @xmath4 is of the form @xmath322 , where @xmath290 , @xmath291 for @xmath292 , and if @xmath60 then @xmath294 .",
    "note that we now drop the requirement that @xmath293 mod @xmath279 .",
    "we will call this the normal form for an element of @xmath4 .",
    "we define @xmath323 where as before @xmath324 .",
    "again we can recover the word @xmath40 from its image , thus @xmath325 is injective .",
    "moreover it is a bijection : for any element @xmath174 of @xmath217 we can read off a corresponding word @xmath40 such that @xmath326 .    the restriction of @xmath325 to @xmath196 in @xmath4 is @xmath321 .",
    "moreover @xmath4 decomposes as four left cosets of @xmath196 , and these are preserved by the right action of @xmath196 on @xmath4 .",
    "using the bijection @xmath325 we can define a corresponding action of @xmath196 on @xmath217 .",
    "this action is free and has four orbits which are identified with the cosets by @xmath325 .",
    "given the set of orbit representatives @xmath327 the space @xmath328 is thus identified as @xmath329 , and the action of @xmath196 on the right gives rise to the the representation @xmath330 where @xmath157 is the right regular representation of @xmath331 .",
    "this the natural embedding of @xmath14 into @xmath5 .",
    "furthermore the bijection @xmath325 induces an isomorphism @xmath332 between the bounded linear operators on @xmath333 and those on @xmath225 .",
    "note that @xmath334 is generated by the elements @xmath336 .",
    "we will construct two elements @xmath337 and show that these are the images under @xmath332 of @xmath336 respectively .",
    "it will thus follow that the image of @xmath334 is contained in @xmath216 .",
    "viewed as partial translations our operators are chosen so that for any element @xmath342 , there is a unique term in @xmath343 which is defined at @xmath174 , and likewise for @xmath344 .",
    "moreover we will see that @xmath343 and @xmath344 are bijections from @xmath217 to itself . in terms of the algebra",
    "@xmath216 this means that @xmath343 and @xmath344 are unitaries .          for the benefit of the reader we consider the following example",
    ". then @xmath348 .",
    "thus the action of @xmath343 on @xmath174 , is the same as the right action of @xmath198 on @xmath174 , via the identification @xmath325 of @xmath217 with @xmath4 .",
    "similarly @xmath349 , and we note that the right action of @xmath199 on @xmath350 produces @xmath351 .",
    "thus the action of @xmath344 on @xmath174 agrees with the right action of @xmath199 on @xmath174 .",
    "we now consider the general case .",
    "right multiplication by the element @xmath198 takes a word of the form @xmath322 to @xmath352 .",
    "this is in normal form unless @xmath353 in which case we have cancellation as @xmath354 , thus @xmath355 in terms of the action of @xmath196 on @xmath217 we thus find that multiplication by @xmath198 has the effect of taking a word of the form @xmath356 to @xmath357 , taking @xmath358 to @xmath359 , taking @xmath360 to @xmath361 and taking @xmath362 to @xmath363 .",
    "thus the translation @xmath343 is precisely the right action of @xmath198 on @xmath217 .",
    "similarly right multiplication by the element @xmath199 takes a word of the form @xmath364 to @xmath365 .",
    "this is in normal form unless @xmath366 in which case we have the cancellation @xmath367 hence in terms of the action of @xmath196 on @xmath217 we find that multiplication by @xmath199 has the effect of taking a word of the form @xmath356 to @xmath368 , taking @xmath358 to @xmath369 , taking @xmath370 to @xmath371 and taking @xmath372 to @xmath373 .",
    "again one can check that this is precisely the effect of @xmath344 .",
    "thus the translation @xmath344 is the right action of @xmath199 on @xmath217 .",
    "we conclude that the subalgebra @xmath374 of @xmath216 is generated by two unitaries which act on @xmath375 as @xmath376 , @xmath377 , where @xmath157 is the right regular representation of @xmath196 on @xmath331 .",
    "this completes the proof .",
    "we conclude this section by remarking that the above theorem generalises to show that @xmath378 embeds into @xmath216 where @xmath379 denotes the right regular representation of @xmath4 on @xmath380 . taking @xmath340 as in the proof of the theorem",
    ", we additionally define @xmath381 then @xmath382 takes a word of the form @xmath383 to @xmath384 .",
    "this is precisely the action of @xmath280 by right multiplication on @xmath217 , hence the subalgebra @xmath385 of @xmath216 is canonically identified as @xmath378 .",
