    "the main components of the cell are nucleic acids ( dna and rna ) and proteins .",
    "both are polymers , long words written in alphabets of 4 and 20 letters : 4 nucleotides for dna and rna , and 20 amino acids , for proteins .",
    "the `` fundamental dogma '' of molecular biology describes the usual flow of information in the cell , from dna to mrna to protein .",
    "the first step , _ transcription _ , preserves the sequence read from dna , which is reversed and complemented in the mrna ( in addition , the alphabet is slightly changed ) .",
    "it is straightforward to obtain the dna from a given mrna ( it is called then _ complementary _ dna , or cdna ) ; in fact , nature does it : retrotranscription is performed by viruses and several small `` selfish '' units of information .    the second step , _ translation _ , is more complicated : the mrna is read , three nucleotides at a time , and an amino acid encoded by them is added to the forming protein , according to the well known genetic code ( see table 1 ) .",
    "this nearly universal code associates to each triplet ( _ codon _ ) an amino acid , or the `` stop '' meaning .",
    "table 1 : the ( standard ) genetic code +    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "the purpose of this article is to propose an improvement of the current procedures of protein backtranslation , through the inclusion of coding statistics other than rscu which contribute to characterize the different genomes ; this can be accomplished by the use of genetic algorithms .",
    "we first presented several known coding statistics , showing their idiosyncratic nature .",
    "then we proposed a particular implementation of genetic algorithms , for a small set of coding statistics ; this is only an example , since other choices of the statistics , or other implementations of evolutionary computation , may give better results .",
    "our implementation , which is available at @xcite , _ does _ already produce backtranslations which mimic the coding statistics of the target species , in ways that are not automatically reproduced by rscu imitation .    the definitive test for our approach would be the use of our procedure for the _ in vitro _",
    "generation of actual artificial genes : we expect it to have a higher success frequency than the canonical backtranslation . meanwhile , the _ in silico _ experiment consisting in the backtranslation of a human protein into `` bacterial '' style , and the comparison of the statistics of the resulting gene to those of an homologue bacterial gene ( see section [ subsec : homol ] ) , suggest that our approach is correct .",
    "in fact , the `` optimized '' preimages had more exact matches with the bacterial genes ( at the aligned codon positions ) than the simple rscu - based backtranslation ; this happened when human proteins were optimized for `` bacterial style '' , and also when bacterial proteins were translated into `` human '' .",
    "though small , the systematic increase in exact matches is surprising : we did not expect the imitation of coding statistics to have this effect , since the number of preimages satisfying a given profile is still huge .",
    "this increase in exact matches suggests that the algorithm could be also applied to the problem of `` gene fishing '' through pcr reactions primed by degenerate primers , or `` guessmers '' .",
    "this is a particular case of backtranslation , limited to short sequences selected for their minimal ambiguity .",
    "thus , coding statistics are hard to evaluate ( sequences are short ) and hard to optimize ( sequences are rigid ) . in spite of these difficulties , preliminary _ in silico _ experiments seem to support this application .",
    "another field of application for the ideas presented here is the analysis of sequences : discussions on the relations and origins of coding statistics can be illuminated by massive backtranslation of sequences under some criteria , like we did in [ sec : relaciones ] with rscu to study its relation to spectra and autocorrelation functions .",
    "of special interest are the comparisons between genes suspected , or known , to be related by horizontal transfer@xcite .",
    "values of rscu and/or @xmath0 divergent from the style of a genome have been used to detect horizontally transferred genes ; the degree of their divergence has been used as a clock to determine when a gene was acquired@xcite .",
    "some authors@xcite have done this through a `` reverse amelioration '' which is a kind of backtranslation , and could be enriched by the results and procedures given here .",
    "this research was supported by conicyt through the fondap program in applied mathematics , and was started during a visit to the greg ( _ group de recherche et detude sur les genomes _ ) at the institut of mathematics at luminy , university of marseille , france .",
