    "blue compact dwarf galaxies ( bcds ) are observed to be experiencing intense star formation in a spatially compact region .",
    "the timescale for this star formation episode of mass @xmath6 10@xmath7 is only a few million years .",
    "massive stars have short lifetimes and thus supernova ( sn ) explosions may occur concurrently in regions of cloud collapse .",
    "it is quite probable that this occurs in blue compact dwarf galaxies . in this paper",
    ", we study the confining effect of cloud collapse on an expanding supernova shockfront .",
    "the forces acting on the shockfront include those due to supernova energy , ram pressure and gravity .",
    "when a supernova shockfront expands into a stationary cloud ( sedov 1946 , taylor 1950 , bisnovatyi - kogan & silich 1995 ) , the accreted mass does not contribute to a change in the momentum flux . in a region of cloud collapse ,",
    "not only is mass accreted at a faster rate , it also contributes to a change in the momentum flux .",
    "this additional ram pressure leads to the confinement of a supernova shockfront in a collapsing cloud .",
    "the potential of ram pressure to confine stellar winds of a noncentral ob star to generate a steady - flow situation has been shown ( dopita 1981 ) .",
    "we demonstrate that ram pressure can also confine expanding supernova shockfronts with pressures as high as @xmath6 10@xmath8 dynes/@xmath9 as compared to stellar wind pressure which is @xmath6 10@xmath10 dynes/@xmath9 ( dopita et al 1981 ) .",
    "our self - similar solution describes the time evolution of a central supernova explosion in a collapsing cloud .",
    "we start with a discussion of the gravitational collapse of a cloud , and then obtain the equation for the expansion of a sn shock in the cloud .",
    "we first neglect radiative losses and then include them .",
    "next , we consider a time lag between when the supernova explodes and when the cloud begins to collapse .",
    "finally , we consider the case of multiple sn explosions occurring at the center of a two - component collapsing cloud .",
    "the inner component has higher density and collapses rapidly to produce the central stellar population .",
    "a few million years later , the resulting supernova shockfronts collide with the infalling , less dense , outer component of the cloud .",
    "we first consider a simple model for the free - fall gravitational collapse of a cloud with negligible pressure . the gravitational force on a differential spherical shell with initial radius @xmath11 and radius @xmath12 ,",
    "is @xmath13 where g is the universal gravitational constant and @xmath14 is the initial mass enclosed by this shell .",
    "@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the initial density of the cloud which is assumed to be uniform . solving this equation , assuming the initial velocity is zero , gives @xmath17^{1/2}~.\\ ] ] the free - fall time of the cloud is @xmath18 where @xmath19 is density in units of 10@xmath20 h/@xmath2 .",
    "the free - fall time is independent of the initial radius .",
    "thus , the collapse is homologous as shown in figure 1 .",
    "the velocity of the shell hitting the shock front contributes to the ram pressure that slows down the front .",
    "we normalize the time and radius as @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "hence we obtain @xmath23 this integral gives a cumbersome expression for @xmath24 .",
    "therefore , we approximate the dependence as @xmath25 thus the velocity of the cloud at the shockfront radius , @xmath26 , is @xmath27^{1/2 } } { 2t_{ff}{[f(\\tau)]^{3/2}}}}~.\\ ] ]    accretion of mass just outside the shock front acts to increase in density . mass conservation gives @xmath28 using @xmath29 and @xmath30 gives @xmath31 ^ 3}~.\\ ] ]    there are three forces experienced by the shock front : ( i ) the energy released by the supernova explosion @xmath32 inside the shell gives an outward directed pressure @xmath33 or force @xmath34 .",
    "we use @xmath35 .",
    "( ii ) the ram pressure of the cloud shell hitting the shock front results in an inward directed force ( or pressure ) . when the direction of motion of the external medium and the shockfront are the same , the ram pressure acts only if the speed of the medium is greater than that of the shock front .",
    "this is accounted for by a heaviside function , @xmath36 , of the difference between the shockfront velocity and cloud velocity ( with @xmath37 and @xmath38 ) .",
    "( iii ) the gravitational force is of course inward .",
    "the ambient pressure of the interstellar medium is @xmath6 10@xmath39 dynes/@xmath9 for a density @xmath6 100 @xmath40 and temperature @xmath6 10@xmath41 k. for a typical speed @xmath6 100 km / s , the ram pressure is @xmath6 10@xmath42 dynes/@xmath9 .",
    "for this reason , we neglect the ambient pressure of the interstellar medium .",
    "the rate at which the sn shockfront accretes mass is proportional to the relative velocity between the cloud and the shockfront .",
    "thus ,    @xmath43    where @xmath44    the accreted mass initially moved at the cloud velocity .",
    "it thus contributes to a net change in the momentum flux . for the case where the sn explosion and cloud collapse begin at the same time we have @xmath45 -\\frac{gm_{sh}^2}{2r_{sh}^2}~.\\ ] ]    we normalize time by the free - fall time and the shockfront radius by the sedov - taylor radius at the free - fall time ( within a factor of 1.24 ) ; that is , @xmath46 , where @xmath47 we normalize mass by @xmath48 $ ] .",
    "we define a ` momentum ' variable @xmath49    rewriting equation ( [ dmtau ] ) and equation ( [ deq ] ) in terms of the normalized parameters gives    @xmath50    @xmath51    where @xmath52 thus , we have a system of three non - linear coupled first order equations . for the initial conditions we assume at an early time , @xmath26 and @xmath53 are given by the standard sedov - taylor solution for a stationary cloud .",
    "we use the initial condition that at @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57@xmath58 .",
    "figure 2 shows @xmath59 and the corresponding sedov - taylor solution .",
    "the infalling cloud at first slows the shock expansion and later reverses its motion .",
    "in the above analysis we assumed that the energy within the sn shock was constant , but this is valid only for relatively short times .",
    "we next take into account the radiative losses using the pressure driven snowplow model of cioffi , mckee , and bertschinger ( 1988 ) .",
    "we find that the supernova is confined to a much smaller region in a shorter time .",
    "we use the mean pressure @xmath60 including radiative losses derived by cioffi et al .",
    "( 1988 ) which can be written as @xmath61 where magnitude of @xmath62 is @xmath63 and @xmath64 is metallicity in units of solar metallicity .",
    "thus @xmath60 replaces our earlier pressure @xmath65 .",
    "next , we assume that the metallicity is solar metallicity and we use equation ( [ rho ] ) for density as a function of time .",
    "the differential equation including the radiative losses is @xmath66 we continue to normalize time by the free - fall time . however , we now normalize the radius by @xmath67    we again obtain a self - similar differential equation and we solve it using the initial condition that the shockfront follows the sedov solution at @xmath54 .",
    "we use this initial condition because the transition from the sedov solution to the pressure driven snowplow radiative shockfront occurs at @xmath68 ( cioffi et al .",
    "1988 ) . for @xmath69 ergs and @xmath70 , @xmath71 yr @xmath72 .",
    "the sn explosion may occur at a time @xmath73 after the cloud collapse has begun .",
    "the velocity and density of the shells hitting the shock front is then larger .",
    "we take the zero of time @xmath74 or @xmath75 to be the time when the supernova explodes so that only equation ( [ ftau ] ) needs to be modified and replaced by @xmath76^{1/2 } $ ] , where @xmath77 is termed the `` lag . ''",
    "figure 3 shows sample results for different lags which shows that the shock expansion is more strongly decelerated the longer the lag . for no time lag",
    ", the shockfront is confined to @xmath78 = 1.99 and @xmath79 = 0.51 . in comparison , for 50% time lag , the shockfront is confined to @xmath78 = 1.33 and @xmath79 = 0.23 and for 80% time lag , the shockfront is confined to @xmath78 = 0.75 and @xmath79 = 0.09 .",
    "we now consider a more complete physical picture .",
    "suppose that there is a localized clump of density @xmath80 h/@xmath81 in a cloud of density @xmath82 h/@xmath81 .",
    "suppose that the ambient outer cloud and the inner clump begin to free - fall .",
    "the clump collapses in @xmath83 myrs and forms supernovae in another @xmath84 myrs ( lifetime of @xmath85 star ) .",
    "the free - fall time of the cloud is @xmath86 myrs and thus , the time lag between when the supernova explodes and when the cloud begins to collapse ranges from @xmath87 to @xmath88 .",
    "when the localized clump collapses , the initial mass function is such that many low mass ( lm ) stars form at the same time as a few high mass stars .",
    "the distribution is dn / dm @xmath89 m@xmath90 ( salpeter 1955 ) . if we take the high mass ( hm ) threshold at @xmath91 , then @xmath92 .",
    "the mass of the low mass stars contributes to the gravitational force in addition to the forces described in equation([deqrad ] ) .",
    "the right - hand side of this equation becomes @xmath93 -\\frac{gm_{sh}^2}{2r_{sh}^2 } -\\frac{gm_{sh}m_{lm}}{r_{sh}^2}~.\\ ] ] we find however that the gravitational force contribution of the low mass stars does not significantly alter the trajectory of the sn shockfront .",
    "regarding the stability of the shockfront , notice that the rayleigh - taylor instability occurs in a stratified region where the effective gravity points in the direction of the less dense medium . in the case of an expanding supernova shockfront ,",
    "the effective gravity in the frame of the shockfront is the shockfront acceleration .",
    "our results for the trajectory are all concave down implying that effective gravity points radially outward and thus , away from the relatively rarer medium .",
    "hence , the shockfront is rayleigh - taylor stable .",
    "we conclude that ram pressure from a collapsing cloud reduces the shockfront velocity of one radiative supernova explosion ( occurring in a localized region when the ambient cloud has collapsed by 50% ) to zero at a normalized radius of @xmath94 and a normalized time of @xmath95 .",
    "these fractions scale by the energy of the supernova and the density of the interstellar medium .",
    "observations of nonthermal radio emission in galaxies suggest whether or not the supernovae are confined .",
    "for example , a 22 ghz map of m82 extending over a few hundred parsecs is estimated to have 40 unconfined supernovae ( golla et al 1996 ) .",
    "an 18 cm nonthermal radio emission map of viizw19 extending over 310 pc is estimated to have 2500 unconfined supernovae remnants ( beck .",
    "et al 2004 ) . two examples of apparently confined emission , sbs-0335 and henize 2 - 10 , are described below .    in a model of the nonthermal radio emission from sbs-0335",
    "the emission is confined to @xmath96 pc ( hunt et al .",
    "2004 ) within a @xmath97 pc region ( thuan et al . 1997 ) where star formation occurs in six super - star clusters with ages @xmath98 myrs .",
    "if a supernova explosion of energy @xmath0 ergs occurs after a cloud of initial density 10@xmath20 h/@xmath2 has collapsed by 50%,it is confined to @xmath4 pc in @xmath5 myr .",
    "if this were a supernova exploding in a stationary cloud , it would expand beyond @xmath99 pc in as little as 0.4 myrs .",
    "this would destroy the cloud and the case of a young supernova remnant in a stationary cloud is considerably less probable than a supernova confined in a collapsing cloud .",
    "very large array imaging of another bcd , henize 2 - 10 , indicates a @xmath100 pc region of @xmath101 mjy radio sources in the central @xmath102 starburst region .",
    "henize 2 - 10 has hii regions of sizes between @xmath103 pc and @xmath104 pc and densities between @xmath105 and @xmath106 h/@xmath2 ( kobulnicky , johnson 1999 ) . if we hypothesize that a cloud of an average initial density of @xmath107 h/@xmath81 has collapsed by @xmath3 when @xmath108 supernovae explode , we find that the supernovae are confined to @xmath109 pc in @xmath110 myr .",
    "thus , cloud collapse successfully confines supernova explosions and can account for observed compact nonthermal radio emission .",
    "this simple model can help understand continuous or second / third generation star formation since it suggests why the cloud is not devastated by first generation supernovae .",

    "also , we thank the referee for helpful suggestions .",
