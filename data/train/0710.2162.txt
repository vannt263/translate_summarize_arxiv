    "some remarkable geometric effects can be achieved for projections of `` suitably - deformed '' high - dimensional simple polytopes .",
    "this includes the klee - minty cubes @xcite , the goldfarb cubes  @xcite , and many other exponential examples for variants of the simplex algorithm , but also the `` neighborly cubical polytopes '' first constructed by joswig & ziegler @xcite .",
    "a geometric framework for `` deformed product '' constructions was provided by amenta & ziegler @xcite .    here",
    "we introduce a _",

    "iterated deformed products are thus given by lower - triangular block matrices , where the blocks below the diagonal do not influence the combinatorics of the product ( for suitable right - hand sides ) .",
    "the deformed products @xmath11 are constructed in order to provide interesting images after an affine projection @xmath12 .",
    "the deformations we are after are designed so that certain classes of faces of the deformed product @xmath11 , e.g.  all the @xmath0-faces , are `` preserved '' by a projection to some low - dimensional space , i.e.  mapped to faces of  @xmath13 . in the combinatorially - convenient situation ,",
    "the faces in question are _ strictly preserved _ by the projection ; we give a linear algebra condition that characterizes the faces that are strictly preserved ( projection lemma [ lem : projection ] ) .",
    "we also identify a situation when all nontrivial faces of @xmath13 arise as images @xmath14 of faces @xmath15 that are strictly preserved ( corollary  [ cor : all_strictly ] ) .",

    "the precise form of the matrix representation of the @xmath4-cube , and the combinatorics of the resulting polytopes , is dictated via gale duality by a neighborly simplicial ( ! ) @xmath1-polytope with @xmath3 vertices .",
    "as special cases , we obtain the neighborly cubical polytopes first obtained by joswig & ziegler @xcite , and also geometric realizations for neighborly cubical spheres as described by joswig & rrig  @xcite .",

    "a further analysis shows that the neighborly cubical polytopes , the pdpp polytopes as well as the wedge products do exhibit a wealth of interesting polyhedral surfaces , including the `` surfaces of unusually high genus '' by mcmullen , schulz & wills @xcite , and equivelar surfaces of type @xmath23 .",
