    "cooperation between base stations ( bss ) is receiving in recent years a lot of attention , due to its potential to improve coverage and spectral efficiency .",
    "it has shown considerable benefits especially for cell edge users that suffer from inter - cell interference .",
    "it is also expected to play a significant role due to the coming densification of networks with hetnets @xcite .",
    "the concept of cooperation in the downlink implies that two or more bss exchange user state information and data to offer a stronger beneficial signal with reduced interference .",
    "the total benefit depends on the amount of information exchanged , but also very importantly on the number and positions of nodes that take part in the cooperation .",
    "recent studies have approached the problem of downlink cooperation with the theory of point processes @xcite and stochastic geometry @xcite , where the network topologies follow a certain probability distribution . often , bs positions are modelled by a poisson point process ( ppp ) with some fixed density over the entire plane .",
    "specifically , baccelli and giovanidis @xcite have studied cooperation between pairs of bss .",
    "evaluation for any number of cooperating stations has been done by nigam et al in @xcite , tanbourgi et al in @xcite and baszczyszyn and keeler in @xcite . in all these works ,",
    "the common ground is the use of ppps and the fact that the cooperation is driven by the user , who defines the set of stations for his / her service .",
    "however , the last assumption is not very realistic since it overburdens the backhaul / control channel with intensive communication between bss . furthermore , it is not very clear which user is served by which station .",
    "a simpler and more pragmatic approach is to define a - priori static groups of bss ( that do not change over time ) . in each group ,",
    "the bss may reliably communicate with each other by reservation of control channel bandwidth or installation of optical fibres between them .",
    "if the criterion for grouping relates to geographic proximity , bss in a small distance will coordinate fast and will share a planar area of common interest .",
    "the important question is how exactly should these groups be defined ?",
    "the idea is not new and suggestions have already appeared by papadogiannis et al @xcite , giovanidis et al @xcite , akoum and heath @xcite and pappas and kountouris @xcite .",
    "static clusters have also been considered for the uplink in @xcite , @xcite and @xcite . in these works",
    "however , groups are formed neither systematically , nor optimally . other works model the problem of dynamic clustering as a coalition game @xcite .",
    "we propose in our work a criterion for bs grouping that only depends on geometry .",
    "it is a variation of the nearest neighbour model for point processes suggested by hggstrm and meester @xcite . according to this ,",
    "two bss belong to the same group if one of the two is the nearest neighbour of the other .",
    "this assumption is reasonable for the telecommunication networks because it forms groups based on proximity .",
    "the variation we consider here limits the maximum number of elements @xmath0 that can group together .",
    "since the general problem is very complicated , after presenting the criterion in section [ secii ] , we focus on the case @xmath1 , where the bss can be either single or cooperate in pair with another bs .",
    "this is already interesting , as it raises all the important questions of the general problem .",
    "it leads to fundamental results and is very challenging to study .    in section [ seciii ]",
    "we formally give the notions of single bss and pairs and define the two point processes @xmath2 and @xmath3 that result from a dependent thinning of the original process @xmath4 .",
    "the total interference of the network results from the sum of the interferences of the individual processes @xmath2 and @xmath3 . in section [ seciv ]",
    "we show that these processes are not ppps and provide many of their structural properties : the average proportion of atoms from @xmath4 that belong to @xmath2 and @xmath3 , the average proportion of voronoi surface related to each of them , as well as properties concerning repulsion / attraction .",
    "we continue in section [ secv ] with the interference analysis and obtain explicit expressions for the expected value of the interference created by each one of the two point processes .",
    "we also provide their laplace transform ( lt ) when they are constrained within a finite subset of @xmath5 .",
    "finally , section [ secv ] concludes our work .",
    "all proofs of theorems can be found in the appendix .",
    "let us consider a poisson point process ( ppp ) @xmath4 in @xmath6 with density @xmath7 .",
    "a realisation @xmath8 of the process can be described by the infinite set of ( enumerated ) atoms @xmath9 .",
    "each realisation represents a possible deployment of single antenna base stations ( bss ) on the plane .",
    "we wish to organise these bss ( or atoms ) into _ cooperative groups _ @xmath10 , with possibly different sizes , where size refers to group cardinality @xmath11 .",
    "the index @xmath12 enumerates the formed groups .",
    "we consider groups of atoms whose union exhausts the infinite set @xmath8 and they are _ disjoint _",
    "we aim to find groups that are invariable in size and elements with respect to the random parameters of the telecommunication network ( e.g. fading , shadowing or user positions ) . in this sense , we look for a criterion that aims at _ network - defined , static _ clusters that differ from the user - driven selection of previous works .",
    "for this reason , we use rules that depend only on geometry . based on these",
    ", an atom @xmath14 takes part in a group , based solely on its relative distance to the rest of the atoms @xmath15 .",
    "this geometric criterion is related to the path - loss factor of the channel gain .",
    "when a user lies at a planar point @xmath16 and is served by bs @xmath17 , the gain is equal to @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the euclidean distance between the user and the bs , @xmath20 is the path loss with exponent @xmath21 and @xmath22 models the power of channel fading .",
    "both @xmath23 and @xmath24 hence refer to power , while the channel fading component is a complex number equal to @xmath25 ( e.g. for rayleigh fading @xmath24 is exponentially distributed ) .      in our work",
    "we investigate grouping decisions based on a model proposed by hggstrm and meester @xcite , and further analysed in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , the so called _ nearest neighbour model _",
    "( nnm ) . given the realization",
    "@xmath8 we connect each atom @xmath17 to its geometrically _ nearest neighbour _ by an undirected edge .",
    "this results in a graph @xmath26 , which is well defined , because for a ppp no two inter - atom distances are the same a.s .",
    "and hence each atom has a unique first neighbour .",
    "however , an atom can be the nearest neighbour for a set of atoms ( possibly empty ) .",
    "the nnm has certain properties that make it a good candidate for our purpose .",
    "( p.1 ) the group formation is independent of the ppp density @xmath27 .",
    "( p.2 ) the graph @xmath26 is disconnected , i.e. there always exist two atoms not connected by any path .",
    "( p.3 ) each resulting cluster @xmath28 does not contain _ cycles _ , it is a _ tree _ and hence the graph @xmath26 is a _",
    "forest_. ( p.4 ) the graph contains a.s .",
    "no infinite component , i.e. it does not percolate ( * ? ? ? * th.2.1 and th.5.2 ) .",
    "consequently , the cardinality of each cluster is a.s .",
    "( p.5 ) all atoms necessarily have a nearest neighbour .",
    "an example of a @xmath26 for a realisation of a ppp within a fixed window is shown in fig.[coopclustnn ] .",
    "* model variation : * although the nnm guarantees that the groups are finite , there is no upper bound on the group size . when referring to a telecommunications network , however , it is often more reasonable to bound the maximum group size by a number @xmath0 . for @xmath1",
    "this means that there can appear only single atoms and pairs , for @xmath29 singles , pairs and triplets etc .",
    "it is this modification of the nnm that we propose and analyse in this work , because it will lead to more natural grouping of bss .",
    "algorithmically , starting by a realisation of single atoms , we first search for possible groups of two ( pairs ) .",
    "these are formed when two atoms are mutually nearest neighbours of each other and we result in the case @xmath1 . from this last constellation , to shift to the case @xmath29 , we will consider the existing pairs . for each pair we will search among the single atoms to find if there exist some of them that have one of the pair as nearest neighbour .",
    "if so , we choose the geographically closest with this property and create a group of three .",
    "observe that not all of the pairs will become triplets .",
    "we iterate in this way for larger @xmath0 .",
    "from this point on , the paper will be devoted to the study of the simplest of static cooperation cases , the case @xmath1",
    ".      the following definitions may apply to any process @xmath4 . in our work",
    "we will analyse the case where @xmath4 is a ppp . for two different atoms",

    "this is independent of the point of view of an atom at @xmath17 .",
    "it means that , in average , a percentage @xmath68 of atoms of @xmath69 are singles and @xmath70 of atoms are in pair .",

    "the mnnr criterion leads , hence , to a reasonable splitting of the initial process into two processes , one with singles and another one with pairs of cooperating bss .",
    "now , we can define two new point processes @xmath2 and @xmath3 that result from the _ dependent thinning _ of the ppp @xmath4 with the mnnr criterion , using definitions [ defi1 ] and [ defi2 ] @xmath73      it follows naturally to investigate the size of voronoi cells associated with single atoms or pairs .",
    "a voronoi cell of atom @xmath14 is defined to be the geometric locus of all planar points @xmath74 closer to this atom than to any other atom of @xmath8 @xcite . in a wireless network",

    "[ nr1 ] the average surface proportion of voronoi cells associated with single atoms and that associated with pairs of atoms is independent of the parameter @xmath27 . by monte carlo simulations",

    "the last remark gives first intuition that there is attraction between the cooperating atoms and a repulsion among the single atoms .",
    "we will further analyse these observations in the next section .",
    "we close this paragraph giving an example of the association cells for the singles and the pairs in fig.[sgdp ] . for the pairs",

    "specifically , we try to establish possible similarities related to ppps and for each one discuss issues of repulsion and attraction between their atoms .",
    "a first property is that both processes are _",
    "this is due to the homogeneity of @xmath4 and because by definition , @xmath3 depends only on the distance between elements of @xmath4 . similarly for @xmath2 .",
    "since the two processes result from a dependent thinning of a ppp @xmath4 they may not be ppps .",
    "in fact we can show that they are not : suppose that @xmath3 is a homogeneous ppp . as shown in theorem [ percentage ] , the percentage of its atoms in _ mnnr _ with some other atom of @xmath3 should be around @xmath70 .",

    "the argumentation is not as simple .",
    "nevertheless , we can show this with monte carlo simulations on the average number of single points , which is far from the number @xmath83 , and also using the kolmogorov - smirnov test @xcite , which shows that the number of @xmath2 atoms within a finite window is not poisson distributed .    in what follows",
    ", we will use the ppp as reference process for comparison with the two new processes . for this , we consider two independent ppps , @xmath84 and @xmath85 , that result from independent thinning of the original ppp with probability @xmath86 and @xmath64 respectively .",
    "this is motivated from theorem [ percentage ] .",
    "these ppps will have density @xmath87 and @xmath88 , which gives the same average number of points as the processes @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the _ nearest neighbour function ( nn ) _ , denoted by _ g _ , is the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of the distance from a typical atom of the process to the nearest other atom of the process @xcite .",

    "since we have no analytic expressions , we are tempted to consider the es function of the independently thinned ppps as a reasonable approximation for those of @xmath2 and @xmath3 .",
    "the two functions nn and es can be combined into a single expression known as @xmath106 function .",
    "the latter is a tool introduced by van lieshout and baddeley @xcite to measure repulsion and/or attraction between the atoms of a point process .",
    "it is defined as @xmath107 in the case of the uniform ppp , @xmath108 and @xmath109 , as a consequence of the fact that the reduced campbell measure is identical to the original measure .",
    "hence the @xmath106 function quantifies the differences of any process with the ppp . when @xmath110 , this is an indicator of repulsion between atoms , whereas @xmath111 indicates attraction .",
