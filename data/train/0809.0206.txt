    "( 2008 ) identified a possible progenitor star in an archival @xmath6-band image from vlt / fors .",
    "subsequently maoz and mannucci ( 2008 ) estimated the @xmath7 and @xmath1 magnitudes for the progenitor from archival near infra - red ( nir ) pre - explosion images from vlt / isaac . using accurate relative astrometry between our high - resolution post - explosion ao images and the pre - explosion images from the vlt",

    "the pre- and post - explosion observations of sn 2008bk analysed in this study are summarised in table 1 .",

    "1 ) .      to precisely determine the sn position on the pre - explosion images we derived a geometric transformation between the pre- and post - explosion images .",
    "centroid positions of 26 and 30 point sources were measured in the pre - explosion @xmath7- and @xmath1-band frames , respectively , and in the post - explosion @xmath1-band frame .",

    "the identification of a sufficient number of stars common between the pre- and post - explosion observations in other bands was not possible .",
    "instead , we used centroid positions of 19 stars to derive a general geometric transformation between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 band images .",
    "the @xmath9 and @xmath10 band images were then transformed to the @xmath6-band image with simple rscale transformations ( incl . @xmath14 and @xmath15 shifts and a common scale factor and rotation for @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) using centroid positions of 10 stars common between the frames .",
    "a transformation was also derived between the pre - explosion @xmath8 and @xmath1-band images .",
    "the rms values of the transformations were adopted as the uncertainties ( table 2 ) .",
    "the average of the positions measured for the sn using four different methods ( centroid , gauss and ofilter within the iraf apphot package and psf fitting with snoopy@xmath16 ) was then transformed to each pre - explosion image .",

    "1 , subsections of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath1 band pre - explosion images are shown together with the post - explosion image , all centered on the sn position . however , in the @xmath9 and @xmath10 bands no source was detected at the sn position . to confirm the coincidence of the pre - explosion source with the sn , its position was measured with the four different methods also used for the sn .",
    "the average of the measurements was then adopted as the source position and the standard deviation as its uncertainty . in table 2 ,",
    "the difference between the source and sn positions in @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath1-bands are compared with the total error budget in the relative astrometry ( in @xmath17 coordinates ) .",
    "this confirms that the pre - explosion source is coincident with the sn position within the 1@xmath18 uncertainties in both optical and nir images .",
    "we used the psf fitting package snoopy to measure the magnitude and coordinates for the pre - explosion source in @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath1-bands .",
    "for this several suitable stars were selected to build the model psf .",
    "prior to the actual psf fitting a polynomial surface was fitted to a background region centered on the source position ( but excluding the innermost region around the source ) and subtracted from the image . in the @xmath6- , @xmath7- and",
    "@xmath8-band residual images ( with the psf subtracted ) there was little sign of the original point source , therefore confirming that the pre - explosion object is indeed consistent with a single point source in these bands .",
    "however , in @xmath1-band there was a faint source left in the residual image about 0.5  south of the determined sn position .",
    "this source is at @xmath310% level of the original pre - explosion source peak counts and is therefore not likely to increase significantly the uncertainties in our @xmath1-band photometry .",
    "the code was run both with the source position fixed ( to the sn position ) and free with very little difference in the measured magnitudes .",
    "the uncertainties in the measurements were estimated by simulating and psf fitting ( one at the time ) nine artificial objects around the source position in the residual images .",
    "the quadrature sum of the standard deviation of the simulated source psf magnitudes and the uncertainty in the photometric zero point magnitude was adopted as the photometric error in each band . the magnitude corresponding to a source with a flux three times the standard deviation flux found by simulating and psf fitting faint artificial objects around the sn position was adopted as the upper limit in @xmath9 and @xmath6 bands .",
    "this yielded the following magnitudes for the pre - explosion source : m(@xmath9 ) @xmath19 22.9 ( 3@xmath18 ) , m(@xmath10 ) @xmath19 23.0 ( 3@xmath18 ) , m(@xmath6 ) = 21.20 @xmath0 0.19 , m(@xmath7 ) = 19.50 @xmath0 0.06 , m(@xmath8 ) = 18.78 @xmath0 0.11 , and m(@xmath20 ) = 18.34 @xmath0 0.07 .",
    "the sn 2008bk host galaxy ngc 7793 has two similar distance estimates of 3.91 @xmath0 0.41 mpc ( karachentsev et al .",
    "2003 ) determined from the tip of the red giant branch and 4.1 mpc from the tully fisher relation reported in hyperleda . here , we adopt the former as the more reliable estimate to be used in this study .",
    "the metallicity at the sn 2008bk position was determined using the relationship of pilyugin et al .",
    "( 2004 ) for ngc 7793 .",
    "the offset of sn 2008bk from the host galaxy nucleus of 9.2e and 126.4n ( li et al .",
    "2008 ) was deprojected for the pa ( 83.6 ) and inclination ( 53 ) of the host galaxy as given by hyperleda .",
    "the offset corresponds to a radial distance of 3.47  from the nucleus , at which the oxygen abundance was determined to be about @xmath21 .",
    "following smartt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) we therefore adopt an lmc metallicity ( z = 0.008 ) when estimating an initial mass for the progenitor .",
    "knowledge of the extinction towards the progenitor is important for the accurate determination of the intrinsic colour , temperature and luminosity .",
    "the foreground galactic reddening given by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) is @xmath22 and there appears to be no clear evidence that the sn suffers from high extinction .",
    "morrell & stritzinger ( 2008 ) suggest the spectrum of sn 2008bk taken on 2008 apr 12.4 is similar to sn 1999em ( with @xmath23 , baron et al .",
    "2000 , smartt et al . 2003 ) at + 36 days after explosion .",
    "an additional handle on the total ( galactic+internal ) extinction can be provided by determining the balmer decrement for nearby h  ii regions .",
    "the closest h  ii region for which a previous spectroscopic study is available is for w13 ( mccall et al .",
    "1985 ) , located 1.5  from the site of sn 2008hk .",
    "mccall et al . ( 1985 ) provide raw flux measurements of the balmer lines for w13 which , assuming an intrinsic flux ratio @xmath24 of 2.85 ( hummer & storey 1987 ) , implies @xmath25 . for a cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) @xmath26 galactic extinction law this implies a total extinction of @xmath27 . while this estimate is clearly not directly applicable to the line of sight to sn 2008bk , it indicates that typical starforming regions in the vicinity of sn 2008bk s environment show significant extinction .",
    "we have used the intrinsic colours of lmc and galactic red supergiants of elias et al .",
    "( 1985 ) to fit the observed @xmath28 spectral energy distribution of the progenitor .",
    "we find that a late - type m4i supergiant sed can be fit ( within the uncertainties ) to the observed data with @xmath29 and cardelli et al .",
    "( 1989 ) extinction law ( fig.2 ) .",
    "the brighter @xmath20-band magnitude of the progenitor could be a suggestion that one ( or more ) unresolved sources make up the stellar psf .",
    "this is also indicated by the slight elongation of the k - band pre - explosion source ( see fig . 1 ) and the fact that a faint residual source was left after subtracting the psf ( see sect .",
    "2.3 ) . however , we note that this slight discrepancy could also be due to colour differences between the standard colours and our 2mass - like estimate . in fig.2",
    "we also show that we can not definitely rule out an earlier spectral type with higher @xmath30 , as we can equally well fit the observed sed with an m0i spectrum and @xmath31 .",
    "indeed one can fit even earlier types ( @xmath3g - type yellow supergiants ) by invoking @xmath30 values up to 7 .",
    "however , we favour the m4i solution with av = 1 as a much higher extinction is not supported by the early sn spectra . while the sn peak light could have evaporated circumstellar dust nearby to the sn ( e.g. , dwek 1983 ) therefore explaining a lower extinction towards the sn than for the progenitor we do not find this very likely in the case of sn 2008bk . while the evaporation of a significant amount of circumstellar dust was observed in the case of sn 2008s ( prieto et al . 2008 ) , there is observational evidence for a significant dusty csm in only one type ii - p event , the highly reddened sn 2002hh ( pozzo et al .",
    "2006 ; meikle et al .",
    "furthermore , in the case of sn 2002hh the dusty csm was found to lie well outside the dust evaporation radius resulting from an episodic mass loss that ceased @xmath330 000 years before the sn explosion ( meikle et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "the distance of 3.9@xmath00.4 mpc and a@xmath32 results in m@xmath33 = -9.73 @xmath00.26 for the progenitor .",
    "levesque et al . ( 2006 ) show that using m@xmath33 to determine m@xmath34 is preferable to using the optical bands .",
    "the best fit sed of around m4i would correspond to @xmath35k and a bolometric correction @xmath36 ( both from the levesque et al .",
    "this results in @xmath37 ( assuming @xmath38 = 4.74 ) . the position of the star on a hr diagram is shown in fig .",
    "2 , compared with model tracks from the cambridge stellar evolutionary code , stars ( eggleton 1971 ; pols et al . 1995 ; eldridge & tout 2004 ) .",
    "this yields an initial mass estimate of @xmath39 m@xmath2 for the progenitor . using the method of smartt et al .",
    "( 2008 ) allowing the core - collapse to take place anytime after the end of he - burning gives an initial mass of 9@xmath40 m@xmath2 consistent with the above estimate but with a larger error .",
    "we note that adopting a@xmath41 = 3 and an m0i spectral type would correspond to t@xmath42 = 3750 @xmath0 100 k and @xmath43 = 4.8 @xmath0 0.1 , which would suggest a mass of @xmath44m@xmath2 for the progenitor . if the @xmath20-band psf magnitude is an overestimate due to blending , then the mass will be lower than we determined .",
    "hence our conclusion that this progenitor is another , moderate mass red supergiant is unlikely to be affected .",
    "although the cool surface temperature of the source is also consistent with models of super - agb stars ( e.g. eldridge , mattila & smartt 2007 ) , its luminosity is lower than would be expected for such a star .    the two best constrained progenitors for type ii - p sne before sn 2008bk were for sne 2003gd and 2005cs .",
    "the progenitor for sn 2003gd was found to be a red supergiant with a spectral type in the range of k5 to m3ib and an initial mass of 8@xmath45 m@xmath2 ( smartt et al .",
    "2004 ; van dyk , li & filippenko 2003 ) .",
    "the progenitor for sn 2005cs was found to be a red supergiant no hotter than a k5ia type ( li et al .",
    "2006 ; maund , smartt & danziger 2005 ) and have an initial mass between 6 and 8 m@xmath2 ( eldridge , mattila & smartt 2007 ) .",
    "we have identified a source coincident with sn 2008bk in pre - explosion vlt images in four different optical and near - ir bands making use of adaptive optics @xmath1-band images of the sn from vlt .",
    "the colours and luminosity of the pre - explosion source are consistent with it being a red supergiant having an initial mass of 8.5@xmath01.0 m@xmath2 .",
    "the coincidence of the pre - explosion source with sn 2008bk makes it the fourth intermediate mass ( @xmath38 m@xmath2 ) red supergiant progenitor for a type ii - p sn directly detected in pre - explosion images .",
    "our observations also demonstrate the potential of 8m - class telescopes equipped with adaptive optics ( see also gal - yam et al . 2005 , crockett et al .",
    "2008 ) in precisely identifying sn progenitors in pre - explosion images .",
