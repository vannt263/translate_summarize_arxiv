    "experimental study of the motion of nanoscale objects in fluids has been a topic of considerable interest in recent years  @xcite .",
    "there is a considerable range in the parameters of the systems that can be constructed for study , including the relative magnitudes of the viscous forces versus the inertial forces .",

    "finally , the presence of surfaces near the nano - object can markedly change the motion . achieving a theoretical understanding of the resulting data",
    "presents interesting problems in nonlinear science .",
    "the theoretical study reported here grows out of experiments employing optical torques applied to nanoscale objects , performed by the bonin group  @xcite .",
    "their system consisted of a nanoscale , anisotropically polarizable dielectric rod , held in a viscous medium by an optical trap , and torqued by a rotating electromagnetic field oscillating at an optical frequency . the first experiment  @xcite was complicated by the nearness of the nanorod to the walls of the apparatus . the second experiment  @xcite employed a method to isolate the nanorod from the walls .",
    "newton s second law for rotation gives the equation of motion for the nanorod .",
    "the net torque is a sum of the contributions from the torque produced by the incident electromagnetic wave acting on the induced electric dipole moment of the rod and from the frictional torque of the viscous medium .",
    "since the rate of oscillation of the electromagnetic field is many orders of magnitude more rapid than the motion of the rod , this elementary equation of motion was averaged over many of these oscillations to obtain an equation involving only slowly varying quantities . for the parameters of the particular experimental system of interest  @xcite ,",
    "the damping forces were much greater than the inertial forces , so the inertial term was neglected .",
    "the resulting first - order nonlinear ordinary differential equation has been solved analytically .",
    "we present this solution and apply it to the experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "there have been previous experimental  @xcite and theoretical  @xcite investigations of the driven rotation of a nanoscale _ magnetic _ object with a fixed permanent magnetic moment torqued by a rotating _",

    "the system consists of a cylinder ( the nanorod ) made from insulating material ( borosilicate glass ) , held in an optical trap in a viscous medium ( water ) , and driven by an incident linearly polarized optical beam .",
    "its diameter is approximately one - half micron and its length is a few microns .",
    "the design of the optical trap ensures that the nanorod aligns with its long axis perpendicular to the propagation direction of the optical beam , so that the rod s motion is confined to a plane . the electric field @xmath0 of the optical beam induces a dipole moment @xmath1 in the nanorod according to @xmath2 , which results in a torque @xmath3 .",
    "the tensor polarizability @xmath4 describes the anisotropy caused by shape birefringence  @xcite , which produces a moment @xmath5 that is not parallel to @xmath6 .",
    "although the beam is nominally linearly polarized , its plane of polarization is rotated by passing it through a mechanically rotated half - wave plate ; the polarization plane rotation rate @xmath7 is very slow compared to the optical frequency @xmath8 .",
    "the torque created by the anisotropic polarizability and the rotation of the polarization of the light beam causes the nanorod to rotate in a plane perpendicular to the beam s propagation direction .",
    "newton s second law for rotation then gives for the equation of motion ( eom ) of this system .",
    "however , as just described , this eom contains the very rapidly oscillating electric field and the much more slowly moving nanorod .",
    "therefore , it is appropriate to average out the rapidly varying part , which gives an ordinary differential equation ( ode ) for only the slowly changing variable .",
