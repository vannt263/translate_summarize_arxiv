    "general description of shell and cluster structures is a dream of nuclear structure physics .",
    "describing cluster states starting with shell models , including modern @xmath9 ones , is a big challenge of computational nuclear science@xcite . in general , we need huge model space in order to describe spatially correlating nucleons located at some place with some distance from the origin , when the single particle wave function is expanded with respect to the origin@xcite .",
    "one the other hand , if we start with the cluster model , we can easily describe cluster states with much less computational efforts , but the contribution of non - central interactions , very important in nuclear structure@xcite , vanishes if we assume simple @xmath10 configuration at some localized point for each @xmath0 cluster .",
    "the real systems have both natures of shell and cluster structures and quantum mechanical mixing of these two plays a crucial role in many cases@xcite , thus it is quite intriguing to establish a unified description for the nuclear structure .",
    "our strategy is starting with the cluster model side , contrary to the standard approaches starting with the shell model side , and try to extend the model space to include shell correlations especially for the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction .",
    "as it is well - known , there is certain overlap between the shell and cluster model spaces .",
    "when we take zero limit for the relative distance between clusters , the model space coincides with the lowest shell model configuration owing to the antisymmetrization effect .",
    "this is called elliot su(3 ) limit@xcite .",
    "for instance , if we put four @xmath0 particles in the form of tetrahedron shape and take the zero limit for the relative @xmath0-@xmath0 distances , the wave function coincides with the closed shell configuration of the @xmath11-shell . in this way , for @xmath12 nuclei with magic numbers of three dimensional harmonic oscillator , cluster model wave function can describe the doubly closed shell configurations of major shells . here both spin - orbit favored and unfavored single particle orbits are filled and the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction cancels .",
    "however , it is necessary to break @xmath0 clusters to take into account the spin - orbit contribution , if only spin - orbit favored orbits of the last major shell are occupied .",
    "this is crucial for nuclei corresponding the subclosure of the major shells .",
    "in addition , the  real \" magic numbers of nuclear systems ( beyond 20 ) appear indeed as a result of strong spin - orbit interaction , which are different from the ones corresponding to the closed shell configurations of three dimensional harmonic oscillator .    to overcome this difficulty of the cluster model , we proposed the antisymmetrized quasi - cluster model ( aqcm ) @xcite , which enables us to describe the @xmath1-coupling shell model states with the spin - orbit contribution starting with the cluster model wave function . in the aqcm",
    ", the transition from the cluster- to shell - model - structure can be described by only two parameters : @xmath2 representing the distance between @xmath0 clusters , and @xmath3 which characterizes the transition of @xmath0 cluster(s ) to quasi - cluster(s ) and quantifies the role of the spin - orbit interaction . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have shown that the aqcm wave function in the limit of @xmath13 and @xmath14 corresponds to the @xmath15 closed shell configuration of @xmath16c , and strong attractive contribution of the spin - orbit interaction can be taken into account .",
    "the optimal aqcm ground state of @xmath16c is an intermediate state between the three-@xmath0 cluster state and the shell model state with the @xmath17 subshell closure configuration . from a comparison with the antisymmetrized molecular dynamics ( amd ) model , where all nucleons are treated independently",
    ", we found that the aqcm result is consistent with the amd result ( overlap is about 99% ) except for the small breaking effect of threefold rotational symmetry .",
    "this result is quite surprising , since the number of degrees of freedom in the aqcm trial wave function is significantly fewer than that in the amd .",
    "the purpose of the present work is to show the general applicability of the aqcm framework in heavier region . in this article",
    ", we apply aqcm to various @xmath4 nuclei from @xmath5he to @xmath6fe .",
    "we show that starting with the cluster model wave function , we can generate the @xmath1-coupling shell model wave function with the spin - orbit contribution in these nuclei .",
    "we show and compare the energy curves for the @xmath0+@xmath7ca cluster configuration calculated with and without @xmath0 breaking effect in @xmath8ti .",
    "in this section , we describe the aqcm wave function in this work .      in conventional @xmath0 cluster models ,",
    "the single particle wave function has a gaussian shape @xcite ; @xmath18 \\eta_{i } , \\label{brink - wf}\\ ] ] where @xmath19 represents the spin - isospin part of the wave function , and @xmath20 is a real parameter representing the center of a gaussian wave function for the @xmath21-th particle . in this brink - bloch wave function ,",
    "four nucleons in one @xmath0 cluster share the common @xmath20 value .",
    "hence , the contribution of the spin - orbit interaction vanishes .      in the aqcm",
    ", @xmath0 clusters are changed into quasi clusters . for nucleons in the quasi cluster ,",
    "the single particle wave function is described by a gaussian wave packet , and the center of this packet @xmath22 is a complex parameter ; @xmath23 \\chi_{i } \\tau_{i } ,   \\label{aqcm_sp } \\\\",

    ", we use the value of @xmath26 fm , @xmath27 .",
    "the spin orientation is given by the parameter @xmath28 , which is in general a complex parameter , while the isospin part is fixed to be up ( proton ) or down ( neutron ) , @xmath29 in eq .",
    ", @xmath30 is a unit vector for the intrinsic - spin orientation , and @xmath3 is a real control parameter describing the dissolution of the @xmath0 cluster . as one can see immediately ,",
    "the @xmath31 aqcm wave function , which has no imaginary part , is the same as the conventional brink - bloch wave function .",
    "the aqcm wave function corresponds to the @xmath1-coupling shell model wave function , such as subshell closure configuration , when @xmath14 and @xmath32 .",
    "the mathematical explanation for it is summarized in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the wave function of the total system @xmath33 is antisymmetrized product of these single particle wave functions ; @xmath34 the projection onto parity and angular momentum eigen states can be numerically performed when necessary .",
    "in this section , we show how we transform the cluster wave function to the @xmath1-coupling shell model one in various nuclei from @xmath5he to @xmath6fe .",
    "the nucleus @xmath5he is a closed shell configuration of the lowest @xmath36 shell in the shell model description , and this agrees with the simple @xmath0 cluster model wave function .    in @xmath35be , four additional nucleons occupy @xmath17 orbits in the @xmath1-coupling shell model , and we describe it starting with a wave function of two @xmath0 clusters and transforming it .",
    "suppose that in the intrinsic frame , two @xmath0 clusters are set on the @xmath37 axis with the relative distance @xmath2 .",
    "this is realized by giving gaussian center parameters ( @xmath20 in eq .  ) in the following way ; @xmath38 , and @xmath39 , where @xmath40 is a unit vector in the @xmath37 direction .",
    "here @xmath41 and @xmath42 are parameters for proton spin - up , @xmath43 and @xmath44 are for proton spin - down , @xmath45 and @xmath46 are for neutron spin - up , and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are for neutron spin - down nucleons . based on eq .  , we transform two @xmath0 clusters to quasi clusters .",

    "when @xmath3 is set to zero , the wave function consisting of two quasi clusters agrees with that of two @xmath0 clusters .",

    "if we take the zero limit for the relative distances of @xmath0 clusters with tetrahedron configuration , the wave function corresponds to the doubly closed shell configuration of the @xmath11 shell of the @xmath1-coupling shell model , where both @xmath17 and @xmath69 orbits are occupied .",
