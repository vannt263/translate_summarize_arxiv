    "the idea of noncommutative space - time coordinates is more than half a century old . however , interest in noncommutative  ( nc ) theories has been growing dramatically in recent years due to the observation that open string theories with constant antisymmetric rank - two tensor background fields in the limit of vanishing string tension @xmath0 can be interpreted as yang - mills theories living on a nc manifold  @xcite .",
    "independent of this motivation provided by string theory , noncommutative quantum field theory  ( ncqft ) in itself provides an interesting approach to introducing a fundamental length scale and consequently cutting off short - distance contributions in a way that is consistent with the symmetries of a given model .",
    "although there still remain open questions regarding the definition and consistency of perturbative ncqfts ( e.g.  uv / ir mixing  @xcite and unitarity  @xcite ) one can study a particular nc structure and its phenomenological consequences .",
    "this will be the scope of the present paper .",
    "recently , there has been a lot of activity in model buildung , trying to construct an effective field theory  ( eft ) which is defined on a nc spacetime with a canonical structure @xmath1      = { \\mathrm{i}}\\theta^{\\mu\\nu }      = { \\mathrm{i}}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{nc}}^2 } c^{\\mu\\nu}\\ ] ] and has  ignoring potential violations of the decoupling theorem engendered by uv / ir mixing in higher orders of perturbation theory  the standard model  ( sm ) as low energy limit for  @xmath2 . while it is reasonably straightforward to construct a nc version of qed and there have been several studies of the phenomenological consequences of ncqed  @xcite , it is impossible to comprise the whole  sm without additional constructions .",
    "the key issue here is the realization of gauge invariance on nc spaces  @xcite .",
    "early attempts suffered from the fact that only certain gauge groups could be realized ( in particular @xmath3 , but not  @xmath4  @xcite ) and from the quantization of @xmath5 charges  @xcite .",
    "the latter is caused by the ward identity for the coupling of gauge fields to matter , which forces the triple gauge boson coupling to be identical to the coupling of _ each _ particle to the gauge bosons .",
    "consequently , all particles must carry the _ same _",
    "charge , which is incompatible with the hypercharge assignments in the  sm ( see however  @xcite for a clever symmetry breaking mechanism realizing the correct hypercharges and allowing the construction of a noncommutative extension of the full sm at the price of introducing additional heavy gauge bosons ) .    a general way to overcome the aforementioned problems is provided by the seiberg - witten map  ( swm )  @xcite .",
    "it is an asymptotic expansion in the noncommutativity  @xmath6 which relates the fields on the nc spaces to the fields on a commutative space .",
    "@xmath7 gauge groups and arbitrary @xmath5 charges can be realized by going from lie algebras to their enveloping algebras .",
    "the additional degrees of freedom introduced in this way can be eliminated by the freedom in the swm  @xcite . in this approach , the rle of the triple gauge boson couplings in the ward identities",
    "is taken over by new contact terms and the problem with charge quantization does not appear . a class of realistic models based on the swm and including the full sm has been proposed soon after the introduction of the swm  @xcite . in the following , we will use the term noncommutative standard model  ( ncsm ) for this class of models .",
    "our goal in the current paper is to give a new example of a search for signals of nc structures in the ncsm model and also to present the methods needed for their calculation .",
    "the organization of the current paper is as follows : in section  [ sec : ncsm ] we give a brief introduction to the ncsm . in section  [ sec : neffsign ]",
    "we demonstrate which new effects will appear in the ncsm and propose fermion pair production at a future photon collider as an example for a process where to search for signals of nc theories .",
    "the formalism used in our analysis ",
    "helicity amplitudes with antisymmetric rank - two tensor fields  is presented in section  [ sec : helamp ] .",
    "we then analyze the angular distribution in  @xmath8 . in section  [ sec : ward ] we discuss consistency checks for our calculation . in section  [ sec : xsect ] we present our numerical results before concluding and giving a short outlook to some further possibilities in section  [ sec : concl ] .",
    "we add an extensive appendix with our conventions and details of the formalism used as well as a list of the feynman rules , which will serve as a reference for future work  @xcite .",
    "the nc structure of spacetime is associated with a scale @xmath9 @xmath10      = { \\mathrm{i}}\\theta^{\\mu\\nu }      = { \\mathrm{i}}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{nc}}^2 } c^{\\mu\\nu }      = { \\mathrm{i}}\\frac{1}{\\lambda_{\\text{nc}}^2 }               \\begin{pmatrix }                  0 & - e^1 & - e^2 & - e^3 \\\\",

    "the dimensionless `` electric '' and `` magnetic '' parameters  @xmath11 and  @xmath12 have been introduced in  ( [ eq : theta] ) for future convenience . the microscopic origin of the spurion  @xmath6 is irrelevant as long as we are merely studying the eft , where it appears as a coefficient in front of operators of dimension six or higher .",
    "functions on nc manifolds are realized by functions on a commutative manifold , when their pointwise product is replaced by the moyal - weyl @xmath13-product : @xmath14 f(x ) g(y ) \\right|_{y\\to x }     = f(x ) g(x ) + \\dfrac{{\\mathrm{i}}}{2 } \\theta^{\\mu\\nu }                       ( \\partial_\\mu f(x ) ) ( \\partial_\\nu g(x ) )                 + \\mathcal{o}(\\theta^2)\\,.\\ ] ] gauge theories on a nc manifold can then be constructed with the help of the swm , which expresses the nc matter and gauge fields  @xmath15 and  @xmath16 as functions of commutative matter and gauge fields  @xmath17 and  @xmath18 so that the nc gauge transformations  @xmath19 and  @xmath20 are realized by the commutative gauge transformations  @xmath21 and  @xmath22    @xmath23    to lowest order in  @xmath6 , the swms are    @xmath24    equipped with this machinery , the construction of the ncsm is now straightforward : one has to replace each field by the corresponding swm and all products by @xmath13-products .",
    "this leads to the lagrangian given in  @xcite from which the feynman rules can be derived .",
    "the feynman rules needed in the present paper are collected in appendix  [ app : feyn ] .",
    "the contributions of the higher - dimensional operators are suppressed by the ratios  @xmath25 and  @xmath26 of the electroweak scale , the nc scale and the cms energy of the process",
    ". there have already been several papers exploring the constraints from past and present - day experiments ( at a moment mainly from the non - observation of the lorentz - violating @xmath27 decays @xmath28 at lep , as well as from astrophysics @xcite ) .",
    "the bound on @xmath9 is still surprisingly low , of the order of @xmath29 . in a low lying string scenario",
    "one could expect values for such a scale as low as @xmath30 .",
    "due to the presence of the higher - dimensional operators , there will be deviations of decay rates and production cross sections from the sm predictions .",
    "existing sm vertices receive corrections with new lorentz structures and there are new vertices coupling more than one gauge boson to matter fields .",
    "the latter are required by the former in order to retain gauge invariance .",
    "in addition , there can also be new gauge boson interactions not allowed in the sm , most prominently triple neutral gauge boson vertices such as  @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35  @xcite .    in general , taking the effects of the noncommutativity into account , amplitudes for physical processes are asymptotic expansions in  @xmath6 .",
    "squared matrix elements at  @xmath36 are ( the subscripts 1 and 2 denote the order in  @xmath37 ) @xmath38 for processes forbidden in the sm , only the term  @xmath39 contributes at this order .",
    "if there is a nonvanishing sm amplitude , all interference terms have to be taken into account .",
    "consequently , the term with the first order nc amplitude squared has to be dropped as long as we do not know the second order nc amplitudes , which depend on the second order terms in the swm for the fields .",
    "unfortunately , the swms for the ncsm are not yet known beyond first order .",
    "therefore we concentrate in the present paper on the first order interference terms .    in the following , we will study fermion pair production @xmath40 at a future photon collider .",
    "such a machine has been proposed for a future linear @xmath41-collider with energies up to @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "highly energetic photons are produced with the help of compton backscattering of laser photons off the linac electron beam .",
    "thanks to the compton scattering cross section , the photons can be delivered with a high degree of polarization . indeed polarization will be available from day one , because it is required for obtaining a photon spectrum concentrated at high energies  @xcite . this will be crucial for our considerations .",
    "the center of mass energy is planned to be in the range of several hundreds of  @xmath43 .",
    "we will assume massless fermions in our calculation and postpone the discussion of the specific features of top - quark production and decays to a future publication .",
    "theoretically , the approximation of massless fermions together with the fact of having polarized photons suggests to use the very elegant formalism of helicity amplitudes  @xcite for evaluating the cross section .",
    "unfortunately , the realization of a photon collider still lies many years in the future and we should consider other collider projects that will provide data much sooner .",
    "experiments at the lhc will search for signals of nc theories before the decade is out .",
    "they are sensitive to different combinations of  @xmath11 and  @xmath12  @xcite and will therefore be complementary to experiments at a photon collider .",
    "we shall see below that polarization is extremely helpful for constructing sensitive observables . as already mentioned",
    ", a high degree of polarization works in favor of high luminosity at the photon collider , while there is competition between polarization and luminosity at the lhc .",
    "therefore the degree of polarization at the lhc should be expected to be much smaller compared to the photon collider . in principle , the production of two leptons at a photon collider is less plagued by background contamination than vector boson production at the lhc , but a more detailled investigation is required for a quantitative comparison  @xcite .    the @xmath44 linear collider in the @xmath44 mode will necessarily be commissioned before a photon collider . in this case ,",
    "a high degree of polarization will be part of the experimental program and will support the search for signals of nc theories  @xcite . again",
    "the experiments will be complementary , because processes with polarized photons and processes with polarized fermions depend differently on the parameters  @xmath11 and  @xmath12  @xcite .",
    "the major addition to the established helicity amplitude machinery  @xcite required by our application is the spinor representation of antisymmetric rank - two tensor fields in order to incorporate the noncommutativity into the spinor products . with the help of the schouten identity ( [ eq : schouten ] )",
    "the noncommutativity can be converted in a very elegant way to a spinor expression containing only the spinor metric and a symmetric rank-2 spinor ( for a textbook presentation cf .",
    "@xcite ) : @xmath45 with  @xmath46 .",
    "then  @xmath47 is symmetric with three independent complex components    @xmath48    using the parameterization  ( [ eq : theta] ) , with @xmath49 , @xmath50 . with the help of this expression ,",
