    "since the copula of two continuous random variables is scale - invariant , copulas are regarded as the functions that capture dependence structure between random variables . for many purposes , independence and monotone dependence",
    "have so far been considered two opposite extremes of dependence structure . however , monotone dependence is just a special kind of dependence between two random variables .",
    "more general complete dependence happens when functional relationship between continuous random variables are piecewise monotonic , which corresponds to their copula being a shuffle of min .",
    "see @xcite .",
    "mikusinski et al .",
    "@xcite showed that shuffles of min is dense in the class of all copulas with respect to the uniform norm .",
    "this surprising fact urged the discovery of the ( modified ) sobolev norm by siburg and stoimenov @xcite which is based on the @xmath0-operation introduced by darsow et al .",
    "they @xcite showed that continuous random variables @xmath1 and @xmath2 are mutually completely dependent , i.e.  their functional relationship is any borel measurable bijection , if and only if their copula has unit sobolev - norm .",
    "darsow et al .",
    "@xcite showed that for a real stochastic processes @xmath3 , the validity of the chapman - kolmogorov equations is equivalent to the validity of the equations @xmath4 for all @xmath5 , where @xmath6 denotes the copula of @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "it is then natural to investigate how dependence levels of @xmath9 and @xmath10 are related to that of @xmath11 . aside from @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 ,",
    "the easiest case is when @xmath9 and @xmath10 are mutual complete dependence copulas . in light of our result on denseness of shuffles of min in the mcd copulas",
    ", we shall show that if @xmath15 then @xmath16 .",
    "now , if @xmath17 and @xmath18 is a copula then we prove that @xmath19 coincides with a generalized shuffle of @xmath18 in the sense of durante et al .",
    "we also give similar characterizations of shuffles of @xmath18 and generalized shuffles of min .",
    "these characterizations have advantages of simplicity in calculations because it avoids using induced measures .",
    "then we use this relationship to obtain a simple proof of a characterization of copulas whose orbit is singleton ( theorem 10 in @xcite ) .",
    "note that there are many examples where shuffles of @xmath18 , i.e.  @xmath19 or @xmath20 , do not have the same sobolev norm as @xmath18 .",
    "however , we show that multiplication by unit norm copulas preserves independence , complete dependence and mutual complete dependence . since left- and right - multiplying a copula @xmath21 by unit norm copulas amount to `` shuffling '' or `` permuting '' @xmath1 and @xmath2 respectively , we introduce a new norm , called the @xmath0-norm , which is invariant under multiplication by a unit norm copula .",
    "mutual complete dependence copulas still has @xmath0-norm one .",
    "this invariant property implies that complete dependence copulas also possess unit @xmath0-norm .",
    "based on the @xmath0-norm , a new measure of dependence is defined in the same spirit as the definition by siburg et al .",
    "it turns out that this new measure of dependence satisfies most of the seven postulates proposed by rnyi @xcite .",
    "the only known measure of dependence that satisfies all rnyi s postulates is the maximal correlation coefficient .",
    "this manuscript is structured as follows .",
    "we shall summarize related basic properties of copulas , the binary operator @xmath0 and the sobolev norm in section 2 .",
    "then we obtain a characterization of copulas with unit sobolev norm which implies that the @xmath0-product of mcd copulas is a mcd copula in section 3 .",
    "section 4 contains our characterizations of generalized shuffles of min and ( generalized ) shuffles of copulas in the sense of durante et al .  in terms of the @xmath0-product .",
    "we then show that shuffling a copula preserves independence , complete dependence and mutual complete dependence . in section 5 ,",
    "a new norm is introduced and its properties are proved . and in section 6 , we define a new measure of dependence and verify that it satisfies most of rnyi s postulates .",

    "<S> using a characterization of mutual complete dependence copulas , we show that , with respect to the sobolev norm , the mcd copulas can be approximated arbitrarily closed by shuffles of min . </S>",
    "<S> this result is then used to obtain a characterization of generalized shuffles of copulas introduced by durante , sarkoci and sempi in terms of mcd copulas and the @xmath0-product discovered by darsow , nguyen and olsen . </S>",
    "<S> since shuffles of a copula is the copula of the corresponding shuffles of the two continuous random variables , we define a new norm which is invariant under shuffling . </S>",
    "<S> this norm gives rise to a new measure of dependence which shares many properties with the maximal correlation coefficient , the only measure of dependence that satisfies all of rnyi s postulates .    </S>",
