    "<S> introduction *    the operation of many micro electromechanical systems ( mems ) relies upon the action of electrostatic forces . </S>",
    "<S> many such devices , including pumps , switches or valves , can be modelled by electrostatically deflected elastic membranes . </S>",
    "<S> typically a mems device consists of an elastic membrane held at a constant voltage and suspended above a rigid ground plate placed in series with a fixed voltage source . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage difference causes a deflection of the membrane , which in turn generates an electric field in the region between the plate and the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> mathematically , this is then a free boundary problem . </S>",
    "<S> the electric potential is defined in a region which depends on the membrane deflection , while the elastic deformation is forced by the trace of the electric field on the membrane .    </S>",
    "<S> an important nonlinear phenomenon in electrostatically deflected membranes is the so - called `` pull - in '' instability . for moderate voltages </S>",
    "<S> the system is in the stable operation regime : the membrane approaches a steady state and remains separate from the ground plate . when the voltage is increased beyond a critical value , there is no longer an equilibrium configuration of the membrane . as a result , </S>",
    "<S> the membrane collapses onto the ground plate . </S>",
    "<S> this phenomenon is also known as `` touchdown '' . </S>",
    "<S> the critical value of the voltage required for touchdown to occur is termed the _ pull - in value_. the determination of the pull - in value is important for the design and manufacture of mems devices , particularly as touchdown is a desirable property in devices such as microvalves . for instance , desai _ et al _ @xcite give a description of microvalves used in microfluidic chips . </S>",
    "<S> however , for most devices , it is desirable to achieve the stable operation regime with no touchdown . </S>",
    "<S> the _ pull - in distance _ is the critical distance between the ground plate and the elastic membrane beyond which pull - in occurs .    </S>",
    "<S> the issue of the static and dynamical pull - in instabilities has been addressed by the engineering community in the context of a model in which the moving structure is a plate attached to a spring with damping . </S>",
    "<S> the elastic properties of the moving plate are described by the restoring force of the spring , which is assumed to be given by hooke s law . </S>",
    "<S> the voltage applied to the moving plate results in an electrostatic force acting on the spring - mass system , see rocha _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite and zhang _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite for details . </S>",
    "<S> the governing equation for the displacement of the moving mass is @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the initial gap between the plates , @xmath2 , @xmath3 is the area of the moving plate , @xmath4 is the voltage applied to it and @xmath5 is the permitivity of the free space between the plates . the right hand side is the coulomb force .    </S>",
    "<S> zhang _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite described the dynamical pull - in as the collapse of the moving structure towards the substrate due to the combined action of kinetic and potential energies . </S>",
    "<S> they also stated that , in general , * dynamical pull - in requires a lower voltage to be triggered compared to the static pull - in threshold*. one of the findings in rocha _ </S>",
    "<S> et al .  _ </S>",
    "<S> @xcite is the fact that for an overdamped device , the dynamics in the touchdown regime has three distinguished regions characterized by different time scales : in the first region the structure moves fast until it gets near the static pull - in distance , at which point there is a metastable region in which the motion is very slow , and finally a third region in which collapse takes place on a fast time scale .    in the present work we study </S>",
    "<S> the equations obtained when the deflection of the elastic membrane is governed by a forced , damped wave equation . </S>",
    "<S> we also study the forced heat equation which corresponds to setting the inertia equal to zero . for simplicity , we assume that the motion starts from rest . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results indicate that for the forced heat equation , the dynamical pull - in value coincides with the static value . </S>",
    "<S> this result is supported by the fact that the membrane profiles decrease monotonically in time and approach a steady state in the stable operation regime , which suggests that there is a maximum principle and that the stationary solutions act as a barrier to prevent touchdown . </S>",
    "<S> this is exactly the situation in the limit of vanishing aspect ratio . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , the dynamical pull - in value for the damped wave equation is smaller than the static value , in agreement with the observation in @xcite for equation ( [ e : spring ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> we also obtain the different time scales in the dynamics of touchdown as reported in @xcite for equation ( [ e : spring ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> our results then indicate that the difference between the dynamical and static pull - in values is due to the inertial forces . </S>",
    "<S> on the other hand , our calculations show that the aspect ratio is more important than the inertia in the determination of the dynamical pull - in value .    here </S>",
    "<S> we study the following free - boundary problem . </S>",

    "<S> the control parameter @xmath12 is proportional to the square of the applied voltage , @xmath13 is the ratio of the gap size to the device length and @xmath14 is the ratio of inertial to damping forces . for a derivation of these equations see pelesko and bernstein @xcite .    in the formulation above </S>",
    "<S> there are other effects which have not been included . </S>",
    "<S> one is the effect of the electric field at the edge of the membrane , known as _ </S>",
    "<S> fringing fields_. in addition , the elastic energy in the present model does not include the curvature of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> pelesko and driscoll @xcite gave a derivation of the governing equation when the fringing field is taken into account . </S>",
    "<S> the boundary value problem for the electric potential ( [ e : poteqn])([e : bc ] ) is then solved for @xmath15 with a boundary layer correction around the edge of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> brubaker and pelesko @xcite studied the case in which the elastic energy includes the curvature of the membrane . </S>",
    "<S> the electric potential is obtained for @xmath16 .    </S>",
    "<S> the small aspect ratio limiting case corresponding to @xmath16 has been studied extensively . in this case , </S>",
    "<S> the boundary value problem ( [ e : poteqn ] ) and ( [ e : bc ] ) for the electric potential can be solved explicitly to give @xmath17 equation ( [ e : mem ] ) for the elastic deformation then reduces to a nonlinear wave equation , termed the small aspect ratio model @xmath18 the further limiting case with @xmath19 is a nonlinear heat equation for which the dynamical pull - in value coincides with the critical value @xmath20 for the existence of stationary solutions of ( [ e : aspect ] ) . </S>",
    "<S> indeed , there are two , one or zero stationary solutions of ( [ e : aspect ] ) according to whether @xmath21 , @xmath22 or @xmath23 . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , solutions of the nonlinear heat equation corresponding to @xmath24 converge to a steady state , while solutions corresponding to @xmath23 quench in finite time . </S>",
    "<S> the proof of this behaviour relies on the maximum principle , see flores _ et al _ @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the same behaviour is obtained when the effect of fringing fields is taken into account . according to pelesko and driscoll @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> equation ( [ e : aspect ] ) is modified as follows . </S>",
    "<S> the numerator on the right hand side becomes @xmath25 . </S>",
    "<S> for stationary solutions , lindsay and ward @xcite have established that the pull - in value @xmath26 admits an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath27 and obtained the leading order term , which in the one - dimensional case corresponds to the critical value @xmath20 mentioned in the previous paragraph . </S>",
    "<S> wei and ye @xcite have described the structure of the stationary solutions for this problem . </S>",
    "<S> there is a critical value of @xmath12 such that there are at least two solutions , one or none according to whether @xmath12 is smaller , equal to , or larger than this critical value . </S>",
    "<S> liu and wang @xcite verified that for the corresponding heat equation , the dynamical critical parameter coincides with the static critical value . </S>",
    "<S> the stationary solution thus acts as a barrier and prevents touchdown . </S>",
    "<S> the rule is that the static and dynamical pull - in values coincide whenever there is a maximum principle .    on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , the numerical evidence for the case @xmath28 indicates that for the damped wave equation ( [ e : aspect ] ) there is a threshold , which we denote by @xmath29 , that separates the stable operation regime from the touchdown regime . </S>",
    "<S> this means that solutions of ( [ e : aspect ] ) converge to a steady state for @xmath30 , while for @xmath31 solutions quench in finite time . </S>",
    "<S> this critical value of @xmath12 is what we call the _ dynamical pull - in value_. moreover , @xmath32 , see flores @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar numerical results concerning the dynamical threshold were obtained for conservative wave equations with a singular forcing term in one dimension by chang and levine @xcite and in higher dimensions by smith @xcite . in the same context , </S>",
    "<S> kavallaris _ et al _ @xcite numerically found the existence of a dynamical threshold , smaller than the static value , in a one dimensional , non - local version of the equation considered in @xcite for which the mems device is connected in series with a capacitor .    </S>",

    "<S> the plates were separated by a distance @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> the critical voltage was computed for different values of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> an empirical relation was then used to determine the critical value of @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> these values were compared with either upper and lower bounds or with numerically computed values of @xmath20 for elliptical or rectangular domains . </S>",
    "<S> good agreement was found for small values of @xmath33 . </S>",
    "<S> it was found that the experimental values were smaller than the numerically calculated values . </S>",
    "<S> the interpretation of this is that the experimental values correspond to the dynamical critical value of @xmath12 . in siddique _ </S>",

    "<S> @xcite a question is raised so as to identify the most important effect which accounts for the difference between the theoretical and the experimental results . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results of the present work indicate that the aspect ratio of the device is more important than the inertial effects . </S>",
    "<S> another part of the explanation is that the static and dynamical pull - in values are different .    the static free boundary problem and the associated semilinear parabolic equation in one space dimension governing it have been analyzed by laurenot _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite and by escher _ </S>",

    "<S> these are the only rigorous results to date for the free boundary problem . as mentioned in laurenot _ </S>",
    "<S> et al _ @xcite , no further information is available on the structure of the set of values of @xmath12 for which there is a classical stationary solution of the free boundary problem . </S>",
    "<S> it is believed that this set is an interval . in the present work , by computing the bifurcation curve we provide numerical evidence that this is indeed the case . </S>",
    "<S> the shape of the bifurcation curve for the steady states is qualitatively similar to the corresponding curve for the small aspect ratio limit corresponding to @xmath16 , which suggests the existence of a critical value @xmath26 for a steady state to exist . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results also indicate that @xmath37 as @xmath38 .    </S>",
    "<S> we also provide numerical evidence which shows that this static critical value @xmath26 coincides with the dynamical pull - in value for the nonlinear heat equation . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , for the damped wave equation it does not control the dynamics since the dynamic pull - in value is smaller than the static critical value , even in the limiting case @xmath16 . therefore , the difference between the dynamic and static critical values is due to the inertial forces . </S>",
    "<S> we also find that the aspect ratio @xmath13 is more important than the inertia coefficient @xmath14 in the determination of the dynamical pull - in value . </S>"
