    "considerable experimental progress in various physical systems has been achieved toward the goal of controlling the dynamics of open quantum systems and their interactions with the environment  @xcite . for quantum computations or digital coherent quantum simulations ,",
    "one may wish to have a system that is well isolated from the environment . for dissipative variants of quantum computations  @xcite or creating new scenarios for non - equilibrium many - body systems , one would need to engineer the coupling to the environment .",
    "recently , a setting in which the quantum system of interest interacts at its boundaries with an external quantum probe such that their coupling can be localized and can be switched on and off repeatedly with a controlled and well - defined state for the probe prior to the interaction has been experimentally realized  @xcite . this repeated interaction scheme has also been theoretically studied  @xcite .",
    "importantly , the dynamics in an appropriate limit is a boundary - driven lindblad equation . in this article",
    ", we explore the question of what is the thermodynamic cost of having such operations on an open quantum system and what are the thermodynamical quantities , such as heat and work that will determine the efficiency of quantum engines operating in this manner .",
    "boundary - driven lindblad equations have been intensively studied theoretically , particularly for one - dimensional quantum chains  @xcite , and powerful techniques have been developed to find their non - equilibrium steady states ( ness )  @xcite .",
    "these equations are also frequently used to describe quantum engines  @xcite and other complex open quantum systems coupled to one or several environments  @xcite because they are easy to implement .",
    "nevertheless , a boundary driven lindblad equation does not correctly describe a quantum system passively and weakly coupled to a heat - bath as often occurs in natural systems .",
    "it was pointed out recently  @xcite that inconsistencies with the second law of thermodynamics may arise in this case and a careful examination of the coupling between a quantum refrigerator and the heat - baths  @xcite reveals why boundary driven models are inappropriate for these situations . for a system passively and weakly coupled to one or several heat - baths the master equation derived in the born - markov - secular approximation  @xcite yields a proper description of the system and the correct balance of heat flows and irreversible entropy production .",
    "thus , for our study , we consider explicitly the active ( time - dependent ) type of interaction between the system and the environment implemented in  @xcite and the model developed in  @xcite .",
    "we apply the results of  @xcite to derive the appropriate thermodynamical quantities and , in particular , we focus in the limit where the system is described by a boundary driven lindblad equation .",
    "our main result is that driving at the boundaries , even though it looks like a work - free operation , actually might bring work to the system .",
    "we illustrate our findings on boundary - driven spin 1/2 chains coupled to one or two heat baths .",
    "we show that an xx spin 1/2 chain coupled in this way to a single heat bath relaxes to thermodynamic equilibrium while an xy does not because it is driven out of equilibrium by the power produced by the coupling to the heat bath .",
    "when two baths are connected to the chain , we observe that for different parameters , the chain operates as a quantum heat engine , refrigerator or heater , and we determine their efficiencies in the simple case of a chain of two sites .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows .",
    "we start by reviewing first the thermodynamics of markovian open quantum systems in the weak coupling limit  @xcite and second a formulation  @xcite where the  universe \" , system plus the environment , evolves unitarily .",
    "after that , we consider the repeated interaction scenario for the system and the environment from which the boundary - driven lindblad equation and the appropriate thermodynamical quantities for the open system are obtained",
    ". then we illustrate our results in xx and xy spin 1/2 chains and offer our conclusions .",
    "finally we have collected in section methods some details of the calculations .",
    "let us briefly review the usual formulation of thermodynamics in open quantum systems @xcite . consider an open system described by a master equation in the lindblad form @xmath0+\\sum_r{\\mathcal d}_r ( \\rho_s ) \\label{lind}\\ ] ] where the environment consists of several heat - baths @xmath1 whose action on the system is represented by the dissipator @xmath2 with @xmath3 $ ] the commutator and @xmath4 the anti - commutator .",
    "the operators @xmath5 are system operators and represent the action of the environment over the system .",

    "lindblad operators @xmath5 that are eigen - operator of the hamiltonian @xmath6  @xcite . for simplicity",
    ", we consider that the system can only exchange energy and no particles with the environment .    now consider the internal energy @xmath7 and the entropy @xmath8 .",

    "passively and weakly coupled to the heat - baths , these quantities are defined as @xmath12,\\quad\\dot q_r(t)={\\rm tr}[h_s(t){\\mathcal d}_r(\\rho_s(t ) ) ] .",

    "the system will typically reach a steady state .",
    "consider now this to be the situation .",
    "the second law states the positivity of the entropy production ( @xmath13 ) , which is the difference between the time - derivative of the entropy @xmath14 and the entropy flow from the environment to the system @xmath15 , @xmath16 the canonical distribution @xmath17 appears in the last equality of eq.([eprod0 ] ) due to the definition of heat that we plug in the first equality in eq.([eprod0 ] ) . the second law @xmath18 in eq.([eprod0 ] )",
    "holds if for every @xmath1 , @xmath19+{\\mathcal d}_r ( \\rho_s)$ ] relaxes towards the unique equilibrium state @xmath20 .",
    "this is the local - detailed - balance condition  @xcite i.e. if a single heat - bath is in contact with the system detailed balance as defined in  @xcite holds .",
    "this property of the dissipators @xmath21 is satisfied in quantum master equations obtained in the weak - coupling and with the born - markov - secular approximation ( global lindblad equation ) .",

    "the lindblad operators @xmath5 act locally on the boundaries of the system and in general the corresponding lindblad equation does not satisfy local - detailed - balance .",
    "we come back to this point later . following recent developments in the physics of non - equilibrium systems that have emphasized the importance of time reversal symmetry at the microscopic level of description  @xcite ,",

    "unitarity , expressed through the invariance of @xmath42 under the time evolution of the full system , plays a crucial role in the splitting of entropy change in the entropy flow and a positive entropy production . in the weak - coupling limit @xmath43 and assuming that the open system satisfies a lindblad equation obtained from the born - markov - secular approximation  @xcite , the rate of entropy production @xmath44 and the above expressions for work and heat take the standard form given in eq.([eprod0 ] ) and eq.([wqwcl ] ) respectively .",
    "this is shown in section methods by considering the method of full - counting statistics  @xcite .",
    "however , the lindblad models investigated in  @xcite are not obtained from the weak - coupling limit and do not satisfy local - detailed - balance .",

    "for inhomogeneous magnetic fields , the chain reaches a driven @xmath182 ness . jumping to a broader context",
    ", this work shows that the knowledge of a lindblad equation for an open system does not determine the heat flows or other thermodynamical quantities .",
    "these quantities also depend on the properties of the environment and how the system is coupled to it . here , we have obtained appropriate expressions for heat flows and power for interactions with an environment of a type recently implemented in a laboratory  @xcite .",

    "<S> the laws of thermodynamics put limits to the efficiencies of thermal machines . </S>",
    "<S> analogues of these laws are now established for quantum engines weakly and passively coupled to the environment providing a framework to find improvements to their performance . </S>",
    "<S> systems whose interaction with the environment is actively controlled do not fall in that framework . here </S>",
    "<S> we consider systems actively and locally coupled to the environment , evolving with a so - called boundary - driven lindblad equation . starting from a unitary description of the system plus the environment </S>",
    "<S> we simultaneously obtain the lindblad equation and the appropriate expressions for heat , work and entropy - production of the system extending the framework for the analysis of new , and some already proposed , quantum heat engines . </S>",
    "<S> we illustrate our findings in spin 1/2 chains and explain why an xx chain coupled in this way to a single heat bath relaxes to thermodynamic - equilibrium while and xy chain does not . </S>",
    "<S> additionally , we show that an xx chain coupled to a left and a right heat baths behaves as a quantum engine , a heater or refrigerator depending on the parameters , with efficiencies bounded by carnot efficiencies . </S>"
