    "we present the invited lectures given at the second asia - europe - pacific school of high - energy physics ( aepshep ) , which took place in puri , india in november 2014 .",
    "the physics background of students attending the school are diverse as some of them were doing their phd studies in experimental particle physics , others in theoretical particle physics .",
    "the lectures were planned and organized , such that students from different background can still get benefit from basic topics of broad interest in a modern way , trying to explain otherwise complicated concepts necessary to know for understanding the current ongoing researches in the field , in a relatively simple language from first principles .",
    "these notes present a small compilation of several results that over the years has become standard in particle physics , and more concretely in the area of flavour physics .",
    "these are by no means a complete and self - contained course in flavour physics , but rather a brief introduction to several topics that should be explored in more detail by additional references for the interested readers . for the topics addressed in these notes",
    "there are several textbooks and review articles that have become standard references ; here we compile an incomplete list :    * for aspects concerning the building blocks of gauge theories and the standard model see , for example ,  @xcite * for @xmath0 and flavour aspects in particle physics the books  @xcite are two excellent sources , as well as the more specific reviews  @xcite * for topics related with effective field theories we refer the reader to  @xcite",
    "in particle physics one attributes quantum numbers to particles in order to classify them as representations of the symmetries describing the dynamics of the underlying model . this classification allows us to extract a lot of information just from first principles . in nature",
    "there are several copies of the same fermionic gauge representation , i.e. several fields that are assigned the same quantum numbers .",
    "we then say that different copies belong to different flavours ( or families ) .",
    "flavour physics describes the interactions that distinguish between flavours , i.e. between the different copies .",
    "the fermions can interact through pure gauge interactions .",
    "these interaction are related to the unbroken symmetries and mediated therefore by massless gauge bosons .",
    "they do not distinguish among the flavours and do not constitute part of flavour physics .",
    "fermions can also have yukawa interactions , i.e. interactions where two fermions couple to a scalar .",
    "these interactions are source of flavour and @xmath0 violation . within the standard model ( sm )",
    ", flavour physics refers to the weak and yukawa interactions .",
    "flavour physics can predict new physics ( np ) before it s directly observed .",
    "some examples are :    * the smallness of @xmath1 allowed for the prediction of the charm quark * the size of @xmath2 allowed for the charm mass prediction * the measurement of @xmath3 allowed for the prediction of the third generation * the size of @xmath4 allowed for a quite accurate top mass prediction @xmath5 * the measurement of neutrino flavour transitions led to the discovery of neutrino masses      in this section we present the discrete symmetries @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 , which play a leading role in the construction of the present model of particle physics .",
    "these three symmetries do not leave , separately , the sm lagrangian invariant but their product @xmath9 does ( at least everything points on that direction ) .",
    "these discrete symmetries give rise to multiplicative conservation laws .",
    "they have three levels of action : on the particle states , on the creation and annihilation operators , and on the fields .",
    "the action on one level determines the action on the other two .",
    "the main properties of these symmetries are :    * * charge conjugation * + charge conjugation on the states reverses the quantum numbers of particles that are associated with internal symmetries .",
    "the charge conjugate of a particle is another particle with the same energy and momentum but opposite charges ( anti - particle ) .",
    "charge conjugation on the fields converts a field @xmath10 into a field @xmath11 with opposite internal quantum numbers .",
    "if charge conjugation is a symmetry of the quantum field theory , there must exist a unitary operator @xmath12 which represents it .",
    "+ we can use charge conjugation in order to eliminate final states for scattering and decay processes and to provide a link between different processes involving charged particles . * * parity * + classical parity is any element in the component of the lorentz group that contains the matrix @xmath13 .",
    "parity , like charge conjugation , gives rise to a multiplicative conservation law .",
    "for example , the @xmath14 meson and the pions are pseudoscalars ( eigenstates with eigenvalue @xmath15 as opposed \" @xmath16 for scars ) , and so the decay @xmath17 is forbidden by conservation of parity .",
    "however , since parity transforms space , the eigenvalues of parity depend on the orbital angular momentum of a state and the intrinsic parity of a state is not in general conserved . *",
    "* time reversal * + the idea of time reversal is to take the time evolution of some system and reverse it . to separate the effects of charge conjugation from those of time reversal ,",
    "it is customary to assume that time reversal preserves the internal quantum numbers of all particles . in classical mechanics ,",
    "time reversal can be implemented by changing the sign of the hamiltonian .",
    "if we suppose that this effect is achieved in quantum theory by a unitary transformation @xmath18 , we get @xmath19 for any state @xmath20 , entering in conflict with the principle that energy should be bounded from below . the way to solve",
    "this is by dropping the unitary operator and represent time reversal by an anti - unitary operator operator @xmath21 .",
    "[ tab : cptfields][tab : discrete ] summarize some of the most important transformations under these symmetries .",
    "l * fields transformations * + @xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 +   + @xmath25 @xmath26 +    .symmetry transformation properties of some fermionic bilinears under the action of discrete symmetries .",
    "overall phases and the coordinates have been omitted . [",
    "cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     the basic building blocks of fcnc operators are @xmath27 expanding in powers of the off - diagonal @xmath28 matrix elements and in powers of the small yukawa couplings , such as @xmath29 the mfv framework is general and can be implemented in a given bsm scenario , e.g. susy and composite higgs models , resulting in reducing the cutoff scale ( flavour bound ) from @xmath30 tev to @xmath31 tev , which in turn makes it a very predictive theory framework .",
    "compared to sm , only the flavour - independent magnitude of the transition amplitudes can be modified .",
    "a fingerprint of this framework is the prediction @xmath32 , which can be identified by experiments .",
    "partial compositeness is a completely different way of flavour protection mechanism  @xcite .",
    "the idea is to generate quark and lepton masses through linear couplings of the standard model fields to composite operators , i.e. @xmath33 where @xmath34 are known as pre - yukawa couplings and @xmath35 are fermionic operators arising from the strong sector .",
    "the nice aspect of this linear coupling is that no relevant operator can be built out of @xmath35 , since both have a classical mass dimension of @xmath36 .",
    "also , the quadratic operators @xmath37 , @xmath38 vanish due to spinor identities and @xmath39 is forbidden by gauge invariance .",
    "therefore , the lowest - dimension operators on can build out of the composite operators are @xmath40 and @xmath41 , which have classical dimension six and therefore irrelevant .",
    "the physical light fermions will then be a mixture of both elementary and composite states , known as partial compositeness , @xmath42 the flavour problem in theories with strong dynamics can be improved if partial compositeness is implemented .",
    "@xmath43    partial compositeness provide partial solutions to both flavour and hierarchy puzzles .",
    "still , this is a partial solution since from the kaon system @xmath3 and @xmath44 one still needs some sort of alignment , at least in the down sector . on the other hand , in this framework we can have a naturally sizable non - standard contribution to @xmath45 .",
    "this approach can be an alternative to mfv .",
    "rare decays based on the flavour transition @xmath46 have for some time call the attention of the flavour community , as they can be sensitive probes of new physics  @xcite :    * * hadronic : * @xmath47 * * radiative : * @xmath48 * * semi - leptonic : * @xmath49 * * leptonic : * @xmath50 * * neutrino : * @xmath51    the most relevant ones in order to constrain new physics in the lhc era are the leptonic , semi - leptonic and radiative exclusive decays .",
    "recently , the lhcb collaboration observed an excess in @xmath52 decay  @xcite by measuring the angular observables with a minimal sensitivity to the choice of form factors  @xcite .",
    "this tension can be soften by the presence of new physics .",
    "one useful way to search for new physics that could induce these deviations is to look at the effective hamiltonian relevant for this transition .",
    "from the complete list presented in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , the current - current , qcd penguin and electroweak penguin operators ar typically dominated by the sm contribution at low energies and will only contribute to the considered observables though mixing with the dominant operators .",
    "this effect is therefore small .",
    "the chromomagnetic dipole operators , for leptonic and semi - leptonic decays enter only through mixing .",
    "tensor operator do not appear in @xmath53 operator expansion the the sm .",
    "having this information we can write the relevant effective hamiltonian @xmath54 with @xmath55 the fine structure constant and the operators considered are @xmath56 the operators @xmath57 have been listed before , they are just written in the @xmath58 notation instead of @xmath59 one .",
    "the scalar and pseudo - scalar operators were also added , even though their impact is small in the observables .",
    "the prime operators are not present in the sm expansion , they therefore correspond always to new physics effects .    the presence of new physics in the relevant observables can be tracked to the corresponding operators :    * @xmath60:@xmath61 * @xmath52:@xmath61 * @xmath62:@xmath63 * @xmath64:@xmath65 * lepton - nonuniversality : @xmath66 * @xmath67 : @xmath68    in @xmath60 , @xmath52 , and @xmath64 the form factors and contributions of the hadronic weak hamiltonian are the main theoretical challenges .",
    "direct @xmath0 asymmetries in @xmath69 decays can give a hint of new physics , specially in @xmath62 since the @xmath69 factories measurements and lhcb are so precise .",
    "however , new physics in this observable is proportional to the strong phase that appears as a sub - leading effect and is also plagued with many uncertainties .",
    "several global fits have been done  @xcite , under the assumption of new physics entering only through one operator or two real wilson coefficients .",
    "these analysis tend to favour values @xmath70 in order to accommodate the recent anomalies .",
    "new physics entering through @xmath71 can also contribute to the meson mixing .",
    "@xmath72-mixing is in general the most constraining observable .",
    "lepton - nouniversility is also a power probe of new physics . in the sm",
    "the process @xmath73 is lepton flavour universal .",
    "however , beyond the sm new flavour violating interactions can give substantial deviation form lepton - universality .",
    "ratios of branching fractions , as well as double ratios can serve as a clean probe of new physics  @xcite .",
    "a big advantage of considering ratios is the automatic cancelling of several uncertainties .",
    "recently , the lhcb collaborations has reported  @xcite @xmath74 which shows a @xmath75 deviation form the sm prediction @xmath76  @xcite , in the dilepton invariant mass squared bin @xmath77 .",
    "the branching fractions rations of rare semi - leptonic @xmath69 decays of dimuons over dielectrons arge given by  @xcite @xmath78 while the double ratios are defined as @xmath79 with @xmath80 the new physics contribution from the interference with the sm , and @xmath81 the pure new physics contribution . at the @xmath82 scale we have for the sm wilson",
    "coefficients @xmath83 .",
    "the factor @xmath84 is the polarization faction and is close to 1 ( it is exactly 1 at zero recoil ) .",
    "these expression are valid to a very good accuracy given the current experimental uncertainties .",
    "the double ratios are very useful tool for precision tests new physics .",
    "they are only sensitive to new physics coupled to right - handed quarks , and therefore can be seen as complementary to @xmath85 .",
    "another clean probe of new physics in the @xmath69 sector are the leptonic decays @xmath86 .",
    "the model independent average time - integrated branching ratio for @xmath87 decays is  @xcite @xmath88 with @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "the current reported experimental value for @xmath92 decays is  @xcite @xmath93 being a purely leptonic final state , the theoretical prediction of these processes is very clean and serves as a good probe for np .",
    "we have presented a short overview in the topics of flavour and @xmath0 violation in and beyond the sm .",
    "the most relevant aspects can be summarized as :    * often we have seen the indirect evidence of new particles in flavour physics before directly discovering them ; * the sm flavour sector has been tested with impressive and increasing precision ; * in the sm , fermions come in 3 generations of quarks and leptons ; flavour physics is all about them ; * all flavour violation in the sm is from the ckm matrix ; * cpv in sm is small , and comes from flavour ; * we have developed non relativistic qm tools for meson mixing ; * we have schematically shown how to calculate hadronic observables ; * theoretical tools to understand the underlying physics is important .",
    "for example , effective field theory allows separation of different scales ( separation of calculable parts and nonperturbative parts ) ; * any sensitivity to high scales ( including to physics beyond the standard model ) can be treated using perturbative methods ; * flavour structure of new physics has to be special in order to be compatible with tev scale new physics .",
    "a popular example is mfv , but other possibilities exist such a partial compositeness , etc ; * if new particles discovered , their flavour properties can teach us about the underlying structure of new physics : masses ( degeneracies ) , decay rates ( flavour decomposition ) , cross sections ; * flavour physics provide important clues to model building in the lhc era ; * lhc era is also a flavour precision era , and a lot of interesting measurements are coming , as we have already seen some tensions with sm .",
    "we wish to thank monika blanke for useful suggestions while preparing the lectures .",
    "we would like to also thank all the organisers of the second aepshep school for the very warm hospitality extended to us and for the very nice atmosphere in the school .",
