    "polarimetry has become an essential part of back - end instrumentation of modern solar telescopes .",
    "high precision polarization measurements are essential to infer the magnetic field information on the sun . for ground based observations ,",
    "the presence of atmospheric turbulence , commonly known as seeing , is one of the major limiting factors in achieving high precision in polarization measurements .",
    "a polarization state , which is the result of the phase difference between the orthogonal components of the electric field vector in the light beam , is not directly detectable by photo - detectors .",
    "hence the polarization information is converted into intensity by modulating the light in a known way .",
    "depending on the modulation scheme several intensity measurements are required , with a minimum of four , in order to recover the complete polarization information ( i.e. the four stokes parameters )",
    ". often these measurements are obtained at successive intervals making the polarization measurement a non simultaneous process .",
    "rapid changes in seeing conditions can therefore produce spurious polarization signals in polarimetric data .",
    "a fourier transformation based formalism has been developed by lites @xcite to analyze seeing induced cross - talk .",
    "he considered to analyze the cross - talk terms caused only by the seeing induced image motion ( tip - tilt terms ) .",
    "he finds that the cross - talk terms can be reduced considerably by increasing the modulation frequency .",
    "this initial work by lites was revised and extended by judge et al .",
    "@xcite to study the effect of residual image motion after a partial correction of the tip - tilt terms by an ao system .",
    "in addition to the rotating - waveplate modulation scheme , originally studied by lites , they also consider a discrete modulation scheme based on liquid crystal variable modulators .",
    "the studies of judge et al . suggest that with an increase in the degree of image aberration corrections , one can achieve a reduction in seeing induced cross - talk .",
    "this means that if a polarimeter is used in conjunction with an ao system , a significant reduction in seeing induced polarization is expected .",
    "however , in their work the effect of higher order aberration terms is not taken into account .",
    "initial results on the effect of higher order aberration terms have been obtained by nagaraju et al .",
    "@xcite through a numerical simulation . in that study",
    "the analysis is done for a 4  m diameter telescope with only a limited number of higher order terms compensated . however , our aim is to assess seeing induced cross - talk in the case when ao performance is close to the diffraction limit . to accomplish the diffraction limited performance of ao ,",
    "the number of terms compensated is much beyond the practical limit because of the asymptotic way the diffraction limit is achieved ( cf .",
    "section [ sec : imaging ] ) . in order to characterize the phase screens and images after ao corrections close to the diffraction limit ,",
    "in a statistically consistent way , for the case of a 4  m aperture telescope the simulation becomes computationally expensive .",
    "hence we opted to carry out the simulation for a 1  m aperture telescope in this work with ao performance close to the diffraction limit .",
    "the computational resources required are multifold less for a 1  m than for a 4  m aperture telescope .",
    "another reason for choosing 1  m aperture telescope is that the results presented in this paper could possibly be verified through actual measurements using one of the currently operating 1  m class telescopes .",
    "turbulence in earth s atmosphere produces inhomogeneity in the refractive index .",
    "this causes fluctuations in the phase of the light wave across the telescope aperture , known as phase screen . as a result ,",
    "when the imaging is done through the atmosphere , image quality is severely degraded .",
    "the amount of image degradation increases with increase in ratio of the aperture diameter ( @xmath0 ) to the fried parameter @xmath1 . in order to achieve higher image quality , in other words to achieve a spatial resolution closer to the diffraction limit",
    ", most modern solar telescopes are equipped with an ao system .",
    "an ao system corrects for a number of lowest order zernike or karhunen - love modes ( see e. g. , roddier @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "our aim is to understand seeing induced cross - talk among stokes parameters in the context of an ao system working with a telescope .",
    "the steps involved in the numerical simulation are as follows .",
    "time dependent phase screens above the telescope of 1  m diameter are generated .",
    "then synthetic stokes images are convolved with the time dependent point spread functions ( psfs ) corresponding to the phase screens .",
    "the resulting time series of convolved stokes images is then polarimetrically analyzed using a chosen modulation scheme . in the following we discuss these steps in detail .",
    "we use the power spectral method to generate phase screens ( mcglamery @xcite ) . in this section",
    "we briefly describe the method . more details can be found in @xcite .",
    "the kolmogorov power spectrum is given by @xmath2 where @xmath3 is fried parameter in meters and @xmath4 is 2-d spatial frequency vector .",
    "the above expression can be written in discrete form @xcite as @xmath5 with @xmath6-integer array indices , @xmath7size of the square array and @xmath8pupil sampling in meters per pixel .",
    "the magnitude of the fourier spectrum of phase screen is given by @xmath9 the fourier transform of the product of magnitude of the fourier spectrum in eq .",

    "the simulation parameters are compiled in table 1 . , scaledwidth=70.0% ]    time evolution of phase screens above the telescope aperture is assumed to be produced by wind driven propagation of frozen in turbulence @xcite . in the simulation",
    "this is achieved by generating a large phase screen several times bigger than the aperture size and shifting it across the telescope aperture with constant speed .",
    "wind effect is introduced by adding a phase in the fourier spectrum i.e. @xmath10 where @xmath11 are the number of pixels to be shifted .",

    "[ eq : powspecdiscrt ] for a description of the other parameters . [ cols=\"^,^,^ \" , ]     we would like to note here that the phase screens clipped to 1  m aperture do not exactly show kolmogorov power law behavior .",
    "the decrease in their power with frequency is slower than the kolmogorov power .",
    "as pointed out by @xcite , this is due to the fact that the convolution of the kolmogorov power spectrum with the power spectrum of the telescope aperture results in a power law between @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "secondly , for the large phase screen the piston term ( zero frequency ) is set to zero .",
    "since the clipping of the phase screens changes the zero frequency , it is reset to zero as well , for all phase screens . further , we did not consider to include subharmonics in our simulation , as it is usually done to account for underestimation of lower order terms ( mainly the tip / tilt terms ) when the power spectral method is used to simulate phase screens @xcite .",
    "this is because our interest in this work is to study the effect of higher order terms .",
    "seeing induces cross - talk among stokes parameters through randomly spreading information , temporally and spatially , of one detector pixel to the other .",
    "hence the amount of cross - talk induced also depends on the structuring of stokes intensities on the sun .",
    "this fact is taken into account in lites formalism by taking the cross - talk term proportional to the stokes intensity gradient .",
    "hence the comprehensive assessment of image formation affected by the seeing induced optical aberrations and after ao correction is very important to understand seeing induced cross - talk .",
    "imaging through earth s atmosphere by a telescope is simulated by convolving the synthetic stokes images with the psfs derived from the corresponding phase screens above the telescope aperture .",

    ", the synthetic stokes images are subjected to apodization in order to avoid the ringing effect which is produced in the fourier spectrum due to the sharp edges present in the synthetic stokes images .",
    "increase in the number of zernike terms compensated brings the convolved images closer to the diffraction limited image . for the fried parameter considered in the simulation ( cf .",
    "table 1 ) , with 30 terms compensated the structures in the convolved image already look very close to the structures in the diffraction limited image , although the contrast is still considerably lower ( 60% of the diffraction limited value ) .",
    "the strehl - ratio ( sr ) of the corresponding psf is about 0.48 . with increase in @xmath28 terms compensated beyond 60",
    "there is hardly any visually significant change in the convolved images .",
    "however , the sr and intensity contrast show asymptotic behavior with respect to @xmath28 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : strehl ] ) .",
    "the values of sr smaller than unity and the reduced intensity contrast are due to the presence of residual higher order aberrations in the ao corrected phase screens .",
    "even with as many as 400 terms compensated the sr is only about 0.9 and the intensity contrast is about 99% of the diffraction limited value . in practice , the maximum number of terms compensated is about equal to the number of actuators used in the ao system which is in the order of @xmath31 @xcite . in the case",
    "considered for simulation it is practical to correct up to about 100 terms .",
    "this implies that even with an ideal ao system , which corrects for the possible maximum number of aberration terms , the residual phase errors are still significant .",

    "hence the plots of cross - talk values for scheme  2  in the dual - beam setup are not shown .",
    "the simulations are carried out under the assumption of an ideal ao system . which means that the ao system fully compensates the @xmath28 number of lowest order zernike terms with infinite frequency bandwidth .",

    "however , because of the finite bandwidth of a real ao there high frequency low order phase errors still remain @xcite which tend towards increasing cross - talk .",
    "this suggests that the amount of cross - talk in the case of a real ao will depend on the amplitude of the residual low order phase errors within and outside the ao correction bandwidth in addition to the uncorrected higher order aberrations .",
