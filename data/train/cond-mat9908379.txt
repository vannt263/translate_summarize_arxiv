    "the 6-vertex model on a square lattice @xcite describes hydrogen - bonded crystals in two dimensions . historically , it was slater @xcite who first considered the evaluation of the residual entropy of ice , a hydrogen - bonded crystal , under the assumptions that ( i ) there is one hydrogen atom on each lattice edge , and ( ii ) there are always two hydrogen atoms near , and away from , each lattice site ( the ice rule ) .",
    "under these assumptions there are 6 possible hydrogen configurations at each site , and one is led to a 6-vertex model .",
    "the exact residual entropy of the  square \" ice , i.e. , ice on the square lattice , was obtained by lieb @xcite , which gives rise to a numerical number surprisingly close to the experimental residual entropy of real ice ( in three dimensions ) .",
    "the 6-vertex model is therefore an accurate description of hydrogen - bonded crystals .    in real hydrogen - bonded crystals , however ,",
    "there exist bonding defects @xcite .",
    "one way through which bond defects can occur is caused by the double - well potential seen by hydrogen atoms between two lattice sites .",
    "when two hydrogens occupy the two off - center potential wells along a given lattice edge , the assumption ( i ) above is broken , albeit the ice rule ( ii ) is still intact .",
    "this leads to the fact that one , two or zero hydrogen atoms can be present on a lattice edge .",
    "indeed , one of us @xcite has considered this possibility in a percolation model of supercooled water .",
    "the same model has later been considered by attard and batchelor @xcite who analyzed it using series analyses .",
    "more recently , attard @xcite reformulated the problem as a 14-vertex model with bjerrum bond defects , and analyzed the 14-vertex model using an independent bond approximation . here , using a somewhat different mapping , we establish the exact equivalence of the 6-vertex model with bond defects with an 8-vertex model in an external field . as a result , we are able to analyse the exact solution in a particular parameter subspace .",
    "we also discuss the general solution of the 6-vertex model with bond defects on the bethe lattice .",
    "consider a square lattice @xmath0 of @xmath1 sites under periodic boundary conditions so that there are @xmath2 lattice edges .",
    "the lattice is hydrogen - bonded with defects such that there can be one , two or zero hydrogen atoms on each lattice edge . as the hydrogen atoms are placed off - center on the edges , we place two ising spins @xmath3 on each lattice edge such that @xmath4 denotes that the site is occupied by a hydrogen and @xmath5 the site is empty .",
    "however , the ice rule dictates that the sum of the 4 ising spins @xmath6 surrounding a square lattice sites must vanish .",
    "there are altogether six ice - rule configurations as shown in fig .",
    "1 .    to1 in    ' '' ''    more generally , we consider the ice - rule model with weights _1=_2=a , _3=_4=b , _5=_6=c , [ weights ] where @xmath7 is the weight of the @xmath8th configuration shown in fig .",
    "1 . denote the weights ( [ weights ] ) by @xmath9 where the subscripts are indexed as shown and @xmath10 , etc .",
    "the weight @xmath9 satisfies the  spin reversal \" symmetry  ( _ 1,_2,_3,_4 ) =  ( -_1,-_2,-_3,-_4)[symmetry ] and vanishes except for the six weights given in ( [ weights ] ) .",
    "to each lattice edge containing two spins @xmath11 and @xmath12 , introduce an edge factor @xmath13 to reflect the effect of bond defects .",
    "then , the partition function of interest is z = _",

    "attard and batchelor @xcite adopted an arrow representation for the hydrogen configurations which , due to the occurrence of defects , led to a 14-vertex model with bjerrum defects . a weak - graph transformation @xcite is then carried out for the 14-vertex model . here",
    ", we expand the partition function directly . substituting ( [ e ] ) into ( [ part ] ) and expanding the second product over the edges of @xmath0",
    ", we obtain an expansion of @xmath17 terms .",
    "to each term in the expansion we associate a bond graph by drawing bonds on those edges corresponding to the @xmath18 factors contained in the term .",
    "this leads to a 16-vertex model on @xmath0 . besides an overall boltzman factor @xmath19 ,",
    "the 16-vertex model has vertex weights w = _ _ 1_2_3_4 (  ( _ 1,_2,_3,_4 ) ( z _ i)),[w ] where the product is taken over those incident edges with bonds .",
    "the symmetry relation ( [ symmetry ] ) now implies that @xmath20 whenever there are an odd number of incident bonds , and the 16-vertex model becomes an 8-vertex model .",
    "to1 in    ' '' ''    using the bond configurations of the 8-vertex model shown in fig .",
    "2 , it is straightforward to deduce using ( [ w ] ) the following vertex weights : w_1&= &  ( _ 1,_2,_3,_4 ) = 2(a+b+c ) + w_2&= & z^2_1_2_3_4 ( _ 1,_2,_3,_4 ) = 2z^2(a+b+c ) + w_3&= & w_4 = z_2_4 ( _ 1,_2,_3,_4 ) = 2z(-a - b+c ) + w_5&= & w_6 = z_1_2 ( _ 1,_2,_3,_4 ) = 2z(-a+b - c ) + w_7&= & w_8 = z_2_3 ( _ 1,_2,_3,_4 ) = 2z(a - b - c ) , [ 8weights ] where @xmath21 is the vertex weight of the @xmath8th vertex and",
    "we have used the fact that in the non - vanishing @xmath22 s we have @xmath23 .",
    "now , in an 8-vertex model configurations , vertices 3 and 4 , 5 and 6 , and 7 and 8 , always occur in pairs and/or in even numbers .",
    "therefore we can conveniently replace the relevant weights by their absolute values and arrive at , after dividing all weights by a common factor @xmath18 , w_1&= & z^-1(a+b+c ) + w_2&= & z(a+b+c ) + w_3&= & w_4 = |-a - b+c| + w_5&= & w_6 = |-a+b - c| + w_7&= & w_8 = |a - b - c| .",
    "[ 8weights1 ] the vertex weights ( [ 8weights1 ] ) describes an 8-vertex model in an external electric field @xmath24 in both the vertical and horizontal directions @xcite .    more generally , if we allow different values of @xmath25 in ( [ att ] ) and ( [ e ] ) for the horizontal and vertical edges respectively , and write @xmath26 and @xmath27 , where @xmath28 , then one arrives at an 8-vertex model with weights w_1&= & e^h+v(a+b+c ) + w_2&= & e^-h - v(a+b+c ) + w_3&= & e^h - v|-a - b+c| + w_4&= & e^v - h|-a - b+c| + w_5&= & w_6 = |-a+b - c| + w_7&= & w_8 = |a - b - c| .",
    "[ 8weights2 ] in ensuing discussions we shall consider the general model ( 9 ) .",
    "the free - fermion model @xcite is defined as a particular case of the eight - vertex model in which the vertex weights satisfy the relation w_1w_2 + w_3w_4 = w_5w_6 + w_7w_8 , a condition equivalent to the consideration of a noninteracting many - fermion system in an @xmath29-matrix formulation of the 8-vertex model @xcite . in the present case",
    "the free - fermion condition ( 10 ) is satisfied when either @xmath30 or @xmath31 . without the loss of generality , we consider @xmath30 and @xmath32 .",
    "the closed expression for the free energy of the free - fermion model is well - known @xcite and after some algebraic manipulation using results of @xcite , we obtain -f=_n = + _ 0 ^ 2 d , [ freeenergy ] where q&=&[+k^2 + 2k]^2 + 4 k^2 ^ 2 , + a&=&+k^2 + 2k [ coeff ] with @xmath33",
    ".    the critical condition of the free - fermion model is given by @xcite w_1 + w_2 + w_3 + w_4 = 2 , where w_1&= & e^h+v(b+c ) + w_2&= & e^-h - v(b+c ) + w_3&= & e^h - v(b - c ) + w_4&= & e^v - h(b - c ) .",
    "[ 8weights3 ] thus , the @xmath34-@xmath35 plane is divided into four regions depending on which vertex @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 or @xmath39 has the largest weight . denoting the four regions by @xmath40 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 and @xmath43 respectively , as shown in fig .",

    "[ critical ] the critical condition ( 15 ) is plotted in fig .",
    "@xmath44 for four specific values of @xmath45 .",

    "when @xmath47 for which @xmath48 is a complete square , however , we have -f & = & + & = & + |h+v| [ complete ] and the phase boundary @xmath49 separates the two frozen states @xmath50 and @xmath51 .",
    "to3 in    ' '' ''",
    "now , we consider the 6-vertex model with bond defects on a bethe - like lattice with plaquettes as shown in fig .",
    "the study of systems in the bethe - like lattices is an alternative approach to the usual mean - field theory .",
    "the main features of the model under investigation will be obtained by studying the properties of the free energy .    a free energy in a region deep inside a bethe - like lattice must be carefully defined .",
    "it can not be obtained by directly evaluating the logarithm of the partition function in which the contribution from the outside of this region is not negligible and as result the system exhibits an unusual type of phase transitions without long - range order @xcite .",
    "recently , a method for the surface independent free energy calculation is presented @xcite .",
    "the free energy @xmath52 per plaquette of our model is expressed as -f_=_n ( -3 ) [ fener ] where @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the partition functions of the 6-vertex model with bond defect on the bethe - like lattice consist of @xmath55 and @xmath56 generations respectively .",
    "to2 in    ' '' ''    the calculation on the bethe - like lattice is based on a recursion method @xcite .",
    "when the tree is cut at the central plaquette , it is separate into 4 branches , each of which contains 3 branches",
    ". then the partition function of interest ( [ part ] ) can be written as follows : z_n = ( ) ^n_b^(n ) _",

    "each branch , in turn , can be cut along any site of the first generation .",
    "then the expressions for @xmath58 can therefore be written in the form : g_n+1(_01)= _ \\{_1i}(1+z _ 01 _ 13 ) (_11 , _",

    "let us consider the case when series of solution of recursion relation converge to a stable point at @xmath63 , namely , @xmath64 we obtain the following equation : x = .",
    "[ eqstat ] we are now in a position to compute the free energy per plaquette of our model . using eqs .",
