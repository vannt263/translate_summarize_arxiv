    "tsunamis are potentially devastating disasters for coastal regions worldwide .",
    "the loss of life due to tsunamis can be greatly reduced when the propagation time of a tsunami is long enough to allow for timely issuance of warnings .",
    "beginning soon after devastating tsunamis in 1960 and 1964 , the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) and its predecessors have provided tsunami forecasts to the united states and other nations .",
    "the research presented here is part of an ongoing effort to improve the speed and accuracy of such forecasts through enhanced observational capabilities .    prompted in part by the scale of destruction and unprecedented loss of life following the december 2004 sumatra tsunami ,",
    "noaa has deployed 39 deep - ocean assessment and reporting of tsunamis ( dart^^ ) buoys ( to date , eight countries other than the united states have set out additional buoys ) .",
    "these buoys can observe the passage of a tsunami and relay data related to its arrival time and amplitude in near - real time .",
    "these data are used by the short - term inundation forecast for tsunamis ( sift ) application developed at the noaa center for tsunami research ( nctr ) ; for details , see gica et al .",

    "[ sec : construction ] , these coefficients are used to forecast wave heights at locations in the open ocean outside of impact sites ( coastal regions of particular interest , e.g. , hilo hi ) . in turn forecasts of these wave heights play a critical role in forecasting coastal inundation at impact sites .    in this article",
    "we consider the problem of how to evaluate the effectiveness of a dart^^  buoy network in providing accurate and timely forecasts of open - ocean wave heights . for an existing network the goal is to devise a simple measure of effectiveness that can be monitored over time and used to raise an alarm if the network deteriorates .",
    "for an alteration to an existing network ( typically through adding , decommissioning or relocating a buoy ) , the goal is to quantify the effect of the change in a simple manner .",
    "the challenge in both cases is that the effectiveness of wave height forecasts is predicated on a number of interacting factors .",
    "the desire for a simple measure is at odds with the inherent complexity of the forecast process .",
    "what is needed is a useful measure that does not oversimplify .",
    "here we propose a measure that makes certain simplifications but nonetheless captures key factors limiting the accuracy of forecasted wave heights .",

    "[ sec : discussion ] ) , a summary and our conclusions ( sect .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] ) .",
    "here we give an overview of how open - ocean wave height forecasts are made in practice .",
    "generation of these forecasts presumes that a tsunami - causing earthquake originates from within one or more unit sources , which are 100 km by 50 km sections of fault planes in tsunamigenic regions .",
    "figure  [ fig : aleutian ] shows locations of a subset of 74 predesignated unit sources tiling the region where the pacific plate is being subducted within the aleutian  alaska subduction zone .",
    "the sources chosen are in 2 rows ( b and a ) and 37 columns ( 001 to 037 ) .",
    "row b is adjacent to the plate boundary , while row a is a continuation of the descending slab to greater depths ( we do not make use of additional rows used to represent deeper aleutian  alaska earthquakes )",
    ". the expanded view in the figure shows rows b and a along with 3 of the columns ( 025 , 026 and 027 ) .",
    "we refer to the unit source in , e.g. , row b and column 026 as ac026b .",
    "the figure also shows the locations of three impact sites ( hilo ( hil ) , crescent city ( ccy ) and port san luis ( psl ) ) and the current locations of 14 dart^^  buoys ( labeled clockwise by u , v ,  , x , 1 , 2 ,  , 8 ; the expanded view traps buoy 46403 , which is labeled as 6 ) .",
    "there are 39 dart^^  buoys in all , but these 14 are germane for handling events arising from aleutian  alaska earthquakes in that , as called for by standard operating procedures , their data could be used as the basis for issuing a warning at least three hours in advance to at least one of the three impact sites ( whitmore et al .",
    "a geophysical model is precomputed for each pairing of one of the 74 unit sources with either a particular buoy or a location in the open ocean outside of an impact site of interest ( these and other models are stored in a propagation database maintained at nctr ; gica et al .",
    "2008 ) the model predicts what would be observed over time at a deep water location if a moment magnitude @xmath0 reverse thrust fault earthquake were to originate from within a particular unit source",
    ". figure  [ fig : sixunitsources ] shows examples of predictions for buoy 46403 due to an earthquake from either unit source ac026b or one of five abutting it ( for use later on , these predictions are marked by @xmath1 ,  , @xmath2 ) . if , as is usually the case , the moment magnitude of the earthquake is different from 7.5 , then , relying on the linearity of tsunami waves in deep water , the predictions are adjusted by a nonnegative multiplication factor @xmath3 known as a source coefficient .",
    "earthquakes can span more than one unit source , in which case the model is taken to be a linear combination of individual unit source models , with the coefficients in the linear combination , say @xmath4 , @xmath5 , all constrained to be nonnegative .        during the passage of a tsunami , a dart^^  buoy collects and transmits a time series of bottom pressure ( bp ) measurements .",
    "each measurement represents the bp averaged over a 1-min span . the spans are non - overlapping , and the measurements occur once per minute , thus forming what we refer to as a 1-min stream of data .",
    "once a sufficient stretch of this stream has been collected by the first buoy that detects the tsunami event , the source coefficients @xmath4 are estimated using constrained least squares ( percival et al .",
    "2014 ) . with the passage of time , more 1-min data from this and",
    "potentially other buoys become available , and the estimates @xmath6 of the source coefficients can be reevaluated and possibly refined . in operational tsunami forecasting , the estimated source coefficients are applied to a sub - region of the propagation database to provide the boundary forcing fields for the real - time inundation model run with detailed simulation of waves , currents and inundation for the impact site ( gica et al .",
    "2008 ) ; however , in the simulation study discussed in the next section , we avoid use of the inundation model by choosing an adjacent deep - water location for each impact site of interest .",
    "this approach allows us to efficiently generate a large numbers of simulations by linear combinations of table look - ups .    ) .",
    "the top row shows the models for unit sources ac025a , ac026a and ac027a ( labeled as @xmath1 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) ; the bottom , for ac025b , ac026b and ac027b ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath2 ) .",
    "the time span for each displayed model is 45 minutes , and the span starts 10 minutes after the start of the earthquake ]",
    "in theory the best way to evaluate the effectiveness of a network of dart^^  buoys would be to compare coastal inundation forecasts formulated during actual tsunami events with the actual inundations . while such comparisons are routinely done as a vital check on current operational procedures , use of these alone is not sufficient for network evaluation .",
    "a meaningful assessment would require not only multiple events , but also ones treated in the same manner ( no change in the network of buoys , no equipment upgrades , use of the same methodology for forming the forecasts , etc . ) .",
    "even if conditions for generating forecasts could be fixed , the amount of time needed to collect data for a reliable evaluation would be inordinate given the rate at which tsunamis occur .",
    "in addition , if we were to insist upon using actual events to assess effectiveness , changes to a network could not be assessed until long after the changes had been put into place . for planning purposes ,",
    "we need the ability to assess the effectiveness of any proposed changes .",
    "we thus entertain basing our assessments on simulated forecasts .    as noted in the previous section , the run - up model for generating inundation forecasts at a particular impact site",
    "requires its initial conditions be set by wave heights in the open ocean at a nearby location .",
    "the quality of the forecasts generated by the run - up model depends critically on these initial conditions , which are provided by forecasts of open - ocean wave heights . rather than assessing a network via the quality of inundation forecasts directly ,",
    "we can do so indirectly via the quality of open - ocean wave height forecasts . in the simulation studies discussed below",
    ", this indirect approach is computationally attractive because calculation of run - up models is time - consuming .",
    "with the simplification of dealing with open - ocean wave height forecasts rather than inundation forecasts , there are four tasks at hand  discussed in the subsections to follow  to simulate and evaluate the forecasts of interest .",
    "the first task is to play the role of nature ( sect .",
    "[ subsec : simtsunamisignal ] ) .",
    "we must simulate a tsunami event along with what we will regard as the wave heights presumed to occur outside of an impact site of interest .",
    "the second task is to play the role of nature s observer ( sect .",
    "[ subsec : simoneminstream ] ) .",
    "we must simulate the data that dart^^  buoy would collect during a tsunami event .",
    "the third task is to use the simulated data to estimate source coefficients , which in turn are used to forecast the wave heights at an impact site ( sect .",
    "[ subsec : estsourcecoeffs ] ) .",
    "the fourth task is to evaluate the quality of the forecasted wave heights by comparing them with the presumed heights using an appropriate metric ( sect .",
    "[ subsec : evaluation ] ) .    in the remainder of this section ,",
    "we illustrate how we carry out these four tasks by focusing on a representative triad consisting of one predesignated central unit source ( ac026b ) , one dart^^  buoy ( 46403 ) and one impact site ( hilo hi ) .",
    "the evaluation of the effectiveness of a dart^^  buoy network requires a systematic look at other triads , which is considered in sect .",
    "[ sec : network ] .",
    "our first task is to simulate a tsunami event , which manifests itself as a tsunami signal that passes by a particular dart^^  buoy , say , 46403 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : aleutian ] shows the location of this buoy ) .",
    "we denote this signal by @xmath11 . a simple way to specify @xmath11 would be to use one of the precomputed models predicting what 46403 should see if the tsunami event were to originate from within a particular predesignated unit source , say , ac026b ( shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : aleutian ] ) . we would thus just set @xmath11 equal to @xmath10 depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig : sixunitsources ] ; however , we have chosen _ not _ to adopt this simple way of simulating the signal because an important factor impacting open - ocean wave height forecasts is modeling of the tsunami signal @xmath11 ( this is the subject of sect .  [ subsec : estsourcecoeffs ] ) . because we can not model the signal perfectly in an actual tsunami event ,",
    "there is a danger of generating unrealistic simulated forecasts if we were to assume the signal to be identical to its model .",
    "one source of mismatch is due to the uncertainty in the location of the source within the subduction zone .",
    "figure  [ fig : randompick ] illustrates the effect of relocating unit source ac026b , producing a relocated 100 km by 50 km source that overlaps ( in this example ) with three additional predesignated sources . to create the relocated source",
    ", we picked a random point ( the red diamond ) within ac026b and used this point as the center for the relocated unit source ( blue rectangle ) .",
    "we can now compute a model predicting what would be observed at buoy 46403 if an earthquake were to originate from the randomly relocated unit source .",
    "this new model will exhibit some degree of difference from the precomputed models shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sixunitsources ] .",
    "if we take this new model to be our tsunami signal @xmath11 and if we were then to entertain modeling @xmath11 using a subset of the models shown in fig .  [ fig : sixunitsources ] , then the constructed signal need not be exactly equal to its model . randomly choosing a set of locations within a central unit source ( ac026b in this example ) then leads to an ensemble of relocated sources that reflects the uncertainty in source location .    because it is time consuming to generate geophysical models , we make an assumption of linearity and construct the tsunami signal @xmath11 using a linear combination of precomputed models . for the example shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : randompick ] , the signal would be a linear combination of the models for unit sources ac025a , ac026a , ac025b and ac026b ( the central unit source ) .",
    "these models are labeled in fig .",
    "[ fig : sixunitsources ] as @xmath1 , @xmath7 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 .",
    "the weights @xmath12 in the linear combination are dictated by the degree of intersection of the relocated source with the predesignated sources  in this example , @xmath10 ( corresponding to ac026b ) gets the most weight , while @xmath1 ( corresponding to ac025a ) gets the least .",

    "note that , since neither @xmath8 nor @xmath2 are involved in constructing @xmath11 , the weights @xmath16 and @xmath17 are zero .",
    "past experience with actual tsunami events suggests that the weights should not be arbitrarily set if we want to regard the simulated event as originating from a 100  km by 50  km region ( hanks and kanamori 1979 ; papazachos et al .",
    "we use the normalization @xmath18 in all of our simulations because a larger setting than this would result in a tsunami signal whose magnitude would be more realistically associated with multiple unit sources . for the example shown in fig .",

    ".    we can construct additional tsunami signals by selecting other points at random within the rectangle for the central unit source ac026b .",
    "figure  [ fig : fourquads ] breaks the rectangle for ac026b up into four quadrants of equal size ( labeled as i , ii , iii and iv ) .",
    "the specific models @xmath14 that are used to construct the tsunami signal depend upon which quadrant the randomly selected point falls in ",

    "this restriction for central unit sources simplifies computer code somewhat and should not adversely impact the evaluation of the effectiveness of a buoy network .",

    "now we set @xmath67 to @xmath72 for a left - hand pick and to @xmath73 otherwise .",
    "there is again a 50% chance of having a mismatch , but now the nature of the mismatch is that there are two too many unit sources .",
    "4 .   the _ matched protocol _ sets @xmath67 so that it contains _ exactly _ the indices used in forming the constructed signal ;",
    "i.e. , we use the same set of @xmath14 s both to form the signal and to model it so there is no mismatch .",

    "after selection of the protocol @xmath67 , the regression model of eq .",
    "( [ eq : basicmodel ] ) is now fully specified .",
    "the model involves three coefficients for the tidal model ( @xmath53 , @xmath57 and @xmath61 ) and either one , two or four source coefficients @xmath4 for the signal model .",

    "these two buoys are the only ones that can provide a warning three hours in advance to crescent city . because there is no other buoy to rely on",
    ", we can consider the rmse ratio to be infinite .",
    "the second worst case scenario occurs when buoys 2 and 3 drop out for an event from ac012b leading to the rmse ratio of 9.5 , with 1 providing backup .",
    "after these worse cases , there are a number of rmse ratios equal to 7.1 , all of which involve buoy 8 and unit source ac012b .    turning now to port san luis ( right - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : leavetwoout ] ) , the rmse for the worst case scenario is 13.7 , which occurs when 7 and 8 were inoperative and is associated with ac034b ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : bottomlines3x2](c ) ) . with these two buoys gone , buoy 6 has the best rmse amongst the remaining buoys satisfying the three hour warning time constraint .",
    "the second and third largest rmse ratios are 4.9 and 4.8 .",
    "the latter is of interest because the two buoys involved are 1 and z , and the unit source is ac008b ( this is in agreement with fig .  [ fig : bottomlines3x2](c ) ) . with",
    "both of these buoys gone , buoy w has the best remaining rmse .",
    "note that , in this case , the rmse - based metric for network evaluation differs from one based solely on travel time since the travel times between unit source ac008b and buoys x and y are both shorter than that for w ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : aleutian ] ) .",
    "we can also explore the effect on network performance when three buoys drop out .",
    "for hilo , the worse case scenario is for buoys 4 , 3 and 5 to be unavailable when an event arises from unit source ac020b .",
    "buoy 6 then has the best rmse amongst the remaining buoys satisfying the three hour warning time constraint , and the associated rmse ratio raises to 23.0 ( as compared to 11.2 when two buoys  5 and 4  drop out during an event arising from unit source ac023b ) . for crescent city",
    ", we have already noted that loss of 7 and 8 means that none of the remaining buoys can provide a three hour warning for events from either ac034b , ac035b or ac036b . with the additional loss of 6 ,",
    "events from ac031b , ac032b or ac033b are also problematic because of lack of a fourth buoy that can provide a three hour warning .",
    "there are similar concerns for ac029b and ac030b when 5 , 6 and 7 are jointly inoperative .",
    "turning to port san luis , the worst cases scenario involves buoys 7 , 8 and 6 ; the associated unit source is ac034b ; and backup comes from buoy 5 with an rmse ratio of 42.2 . the buoys and unit sources match up well with the leave - two - out case .        to help assess the effect of one , two or three buoys becoming inoperative",
    ", we introduce a simple indicator of the current status of the network reflecting its ability to forecast maximum wave heights at a given impact site .",
    "the indicator has three levels :    1 .",
    "if the rmse ratio is less than 2 , we award the network a ` green ' status ( the network is healthy ) ; 2 .",
    "a ratio between 2 and 4 indicates a ` yellow ' status ( the network has deteriorated somewhat ) ; and 3 .   a ratio greater than an 4 is a ` red ' status ( there is serious deterioration )    ( the values 2 and 4 are placeholders for our demonstration , but are arbitrary and subject to change when used in practice ) . in fig .",
    "[ fig : leaveoneout ] , there are vertical dotted lines at 2 and 4 in each of the plots  these delineate the boundaries between the three levels .",
    "considering the plot for hilo , we see that the network would still have a green status even if any one of 6 buoys (",
    "u to y or 8) out of a total of 14 ( i.e. , 43% ) were to drop out by itself ; on other other hand , losing any one of z or 1 to 7 would result in a yellow status ( 57% ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : greenyellowred](a ) depicts these percentages , and plots  ( b ) and  ( c ) show corresponding results for the two california sites .",
    "the middle and bottom rows of fig .",
    "[ fig : greenyellowred ] shows the percentages when two or three buoys drop out together .",
    "not surprisingly , as more buoys drop out , the percentage of cases with red status increases for a given impact site .",
    "note that three buoys can drop out but there can still be a green rating at all three impact sites for events arising from aleutian islands ( but presumably not elsewhere ) .",
    "on the other hand , dropout of the single buoy 7 can raise a red alarm for port san luis . once a particular buoy has dropped out",
    ", we can assess the effect of loss of one of the other buoys , thus giving an indication of the urgency of returning the buoy to normal operation .",
    "this exercise would address the question of how close the array is to falling into a red status .    as a concluding example , the national data buoy center ( ndbc.noaa.gov ) reported that four of the 14 buoys we have been considering were inoperative at the time of writing ( early june 2016 ) , namely , u , v , w and 2 .",
    "loss of 2 alone is enough to raise a yellow alarm for hilo and port san luis and a red alarm for crescent city ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : leaveoneout ] ) .",
    "additional loss of u , v and w does not increase the alarm level for hilo or port san luis . with these four buoys",
    "gone , the alarm status for hilo would switch from yellow to red if either buoy 3 or 5 were to become inoperative , whereas , for port san luis , only the additional loss of buoy 7 would increase the alarm level .      in the preceding case study we concentrated on evaluating an existing network of dart^^  buoys . here",
    "we illustrate another use for our proposed methodology , namely , to assess the impact of extending an existing network by adding a new buoy .",
    "figure  [ fig : southamerica ] is a map of the west coast of south america showing the locations of 130 predesignated unit sources , the hilo impact site ( hil ) , nine operational dart^^  buoys ( labeled 1 to 9 ) and one decommissioned buoy ( x ) .",
    "these buoys are mainly intended to provide forecasts for southern hemisphere impact sites . merely to exercise our proposed methodology , we presume buoys 1 to 8 to be a preexisting network and consider the benefit to hilo of adding buoy 9 ( we do not report on results for crescent city and port san luis because they are quite similar to those for hilo ) .",
    "in addition we explore a hypothetical question : what would have been the effect on hilo if , rather than augmenting the network by adding buoy 9 ( a coastal buoy ) , buoy x ( an open ocean buoy ) had been reactivated instead ?",
    "figure  [ fig : hilosa ] shows rmses of forecasted maximum wave heights at hilo for tsunami events arising from south america . in the same manner as fig .",
    "[ fig : summaryalaska ] for the aleutian  alaskan subduction zone , these rmses are based on the 4 protocol and 21 minutes of data after the first peak in the constructed tsunami signal .",
    "the requirement that a warning to hilo must be issued at least three hours in advance of the arrival of the tsunami is satisfied for all buoy / unit source combinations with two exceptions : buoy 1 with cs109b , and the same buoy with cs114b .",
    "the rmses for buoys 9 and x are colored , respectively , red and blue .    for the network consisting of buoys 1 to 8 ( black symbols in fig .",
    "[ fig : hilosa ] ) , there is an increase in rmse of approximately an order of magnitude going from the northern - most central unit sources ( cs052b to cs080b ) to the southern - most ( cs100b to cs114b ) .",
    "this pattern is in contrast to fig .",
    "[ fig : summaryalaska ] for the aleutian  alaskan subduction zone , where the rmses are not strikingly different across all unit sources . augmenting the network of eight buoys with coastal buoy 9 leads to a decrease in best rmse by a factor to two or more for unit sources cs087b to cs094b ( the unit source closest to 9 is cs090b  see fig .",
    "[ fig : southamerica ] ) ; however , although there is some improvement in best rmse from unit source cs085b up to cs097b , there is none elsewhere .",
    "the augmented network thus does not improve forecasts of wave heights at hilo for events arising from the southern - most unit sources .",
    "suppose now that we augment the network 1 to 8 by adding the open ocean buoy x rather than buoy 9 .",
    "we would now have a factor of two or more decrease in best rmse for unit sources cs093b to cs114b ( cs100b is an exception  there is still a noticeable decrease , but less than a factor of two ; in addition , there are small improvements in best rmses for unit sources cs091b and cs092b ) .",
    "thus , in contrast to augmenting the network 1 to 8 with buoy 9 , augmenting with x improves the response of the network in handling events events from the southern - most unit sources .",
    "the x augmentation improves the best rmse at 24 unit sources , while the 9 augmentation , at 12 unit sources ; however , the drastic improvement offered by the 9 augmentation at unit sources close to cs090 is not matched anywhere by the x augmentation .    in terms of improving forecasts for hilo , augmenting the network 1 to 8 by reactivating",
    "the open ocean buoy x is arguably preferable to going with coastal buoy 9 ; however , there are many other impact site of importance , each of which would need to be evaluated in a similar manner , and the individual evaluations would need to be combined to come up with an objective evaluation of which buoy is the preferable augmentation ( how best to combine the evaluations is a subject for future research ) .",
    "our intent is not to take issue with the current placement of south american buoys , but rather to demonstrate how our methodology can be used to evaluate variations of an existing network .    ) in combination with central unit sources cs052b to cs114b along the west coast of south america , width=432 ]",
    "four aspects of our method for evaluating buoy networks merit additional discussion .",
    "first , as we have mentioned in passing , our approach is based on certain simplifications , including ( but not limited to )    1 .",
    "tsunami - generating events that come from within a single unit source and 2 .",
    "use of data from a single dart^^  buoy to forecast wave heights at an impact site even though tsunami events are routinely observed at multiple buoys ( i.e. , we do not combine together data from several buoys to generate forecasts as is done during actual tsunami events ) .",
    "with regard to 1 , we are in effect assuming that highly localized tsunami events are useful for assessing the effectiveness of a network of buoys . with regard to 2",
    ", we are assuming that forecasts based on each buoy separately can assess the effectiveness of the overall network and that using two or more buoys simultaneously wo nt lead to a significantly different evaluation .",
    "while use of events originating from regions spanning more than a single unit source and use of data from multiple buoys for generating forecasts are more typical operationally , going beyond simplifying assumptions 1 and 2 introduces levels of complexity that would complicate the simulation procedures needed for the network evaluation .",
    "in addition , assumption 2 provides a way of evaluating the contribution to the network of each buoy individually , which is more difficult to do when buoys are used jointly for creating forecasts .",
    "-15pt , but now with the rmses of the maximum wave heights forecasted at the open ocean outside of the impact sites plotted versus maximum wave heights at the dart^^  buoys rather than plotted versus maximum wave heights in the open ocean outside of the impact sites . while only the best rmses ( colored by blue symbols ) and second best ( red ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bottomlines3x2 ] , both these and all remaining rmses ( black ) are shown here , title=\"fig : \" ]    second , our performance measure is predicated on tsunami events coming from a specific subduction zone ( e.g. , aleutian  alaskan ) and heading toward a specific impact site ( e.g. , hilo ) .",
    "we have not addressed the question of how to take the measures for different subduction zones and different impact sites and combine them together .",
    "for example , combining measures for multiple subduction zones and hilo would lead to an evaluation of how well hilo is serviced by the global buoy network . on the other hand , combining measures for the aleutian  alaskan subduction zone and multiple impact sites would tell us how well the buoy network offers protection globally for events arising from that particular subduction zone .",
    "combined measures such as these are certainly of interest , but how best to do so is outside the scope of this article .",
    "third , we have concentrated on impact sites that are distant from the unit sources generating the tsunami events . for these sites insisting on a 3 hr warning time",
    "is appropriate . for sites that are close to a particular unit source (",
    "of which there are many along the west coast of south america ) , a more stringent warning time ( e.g. , 30 min ) must unfortunately be entertained .",
    "a mixture of impact sites  some distant and some close to a given unit source  adds a degree of complexity ( beyond the scope of this article ) for assessing how well a tsunami event arising from such a source is handled by a buoy network .",
    "fourth , our work points to an interesting potential practical method for quantifying uncertainties in forecasts .",
    "figure  [ fig : summaryalaska35uswhbeststacked ] shows rmses at the three impact sites versus maximum wave height at the buoys . for a given buoy , fig .",
    "[ fig : summaryalaska35uswhbeststacked ] shows that the lowest rmses are associated with the highest maximum wave heights .",
    "that is , buoys that are positioned well to sample the strongest portion of the main tsunami beam yield the best forecasts in terms of rmses .",
    "the relationship between the maximum wave heights at the buoys and the rmses is roughly linear on a log / log scale , with a fairly strong sample correlation of @xmath109 .",
    "this suggests that the rmse in forecasts at impact sites can be usefully assessed from the maximum wave height at the buoys .",
    "this opens up the possibility of assigning a quality measure to forecasts at impact sites based on a simple summary of the data collected at the buoy .",
    "we have developed a performance measure that quantifies the impact on forecasts of open - ocean wave heights near an impact site due to loss of one or more buoys in a network of dart^^  buoys .",
    "the measure is based on a simulation procedure that takes into account key factors contributing to uncertainty in the forecasts .",
    "one factor is the model for the tsunami signal , which is never known perfectly in practice , in part due to uncertainty in the location of the tsunami - generating earthquake .",
    "we mimic this uncertainty by taking a predetermined central unit source and relocating it through random selection of a new location for its center .",
    "this relocation leads to perturbations both in the tsunami signal as it appears at dart^^  buoys and in the open - ocean wave heights .",
    "the perturbations are codified by source coefficients , which serve as weights for forming the perturbed signal and wave heights through linear combinations of signals and wave heights associated with the central unit source and ones abutting it .",
    "tidal fluctuations and background noise recorded at the buoys are two additional factors contributing to forecast uncertainty .",
    "we mimic these through the use of archived dart^^  data recorded under ambient conditions either by the buoy of interest or by a surrogate operating under similar oceanographic conditions . the simulated tsunami signal and randomly selected archived data",
    "are added together to form simulated buoy data .",
    "these data are the response in a regression model for estimating source coefficients , which in turn lead to estimates of wave heights .",
    "discrepancies between the estimated and presumed coefficients translate into errors in forecasted wave heights .",
    "these estimation errors are due in part to tidal fluctuations and background noise in the simulated buoy data , but are also influenced by the amount of available data and by a mismatch between the regression model and the presumed model for the signal , both of which we mimic in our simulations .",
    "a thousand replications of our simulation procedure for a given unit source / buoy combination gives a thousand forecasts of open - ocean wave heights at as many impact sites as desired . to summarize the quality of the forecasts , we compare the thousand maximum values of the forecasted height to the corresponding presumed maximum values by forming a root - mean - square error ( rmse ) .",
    "the rmses for a network of buoys in conjunction with a set of unit sources relevant for a particular impact site form the basis for network evaluation .",
    "the evaluation consists of dropping one or more buoys from the network and determining what change there is in the minimum rmse for each unit source .",
    "we propose to use the maximum change in minimum rmse as a metric for measuring the health of the buoy network as one or more buoys become inoperative .",
    "we also propose a simple green / yellow / red indicator of network health as a management tool",
    ".    currently we have bread - boarded our procedure for evaluating the effectiveness of dart^^  buoy networks in the r language ( ihaka and gentleman 1996 ; r development core team 2010 ) . using the r code as guidance , current plans are to encapsulate the methodology we have described into a tool that would serve multiple purposes .",
    "we would use the tool to go beyond our aleutian island and south american case studies to do a comprehensive study of the existing network of 39 buoys .",
    "this study might identify unit sources for which the current network configuration is particularly sensitive at certain impact sites to the dropout of buoys .",
    "we could also use the tool to assess the impact of adjusting the network by relocating or adding buoys .",
    "subject to additional research , it should be possible to use the tool to investigate the use of tide gauges to help mitigate the loss of buoys . despite the simplifications we have made",
    ", we contend that our proposed methodology is an effective and realistic way to assess network effectiveness and that a tool built around this methodology would be valuable for managing networks of dart^^  and other types of tsunami buoys .",
