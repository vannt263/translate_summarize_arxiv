    "at the end of 2002 japanese collaboration leps at spring-8 @xcite and the bubble chamber experiment diana at itep , moscow @xcite , announced evidence of a strange baryon , called @xmath4 , whose quantum numbers can not be constructed from 3 quarks .",
    "this truly exotic state : ( @xmath5 ) has been anticipated already by the founders of the quark model , however it was believed to be rather heavy ( 1800  1900 mev ) and wide .",
    "the excitement created by the findings of leps and diana was due to the low mass of the putative @xmath4 , of the order of 1530 mev , and a very small width .",
    "such properties , however , are natural in chiral models where the antistrange quark is excited in form of a chiral field rather than as a constituent quark .",
    "early predictions of the @xmath4 mass in different versions of the chiral models were very close to the experimental numbers of leps and diana @xcite , and moreover the width , as estimated by diakonov , petrov and polyakov in 1997 , was very small @xcite .",
    "the discovery by leps and diana triggered both experimental and theoretical activity in a somewhat extinct field of hadron spectroscopy .",
    "present experimental situation is , however , rather confusing .",
    "many collaborations announced the existence of @xmath4 in different experimental setups , but the comparable number of searches ended with null result .",
    "furthermore , dedicated high statistics runs with clas detector at cebaf did not show any signal of @xmath4 contradicting previous findings of the same collaboration @xcite . on the other hand leps has confirmed its original result @xcite .",
    "also high statistics analysis by diana turned out to be positive @xcite .",
    "we refer the reader to recent reviews of the experimental situation @xcite . for the purpose of the present study",
    "we assume that @xmath4 exists with a mass equal 1540 mev and total width @xmath6 mev .",
    "one of the immediate consequences of a possible existence of @xmath4 is the existence of the whole su(3 ) multiplet : @xmath7 ( see fig.[fig : multiplets ] ) .",
    "indeed , na49 experiment at cern @xcite announced discovery of another exotic state , namely @xmath8 .",
    "unfortunately the searches of @xmath9 by other groups have not confirmed the results of na49 .",
    "apart from truly exotic states that can not be constructed from three quarks , antidecuplet contains cryptoexotic states that are primarily built from 5 quarks , however their quantum numbers can be constructed from three quarks as well .",
    "these are nucleon - like states ( @xmath10 ) and @xmath11like states ( @xmath12 ) that are the subject of the present paper .",
    "the interpretation of these states is not well understood : one may try to associate them with some known resonances , as it was done in the case of @xmath10 in the original paper of diakonov , petrov and polyakov for example @xcite , or one may postulate the existence of new , yet undiscovered resonances with nucleon or @xmath13 quantum numbers . in this paper",
    "we follow the latter approach trying to predict the range of masses and widths for cryptoexotic @xmath12 and also @xmath9 states .",
    "weight diagrams for octet and antidecuplet . states that can mix lie on dashed lines . ]    in the chiral quark - soliton model ( @xmath14qsm ) the spin - parity quantum numbers of the antidecuplet members are unambiguously predicted to be @xmath15 @xcite , so that @xmath10 and @xmath16 are predicted to be @xmath17 resonances .",
    "one of the striking properties of @xmath10 is that it can be excited by an electromagnetic probe from the neutron target much stronger than from the proton one  @xcite .",
    "the photoexcitation of charged isocomponent of @xmath10 is possible only due to su@xmath18 violation ; therefore its suppression by a factor @xmath19 in the amplitude is expected .",
    "the existence of a new nucleon resonance with the mass near @xmath20 mev was suggested in refs .",
    "the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used the gell - mann  okubo mass relations in the presence of mixing , in order to predict the mass of this new nucleon resonance .",
    "as an input for the gell - mann  okubo mass formula the authors of ref .",
    "@xcite used the mass of the @xmath21 baryon reported by the na49 collaboration @xcite . in ref .",
    "@xcite , in order to constrain the mass of this possible new narrow @xmath22 , the modified pwa of @xmath23 scattering data was employed .",
    "it was found that the easiest way to accommodate a narrow @xmath22 is to set its mass around @xmath24  mev and quantum numbers to @xmath17 ( @xmath25 ) . in the same paper",
    "the width of the possible @xmath22 was analyzed in the framework of @xmath14qsm .",
    "it was found that the width of new n@xmath26 is in the range of tens of mev with very small @xmath27 partial width of @xmath28  mev @xcite .",
    "one should stress that the decay to @xmath27 is not suppressed in the su@xmath18 limit and it can be made small only if the symmetry violation is taken into account .",
    "it follows that the preferred decay channels are @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31  @xcite .",
    "the search of the new nucleon has been performed in the @xmath32 photoproduction on the neutron at graal  @xcite .",
    "the narrow peak in the quasi - free neutron cross section and in the @xmath33 invariant mass spectrum has been observed . the original observation of refs .",
    "@xcite has been recently confirmed by two other groups : cbelsa / taps  @xcite and lns - sendai  @xcite .",
    "all three experiments found an enhancement in the quasi - free cross - section on the neutron .",
    "in addition , the graal and cbelsa / taps groups have observed a narrow peak in the @xmath33 invariant mass spectrum at @xmath34  mev .",
    "the corresponding data can be explained by existence of a new narrow resonance @xcite .",
    "one should , however , stress that the part of above mentioned experimental results may have a different interpretation that does not require to postulate a new narrow nucleon resonance @xcite .    further evidence for a new narrow nucleon resonance came from the analysis of the @xmath13 beam asymmetry in @xmath32 photoproduction on the proton @xcite . in these papers the narrow structure in the @xmath13 beam asymmetry around invariant mass @xmath35  mev has been observed . that structure can be interpreted as the contribution of a narrow nucleon resonance with the mass 1685  mev , total width @xmath36  mev and the photocoupling to the proton much smaller than to the neutron ; the properties that are expected for the nonstrange partner of @xmath37@xcite .",
    "the properties of possible new narrow nucleon resonance that crystalized out recent experiments on @xmath32 photoproduction are summarized in ref .  @xcite . throughout this paper",
    "we shall assume that the new @xmath38 nucleon resonance exists with total width below 25 mev .",
    "one of the striking and to some extent counterintuitive properties of @xmath4 is its small width .",
    "in particular , diana @xcite that has doubled the statistics of their formation experiment @xmath39 as compared to the original result reported in ref.@xcite , claims @xmath40 and the width @xmath41 ( with possible systematic uncertainties ) .",
    "the only other available formation experiment with the secondary kaon beam at belle sets an upper limit @xmath42 ( at a 90% confidence level )  @xcite which is beyond the above value .",
    "also the reanalysis of the old @xmath43 scattering data  @xcite shows that there is room for the exotic resonance with a width below 1  mev .",
    "the small width implies that the coupling @xmath44 is at least an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath45 .",
    "the small value of @xmath44 appears naturally in a relativistic field - theoretic approach to baryons , allowing for a consistent account for multi - quark components in baryons ; in particular in refs .",
    "@xcite an upper bound @xmath46 has been obtained without any parameter fixing .",
    "recent calculation of the @xmath37 width in @xmath14qsm @xcite also gave small width of @xmath47  mev .",
    "the width below 1  mev also comes out from the parameter - free qcd sum rules analysis  @xcite .    in any case",
    "the small value of @xmath44 is related to the small value of @xmath48 reduced matrix element that is responsible for the direct decay @xmath49 .",
    "indeed@xmath50 where @xmath51 is the mixing angle between the nucleon - like states in octet and antidecuplet , and @xmath52 denotes the transition reduced matrix element @xmath53 ( see tab .",
    "[ tablematel ] for definitions ) . for ordinary baryons",
    "we expect terms like @xmath54 ( @xmath55 being of the order of @xmath56 ) to be small in comparison with the leading term . for antidecuplet both terms",
    "@xmath48 and @xmath57 are small and comparable in magnitude",
    ". they may add or cancel depending on the decay channel ( for @xmath4 we have only two equal decay channels @xmath58 ) violating completely the su@xmath59 relations between the decay couplings . in this way one",
    "is able to explain the suppression of @xmath27 decay channel in @xmath10 decays mentioned above , and also the existence of @xmath60 transition that is forbidden in the su@xmath59 limit .",
    "we see therefore that in the case of antidecuplet mixing is an important ingredient primarily to understand the decays , but also the masses @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , at least at the first sight , there is large arbitrariness as far as mixing angles and transition matrix elements are concerned .",
    "here we shall try to constrain them from the existing data .",
    "if the data are not available we shall make estimates based on @xmath14qsm .",
    "we shall consider mixing of the ground state octet ( @xmath61 ) , the octet of the @xmath62 roper resonance ( @xmath63 ) and antidecuplet . in the su@xmath59 limit",
    "all states in the ground state octet and in antidecuplet are separately degenerate in mass . when @xmath56 corrections are switched on the masses split and take values given by gell - mann  okubo ( gmo )  mass formulae . at the same time",
    "the wave functions become mixtures of the original representation ( 8 or @xmath7 ) and all other allowed su@xmath59 representations that appear in the tensor product @xmath64 or @xmath65 .",
    "this introduces @xmath66 mixing for nucleon - like and @xmath13-like states characterized by angle @xmath51 ( note that due to the accidental equality of the pertinent su(3 ) clebsch - gordan coefficients mixing angles between @xmath67- and @xmath13-like states are equal in the leading order in @xmath68 ) .",
    "we assume that ground state octet gmo states correspond to the physical states , which is true with 0.5% accuracy @xcite .",
    "we assume next that antidecuplet gmo states undergo further mixing with the roper octet . for roper octet gmo mass formulae work with much worse accuracy of approximately 3% @xcite , so there is a need for additional mixing .",
    "again both for @xmath67- and @xmath13-like states the mixing angle @xmath69 is the same .",
    "this is depicted in fig.[fig : angles ] . throughout this paper",
    "we take into account only these two mixings which we generally believe to be small .",
    "-like states .",
    "full circles denote physical states , open circles in the case of roper octet and @xmath7 correspond to the gmo states that undergo further mixing with angle @xmath69 .",
    "grey circles correspond to particles not considered in the present paper . ]",
    "our analysis is based on the following assumptions concerning antidecuplet .",
    "we assume @xmath70 mev and @xmath71 mev . we follow analysis of refs .",
    "@xcite assuming that @xmath10 is a new resonance with mass @xmath72 mev and total width @xmath73 mev .",
    "we also assume hierarchy of the branching ratios that is described in more detail in sect .",
    "[ sect : where ] . with these assumptions",
    "we are able to provide limits on the mixing angles both for the nucleon - like and @xmath13-like states .",
    "we find a small region in the space of mixing angles where the required properties of @xmath10 are reproduced .",
    "for these allowed angles we calculate masses of @xmath12 and @xmath9 and their decay patterns .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we discuss general formulae for quantum mixing and define mixing angles and wave functions used throughout this paper . in sect.[sect : decays ] we calculate the decay constants in the presence of mixing .",
    "we define reduced matrix elements and discuss their hermiticity properties .",
    "section [ sect : where ] contains numerical results of our analysis . finally in sect.[sect : conclusions ] we briefly summarize our results and present conclusions .",
    "before we discuss three state mixing , let us recall the formulae for two state mixing , that can be found for example in ref.@xcite . consider perturbation hamiltonian ( @xmath74 @xmath75 ) where @xmath76:@xmath77{cc}m_{1 } & -v\\\\ -v & m_{2}\\end{array } \\right ]   .",

    "in the present paper we have examined mixing scenario in which the crypts - exotic antidecuplet states mix with the respective states in the ground state octet and in the roper octet .",
    "this scenario is motivated by recent experimental results on new narrow nucleon resonance @xmath38 .",
    "its small decay width @xmath236 mev and the fact that @xmath237 ( neutron - like state ) undergoes photoexcitation in @xmath32 meson production and @xmath238 does not , is easily explained if these states are interpreted as members of antidecuplet .",
    "however @xmath38 seems to have very small coupling to the @xmath23 channel and comparatively large one to @xmath29 channel in contradiction to pure su@xmath115(3 ) predictions for these decays .",
    "since roper resonance has very small partial width to @xmath29 one can adjust its mixing angle with @xmath38 to suppress @xmath27 coupling not affecting the @xmath32n one .",
    "we have shown that there exists a small , but stable against variation of the unknown couplings , region in the space of mixing angles where such mechanism is effectively working .",
    "our main result concerning the strange members of antidecuplet is based on the observation that @xmath13-like states have the same mixing angles as the nucleonic states and on the fact that @xmath239 does not mix neither with roper octet nor with the ground state octet .",
    "this allows us to constrain masses of these states and their decay patterns .",
    "before we discuss our results in more detail we want to stress that the mass limits given in eqs.([sigmarange],[xirange ] ) and the decay widths summarized in tab .",
    "[ tablewidths ] should be considered as the qualitative ones .",
    "variations of roper decay constants within the experimental limits and roper @xmath240 parameter would enlarge limits derived in this paper .",
    "also our discussion concerning @xmath52 parameter was only qualitative .",
    "we predict that @xmath12 has a mass around 1815 mev within the limits of eq.([sigmarange ] ) .",
    "there are no known @xmath13 resonances in this energy range @xcite .",
    "total width of @xmath12 does not exceed 30 mev but is also constrained from below being larger that 10 mev .",
    "note that we have calculated total widths by adding all partial widths and 10% for unaccounted three body decays .",
    "most prominent decay channels are @xmath43 and @xmath223 with branching ratios approximately 60% and 20% respectively . due to the mixing su@xmath115(3 ) forbidden decays to decuplet are possible , but small , at the level of 5 to 9% .",
    "the simplest way to detect @xmath12 is its formation in @xmath241 scattering with the kaon beam of @xmath242  gev .",
    "the corresponding resonance cross section is about 5  millibarn .",
    "note , however , that the non - resonant @xmath241 cross - section in this energy region is tens of millibarn .",
    "that requires high statistics experiment and detailed partial wave analysis .",
    "additionally , the small width of predicted @xmath12 demands high energy resolution of the kaon beam .",
    "@xmath12 can be produced in the photoproduction experiments , e.g. in @xmath243 , note however that according to simple estimate based on the u - spin the corresponding production cross section is about three times smaller than the analogous @xmath244 cross section , i.e. very small .",
    "one can reveal the small signal of the @xmath245 processes using its interference with much stronger amplitude of @xmath246 @xcite .",
    "details of possible ways to see @xmath12 in various processes we shall give elsewhere @xcite .    from ( [ xirange ] ) we see that @xmath247 is larger than 1900 mev .",
    "the latter estimate is in disagreement with the result of na49 @xcite .",
    "there is one known three star resonance in the energy range ( [ xirange ] ) , namely @xmath248 of unknown spin and parity @xcite .",
    "however it has isospin @xmath249 and therefore it can not belong to @xmath7 . indeed in ref.@xcite @xmath248 has been attributed to the same octet as @xmath250 .",
    "our results are based on , to some extent arbitrary , assignment of the relative signs of two reduced matrix elements defining decay constants : @xmath204 and @xmath179 .",
    "we have fixed @xmath52 to be negative ( @xmath251 ) in agreement with @xmath14qsm and @xmath179 to be positive ( @xmath252 ) . in fig.[fig : wrong ] we show contour plots corresponding to ( [ conditions ] ) with these phases inverted .",
    "we see that there is no common stable intersection region in the space of mixing angles for @xmath253 or / and @xmath254 .",
    "in fact there is small allowed spot for @xmath200 and @xmath255 , but it is unstable for small variations of these values or conditions ( [ conditions ] ) . finally , in the same figure we present contour plot for large width of @xmath4 where also no allowed region of mixing angles exists .",
    "to conclude : we have proposed a scenario in which roper octet can mix with putative antidecuplet of exotic baryons and predicted the properties of its strange members @xmath12 and @xmath9 .",
