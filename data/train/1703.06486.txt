    "the first explanation ( or rather prediction ) of the power law of primary cosmic ray spectrum made by e. fermi was purely phenomenological : it was based on the exponential growth of energy with time and exponential distribution of ages of observed particles .",
    "both of them ignored the real space - time distribution of sources , highly inhomogeneous structure of the interstellar medium and boundedness of the galaxy .",
    "a few years later , the cr propagation was interpreted as some kind of brownian motion and began to be calculated in terms of the ordinary ( normal ) diffusion theory @xcite .",
    "it is easy to understand the origin of this model : fermi wrote about random walk of cr particles among magnetic clouds chaotically distributed in interstellar space , and brownian motion was the most expressive image of such a process .",
    "however , its mathematical representation in the form of the _ local diffusion _ ( lod ) equation ( or its other local modifications ) did not involve the particle velocity in an explicit form and for this reason failed in description of front propagation and some other pecularities of the cr transport .",
    "this is just the same task which inspired authors of the work @xcite to seek a new propagator in the frame of _ nonlocal diffusion _ ( nod ) model .",
    "we talk here on locality because the generic sign of the diffusion approximation is the local laplace operator @xmath0 .",
    "its application assumes uniformity and mutually independence of points of scattering like those we observe in ideal gases .",
    "no doubt , distribution of irregularities in the interstellar magnetic field do not possess this property , they are linked with each other by means of more or less long magnetic force lines .",
    "these lines are frozen into the material component of interstellar plasma and are involved into the common turbulent motion .",
    "it is rather strange , why the results in turbulent diffusion theory obtained in classical works followed the kolmogorov ( 1941 ) phenomenological basis of the turbulence @xcite were completely ignored in the early development of the cr - propagation theory .",
    "one of the generic features of the turbulent diffusion is the presence of nonlocal operators in its equation .",
    "involvement of non - local operator @xmath1 instead of its local counterpart @xmath2 has shown that in case of a single local pulse source the knee arises without any additional assumptions except the turbulent ( called also _ fractal _ ) character of the interstellar medium . during 2001 - 2010 years",
    ", a series of calculations were performed by lagutin et al . with the use of nod - model , but all results were obtained without account for the relativistic limitation of speed and the boundary conditions .",
    "the speed limitation was inserted into the nod - model in @xcite and this version was later named the _ nonlocal relativistic diffusion _ ( nord ) model @xcite .",
    "the physical interpretation of the nord model and first results obtained in its frame were described in reviews @xcite . here ,",
    "we report some new results of numerical investigations in the frame of this model adding account of multiplicity of sources and boundedness of halo .",
    "modeling of cr sources was performed under following assumptions .    1",
    ".   all sources are isotropic , point and instantaneous with equal powers and energy spectra @xmath3 . here",
    "@xmath4 is an exponent of injection spectrum , and @xmath5 characterizes maximum energies of @xmath6-type nuclei accelerated at supernova remnants .",
    "the sources are separated into two groups : relatively young supernovae ( less than @xmath7 years ) whose space - time coordinates were taken individually ( 15 objects : vela , monogem ring , geminga and others ) , and 30000 sources with spatial distribution generated according to approach proposed in @xcite and used in @xcite .",
    "the radial distribution of discrete sources was simulated according to the density of pulsars ( see @xcite ) , @xmath8 with @xmath9  kpc and @xmath10 , the @xmath11-distribution was modeled by exponential function with @xmath12  pc . to simulate the spiral structure ,",

    "we have used approximate expression for propagators @xmath47 @xmath48 @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the heaviside step function .",
    "it should be noted that zero boundary conditions for nonlocal models are fulfilled approximately , if the mean scattering length of crs much smaller than thickness of the halo . to account for restriction of the diffusion domain ( halo ) , the generalized marshak boundary conditions can be used .",
    "the solutions have been modified by means of the image method . in this approximation , we use @xmath51 instead of @xmath33 in expressions  ( [ eq_nod ] ) and ( [ eq_nod_mc ] ) using procedure ( [ eq_nord ] ) .",
    "we estimated energy spectra accounting for spatial and temporal distribution of supernova remnants and diffusion in halo in frames of four models ( lod , lord , nod , nord ) .",
    "note , that such calculations for the local model were performed in many papers ( see e.g. @xcite ) and for nonlocal model in refs .",
    "all of them , however , utilize propagators ignoring the relativistic speed limit requirement .",
    "relativistic nature of crs sufficiently modify the propagators and spectra as well .",
    "nord - propagators are restricted to domain @xmath52 , have ballistic splash at this boundary whereas in the middle part they are spreading superdiffusively ( remind , that we restrict ourselves by values of superdiffusion parameter @xmath53 $ ] ) .",
    "spallation effects are taken into account according to blasi and amato @xcite using formulae provided in @xcite .              as is known , the standard assumptions about the origin of galactic crs : power law spectra of particles injected by snr , and diffusive propagation throughout the galaxy with a coefficient @xmath36 leads to the spectrum @xmath55 ( from the snr ensemble ) reflecting the balance between injection and escape of crs from the confinement volume . accounting for relativistic restriction ( in terms of relativistic propagators ) steepens the spectrum at high energies , and the position of the spectrum break , its sharpness and slopes of asymptotes depend on @xmath56 and  @xmath57 @xcite .",
    "the cause of this effect is universal and must be kept in mind in all calculations of propagation of high energy crs .",

    "the grey field corresponds to the space - time area containing cr sources which do not take part in the formation of the spectrum due to the relativistic restriction .",
    "their accounting in the ordinary diffusion model leads to a pure power law spectrum @xmath58 under the assumption about the pure power law spectrum of injected particles .",
    "taking the relativistic restriction into account in the nord model excludes automatically these sources and this exclusion affects predominantly on high energy part of crs due to @xmath36 .",
    "it is important to emphasize that , the nord model ( compared to the nod - version used by lagutin et al . ) operates with acceptable values of injection exponent @xmath4 ( @xmath59 ) ( in contrast with @xmath60 , e.g. @xmath61 , in recent calculations by lagutin et al .",

    "the energy of the ` knee ' @xmath62 obtained in nord is very close to provided in @xcite by exponential cut - off of injection spectrum , but we observe power law nord - spectrum above @xmath62 in contrast to exponential decay obtained in  @xcite .",
