    "since the discovery of highly ionized species of iron in the solar corona in the 1930 s , physicists have been puzzled by the high temperatures observed in the outer solar atmosphere @xcite .",

    "soho_. the region was observed to decay in size and complexity as it passed from close to the central meridian on september 10 , to close to the west limb on september 14 . in the photosphere ,",
    "the total sunspot area fell by close to a factor of 2 , while the total magnetic flux fell by approximately a factor of 6 . in the corona , the average electron density , temperature , and pressure all showed similar decreases in value , which is to be expected considering that the plasma in the corona traces out field lines which are ultimately rooted in the photosphere .",
    "these results are of consequence to efforts in understanding active region evolution and the relationship between the photosphere and corona of solar active regions ( e.g. , abbett & fisher 2003 ; ryutova & shine 2004 ) .",
    "in addition to studying active region evolution , cds and mdi were used to investigate the power - law relationships predicted by theoretical models of the corona .",
    "@xcite also investigated theoretical scaling laws using magnetic field extrapolations from both vector and longitudinal magnetograms , in light of the work of @xcite .",
    "they concluded that models involving the gradual stressing of the coronal magnetic field are in better agreement with the observational contrains than are wave heating models .",
    "this same general conclusion was also reached by @xcite using photospheric and coronal measurements from mdi and _ yohkoh_. unfortunately these studies relied on broad - band filter ratios to determine electron temperatures and densities ; the difficulty associated with making such measurements is clear from the contradictory results of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite , who also investigated coronal loop heating models using filter ratios from _ yohkoh_/sxt .",
    "the analysis presented in this paper , on the other hand , is based on well understood line ratio techniques , which offer a less ambiguous determination of plasma properties . with this in mind ,",
    "the power - law relationship between the total heating rate and the total unsigned magnetic flux ( @xmath12 ) was determined , finding a relationship of the form @xmath104 .",
    "@xcite compared the x - ray luminosity ( which was assumed to be some fraction of the total heating power ) to active region vector magnetograms , finding a similar power - law relation of @xmath105 .",
    "the result of @xcite suggests a `` universal '' relationship between magnetic flux and the amount of coronal heating , regardless of the age or complexity of the active region .",
    "a similar relationship of @xmath106 was found using statistical samples of late - type stars @xcite .",
    "the results of this paper therefore lend further observational evidence that active regions are heated by magnetically - associated waves , rather than multiple nanoflare - type events .",

    "<S> similarly to the electron density , there was a small decrease in the average electron temperature over the five day period . </S>",

    "<S> radiative losses were found to dominate the active region cooling process . as the region decayed , the heating rate decreased by almost a factor of five between the first and last day of observations . the heating rate </S>",
    "<S> was then compared to the total unsigned magnetic flux ( @xmath7 ) , yielding a power - law of the form @xmath8 . </S>",
