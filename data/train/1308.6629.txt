    "the breakup of a liquid jet into ever smaller and more complex droplets includes the experimental investigation of the effects of relative sizes of the channels , as well as channel geometry .",
    "an attractive experimental technique is recently addressed for a channel which is shallow compared to its width and length , emptying into a larger channel .",
    "the shallow area forces the jet to become a ribbon rather than a cylinder , and the ribbon remains stable until it flows into a holding tank . in this light",
    ", the suppression of instabilities in multiphase flow by geometric confinement is studied in ref .  , where the experimental work on decreasing the depth of the channel and simplified estimates are compared to conclude that when the depth is sufficiently shallow , the ribbon is stabilized .",
    "this idea is used for a single step emulsification @xcite .    in ref .",
    ", experimental data for step emulsification are compared with a model for the size of the drops that emerge at the step where the ribbon flows into a deeper tank , where the cylindrical necking takes place .",
    "although this is proving to be one of the simplest methods to rapidly produce droplets with controllable sizes and morphologies @xcite , the optimal operating conditions are not entirely understood .",
    "the numerical simulation of a ribbon or jet sheathed in another liquid , pressure - driven and co - flowing through a shallow channel , is a time - dependent simulation because of the kinematic free surface condition , and the solution quickly reaches a steady state .",
    "a first step toward understanding the main features is to take advantage of the smallness of the depth of the channel compared with the other dimensions .",
    "thus , the original governing equations are reduced to the hele - shaw equations .",

    "it is also noted that the pressure distribution inside the drop for @xmath229 is approximately a constant because it should be close to the pressure distribution of an inviscid drop ( @xmath231 ) in a hele - shaw cell which is known to have a steady translational velocity of 2 .",
    "thirdly , figure [ fig : test3-pressure - velocity ] shows the velocity field inside and outside the drop .",

    "we turn to the pressure - driven flow of a jet or ribbon of one fluid co - flowing with a second fluid which is shown in figure [ fig : initial ] , through a channel that is much wider than it is deep . for this flow",
    ", it is possible to make the jet form a tongue at the exit boundary , where the width of the tongue is extremely small .",
    "the production of small droplets , on the order of the depth of the channel , ensues in the reservoir , and is known as capillary focusing . of practical importance is a simple estimate for the jet width @xmath12 at the exit ; ref .",
    "is a first attempt to estimate @xmath12 and compare with the experimental data .",
    "however , capillary focusing occurs at small capillary numbers , and the comparison appears to suffer in this regime , while the comparison for o(1 ) capillary number is satisfactory .",
    "questions arise about the assumptions that are built into their estimate .",
    "this section clarifies this issue by directly interrogating the flow with numerical simulations .",
    "a summary of the main assumptions in the prior estimate@xcite follows :    1 .",
    "the @xmath2-component of the hele - shaw equation without the presence of the interface @xcite is @xmath232 .",
    "this equation is integrated along two streamlines from the inflow to the outflow .",
    "together with the outflow condition @xmath233 , the result is @xmath234 .",
    "the two streamlines are ( i ) along the centerline @xmath235 ( fluid 1 ) , and ( ii ) at the wall @xmath236 ( fluid 2 ) .",
    "subtraction of one equation from the other yields @xmath237 this relates the quantities at outflow to the prescribed inflow quantities , but in order to simplify this further , a decay property is imposed on @xmath238 .",
    "2 .   at the interface between the fluids ,",
    "the jump in the normal stress is balanced by surface tension effects . here , because the depth @xmath16 is small , the in - plane curvature is neglected in comparison with the out - of - plane ( @xmath0-@xmath58 ) value @xmath239 , which originates from the semi - circular diameter .",
    "hence , at inflow , @xmath240 substitution into ( [ eqn : malloggi2 ] ) yields @xmath241 .",
    "thus , the left hand side is a convergent improper integral .",
    "therefore , the integrand must decay sufficiently fast to 0 at the lower end of the integration .",
    "this is taken one step further with the assumption that there is a decay length @xmath242 , defined by @xmath243 .",
    "this leads to a tractable expression @xmath244 this and ( [ eqn : malloggi2 ] ) are equations that link inflow ( prescribed ) and outflow ( unknown ) quantities .",
    "since the interior flow is not known _ a priori _ , a flux conservation is imposed @xmath245 since @xmath145 denotes the width of fluid @xmath9 at inflow , we have @xmath246 . combined with ( [ eqn : malloggi4 ] ) , the unknown outflow velocities are eliminated and we have @xmath247 in terms of the inflow data .",
    "substitution in ( [ eqn : malloggi3 ] ) gives the estimate for @xmath12 .",
    "the final equation is @xmath248 , where @xmath249 and @xmath250 the equivalence of the two formulas follows from @xmath251 .",
    "the usefulness of @xmath252 is limited because it depends on the unknown decay factor @xmath242 .",
    "the estimate becomes @xmath253 4 .",
    "some observations : ( i ) if the interfacial tension is large enough , then @xmath254 , and ( [ eqn : malloggi7a ] ) predicts that @xmath12 decreases at the rate @xmath255 .",
    "( ii ) if the interfacial tension is small , then @xmath256 and ( [ eqn : malloggi7a ] ) predicts that @xmath12 is the same as the inflow width : @xmath257 .",
    "indeed , any reasonable estimate must predict that the interface becomes flatter through the domain with increasing @xmath252 .",
