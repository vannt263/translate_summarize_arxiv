    "in addition to conventional hadrons , qcd suggests the existence of states containing excited glue , such as glueballs and hybrid hadrons . although conventional hadrons are reasonably well described by the constituent quark model , states comprised of gluonic excitations",
    "are still poorly understood . as experiments begin to focus on the search for glueballs and hybrid mesons , a better understanding of these states",
    "is needed .",
    "lattice qcd simulations presently offer the best means of achieving this goal .",
    "a great advantage in studying hybrid mesons comprised of heavy quarks is that such systems can be studied not only by direct numerical simulation , but also using the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) expansion . in this approach ,",
    "the hybrid meson is treated analogous to a diatomic molecule : the slow heavy quarks correspond to the nuclei and the fast gluon field corresponds to the electrons[1 ] .",
    "first , one treats the quark @xmath0 and antiquark @xmath1 as spatially - fixed colour sources and determines the energy levels of the glue as a function of the @xmath2 separation @xmath3 ; each of these energy levels defines an adiabatic potential @xmath4 .",
    "the quark motion is then restored by solving the schrdinger equation in each of these potentials .",
    "conventional quarkonia are based on the lowest - lying static potential ; hybrid quarkonium states emerge from the excited potentials . once the static potentials have been determined ( via lattice simulations )",
    ", it is a simple matter to determine the complete conventional and hybrid quarkonium spectrum in the leading born - oppenheimer ( lbo ) approximation .",
    "this is a distinct advantage over meson simulations which yield only the very lowest - lying states , often with large statistical uncertainties .    here , we present results for the spectrum of gluonic excitations in the presence of a static quark - antiquark pair .",
    "this study is the first to comprehensively survey the spectrum in su(3 ) gauge theory . using our potentials",
    ", we also determine the hybrid quarkonium spectrum .",
    "the first step in the born - oppenheimer expansion is the determination of the energy levels of the gluons in the presence of the quark and antiquark , fixed in space some distance @xmath3 apart . at this point in the approximation ,",
    "the quark and antiquark simply act as static colour sources .",
    "the gluonic energies ( or static potentials ) may be labelled by the magnitude ( denoted by @xmath5 ) of the projection of the total angular momentum of the gluons onto the molecular axis , by the sign of this projection ( chirality or handedness ) , and by the behaviour under the combined operations of charge conjugation and spatial inversion about the midpoint between the quark and the antiquark .",
    "states with @xmath6 are typically denoted by the capital greek letters @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "states which are even ( odd ) under the above - mentioned parity  charge - conjugation operation are denoted by the subscripts @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the energy of the gluons is unaffected by reflections in a plane containing the molecular axis ; since such a reflection interchanges states of opposite handedness , such states must necessarily be degenerate ( @xmath5 doubling ) .",
    "however , this doubling does not apply to the @xmath10 states ; @xmath10 states which are even ( odd ) under a reflection in a plane containing the molecular axis are denoted by a superscript @xmath11 @xmath12 .",
    "hence , the low - lying levels are labelled @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 , and so on .",
    "= 4.0 in    static potentials were extracted from monte carlo estimates of generalized wilson loops ; some of our results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : sigma ] ( for a complete presentation of our results , see ref .",
    "the results are expressed in terms of the hadronic scale parameter @xmath21 .",
    "the definition of this parameter and a description of its calculation are given in ref .",
    "the familiar static potential is shown as @xmath13 .",
    "for all @xmath3 studied , the first - excited potential is the @xmath18 ; hence , the lowest lying hybrid mesons should be based on this potential .",
    "as @xmath3 becomes very large , the linearly rising @xmath13 potential suggests that the ground state of the glue may be modelled as a fluctuating tube of colour flux ; in this picture , the gluonic excitations are expected to be phonon - like with energy gaps proportional to @xmath22 .",
    "however , it appears that for @xmath3 below about @xmath23 fm , the gluonic spectrum can not be explained in terms of a simple string model . in ref .",
    "[ 1 ] , a qcd motivated bag model was successfully used to describe both the @xmath13 and @xmath18 potentials for this range of @xmath3 . in this picture , the strong chromoelectric fields of the quark and antiquark repel the physical vacuum ( dual meissner effect ) , creating a bubble inside which perturbation theory is applicable . in the ground state , the inward pressure on the bubble from the physical vacuum balances the outward chromostatic force in such a way to produce a linearly confining potential .",
    "the addition of one or more transverse gluons into the bag produces the excited potentials ; the kinetic energy of the gluons inside the bubble is a key factor in determining the form of these potentials .",
    "this model has recently been revisited and results ( in the ellipsoidal approximation ) for almost all of the potentials studied here are in remarkable agreement with our findings from the lattice simulations ( see ref .  [ 4 ] ) .",
    "the next step in the bo expansion is to restore the quark motion by solving the radial schrdinger equation using the static potentials .",
    "results for the @xmath24 spectrum are shown in  fig .",
    "[ fig : spectrum ] .",
    "the heavy quark mass @xmath25 was tuned in order to reproduce the experimentally - known @xmath26 mass : @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the energy of the lowest - lying state in the @xmath13 potential . in the lbo approximation ,",
    "many mesons of different @xmath29 are degenerate , such as @xmath30,@xmath31,@xmath32,@xmath33,@xmath34,@xmath35 from the @xmath18 potential . below the @xmath36 threshold ,",
    "the lbo results are in very good agreement with the spin - averaged experimental measurements .",
    "note that these results make use of the quenched potentials ( which ignore the light quarks ) and do not include spin , retardation , and other relativistic effects . above the threshold ,",
    "agreement with experiment is lost , suggesting significant corrections from either the light quarks , relativistic effects , or possibly mixings between the states from the different adiabatic potentials .",
    "note that the mass of the lowest - lying hybrid ( from the @xmath18 potential ) is about 10.8  gev . above 11 gev ,",
    "the lbo approximation based on the quenched @xmath37 potentials predicts a very dense population of hybrid states .",
    "a first comprehensive survey of the spectrum of quenched su(3 ) gluonic excitations in the presence of a static @xmath2 pair was presented .",
    "the hybrid quarkonium states were calculated in the leading born - oppenheimer approximation .",
