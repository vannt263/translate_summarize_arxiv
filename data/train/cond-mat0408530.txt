    "the general variation of the shift with temperature follows the expected behavior of an @xmath10 haf chain , as seen in the results section .",
    "a steep decrease in @xmath9 was observed below @xmath164 for sr@xmath0cu(po@xmath1)@xmath2 , @xmath165 for ba@xmath2cu(po@xmath1)@xmath2 and @xmath166 for bacup@xmath2o@xmath3.@xcite this decrease of @xmath63 is clearly much more than the logarithmic decrease with an infinite slope at zero temperature , expected from theory ( see solid line in fig .",

    "in such a case , the spin susceptibility ( and therefore the spin shift ) should vanish at @xmath200 .",
    "however , our extrapolated @xmath200 shifts are much more than the chemical shifts @xmath172 and there is no exponential decrease of @xmath22 toward low temperatures .",
    "another possibility is the onset of 3d lro . in this case",
    ", a divergence should have been seen in the temperature dependencies of the spin - lattice relaxation rate @xmath18 as well as in the spin - spin relaxation rate @xmath34 . while this is the case for bacup@xmath2o@xmath3 , only a small increase of the relaxation rates",

    "however , in the case of sr@xmath0cu(po@xmath1)@xmath2 and ba@xmath2cu(po@xmath1)@xmath2 , while a clear anomaly is seen in @xmath9 at low - temperature , only a weak anomaly is seen in @xmath22 and no significant changes were observed either in the low - temperature spectra or in @xmath23 . in summary , the presence or absence of lro at low - temperatures in sr@xmath2cu(po@xmath1)@xmath2 and ba@xmath2cu(po@xmath1)@xmath2 , ca nt be unambiguously established .      from field - theory and monte carlo calculations , eggert and affleck@xcite found that in case of half - integer spin chains , the local susceptibility near an open end of a finite chain has a large alternating component .",
    "this component appears in the form of staggered magnetization near chain ends , under the influence of an uniform field .",

    "these features on either side of the central peak disappear and @xmath216 ( where @xmath217 is the width at the background and h@xmath218 is the field at the central peak ) remain constant with temperature . this has been seen by takigawa @xcite in @xmath219cu nmr spectra of sr@xmath2cuo@xmath41 .",
    "however , the static effects of the staggered magnetization at the @xmath4p site in our compounds are expected to be  much weaker ( fig .",
    "9 ) due to the near cancellation of the magnetization from the neighboring cu sites .    our low - temperature spectra for sr@xmath2cu(po@xmath1)@xmath2 and ba@xmath0cu(po@xmath1)@xmath2 show a single spectral line without any shoulders on either sides of the central peak .",
    "this is in agreement with our expectations that we are not sensitive to chain - end effects in @xmath4p nmr spectra  of these compounds .    in low - field nmr on bacup@xmath2o@xmath3 , a sudden increase of linewidth was observed below @xmath20 k along with appearance of two shoulder - like features located symmetrically on either side of the central peak ( fig.6(d ) ) .",
    "if these shoulder - like features come from the staggered magnetization of chain ends then , as discussed above , @xmath216 should be temperature independent with the shoulders moving outwards at lower temperatures .",
    "but in bacup@xmath2o@xmath3 the shoulder positions are temperature independent , suggesting that those features are not chain - end effects .",
    "further , in case of a structural phase transition , symmetrically located features which become more intense as temperature is lowered are not expected .",
    "our data are consistent with an alternating magnetization in the cu chain .",
    "further , the magnitude of this magnetization must have a maximum away from the chain end ( so as to produce the symmetric features ) and the location ( site @xmath220 ) of the maximum must not change with @xmath16 ( as the shoulder positions are temperature independent ) . as shown before ,",
    "the chain - end induced effects are expected to be negligible at @xmath4p site .",
    "the large effect seen here must stem from a magnetic transition possibly with exotic spin - order .      in order to study the microscopic behavior of 1d haf systems ,",
    "it is useful to measure the temperature dependence of spin - lattice relaxation rate which yields information on the imaginary part of the dynamic susceptibility @xmath222 .",
    "the spin - lattice relaxation rate , in general , is affected by both uniform @xmath223 and staggered spin fluctuations @xmath224 .",
    "the uniform component leads to @xmath225 , while the staggered component gives @xmath18 = constant.@xcite at the @xmath4p sites , @xmath226-dependence of @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of form factors as , @xmath227 \\operatorname{im}\\chi\\left (   q,\\omega\\right)\\ ] ]    we are probing on the @xmath4p nucleus , which is linked to the cu spins via o(1 ) and o(2 ) as shown in fig .",
    "since @xmath4p is symmetrically located between the cu ions , the antiferromagnetic fluctuations are filtered at the @xmath4p site , provided the two hyperfine couplings are equal .",
    "however , contributions just slightly differing from @xmath228 are apparently strong enough and/or the two hyperfine couplings are unequal and result in a qualitative behavior expected when relaxation is dominated by fluctuations of the staggered susceptibility .",
    "if one were to ignore the geometrical form factor completely , the relaxation rate due to staggered fluctuations can be calculated following the prescription of barzykin@xcite .",
    "he obtained the normalized dimensionless nmr spin - lattice relaxation rate at low - temperature @xmath229 , where @xmath230 is @xmath231 . assuming the fluctuations to be correlated , @xmath18 can be written as @xmath232 . using this expression , @xmath112 at the @xmath4p site",

    "an estimate of the nuclear dipole - dipole mediated relaxation @xmath258 would seem to explain the observed relaxation rates .",
