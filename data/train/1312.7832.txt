    "in classical logic , _ material implication _ or _ material conditional _ is defined by negation and disjunction . specifically , `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' [ ole_link3][ole_link4]or `` _ _ p _ _ implies _ q _ '' is defined as `` not _ p _ or _",
    ", i.e. , _ p _ @xmath0 _ q _ @xmath1 @xmath2__p _ _ @xmath3 _ q_. it is well known that this definition is problematic in that it leads to `` paradoxes '' such as    \\1 ) @xmath2__p _ _ @xmath0 ( _ p _ @xmath0 _ q _ ) ( a false proposition implies any proposition ) ,    \\2 ) _ p _ @xmath0 ( _ q _ @xmath0 _ p _ ) ( a true proposition is implied by any proposition ) , and    \\3 ) ( _ p _ @xmath0 _ q _ ) @xmath3 ( _ q _ @xmath0 _ p _ ) ( for any two propositions , at least one implies the other ) .    these formulas can be easily proved as tautologies in classical logic with the _ rule of replacement _ for material implication , i.e. , replacing _",
    "@xmath0 _ q _ with @xmath2__p _",
    "_ @xmath3 _ q_. but these tautologies are counterintuitive so they are called `` paradoxes '' of material implication in classical logic .",
    "there are many such paradoxes , see , e.g. , ( bronstein , 1936 ) , and ( lojko , 2012 ) where lists sixteen `` paradoxes '' of material implication .    it should be noted that some paradoxes of material implication are even worse than `` paradoxical '' because they are actually wrong .",
    "let us take ( _ p _ @xmath0 _ q _ ) @xmath3 ( _ q _ @xmath0 _ p _ ) as an example . using the rule of replacement _ p _ @xmath0 _ q _",
    "= @xmath2__p _ _ @xmath3 _ q _ ( where the equals sign denotes logical equivalence , see 1.2 ) , we have ( _ p _ @xmath0 _ q _ ) @xmath3 ( _ q _ @xmath0 _ p _ ) = ( @xmath2__p _ _ @xmath3 _ q _ ) @xmath3 ( @xmath2__q _ _ @xmath3 _ p _ ) = @xmath2__p _ _ @xmath3 ( _ q _ @xmath3 @xmath2__q _ _ ) @xmath3 _ p _ = @xmath2__p _ _ @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath3 _ p _",
    "@xmath5 @xmath4 .",
    "thus , ( _ p _ @xmath0 _ q _ ) @xmath3 ( _ q _ @xmath0 _ p _ ) is a tautology , meaning that for any propositions _",
    "p _ and _ q _ , it must be that `` _ _ p _ _ implies _ q _ '' or `` _ _ q _ _ implies _ p _ '' ( or both ) .",
    "this is absurd since it is possible that it is not the case even if _ p _ and _ q _ are `` relevant '' .",
    "for instance , suppose _",
    "n _ is an integer , let _",
    "`` _ _ n _ _ = 1 '' and _ q _",
    "@xmath1 `` _ _",
    "n _ _ = 0 '' , then , since ( _ p _ @xmath0 _ q _ ) @xmath3 ( _ q _ @xmath0 _ p _ ) is a tautology , it must be that `` if _ n _ = 1 then _ n _ = 0 '' is true or `` if _ n _ = 0 then _ n _ = 1 '' is true ( or both are true ) , and this is an absurdity .",
    "many efforts has been made to resolve this problem such as _ relevance logic _ which requires that antecedent and consequent be relevant , _ modal logic _ which uses concept of strict implication , _ intuitionistic logic _ which rejects the law of excluded middle , and _ inquisitive logic _",
    "( see , e.g. , ( ciardelli & roelofsen , 2011 ) ) which considers inquisitive semantics of sentences rather than just their descriptive aspects .",
    "these developments of non - classical logic are important to modern logics and other disciplines__. _ _",
    "however , classical logic exists on its own reason , and we are reluctant to discard it , see e.g. ( fulda , 1989 ) . indeed , classical logic , with its natural principles such as the law of excluded middle , is not only fundamental , but also simple and useful .",
    "classical logic is an important part of logic education , so it has been an essential part of most logic textbooks . on the other hand ,",
    "_ implication is a kernel concept in logic_. so it is not satisfying that the both simple and useful classical logic has an unnatural and even wrong definition of material implication appeared in many textbooks .",
    "therefore , the motivation of this work is to improve the definition of implication to replace that of the material implication in classical logic , so that 1 ) it is `` natural '' and `` correct '' , 2 ) it keeps the system still `` simple '' , and 3 ) it keeps the classical logic still as `` useful '' . in order to satisfy the second requirement",
    ", this work uses only concepts that already exist in classical logic rather than use those as specifically introduced in non - classical logics like relevance logic , modal logic , intuitionistic logic , many - valued logic , probabilistic logic , etc .",
    "the third requirement is to prevent developing `` too narrow '' a definition of implication , as bronstein ( 1936 ) commented on e. j. nelson s `` intensional logic '' : `` although his system does avoid the ` paradoxes ' , it does so only by unduly narrowing his conception of implication . ''",
    "although classical logics include at least propositional and first - order logic , this work concentrates on classical _ propositional logic _",
    ", as the relevant concepts are the same .      there may exist different notations for one thing .",
    "for example , @xmath6 _ @xmath7 _ @xmath8 _ @xmath9 _ , @xmath6 _ @xmath7 _ @xmath10 _ @xmath9 _ , _ @xmath7 _ @xmath10 _ @xmath9 _ , _ @xmath7 _ = _ @xmath9 _ , and _ @xmath7 _ @xmath5 _ @xmath9",
    "_ may all mean _ logical equivalence _ between _",
    "@xmath7 _ and _ @xmath9 _ ( i.e. , they have the same truth - value in every model ) , which can also be denoted with the unicode symbol `` left and right double turnstile '' ( u+27da ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a notation may denotes different things .",
    "for instance , the equals sign ` = ' has a variety of usages in different contexts . to prevent ambiguities ,",
    "the usage of some important notions in this work is explained as follows .",
    "@xmath7 _ and _ @xmath9 _ are _ well - formed formulas _",
    "( hereinafter just referred to as formulas ) in a formal language .",
    "the _ equals sign _ ` = ' is used to denote logical equivalence in a logical equation like the form _ @xmath7 _ = _ @xmath9 _ that need not to be a tautology ( it may be just a condition or is conditional ) as in a derivation .",
    "the _ identical to _ symbol ` @xmath5 ' is used to denote logical equivalence in a tautology like the form _",
    "@xmath7 _ @xmath5 _",
    "@xmath9 _ , or used in derivations to emphasize that _ @xmath7 _ = _ @xmath9 _ is a tautology .",
    "the symbols ` @xmath11 ' and ` @xmath12 ' are used to denote the complementary cases of ` = ' and ` @xmath5 ' , respectively .",
    "for example , if _ @xmath7 _ = @xmath2__@xmath9 _ _ , then @xmath2__@xmath7 _ _",
    "= @xmath2@xmath2_@xmath9 _ @xmath5 _ @xmath9_. the equals sign ` = ' is of special importance in this work to denote , e.g. , `` conditional '' logical equivalence as explained .",
    "the symbol ` @xmath0 ' is used to denote both traditional material implication and the implication relation defined in this work .",
    "the other symbols are used conventionally and unambiguously without explanation . for instance , ` @xmath6[ole_link140][ole_link141 ] ' and ` @xmath13 ' are used to denote `` logically implies ( is logical consequence of ) '' and `` not logically imply ( is not logical consequence of ) '' , respectively ; ` @xmath4 ' denotes any tautology and ` @xmath14 ' denotes any contradiction , etc .",
    "the definition of material implication in classical logic is based on that , for propositions _",
    "p _ and _ q _ , `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' or `` _ _ p _ _ implies _ q _ '' is logically equivalent to `` it is false that _ p _ and not _",
    "q _ '' , and the latter again is logically equivalent to `` not _ p _ or",
    "it is this `` logical equivalence '' that leads to the definition _",
    "@xmath0 _ q _ @xmath1 @xmath2__p _ _ @xmath3 _ q _ and hence the _ rule of replacement _ _ p _ @xmath0 _ q _",
    "= @xmath2__p _ _ @xmath3 _ q _ for material implication .",
    "this definition makes the material implication a _ truth - functional _ connective , i.e. , the truth - value of the compound proposition _",
    "@xmath0 _ q _ is a function of the truth - values of its sub - propositions .",
    "this means that the truth - value of `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' is determined solely by the combination of truth - values of _ p _ and _ q_. this is unnatural as shown in the following .",
    "\\1 ) when we know that _ p _ is true and _ q _ is true , can we decide that `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' is true ( or false ) ?",
    "no , not sure .",
    "\\2 ) when we know that _ p _ is true and _ q _ is false , can we decide that `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' is true ( or false ) ?",
    "yes , we can decide that it must be false .",
    "\\3 ) when we know that _",
    "p _ is false and _ q _ is true , can we decide that `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' is true ( or false ) ?",
    "no , not sure .",
    "\\4 ) when we know that _",
    "p _ is false and _ q _ is false , can we decide that `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' is true ( or false ) ?",
    "no , not sure .    in only one case , namely the second one , the truth - value of the compound proposition `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' can be determined by the truth - value combination of _ p _ and _ q_. this indicates that `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' is not logically equivalent to `` not _ p _ or _ q _ '' of which the truth - value is solely determined by the truth - value combination of _ p _ and _ q_. on the other hand , since `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' is surely false when _ p _ is true and _ q _ is false , it suggests that when `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' is true it must not be the case that _ p _ is true and _ q _ is false ( which is equivalent to `` not _ p _ or _",
    "q _ '' ) .    thus , it should be that `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' logically implies `` not _ p _ or _ q _ '' but not vice versa , so that _ p _ @xmath0 _ q _ @xmath12 @xmath2__p _ _ @xmath3 _ q _ since _ p _ @xmath0 _ q _ @xmath6 @xmath2__p _ _ @xmath3 _ q _ but @xmath2__p _ _ @xmath3 _ q_. @xmath13 _ p _ @xmath0 _ q_. some researchers have already pointed out , or addressed the problem , although they might have different motivations or explained it in different ways , such as maccoll ( 1880 ) , bronstein ( 1936 ) , woods ( 1967 ) , dale ( 1974 ) , and lojko ( 2012 ) .",
    "therefore , the definition of material implication in classical logic is not only unnatural but also , even more severely , not correct .",
    "this is why it leads to some unacceptable results as exemplified in introduction . the use of the ( mistaken ) equivalence _ p _ @xmath0 _ q",
    "_ = @xmath2__p _ _ @xmath3 _ q _ makes the classical logic unfortunately defective .      in classical logic , `` not _ p _ '' , `` _ _ p _ _ and _ q _ '' , `` _ _ p _ _ or _ q _ '' , and `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' are all viewed as the same kind of compound sentences formed with operations or functions , called `` logical connectives '' or `` logical operators '' . however , `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' is actually different .",
    "essentially , `` implication '' should not be viewed as an operation but a relation . in mathematics ,",
    "1 + 2 is an expression formed by an operation while `` 1 @xmath15 2 '' is a sentence formed by a relation .",
    "we can not say that a mathematical expression like 1 + 2 is `` true '' or `` false '' , while we can say that a mathematical sentence like 1 @xmath15 2 is `` true '' .",
    "so , in mathematics , usually a function expression has no truth - value while a relation expression has . in propositional logic ,",
    "a function expression such as @xmath2__p _ _ , _ p _ @xmath16 _ q _ or _ p _ @xmath3 _ q _ , unlike their mathematical counterpart , does have a truth - value , but this is because the output of such a function happens to be a proposition that has a truth - value itself .",
    "in contrast , when we say that _ p _ @xmath0 _ q _ is `` true '' or `` false '' , we concern about the implication `` @xmath0 '' itself being `` true '' or `` false '' .",
    "this intuition indicates that implication is a relation rather than a function .",
    "so , a relation expression is a `` higher level '' sentence than a function expression which if it happens to be a sentence .    therefore , it is natural and important to view implication as a relation rather than an operation or function , and of course , the relation to represent the implication is not truth - functional ( woods , 1967 ) .",
    "let us now analyze possible relations between any two propositions _",
    "p _ and _ q_. there are three distinct cases as shown using venn diagram in figure 2.2.1 , where the square ` @xmath4 ' represents `` set of all interpretations '' , the circle ` _ _ p _ _ ' represents `` set of interpretations that make _ p _ true '' , and the circle ` _ _ q _ _ ' represents `` set of interpretations that make _ q _ true '' .",
    "thus , we have    case 1 `` disjoint '' that is characterized by the equation _ p _ @xmath16 _ q _ = @xmath14 ;    case 2 `` joint '' that is characterized by the equations",
    "@xmath16 _ q _ @xmath11 @xmath14 , _ p _ @xmath16 _ q _ @xmath11 _ p _ , and _",
    "@xmath16 _ q _ @xmath11 _ q _ ; and    case 3 `` inclusion '' that is characterized by the equation _",
    "@xmath16 _ q _ = _ p_.        the three cases are mutually exclusive except for trivial circumstances such as that _ p _ or _",
    "q _ equals to @xmath14 or @xmath4 .",
    "let us focus on case 3 characterized by _",
    "@xmath16 _ q _ = _ p_. in this case , whenever _",
    "p _ is true _",
    "q _ must be true , so it is just the case that `` if _ p _ then _ q _ '' .",
    "therefore , it indicates that we can use _",
    "@xmath16 _ q _ = _ p _ to define the implication , noting that _ r _ @xmath1 \\{(_p _ , _ q _ ) @xmath17 _ p _ @xmath16 _ q _ = _ p _ } is a binary relation on the set of propositions .",
