    "clusters of galaxies represent the largest virialized structures in the present universe , formed at relatively late times .",
    "they are an optimal place to test the predictions of cosmological simulations regarding the mass profile of dark halos . in this respect",
    "their x - ray emission can be successfully used to constrain the mass profile in relaxed systems , where the emitting plasma is expected to be in hydrostatic equilibrium @xcite .",
    "besides this method , gravitational lensing provides an opportunity to measure the cluster masses without invoking the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium implicit in the x - ray based mass determinations @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , since lensing is sensitive to the integrated mass contrast along the line of sight , it is natural to expect mass overestimates due to fortuitous alignments with mass concentrations which are not physically related to the galaxy cluster or departures of the dm halo from spherical symmetry @xcite .",
    "so far most studies of both dark matter ( dm ) and intra - cluster medium ( icm ) on galaxy clusters have been limited to the standard spherical geometry , i.e. the length scales along the line of sight are taken as the spherical radii measured on the plane of the sky .",
    "first , the spatial resolution of chandra and xmm - newton x - ray satellites with their high sensitivity and large collecting area has allowed to resolve the core of the clusters , and have detected departures from isothermality and spherical geometry of the icm and dm : for example evidence for a flattened triaxial dark matter halo around five abell galaxy clusters has been reported by @xcite .",
    "second , numerical simulations predicts that dm halos show axis ratios typically of the order of @xmath6 @xcite , disproving the spherical geometry assumption .",
    "third , since lensing is sensitive to the integrated mass contrast along the line of sight , departures from the spherical assumption can justify the long - standing discrepancy between galaxy cluster masses determined from x - ray and strong gravitational lensing observations @xcite , the latter being significantly higher than the former : since cluster mass measurements are sensitive to the assumptions about symmetry , this suggests that clusters with prominent strong lensing features are not spherically symmetric and preferentially elongated along the line of sight increasing the magnitude of the lensing .",
    "the galaxy cluster a1689 is a well - studied example of a cluster showing this mass discrepancy @xcite .",
    "while galaxy clusters are one of the key cosmological probes , this hinges on our ability to accurately determine both mass and shapes of clusters .",
    "an accurate knowledge of the intrinsic cluster shape is required to constrain structure formation models via observations of clusters .",
    "asphericity in the gas density distribution of clusters of galaxies is crucial in modeling x - ray morphologies and in using clusters as cosmological tools @xcite .",
    "previous attempts to infer the elongation of the icm in galaxy clusters through a comparison between x - ray and sunyaev zeldovich ( sz ) observations ( see , for example , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) relied on simple @xmath7-model parameterizations of the surface brightness profiles and on the isothermality of the same icm . while these works suggested departures of the icm from the standard spherical modeling ,",
    "their prescriptions are subject to limitations implied in this modeling of the icm .    in the last few years the theoretical understanding of dm halos has also improved . while spherically averaged density profiles of dm halos are well fitted by a universal dm density profile @xcite , non - spherical effects on the mass function of dark halos have been studied in detail with numerical simulations @xcite . in particular",
    "the work of @xcite derived analytical solutions for gas embedded in triaxial halos on basis of perturbation theory , and they recovered hydrostatic solutions for the gas density and temperature profiles both for the isothermal and the polytropic equation of state .",
    "they also showed that the icm and dm halos are well approximated by a sequence of concentric triaxial distributions with different eccentricity ratio , which has been inferred analytically .    given that we observe just the two - dimensional projected properties of galaxy clusters on the plane of the sky and any information along the line of sight",
    "is lost in the process of projection , it is in general impossible to derive the intrinsic three - dimensional shape of an astronomical object from a single observation .",
    "however , one can overcome the previous limitation by combining observations in different wavelengths . in this paper",
    "we propose a new method where we compute general three - dimensional hydrostatic equilibrium solutions of the intra - cluster gas under the gravity of triaxial dark matter halos in a non - parametric way and by combining x - ray and lensing data . indeed without any assumption for models on the gas density and ( deprojected ) temperature profile , we assume that the triaxial dm density profile is well described by an analytical model ( the generalized navarro , frenk & white model , hereafter gnfw ) . thanks to the results of numerical simulations , we know , indeed , sufficiently well the dm physics , which is in fact very simple , only depending on the gravity , unlike the physics of the baryons , which is also affected by sources of non - gravitational energy .",
    "moreover we have removed the observational biases in the determination of the deprojected temperature ( and consequently of the mass ) by adopting the spectral - like temperature estimator ( see sect . [ depr ] ) . in this way",
    "we have a bias - free estimate of the deprojected temperature and , therefore , of the cluster mass .    in the present paper we aim at describing both the theoretical aspects of the problem and astrophysical applications on a case study , the galaxy cluster macsj1423.8 + 2404 ( hereafter macsj1423 ) .",
    "this is a massive cool - core galaxy cluster at @xmath8 which does not show any significant sign of disturbance in its morphology and it appears to be very relaxed @xcite .",
    "the study of @xcite proved that there is discrepancy between the 2d x - ray mass recovered under the assumption of the standard spherical geometry and the observed surface mass profile from lensing data , the former being systematically lower than the latter . in this perspective , motivated by the need to improve our knowledge of the 3d physical properties of gas and dm in galaxy clusters and , especially , to understand how the 3d geometry will affect the estimated masses , we believe that macsj1423 is a optimal target for our analysis .",
    "in particular , we will combine x - ray , strong ( sl ) and weak ( wl ) lensing data in order to infer the geometry , physical parameters and distribution of the icm and dm , which is a fundamental question in bound systems ( galaxies , galaxy clusters , dark matter halos ) that form in an expanding universe , as well as to determine of the inner slope of the dm , since the cuspiness of dark - matter density profiles in the central regions is one of the critical tests of the cold dark matter ( cdm ) paradigm for structure formation @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sect .",
    "[ datdd1 ] we present a model for the three - dimensional structure of galaxy clusters and how to constrain the 3d icm and dm shape . in sect .",

    "hereafter we have assumed a flat @xmath9 cosmology , with matter density parameter @xmath10 , cosmological constant density parameter @xmath11 , and hubble constant @xmath12 .",
    "unless otherwise stated , we estimated the errors at the 68.3 per cent confidence level .",
    "in order to infer the model parameters of both the icm and of the underlying dm density profile , we perform a joint analysis for strong+weak lensing and x - ray data . indeed the lensing and the x - ray emission",
    "both depends on the properties of the dm gravitational potential well , the former being a direct probe of the projected mass profile and the latter an indirect proxy of the mass profile through the hydrostatic equilibrium equation applied on the gas and temperature density .",
    "in this perspective we outline the methodology in order to infer physical properties in triaxial galaxy clusters .",
    "the general idea is straightforward : a ) we start with a triaxial dm density model as described in @xcite , which is representative of the total underlying mass distribution and depends on a few parameters to be determined , namely the concentration parameter @xmath13 , the scale radius @xmath14 and the inner slope of the dm @xmath2 b ) following @xcite , we recover the gravitational potential and surface mass profile @xmath15 of a dark halo with such triaxial density profile c ) we solve the hydrostatic equilibrium equation for the density of the icm sitting in the gravitational potential well previously calculated , in order to infer a theoretical three - dimensional temperature profile @xmath16 in a non - parametric way 4 ) the joint comparison of @xmath16 with the observed temperature and of @xmath15 with the observed surface mass give us the parameters of the triaxial dm density model , and therefore all the desired physical properties of icm and dm triaxial ellipsoids ( see fig .",
    "1 ) .    we start by describing in sect .",
    "[ datdd2 ] the adopted triaxial dm density and gravitational potential model , focusing on the relation between elongation of icm and dm ellipsoids . in sect .",
    "[ datdd2y ] we present a toy problem in order to outline the effect of triaxiality on the physical observables .      in the present study ,",
    "to parametrize the cluster mass distribution , we consider a triaxial generalized nfw model gnfw @xcite : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the scale length , @xmath19 is the dimensionless characteristic density contrast with respect to the critical density @xmath20 of the universe at the present epoch , and @xmath2 represents the inner slope of the density profile ; @xmath21 is the critical density of the universe at redshift @xmath22 , @xmath23 , @xmath24^{1/2}$ ] , and @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the concentration parameter , @xmath14 is the scale radius , @xmath27 .",
    "the radius @xmath28 can be regarded as the the major axis length of the iso - density surfaces : @xmath29    the ellipsoidal shape of a _ halo _ iso - density surface has been evaluated by defining the two eccentricities : @xmath30 and @xmath31 implies @xmath32 .",
    "the values of @xmath33 ( @xmath34 ) measure the degree of the deviation of the ellipsoidal iso - density surfaces from the spherical ones along the corresponding principal axis direction .",
    "the gravitational potential of a dark halo with the triaxial density profile ( eqn .",
    "[ aa33344 ] ) can be written as a complex implicit integrals @xcite . while numerical integration is required in general to obtain the triaxial gravitational potential , small eccentricities ( @xmath35 ) expected in cluster scale halos enable to approach this problem with the perturbative expansion and to infer analytical solutions .",
    "there are mainly two different ways to perform the ellipsoidal perturbation , the equal - volume and the equal - length approach . in the former",
    "the perturbed ellipsoids have the same volumes as the unperturbed original spheres ; in the latter the perturbed ellipsoids and the unperturbed spheres have the same length scales , i.e. the major ( minor ) axes of the perturbed ellipsoids will be coincident with the radius of the unperturbed sphere .",
    "@xcite developed the equal - length perturbation theory in order to provide an ellipsoidal correction to the standard spherical modeling of the observed clusters . while in the standard spherical model the length scale in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight is taken as the spherical tangential radii , i.e. measured on the plane of the sky , in their ellipsoidal model this tangential length scale is no longer the same as the line of sight length .",
    "their equal - length perturbative expansion provides a framework which can be observationally more constrained than the equal - volume one because , for example , in sz observations the cluster length scales in the direction perpendicular to the line of sight are measured @xcite .",
    "here we briefly summarize the findings of @xcite relevant for this study . assuming a triaxial gnfw model for the dm ( eqn .",

    "@xmath51 being an order of magnitude smaller than @xmath52 and @xmath53 , it can be neglected in most of the applications .",
    "@xcite found that iso - potential surfaces of triaxial dm halos are still best well approximated as ellipsoids and they model the iso - potential surfaces as triaxial ellipsoids with the rescaled major axis length , @xmath54 , and the two eccentricities , @xmath55 and @xmath56 : @xmath57 , \\ ] ] and that the eccentricities of iso - potential surfaces @xmath58 are written in terms of their halo eccentricities @xmath33 as @xmath59 notice that @xmath60 unlike the constant @xmath61 for the adopted dark matter halo profile . in the whole range of @xmath62",
    ", @xmath63 is less than unity ( @xmath64 at the center ) , and decreases mildly as @xmath62 increases .",
    "this means that the intra - cluster gas is more spherical in the outer volumes than in the center , and it is altogether more spherical than the underlying dm halo .",
    "this is intuitively understood because the potential represents the overall average of the local density profile , and also because the gas pressure is isotropic unlike the possible anisotropic velocity ellipsoids for collisionless dark matter .",
    "strictly speaking , equation ( [ eqn : ecc18 ] ) is valid only for @xmath65 .",
    "this mathematical demand is just partially in agreement with the ellipticity expected for cluster scale halos : the intermediate - major and minor - intermediate axis ratios of halos are typically of the order of @xmath6 @xcite . in this perspective",

    "@xcite ; the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( [ aa2e ] ) yields @xmath73      in order to understand how an elongation of the icm and dm can be constrained by real observations , we present a simple toy problem and we analyze the effect of triaxiality on the physical observables .",
    "we consider an ideal ellipsoidal galaxy cluster with symmetry of revolution along the line of sight ( i.e. @xmath74 ) .",
    "the related gravitational potential can be obtained from equation ( [ aa44425 ] ) : @xmath75 , \\label{aa335}\\ ] ] where the positive and the negative signs in front of @xmath76 correspond to the oblate [ @xmath77 , @xmath78 ) ] and the prolate [ @xmath79 , @xmath80 cases , respectively .",
    "note that the @xmath22-direction is always chosen as the symmetric axis in the above expression .",
    "we consider an analytical model distribution for the gas density in galaxy clusters , @xmath81 , with @xmath82 as free parameters . in order to reproduce realistic galaxy clusters , we fix these parameters to the best fit values of the density profile of macsj1423 under the assumption of spherical geometry ( @xmath83 ) .",
    "we assume a spherical nfw model ( i.e. @xmath84 in eqn [ aa33344 ] ) and fix the concentration parameter and the scale radius to @xmath85 and @xmath86 , which are the best expectation values we inferred for macsj1423 in an x - ray - only analysis .",
    "we emphasize that we are not trying to reproduce exactly the physical properties of macsj1423 , but just a simple toy model for both the icm and dm , whose parameters can be regarded as realistic for a typical massive galaxy cluster , in order understand how to constrain icm and dm shape .",
    "we considered three different elongations of the dm halo ( @xmath87 ) , corresponding to the case of spherical , prolate and oblate ellipsoid , respectively .",
    "from @xmath88 we inferred the corresponding elongation of the gravitational potential @xmath89 , which is ranging from @xmath90 to @xmath91 moving from the center towards the x - ray boundary , and we re - calculated the corresponding gas density as @xmath92 : indeed what is measured in observations is the emission measure @xmath93 , so it is pretty straightforward to recover the previous dependency of the gas density on the elongation along the line of sight ( see also appendix  a ) . in order to infer the deprojected temperature we solved the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( eqn [ aa2e ] ) for the previous values of the elongation of both dm and icm .",
    "then we calculated the gravitational potential @xmath49 ( eqn [ aa335 ] ) , the gas density @xmath94 , and the projected mass profile @xmath15 for the same triaxial dm and icm halos : the results of our analysis are reported in fig .",
    "[ entps3 ] .",
    "concerning the temperature profiles compared to the spherical case we find an increase ( decrease ) @xmath95 of the temperature for prolate ( oblate ) ellipsoids , which is small but appreciable in the intermediate region ( @xmath96 kpc ) , but it is smaller near the center and the x - ray boundary .",
    "bearing in mind that the shape of the temperature profile is the same as the underlying gravitational potential thanks to the _ x - ray shape theorem _ ( eqn . [ eqn : ecc ] ) , the reasonable agreement among the temperature profiles for different values of @xmath88 in the inner and outer regions is intuitively understood because : a ) the gravitational potential in the outskirts tends to be more spherical b ) the temperature has been recovered by solving the hydrostatic equilibrium equation ( eqn [ aa2e ] ) via integration of the derivative of the gravitational potential profile @xmath49 : it is possibly to show that for a large range of physical radii the relation @xmath97 roughly holds , therefore it is easy to understand why @xmath95 is larger in the central volumes than in the cooling region , where the temperature drops of a factor of 2 - 3 for a cool - core cluster .",
    "we point out that in fig .",
    "[ entps3 ] the temperature and the projected mass profiles for the spherical case have been represented with points whose distance is representative of the true spatial resolution of x - ray and sl data for macsj1423 . therefore we observe that the spatial resolution is pretty good for both x - ray and lensing data , allowing to accurately measure effects of an elongation along the line of the sight .    concerning the projected mass profiles we observe that the dependency of the projected mass profile @xmath15 on the ellipticity of the dm halo is quite straightforward , i.e. @xmath98 , so the departures among different projected mass profiles as function of @xmath88 are more pronounced in the central regions .",
    "therefore from this toy model we find that the projected mass profile near the center and the observed temperature profile in the intermediate regions are prone to the value of @xmath88 : so it easy to understand why both sl and x - ray data can jointly constrain the elongation of icm and dm ellipsoids along the line of sight , being the former a proxy of the projected mass profiles in the internal regions and the latter of the temperature profile .    as final test",
    ", we use this toy model in order to evaluate the systematics involved in our assumption that the triaxial ellipsoid is oriented ( oblate or prolate ) along the line of sight ( see sect .",
    "[ depr ] ) .",
    "we rotate the previous tree - dimensional icm and dm ellipsoidal distribution of an angle of 30 degrees respect to the line of sight , we recover the desired two - dimensional physical properties and then we apply our approach .",
    "the systematics on the fitting parameters and on the axial ratios have been estimated @xmath99 per cent , which are within the statistical errors : in particular , the major - minor axial ratio and the scale radius ( the concentration parameter ) get slightly underestimated(overestimated ) .",
    "we conclude that this assumption does not strongly affect the estimated parameters and we point out that it is justified in light of the results of @xcite , who showed that sl clusters with the largest einstein radii constitute a highly biased population with major axes preferentially aligned with the line of sight increasing the magnitude of lensing .",
    "we focus our analysis on the high-@xmath22 cool - core galaxy cluster macsj1423 .    motivated by the need to improve our knowledge of the geometry , physical properties and distribution of the icm and dm in galaxy clusters , we believe that macsj1423 is a optimal candidate for our study , because it is very relaxed , with very good sl , wl and x - ray data .    here",
    "we briefly summarize the most relevant aspects of our data reduction and analysis .",
    "we refer to the findings of @xcite , who presented gravitational lensing and optical properties of macsj1423 based on two bands of hst / acs observations complemented from ground by k band from the cfht and keck spectroscopy .",
    "they combined the strong lensing constraints from two spectroscopically confirmed multiply imaged systems with the weak lensing measurements from faint background galaxies via a parametric mass model .",

    "the 2d projected mass map has been rebinned into elliptical annuli , whose ellipticity , centroid and position angle is the same as that inferred from @xcite .",
    "then we calculated average values of the elliptical symmetric projected mass profile @xmath101 , @xmath28 being the minor radius of the 2d elliptical annuli , once we masked out the central 30 kpc , which is affected by the mass distribution of the cd galaxy .",
