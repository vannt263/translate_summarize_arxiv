    "it was shown in section [ dmft ] that dynamical mean - field theory can provide important insights into the organics . however , the connection with the model hamiltonian ( [ hubb ] ) needs to be made more precise by working out the appropriate lattice of large connectivity or dimensionality to study .",

    "first , since pressure and not doping is used to tune through the metal - insulator transition ( compare figure [ figcup ] ) only a single sample is needed to study the transition .",
    "second , the lower superconducting transition temperature and high purity samples mean that magneto - oscillations provide a powerful probe of the fermi surface . on the other hand , the single crystals are sufficiently small that neutron scattering is difficult and the first studies on the organics have only recently been performed.@xcite further studies could probe the magnetic fluctuations .",

    "extensive transport and thermodynamic measurements should be made on the _ same _ single crystal .",
    "of particular interest is how much of the low - temperature data can be explained within a brinkman - rice picture@xcite of a fermi liquid with an effective mass that diverges at the metal - insulator transition .    by applying uniaxial stress along the @xmath170-axis ( in the conducting plane ) it should be possible to vary the ratio of @xmath95 to @xmath96 and thus vary the magnetic frustration .",
