    "it is a known problem of calibration of energy estimations of extensive air showers ( eas ) . at the yakutsk array",
    "the vavilov - cherenkov light is used to calibrate signals in scintillation detectors @xcite . although our calculations show that for the same flux of vavilov - cherenkov light there should be much higher signals in scintillation detectors than it is measured in the experiment @xcite .",
    "first , this contradiction may have different explanations .",
    "the hadron interaction model may not correctly describe the real processes at high energies .",
    "this question will be probed at lhc once it is operational .",
    "alternatively , we may have a different chemical composition of primary cosmic rays  all our calculations were undertaken in the assumption of light chemical composition at high energies .",
    "although recent experiments claim that the primary particles at those energies are protons @xcite ( with exclusion of @xcite ) .    , dashed curve 2  550 g/@xmath1 , dotted curve 3  750 g/@xmath1),width=302 ]    , dashed curve 2  550 g/@xmath1 , dotted curve 3  750 g/@xmath1),width=302 ]    , dashed curve 2  550 g/@xmath1 , dotted curve 3  750 g/@xmath1),width=302 ]    each detector array encounters the problem of full signal registration .",
    "each detector after being triggered by some event ( a particle hits the detector , the counting rate exceeds some level , a signal comes from another detector , etc . )",
    "collects the signal for some period of time , a so - called time gate .",
    "time gates should be wide enough to collect possibly all particles coming to the detector .",
    "on the other hand , since we always have a background from low energy cosmic rays or the local sources ( radioactivity , light pollution , etc . ) , the time gates should not be too wide in order to keep the signal to noise ratio high enough .",
    "so the time gates should be of about the disk thickness . at most detector arrays such as haverah park , volcano ranch , yakutsk ,",
    "the time gates were set to about 2 @xmath2s .",
    "a. watson in @xcite suggested that the time gates at the yakutsk array are too narrow to detect all particles and thus the signals are underestimated , that leads to an overestimation of energy of the primary particles .",
    "a rapid change in steepness of the measured lateral distribution functions of signals and the fact that some of the showers detected at haverah park had signal width more than 2.2  @xmath2s @xcite are claimed to support this suggestion .    in our previous paper @xcite",
    "we have studied the problem of form and width of pulses in scintillation detector . in a few words",
    "though the signals in scintillation detectors at large distances from the shower axis ( more than 1   km ) exceed 2  @xmath2s ( at 600  m signal width is well within 2  @xmath2s ) and only part of the signal is measured the difference between the theory and the experiment is still too high to be explained solely by partial signal measurements . therefore , additional analysis was required . in this paper",
    "we investigated another question  the form of the cherenkov light pulse at the detector .",
    "as well as in the previous work in this study we used corsika 6.500 @xcite with qgsjet - ii @xcite@xcite for high energy and gheisha-2002d @xcite for low energy calculations .",
    "parameters of the atmosphere and the magnetic field were set to fit the conditions of the yakutsk array .",
    "the time delay of arrival of the vavilov - cherenkov photons was calculated as the time between its arrival at the observation level and the time of arrival of the very first particle at the observation level .",
    "all calculations were carried out in the framework of a multilevel hybrid scheme @xcite , i.e. we calculated the database of vavilov - cherenkov light pulses at different distances from the shower axis from low energy showers from primary electrons , gamma and muons ( some examples are shown in fig .",
    "13 ) and using source functions ( also calculated in our previous simulations",
    "@xcite ) we calculated the impulses for high energy showers .",
    "source function describes the number of particles with energy in interval @xmath3 $ ] born in the atmosphere at depth @xmath4 $ ] .",
    "the database of the vavilov - cherenkov light pulses @xmath5 describes the vavilov - cherenkov photon flux from a shower induced at depth @xmath6 by electron or gamma or muon with the energy @xmath7 at the distance from the shower axis @xmath8 at moment of time @xmath9 .",
    "time starts with the arrival of the very first particle at the observation level .",
    "having the analytical source functions of low energy particles from ultra high energy shower and databases of the vavilov - cherenkov light pulses from low energy showers one can calculate pulses from ultra high energy shower :    @xmath10    @xmath11    @xmath12    here @xmath13 - some reasonable maximum energy threshold , maximum energy of particles in source functions ; @xmath14 - some low energy threshold ( naturally in case of the vavilov - cherenkov light for electrons and gammas it is 21 mev , for muons - 4 gev ) ; @xmath15 - source functions of electrons , gammas and muons respectively .",
    "but if the source functions were obtained numerically as a table of parameters ( energy @xmath16 , depth of generation @xmath17 and weight @xmath18 if thinning procedure was applied ) of low energy particles generated in the shower than this integral converts to a sum :    @xmath19    @xmath20    @xmath21    after all theese calculations for vertical showers from primary protons we obtained the following results .",
    "at the different distances from shower axis ( doted curve  100 m , dash - dotted curve  400 m , dashed curve  600 m , solid curve  1000 m),width=302 ]        in fig .",
    "4 the fraction of vavilov - cherenkov light collected within time @xmath22 at different distances from the shower axis is shown .",
    "as one can see the width of the vavilov - cherenkov light impulse at the distance of 100  m from the shower axis is less than 50  ns , at 400  m ",
    "200  ns , at 600  m  400   ns and at 1000  m it is less than 1  @xmath2s .",
    "therefore , the time gates at the yakutsk array detectors are set wide enough to collect all of the cherenkov photons from eas , thus in the experiment the vavilov - cherenkov light is measured correctly .",
    "in addition we have calculated the form of the vavilov - cherenkov light forefront and backfront ( see fig . 5 ) . as the forefront arrival time we took the moment when",
    "5% of total signal is collected and the backfront was considered as the moment when 95% of all cherenkov photons were collected .",
    "we found that the best fit is achieved by the power function @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 , @xmath25= 1.71 , @xmath26 and @xmath27= 1.43 for forefront and backfront respectively ) rather than with a spherical front .",
    "the width of the vavilov - cherenkov light pulse does not exceed 1  @xmath2s at the distance of 1000  m from the shower axis .",
    "therefore , at the yakutsk array all the    cherenkov photons from eas are collected and the time gates of the cherenkov detectors may be set even lower .",
    "cherenkov light forefront and backfront may be approximated by a power function @xmath23 ( with @xmath24 , @xmath25= 1.71 , @xmath28 and @xmath27= 1.43 for forefront and backfront respectively ) with a better accuracy than with a spherical front .",
