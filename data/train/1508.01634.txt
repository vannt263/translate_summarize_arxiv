    "we study the simplicity of lorentz type algebras @xmath65 where @xmath24 is an algebra in @xmath16 .",
    "since any ideal @xmath170 of @xmath24 induces trivially an ideal @xmath171 of @xmath65 we will pay no attention to this class of ideals .",
    "the best way to rule out such ideals is to rule out the ideals of the kind @xmath172 , where @xmath173 is a maximal ideal of @xmath24 ( since any proper ideal of @xmath24 is contained in some maximal one ) .",
    "the ideals of the kind @xmath172 will be termed @xmath8-null ideals ( we will define them formally later ) . other class of ideals , that we shall exclude of our study , are the @xmath8-total ideals ( the ideals which agree with @xmath174 when passing to the quotient ) .",

    "the reader can easily check the existence of an isomorphism @xmath193 such that @xmath194 .",
    "furthermore , if @xmath173 is a maximal ideal and @xmath170 a submodule of @xmath190 with an @xmath8-free part of cardinal @xmath12 , then its image @xmath195 under the canonical epimorphism @xmath196 ( where @xmath197 ) contains a linearly independent set of cardinal @xmath12 hence @xmath198 .",

    "thus @xmath221 ( where @xmath222 denotes jacobson s radical ) and since @xmath189 is perfect we get @xmath223 for any positive integer @xmath224 .",
    "also the artinian character of @xmath24 implies that @xmath225 is nilpotent ( take into account also that every prime ideal is maximal and so the jacobson radical agrees with the nilradical , @xcite ) .",

    "there are four linear maps @xmath1006 such that @xmath1007 and @xmath1008 .",
    "taking in to account that @xmath1009 is a derivation , we get the following set of identities    1 .",

    "an straightforward computation reveals that the identity [ pewfive ] implies the existence of a scalar @xmath1015 such that @xmath1016 for all @xmath1017 . as a consequence",
    "the identity [ pewthree ] is automatically satisfied .",
    "now , since we now @xmath1018 , we may determine @xmath703 using equation [ pewone ] . from this",
    ", we get that the matrix of @xmath703 , in canonical basis , is @xmath1019 from the equation [ pewfour ] we obtain that the matrix of @xmath1020 is of the form : @xmath1021 finally , equation [ pewtwo ] gives that the matrix of @xmath152 is of the form : @xmath1022 so the free parameters appearing in @xmath1009 are : @xmath1023 hence @xmath1003      consider now the affine group scheme @xmath1025 , where @xmath15 is a field of characteristic @xmath7 .",
    "the dimension of this algebraic group is @xmath1026 where @xmath90 is the algebraic closure of @xmath15 .",
    "as we have proved in previous sections @xmath1027 hence @xmath1028 . of course , we have @xmath1029 and @xmath1030 by theorem [ nine ] .",
    "thus we have @xmath1031 and so the affine group scheme @xmath835 is not smooth .",
    "the poincar group is the inhomogeneous lorentz group , that is , the group generated by the lorentz group plus translations .",
    "similarly the poincar algebra @xmath1032 over the field @xmath90 is the inhomogeneous lorentz algebra .",
    "we can define it as the direct sum @xmath1033 but since in this section we assume the ground field @xmath90 to be algebraically closed and of characteristic other than @xmath7 , we identify @xmath208 with @xmath1034 allthrough the section ( see lemma [ one ] ) .",
    "thus , the poincar algebra @xmath1032 is the direct sum @xmath1035 with the product in this lie algebra @xmath1036\\!=\\!\\begin{pmatrix}0 & vm'-v'm\\cr 0 & [ m , m']\\end{pmatrix}$ ] for any @xmath1037 , @xmath1038 .",

    "we show that the ideal generated by any nonzero element in @xmath1040 is @xmath1040 .",
    "thus , take @xmath1051 .",
    "there are two possibilities to analyze :    1 .",
    "assume first that @xmath1052 is nonisotropic relative to the quadratic form @xmath1053 of @xmath1042 .",
    "we may take @xmath1054 since the ideal generated by @xmath378 is the same that the ideal generated by any nonzero scalar multiple of @xmath378 . in this case , applying witt s theorem , @xmath157 is in the same orbit as @xmath1055 under the action of the orthogonal group .",

    ", the ideal generated by @xmath378 contains all the elements @xmath1057 with @xmath1058 .",
    "but the subspace @xmath1059 is @xmath339-dimensional hence it contains a nonisotropic vector ( the witt index of @xmath651 is @xmath7 ) .",
    "thus the ideal generated by @xmath378 contains an element @xmath1060 with @xmath1061 nonisotropic .",
    "hence this ideal is @xmath1040 .",
    "we know that @xmath1062 and by lemma [ one ] and proposition [ prtwo ] , this algebra is a direct sum @xmath1063 of two isomorphic ideals @xmath1064 .",
    "thus we have seven - dimensional ideals @xmath1065 such that @xmath1066 and @xmath1067 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath1068 so @xmath234 and @xmath1069 are maximal ideals of @xmath1032 .",

    "thus @xmath1079 and we have proved @xmath1080 . finally the minimality of @xmath1040 implies @xmath1073 .",
    "the unique ideals of @xmath1032 are : @xmath49 , @xmath1040 , @xmath234 , @xmath1069 and @xmath1032 .",
    "let @xmath1081 such that @xmath1082 .",
    "observe that by maximality of @xmath234 we must have either @xmath1083 or @xmath1084 ( and similarly @xmath1085 or @xmath1086 ) .",

    "we have a linear map @xmath1112 defined by @xmath1113 where @xmath1114 is the natural injection @xmath1115 , and @xmath1116 the map @xmath1117 which is an epimorphism of lie algebras .",
    "the linear map @xmath651 is an epimorphism of lie algebras whose kernel is isomorphic to the lie algebra @xmath1118 with product given by @xmath1119:=(0,\\lambda v_0'-\\lambda ' v_0)$ ] .",
    "thus @xmath1108 fits in a short exact sequence @xmath1120 and therefore @xmath1121 .",
    "the proof that @xmath651 is a lie algebra homomorphism is easy if we take into account that the radical @xmath1040 of @xmath1032 is @xmath1009-invariant for any derivation @xmath1009 of @xmath1032 ( see @xcite ) .",
    "next we prove that @xmath651 is an epimorphism .",
    "let @xmath1122 , since the derivations of @xmath1034 are inner ( see corollary [ inner ] ) , there is some @xmath1123 such that @xmath1124 .",

    "assume that @xmath1129 for a derivation @xmath1009",
    ". then @xmath1130= \\begin{pmatrix}0 & \\beta(x)\\cr 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$ ] for some linear map @xmath1131 which must satisfy the hypothesis on lemma [ etiq ] .",
    "therefore there is an element @xmath1132 such that @xmath1133 for any @xmath1134 .",
    "since any derivation preserves the radical @xmath1040 of @xmath1032 ( again @xcite ) , we also must have @xmath1135=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & \\alpha(v)\\cr 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$ ] for some linear map @xmath1136 .",
    "so there is a matrix @xmath1137 such that @xmath1138 for any @xmath157 .",
    "then @xmath1139=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & vp+v_0x\\cr 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$ ] and imposing the condition that @xmath1009 to be a derivation we get that @xmath119 must commute with any element in @xmath1034 but this implies that @xmath1140 where @xmath1141 and @xmath1142 denotes de identity matrix @xmath1143 . summarizing : @xmath1139=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & \\lambda v+v_0x\\cr 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix}$ ] and the scalar @xmath713 as well as the vector @xmath1144",
    "are uniquely determined by @xmath1009 .",

    "thus , the exact sequence of lie algebras @xmath1147 exists and @xmath1148 .    for @xmath1149 define the derivation @xmath1150 by @xmath1151=\\begin{pmatrix}0 & \\lambda v+v_0x\\cr 0 & 0\\end{pmatrix}.\\ ] ]    the short exact sequence ( [ ssesone ] ) is split : there is a monomorphism @xmath1152 such that for @xmath1153 one has @xmath1154 being @xmath1124 .",
