    "spontaneous parametric down - conversion ( spdc ) is a widely used method for producing correlated and entangled photon pairs . due to the spontaneous emission nature of the process",

    "a key element of these experiments kuzmich , wal , matsukevich104,balic , kolchin , thompson , du is that one photon is generated by the spontaneous raman emission process whereas the second photon is generated via an eit - assisted two - wave mixing process . alternatively",

    "especially , when a perfect single source is on demand our scheme will have potential applications . at the first glance the scheme reported here is very similar to those studied in refs .",
    "however , it is operated under a very different principle .",
    "instead of relying on a spontaneous raman process to generate the first photon , we inject a probe photon which leads to stimulated raman generation .",
    "two features are evident in this scheme : ( 1)injection seeding of the probe photon leads to highly directional generation of probe photons and fwm photons , ( 2 ) stimulated raman process ensures that the more photons appear in the same frequency mode and the gain can be easily controllable .",

    "we consider an ensemble of identical lifetime broadened four - state atoms initially prepared in their ground states @xmath6 by suitable optical pumping method . a cw pump field @xmath7 couples the ground state @xmath6 to an excited state @xmath8 with a large one - photon detuning @xmath9 .",

    "a spdc process is described by the hamiltonian , @xmath259h.c.@xmath260with a strong classical field @xmath261and the weak signal ( idler ) field @xmath262 ( @xmath263 ) .",
    "the output state in spdc case can be approximated as @xmath264 for @xmath265 .",
    "the conversion efficiency of pump photons into correlated photon pairs integrated over all emission directions is on the order of @xmath266 mm@xmath267sr@xmath267 for a typical nonlinear material @xcite .",

    "for example , in the experiment@xcite , the collection angle is @xmath268 sr .",
    "this leads to a realistic conversion efficiency is about @xmath269 mm@xmath267 of crystal length .",
    "taking account of the reduction of efficiency due to collection angle in real detection for spdc case , it is evident that the overall conversion efficiency in our case will be higher due to the determined direction of emitted photons by stimulated process . in this sense",
    ", our scheme can have some merits over spdc case and provide a different method to generate photon pairs using atomic system .",
    "as function of detuning @xmath270 for @xmath271 .",
    "the other parameters are chosen as those using in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . ]",
    "in the section , we explore the possibilities for applications of our scheme .",
    "firstly , the scheme can be used to generate photon pair due to the existence of the second term on the right side in eq .",
    "( [ pairphoton ] ) .",
    "this term represents the situation of simultaneous existence of two photons in the probe frequency mode ( @xmath15 ) and one photon in the fwm frequency mode ( @xmath18 ) .",
    "detection of a trigger photon ( @xmath15 ) will project this state into @xmath272 . in the weak gain limit considered in the paper",
    "this state @xmath273 has a large vacuum component @xmath164 and a small admixture of the two photon state @xmath274 .",
    "such a state shares a great similarity to that generated in spdc experiments . despite such a similarity between our scheme and the spdc case",
    ", our scheme in generating photon pairs has its own reason for specialty .",
    "for example , the frequency of generated photon pairs can be widely tuned . the conversion efficiency can be achieved effectively higher than spdc case due to the injection - seed mechanism and stimulated raman process .",
    "the injection - seed mechanism ensures a highly directional photon emission which can increase the collecting efficiency of photons in the detection , compared to spdc case . stimulated raman process somehow increases the emission probability",
    "this is because , for an @xmath19-photon state input , we have the term @xmath275 . as a result , the photon emission probability is @xmath276 times that of the spontaneous emission described by ( @xmath277 ) @xcite .",
    "though the enhancement is low for our case limited by @xmath278 , the generation probability is @xmath161 times of that from spontaneous emission .",
    "furthermore , the one - photon emission enhancement due to stimulated emission was observed by lamas - linares _",
    "_ @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", what is more important is that if a perfect single photon is on demand , the conversion efficiency from pump photons into photon pairs will be significantly improved in our scheme .",
    "hence our scheme can have the potential to take over the spdc case if the single - photon - on - demand source is available in the future .",
    "in additional to the generation of photon pairs , our ( 2 + 1 ) photon source can also be used to generate photon - number fock state for quantum communication and other applications .",
    "recently , ou @xcite presented a scheme with a number of ideas for efficient conversion between photons . in the scheme ,",
    "one of the ideas is to use the four - wave mixing as a two - photon annihilator , the input of which requires a two - photon fock state .",
    "our ( 2 + 1 ) photon source can be a candidate for providing such a two - photon fock state by projecting the state @xmath279 described in eq .",
    "( [ pairphoton ] ) into the state @xmath280 with the detection of the trigger photon @xmath281 .     for @xmath282 .",
    "the other parameters are chosen as those using in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . ]",
    "in this section we first discuss these ac stark - type frequency shifts . from eqs .",
    "( [ eq9 ] ) and  ( [ eq10 ] ) , we obtain the phase mismatching induced by stark shift @xmath283.\\]]figure  [ fig9 ] shows phase mismatching induced by the stark shift versus @xmath284 by numerical calculations .",
    "it is clear from a comparison between figs .",
    "[ fig9 ] and  [ fig10 ] that the mismatching @xmath285 induced by stark shift is very small with the exclusion of two maximal phase mismatches that occur in the regions where the gain coefficients are maximized . from fig .",
    "[ fig9 ] we also obtain that the magnitude of two maximal phase mismatches are small compared with that of the wave vector of light field , so the angle of departure of field @xmath286 from the direction determine by @xmath287 is small .",
    "once the single - photon probe field is introduced , we can generate a correlated photon pair with probability @xmath288 when only one photon @xmath289 is detected . in order to obtain the desired result , the raman gain ( by the pump field rabi frequency @xmath290 )",
    "should be kept very low to ensure the stimulated generation of one probe photon .",
    "of course , the pump field rabi frequency @xmath291 should be kept appropriately to ensure the unit conversion from state @xmath11 to state @xmath12 which leads to the simultaneous generation of one fwm photon .",
    "figure  [ fig9 ] depicted the raman gain in the fourier transform space for the parameters used . as expected , the gain is small and rather flat as required under the condition that the @xmath292 is small .",
    "we further note that with sufficient @xmath291 our scheme has approximately a eit - like behavior , as can be seen from hamiltonian ( [ h1 ] ) . in this case",
    ", our four - level system is a hybrid system which is composed of an effective eit ( for the fwm photon generation ) and raman gain ( for the probe photon generation ) .",
    "specifically , consider the limiting case where @xmath293 , @xmath294 , @xmath295 , and very large one - photon detuning @xmath9 , we find that the group velocity @xmath296 we know the magnitude of raman gain bandwidth is 10 mhz .",
    "the injecting seed single - photon wave - packet should be microsecond or sub - microsecond pulse .",
    "such single photon source has so far only been achieved with radiating object ( atoms , quantum dots ) in high - finesse microcavities because the efficiency of single photon source is hard to obtain high in free space due to the light - collecting lens covers only a fraction of the full 4@xmath297 solid angle . using a single atom makes it possible to produce single photons with controlled waveform kuhn , mckeever , keller , hijlkema and polarization @xcite , which allows realizing deterministic protocols in quantum information science @xcite .",
    "the deterministic and high efficient single - photon source hijlkema , wilk , matsukevich06,chen06 can support the present scheme .",
    "the single - photon - generation probability is about @xmath298 by rempe group hijlkema .",
    "the low efficiency of single photon sources degrades our scheme .",
    "when a perfect single source is on demand our scheme will have potential applications .",
    "finally , we point out that the effect of quantum noises from the atomic system is ignored since the terms of langevin - noise operators are excluded in eq .",
    "( [ allequations ] ) .",
    "the ignorance of quantum noises is valid here as we exploit only the low - gain regime of the active - raman - gain medium for the purpose of generation of correlated photons .",
    "in conclusion , we have studied a ( 2 + 1)-photon generation scheme using a life - time broadened four - state atomic system .",
    "this scheme is based on a double-@xmath1 excitation configuration with the first @xmath1 branch forming an active - raman - gain medium .",
    "this is very different from the conventional spdc scheme .",
    "furthermore , it is different from the spontaneous emission based biphoton generation scheme because of the injection - seeding mechanism .",
    "this injection - seeding technique leads to the highly directional generation of desired photons , resulting in high detection efficiency .",
    "an important feature of the present scheme is that two identical probe photons , because of the stimulated raman emission process due to injection - seeding , and a fwm photon are generated simultaneously , yielding correlated and entangled ( 2 + 1 ) photons .",
    "consequently , one of the probe photons can be used as a coincidence trigger whereas the remaining probe and fwm photons form a correlated or entangled pair that allows further experimental studies of paired propagation .",
    "in addition , ( 2 + 1)-photon source can also be used to generate photon - number fock state .",
    "hence if the single - photon - on - demand source is available in the future , our scheme can have the potential to take over the spdc case and have potential applications .",
