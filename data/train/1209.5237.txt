    "dutch physicist hendrick brugt gerhard casimir published his famous paper @xcite in 1948 , where he found a simple yet profound explanation for the retarded van der waals interaction between polarizable molecules .",
    "he showed that there exists a net force between grounded infinite metallic plates , placed a few micrometers apart , in a vacuum without any external electromagnetic field .",
    "the casimir effect is essentially a direct consequence of the change in the vacuum energy of a quantum field when some boundary condition or background field is imposed . since the casimir s work",
    ", many papers have been written on the casimir energy or the resulting force due to the presence of boundary conditions .",
    "they have calculated this effect for parallel plates @xcite , cylinders @xcite , and spheres @xcite ( first considered by casimir @xcite , deraad and milton @xcite , and boyer @xcite , respectively ) , and many other geometries @xcite . in addition , many authors have considered this effect for various fields , different boundary conditions , dimensions and topologies @xcite .",
    "there are various methods to calculate the casimir energy , e.g. the green function formalism @xcite , the heat - kernel method @xcite and the multiple - scattering expansions @xcite .",
    "also , as mentioned before , the presence of the nontrivial background fields such as solitons affect the zero - point energy .",
    "for example , to compute the quantum corrections to the mass of the soliton , the change in the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum energy caused by the presence of the soliton , should be taken into account . in 1974 ,",
    "dashen _ et al _ @xcite computed the one - loop correction to the mass of the kink of the @xmath5 theory for the first time .",
    "after this work , several authors have used various methods to compute the corrections to the soliton mass , such as the scattering phase shift method , zeta function analytic continuation technique , dimensional regularization technique , etc .",
    "@xcite . moreover , the casimir effect appears in supersymmetric models . to investigate the validity of the bps saturation by supersymmetric solitons",
    ", one should compute the change in the fluctuations of the vacuum energy to obtain the quantum corrections to the soliton mass ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "one of the first experimental attempts to verify the existence of the casimir effect was conducted by marcus sparnaay for two parallel metallic plates in 1958 @xcite .",
    "the results was not in contradiction with the casimir theory , but had a very poor accuracy . in 1997 , using a plate and a spherical lens covered by a metallic sheet , steve k. lamoreaux measured the casimir energy with high accuracy @xcite .",
    "it was the first `` successful '' experiment to verify the casimir effect .",
    "since then , many different experiments have been performed to measure the casimir effects for various geometries , such as two parallel plates and a sphere in front of a plane , with ever increasing accuracy ( see for example @xcite ) .    in this paper",
    "we consider a pseudoscalar field as a prescribed , spatially varying background field which is coupled chirally to a fermi field .",
    "the background field in our model has two adjustable parameters , one related to its scale of variation and the second to its asymptotic value at spatial infinity .",
    "by varying the latter from zero to @xmath6 , we can build a field configuration with topological charge @xmath7 .",
    "as it is well - known the nomenclature `` soliton '' refers to a static field configuration which is a solution to the classical field equations with finite energy and localized energy density .",
    "topological solitons by definition carry nonzero topological charge . in a field theory",
    "in which this background field interacts with a fermion , such as the one considered in this paper , the exact shape of the soliton depends on the back - reaction of the fermi field , which in turn depends on the particular fermionic state to which the soliton is coupled .",
    "therefore , the soliton can in principle acquire infinitely many different shapes",
    ". however , since the back - reaction is usually small , all these different shapes are close to each other .",
    "however , we have obtained the exact ( to within numerical approximation ) non - perturbative solutions for the coupled system treating both fields as dynamical , verifying the perturbative result that the back - reaction is small @xcite .",
    "the problem of obtaining the casimir energy for any of these particular field configurations is also not exactly solvable .",
    "therefore , in this paper we choose a simple field configuration which has proper topological charge and renders the problem exactly solvable .",
    "although the field configuration that we choose is not a solution to the field equations , it possesses all other properties of a proper soliton .",
    "we shall henceforth refer to this configuration as a soliton for brevity of notation .",
    "we expect the exact casimir energy for this topologically non - trivial configuration to illuminate many of the qualitative features of the problem with an exact soliton . since this model is exactly solvable and we have the complete spectrum of the fermi field @xcite , we are able to calculate the vacuum expectation value of the hamiltonian directly and exactly for all values of the aforementioned parameters .",
    "we obtain the casimir energy for this system by subtracting the zero - point energy in the presence and absence of the background field . in section",
    "ii we introduce the model and present a derivation for the expression of the casimir energy . in section",
    "iii we obtain an exact expression for the casimir energy and its density for our model .",
    "then , we thoroughly explore the properties and behavior of the casimir energy as a function of the parameters of our model .",
    "first , we depict the casimir energy as a function of the scale of variation of the soliton with winding number one . in general",
    "there is a sharp maximum whenever the fermi field has a zero - mode bound state .",
    "we obtain the expected results that the casimir energy tends to zero in the limits of extremely wide and sharp solitons .",
    "second , we depict the casimir energy as a function of @xmath2 . in general @xmath8",
    "is an increasing function of @xmath2 with very mild maxima in the form of cusps whenever there is an energy level crossing zero .",
    "then , we exhibit the energy densities of the bound and continuum states and their sum for states with @xmath4 and @xmath3 , separately .",
    "these two energy densities are exact mirror images of each other , and from this we compute the casimir energy density . in section",
    "iv we summarize and discuss the results .",
    "consider the following lagrangian describing a fermion interacting non - linearly with a pseudoscalar field @xmath9 , in ( @xmath10 ) dimensions , @xmath11 in order to have an exactly solvable model , gousheh and mobilia @xcite chose @xmath9 to be piecewise linear as follows @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the slope in the middle region .",
    "one could interpolate between the extreme adiabatic and non - adiabatic regimes by changing @xmath1 from zero to infinity , respectively . when @xmath14 , the soliton has winding number @xmath7 .",
    "figure ( [ fig.1 ] ) shows the form of @xmath9 . as mentioned earlier this simple topological configuration is used as an approximation to the kink of the @xmath15 theory .",
    "although our simple static configuration is not a solution to the euler - lagrange equation , its total energy can be easily obtained from the corresponding hamiltonian as follows    @xmath16dx=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty } \\left[\\frac{1}{2}(\\partial_x \\phi ) ^2 + \\frac{\\lambda}{4}\\left(\\phi^2-\\frac{m'^2}{\\lambda}\\right)^2\\right]dx=\\frac{23}{15}\\mu\\theta_0,\\ ] ]    where @xmath17 , the value of @xmath18 when @xmath19 , and @xmath20 , the slope at @xmath21 .     the form of the background pseudoscalar field @xmath9.,width=238 ]     the energies of the bound states as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath22 obtained from @xmath23 derived in @xcite .",
    "solid ( dashed ) lines show the bound states with positive ( negative ) parity .",
    ", width=306 ]    the procedure is to find the spectrum of the fermi field in the presence of this background , for arbitrary values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 .",
    "then , for fixed @xmath1 , one could observe the changes in the spectrum of the fermion as a soliton with the topological charge @xmath7 is built by changing @xmath2 from zero to @xmath6 .",
    "this method was first introduced by mackenzie and wilczek @xcite and is based upon the adiabatic method first introduced by goldstone and wilczek @xcite . since this model is exactly solvable , the complete spectrum of the fermi field , including the eigenfunctions and their corresponding eigenenergies , has been obtained exactly for arbitrary values of @xmath1 and @xmath2 , and are given in @xcite . here",
    "we do not present the solutions in detail and the interested reader is referred to @xcite .",
    "if we denote the fermi field in ( @xmath10 ) dimensions by @xmath24 , then we can define @xmath25 and solve the equations of motion in terms of @xmath26 .",
    "since the hamiltonian commutes with the parity operator , the eigenfunctions of the hamiltonian can be chosen to be eigenfunctions of the parity operator as well . in the first representation ( @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 ) , the parity operation is given by @xmath30 . in the new representation i.e. eq.([e3 ] ) ( @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) , it becomes @xmath34 .",
    "figure ( [ fig.2 ] ) shows the energies of the bound states as a function of @xmath2 for @xmath35 as an example .",
    "as shown in the figure , the bound states have alternating parity signs , starting with the positive sign .",
    "this graph will be important for the upcoming discussions .    in order to obtain the casimir energy",
    ", we should subtract the zero point energy in the absence from the presence of the background field .",
    "therefore , the vacuum energies for both cases should be calculated .",
    "mackenzie and wilczek @xcite assumed that the solutions in the presence of the soliton are complete .",
    "later on gousheh and mobilia proved this assumption .",
    "therefore , the fermi field operator can be expanded in terms of either the modes in the absence or in the presence of the background field , as follows @xmath36\\nonumber\\\\ & = & \\int_{0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{dp}{2\\pi}\\sum\\limits_{j=\\pm}\\left[a_p^j \\mu_p^j(x , t)+c_p^{j\\dag } \\nu_p^j(x , t)\\right ] + \\sum\\limits_{i}\\left[e_i \\chi_{1b_i}(x , t)+f_i^\\dag\\chi_{2b_i}(x , t ) \\right]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath37 ( @xmath38 ) are the positive ( negative ) energy continuum eigenstates in the absence of the background field . also , @xmath39 ( @xmath40 ) are the positive ( negative ) energy continuum eigenstates and @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) are the positive ( negative ) energy bound states in the presence of the soliton .",
    "here , @xmath43 refers to the possibility of multiple bound states and the superscript @xmath44 refers to the parity of the continuum states .",
    "mackenzie and wilczek chose the coefficients of both positive and negative energy bound states to be annihilation operators .",
    "however , we choose annihilation ( creation ) operator for the positive ( negative ) energy bound states , as we do for the continuum states .",
    "we shall see one of the advantages of this choice when we compute the casimir energy .",
    "in general the hamiltonian can be expressed as follows @xmath45.\\ ] ] substituting the expression for the field operator @xmath46 in eq.([e6 ] ) in the presence of the background field into eq.([e9 ] ) , we obtain @xmath47+\\sum\\limits_{i}\\left[e_i^\\dag \\chi_{1b_i}^\\dag(x , t)+f_i\\chi_{2b_i}^\\dag(x , t ) \\right]\\bigg\\}\\nonumber\\\\ & \\times&\\bigg\\{\\int_{0}^{+\\infty}\\frac{dq}{2\\pi}\\sum\\limits_{n=\\pm}\\left[\\sqrt{q^2+m^2}a_q^n \\mu_q^n(x , t)-\\sqrt{q^2+m^2}c_q^{n\\dag } \\nu_q^n(x , t)\\right]\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\sum\\limits_{l } \\left[e^{l+}_{\\text{bound}}e_l \\chi_{1b_l}(x , t)+e^{l-}_{\\text{bound}}f_l^\\dag\\chi_{2b_l}(x , t ) \\right ] \\bigg\\},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where , the @xmath48 superscripts on @xmath49 denote the sign of the bound state . upon calculating the expectation value of the hamiltonian in the vacuum state ,",
    "all the terms vanish except the terms with an annihilation operator on the left side and the corresponding creation operator on the right side .",
    "there are only two terms in this form which can be written in the following form by the use of the anticommutation relations @xmath50 therefore , we obtain the following expression for the vacuum expectation value of the hamiltonian @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the vacuum state in the presence of the background field . from this expression",
    "we conclude that the entire contribution to the vacuum energy for fermionic systems originates from the negative energy eigenstates .",
    "note that our separation of the bound states into the positive and negative energy ones has the advantage of the automatic inclusion of the negative energy bound states in the expression for the casimir energy . to obtain the casimir energy ,",
    "one should subtract the zero point energy in the absence from the presence of the background field .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath53 note that our problem possesses charge conjugation symmetry and therefore our expression for the casimir energy given in eq.([e12 ] ) is equivalent to the conventional one , where one would sum over all modes symmetrically with a factor of @xmath54 , while preserving the sign .",
    "by substituting the expressions for the eigenstates into eq.([e12 ] ) , the casimir energy can be calculated .",
    "our prescription for subtracting two quadratically divergent integrals appearing in this equation , is to subtract the integrands with corresponding values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 , and then performing the integral .",

    "<S> in this paper we compute the casimir energy for a coupled fermion - pseudoscalar field system . in the model considered in this paper </S>",
    "<S> the pseudoscalar field is _ static _ and _ prescribed _ with two adjustable parameters . </S>",
    "<S> these parameters determine the values of the field at infinity ( @xmath0 ) and its scale of variation ( @xmath1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> one can build up a field configuration with arbitrary topological charge by changing @xmath2 , and interpolate between the extreme adiabatic and non - adiabatic regimes by changing @xmath1 . </S>",
    "<S> this system is exactly solvable and therefore we compute the casimir energy exactly and unambiguously by using an energy density subtraction scheme . </S>",
    "<S> we show that in general the casimir energy goes to zero in the extreme adiabatic limit , and in the extreme non - adiabatic limit when the asymptotic values of the pseudoscalar field properly correspond to a configuration with an arbitrary topological charge . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , in general the casimir energy is always positive and on the average an increasing function of @xmath2 and always has local maxima when there is a zero mode , showing that these configurations are energetically unfavorable . we also compute and display the energy densities associated with the spectral deficiencies in both of the continua , and those of the bound states . </S>",
    "<S> we show that the energy densities associated with the distortion of the spectrum of the states with @xmath3 and @xmath4 are mirror images of each other . </S>",
    "<S> we also compute and display the casimir energy density . </S>",
    "<S> finally we compute the energy of a system consisting of a soliton and a valance electron and show that the casimir energy of the system is comparable with the binding energy . </S>"
