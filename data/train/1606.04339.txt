    "we investigate the quantum simulation of a switch of particle statistics , from bosons to fermions and from fermions to bosons , reversibly , during a quantum evolution .",
    "we construct a spinor in an embedding space which has as components the wave functions of all different permutations of the particles , such that we can recover both the dynamics of bose - einstein and fermi - dirac statistics via a direct mapping . in this way",
    ", we can shift from bosonic to fermionic statistics and viceversa by means of local operations .",
    "the implementation of this proposal can be carried out via analog  @xcite or digital @xcite quantum simulations on a variety of quantum platforms .",
    "in the context of embedding quantum simulations , one has to distinguish between the simulated or embedded hilbert space , which contains the dynamics of interest , and the simulating or embedding space , an enlarged hilbert space containing the simulated model under a suitable mapping .",
    "this embedding space will allow for operations that under the considered mapping correspond to a process of interest in the simulated space , in this case , a modification in the particle statistics of the simulated model .    for clarity",
    ", we will first illustrate our proposal considering the case of two particles , and later show that the extension to @xmath0 particles is polynomial in terms of resources . in order to encode bosonic and fermionic statistics in the embedding space",

    "we point out that in order to switch from bosonic to fermionic statistics of the simulated particles during a quantum dynamics , all that is needed is to apply a local @xmath12 operation on the enlarged spinor in the embedding space , before implementing the mapping to the bosonic or fermionic state .",
    "we assume now that the evolution in the simulated space is ruled by a hamiltonian @xmath13 , which typically will be permutation invariant to preserve the particle statistics .",
    "thus , the corresponding hamiltonian in the embedding space , which preserves the mapping between the enlarged spinor and the fermionic and bosonic wave functions at all times , is given by @xmath14 .",
    "this makes our proposal specially suitable for a quantum simulation , as the dynamics of any demonstrated quantum simulator will remain the same in the enlarged space .",
    "all that is needed is to add an ancilla qubit in the appropriate entangled initial state , and then keep it out of the evolution . in trapped ions ,",
    "this can be done via individual addressing , using ions of different species that will not interact with the lasers that rule the evolution of the system , or by changing the energy splitting of the ionic qubits to bring them out of resonance  @xcite . in circuit qed ,",
    "superconducting qubits can also be taken out of resonance with the cavity to isolate them from the dynamics of the system .",
    "this is typically done by imposing a magnetic field across the superconducting qubit that will change the energy splitting of its two levels  @xcite .",
    "if the hamiltonian is not permutational invariant , @xmath15 , then the enlarged hamiltonian would be @xmath16 , where @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the ancilla states corresponding to permutations @xmath19 and @xmath20 of the particles , respectively , and @xmath21 the hamiltonian corresponding to permutation @xmath22 .    in order to measure a given observable @xmath23 in the simulated quantum system",
    ", one can physically implement the mapping from the embedding space to the embedded one , as explained above , and then perform the measurement of interest .",
    "however , a more direct approach would be to encode the expectation value of the observable in the simulated space into the expectation value of an observable in the enlarged hilbert space . depending on whether we are interested in the observable to be evaluated , according to bosonic or fermionic statistics",
    ", we will associate our observable to a different one in the enlarged space .",
    "following the mappings in eq .",
    "( [ eqs1 ] ) , we have that @xmath24 in this way , one can measure not only the observable @xmath23 with the corresponding bosonic @xmath25 or fermionic @xmath26 wave function , but also correlations between these two kinds of particles .",
    "these correlations will cancel out for standard permutation - invariant measurement operators , due to superselection rules .",
    "however , they can be a useful consistency check in a quantum simulation implementation , or they can give nonzero results when observables that connect both types of statistics are used , e.g. , non - permutation - invariant ones .",
    "our method has as a by - product the capability to test permutation invariance of an unknown hamiltonian by detecting correlations between bosonic and fermionic sectors .",
    "for an @xmath0-particle system one can proceed similarly , composing the enlarged spinor in the embedding hilbert space , i.e. , the symmetrization spinor , with the permutation states of the particles . to generate such a spinor we consider an algorithm that makes use of a generic controlled - swap gate that will permute the wave functions of any two particles .",
    "this kind of gates has been recently performed in the laboratory  @xcite .",
    "the algorithm consists of @xmath27 steps , @xmath0 being the total number of particles being simulated . at the beginning",
    "the system is in state @xmath28 .",
    "we introduce an ancillary qubit in a superposition of @xmath29 and @xmath30 states , and apply a controlled - swap gate , which will swap the particles @xmath31 and @xmath32 only if the ancillary qubit is in state @xmath30 , that is @xmath33 , where @xmath34 .",
    "this will generate the spinor @xmath35 the second step of the algorithm will need to introduce two more ancillary qubits to accommodate all the three new permutations allowed by particle 3 .",
    "we shall initialize the two qubits in a vector state with only three nonzero componentes , that is , we will set the coefficient of state @xmath36 to zero , while the rest of states will be in an even superposition .",
    "associated with state @xmath37 , we will have the spinor containing the permutations of particles @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "we continue by permuting particles 1 and 3 controlled on state @xmath38 , and particles @xmath32 and @xmath39 controlled on the state @xmath40 .",
    "this will generate a spinor containing all the possible permutations between particles 1 to 3 , and also some zeros .",
    "we will proceed in a similar fashion employing in each step a number of qubits enough to accommodate the @xmath41 new permutations that each @xmath41th particle introduces .",
    "these qubits will be first initialized in an even superposition of @xmath41 and only @xmath41 orthogonal states , which can always be done efficiently  @xcite .",
    "the state @xmath42 of the set of qubits introduced in the @xmath41th step will always be left associated with the already constructed spinor , containing the permutations of the @xmath43 previous particles .",
    "we will then perform a permutation between every previous particle and the @xmath41th one , via @xmath41 swap gates each controlled over one of the available states of the qubits introduced in this step of the protocol . for the antisymmetrized state one will proceed similarly but introducing a minus sign additional to each swap gate . by an auxiliary control qubit @xmath44 , both processes for the bosonic and",
    "fermionic statistics can be performed in parallel , via a controlled sign added or not to each controlled - swap gate .",
    "this will be done depending on the simulated statistics , either fermionic or bosonic .",
    "after @xmath27 steps , we will have constructed a spinor containing all possible permutations both for bosonic and fermionic cases , and some zeros .",
    "notice that while the total number of permutations per case , bosonic or fermionic , is @xmath45 , we have only made use of @xmath43 controlled - swap gates per step @xmath41 , that is a total number of gates of @xmath46 .",
    "this is because in each step @xmath41 , the swap gate acts over the whole spinor containing the permutations of all previous @xmath41 - 1 particles . in this way , we profit from the accumulated permutations , making the algorithm polynomial in terms of the number of gates .",
    "the total number of added ancillary qubits grows as @xmath47 , where the upper bar indicates that we round up to the first natural number . as a consequence",
    ", the number of ancillary qubits grows subquadratically with @xmath0 .",
    "one must take into account that the controlled - swap gates need to be controlled over a higher number of qubits in each step .",
    "however , it is known that any unitary operation controlled over a single qubit can be efficiently extended to a unitary controlled over @xmath41 qubits by the addition of @xmath43 working qubits and @xmath48 toffolli gates  . on the other hand , swap gates of arbitrary dimension or even continuous degrees of freedom",
    "have already been considered in the literature  @xcite .    after finishing the initialization protocol , we will have the @xmath45-component symmetrization spinors containing all permutations both for bosonic ( symmetric ) and fermionic ( antisymmetric ) cases , entangled with the qubit @xmath44 that controls the statistics , @xmath49 , where @xmath50 acts on the hilbert space of the enlarged symmetrization spinor and of @xmath44 , and @xmath13 acts on the simulated system .",
    "this evolution can be implemented straightforwardly and will respect the particle statistics when considering permutationally invariant @xmath13 dynamics . at the end of the quantum simulation , we will obtain the relevant information , either for bosonic or fermionic state , according to the following procedure .",
    "we will measure the statistics control qubit , @xmath44 , and postselect for a bosonic result if the outcome is @xmath51 , or fermionic result if the outcome is @xmath52 , with 1/2 probability .",
    "then , we propose to measure the observable @xmath53 , where @xmath54 acts on the degree of freedom of the symmetrization spinor , and can be mapped onto @xmath55 local @xmath12 measurements via a local unitary on each of the @xmath55 auxiliary qubits and a constant shift of each local outcome by 1 .",
    "this observable @xmath56 in the enlarged space corresponds to observable @xmath23 in the simulated space , namely , @xmath57 where the bosonic(fermionic ) wave function @xmath58(@xmath59 ) is given in terms of the corresponding symmetrization spinor as @xmath60 .",
    "therefore , with a single implementation , one can obtain the measurement outcome for both the fermionic and bosonic cases , postselected on the statistics control qubit .",
    "one may also measure cross correlation between fermionic and bosonic statistics , which will cancel out for permutationally invariant @xmath13 due to the superselection rule , but can serve as a consistency check in the quantum simulation .",
    "this may be done via the measurement of the observable @xmath61 in the enlarged space , where @xmath62 acts on @xmath44 , which in this case is not postselected .",
    "we point out that , while the correspondence between the expectation values of the operators @xmath63 in the embedding space and @xmath23 in the simulated space is direct , the same does not hold true for higher moments of the operator @xmath63 .",
    "for instance @xmath64 the direct consequence of this is that the variance of our observable in the embedding space grows exponentially with the number of simulated particles , forcing us to enlarge the size of the sample of measurements in order to preserve the accuracy of the retrieved expectation value .",
    "this fact will as well set a limitation on the accuracy to which correlations between fermions and bosons can be measured , and therefore the precision to which the permutation invariance of an unknown hamiltonian can be tested . however , for a small enough number of particles our method is still feasible , and could shed light on physically relevant problems .",
    "we include for illustrative purposes an extensive analysis of two- and three - particle cases , as well as of the switching between bose - hubbard and fermi - hubbard models via our techniques .",
    "these cases can be implemented via purely analog or digital - analog techniques  @xcite .      as a first example",
    ", we consider purely spin dynamics , consisting of the exchange coupling hamiltonian acting on a two - particle system , @xmath65 accordingly , the simulating hamiltonian acting on the enlarged symmetrization spinor in the embedding hilbert space reads @xmath66 physically this would correspond to having two qubits evolving under the exchange hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ exchange hamiltonian ] ) while a third qubit is left untouched .",
    "this kind of hamiltonians has already been implemented in ions  @xcite and in superconducting circuits  @xcite , among others .",

    "the expectation values of these observables are time independent and have different values for all the three cases considered here , @xmath74 we can therefore differentiate via @xmath23 the bosonic and fermionic wave function dynamics , and their correlation vanishes , as expected , due to the superselection rule .      here",

    "the corresponding hamiltonian for the bose - hubbard model , @xmath154 differs from the one for the fermi - hubbard model , @xmath155 , given the distinct particle statistics .",
    "moreover , in the bosonic case , @xmath156 is the symmetrized superposition of having one particle in each mode , where @xmath157 denotes particle 1 in mode @xmath3 and particle 2 in mode @xmath158 , while the fermionic case @xmath159 corresponds to the antisymmetrized superposition .",
    "our embedding technique applied in this case considers the states @xmath160 , @xmath161 , @xmath162 , and @xmath163 . a superposition @xmath164 written in spinor form , @xmath165^t$ ] , will then have the constraints in the bose - hubbard case , @xmath166 , and in the fermi - hubbard case , @xmath167 , @xmath168 .",
    "this allows one to obtain the bosonic(fermionic ) wave function @xmath169 via application of the corresponding transformation upon @xmath170 , and the hamiltonians @xmath171 can be straightforwardly embedded in this enlarged spinor similarly as before .",
    "we have proposed the implementation of a quantum - particle - statistics switch with an embedding quantum simulator .",
    "we show that the simulated indistinguishable particles can change _ in situ _ , from bosons to fermions and from fermions to bosons , during a quantum evolution , via their encoding in an enlarged spinor .",
    "our proposal scales favorably in terms of ancillary - qubit resources with the number of particles and can be implemented with little additional effort in a conventional quantum simulator with mature platforms such as trapped ions , quantum photonics , or superconducting circuits .",
    "furthermore , additional exotic species as parastatistics can be encoded with small modifications of this protocol .",
    "the possibility to perform a switch of quantum particle statistics enhances the toolbox of quantum simulations , for unphysical operations as well as symmetry transformations , increasing their versatility .",
