    "wireless networks have the promising applications of in many important scenarios ( like battlefield networks , emergency networks , disaster recovery networks ) .",
    "however , due to the energy constrained and broadcast properties , the consideration of secrecy and lifetime optimization in such networks is of great importance for ensuring the high transmission efficiency and confidentiality requirements of these applications .",
    "two - hop wireless networks , as a building block for large multi - hop network system , have been a class of basic and important networking scenarios @xcite .",
    "the analysis and design of transmission protocol in basic two - hop relay networks serves as the foundation for secure information exchange of general multi - hop network system .    for the lifetime optimization",
    ", an uneven use of the nodes may cause some nodes die much earlier , thus creating holes in the network , or worse , leaving the network disconnected , which is critical in military or emergency networks . for this problem ,",
    "a lot of protocols were proposed to balance the traffic across the various relay nodes and avoids overloading any relay node in various wireless networks , especially energy constrained wireless environments ( like wireless sensor networks ) [ 7 - 16](see section v for related works ) .",
    "we notice there is tradeoff between the load - balance capacity and transmission efficiency and still no approaches can flexibly control it .",
    "regarding the secrecy , the traditional cryptographic approach can provide a standard information security .",
    "however , the everlasting secrecy can not be achieved by such approach , because the adversary can record the transmitted messages and try any way to break them @xcite .",
    "especially , recent advances in high - performance computation ( e.g. quantum computing ) further complicate acquiring long - lasting security via cryptographic approaches @xcite .",
    "this motivates the consideration of signaling scheme in physical layer secrecy framework to provide a strong form of security , where a degraded signal at an eavesdropper is always ensured such that the original data can be hardly recovered regardless of how the signal is processed at the eavesdropper @xcite@xcite@xcite .",
    "the secure and reliable transmission in physical layer secrecy framework for two - hop relay wireless networks has been studied and a lot of secure transmission protocols were proposed in [ 17 - 28](see section v for related works ) .",
    "these works mainly focus on the maximum secrecy capacity and minimum energy consumption , in which the system node with the best link condition to source and destination is selected as information relay .",
    "these protocols are attractive in the sense that provides very effective resistance against eavesdroppers . however , since the channel state is relatively constant during a fixed time period , some relay nodes with good link conditions always prefer to relay packages , which results in a severe load - balance problem and a quick node energy depletion .",
    "such , these protocol is not suitable for energy - limited wireless networks ( like wireless sensor networks ) . in order to realize load - balance ,",
    "y. shen et al .",
    "further proposed a random relay selection protocol @xcite@xcite , in which the relay node is random selected from the system nodes .",
    "however , this protocol has lower transmission efficiency .",
    "such , it is only suitable for large scale wireless network environment with stringent energy consumption constraint .    in summary",
    ", the available secure transmission protocols can not provide a flexible load - balance control , which may significantly limit their application scopes .",
    "this paper extends conventional secure cooperative transmission protocols to a general case to enable the load - balance to be flexibly controlled in the two - hop relay wireless networks without the knowledge of eavesdropper channels and locations .",
    "the main contributions of this paper are as follows :    * this paper proposes a new transmission protocol 2hr-(@xmath2 ) for two - hop relay wireless network without the knowledge eavesdropper channels and locations , where the relay is randomly selected from the first @xmath0 preferable assistant relays located in the circle area with the radius @xmath1 and the center at the middle between source and destination .",
    "this protocol is general protocol , and can flexibly control the tradeoff between the load - balance among relays and the transmission efficiency by a proper setting of @xmath0 and @xmath1 under the premise of specified secure and reliable requirements . * in case that the path - loss is identical between all pairs of nodes , theoretic analysis of 2hr-(@xmath2 ) protocol is provided to determine the corresponding exact results on the number of eavesdroppers one network can tolerate to satisfy a specified requirement and shows that the 2hr-(@xmath2 ) protocol covers all the available secure transmission protocols as special cases , like ones with the optimal relay selection ( @xmath3 , @xmath4 ) @xcite@xcite@xcite@xcite and with the random relay selection ( @xmath7 , @xmath5 i.e. the number of system nodes)@xcite@xcite . * in case that the path - loss between each pair of nodes also depends on the distance between them , a coordinate system is presented and the theoretic analysis of 2hr-(@xmath2 ) protocol is provided to determine the corresponding exact results on the number of eavesdroppers one network can tolerate to satisfy a specified requirement and shows that the 2hr-(@xmath2 ) protocol covers all the available secure transmission protocols as special cases , like ones with relay selected from relay selection region ( @xmath8)@xcite .",
    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents system models and the 2hr-(@xmath2 ) protocol .",
    "section iii presents the theoretic analysis in case of equal path - loss between all node pairs .",
    "section iv presents the theoretic analysis in case that path - loss between each node pair also depends on their relative locations .",

    "a two - hop wireless network scenario is considered where a source node @xmath9 wishes to communicate securely with its destination node @xmath10 with the help of multiple relay nodes @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 . also present in the environment",
    "are @xmath15 eavesdroppers @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath13 , @xmath18 without knowledge of channels and locations .",
    "the relay nodes and eavesdroppers are independent and also uniformly distributed in the network , as illustrated in fig.1 .",

    "cooperative relay scheme is used in the two - hop transmission.,title=\"fig:\",width=240 ] .      consider the transmission from a transmitter @xmath22 to a receiver @xmath23 , and denote the @xmath24 symbol transmitted by node @xmath22 by @xmath25 .",

    "the sinr @xmath37 from @xmath22 to @xmath23 is then given by    @xmath38    for a legitimate node and an eavesdropper , we use two separate sinr thresholds @xmath39 and @xmath40 to define the minimum sinr required to recover the transmitted messages for legitimate node and eavesdropper , respectively .",
    "therefore , a system node ( the selected relay or destination ) is able to decode a packet if and only if its received sinr is greater than @xmath39 , whereas each eavesdropper try to achieve target sinr @xmath40 to recover the transmitted message .",
    "however , from an information - theoretic perspective , we can map to a secrecy rate formulation @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "hence , we can also think the @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be set by the desired secrecy rate of the system .",
    "notice the available transmission protocols have their own advantages and disadvantages in terms of the transmission efficiency and energy consumption , and thus are suitable for different network scenarios .",
    "with respect to these protocols as special cases , a general transmission protocol 2hr-(@xmath2 ) is proposed to control the balance of load distributed among the relays and works as follows .    1 .",

    "since the parameter @xmath1 is no effect on relay selection , the relay selection region is the whole network area with @xmath57 .",
