    "one of the most exciting prospects of coulomb blockade is the realization of a current standard based on periodically transferring single electrons through the device @xcite . in order to minimize higher order tunnelling processes which limit the accuracy ,",
    "a chain of tunnelling junctions was used @xcite .",
    "quite recently , a single electron shuttle mechanism which is based on mechanical oscillations between two electrodes was suggested by gorelik _",
    "the major advantage of a mechanically driven single electron transfer is that higher order processes are negligible .    in the original suggestion of a mechanical single electron shuttle a metallic island",
    "is connected via organic molecules to two electrodes .",
    "one of the electrodes is positive and the other is negatively biased . for mechanically soft molecules self - excitation",
    "is expected to internally drive oscillations of the island which transfers charge at frequency @xmath1 .",
    "because of coulomb blockade an integer number of electrons is loaded onto the grain close to one turning point , and the same number of electrons is unloaded close to the other . the number of electrons transferred per cycle is thus expected to be @xmath2\\ , , \\label{eq : n_average}\\ ] ] where @xmath3 is the applied voltage and @xmath4 the island capacitance relative to the electrodes .",
    "the average current is given by @xmath5 .",
    "if the island is situated between the two electrodes there should be either @xmath6 or @xmath7 electrons on it depending on which electrode it is coming from .",
    "a first step towards an experimental realization of a mechanical single electron shuttle was undertaken by erbe _",
    "the authors designed a semiconductor device where a mechanical clapper oscillates between two electrodes - _ i.e. _ the oscillation is now externally driven with the average number of electrons transferred in each cycle of order @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "this experiment which works similar to a bell is still in the classical regime , _",
    "i.e. _ coulomb blockade is not relevant here .",
    "the aim in a future experimental setup with a metallic island on the tip of the clapper is to obtain an electron shuttle mechanism which is limited to single electrons by coulomb repulsion .",
    "since the tunnelling resistance @xmath9 increases exponentially with the distance @xmath10 between the island and the electrodes ( @xmath11 ) , tunnelling is suppressed exponentially when the island is in the middle between the two electrodes ( both the oscillation amplitude and the distance between the two electrodes is much larger than @xmath12 ) .",
    "for the same reason both cotunnelling and simultaneous tunnelling between the island and the electrodes can be neglected . in",
    "order for electrons to tunnel the amplitude of the oscillation has to be large compared with the typical tunnelling distance @xmath12 . in the experiments by erbe _",
    "the oscillation amplitude is of order 100 nm ( compared to a few nanometers as suggested by gorelik _",
    "et al . _ ) and thus much larger than @xmath13 .    in our present work",
    "we investigate the accuracy of a mechanically driven single electron shuttle using a master equation approach @xcite .",
    "the master equation is solved numerically and also analytically in a simplified form . in particular , we calculate both the average number of electrons transferred per period which in general is different from the simple result ( [ eq : n_average ] ) and the root mean square fluctuations @xmath14 . as one of our main results , it turns out that optimum operation with @xmath15 is obtained for long contact times ( @xmath16 ) and sufficiently low temperatures ( @xmath17 ) .",
