    "recently , brownian motors have attracted considerable attention stimulated by research on molecular motors . a brownian motor , which appeared in feynman s famous textbook for the first time as a thermal ratchet  @xcite ,",
    "is the machine which can rectify thermal fluctuations and product a directed current . until now",
    ", several models of a brownian motor have been proposed .",
    "the most received and extensively researched system consists of brownian particles subjected to a gaussian white noise whose intensity is characterized by a temperature for the environment  @xcite .",
    "there are other types of brownian motor models .",
    "in particular , it is known that a brownian particle under non - uniform temperature profile moves directedly on the average when the potential profile synchronizes the temperature profile but they are not same shapes  @xcite . here , the motion of the particle was assumed to be described by langevin dynamics supplemented with a state dependent noise .    until now",
    ", the energetic consideration for a langevin dynamics with uniform temperature has been developed  @xcite .",
    "in fact , the efficiency for the feynman s ratchet was discussed based on the notions of heat and work which are defined properly in a consistent way with thermodynamic laws .",
    "then , the question we address here is how to define heat and work in non - uniform temperature systems .",
    "thus , our aim of this paper is to extend the energetic consideration so as to apply to such systems .",
    "it will turn out that this question is not trivially solved owing to the nature of the state dependent noise .    in this paper , so as to avoid the complications for the state dependent noise , we first derive a fokker - plank equation from a uniquely defined kramers equation by employing the perturbative expansion .",
    "there are many perturbation methods to derive a fokker - plank equation  @xcite .",
    "since we treat an delicate problem , the most formal theory without heuristicity might be best .",
    "thus , we adopt renormalization group ( rg ) method , whose applicability to differential equations has been established recently  @xcite .",
    "then , following the sekimoto s formulation  @xcite , we make an energetic interpretation of the system .",
    "after that , as applications , two kinds of non - uniform temperature systems are analyzed . as the first example",
    ", we study the thomson effect for non - interacting particles and show that the thomson coefficient is @xmath0 . as the second",
    ", we calculate the work efficiency for the bttiker s model and show that the carnot limit is realized under the quasistatic condition .",
    "this article is organized as follows . in section2",
    ", we review a sort of dilemma caused by the nature of a state dependent noise . in section3 ,",
    "the fokker - plank equation is derived from the kramers equation by employing the renormalization group method . in section4 , we define heat for the system described by the fokker - plank equation . in section5",
    ", we analyze above two examples .",
    "section6 is devoted to a summary and conclusions of this work .",
    "in this section , we review a dilemma caused by ill - defined nature of a langevin equation with a position dependent noise intensity  @xcite    @xmath1    @xmath2    where @xmath3 is a friction constant of a brownian particle , @xmath4 is an external force , @xmath5 is a temperature profile and we have assumed that a boltzmann constant @xmath6 is equal to the unity . owing to space dependence of a noise intensity , the following difficulty arises . because the noise has no correlation time , it is not yet clear which @xmath7 value one has to use in the function @xmath8 in eq.([overdamped ] ) . if , for instance , @xmath9 is considered as a sum of peaked functions with no width , the stochastic variable @xmath7 will jump at every time when such a peaked function occurs .",
    "the question then arises : which @xmath7 value must use in @xmath8 ?",
    "one may use the value @xmath7 just before the jump , after the jump , or some value between these two values . from a purely mathematical point",
    "one can not answer this question , but one has to use a prescription as additional specification . among some prescriptions ,",
    "there are two representatives called it and stratonovich . under the it prescription ,",
    "the value of @xmath7 is inserted before the jump , while the mean value between before and after the jump is opted for , under the stratonovich prescription .",
    "the fokker - plank formalism explicitly shows this prescription dependence as follows : a fokker - plank equation with the stratonovich prescription is written as    @xmath10    while a fokker - plank equation with the it prescription is written as    @xmath11    such a dependence of an apparently unique equation on prescriptions is called `` it - stratonovich dilemma '' , and their difference    @xmath12    is called a spurious flow .",
    "owing to the existence of this dilemma , we can not proceed to discuss energetics , because descriptions of energetics are subject to prescriptions .    however , it is possible to avoid this dilemma by considering the effect of inertia of a brownian particle .",
    "an underdamped type of a langevin equation is written as    @xmath13    @xmath14    where we have assumed the mass of a brownian particle @xmath15 is equal to the unity . from eq.([underdamped ] ) , we see that each delta peak in @xmath16 causes the jump in @xmath17 , but no jump in @xmath18 and , therefore , @xmath8 . since @xmath16 does not cause a jump in the noise intensity , the solution is uniquely determined for the given @xmath16 . as a result ,",
    "the evolution of a distribution function @xmath19 is uniquely denoted by    @xmath20    which is called a kramers equation .",
    "since there is no complication for the prescription dependence , we discuss eqs.([underdamped ] ) and ( [ kramers ] ) .",
    "in this section , employing a renormalization group method , we derive a fokker - plank equation from a kramers equation with non - uniform temperature .",
    "now we restrict ourselves to the one dimensional case so as to simplify the analysis .",
    "first , we rewrite eq.([kramers ] ) as    @xmath21    we consider a case that @xmath3 is sufficiently large , that is , a constant @xmath22 is regarded as a small parameter . to emphasize smallness of the constant , we rewrite @xmath22 as @xmath23",
    ". also , for the later convenience , we rescale the time variable @xmath24 to @xmath25 .",
    "the resultant equation takes the form    @xmath26    this rewriting of the time variable is not essential to the problem , but necessary for us to employ the renormalization group method properly .    now we seek solutions under the condition @xmath27 .",
    "we first expand the distribution function with @xmath23 in such a way that @xmath28 identifying terms of the same order , we obtain @xmath29    we may successively solve these equations from lower order . as preparation for solving them ,",
    "we define the fokker - plank operator as    @xmath30    and introduce the eigenfunctions of the operator , which are written in the form    @xmath31    where @xmath32 is the n - th hermite polynomial .",
    "the characteristic equation is given by    @xmath33    we also expand @xmath34 in terms of eigenfunctions :    @xmath35    now , let us solve eq.([order0 ] ) .",
    "decomposing left - handed - side of eq.([order0 ] ) in terms of the eigenfunctions , we obtain @xmath36 we notice that @xmath37 , @xmath38 , decays exponentially in time .",
    "thus , discarding such terms , we obtain @xmath39 where @xmath40 is an arbitrary function in @xmath7 .",
    "the physical picture behind this equation is as follows : in the fast time scale @xmath41 , the velocity distribution relaxes to the maxwellian rapidly and space distribution stays just as it is .",
    "we next proceed to calculate the higher order terms . substituting the solution eq.([p0 ] ) into eq.([order1 ] ) , we obtain    @xmath42    where @xmath43 denotes @xmath44 . eq.([set ] ) leads to a set of equations @xmath45    neglecting terms decaying exponentially in time , we obtain    @xmath46    then we substitute @xmath47 into the @xmath48 equation so that the right - handed - side of the equation takes the form    @xmath49    in the same way as before , we derive equations for @xmath50 . in particular , @xmath51 satisfies    @xmath52    where    @xmath53    therefore , @xmath54 is expressed as    @xmath55    and the asymptotic expansion up to the second order is written as @xmath56 this shows that @xmath19 has a secular term which is unbounded in time .",
    "owing to the existence of the secular term , the perturbation is valid only in a short time interval satisfying @xmath57 .",
    "improve the result of naive perturbation , we apply the renormalization group method .",
    "we introduce a time @xmath58 when the initial condition for @xmath59 is given .",
    "that is , we rewrite eq.([rewriting ] ) as    @xmath60    since @xmath19 should not depend on the choice of @xmath58 , we impose the condition    @xmath61    which is called a renormalization group equation  @xcite .",
    "this yields    @xmath62    restoring the time scale to the original one and using eq.([secularterm ] ) , we finally obtain @xmath63",
    "equation ( [ reduc ] ) takes the same form as a fokker - plank equation given by eq.([ito - fokker - plank ] ) .",
    "therefore , an overdamped langevin equation corresponding to eq.([reduc ] ) is simply given by eq.([overdamped ] ) when the it prescription is assumed . however , we notice that this simpleness dose not ensure the uniqueness of prescription",
    ". we can consider that eq.([reduc ] ) corresponds the langevin equation given by    @xmath64    when the stratonovich prescription is assumed .",
    "although we have two apparently different forms of langevin equations , we restrict ourselves to the stratonovich prescription because the stratonovich prescription is more suitable for description of energetics , as we will see below .",
    "the revision term which we call the third term of right - handed - side of eq.([aim ] ) is relevant when one faces energetics .",
    "following sekimito  @xcite , we define heats for the systems described by an overdamped and an underdamped langevin equation with a position dependent noise intensity as the following stochastic integrals    @xmath65    @xmath66    where the integral is assumed in the stratonovich sense . substituting eq.([aim ] ) to eq.([overheat ] ) , we obtain the decomposition of the heat of the overdamped case    @xmath67    @xmath68    where @xmath69 is the part which an external force contributes to and @xmath70 is the part which position dependent temperature contributes to . on the other hand , substituting eq.([underdamped ] ) to eq.([underheat ] ) , we get the decomposition of the heat of the underdamped case    @xmath71    @xmath72    here , we show that @xmath70 can be derived as the first order contribution to @xmath73 for the high friction limit . taking an ensemble average about both - handed - sides of eq.([qa ] ) , we get    @xmath74    neglecting anything but the lowest contribution , we obtain    @xmath75^{x_r}_{x_l}\\\\ & = & \\langle q_t \\rangle - \\frac{1}{2 } \\int dt \\bigl [ t(x ) j(x , t ) \\bigl]^{x_r}_{x_l } , \\label{vs}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where the system has been assumed to be an interval @xmath76 $ ] .",
    "the surface term may be interpreted as the energy flowing from the outside of the system . then , as far as the energy exported form the heat bath is concerned , we have only to pay attention to the bulk term .",
    "thus , we conclude that @xmath70 is the lowest order contribution to @xmath73 , that is ,    @xmath77    we shortly account for the meaning of the revision term .",
    "we saw in section3 that the velocity distribution function rapidly relaxes to the position dependent maxwellian in the high friction case .",
    "the averaged energy of each position @xmath78 is written as    @xmath79    this equation implies that the kinetic energy contributes to the effective potential via the equipartition law .",
    "thus , the effective potential may lead to the revision term .",
    "in this section , we investigate two examples as application of the energetic interpretation made in section4 .    * ex .",
    "1 ) thomson effect *    the thomson effect , one of the thermoelectric effect , is the phenomenon that some heat is generated besides joule heat when a current flows in a conductor at which a temperature gradient is charged .",
    "the generated heat is called thomson heat .",
    "according to phenomenological laws , thomson heat generated per unit time between two points of the conductor , written as @xmath80 , takes the form    @xmath81    where @xmath82 is the temperature difference between two points , @xmath83 is a current and @xmath58 is a material constant called `` thomson coefficient ''  @xcite .",
    "now let us calculate thomson heat from a kinematic point of view .",
    "we assume the system in question is an open interval @xmath84 on an real axis and particle reservoirs are points @xmath85 .",
    "next we give a few conditions .",
    "we assume that the particle number distribution is realized with @xmath86 in each reservoirs , temperature @xmath5 is externally given and there is no mechanical potential . using these conditions and eq.([reduc ] ) , the problem we solve is written as    @xmath87    now we restrict ourselves to a steady state . from eq.([glk ] ) , a steady state distribution @xmath88 satisfies the relation    @xmath89    where @xmath83 means a particle number flux and is a constant whose value is decided by boundary conditions .",
    "the solution of eq.([suo ] ) takes the following form    @xmath90    the heat generated in the system is given by    @xmath91    we take an ensemble average for both - handed - sides of eq.([ttt ] ) , and then we obtain    @xmath92    where @xmath82 is defined by    @xmath93    and we have used the fact that @xmath83 is a constant .",
    "differentiating both - handed - sides of eq.([ppo ] ) with @xmath24 , we finally obtain    @xmath94    comparing this relation with the the phenomenological law eq.([pheno ] ) , we obtain    @xmath95    notice that , in our model , interactions between particles are not considered .",
    "if the effect of the interactions are taken into account , the value of thomson coefficient would be shifted from 1/2 .    * ex .",
    "2 ) bttiker s model *    bttiker derived a rigorous steady solution of fokker - plank equations with a position dependent temperature  @xcite .",
    "let us first review his results by employing eq.([reduc ] ) .",
    "it is assumed that the system is defined over an interval @xmath96 $ ] with periodic boundary conditions .",
    "it is also assumed that the force @xmath4 is given by    @xmath97    this model has a steady current solution expressed by    @xmath98    where z is a normalization constant  @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ current ] ) implies that a finite current exists when @xmath99 and @xmath5 satisfy the condition    @xmath100    now , in order to extract the work from this system , a load is superimposed .",
    "that is , the form of the mechanical potential is assumed as    @xmath101    where @xmath102 is a periodic function with a period @xmath103 ,    @xmath104    and @xmath105 corresponds to the load per unit length .",
    "when the temperaute @xmath106 and a periodic part of the potential @xmath107 satisfy the inequality    @xmath108    a brownian particle climbs the slope of potential so that it works against the load . for simplicity",
    ", we assume the temperature function as    @xmath109 \\\\ t_2 \\ \\ : x \\in [ a , h ] , \\end{array } \\right.\\ ] ]    where @xmath110 .",
    "let us calculate the work efficiency defined by    @xmath111    where @xmath112 is averaged heat extracted from the hotter heat bath whose temperature is @xmath113 , and @xmath114 is averaged work done by the particle against the load .",
    "since the hotter heat bath is located in the interval @xmath115 $ ] , @xmath116 is written as    @xmath117 } \\bigl\\ { \\frac{\\partial u}{\\partial x } + \\frac{1}{2 } \\frac{\\partial t}{\\partial x } \\bigl\\ } dx(t).\\ ] ]    taking an ensemble average , we get the denominator of eq.([effdef ] )    @xmath118    the work against the load is defined by    @xmath119    ( for more rigorous definition of work , see @xcite and @xcite . )",
    "then we can calculate the numerator eq.([effdef ] ) as    @xmath120    from eq.([qqq ] ) and eq.([www ] ) , the efficiency is expressed as    @xmath121    we further notice that @xmath122 and @xmath123 are related to @xmath113 and @xmath124 for the quasistatic limit @xmath125 .",
    "in fact , using eq.([current ] ) , we get the relation    @xmath126    from eq.([effi ] ) and eq.([quasi ] ) , we obtain the efficiency for the quasistatic limit    @xmath127    this is equal to the carnot efficiency .",
    "recently , sakaguchi has derived the carnot efficiency by analyzing a model with stochastic boundary conditions  @xcite .",
    "his model turns out to be equivalent to that the limit @xmath128 is taken in our model .",
    "lastly , we address a few comments about above two examples . in example1",
    "the revision term intrinsically contributes to the averaged heat , while the revision term has no contribution in example2 .",
    "this difference is caused by whether or not periodic boundary conditions are assumed . as a matter of fact",
    ", we can generally say that , in one dimensional system , once a steady state is formed , the revision term does not affect to the averaged heat under periodic boundary conditions .",
    "since the steady condition leads to constant flux by the equation of continuity , the averaged value of heat is given by    @xmath129    this is certainly equal to zero when periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "however , this matter is limited to one dimensional systems .",
    "when the dimension is higher than one ,    @xmath130    is derived from the equation of continuity . in this case",
    ", the circulation @xmath131 is defined by    @xmath132    which may play an important role in energetics  @xcite .",
    "we expect that the revision term contributes to the heat coupled with the circulation .",
    "it is a future problem to study energetics in high - dimensional non - uniform temperature systems .",
    "in this paper , we have proposed an energetic interpretation about a stochastic process described by a langevin equation with non - uniform temperature .",
    "we analyzed two examples as applications of the energetic interpretation .",
    "as the first example , the thomson coefficient for non - interacting particles was proved to be @xmath0 .",
    "the second example concerns the bttiker s model .",
    "we calculated the work efficiency and showed that the carnot efficiency is realized under the quasistatic condition .",
