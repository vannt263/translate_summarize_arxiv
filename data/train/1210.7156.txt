    "many fundamental wireless network allocation tasks can be formulated as constraint satisfaction problems , including channel and sub - carrier allocation  @xcite , tdma scheduling  @xcite , scrambling code allocation  @xcite , network coding  @xcite and so on .",
    "importantly , these tasks must often be solved while respecting strong communication constraints due , for example , to the range over which devices can communicate being smaller than the range over which they interfere or otherwise interact .",
    "recently , fully decentralised communication - free learning ( cfl ) algorithms have been proposed for solving general constraint satisfaction problems without the need for message - passing  @xcite .",
    "these cfl algorithms exploit local sensing to infer satisfaction / dissatisfaction of constraints , thereby avoiding the need for message - passing and use stochastic learning to converge to a satisfying assignment with probability one .",
    "convergence of these cfl algorithms to a satisfying assignment is , however , only guaranteed when _ all _ devices participating in a constraint are able to sense the satisfaction / dissatisfaction of the constraint .",
    "this sensing requirement is violated in a number of important practical problems , for example in wireless networks with hidden terminals .",
    "the main contribution of the present paper is a new analysis of cfl - like algorithms which establishes that much weaker requirements on sensing are sufficient to guarantee convergence to a solution .",
    "the analysis of stochastic learning algorithms is challenging , and part of the technical contribution is the development of novel analysis tools .",
    "we present a number of examples demonstrating the efficacy of cfl - like algorithms when subject to strong sensing as well as communication constraints , and explore the impact of sensing constraints on the rate of convergence .    a constraint satisfaction problem ( csp ) consists of @xmath0 variables , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 clauses , i.e. @xmath3-valued functions , @xmath4 .",
    "an assignment @xmath5 is a solution if all clauses simultaneously evaluate to @xmath6 . in problems derived from network applications ,",
    "each constrained variable @xmath7 is often associated to a physically distinct device , such as an access point or a base - station .",
    "for example , consider a collection of wlans operating in an unlicensed radio band .",
    "each wlan can choose one of several channels to operate on and the wlans require to jointly select channels so as to avoid excessive interference between the wlans .",
    "we can formulate this task as a csp by letting @xmath7 be the channel selected by wlan @xmath8 and defining @xmath9 clauses , one for each pair of wlans which evaluates to one if the wlans are non - interfering , or are out of interference range , and evaluates to zero otherwise .",
    "communication between the devices is impeded by multiple factors : the interference range of a typical wireless device is considerably larger than its communication range , and thus wlans can interfere but may be unable to communicate ; wlans can have different administrative domains that would prevent communication even via a wired backhaul and even if a proper knowledge of the physical location of the different wlans was known .",
    "consequently , the selection of the variables @xmath7 in a distributed manner ( allowing message passing ) is inadmissible , mandating a fully decentralized channel - selection algorithm .    a practical csp solver for this task can only rely on each wlan being able to measure whether or not its current choice of channel is subject to excessive interference .",
    "importantly , observe that this sensing need not be symmetric .",
    "the scenario in figure  [ fig : hidden ] illustrates this feature : here transmissions on link @xmath10 interfere with transmissions on link @xmath11 , but not vice versa transmitter @xmath12 acts as a hidden terminal affecting link @xmath11 .",
    "such asymmetry in sensing is ubiquitous in networks with hidden terminals .",
    "the analysis in  @xcite requires that all links sharing a channel are able to sense whether any one or more of the links is experiencing excessive interference and so dissatisfied , and therefore is not applicable to networks with hidden terminals .     and @xmath13",
    ". transmissions by @xmath12 prevent @xmath14 receiving transmissions by @xmath13 . however , the converse is not true _",
    "i.e. _  transmissions by @xmath13 do not prevent @xmath15 from successfully receiving transmissions by @xmath12 .",
    "link @xmath10 can therefore be satisfied while @xmath11 is dissatisfied .",
    "similarly for the other links shown . associating each edge with a vertex yields graph ( b ) corresponding to ( a ) for which a proper coloring is sought . sensing restrictions then yield the induced oriented graph ( c ) , as explained in section  [ sec : gener - decentr - cp ] . ]    in the present paper our aim is to address this deficiency .",
    "we focus on graph - coloring problems , a subset of general csps , and constructively establish the existence of decentralized learning - based solvers that are able to find satisfying assignments even in the presence of sensing asymmetry .",
    "we establish sufficient conditions on the sensing behaviour to ensure that the solvers find satisfying assignments with probability one .",
    "we demonstrate that these conditions are commonly satisfied in wireless allocation tasks and explore the impact of sensing constraints on the speed which a satisfying assignment is found .    even if in certain settings a limited amount of communication between the devices may be possible , for example by overhearing traffic from some of the interferers , this information is topology dependent and can not be assumed during the design of the algorithm .",
    "the opportunistic exploitation of such partial information is left for future work .",
    "the graph coloring problem has been the subject of a vast literature , from cellular networks ( e.g.  @xcite ) , wireless lans ( e.g.  @xcite and references therein ) and graph theory ( e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "almost all previous work has been concerned either with centralised schemes or with distributed schemes that employ extensive message - passing .",
    "centralised and message - passing schemes have many inherent advantages . in certain situations ,",
    "however , these systems may not be applicable .",
    "for example , differing administrative domains may be present in a network of wlans .",
    "an exception is the work of  @xcite , which proposes a distributed simulated annealing algorithm for joint channel selection and association control in 802.11 wlans .",
    "however , heuristics are used to both terminate the algorithm and to restart it if the network topology changes . network - wide stopping / restarting in a distributed context can be challenging without some form of message - passing .    in the field of graph theory ,",
    "@xcite address the problem of graph coloring , when the amount of colors available is large ( typically @xmath16 ) and allowing some form of message passing in an undirected graph .",
    "the only exception is in  @xcite , where a sort of directionality of the graph is considered : the distributed nodes can make a choice in a hierarchical manner , when @xmath17 , node @xmath18 may keep its choice even if @xmath19 has same color , but this is made possible assuming the existence of this hierarchy is known and that there is still a bidirectional channel available for communication .",
    "this work builds upon the works of the early work of @xcite , then refined and extended by @xcite ; they present a fully decentralised cfl , proven to solve a large class of problems that include graph coloring , but without sensing restrictions .",
    "we will now introduce the problem , using similar notation to  @xcite but extended to encompass sensing restrictions .",
    "let @xmath20 denote an undirected graph with set of vertices @xmath21 and set of edges @xmath22 , where @xmath23 denotes the existence of a pair of directed edges @xmath24 , @xmath25 joining vertices @xmath26 .",
    "note that with this notation the edges in set @xmath27 are directed , since this will prove convenient later when considering oriented subgraphs of @xmath13 .",
    "however , since graph @xmath13 is undirected we have @xmath28 .    a coloring problem ( cp ) on graph @xmath13 with @xmath29 colors",
    "is defined as follows .",
    "let @xmath30 denote the color of vertex @xmath18 , where @xmath31 is the set of available colors , and @xmath5 denote the vector @xmath32 .",
    "define clause @xmath33 for each edge @xmath34 with : @xmath35 we say clause @xmath36 is _ satisfied _ if @xmath37 .",
    "an assignment @xmath5 is said to be satisfying if for all clauses @xmath38 we have @xmath39 .",
    "that is @xmath40 equivalently , @xmath5 is a satisfying assignment if and only if @xmath41 for all edges @xmath42 _ i.e. _ if @xmath43 . a satisfying assignment for a coloring problem",
    "is also called a _",
    "proper coloring_.    the chromatic number @xmath44 of graph @xmath13 is the smallest number of colors such that at least one proper coloring of @xmath13 exists .",
    "that is , we require the number of colors @xmath45 in our palette to be greater or equal than @xmath44 for a satisfying assignment to exist .      given a cp , a cp solver realizes a sequence of vectors @xmath46 such that for any cp that has a satisfying assignment    ( d1 ) : :    for all @xmath47 sufficiently large    @xmath48 for some satisfying assignment    @xmath5 ; ( d2 ) : :    if @xmath49 is the first entry in the sequence    @xmath46 such that @xmath50 is a    satisfying assignment , then @xmath51 for    all @xmath52 .    in order to give criteria for classification of decentralized cp solvers , we re - write the lhs of equation   to focus on the satisfaction of each variable @xmath53 where @xmath54 consists of all edges in @xmath27 that contain vertex @xmath18 , @xmath55 note that we adopt the convention of including edges in @xmath56 which are incoming to vertex @xmath18 , but since @xmath28 then @xmath57 .",
    "a decentralized cp solver is equivalent to a parallel solver , where each variable @xmath7 runs independently an instance of the solver , having only the information on whether all of the clauses that @xmath7 participates in are satisfied or at least one clause is unsatisfied .",
    "the solver located at variable @xmath7 must make its decisions only relying on this information .",
    "a decentralized cp solver is a cp solver that for each variable @xmath7 , must select its next value based only on the evaluation of @xmath58 that is , the decision is made without knowing    ( d3 ) : :    the assignment of @xmath59 for @xmath60 .",

    "( d5 ) : :    the clauses @xmath63 for @xmath38 .",
    "sensing restrictions mean , for example , that a hidden terminal is unable to sense whether or not its transmissions are causing excessive interference to the set of receivers for which it is hidden . in other words ,",
    "variable @xmath7 can only evaluate @xmath64 rather than @xmath65 , where @xmath66 ( where equality holds only if sensing restrictions are absent ) .    a decentralised cp solver where is replaced with the restriction that for each variable @xmath67 , must select its next value based only on an evaluation of    ( d6 ) : :    @xmath68 , where    _ information set _",
    "@xmath66 is a subset of    edges incoming to node @xmath18 and we adopt the convention    that @xmath69 .    note that despite the sensing restrictions we still require the solver to satisfy @xmath70 and find a satisfying assignment , for all @xmath47 sufficiently large @xmath48 with @xmath71 .",
    "it is important to note that an assignment @xmath5 may ensure @xmath72 , @xmath73 but might have @xmath74 for one or more variables and so need not be satisfying in the absence of sensing restrictions it may not be a proper coloring .",
    "we therefore require the following sensing condition in order to satisfy @xmath70 :    [ th : d7 ] let @xmath75 .",
    "suppose that for each pair of edges @xmath23 in @xmath27 , at least one directed edge appears in at least one information set @xmath76 for some vertex @xmath18 @xmath77 .",
    "then an assignment @xmath5 is satisfying with sensing restrictions iff it is satisfying in the absence of sensing restrictions .",
    "that is , @xmath78 @xmath79 @xmath80 .",
    "suppose @xmath81 .",
    "that is , @xmath82 . by definition , @xmath83 and since @xmath77 the result follows .",
    "conversely , suppose @xmath80 .",
    "since @xmath84 , the result immediately follows",
    ".    it will be useful to consider oriented partial graph @xmath85 induced by the information set @xmath86 .",
    "this graph has the same set @xmath87 of vertices as graph @xmath13 for which a proper coloring is sought , but the edges are now defined by the set of _ ordered _ pairs @xmath88 .",
    "we say @xmath24 if there is a directed edge from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , and @xmath89 if there is no edge from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "for example , figure [ fig : hidden](c ) gives the graph @xmath90 corresponding to figure [ fig : hidden](b ) .",
    "here , the directed edge from @xmath10 to @xmath11 indicates that while @xmath11 can sense whether the edge between @xmath10 and @xmath11 is satisfied or not , @xmath10 can not .      before proceeding ,",
    "we briefly demonstrate that several important resource allocation tasks in wireless networks fall within our framework of graph coloring with sensing restrictions .",
    "consider a network of @xmath0 wireless links @xmath91 , each consisting of a transmitter @xmath92 and a receiver @xmath93 .",
    "let @xmath94 denote the transmit power of @xmath92 and @xmath95 denote the path loss between the transmitter @xmath92 of link @xmath18 and the receiver @xmath96 of link @xmath19 .",
    "the received power at @xmath93 from @xmath97 is therefore @xmath98",
    ". each link can select one from a set @xmath99 of available channels to use .",
    "link @xmath18 would like to select a channel in such a way that the signal power impinging on the receiver @xmath93 from other links sharing the same channel is less than a specified threshold @xmath100 ",
    "@xmath100 may , for example , be selected to ensure that the sinr at @xmath93 is above a target threshold .",
    "each link @xmath18 can sense that another link @xmath19 is sharing the same channel when the received power @xmath101 ( this might correspond to the minimum interference power that causes decoding errors on the link or to the carrier - sense threshold in 802.11 ) .    to formulate this as a coloring problem ,",
    "let @xmath102 be the palette of available colors .",
    "associate variable @xmath7 with wireless link @xmath18 , @xmath103 , with the value of @xmath30 corresponding to the channel selected by link @xmath18",

    "importantly , whenever an edge @xmath105 is in @xmath27 we also add edge @xmath108 to @xmath27 , so that @xmath13 is an undirected graph .",

    "observe that the edges in graph @xmath90 embody the sensing abilities of links , and in general @xmath115 and so @xmath116 .",
    "note that we can readily generalise this formulation to include , for example , the selection of multiple channels / sub - carriers by each link and to allow multiple transmitters and receivers in a link ( which might then correspond to a wlan ) .",
    "when using a time division access scheme , wireless networks need to have a schedule for accessing the channel .",
    "this schedule can be decided in a centralized manner , but it is possible to require a decentralized way of solving the problem .",
    "the classical csma / ca approach to decentralized scheduling does not yield convergence to a single schedule and leads to continual collisions .",
    "recently , there has been interest in decentralized approaches for finding collision - free schedules  @xcite .",

    "time is slotted and partitioned into periodic schedules on length @xmath117 slots .",
    "the transmitter on each link would like to select a slot that is different from the choice made by other transmitters if their collisions would collide ( transmissions in the same slot need not collide when , for example , the two transmitters are located sufficiently far apart ) .",
    "a link is able to sense whether its transmission in a slot was successful or not .    to formulate this as a coloring problem ,",

    "consider the stochastic learning algorithm , introduced by @xcite , described in algorithm  [ alg : gcfl ] with the only difference here of envisaging sensing restrictions .",
    "an instance of this algorithm is run in parallel for every variable .",

    "each instance of the algorithm maintains a vector @xmath124 , that represents the probability of choosing color @xmath19 at next iteration .",
    "if satisfied , it will choose the same color with probability one .",
    "otherwise , the probability mass will be partially moved from color @xmath19 to the other colors  @xcite .    algorithm  [ alg : gcfl ] contains design parameters @xmath125 , @xmath126 . in the examples in this paper we select @xmath127 , @xmath128 , and do not optimise these values to particular settings . in order to be a decentralised cp solver with sensing restrictions , algorithm  [ alg : gcfl ]",
    "must satisfy conditions @xmath129 .",
    "we can see immediately that algorithm  [ alg : gcfl ] satisfies @xmath130 .",

    "( d2 ) algorithm  [ alg : gcfl ] also satisfies the ( d2 ) criterion that it sticks with a solution from the first time one is found . to see this , note that the effect of step 5 is that if a variable experiences success in all clauses @xmath132 that it participates in it continues to select the same value with probability 1 .",
    "thus if all variables are simultaneously satisfied in all clauses , if @xmath131 , then the same assignment will be reselected indefinitely with probability 1 .",
    "it remains to verify satisfaction of @xmath70 , convergence of the algorithm to a satisfying assignment , which is the subject of the next section .",
    "recall the following definition :    a path of length @xmath133 in oriented graph @xmath85 is a sequence @xmath134 of edges in @xmath113 such that the terminal endpoint of edge @xmath135 is the initial endpoint of edge @xmath136 for all @xmath137 .",
    "oriented graph @xmath85 is strongly connected if it contains a path starting in @xmath138 and ending in @xmath139 , for each pair of distinct vertices @xmath140 .",
    "we now state our main analytic result :    [ thm : bounds ] consider any satisfiable coloring problem with graph @xmath20 and information sets @xmath86 .",

    "they do , however , allow us to conclude the following corollary proving that if a solution exists , algorithm  [ alg : gcfl ] will almost surely find it :    [ thm : issolver ] for any coloring problem that admits a proper coloring and that fulfills conditions ( a ) and ( b ) , algorithm  [ alg : gcfl ] will find a proper coloring in almost surely finite time .",
    "intuitively , we expect that sensing restrictions may increase the time it takes to find a satisfying assignment . when @xmath143 , @xmath73 ( perfect sensing ) then @xmath144 and our analysis yields the following bound on the convergence rate :    [ thm : coroll ] when @xmath145 , with probability greater than @xmath141 , the number of iterations for algorithm  [ alg : gcfl ] to find a satisfying assignment is less than @xmath146    see appendix .",
    "that is , our upper bound on convergence rate is improved from @xmath147 to @xmath148 with perfect sensing .",
    "this corresponds to the bound found in  @xcite for generic dcs problems , but it is looser than the refined bound found there for graph coloring problems .",
    "however , it is important to stress that this observation comes with the caveat that , as already noted , we believe both of these bounds are extremely loose .",
    "hence , we revisit this question below using numerical simulations , which yield tight measurements of convergence rate .",
    "the requirement in theorem  [ thm : bounds ] for the sensing graph @xmath90 to be strongly connected can be relaxed in a number of ways .",
    "if graph @xmath13 is not connected , we only have to ask for strong connectivity separately for the induced graph corresponding to each connected component .",
    "more generally , we can extend our analysis to situations where graph @xmath13 consists of a number of strongly connected components with sufficiently sparse interconnections between these components .     with two strongly connected components ( @xmath149 and @xmath150 ) which are sparsely interconnected .",

    "now , @xmath154 contains at least @xmath155 colors ( since we assume coloring of graph @xmath13 is feasible ) while subgraph @xmath150 is colorable using only two colors .",
