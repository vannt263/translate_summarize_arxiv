    "the term @xmath10 , responsible for the lorentz symmetry breaking , was obtained by dimensional reduction in ref .",
    "@xcite , considering the following model in ( 3 + 1 ) dimensions : @xmath11 where the greek letters @xmath12 .",
    "the dimensional reduction is obtained by applying the following prescription to the gauge 4-vector , @xmath13 , and to the fixed external 4-vector , @xmath14 : @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "thus the model in ( 2 + 1 ) dimensions is obtained : @xmath19 where the last term represents the gauge - fixing term , and that gives varying weight to the lorentz gauge condition .",
    "the @xmath20 field also works out as the coupling constant in the term that mixes the gauge field to the fixed 3-vector , @xmath21 .",
    "further , the scalar field , @xmath20 , exhibits a typical klein - gordon massless dynamics . as in quantum field theory",
    ", the aharonov - bohm effect is simulated by a nonrelativistic field theory describing bosonic particles interacting via a cs field , so for the model described by action ( [ acao ] ) , we consider a scalar field nonrelativistic , @xmath22 , interacting with the fields @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , the lagrangian ( [ lmred ] ) without the maxwell term",

    "now , for example , if @xmath80 and @xmath81 , or @xmath82 and @xmath83 , we have @xmath84 this correction vanishes in the limit @xmath85 so that no singularities are generated . a contribution occurring in second order in the breaking parameter of the lorentz symmetry to the cross section",
    "was also obtained in ref .",
    "this correction ( @xmath86 ) due to the effect of lorentz symmetry breaking may be relevant at high energies .",
    "in this paper , we find that the scattering amplitude in the tree approximation displays a small lorentz violation correction in first order in the parameter @xmath35 and contains an angular dependence .",
    "moreover , we have found that the a @xmath35-dependent amplitude , in the one - loop order , does not present ultraviolet divergences .",
    "also , we have shown that the correction to the amplitude in the one - loop order occurs only in the second order in the parameter @xmath35 . the ab amplitude with lorentz symmetry breaking in the limit",
    "@xmath87 agrees with the usual result  @xcite .",
    "in addition , we show for each case , timelike and spacelike @xmath88 , that the differential cross section at the small - angle limit is essentially due to the effect of the lorentz symmetry breaking .",
    "thus , in this limit the breaking of lorentz symmetry strongly contributes to the ab effect .",
    "however , our results allow an experimental verification of detecting lorentz - symmetry - breaking signals via the aharonov - bohm effect .",
