    "let @xmath0 . for @xmath1",
    "we define the corresponding ( finite ) tridiagonal matrix @xmath2 similarly we define the @xmath3-periodic tridiagonal operator @xmath4 for @xmath5 . in the following",
    "we will compare the spectra , denoted by @xmath6 , of the finite matrices with the spectra of the periodic operators as follows . in accordance with the notation in @xcite and @xcite",
    ", we define the sets @xmath7 and @xmath8 : @xmath9 these sets are of interest because they are closely related to the spectrum of the feinberg - zee random hopping matrix , denoted by @xmath10 , see e.g. @xcite-@xcite , @xcite , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "it was shown in @xcite that @xmath11 holds .",
    "note that these inclusions have to be proper because @xmath7 is a countable set , @xmath8 is an uncountable null set ( w.r.t .",
    "@xmath12-dimensional lebesgue measure ) and @xmath10 contains the closed unit disk ( see below ) .",
    "the authors of @xcite conjectured that @xmath7 is actually dense in @xmath10 .",
    "we make a step in this direction by proving that @xmath7 is at least dense in @xmath8 .",
    "moreover , it was shown in @xcite that @xmath8 is dense in the unit disk @xmath13 , i.e. @xmath14 .",
    "this result was improved to a larger set in @xcite .",
    "our new result here implies that @xmath7 is dense in this particular set as well . on the other hand , using the numerical range , one can show that @xmath10 is contained in the square with vertices @xmath15 ( @xcite , @xcite ) . in @xcite",
    "this upper bound was further improved using second order numerical ranges .",
    "furthermore , @xmath8 has an infinite number of symmetries that also carry over to @xmath7 ( see @xcite for rotations and reflections , @xcite for square roots and @xcite for higher roots ) . combining all these results mentioned above , we have a pretty accurate description of the set @xmath7 .",
    "however , many questions still remain open .",
    "for example the seemingly fractal boundary is yet unexplained ( cf .",
    "figure 1 , borrowed from @xcite ) . some comments on this particular issue can be found in @xcite .    0.4    0.4",
    "as mentioned in the introduction it was shown in @xcite that @xmath7 is a subset of @xmath8 .",
    "the following theorem confirms the conjecture by chandler - wilde , chonchaiya and lindner ( @xcite,@xcite ) that @xmath16 is even dense in @xmath17 .",
    "first observe that it is enough to consider pairs @xmath18 with @xmath19 since every @xmath20 is unitarily equivalent , via a diagonal so - called gauge transform ( @xcite ) , to some @xmath21 with @xmath22 and @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , every @xmath24 is unitarily equivalent to some @xmath25 with @xmath26 and @xmath23 .",
    "thus we omit the index @xmath27 from now on .    in the proof of theorem",
    "[ theorem ] we will use three auxiliary lemmas .",
    "the first one is well - known in the theory of block laurent operators .",
    "it generalizes the symbol calculus for laurent operators to periodic operators .",
    "just observe that an @xmath3-periodic operator can be interpreted as a block laurent operator with block size @xmath28 .",
    "using a block fourier transform it is then not hard to see that the operator @xmath29 is unitarily equivalent to the ( generalized ) multiplication operator @xmath30 defined by the matrix valued function @xmath31 the first lemma is then an easy consequence .",
    "for a proof and more material on this subject see e.g. ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 2.93 ) , ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.4.9 ) or ( * ? ? ? * chap .",
    "viii , theorem 5.1 ) .      in the case of tridiagonal periodic operators ,",
    "only the constant term of @xmath35 ( as a polynomial of @xmath36 ) depends on @xmath37 as the next lemma shows .",
    "this leads to the fact that the spectrum of every periodic operator @xmath38 can be written as @xmath39)$ ] for some polynomial @xmath40 ( cf .",
    "figure 2 ) .",
    "for an explicit formula of @xmath40 we refer to @xcite .      using the leibniz formula",
    "@xmath45 it is easily seen that the only surviving term containing @xmath46 but not @xmath47 is @xmath48 and similar for @xmath47 . thus the assertion follows .",
    "alternatively one could also apply laplace s formula twice to get the same result ( see @xcite for details ) .        with the help of the kronecker product @xmath55 ,",
    "we can write @xmath56 , where @xmath57 @xmath58 is unitarily equivalent to the diagonal matrix @xmath59 thus @xmath60 is unitarily equivalent to @xmath61 , which is exactly @xmath62 .",
    "( theorem ) + that @xmath63 holds was proven in ( * ? ? ? * theorem 4.1 ) .",
    "so let @xmath32 , @xmath33 and consider the operator @xmath38 .",
    "we can assume that the number of @xmath64 s in @xmath42 is even because we can always double the period without changing the operator .",
    "this implies that we have @xmath65 in lemma [ lemma2 ] . using lemma [ lemma1 ]",
    ", we get @xmath66)$ ] .",
    "this implies , in particular , that the set @xmath67 is dense in @xmath68 , cf .",
    "again figure 2 .",
    "let @xmath69 and @xmath52 for @xmath53 as above .",
    "we will show that for every @xmath69 there exists a finite matrix @xmath70 such that @xmath71 since @xmath72 holds , this implies @xmath73 because @xmath33 and @xmath32 were arbitrary , this implies that @xmath7 contains a dense subset of @xmath8 .",
    "hence the assertion follows .    in order to construct this matrix @xmath74",
    ", we arrange the matrices @xmath75 in a block diagonal matrix and use lemma [ lemma3 ] : @xmath76 where @xmath77 now note that by , @xmath75 and @xmath78 have the same spectrum for all @xmath79 .",
    "this implies that every eigenspace of @xmath80 corresponding to some @xmath81 is at least two - dimensional .",
    "so we can choose two linearly independent eigenvectors @xmath82 of @xmath80 corresponding to @xmath36 and a non - trivial linear combination @xmath83 , @xmath84 such that @xmath85 .",
    "of course , @xmath86 is still an eigenvector of @xmath80 corresponding to @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath87 .",
    "then we have @xmath88 this implies that @xmath36 is also an eigenvalue of @xmath74 , hence follows .",
    "our result heavily depends on the fact that all elements on the first sub- and superdiagonal have the same absolute value ( and on tridiagonality of course ) .",
    "these cases are usually called critical or degenerated .",
    "here degenerated refers to the fact that if all elements on the first sub- and superdiagonal have the same absolute value , the spectra of the periodic operators , which are loops in general , are degenerated to an arc . changing the alphabet in the first subdiagonal to @xmath89 , where @xmath90 , as considered in @xcite or @xcite for example , the conclusion fails .",
    "this was of course to be expected because a finite matrix @xmath91 is always similar ( diagonal gauge transform , see @xcite ) to a matrix @xmath92 this is no longer true for periodic operators . for tridiagonal operators on @xmath93",
    "we can only shift phases to the other side .",
    "this remaining freedom , however , can be used to prove theorem [ theorem ] for arbitrary alphabets as long as all elements share the same absolute value .",
    "this only needs a small modification of lemma [ lemma3 ] and a refinement of ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem 4.1 ) .",
