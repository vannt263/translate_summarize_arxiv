    "the axelrod model of cultural dissemination @xcite is an apparently simple model of cultural diffusion , in which `` culture '' is modeled as a discrete vector ( of length @xmath2 ) , a multivariate property possessed by an agent at each of the @xmath3 sites on a fully occupied finite square lattice .",
    "agents interact with their lattice neighbors , and the dynamics of the model are based on the two principles of homophily and social influence .",
    "the former means that agents prefer to interact with similar others , while the latter means that agents , when they interact , become more similar . despite this apparent simplicity ,",
    "in fact the model displays a rich dynamic behavior , and does not inevitably converge to a state in which all agents have the same culture .",
    "rather it will converge either to a monocultural state , or a multicultural state , depending on the model parameters .",
    "the axelrod model has come to be of great interest in statistical physics , with a number of variations and analyses conducted .",
    "a review from a statistical physics perspective can be found in @xcite , and more recent reviews from different perspectives in @xcite .",
    "one of the best - known features of the axelrod model is the nonequilibrium phase transition between the monocultural ( ordered ) and multicultural ( disordered ) states , controlled by the value of @xmath1 , the number of traits ( possible values of each vector element ) @xcite .",
    "a number of variations and extensions of the model have been proposed , including an external field ( modeling a `` mass media '' effect ) , noise , and interaction via complex networks rather than a lattice .",
    "external influence on culture vectors , in the form of a `` generalized other '' was first introduced by @xcite .",
    "further work on external influence on culture vectors , or mass media effect , considers an external field which acts to cause features to become more similar to the external culture vector with a certain probability @xcite , or variations such as nonuniform or local fields @xcite or fields with adaptive features @xcite .",
    "counterintuitively , these mass media effects were found to actually increase cultural diversity rather than result in further homogenization , an effect explained by local homogenizing interactions causing the absorbing state to be less fragmented than when interacting with the external field only , the latter case actually resulting in more , rather than less , diversity @xcite .",
    "the effect of noise , or `` cultural drift '' , foreshadowed by @xcite , in the form of random perturbations of cultural features , has been examined @xcite .",
    "a sufficiently small level of noise actually promotes monoculture , while too high a level of noise prevents stable cultural regions from forming ( an `` anomic '' state , as described by @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , there is another phase transition induced by the noise rate @xcite .",
    "another form of noise , in the form of random error in determining cultural similarity between agents , has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "noise is also incorporated in various other extensions of the axelrod model @xcite .    rather than interacting with the neighbors on a lattice ,",
    "neighborhoods defined by complex networks have also been investigated , including both static @xcite and coevolving networks @xcite .",
    "the use of complex networks rather than a lattice results in the phase transition controlled by the value of @xmath1 still existing , albeit possibly with a different critical value .",
    "the effect of network topology on the phase transition driven by noise has also been investigated @xcite .",
    "another extension of the axelrod model is the incorporation of multilateral influence , that is , interaction between more than two agents @xcite .",
    "multilateral influence allows diversity to be sustained in the presence of noise , when with dyadic influence it would collapse to monoculture or anomie @xcite  that is , it removes the phase transition controlled by the noise rate described by @xcite .",
    "although most investigations of the axelrod model and its extensions have been purely through computational experiments , a number of papers have used either mean - field analysis , or proved rigorous results mathematically . the original description of the phase transition controlled by @xmath1 used mean - field analysis @xcite , as have some other papers @xcite .",
    "a rigorous mathematical analysis is much more challenging , and has so far mostly been restricted to the one - dimensional case @xcite , with the exception of @xcite , who proves results for the usual two - dimensional model . the critical behavior of the order parameter has also been investigated quantitatively for the case of @xmath4 on the square lattice and small - world networks @xcite .",
    "computational experiments have also been used to investigate the relationship between the lattice area and the number of cultures @xcite and thermodynamic quantities such as temperature , energy , and entropy @xcite . for the one - dimensional case ,",
    "@xcite propose a thermodynamic version of the axelrod model and demonstrate its equivalence to a coupled potts model , as well as analyzing its behavior with respect to noise and an external field .",
    "an axelrod - like model with @xmath4 on a two - dimensional lattice is analyzed in the asymptotic case of @xmath5 by @xcite .",
    "other extensions and variations of the axelrod model include bounded confidence and metric features @xcite , agent migration @xcite , extended conservativeness ( a preference for the last source of cultural information ) @xcite , surface tension @xcite , cultural repulsion @xcite , the presence of some agents with constant culture vectors @xcite , having one or more features constant on some @xcite or all @xcite agents , using empirical @xcite or simulated @xcite rather than uniform random initial culture vectors , comparing mass media model predictions to empirical data on a mass media campaign @xcite , coupling two axelrod models through global fields @xcite , combining the axelrod model with a spatial public goods game @xcite , modeling diffusion of innovations by adding a new trait on a feature @xcite , and even using it as a heuristic for an optimization problem @xcite .",
    "in addition to the earliest phase diagrams showing just @xmath1 and the order parameter @xcite or the noise rate @xmath6 and the order parameter @xcite , the following phase diagrams , derived from either simulation experiments , or mean - field analysis ( or both ) , have been drawn for the axelrod model and various extensions ( notation may be changed from the original papers for consistency ) : @xmath1  @xmath7 where @xmath7 is external field strength @xcite ; @xmath6  @xmath8 and @xmath7  @xmath8 where @xmath6 is noise rate , and @xmath8 is a parameter controlling the network clustering structure @xcite ; @xmath1  @xmath9 where @xmath9 is the degree of overlap between the layers of a multilayer network @xcite ; @xmath10  @xmath1 where @xmath10 is the `` bounded confidence '' threshold ( minimum cultural similarity required for interaction ) @xcite ; @xmath2 ",
    "@xmath1 for the one - dimensional case @xcite ; @xmath11  @xmath1 where @xmath11 is the fraction of `` persistent agents '' or `` opinion leaders '' ( those with a constant culture vector ) @xcite .",
    "@xcite show a @xmath12  @xmath1 phase diagram where @xmath12 is the rewiring probability on small - world network , and also plot the relationship between the order parameter ( largest region size ) and @xmath13 where @xmath14 is maximum node degree in a structured scale - free network . in the small - world network ,",
    "the phase transition still exists and is shifted by the degree of disorder of the network . in random scale - free networks , the transition disappears in the thermodynamic limit , but in structured scale - free networks the phase transition still exists .",
    "@xcite examine the nature of the phase transition in the one- and two - dimensional cases , while @xcite investigates in addition three- and four - dimensional systems as well as triangular and hexagonal lattices .    despite these extensive investigations into various aspects of the axelrod model and its variants ,",
    "there has been a surprising lack of systematic investigation of the effect of increasing the neighborhood size , or `` range of interaction '' @xcite on a simple axelrod model with dyadic interaction on a square lattice .",
    "this is despite axelrod himself discussing the issue briefly @xcite and conducting experiments with neighborhoods of size 8 and 12 , finding that these result in fewer stable regions than the original von neumann neighborhood ( size 4 ) .",
    "@xcite , in their model with multilateral influence , use a larger von neumann neighborhood size , justifying it as empirically more plausible and a more conservative test of the preservation of cultural diversity @xcite .",
    "their extended model makes use of the larger neighborhood as its multilateral social influence uses more than two agents in an interaction , however all their experiments , including those reproducing the dyadic ( interpersonal ) influence model with noise of @xcite , fix the radius at @xmath15 , a precedent followed in a subsequent paper @xcite , while another model using a larger neighborhood for multilateral interactions fixes the radius at @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "@xcite investigate , for the special case @xmath4 , the axelrod model on a regular random graph using a mean - field analysis , giving an analytic explanation for the non - monotonic time dependence of the number of active links . increasing the coordination number",
    "may be considered to be similar to increasing the neighborhood size on a lattice with fixed coordination number  in both cases all agents have the same number of `` neighbors '' ( aside from edge effects in the case of finite lattices ) , which increases monotonically with the coordination number or von neumann radius respectively .",
    "@xcite find that larger coordination numbers give better agreement between their master equation and axelrod model simulations , but do not describe a phase transition controlled by the coordination number .    here",
    "we investigate the effect of varying the radius of the von neumann neighborhood in which agents can interact , and find another phase transition in the axelrod model at a critical value of the radius @xmath0 , as well as the well - known phase transition at a critical value of @xmath1 @xcite , and draw a @xmath1  @xmath0 phase diagram for the axelrod model on a square lattice .",
    "each of the @xmath3 agents on the fully occupied @xmath17 lattice ( @xmath18 ) has an @xmath2-dimensional culture vector ( @xmath19 ) @xmath20 for all @xmath21 .",
    "each entry of the cultural vector represents a feature and takes a single value from @xmath22 to @xmath1 , so , more precisely , @xmath23 for all @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "each of the @xmath2 elements is referred to as a `` feature '' , and @xmath1 is known as the number of `` traits '' .",
    "the cultural similarity of two agents is the number of features they have in common .",
    "if element @xmath26 of the culture vector belonging to agent @xmath27 is @xmath28 , then the cultural similarity @xmath29 of two agents @xmath27 and @xmath30 is a normalized hamming similarity @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the kronecker delta function .",
    "an agent can interact with its neighbors , traditionally ( as was originally used by @xcite , for example ) , defined as the von neumann neighborhood , that is , the four ( north , south , east , west ) surrounding cells on the lattice , so the number of potentially interacting agents is the lattice coordination number @xmath33 . here",
    "we extend this to larger von neumann neighborhoods by increasing the radius @xmath0 , that is , extending the neighborhood to all cells within a given manhattan distance , as was done by @xcite .",
    "this is illustrated in figure  [ fig : neighborhoods ] .",
    "hence the number of potentially interacting agents ( the focal agent and all its neighbors ) in the von neumann neighborhood with radius @xmath0 is now @xmath34 @xcite at most ( we do not use periodic boundary conditions ) .",

    "the dynamics of the model are as follows .",
    "a focal agent @xmath37 is chosen at random , and another agent @xmath38 from the radius @xmath0 von neumann neighborhood is also chosen at random .",
    "with probability proportional to their cultural similarity ( the number of features on which they have identical traits ) , the two agents @xmath37 and @xmath38 interact .",
    "this interaction results in a randomly chosen feature on @xmath37 whose value is different from that on @xmath38 being changed to @xmath38 s value .",
    "this process is repeated until an absorbing , or frozen , state is reached . in this state , no more change is possible , because all agents neighbors have either identical or completely distinct ( no features in common , so no interaction can occur ) culture vectors .    in the absorbing state ,",
    "the agents form cultural regions , or clusters . within the cluster ,",
    "all agents have identical culture vectors .",
    "then the average size of the largest cluster , @xmath39 is used as the order parameter @xcite , separating the ordered and disordered phases . in a monocultural ( ordered )",
    "state , @xmath40 , a single cultural region covers almost the entire lattice ; in a multicultural ( disordered ) state , multiple cultural regions exist .",
    "other order parameters that have been used include the number of cultural domains @xcite , mean density of cultural domains",

    "figure  [ fig : q ] shows the order parameter ( largest region size ) plotted against @xmath1 for @xmath41 , on three different lattice sizes .",
    "it is apparent that , as the size of the von neumann neighborhood is increased , the critical value of @xmath1 also increases .",
    "that is , by allowing a larger range of interactions , a larger scope of cultural possibilities is required in order for a multicultural absorbing state to exist .",
    "increasing the lattice size has a similar effect , although , as we shall show in section  [ sec : meanfield ] , there is still a finite critical value of @xmath1 in the limit of an infinite lattice .",

    "( apart from the smallest value of @xmath1 , in which a monocultural state always prevails ) , there is a phase transition visible between a multicultural state ( for @xmath0 less than a critical value ) and a monocultural state .",
    "note that when @xmath0 is sufficiently large relative to the lattice size @xmath42 , every agent has every other agent in its von neumann neighborhood , and hence the situation is equivalent to a complete graph or a well - mixed population ( or `` soup '' @xcite ) .",

    "[ fig : radius ] shows that there appears to be a phase transition controlled by @xmath0 , between the multicultural phase and the monocultural phase . as the size of the neighborhood increases , so does the probability of an agent finding another agent with at least one feature in common with which to interact , and hence local convergence can happen in larger neighborhoods , resulting in larger cultural regions .",
    "however this does not result , at the absorbing state ( for a fixed value of @xmath1 ) , in a gradual increase in maximum cultural region size from a completely fragmented state to a monocultural state .",

    "the original axelrod model had agents only interact with their immediate neighbors on a lattice , modeling the assumption of that geographic proximity largely determines the possibility of interaction .",
    "subsequent work has extended this to neighbors on complex networks , or allowed agent migration , or assumed a well - mixed population ( infinite - ranged social interactions ) on the assumption that online interactions are making this assumption more realistic @xcite .    despite these , and other , increasingly sophisticated modifications of the axelrod model , however , an examination of the consequences of simply extending the lattice ( von neumann ) neighborhood had not been carried out .",
    "we have done so , and shown another phase transition in the model , controlled by the von neumann radius @xmath0 , as well as the well - known phase transition at the critical value of @xmath1 , and drawn a @xmath1  @xmath0 phase diagram .",
    "we have also used a mean - field analysis to analyze the behavior on an infinite lattice .",
    "these results show that , as well as the value of @xmath1 , the `` scope of cultural possibilities '' @xcite , having a critical value above which a multicultural state prevails , there is also a critical value of the radius of interaction , above which a monocultural state prevails .",
    "this simply says that , rather unsurprisingly , a world in which people can only interact with their immediate neighbors is ( for a fixed value of @xmath1 ) , more likely to remain multicultural than one in which people can interact with those further away .",
    "given this inevitability of a monocultural state for large enough `` neighborhoods '' , it might be more useful to consider alternative measurements of cultural diversity , such as the `` long term cultural diversity '' measured using the curve plotting the number of final cultural domains against the initial number of connected cultural components , as the bounded confidence threshold is varied , as described by @xcite ( where a well - mixed population was assumed , and hence a monocultural state results for when the bounded confidence threshold is zero ) .",
