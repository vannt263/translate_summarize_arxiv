    "consider the following situation .",
    "alice writes a message to bob consisting of the numbers of several bank accounts to which bob has to send some money .",
    "she writes in a hurry ( she just got to know that the transfers are urgent if they do not want to pay delay punishment , but currently she has little time ) .",
    "therefore her characters are not very well legible , so bob may misread some numbers .",
    "however , there are some rules for the possible mistakes , e.g. , a @xmath0 may be thought to be a @xmath1 but never a @xmath2 .",
    "this relation between the possible digits need not be symmetric : it is possible that a @xmath3 is sometimes read as a @xmath2 but a @xmath2 may not be decoded as a @xmath3",
    ". these rules of possible confusions are known both by alice and by bob .    as",
    "alice is aware of the possibility that bob misread her message , later in the day she sends another message to bob , the goal of which is to make bob certain whether he read ( decoded ) the first message correctly or not . if he did he can transfer the money with complete confidence that he sends it to the right accounts .",
    "if he did not he will know that he does not know the account numbers correctly and so he better wait and pay the punishment than transfer the money to the wrong place .",
    "the second message will be received by bob correctly for certain , but it uses an expensive device , e.g. , alice sends it as an sms from another country after she has arrived there .",
    "( now we understand why she was in a hurry : she had to arrive to the airport in time . ) for some reason , every character sent from this foreign country costs a significant amount of money for her .",
    "so she wants to send the shortest possible message that makes it sure ( here we insist on zero - error ) that bob will know whether his decoding of the original handwritten message was error - free or not .",
    "the problem is to determine the best rate of communication over the second channel as the length of the original message received tends to infinity .    in section  [ sec : dil ]",
    "we describe the abstract communication model for this scenario and show that the best achievable rate is a parameter of an appropriate directed graph .",
    "we will see that this parameter of a directed graph is a generalization of the parameter ( of an undirected graph ) called witsenhausen rate .",
    "( this means that we also obtain a new interpretation of witsenhausen rate . )    in section  [ sec : bounds ] we investigate the relationship with other graph parameters .",
    "these include sperner capacity and the dichromatic number .",
    "the former is a generalization of shannon s graph capacity @xcite to directed graphs .",
    "though originally defined to give a general framework for some problems in extremal set theory ( see @xcite ) , sperner capacity also has its own information theoretic relevance , see @xcite .",
    "the dichromatic number is a generalization of the chromatic number to directed graphs introduced in @xcite . using the above mentioned relations we determine our new parameter for some specific directed graphs .",
    "in section  [ sec : comp ] we consider a compound channel type version of the problem parallel to @xcite .    in section [ sec : extr ]",
    "some connections to extremal set theory are pointed out .    in section [ sec :",
    "ambit ] we will consider the setup where the requirement is more ambitious and we want that alice s second ( the error - free but expensive ) message make bob able to decode the original message with zero - error . (",
    "that is , he will know the message itself not only the correctness or incorrectness of his original decoding of alice s handwriting . )",
    "we will see that this setting leads to the witsenhausen rate of an undirected graph related to the problem .",

    "all logarithms are meant to be of base @xmath4 .",
    "the abstract setting for our communication scenario is the following .",
    "we have a source whose output is sent through a noisy channel .",
    "( this belongs to alice s handwriting . )",
    "the input and output alphabets of this channel are identical and they coincide with the output alphabet of the source . it is known how the noisy channel can deform the input , in particular we know what ( input ) letters can become a certain , possibly different ( output ) letter on the other side .",
    "( we always assume though that every letter can result in itself , that is get through the noisy channel without alteration . )",
    "later another message is sent ( by the same sender ) to the same receiver .",
    "this second message is sent via a noiseless channel and its goal is to make zero - undetected - error decoding possible , i.e. , after having received this second message the receiver should be able to decide whether it decoded the first message correctly .",
    "the use of the noiseless channel is expensive , so the second message should be kept as short as possible .",
    "let the shortest possible message that satisfies the criteria have length @xmath5 when @xmath6 characters of the source output are encoded together .",
    "let @xmath7 denote the noisy channel .",
    "the efficiency of the communication is measured by the quantity @xmath8 that we call the dilworth rate of the noisy channel @xmath7 .",
    "( for an explanation of the name see remark  [ rem : name ] in subsection  [ subsect : dilwdef ] . )    [ rem : cvsr ] note the special feature of the problem that we characterize a channel by a rate , that is with a parameter that , unlike channel capacity , we want to be as small as possible .",
    "the reason is that we measure the reliability of a channel not by the amount of information it can safely transfer but with the amount of information needed _ to be added _ for making the communication reliable .",

    "the @xmath6-th and power of a digraph @xmath24 , denoted by @xmath33 is the @xmath6-wise and product of digraph @xmath24 with itself .",
    "observe that this graph exponentiation extends to sequences of letters the relation between individual letters @xmath34 and @xmath35 expressing that feeding @xmath34 to the noisy channel @xmath7 may result in observing letter @xmath35 at the output .",
    "a sequence of letters at the input of @xmath7 can result in another such sequence at the output of @xmath7 if at each coordinate the character in the first sequence can result in the corresponding character of the second sequence .",

    "alice can send bob the color of the vertex belonging to the original source output using @xmath42 bits .",
    "bob compares this to the color of the vertex representing the sequence he obtained as a result of his decoding .",
    "if the latter color is identical to the one alice has sent him , then he can be sure that his decoding was error - free .",
    "this is because any other sequence that could result in his decoded sequence is adjacent ( in @xmath43 ) to this decoded sequence , so its color is different .    on the other hand , if alice sent a shorter message through the noiseless channel , then she could not have @xmath41 distinct messages and thus there must exist two adjacent vertices in @xmath43 that are encoded to the same codeword by alice ( for the noiseless channel ) .",
    "then one of the two sequences represented by these two adjacent vertices could result in the other one , while this other one could also result in itself .",
    "thus bob can not make the difference between these two sequences , one of which is the correct source output sequence while the other one differs from it .",
