    "in recent years , benefited from the development of location tracking technologies , the studies on the statistics of human daily mobility rise to be a new research hot point .",
    "researchers have analyzed varieties of data sets reflecting human mobility ( e.g. dollar - bill tracking , mobile phone roaming , global positioning system , recording of taxi and bus passengers , et al ) .",
    "these empirical studies show two major quantitative features of human mobility patterns : i ) .",
    "the scaling anomalies in several statistics , which mainly includes the aggregated jump - size ( or say move - length or displacement ) of each travel @xcite , waiting time @xcite , visitation frequency of each distinct locations @xcite , and the growth of the number of visited locations @xcite .",
    "ultraslow diffusion property , which is observed in the slowly growth of the mean square displacement ( msd ) and radius of gyration @xcite . beyond that , several other anomalies , such as high regularity and predictability @xcite and the limitation of traffic system @xcite , have also been observed in human mobility .",
    "these features are not only against the traditional view of human mobility based on random walks but also sharply different with the purely lvy - flight nature .",
    "consequently , researchers have to review the discussions on many social and economic dynamics that are deeply affected by human mobility , such as the spreading of pathogens and information @xcite , the planning of city and traffic systems @xcite , and so on .",
    "moreover , with the progress on this issue , even some recently formed consensus are also argued by the new findings .",
    "for instance , the aggregated distribution of long - range move - length shows widely scaling properties , however , this conclusion can not be extend to be the universal law of human mobility @xcite , because human individuals movements show high diversity @xcite and the pattern of urban trips usually appear to be exponential - like @xcite .",
    "a key issue is to understand the origin of these properties .",
    "recent studies have proposed several approaches and dynamical models to describe it .",
    "the simplest type is the descriptive model , including the continuous - time random - walk ( ctrw ) , which can generate power - law - like displacement distribution and show slow diffusion @xcite , and the self - similar least action walk ( slaw ) @xcite . in the explanation of the scaling anomalies",
    ", many possible origins have been proposed .",
    "the first type is the aggregated effect on population to mimic the macroscopic features of human mobility . such as the radiation model that can reproduce much realistic inter - city mobility patterns @xcite , and the model based on maximum entropy theory under maxwell - boltzmann statistics which aggregate the scaling law from diverse individual movements @xcite . in the second type , the spatial heterogeneity of population density and urban environment , was discussed as a factor that contributes to the emergences of human mobility patterns @xcite . beyond these qualities , recently , the hierarchical nature in human mobility is empirically observed @xcite and is considered as one of the origin of the scaling move - length @xcite . for the ultraslow diffusion , the model reported in ref .",
    "@xcite indicates that it seem to be the result of the high - frequency trips between homes and working locations .",
    "recently , the model proposed by song et al @xcite attract much attention .",
    "it considers two generic mechanisms : the exploration of new locations and the preferential return of visited locations . in the combination of some priori results obtained in empirical analysis",
    ", this model provide several statistical patterns agreeing with the empirical data , indicating that the two mechanisms play fateful role in human mobility .",
    "unfortunately , due to the dependence on the priori empirical results , this model does not give a sufficient explanation on the characteristic key of human mobility patterns : the scaling law on jump - size .",
    "overall , a model that catches the key in human mobility and reproduces most of empirical observations is still lacking .    in the present paper , based on the cascading process and combination of the localized exploration and the preferential returns",
    ", we propose an agent - based model to explain the underlying mechanisms in human daily travels .",
    "we surprisingly find that , this minimum model can quantitatively well fit almost all the empirical findings and cover most of the results of previous modeling studies , implying the cascade - like process is indeed important in the understanding of human mobility patterns .",
    "+     +    one noticeable feature of our daily long - range trips and travels is that , we usually prefer to take some short - range movements around the aiming locations rather than return homes directly .",
    "for example , when we travel from our hometown to another city , generally speaking , we need to find a hotel , then we will take some activities for the travel ( e.g. , working , meeting , or tours ) at the locations nearby the city , and at last we return to hometown after all objectives are completed . each things that we do in the travel",
    "will create one or more short - range movements in the field of the city , that is to say , the long - range travel from our hometown to the city activates series shorter movements in the aiming city .",
    "similarly , such activation also can be observed in many middle - range or short - range movements , for instance , the commuter s trips vs. the movements in workplaces , and the trips from home to marketplace vs. the strolls during shopping .",
    "associating with the activation by long - range movements , an explicit feature of human mobility emerges : series activating processes act most of transitions from relatively longer travels to shorter trips , and each of them can initiate series shorter trips around the end location of the longer travel .",
    "these serial initiations of movements can be called  cascading walks process \" .",
    "this cascading walking process in human mobility have been observed by the recent empirical study based on the database of gps carriers @xcite , in which the evidences of cascading walks process that the positive correlation between the displacements of two consecutive movements , positively relates to the scaling property of human mobility patterns , implying the cascading walks process might play an important role in the emergence of human scaling mobility patterns . also , previous studies in the temporal patterns of human activities indicated a similar cascading - like process would be relevant to the emergence of burst @xcite , as well as the long - term correlations ( can be created by the cascading processes ) @xcite .",
    "overall , combining all the daily experiences and empirical studies above , the cascading walks process is regarded as the basic mechanism of our modeling work that will be elucidated later .",
    "initiations of series of shorter movements after a longer travel is the basic dynamics of cascading walks process , and thereby in the present model , the longer travel and initiated shorter movements can be distinguished into two layers : the longer travel is in a higher layer , and the shorter movements are in the lower one , and the corresponding end locations also can be set into different layers .",

    "[ model ] .",
    "the two ( @xmath1)-th layer locations b and e are randomly chosen in the field of a. the movements ii and vi respectively initiate several ( @xmath3)-th layer short trips in the field of b and e ( the two gray dashed circles , and they are called the sub - field of a ) , for instance , the movements iii , iv and v in the field of b. these ( @xmath3)-th layer trips also could be initiate ( @xmath4)-th layer trips ( it s not shown in fig .

    "a part of the field of b / e outside the field of a is allowed .",
    "the staying time is correlated to the distance . for the location b , say , the total time of all these lower - layer short movements which are directly or indirectly initiated by the movement ii is @xmath10 , namely @xmath10 is the time length from the movement iii to v , or say , the staying time of b. we assume the staying time @xmath10 are positively correlated to the distance from the up - layer location a to location b , @xmath11 which means @xmath10 is a random number obeys a poisson distribution @xmath12 with average value @xmath13 , as well as @xmath14 for the location e , and similarly for others , for instance , @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is another main parameter of the model , denoting how the staying time correlates to the distance to the up - layer location . in the simulations , when the staying time will be exhausted , we set the walker must return to the center location of the current field to prepare the departure to other field , for instance , when @xmath17 , the walker moving in the field of b must return to b , no matter whether the staying time of the current field is exhausted or not .",

    "the analysis in _ appendix b _ indicates that @xmath41 in a extreme case without the cascading effect is @xmath44 , implying that these larger values of @xmath41 possibly originate from the cascading effect .    the growth of the number of visited locations @xmath45 is generally expected to the scaling form @xmath46 .",
    "@xmath47 stands for the pure levy flights , and its value depends on the exponent of the staying time distribution , where staying time is the time that a walker spend at one location in crtw @xcite .",
    "empirical studies have indicated that , in the real - world @xmath45 obeys scaling law with an exponent @xmath48 , which is smaller than the prediction in crtw @xcite , indicating an ultraslow growth of the number of visited locations and a growing returning probability to the visited locations .",
    "the growth of @xmath45 in the present model also obeys the power - law function with an exponent @xmath49 .",
    "the visitation frequency is of the similar situation , the exponent is mainly affected by the value of @xmath8 , where smaller @xmath8 corresponds to a slower growth of @xmath45 ( small @xmath50 ) , indicating the walker are more possible to return to the visited locations . an extreme situation without the cascading effect shows a logarithmical - growing @xmath45 ( _ appendix b _ ) , that is the reason that @xmath45 of large @xmath8 generates logarithmic sections ( fig . [ visit](d ) ) .",

    "empirical studies noted that the growth of human @xmath55 is close to the logarithmic form rather than the power function of crtw and levy flight , indicating an ultraslow spread in human long - range travels @xcite .",
    "this abnormal property is also reproduced by the present model . as shown in fig .",
    "[ rgmsd](c ) , @xmath55 shows a partly logarithmic - like growth when @xmath56 , which generally is close to the empirical findings on the mobility of mobile users @xcite .",
    "the msd @xmath57 at time @xmath29 is defined as : @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the coordinates of initial position and @xmath60 means the average of all the time range .",
    "previous studies indicated that , @xmath61 for brownian random walks and @xmath62 for pure lvy flight , and the msd of real - world human mobility is generally slower than the prediction of lvy flight @xcite .",
    "the curves of msd created for different parameter settings are shown in fig .",
    "[ rgmsd](d - f ) .",
    "the fitting exponents are between in 0.9 and 1.0 , which is generally close to the empirical findings based on gps carriers @xcite . for the cases @xmath56 , due to the fitting exponent @xmath31 of the displacement distribution @xmath35 is less than 1.0 , the growth of msd in our model is slower than the prediction of pure lvy flight and more similar to the empirical findings .",
    "these results indicate that the ultraslow diffusions mainly emerge in a condition when @xmath56 .",
    "in this situation , the time that the walker moves in the field of lower layer location is relatively short , and the walker therefore has more frequent returns to the upper layer locations and consequently results in the ultraslow diffusions .",
    "the basic assumption of the model is the cascading process on both the spatial and temporal correlations , which is in supporting of several recent empirical observations @xcite . for another assumption : the localized preferential returns and explorations , compared with song et al s model @xcite , its expression is linear , and its effect",
    "is localized .",
    "besides these two assumptions , this model do not introduce any other spatio - temporal heterogeneities , implying the environments heterogeneity ( e.g. population density , urban environments , et al ) @xcite does not play the fateful role in the emergence of the scaling properties in long - range human mobility .",
    "this minimum model surprisingly reproduce many statistics achieving of the empirical data , including the scaling anomalies in move - length , inter - visit time and visitation frequency , the slow growth of the number of visited locations , radius of gyration and msd , thus it covers most of empirical findings . for the scaling displacements that is the most noticeable feature in real - world human mobility ,",
    "the present model successfully creates it without any prior scaling properties .",
    "the analytical result of this model indicates that the cascade - like process is the key in the emergence of scaling move - lengths .",
    "moreover , the present model provides an unified explanation for the differences on empirical findings in different levels and bridges several controversial issues .",
    "first , it shows both the aggregated scaling law and diversity of individual mobility , in agreement with the recent empirical findings crossing the macroscopic and microcosmic domains @xcite , indicating a possible mode in the emergence of the aggregated scaling properties of large number of non - scaling individuals .",
    "secondly , the result that the mobility in single layer do not show the scaling jump - length , is similar to the real - world situations with single type of vehicle ( e.g. bus , taxi , et al ) @xcite , successfully explaining both the scaling anomalies on move - length in global level and the homogeneous properties in urban mobility and single - vehicle trips @xcite .",
    "in addition , the scaling visitation frequency in the model implies the existence of dominant trips , in agreement with peoples daily experiences and empirical findings @xcite . in summary",
    ", the present model shows that , only based on the two basic mechanisms , the cascading walks process and the localized preferential returns and explorations , are enough to explain most of the statistics for human mobility in different levels .",
    "this conclusion would be very helpful in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms driving human mobility patterns and valuables in the prediction of human daily trips @xcite and further applications .",

    "<S> uncovering the mechanism behind the scaling law in human trajectories is of fundamental significance in understanding many spatio - temporal phenomena . in combination of the exploration and the preferential returns , we propose a simple dynamical model mainly based on the cascading processes to capture the human mobility patterns . by the numerical simulations and analytical studies , we show more than five statistical characters that are well consistent with the empirical observations , including several type of scaling anomalies , and the ultraslow diffusion property , implying the cascading processes associated with the other two mechanisms are indeed a key in the understanding of human mobility activities . moreover , both of the diverse individual mobility and aggregated scaling move - lengths , bridging the micro and macro patterns in human mobility . </S>",
    "<S> our model provides deeper understandings on the emergence of human mobility patterns . </S>"
