    "the detailed nature of agn feedback and its relationship to the phenomenology of the core plasma in clusters remain subjects of active investigation .",
    "x - ray observations show that the massive cluster population can be divided into cool - core ( cc ) and non - cool core ( ncc ) categories , with the distinction determined by the strength of a surface brightness cusp within the inner @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the physics that controls this cc / ncc dichotomy has remained under debate .",
    "major mergers may be capable of driving a cc to ncc transition through shock heating and/or ablation of core gas , but early cosmological gas dynamic simulations with cooling and supernova feedback found major mergers to be ineffective at heating the core gas @xcite unless the merger had sufficiently low angular momentum @xcite .",
    "the observational finding that morphologically disturbed clusters rarely host cool cores offers hoewever strong empirical evidence that mergers play a role in determining core morphology @xcite .    still , it remains possible that internal processes , such as agn jet - driven turbulent heating , may drive the transition from a cc to a ncc state , at least temporarily @xcite or may play an important role in pressurising the cores .",

    "reproducing the properties of the hot cluster plasma however has to go hand - in - hand with achieving also compatible results for the full galaxy population in and around clusters .",
    "while the field is still far from predictive simulations across the full multi - wavelength range covered by current and future observational studies of clusters , we are able to highlight several successes as well as important shortcomings of such state - of - the - art cluster simulations in a full cosmological context .    the structure of this article is as follows . in section  [ sec : sim ] , we introduce the sample of zoom simulations that we study as well as the numerical methods and models that we employ .",
    "we then compare the icm profiles of the simulated clusters with various x - ray observations in section  [ sec : icm_properties ] . in section  [ sec : origin_ncc ] , we investigate the origin of the cool - core / non - cool - core dichotomy that we find in our sample .",

    "we also discuss the details of our numerical and algorithmic approaches , in particular the sub - grid models we have employed to account for sub - resolution physics due to cooling and energy injection by stars and massive black holes .",

    "nine are chosen to have a similar final mass of @xmath9 and the tenth has @xmath10 .",
    "the original rhapsody clusters were identified from one of the carmen simulations from the large suite of dark matter simulations ( lasdamas ) .",
    "the carmen simulation on which we base our re - simulations is a cosmological volume of @xmath11 .",

    "all initial conditions ( both for the original box and all subsequent zooms ) were performed using second - order lagrangian perturbation theory at @xmath23 .    in this paper , we re - generate the respective initial conditions using music for ten clusters ( see section  [ sec : rgsubset ] below for details on the selection and properties of these haloes ) but now including baryon perturbations .",

    "in addition , we use also lagrangian perturbation theory for the baryons using the local lagrangian approximation ( see * ? ? ? * for details on baryon ics for grid and particle codes ) .      from the sample of @xmath24100 clusters in the @xmath25 mass bin of the original rhapsody sample @xcite , we selected a subset of 10 clusters which we investigate using multi - physics simulations in this paper .",
    "to sample both extreme cases of formation history and more average clusters , we considered the two - dimensional ordering shown in figure  2 of @xcite , where clusters are ranked first by halo concentration @xmath26 , and then at similar concentration ranked a second time by the numbers of subhaloes @xmath27 above @xmath28 .",
    "the extreme corners of this space are occupied by the systems with ids 337 , 377 , 572 and 653 .",
    "we additionally included system 545 which has similar properties to 337 ( high concentration , high substructure fraction ) .",
    "we note that this naturally includes the fossil system 572 which was discussed in more detail already in @xcite as being a particularly early forming system and occupying the tail in many halo properties .",
    "we complement this subset of `` extreme '' clusters with four more clusters taken from the central region of the @xmath26-@xmath27 space .",
    "these are the ones with ids 211 , 348 , 361 , 448 .",

    "these clusters , along with various properties discussed in section  [ sec : global_properties ] are listed in table  [ tab : rhapsody_g_sample ] .      in order to follow the non - linear multi - physics evolution of our initial conditions , we use here the eulerian adaptive mesh refinement code ramses @xcite and include radiative cooling , as well as sub - grid models for star formation and agn feedback which we discuss below .",
    "ramses is based on a muscl scheme with an approximate riemann solver and gravity is solved using the multi - grid method directly on the amr hierarchy .",
    "dark matter as well as stellar and sink particles are evolved using standard @xmath7-body techniques .",
    "we employ an overdensity - based ( i.e. `` lagrangian '' ) refinement strategy that splits cells if they reach an overdensity of eight , i.e. refinement of the base grid by @xmath29 additional levels requires a density of @xmath30 .",
    "the maximum refinement level for the 4k runs ( which constitute the main part of our analysis here ) is determined by maintaining a smallest cell size of physical @xmath31 .",
    "the 4k dark matter @xmath7-body particle mass is @xmath32 , and the initial mass per hydro cell is @xmath33 respectively .",
    "the 8k run of rg  653 , which we consider here for convergence purposes , has twice the mass and force resolution , i.e. @xmath34 , and an eight times smaller @xmath7-body particle mass than the 4k runs .",
    "the high - resolution lagrangian patch from which the @xmath20 sphere centred on each cluster will form is tagged using a passive scalar colour field that is advected with the gas .",
    "dynamic refinement is restricted to the regions where this colour field is non - zero .",
    "we thus focus all computational resources on the forming cluster and its immediate environment .",
    "the simulations include optically thin radiative cooling using the cooling rates of @xcite for h , he and metal line cooling .",
    "different metals are not evolved separately , but the total gas metallicity is advected with the hydrodynamical equations as a passive scalar and is sourced by the supernova feedback model .",
    "a uv background is included assuming the parameterisation of @xcite and an instantaneous reionisation at @xmath35 taking into account an earlier reionisation in the particularly overdense proto - cluster environment .",
    "the unresolved cold and dense gas that will constitute the interstellar medium ( ism ) of galaxies is approximated using a polytropic temperature floor @xmath36 where @xmath37 @xmath38 is the threshold for star formation ( see below ) , @xmath39 k is a characteristic temperature mimicking thermal and turbulent motions in the ism , and @xmath40 is the effective polytropic exponent . in practice , gas can be heated above the temperature floor , but can not cool below it .",
    "we assume star formation to occur in a cell when the gas density exceeds @xmath41 . in this case",
    "a star particle is spawned carrying 20 per cent of the mean baryon mass of the cell .",
    "we set the local star formation rate per cell as @xmath42 with the free - fall time @xmath43 of the cell and a star formation efficiency per free - fall time @xmath44 .",
    "stellar particles are seeded locally from a poisson process .",
    "supernova feedback is implemented based on the model of @xcite , in which each newly formed star particle releases a fraction @xmath45 of its mass and metals with a yield of @xmath46 into its surrounding cells through supernovae ( sne ) after @xmath47 ( this implies that 1 per cent of the time integrated global star formation rate is returned as metals to the ism ) . in addition",
    ", each supernova injects an energy of @xmath48 into the surrounding ism which regulates the star formation efficiency at galaxy scale halo masses .",
    "the free parameters of the supernova feedback have been calibrated to reproduce stellar masses consistent with abundance matching results ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) at halo masses @xmath49 for haloes resolved with @xmath50 particles .",
    "the deep potential wells of galaxy clusters require a stronger heating source than supernova feedback to prevent a central cooling catastrophe .",
    "active galactic nuclei ( agns ) provide a natural source of energy in massive galaxies to offset these extreme cooling flows ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for reviews ) . in the simulations discussed in this paper ,",
    "we include a purely thermal agn feedback , based on the subgrid models of @xcite with the additional energy injection thresholding of @xcite , which is commonly employed in sph simulations ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* for recent examples ) .",
    "we give a brief summary of our agn feedback model below but refer the reader to paper 2 , martizzi et al .",
    "2015 , in prep . , for a more detailed exposition .",
    "sink particles , representing supermassive black holes , are created when contiguous regions of high density gas exceed @xmath51 ( identified on the fly by the clustering method of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) that ( 1 ) do not already contain a sink particle , ( 2 ) are gravitationally bound , and ( 3 ) have an accretion rate @xmath52 , where @xmath53 is the mass contained within a sphere of 4 computational cells .",
    "this guarantees that sink particles are spawned only in the most massive haloes at high redshift .",
    "the initial black hole mass is chosen proportional to the clump accretion rate times the salpeter time .",
    "sink particles then accrete at a boosted bondi - hoyle accretion rate ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) @xmath54 where @xmath55 is the fluid velocity , @xmath56 the sound speed , @xmath57 the free - fall limited bondi radius , and @xmath58 the density dependent boost factor .",
    "we additionally impose the eddington limit onto @xmath59 assuming that @xmath60 of the accreted rest mass energy is converted into radiation .",
    "numerically , the amount @xmath61 up to a maximum of half of the gas mass contained in each cell is removed from cells inside the sink radius . the thermal energy @xmath62",
    "would in principle be released into the gas in each time step , but following @xcite , we accumulate @xmath63 and inject the accumulated @xmath64 into the sink radius ( i.e. the sphere of radius 4 cells ) only once @xmath65 , where @xmath66 is the gas mass enclosed by the sink radius . the coupling efficiency @xmath67 has been calibrated to reproduce the @xmath68 relation @xcite . in our fiducial model , we set @xmath69 , but vary this by one order of magnitude up and down when we investigate the effect of trading fewer violent agn events against more frequent less violent agn events in section  [ sec : agn_impact ] .",
    "we emphasise however that the total energy injected by the agn obviously remains more or less the same .",
    "the parameter @xmath70 has been shown to allow a tuning of the bulk properties of the icm ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) in sph simulations .",
    "since the agn energy is thus injected close to the resolution limit into a region containing the densest cells of the simulation , we also consider a more phenomenological model , inspired by the agn model of @xcite , in which we distribute @xmath64 over a resolved sphere of a radius determined by the black hole mass .",
    "@xcite used a formula for the injection radius that depends on the halo mass .",
    "since we do not track halo masses on the fly with our algorithm and prefer a local criterion , we decided to express the injection radius used by @xcite in terms of the black hole mass by using the relation @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the circular velocity of the halo ( * ? ? ? * noting that for an nfw profile the circular velocity is related to halo mass as @xmath73 ) .",
    "the radius of the injection sphere is then given by @xmath74 , \\\\",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the ratio of the hubble constant at redshift @xmath76 and @xmath8 , i.e. @xmath77 , @xmath78 @xmath79 is larger than 4 cell sizes at most times .",
    "this additionally reduces the thermal energy inserted into each individual cell , reducing immediate loss of energy through efficient cooling at the highest densities .",
    "again , we only consider this alternative model , which we term the `` phenomenological model '' , when investigating the impact of changes in the thermal feedback model parameters in section  [ sec : agn_impact ] .      in order to identify haloes , including their stellar , black hole and gaseous content in our simulation , we use a heavily modified version of rockstar - galaxies , which is a special version of the original version of rockstar @xcite adapted to work also for simulations including gas and stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* where this version was used ) .",
    "in order to interface ramses with rockstar - galaxies , we convert all leaf cells of the amr tree to pseudo - particles of variable mass , which is however typically not varying over more than an order of magnitude due to the lagrangian refinement strategy .    during the ( sub-)halo finding",
    ", we then calculate all relevant halo and galaxy properties directly inside rockstar - galaxies .",
    "unbinding of gravitationally unbound particles and cells is performed , and we obtain the masses , radii , centres , and bulk velocities of the dark matter , stellar , gaseous , and black hole content of each ( sub-)halo .",
    "we use the consistent - trees code @xcite to link the halo / galaxy catalogues across redshifts based on only the dark matter particle ids .",
    "we additionally compute several galaxy - related quantities , such as the star formation rate , mean stellar age , surface brightness , and magnitude in various photometric bands . for the star formation rate , we simply sum the mass of all star particles younger than 100  myr , divided by 100  myr . for the surface brightness and magnitude calculations ,",
    "we determine the luminosity of each star particle in a given filter applied to the spectral energy distribution obtained from the simple stellar population models from starburst99 @xcite , assuming the metallicity and age of the star particle as the mean age and metallicity of the stellar population . in order to derive the surface brightness - limited galaxy masses ,",
    "we perform a one - dimensional projection and integrate the enclosed stellar mass out to a given surface brightness limit .",
    "we note that we do _ not _ take dust absorption into account , which might affect our comparison with observations .",
    "finally , we also calculate several properties related to the hot plasma , such as the x - ray luminosity and an x - ray emissivity per cell , in order to allow us to weight quantities by their observability in x - ray observations , based on an apec emission model , similar to @xcite .",
    "we neglect however additional sophistications such as actual photon sampling , psf effects or spectral fitting in order to determine the x - ray temperature , which are clearly beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "finally , we also compute the sz flux decrement for each cluster .",
    "we detail how we perform x - ray and sz measurements separately in sections  [ sec : szmasses ] and [ sec : xrayobservables ] , respectively , in the context of the evolution of the clusters along scaling relations .",
    "we perform a detailed comparison of density , temperature , entropy , and gas depletion profiles with x - ray observations in this section . to show both the mean and deviations over cosmic time of the simulated profiles , we consider individually stacked profiles over time for each simulated cluster for all snapshots for which the cluster mass falls into a narrow range .",
    "we discuss this stacking procedure in detail below .",
    "we first discuss some global properties of our sample of simulated galaxy clusters . to give a visual impression of the diversity of the sample , figure  [ fig : rg_sample ] shows density - weighted temperature and density maps for all clusters at @xmath8 . in table",
