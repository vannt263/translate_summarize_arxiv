    "there has been , over the last few years , remarkable progress in the quantum theory of two - dimensional gravity .",
    "two distinct analytic approaches for quantizing two - dimensional gravity have been established .",
    "these are recognized as a discretized@xcite and a continuous@xcite theory .",
    "the discretized approach , implemented by the matrix model technique , exhibits behavior found in the continuous approach , given by liouville field theory , in a continuum limit .",
    "it thus seems to exist strong evidence for the equivalence of the two theories in two dimensions .",
    "numerical methods based on the matrix model , such as that of dynamical triangulation@xcite have drawn much attention as alternative approaches to studying non perturbative effects , being also capable of handling those cases where analytical theories can not yet produce meaningful results . in the dynamical triangulation method ,",
    "calculations of the partition function are performed by replacing the path integral over the metric to a sum over possible triangulations .",
    "several close studies@xcite on the structure of two - dimensional dt surfaces in quantum gravity were made , and it revealed fractal structures of these surfaces .",
    "however , we feel that the relationship between three - dimensional ( also four - dimensional ) quantum gravity and its discretized model is not yet understood . over the past few years a considerable number of numerical studies have been made on three - dimensional simplicial quantum gravity@xcite .",
    "it is generally agreed that the phase transition of three- and four- dimensional simplicial quantum gravity are both first order@xcite .",
    "the problems are still in controversy . on the other hand ,",
    "recent numerical results obtained by the dynamical triangulation for three and four dimensions suggest the existences of the scaling behavior near to the critical point@xcite .",
    "it may be important to note the asymmetric behavior of the order parameter in usual phase diagram .",
    "when the coupling strength , @xmath3 , closes to the critical point from the strong coupling side ( @xmath4 ) which corresponds to the crumple phase , the transition is smooth . on the other hand ,",
    "when @xmath3 closes to the critical point from the weak coupling side ( @xmath5 ) which corresponds to the branched polymer phase , the transition is very rapid . in ref.@xcite",
    "it is reported that near the critical point belonging to the strong coupling phase the scaling behavior of the mother universe exists and also that no mother universe exists in the weak coupling phase ( i.e. , branched polymer phase ) .",
    "it seems reasonable to suppose that the model makes sense as long as we close to the critical point from the strong coupling side .",
    "we actually observe a double peak histogram structure which is a signal of the first order phase transition for an appropriate large lattice size .",
    "therefore , we carefully chose one of peaks belonging to the strong coupling phase as an ensemble for our simulations@xcite .",
    "this paper is intended as two investigations , firstly , the searching a new scaling property for the boundary surfaces in three - dimensional dt manifolds near the critical point ( @xmath6 ) and , secondary , the relation between these boundary surfaces and two dimensional random surfaces implemented by the matrix model .",
    "below we will consider only three - dimensional dt manifolds with @xmath0 topology .",
    "we can represent a typical configuration in fig.[fig:3d_boundary ] .",
    "@xmath7 denotes a three - dimensional dt manifold with @xmath0 topology and @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 denote the boundaries which are closed and orientable triangulated surfaces at a distance @xmath11 from an origin ( @xmath12 ) .",
    "the geodesic distance can be recognized as a usual time parameter .",
    "our model of three - dimensional euclidean quantum gravity with boundaries may be recognized as a model of a quantum nucleation of the universe in @xmath13-dimensional gravity .",
    "the nucleation of the universe by a quantum tunneling may be described by going out of the euclidean signature region to the lorentzian signature region in a sense of the semiclassical approximation@xcite .",
    "the nucleation of the universe can be regarded as a topology - changing process in the sense that the universe takes a transition from the initial state with no boundary to the final state with nontrivial topology .",
    "we can treat the model in a full quantum way which means that we sum up all of the fluctuations of the three - dimensional metric @xmath14 and also put no restriction on the boundary surfaces @xmath15 .",
    "of course , it is possible to introduce the extrinsic curvature on the boundary surface as a physical restriction . the process of a quantum tunneling requests that all the components of the extrinsic curvature vanish ( i.e. , _ totally geodesic _ ) .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec.2",
    "we briefly review the model of the three - dimensional dynamical triangulation . in sec.3",
    "all of our numerical results , especially genus distributions and coordination number distributions for the mother boundary surfaces , are shown .",
    "we summarize our results and discuss some future problems in the final section .",
    "it is not yet known how to give a constructive definition of three - dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "we start with the euclidean einstein - hilbert action , @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the cosmological constant , and @xmath18 is newton s constant of gravity .",
    "we use the lattice action of the three - dimensional model with the @xmath19 topology , corresponding to the above action , as follows : @xmath20 where @xmath21 denotes the total number of @xmath22-simplexes , and @xmath23 ; @xmath24 is the unit volume , and @xmath25 is the angle between two tetrahedra . the coupling @xmath3 is proportional to the inverse of bare newton s constant , and the coupling @xmath26 corresponds to a lattice cosmological constant . for the dynamical triangulation model of three - dimensional quantum gravity , we consider a partition function of the form @xmath27 we sum over all simplicial triangulations , @xmath28 , on a three - dimensional sphere . in practice , we must add a small correction term @xmath29 to the lattice action in order to suppress volume fluctuations .",
    "the correction term is denoted by @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the target value of three - simplexes , and we use @xmath32 in all our run .",
    "a fine tuning of @xmath3 is one of the elaborate works in this model because the critical coupling @xmath6 depends on the size of the system .",
    "a @xmath33 discussed in ref.@xcite is used as the critical value @xmath34 in our simulation . in ref.@xcite",
    "the parameter @xmath3 is tuned to @xmath33 using the multicanonical monte carlo method such that the heights of double peaks of @xmath35 become the same .",
    "we now define the intrinsic geometry using the concept of a geodesic distance as a minimum length ( i.e. , minimum step ) in the dual lattice between two tetrahedrons in a three - dimensional dt space .",
    "suppose a tree - dimensional ball ( 3-ball ) which is covered within @xmath11 steps from a reference 3-simplex in the three - dimensional manifold with @xmath0 topology . naively , the 3-ball has a boundary with spherical topology ( @xmath36 ) .",
    "however , because of the branching of the dt space , the boundary is not always simply - connected , and there usually appear many boundaries which consist of closed and orientable two - dimensional surfaces with any topology and nontrivial structures such as links or knots .",
    "these two - dimensional boundary surfaces are equivalent to two - dimensional randomly triangulated surfaces with corresponding genuses . in order to discuss the scaling properties of these surfaces , the genus distributions of these surfaces",
    "are measured .",
    "we should notice that there appear many boundaries with distance @xmath11 ( see fig.[fig:3d_boundary ] ) .",
    "the boundaries are divided into two classes : one is a baby boundary and the other is a mother one .",
    "the boundaries with small sizes ( @xmath37 ) are called by a baby one .",
    "the baby boundaries are originated from the small fluctuations of the three - dimensional euclidean spaces .",
    "we thus think that these surfaces are non - universal objects and then suffer from large finite size effects . in this section",
    ", we shall concentrate only on the mother boundary . here , we give a precise definition of `` baby '' and `` mother '' universes in fig.[fig:3d_boundary ] .",
    "the mother universe is defined as a boundary surface ( @xmath9 ) with the largest volume ( @xmath38 ) , and the other surfaces are defined as baby universes .",
    "the problem is whether we can distinguish these two kinds of universes ( baby and mother boundary surfaces ) in our simulations .",
    "the answer is yes . in fig.[fig : tip_vol_32k ] we plot the tip volumes ( correspond to @xmath39 , @xmath38 and @xmath40 in fig.1 ) distributions near to the critical point ( @xmath41 and @xmath42 ) with appropriate geodesic distances when @xmath43 .",
    "this figure tells us that there is one mother boundary whose tip volume is prominent and the others belong to the class of the baby universe . at any rate",
    ", we can easily distinguish the mother boundary surface from the others by the measurement of the tip volume .",
    "in ref.@xcite it is reported that the surface - area - distributions ( sad ) of the mother universe show the scaling behavior near to the critical point but the baby universe does not show a scaling behaviour at all . the important point to note",
    "is that in ref.@xcite the measurements in the critical region were done in the strong coupling phase .",
    "therefore , we focus on the mother universe near to the critical point taking the limit from the strong coupling phase following subsections @xmath44 and @xmath45 . on the other hand , it is known that in the weak coupling limit the three - dimensional dt manifold becomes a branched polymer , and its boundary surfaces show no scaling property@xcite .",
    "therefore , we can not consider the genus distributions of boundary surfaces in the weak coupling phase .      an interesting observable for three - dimensional dt manifolds is a genus distribution of boundary surfaces with various geodesic distances .",
    "the genus of the mother boundary surfaces is , in fact , naively expected to scale because the genus is a dimensionless quantity .",
    "the boundary surfaces in general have very complicated and irregular structures .",
    "we illustrate an irregular surface as a simple example : ( @xmath46 ) in fig.[fig : true_genus ] . in order to calculate the genus of these boundary surfaces",
    "we must dispose these irregular configurations .",
    "we thus detach irregular sub - simplexes ( vertices or links ) like in fig.[fig : true_genus ] ( @xmath47 ) ) is recognized as the infinitesimal deformation @xmath48 .",
    "since @xmath49 can be arbitrary small , we obtain the same distributions of the boundary genus as at distance @xmath11 in the limit @xmath50 . ]",
    "the small mother boundary surfaces will suffer a large finite - size effect , so that almost all these surfaces become spherical surfaces .",
    "therefore , we must introduce the lower limit ( @xmath51 ) of the volume for the spherical mother surface in order to avoid the large finite - size effects . in this subsection",
    "we ignore spherical surfaces for simplicity . in next subsection @xmath52",
    ", we actually introduce the lower limit ( @xmath51 ) in order to measure coordination number distributions .",
    "figs.[fig : bg_critical_v16k ] and [ fig : bg_critical_v32k ] shows genus distributions of the mother boundary surfaces @xmath53 with various distances and with @xmath54 and @xmath55 . and",
    "[ fig : bg_critical_v32k ] we prepared about @xmath56 and @xmath57 configurations using the monte carlo method .",
    "we took @xmath58 start points ( simplices ) for @xmath54 and and @xmath59 for @xmath60 par a configuration .",
    "] we naively expect that the genus distributions of the boundary surfaces will show the scaling properties and , in fact , we find scaling behavior , @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the genus and @xmath63 is @xmath64 .",
    "@xmath63 is obtained by the least squares from the data in fig.[fig : bg_critical_v32k ] with @xmath65 and with @xmath66 as a fitting range .",
    "it reveals that the scaling property of the genus distributions becomes the more clear the bigger the size of boundary becomes .",
    "then , this scaling property will remains after the thermal limit @xmath67 .",
    "if @xmath3 is out of the critical point this scaling relation disappears .",
    "we also measure the genus distributions of the mother boundary surface in the strong coupling limit ( i.e. , @xmath68 ) with various @xmath69 and distances .",
    "fig.[fig : boundary_genus_strong ] shows the distributions of the mother boundary surfaces with three different volumes ( @xmath70 and @xmath71 ) , we have prepared @xmath72 and @xmath73 configurations and obtain @xmath74 genus data points evenly for each volume . ] and it reveals that these distributions seem to the gaussian . in this measurement",
    "we select a distance ( @xmath75 ) at which the peak value of each distribution becomes maximum , and actually in fig.[fig : boundary_genus_strong ] we use the values @xmath76 and @xmath77 for @xmath70 and @xmath71 , respectively .",
    "the peak value ( @xmath78 ) of each distribution becomes the larger the bigger the size of boundary surface becomes .",
    "we know that the manifold becomes crumple in this phase , and the fractal dimension seems to diverge .",
    "we , therefore , reasonably conclude that @xmath78 diverges when @xmath69 goes to infinity and that the manifold becomes crumple boundlessly in the strong coupling limit .",
    "we must look more carefully into these boundary mfds . in the last few years",
    ", several articles have been devoted to the study of boundary mfds . in two dimensions ,",
    "it is revealed by ref.@xcite that the dynamics of the string world sheet ( random surfaces ) can be described by the time evolution of boundary loops .",
    "furthermore , the work@xcite is also based on the idea that the functional integral for @xmath79 and @xmath80d quantum gravity can be represented as a superposition of less complicated theory of random surfaces .",
    "it is precisely on such grounds that we claim that the higher dimensional complicated theory of quantum gravity can be reduced to the lower dimensional quantum gravity .",
    "the question is that the closed and orientable two - dimensional boundary surfaces mentioned above can be recognized as the two - dimensional random surfaces described by the matrix model or the liouville field theory . in this subsection ,",
    "we focus on the distributions of the coordination numbers .",
    "the distributions of the coordination numbers have been calculated in ref.@xcite .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath81 can be extracted from the green functions of the @xmath82 planar theory with spherical ( @xmath36 ) topology without self - energy and tadpole graph in dual lattice , @xmath83 where n is a number of 2-simplexes and q is the coordination number .",
    "the probability distribution @xmath81 with small @xmath84 region is strongly dependent on the local lattice structures .",
    "the value ( @xmath85 ) guarantees the randomness of the lattice ( see appendix a ) . in the preceding subsection we pointed out that spherical mother boundary surfaces whose volumes were greater than @xmath51 had to be considered .",
    "fig.[fig : boundary_v.o_comp ] shows the ( correct - normalized ) coordination number distributions of the spherical mother boundary surface for various volumes with @xmath86 . in fig.[fig : boundary_v.o_comp ] we also show the result obtained by the theoretical calculation eq.([eq : coordination ] ) ( broken line ) .",
    "the data of the coordination number distributions of the spherical mother boundary surfaces become consistent with the distributions @xmath87 for large enough @xmath84 . on the other hand ,",
    "there are a few discrepancies between the two - dimensional theoretical curve and the small @xmath84 ( @xmath88 ) distributions in our simulation sizes .",
    "we can not say from only these data whether the mother boundary surfaces with @xmath36 topology are equivalent to the random surfaces implemented by the matrix model or not .",
    "further discussion will be presented in the next section .",
    "we investigate the boundary surfaces of three - dimensional dt manifolds with @xmath0 topology .",
    "it have been naively expected that the genus distributions of boundary surfaces will show the scaling properties near the critical point and , in fact , we find scaling behavior , @xmath89 where @xmath63 is about @xmath90 in our simulation sizes . on these grounds",
    "we may conclude that the thermodynamic limit ( @xmath91 ) can be taken in this scaling region . at the strong coupling limit ( @xmath68 ) the genus distribution of mother universe seems to gaussian distribution , and it is non - universal in the sense that the peak value of genus @xmath78 diverges as @xmath92 . on the other hand , in the weak coupling region ,",
    "all of the size of the boundary surfaces are very small , @xmath37 , and then these genuses are strongly restricted to zero ( i.e. , sphere ) . as a result , there is no scaling behaviour of the genus distributions in the weak coupling phase .",
    "our numerical results show that the coordination number distributions of the spherical mother boundary surfaces of three - dimensional dt manifolds are consistent with the theoretical prediction in the large @xmath84 region .",
    "when these boundary surfaces can be recognized as surfaces of the matrix model or the liouville theory , three - dimensional dt manifolds can be reconstructed by the direct products of @xmath15 ( two - dimensional dt surfaces ) and @xmath11 ( geodesic distance ) . in order to confirm the equivalence between the boundary surfaces in three - dimensions and random surfaces in two - dimensions the string susceptibility @xmath93 of the boundary surfaces or the loop - length - distributions ( lld ) of the boundary surfaces",
    "must be measured and compared with theoretical predictions .",
    "we have obtained some preliminary results of the string susceptibility exponents of the boundary surfaces , and a more complete numerical analysis will be published elsewhere .",
    "we will be able to apply our numerical analysis to other physical process such as the topology changing of surfaces of @xmath13-dimensional gravity . in this process",
    "we substitute the geodesic distance ( @xmath11 ) for the time , and the two - dimensional surfaces are recognized as the boundary of three - dimensional euclidean manifold .",
    "furthermore , the boundary surfaces of three dimensions in general have other nontrivial structures such as hopf s link and the nontrivial knot in the knot theory . up to now",
    ", it is difficult to extract the informations for the extrinsic geometry , i.e. , how to embed the boundary surface into * r*@xmath94 because we have only intrinsic geometries of dt manifold . to know a mechanism of the formation of nontrivial links or knots is one of challenging subjects in the statistical mechanics .",
    "we can obtain the asymptotic coordination number distribution : eq.([eq : coordination ] ) only assuming the poisson distribution function as follows , @xmath95 by using this and the lower limit of @xmath96 we can calculate an average coordination number @xmath97 @xmath98 on the other hand , @xmath97 is trivial in two dimensional dt mfd , @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the euler number . from eqs.(a.2 ) and",
    "( a.3 ) we obtain @xmath101 @xcite .",
