    "even though the overall squeezing is due to both nonlinearities induced by the effective coupling between the first resonator and the nanomechanical oscillator and the optomechanical coupling , the enhancement of the squeezing with pump power is mainly due to the optomechanical coupling .",

    "<S> we show that strong squeezing of the microwave field and robust optomechanical entanglement can be achieved in the presence of moderate thermal decoherence of the mechanical mode . </S>",
