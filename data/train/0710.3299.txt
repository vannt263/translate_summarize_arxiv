    "one of the most important problems of quantum information theory is to try to determine the _ channel capacity _ of noisy quantum channels . in a typical scenario ,",
    "alice would like to send bob information over many uses of a noisy quantum communication link . as the channel is noisy ,",
    "this can not usually be done perfectly , and so they must use some form of block encoding to combat errors .",
    "the channel capacity is defined as the optimal rate at which information may be transferred with vanishing error in the limit of a large number of channel uses .",
    "there are a variety of different capacities , depending upon whether alice and bob are interested in transmitting classical or quantum information , and whether they have extra resources such as prior entanglement . in this paper",
    "we will be concerned mostly with the capacity for sending _",
    "quantum _ information , and",
    "so whenever we write the term ` channel capacity ' we will implicitly be referring to the _ quantum _ channel capacity .    in most work on these problems",
    ", it has usually been assumed that the noisy channel acts independently and identically for each channel use . in this situation",
    "the transformation @xmath0 corresponding to @xmath1-uses of the channel may be written as an @xmath1-fold tensor product of the single - use channel @xmath2 : @xmath3 however , in real physical situations there may be correlations in the noise that acts between successive uses , an interesting example being the decoherence of photons optical fibres under the action of varying birefringence , which can be correlated due to mechanical motion or slow temperature fluctuations @xcite . in such situations",
    "one can not describe the action of the channel in a simple tensor product form : @xmath4 in this setting one must really describe the action of the channel by a family of quantum operations corresponding to each number of uses of the channel @xmath5 : @xmath6 we will call any such family of operations a _ memory channel _ or a _",
    "correlated channel_. defining the notion of channel capacity for such a correlated channel is not always straightforward . in principle",
    "a family of channels such as ( [ family ] ) may not have any sensible limiting behaviour as @xmath7 @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we will not need to discuss this issue in detail , as we will only consider fairly regular channels that have a ( unique ) well - defined notion of channel capacity .",
    "in the case of uncorrelated errors , it has recently been shown @xcite that the quantum channel capacity of an uncorrelated quantum channel is given by : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the so - called _ coherent information _ of the quantum channel @xmath10 : @xmath11 where @xmath12 denotes the von - neumann entropy , @xmath13 is a state , and @xmath14 is a purification of @xmath13 .    given that equation ( [ qform ] ) is the quantum channel capacity for memoryless channels , it is natural to hope that the corresponding expression : @xmath15 will represent the quantum channel capacity in the case of correlated errors .",
    "however , this will not always be the case , not least because this limit does not always exist @xcite .",
    "however , in this paper we will not only assume that this limit exists , we will also initially work under the assumption that it represents the true quantum channel capacity .",
    "we will later discuss this assumption in some detail .",
    "a similar situation occurs for the _ classical _ capacity of correlated quantum channels , where formulae ( [ qform],[qcorr ] ) can be replaced with similar expressions involving the holevo quantity instead of the coherent information .",
    "most prior work on calculating the capacities of correlated quantum channels has focussed on the capacity for classical information .",
    "numerical and mathematical experiments involving a small number of channel uses suggest that in a variety of interesting cases the classical capacity of correlated channels can display interesting non - analytic behaviour .",
    "for instance , the sequence of papers @xcite investigates a certain family of correlated channels parameterized by a _ memory factor _ @xmath16 $ ] which measures the degree of correlations .",
    "the results of @xcite demonstrate that when the correlated channel is refreshed after every two uses ( i.e. consider @xmath17 , rather than the full correlated channel @xmath18 ) , then there is a certain transition value @xmath19 at which the channel capacity displays a definite kink , and above this threshold the optimal encoding states suddenly change from product to highly entangled .",
    "similar phenomena have subsequently been observed in a variety of other cases @xcite .    despite these interesting observations ,",
    "it is still an open question whether the sharp kinks in the capacity of these models still persist if the full correlated channel @xmath20 is considered as @xmath21 , or whether this behaviour is just an artefact of the truncation of the channel at low @xmath1 .",
    "the main difficulty in deciding such questions is that even under the assumption that equations such as ( [ qcorr ] ) ( or its analogue for classical information - the regularised holevo bound ) represent the true quantum capacity of a given correlated channel @xmath20 , in most cases such variational expressions are extremely difficult to compute .",
    "it is however interesting to note that the non - analytic behaviour observed in the channel capacity of correlated channels is somewhat reminiscent of the non - analyticity of physical observables that define a ( quantum ) phase - transition in strongly interacting ( quantum ) many - body systems , where in contrast true _ phase transitions _ usually _ only _ occur in the @xmath7 limit .    motivated by this heuristic similarity , in a previous paper @xcite we connected the study of channels with memory to the study of many - body physics .",
    "one advantage of this approach is that allows the construction of a variety of interesting examples of channels for which equation ( [ qcorr ] ) can either be understood qualitatively or even calculated exactly using the techniques of many - body physics .",
    "one would otherwise usually expect regularized equations such as ( [ qcorr ] ) to either be quite trivial or completely intractable .",
    "this is perhaps the most important consequence of this line of attack  by relating correlated channels directly to many - body physics , we obtain a good method for displaying models of channels with memory that tread the interesting line between ` solvability ' and ` non - solvability ' , in analogy with the many such statistical physics models that have been proposed over the years .",
    "it is quite possible that the insights of _ universality _ , _ scaling _ , and _ renormalisation _ that have been so successful in many - body theory may provide valuable intuition for the study of channels with correlated error .",
    "another advantage of this approach is its connection to physically realistic models of correlated error .",
    "one can imagine that in many real forms of quantum memory , such as optical lattices , any correlated errors might originate from interaction with a correlated environment and thus be strongly related to models of statistical physics .",
    "this provides further physical motivation to examine the properties of correlated channels with a many - body flavour .",
    "the connection to many body physics also naturally leads one to consider channels with structure in 2 or more spatial dimensions . in such situations",
    "it is no - longer appropriate to think of correlations as ` memory ' , as the correlations arise not through a single time dimension , but perhaps through spatial proximity in more than one dimension . in order to define a capacity in such multidimensional situations one would have to decide how to quantify the size of the channel .",
    "natural options could include the total number of particles in the system , or perhaps the size of one linear dimension .",
    "although we will not explicitly discuss multi - dimensional examples in this work , such situations might have interesting connections to the study of error tolerance in computational devices .",
    "this paper is structured as follows . in order to make the paper self - contained , in the sections preceding [ sec : conditions ] we present , including all missing detail , the results of @xcite . in section [ sec : conditions ] we discuss in detail some sufficient conditions that many - body systems must satisfy in order to lead to capacity results according to the approach that we adopt - the arguments that lead to the development of these conditions were sketched in @xcite , however here we provide the full argument . in sections",
    "[ proof1 ] , [ proof2 ] we prove that these conditions hold for finitely correlated states and formulate a fannes type inequality to show the same result for harmonic chains . in the remaining sections we discuss generalisations of our approach and present conclusions .",
    "in this section we re - cap the approach taken in @xcite to construct correlated error models with links to many - body physics .",
    "the starting point is to suppose , as usual , that alice transmits a sequence of particles to bob ( the ` system ' particles ) , and that each particle interacts via a unitary @xmath22 with its _ own _ environmental particle .",
    "so far this is exactly the same setting as uncorrelated noise .",
    "however , although each system particle has its own separate environment , one can introduce memory effects by asserting that the environment particles are in the thermal / ground state of a many - body hamiltonian , such that the interaction terms lead to correlations in the environmental state ( see figure [ modelpicture ] ) .",
    "unlike the uncorrelated case , this means that there will be correlations in the noise on different system particles .    at this point",
    "it is important to discuss some of the subtleties involved in the way that the ` many - body ' system was defined in @xcite . in basic approaches to many - body physics ,",
    "it is usual to consider a system with a finite number of particles , obtain thermal states and ground states , and then take a limit as the number of particles is taken to infinity . in more mathematical statistical physics literature @xcite , however , it is usual to consider genuinely infinite systems from the start .",
    "this involves a number of technical implications , including a very different approach to the concept of a state , which can no longer be expressed in terms of basic density matrices .",
    "the two approaches are not necessarily equivalent and may lead to different results . to avoid such technicalities in this work we will follow the former approach , and for each number of uses of the channel @xmath1 , we will consider a many - body system of size @xmath1 . as a family of channels for each @xmath1",
    "this is a mathematically well defined object , and it is a reasonable question to ask what the resulting channel capacity is . in later sections of the paper",
    "we will also assume _ periodic _ boundary conditions to enable us to analyze whether equation ( [ key ] ) is a valid quantum capacity or not .",
    "again , although this seems like an unnatural assertion , it is mathematically well defined , and in many systems the boundary conditions are believed to make a vanishingly small difference which disappears in the large @xmath1 limit .    of course even with these simplifications not all many - body systems can be solved exactly , or even understood qualitatively .",
    "moreover , even if the many - body system can be well understood , the computation of the limit ( [ qcorr ] ) may still be difficult , and may depend strongly upon the choice of the unitary @xmath22 describing the interaction of each system particle with its associated environmental particle . in order to provide concrete examples",
    ", one must hence make a judicious choice of @xmath22 in order to make analytical progress .",
    "as in @xcite , we choose @xmath22 to be of the form of a controlled - unitary interaction , where the environmental particles act as controls .",
    "in fact , for ease of explanation we will also initially restrict the system and environment particles to be 2-level spins , and the interaction @xmath22 to be a controlled - phase ( ` cphase ' ) gate , which in the computational basis for 2-qubits is defined as , @xmath23 later we will discuss how higher level analogues of the cphase enable similar connections to many - body theories with constituent particles with a higher number of levels .",
    "the reason we make these choices for the controlled unitary interactions is that explicit formulae may be derived for the capacity in terms of relatively simple _ entropic _ expressions which are especially amenable to analysis .",
    "the restriction to controlled - unitary interactions also enables us to consider environment particles that are classical .",
    "for instance , in the case of classical environment 2-level spins , the ` cphase ' interaction will be taken to mean that the system qubit undergoes a pauli-@xmath24 rotation when the environment spin is up , otherwise it is left alone .",
    "it turns out that by considering classical environments it is possible to make more direct connections between the channel capacity of our models and concepts from statistical physics .",
    "so let us proceed in trying to understand the capacity in cases in which the system particles are all two - level systems , with a cphase interaction .",
    "it is helpful to write the resulting channels in a more explicit form .",
    "let us consider a quantum environment first .",
    "let @xmath25 denote spin - down , and @xmath26 denote spin - up .",
    "let us suppose that the environment consists of @xmath27 spins ( eventually we will be interested in the limit @xmath28 ) initially in a state : @xmath29 where the sum is taken over all n - bit strings @xmath30 , and @xmath31 denote the @xmath32th bit of strings @xmath33 respectively .",
    "we can also describe a classical environment in the same way , simply by restricting the input environment state @xmath13 to be diagonal in the computational basis - the cphase interaction will in this case leave the environment unchanged , and will affect the system qubits as if the controls are entirely classical .",
    "if the environment is in the state ( [ envstate ] ) , and the system qubits are initially in the state @xmath34 , then the channel acting upon the system qubits is given by : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the pauli - z operator acting upon qubit @xmath37 .",
    "hence , regardless of whether the environment is considered quantum or classical , the channel that we have described is a probabilistic application of @xmath24-rotations on various qubits . although we will consider qubit @xmath37 to be transmitted earlier in time than any other qubit @xmath32 with @xmath38 , there is no need for us to actually impose such a time ordering - because all the cphase interactions commute with each other , such time ordering is irrelevant @xcite",
    ".    we will be interested in computing equation ( [ qcorr ] ) for such many - body correlated channels . in the next section",
    "we will show that the channel capacity of this channel is given by a simple function of the entropy of the _ diagonal _ elements in the spin up / down basis of the environmental state , i.e. @xmath39 in the case of a classical environment this is just the actual entropy of the spin - chain .",
    "this observation is very useful , as it allows us to apply all the formalism of many - body physics to the problem , also enabling us to that intuition to observe a number of interesting effects . in the quantum case",
    "this function does not correspond to a conventional thermodynamic property , however , we will discuss examples where it is still amenable to a great deal of analysis using many - body methods .",
    "in order to calculate the regularised coherent information ( [ qcorr ] ) for our many - body correlated channels , we will utilise the close relationship between the quantum channel capacity and the entanglement measure known as the _ distillable entanglement _ @xcite .",
    "this connection utilises a well known mapping between quantum operations and quantum states .",
    "given any quantum operation @xmath40 acting upon a @xmath41-level quantum system , one may form the quantum state : @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the canonical maximally entangled state of two d - level systems .",
    "the state @xmath44 is sometimes referred to as the _ choi - jamiolkowski _ state of the operation @xmath40 @xcite .",
    "it can be shown that the mapping from @xmath40 to @xmath44 is invertible , and hence the state @xmath44 gives a one - to - one representation of a quantum operation .",
    "we will show that for the kinds of correlated error channel that we have described above in equation ( [ channel ] ) , the quantum channel capacity @xmath45 of the channel equals @xmath46 , the distillable entanglement of the state @xmath44 .    to make the presentation more transparent",
    ", we will make the argument for the choi - jamiolkowski ( cj ) state of a particular single qubit channel , as it is straightforward to generalize the argument to the entire family of memory - channels described above .",
    "hence let us consider the following single qubit ` dephasing ' channel : @xmath47 where @xmath48 is a probability , and @xmath24 is the pauli z operator .",
    "the cj representation of this channel is : @xmath49 where @xmath50 is chosen as in equation ( [ cj ] ) .",
    "the argument relies upon the fact that the channel ( @xmath51 ) possesses some useful symmetry .",
    "this symmetry leads to the property that having one use of the channel is both mathematically and _ physically _ equivalent to having one copy of @xmath44 .",
    "suppose that you have one use of @xmath40 , you can easily create @xmath44 . however , it turns out that with one copy @xmath44 you can also implement one use of @xmath40 .",
    "hence both the operation and the cj state are physically equivalent resources .",
    "the argument works as follows .",
    "suppose that you have @xmath44 and you want to implement one action of @xmath40 upon an input state @xmath13 .",
    "this can be achieved by teleporting @xmath13 through your copy of @xmath44 .",
    "this will leave you with the state @xmath52 , with the pauli operator @xmath53 depending upon the outcome of the bell measurement that does the teleportation .",
    "however , the channel ( @xmath51 ) commutes with all pauli rotations .",
    "so we can  undo \" the effect of the pauli by applying the inverse of @xmath53 , which for paulis is just @xmath53 itself .",
    "hence we have : @xmath54 .",
    "hence by teleporting into @xmath44 and undoing the pauli at the end we can implement one use of the operation .",
    "this observation allows us to relate the channel capacity of the channel to the distillable entanglement of the cj state .",
    "the proof proceeds in two steps , and follows well known ideas taken from articles such as @xcite .",
    "the aim is to show that the 1-way distillable entanglement of @xmath55 is equivalent to @xmath56 , so that previous results on @xmath57 may be applied .",
    "\\(1 ) proof that @xmath45 @xmath58 1-way distillation : ( 1 ) alice prepares many perfect epr pairs and encodes one half according to the code that achieves the quantum capacity @xmath45 .",
    "( 2 ) she teleports the encoded qubits through the copies of @xmath44 , telling bob the outcome so that he can undo the effect of the paulis . ( 3 ) this effectively transports all encoded qubits to bob , at the same time acting on them with @xmath40 . ( 4 ) bob does the decoding of the optimal code , thereby sharing perfect epr pairs with alice , at the rate determined by @xmath45 .",
    "as this is a specific one - way distillation protocol , this means that @xmath59 .",
    "\\(2 ) proof that @xmath45 @xmath60 1-way distillation : ( 1 ) alice prepares many perfect epr pairs and sends one half of each pair through many uses of the channel @xmath40 , ( 2 ) she and bob do one way distillation of the resulting pairs ( this involves only forward classical communication from alice to bob ) .",
    "( 3 ) thereby they share perfect epr pairs , at the rate determined by @xmath46 , the 1-way distillable entanglement of .",
    "( 4 ) they can use these epr pairs to teleport qubits from alice to bob . as",
    "this is a specific quantum communication protocol , this means that @xmath61 .",
    "these arguments can easily be extended to apply to any channel that is a mixture of pauli rotations on many qubits , hence including the memory channel models that we have described above . hence to calculate the quantum channel capacity of our channels",
    "we must calculate the distillable entanglement of the channel s cj state .",
    "fortunately , the cj state of our channel is a so - called _ maximally correlated _ state , for which the distillable entanglement is known to be equivalent to the hashing bound : @xmath62 where @xmath12 is the von - neumann entropy .",
    "note that for such channels @xmath63 this expression is equivalent to the _ single copy",
    "_ coherent information , which is hence additive for product channels @xmath64 . in our case",
    "we are interested in the regularised value of this quantity for correlated channels , i.e. : @xmath65 which can be computed quite easily as : @xmath66 where @xmath67 the state obtained by eliminating all off - diagonal elements of the state of the environment ( in the computational basis )",
    ". hence the computation of the quantum channel capacity of our channel @xmath20 reduces to the computation of the regularised diagonal entropy in the limit of an infinite spin chain .",
    "although in most cases this quantity is unlikely to be computable analytically , it is amenable to a great deal of analysis using the techniques of many - body theory .",
    "it is also interesting to note the intuitive connection between expression ( [ key ] ) and work on environment assisted capacities - in the case of random unitary channels , where the unitaries are mutually orthogonal , the diagonal entropy in expression ( [ key ] ) has a natural interpretation as the amount of classical information that needs to be recovered from the environment in order to correct the errors @xcite .",
    "although the above analysis has been conducted for 2-level particles , it can be extended to situations involving @xmath41-level systems . in the @xmath41-level case one",
    "can replace cphase with a controlled shift operation of the form : @xmath68 where the @xmath69 are the versions of the qubit phase gate generalized to @xmath41-level systems , and the first part of the tensor product acts on the environment . with this interaction all the previous analysis goes through , and the @xmath41-level version of eq .",
    "( [ key ] ) : @xmath70 gives the regularized coherent information , where diag(@xmath13 ) refers to the diagonal elements in the @xmath41-level computational basis .",
    "it is important to consider the generalization to @xmath41-level systems because the thermodynamic properties of many - body systems do not always extend straightforwardly to systems with a higher number of levels .",
    "for instance , one possible generalization of the ising model to @xmath41-level systems is the _ potts _ model , which leads to some very interesting and non - trivial mathematical structure @xcite , and in the quantum heisenberg model the presence of a ground state gap depends on where the spins in the chain are integral or half - integral @xcite .",
    "the simplicity of equation ( [ key ] ) enables one to immediately write down many noise models for which the regularized coherent information can both be calculated , and also represents the quantum channel capacity of the correlated channel .",
    "in particular , let us suppose that the environment consists of classical systems described by a classical _ markov chain _ ( those readers not familiar with the markov chain terminology required here please see chapter 5 of @xcite for a very readable introduction ) .",
    "if the state at each ` site ' @xmath71 in the environment represents the instantaneous state of a markov chain at time @xmath71 , then the regularised entropy in equation ( [ dkey ] ) is given by the _ entropy rate _ of the markov chain @xcite , provided that the markov process is both _",
    "irreducible _ and possesses a _",
    "unique _ stationary ( equilibrium ) state .",
    "let the transition matrix of @xmath72 of the markov chain be defined such that @xmath73 , let @xmath74 be the @xmath37th element of the stationary probability distribution , and let @xmath75 be the entropy of column @xmath37 in the markov chain transition matrix . with these conventions the entropy rate",
    "is given by : @xmath76 in these cases the correlated channels fit quite neatly into the class of models proposed in @xcite , and moreover these channels will be _ forgetful _ @xcite . as proven in @xcite , for forgetful channels the regularized coherent information is equal to the quantum capacity ( see @xcite for an independent coding argument which also works for markov chain channels implementing generalised pauli rotations ) .",
    "hence for these models equation ( [ dkey ] ) represents the true quantum channel capacity , and so we may write explicitly : @xmath77 when unique , the stationary distribution of a markov chain is given by the unique maximal right eigenvector ( of eigenvalue 1 ) of the transition matrix .",
    "related results have been obtained independently in the articles @xcite .",
    "in the case of a classical environment , the second term of equation ( [ key ] ) is precisely the entropy of the environment , and so it can easily be computed in terms of the partition function .",
    "the partition function of the classical system is defined as : @xmath78 where the @xmath79 are the energies of the various possible configurations , and @xmath80 , with @xmath81 the temperature and @xmath82 boltzmann s constant .",
    "the entropy ( in nats ) of the system is given by the following expression : @xmath83 this means that in the case of a classical environment our channel capacity becomes @xmath84 where the @xmath85 converts us back from nats to bits .",
    "this expression means that we can use all the machinery from classical statistical mechanics to compute the channel capacity .",
    "in particular , any spin - chain models from classical physics that can be solved exactly will lead to channels with memory that can be ` solved exactly ' ( provided that one can show that the regularized coherent information is indeed the capacity , a problem that we shall discuss in later sections ) .",
    "the most famous example of an ` exactly solvable ' classical spin - chain model is the ising model .",
    "we will discuss the classical ising model in detail in the next section , as it will also be relevant to a certain class of quantum spin - chains .",
    "however , there are also _ many _ classical spin - chain models that _ can not _ always be solved exactly , but which can be connected to a wide variety of physically relevant models with interesting behaviour . as just one example , consider modifying the ising spin - chain model to allow exponentially decaying interactions between non - adjacent spins .",
    "the resulting model can be related to a quantum double - well system , and is also known to exhibit a phase transition @xcite .",
    "this means that the corresponding correlated channels will also exhibit similar behaviour , provided of course that the limit eq .",
    "( [ qcorr ] ) truly represents the quantum channel capacity for the models .    in this paper",
    "we will not give detailed discussion of any further models involving a classical environment ( other than the classical 1d ising chain , which we will discuss in the next section ) . as our expression ( [ key ] ) is simply the entropy of the classical environment , the interested reader may simply refer to the many interesting classical models ( both solvable and almost solvable ) that are well documented in the literature . of course , to make the analysis rigorous one would need to show that expression ( [ qcorr ] ) is the formula for the quantum capacity in these cases .",
    "however , we conjecture that for most sensible models this should be true . in the final section of the paper",
    "we will present an analysis that demonstrates this for a family of 1d models .",
    "unfortunately expression ( [ key ] ) does not correspond to a standard thermodynamic function of the environment state when the environment is modelled as a quantum system .",
    "it represents the entropy of the state that results when the environment is decohered by a dephasing operation on every qubit .",
    "although this quantity is not typically considered by condensed matter physicists , there is some hope that it will be amenable to analysis using the techniques of many - body theory .    in this paper",
    "we will make a small step towards justifying this hope by analytically considering a class of quantum environments inspired by recent work on so - called _ finitely correlated _ or _ matrix product states _",
    "@xcite .",
    "we will leave attempts to analytically study more complicated models to another occasion , although in figure ( [ quantumising ] ) we present some numerical evidence that the quantum 1d ising model displays a sharp change in capacity at the transition point .",
    "_ finitely correlated _ or _ matrix product _ states are a special class of efficiently describable quantum states that have provided many useful insights into the nature of complex quantum systems @xcite .",
    "in a recent paper @xcite it has been demonstrated that a variety of interesting hamiltonians can be constructed with exact matrix product ground states , such that the hamiltonians in question undergo non - standard forms of quantum ` phase transition ' .    as matrix product states are relatively simple to describe , one might hope that for such ground states the computation of equation ( [ key ] ) may be particularly tractable . in this section",
    "we will see that for matrix product states involving _",
    "rank-1 _ matrices the analysis is particularly simple , and may be reduced to the solution of a classical 1d ising model .",
    "let us consider a 1d matrix product state , where each particle is a 2-level quantum system , @xmath86 .",
    "let us assume that the matrices associated to each level are independent of the site label , and are given by @xmath87 for level @xmath25 and @xmath88 for level @xmath26 .",
    "hence the total _ unnormalised _ state can be written as : @xmath89 in this expression if we relabel the matrices @xmath90 and @xmath91 then probability of getting various outcomes when measuring the environment in the computational basis will be given by traces of all possible products of the @xmath92s and @xmath93s . for instance , the probability of getting 01100 ... when measuring the environment in the computational basis will be given by : @xmath94 where @xmath27 is the number of qubits in the environment , and @xmath95 is a normalisation factor given by : @xmath96 @xmath95 can be computed by diagonalisation . in the rest of this section",
    "we will be interested in cases where @xmath92 and @xmath93 are both square _",
    "rank-1 _ matrices .",
    "some of the example hamiltonians discussed in @xcite have ground states with this property , and in fact some special cases of the noise models presented in @xcite can also be expressed in the form of matrix product environments with rank-1 matrices ( although in general those models require more than two matrices as they require environmental spins with more than 2 levels ) .",
    "we will show that in such situations the diagonal entropy in the computational basis is equivalent to the entropy of a related classical ising chain .",
    "the first thing to note is that rank-1 matrices are almost idempotent .",
    "in fact , if @xmath97 are both rank-1 matrices , then we have that : @xmath98 where @xmath99 is the only non - zero eigenvalue of @xmath92 , and @xmath100 is the only non - zero eigenvalue of @xmath93 .",
    "note that because of the form of @xmath92 and @xmath93 as the tensor product of a matrix and its complex conjugate , these eigenvalues @xmath101 must be non - negative .",
    "we can define the normalised matrices : @xmath102 these normalised matrices _ are _ idempotent . to see how this can help ,",
    "consider a particular string , say , @xmath103 if we substitute @xmath104 and @xmath105 into this expression , and use the idempotency , then the strings of consecutive as and bs will collapse to just one @xmath104 or @xmath105 , with total factors of @xmath106 and @xmath107 inserted outside the trace : @xmath108 it is easy to see that this form is quite general - the probability of getting a particular string will collapse to a simple expression .",
    "if there are @xmath109 occurrences of @xmath92 and @xmath110 occurrences of @xmath93 in the string , and @xmath111 counts the number of boundaries between blocks of @xmath92s and blocks od @xmath93s , then the probability of the string becomes : @xmath112 noting that @xmath113 will also be a rank-1 matrix , let us use the letter @xmath114 to refer to its only non - zero eigenvalue .",
    "hence the probability becomes : @xmath115 this expression tells us quite a lot - firstly for any given channel described by rank-1 mps states , the only parameters that matter are @xmath116 .",
    "so we need nt work with the actual matrices defining our state , we only need to work with matrices of our choosing that have the same parameters @xmath101 and @xmath114 . in the following",
    "we will assert that @xmath114 is non - negative - this is guaranteed because of the following argument : it holds that @xmath117 , because @xmath113 is rank-1 , but because @xmath118 , where @xmath101 are non - negative , this means that @xmath114 must be non - negative .",
    "so let us just go ahead and pick the following matrices : @xmath119 these matrices clearly have non - zero eigenvalues @xmath101 respectively .",
    "so what about the eigenvalue of @xmath113 ? for the above choice of matrices",
    "we find that : @xmath120 hence we find that the matrices that we have chosen have the correct values of @xmath116 , as required .",
    "now we notice that the matrices that we have chosen in equation ( [ choice ] ) are very similar to the matrices that would define a classical ising chain .",
    "in fact , if we make the following change of variables from @xmath116 to @xmath121 : @xmath122 the inverse transformations are : @xmath123 it turns out that the parameters @xmath124 will represent coupling constants and @xmath72 will represent a magnetic field . to see this",
    "let us insert the new parameters into the choice of @xmath97 in equation ( [ choice ] ) .",
    "then we get that the matrices ( [ choice ] ) can be written : @xmath125 the matrices in such a rank-1 mps are essentially the top row and bottom row of a transfer matrix . comparing these matrices to the classical ising transfer matrix",
    "we see that the following hamiltonian ( where for convenience we now follow the usual physics convention that @xmath126 ) : @xmath127 the @xmath128 is just a constant shift in spectrum , so we can simply consider the ising chain with hamiltonian : @xmath129 the partition function for such a chain of n particles depends upon the transfer matrix for this ( rescaled ! ) hamiltonian : @xmath130 now from the partition function we can calculate the entropy , and hence the capacity of our channel .",
    "the formula turns out to be : @xmath131 where @xmath132 is the maximal eigenvalue of the transfer matrix ( [ transfer ] ) . using these equations and equation ( [ inverse ] )",
    "one can perform the ( tedious ) manipulation required to derive a formula for the regularized coherent information in terms of the coefficients @xmath116 .",
    "although we do not present the formula that is obtained , figure ( [ wolfplot ] ) shows the result for the model hamiltonian presented in @xcite : @xmath133 for which the ground state is known to be a matrix product state of the form : @xmath134    this model system has a non - standard ` phase transition ' at @xmath135 , at which some correlation functions are continuous but non - differentiable , while the ground state energy is actually analytic @xcite .",
    "as discussed in the caption of figure ( [ wolfplot ] ) , this behaviour is mirrored in the channel capacity .",
    "in this section we will explore under what conditions our assumption that the regularized coherent information of equation ( [ qcorr ] ) : @xmath136 correctly represents the true quantum capacity of our correlated channels , assuming of course that this limit exists .",
    "in the course of the discussion we will also need to consider under what conditions the regularized holevo bound : @xmath137 represents the capacity of the channel for _ classical _ information .",
    "the holevo bound @xmath138 for a quantum channel @xmath63 is defined as @xcite : @xmath139 where the supremum is taken over all probabilistic ensembles of states @xmath140 , and @xmath12 as usual represents the von neumann entropy . as pointed out in @xcite , showing that equations ( [ qrep])/([crep ] ) are _ upper _ bounds to the quantum / classical capacity of a correlated channel is straightforward - one can use exactly the same arguments used in the memoryless case @xcite .",
    "showing that equations ( [ qrep])/([crep ] ) also give _ lower _ bounds to the relevant capacities is not as simple , and may not be true for some many - body environments .",
    "however , it turns out that if the correlations in the many - body system fall off sufficiently strongly , then the channel will be reasonably well behaved and equation ( [ qrep ] ) is true . in this section",
    "we will make this statement quantitative .",
    "we will closely follow the approach taken in @xcite in the analysis of so - called _ forgetful _ channels .",
    "some of the subtleties involved in the analysis are explained in more detail in section vi of that paper .",
    "the conditions that we obtain are independent of the unitary which governs the interaction between each system particle and its corresponding environment , and so are applicable more widely than the dephasing interaction considered here .      in this subsection",
    "we present an intuitive sketch of the argument that we will follow .",
    "imagine that the correlated channel is partitioned into large blocks that we shall call _ live _ qubits , separated by small blocks that we shall call _ spacer _ qubits .",
    "the idea is to throw away the spacer qubits , inserting into them only some standard state , and to only use the _ live _ qubits to encode information ( see figure [ livespace ] ) . if we are to follow this procedure , then we will not be interested in the full channel , but only in its effect upon the live qubits .",
    "let us use the phrase _ live channel _ to describe the resulting channel - i.e. the reduced channel that acts on the _ live _ qubits only .",
    "if the correlations in the many - body system decay sufficiently strongly , then by throwing away just a few spacer qubits we will find that the live channel closely approximates ( in a sense to be discussed later ) a memoryless channel . let us call this memoryless channel the _ product _ channel .",
    "one can imagine trying to use the codes that achieve the capacity of the _ product _ channel , without any further modifications , as codes for the _ live _ channel .",
    "it turns out that under the ` right conditions ' these codes are not only good codes for the live channel , but their achievable rates approach equation ( [ qrep ] )",
    ". the goal of the next subsection will be to explore exactly what these ` right conditions ' are .",
    "the quantitative arguments follow the method used in @xcite , where three steps are required to show that equation ( [ qrep ] ) is an achievable rate :    * first we must show that product codes for the transmission of classical information are good codes for the live channel . *",
    "then we must show that these good codes allow the regularized holevo quantity to be an achievable rate .",
    "this is done by showing that the product channel holevo quantity ( which can be achieved by product codes ) essentially converges to the regularized holevo quantity for the whole channel .",
    "* then we must argue that these arguments for the transmission of classical information can be ` _ coherentified _ ' ( in the manner of @xcite ) to a good quantum code attaining equation ( [ qrep ] ) .",
    "in the next subsection we go through this process in detail to derive sufficient conditions to demonstrate the validity of equation ( [ qrep ] ) for our many - body channels .      in this subsection",
    "we will go through steps [ a],[b],[c ] in turn .",
    "we will assume that the many - body systems in question satisfy periodic boundary conditions and are translationally invariant ( this means that the corresponding correlated channel @xmath141 does not quite fit into the definition of causality proposed by @xcite , however , it allows us to avoid the technicalities required to analyze a truly , genuinely , infinite many - body system ) .",
    "let us consider a specific length of chain @xmath27 , split into @xmath142 _ sections _ , each consisting of one live block of length @xmath109 and one spacer block of length @xmath143 . in the following the sizes @xmath144",

    "this assertion will be demonstrated for some special cases in section [ proof1 ] .",
    "then this would mean that the error becomes bounded as @xmath167 the @xmath168 part of this error depends upon the number of blocks @xmath169 .",
    "one potential problem that we immediately face is that to decrease @xmath168 we need to increase @xmath169 , however , increasing @xmath169 inevitably increases the last error term in the equation .",
    "it is hence not a priori clear that both error terms can be made to decrease simultaneously .",
    "however , it can be shown @xcite that if we pick @xmath170 then both error components can be made to vanish as @xmath109 increases , while still operating at the achievable rates of the product channels ( in fact , the number of sections @xmath169 could be given any polynomial or subexponential dependance on @xmath109 provided that asymptotically @xmath171 ) .",
    "so we see that provided condition ( [ decay ] ) can be demonstrated for the many - body systems that we consider , then the product channel works well for the live channel , as long as a large enough live block size is used ( however small the fraction of spacer qubits @xmath172 ) . hence equation ( [ decay ] ) is the first of our sufficient conditions . in section [ proof1 ]",
    "we demonstrate that condition ( [ decay ] ) ( which is identical to equation ( [ decayrepeat ] ) later in the paper ) holds for some interesting classes of many - body system , including matrix product states .      now that we know that the product code is also suitable for the live channel , it is necessary to check that the regularized holevo bound ( i.e. the regularized holevo bound for the full channel without throwing spins away ) is actually an achievable rate for the live / spacer blocking code that has been used . in order to make this analysis it will be convenient to define a little more notation . for a total chain of length @xmath1 as before let @xmath0 denote the noisy channel . for a contiguous subset of @xmath173 of the spins that alice sends , let @xmath174 denote the effect of the channel only upon those spins .",
    "due to translational invariance the location of the spins is irrelevant , as long as they form a contiguous block .",
    "a given product channel with live block length @xmath109 and a total number of spins @xmath175 has a holevo quantity given by : @xmath176 where the @xmath177 merely acts as a place holder for the inputs to the channel .",
    "our goal is to show that for large enough @xmath109 this expression is close to the regularized holevo bound equation ( [ crep ] ) ( see figure [ requirements2 ] ) .",
    "it is not too difficult to derive conditions under which this will be the case .",

    "intuition suggests that if the correlations decay fast enough , then it should be the case that for @xmath188 we should have approximately @xmath189 , as a given region should nt ` feel ' how long the chain is .",

    "now that we have understood the conditions under which the regularized holevo bound represents the capacity for the transmission of _ classical _ information , we need to try to undertake the same analysis for _ quantum _ information . as was also exploited in @xcite , the way that devetak s work @xcite proves that the regularized coherent information equals the quantum channel capacity of _ memoryless _ channels is to first prove a capacity formula for the transmission of _ private _ ( secret ) classical information , and then to make the private coding scheme _",
    "coherent_. this ` coherentification ' procedure applies directly to correlated channels , and so to argue that the regularized coherent information ( [ qrep ] ) is also achievable for channels with correlated noise , it is sufficient to show that the private information codes that work for the product channel are also suitable for the live channel .",
    "so now suppose that a malicious eavesdropper is in charge of the environment of our correlated channel .",
    "we need to prove that the information that she can access is still limited when product private codes are used for the live channel .",

    "is a non - trivial task .",

    "our presentation of the argument benefits from the arguments presented in appendix a of @xcite and the review article @xcite .",
    "an important tool in the argument is the use of the _ jordan canonical form _ @xcite .",
    "as some readers may be unfamiliar with this technique , we briefly review it here .",
    "if a square matrix @xmath72 has complex eigenvalues @xmath223 , then it can be shown that a basis may be found in which the operator can be expressed as the following direct sum : @xmath224 where each @xmath225 is an identity sub - block with an appropriate dimension , and each @xmath226 is a _ nil - potent _ matrix , meaning that for each @xmath226 there is some positive integer @xmath227 such that @xmath228 .",
    "moreover , each nilpotent matrix @xmath226 itself may be written as a block - diagonal matrix , where each sub - block is either a zero matrix , or is all zero except possibly for 1s that may be positioned on the super - diagonal .",
    "in other words , each sub - block of a given @xmath226 is either zero or is of the form : @xmath229 the decomposition ( [ jordan ] ) is the jordan canonical form of @xmath72 . in our case",
    "the matrix @xmath72 will be constructed from a completely positive map that can be associated to the matrix product states that we consider .",
    "one consequence of this , for reasons that we discuss later , is that we will ultimately only be interested in operators @xmath72 whose eigenvalues satisfy @xmath230 . for a related reason we will also only be interested matrices @xmath72",

    "it is natural to ask whether the approach that we have adopted can enable progress to be made for unitary interactions other than controlled - phase gates ( or their higher dimensional analogues ) .",
    "some generalisation are immediate .",
    "for instance , given _ any _ channels that are probabilistic applications of unitaries , where the unitaries are controlled on different classical or quantum basis states of the environment , expression ( [ key ] ) can easily be shown to be an explicit lower bound to the regularized coherent information .",
    "hence if the environment state has sufficiently decaying correlations , expression ( [ key ] ) will also be a _",
    "lower _ bound to channel capacity . in a similar manner it is likely that any channel whose capacity can be bounded by such simple entropic expressions will benefit from similar insights .",
    "we have considered models of correlated error inspired by many - body physics , with the aim of demonstrating behaviour in the capacity that parallels similar behaviour in the associated many - body systems . in this context a number of interesting questions which require further investigation .",
    "the first of these questions regards our initial motivation - to find models of correlated error that display interesting non - analytic behaviour .",
    "however , non - analytic behaviour in many - body systems arises only in the _ thermodynamic limit _ , and",
    "so our results unfortunately do not really explain why the non - analyticities that have been observed in papers such as @xcite occur for _ finite _ truncations of the channel .",
    "furthermore , the quest for ` genuine ' non - analyticity is actually open to some debate - by redefining the parameters defining the channel , it is always possible to remove any non - analytic behaviour .",
    "however , we hope that our work may help to shed light on non - analytic behaviour for physically relevant parameter choices such as magnetic fields and inter - particle couplings . in realistic models of correlated error",
    "it is such forms of parametrization that will probably be most important .",
    "it will also be interesting to see how far the approach adopted here can be extended to other possible system environment interactions .",
    "the channels that we have investigated above are all of a very specific kind - as random unitary channels , they do not permit quantum information to be transmitted from one system particle to another via the environment .",
    "more general channels with memory will have this property , and so it will be interesting to understand what effects this qualitative difference this can make .",
    "another open question is whether the conditions ( [ decayrepeat ] , [ longshort ] ) can be established for wider families of many - body system .",
    "in addition to the systems for which we have demonstrated these conditions , recent work by m. hastings @xcite demonstrates that they hold for the ground states of many fermionic systems too .",
    "his approach raises interesting questions concerning topological invariants which may have further significance for the problems considered in this paper .",
    "finally , it is important to note that the connections made in @xcite and this work are actually quite natural - entropies and correlations have a significant role in statistical physics , and so quantum channel capacities with correlated error should have some connection to many - body physics .",
