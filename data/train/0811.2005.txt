    "astronomical source variability is poorly explored on  1 - 100y timescales , where large scale systematic surveys are generally lacking . the digital access to a sky century @ harvard ( dasch ) project ( @xcite , in preparation ; paper i ) is designed to open the window on variability studies over a very wide range of timescales (  1d -  100y ) as recorded on the  500,000 harvard plates .",
    "these were obtained full - sky over a century ( 1880 - 1985 ) from small telescopes in the southern and northern hemispheres and have been key for a number of fundamental astronomical discoveries . with our recent development of a very high - speed plate scanning machine @xcite ,",
    "it has become practical to digitize the full collection . in this paper",
    ", we report on the initial digitization and analysis software as developed from scans of a field centered on the praesepe ( m44 ) open cluster .",
    "the @xmath0600 plates scanned to include the cluster , and which cover a @xmath020deg x 20deg field ( with radially decreasing coverage ) , enable development of the astrometry and photometry analysis pipeline .",
    "we describe the key features of this analysis system and present initial results for astrometric and photometric accuracy and completeness that can be achieved with dasch .",
    "example light curves are shown for a variety of objects .",
    "a subsequent paper ( @xcite ; paper iii ) extends the pipeline with additional processing steps ( e.g. for source crowding and plate defect rejection ) and reports on a generalized large - amplitude variable search for the m44 region .",
    "the dasch digitizer @xcite is capable of scanning one 11x17 inch or two 8x10 inch plates in less than a minute .",
    "the digitizer output is a set of 64 or 32 partially - overlapping frames which are then mosaiced to form a single image of each plate .",
    "the design and workings of the digitizer are fully described by @xcite , its essential features are a precise ( 0.2 micron ) x - y stage carrying the plate ; which is illuminated from below by a red led array and imaged from above by a 4kx4k ccd camera at 1:1 scale via a tele - centric lens assembly , the exposure is controlled by the led pulse duration ( 7 ms average ) .",
    "digital images are captured via a 12 bit adc , which thanks to sensitive control of the exposure level is sufficient to record the full dynamic range of the photographic negative .",
    "the transmitted intensity scale is then inverted to give a positive image for further analysis .",
    "the camera pixels measure 11 microns which due to the telecentric ( zero - magnification ) lens are able to capture details finer than the emulsion grains .",
    "the design specifications for the digitzer are such that every salient detail of the original data is recorded , and therefore the job of scanning the plates will not need to be repeated .",
    "an automated procedure based upon routines in wcstools ( tdc-www.harvard.edu/software/wcstools/ ) first determines an approximate world coordintate system ( wcs ) for the plate .",
    "this determines the correct orientation of the plate , the image scale (  /pixel ) and fits a tangent plane projection ( tan ) to produce a rough ( @xmath1 arcsec ) celestial co - ordinate frame .",
    "the tan solution is used a starting point for sextractor ( @xcite , hearefter @xmath2 ) to detect all objects on the plate and assign initial ra , dec coordinates .",
    "the se catalog is matched against the gsc2.2 catalog with a 20  matching radius , keeping only the closest match to each star .",
    "a rough photometric calibration is derived for the entire plate by fitting a quadratic to the gsc2.2 ( @xmath3 ) vs instrumental magnitude , this calibration is used to reject incorrect matches ( disagreement greater than 1 mag ) to produce a clean calibration catalog . finally the calibration catalog is used as input to the iraf task ccmap , which fits a more accurate plate solution to the x , y vs ra , dec data .",
    "we use the tnx plate solution ( http://iraf.noao.edu/projects/ccdmosaic/tnx.html ) which consists of a tangent plane projection plus polynomial terms to model geometric distortions in the image .",
    "distortions originate primarily in the original telescope / camera optics with only minor contributions from the dasch scanner .",
    "our lens introduces distortions of order 1 pixel at the corner of the ccd frame . in the present work this is mitigated by overlapping the frames and averaging to create the full - plate mosaic image . following extensive testing of astrometric plate solutions",
    "it was found that a 6th order polynomial distortion model in x and y is required to produce a solution free of systematic residuals , while increasing the number of terms produces no further improvement .",
    "examples of actual astrometric residuals for different plate - series are shown in figure  [ fig : wcs ] , plotted as a function of distance from the center of the plate . the residual scatter ( rms ) of the final plate solutions",
    "is of order 1 pixel , which corresponds to between 1 and 5 arcseconds depending on the plate - scale .",
    "the fundamental objective of dasch is a precision ( @xmath40.1mag ) database cataloging the changes in brightness of every resolved star in the sky brighter than about 17th magnitude , over 100 years @xcite .",
    "such a goal requires careful control of many potential sources of inconsistency . following the assignment of an accurate astrometric solution to each plate",
    ", the transmitted intensity scale must be calibrated to yield stellar magnitudes on a standard system .",
    "photometric calibration entails three distinct challenges : ( 1 ) detecting all real stars recorded on the plate ( without introducing spurious objects ) ; ( 2 ) measuring the brightness of every star in a consistent and optimized manner ; and ( 3 ) removing the effects of uneven illumination ( vignetting ) , development and emulsion irregularities .",
    "in addition the calibration must be consistent between separate plates and between plate - series , despite large variations in plate - scale , exposure - time , development , emulsion characteristics , telescope optics , and atmospheric conditions at the time of observations . in this paper",
    "we describe how all of the above variables are accounted for in the dasch photometry pipeline .",
    "the sensitivity of photographic materials is traditionally described by the _",
    "characteristic curve _ of log(exposure ) vs log(density ) where exposure is codified through a reciprocal arrangement of exposure time and incident light intensity , density refers to a measure of number of developed grains per unit area , and hence the degree of darkening of the emulsion .",
    "the characteristic curve is normally s shaped with a linear ( in log - log space ) portion in the middle , over which the aforementioned reciprocal relation is valid . at higher exposure",
    "values the linear regime breaks down , with increased exposure leading to an ever diminishing increase in density , a situation referred to reciprocity failure .",
    "given the heterogeneous nature of the plate collection , and paucity of detailed records on emulsions , developers , and procedures at the different observing stations , it is safest to assume that the characteristic curve is different for every single plate .",
    "contemporary photometric calibration was performed in a variety of ways .",
    "these included : ( 1 ) secondary exposures of standard star - fields ( 2 ) multiple exposures obtained by opening and closing the camera shutter for precisely timed intervals , with the telescope drive turned off in - between . so as to produce calibration sequences from the brighter stars on the plate , to be compared against the fainter science - program stars .",
    "( 3 ) the use of glass wedges and wire diffraction gratings to produce calibration sequences .",
    "these devices were placed over the objective - lens to produce multiple images of the brightest stars on a plate .",
    "the diameters of these images are in an exact ratio to the primary images providing a calibration , as described by @xcite .",
    "( 4 ) calibration wedges ( small sections of the plate exposed by a lamp , through filters of known density ) are present on a few percent of the plates .",
    "none of these ingenious approaches are suitable for furnishing a uniform photometric calibration of the entire plate - collection .    the obvious approach then , is to bypass the characteristic curve altogether and calibrate instrumental magnitudes measured from the plates directly , against a catalog of known magnitudes , via a non - linear fitting function .",
    "previously this method was used with plate - data only for small regions of the sky where accurate magnitudes had been laboriously determined .",
    "however with the advent of all - sky ( or large area ) star catalogs such as the hubble guide star catalog ( gsc ) , sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , all sky automated survey ( asas ) , 2mass and others , reference stars are available everywhere , with a sufficient density to guarantee coverage of any particular plate .",
    "in fact direct calibration via on - plate reference stars is superior to all other methods one could imagine .",
    "provided the reference stars are densely distributed and cover the full range of star brightnesses recorded on the plate , local variations in sensitivity , illumination and point spread function ( psf ) can all be mathematically fitted and corrected for .",
    "the fact that the reference stars lie on the plate means their light has followed exactly the same optical path and development conditions as their neighbors , removing all of the systematics inherent in using separate standard stars .",
    "in particular the effects of atmospheric absorption and atmospheric differential refraction are implicitly included in the calibration curve , provided the calibration star magnitudes are known in the same photometric band as recorded on the plate ; or can be transformed into that band , as we describe below .",
    "following extensive research , the most accurate and complete reference catalog available for the full sky is the gsc2.2 . although itself derived from photographic plates the underlying photometric system of the gsc2.2",
    "is tied to a set of photoelectric magnitude calibrators ( the guide star photometric catalog- gspc ) which were observed for every plate in the poss - ii survey @xcite ( we can not use the gspc because it is very sparse ) .",
    "the gsc2.2 magnitudes are provided for all stars in a blue ( @xmath3 ) pass - band and for nearly all stars a red ( @xmath5 ) pass - band also .",
    "the gsc2.2 covers a large magnitude range @xmath3=1 - 19 with quoted uncertainties of @xmath00.2 mag @xcite and the bright end ( b@xmath610 ) coming from the hipparcos satellite catalog @xcite .",
    "the gsc-@xmath3 magnitude system turns out to be very close to the natural system of the majority of harvard plates , which are primarily unfiltered blue - sensitive plates .",
    "the two gsc pass - bands also enable us to determine the wavelength response of each harvard plate by fitting a color dependent term to the calibration curve .",
    "the first step in our photometry pipeline is to run source extractor @xcite on the astrometrically calibrated digital plate - image .",
    "@xmath2 has many features that make it ideal for our purposes : it is fast , a crucial factor when one considers the software pipeline should eventually keep pace with the scanning : @xmath2 takes 26 minutes for each 750 mb , 380 megapixel image on a single 3ghz cpu depending on the number of stars .",
    "instrumental magnitudes are computed in fixed aperture , isophotal and kron flexible aperture forms .",
    "source radii at specified flux levels are written , providing an analog of the methods used by photometrists during the photographic era .",
    "sky - background is modeled and available for inspection : a useful feature for examining the degree of vignetting and large - scale emulsion defects .",
    "de - blending is performed to account for contamination of magnitudes by neighboring stars .",
    "we run se with a low detection threshold ( 1.5@xmath7 ) in order to be sure of detecting all potentially real objects . due to the grainy nature of photographic emulsion and strong spatial gradients , standard image - noise models",
    "are not appropriate for detection thresholding , so we select the real objects after the fact , using a robustly derived limiting magnitude cut ( described below ) .",
    "the methods in use for ccd photometry all rely on the summation of pixel values belonging to each star . under the assumption of a linear detector the derived flux ( f )",
    "is directly proportional to the actual photon - flux received from the star .",
    "calibration of ccd measurements is therefore is simply a matter of determining the constant of proportionality , which takes the form of a zeropoint - offset ( z ) when the expression is formulated in magnitude units , as eqn  [ eqn : ccdmag ] .",
    "@xmath8    as described in section  [ sect : characteristic_curve ] , photographic magnitudes follow a non - linear calibration curve , the shape of which depends ( in addition to the physical properties discussed in section  [ sect : characteristic_curve ] ) upon the measurement technique . for dasch commissioning purposes we selected 3 methods : fixed aperture , isophotal and image - size . a more sophisticated profile - fitting technique",
    "will likely be implemented in future .",
    "however dealing with the spatially variable and peculiarly shaped psfs found on the plates means that it will be limited to a subset of the data , while our present aim is to utilize as much of the collection as possible .    in fixed aperture photometry , f is the sum of all pixel values lying in a circular aperture centered on the star s center - of - light ( centroid ) .",
    "the functional form of this particular calibration curve has been determined by @xcite , in terms of 4 parameters which are in principle measurable from the image , or may be fitted for .",
    "the bacher function enables very precise calibrations using only a limited number of reference stars , which need not extend much fainter than the magnitude at which there cease to be saturated pixels in the cores of the stars .",
    "unfortunately fixed apertures mean that whatever aperture - size is chosen will only be the optimum choice for a single point along the curve .",
    "apertures which are too large are dominated by sky - noise and stellar crowding , while at the bright end too small an aperture will capture only saturated pixels , leading to a flat ( and therefore useless ) calibration curve .",
    "the most widely used method in the photographic era was measurement of the image diameter through a microscope , fitted with a reticle eyepiece or iris diaphram .",
    "the diameters of standard stars would be measured and compared to those of the program stars .",
    "this was ( and still is , for example @xcite ) performed by eye .",
    "interpolating between closely spaced standard magnitudes , a level of accuracy approaching 0.1 mag is achievable by the best practitioners , although the work is painfully slow and requires a high degree of skill and experience . for comparison purposes we created an analog of this method , by calibrating our reference stars against their image diameters ( in fact image area , to account for the non - roundness and spatial variation of the psf ) , measured at a specified threshold .",
    "a previous example of microscope - measured image - diameters calibrated by on - plate standard stars via a fitting - function is provided by @xcite who used splines to parameterize the curve .",
    "our method is similar but of course the image - diameters are measured by software ( @xmath2 ) rather than micrometer .",
    "isophotal photometry ( iso ) can be thought of as a combination of the preceding methods : a threshold is specified in terms of the local sky background , and all contiguous pixels above this threshold are assigned to the star .",
    "if any contiguous group of pixels has more than one peak , it is de - blended and the pixels assigned to the stars making up the blend .",
    "the instrumental magnitude in then derived from the summation of pixel values belonging to the star .",
    "this technique is implemented in se and was inherited from the previous generation of digitizers such as the supercosmos sky survey @xcite . a complete discussion of dasch crowded field photometry is given by @xcite .    for our sample plates ,",
    "we show the rms distributions resulting from each of the three techniques in figure  [ fig : compare_iso_aper_area ] . in order to calibrate the instrumental magnitudes we need a fitting algorithm : in the case of fixed aperture",
    "there is a known functional form @xcite , but for iso and image - size there appears to be no universal function .",
    "the literature contains many approaches , ranging from polynomials and splines , e.g. @xcite .",
    "a very sophisticated algorithm is described by @xcite for the gsc , derived from photographic plates of the second palomar schmidt survey ( poss - ii ) that attempts to linearize the response by determining the characteristic curve from the star images themselves .",
    "after extensive testing with simple fitting forms , we found that no polynomial model works consistently well .",
    "we therefore turned to interpolation schemes which require no assumed function yet can be very robust against outliers .",
    "after some experimentation with box - car average and kernel density estimator approaches which allow the code to interpolate smoothly across gaps in the calibration sequence , we identified the statistical - analysis function _",
    "@xcite , variants of which are incorporated in several widely used packages including  r \" and matlab .",
    "the algorithm takes a series of x , y points such as the calibration data ( @xmath9 vs instrumental dasch magnitude ) and derives a smooth curve through the points .",
    "the algorithm is robust against outliers , applying an iterative sigma - rejection routine to identify and eliminate bad points from the fit .",
    "the ( tabulated ) value of the _ rlowesss _ curve is then used to convert ( by interpolation from a very finely spaced grid ) the instrumental iso magnitude into a calibrated magnitude in the natural system of the plate .",
    "an example of a typical _ rlowesss _ fit to iso magnitudes is given in figure  [ fig : calibrationcurve ] , illustrating several important features : the quality of fit is seen in the residuals ( lower panel ) , where the residuals are used to define an error envelope in order to attach uncertainties to each measurement .",
    "extrapolation of the fit at the bright end is sometimes required if the plate contains too few bright stars to define a reliable curve .",
    "the limiting magnitude is determined by locating the point at which the scatter ( @xmath7 ) of the fit residuals begins to dominate over the slope of the curve , in practice we chose the point that is 2 @xmath7 ( two times mean std .",
    "deviation of the residuals ) brighter than the faintest instrumental magnitudes returned by se for real stars . due to",
    "the grain inherent in photographic materials , which is often visible at size - scales similar to faint stars , the noise models used internally in se ( and indeed all other ccd photometry routines ) are not strictly applicable and we therefore run the star - detection stage with a very low threshold to be sure of picking up all potentially real objects .",
    "false detections are dropped at the calibration stage , as most are not matched with reference stars and hence get ignored .",
    "remaining false detections are outliers to the calibration curve and are removed by the rlowesss algorithm .",
    "all uncertainties are robustly derived by comparison of the final results against the reference magnitudes , by which we mean the fit residuals define the error distribution .",
    "the calibration curve is derived as a function of radial distance from the optical axis ( physical center ) of the plate .",
    "this enables allowance for the effects of vignetting and radially dependent psf variations .",
    "the different plate series exhibit these effects to varying extents , which are greatest on those with a large plate scale .",
    "vignetting can not be removed by flat - fielding as with ccd images because the plate collection does not contain contemporary flat - field exposures , and the non - linear response precludes using flats constructed from the images themselves .",
    "the design of the telescopes and cameras provided a wide area of full illumination on the plates so that vignetting is only noticeable toward the plate corners and is radially symmetric .",
    "psf distortion is generally minor over most of the plate and tends to be mostly radially ( but not azimuthally ) symmetric .",
    "its effect on photometry is to change the fraction of light from a star that falls within a fixed aperture , such that fluxes tend to be under - estimated as one moves off - axis .",
    "isophotal photometry alleviates the effect somewhat because all pixels above the threshold are included in the flux measurement , regardless of the shape of the profile . using a low threshold",
    "ensures that flux - loss occurs far out in the wings of the profile where it is less significant .",
    "both these effects change the shape of the calibration curve , and also the limiting magnitude , since reduced effective exposure leads to diminished sensitivity .",
    "the combined radial effects on photometry can be seen in figure  [ fig : radialscatterwebda ] which plots the rms distributions of light - curves constructed from measurements located in specific radial bins . for this analysis we used m44 as a probe .",
    "the plates are all centered at different positions on the sky , so the cluster moves around in plate coordinates -enabling one to select points from each star s lightcurve containing only measurements made when it lay within a specific distance of the plate - center . using only the m44 cluster - members meant we could calibrate our dasch magnitudes against the webda catalog ( www.univie.ac.at/webda ) which provides photoelectric magnitudes for 300 stars with errors of @xmath00.02 mag .",
    "this enables very tight calibration , which is important in order to isolate the radial effects .",
    "the example data were drawn from 50 different plates , each one calibrated with a single calibration - curve to the webda stars . due to the small size of m44",
    "the cluster does not span a sufficient range in radial - distance for gradients within the sample to be significant .",
    "figure  [ fig : radialscatterwebda ] clearly demonstrates the effects of spatial variations as the light - curve rms increases systematically with distance from plate - center .",
    "the effect is seen in all plate - series with similar variation in radial plate offsets .    using a sufficiently dense reference star catalog ( e.g. gsc se section 4.1 ) covering the entire plate ,",
    "we construct and then fit the calibration curve in a series of concentric annular regions centered on the optical axis . within each region",
    "the illumination and psf are assumed constant . in addition a rectangular border around the plate ,",
    "defined at 10% of the minor axis is used to flag stars likely to be affected by edge - damage and uneven developer action ( within a few mm of the plate edge , developer can penetrate horizontally into the emulsion , resulting in increased development ) .",
    "following experimentation separately with the number and placement of the annular calibration regions we found that eight concentric equal - area bins are optimum in reducing the rms .",
    "a ninth bin is the outer border ( 10% minor axis ) of the plate .",
    "in addition to vignetting ( dealt with in section  [ sect : annular ] ) , there are sometimes irregularities in the emulsion on scales of @xmath0 2 cm .",
    "such features are evident to the eye and can be more clearly seen in the background maps and source - subtracted images output by se .",
    "a possible origin is insufficient agitation during development and fixing of the plate .",
    "agitation involves rocking the plate or the chemical - tank either by hand or mechanically , in order to continuously redistribute the chemicals and prevent exhausted developer from remaining in contact with the emulsion .",
    "any spatial differences in development result in changes to the characteristic curve , and hence the sensitivity and contrast , while incomplete fixing leads to foggy areas . on wide - field plates , local variations in calibration can also be arise from partial cloud cover during the exposures .    by generating a map of the calibration residuals for each plate ,",
    "we apply a third level of correction to the calibration process to remove irregular spatial variations . a regular grid of 50x50 positions in plate coordinates is defined covering the plate . at each position",
    "the average calibration residual is computed for all stars within a 0.5@xmath10 radius .",
    "the exact statistic is a clipped median ( 3 iterations , removal of 3 sigma outliers ) including only stars brighter than the local limiting magnitude .",
    "the chosen reference catalog ( gsc2.2 ) and sample radius provide @xmath0100 stars per grid - cell in the vicinity of m44 , enabling residual maps to be generated on the required scale .",
    "the grid spacing is chosen to over - sample the spatial variations .",
    "the once the map is generated , each star s magnitude is corrected by the clipped - median - residual of the nearest grid - point . from the above description",
    "it should be clear that the maps are inherently smooth due to the cell - radius being larger than the grid spacing , which ranges from 0.1@xmath10 on mc - plates to 0.5@xmath10 on rh plates .",
    "the physical spacing of the cell centers is 0.2 inches on the 8x10 inch plates .",
    "maps of the calibration residual , its inherent uncertainty , and number of points per cell are shown in figure  [ fig : localmaps ] , which also includes a map of the final residuals , following correction .",
    "it can be seen that the annular calibration described in section  [ sect : annular ] has removed all trace of vignetting , and the local calibration then drives the remaining spatial variations down by about 50% .",
    "an analysis of light - curves generated from this photometry ( see figure  [ fig : compareannularlocalrms ] ) shows the same level of improvement , demonstrating that spatial variations are handled effectively by the dasch pipeline .",
    "certain plate defects can be difficult to completely correct for , but fortunately only a small fraction of stars are affected .",
    "examples include emulsion irregularities , dirt and optical distortions .",
    "fortunately these effects tend to be concentrated in the outer edges of the plates , which are most susceptible to handling , and lay furthest from the optical axis ( relevant to distortion ) of the telescope . in our photometric pipeline",
    "we flag stars for the following factors : distance from plate center , proximity to plate edge , quality of _ rlowess _ calibration - curve fit , quality of local - map correction ( @xmath7 and number of local reference stars used ) , local limiting - magnitude , se flags ( blend , neighbor - contamination ) , existence of known near - neighbors .",
    "all of these conditions are evaluated on a plate - by - plate and star - by - star basis , enabling very specific filtering of the dasch database to investigate systematic effects and to include / exclude data - points for scientific analysis .",
    "further advances in filtering will be described in paper iii . in this paper",
    "most numerical results include only data - points meeting our default quality thresholds : 1 ) star not within 10% minor - axis distance of plate - edge .",
    "2)total rms of calibration - curve residuals less than 1 mag .",
    "3 ) magnitude brighter than 2@xmath7 limiting magnitude for relevant annular bin .",
    "4 ) plates without multiple exposures , gratings , prisms , filters . generally in plots all points are shown , where possible smaller plot - symbols indicate flagged points .",
    "the majority of the harvard plate collection are blue sensitive , unfiltered plates .",
    "a small fraction used filters to produce red and yellow sensitive measurements although details of the wavelength response of the various emulsions are not available . in order to generate consistent and precise magnitudes for temporal analysis",
    "it is essential that changes in color - response from one plate to another be well understood , otherwise small brightness variations could be masked ( or mimicked ) by calibration shifts .",
    "any given plate will yield magnitudes on a unique `` natural system '' defined by the combined wavelength - dependent transmission properties of the atmosphere , telescope and camera optics , and the emulsion response .",
    "fortunately all of this can be reduced to a single co - effficient : the color - term @xmath11 , which appears in equation  [ eqn : color ] relating magnitudes on the standard system , @xmath12 , to the plate s system @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 are two standard pass - bands close to @xmath13 .",
    "this simple form assumes that a given star s incident spectrum is approximately linear over the effective bandpass of the system , and can therefore be completely described by the photometric color index ( @xmath14@xmath15 ) . since real stars",
    "have spectra of differing shapes , the chosen standard passbands should ideally bracket @xmath13 in effective wavelength .",
    "this discussion is equally applicable to ccd photometry and explains why the best results are obtained when standard stars are chosen to be of similar color to program stars .",
    "@xmath16    for every digitized plate then , the first task is to measure how its natural magnitude system compares to the standard one , by determining @xmath11 .",
    "our procedure was to step through a series of closely spaced @xmath11 values . for each trial value",
    "we converted the reference stars magnitudes according to equation  [ eqn : color ] and then fitted the instrumental plate - magnitudes against @xmath17 .",
    "for example when using reference stars from the gsc2 catalog , @xmath18 and @xmath19 are johnson @xmath3 and @xmath5 magnitudes respectively , and we have equation  [ eqn : color2 ] .",
    "when the correct color term is applied , the scatter of residuals ( std deviation of @xmath20 computed for every star ) about the calibration curve reaches a minimum , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : colortermfit ] .",
    "@xmath21    the color term for each plate is determined using a region near the center where the calibration curve is most cleanly defined .",
    "color response may vary slightly across a plate due to differential airmass , which would be most pronounced on wide - field plates .",
    "the effect is dealt with in paper iii @xcite . during this commissioning project",
    "we analyzed @xmath0500 mostly blue plates from 6 different plate series , spanning 100 years , purposely including a few yellow and red filtered plates .",
    "reference stars were drawn from the gsc2.2 which provides b and r magnitudes accurate to @xmath00.2mag . for a more precise comparison analysis over a small area centered on m44",
    ", we used the webda ( www.univie.ac.at/webda ) catalog which provides precise ( 0.01 ) magnitudes in b & v for about 300 m44 cluster members .",
    "the results of the color analysis show systematic differences in @xmath11 between the different blue - sensitive plate series , at the level of about 0.1 mag .",
    "this translates to an order of magnitude smaller systematic shifts between the natural magnitude systems , since the majority of m44 cluster members have ( b - v ) colors less than 0.5 mag , resulting in typical @xmath22m@xmath00.05 .",
    "these results are displayed in figures  [ fig : colorbyseries ] showing how the color - terms are distributed according to plate series .",
    "it was initially expected that early plates might be significantly bluer as panchromatic emulsions became widely available only in the 1900s , and that different batches might exhibit different color - sensitivities , not to mention the largely unknown issue of filters .",
    "it comes therefore as a surprise that histograms of the number of plates versus @xmath11 ( figure  [ fig : colorbyseries ] ) show only small differences between plate series .",
    "the width of each histogram is of order 0.1 mag , which is comparable to the differences between their modes .",
    "the small shifts are real however and the rh histogram shows an intriguing ` shoulder ' which upon closer examination is due to a change in color - response in 1932 .",
    "lightcurves are the ultimate purpose of dasch and also provide an independent way to verify the quality of the astrometry , photometry and metadata .",
    "the photometric calibration pipeline described above produces a catalog of stellar magnitudes and positions over time . to generate the light - curve of a given star ,",
    "its brightness history as recorded in the set of plate - catalogs is ordered against observation time as recorded in the original logbooks .",
    "the information held in the logbooks consists of a one - line handwritten entry for each plate , noting the date and time of observation , exposure time , ra & dec of the plate center , hour angle ( ha ) , plus comments on any filters , prisms or gratings used , weather conditions and so on . from 1880 until 1953 the start and",
    "stop time of every exposure was recorded in local sidereal time , after which a mixture of local time ( e.g. est ) and ut was used .",
    "prior to 1925 dates were recorded as local calendar date at the beginning of the night . from 1925 - 1953 two local dates",
    "are given , corresponding to the start and end of the night . in order to use the logbook records ,",
    "they were digitally photographed and the images transcribed by a data entry company . finally the meta - data files were converted to a common system ; the modified julian date ( mjd ) by software designed to determine the time system in use , and to which date the sidereal or ut time - stamp belonged .",
    "this is a fairly complex problem because the observations were made at several different latitudes , and finding the correct date requires calculation of the sidereal time of local midnight . in principle the values of time , ra / dec and ha should all agree , so the software makes a comparison and if a conflict exists , ` votes ' the most probable solution and flags the entry for human investigation .",
    "for the purposes of temporal analysis it is more useful to compute the heliocentric julian date ( hjd ) , which corrects times to an imaginary clock located at the solar - system barycenter .",
    "this is required to correct for a shift in photon arrival time of up - to @xmath238 minutes , which would be a significant source of error in the study of short period phenomena such as compact eclipsing binaries .",
    "light - curves for every resolved gsc2.2 star brighter than b=17 in the region of sky covered by the m44 plates were extracted using a highly optimized piece of software based on the _ starbase _ package ( a command - line driven relational - database for astronomy : http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/  john / starbase / starbase.html ) .",
    "the code relies on pre - sorting and indexing the photometry catalogs ; each one is read only once by the search tool , which identifies all target stars that lie on the plate and takes advantage of the index to rapidly locate them ( without having to examine every entry ) . if an expected target star is not found in a particular plate - catalog , then the local limiting magnitude for its position is returned , to be treated as an upper limit .",
    "execution time for 500 plates each containing an average of 42,000 stars , is @xmath01 second per light - curve , for a single - cpu - thread .",
    "further optimizations are described in paper iii which enable rapid processing of thousands of plates .",
    "careful examination of the outliers in our photometric calibration - curves revealed three classes of astronomical object : variable stars , galaxies and blends .",
    "of these , variable stars obviously do not fall on the calibration curve unless they happen by chance to be at their catalog brightness on a particular plate .",
    "galaxies do not conform because of their non - stellar profiles , the calibrations for aperture and image - size magnitudes do not apply to extended objects .",
    "isophotal and kron ( flexible aperture ) magnitudes formally apply to any object , however changes in image - scale and photometric depth cause the galaxy magnitudes derived from different plates to disagree with one another . in deeper images more of the galaxy gets above the detection threshold , and hence the isophotal area expands and observed flux increases .",
    "blended stars and those with near neighbors can yield unreliable magnitudes that may mimic real variables as seeing , plate - scale and depth change between plates . happily there are existing all - sky catalogs ( e.g gsc2.2 ) that go deeper than most of the harvard plates and are largely complete down to our typical limiting magnitudes .",
    "prior knowledge of positions and magnitudes enable one to predict which stars will suffer from neighbor effects in a given plate .",
    "we can take advantage of the hundreds of independent measurements of each star to average - out systematic and statistical errors . in this way for non - variable stars dasch",
    "has the potential to create an all - sky photometric catalog .",
    "for variable stars the median brightness will be more representative than that measured at a single instant , and the variability amplitude will be known . among the applications of such a catalog",
    "are an improved gsc for observatory and spacecraft operations , as well as a list of standard stars for general calibration use .",
    "it has been recently discovered that a significant fraction ( 5% ) of the standards in current use are in fact long - term variables @xcite , dasch will define a large set of constant stars proven to be good standards over our hundred year baseline .    for the dasch commissioning project we computed the median magnitudes for 75,000 gsc2.2 stars within 10@xmath24 of m44 in order to refine our own calibrations .",
    "median magnitudes were computed using only good measurements ( flag specifications given in section  [ sect : flags ] ) , for stars having at least 10 such points in their lightcurve . as a benchmark we compared the dasch ( median ) and gsc2.2 magnitudes against webda photoelectric b magnitudes which have a precision of order 0.01mag .",
    "the overall rms of @xmath25 is 0.08 compared to a much larger value of 0.22 for @xmath26 , in both cases after removing obvious outliers , this result is shown in figure  [ fig : dasch_vs_gsc ] .",
    "a large improvement in plate - calibration is possible by using the dasch median - magnitudes in place of gsc2.2 to refine the individual curves , as demonstrated in figure  [ fig : dasch_vs_gsc ] .",
    "two improvements are evident : firstly the scatter of points about the _ rlowess _ fit is dramatically tightened ; secondly the large - amplitude outliers are almost completely removed .",
    "it is clear therefore that iterating our calibration pipeline leads to impressive gains in both consistency and absolute precision .",
    "further development along these lines is presented in paper iii .",
    "many variable stars are known within a few degrees of the well - known open cluster m44 , including dwarf novae ( dne ) , eclipsing binaries , and various classes of pulsating stars .",
    "the examples in this section are intended to demonstrate the value of dasch in a range of applications . in figures  [ fig : constantstar ]  [ fig : cqcncfold ] the star s magnitude is plotted against time ( upper panel ) and chronological plate sequence ( middle panel ) .",
    "large solid circles denote good data points , while open circles indicate a larger than usual scatter in the calibration for that point .",
    "arrows denote upper limits derived for plates which did not go deep enough to detect the star .",
    "smaller versions of these symbols denote observations where the star was very close to the plate - edge .",
    "two versions of each lightcurve are shown : black points denote a calibration that accounts for radially - dependent effects such as vignetting , while the red points incorporate an additional step correcting for irregular spatial variations in plate sensitivity .",
    "the bottom panel shows for each measurement how far the star was from the plate - center ( points ) and how many local calibrators were used ( red line ) .",
    "the first example is a star that does not appear to vary .",
    "such constant - brightness stars enable sensitive determination of various systematic effects and provide a completely independent measure of uncertainties . in figure",
    "[ fig : constantstar ] is the lightcurve of such a star demonstrating about + /-0.1mag photometry from 400 plates , that span 100 years and 6 different plate - series .",
    "comparing the rms for the black ( 0.154 mag ) and red ( 0.105 mag ) set of points , the effect of correcting the irregular plate - variations gives about a 50% improvement over radial - correction alone .",
    "+ _ the eclipsing binary ry cancri . _",

    "[ fig : rycnc ] one can see a scattering of faint points below the rest , which correspond to eclipses of the primary star by its fainter companion .",
    "the eclipses are very narrow as is typical for compact binaries .",
    "the lightcurve of ry cancri is show folded in figure  [ fig : rycncfold ] , at its known binary period of 1.092943 days , to show the eclipse .",
    "the magnitudes plotted are corrected for spatial variations in the different plates ( the red points in previous plot ) , and the symbols are as described above .",
    "the light - curve is plotted over two cycles , the first cycle shows estimated error bars for each point . + _",

    "u cancri is not visible on some of our plates , as can be seen from the upper limits ( arrow symbols ) .",
    "because the star s pulsations are not perfectly regular , when we fold the lightcurve the points from different cycles do nt line up exactly .",
    "at least 2 distinct rising portions are visible in figure  [ fig : ucncfold ] beginning at phase 0.5 .",
    "we were able measure a period of 304 days from the dasch light - curve using the lomb - scargle periodogram .",
    "+ _ u geminorum , a cv .",
    "_ u gem is a famous cataclysmc variable ( cv ) that shows regular dwarf nova outbursts .",
