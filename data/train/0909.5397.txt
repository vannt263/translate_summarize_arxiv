    "one may distinguish different possibilities for encoding a qubit in a trapped ion , either one uses a long lived metastable state and drives coherent transitions on the corresponding optical transition @xcite , which sets challenging requirements on the laser source and ultimately limits the coherence time to the lifetime of the metastable state .",
    "alternatively , a qubit can be encoded in sublevels of the electronic ground state .",
    "this may be either hyperfine ground state levels @xcite or zeeman ground states @xcite which are coherently manipulated by means of stimulated raman transitions . for conventional single - ion qubits encoded in the zeeman sublevels as in @xmath0ca@xmath1",

    "ground states @xmath5 and @xmath6 do not perform any bit flip errors . magnetic field or laser phase fluctuation",
    "would lead to errors for a single ion , but in the chosen bell states such fluctuations are identical for both ions in the logical qubit .",
    "this assures that such states can maintain coherent of up to 20  s and single qubit operations in dfs , have been demonstrated @xcite .",
    "a universal set of single and two qubit operations between logical qubits has been proposed @xcite and recently performed with a fidelity of @xmath7 @xcite , and it would be desirable to reach a fidelity of better than 99@xmath8 also for dfs gates .        in this paper we show how these two - qubit gate operations could be improved by a novel scheme , which do not require individual ion addressing .",
    "the single ion addressing was identified as one of the major difficulties and one of the main source of loss in fidelity in the experiment .",
    "our scheme is based on _ homogeneous _ illumination of the four ions .",
    "additionally , our proposed gate operates in a raman type of laser excitation between ground state dfs logic qubits , an additional promising a fidelity improvement as compared with the metastable , thus 1.2  s long lived basis states in ref .",
    "we carefully investigated all contributions to the spin - dependent light force @xcite , and optimized the scheme .",
    "furthermore , we generalize the scheme for a scalable approach of quantum computing , fig.[fig1 ] . with gate times of about 25 @xmath2s , more that 5 orders of magnitude faster the decoherence time , the required overhead to handle two ions for one qubit appears to be relatively small .",
    "even more important , such favorable separation of time scales would pave the way to realize quantum error correction @xcite .",

    "in contrast to the center - of - mass mode , the higher energy vibrational modes are less sensitive to the heating due to fluctuating ambient electric field because it requires short - wavelength components of the field to heat it @xcite . the laser is detuned from the s@xmath19 @xmath20p@xmath19 transition with large detuning @xmath21 and couples only the vibrational levels for each of the spin states according to fig .",

    "are zero , hence the off - resonant excitations of this mode do not take place . during the time evolution the motional state moves along a circular path in phase space and returns to the origin after time @xmath67 , while the spin states acquire geometric phases @xmath68 . in this case",
    "the force displaces the ions if the spins of the middle two ions are aligned in the same direction and cancel if the spins are opposite , fig .",

    "the phase is proportional to the laser intensity thereby it is making the gate implementation very sensitive to laser - intensity fluctuations .",

    "the effect of slightly inhomogeneous illumination of the ions - accounting for the experimental reality - and the implication of the gate fidelity will be discussed in section [ 4 ]",
    "in general , two approaches for scalable quantum computing with ion string are viable .",
    "the one aims for a long ion crystal , where all ions share common modes of vibration which allow to drive gate operations between them . the seminal paper by cirac and zoller @xcite proposed axial modes and more recently it has been proposed to use the radial modes of a large ion crystal @xcite .",
    "the fundamentally different approach aims to shuttle ions in segmented traps @xcite , such that only two logical qubits are in the processor region during the quantum gate operation .",

    "a large separation of time scales for a gate with about 100 ms transport operations are viable in the ms range @xcite , as well as a obtaining error syndromes if one aims for quantum error correction , where the readout of fluorescence is necessary . in order to implement a multi qubit controlled phase gate we can decompose it in a sequence of single qubit gates and geometric phase gates between the logical qubits @xcite .",
    "the single logical qubits ( pair of ions ) can be trapped in the storage zone and then can be transported to the processing zone where the gate operations are performed , fig .",
    "for instance , a three bit decoherence - free geometric gate is decomposed as @xmath79 . here",
    "@xmath80 is the toffoli gate between the first two control logical qubits and the auxillary logical qubit which is prepared initially in the state @xmath81 .",

    "the toffoli gate also can be decomposed as a succession of hadamard gates and geometric phase gates between the logical qubits .",
    "therefore any of the gate operations is realized with two ions ( single qubit operations ) and with four ions ( two qubit operations ) where the proposed method can be applied .",
    "the generalization to n - bit geometric phase gate is straightforward : @xmath83 .    as an example",
    "we describe the method for the generation of a linear cluster state .",

    "additionally , the proposed gate scheme shows a remarkable robustness against laser intensity fluctuations .",
    "as both laser beams are derived from the same laser source , we assume that the intensity fluctuations are common .",
    "the corresponding rabi frequencies fluctuate therefore simultaneously for all ions . as a result",
    ", we observe that the fidelity only decrease quadratically with the fluctuations , see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] .",
    "the ac stark shift from the raman beams can be compensated by a proper choice of polarizations of both beam or by employing an additional compensation beam @xcite .",
    "the precision of this compensation is only limited by the spin coherence time , in a typical experiment one might reach an accuracy @xmath119 well below 1  khz .",
    "such shifts scramble the spin qubit phases as they translate laser intensity fluctuations into effective magnetic field fluctuations . however , the logical qubits are inherently robust against spin phase fluctuations .",
    "errors might only occur when the when an uncompensated ac stark shift is accompanied by an inhomogeneous illumination of two ions which comprise a logical qubit . as this error of higher order , with a fraction of the above number",
    ", we do not take it into further consideration . in a fusing process of three logical qubits for the scalable scheme discussed above , when in the first step two of the qubits are exposed to the gate laser field while the third qubit is not illuminated , even an uncompensated ac stark shift would not lead to errors as long as the logical qubits are illuminated equally .    finally , the coherence of qubits in dfs is limited by the fluctuations of the gradient of the magnetic field over the distance of the two ion crystal , a few @xmath2 m .",
    "when transporting such logical qubits in the trap one may expose them to varying magnetic gradients , however the phase evolution of the logical qubits is deterministic @xcite and can be easily corrected for .",
    "the motional decoherence of the vibrational motion of the trapped ions is the most serious limiting factor in ion trap quantum information processing . in order to achieve high fidelity",
    "the gate time @xmath69 required for the implementation of dfs gate ( [ gate ] ) must be much shorter than the heating time @xmath120 .",
    "the measured heating time of the center of mass mode for @xmath0ca@xmath1 ion in a segmented micro - ion traps @xcite was found to be 3.3 ms , a typical value for this devices .",
    "the heating time for higher energy modes is expected to be much larger .",
    "hence the gate time is more than two orders of magnitude faster than the heating time such that the fidelity of the gate is not affected .",
    "in conclusion we proposed a simple and robust technique for a decoherence - free controlled phase gate between two logical qubits .",
    "we studied in detail the fidelity of the gate implementation taking into account various error sources such as off - resonant transitions , laser fluctuations , and the deviation of the right choice of the axial trap frequency .",
    "we have compared the error sources for a gate mediated by three different modes , and we have shown that the gate mediated by the egyptian mode minimizes the off - resonant transitions .",
    "our scheme includes the creation of a linear cluster state within a decoherence free subspace manifold of four qubits - a starting point for decoherence - free ion trap one way quantum computing .",
