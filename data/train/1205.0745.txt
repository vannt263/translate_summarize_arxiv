    "the interaction of electrons with local vibrations ( phonons ) has an important impact on the conduction properties and stability of molecular conductors@xcite and has undergone intense study both experimentally and theoretically@xcite . in the low bias regime where the voltage is comparable to phonon excitation energies ,",
    "valuable information about the molecular conductor can be deduced from the signature of electron - phonon interaction , known as inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy ( iets ) , or point contact spectroscopy ( pcs)@xcite . theoretically , this regime has been addressed with some success using mean - field theory such as density functional theory@xcite , where the vibrations are assumed to be uncoupled to the electrons , while the effect of the phonons on the electronic transport is taken into account using perturbation theory . on the other hand , for higher voltage bias , and for highly transmitting systems , a large electronic current may strongly influence the behavior of the phonons even for relatively weak electron - phonon coupling .",
    "the resultant `` joule heating '' is well - known in the molecular electronics context@xcite , and remains a lively area with a range of approaches ( and with occasional lack of complete agreement between treatments @xcite ) .",
    "more recently the current - induced wind - force known from electromigration@xcite has been reexamined for atomic - scale conductors and shown also to be able to excite the conductor and possibly lead to a runaway instability@xcite .",
    "it has been shown how a part of the force on an atom in the presence of the current may have a non - conservative ( nc ) component , able to do net work around closed paths .",
    "this was explicitly proven by calculating the curl of the vector field describing the force on an atom@xcite .",
    "the nc energy transfer - also dubbed the atomic `` waterwheel '' effect - requires a generalized circular motion of the atoms and involves the coupling of the electronic current to more than one vibrational mode .",
    "along with the nc force contribution we have recently identified a velocity - dependent current - induced force which conserves energy and acts as a lorentz - like force on the generalized circular motion .",
    "this force can be traced back to the quantum mechanical berry - phase ( bp ) of the electrons@xcite .",
    "together with the nc force we will , further , have a component which is curl - free and is related to the change in the effective potential energy surface of the atoms due to the current@xcite , as well as nonadiabatic `` electronic friction '' forces@xcite . in the nonequilibrium situation",
    "the `` friction '' force can , however , turn into a driving force amplifying the vibration .",
    "this happens under certain resonance conditions akin to a laser effect , but now involving phonons instead of photons@xcite .",
    "a unified approach including all aforementioned effects on an equal footing is highly desirable for further study in this direction . in this paper , we extend the electronic friction approach proposed by head - gordon and tully@xcite for molecular dynamics to take into account the nonequilibrium nature of the electronic current@xcite .",
    "a similar approach has been taken to describe models of nano - electro - mechanical systems ( nems)@xcite . using the feynman - vernon influence functional approach , we derive a semi - classical langevin equation for the ions , which we can use to study joule heating , current - induced forces , and heat transport in molecular conductors .",
    "we perform a perturbation expansion of the electron effective action over the electron - phonon interaction matrix .",
    "this allows us to make connections with other theoretical approaches , especially the nonequilibrium green s function ( negf ) method , used to study the joule heating problem@xcite .",
    "we also give an extension of the perturbation result to the adiabatic limit , which makes connections with our previous results , and solves an infrared divergence problem in the expression of the bp force in ref .  .",
    "we apply the theory to a two - level model in order to ( 1 ) clarify the roles played by different forces regarding the stability of the device , and ( 2 ) discuss the signature of the current - induced excitation in the raman - scattering especially focussing on conditions close to a current - induced runaway instability .",

    "[ sec : raman ] , we present ways of calculating the quantum displacement correlations , which is essential for the theoretical description of raman spectroscopy in the presence of current .",
    "section  [ sec : conc ] gives concluding remarks .",
    "we start from the influence functional theory of feynman and vernon @xcite , which treats the dynamics of a `` system '' in contact with a `` bath '' or `` reservoir '' . in our case",
    "the system of interest consists of the few degrees of freedom describing the ions of a molecular conductor , interacting with the electronic reservoir composed of all electronic degrees of freedom in the molecule and electrodes , as well as the phonon reservoirs of two electrodes .",
    "the reservoirs can be out of equilibrium generating an electronic current , and may , further , involve a temperature difference generating a heat flux between the electrodes .",
    "all effects of the bath are included in the so - called influence functional , which gives an additional effective action , modifying that of the isolated system .",
    "now we briefly review the idea of the influence functional approach . with the help of the influence functional , @xmath0 , the reduced density matrix of the system in the displacement representation reads , @xmath1 with the propagator of the reduced density matrix @xmath2f(x , y).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath3 and @xmath4 are a pair of displacement histories of the ions , and @xmath5 is the action of the system only . in deriving this , we have assumed that the system and bath are uncorrelated at @xmath6 , @xmath7 the influence functional includes the information of the bath @xmath8 and its interaction with the system @xmath9 , @xmath10\\nonumber\\\\ & & \\times\\langle r_1|\\rho_{b}(t_1)|q_1\\rangle.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath11 and @xmath12 representing forward and backward paths of the bath degrees of freedom .",
    "most importantly , a correction to the action of the system can be defined from the influence functional @xmath13 , which is usually not time - local or real .",
    "it has been used to derive a semiclassical langevin equation , describing the dynamics of the system interacting with the environment@xcite . in this case new variables are introduced , @xmath14 describing the average and difference of the two paths , respectively . in the semi - classical approach the average path , @xmath15 ,",
    "is shown to yield the variable in the langevin equation , whereas role of the difference , @xmath16 , is to introduce fluctuating random forces in a statistical interpretation .",
    "the influence of the environment will favor paths with small excursions given by @xmath16 , and will ensure that only the solution , @xmath15 , obeying the classical path will contribute for a high temperature reservoir .",
    "we illustrate this further below .",
    "next , we introduce our model and give the result for the influence functional describing the nonequilibrium electron bath . from the effective action",
    ", we can read out the forces acting on the ions due to the electrons .",
    "we also discuss how a thermal flux may be included .",
    "parts of the derivations can be found in our previous publications@xcite , but here we aim at a more general formulation , which we present with detailed derivations together with an illustrative model calculation .",
    "however we note that the theory is fully compatible with more realistic systems with complex electronic and vibrational structure treated within a mean - field approach such as density functional theory .      to obtain an effective action describing the vibrations ( phonons ) in the molecular conductor we first divide the complete system into electron and phonon subsystems .",
    "we will treat electron - electron interactions at the mean - field level . to describe the nonequilibrium situation where a current is flowing through the molecular conductor between two reservoirs",
    ", the electron subsystem is further divided into a cental part ( @xmath17 ) and two electrodes ( @xmath18 ) , whose electrochemical potentials change with applied bias . for the purposes of the present study , we allow electrons to interact with phonons in @xmath17 only , and furthermore ignore the anharmonic coupling between these different modes .",
