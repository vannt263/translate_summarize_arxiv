    "a foam can be represented as a space - filling cellular network , a tessellation , usually random . in 3d ,",
    "the cells are bounded by interfaces connected three by three on edges that meet four by four on vertices . in 2d ,",
    "the cells are bounded by edges that meet three by three on vertices .",
    "this generic description holds unless the meeting point has been especially adjusted .",
    "the foam has a topological dual in which a vertex is associated with each cell and an edge joining two vertices traverses the interface between two cells .",
    "generically , the cells in the dual are simplices , triangles in 2d and tetrahedra in 3d .",
    "it is often assumed that the elements of the foam are physical elements , i.e the cells are closed bubbles filled by a discontinuous gas phase and the space between them ( the interface ) is filled by the continuous liquid phase .",
    "edges and vertices , called plateau borders are distinct in dry foams @xcite . in phyllotaxis , the interfaces between florets are not physical entities . nevertheless , topological defects such as dislocations and grain boundaries are defined precisely and their evolution under stress can be followed .    this representation of the foam as a space - filling cellular complex simplifies greatly the description of its deformation and of its evolution .",
    "the foam is in quasi - static , statistical equilibrium @xcite , punctuated by elementary , local topological transformations involving an _ interface_. as shown on the figure [ fg1 ] , the flip of an interface ( usually called @xmath1 transformation ) produces a switch of neighbor cells .",
    "the disappearance of an interface ( a coalescence event ) leads to the disappearance of one of the two cells that it separates ( called @xmath0 process , although @xmath0 is an elementary transformation for three - sided cells only @xcite ) .",
    "these transformations introduce topological defects , notably dislocations , with specific and dramatic effects on the properties of the material , not least on its mechanical resistance or plasticity @xcite .",
    "topological defects can be described for two dimensional foams ( a packing of polygonal cells ) or three dimensional foams .",
    "dislocations have to be referred to a perfect structure which for 2d foams is generally a hexagonal structure @xcite . in three dimensional structures",
    "the reference order is not so simple to define and @xmath1 transformations are not unique . in this paper",
    "we are more concerned by 2d foams , even if some points can be generalized .",
    "then , on a hexagonal reference order , dislocations are dipoles formed by a pentagonal and a heptagonal cell .",
    "a @xmath1 transformation in a hexagonal structure generates a quadrupole of two such dipoles .",
    "an array of dislocations constitutes a grain boundary , with its own , remarkable dynamics .",
    "grain boundaries are easily seen in the bubble rafts of bragg and nye @xcite , separating crystalline hexagonal grains of different orientations .",
    "we shall see that grain boundaries occur in phyllotaxis ( fig.[fg2 ] ) where they play an essential part in the growth of the structure .",
    "the representation of a foam as a space - filling cellular network is a simplification of the complex , biphasic material where an interface is a concrete physical object ( the continuous fluid phase ) .",
    "but it is also a natural extension when the interfaces have no concrete existence per se , as in granular packings or in phyllotaxis where the constituents are individual grains or florets packed together .",
    "phyllotaxis ( leaf arrangement in botanics - e.g. fig.[fg2 ] ) is a space - filling structure with specific symmetries different from the translation invariance of a crystal , the inflation - deflation symmetry of a quasicrystal and the global uniformity of a random foam . like a crystal",
    ", it is based on a lattice , but it is a spiral lattice , and the structure is encoded as a one - dimensional sequence of all the cells in the pattern .",
    "like any foam , phyllotaxis is structured into layers @xcite .",
    "phyllotaxis describes the arrangement of florets , scales or leaves in composite flowers or plants ( daisy , aster , sunflower , pine cone , pineapple ) .",
    "geometrically , it is a foam ( albeit ordered and organized ) , the most homogeneous and densest covering of a large disk by voronoi cells ( the florets ) @xcite .",
    "the voronoi cell ( or dirichlet domain ) associated with a point is defined as the region of space nearer to it than to any other point in the set .",
    "points placed regularly on a generative spiral constitute a spiral lattice , and phyllotaxis is the tiling by the voronoi cells of the spiral lattice . the number of points on the generative spiral increases as the flower grows .",
    "first , one constructs on a surface of constant gauss curvature ( plane , sphere , cone , cylinder ) a spiral lattice defined by a parametric equation ( with a parameter @xmath2 ) for a generative spiral .",
    "discrete points , dual of cells , are set regularly at integer values of @xmath3 .",
    "changing the curvature can have a real meaning , as for pine cones or pineapples where the physical substrate is not planar , but it can also be a way of taking into account local changes in the sizes of the cells , such as larger florets on the periphery of sunflowers .    then , one associates to each point a voronoi cell or tile ( dirichlet region ) @xcite .",
    "the position of each point @xmath2 is given by its polar coordinates @xmath4 for example , on the plane @xmath5 ( here , fermat s spiral @xmath6 is the generative spiral ) and the azimuthal angle between two successive points on the spiral is @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the golden ratio .",
    "we take this azimuthal law as part of the model leading to the lowest anisotropy of the cells and to the densest packing under these conditions .",
    "( a hexagonal structure is the densest 2d packing solution for an infinite crystal or for finite crystals with fitting boundaries .",
    "phyllotaxis is the densest packing for circular boundaries or issued from an isotropic seed .",
    "as the structure grows by increasing the number of points on the generative spiral , the boundary remains close to circular .",
    "this optimal compactness explains why we have used phyllotaxis as a model for a 2d foam confined inside a circular boundary @xcite .",
    "the phyllotactic structure is also hyperuniform @xcite : although ordered , it is under steady strain through growth , but remains invariant under the elementary , local topological transformations ( @xmath1 and @xmath0 ) that the strain induces . )    the phyllotactic pattern of a set of 3000 points on a plane with their voronoi cells is shown in figure  [ fg2 ] .",
    "the structure is defined by the generative spiral which is not visible : the cells corresponding to successive points @xmath3 on the generative spiral are not neighbors .",
    "but the pattern does exhibit visible spirals of nearest neighbor cells . through every hexagonal cell",
    "there are three such spirals , called by botanists `` parastichies '' : the neighbors after @xmath9 turns of the generative spiral . here , the @xmath10 s are successive fibonacci numbers ( @xmath11 with @xmath12 and @xmath13 ) and @xmath14 are rational approximants to @xmath15 .",
    "] to cell @xmath2 are @xmath16 .",
    "the parastichies split up or merge on the non - hexagonal cells which are concentrated on thin rings of defects . on the defect rings , the two parastichies that continue from one grain to the next are orthogonal and the cells are truncated rectangles @xcite .",
    "the defects are pentagon - heptagon dipoles acting as dislocations , gathered into grain boundaries .",
    "the grain boundaries are the thin rings separating the grains , thicker annuli of hexagonal cells .",
    "each dislocation introduces a new parastichy to maintain the density of points or cells as constant as possible .",
    "the underlying arithmetic of this concentric organization @xcite is that of fibonacci numbers . it can be summarized as a sequence @xmath17 of cell types \\{hexagon , pentagon , heptagon } along the generative spiral , that is an encoding of the structure to be discussed below .",
    ", the sequence @xmath17 of cell types is @xmath18 $ ] , with the point corresponding to cell @xmath19 at the origin of the generative spiral .",
    "the numbering of the successive cells along the generative spiral @xmath20 is given explicitly in fig.[exfig9 ] ( see appendix 2 ) .",
    "parastichy @xmath21 begins already at cell @xmath22 .",
    "the innermost grain boundary @xmath23 $ ] has 21 cells @xmath24 .",
    "the core can be cleared up by starting the numbering from @xmath25 ( eliminating cell @xmath19 by removing the boundary @xmath26 ) and making two neighbor flips to remove the @xmath21 parastichy from cells @xmath27 .",

    "details in fig.[newfig ] . ]",
    "incidentally , the terminology `` spiral lattice '' is well - chosen since the parastichies play the role of reticular lines in a classical 2d lattice .",
    "we call _ core _ the open disk of cells inside the innermost ring of defects .",
    "phyllotaxis can be viewed as a succession of bent hexagonal grains connected by grain boundaries , outside an inner core .",
    "bending is a shear stress that can be related to the curvature of the substrate . on the plane , using a fermat spiral as generative spiral with a radial law demanding equi - sized cells , the foam is subjected to a ( poisson ) shear stress , i.e. compressed radially and expanded azimuthally . by contrast , a hexagonal crystal wrapped with chirality on a cylinder has no shear stress .",
    "this wrapped hexagonal crystal can be conformally mapped on a plane to yield a phyllotaxis that is a conformal ( single ) crystal with only hexagonal cells ( outside a central core ) and zero shear strain @xcite .",
    "the sizes of the florets increase radially outwards and the generative spiral is the equiangular spiral @xmath30 ( bernoulli ) .",
    "the curvature of the substrate , the nature of the generative spiral and the sizes of the cells are therefore intertwined properties of the phyllotactic structure .",

    "let point @xmath19 be the south pole using @xmath48 .",
    "] is obtained by the mapping of points on a finite cylinder tangent at the equator to the sphere with the same radius @xmath49 and height @xmath50 .",
    "the finite cylinder and the sphere have the same area @xmath51 .",
    "points on the cylinder are located on a regular helix defined by @xmath52 and a constant pitch @xmath53 related to the number of points on the sphere .",
    "they constitute a perfect lattice without defects wrapped on the cylinder , with a constant density of points .",
    "generically , a point @xmath2 has six neighbors at positions @xmath54 with the @xmath55 equal to three successive fibonacci numbers depending on the pitch of the helix drawn on the cylinder . the voronoi cells",
    "are then all hexagons with equal area . for particular values of the pitch , the voronoi cells are squares and the tessellation by squares has non - generic four - corner boundaries with degree @xmath56 ( the critical point of a @xmath1 transformation ) @xcite,@xcite .",
    "the points on the cylinder are mapped on the sphere orthogonally to the polar axis so that the area per point on the sphere is the same as on the cylinder ( the area of a zone between two parallel planes is the same on a sphere of radius @xmath49 and on the tangent cylinder orthogonal to the planes ) .",
    "but such a projection on the sphere , even if it conserves the area of the voronoi cells and the pitch of the helix , introduces inhomogeneous shear in the structure .",
    "this shearing , at constant area , is given by a compression factor @xmath57 changing the length of the equator into that of a parallel ( at @xmath58 ) , and an expansion factor along meridians .",
    "shear can change the incidence relations between neighbors so that first neighbors are not necessarily the same as on the crystalline cylinder and defects ( non - hexagonal cells ) appear , notably on the polar circles ( fig.[f6 ] ) that separate topologically the cylinder from the two hemispherical polar caps .",
    "projection on a tangent cone is different because the generative spiral on the cone can not have constant pitch and keep a constant density of points .",
    "@xmath59 must vary linearly with @xmath2 .      in plane phyllotaxis with a fermat spiral and in spherical phyllotaxis , cells are of equal area .",
    "but they are not all hexagonal : there are annular crystalline grains of hexagonal cells ( traversed by three visible reticular lines in the form of spirals , the parastichies ) , separated by grain boundaries that are circles of dislocations ( @xmath60 : dipole pentagon / heptagon ) and square - shaped topological hexagons ( @xmath61 : squares with two truncated adjacent vertices ) , in a quasiperiodic sequence @xmath62 .",
    "the two main parastichies cross at right angle through the grain boundaries . @xcite .",
    "the dislocations in the grain boundaries induce a shear strain in the grains .",
    "it is actually a poisson shear , associated with radial compression between two circles of fixed , but different length .",
    "thus , elastic and plastic shear can be readily absorbed by a polycrystalline phyllotactic structure described by several successive grain boundaries with successive fibonacci numbers .",
    "the packing efficiency problem is thereby solved : one grain boundary constitutes a perfect circular boundary for the disk into which objects are to be packed ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "grain boundaries can be moved ( dislocation glide ) by local neighbor exchanges ( @xmath1 ) . in that way , the phyllotactic structure responds easily , locally and naturally to an external force that is expressed in the curvature of the substrate . a grain bounded by two boundaries of fixed length and quasicrystalline topology ,",
    "is depleted as the curvature becomes less positive .",
    "a circular ring of defects constitutes a grain boundary between grain @xmath31 ( hexagonal cells in phyllotaxis @xmath31 ) and grain @xmath63 .",
    "it has a given length of @xmath64 non - hexagonal cells and uses @xmath65 turns of the generative spiral .",
    "the @xmath64 non - hexagonal cells are @xmath9 heptagons , @xmath66 hexagons ( with the two smaller sides not opposite but next to adjacent ) and @xmath9 pentagons , ordered in the quasiperiodic sequence @xmath62 .",

    "the voronoi cells are square - shaped , four incident on a vertex which is a critical point of a @xmath1 ( a natural four - corner boundary , with the two main parastichies crossing at right angle @xcite ) .",
    "the squares are slightly truncated to specify the number of sides of the neighboring cells , and it is the truncation mode that flips ( @xmath1 ) under shear or growth .",
    "the hexagonal cells constituting a grain lie between the pentagons of one grain boundary and the heptagons of the next boundary .",
    "the grain boundary in phyllotaxis is a circular ring of defects , the cells are squares , slightly truncated , and the main parastichies cross perpendicularly , so that the grain boundary can be represented as a strip in a square lattice , with the thin diagonal lines identified ( fig.[fg4]a ) .",
    "the strip is mapped into a circular ring of defects ( non - hexagonal cells ) of fig .",
    "the mapping is conformal ( it conserves the angles ) , so that the orthogonality of the main parastichies and the square shape of the cells are conserved .    in planar and",
    "spherical phyllotaxis , the innermost ring of defects contains five more pentagons ( of topological charge @xmath69 ) than heptagons ( topological charge @xmath70 ) @xcite .",
    "this is because the topological charge of a disk ( flattened hemisphere ) must be @xmath71 , with @xmath72 taken up by the innermost grain boundary ( polar circle ) and @xmath69 by the pole ( @xmath25 , a pentagonal cell ) .",
    "the core ( polar cap ) is the open disk of cells inside the innermost ring of defects ( open circles in fig.[exfig9 ] ) .",
    "since the successive grain boundaries are circles of given length , they are better separated on a substrate with a more positive gaussian curvature , and more crowded on a more negative curvature substrate .",
    "indeed , as we shall see later , spheres @xmath73 have the simplest structure : only one grain @xmath74 separated from two polar caps of three cells each @xmath75 and @xmath76 by grain boundaries ( polar circles ) of thirteen cells each , + @xmath77 $ ] and @xmath78 $ ] .",
    "( see fig.[f6]a ) . in smaller spheres",

    "larger spheres are discussed in appendix 1 .",
    "the phyllotactic structure has global features , such as the circular grain boundaries , visible in fig.[fg2 ] , but also local features , the organization into parastichies , whorls of neighbor cells .",
    "both features are invariant under the local , elementary topological transformations @xmath1 and @xmath0 that are driving cell disappearance in foam evolution ( see fig.1 and @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the cells in grain boundaries , which are truncated squares , almost meet at four - corner vertices , the critical point for @xmath1 .",
    "thus , phyllotaxis is a topologically stable but malleable arrangement .",
    "the grain boundaries ( defect rings ) constitute specific layers , a concept in ( disordered ) foams that uses the notion of topological equi - distance @xcite .",
    "layers are best illustrated in fig.[fg3 ] , taken from @xcite .",
    "the nearest neighbors to an @xmath84-sided cell @xmath85 are @xmath84 cells at distance @xmath86 , thereby defining topological distance .",

    "a foam ( space - filling cellular complex ) can be decomposed into successive layers @xmath92 going up ( or outwards ) , or @xmath93 going down ( inwards ) .",

    ". @xcite . in phyllotaxis ,",
    "the layers are naturally anchored on the defect rings , so that the origin layer is specified only with respect to the nearest defect ring .",

    "( fig.[fg4]b ) .    in phyllotaxis , layers have normally a fibonacci number of cells .",

    "they fill up naturally under growth ( addition of further cells ) . going down ( or inwards in fig.[fg2 ] ) , a circular ring of defects constitutes a grain boundary , a complete layer of @xmath64 cells that are truncated squares , namely @xmath9 heptagons , @xmath66 topological hexagons and @xmath9 pentagons , successively along the @xmath65 turns of the generative spiral .",

    "an application of phyllotaxis to growth with the plasticity imparted by the grain boundaries can be seen in the natural history of agave parryi ( fig.[f5 ] ) .",
    "structurally , it spends almost its entire life ( 24.5 years ) as a conventional , spherical cactus in phyllotaxis @xmath74 which is also that of the pineapple . during the last six month of its life",
    ", it sprouts a huge mast terminating as seeds - loaded branches .",
    "the agave is a spherical phyllotaxis @xmath73 , @xmath135,6,6, .. ;\\dots$ ] , a single grain @xmath74 bounded by two grain boundaries ( polar circles ) @xmath77 $ ] and + @xmath78 $ ] on which the cells are square and the vertices critical points for @xmath1 ( fig.[f6]a ) .",
    "growth proceeds from the bottom , from the south to the north pole of the sphere .",
    "the south polar cap consists of a first layer of three cells @xmath75 with the south polar circle .",
    "how does growth proceed beyond the north polar circle ?",
    "normal growth ( steady state ) clings to the sphere .",
    "but in the last six months of its life , the agave first switches to the cone tangent to the sphere on the north polar circle , through a complete grain boundary @xmath151 $ ] ( a slight increase of the rate of growth replaces the five innermost hexagons by heptagons and the gaussian curvature falls from @xmath152 to zero ) ( fig.[f6]b ) . then , immediately , the agave switches to a less open cone , the mast in phyllotaxis @xmath153 , through another smaller grain boundary . the mast terminates as seeds - loaded branches arranged on an open , uncapped cylinder in the @xmath154 phyllotaxis , through the grain boundary [ 5,5,6,7,7 ] ( fig.[f7 ] ) .",
    "the cylinder in the @xmath154 phyllotaxis is indeed the topological endgame , and , unlike a cone , it can be extended without end . if a `` big bang '' had occurred on the south polar cap , growth of a conical mast and a cylinder are the simplest means of avoiding a `` big crunch '' on the north polar cap .",
    "projection on the tangent cone ( as in the mast of the agave ) is different from the projection on the sphere because the generative spiral on the cone can not have constant pitch @xmath59 and keep a constant density of points .",
    "the pitch @xmath59 must vary linearly with @xmath2 .",
    "also , the tangent cone is not capped , in fact , it can only end as a cylinder of seeds - loaded branches .",
    "thus , as summarized in one sequence @xmath17 of grains and grain boundaries @xmath155 $ ] , + @xmath156,[5,5,5,6,6,7,7,7],6,6, ... 6,[5,5,6,7,7],6,6,6 ... $ ] .",
    "+ successive grains are the spherical phyllotaxis @xmath74 , the mast @xmath153 on a cone and the seeds - loaded branches @xmath154 on a cylinder .",
    "we have shown that the phyllotactic organization into parastichies and grain boundaries is robust .",
    "it survives cell disappearance and persists through growth .",
    "it accommodates shear stresses naturally .",
    "this is indeed the essential property of soft matter in general , and of foam in particular . here",
    "the foam is not random , but organized into layers @xcite .",
    "a grain boundary is singularly effective as it is a layer of square cells joining at critical four - corner vertices , ready to flip under shear one way or the other .",
    "the disappearance of the first pentagonal cell that leaves invariant the organization into parastichies , is the other crucial agent of the malleability of the structure .",
    "this paper has been written as a tribute to professor dominique langevin on her official retirement .",
    "nr is grateful to f. rothen and a .- j .",
    "koch for many discussions and for their hospitality in lausanne .",
    "in larger spheres ( @xmath157 ) , a ring of defects straddling the equator , and palindromic , i.e. symmetric about it , emerges besides the two polar circles . for @xmath158 ,",
    "this new ring splits into two mirror - imaged , normal grain boundaries with twenty - one cells each @xmath159 $ ] .",
    "the polar circle @xmath160 $ ] has been pushed towards the origin ( the first layer @xmath161 has now two cells only ) .",
    "it will ultimately disintegrate , and the new grain boundary will carry the topological charge @xmath141 .    indeed , in planar phyllotaxis ( fig.2 and footnote 3 ) , the sequence is + @xmath18\\ldots$ ] , + no longer constrained by symmetry about the equator . after removing the boundary ( @xmath26 ) and making ( i ) one , or ( ii ) two @xmath1 so that parastichies @xmath21 do not start from the first layer",
    ", one has the invariant sequences + ( i ) @xmath162\\ldots$ ] , + or ( ii ) @xmath28\\ldots$ ] .",
    "then , all cells have neighbors on parastichies labelled by fibonacci numbers . sequence ( i ) is obtained if one shifts the first point from the origin of the generative spiral , i.e , set @xmath163 in eq.1 .",
    "consider fig.[exfig9 ] , which is fig.[newfig]a with the cells numbered .",
    "the core includes all the cells ( @xmath164 ) inside the innermost defect ring ( open circles , @xmath24 ) . moving inwards ,",
    "the twenty - one cells of the innermost defect ring constitute layer 3 with the eight pentagons @xmath165 as defect inclusions .",
    "layer 2 consists of the eight cells @xmath166 , cyclically .",
    "the two pentagons @xmath167 are defect inclusions .",
    "layer 1 ( thick black points ) has only the two pentagons @xmath168 .",
    "the generative spiral gets tighter as one goes out ( eq .",
    "( 1 ) , with @xmath169 ) so that cells have the same average size on average .",
    "the azimuthal angle between two successive points on the spiral @xmath7 is a substantial fraction @xmath170 of @xmath171 . as a consequence , successive cells on the generative spiral are not direct neighbors ( except the first two ) .",
    "let us follow the generative spiral .",
    "cell @xmath19 is at the origin . with cell @xmath25",
    ", it constitutes layer 1 ( thick black points ) .",
    "the azimuth of cell @xmath22 , the first cell of layer 2 , is greater than @xmath172 , so that the generative spiral has made a complete turn by point @xmath22 .",
    "the last cell @xmath173 of layer 2 has nearly the same azimuth as cell 1 - indeed , they are neighbors , belonging to one of the eight parastichies @xmath174 - and by then , the generative spiral has made five turns .",
    "cell @xmath175 ( the first cell of layer 3 ) is neighbor to cell @xmath90 and they belong to another parastichy @xmath174 . layer 3 ( open white circles ) with twenty - one cells @xmath24 uses up thirteen turns of the generative spiral , each cell containing thirteen segments .",
    "this is why the last eight cells @xmath176 , which are pentagons , look grey ( shaded ) in fig.[exfig9 ] .",
    "further out , the phyllotactic structure is fully developed , with defect annuli separating hexagonal grains .",
    "for example , in fig.2 , the fourth ring of defects from the outside has @xmath177 cells ( 21 heptagons , 13 hexagons and 21 pentagons ) .",
    "it separates grains @xmath178 and @xmath179 ."
