    "cagelike materials , such as clathrate compounds , @xcite often exhibit metallic electrical conductivity but a heavily suppressed thermal conductivity resembling glassy materials , which can lead to their potential application in thermoelectric devices . in general , they have a network structure of atomic cages encapsulating a guest ion .",
    "these guest ions are loosely bounded by the local potential of an electronegative cage and therefore vibrate with a large amplitude . due to its low frequency , such a localized vibrational mode of the guest in the oversized cage ( referred to as _ rattling phonon _ ) hybridizes and interferes strongly with the heat - carrying acoustic phonons of the cage network.@xcite thus , the rattling phonon is expected to play a key role in the above - mentioned characteristic transport phenomena .",
    "the type - viii clathrate ba@xmath2ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 , hereafter abbreviated as @xmath5-bgs , adopts a cubic structure with space group @xmath7 , presenting 8 distorted dodecahedral cages formed by a network of ga and sn.@xcite it is a so - called zintl compound , stabilized by charge compensation , that each cage is donated 2 electrons from a guest ba@xmath6 .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] illustrates a disordered dodecahedral cage and the guest ba@xmath6 ion .",
    "a fine tuning of the ga / sn relative concentration slightly off the stoichiometry can turn the system into a heavily doped semiconductor , and hence control both the charge carrier sign and density .",
    "@xcite    -bgs .",
    ", scaledwidth=28.0% ]    one of the most striking features of @xmath5-bgs is the fact that the lattice thermal conductivity @xmath8 behaves quite differently depending on the sign of charge carriers.@xcite in the @xmath1-type materials @xmath9 shows an almost glasslike temperature dependence akin to disordered materials , with a plateau around 10 - 30k , whereas in @xmath0-type ones @xmath9 has a normal crystalline peak around 10k .",
    "such behaviors in @xmath8 have also been observed in a few type - i clathrates , ba@xmath2ga@xmath3ge@xmath4 ( bgg)@xcite and ba@xmath2ni@xmath10ge@xmath11 ( bng ) @xcite , where the carrier types have been found fully tunable .",
    "it is noteworthy that so far only ba - based clathrates ( but not all of them ) have shown such full tunability and strong carrier - dependent transport . although it is expected that the coupling of the heat - conducting acoustic phonons with the guest ion rattling is stronger in @xmath1-type materials @xcite , the origin of the carrier - dependent @xmath9 in @xmath5-bgs and others remains an intriguing open question , despite the fact that the detailed interaction between rattling and acoustic phonons has been intensively studied and debated in literature .    in a recent paper , we have reported the optical conductivity spectra of the infrared - active rattling phonons by using terahertz time - domain spectroscopy ( thz - tds ) in the type - i clathrate bgg,@xcite whose carrier - dependence in @xmath9 is quite similar to that of @xmath5-bgs .",
    "@xcite for @xmath1-type bgg , where any effects of charge carriers are negligible due to the quite low carrier density of the measured samples , the lowest - lying vibrational mode of the ba@xmath6 guest ion consists of a sharp lorentzian peak at 1.2thz superimposed on a broad tail weighted in the lower frequency range around 1.0thz .",
    "@xcite with decreasing temperature , an unexpected linewidth broadening of the phonon peak is observed , together with monotonic softening of the phonon peak and an enhancement of the tail structure . from the analysis based on an impurity scattering model for rattling modes that are strongly hybridized with cage acoustic phonons ,",
    "it is suggested that the anomalous features of the rattling phonon spectra arise from both the softening due to anharmonicity and the strong hybridization between rattling and acoustic phonons . in bgg , certain dissipative mechanisms into a continuum of multi - bosonic particle states , such as phonon - phonon scattering , may not have any effects on the rattling phonons at the @xmath12 point of the first brillouin zone .",
    "the rattling excitation in the single - well , or _ on - center _ , potential may have a more propagating nature through the hybridization with the acoustic phonon , and the local potential may contribute rather as a mean field .",
    "@xcite    the optical conductivity spectra of the infrared - active rattling phonons have also been investigated in type - i ba@xmath2ga@xmath3sn@xmath4 ( @xmath13-bgs ) @xcite in which @xmath9 is strongly glasslike irrespective of the charge carriers . with decreasing temperature ,",
    "a single broad peak of the lowest - lying ba@xmath6 guest mode becomes split into two subpeaks and also shows a linewidth broadening .",
    "the splitting is understood by assuming a multi - well _ off - center _ anharmonic potential , @xcite revealed by structural analyses @xcite .",
    "however , the cause of broadening remains an open question due to the following : in @xmath13-bgs , according to the impurity - scattering model for the hybridized phonon system , @xcite a crossover from a mean field regime to a degenerate level transition @xcite is expected with decreasing temperature , since a strong hybridization of _ off - center _ rattling with acoustic phonons is predicted theoretically .",
    "@xcite since those samples have significant carrier densities of order @xmath14@xmath15 even at low temperature , @xcite the interaction with charge carriers can not be neglected .",
    "in such a context , the relationships between the charge carriers and the phonon system also remains as one of the major issues required to clarify the transport mechanisms in cage systems . in type - i clathrates , phonon scattering contributions from localized carriers have been suggested as a relevant origin for carrier - dependent @xmath9 , @xcite as such effects may change the dynamical properties of the phonon system depending on the density and sign of the charge carriers .",
    "measurements that probe the dynamical properties of both charge carriers and phonons should thus be important .",
    "although the optical conductivity spectra of the type - viii clathrate eu@xmath2ga@xmath3ge@xmath4 ( @xmath5-egg ) have also been reported , @xcite there are few discussions about the lifetimes of charge carriers and phonons resulting from electron - phonon interaction .",
    "as supported by structural analysis , @xcite neutron magnetic resonance , @xcite and ultrasonic measurements , @xcite the rattling phonons of ba@xmath6 in @xmath5-bgs can be approximated as on - center , @xcite and are therefore much simpler than those in @xmath13-bgs , to analyze the relationships between the charge carriers and the phonon system .",
    "the dc resistivity also shows metallic behavior for both types of charge carriers , @xcite indicating that there is sufficient carrier density for their interaction with rattling phonons to be expected even at low temperatures .",
    "since the magnitude of the dc resistivity is about 5 - 20@xmath16 , @xcite it is expected that the contribution from rattling phonons in the optical conductivity is comparable to that from charge carriers . for the above reasons , @xmath5-bgs is one of the best materials to study the dynamical properties of both charge carriers and rattling phonons and hence the electron - phonon interaction in clathrate compounds .    in this paper",

    "when the obtained value of @xmath118 is substituted into the bloch - grneisen formula , the contribution from the @xmath79 mode is estimated as 40 - 50thz , larger by a factor of about 10 - 20 than the experimental value @xmath51 .",
    "in other words , the linewidth induced by the interaction of ba@xmath6 rattling with charge carriers should be of order 0.01thz at most .",
    "thus , the remaining possibility should reside in the structural disorder due to ga atoms . as revealed by exafs analysis , @xcite the bonding lengths of ge and ga are almost the same in bgg , but in @xmath5-bgs the atomic radius of sn is significantly larger than that of ga . @xcite since the sites on the framework are randomly occupied by ga atoms , the difference in atomic radius can increase the linewidth through the deformation of the cage potential .",
    "the difference in the number of ga atoms between @xmath0- and @xmath1-@xmath5-bgs is negligibly small as already discussed in  [ sec4 - 1 ] .",
    "therefore , the structural disorder is the likely candidate to induce additional linewidth in the phonon spectra .",
    "we also note that the phonon spectra of @xmath5-bgs are well reproduced by the lorentz model .",
    "this is in clear contrast to the phonon spectra of bgg , which consist of a sharp lorentzian peak superimposed on a broad tail weighted in the lower frequency regime as previously reported .",
    "@xcite according to the impurity - scattering model , the sharp peak and tail structure in bgg is caused by a rapid change of the phonon density - of - states ( dos ) around the hybridization gap .",
    "@xcite as discussed above , in @xmath5-bgs , the structural disorder and/or the electron - phonon interaction contribute to the linewidth of rattling phonons .",
    "these additional contributions fill the would - be hybridization gap , smoothing the phonon dos , and the rattling phonon spectra of @xmath5-bgs have no such clear sideband structures reflecting the phonon dos .",

    "when the center of mass coordinate @xmath125 of the cage and the coordinate of the guest ion @xmath126 are considered , the potential in the cage is applied to the relative coordinate @xmath127 @xmath128 as already mentioned , since the rattling excitation may have a more propagating nature through the interaction with acoustic phonons , @xcite the softening of the rattling excitation is well reproduced by the mean field approximation @xcite , @xmath129 where @xmath130 is the reduced mass of the cage and the guest and @xmath131 is the mean square value of @xmath132 . to obtain the anharmonicity parameters of the rattling phonons",

    "[ fig7 ] are the fitted curves , and the parameters @xmath135 and @xmath120 are listed in table [ tab2 ] , where @xmath136 is the peak frequency and @xmath137 is a dimensionless anharmonicity parameter .",
    "the table values show that @xmath120 in @xmath0-@xmath5-bgs are smaller by 40% than those in @xmath1-@xmath5-bgs , implying in weaker anharmonicity of the ba@xmath6 rattling in @xmath0-@xmath5-bgs . according to our discussions in the previous section , the elastic scattering by the local impurities and structural disorder",
    "are not affected by the carrier doping , so the anharmonicity parameters should not be modified significantly by these effects . to understand the carrier dependence of @xmath120 in @xmath5-bgs , the interactions with conducting and/or",
    "localized electrons should be taken into account . as discussed in ",
    "[ sec4 - 1 ] , the temperature variation of @xmath51 indicates that the electron - phonon interaction in @xmath0-@xmath5-bgs is much stronger than that in @xmath1-@xmath5-bgs .",
    "thus , carrier dependence in the peak frequencies may also be caused by the electronic structure where the ba atomic orbitals hybridize with those of ga and sn in the conduction band .",
    "@xcite electrons on ba@xmath6 ions can vary the effective charge of ba@xmath6 and hence modify the potential in the atomic cage .",
    "the frequency and/or anharmonic potential may be renormalized by such an interaction with @xmath0-type carriers , resulting in the carrier dependence of @xmath120 and @xmath135 .",
    "as discussed above , the charge carriers on ba@xmath6 ions and the rattling phonons are considered to interact with each other , which is a cause of the carrier dependence observed in optical conductivity spectra .",
    "then , it is expected that the interaction between charge carriers and phonons affect the thermal transport . in terms of the unusual lattice thermal conductivity in these materials , there are two noteworthy candidate mechanisms that can lead to charge carrier dependence of @xmath9 : ( 1 ) the interaction between rattling and acoustic phonons and ( 2 ) the direct interaction between phonons and charge carriers .",
    "the present results imply that a renormalization of the guest potential occurs in the atomic cage , which result from the existence of ba orbitals in the conduction band , and the consequent presence of doped electrons on the ba@xmath6 ions .",
    "carrier dependence of the former interaction may arise from such a renormalization of the guest potential .",
    "in other words , an enhancement of the interaction between rattling and acoustic phonons in @xmath1-type materials may be proposed due to stronger anharmonicity . as for the latter",
    ", it may also be proposed that the charge carriers on the framework interact directly with acoustic phonons and with the rattling phonon through charging of cages , and then contribute to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity in @xmath1-@xmath5-bgs , since @xmath1-type carriers are induced onto the valence band which consists mainly of ga and sn atomic orbitals .",
    "@xcite the relative influence of each mechanism to the carrier dependence in the lattice thermal conductivity is still an open question .",
    "however , our analysis establishes that the charge carriers do play a significant role in both mechanisms proposed to understand the dynamical properties of phonons and hence the thermal properties of clathrate compounds .",
    "we have clarified the dynamical motion of the rattling phonons and charge carriers in @xmath5-bgs single crystals with both @xmath0- and @xmath1-type carriers by thz - tds .",
    "the optical conductivity spectra are well reproduced by superpositions of contributions from valence electrons , conducting carriers , and infrared - active optical phonons .",
    "the contribution from charge carriers is well reproduced by the drude - smith model , in which multiple scattering of charge carriers is taken into account .",
    "the relaxation rate behaves differently depending on the charge carrier sign , suggesting a stronger electron - phonon interaction in @xmath0-@xmath5-bgs than in @xmath1-@xmath5-bgs .",
    "ba@xmath6 rattling modes in the oversized cages show softening and broadening towards low temperature .",
    "while the linewidths agree quantitatively between @xmath0- and @xmath1-@xmath5-bgs , the peak frequency shows clear carrier dependence .",
    "the linewidths are found to increase due to impurities and structural disorder , rather than interaction with conducting carriers , due to the low carrier density of @xmath138-@xmath139@xmath15 . on the other hand ,",
    "the anharmonic potential of ba@xmath6 in @xmath0-@xmath5-bgs seems modified by electrons in the conduction band , which consists of ba atomic orbitals as well as ga and sn orbitals .",
    "the present experiments have indicated that the interaction between rattling phonons and charge carriers contributes not only to the scattering of charge carriers , but also to the vibrational states of rattling phonons , particularly in the @xmath0-type material . as also suggested in ref .",
    "@xcite , the interaction with charge carriers may also affect the dynamical properties of the acoustic phonons directly .",
    "the obtained results also give rise to an interesting problem for the compounds with _ off - centered _",
    "guest ions , _ i. e. _ , @xmath13-bgs and type - i eu@xmath2ga@xmath3ge@xmath4 .",
    "@xcite in these materials the guest ion vibrates in a multi - well potential and is expected to move among each potential minimum by quantum tunneling .",
    "it is theoretically proposed that the interaction between the conducting electrons and the tunneling states of off - center rattling systems results in a multi - channel kondo effect .",
    "@xcite the detailed interactions among the charge densities at the guest ion sites , the cage phonons , and the _ off - center _ rattling remains as an interesting open problem in these cagelike materials . from the present studies ,",
    "such interactions are expected to contribute not only to the lifetime of phonons but also to a renormalization of phonon frequencies .",
    "the dynamical properties of low - energy phonons need to be investigated in clathrate compounds through brillouin scattering and inelastic neutron and x - ray scattering .",
