    "the existence of the top quark , which is required in the standard model as the weak isospin partner of the bottom quark , was firmly established in 1995 by the cdf@xcite and d0@xcite experiments at the fermilab tevatron , confirming earlier evidence presented by cdf@xcite .",
    "each experiment reported a roughly 5@xmath4 excess of @xmath5 candidate events over background , together with a peak in the mass distrbution for fully reconstructed events .",
    "the datasets used in these analyses were about 60% of the eventual run i totals . with the top quark well in hand and over 100  pb@xmath6 of data collected per experiment ,",
    "the emphasis has now shifted to a more precise study of the top quark s properties .    in @xmath7 collisions at @xmath8  tev ,",
    "the dominant top quark production mechanism is pair production through @xmath9 annihilation . in the standard model ,",
    "each top quark decays immediately to a @xmath1 boson and a @xmath10 quark .",
    "the observed event topology is then determined by the decay mode of the two @xmath1 s .",
    "events are classified by the number of @xmath1 s that decay leptonically . about 5% of the time each @xmath1 decays to @xmath11 or @xmath12 ( the `` dilepton channel '' ) , yielding a final state with two isolated ,",
    "high-@xmath13 charged leptons , substantial missing transverse energy ( @xmath14 ) from the undetected energetic neutrinos , and two @xmath10 quark jets .",
    "this final state is extremely clean but suffers from a low rate .",
    "the `` lepton + jets '' final state occurs in the 30% of @xmath5 decays where when one @xmath1 decays to leptons and the other decays into quarks .",
    "these events contain a single high-@xmath13 lepton , large @xmath14 , and ( nominally ) four jets , two of which are from @xmath10 s .",
    "backgrounds in this channel can be reduced to an acceptable level through @xmath10-tagging and/or kinematic cuts , and the large branching ratio to this final state makes it the preferred channel for studying the top quark at the tevatron .",
    "the `` all - hadronic '' final state occurs when both @xmath1 s decay to @xmath15 , which happens 44% of the time .",
    "this final state contains no leptons , low @xmath14 , and six jets , including two @xmath10 jets .",
    "although the qcd backgrounds in this channel are formidable , extraction of the signal is possible through a combination of @xmath10-tagging and kinematic cuts",
    ". finally , approximately 21% of @xmath5 decays are to final states containing @xmath16 s . backgrounds to hadronic @xmath16 decays are large , and while signals have been identified i will not discuss these analyses here .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec - xsection ] discusses the measurement of the @xmath5 production cross section .",
    "the measurement of the top quark mass is described in section  [ sec - mass ] .",
    "kinematic properties of @xmath5 production are described in section  [ sec - kine ] .",
    "the measurement of the top quark branching ratio to @xmath17 and the ckm matrix element @xmath0 is described in section  [ sec - vtb ] .",
    "section  [ sec - rare ] discusses searches for rare or forbidden decays of the top .",
    "section  [ sec - wpol ] discusses a measurement of the @xmath1 polarization in top decays . section  [ sec - concl ] concludes .",
    "the measurement of the top quark production cross section @xmath18 is of interest for a number of reasons .",
    "first , it checks qcd calculations of top production , which have been performed by several groups@xcite .",
    "second , it provides an important benchmark for estimating top yields in future high - statistics experiments at the tevatron and lhc .",
    "finally , a value of the cross section significantly different from the qcd prediction could indicate nonstandard production or decay mechanisms , for example production through the decay of an intermediate high - mass state or decays to final states other than @xmath17 .",
    "the cdf collaboration has measured the @xmath20 production cross section in the dilepton and lepton + jets modes , and in addition has recently performed a measurement in the all - hadronic channel .",
    "the dilepton and lepton + jets analyses begin with a common inclusive lepton sample , which requires an isolated electron or muon with @xmath21  gev and @xmath22 .",
    "the integrated luminosity of this sample is 110  pb@xmath6 .    for the dilepton analysis ,",
    "a second lepton is required with @xmath23  gev .",
    "the second lepton must have an opposite electric charge to the primary lepton and may satisfy a looser set of identification cuts .",
    "in addition , two jets with @xmath24  gev are required , and the @xmath14 must be greater than 25  gev . for the case @xmath25",
    "gev , the @xmath14 vector must be separated from the nearest lepton or jet by at least 20 degrees .",
    "this cut rejects backgrounds from @xmath26 decays followed by @xmath27 ( where the @xmath14 tends to lie along the lepton direction ) and from events containing poorly measured jets ( where the @xmath14 tends to lie along a jet axis ) .",
    "events where the dilepton invariant mass lies between 75 and 105 gev are removed from the @xmath28 and @xmath29 channels as @xmath30 candidates .",
    "in addition , events containing a photon with @xmath31 gev are removed if the @xmath32 invariant mass falls within the @xmath30 mass window .",
    "this `` radiative @xmath30 '' cut removes one event from the @xmath29 channel and has a negligible effect on the @xmath20 acceptance and backgrounds .",
    "nine dilepton candidates are observed : one @xmath28 , one @xmath29 , and seven @xmath33 events . including a simulation of the trigger acceptance , the expected division of dilepton signal events is 58% @xmath33 , 27% @xmath29 , and 15% @xmath28 , consistent with the data .",
    "it is also interesting to note that four of the nine events are @xmath10-tagged , including two double - tagged events .",
    "although no explicit @xmath10-tag requirement is made in the dilepton analysis , the fact that a large fraction of the events are tagged is powerful additional evidence of @xmath20 production .",
    "backgrounds in the dilepton channel arise from drell - yan production of lepton pairs , diboson production , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , and fakes .",
    "these backgrounds are estimated through a combination of data and monte carlo .",
    "the total background in the @xmath36 channels is @xmath37 events , and is @xmath38 events in the @xmath33 channel .",
    "event yields , backgrounds , and estimated @xmath20 contributions are summarized in table  [ tab - cdf_dil ] .    when these numbers are combined with the @xmath20 acceptance in the dilepton mode of @xmath39% ( including branching ratios ) , and using cdf s measured top mass of 175  gev ( described below ) , the resulting cross section is @xmath40  pb .",
    ".summary of event yields and backgrounds in the cdf dilepton analysis . expected @xmath20 contributions are also shown . [ cols=\"^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : cdf_mt_systs ]",
    "the constrained fits described above return the complete four - vectors for all the partons in the event , and allow a range of other kinematic variables to be studied . as examples , fig .",
    "[ fig : kin_pt_ttbar ] shows the @xmath13 of the @xmath20 system as reconstructed from cdf data , and fig .",
    "[ fig : kin_d0_mtt_pttop ] shows the @xmath20 invariant mass and the average @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xmath13 from d0 .",
    "the distributions have not been corrected for event selection biases or combinatoric misassignments . in these and in similar plots , the agreement with the standard model is good .",
    "= 3.5 in    = 3.5 in    a very important cross - check that the experiments are really observing @xmath20 pair production is to search for the hadronically decaying @xmath1 in lepton + jets events .",
    "cdf has performed such an analysis by selecting lepton + 4-jet events with two @xmath10-tags . to maximize the @xmath10-tag efficiency , the second @xmath10 in the event",
    "is allowed to satisfy a looser tag requirement .",
    "the two untagged jets should then correspond to the hadronic @xmath1 decay .",
    "[ fig : kin_mjj_dbl_tag ] shows the dijet invariant mass for the two untagged jets .",
    "the clear peak at the @xmath1 mass , together with the lepton , the @xmath14 , and the two tagged jets , provides additional compelling evidence that we are observing @xmath20 decay to two @xmath1 s and two @xmath10 s .",
    "this measurement is also interesting because it suggests that in future high - statistics experiments the jet energy scale can be determined directly from the data by reconstructing this resonance .",
    "in the standard model , the top quark decays essentially 100% of the time to @xmath17",
    ". therefore the ratio of branching ratios @xmath44 where @xmath45 is any quark , is predicted to be one .",
    "cdf has measured @xmath46 using two techniques .",
    "the first technique compares the ratio of double- to single - tagged lepton + jets events that pass the mass analysis cuts , and double- , single- and un - tagged dilepton events .",
    "since the efficiency to tag a single @xmath10-jet is well known from control samples , the observed tag ratios can be converted into a measurement of @xmath46 .",
    "cdf finds : @xmath47 or @xmath48 untagged lepton + jets events are not used in this analysis because of the large backgrounds admitted by the standard cuts .",
    "( of course , the cuts were designed to be loose to avoid kinematic bias ; the background rejection is normally provided by @xmath10-tagging . ) the second cdf technique uses the `` event structure '' cuts of ref .",
    "@xcite to increase the purity of the untagged lepton + jets sample , allowing it to be included in this measurement .",
    "the result is : @xmath49 or @xmath50 it should be noted that these analyses make the implicit assumption that the branching ratio to non-@xmath1 final states is negligible .",
    "the fact that the cross sections measured in the dilepton , lepton + jets , and all - hadronic channels are in good agreement is evidence that this assumption is correct .",
    "alternatively , if one believes the theoretical cross section , it is clear from the svx and slt @xmath10-tag measurements that this cross section is saturated by decays to @xmath17 .",
    "however , these `` indications '' have not yet been turned into firm limits on non-@xmath1 decays .",
    "the measurement of @xmath46 above can be interpreted as a measurement of the ckm matrix element @xmath0 .",
    "however , it is not necessarily the case that @xmath51 implies @xmath52 .",
    "this inference follows only in the absence of a fourth generation , where the value of @xmath0 is constrained by unitarity and the known values of the other ckm matrix elements . in this case",
    ", @xmath0 is determined much more accurately from these constraints than from the direct measurement .",
    "( in fact , under the assumption of 3-generation unitarity , @xmath0 is actually the _ best known _ ckm matrix element . )",
    "a more general relationship , which is true for three or more generations provided that there is no fourth generation @xmath53 quark lighter than top , is @xmath54    since @xmath46 depends on three ckm matrix elements and not just one , a single measurement can not determine @xmath0 , and we must make additional assumptions about @xmath55 and @xmath56 . in general , a fourth generation would allow @xmath56 and @xmath55 to take on any value up to their values assuming 3-generation unitarity .",
    "one simplifying assumption is that the upper 3@xmath57 portion of the ckm martix is unitary . in that case ,",
    "@xmath58 , and @xmath46 gives @xmath0 directly .",
    "however , as noted above , under this assumption @xmath0 is very well determined anyway and this direct measurement adds no improved information . assuming 3@xmath57 unitarity , the two analyses described above give @xmath59 and @xmath60 respectively .",
    "a more interesting assumption is that 3@xmath57 unitarity is relaxed _ only _ for @xmath0",
    ". then we can insert the pdg values of @xmath55 and @xmath56 and obtain : @xmath61 for the first method , or @xmath62 for the second .    to see that a small value of @xmath0 would not violate anything we know about top ,",
    "consider the situation with @xmath10 decays .",
    "the @xmath10 quark decays @xmath63 of the time to @xmath64 , even though @xmath65 .",
    "this is because the channel with a large ckm coupling , @xmath66 , is kinematically inaccessible .",
    "the same situation could occur for top in the presence of a heavy fourth generation .",
    "however in this case the top width would be narrower than the standard model expectation .",
    "a more definitive measurement@xcite of @xmath0 will be performed in future tevatron runs by measuring @xmath67 directly through the single top production channel @xmath68 .",
    "cdf has performed searches for the flavor - changing neutral current decays @xmath69 and @xmath70 .",
    "the decay to @xmath71 can have a branching ratio as high as @xmath72 in some theoretical models@xcite .",
    "the search for this decay includes the possibility that one or both top quarks in an event can decay to @xmath71 . in either case the signature is one @xmath73 candidate and four jets .",
    "backgrounds in the @xmath71 channel come from @xmath74 and @xmath75 plus jets production , and are estimated to be @xmath76 events .",
    "in addition , 0.5 events are expected from standard model @xmath20 decay .",
    "one event is observed . under the conservative assumption that this event is signal , the resulting limit is : @xmath77    the branching ratio of @xmath70",
    "is predicted to be roughly @xmath78@xcite , so any observation of this decay would probably indicate new physics .",
    "cdf searches for final states in which one top decays to @xmath17 and the other decays to @xmath79 .",
    "the signature is then @xmath80 or more jets ( if @xmath81 ) , or @xmath82 or more jets ( if @xmath83 ) . in the hadronic channel ,",
    "the background is 0.5 events , and no events are seen . in the leptonic channel ,",
    "the background is 0.06 events , and one event is seen .",
    "( it is a curious event , containing a 72  gev muon , an 88  gev @xmath84 candidate , 24  gev of @xmath14 , and three jets . ) conservatively assuming this event to be signal for purposes of establishing a limit , cdf finds : @xmath85 this limit is stronger than the @xmath71 limit because of the @xmath30 branching fraction to @xmath36 of about 6.7% , compared to the @xmath84 reconstruction efficiency of about 80% .",
    "the large mass of the top quark implies that the top quark decays before hadronization , so its decay products preserve the helicity structure of the underlying lagrangian .",
    "top decays , therefore , are a unique laboratory for studying the weak interactions of a bare quark .",
    "in particular , the standard model predicts that top can only decay into left - handed or longitudinal @xmath1 bosons , and the ratio is fixed by the relationship @xmath86 for @xmath87  gev , the standard model predicts that about 70% of top quarks decay into longitudinal @xmath1 bosons .",
    "this is an exact prediction resulting from lorentz invariance and the @xmath88 character of the electroweak lagrangian . if new physics modifies the @xmath41-@xmath1-@xmath10 vertex  i.e . through the introduction of a right - handed scale ",
    "it may reveal itself in departures of the @xmath1 polarization from the standard model prediction .",
    "the @xmath1 polarization has recently been measured , albeit with low statistics , by cdf .",
    "i describe this measurement here to illustrate the type of measurement that will be done with high precision in future runs with the main injector .",
    "the @xmath1 polarization is determined from the @xmath89 , the angle between the charged lepton and the @xmath1 in the rest frame of the @xmath1 .",
    "this quantity can be expressed in the lab frame using the approximate relationship@xcite @xmath90 where @xmath91 is the invariant mass of the charged lepton and the @xmath10 jet from the same top decay , and @xmath92 is the three - body invariant mass of the charged lepton , the neutrino , and the corresponding @xmath10 jet .",
    "this last quantity is nominally equal to @xmath93 , though in the analysis the measured jet and lepton energies are used , and the possibility of combinatoric misassignment is included .",
    "monte carlo templates for @xmath89 are generated using the herwig @xmath20 event generator followed by a simulation of the cdf detector .",
    "the simulated events are then passed through the same constrained fitting procedure used in the top mass analysis .",
    "the fit is used here to determine the most likely jet ",
    "parton assignment ( i.e. which of the two @xmath10 jets to assign to the leptonic @xmath1 decay ) , and to adjust the measured jet and lepton energies within their uncertainties in order to obtain the best resolution on @xmath89 .",
    "the same procedure is applied to @xmath1+jets events generated by the vecbos monte carlo program to obtain the @xmath89 distribution of the background .",
    "the @xmath89 distribution from the data is then fit to a superposition of monte carlo templates to determine the fraction of longitudinal @xmath1 decays .",
    "the dataset is the same as in the cdf top mass analysis ( lepton + @xmath14 + three or more jets with @xmath94  gev and @xmath95 , and a fourth jet with @xmath96 gev and @xmath97 ) . to increase the purity , only events with svx tags",
    "are used . the @xmath89 distribution in this sample is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : wpol ] together with the results of the fit . the fit returns a longitudinal @xmath1 fraction of @xmath98 ( statistical uncertainties only )",
    ". the statistics are clearly too poor at present to permit any conclusions about the structure of the @xmath41-@xmath1-@xmath10 vertex .",
    "however , with the large increase in statistics that the main injector and various planned detector improvements will provide , precision measurements of this vertex will become possible .",
    "studies indicate , for example , that with a 10  fb@xmath6 sample one can measure br(@xmath99 ) with a statistical uncertainty of about 2% , and have sensitivity to decays to right - handed @xmath1 s with a statistical precision of about 1%@xcite .",
    "the tevatron experiments have progressed quickly from the top search to a comprehensive program of top physics .",
    "highlights of the recently completed run include measurements of the top cross section and mass , studies of kinematic features of top production , and a first look at the properties of top decays . many of these analyses are still in progress , and improved results can be expected .    with a mass of approximately 175  gev ,",
    "the top quark is a unique object , the only known fermion with a mass at the natural electroweak scale",
    ". it would be surprising if the top quark did not play a role in understanding electroweak symmetry breaking .",
    "current measurements are all consistent with the standard model but in many cases are limited by poor statistics : the world @xmath20 sample numbers only about a hundred events at present .",
    "both cdf and d0 are undertaking major detector upgrades designed to take full advantage of high - luminosity running with the main injector starting in 1999 .",
    "this should increase the top sample by a factor of @xmath10050 . beyond that",
    ", fermilab is considering plans to increase the luminosity still further , the lhc is on the horizon , and an @xmath101 linear collider could perform precision studies at the @xmath20 threshold .",
    "the first decade of top physics has begun , and the future looks bright .",
    "i would like to thank the members of the cdf and d0 collaborations whose efforts produced the results described here , and the members of the technical and support staff for making this work possible .",
    "i would also like to thank the organizers of snowmass  96 for inviting me to present these results and for sponsoring a stimulating and enjoyable workshop .",
    "this work is supported in part by nsf grant phy-9515527 and by a doe outstanding junior investigator award .",
