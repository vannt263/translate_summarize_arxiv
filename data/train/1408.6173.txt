    "a detailed knowledge of the nuclear level density is fundamental to understanding reaction mechanisms when the number of levels involved is too large to be treated individually .",
    "hence , several phenomena in nuclear physics , astrophysics and nuclear reactor science , such as multifragmentation reactions , thermonuclear reaction rates and fusion - fission cross sections , are usually modeled using the level density as a key ingredient .    a wide collection of experimental data , mostly below the particle separation threshold , is currently available for stable and close - to - stability isotopes  @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , ever since the seminal work of h. bethe  @xcite , several analytical expressions of the nuclear level density as function of the excitation energy @xmath9 , the spin @xmath10 or the angular momentum distribution have been derived .",
    "elaborate microscopic models embody the main effects that substantially influence the density of levels in atomic nuclei , i.e. shell effects , pairing correlations and collective excitations  @xcite .",
    "in contrast to these microscopic descriptions , simple phenomenological models , such as the back - shifted fermi gas model  @xcite and the composite gilbert and cameron formula  @xcite , are usually adopted to globally reproduce the available experimental data , although they lack in a solid theoretical basis .",
    "the latter includes a constant - temperature behavior of the level density up to a certain excitation energy where the pairing correlations disappear ( @xmath1110 mev ) and then a fermi - gas formula with an energy shift is applied .",
    "the constant - temperature picture describes well the functional form of the level density in the quasicontinuum region , i.e.  between the discrete levels and the particle separation energy , for heavy deformed nuclei belonging to the rare - earth and actinide series ( see ref .",

    "we investigate for the first time the nuclear level density of @xmath0pt and @xmath1au , using the oslo method  @xcite .",
    "this analytical procedure allows to extract simultaneously the nuclear level density and the @xmath12-ray strength function from particle-@xmath12 coincidence measurements .",
    "pt and au isotopes are located in the transitional region between strongly - deformed and spherical nuclear shapes . in particular the structure of @xmath7pt has been experimentally established to correspond to a triaxial @xmath12-soft configuration with a tendency to an oblate shape  @xcite .",
    "we can classify the thermal behavior of the above - mentioned nuclear systems in the framework of the microcanonical ensemble , using the experimental level density as the partition function .",
    "therefore , the entropy and other fundamental quantities ( temperature and heat capacity ) can be extracted to give more insight into the statistical properties of the many - body nuclear system . in particular , fine structures in the entropy distribution as a function of the excitation energy",

    "these residual interactions lead to effects similar to the superconductivity in metals and are successfully described by applying the bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) theory  @xcite to the case of a finite fermi system such as the nucleus .        in the next section the details of the experimental technique and the data analysis",

    "the most disordered system , the odd - odd @xmath6au , manifests a very smooth entropy and , as a consequence , less structure in the temperature .",
    "this is visible in the quenching of the main bump at 0.9 mev .",
    "au in the range of excitation energies between 0 and 4 mev .",
    "the dashed red lines are drawn to help recognizing the sequence of the data points between divergences at @xmath135.[heat_capacity_198au],width=321,height=302 ]    the even - even nuclear system , @xmath7pt , has the highest statistics and effective energy resolution . in this nucleus",
    "we can observe an oscillating distribution with secondary maxima at approximately 2.4 , 3.4 and 4.2 mev .",
    "similarly to the most prominent bump at 0.9 mev , we expect to observe other peaks at 4@xmath111 , 6@xmath111 and so on , in correspondence of the energy threshold where two , three or more quasiparticle pairs can split .",
    "nevertheless , the observed bumps occur after a spacing that is smaller than 2@xmath111 .",
    "moreover , pairing correlations are expected to become less important at higher excitation energies where the pairing field is decreased by the presence of a large number of unpaired quasiparticles .",
    "further breaking of two or more cooper pair is not noticeable in the level density and entropy distributions since the increase of the number of levels due to the splitting of a pair is smeared out .",
    "a linear increase in the entropy @xmath123 is the overall effect ( see fig .",
    "[ entropy_pt_au ] ) , although small fluctuations around the mean value can still be observed in the caloric curve , as mentioned for @xmath7pt .",
    "the peculiar fluctuating behavior of the temperature and in particular the decrease observed , for instance , between 1.0 and 1.8 mev , corresponds to negative values of the heat capacity , derived as : @xmath136 this apparent violation of the laws of thermodynamics is related to the use of the microcanonical ensemble , which , in fact , is the most appropriate formalism to describe small systems .",
    "negative heat capacities have been measured for several systems which are considered isolated , such as clusters of sodium atoms  @xcite , fragmenting au nuclei  @xcite and magnetically self - confined plasma  @xcite . with the same analysis method presented in this work , negative heat capacity has been recently measured in actinides  @xcite . from the theoretical point of view , this feature has been subject of several interpretations .",
    "it has been addressed as a hint of first- or second - order phase transition  @xcite .",
    "recently it has been shown that atomic nuclei undergo a first - order phase transition from a superfluid to an ideal gas of non interacting quasiparticles being characterized by pairing and shell gaps in their particle spectra  @xcite : the heat capacity has an exponential dependence on the temperature up to when the critical point is reached and the system has essentially absorbed all the energy .",
    "similarly to a melting ice cube where the phase transition of water molecules is linearly dependent of the absorbed heat , quasiparticles are created with a constant energy cost and contribute with a constant amount of entropy to the disorder of the system .    in fig .",
    "[ heat_capacity_198au ] the experimental heat capacity of @xmath6au is shown for excitation energy up to @xmath137  mev .",
    "the heat capacity diverges to @xmath135 when the temperature is constant , i.  e.  in correspondence to the maxima and minima .",
    "@xmath138 rapidly increases from zero to @xmath139 at 0.9 mev .",
    "then it proceeds from @xmath140 and increases up to @xmath141 @xmath4 before to drop again to @xmath140 close at 1.5 mev .",
    "a new branch diverging at @xmath139 covers the energy range between 1.5 and 2.2 mev . if we compare the @xmath138 distribution with the corresponding caloric curve in fig .",
    "[ entropy_pt_au ] , we find that the negative branches occur when the temperature decreases and the quasiparticle pair breaks up",
    ". we may conclude that a sequential melting of cooper pairs occurs in the region of low excitation energies , as evident from the oscillating feature of the caloric curve and the negative branches of the heat capacity distribution shown in fig .",
    "[ entropy_pt_au ] and fig .",
    "[ temperature_pt_au ] .",
    "excited states of @xmath0pt and @xmath1au up to the neutron separation energy were populated in ( @xmath41 ) , ( @xmath142 ) , ( @xmath40 ) , ( @xmath143 ) and ( @xmath18he , @xmath18he@xmath144 ) reactions . from the measured @xmath12-ray spectra , the level density of the five nuclear systems has been extracted .",
    "both the pt and au groups show a level density consistent with a constant - temperature description and characterized by the same temperature @xmath95 and @xmath145  mev , respectively .",
    "the isotopes with an unpaired neutron , i.  e.  @xmath5pt and @xmath6au , are characterized by an increased density of levels with respect to the other systems with an even number of neutrons .",
    "this same effect is visible in the entropy distribution .",
    "the entropy difference @xmath146 @xmath4 in the @xmath38pt pair is comparable to the value obtained in well deformed nuclei , meaning that the unpaired valence neutron has a comparable degree of freedom in terms of available orbital space .",
    "the entropy excess due to an unpaired proton @xmath147 @xmath4 is also of the same order as in actinides .",
    "we can conclude that transitional pt and au isotopes show the same statistical features of mid - shell deformed heavy nuclei : the residual nuclear interaction is dominated by pairing correlations , while shell effects are not noticed in spite of the vicinity of the @xmath127 shell closure .",
    "temperature and heat capacity have been deduced from the microcanonical ensemble formalism .",
    "sequential bumps in the caloric curve are fingerprints of consecutive breaking of nucleon cooper pairs in the heating nuclear system , showing a transition from an ordered to a disordered phase similar to the transition from superfluidity in liquids .",
