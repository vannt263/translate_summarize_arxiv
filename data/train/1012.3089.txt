    "the mass distribution of hydrogen atmosphere white dwarfs is strongly clustered around an average value of @xmath1 @xcite , as predicted by models of single star evolution .",
    "in addition to the pronounced peak at @xmath1 , a second peak at lower masses , @xmath2 , has been frequently found ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "given the evolutionary time scale of low - mass single main sequence stars that are supposed to form such low - mass ( @xmath0 ) white dwarfs significantly exceeds the hubble time , the existence of low - mass white dwarfs has been interpreted as the result of strong mass transfer interactions in binaries . in this scenario",
    "the more massive ( primary ) star in a main sequence binary fills its roche - lobe on the giant branch , and dynamical unstable mass transfer onto the less massive ( secondary ) star leads to the formation of a common envelope engulfing both the core of the primary star and the lower mass secondary star .",
    "orbital energy released due to the shrinkage of the binary orbit is supposed to rapidly expel the envelope , and may terminate the growth of the he core of the primary star before it reaches a sufficient mass for he - ignition .",
    "the outcome of this close binary evolution is a post - common envelope binary ( pceb ) consistent of a ( possibly low - mass he - core ) white dwarf and the ( basically unaltered ) low - mass secondary @xcite .",
    "the hypothetical binary origin of low - mass white dwarfs is observationally supported by the large fraction of low - mass white dwarfs in short orbital period double white dwarfs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , in neutron star - white dwarf binaries ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in subdwarf b star - white dwarf pairs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "however , also a fair number of apparently single low - mass white dwarfs are known that exhibit neither radial velocity variations , nor infrared flux excess , the typical hallmarks of white dwarfs with close companions @xcite . possible explanations for the existence of these systems include supernova type ia explosions in semi - detached close binaries that blow away the envelope of the companion thus exposing its low - mass core @xcite , severe mass - loss on the first giant branch @xcite that may even lead to the formation of low - mass white dwarfs with co - cores @xcite , stellar envelope ejection due to the spiral - in of close giant planets @xcite , or the merging of two very low - mass white dwarfs @xcite .",
    "so far , conclusive studies testing the close binary origin of low - mass white dwarfs have been prevented by the lack of a sufficiently large and homogeneous sample of pcebs .",
    "this is now rapidly changing thanks to the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) from which @xmath3 white dwarf / main sequence ( wdms ) binaries have been spectroscopically identified @xcite .",
    "this population of wdms binaries consists of wide systems whose stellar components did not interact and thus evolved like single stars , and close binaries that suffered from dynamically unstable mass transfer , i.e. pcebs . based on extensive radial velocity follow - up of the sdss wdms binary sample @xcite",
    ", we demonstrate here that the mass distribution of the white dwarfs in pcebs does indeed differ significantly from that of white dwarfs that do not undergo binary interactions , containing a large fraction of low - mass white dwarfs .",
    "sdss spectroscopy has been very efficient in identifying wdms binaries : 1602 systems were found in data release ( dr)6 by @xcite .",
    "several hundred more were discovered from a dedicated wdms segue ( the sdss extension for galactic understanding and exploration , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) survey ( nebot gmez - morn et al .",
    "2011a , a&a in prep . ) , and we are currently compiling the final addition of systems from dr7 ( rebassa - mansergas et al .",
    "2011 in prep . ) , taking the total number of wdms binaries in sdss to over 2000 .",
    "the system parameters of all the sdss / segue wdms binaries were determined by decomposing the sdss spectra into their white dwarf and companion star contributions , and subsequently fitting the white dwarf spectra with models .",
    "this procedure is described in detail in @xcite .",
    "however , intensive tests of our white dwarf fitting routine using sdss spectra of single white dwarfs ( see sect.[s - comp ] ) revealed that we over - estimated the errors on the white dwarf parameters by a factor @xmath4 .",
    "we have hence re - fitted all wdms binary spectra to obtain more realistic uncertainties of the white dwarf parameters .",

    "the complete table can be found in the electronic edition of the paper .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     a direct consequence of the selection effects outlined above is that the low - mass peak in the white dwarf mass distribution of pcebs ( fig.[f - wdmassdist ] ) is expected to be less pronounced .",
    "however , the detected excess of low - mass white dwarfs in pcebs remains as both close and wide wdms binaries are affected by the same bias . on the other hand , comparing white dwarf mass distributions of wide wdms binaries and single white dwarfs is somewhat affected as the bias towards the detection of low - mass white dwarfs in both subsamples is slightly different .",
    "this may partly explain the relatively low ks probability of @xmath5 per cent between the two distributions obtained in sect.[s - comp ] .      as discussed in more detail in @xcite ,",
    "very wide and not too distant wdms binaries can be resolved on their sdss images , and are herefore excluded from our wdms binary sample .",
    "this implies that we slightly overestimated the pceb fractions .",
    "however , this effect should not dramatically change our results , i.e. by not more than @xmath6 per cent @xcite .",
    "the main results found in the previous sections can be summarized as follows .",
    "white dwarf mass distributions of pcebs and wide wdms binaries differ significantly .",
    "while the former contains a much larger fraction of low - mass white dwarfs , the latter is similar to single white dwarf mass distributions .",
    "this is the so far strongest observational confirmation that large numbers of low - mass white dwarfs are formed due to binary interactions .",
    "however , even if we take into account observational biases and selection effects , @xmath70.5 - 10 per cent of the wide wdms binary sample also contains low - mass white dwarfs of unclear origin . in the following",
    "we discuss the implications of these results on white dwarf mass distributions in general and the origin of apparently single low - mass white dwarfs in particular .",
    "we have shown that the mass distribution of wide wdms binaries is similar to that of single white dwarfs .",
    "on the one hand , this might seem trivial to interpret as the primary in a wide binary should evolve into a white dwarf the same way a single star does . on the other hand ,",
    "the initial mass function ( imf ) of the primary stars in wide binaries and the imf of single stars are not necessarily identical .",
    "for example , the binary fraction of low - mass ( i.e. @xmath8 ) main sequence stars seems to depend on the mass of the primary star @xcite .",
    "however , here we need to consider only binary stars with primaries @xmath9 , as lower mass stars are still on the main sequence and have not yet evolved into white dwarfs .",
    "the measured binary fractions for solar type stars is @xmath10 per cent ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and similar fractions are obtained for higher mass stars @xcite .",
    "hence , it is not surprising that the white dwarf mass distribution of wide wdms binaries resembles the single white dwarf mass distribution and we may use it as a proxy for the single white dwarf mass distribution .",
    "in particular , the @xmath11 per cent of low - mass white dwarfs among wide wdms binaries ( table[t - final ] ) can be compared with the fraction of single low - mass white dwarfs .",
    "as mentioned in the introduction , a second peak at @xmath2 containing about @xmath12 per cent ( @xmath13 per cent if we take into account selection effects in sdss , see table[t - final ] ) of the systems has been frequently found in single white dwarf mass distributions ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* note that this peak is not obvious to the eye in fig.[f - wdmassdist2 ] , gray distribution , due to the size of the binning used ) .",
    "extensive radial velocity surveys have shown that about the half of these apparently single white dwarfs are in fact double degenerates ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) .",
    "the remaining @xmath4 per cent however , represent a population of low - mass white dwarfs that do not show any signs for a companion , i.e. no infrared excess and no radial velocity variations ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "possible explanations for the existence of these stars include severe mass - loss on the first giant branch @xcite , stellar envelope ejection due to nearby giant planets @xcite , the merging of two very low - mass white dwarfs @xcite , or supernova type ia explosions in semi - detached close binaries that blow away the envelope of the companion thus exposing its low - mass core @xcite .",
    "interestingly , the fraction of low - mass white dwarfs among wide wdms binaries estimated in sect.[s - seleff ] , i.e. @xmath11 per cent , resembles the typical @xmath13 per cent of low - mass white dwarfs among apparently single white dwarfs .",
    "given that hierarchical triple systems are a common configuration ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it appears plausible to assume that a significant fraction of the wide binaries containing a low - mass white dwarf are in fact triple systems , or descendants from triple systems , either containing close double degenerate primaries , or low - mass white dwarfs that formed from the merging of two very low - mass white dwarfs .",
    "indeed , a handful of triple systems containing a short - period double degenerate are known : wd1704 + 481 has been identified by @xcite and @xcite as a triple - degenerate , containing a he - core plus co - core close binary double degenerate with an orbital period of 0.1448d and a wide , average - mass co - core white dwarf companion .",
    "wd1824 + 040 ( g2115 ) is a similar triple , containing a close double - degenerate ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) with a 6.266d orbital period @xcite and a wide , cool white dwarf companion @xcite .",
    "even more relevant to the discussion here are pg1204 + 450 , a close double - degenerate @xcite with a period of 1.6d @xcite and a wide m4 companion @xcite , and pg1241010 , a close double - degenerate with a period of 3.3d @xcite and a wide m9 companion @xcite .",
    "therefore , a radial velocity survey of the low - mass white dwarfs among the wide binary candidates in our sample will be an interesting exercise . in the same way ,",
    "as the double degenerate scenario may account for low - mass white dwarfs in wide wdms binaries , the formation channel proposed by @xcite ( stellar envelope ejection due to nearby giant planets ) should work in wide binary systems .",
    "nearby planets exist around the stellar components of binary systems ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) and the presence of a wide companion does not affect the interaction between the planet and its host star . another possibility is given by the single star formation scenario for low - mass white dwarfs proposed by @xcite . if severe mass loss of the white dwarf progenitors on the first giant branch accounts for single low - mass white dwarfs , it should be present in wide binaries too as the stellar components of wide binaries evolve just like single stars .",
    "in contrast , the supernova ia channel proposed by @xcite appears to be unlikely to produce low - mass white dwarf primaries in wide binary systems .",
    "the explosion supposed to strip off the envelope should accelerate the core of the former secondary star far beyond the velocity required to escape from a wide m - dwarf companion .",
    "since large scale surveys such as the sdss or the spy ( the eso sn ia progenitor survey , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) provide spectra of thousands of white dwarf stars , fitting atmosphere models to observed spectra has become the most frequently used method to determine white dwarf masses ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the white dwarf masses used in this work have been obtained with such an algorithm combined with spectral decomposition methods @xcite .",
    "atmosphere model fits to optical spectroscopy are generally thought to provide reliable estimates of white dwarf masses , with the exception of the well known problems concerning cold white dwarfs mentioned above . for this reason",
    ", we have excluded white dwarfs with effective temperatures below @xmath14k , and by common standards , our white dwarf masses should be robust and reliable .    however , recent work suggest that there may be a systematic problem with mass determination from model atmosphere fits .",
    "@xcite presented gravitational redshift mass estimates for a sample of 41 white dwarfs in common proper motions pairs and noticed that their mean mass was slightly higher than in previous studies .",
    "more recently @xcite reported an average white dwarf mass of @xmath15  for 449 non - binary da white dwarfs from spy determined also from gravitational redshift measurements .",
    "this value is again significantly exceeding ( by @xmath16 ) the mean white dwarf masses that have been obtained from model atmosphere fits to large samples .",
    "a similar trend has been found by @xcite who incorporated improved physics of the stark broadening of the balmer lines in their white dwarf atmosphere models and obtained a mean white dwarf mass higher by @xmath17 .",
    "it seems hence that the previous work based on atmosphere models may have systematically underestimated the white dwarf masses .",
    "our white dwarf masses were determined based on the models of @xcite , which did not incorporate the new balmer line profiles of @xcite , and hence there is the possibility that our masses are systematically lower than the true white dwarf masses by @xmath18 .",
    "this would imply a slight decrease in the relative numbers of low - mass white dwarfs in wide binaries as the close binary fraction is increasing towards smaller masses below the mass limit of @xmath19 ( see fig.[f - detec ] ) .",
    "however , this effect can clearly not explain the existence of all alleged low - mass white dwarfs that appear not to be within close binaries .",
    "recently , a number of extremely low - mass white dwarfs ( @xmath20 ) have been found in double degenerates @xcite , including the first eclipsing double - degenerate binary @xcite .",
    "in contrast , we do not find any good candidate for such an ultra - low - mass white dwarf within the entire wdms binary sample .    for pcebs this difference might be related to the fact that the formation of very low - mass white dwarfs requires the progenitor of the white dwarf to fill its roche - lobe early on the first giant branch . while systems with relatively massive companions apparently can survive",
    "the resulting common envelope evolution , systems containing m - dwarf companions may instead merge ( as they must have smaller initial binary separations and consequently less orbital energy is available to expel the envelope of the primary ) .    in wide wdms binaries , the lack of extremely low - mass white dwarfs seems to indicate that a triple system consisting of a double degenerate primary ( of which at least one of the components is an extremely low - mass white dwarf ) with an m - dwarf secondary in a wide orbit ( sect.[s - disc2 ] ) , might not be a common configuration .",
    "one may finally speculate that the majority of all double degenerate primaries containing extremely low - mass white dwarfs have merged to form wide wdms binaries in which the resulting white dwarf mass is at least @xmath21 .",
    "the white dwarf mass distributions of pceb and wide wdms binary candidates are significantly different .",
    "while the mass distribution of wide wdms binary candidates resembles those of single white dwarfs , the pceb white dwarf mass distribution contains a large number of low - mass white dwarfs . taking into account both the pceb detection probabilities of the measurements and selection effects in sdss we find that the large majority of low - mass white dwarfs resides in close binary stars .",
    "this result confirms a crucial prediction of current theories of close binary evolution and provides the so far strongest observational evidence for common envelope evolution forming most close compact binary stars .    in agreement with the fraction of @xmath13 per cent",
    "apparently single low - mass white dwarfs identified in single white dwarf samples , @xmath11 per cent of the wide binaries in our sample seem to contain low - mass white dwarfs .",
    "these low - mass white dwarfs in wide binaries must have either formed due to exceptionally strong mass - loss of the primary progenitor on the first giant branch or are the descendants of triple systems , and some are expected to contain a close double degenerate primary component .",
