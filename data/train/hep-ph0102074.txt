    "measurement of the inclusive jet cross section is a fundamental test of qcd predictions .",
    "the fermilab @xmath6 collider , with @xmath7 = 1.8 tev , provides the highest energy collisions of any accelerator and the energies of the resulting jets cover the widest range of any experiment .",
    "comparison of the inclusive jet cross section to predictions provides information about parton distribution functions ( pdf s ) and the strong coupling constant , @xmath8 , for jet energies from 40 - 465 gev where the jet cross section changes by 10 orders of magnitude . at the highest jet @xmath2 ,",
    "this measurement probes a distance scale of the order of @xmath9  cm and has traditionally been used to search for new physics .    in this paper",
    "we present a new measurement of the inclusive differential cross - section for jet production at @xmath7 = 1.8 tev with the cdf detector@xcite .",
    "our previous measurement of the inclusive cross section@xcite using the run 1a data sample , ( 19.5 pb@xmath10 collected during 1992 - 1993 ) , showed a significant excess of the data over the available theoretical predictions at high @xmath2 . with",
    "substantially smaller data samples , measurements of the inclusive jet cross section prior to the run 1a result found good agreement with qcd predictions and provided the best limits on quark compositeness  @xcite .",
    "the run 1a result motivated a reevaluation of the theoretical uncertainties from the pdf s  @xcite and the derivation of a new pdf which specifically gave higher weight to the high @xmath2 cdf data points  @xcite .",
    "the measurement presented in this report uses the 87 pb@xmath10@xcite run 1b data sample ( 1994 - 1995 ) which is more than 4.5 times larger than for our previous result@xcite .",
    "comparisons are made to improved theoretical predictions and to the results of the d0 collaboration@xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section ii provides a discussion of the components of the theoretical predictions and a historical review of previous jet measurements .",
    "sections iii and iv describe the cdf detector and the data sample selection respectively . in section",
    "v the energy calibration and corrections to the data are presented .",
    "a discussion of the systematic uncertainties follows in section vi .",
    "section vii describes comparison of this data to previous results .",
    "section viii presents quantitative estimates of the theoretical uncertainties and section ix shows comparisons of the data to the predictions .",
    "the paper is concluded in section x.",
    "the suggestion that high energy hadron collisions would result in two jets of particles with the same momentum as the scattered partons  @xcite spawned an industry of comparisons between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions .",
    "the initial searches at the isr ( @xmath7 = 63 gev ) , provided hints of two - jet structure  @xcite .",
    "extraction of a jet signal was difficult because the sharing of the hadron momentum between the constituent partons reduced the effective available parton scattering energy and the remnants of the incident hadrons produced a background of low transverse energy particles .",
    "the first clear observation of two jet structure came at a collision energy of @xmath7 = 540 gev at the cern @xmath11 collider  @xcite along with the first measurements of the inclusive jet cross section .",
    "an increased data sample and improved triggering also led to the measurement of the inclusive jet cross section at the isr  @xcite .",
    "following these early results , improvements in accelerators produced both increased sample sizes and increased collision energies .",
    "higher energy collisions produce jets of higher energy particles .",
    "this facilitates separation of jet particles from the remnants of the initial hadrons ( called the underlying event ) and reduces the effects of the transverse spreading during fragmentation ( see for example  @xcite ) .",
    "figure  [ cdflego ] shows some events in the cdf calorimeter . in these `` lego '' plots the calorimeter is `` rolled out '' onto the @xmath12@xmath13 plane ; @xmath13 is the azimuthal angle around the beam and the pseudo - rapidity @xmath14ln[tan@xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the polar angle with respect to the incoming proton direction ( the @xmath17-axis ) .",
    "the tower height is proportional to the @xmath2 deposited in the tower .",
    "the darker and lighter shading of each tower corresponds to the @xmath2 of the electromagnetic and hadronic cells of the tower respectively .",
    "the oval around each clump of energy indicates the jet clustering cone .",
    "figure  [ cdfctc ] shows the tracks found in the cdf central magnetic tracking system for the same events .",
    "the jet structure in these events is unmistakable .",
    "note that while the low and high @xmath2 jets are well contained within the clustering cone , the highest @xmath2 jets ( @xmath18 400 gev ) are much narrower than the 40 - 60 gev jets .",
    "as the experimental measurements improved , more detailed and precise theoretical predictions were developed .",
    "when the energy of the collisions increases , the value of the strong coupling ( @xmath8 ) decreases , improving the validity of the perturbative expansion . at leading order ( o(@xmath19 ) )",
    "one parton from each incoming hadron participates in a collision that produces two outgoing partons .",
    "figures  [ cdflego ] and  [ cdfctc ] clearly show more than two jets in some events . to account for multijet ( more than 2 ) contributions , leading log monte carlo programs were built on the leading order tree level predictions by adding parton showers to the scattered partons .",
    "empirical models for the underlying event were included along with models for parton fragmentation into hadrons .",
    "nlo predictions for the inclusive jet cross section emerged in the late 80 s and leading order predictions for multijet events soon followed . here",
    "we first describe the components of the theory and then proceed with a discussion of the development of comparisons between data and theory .",
    "the cross section for a hard scattering between two incoming hadrons ( 1 + 2 @xmath20 3 + x ) to produce hadronic jets can be factorized into components from empirically determined pdf s , @xmath21 , and perturbatively calculated two - body scattering cross sections , @xmath22 .",
    "see , for example , reference  @xcite for a detailed discussion .",
    "this hadronic cross section is written as : @xmath23\\ ] ]    the pdf s , @xmath24 , describe the initial parton momentum as a fraction @xmath25 of the incident hadron momentum @xmath26 and a function of the factorization scale @xmath27 .",
    "the index @xmath28 refers to the type of parton ( gluons or quarks ) .",
    "the relative contribution of sub - processes , based on incoming partons , is shown in fig.[fig - subprocesses ] for cteq4 m  @xcite pdf s . at low @xmath29 ,",
    "jet production is dominated by @xmath30 ( @xmath31 ) and @xmath32 ( @xmath33 ) scattering . at high @xmath2",
    "it is largely @xmath34 ( @xmath35 ) scattering .",
    "the @xmath33 scattering is about 30% at @xmath36 gev because of the large color factor associated with the gluon .",
    "one of the essential features of qcd is that the momentum distributions of partons within the proton are universal . in other words ,",
    "the pdf s can be derived from any process and applied to other processes .",
    "the pdf s are derived from a global fit to scattering experiment data from a variety of scattering processes .",
    "well defined evolution procedures are used to extrapolate to different kinematic ranges .",
    "uncertainties from the pdf s result from uncertainty in the input data , the parameterizations of the parton momentum distributions .",
    "traditionally , the uncertainty in the inclusive jet cross section predictions from the uncertainty in the pdf s is estimated by comparing results with different current pdf s .",
    "this is discussed in detail in section viii .",
    "the hard two - body parton level cross section , @xmath22 , is only a function of the fractional momentum carried by each of the incident partons @xmath25 , the strong coupling parameter @xmath37 , and the renormalization scale @xmath38 characterizing the energy of the hard interaction .",
    "the two body cross sections can be calculated with perturbative qcd at leading order ( lo )  @xcite and more recently at next - to - leading order ( nlo )  @xcite . at leading order eight diagrams for the 2@xmath202 scattering process",
    "the nlo calculation includes the diagrams which describe the emission of a gluon as an internal loop and as a final state parton .",
    "the scales @xmath38 and @xmath27 are intrinsic uncertainties in a fixed order perturbation theory .",
    "typically , as in this paper , they are set equal  @xcite and we refer to them collectively as the @xmath39 scale .",
    "although the choice of @xmath39 scale is arbitrary , a reasonable choice is related to a physical observable such as the @xmath2 of the jets .",
    "predictions for the inclusive jet cross section depend on the choice of scale .",
    "no such dependence would exist if the perturbation theory were calculated to all orders .",
    "the addition of higher order terms in the calculation reduces the @xmath39 dependence .",
    "typically @xmath39 is taken as a constant ( usually between 0.5 and 2 ) times the jet @xmath2 resulting in roughly a factor of two variation in predicted cross section at lo and 30% at nlo  @xcite in the @xmath2 range considered .",
    "predictions for the jet cross section as a function of @xmath2 are obtained from the generalized cross section expression above : @xmath40 where the mass of the partons has been assumed to be zero ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath12 is the pseudo - rapidity (= rapidity for massless partons ) .",
    "experimentally , the inclusive jet cross section is defined as the number of jets in a bin of @xmath2 normalized by acceptance and integrated luminosity . as an inclusive quantity ,",
    "all the jets in each event which fall within the acceptance region contribute to the cross section measurement .",
    "typically , measurements are performed in a central ( @xmath421.0 ) rapidity interval .",
    "although many different experiments have measured the inclusive jet cross section , comparisons between experimental measurements and theoretical predictions have the same general structure .",
    "a qcd based monte carlo program generates partons which are then converted into jets of particles via a process called fragmentation or hadronization .",
    "the particles resulting from the soft interactions between the remnants of the collision ( underlying event ) are combined with the particles from the hard scattering .",
    "the fragmentation process and the remnants of the incident protons are not part of the theoretical cross section calculations .",
    "they are empirically determined from the data .",
    "the generated particles are traced through a detector and produce simulated data .",
    "jet identification algorithms ( or clustering algorithms ) were developed to optimize the correspondence between the jets found in the simulated data and the partons from which they originated .",
    "two fundamentally different techniques were developed , a nearest neighbor algorithm  @xcite and a cone algorithm  @xcite .",
    "reference  @xcite contains a detailed comparison .",
    "corrections to the measured data are derived based on the correspondence between the simulated jets and the originating partons .",
    "the corrected cross section is then compared to a series of parton level predictions in which parameters of the theory such as the @xmath39 scale or the pdf s are varied . systematic uncertainty in the experimental measurements",
    "is dominated by the uncertainty associated with producing realistic jets and underlying events for derivation of these corrections .",
    "the theoretical uncertainty in parton level predictions is dominated by uncertainty in the pdf s .",
    "we present below a brief history of the measurements and predictions of the inclusive jet cross section .",
    "the experimental and theoretical developments are fundamentally correlated since the corrections to the raw data depends on accurate modeling of the events which in turn depends on data sample size and quality of the data .",
    "the first measurements of the inclusive jet cross section  @xcite were made by the ua1 and ua2 collaborations .",
    "the first data sample  @xcite included a total of 59 events in the central rapidity region over an @xmath2 range of 20 - 70 gev .",
    "subsequent measurements by both the ua1 and ua2 collaborations  @xcite with larger data samples found the lo theory predictions to be compatible with the data .",
    "the uncertainty in the experimental results was dominated by uncertainty in the jet energy scale due to the steeply falling shape of the cross section .",
    "an estimated 10% total uncertainty on the jet energy scale resulted in a factor of two uncertainty on the corrected jet cross section  @xcite .",
    "both collaborations also performed studies of jet shapes , fragmentation models , the underlying event and different jet identification techniques  @xcite .",
    "the theoretical predictions for the jet cross section varied by a factor of two at low @xmath2 ( 30 gev ) and about a factor of ten at the highest @xmath2 ( 100 gev ) . within these uncertainties ,",
    "the theoretical predictions were in agreement with the results of both experiments over the @xmath2 range of 30 to 150 gev , where the cross section falls by 5 orders of magnitude .",
    "concurrent with the improved measurements , a more complete model of the events was developed .",
    "the monte carlo program isajet  @xcite included a leading log approximation for the effects of final state gluon radiation and the feynman - field independent fragmentation scheme .",
    "the leading log approximation generates improved qcd predictions over tree level calculations by including terms which represent the partons radiated along , or close to the initial scattered parton direction .",
    "wide angle , hard emissions are not included .",
    "the independent feynman - field fragmentation model was used to convert the parton shower into a jet of hadrons .",
    "note that the fragmentation and parton shower schemes are closely coupled in the transformation of partons into hadrons .",
    "if the parameters of the parton shower scheme are changed then the parameters in the fragmentation functions must also change to maintain overall consistency and agreement with data .",
    "detailed studies of jet shapes , fragmentation and particle multiplicities found that the isajet program provided an improved description of the data over simple fragmentation functions ( e.g. cylindrical phase space ) , but did not produce the correct amount of underlying event energy or energy at the jet edges  @xcite .",
    "significant deviations from the predictions at high @xmath2 might indicate the presence of quark substructure  @xcite .",
    "a new contact interaction was characterized in terms of the energy scale @xmath43 which represented the strength of this new interaction .",
    "most of the theoretical and experimental uncertainties were in the normalization while the presence of quark compositeness would produce a change in the shape of the spectrum at high @xmath2 . to avoid the largest theoretical uncertainties , the qcd predictions were normalized to the data in the low @xmath2 region , where the effects of the contact interaction were expected to be small .",
    "a model dependent limit of @xmath44275 gev was obtained  @xcite .",
    "studies of two - jet production properties such as the dijet mass and angular distributions were also performed  @xcite along with measurements of the structure and number of multijet ( 3 or 4 jets ) events  @xcite .    with the increase in the collision energy of the cern @xmath11 to @xmath7 = 630 gev and the collection of additional data , new measurements of the inclusive jet cross section  @xcite pushed the limits on quark compositeness to @xmath44415 gev  @xcite .",
    "uncertainties on the measurements and predictions were still large .",
    "typically the predictions varied by a factor of two due to the dependence on the @xmath39 scale , pdf s , and higher order corrections  @xcite .",
    "the experimental uncertainty was estimated at 70% with the largest component ( 50% ) coming from the uncertainty in modeling the events ( e.g. fragmentation , underlying events )  @xcite .",
    "the ratio of the cross sections at @xmath7=540 and 630 gev provide a test of scaling  @xcite .",
    "although many of the uncertainties canceled in the ratio , the remaining uncertainties were large enough that the data was consistent with both perfect scaling and with the non - scaling qcd effects  @xcite .    in the late eighties",
    "significant improvements in the comparisons between data and theory came from a variety of sources . from the theoretical front , nlo qcd predictions for the inclusive jet cross section became available  @xcite and the lo shower monte carlo programs were more sophisticated .",
    "the isajet program was upgraded to include the effects of initial state radiation .",
    "two new leading log monte carlo programs ( pythia  @xcite and herwig  @xcite ) were also developed with improved fragmentation schemes and both included initial and final state radiation .",
    "pythia was based on a string fragmentation model , while herwig used cluster fragmentation to generate the parton and hadron showers associated with the jets . on the experimental front",
    "the cdf collaboration began collecting data at a higher center of mass energy , @xmath7 = 1.8 tev , and the cern @xmath11 delivered larger data samples .",
    "the final measurement of the inclusive jet cross section from the cern @xmath11 used data collected by the ua2 collaboration  @xcite .",
    "statistical uncertainties were of order 10% , while the overall normalization uncertainty was 32% .",
    "comparisons to qcd predictions with a plethora of pdf s showed shape variations of order 30% .",
    "the corrections to the cross section used the pythia monte carlo  @xcite to generate the partons ( with initial and final state radiation ) and the jetset@xcite program for fragmentation .",
    "the largest component of the systematic uncertainty came from the model dependence of the acceptance and fragmentation corrections ( 25% ) .",
    "the underlying event was adjusted to agree with the data and contributed roughly 10% to the uncertainty at 60 gev and 5% at 130 gev .",
    "a pseudo - cone algorithm was used to identify jets .",
    "the standard nearest neighbor algorithm was used to form preclusters .",
    "then nearby preclusters within a large cone @xmath45 = @xmath46 and @xmath47 = 1.3 of each other were merged . only at the highest @xmath2 ( @xmath48100 gev ) were the statistical uncertainties dominant .",
    "the cross sections were also measured in forward rapidity regions .",
    "the ability of the theory to describe the data in these regions was marginal .",
    "a limit on the compositeness scale of @xmath44 825 gev was derived from the central region data using the most pessimistic pdf and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the first measurement of the inclusive jet cross section at @xmath7= 1800 gev was performed by the cdf collaboration and consisted of 16,300 clusters  @xcite .",
    "it spanned the @xmath2 range from 30 to 250 gev for the central rapidity region .",
    "the systematic uncertainties were largest at low @xmath2 , 70% at 30 gev compared to 34% at 250 gev .",
    "comparisons were made to lo predictions .",
    "the range of theoretical predictions using different pdf s , and @xmath39 scales was roughly a factor of three .",
    "the data was also compared to the results from other experiments  @xcite .",
    "uncertainties in the comparisons arose due to different clustering algorithms , different corrections for underlying events , showering outside the jet as well as overall normalization uncertainties .",
    "the non - scaling effects of qcd could not be confirmed with the comparison to the @xmath7= 630 data .",
    "however , the effects of qcd scale breaking could be observed by comparison to the @xmath49 63 gev data  @xcite .",
    "the nlo parton level predictions ushered in a new era of comparisons between data and theory .",
    "the inclusion of the o(@xmath50 ) contributions to the scattering cross section reduced the uncertainty due to the choice of @xmath39 scale  @xcite from roughly a factor of two to approximately 30% for @xmath39=2 - 0.5 times jet @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "more significantly however , the nlo calculations produce events with 2 or 3 partons in the final state",
    ". these partons could be grouped together ( clustered ) to produce a parton level approximation to a jet of hadrons .",
    "details of both these issues are discussed below .",
    "jet identification is a fundamental step in measurement of the inclusive jet cross section . with lo predictions",
    "there are two partons in the final state and each one is equated to a jet .",
    "these predictions have no dependence on jet finding algorithms or on jet shapes or size .",
    "however , the nlo predictions can have three partons in the final state and thus dependences on clustering can be investigated . to minimize the difference between nlo parton level predictions and measured jet properties , a clustering algorithm was defined which could be implemented for both situations  @xcite . in this algorithm ( called the snowmass algorithm ) , two partons which fall within a cone of radius r in @xmath12@xmath13 space ( r = @xmath46 and @xmath47 and @xmath51 are the separation of the partons in pseudo - rapidity and azimuthal angle ) are combined into a  jet \" . with this algorithm , two partons must be at least a distance of 2r apart to be considered as separate jets .",
    "if two partons are contained in a cone , then the @xmath2 of the resulting jet is the scalar sum of the @xmath2 of the individual partons . a similar algorithm ( described later ) with @xmath52 0.7",
    "is implemented in the experimental data analysis by using calorimeter towers ( shown in figure  [ cdflego ] ) in place of the partons .",
    "comparison of data to nlo predictions for jet shapes and the dependence of the cross section on cone size found that a consistent description of the cross section could only be obtained through the introduction of an additional parameter , @xmath53 into the theoretical calculations  @xcite .",
    "the @xmath53 parameter was intended to mimic the effects of cluster merging and separation employed for analysis of experimental data .",
    "this will be discussed in more detail in the description of the experimental algorithm and in the treatment of theoretical uncertainty .",
    "it is remarkable , however , that the nlo predictions , with only 2 or 3 partons in the final state , and the simple introduction of the @xmath53 parameter can give a reasonable description of the hadronic energy distribution within jets  @xcite , although each jet consists of 10 s of hadrons .",
    "the nlo predictions also changed the way the jet energy is corrected .",
    "in contrast to the lo predictions , the effect of parton energy lost outside the jet cone is modeled at the parton level .",
    "the corrections for this out - of - cone ( ooc ) energy which were used for comparison to lo predictions were highly dependent on the non - perturbative fragmentation models and were a large contributor to uncertainty in the corrected cross sections .",
    "when data are compared to nlo predictions , no correction for ooc energy is necessary .",
    "the nlo predictions for the inclusive jet cross section significantly reduced the dependence of the cross section on the choice of scale . for the usual range of @xmath54 @xmath55 to @xmath56 the variation in the prediction",
    "was reduced from a factor of two to about 20%  @xcite .",
    "however , a subtlety in the choice of scale also arose . at lo",
    "there are only two partons of equal @xmath2 . at nlo",
    "the partons may or may not be grouped together to form parton level jets , and @xmath57 and @xmath58 are not necessarily equal .",
    "thus , if the scale is to be the @xmath2 of each jet , there may be more than one scale for each event in the nlo calculations .    in previous publications  @xcite , and in the following chapters ,",
    "the cdf data is compared to the nlo predictions of reference  @xcite .",
    "this program analytically calculates the inclusive jet cross section at a specific @xmath2 . in the evaluation of the cross section ,",
    "the pdf s and subprocess cross sections and @xmath8 are all calculated at that @xmath2 . as a result , the cross section as a function of @xmath2 can be directly related to @xmath8 and even used as a measurement of the running of @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "more recently a nlo event generator , jetrad , was developed  @xcite .",
    "this program produces the energy - momentum four vectors for the two or three final state partons .",
    "these partons can be clustered together and treated as jets in a manner similar to the analytic predictions . for this program , it is necessary to have one weight per event , or in other words , one scale per event , rather than one scale per jet .",
    "the @xmath2 of the leading parton ( @xmath59 ) was chosen to set the scale since it is never the one to be clustered with the emitted gluon .",
    "in contrast to the normalization shifts associated with changing the @xmath39 scale from 0.5@xmath2 to 2@xmath2 , the effect of the using @xmath59 instead of @xmath2 jet introduces a small change in shape .",
    "the size of the effect ranges from about 4% ( smaller for @xmath59 ) at 100 gev to @xmath60 1% at 465 gev .",
    "below 100 gev the cross section with @xmath59 decreases more quickly ; at 50 gev the difference is about 6% .",
    "all of the predictions presented here use @xmath2 .",
    "comparisons of the theoretical predictions will be discussed in section viii .",
    "cdf measured the inclusive jet cross section with 30 @xmath61 of data collected in 1987  @xcite , 4 @xmath1 from 1989  @xcite and 19 @xmath1 from 1992 - 1992 ( run 1a )  @xcite . with each measurement",
    "the statistical and systematic uncertainties were reduced . the dijet angular distribution and",
    "the dijet mass spectrum were also compared to lo and nlo predictions  .",
    "these data were analyzed using clustering algorithms and corrections which were influenced by the intention to compare to nlo rather than lo predictions ( e.g. no correction of energy out side the jet cones ) . comparisons to data from ua1 and ua2 were complicated by the different clustering algorithms and corrections schemes ; cdf used a cone of r= 0.7 and did not correct for ooc while ua1 and ua2 used jet sizes of order r= 1 - 1.3 and made ooc corrections .",
    "measurement of the qcd scale breaking effects was possible with cdf data at 546 and 1800 gev  @xcite .",
    "measurements of multijet events showed that the newest shower monte carlo , herwig , could predict multijet rates and event properties up to 6 jets , but still lacked some contributions from wide angle scattering  @xcite      the nlo predictions significantly improved the agreement between data and theory for the inclusive cross section .",
    "two of the largest uncertainties were substantially reduced .",
    "one remaining issue is the modeling of the underlying event .",
    "typically the amount of background energy is estimated from minimum bias data ( data collected using only minimal requirements ) .",
    "however , no qcd based prediction , or even prescription is available .",
    "the collider detector at fermilab ( cdf ) @xcite is a combination of tracking systems inside a 1.4 t solenoidal magnetic field and surrounded by electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters and muon detection systems .",
    "figure  [ cdfpic ] shows a schematic view of one quarter of the cdf detector .",
    "the measurement of the inclusive jet cross section uses the calorimeters for measurement of the jet energies .",

    "it is roughly 60 cm long and covers the radial region from 3.0 to 7.9 cm .",
    "the @xmath62@xmath13 tracking information provided by the svx allows precise determination of the transverse position of the event vertex and contributes to the track momentum resolution . surrounding the svx is the vertex drift chamber ( vtx ) .",

    "the response functions give the relationship between the energy measured in a jet cone in the calorimeter and the true @xmath2 of the originating parton ( e.g. the sum of the particles in a cone of 0.7 around the original parton direction ) .",
    "if the calorimeter were perfectly linear the response functions would be derived simply from sum of the energy of the jet particles within a cone of r=0.7 . however , since our calorimeter is non - linear below 10 gev , the response to a jet depends on the @xmath99 spectrum of the particles in the jet . as a simple example",
    ", the response to a 30 gev jet is different if it is made of two 15 gev particles compared to six 5 gev particles .",
    "thus , to understand the calorimeter response to jets , we measure both the response to single particles ( calibration ) and the number and @xmath99 spectrum of the particles within a jet .",
    "corrections for the effect of the underlying event energy are included in the response functions : the true @xmath2 is defined before the underlying event is added while the measured @xmath2 contains the underlying event contribution .",
    "the amount of underlying event energy is measured in the data and is described later . as in previous analyses ,",
    "no correction is applied for the energy from the partons or fragmentation which falls outside the jet cone .",
    "estimates of this energy are fundamentally dependent on assumptions in theoretical models and are partially included in the nlo predictions . in the next two sections",

    ", ambient energy was measured in soft collisions ( e.g. the minimum bias sample discussed in section iv.a ) .",
    "comparison of these energy levels found that the jet events were significantly more active than the minimum bias events .",

    "it is appropriate to subtract only the energy from the soft collision .",

    "thus , we do not attempt to correct the jet energy scale or tune the monte carlo based on these results . rather , we take the agreement between the data and the detector simulation as an indication that the simulation does a good job reproducing the response of the detector to jets",

    "the uncertainties shown in fig .  [ fig - sys - uncertainties ] and parameterized in table  [ table - syserr ] are very similar in size and shape to the uncertainties quoted on the run 1a result  @xcite .",
    "the primary difference comes from the increased precision of the data at high @xmath2 providing tighter constraints on the curves .",
    "to compare the run 1b data to the run 1a result we use the smooth curve from run 1a to calculate the run 1a cross section at the run 1b @xmath2 points ( the run 1a and run 1b results used different binning ) .",
    "note that the statistical uncertainty on the run 1a measurement is roughly equivalent to the run 1b data below 150 gev due to the increased prescale factors in run 1b . above 150 gev , where no prescale factors were used ,",

    "the @xmath147 are up to eight parameters ( one for each systematic uncertainty ) that are adjusted in the fit to give good agreement between the data @xmath140 and the theory curve , @xmath142 .",
    "figure  [ fig - sys - uncertainties ] shows the systematic uncertainty curves , e.g. the @xmath148 . in the fitting process",
    ", the systematic uncertainties can be chosen individually or combined .",
    "a number of choices have led to this definition .",
    "1 ) the error curves represent the fractional change in cross section which results from 1@xmath149 shift in one of the inputs , e.g low @xmath150 hadron response , to the detector simulation , as discussed in section 6 .",
    "each of the uncertainty curves comes from an independent source .",
    "thus , the @xmath101 is increased by the quadrature sum of the shifts .",
    "2 ) the denominator is taken as the uncorrelated uncertainty in the data .",
    "this avoids complications in translating from the theoretical prediction ( which is produced as a cross section ) to the theoretical number of events .",
    "3 ) the shifts to the theory from the systematic uncertainties are computed as factors which multiply the theory predictions , as are the corrections from the raw cross section to the corrected cross section . when multiple systematic effects are considered , the net systematic shift is the sum of the individual shifts .",
    "the open circles in figure  [ fig-1a - a ] show the fractional difference between the 1b data points and the 1a curve ( ( 1b cross section - 1a curve)/1b cross section ) .",
    "the difference at low @xmath2 comes mainly from the different definition of the underlying event energy .    for the @xmath101 comparison between the run 1a and run 1b results , the uncorrelated uncertainty in both the run 1a and 1b measurements must be included . to estimate the uncertainty in the 1a measurement at the run 1b @xmath2 points",
    "we scale the corresponding 1b uncertainty . below 150 gev , since the uncorrelated uncertainties are similar , we simply use the 1b uncertainty for the 1a cross section . above 150 gev",
    ", the ratio of the luminosities for the data samples ( 87/19.5 ) indicates that the 1a uncertainty is a factor of 2.12 larger than the 1b uncertainty at the same @xmath2 point .",
    "using the quadrature sum of the run 1a and run 1b uncertainties has the effect of increasing the local ( uncorrelated ) uncertainty and produces lower a @xmath101 to a smooth curve . with only the uncorrelated uncertainties the @xmath101 between the 1b data and the 1a curve is 96.1 .",
    "if the relative normalization uncertainty between 1a and 1b is included ( 1.5% for 1a in quadrature with 2% for 1b ) the total @xmath101 is 42.9 for the 33 run 1b data points .",
    "the procedure presented above allows us to study the effects of the individual contributions to the comparison between data and theory .",
    "for example , the run 1a definition of the underlying event resulted in a smaller subtraction than was used for the run 1b data . if the underlying event uncertainty is included on the run 1b data , but no relative normalization uncertainty , the fit finds a total @xmath101 of 18.5 which includes a 0.7@xmath149 shift in the jet transverse energy from the underlying event .",
    "in other words , a change in the underlying event correction of 0.7@xmath149 (= 0.46 gev ) results in a @xmath101 of 18.5 . between run 1a and 1b the relevant uncertainties are the underlying event , the long term energy scale stability and the relative normalization .",

    "note that the low @xmath2 cdf points are plotted but not included in the following fit results .",
    "the @xmath101 between the cdf 1b data and d0 curve using only the statistical uncertainty from both experiments and the 2.7% normalization shift is 64.7 for the 29 cdf points .",
    "this drops to 35.6 when the combined normalization uncertainty on cdf ( 4.6% ) and d0 ( 6.1% ) is included in the fit .",
    "if all the systematic uncertainties on the cdf data are also included the total @xmath101 is 28.7 .",
    "we conclude that the cdf and d0 data are in good agreement .",
    "the d0 collaboration has published a comparison between the d0 data and the cdf curve from run 1a using a covariance matrix technique to include the cdf and d0 systematic uncertainties .",
    "the rather large @xmath151 ( 63.3 for 24 degrees of freedom , a confidence level ( cl ) of 0.002% ) obtained when the cdf curve was `` treated as theory '' is not surprising when one considers that no statistical uncertainties are included with the cdf curve and for the comparison to the highest @xmath2 point , the cdf curve is extrapolated 50 gev above the last cdf data point .",
    "in addition , the relative normalization difference between the two data sets is not included .",

    "when the systematic uncertainties in the covariance matrix are expanded to include both the d0 and cdf systematic uncertainties the @xmath151 equals 13.1 corresponding to a cl of @xmath152% .",
    "the predictions for the inclusive jet cross section depend on input parameters such as the parton distribution functions , the choice for the value of @xmath153 , the choice of renormalization and factorization scales and the method of grouping partons into jets . of these",
    ", the uncertainty from the parton distribution functions is the largest .    as in previous publications ,",
    "the primary program used by cdf for comparison with the data is due to ellis , kuntz and soper@xcite .",
    "we refer to this program as eks and use it to determine the uncertainty in the predictions .",
    "as discussed earlier , clustering at the parton level and clustering in the experimental data should be the same .",
    "in contrast to the parton level predictions , the experimental data contains jets of hadrons , and the edges of the jets are not distinct . figure  [ cdflego ] shows jet events in the the cdf calorimeter .",
    "jet identification in two jet events is straight forward .",
    "jet identification in multijet events , or in events in which the jets are close to each other introduces ambiguities which are not modeled in the nlo parton level predictions .",
    "for example , studies found that the experimental algorithm is more efficient at separating nearby jets  @xcite than the idealized snowmass algorithm .",
    "that is , two jets would be identified even though their centroids were separated by less than 2r .",
    "specifically , two jets are separated 50% of the time if they are 1.3r apart .",
    "an additional parameter , @xmath53 , was introduced in the qcd predictions to approximate the experimental effects of cluster merging and separation .",
    "partons within @xmath154 were merged into a jet , otherwise they were identified as two individual jets . a value of @xmath53 = 1.3 was found to give the best agreement with cross section and jet shape data@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig - eks - rsep ] shows the change in the nlo qcd predictions for a range of @xmath53 values .",
    "the ratio of cross sections for @xmath155 and @xmath156 shows a 5 - 7% normalization shift . the cross section is smaller with smaller because it essentially uses smaller effective cone size .",
    "naively , smaller cones would imply more jets and a larger cross section .",
    "however , with the steeply falling spectrum , the higher energy obtained by merging jets is the dominant factor .",
    "this result is consistent with the early results@xcite where the comparison used @xmath157 and different parton distribution functions .",
    "the nlo predictions in this paper from jetrad and eks follow the snowmass algorithm with the additional parameter @xmath53 . we use @xmath1581.3 unless otherwise indicated .",
    "the choice of @xmath39 is an intrinsic uncertainty in a fixed order perturbation theory .",
    "the effects of higher order corrections are typically estimated by the sensitivity of the predictions to variations in the choice of @xmath39 .",
    "fig.[fig - qcd ] shows the inclusive jet cross section where the @xmath39 scale is varied from @xmath159 to @xmath160 . above @xmath161 gev",
    "these changes result only in normalization changes of 5 - 20% .",
    "as described earlier , the eks and jetrad programs made different choices for the @xmath39 scale .",
    "the eks program calculates the cross section at a particular jet @xmath2 , integrating over all configurations that contribute .",
    "in contrast , for each event , the jetrad program uses @xmath59 , the @xmath2 of the maximum @xmath2 jet .",
    "we have calculated the inclusive jet cross section using both , @xmath162 and @xmath163 with the eks program  @xcite .",

    "the effect of using @xmath39=@xmath164 instead of @xmath39=@xmath56 ranges from @xmath18 4% at 100 gev to @xmath60 1% at 450 gev .",
    "the difference increases with decreasing @xmath2 because the second and third jets in the event constitute a larger ( but still small ) fraction of the jets in the bin .",
    "as the @xmath39 scale used in the @xmath165 convention is less than or equal to the maximum @xmath2 jet in an event , the cross section for the @xmath165 case is slightly larger ( @xmath8 is larger ) .",
    "the momentum distributions of the partons in the protons and antiprotons ( the pdf s ) are determined from global fits to data from different experiments and different kinematic ranges .",
    "the information about the quark distributions comes primarily from deep inelastic scattering ( dis ) and drell yan processes .",

    "below we present the comparison of the cdf data to the theoretical predictions .",

    "the main difference is that we now compare the raw data to theoretical predictions which have been smeared with detector resolution effects rather than compare unsmeared theoretical predictions to the corrected data .",
    "below we first show the comparisons with only uncorrelated uncertainties on the data .",

    "although the source of each uncertainty is independent of the others , the @xmath2 dependence of the uncertainty curves are quite similar .",

    "considering only the statistical uncertainties we see that the cteq4hj curve provides the best qualitative agreement with the data in overall shape and normalization ; cteq4 m agrees well with the data at low @xmath2 but is lower than the data above @xmath2 @xmath18 250 gev ; mrst disagrees in shape and normalization over the full @xmath2 range .",
    "comparison of the smeared theoretical predictions with the observed data rather than comparing corrected data to unsmeared predictions , is a more rigorous , although more cumbersome technique , but it has several advantages over the more traditional methods .",
    "first , the process of deriving the systematic uncertainty curves for the corrected cross section couples the systematic shift in the cross section due to its uncertainty with the statistical uncertainty in the data .",
    "figure  [ fig - syserrors - cdfstd ] shows the percent uncertainty from the corrected cross section ( the curves ) compared to the uncertainty on the raw cross section ( points ) .",
    "the differences are quite small ( @xmath603% ) but with statistical uncertainties of @xmath181% these differences can be important .",
    "second , the amount of smearing depends on the shape of the initial spectrum . where the spectrum is steep",
    ", more smearing will occur .",
    "thus , for each theoretical prediction it is necessary to derive the corresponding systematic uncertainty curves .    for comparisons of cdf jet data to theoretical predictions",

    "we noted earlier ( section vii ) that the data have a sufficient scatter that a smooth curve adjusted to follow the trends in the data  what we denote as the cdf standard curve  has a confidence level of 16% .",
    "thus , no theoretical prediction will have a better confidence level , and we expect that all will appear less likely based on this statistic . to enhance our sensitivity to differences in the various theoretical predictions , we use a @xmath190 technique .",

    "for example , a pseudo - theory curve can be created which is simply the standard curve plus a 1@xmath149 shift in the high pt pion response .",
    "when this curve is fit , the results are not 1@xmath149 for high pt pion and negligible shifts for the other systematics . rather , the @xmath101 penalty is spread over all the systematics , with a total contribution of 0.5 instead of 1.0 .",
    "this suggests that the individual fit parameters are not extremely meaningful .",
    "this whole procedure ignores the theoretical uncertainties , which we previously established as primarily normalization but with some shape as well .",
    "the procedure above was repeated but the normalization was allowed to be a free parameter .",
    "the results are shown in tables  [ table - chi1-derr - n ] and  [ table - parm - derr - n ] .      as discussed in section ix.a",
    ", tables  [ table - limited - sys - mrst3 ] and  [ table - limited - sys - cteq4a3 ] show the results of the fits between the raw jet cross section and the smeared theoretical predictions when a limited number of systematic uncertainties are used",
    ". the combination of uncertainties which produces the smallest @xmath101 can be the result of precise cancelations between the eight effects .",
    "although the sources of uncertainty are independent of each other , they produce similar changes in shape in the cross section .",
    "the fits are performed using 0 to eight systematic uncertainties .",
    "the best @xmath101s from all combinations of systematic uncertainties are given in the tables .",
