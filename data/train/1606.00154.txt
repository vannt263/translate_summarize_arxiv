    "the magnetic phase diagram of the itinerant helical magnet mnsi has been studied for over 40 years . from these studies ,",
    "a magneto - ordered phase in mnsi was identified as having a helical spin structure  @xcite , and a so - called a - phase was discovered  @xcite that later was recognized as a spin - skyrmion phase  @xcite .",
    "heat capacity , thermal expansion ( see for instance  @xcite and the references therein ) and elastic properties  @xcite measured across the phase - transition line at various magnetic fields led to the identification of the helical - paramagnetic phase transition at zero magnetic field as a fluctuation - induced weak first order transition  @xcite .",
    "though the volume and entropy change at the phase transition are so small ( @xmath1 , @xmath2 )  @xcite that this transition should be considered as `` extremely weak first order phase transition '' . indeed , for instance , a volume change at the weakest first order phase transitions in well - known examples , like ferromagnetic transition in mnas , the dielectric order - disorder transition in nh@xmath3cl , and ferroelectric transition in kdp is @xmath4 , @xmath5 , @xmath6 , respectively ( see refs .",
    "@xcite ) , which is at least two order of magnitudes larger than @xmath7 at the phase transition in mnsi .",
    "one might expect magnetic fluctuations to be suppressed with the application of magnetic fields , which could result in a change of character of the fluctuation - induced first order transition . in this case , the first order phase transition becomes second order at some point in @xmath8 , @xmath9 space , producing a tricritical point . in the mean field approximation , heat capacity ,",
    "thermal expansion coefficient and compressibility diverge at the tricritical point as a power law with a temperature exponent @xmath10 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "the fluctuation correction should be small in this case because the upper critical dimension @xmath11 at a tricritical point ; whereas , at an ordinary second order transition @xmath12 ( ref .  @xcite ) . on the basis of a change of form of heat capacity at the phase transition , a recent paper  @xcite , argued for the discovery of a tricritical point on the @xmath13 transition line in mnsi",
    "; however , there was no tendency for the heat capacity to diverge .",
    "moreover , ultrasound studies have revealed a striking increase of elastic moduli in the @xmath13 region corresponding to the proposed tricritical point where the elastic moduli should decrease or the elastic compliance should increase  @xcite . with this unresolved issue , it is appropriate to take a closer look at the situation .    to this end , thermal expansion and forced magnetostriction of mnsi were measured as a function of temperature and magnetic field . though similar measurements were reported earlier in refs .",
    "@xcite , the current measurements were performed in more detail with an emphasis on exploring the disputed region .",
    "the main surprising result of this study is a decrease of the extremely small length ( volume ) discontinuity at the magnetic phase transition in mnsi with application of magnetic field to a value @xmath0 and the apparent sudden jump of the discontinuity to zero .",
    "because no specific features identifying a tricritical point were observed in these experiments , the field - dependent evolution of the volume discontinuity raises the question of whether extremely weak first order phase transitions with immeasurably small volume and entropy discontinuities may exist  @xcite . in our particular case",
    "the answer is negative .",

    "a change of slope at @xmath18 is the result of a transformation from the conical phase to a field - induced ferromagnetic phase .",

    "a quantum design physical property measurement system ( ppms ) and a capacity dilatometer  @xcite with a resolution of @xmath19  mm were employed in these experiment .",
    "a single crystal of mnsi @xmath20  mm in diameter and @xmath21 in height , grown by the bridgman technique , was used .",
    "the dilatometer holder permitted measurements of the sample strains both in `` longitudinal '' and `` transverse '' orientations , that is , when the magnetic field was parallel or perpendicular to a direction of the length measurement . in the current experiment ,",
    "the sample length was always measured in the [ 110 ] direction , whereas magnetic field was directed along [ 110 ] or [ 100 ] .",
    "quite a number of experimental runs determined the thermal expansion at constant magnetic fields and the forced magnetostriction at constant temperatures .",
    "important selected results are shown in figs .",

    "the discontinuity curves are terminated at 0.26 t , where the discontinuities virtually disappeared .",
    "the expansivity peaks can be still observed at least to 0.43 t. a plateau in the range @xmath26  t ( a ) and a local maximum at @xmath27  t ( b ) are related to the existence of the skyrmion a - phase ( see fig .",
    "[ fig3]),width=302 ]    .",
    "the small length discontinuities in thermal expansion curves , manifesting a first order phase transition in mnsi , are situated on an otherwise very steep slope ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this situation makes it difficult to evaluate directly the magnitudes of jumps and their change with magnetic field .    to analyze the evolution of the first order volume ( or length ) discontinuity in mnsi with applied magnetic field ,",
    "we subtract a background contribution . noting that the dependence of @xmath24 in the paramagnetic phase of mnsi in the vicinity of its phase transition can approximated by linear functions , we subtract these functions from the original data .",
    "the result is illustrated by fig .",
    "as is seen there , the magnitude of the slightly broadened length discontinuity decreases with applied magnetic field , and at about @xmath25  t the form of the reduced thermal expansion curves changes qualitatively ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) .",
    "the discontinuities are replaced by broad anomalies .",
    "these anomalies can be still seen at about 0.43 t as evidenced in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , where the thermal expansivity of mnsi is displayed in a limited range of magnetic fields .",
    "the decaying anomaly obviously associated with the one under discussion can be even traced to 0.6  t from the ultrasound studies  @xcite .",
    "the sample length discontinuities as function of magnetic field , determined from data in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] , are shown in figs .",
    "[ fig6 ] a and b. it is noteworthy that the discontinuity variations are closely correlated with peak amplitudes of thermal expansivity ( fig .  [ fig5 ] ) . some remarkable features in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] should be pointed out .",
    "first , in a configuration where the magnetic field is directed along [ 110 ] and the linear expansion is measured along [ 100 ] , @xmath14 initially grows ; whereas , in the parallel configuration ( @xmath9 , @xmath28 $ ] ) @xmath14 probably decreases from beginning .",
    "this situation obviously is connected with a specifics of the longitudinal and transverse magneto - striction in mnsi at low magnetic fields ( see fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "second , a plateau in the range @xmath26  t ( fig .  [ fig6]a ) and a local anomaly at @xmath29  t ( fig .  [ fig6]b ) are related to the existence of the skyrmion a - phase .",
    "third , the sample length discontinuity seemingly drops to zero from the finite value(@xmath30 ) at @xmath25  t. the forced magnetostriction measurements ( figs .",
    "[ fig2 ] ,  [ fig3 ] ) confirm a lack of first order features at the conical to induced ferromagnetic phase transition on isotherms at 28.6 k and below . a sharp change of slope in the magnetostriction curves identifies a transition of the conical spin structure to field - induced ferromagnetic spin order  @xcite .",
    "this transition is associated with tiny dips , which can be seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] . at the same time , a first order phase transition on the boundary of skyrmion formation is clearly seen ( fig .  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "a first order phase transition with a finite jump in thermodynamic quantities across a phase border can not be terminated without continuation .",
    "normally , a first order phase transition may end in a tricritical point with @xmath31 and @xmath32 .",
    "then , a phase transition may continue as a second order transition ; however , finite values of @xmath33 , and hence @xmath34 , at the termination point , a lack of divergence of thermal expansivity @xmath23 and an unusual deterioration of the related peaks , which should indicate a second order transition , prevent us from accepting this scenario  @xcite . instead , we hypothesize that the frenkel concept of heterophase fluctuations may be applicable  @xcite .",
    "heterophase fluctuations , similar to quenched impurities , smear a first order phase transition starting at some critical value of magnetic field .",
    "consequently , one may expect an enhancement of these fluctuations and deterioration of peaks in thermal expansivity , heat capacity , etc . with magnetic field .",
    "the smeared phase transition itself , however , would still exist as it follows from the magnetostriction measurements ( see figs",
    ".  [ fig2 ] ,  [ fig3 ] ) .",
    "thermal expansion and forced magnetostriction of mnsi were measured as a function of temperature to 5  k and magnetic field to 3  t. a small length ( volume ) discontinuity at the magnetic phase transition in mnsi decreases with application of magnetic field to a value @xmath0 , and then suddenly the discontinuity seemingly jumps to zero .",
    "thermal expansivity peaks strongly deteriorate with magnetic field .",
    "no specific features identifying a tricritical point were observed .",
    "we propose that the frenkel concept of heterophase fluctuations  @xcite may be relevant in the current case .",
    "therefore , we suggest that the magnetic phase transition in mnsi always remains first order at any temperature and magnetic field ( see also  @xcite ) , but the transition is progressively smoothed by heterophase fluctuations .",
    "these results question the applicability of a model of a fluctuation - induced first order phase transition in mnsi .",
    "probably , a model of coupling of an order parameter with other degrees of freedom is more appropriate ( see  @xcite ) .",
