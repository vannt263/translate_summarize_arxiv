    "the goal of this paper is to show that the rational homotopy lie algebra of a variety ( defined in section [ sec : rhbd ] ) carries a motivic structure in the sense of nori .",
    "this is formalized as follows . if @xmath1 is an embedding of a field @xmath2 into the complex numbers then nori ( see @xcite and @xcite ) defines an abelian tensor category of effective homological motives over @xmath2 , called @xmath3 .",
    "let @xmath4 the abelian category of chain complexes of motives .",
    "to say that @xmath5 carries a motivic structure means that @xmath5 is an object in @xmath6 and that @xmath7 is an object of @xmath8 .",
    "nori uses his basic lemma @xcite to construct a functor which assigns to any variety a complex of motives .",
    "a simpler case of this construction occurs when one considers the category of affine varieties .",
    "we denote this functor by @xmath9 .",
    "the restriction to affine varieties is not too severe thanks to `` jouanolou s trick '' ( see @xcite ) : for any quasi - projective variety @xmath5 over a field @xmath2 , there exists an affine variety @xmath10 over @xmath2 and a morphism @xmath11 which is a zariski locally trivial fibration with fibers isomorphic to @xmath12 .",
    "since the affine fibers are contractible , @xmath10 is homotopy equivalent to @xmath5 .",
    "nori also provides realization functors from @xmath3 to the category of mixed hodge structures and to the category of galois representations .",
    "let @xmath6 be the category of chain complexes in @xmath3 .",
    "there is a forgetful functor , @xmath13 from @xmath3 to abelian groups ( and thus a forgetful functor from @xmath6 to chain complexes of abelian groups ) , such that @xmath14 where @xmath15 denotes the singular homology of the topological space @xmath16 .    in this paper",
    "we provide a functor @xmath17 which associates to any affine variety , @xmath5 , a differential graded lie algebra ( d.g.l . ) , @xmath18 in @xmath6 , such that if the variety is simply connected then the homology of the d.g.l .",
    "computes the rational homotopy lie algebra , that is @xmath19 as graded lie algebras . the known topological techniques for producing such a lie algebra all use a coalgebra analogous to that of singular chains with the alexander - whitney map or the wedge product of forms .",
    "this functor , @xmath17 , comes from an underlying combinatorial construction on geometric objects , and is perhaps the simplest lie algebra one can construct from a simplicial object in an abelian category which is representable ( i.e. it can be extended to the category of finite sets with all morphisms , not just order preserving maps . ) applying the construction with singular chains to any topological space yields a new method of producing a d.g.l . which computes the rational homotopy lie algebra .",
    "this functorial construction has several applications .",
    "first , since nori s category of motives has realization functors , our functor gives rise to a galois structure on the homotopy lie algebra after tensoring with @xmath20 .",
    "previously there was the mixed hodge structure provided by hain , but since he uses the graded commutative algebra structure of the derham complex , his techniques were not easily adapted to the case of tale cohomology and galois representations .",
    "second , we pave the way for a motivic study of extensions arising from higher rational homotopy theory ",
    "analogous to hain s work with extensions of mixed hodge structures arising from the fundamental group @xcite .",
    "the serious difficulty in showing that the rational homotopy lie algebra of a variety has a motivic structure reduces to the fact that although there is a motivic analog of the eilenberg - zilber map @xmath21 which is a quasi - isomorphism , there is no map in the other direction corresponding to the alexander - whitney map . without the alexander - whitney map",
    "there is no coalgebra structure on motivic chains .",
    "it is unreasonable to expect a splitting of this map ( like the alexander - whitney map ) in a category of motives ( otherwise the splitting forces non - zero extension classes to vanish ) .",
    "thus @xmath22 does not have the structure of a coalgebra , in contrast to the topological case , where one has maps on singular chains @xmath23 put another way  it is clear how to take two cycles and produce a cycle on the product , but not vice versa .",
    "thus much of the machinery of algebraic topology ( in our case in particular anything related to differential graded hopf algebras ) can not be reproduced in the motivic category without much work .",
    "although we have no coalgebra , we still have a map @xmath24 which is @xmath25 equivariant . in some ways",
    "the key to this paper is that this @xmath25equivariance is enough to get a lie algebra and that we do nt need ( or have ) a coalgebra structure .",
    "one crucial point is that when @xmath26 is a graded vector space , considering the tensor algebra @xmath27 as a differential graded hopf algebra , the primitive lie algebra in @xmath27 coincides with the free lie algebra on @xmath26 , @xmath28  and this can be obtained as the _ image _ of a projector defined in terms of the @xmath25 action on @xmath29 .",
    "this is crucial because defining this lie algebra as primitives of a co - multiplication map would require a map @xmath30 which does not exist since there is no map @xmath31 .",
    "the construction of @xmath17 is very simple and combinatorial in nature .",
    "it has not been previously discussed before probably because : 1 . algebraic topologists would have no need to make this construction with the presence of the alexander whitney map ( and thus the rich structure of hopf algebras @xcite ) 2 .",
    "this construction lives outside of the simplicial category as we need to consider _ all _ maps between finite sets 3 .",
    "algebraic geometers such as @xcite would make use of commutative algebras such as those arising from differential forms .",
    "several others have worked on related problems : cushman s thesis , which produced a motivic structure on the group ring of the fundamental group completed at the augmentation ideal @xcite , provided a crucial idea that the geometric cobar complex could be used in nori s category to compute the homology of the loop space . in the setting of mixed hodge structures , building on the work of chen ,",
    "hain showed that for any variety over @xmath32 , the malcev completion of the fundamental group and the rational homotopy lie algebra ( in the simply connected case ) carry mixed hodge structures @xcite .",
    "this work was further pursued by wojtkowiak , who stressed the usefulness of using cosimplicial varieties @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    ", we lay out the categorical framework which we find most convenient to describe the d.g.l . and develop the algebraic identities in the category of abelian groups which are used to deduce identities in a more general additive category @xmath33 . in section 3",
    "we give the construction of the d.g.l . in @xmath33 . in section 4",
    "we specialize to the category of effective homological motives .",
    "we summarize without proof many of the properties of nori s construction of motives .",
    "this section reduces the problem to the case of singular chains , and thus to a problem in topology . in section 5",
    "we compare this construction with the work of hain to show that the forgetful functor applied to the d.g.l . in @xmath6",
    "gives a complex which computes the rational homotopy of a @xmath0-connected variety .",
    "the key mathematics in this work is in section 3 , in particular section 3.2 , where we show @xmath17 is closed under its differential @xmath34 .",
    "note that in diagram @xmath35 is not @xmath36 !",
    "much of the insight needed to prove this theorem was obtained by constructing this @xmath35  by hand \" .",
    "this was related to studying base - point dependency in the study of extensions of motives arising from the fundamental group of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "the author would like to thank madhav nori for his help , inspiration , and support .",
    "let @xmath38 be the category whose objects are finite sets and whose morphisms are all set maps ( not just order preserving maps ) .",
    "very contrary to the simplicial literature , we let @xmath39 $ ] denote a finite set with @xmath40 elements labelled @xmath41 .",
    "the symmetric group on @xmath40 letters , @xmath25 , is the set of all bijections from @xmath39 $ ] to @xmath39 $ ] .",
    "since elements of @xmath25 are maps , we think of @xmath25 as acting on the left on @xmath39 $ ] . given a functor @xmath42 to some category @xmath43 , the left @xmath25 action on @xmath39 $ ] becomes a right @xmath25 action on @xmath44)$ ] .",
    "often we will want to take linear combinations of maps of objects that have no abelian group structure . to do this , given a category @xmath43 we construct a new category @xmath45 ( or just @xmath46 if @xmath43 is understood ) .",
    "the objects of @xmath46 are the same as those of @xmath43 but we define @xmath47 this gives an additive category where one can make sense of the notion of the composite of two maps being zero",
    ". we may also tensor with @xmath48 to give @xmath49 the structure of a vector space . by definition",
    "an additive category has a zero object and a product structure .",

    "furthermore , if @xmath53 is a functor to an additive category , then the functor automatically extends uniquely to a functor @xmath54 .",
