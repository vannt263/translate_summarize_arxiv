    "sagittarius b2 ( sgr  b2 ) is a giant molecular cloud complex near the centre of the galaxy .",
    "there is spectacular star - formation activity , much of it deeply embedded in molecular cores , as traced by the high far - infrared luminosity , compact and ultracompact h ii regions @xcite , with maser emission from water @xcite , hydroxyl @xcite , formaldehyde @xcite and methanol , both class i and class ii @xcite .",
    "three major star - forming centres are located in a north - south line , labelled north , middle and south , sgr  b2 ( n ) , ( m ) and ( s ) , which have strong continuum radio h ii region free - free emission , and submillimetre and millimetre wavelength thermal dust emission @xcite .",
    "these cores are surrounded by a larger , less dense envelope .",
    "the hot cores sgr  b2 ( n ) and ( m ) are particularly rich in molecules , and so have been the targets of many millimetre spectral - line surveys @xcite . the primos survey with the greenbank telescope ( gbt )",
    "will survey sgr  b2 ( n ) over the whole band from 300  mhz to 50  ghz @xcite .",
    "sgr b2 is one of the most prominent features of the central molecular zone ( cmz ) , the bar - shaped @xcite molecular region in the central few hundred pc of the galaxy , as shown in emission of @xmath6co , @xmath7co @xcite , cs @xcite and hnco @xcite , for example .",
    "the distance to sgr b2 has been measured as @xmath8  kpc by @xcite , with the proper motion suggesting that sgr b2 is nearer by 0.13  kpc than the galactic centre , and the projected distance from the galactic centre is 0.09  kpc . for calculations ,",
    "we assume a distance to sgr b2 of @xmath9  kpc",
    ".    the sgr b2 molecular cloud has complex kinematics , with the densest core centred on sgr b2 ( m ) at velocity 60 - 65 km  s@xmath2 , and this area corresponding to a ` hole ' in the emission in co and cs at 40 - 50 km  s@xmath2 @xcite .",
    "this has been interpreted by @xcite as a cloud - cloud collision between a clump at 70 - 80 km  s@xmath2 , and the 40 - 50 km  s@xmath2 cloud triggering the current star formation : the collision changes the velocity of material , leaving a deficit ( the hole ) in the 40 - 50 km  s@xmath2 range , as material shifts to the intermediate velocity of the 60 - 65 km  s@xmath2 range .",
    "the spatial distribution in the sgr b2 molecular cloud is also complex , but can be largely described by a ridge of emission in a north - south line near the sgr  b2 ( n ) , ( m ) and ( s ) hot cores , or centred to the west of these cores @xcite .",
    "this ridge continues to a peak 1 arcmin north of sgr  b2 ( n ) , the ` north cloud ' which is enhanced in hnco and hoco@xmath3 @xcite , possibly associated with the shock of the cloud - cloud collision .",
    "this ridge of emission coincides with the sgr b2 extended envelope , as traced by sub - mm dust emission @xcite .    in this paper , we present results of imaging the sgr  b2 region ( @xmath0  arcmin@xmath10 ) in multiple spectral lines , over 30 to 50 ghz ( the 7-mm band ) , using the mopra telescope .",
    "this follows on a similar spectral - line imaging survey of sgr  b2 in the 3-mm band , presented as @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "this study provides spatially resolved line distributions of a large number of molecules and transitions to constrain chemical models of the sgr b2 complex .",
    "the observations were made with the 22-m mopra radio telescope , of the australia telescope national facility ( atnf ) using the unsw - mops digital filterbank .",
    "the mopra mmic receiver has a bandwidth of 8 ghz , and the mops backend can cover the full 8-ghz range in the broad band mode .",
    "this gives four 2.2-ghz sub - bands each with 8192 channels of 0.27 mhz .",
    "there is also a zoom mode with up to sixteen spectra ( up to four in each 2.2-ghz sub - band ) of width 137 mhz .",
    "this provides higher spectral resolution with 4096 channels of 0.033 mhz in each zoom spectrum .",
    "we chose the broad band mode , as the lines in sgr  b2 are wide , so that the 0.27 mhz channels , corresponding to around 1.6 to 2.7 km  s@xmath2 , are quite adequate to resolve their structure .",
    "this mode also allowed a complete line - mapping survey to be made , without pre - selecting which lines would be covered , or the restrictions of selecting at most four lines in each 2.2 ghz sub - band .",
    "the mopra receiver covers the range 30 to 50 ghz in the so - called 7-mm band , so the band actually covers wavelengths 6 to 10 mm .",
    "we chose three tunings centred at 45.7 , 38.0 and 34.1 ghz , to cover the range whole 30 to 50 ghz range .",
    "the latter two tunings overlap , with two 2.2 ghz sub - bands in common in the range 34 to 38 ghz .",
    "the area was observed with on - the - fly ( otf ) mapping , in an area @xmath0 arcmin@xmath10 , centred near sgr  b2  ( n ) and ( m ) , in a similar way to that described in @xcite .",
    "however , unlike the 3-mm imaging of @xcite , we used galactic coordinates for the scan direction , and hence the square scan area .",
    "we used position switching for bandpass calibration with the off - source reference position observed before each 6 arcmin long source scan .",
    "the system temperature was calibrated with a noise diode .",
    "the 7-mm mopra system does not use paddle scans ( unlike the 3-mm system ) , and hence does not correct for the absorption through the atmosphere .",
    "this effect on calibration is around the 10 percent level , so we take that as the major uncertainty in the data .",
    "the otf data were turned into fits data cubes with the livedata and gridzilla packages .",
    "the raw data files in rpfits format , were bandpass corrected using the off - source reference spectra with livedata , a robust second order polynomial fitted to the baseline and subtracted , and the data output as sdfits @xcite spectra .",
    "these spectra were then gridded into datacubes using gridzilla , with a median filter for the interpolation .",
    "the median was used , as this is much more robust to the effect of bad data .",
    "the whole 8-ghz band for each tuning was first turned into four cubes with frequency pixels for the 2.2-ghz sub - bands , making twelve cubes overall covering the entire 30 to 50 ghz range .",
    "these were used to conduct a full line survey in this spectral range .",
    "we compiled a list of the strongest ( identified ) lines , as given in table [ tab : lines_table ] .",
    "the gridzilla scripts also allowed the lines ( table [ tab : lines_table ] ) to be specfied , with their rest frequencies , so that the gridzilla output provides fits cubes with velocity coordinates .",
    "we used this for a second pass through the data , to produce individual cubes for each line , over a velocity range -300 to 300 km  s@xmath2 .",
    "for the data over the frequency range 34 to 38 ghz , where two of the tunings overlapped , we combined the data from both observations to improve the signal - to - noise .",
    "the fits cubes were then read into the miriad @xcite package for further processing and analysis .",
    "as the emission is typically of low surface brightness , the data were smoothed in velocity , with a 3-point hanning kernel , to make data cubes with improved surface brightness sensitivity .",
    "this gives around 0.54 mhz , or 3.2 to 5.4 km  s@xmath2 effective fwhm spectral resolution ( across the spectral range ) , and ensures the data are nyquist sampled in velocity .",
    "the resolution of the mopra beam in the 7-mm band was recently measured by @xcite to vary between 0.99  arcmin at 49  ghz and 1.37  arcmin at 31  ghz , or roughly @xmath11 ( where @xmath12 is the 22-m dish diameter ) .",
    "we will assume these values to give resolution between 1.0 arcmin at 50 ghz , and 1.4 arcmin at 30 ghz , with the caveats that : a ) this is somewhat smaller than previously quoted in the mopra documentation as 82 arcsec ( 1.37 arcmin ) at 42 ghz , and ; b ) actually gives a somewhat flatter variation than expected from @xmath13 .",
    "since we are mostly concerned in this paper with the spatial and velocity structure , we have left the intensities in the t@xmath14 scale , without correction for the main beam efficiency onto the t@xmath15 scale .",
    "the measured main beam efficiencies @xmath16 vary between 43 and 53  percent within the range 31 to 49 ghz , and extended beam efficiencies @xmath17 from 56 to 69  percent @xcite .",
    "we have produced data cubes for the 47 strongest lines in the 30 to 50 ghz range , as listed in table [ tab : lines_table ] .",
    "the flag in the last column of table [ tab : lines_table ] refers to the source of the line identification .",
    "most are from the nist database of lines known in the interstellar medium @xcite .",
    "as sgr  b2 is among the richest known sources of interstellar lines , these lines are mostly already well - known in sgr  b2 .",
    "there are also some radio recombination lines , taken from the splatalogue compilation .",
    "we have identified several lines in the jpl database @xcite corresponding to other transitions of molecules ( ch@xmath4nh , nh@xmath4cho , nh@xmath4cn , ch@xmath5cho ) known in sgr  b2 from other frequencies , notably in the 3-mm band in @xcite .",
    "there are also a few other weaker lines detected ( mostly at the sgr  b2 ( n ) and ( m ) cores ) , but as they are quite weak and we do not have confident line identifications , we not consider them further here .",
    "other projects are in progress to obtain line survey data for sgr  b2 , notably the primos survey with the 100-m green bank telescope ( gbt ) of sgr  b2  ( n ) which will cover this 7-mm band @xcite .",
    "these line surveys have longer integration time and higher sensitivity , and are better for studying the weak lines in the cores than the mapping observations presented here .",
    ".summary of strong lines detected in the mopra observations .",
    "the first column gives an approximate frequency we have used for labelling transitions in this paper .",
    "the second column identifies the species , and the third its transition .",
    "the last columns indicates the rest frequency and the database used for the identification : l , lovas : s , splatalogue ; j , jpl ( see text ) .",
    "the rest frequencies with a * indicate the frequency used for lines corresponding to multiple transitions , most also indicated as group ( gp ) in the transition list . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     for the free - free component , we find spectral indices of @xmath18 , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 for the components sgr  b2 ( n ) , ( m ) , ( s ) and the extended envelope respectively , and flux densities at 30 ghz 7.1 jy , 9.9 jy , 0.62 jy and 17.7 jy respectively .",
    "note that this indicates that around half the flux is in the extended component which may be missed by the interferometric observations ( e.g. fig [ fig : rrl_7mm_overlay ] ) .",
    "we do attribute the radio emission from 3 to 100 ghz in the compact components to optically thin free - free emission , with basically a flat spectrum , although the rising spectrum of sgr  b2 ( m ) may indicate some of the subcomponents are ultracompact h ii regions with the turnover from optically thick to optically thin above 10 ghz .",
    "the spectrum of the total sgr  b2 flux is flat ( spectral index @xmath22 ) , but when we subtract the compact components , notably sgr  b2 ( m ) with the rising spectrum , the residual extended component has a somewhat steeper spectrum .",
    "there has been some discussion of non - thermal radio emission from sgr  b2 by @xcite , @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we agree with @xcite and @xcite that due to the complex structure of sgr  b2 , it is difficult to measure the radio spectral index accurately by combining observations with different resolutions which may be including different features . in particular , the fluxes measured with the gbt by @xcite for sgr  b2 ( n ) will include flux from the extended component , to a greater extent at the lower frequencies with the larger beam .",
    "the fits to the dust components , for three free parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 gave similar results to that of @xcite , as expected since the data used here is based on their compilation .",
    "however , there are quite large uncertainties in derived @xmath24 and @xmath25 , and the two parameters are highly correlated .",
    "we decided , therefore , to constrain the fits by using a fixed derived value for the dust solid angle @xmath24 obtained using the extra spatial information from the sub - mm images .",
    "this fit to two free parameters ( @xmath24 and @xmath25 ) gives similar reduced @xmath26 to the three free parameter fits , and only changes the fitted temperature @xmath23 by a few k.    we used the geometric mean of the deconvolved sizes from the scuba 450- and 850-@xmath27 m images ( resolution 7.5 and 14 arcsec ) , and the 1.3-mm iram 30-m image ( resolution 11 arcsec ) , giving gaussian half - widths 10.2 , 11.2 and 10.2 arcsec for sgr  b2 ( n ) , ( m ) and ( s ) .",
    "we therefore used solid angles @xmath28 of 117 , 138 and 118  arcsec@xmath1 for sgr  b2 ( n ) , ( m ) and ( s ) .",
    "for the extended component , we used the geometric mean of effective fitted solid angles from the scuba 450- and 850-@xmath27 m , bolocam 1.1-mm and 1.3-mm iram-30-m images , which is @xmath29  arcsec@xmath1 .",
    "for sgr  b2  ( n ) we find , as pointed out by @xcite , that the extra line - of - sight absorption component to the model is needed , making in this case then a three parameter fit .",
    "if we fix the angular size @xmath24 at that measured , then the extra absorption component to the model is clearly required : the reduced @xmath26 of the fit without the absorption ( 7.7 ) is substantially greater than with the absorption included ( 4.4 ) , and the fit is clearly poor for the sub - mm range .    the turnover wavelength is fitted as @xmath30 m , in good agreement with @xcite . this",
    "is physically interpreted as sgr  b2",
    "( n ) being partly embedded in the envelope .",
    "the fit shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : seds ] does not use the upper limits as constraints , but the non - detection of sgr b2 ( n ) in the spitzer mips 24 micron data ( at @xmath31 0.40 jy ) is consistent with the fit , and is a strong constraint .",
    "the fit does rely strongly on the 100 and 50 micron points of @xcite , quoted in @xcite where sgr b2 ( n ) was detected as a feature somewhat merged with the stronger peak of sgr b2 ( m ) and the extended envelope .",
    "our fitting of the recent spitzer mips 70 micron image shows sgr b2 ( m ) and ( s ) saturated , so that these components and the envelope can not easily be fitted .",
    "the upper limit we quote for sgr b2 ( n ) at 70 micron is the flux at the known ( from sub - mm ) position , in addition to some extended structure , which indicates that the 50 micron flux from @xcite may be an over - estimate , including some flux from extended structure .",
    "this would indicate more absorption ( and longer @xmath25 ) may be appropriate , but better high resolution data in the far - infrared range are required to confirm this .",
    "due to the inter - relationship of parameters @xmath23 , @xmath24 and @xmath25 it is possible to fit the cutoff in the dust sed at high frequencies ( infra - red , where sgr  b2  ( n ) is not detected , see fig .",
    "[ fig : radio_submm_ir ] ) with angular size @xmath24 as a free parameter , which gives a low temperature ( @xmath23 around 30 k ) , but this requires a large angular size @xmath32  arcsec@xmath10 which is in disagreement with the measured angular size .",
    "in addition , if sgr  b2  ( n ) had this low temperature , similar to that of the extended envelope , ( and there was not the absorption ) , then the 70 micron spitzer mips image would show a clear peak at the sgr b2 ( n ) position , in addition to the extended structure .",
    "this is not the case , which is further evidence against the low temperature interpretation of the sgr b2 ( n ) sed .",
    "we also list in table [ tab : sed_fits ] the parameters derived from the dust spectrum fits of total hydrogen column density @xmath33 , number density @xmath34 and mass @xmath35 for the four components sgr  b2 ( n ) , ( m ) , ( s ) and envelope .",
    "note that @xmath36 so this includes both molecular and atomic hydrogen .",
    "the turnover wavelength @xmath25 is related to total hydrogen column density @xmath33 by @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the metallicity , assumed 2 for the galactic centre , and @xmath39 is a dust parameter , assumed 3.4 for components sgr  b2 ( n ) , ( m ) and ( s ) , with @xmath40 and 1.9 for the envelope with @xmath41 @xcite .",
    "the number density @xmath34 and mass @xmath35 are derived using the angular size @xmath24 to estimate the line - of - sight thickness , and hence volume of the components .",
    "these are rough estimates , similar to those derived by @xcite from similar fits , but we assume galactic centre distance 8.0 kpc .",
    "we note that the three hot cores sgr  b2 ( n ) , ( m ) and ( s ) have similar angular size and temperature , but that sgr  b2 ( s ) has around an order of magnitude smaller flux density ( both dust and free - free components ) , column density , number density and mass . the extended envelope is cooler but around an order of magnitude larger in diameter than the cores , or two orders of magnitude in solid angle , and dominates the flux density of both dust and free - free components .",
    "the envelope is of much lower number density than the cores , but with much greater mass ."
