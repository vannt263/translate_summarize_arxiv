    "it is nearly ten years since the first gravitational microlensing event was detected toward the galactic bulge ( udalski et al .",
    "1993 ) . since then",
    ", microlensing has proved to be a useful tool for many astrophysical applications ( for a review of galactic microlensing , see paczyski 1996 ) . in the past , however , studies of microlensing statistics have been limited by the small number of detected events .",
    "this situation is improving as new microlensing projects begin operation , e.g. , the ogle - iii project , which is hoping to detect up to 1000 per year .    two ways that microlensing statistics can be used to investigate galactic models are through the study of the observed microlensing optical depth and the distribution of event time - scales .",
    "the optical depth toward the galactic bulge has been studied by many collaborations ( for example , alcock et al . 2000 and sumi et al .",
    "2002 ) and the resulting values are significantly larger than predicted estimates ( see , for example , binney , bissantz & gerhard 2000 ; evans & belokurov 2002 ; klypin , zhao & somerville 2002 ) , although recent work has questioned the significance of this discrepancy ( popowski 2002 ; afonso et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the distribution of event time - scales , which can be used to investigate the mass spectrum of lensing objects ( e.g. han & gould 1996 ; peale 1998 ) , also seems to disagree with predicted estimates ; it has long been suspected that microlensing searches appear to be identifying an unexpectedly large proportion of long - duration events .",
    "an important early study into the distribution of microlensing time - scales was carried out by han & gould ( 1996 ; see also zhao , rich & spergel 1996 ) .",
    "they found that in one - year of microlensing observations from the ogle and macho collaborations 8% of events had time - scale greater than 70 days , whereas the largest fraction predicted by their theoretical models was 2% .",
    "bennett et al .",
    "( 2002a ) analysed a more recent distribution of events timescales from macho data and found a similar excess of long duration events .",
    "although no systematic analysis of event time - scales has been performed for the full 4-year ogle - ii catalogue , a preliminary investigation using the first 3-years of data also indicates the existence of an excess ( udalski et al .",
    "2000 ) .    to date",
    ", two microlensing events have been identified with time - scales greater than one year ( ogle-1999-bul-32/macho-99-blg-22 , mao et al .",

    "we will introduce a third event , 5 , in this paper .",
    "it has been proposed that some of these extreme long - duration events could be due to lensing by massive stellar remnants , e.g. black holes ( agol et al .",
    "2002 ; bennett et al .",
    "2002a ) , although it is unlikely that this hypothesis could account for every long - duration event , for example ogle-1999-bul-19 ( smith et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "in this paper we present the analysis of event 5 .",
    "we begin by describing the observational data ( section [ data ] ) , before proceeding to fit the event with both the standard and parallax microlensing models ( section [ model ] ) .",
    "we then investigate whether any constraints can be placed on the lens mass ; we first attempt to utilise finite source size effects ( section [ fss ] ) , before considering more general arguments based on the relative transverse velocity of the lens and limits on the lens brightness ( section [ lhood ] ) . in section [ fss ]",
    "we also discuss the possible location and spectral type of the source star .",
    "section [ disc ] contains a brief discussion regarding the nature of event 5 and the possibility that there are an excess of long duration microlensing events in the ogle - ii catalogue .",
    "this section also mentions possible scientific returns from such long duration events .",
    "we conclude with a summary ( section [ conc ] ) .",
    "the event 5 was identified during the second phase of the ogle project ( in which it was named bul_sc5 244353 ; udalski et al .",
    "2000 ) toward the galactic bulge .",
    "the observations were carried out with the 1.3 m warsaw telescope at the las campanas observatory , chile , which is operated by the carnegie institution of washington .",
    "the instrumentation of the telescope and ccd camera are described in detail by udalski , kubiak , & szymaski(1997 ) .",
    "the position of the source is ra=17:50:36.09 and dec=@xmath230:01:46.6 ( j2000 ) , corresponding to galactic coordinates @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this event is also included in the catalogue of woniak et al .",
    "( 2001 ) , which employs the difference image analysis method of data reduction ( alard & lupton 1998 ) .",
    "this method generally appears to result in greater accuracy compared to the classical point spread function approach ( schechter , mateo & saha 1993 ) , and so we have chosen to use the difference image analysis data in the following analysis .",
    "unfortunately , this event was only detected after the peak in magnification had already occurred , which means that less than half of the full light curve is available for analysis .",
    "the baseline magnitude for the source is given by @xmath5 mag mag , but the 3-year classical point spread function data have a baseline of @xmath6 mag .",
    "however , the conclusions regarding the nature of event 5 remain unchanged if the classical point spread function data is used .",
    "] , and the colour is @xmath7 mag . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] we present the colour - magnitude diagram for the field around 5 . from this figure",
    "it can be seen that the field around 5 is subject to a large amount of interstellar extinction , owing to the fact that the source is located very close to the galactic plane .",
    "it appears that the lensed star is located in the main sequence branch of the colour - magnitude diagram .",
    "we will return to the issue of the possible source location and spectral type in section [ fss ] .",
    "we initially fit the event with the standard microlensing model , which assumes that the observer , lens and ( point ) source all move with constant velocities .",
    "the magnification is given by ( see , for example , paczyski 1986 ) , [ amp ] a(t ) = u^2 + 2 u ,   u(t ) , where @xmath8 is the impact parameter ( in units of the einstein radius ) and , [ tau ] ( t ) = t - t_0 , with @xmath9 being the time of the closest approach ( i.e. , maximum , magnification ) , and @xmath10 the event time - scale .",
    "the time - scale is defined such that , = v = _ e , where @xmath11 is the lens einstein radius , @xmath12 is the lens transverse velocity relative to the observer - source line of sight , and @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the values of these two quantities projected onto the observer plane .",
    "therefore , @xmath10 corresponds to the time it takes for the lens to move a distance equal to its einstein radius , the einstein _ diameter _ crossing time , i.e. @xmath15 . ] .",
    "the einstein radius projected onto the observer plane is related to the mass according to the following equation , [ eq : re ] _",
    "e = , where @xmath16 is the lens mass , @xmath17 the distance to the source and @xmath18 is the ratio of the distance to the lens and the distance to the source .",
    "this shows the well - known degeneracy inherent in the standard microlensing formalism ; the quantities @xmath14 , @xmath16 and @xmath19 can not be determined uniquely from a given microlensing light curve , even if the source distance is known .",
    "the difference image analysis flux is given by , f(t ) = f_0 ( + 1 ) - f_ref , where @xmath20 is the total baseline flux from the source plus any blended star(s ) , if present , @xmath21 is the ratio of the baseline source flux to the total baseline flux ( i.e. a measure of the blending ) , and @xmath22 is the flux of the reference image .",
    "all the fluxes here are in units of 10adu and can be converted into @xmath23-band magnitudes using the following transformation ( given in woniak et al .",
    "2001 ) , i(t ) = i_ref - 2.5log_10 , where @xmath24 is the @xmath23-band magnitude of the reference image .",
    "note that the reference image is brighter than the baseline magnitude for 5 .",
    "we fit the light curve with the above five parameters for the standard model , i.e. , @xmath9 , @xmath10 , @xmath25 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table [ tb : sc5 ] , and the corresponding light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ lc : sc5 ] .",
    "clearly this model is unable to provide a suitable fit for the data , with the best standard @xmath26 per degree of freedom greater than 5 .",
    "since the duration of this event is longer than one year , the next logical step is to fit the light curve with a model that incorporates the parallax effect ( gould 1992 ) .",
    "this effect , which arises when the earth s motion around the sun is considered , is described in detail in soszyski et al .",
    "( 2001 ) ; see also alcock et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , dominik ( 1998 ) .",
    "it requires two additional parameters , the einstein radius projected onto the observer plane , @xmath27 , and an angle in the ecliptic plane , @xmath28 , describing the orientation of the lens trajectory ( given by the angle between the heliocentric ecliptic @xmath19-axis and the normal to the trajectory ) .",
    "the parallax model produces a drastic reduction in @xmath26 .",
    "the best - fit parameters are given in table [ tb : sc5 ] , and the corresponding light curve is shown in fig .",
    "[ lc : sc5 ] .",
    "the @xmath26 per degree of freedom is 1.23 , which indicates that the parallax model provides a reasonable fit to the data .",
    "we also fit this event with a slight variation on the above parallax model . in the above model",
    "we describe the geometrical properties in the ecliptic plane and then project these quantities into the lens plane . however , since the ecliptic plane intersects the galactic bulge , this can lead to the projection being almost singular .",
    "therefore , to avoid this potential singularity , one can instead take the more conventional approach and describe the geometrical properties in the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight ( see , for example , dominik 1998 , alcock et al .",
    "1995 ) ; to describe the lens plane coordinate system we form a right - handed set with the @xmath19-axis chosen to correspond to the north ecliptic pole projected onto the lens plane and the @xmath29-axis chosen to be the observer - source line - of - sight , which implies that the @xmath30-axis corresponds to the intersection of the lens plane and the ecliptic plane .",
    "we find that the best - fit parameters are practically identical and therefore we do not present them here .",
    "however , for this coordinate system , the angle describing the relative lens - source trajectory is found to be @xmath31 degrees , where @xmath32 is the angle between the trajectory and the @xmath19-axis ( measured from the positive @xmath19-axis towards the positive @xmath30-axis ) .    from table [ tb : sc5",
    "] , the parallax parameters that provide information regarding the lens properties are , = 10.84^+ 0.44_-0.41  au ,  = 547.6^+22.6_-7.8  days , which implies that the transverse velocity of the lens relative to the source , projected onto the observer plane is , [ eq : v ] = = 34.2^+1.5_-1.9  km s^-1 .",
    "if we convert the direction of @xmath14 from the lens plane ( @xmath33 degrees ) into the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight to the galactic centre , we find that @xmath14 is directed almost parallel to the galactic plane in the direction of rotation ( @xmath34 degrees , where @xmath35 is measured from the galactic plane towards the north galactic pole ) . in this aspect 5",
    "is similar to the strong parallax events presented in bennett et al .",
    "( 2002a ) , all of which had @xmath36 .",
    "this timescale of 548 days is the second longest time - scale ever identified ( after the event ogle-1999-bul-32/macho-99-blg-22 ; see mao et al .",
    "2001 , bennett et al .",
    "in addition , the value of @xmath27 is also unusually large , which implies that this event could be another black - hole microlens candidate ( c.f .",
    "the three current black - hole microlens candidates , which have @xmath37 ; see agol et al .",
    "2002 ) . using equation ( [ eq : re ] ) ,",
    "the mass of the lens for this event is given by , [ eq : mass ] m = 7.21 m _ ( ) ^2 ( ) ,  .",
    "a value of @xmath38 mas corresponds to a disk source with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "there are various approaches that can be employed to constrain the location of the source and lens , and hence the lens mass ; these are considered in section [ mass ] .",
    "to verify the viability of our parallax fit , we proceed to fit the event with a model that incorporates a constant acceleration term , instead of the earth s centripetal acceleration ( see smith , mao & paczyski 2003 ) .",
    "this model is unable to provide a feasible fit for 5 , meaning that the parallactic nature of the deviations appears to be secure .",
    "since the peak magnification is predicted to be greater than 40 , one may suspect that this event could be affected by finite - source effects ( gould 1994 ; witt & mao 1994 ; nemiroff & wickramasinghe 1994 ) .",
    "such effects become apparent when the lens passes sufficiently close to the source , resulting in an invalidation of the assumption that the source is point - like .",
    "however , there is one significant drawback for 5 , namely that there is no coverage for the peak of the light - curve , i.e. the point at which the lens and source are in closest alignment and therefore where the finite - source effects should be most prominent .    to implement the finite - source model requires an additional parameter , @xmath41 , which denotes the source radius in units of the lens angular einstein radius . despite the lack of coverage around the peak",
    ", constraints can be placed on @xmath41 lower - limit on @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) , although we consider this to be unphysical since it would result in a highly unlikely value of @xmath43 .",
    "] , [ 3sig ] _ 0.034 m _  , which corresponds to @xmath44",
    ".    therefore we are only able to place a weak lower - limit on the lens mass from finite - source considerations .",
    "this outcome can be understood when one considers the likely values of the parameter @xmath41 . from equation ( [ eq : theta_e ] )",
    ", we can obtain the following relation for @xmath41 , _",
    "= 0.003 ( ) ( ) ( ) ^-1 ( ) ^-1 , where @xmath45 is the physical source radius , which we expect to be @xmath46 if the source for 5 is a main - sequence star .",
    "gould ( 1994 ) showed that the detection of finite - source signatures is only possible provided @xmath47 , where @xmath48 is the peak magnification . for 5",
    "we have @xmath49 , which implies that finite - source signatures are extremely unlikely to be detected .",
    "in addition to the above weak constraint placed on the lens mass from the finite - source analysis , there is other information that we can use from the properties of the best - fit parallax model , i.e. independent of the above finite - source fit .",
    "first , we shall consider the parallax velocity parameter ( @xmath14 ) , and then incorporate our knowledge of the limits on the blended flux .    for parallax microlensing events the velocity parameter @xmath14 ( i.e. the transverse velocity of the lens relative to the source , projected onto the observer plane ) , must be sufficiently small so that the earth s orbital motion is able to affect the light curve . for 5 , this transverse velocity is @xmath50 directed almost parallel to the galactic plane in the direction of rotation ( @xmath51 degrees ; see section [ model ] ) .",
    "the velocity vector @xmath52 is related to the transverse velocities of the observer ( i.e. the sun , @xmath53 ) , source ( @xmath54 ) and lens ( @xmath55 ) , where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath56 are the 2-dimensional velocities perpendicular to the line - of - sight ( i.e. in the lens plane ) , through the equation , [ eq : vproj ] = - _ .",
    "previous studies of parallax microlensing events ( e.g. alcock et al .",
    "1995 ) have used the parameter @xmath52 and equation ( [ eq : vproj ] ) to obtain a likelihood function for @xmath19 ( and hence , from equation [ [ eq : re ] ] , a likelihood function for the lens mass ) , [ eq : lhood ] l(x ; ) _",
    "l(x ) || ( 1-x)^3 f_v , s(*v*_s ) f_v , l([1-x ] [ * v*_+]+x*v*_s)d*v*_s , where @xmath57 and @xmath58 are the lens and source velocity distributions , @xmath59 is the density of lenses at a distance @xmath19 , and all vectors are described in the plane perpendicular to the line - of - sight to the galactic centre ( i.e. two dimensional ) .",
    "a more thorough analysis may be obtained by including a mass function prior ( see , for example , agol et al . 2002 ) .",
    "however , we do not attempt such an analysis here ; for the purposes of this work we follow the approach of bennett et al .",
    "( 2002b ) and assert that the likelihood function represents all of our knowledge about the lens mass and location ( i.e. we select a uniform prior ) , meaning that the above likelihood function can be interpreted as the probability distribution for @xmath19 .",
    "we evaluate this function by assuming that both the lens and source reside in the disk , using density and mass distributions from belokurov & evans ( 2002 ) and taking the sun s two dimensional peculiar velocity to be 8.89 km / s in a direction @xmath60 ( dehnen & binney 1998 ) .",
    "the results of this calculation are presented in figure [ fig : lhood ] . from this figure",
    ", we can see that the distribution for @xmath19 is not very narrow , implying that the lens can take a wide range of masses .",
    "for example , for @xmath61 kpc , this analysis suggests that @xmath62 and hence the lens mass @xmath63 ; moreover , the @xmath64 lower limit on the lens mass is @xmath65 , suggesting that a low mass lens is strongly disfavoured .",
    "additional constraints can be placed on the lens nature by considering the blended flux parameter , @xmath21 .",
    "the best - fit parallax model given in section [ model ] predicts that there is no blending ( i.e. , @xmath66 ) , meaning that all of the flux is being emitted by the lensed source .",
    "this is important because it suggests that the lens may not be a main sequence star , since if this was true one would expect some blending due to the light from the lens , i.e. one would expect @xmath67 .",
    "this possibility can be investigated by considering the limits on the @xmath21 parameter . from the best - fit parallax model",
    ", we can say that the @xmath64 and @xmath68 limits on the lens brightness are @xmath69 and @xmath70 , respectively .",
    "if we model the lens with a main - sequence mass - luminosity relation @xmath71 , we can use this to place a lower limit on @xmath19 through equation ( [ eq : re ] ) .",
    "however , to do this we need to know the source distance , @xmath72 , and also how the extinction varies with distance .",
    "if we again take @xmath73 kpc and assume the previous simple extinction model ( see section [ fss ] ) , we obtain @xmath64 and @xmath68 limits of @xmath74 and @xmath75 , respectively .",
    "this conclusion depends only weakly on the assumptions regarding the extinction and mass - luminosity relation .",
    "these constraints on @xmath19 appear to contradict the above conclusions from the @xmath14 likelihood analysis , which suggested that values of @xmath19 close to 1 are strongly disfavoured due to the low value of @xmath14 .",
    "figure [ fig : lhood ] shows how the @xmath64 limits on the lens brightness compare to the likelihood distribution described in equation ( [ eq : lhood ] ) for three values of @xmath72 .",
    "these constraints appear to be incompatible with the above likelihood analysis ( for example , for @xmath76 kpc , the likelihood analysis gives the probability that @xmath19 satisfies the @xmath64 constraints on the lens brightness to be @xmath77 ) .    therefore , we tentatively conclude that the lens for 5 is unlikely to be a main - sequence star , which implies that this event could be a white dwarf ( although this seems unlikely , given that typical white dwarf masses of @xmath78 [ bergeron , ruiz , & leggett 1997 ] are disfavoured from our likelihood analysis ) , a neutron star , or possibly an example of lensing by a stellar mass black hole ( agol et al .",
    "2002 ; bennett et al .",
    "one approach that can be utilised to probe the nature of the lens for 5 is through proper motion analysis .",
    "if the proper motion of the source can be measured , then this can be combined with the parallax model s prediction for the transverse velocity of the lens relative to the source ( i.e. @xmath14 ) to determine the proper motion of the lens .",
    "the importance of this method is that it can be applied even in the case where the lens is not luminous . by analysing one ogle - ii field , sumi , eyer & woniak ( 2003 )",
    "have shown that proper motion measurements can be determined for objects in the ogle - ii catalogue .",
    "preliminary results from the analysis of all ogle - ii fields suggests that the source star for 5 may have a large proper motion ( sumi , private communication ) , although this requires verification as the source star is relatively faint . despite the fact that the light curve for 5 appears to be reasonably well fit by the parallax microlensing model ( see section [ model ] ) ,",
    "it is not inconceivable that the variation in brightness could be due to some phenomena other than microlensing . whilst this ambiguity can affect any microlensing event , for 5 it is particularly severe since data only exist for the declining branch of the light curve",
    "indeed , recently cieslinski et al . ( 2003 ) carried out a search of ogle - ii light curves in an attempt to identify new cataclysmic variables . in this work",
    "they suggested that the shape of the light curve for 5 indicates that this event could be a candidate nova .",
    "however , it is known that microlensing events , unlike many intrinsically variable stars , are expected to be achromatic ( this may not be true for heavily blended events , but for 5 the best - fit model predicts no blended flux ) . for 5",
    "the ogle data only provide colour information for two epochs , namely @xmath79 days , and @xmath80 days .",
    "reassuringly , the @xmath81 colour appears to stay roughly constant for these two epochs , with @xmath82 and @xmath83 , respectively , which supports our belief that 5 is a microlensing event .",
    "an important aspect of 5 that is worth noting is that the above analysis is possible even though data exist for less than half of the microlensing light curve .",
    "despite the fact that observations commenced after the peak , it is still possible to identify the parallactic signatures and gain well - constrained measurements of @xmath27 and @xmath32 .",
    "obviously , this is only possible for 5 due to the high - quality data and the long duration of the event . in future ,",
    "even with initially sparse sampling , long - duration events can provide useful information provided high - quality data are obtained for the latter part of the light curve .",
    "this highlights the importance of real - time microlensing alert systems ( such as the ogle - iii early warning system or the moa transient alert page ) and also the importance of high - quality follow - up observations ( such as those performed by the planet collaboration ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "if real - time alert systems can detect events at a suitably early stage , then it could be possible to make direct determinations of the lens mass .",
    "for example , once the eso very large telescope interferometer becomes fully operational , its high sensitivity may enable measurements to be made of the angular separation of the two microlensed images ( delplancke , grski & richichi 2001 ) .",
    "coupled with a measurement of the parallax effect , this would completely break the lens degeneracy and unambiguously determine the mass of the lensing object . in future",
    "this approach could prove to be very important for long - duration microlensing events .",
    "another approach that would benefit from timely follow - up observations is the method of combining the parallax model with finite - source effects . as was shown in section [ fss ] , if firm measurements can be made of both parallax and finite - source effects ,",
    "is it possible to completely break the lens degeneracy and determine the lens mass .",
    "although this was not possible for 5 , it has recently been shown to be feasible ( for example , this approach was applied to the ogle - ii event sc26_2218 , resulting in a tentative lens mass determination [ smith , mao & woniak 2003 ] ) .",
    "if real - time alert systems are able to identify high - magnification long - duration events suitably early , it may be possible to obtain good quality data for the peak of the light curve and hence determine the lens mass .      with the addition of 5 , this brings the total number of known events in the ogle - ii catalogue with @xmath84 year to three : ogle-1999-bul-32 days ( bennett et al .",
    "2002b ) . ]",
    "( @xmath85 days ; mao et al . 2002 ) , 5 ( @xmath86 days ; see section [ model ] above ) , and ogle-1999-bul-19 ( @xmath87 days ; smith et al .",

    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     table [ tb : excess ] shows that these three ogle - ii events are all highly magnified , with peak magnifications ranging from 10.2 to greater than 40 .",
    "figure [ magcomp ] illustrates how these magnifications compare to a high - quality subset of the ogle - ii catalogue . by plotting the total baseline magnitude vs the change in magnitude at peak magnification",
    ", it can clearly be seen that these three events do not appear to lie within the main cluster .",
    "this could suggest that some , if not all , of these three long duration events are artifacts , i.e. the variability may not be due to microlensing .",
    "however , we believe that this is more - likely due to a selection effect , which implies that there could be additional long - duration events residing in the main lower - magnification cluster , i.e. , events that have been omitted from existing ogle - ii microlensing catalogues due to insufficient magnification ( low signal - to - noise ratio ) . in addition , from this table it is interesting to note that that these events do not appear to be clustered in any one direction ( c.f .",
    "popowski 2002 , where it is claimed that an abundance of long duration macho events appear to be clustered in one particular direction ) .",
    "previous work has indicated the existence of an excess of long duration microlensing events toward the galactic bulge ( e.g. , han & gould 1996 ; zhao , rich & spergel 1996 ; bennett et al .",
    "however , is it possible to quantify the extent to which these three longest - duration ogle - ii events constitute an excess ? if one navely extrapolates the behaviour of the timescale distribution of moderately long duration ogle - ii events to long timescales using a @xmath88 power - law ( mao & paczyski 1996 ) , this predicts far fewer than three events should have @xmath84 year .",
    "however , to perform this calculation thoroughly requires the detection efficiency of the ogle - ii catalogue , which is currently undetermined .",
    "we aim to investigate this important issue and report our findings in a future paper .    one implication of this potential excess is that many long - duration events could easily be overlooked by microlensing search projects .",
    "microlensing detection algorithms usually rely on the presence of a constant baseline to differentiate true events from variable stars",
    ". however , such long - duration events may exhibit noticeable magnification over the course of many years , which can mean that a constant baseline is not observed .",
    "for example , the detection algorithm of woniak et al .",
    "( 2001 ) initially failed to identify the three longest - duration events ( i.e. , those presented in table [ tb : excess ] ) owing to the fact that they did not pass the constant - baseline criteria . these three events were only found when this ogle - ii catalogue was compared with a previous , independently constructed , catalogue of ogle - ii events .",
    "also , as was mentioned above , it is conceivable that there are additional long - duration events in the ogle - ii catalogue that have been omitted due to having insufficient magnification ( i.e. , low signal - to - noise ratio ) .",
    "however , it should be noted that if some long - duration events are being overlooked in microlensing catalogues then this would increase the observed optical depth , which is already significantly larger than current theoretical predictions ( see , for example , binney , bissantz & gerhard 2000 ; evans & belokurov 2002 ; klypin , zhao & somerville 2002 ) .",
    "this paper has presented a new long - duration parallax event from the ogle - ii database , 5 , which has @xmath0 days .",
    "we believe that both the lens and source reside in the galactic disk , making event 5 one of the first confirmed examples of so - called disk - disk lensing . in this aspect",
    "it differs from the two other longest - duration events , which are both believed to have source stars located in the galactic bulge ( mao et al .",
    "2002 , bennett et al . 2002b",
    "; smith et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "the source star for 5 is likely to be located at a distance of @xmath89 kpc , although we are not able to provide a definitive value ( see section [ fss ] ) .",
    "this is the major source of uncertainty in the analysis presented in section [ mass ] .",
    "we strongly recommend that spectroscopic observations of the source are carried out in order to determine the spectral - type of the source and hence improve the estimate of @xmath72 . in section [ lhood ]",
    "we showed that the transverse velocity of the lens relative to the source ( @xmath14 ) can be used to construct a likelihood function for @xmath90 and hence the lens mass .",
    "this analysis suggests that lens is unlikely to be a main - sequence star , since the resulting luminosity of the lens would exceed the limits imposed on the blended flux from the parallax model .",
    "therefore 5 could be another candidate for microlensing by a stellar mass black hole ( agol et al .",

    "this work was supported by a pparc grant .",
    "i would like to thank shude mao for many insightful comments and for detailed criticisms of draft versions of this manuscript .",
    "i am also grateful to bohdan paczyski for helpful suggestions and comments , particularly concerning the importance of event 5 and fig .",
    "[ magcomp ] , and to andy gould for his advice and guidance .",
    "the full 4-year data for event 5 was generously provided by the ogle collaboration and i gratefully acknowledge the help of igor soszyski and przemysaw woniak for their assistance . in addition , i would like to thank takahiro sumi for providing preliminary data from his proper motion analysis .",
    "after this paper was accepted for publication , it was discovered that the eros microlensing collaboration also observed the field of sc5_2859 during this event .",
    "preliminary analysis of these data suggest that they are in good agreement with the ogle - ii data during the period when the observations overlapped . however , there are a number of eros data - points prior to the beginning of the ogle - ii observations ( i.e. for the period @xmath91 d ) , and these data appear to be incompatible with the microlensing model presented in this paper .",
    "it is hoped that the definitive analysis of the eros data , when combined with relevant follow - up observations , will help to clarify the nature of this event .",
    "the results of these findings will be presented at a later date .",
