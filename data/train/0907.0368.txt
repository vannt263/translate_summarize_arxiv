    "the mg@xmath1 3s-3p fine structure doublet near 280 nm ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : mg_levels ] ) is a prominent feature in many astronomical spectra .",
    "it can be observed by ground based telescopes , once the cosmological redshift translates the strong uv lines into the transparency range of the atmosphere .",
    "this makes the transitions good probes of physics at early epochs .",
    "one example for their astrophysical importance is the ongoing quest for a cosmological space - time variation of the fine structure constant  @xmath3 .",
    "an investigation of narrow absorption lines from gas clouds which are back - illuminated by distant quasars ( quasi - stellar objects , qso ) , allows to compare the value of  @xmath3 in distant regions of the universe with the value measured on earth  @xcite .",
    "the detection of a variation of the electromagnetic coupling constant  @xmath3 would provide compelling evidence of physics beyond the standard model .",
    "the mg@xmath1 doublet was first used in 1976  @xcite to constrain variations of  @xmath3 via the alkali doublet method  @xcite .",
    "an analysis of fine structure doublets allows to distinguish between a variation in @xmath3 and a frequency change due to the cosmological redshift , since the ratio between the fine structure and gross structure of atomic energy levels scales as  @xmath4 in leading order .",
    "dzuba et al .",
    "introduced the many multiplet ( mm ) method in 1999  @xcite , a refined approach which utilizes the fact that the transition frequencies itself contain relativistic corrections @xmath5 .",
    "the relativistic corrections are most pronounced for the ground states , so the comparison of transitions in different atomic species from the same object can significantly improve the sensitivity .",
    "resonance doublet near 280 nm is isoelectronic to the 3s-3p doublet in na historically labeled as d@xmath6 and d@xmath7 fraunhofer lines . from the d@xmath6 and d@xmath7 transition frequencies measured in @xmath0mg@xmath1 and @xmath2mg@xmath1 we deduce isotope shifts and fine structure splittings ( fs ) .",
    "the measurement accuracy allowed to resolve the isotope shift of the fine structure splitting for the first time . ]",
    "webb and coworkers applied the mm method to fe@xmath1 transitions measured against the mg@xmath1 doublet and found indications that  @xmath3 was smaller than the present day value for redshifts  @xmath8 ( about @xmath9  years ago ,  @xmath10 )  @xcite .",
    "the same group extended their studies to larger samples and further transition lines  @xcite , which finally resulted in a statistically significant signature of a smaller fine structure constant @xmath11 .",
    "hereby , 143 qso absorption samples where evaluated ( 77 of which were low-@xmath12 mg / fe systems  @xcite ) , all observed by the keck observatory using the hires spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "attempts to reproduce the results with 23 mg - based samples observed by a different telescope and spectrometer ( vlt / uves  @xcite ) suggest a drift consistent with zero  @xmath13  @xcite . this work and further investigations consistent with zero drift",
    "are summarized and disputed in  @xcite .",
    "recent  single ion differential @xmath3 measurement  ( sidam )",
    "studies on fe@xmath1 lines also gave a result compatible with zero drift  @xcite .",
    "next generation telescopes  @xcite , possibly in combination with absolute frequency calibration  @xcite may help to clarify the discrepancies on the reported uncertainty levels .",
    "comparison with qso absorption spectra requires laboratory reference data with an accuracy of better than 10@xmath14  @xcite , which corresponds to about 40  mhz at 280  nm .",
    "absolute frequency calibrated measurements  @xcite in the favorable environment of an ion trap , as reported in this article , provides reference data  @xcite that may be regarded as exact for comparison with astrophysical spectra . besides high accuracy it is particularly important to provide isotopically resolved data .",
    "magnesium has three stable isotopes with mass numbers 24 , 25 and 26 ( natural abundance 79:10:11 ) .",
    "different isotope abundances in the investigated astronomical objects were identified as an important source of systematic errors in the mm analysis , moreover , an investigation of the evolution of isotope abundances itself is of interest  @xcite . for these reasons an isotope shift measurement on the d@xmath6 transition",
    "was requested in  @xcite .",
    "also comparison with isotope shift theory demands refined reference data since the accuracy of theoretical predictions exceeded the measurement uncertainty @xcite .    so far the only isotopically resolved measurement was provided by drullinger et al .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath15mg@xmath1 isotope shifts of the d@xmath16 line were determined with an uncertainty of 100  mhz .",
    "the most accurate literature values for the d@xmath17 and d@xmath16 transition frequencies originate from fourier transform ( ft ) spectrometry using a hollow - cathode discharge lamp here an uncertainty of 60  mhz was reported for unresolved lines of natural isotopic abundance  @xcite .",
    "mm  analysis used laboratory reference data for the individual isotopic ( and hyperfine structure ) components  @xcite that are derived from the unresolved ft measurements  @xcite in combination with the d@xmath16 isotope shift results  @xcite .",
    "our measurement of the d@xmath17 and d@xmath16 component of the @xmath0mg@xmath1 and @xmath2mg@xmath1 isotopes , improves the transition frequencies by more than two orders of magnitude . from these four absolute frequency measurements we derive @xmath18mg@xmath1 isotope shifts .",
    "the isotope shift of the d@xmath17  transition has not been measured before and the d@xmath16 value is improved by three orders of magnitude .",
    "the accuracy of our measurement allows to resolve the @xmath18mg@xmath1 isotope shift of the fine structure splitting . from the @xmath0mg@xmath1 and @xmath2mg@xmath1 measurements we additionally deduce @xmath19mg@xmath1 transition frequencies , including the hyperfine structure , with an accuracy that is better than requested in  @xcite .",
    "finally , we note that strong constraints on _ present - day _ variations of  @xmath3 are set terrestrially by a comparison of optical clocks based on different atomic transitions .",
    "though optical clocks may only be compared on time scales of years , the tremendous accuracy allows to constrain variations of  @xmath3 about an order of magnitude more accurately than mm studies , if a linear drift over 10@xmath20  years look back time is assumed .",
    "recent measurements of an al@xmath1 clock against a hg@xmath1 clock at nist suggested @xmath21/year  @xcite .",
    "mg@xmath1 d@xmath6 resonance .",
    "fluorescence photons were collected for 3s per data point , the scan was randomized in order . for our measurements we restricted the tuning range to 180 mhz around the line center .",
    "inset : for comparison we show an asymmetric @xmath0mg@xmath1 d@xmath7 line profile scanned from the low frequency side , overlayed is a voigt fit to the rising edge , which is centered around the measured transition frequency . here",
    "the ion was essentially uncooled , only a weak cooling beam was superimposed to prevent ion loss during the scan time . ]        lines observed in qso absorption spectra are usually dipole - allowed transitions from the ground state  @xcite .",
    "spectroscopy on such transitions in trapped ions requires different spectroscopic approaches than probing narrow clock transitions .",
    "spectroscopy in the favorable sideband resolved regime  @xcite , that allows to avoid first order doppler and recoil shifts , is hard to establish , since typical transition bandwidths @xmath22 are broad compared to practical secular trap frequencies @xmath23 . in the weak binding limit ( @xmath24 )",
    "the absorption spectrum is strongly asymmetric if no further measures are taken and the transition is probed with a single laser beam . in this regime",
    "the motional sidebands overlap and for constant temperature a voigt profile would be observed , just as for an unbound atom  @xcite .",
    "however , scattering photons changes the temperature of the ion ; on the low - frequency ( `` red '' ) side of the resonance the ion is cooled to a detuning dependent temperature , on the high - frequency ( `` blue '' ) side it is heated and expelled from the trap center . therefore the voigt spectrum is heavily distorted : on the red side due to a detuning dependent equilibrium temperature and thus varying gaussian contribution to the linewidth .",
    "near resonance the temperature diverges and the ion is lost , so the blue side is not observed  @xcite ( see also fig .  [",
    "fig : widescan2 ] inset ) .",
    "therefore , in view of precision spectroscopy , the crux is to suppress adverse temperature variations induced by the spectroscopy laser .",
    "since the statistical uncertainty determining the line center is given by the linewidth divided by the signal - to - noise ratio of the data , a suitable approach should ensure low temperature ( i.e.  narrow linewidth ) and a high scattering rate .",
    "previously used approaches include a two laser method  @xcite , a double resonance scheme  @xcite , buffer gas cooling  @xcite and chopped detection  @xcite .",
    "our novel spectroscopy technique allows to record essentially unperturbed voigt profiles for the first time .",
    "the method is discussed in detail in  @xcite , here we will only sketch the basic idea .",
    "we prepare a crystallized chain of ions which is continuously doppler cooled at one side only ( see fig .  [ chain ] ) .",
    "a weaker spectroscopy laser probes sympathetically cooled ions at the other end of the chain , where we collect a basically background free fluorescence signal from single ions using an imaging photon detection system .",
    "this avoids both the background and ac stark shift from the cooling laser .",
    "counterintuitive to a thermal conductivity picture , the symmetric eigenmode structure efficiently couples cooling and spectroscopy ions at opposite ends of the chain , i.e.  the sympathetically cooled ions are cooled just as efficiently as directly cooled ions .",
    "a detailed analysis of the considered transitions shows : residual temperature variations lead to systematic shifts of the line center always below @xmath25 of the linewidth , as long as the cooling laser damping exceeds the heating induced by the spectroscopy beam for all detunings .",
    "therefore , the method enables to observe virtually unperturbed resonances from single , cold ions with high signal - to - noise ratio ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : widescan2 ] ) .",
    "the experimental setup is described in  @xcite , here we summarize basic features and illuminate further aspects in greater detail .",
    "the mg@xmath1 ions were stored in a linear paul trap operated at 15.8  mhz .",
    "the radial secular frequencies were about 1  mhz , while the axial secular frequency was chosen to be about 60  khz .",
    "ions were loaded into the trap by two - step photo ionization via the 3s@xmath26 - 3p@xmath6 transition in neutral mg with a frequency doubled dye laser at 285  nm  ( coherent 699 ) .",
    "references  @xcite showed that isotope selective photo ionization is possible when atom and laser beams are carefully arranged .",
    "our trap was loaded from neutral mg vapor of natural abundance ( doppler broadening : about 3  ghz , @xmath18 mg  3s@xmath26 - 3p@xmath6 isotope shift : 1.4  ghz  @xcite ) .",
    "yet we observed purified chains of up to 30 @xmath2mg@xmath1 ions , when we applied additional radio frequencies resonant to the @xmath0mg@xmath1 and @xmath19mg@xmath1 radial secular frequencies to an electrode parallel to the trap axis during the loading period .",
    "cooling and spectroscopy light was either provided by another frequency doubled dye laser ( coherent 699 ) or a frequency quadrupled yb fiber laser system  @xcite at 1118  nm ( koheras boostik ) , which could only interact with the d@xmath7 transition ( 90  ghz tuning range ) . a schematic setup using both lasers is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] . after a failure of the fiber laser",
    "the cooling and spectroscopy beams were produced by the frequency doubled dye laser . in this case",
    "the uv output was split and passed through two double pass acousto - optic modulators ( aom ) setups  @xcite , which allowed to independently control the frequency and amplitude of both beams .",
    "the intensities were set to @xmath27 and @xmath28 in units of the saturation intensity ( @xmath29  2.47  mw / mm@xmath30 ) .",
    "the cooling beam was detuned 64  mhz below resonance , the practical tuning range of the spectroscopy laser was 180  mhz , limited by the efficiency of the scanning aom in double pass configuration .",
    "the cooling beam was tightly focused to a beam radius of @xmath31 m and enclosed an angle of about 15@xmath32 with the trap axis predefined by the optical access of our vacuum vessel . given that geometry we found optimal experimental conditions when we cooled 2 - 3 outer ions of a chain containing 8 - 10 ions .",
    "this allowed us to perform low background spectroscopy on 2 - 3 ions at the other end of the chain . working with shorter chains decreased the number of low background spectroscopy ions , longer chains increased the probability that a mgh@xmath1 ion was generated by a chemical reaction with the background gas .",
    "dark mgh@xmath1 ions embedded in the chain changed their site on time scales of few seconds . once they enter the cooling or spectroscopy region it turns dark which distorts the line profile .",
    "we therefore reloaded our trap once an impurity ion was observed .",
    "the spectroscopy beam collinear with the ion chain was stabilized in intensity , spatially filtered with a small pinhole and loosely focused to about @xmath33 m in the trapping region .",
    "additional spatial filtering was necessary since tuning of the double pass aom led to frequency dependent distortions of the beam profile , observable with a beam profiling camera .",
    "we stabilized the _ total _ intensity , but the ions sampled frequency dependent _ local _ intensity variations , which resulted in an apparent alignment sensitivity of the line center .",
    "filtering with a  15  @xmath34 m size pinhole removed the beam profile distortions and the alignment sensitivity of the line center .",
    "the rf reference for all involved frequency combs , phase locked loops and the spectroscopy aom was provided by a hydrogen maser .",
    "a comparison between the free - running maser and the global positioning system showed a deviation smaller than @xmath35 over the whole measurement period , which is sufficient for our purpose .",
    "the phase coherent link between the rf reference and the optical regime was achieved with a 100  mhz repetition rate erbium doped fiber laser frequency comb .",
    "the frequency comb reaches well into the fourth sub - harmonic of the mg@xmath1 doublet at about 1120  nm . to bridge the gap to the green dye laser output we phase locked a diode laser at 1120  nm to a mode of the frequency comb and recorded a beat note between its frequency doubled output and the dye laser ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : setup ] ) .",
    "a synthesizer mixed the beat frequency down to a constant offset lock frequency , which allowed us to arbitrarily set the frequency of the phase locked dye laser with respect to the ir comb modes .",
    "this technique was also used to tune the spectroscopy laser , when we cooled the ion chain with the independent fiber laser system .",
    "the mode number of the ir comb , used for the measurement of the @xmath0mg@xmath1  d@xmath7 line was determined with a second frequency comb with repetition rate of 250 mhz ( menlo systems )  @xcite .",
    "we deduced the mode number for the remaining transitions relative to the known @xmath0mg@xmath1  d@xmath7 component using two independent wavemeters with an relative accuracy considerably better than the repetition rate ( burleigh wa 1500 , high finesse ws7 ) .",
    "every single measurement consisted of 30 - 40 frequency settings within a 180  mhz ( @xmath36  4  @xmath37 ) wide range around the line center , fluorescence photon counts were recorded for 3  s each .",
    "the chronological order of probe laser frequencies was randomized for each line scan to be insensitive to a great variety of possible drifts .",
    "photons were collected with a f/2 imaging system attached to a single photon camera ( quantar mepsicron ii ) .",
    "the spatially resolved count rate was digitized in 512  @xmath38  512 pixel images . to read out the fluorescence of a single ion we set a circular region of interest around the ion using software ( see fig .",
    "[ chain ] ) .    [ cols=\"<,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tableshift ]    the accuracy of theoretical isotope shifts used to exceed experimental data  @xcite , our measurement reverses this situation .",
    "theoretical isotope shifts from recent investigations  @xcite are shown in table  [ tableshift ] .",
    "different results arise mainly from the determination of the sms , since differences in the nms and differences in the field shift due to uncommon field shift constants @xmath39 are marginal , compared to the uncertainty introduced by experimental rms nuclear charge radii  @xcite .",
    "only the authors of  @xcite give error bars for their evaluation of the sms constant _",
    "k_@xmath40 , the uncertainty levels introduced by _",
    "k_@xmath40 and the nuclear charge radii are both on the order of 20  mhz .",
    "therefore the considerably more precise value of our measurement can neither set an accurate calibration point for sms investigations nor give rigorous insight on isotopic differences in the nuclear charge distribution .",
    "yet the results of  @xcite and our measurement are in good agreement . combining our results with the values given for _",
    "k_@xmath40 and @xmath39 from  @xcite allows to deduce the difference in the rms nuclear charge radii .",
    "here we find @xmath41=  0.06  ( 15 )  fm@xmath30 from the d@xmath7 line and @xmath41=  0.07  ( 30 )  fm@xmath30 from the d@xmath6 result , consistent with the tabulated value of 0.14  ( 16 )  fm@xmath30  @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of our measurement allows to resolve the @xmath18mg@xmath1 isotope shift of the forbidden 3p@xmath43 - 3p@xmath44 transition .",
    "since the fine structure splitting is of purely relativistic origin our measurement may be an interesting test for relativistic effects in isotope shift investigations .",
    "one result of  @xcite was , that the final relativistic mass shifts for levels of a multiplet appear to be closer to each other than the mass shifts obtained with non relativistic operators , giving rise to a difference in the determined mass shifts of 2.2  mhz and -14.4  mhz for the relativistic and non relativistic treatment respectively ( see table  v in  @xcite ) .",
    "our measured value of 2.66  ( 13 )  mhz for the total isotope shift supports this result .",
    "we have accurately measured the @xmath0 mg and @xmath2 mg components of the 3s-3p fine structure doublet in mg@xmath1 using a new spectroscopy method for trapped ions in the weak binding limit  @xcite .",
    "absolute frequency calibration ( relative to the definition of the si second ) allows us to directly deduce the corresponding isotope shifts and fine structure splittings .",
    "the measurement accuracy exceeds previous results by more than two orders of magnitude and allows to resolve the isotope shift of the relativistic fine structure splitting for the first time .",
    "we deduce transition frequencies for the @xmath19 mg hyperfine structure and the center - of - mass of an isotope mixture of natural abundance .",
    "a further measurement of the @xmath19 mg component would improve the uncertainty of composite transition frequencies , isotope shifts and hyperfine constants for the 3p@xmath44 and 3p@xmath43 level  @xcite . in turn",
    "it would allow for a more stringent consistency check of theoretical hyperfine structure constants , isotope shift theories and nuclear charge distributions .",
    "though our measurement may be regarded as exact reference for present and near future astrophysical spectra and theoretical isotope shifts , future applications may require even more accurate calibration .",
    "narrowing down the linewidth of the spectroscopy laser e.g.  by stabilization to an ultra - stable reference cavity would essentially remove the limiting systematic effect of our measurement .",
