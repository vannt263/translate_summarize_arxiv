    "the structure and dynamics of an accretion disk around a neutron star or a black hole is often strongly influenced by its irradiation from the compact object or the disk itself . in galactic sources , for example ,",
    "the optical emission ( see , e.g. , de jong , van paradijs , & augusteijn 1996 ) , the stability ( see , e.g. , van paradijs 1996 ; king , kolb , & burderi 1996 ) , and the warping of the accretion disk ( pringle 1996 ; wijers & pringle 1999 ) are probably determined by x - ray irradiation from the central source . in extragalactic sources , the observed broad iron emission lines ( see nandra 1997 for a review ) , the weak or absent lyman edges ( sincell & krolik 1997 ; antonucci 1999 ) , as well as the disk warping ( pringle 1996 ) may also be caused by x - ray irradiation of the accretion disk .    calculating the structure even of a non - illuminated accretion disk is not trivial , because of the complicated physical processes involved , such as the non - lte character of the transport of radiation ( see , e.g. , hubeny & hubeny 1998 ) , and assumptions regarding the vertical profile of the viscous heating ( see , e.g. , laor & netzer 1989 ) .",
    "the problem becomes even more difficult when illumination is taken into account , both because additional physical process , such as photoionization ( see , e.g. , raymond 1993 , ko & kallman 1994 ) , become dominant , and because of the multidimensional character of the problem .",
    "the transport of radiation through an accretion disk illuminated by a distant source is in general two - dimensional and not axisymmetric .",
    "the spectrum of the reflected radiation , when only compton scattering is taken into account , has often been solved in terms of the distribution of photon escape probabilities from the reflecting medium ( e.g. , lightman & rybicki 1980 ) or using green s functions ( e.g. , poutanen , nagendra , & svenson 1996 ) .",
    "when absorption and emission processes are taken into account , the problem is often solved assuming plane - parallel symmetry ( e.g. , sincell & krolik 1997 ) , or employing variants of the @xmath0-iteration ( e.g. , basko , sunyaev , & titarchuk 1974 ; matt , fabian , & ross 1993 ) and monte - carlo methods ( e.g. , george & fabian 1991 ) .    solving directly the radiative transfer equation in two spatial dimensions is challenging , especially when the energies of the photons change by compton scattering and the problem becomes non - local both in space and in photon energy ( see , e.g. , mihalas , auer , & mihalas 1978 ; auer & paletou 1994 ; dykema , klein , & castor 1996 ; dullemond & turolla 2000 ; busche & hillier 2000 for methods of solving problems in two spatial dimensions ) . in general , a problem that is two - dimensional in coordinate space requires the solution of the radiative transfer equation in five dimensions , two in coordinate space and three in photon momentum space . in the case of illumination of a geometrically thin accretion disk , however , the problem can be simplified significantly . because the photon mean free paths in the radial and azimuthal directions are much smaller than any characteristic length scale in the accretion flow , a geometrically thin accretion disk can be decomposed into a finite number of plane - parallel , obliquely illuminated slabs . solving the radiative transfer equation for each slab requires only four dimensions , one in coordinate space and three in photon momentum space .",
    "when the angular dependence of the interaction cross section between photons and matter can be expanded into a finite number of legendre polynomials , the problem can be simplified even further ( chandrasekhar 1960 ) . in this case , the radiative transfer equation is equivalent to a finite number of equations over one dimension in coordinate space and two dimensions in photon momentum space , i.e. , to a finite number of radiative transfer problems in one spatial dimension .",
    "these equations can be solved in general using existing numerical methods .    in this paper",
    "i derive the system of equations ( reduced to one spatial dimension ) that describe , in an obliquely illuminated slab , isotropic absorption and emission , as well as compton scattering to first order in @xmath1 and @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the photon energy and @xmath4 and @xmath5 are the electron temperature and rest mass .",
    "i then explore a variant of the feautrier method for solving the resulting transfer equations , in which the scattering kernels do not have forward - backward symmetry ( see milkey , shine , & mihalas 1975 ) .",
    "i illustrate the use of the derived equations and method of solution by solving simple problems related to the albedo of a cold disk .",

    "i solve the radiative transfer problem in a plane - parallel slab illuminated by some arbitrary , external source of photons .",
    "i describe all physical quantities in this system using an orthogonal , cartesian reference frame , with its @xmath6-axis parallel to the finite dimension of the slab .",

    "i assume that the electrons in the slab have density @xmath11 and temperature @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the electron rest mass .",
    "i also assume that the illuminating radiation is a parallel pencil beam of net flux @xmath14 . neglecting induced processes , the radiative transfer problem is linear and therefore the effect on any arbitrary illumination pattern can be computed by summing the solutions obtained for each plane - parallel pencil beam .",
    "the direction of illumination is described by the vector @xmath15 , where @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the directional angles .",
    "i describe the radiation field in terms of the monochromatic specific intensity @xmath18 , where @xmath6 is the distance from the edge of the slab , @xmath19 and @xmath20 are the directional angles of the propagation vector @xmath21 , and @xmath3 is the photon energy .",

    "however , solving the latter problems still requires special care , for a number of reasons .",
    "first , the interaction of the illuminating radiation with the disk material takes place in the outermost layers of the slab , which are optically thin . as a result ,",
    "the method of solution of the transfer equation must be accurate in the limit of low optical depth .",
    "second , in a typical disk - illumination problem , the interaction of the illuminating radiation with the disk material is dominated by true - absorption at low photon energies but is scattering - dominated at high photon - energies . for this reason ,",

    "i describe a variant of the feautrier method that has the desired properties for solving the four one - dimensional radiative transfer equations  ( [ pde0])([pde3 ] ) .",

    "i then discretize all quantities over @xmath66 grid points in the variable @xmath67 , @xmath68 grid points in photon energy , and @xmath69 grid points in the direction of propagation @xmath59 . for simplicity ,",

    "it is important to point out here that the method presented in this section is very efficient since it requires the solution of only four equations of simplicity equal to the minimum required for calculating the interaction of an external radiation field with an accretion disk .",
    "therefore , the computational cost of this method is exactly equal to four times the cost required for solving the simplest problem of normal illumination of a plane - parallel slab . as an example , the solution of a problem with 20 grid points in optical depth , 10 grid points in angle , and 60 grid points in energy ( i.e. , similar to the one shown in fig",
    ".  1 ) requires only 2  cpu minutes on a 500  mhz alpha processor .",
    "in this section , i use the method described in  3 for calculating the albedo of an illuminated , cold accretion disk .",
    "i consider concentric annuli of the disk , which i approximate by plane - parallel slabs .",
    "i take into account compton scattering as well as bound - free absorption from a cold gas ( morrison & mccammon 1983 ) and neglect all other radiation processes .",
    "when the radiation field is weak , the ratio of the bound - free absorption coefficient to the scattering cross section is independent of the electron density and temperature . as a result",
    ", i can solve the radiative transfer problem in terms of the electron - scattering optical depth @xmath67 without the need to consider the vertical disk structure .",
    "when the radiation field is strong , the illumination of the disk will affect both its ionization balance and the absorption coefficients , and hence the overall solution will depend explicitly on the vertical structure of the disk ( see , e.g. , nayakshin & kallman 2001 ) .    in general",
    ", the radiative transfer equation  ( [ 4drte ] ) is linear in the specific intensity .",
    "i can , therefore , write @xmath111 where @xmath112 and @xmath113 describe the radiation field due to viscous heating and illumination respectively , and solve for the two radiation fields independently .",
    "note here that decomposition  ( [ dec ] ) is only formally valid , since the absorption and emission coefficients , as well as the scattering kernel may depend on the electron density and temperature that are determined by the total radiation field .",
    "the model parameters for the calculations include the angle of illumination , @xmath16 with respect to the normal and the spectrum of the illuminating radiation , which i set to a power - law of photon index @xmath114 , i.e. , @xmath115 .",
    "figure  1 shows the contribution to the vertical flux ( eq .  [ [ h2 ] ] ) of the various orders of the decomposition  ( [ expans ] ) , for an illumination angle of @xmath116 and a power - law spectrum of photon index @xmath117 . even though the term of zeroth - order provides the dominant contribution to the vertical flux ,",
    "the contribution of higher - order terms is not negligible .",
    "this is shown in figure  2 , where the contribution of the high - order terms to the vertical flux is plotted for different angles of illumination .",
    "the total correction , caused by the obliqueness of the illumination , ranges between @xmath118% .",
    "note here that the relative contributions of the different orders of the specific intensity plotted in figure  2 correspond to the case of zero electron temperature and increase for finite electron temperatures because of the asymmetry of the compton terms in the scattering kernel .    in the context of accretion onto galactic compact objects ,",
    "the albedo @xmath119 of an accretion disk is usually defined in terms of the fraction of the illuminating flux that does not heat the disk gas ( see , e.g. , de jonk et al .",
    "1996 ) . in this section ,",
    "i first give the general expression for the albedo of an accretion disk that is illuminated obliquely and then evaluate it for the case of geometrically thin , optically thick , cold accretion disks .",
    "starting from equation  ( [ dec ] ) and integrating the transfer equation for @xmath113 over photon energy and directional angle i obtain @xmath120 where @xmath121 and @xmath122 are the energy - integrated , zeroth and first angular moments of @xmath113 and @xmath123 the rate @xmath124 , at which the illuminating radiation heats the gas is therefore @xmath125j_{\\rm i}\\ ; ,   \\label{q}\\ ] ] and the albedo can be written in terms of the volume integral of @xmath126 as @xmath127\\frac{j_{\\rm i}}{f } d\\tau_{\\rm es}\\nonumber\\\\     & = & 1-\\frac{2}{\\mu_{\\rm i}f}\\int_0^{\\tau_{\\rm es , max}}d\\tau_{\\rm es }    \\left[\\chi + n_e\\sigma_{\\rm t }    \\left (         \\frac{\\langle\\e\\rangle}{m_{\\rm e } }        -4\\frac{t_{\\rm e}}{m_{\\rm e}}\\right )      \\right]\\int_\\epsilon d\\epsilon \\int_{-1}^1 d\\mu     \\i^0(\\tau_{\\rm es},\\e,\\mu)\\ ; ,    \\label{albedo }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath128 is the energy - integrated flux of the illuminating radiation and @xmath129 is the vertical height of the accretion disk .",
    "expression  ( [ albedo ] ) allows the study of the vertical profile of the heating of the accretion disk by the irradiating atmosphere as well as the calculation of its albedo , by solving _ only _ the zeroth - order transfer equation for @xmath130 .",
    "figure  3 shows the albedo of a cold accretion disk , calculated in the @xmath131  kev energy range , for different power - law spectra and angles of illumination .",
    "as expected , for larger photon indices of the illuminating radiation , the fraction of low - energy photons , which are efficiently absorbed , is higher and hence the albedo of the disk is lower . at the same time , as the angle of illumination increases , the photons interact with the electrons in a shallower layer of the accretion disk and therefore have a higher chance of escaping after one interaction , increasing the value of the albedo .",
    "the overall effect of our treatment of the obliqueness of irradiation is this systematic increase of the disk albedo with illumination angle , which can be up to a factor of @xmath132 larger that in the case of normal illumination .",
    "in this paper , i studied the transfer of radiation in an accretion disk that is obliquely illuminated by an external source of radiation .",
    "i showed that the resulting transport problem can be decomposed exactly into four one - dimensional problems , which i solved using a variant of the feautrier method .",
    "i then applied this method in calculating the albedos of cold accretion disks .",
    "the calculated values for the albedos are @xmath133 , even for the softer spectra and larger illumination angles considered here .",
    "these values are small and can not account , for example , for the observed optical magnitudes of galactic low - mass x - ray binaries , which require albedos in excess of @xmath134 ( see de jong et al.1996 ) .",
    "figure  3 shows that relying on a near - grazing illumination of the accretion disk is not enough to account for the observations .",
    "high ionization fractions at the surface layers of the disk , which would reduce the absorption of photons , or even the existence of a highly ionized scattering wind above the accretion disk is probably required for the calculated albedos to reach the high values inferred from observations .    in this study ,",
    "i assumed for simplicity that all heavy elements in the accretion disk are neutral and , therefore their interaction with the illuminating photons is described by the bound - free opacities of morrison & mccammon ( 1983 ) . in reality , however , the heated skin of the accretion disk will be collisionally- and photo - ionized and its vertical ionization and thermal balance will need to be calculated self - consistently with the radiation field ( e.g. , raymond 1993 ; ko & kallman 1994 ) .",
    "note , however , that the calculation of both the ionization balance and the radiative equilibrium depend only on the zeroth moment of the specific intensity ( see eq .",
    "[ [ j ] ] and [ [ q ] ] ) and , therefore , require the solution of only the zeroth - order transfer equation . as a result",
    ", the properties of the disk gas can be calculated exactly in a simple , one - dimensional configuration and the full angular dependence of the radiation field can then be calculated with prescribed gas properties .",
    "the results of a self - consistent caclulation of the radiation and gas properties will be reported elsewhere .",
    "i am grateful to g.  rybicki for bringing to my attention the possibility of decomposing a multi - dimensional transfer equation into a small number of one - dimensional equations and for carefully reading the manuscript .",
    "i also thank feryal zel for many useful discussions , especially on the implementation of the feautrier method in problems with no forward - backward symmetry .",
