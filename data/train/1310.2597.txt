    "the carbon stars form a heterogeneous population @xcite .",
    "the modern classification is based on that of @xcite , and does not fully reflect the likely evolutionary status of the stars .",
    "two broad categories of c - r and c - n stars are identified , based on the earlier r and n spectral types .",
    "c - n stars are the easiest to understand , being asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars in which carbon is brought to the surface during the third dredge - up .",
    "early c - r stars appear to be core helium burning red - clump stars @xcite .",
    "it is speculated that the carbon excess is related to an anomalous helium flash , possibly involving a binary merger , although models do not yet reproduce this behavior .",
    "@xcite show that late c - r stars are chemically indistinguishable from c - n stars , and so are also agb stars .",
    "c - j stars show enhanced @xmath4c and li abundances and may also be a heterogeneous group ; their nature remains unclear @xcite .",
    "these classes are likely all _ intrinsic _ carbon stars , responsible for their own carbon overabundance .",
    "there are also several classes of _ extrinsic _ carbon stars in which the excess carbon was accreted from an evolved companion .",
    "these include the barium stars and their population ii counterparts , the c - h stars .",
    "many of these are found to have white dwarf companions .",
    "symbiotic stars are interacting binaries in which a compact object , usually a white dwarf , accretes from a red giant star ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . in most symbiotics",
    ", the red giant appears to be a normal , oxygen - rich star , but of the 188 symbiotics in the catalog of @xcite about 6%  have carbon star companions .",
    "half of these are in the magellanic clouds , leaving galactic carbon star symbiotics quite rare .",
    "one of the defining characteristics of the symbiotic star population is that they usually show an emission line spectrum , though exceptions do exist @xcite and may represent a sub - class of low accretion rate symbiotics .",
    "there is also a small population of symbiotic x - ray binaries ( syxbs ) which instead host a neutron star @xcite .",
    "there are seven reasonably firm candidates ( * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) , plus one tentative candidate that is identified with a carbon star @xcite .",
    "the total galactic population of syxbs has recently been estimated at 1001000 @xcite .",
    "the best studied syxb is gx  1 + 4 @xcite , which has a high x - ray luminosity ( @xmath5ergs@xmath2 ) and an optical spectrum rich in emission lines .",
    "as more candidates have been discovered , these characteristics have been found to be the exception rather than the rule , and the other candidates have inferred x - ray luminosities of @xmath6ergs@xmath2 .",
    "they typically show very hard and highly variable x - ray spectra .",
    "presumably because of the low x - ray luminosity , and absence of a strong uv source to ionize the red giant wind , the optical spectra are usually lacking in emission lines making secure confirmation of a syxb nature challenging .",
    "in addition to these candidate syxbs , @xcite identified 13 x - ray selected symbiotics in the bulge .",
    "they found quite hard x - ray spectra and a paucity of emission lines , suggesting that this sample may well include some , or even a majority of syxbs , or alternatively that x - ray selected white dwarf symbiotics define a different population from those previously identified optically .",
    "the objects found by @xcite suggest that looking for x - ray selected cool giants may be an efficient way to expand the symbiotic parameter space , including identifying more syxbs , as cool giants are intrinsically very weak x - ray sources @xcite .",
    "the galactic bulge survey ( gbs ) is an 0.38.0kev x - ray survey performed with _",
    "chandra s _ acis - i camera @xcite .",
    "it was specifically optimized to identify low - luminosity neutron star x - ray binaries in the bulge , with a limiting x - ray sensitivity of @xmath7erg@xmath8s@xmath2 ( for a @xmath9 , @xmath10@xmath8 power - law spectrum ) which translates to a luminosity limit of @xmath11ergs@xmath2 at the bulge distance . by observing at @xmath12 ,",
    "the survey focuses on regions of reduced absorption relative to that of the plane , so we can expect that most of the syxbs in the survey area should be detected as x - ray sources .",
    "the modest extinction , coupled with the high optical and ir brightness of the companion stars in syxbs means that we also can expect to detect the optical / ir counterparts and classify the systems .",
    "there is thus a reasonable prospect that the gbs can identify most of the syxbs along its line of sight and thus provide a near - volume limited survey to test the population models .",
    "looking for bulge symbiotics , syxbs and white dwarf systems , is also potentially of interest if objects can be found with carbon star companions . examining the distribution of objects in the catalog of galactic carbon stars ( cgcs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , it shows a pronounced deficit of objects in the vicinity of the bulge , in spite of the high density of red giants there .",
    "the entire 12 square degree field of the gbs contains just 5 objects from the cgcs .",
    "@xcite found only 5 carbon stars among a sample of 2187 late m giants in the bulge , implying a c - m ratio of just 0.0023 .",
    "this can be compared to the large and small magellanic cloud c - m ratios of 0.8 and 13.8 respectively @xcite , and a radial gradient from 0.2 to 0.7 in the disk of m33 @xcite .",
    "besides their rarity , the carbon stars found in the bulge , for example the 34 objects of @xcite , are also markedly less luminous than those in the magellanic clouds .",
    "indeed , @xcite went so far as to suggest that there are no carbon stars in the bulge , and that the objects found are actually more distant objects associated with the sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy seen through the bulge .",
    "@xcite has challenged this , however , arguing that the photometric properties of the bulge carbon stars are inconsistent with those of the carbon stars definitely associated with the sagittarius dwarf . finding syxbs associated with bulge carbon stars can potentially then shed light on the evolutionary history of these objects , for example via modeling the spin history of their neutron stars @xcite .",
    "optical spectroscopy of counterparts to gbs x - ray sources is ongoing using a number of facilities . here",
    "we report on the first candidate syxb identified by the gbs with spectroscopic classification from gemini - south and the very large telescope , cxogbs  j173620.2293338 ( henceforth cx332 following the source numbering of @xcite ) .",
    "this x - ray source is coincident with a very red star , 2mass  j173620202933389 , also identified as an optical gravitational lensing experiment ( ogle ) irregular variable ( ogle  iv blg654.20 36111 ; @xcite ) .",
    "this counterpart shares the characteristics of bulge carbon stars .",
    "the field of cx332 was observed using the mosaic-2 camera on the 4 m blanco telescope at the cerro - tololo inter - american observatory from 2010 july 12 to 18 .",
    "we obtained 120sec exposures in the sdss @xmath13 filter several times per night as part of an extensive program to obtain photometry of gbs sources ( britt et al .  in preparation ) .",
    "the images were reduced with the noao mosaic pipeline @xcite which added astrometric and ( approximate ) photometric calibrations using the usno b1.0 catalog @xcite .",
    "we combined the nine images with the best seeing to form an average shown in fig .",
    "[ finderfigure ] .",
    "we checked the astrometry against ten nearby objects matched with 2mass objects .",
    "the agreement was excellent , with the mosaic solution differing from 2mass by @xmath14arcsec in ra and dec .  respectively .",
    "we also overlay on figure  [ finderfigure ] the _ chandra _ position .",
    "two regions are indicated .",
    "the inner ellipse indicates 95%confidence wavdetect uncertainties reported by @xcite combined in quadrature with the _ chandra _ aspect uncertainty .",
    "the outer circle is a more conservative 95%confidence region based on the prescription of @xcite .",
    "the latter explicitly accounts for the degradation of the point - spread function off - axis , and so may be more realistic for a source observed 7.85arcmin off - axis .",
    "however , in figure  [ finderfigure ] we also show the _ chandra _ image with individual events localized .",
    "based on the event locations , the outer circle actually appears to be an over - estimate of the plausible uncertainty in the source position .",
    "we note that while the systematic _ chandra _ aspect undertainty is taken account of , it is a negligible contribution to the current positional uncertainty ( see fig .",
    "[ finderfigure ] ) .",
    "observation was too shallow to allow correction of the aspect uncertainty by cross - correlation with other sources in the field .",
    "the x - ray position is very close to a bright star ( a ) and a faint companion ( b ) to the north - east ; the x - ray localization is not good enough to discriminate between these .",
    "we measure a brightness for star a of @xmath15 , with the uncertainty dominated by that of the usno - based calibration .",
    "several other stars can not securely be ruled out at 95%  confidence , but are less likely counterparts since the source is most likely to be near the center of a 95%confidence region .",
    "we label the next brightest credible candidate star c.    we also examined our mosaic-2 images using the image subtraction technique @xcite . some @xmath13 variability from star a is detected in the variance images ( figure  [ finderfigure ] ) , but this is actually quite low amplitude and the variability of star a is much better sampled by ogle observations ( * ? ? ?",

    "the acquisition image had a better image quality than the mosaic-2 images and clearly resolves stars a and b , so we also show it in figure  [ finderfigure ] .",
    "two 450s exposures were obtained on 2010 march 18 using the r150 grating spanning the full accessible ccd spectrum at 17resolution , spread over two ccds .",
    "the slit was aligned to pass through both stars a and b ( see figure  [ finderfigure ] .",
    "the spectra were independently reduced using the gemini iraf package , and using a manual reduction in iraf .",
    "we retained the manual optimal extraction which was found to be somewhat cleaner .",
    "flat - fielding used a single flat taken immediately after the object frames and wavelength calibration was performed relative to a daytime cuar arc spectrum following standard gmos procedures .",
    "extraction of the spectrum of star a proceeded normally using optimal extraction methods within iraf .",
    "the extraction region was chosen to exclude that contaminated by star b. to aid comparison with atlas spectra , we applied a crude flux calibration using the spectrophotometric standard ltt7379 @xcite .",

    "[ specfigone ] .",
    "star a is clearly a carbon star showing strong features of c@xmath3 at 5200  and 5600 , and multiple cn features from 57006600 .",
    "star b was more challenging .",
    "we adapted the methods of @xcite to extract its spectrum .",
    "we could not use this approach exactly as there was not a co - aligned , isolated psf template star to use .",
    "we began by subtracting a two - dimensional fit to the sky . to deal with the blending",
    ", we assumed that the profile of the star a should be spatially symmetric and so reflected the two - dimensional spectrum around the trace of star a. this did not work well in the core of the profile where the interpolation of the reflected profile was inadequate to describe the data , but did work well in the wings .",
    "in particular , the profile of star b was well defined , and isolated from the residuals to the fit in the core of star a. we then proceeded to follow @xcite and optimally extract the spectrum of the star b adding the subtracted light from the bright star to the effective sky image to ensure proper weighting of pixels across the profile .",
    "once extracted , the spectrum was calibrated as for the star a , and is also shown in figure  [ specfigone ] .",
    "compared to star a , the spectrum is relatively featureless , and dominated by the atmospheric a band at 7600  and the water feature at 9300 .",
    "no emission features are present .",
    "stars a and c were also observed with vimos @xcite , an imager and multi - object spectrograph mounted on the nasmyth focus of the 8.2-m european southern observatory unit 3 very large telescope at paranal , chile . the medium resolution ( mr )",
    "grism was used to yield a 2.5  / pixel dispersion and a wavelength coverage of @xmath36  .",
    "the use of 1.0 arcsec width slits provided a spectral resolution of @xmath37   fwhm .",
    "the spectroscopic observations of cx332 were obtained on 2011 july 3 in service mode under program 085.d-0441(a ) .",
    "they consisted of two spectroscopic integrations of 875s , along with three flat - field exposures and a helium - argon lamp exposure for wavelength calibration .",
    "standard data reduction was performed with the eso - vimos pipeline @xcite which averaged the two spectra and automatically extracted the objects found on the slit . to handle saturation effects in the spectrum of cx332 , we extracted interactively with the iraf kpnoslit package the reduced 2-d frame that contain both stellar and sky spectra ( pipeline file with product code ssem ) .",
    "we refer the reader to torres et al .",
    "( in preparation ) for further details on the vimos spectroscopy for gbs sources .",
    "star a , the carbon star , is clearly the brightest candidate counterpart , and is the only optical variable detected within the _ chandra _ error circle , but star b is also close to the center of the error circle .",
    "as noted above , star b shows an unremarkable spectrum and no detected variability .",
    "no emission lines are seen , in particular at the location of h@xmath38 region .",
    "it is also quite red , comparable to the star a. these characteristics suggest a reddened star in the bulge , possibly a k - type giant , as no molecular bands are present to signify an m spectral type .    to estimate the brightness of star b we extracted an average spatial sky - subtracted profile from the gemini spectra for the spectral region 72898831 approximately corresponding to the @xmath16 band .",
    "both stars show clean , marginally resolved profiles .",
    "we perform a joint fit to both profiles with two voigt profiles , with the same gaussian and lorentzian widths and find a brightness ratio of 0.039 , corresponding to a magnitude difference of 3.5 magnitudes . at the time of the gemini observation ,",
    "the ogle magnitude of star a was about 15.2 , so we estimate that star b is at @xmath39 . at the mean bulge distance , and",
    "reddening @xmath40 ( see section  [ sedsection ] ) , this corresponds to @xmath41 , too faint to be a giant at 8kpc .",
    "it may be a giant on the far side of the bulge , a bulge sub - giant , or a foreground dwarf . if this were the x - ray counterpart , with an 8 photon detection ( @xmath42erg@xmath8s@xmath2 ; @xcite ) then it is too x - ray bright for the expected rs  cvn distribution ( fig .  3 of @xcite ) and lacks the emission lines expected for a quiescent cataclysmic variable or intermediate polar .",
    "we also obtained a vlt / vimos spectrum of star c with the same configuration as for star a. this is also unremarkable and shows no emission features .",
    "the absorption features detected are typical of g and early k stars .",
    "like star b , it is not detected as an optical variable .",
    "we conclude that neither stars b nor c are likely to be the counterpart to the x - ray source , leaving star a , the carbon star , as the most probable counterpart .",
    "a complementary approach is to assess the likelihood of a chance alignment of one of the gbs x - ray sources with a rare object such as a bulge carbon star .",
    "the x - ray position reported by @xcite is @xmath43 , @xmath44 where the _ chandra _ aspect uncertainty of 0.6arcsec ( 90%  confidence ) has not been included .",
    "the best position for the carbon star is from 2mass , @xmath45 and @xmath46 .",
    "the x - ray / ir positional offset is therefore @xmath47arcsec , and @xmath48arcsec . adding the 1@xmath49 aspect uncertainty in quadrature ,",
    "the 1-d offset is @xmath50 .",
    "the x - ray source is clearly consistent with the carbon star .",
    "we can estimate the probability of a chance coincidence based on the expected surface density of carbon stars .",
    "@xcite attempted to estimate this for cgcs5926 by assuming a total population of about 2000 carbon stars in the galaxy , and an effective surface density of 0.5 per square degree .",
    "this estimate is based on known sources within the cgcs and is likely a severe underestimate .",
    "the cgcs contains 5 carbon stars within the 12 square area of the gbs , close to what @xcite assumed .",
    "while it is true that carbon stars appear to be exceptionally rare in the bulge , systematic surveys have found that there are more than this .",
    "we can make some more realistic estimates based on other studies of carbon stars in the bulge .",
    "first , we can compare with the catalog of @xcite .",
    "34 stars were identified in 9 fields ( with some overlap ) . on average",
    "they find 4 carbon stars per 55arcmin square field implying a density of 4.8 carbon stars per square degree , an order of magnitude higher than @xcite assumed . alternatively",
    ", we can note that @xcite found just 5 carbon stars among 2187 m5 or later type giants surveyed in the bulge , corresponding to a c - m ratio of 0.0023 .",
    "the besancon galactic model @xcite predicts a density of 7300 m59 giants per square degree in the vicinity of cx332 . with the c - m ratio of @xcite",
    ", we then expect around 17 carbon stars per square degree .",
    "this is a little higher than found by @xcite , but cx332 is closer to the plane than their fields were .",
    "considering 17 carbon stars per square degree to be the most optimistic prediction , we then expect a probability of @xmath51 that a carbon star will be found within 1arcsec of cx332 , or @xmath52 of a chance alignment within 1arcsec of any of the 1640 gbs x - ray sources .",
    "this supports our conclusion that star a is most likely to be the true optical counterpart to cx332 , and from here on this work focuses on the properties of this object .",
    "we begin classification of star a by comparing the 50007000spectrum to standard examples from @xcite . for each one , we convolve the template spectrum with a 10  gaussian to provide a closer match to the instrumental resolution of the vlt spectrum , and scale the spectrum to match our count levels .",
    "adjustments in this scaling were made between different wavelengths to correct for differences in the shape of the two spectra .",
    "the relative strength of features between the template and our target should thus be independent of uncertainties in calibration and dereddening of our spectrum .",
    "the primary diagnostic that can be used to reject many of the atlas spectra is the strength of the c@xmath3 swan bands at 5200  and 5600 .",
    "both the overall strength of the bands , and the relative strength of the two , distinguish different classifications , although this primarily is a discriminant of the c@xmath3 index .",
    "we find that fair matches are possible with either c - r types or c - n types .",
    "all of the c - j spectra included by @xcite show much stronger c@xmath3 swan bands ( c@xmath3 indices of 5 or 5.5 ) than observed and can be discounted , as can the barium stars which show much weaker bands .",
    "the c - h stars are a closer match , but still notably inferior to c - r or c - n types , at least within the parameter ranges sampled by @xcite .    among the c - r stars , the best fit was for hd223392 ( c - r3@xmath53 , c@xmath3 4 ) , with a reasonable match also for hd76846 ( c - r2@xmath54 , c@xmath3 4 ) .",
    "c - r stars with c@xmath3 indices of 1.5 - 3.0 substantially underpredict the carbon bands , those with c@xmath3 index of 5.5 strongly overpredict them .",
    "the best fitting c - n star was bd  @xmath553336 ( c - n4 , c@xmath3 3 ) .",
    "the closest match we could find among the c - h stars was hd209621 ( c - h3 , c@xmath3 4.5 ) .",
    "this reproduces the c@xmath3 bands , but underpredicts the strength of cn .",
    "we show the spectra of star a dereddened with @xmath40 ( see section  [ distancesection ] ) together with the best spectral matches in figure  [ specfig ] .",
    "while we have examined all of the digitized spectrum from @xcite , we are limited in parameter space by the stars included , and since our primary diagnostic is the strength of the c@xmath3 bands , we mainly are sensitive to the c@xmath3 index , rather than the temperature . to check this classification we also examined the vlt @xmath16 band spectrum in the vicinity of the caii triplet which is sensitive to temperature in carbon stars @xcite .",
    "we show this region in figure  [ nirspecfig ] .",
    "@xcite classifies the near - ir spectra into a temperature sequence from c0c7 .",
    "this system does not exactly correspond to the system of @xcite which is the basis of the @xcite atlas , but we can identify correspondences between the two systems where stars are present in both . in particular , @xcite includes many c5 objects , the majority of which are also classified as c - n5 by @xcite .",
    "the first thing we note is the presence of multiple prominent cn bandheads .",
    "this rules out the c0c2 classifications , in which these are virtually undetected ; the first class in which they are prominent is c3 .",
    "the relative strength of the caii lines to the cn bands points to not much later than this , as the 8498  line should be overwhelmed by cn by c5 .",
    "cn and caii features thus point to a c3c4 classification .",
    "the c0c2 stars identified by @xcite are mostly a mix of c - r and c - h stars with temperature indices of 13 .",
    "since these do not match our spectrum , we can rule out an early c - r classification , leaving the near - ir spectra favoring a c - r35 or c - n35 , roughly consistent with the red classification .",
    "we conclude that star a is a late c - r or early c - n star .",
    "both types are considered to be near the bottom of the agb @xcite .",
    "the optical counterpart to cx332 was identified as an irregular variable using ogle data @xcite , with @xmath16 magnitude listed as 15.156 , and no @xmath56 detection .",
    "we reproduce the lightcurve in figure  [ oglefig ] and indicate the times of our observations .",
    "the behavior seen is quite typical of carbon stars on the agb , with the dips indicating periods of dust formation .",
    "this star would be classified as a slow irregular variable ( lb ; * ? ? ?",
    "the dips are relatively shallow compared to some carbon stars , and so the dust formation is modest and there is unlikely to be significant local extinction to be accounted for .",
    "the behavior does indicate that the star is an agb star , as variability and dust formation is not seen in the red clump giants associated with early c - r stars ( e.g.  the tabulation of * ? ? ?",
    "the variability also is additional evidence against identifying star a as a barium or c - h star in which the carbon overabundance is a result of binary evolution ; these are typically non - variable .",
    "we note that a few of the later c - h type stars listed by @xcite are irregular or semi - regular variables .",
    "c - h stars appear to be population ii counterparts to r stars ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and so it is likely that they share the dichotomy between early and late c - r stars @xcite with some late c - h stars not being products of binary evolution . in any case",
    ", c - h stars provided a poorer match to the spectrum of star a than c - r or c - n stars .",
    "the variability then supports the identification of the counterpart as either a late c - r or c - n type agb star .",
    "the low amplitude behavior is quite consistent with other late c - r stars in particular , for example the c - r4 stars listed by @xcite are all semi - regular ( sr ) or irregular ( lb ) variables . of these ,",

    "this is consistent with the quite modest dust production implied by the low - amplitude ogle lightcurve .",

    "if we then assume a distance of 8kpc , we derive an absolute magnitude around @xmath67 .",
    "allowing for a range in bulge distances from 513kpc results in an absolute magnitude range from @xmath68 to @xmath69 .",
    "these values are towards the bottom of the range of the sample of @xcite . at 8kpc",
    "it would be more luminous than the carbon stars sz  lep and ru  pup , so there is no actual inconsistency .",
    "the observed @xmath63 band brightness is thus consistent with a fairly low luminosity agb type carbon star in the bulge .",
    "the inferred low luminosity is not unique to star a , but is a common characteristic of bulge carbon stars @xcite .",
    "we examine this systematically in figure  [ azzopardifig ] .",
    "we assume a distance of 8kpc and extinction values from @xcite to deduce unreddened @xmath70 colors and absolute @xmath63 band magnitudes of both star a and azzopardi s sample . for comparison , we also combine absolute magnitudes from @xcite with 2mass colors to add nearby c - n stars to the diagram . for the latter ,",
    "the 2mass photometry is saturated , and quoted magnitudes are deduced from fitting the wings of the profiles .",
    "this introduces larger uncertainties , but should be useful to crudely indicate the typical colors .",
    "since these objects all lie within 1kpc , we have assumed @xmath71 is negligible ; for a typical local extinction of @xmath72mags per kpc , we then expect @xmath73 , which is smaller than the uncertainty in the 2mass color .",
    "these objects are not intended to define a complete sample of galactic carbon stars ; as noted by @xcite there are a variety of systematic selection effects in the _ hipparcos _ carbon star sample . rather the intent is to indicate where the ` classic ' c - n type agb stars lie .        we see quite a striking separation in the diagram , with the bulge carbon stars being systematically bluer than the local disk c - n stars , and a little less luminous .",
    "the equivalent comparison with carbon stars in the sagittarius dwarf galaxy was made in figure  4 of @xcite , where the difference in properties was used to argue against associating the bulge carbon stars with that galaxy .",
    "star a falls securely within the region occupied by the azzopardi s bulge carbon stars , and does not overlap in color with the distribution of local c - n stars .",
    "this star therefore appears to be a bona fide member of the bulge carbon star population .    among the objects from @xcite ,",
    "we note a division into two groups in the diagram , with star a lying among the more luminous objects .",
    "it is possible that the lower group represents the top of the bulge carbon star red giant branch , with the upper group being the agb .",
    "this is consistent with the classification of star a as a low luminosity agb star , and the evidence for episodes of dust formation in its ogle lightcurve .",
    "we show the effect of assuming a distance range of 511kpc in figure  [ azzopardifig ] with a dashed line , assuming that extinction varies linearly with distance .",
    "the latter is a crude assumption , but it should be remembered that at the latitude of cx332 , the line of sight is still only @xmath74pc above the plane at the distance of the bulge , so has not completely left the disk extinction . allowing a closer distance @xmath75kpc would move star a into the middle of the upper clump of bulge carbon stars",
    ". it may thus be on the near side of the bulge .",
    "cx332 was only detected once by the gbs , in observation i d 8693 , with 8 reported photons @xcite .",
    "this is clearly insufficient for a rigorous spectral analysis , but we may still hope to recover some information about the hardness of the spectrum from the channel energies of individual photons . in order to ensure uniformity , @xcite truncated observations longer than 2ks to a 2ks length .",
    "observation 8693 had a livetime of 2.16ks , and cx332 was 7.85arcmin off - axis , so we re - extract events from the full exposure time with an aperture radius of 8.1arcsec .",
    "we recover 10 events below 8kev from the source region and expect about 1 from the background .",
    "we present a histogram of event channel energies in fig .",
    "[ xspecfig ] .",
    "the spectrum is clearly hard , with no events detected below 1.5kev , and multiple events above 3.0kev .",
    "@xcite surveyed _ rosat _ spectra of symbiotics .",
    "they classified them into three groups , @xmath76 , and @xmath77 .",
    "@xcite reexamined the classification scheme in the light of the harder coverage offered by a _ swift _ survey .",
    "they added a fourth @xmath78 class and also identified a number of sources exhibiting both @xmath79 and @xmath78 components .",
    "class @xmath38 shows supersoft emission with negligible counts above 0.4kev .",
    "this is believed to originate in quasi - steady nuclear burning on a white dwarf .",
    "class @xmath79 shows harder emission characterized by a thermal spectrum around @xmath80k , with most of the photons at energies below 2.4kev .",
    "this may originate in the interaction of winds from the red giant and the white dwarf s accretion disk .",
    "the @xmath77 class of @xcite originally contained just two objects , the syxb gx1 + 4 and hen1591 which is suggested to also host a neutron star .",
    "@xcite generalize this to neutron star systems with hard spectra characterized by comptonized emission with no emission lines .",
    "the new @xmath78 class also have hard , absorbed spectra , but with a thermal spectrum with strong emission lines .",
    "this is attributed to accretion powered boundary layer emission from a white dwarf surface .",
    "cx332 is clearly not consistent with the @xmath38 class , and also has a harder spectrum than is typical of @xmath79 class sources .",
    "our observed median event energy is around 2.8kev , with only one event detected with a channel energy below 2.0kev .",
    "it most likely fits into either the @xmath77 classification , as a neutron star syxb , or the @xmath78 class as a white dwarf symbiotic lacking optical emission lines .",
    "if we characterize the spectrum of cx332 with a power - law , then we find that a @xmath81 power - law subject to interstellar extinction does produce the observed median event channel energy . at the galactic center distance",
    ", this would imply a luminosity @xmath82ergs@xmath2",
    ". this would be quite typical of an syxb , but is higher than the @xmath83ergs@xmath2 typically seen in @xmath78 components from white dwarf symbiotics @xcite .",
    "a simple argument can test whether the @xmath84ergss@xmath2 for cx332 is too high for the @xmath78 class of symbiotic stars .",
    "@xcite performed detailed simulations of the optical spectra of symbiotics with hot stars of different temperatures and luminosities , and found that an accretion rate of @xmath85m@xmath86yr@xmath2 onto a 1m@xmath86 white dwarf was the lower limit for detection of emission lines in the optical spectrum , converting to a bolometric luminosity of @xmath87 ergs / s .",
    "@xcite calculate the bolometric luminosities of a large number of known symbiotic stars , and show that all but one have a luminosity of the hot component above 10l@xmath86 , corresponding to @xmath88ergss@xmath2 .",
    "thus , if the observed x - ray emission is optically thin radiation from an accretion flow onto a white dwarf ( as seen in low - accretion - rate cataclysmic variables ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , then the total accretion luminosity can be consistent with the lack of observed optical emission lines and this possibility can not be rejected .",
    "we have identified star a , apparently a late c - r type carbon star near the base of the agb as the most likely optical counterpart to cx332 .",
    "there have been very limited x - ray detections of agb stars .",
    "@xcite found mira at a luminosity of @xmath89ergs@xmath2 .",
    "@xcite examined observations covering 13 agb stars and found only two reasonably confident detections at likely luminosities @xmath90ergs@xmath2 .",
    "all three of these agb stars have quite soft x - ray spectra peaking around 1kev , and in all three cases a binary companion could be the origin of the x - rays . the inferred x - ray luminosity and hardness of cx332 thus appear inconsistent with intrinsic emission from agb stars and instead point to a symbiotic nature .",
    "this allows the possibility of either a white dwarf or neutron star companion , based on other known symbiotics .",
    "a black hole companion is also possible in principle , although would be unprecedented .",
    "the x - ray hardness and luminosity of cx332 , and the lack of optical emission lines of star a , are all very typical of the majority of known neutron star syxbs , and cx332 would fit well within this class . currently only one syxb has been proposed with a carbon star companion , cgcs5926 @xcite , and it is not in the bulge .",
    "white dwarf symbiotics are typically characterized by soft x - ray spectra and optical emission lines .",
    "chandra _ and _ swift _ observations , however ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) are showing that some symbiotics do also have strong , hard components in their spectra , and some _ only _ have hard components .",
    "in a few cases , e.g.  nq  gem , these also lack emission lines in some observations @xcite , resulting in properties quite similar to cx332 , although @xmath78 sources without at least h@xmath38 emission are still the exception rather than the rule .",
    "this may be a consequence of lower accretion rates onto the white dwarf leading to optically thinner harder x - ray spectra and lower uv luminosities with which to ionize the red giant wind . in searching for",
    "x - ray sources within the bulge , _ chandra _ will more effectively identify objects such as these than it will identify classic white dwarf symbiotics with softer x - ray spectra .",
    "hence we can expect that an x - ray selected symbiotic population will have different demographics than one selected optically .",
    "this is reflected in the sample of symbiotic candidates identified by @xcite , which is dominated by sources with hard x - ray spectra and a deficit of optical emission lines .",
    "disentangling the two populations of syxbs and x - ray selected white dwarf symbiotics is then a challenging task observationally , but an essential one if we are to reliably determine the syxb population of the galaxy and test models such as that of @xcite .",
    "we have examined the closest optical counterpart candidates to the galactic bulge survey ( gbs ) source cx332 .",
    "the source lies close to an infrared - bright star that we identify as an agb - type carbon star , most likely a late c - r star , or possibly early c - n .",
    "carbon stars are extremely rare in the bulge and so we estimate a probability of only 0.1%  of finding even one chance coincidence with a carbon star in the whole gbs . if the x - ray source is associated with the carbon star then we have argued that the x - ray luminosity and hardness , and lack of optical emission lines are more consistent with a symbiotic x - ray binary ( syxb ) rather than with a white dwarf system , although the latter can not be confidently ruled out .",
    "if this interpretation is correct it will be only the second proposed syxb with a carbon star companion , and the first based on a secure x - ray detection .",
