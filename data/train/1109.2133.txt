    "deuteron - gold collisions at rhic provide a means to explore nuclear effects on the initial - state parton densities in the nucleus , which is vitally important for understanding the baseline production in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "rhic experiments have shown that single inclusive hadron yields in the forward ( deuteron ) rapidity direction for @xmath7 gev @xmath0aucollisions are suppressed relative to @xmath6+@xmath6collisions  @xcite .",
    "the mechanism for the suppression has not been firmly established .",
    "many effects have been proposed for this suppression , such as gluon saturation  @xcite , initial state energy loss  @xcite , parton recombination  @xcite , multi - parton interactions  @xcite , and leading and higher - twist shadowing  @xcite .",
    "one set of measurements that might help to distinguish between the competing models is forward azimuthally correlated di - hadron correlation functions , which directly probe di - jet production through their 2@xmath82 back - to - back peak at @xmath9 .",
    "this technique has been used extensively at rhic and is described in detail elsewhere  @xcite .",
    "the di - hadron results presented here were obtained from @xmath6+@xmath6and @xmath0auruns in 2008 with the phenix detector and include a new electromagnetic calorimeter , the muon piston calorimeter ( mpc ) , with an acceptance of @xmath10 in pseudorapidity and @xmath11 .",
    "di - hadron measurements can probe more precise ranges of parton @xmath3 in a gold nucleus than do single hadron probes ( e.g. , ) . at forward rapidities",
    ", a single hadron probe will cover a very broad range of x , @xmath12 , thus mixing together the shadowing , anti - shadowing , and even emc effects  @xcite .",
    "azimuthally correlated di - hadron measurements also enhance the di - jet fraction in the event selection , since one selects only the back - to - back hadrons .",
    "+ @xmath6(open points ) , @xmath0auperipheral ( 60 - 88% , triangles ) , and @xmath0aucentral collisions ( 0 - 20% , solid points ) at @xmath13 gev .",
    "the trigger @xmath2 ranges from 1.1 to 7 gev / c and the associated s have @xmath14 gev / c .",
    "systematic errors of up to 30% on the near side ( @xmath15 ) have not been shown .",

    "systematic errors of up to 30% on the near side ( @xmath15 ) have not been shown .",
    "the subtracted pedestals , b@xmath16 , are shown for each case.,title=\"fig : \" ]    by performing several correlation measurements with particles at different and rapidities , one can systematically scan different @xmath3 ranges with an observable that is enhanced for the leading - order perturbative qcd component . probing",
    "the @xmath3 dependence of the effect is an important test since most models predict that any effects should be stronger at smaller @xmath3 .",
    "particles at higher pseudorapidities are produced from smaller @xmath3 , so measuring hadrons from more forward rapidities should probe smaller x.",
    "for this analysis , back - to - back -or hadron - pairs are measured with one particle at mid - rapidity , and the other at forward rapidity .",
    "back - to - back cluster - pairs are also measured where both are in the forward rapidity region .",
    "the clusters are reconstructed from the energy deposit of photons in the mpc , and are estimated to be at least 80% dominated by s , with the remainder coming from single photons from decays of @xmath17 s and from direct photons .",
    "further details of the analysis are available in  @xcite .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : mpc_corr ] , the away - side peak for @xmath0aucentral collisions appears significantly suppressed compared to @xmath6+@xmath6collisions and peripheral @xmath0aucollisions .",
    "this effect is large for the mid - forward di - hadron correlations and becomes even larger for the forward - forward correlations . within large errors ,",
    "the gaussian widths of the away - side correlation peak for the mid - forward di - hadron correlations remain the same between @xmath6+@xmath6and central @xmath0au . for the forward - forward case , uncertainties in the pedestal level from the underlying event and the strong suppression of the away - side peak make extracting the width unreliable . for this case",
    ", the away side peak width in central @xmath0aucollisions is allowed to vary up to twice as much as in @xmath6+@xmath6when accounting for this systematic uncertainty .     versus @xmath18 for peripheral ( 60 - 88% , in red ) and central ( 0 - 20% , in blue ) @xmath0aucollisions at @xmath13 gev , and compared to the eps09 lo @xmath19 curves at a scale @xmath20 = 4 gev@xmath21  @xcite . ]",
    "the observed suppression is quantified by studying the relative yield , @xmath22  @xcite , of correlated back - to - back hadron pairs in @xmath0au collision compared to @xmath6+@xmath6collisions scaled with the average number of binary nucleon collisions @xmath23 , @xmath24 this is simply the analog of the usual nuclear modification factor but for hadron pairs .",
    "the @xmath25 are the @xmath6+@xmath6or @xmath0auinelastic cross - sections , while @xmath26 is the cross - section for di - hadron pair production .",
    "the is calculated using the correlated away side peak after subtracting the pedestal @xmath27 . decreases with increasing number of binary collisions , @xmath23 , or equivalently with increasing nuclear thickness .",
    "the suppression also increases with decreasing particle @xmath2 and is significantly larger for forward - forward hadron pairs than for mid - forward pairs . the observed suppression of @xmath22 versus nuclear thickness , @xmath2 and @xmath17 points to large cold nuclear matter effects arising at low parton momentum fractions x in the nucleus probed by the deuteron .",
    "this trend is seen more clearly in fig .",
    "[ fig : jdax ] where @xmath22 is plotted versus @xmath28 for all pair selections in @xmath17 and @xmath2 . in the case of 2@xmath82 leading order ( lo ) processes , the variable @xmath18 is lower than @xmath29 by the mean fragmentation fraction , @xmath30 , of the struck parton in the au nucleus . since @xmath18 is an entirely experimental defined quantity , it should be reproducable in any theoretical framework .",
    "in a leading order pqcd picture , the variable is @xmath31 for partons a+b going to outgoing jets c+d , which then fragment to hadrons with longitudinal fractions @xmath32 , @xmath33 . in the above convolutions over p+p and d+a ,",
    "most of the terms are expected to be roughly similar between p+p and d+au except for the nuclear gluon pdf .",
    "naively , might be largely dominated by the modification to the nuclear gluon parton distribution function ( pdf s ) , since most of the events with di - hadrons at forward rapidities consist of a high - x parton from the deuteron and a low - x gluon from the gold nucleus . assuming this to be true",
    "then @xmath34 in figure  [ fig : jdax ] the values are overlaid with the eps09 curves  @xcite .",
    "the values for the peripheral bins are above the best fit eps09 , while the central bins are below .",
    "the eps09 curves are taken largely from nuclear deep inelastic scattering and represent an averaged value of over all centralities .",
    "the values for the most central bin at the lowest x are well below the eps09 curves .",
    "this is qualititatively consistent with the expectations for the color - glass condensate  @xcite , which posits an extreme form of shadowing due to the onset of gluon saturation .",
    "if nature is kind and this data can be interpreted in terms of a simple lo pqcd picture , it may be possible to extract , which is extremely important for understanding the quark gluon plasma since it forms the baseline for production in heavy ion collisions .",
    "in addition , if the large suppression of observed in central @xmath0aucollisions is from gluon saturation , it may be possible to study the dependence of that saturation on the thickness of the nucleus .",
    "one possible test of whether these ideas are correct would be to use extractions of from this data to predict @xmath35 data in @xmath0aucollisions from phenix .",
