    "the formation of spatial and temporal internal scales can in part be associated to the stretching and tilting of vortical structures .",
    "many aspects of the behavior of turbulent fields have been associated to this phenomenon : the onset of instability , vorticity intensification or damping , or the three - dimensionalization of the flow field @xcite . in the standard picture of turbulence , the energy cascade to smaller scales is interpreted in terms of the stretching of vortices due to the interaction with similar eddy size ( see for example @xcite ) .",
    "a number of statistical details on the stretching phenomenon and the closely related enstrophy production can be found in the monography by tsinober ( 2001 , see in particular chapter 6 , @xcite ) .",
    "although the important physical role of these inertial phenomena is recognized , the literature does not often include statistical information on quantities such as the magnitude or the components of @xmath5 .",
    "for instance , in a letter to nature ( 2003 ) dedicated to the measurements of intense rotation and dissipation in turbulent flows , zeff et al .",
    "@xcite observe that the understanding of the temporal interactions between stretching and vorticity is crucial to the science of extreme events in turbulence . however , the statistics presented there concern dissipation and enstrophy and not directly stretching .",
    "the literature more often includes statistical information concerning other gradient quantities such as the strain rate or the rate - of - rotation tensors , and , in particular , their fundamental constituents : the longitudinal or transverse velocity derivatives . over the last 20 years",
    ", statistics on the skewness and flatness factors of the velocity derivative have been considered in a number of laboratory and numerical studies that show how these quantities increase monotonically with the reynolds number , see e.g. @xcite and the review by sreenivasan and antonia ( 1997)@xcite .    in the case of turbulent wall flows ,",
    "laboratory measurements of both the mean and the r.m.s . of fluctuations of the stretching components across the two - dimensional boundary layer have been reported by andreapoulos and honkan ( 2001 ) @xcite . in this study ,",
    "the normalized r.m.s values of the stretching components are very significant throughout the boundary layer and reach values that are one order of magnitude larger than the mean span - wise component ( the only significant mean component , however and only in the near wall region ) .",
    "the values observed for the r.m.s . of the stretching range from 0.04 , close to the wall , to about 0.004 in the outer part .    in a study concerning the structure and dynamics of vorticity and rate of strain in incompressible homogeneous turbulence , nomura and post ( 1998),@xcite demonstrate the significance of both local dynamics ( influence of local vorticity ) and spatial structure ( influence through non - local pressure hessian ) in the interaction of the vorticity and strain rate tensor .",
    "the behaviour of high - amplitude rotation - dominated events can not be solely represented by local dynamics due to the formation of distinct spatial structure . instead , high - amplitude strain dominated regions are generated predominantly by local dynamics .",
    "the associated structure is less organized and more discontinous than the one associated with rotation dominated events .",
    "they conclude that non - local effects are significant in the dynamics of small scale motion .",
    "this should be considered in the interpretation of single - point statistics .",
    "characterizations of small - scale turbulence should consider not only the typical structures there present but also typical structure interactions . in this context",
    "these authors offer the radial distribution of the magnitude of the strain rate tensor normalized on the enstrophy . in this paper the maximum value of this magnitude",
    "is found close to 0.2 .",
    "laboratory statistical information on the stretching of field lines can be found in @xcite . here",
    ", probability density functions of the logarithm of the local stretching in n cycles were obtained for several two - dimensional time - periodic confined flows exhibiting chaotic advection .",
    "the stretching fields were observed to be highly correlated in space when n is large , and the probability distributions were observed to be similar for different flows .",
    "however , a few examples in literature can also be cited regarding direct results for stretching - tilting statistics .",
    "for instance , recently experimental and numerical confirmation has been found of the predominance of three dimensional turbulent vortex stretching in the positive net enstrophy production .",
    "these aspects have been extensively considered in tsinober ( 2000 ) @xcite and in the 2001 monography @xcite , where a number of statistical geometrical details concerning the vortex alignement , compression , tilting , and folding are outlined . through two papers , constantin , procaccia and segel ( 1995 ) @xcite , galanti , procaccia and segel ( 1996 )",
    "@xcite consider the stretching and its relationships with the amplification of vorticity and the straightening of the vortex lines .",
    "they show that the same stretching that amplifies the vorticity also tends to straighten out the vortex lines .",
    "they also show that in well - aligned vortex tubes , the self - stretching rate of the vorticity is proportional to the ratio of the vorticity and the radius of curvature . in this",
    "context,@xcite gives statistics on the stretching and vortex line curvature .",
    "numerically this is seen as the appearance of high correlations between the stretching and the straightness of the vortex lines . regarding to this issue , an important universal feature of fully developed turbulent flows is the preferential alignment of vorticity along the eigen direction of the intermediate eigenvalue of the strain - rate tensor .",
    "a number of works both experimental and numerical studies on this result are available ( tsinober , kit and dracos jfm ( 1992 ) , @xcite , kholmyansky , tsinober and s. yorish pof ( 2001 ) , @xcite , gulitski et al .",
    "jfm ( 2007 a , b , c ) , @xcite and chevillard et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , @xcite )",
    ". it should be noticed , however , that in the case of _ nonlocal _ strain rate , hamlington , schumacher and dahm @xcite , have observed a direct assessment of vorticity alignment with the most extensional eigenvector by using data from highly resolved direct numerical simulations .    in the present study , for the case of isotropic turbulence ( @xmath6 , @xcite ) , we consider statistics related to the intensity of the stretching term in the equation for vorticity .",
    "if we consider the general instantaneous local intrinsic anisotropy of turbulent fields , looking at stretched structures as filaments and sheets , we would like to be able to disentangle them to follow and understand better their evolution and detailed dynamics .",
    "isotropic filtering is unable to carry out this job .",
    "we have conceived a probe function , the ratio between the magnitude of the vortex stretching and the enstrophy , to empirically and statistically measure the local activity of the stretching phenomenon ( see section ii ) .",
    "in addition , we propose an alternative to the commonly used isotropic filter : the cross filter .",
    "this is a new empirical , and at the moment limited , attempt to introduce an anisotropic filtering . in section iii",
    ", we analyze the survival function of the normalized stretching by using the cross filter acting directly on the velocity fourier space .",
    "we do this in the hope of qualitatively highlighting aspects related to the role of the three - dimensional structures known as blobs , sheets and filaments and their hypothetical fourier counterparts .",
    "this study can be viewed as a kind of test for this idea and tries to highlight its limits .",
    "concluding remarks are made in section iv .",
    "with reference to the phenomena described by the inertial nonlinear nonconvective part of the vorticity transport equation , let us introduce a local measure of the process of three - dimensional inner scales formation    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is the velocity field , @xmath9 is the strain rate tensor , and @xmath10 is the vorticity vector .",
    "the numerator , the so called stretching - tilting term of the vorticity equation , is zero in two - dimensional flows . in 3 d fields ,",
    "it is commonly believed to be responsible for the transfer of the kinetic energy from larger to smaller scales ( positive or extensional stretching ) and viceversa ( negative or compressional stretching ) . according to definition ( 1 ) ,",
    "@xmath11 depends on the local instantaneous velocity and vorticity fields . in this study , we leave aside the peculiarity associated to the convective forcing and focus on the action of the fluctuation field only . for simplicity , we consider here the fluctuation of an homogeneous isotropic turbulent field ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the stretching term plays an important role in the enstrophy production , in the previous definition the normalization by @xmath12 was adopted .",
    "it should be recalled that the square of the vorticity magnitude is the only invariant of the rate of rotation tensor which is non zero and is also the square of the frobenius norm , an invariant norm of the rate of strain tensor .",
    "for this reason , we considered the enstrophy a good candidate as reference quantity for the product @xmath5 .",
    "in fact , as it can be seen below , the survival probability distribution function of @xmath11 is very small for values larger than @xmath13 .",
    "function @xmath11 was evaluated over a fully resolved homogeneous isotropic incompressible steady in the mean turbulence in order to look for the typical range of values of @xmath14 and to relate them to the behavior of the various turbulence scales present in an isotropic field .",
    "the dataset consists of @xmath0 resolution grid point direct numerical simulation ( dns ) of an isotropic navier - stokes forced field at reynolds @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "each instant in the simulation is statistically equivalent , and provides a statistical set of a little more than @xmath15 elements .",
    "we considered the statistics that were obtained averaging over the full domain in one instant .",
    "the field has been slightly modified in order to filter out instantaneous effects of the forcing , in other words , a turbulent kinetic energy inhomogeneity of about @xmath16 ( in the spatial coordinate system ) . as this bias",
    "was generated by the energy supply at the large scale range , the two largest scales have been filtered out .",
    "the resolved part of the energy spectrum extends up to @xmath17 .",
    "the inertial range extends from @xmath18 to @xmath19 , see the compensated version of the 3d spectrum in figure [ spe3_compensated ] .",
    "the higher wave - numbers , which are affected by the aliasing error , are not shown .",
    "we focus now on a few statistical properties of @xmath20 .",
    "the pdf of the components of this vector ( which are statistically equivalent , since the field is isotropic ) is shown in figure [ gaussiana ] .",
    "symmetry with the vertical axis is expected because of isotropy ; the skewness is in fact approximately @xmath21 , which is not meaningfully far from zero .",
    "however , the distribution can not be approximated with a _",
    "gaussian _ function .",
    "in fact , the actual kurtosis is approximately 55 , which is very far from the gaussian value of 3 .",
    "-10 mm -10 mm    the range of values attained by @xmath14 is wide .",
    "values as high as a few hundreds were observed at a sparse spatial points . in order to read the typical values of @xmath14 , we study its _",
    "survival function_. by denoting @xmath22 the cumulative distribution function ( cdf ) of @xmath14 , the survival function is defined as the complement to @xmath23 of the cdf , @xmath24    for each threshold @xmath25 , @xmath26 describes the _ probability that @xmath14 takes greater values than @xmath25_.    it has been found that , when @xmath14 is evaluated on a well resolved isotropic turbulent field , the probability that @xmath27 is almost zero , see figure [ confr_cdf ] .",
    "thus , @xmath28 can be considered the maximum statistical value that @xmath14 can reach when the turbulence is fully developed .",
    "by means of suitable convolutions , the application of filters to the velocity field allows the behavior of the function @xmath29 to be studied in relation to the different turbulence scale ranges .",
    "this analysis is carried out using two spectral filters , a high pass and a band - stop filter . to focus in an empirical way on the three principal kind of geometrical structures observed in turbulence , filaments , sheets and blobs , we use here a highly anisotropic kind of filter , which is less traditional than the axisymmetric - type filter . of course",
    ", given the inadequacy of the spectral representation to account for the complex three - dimensional geometry of the turbulent structures commonly seen through visualization tools , the approach we use here is not rigorous and should be considered no more than propaedeutical .",
    "the first filter is a sort of high - pass filter , which we refer to as _ cross filter _ and which allows the contribution of the structures that are characterized by at least one _ large dimension _ to be removed . from the fourier point of view",
    ", this means that the structures whose wave - vector has at least one small component are filtered out .",
    "one can here think about elongated structures as filaments and sheets or very large globular structures . in figure",
    "[ disegno_croce ] , a graphical scheme of the filtering in the wave number plane @xmath30 can be seen .",
    "the first filter we consider is here represented in blue and is a kind of high - pass filter which affects all wave - numbers that , along any possible direction , have at least one component under a certain threshold .",
    "given the threshold @xmath31 , the filter reduces the contribution of the modes with wave number components    @xmath32    the representation of this high - pass filter , @xmath33 , can be given by a function of the kind @xcite    @xmath34    since function @xmath33 filters any wavenumber that has at least one component lower than the threshold @xmath31 , it reduces the kinetic energy of the filamentous ( one component lower than @xmath31 ) , layered ( two components lower than @xmath31 ) and blobby ( three components lower than @xmath31 ) structures .",
    "this filter is efficient in reducing the integral scale of the turbulence @xcite .    by varying the value of the threshold , @xmath31 , it is possible to consider different scale ranges .",
    "the ranges @xmath35 are compared in figure [ croce_passaalto ] .",
    "the first filtering affects the energy - containing range , while the other two also include a part of the inertial range , which is visible in figure [ spe3_compensated ] .",
    "the plots in figure 5 have coherent behavior .",
    "the survival function @xmath36 for the @xmath37 filtering is slightly below the values of the distribution of the unfiltered turbulence .",
    "this trend is confirmed by the other two filterings , and the reduction grows as the threshold @xmath31 increases .",
    "the high - pass filter has the effect of _ decreasing _ the statistical values taken by @xmath29 in the domain .",
    "the wider the filtered range , the higher the effect on @xmath11 .",
    "it is possible to say that when we reduce the weight of the large - scale structures ( layers , filaments or blobs ) , the local stretching - tilting intensity decreases with respect to the vorticity magnitude . on average , the values of @xmath29",
    "go down . the wider the range affected , the lower the probability value becomes .",
    "this suggests that the large scales contribute more to the stretching - tilting ( the numerator of @xmath11 ) than to the magnitude of the vorticity fluctuation ( the denominator of @xmath11 ) .",
    "it should be noted that this trend is consistent with the results in @xcite .",
    "this consistency also includes results relevant to the behaviour of the stretching fluctuation and of the vorticity magnitude in boundary layer turbulence , see figures 6 and 9 in @xcite .",
    "for the wider range @xmath38 , a decrease of @xmath39 in the cumulative probability is observed for a stretching - tilting of about one half of the local vorticity .",
    "the decrease goes up to @xmath40 when statistically the stretching - tilting has the same magnitude of the vorticity , that is @xmath11 is close to 1 , see figure [ croce_passaalto ] .",
    "let us now consider the behavior of @xmath29 when the inertial and dissipative ranges are affected by the filtering , namely a band - stop filtering . in this case , the band width can be extended to obtain a low pass filtering .",
    "this filter can be obtained by reducing the contribution of a variable band ( see figure [ disegno_croce ] , part in red )    @xmath41    this yields the filter function @xmath42 @xmath43+\\phi(k_i ; k_{max } ) \\nonumber \\label{bsf}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the effects of the application of this band - stop filter on the probability @xmath44 are shown in figure [ croce_range_inerz ] .",
    "let us now consider the inertial range in an _ extended way _ , which includes the @xmath45 range plus all the scales which are not yet highly dissipative .",
    "the different bands are @xmath46 , large scale inertial filtering , @xmath47 intermediate scale inertial filtering , @xmath48 small scale inertial filtering , @xmath49 near dissipative , @xmath50 intermediate - inertial / small scale filtering , @xmath51 dissipative scale filtering .",
    "once again all the filtered ranges induce the same effects : for @xmath52 , a slight _ increase _ in the survival probability . for small values of @xmath25 , the most effective filtering ( i.e. the ones which produce the highest increase ) is the @xmath46 , while , for higher statistically relevant values , @xmath53 , the most effective result is obtained filtering over the whole inertial range , @xmath54 . in this case , an increase of about @xmath55 is observed for @xmath56 and of about @xmath40 for @xmath57    this highlights the fact that the structures of the inertial range contribute more to the intensity of the vorticity field than to stretching and tilting .",
    "the general trend is almost inverted with respect to the case of the high pass filtered turbulence ( compare the 0 - 40 and 10 - 40 results in figures 4 and 5 , respectively ) and this can be confirmed , with slight differences , as long as we enlarge the amplitude of the filtering band to get closer to the dissipative range .",
    "finally , moving toward the dissipative range ( @xmath58 ) , the band - stop filter becomes a sort of low - pass filter . by filtering these wave numbers , the obtained effect is minimum , although we have removed the contribution of more or less the highest 200 wave - numbers ( see figure [ croce_range_inerz ] ) .",
    "+        to see the effect of the filters on the vortical structures , the vorticity magnitude has been visualized in two ways .",
    "the first is a volume rendering of the surfaces where one of the vorticity components is close to the root mean square value , see figure [ omega_1_comp ] .",
    "the instantaneous field we are considering is homogeneous and isotropic , so all the components are statistically alike and it suffices to observe one component only . in panel",
    "( a ) the unfiltered field is visualized and a complex picture made of an elongated , thick , sleeve - like structures which are enfolded and twisted can be seen . in panel ( b )",
    "the structures with at least one wavenumber component below 20 are smoothed out , see equation ( [ cf ] ) .",
    "one here sees a more sparse distribution of mostly elongated and nearly flat structures with a much shorter length with respect to panel ( a ) .",
    "the mutual folding and twisting seems reduced .",
    "this image is related to the survival distribution in figure 5 , where a depression of stretching - tilting over the vorticity magnitude is reported for ratio values above 0.3 .",
    "panel ( c ) shows the band - stop filtered field , where wavenumbers in between 30 and 150 are smoothed out .",
    "basically , most of the inertial and larger dissipative structures are removed . here",
    ", it is interesting to observe that the surface is much more corrugated that in panel ( a ) , which leaves a definitive view of the small scale above wavenumber 150 .",
    "some of these structures are elongated , others are globular .",
    "the image does not discourage the idea that the large and the very small scales directly interact .",
    "finally , in panel ( d ) one sees the structures that have at least one wavenumber component in the range 0 - 30 . here ,",
    "large unruffled structures which are mainly globular can be seen . the images in panel ( c ) and",
    "( d ) represent instances of the statistical situation described in figure 6 , where the survival ratio of the stretching and vorticity intensities is enhanced with respect to the natural situation .",
    "thus , it seems that the partial absence of the inertial range amplifies the stretching - tilting process .",
    "it should also be noted that the structure spatial density is distributed in almost the same way in all the panels , though the density levels are different .    we have tried to visualize the filtering effect also by means of contour plots and pseudo color imaging of the vorticity magnitude in a flat section of the @xmath59 ,",
    "see figure [ all ] . here , the lines in the images in the left column are the contours of iso - surfaces of the vorticity magnitude .",
    "starting from the top , one sees the unfiltered field , the high pass filtered field ( the wavenumbers above 20 are kept ) , the @xmath60 band - stop , and the low pass filtered field ( the range @xmath61 is removed ) .",
    "the contour plot technique is very popular , but , apart from clearly showing the reduction of the turbulence scale size when the large scales are missing , it does not give much information .",
    "essentially , structure contours appear to have the peanut shape which typically hosts vortex dipoles .        .",
    "in the enlarged views in the central and right columns , the pseudocolor plots are richer in information . where the larger scales are removed , panels ( e ) and ( f ) , the survival probability of intense stretching is reduced .",
    "the range of variation for the vorticity magnitude is very large , the root mean square value is about seven times smaller than the maximum value .",
    "when only the large scales are left , panels ( m ) and ( n ) , the rms value is about one third of the maximum value and the stretching is enhanced . when the inertial scales are removed , the large scale appears to be wrapped by the small scales .",
    "the big dipoles are surrounded by thin wavy - like sheets and the small scales are attached to the large ones . in this situation",
    "it is not possible to neglect their direct interaction . in regions where a large scale is missing",
    ", the small scales are also missing .",
    "viceversa , a low level of direct interaction between the largest and the smallest scales would have been confirmed , if small scales had been sparsely distributed in regions where the large scales are not present and would not have surrounded the large structures in regions where the latter are present .",
    "pdfs of the cosine of the angle between vorticity ( ) , and the eigenvector , @xmath62 , of the rate of strain tensor ( @xmath63 ) .",
    "the red lines refer to unfiltered field ; the green lines refer to the wave number range 0 - 20 filtered out by using the high - pass cross filter ; the blue lines refer to the wave number range 30 - 150 filtered out by using the band - stop cross filter.,title=\"fig : \" ] -5 mm -5 mm    to complement the understanding of the visualization in relation to the anisotropic filtering here used , we have considered the alignment between the eigenvectors of the strain rate tensor and the direction of the vorticity .",
    "function @xmath11 in fact , see equation ( 1 ) , can also be written as @xmath64^{1/2}$ ] where @xmath65 is the magnitude of the strain rate tensor , @xmath66 are the eigenvalues of the strain rate tensor @xmath63 normalized by @xmath65 , @xmath67 , and @xmath68 describe the alignments between the eigenvectors of @xmath63 , denoted @xmath62 , and the direction of the vorticity @xmath69 .",
    "figure [ grafico_cosdir ] shows the probability density function of these alignments in the reference unfiltered field and in two filtered cases described in this work : the high pass filter where the smallest @xmath70 wavenumbers are removed , see equation ( 3 ) and the band - stop filter where wavenumbers @xmath60 are removed , see equation ( 4 ) .",
    "we first observe that the standard trend of alignments is not fully spoiled by the filtering . in both filtering cases ,",
    "eigenvector 2 reduces its alignment , while eigenvector 3 reduces its misalignment .",
    "conversely , eigenvector 1 instead shows a different behavior . in the band - stop filtering case ( large scale dominate )",
    "eigenvector 1 slightly increases the alignment . in the high - pass filtering ,",
    "eigenvector 1 reduces the alignment that becomes statistically equal to that of the eigenvector 3 .",
    "this is confirmed , see table 1 , by considering the ratio among the field averaged strain rate tensor eigenvalues and related component of the enstrophy production , @xmath71 , where @xmath72 is the average over all the computational domain ( @xmath0 grid point box ) , @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "all filters increase the gap between the eigenvalue @xmath2 and @xmath3 and the gap between @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    ". however , when the large scales are missing , eigenvalues 1 and 3 are very close in modulus .",
    "the same happens to the modulus of their related enstrophy production components .",
    "when the inertial scales and part , or the entire , dissipative range are removed the mutual relation among the eigenvalues and the modulus of the production components changes less with respect to the natural turbulence .    in all the three cases the filtering reduces the average values of the largest and intermediate eigenvalue , @xmath2 and @xmath3 .    at this point ,",
    "let us consider the dual nature of the filaments and sheets , as regards their inclusion in the categories of the small and large scales .",
    "a filament which is filtered out by the filter @xmath33 because it has a small wave number ( the axial wave number component ) , will have two large wave number components ( the ones normal to the filament axis ) . due to these wave components",
    ", it will also be filtered out by the filter @xmath42 .",
    "a similar situation also holds for the sheets .",
    "thus filaments and sheets are always partially removed when a filtering , either anisotropic or isotropic , is applied .",
    "the situation changes with compact structures ( the blob ) , which non ambiguously belong either to the large scale range or to the intermediate - small scale range . the different behavior shown in figures",
    "[ croce_passaalto ] and [ croce_range_inerz ] is therefore mainly due to the blob contributions , and , since the variation in the cumulative distributions is opposite and almost of the same magnitude , it is possible to deduce that the partial removal of the background filaments and sheets , which is always done regardless of the filter typology ( high pass , band pass , low pass , .. ) , is not statistically relevant . in other words , it appears reasonable to conclude that until a better way to select and remove anisotropic structures such as filaments and sheets is found , first order statistical modification associated to their presence / absence will not be clearly seen .",
    "lastly , it is interesting to observe that box filtering small scales modifies the stretching statistics to a great extent .",
    "a field filtered in such a way shows a finite probability of having more than twice the amount of stretching / tilting compared to the enstrophy @xcite . in the context of the large eddy simulation methodology , where this kind of filtering is commonly used , it is possible to deduce that ,",
    "when a fluctuating field shows such a feature , the field is unresolved .",
    "as a consequence , it is possible to build a criterion that locates the regions of the field where the inclusion of a subgrid term in the governing equations is advisable ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "to summerize , we have collected a set of statistical information about the stretching and tilting intensity of vortical structures normalized by the enstrophy , @xmath75 , in isotropic turbulence .",
    "a first result is that there is a very small probability of having a larger stretching / tilting of intensity than the double of the square of the vorticity magnitude .",
    "then , if compact structures ( blobs ) in the inertial range are filtered out , it can be seen that the probability of having higher @xmath11 than a given threshold @xmath25 increases by 20% at @xmath76 , and by 60 - 70% at @xmath77 . if , on the other hand , larger blobs are filtered , an opposite situation occurs .",
    "the unfiltered field is thus a separatrix for the cumulative probability function .",
    "this behavior - high fluctuation vorticity magnitude @xmath78 low stretching , and viceversa - agrees with general aspects highlighted by a number of laboratory and numerical analyses , @xcite also in near wall turbulent flow configurations@xcite .",
    "the present observations need to be associated to the non discriminating effect of filtering on filaments and sheets , which is due to their specific nature that can not be reconciled inside either a category of small or large scales .",
    "it has also been shown that a high intermittency is associated to @xmath11 , whose kurtosis is as high as 55 .",
    "the probability density function of the alignments between the strain rate eigenvectors and the vorticity is in part modified by the anisotropic filtering here investigated . in particular",
    ", we observe that , though the standard trend of alignments is not fully spoiled , eigenvector 2 reduces its alignment , while eigenvector 3 reduces its misalignment .",
    "conversely eigenvector 1 shows a different behaviour . in the band stop filtering case ( large scale dominate )",
    "eigenvector 1 slightly increases the alignment . in the high pass filtering case",
    "( inertial scales dominate ) , eigenvector 1 reduces the alignment that becomes statistically equal to that of the eigenvector 3 .",
    "this is confirmed by considering the mutual ratio among the averaged strain rate eigenvalues and related components of the enstrophy production .",
    "both filters increase the gap between the most extensional eigenvalue @xmath2 and the intermediate one @xmath3 and the gap between this last @xmath3 and the contractile eigenvalue @xmath79 .",
    "however , when the large scales are missing , the modulus of eigenvalues 1 and 3 become nearly equal , similar to the modulus of the related components of the enstrophy production .",

    "<S> it can be observed that , in the unfiltered isotropic field , the probability of the ratio ( @xmath1 ) being higher than a given threshold is higher than in the fields where the large scales were filtered out . at the same time , it is lower than in the fields were the small inertial and dissipation range of scales is filtered out . </S>",
    "<S> this is basically due to the suppression of compact structures in the ranges that have been filtered in different ways . </S>",
    "<S> the partial removal of the background of filaments and sheets does not have a first order effect on these statistics . </S>",
    "<S> these results are discussed in the light of a hypothesized relation between vortical filaments , sheets and blobs in physical space and in fourier space . </S>",
    "<S> the study in fact can be viewed as a kind of test for this idea and tries to highlight its limits . </S>",
    "<S> we conclude that a qualitative relation in physical space and in fourier space can be supposed to exist for blobs only . </S>",
    "<S> that is for the near isotropic structures which are sufficiently described by a single spatial scale and do not suffer from the disambiguation problem as filaments and sheets do .    </S>",
    "<S> information is also given on the filtering effect on statistics concerning the inclination of the strain rate tensor eigenvectors with respect to vorticity . </S>",
    "<S> in all filtered ranges , eigenvector 2 reduces its alignment , while eigenvector 3 reduces its misalignment . </S>",
    "<S> all filters increase the gap between the most extensional eigenvalue @xmath2 and the intermediate one @xmath3 and the gap between this last @xmath3 and the contractile eigenvalue @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> when the large scales are missing , eigenvalue modulus 1 and 3 become nearly equal , similar to the modulus of the related components of the enstrophy production . </S>"
