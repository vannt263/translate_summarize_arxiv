    "it is evident that this picture is not smoothly connected to the above two dig pictures where only one of the scattering potential is strong .",
    "therefore we expect that there are two domains in the rg flow diagram in terms of the original scattering potential @xmath241 and @xmath239 . @xmath251 and @xmath258 are the atractive fixed points in the domain ( a ) and ( b ) of fig .",
    "1 , respectively .",
    "in the latter half of the preceding section , we consider the limit of strong scattering potential in terms of duality mapping .",
    "there it was revealed that the tunneling amplitude through the potential is irrelevant in most of the cases",
    ". then it would be more appropriate to start with the picture where the bulk fqh state is divided into left and right condensates and electrons tunnel between the left and right edges through a insulating region at the point contact .",
    "first we study the electron tunneling ( et ) picture for @xmath91 . as was pointed out",

    "these subjects will be discussed toward the end of this section .      at a point contact ,",
    "two channels are close to each other within the magnetic length , the single - channel electron operator @xmath259 on the left ( right ) branch is no longer the most general one .",

    "the electron tunneling through a point contact can be described using the concept of tunneling hamiltonian  @xcite @xmath265 where field operators on the left and right edges anticommute , which in the present picture corresponds to the fact that two edges are those of independent incompressible fluids .",
    "we consider a nonequilibrium situation where the chemical potentials on each of the edges are different by the applied voltage : @xmath266 .",
    "the tunneling current @xmath267 from the left to right edge is given by the average value of the operator @xmath268 where @xmath269 is the number of particles on the left edge .",

    "we obtain @xmath304 where @xmath305 as @xmath306 . we confirm that @xmath251 is a stable fixed point .",

    "it is confirmed that the point @xmath296 is another stable fixed point . in this case",
    "the scaling dimensions of the tunneling amplitudes are precisely equal to those of the instanton fugacities in the dig picture .",
    "hence we predict no crossover between the two pictures .",
    "the whole @xmath252-plane is divided into two domains separated by a boundary ( the dotted line in fig.1 ) , each of which has the attractive fixed point @xmath251 and @xmath296 , respectively .",

    "\\(c ) for the ( 1 , @xmath1151/3 ) state the phase diagram is divided into two domains giving different temperature dependence of the conductance .",
    "finally we explicitly write down our prediction for the temperature dependence of the tunneling conductance through a point contact in the presence of interactions .",
    "first we consider the case where @xmath91 ( i ) . in the case of",
    "@xmath293 we can read @xmath317=-4/5 $ ] , @xmath318 and @xmath319 from the tables of exponents . hence @xmath320 similarly we obtain for the ( 1/3,1/15 ) state @xmath321 and for the ( 1/3 , 1/3 ) state @xmath322 next we consider the ( 1 , @xmath1151/3 ) state which belongs to case ( ii ) : @xmath109 . as was pointed out in the last section , our prediction is different for that state .",
    "there is an ambiguity with the quantized value of the hall conductance at `` high '' temperature when two channels propagate in the opposite directions . in this case a generalized landauer formula  @xcite gives different quantized values for the two - terminal conductance @xmath323 and the four - terminal hall conductance @xmath324 , which are both different from @xmath325  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath326 they are calculated respectively as  @xcite @xmath327 however we take the viewpoint that landauer formula is no longer valid in this case and the conductance is quantized : @xmath328 , which is experimentally observed .    as was studied in secs .",
    "iii and iv the rg flow diagram in the ( @xmath329)-plane has two stable fixed points , which means that there are two different behaviors of the conductance depending on the initial value of @xmath330 .",
    "first we study the domain ( a ) of fig . 1 where @xmath331 .",
    "if the initial value of @xmath241 is not so large only the quasihole @xmath332 channel becomes reflected by the scattering potential as the temperature is lowered .",
    "the other ( @xmath333 integral quantum hall ) edge is robust against backward scatterings even at zero temperature . at zero temperature",
    "the conductance is again quantized . to obtain the quantized value , landauer formula for the two - terminal  @xcite and four - terminal conductance",
    "was applied  @xcite .",
    "similarly the two - terminal conductance can also be calculated  @xcite .",
    "both @xmath323 and @xmath324 give the same value @xmath334 as @xmath335 , which is identified with @xmath336 . at low temperature",
    "only @xmath233 is relevant for the electron tunneling . in this case",
    "the landauer formula is valid since the single - channel model is free from the complications on the equilibration between the channels  @xcite .",
    "the tunneling conductance behaves as @xmath337 where @xmath57 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 .",
    "the signs of the temperature dependent terms reflect the fact that the @xmath338 edge is that of a quasihole droplet .",
    "we predict the existence of crossover among the three pictures .",
    "next we study the domain ( b ) of fig . 1 where @xmath339 . if the initial value of @xmath241 is sufficiently large both @xmath241 and @xmath239 scale to infinity . in this case",
    "the scaling dimension of the instanton fugacity @xmath245 in the dig picture and that of the electron tunneling amplitude @xmath340 are identical , i.e. bith give @xmath341 .",
    "the tunneling conductance behaves at low temperature as @xmath342 where @xmath343 is a positive exponent if @xmath344 is finite but goes to zero as @xmath306 .",
    "we expect that the exponent is small and there is no crossover between the et and the dig picture . in this case",
    "we also predict that even at `` high '' temperature the tunneling conductance is not quantized since this domain is not smoothly connected to the origin in the @xmath252-plane .",
    "in summary we have shown that the structure of the hierarchical edge modes gives a variety of behaviors of the conductance through a point contact .",
