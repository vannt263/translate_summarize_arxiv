    "various theoretical extensions of the standard model predict the existence of new heavy particles which decay into @xmath0 pairs with large branching fraction .",
    "such scenarios include excited neutral gauge bosons @xmath2 with standard - model type couplings or randall - sundrum kk gluons  @xcite .",
    "if these new particles are much heavier than the top quark and their masses reach the tev range , then the top quark daughters are highly boosted .",
    "the jets associated with the boosted top quark decays may be collimated into a single jet . in such case ,",
    "standard methods for identifying top quarks may fail or be severely impaired .",
    "for instance , b - tagging techniques based on identification of tracks or vertexes displaced with respect to the primary interaction vertex would suffer due to the dense track environment characteristic to very high energy , collimated jets .",
    "lower tagging efficiency and higher mistag rates are expected  @xcite .",
    "difficulties in identifying leptons inside boosted jets would diminish the performance of lepton based taggers .",
    "it is therefore very important to develop reconstruction algorithms that distinguish boosted top jets from jets produced in generic qcd events .",
    "we describe an algorithm which attempts to identify boosted top quark jets in which the @xmath3 top daughter decays hadronically .",
    "the fraction of such fully hadronic top decays is 68% .",
    "the idea for tagging boosted top quarks decaying hadronically is to identify jet substructure in top quark jets and to use this substructure to impose kinematic cuts that discriminate against non - top jets .",
    "if a top quark decays fully hadronically @xmath4 with @xmath5 and the jets from the top quark daughters are collimated into a single top jet , one can try to determine the top jet sub - structure by decomposing the top jet into sub - jets corresponding to the top daughters @xmath6 and @xmath7 .",
    "once the top jet is decomposed one can attempt to discriminate top jets from qcd jets using jet sub - structure information .",
    "to construct boosted top jets , the cambridge - aachen ( ca ) algorithm  @xcite is used .",
    "these final ca jets are referred to as hard jets .",
    "the method developed in reference  @xcite is implemented to discern the jet sub - structure .",
    "this approach uses the ca jet algorithm to reconstruct highly boosted top jets and decompose them into sub - jets .",
    "this decomposition is done by examining the cluster sequence of the final jets in the ca algorithm to find intermediate sub - jets from the algorithm , and attempting to identify the jets from the top and @xmath3 decays .",
    "the ca algorithm is a @xmath8-like algorithm .",
    "these algorithms examine four - vector inputs pairwise and construct jets hierarchically .",
    "to do so , they construct the quantities  @xcite :    @xmath9    where @xmath10 is the transverse momentum of the @xmath11-th particle with respect to the beam axis , @xmath12 is the distance between particles @xmath11 and @xmath13 in @xmath14 space ( where @xmath15 is rapidity , and @xmath16 is the azimuthal angle ) , and @xmath17 is a distance parameter taken of order unity . for the @xmath8 algorithm , @xmath18 . for the anti-@xmath8 algorithm , @xmath19 . for the ca algorithm , @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "the quantity @xmath22 is referred to as the beam distance .",
    "the algorithm then finds the minimum @xmath23 of all the @xmath24 and @xmath22 .",
    "if @xmath23 is a @xmath24 , the two particles are merged ( by default , via a four - vector summation ) .",
    "if it is a @xmath22 , then the particle @xmath11 is a final jet , and is removed from the list .",
    "this process is repeated until there are no particles left . in the case of a ca algorithm with @xmath25 ,",
    "the merging condition ( @xmath26 ) reduces to @xmath27 .",
    "the final hard jets are required to have transverse momentum above 250 gev / c and rapidity within the @xmath28 range .",
    "the sub - jets are selected if the sub - jet transverse momentum is larger than 0.05 the hard jet transverse momentum , @xmath29(sub - jet)@xmath30(hard_jet ) .",
    "the top tagging algorithm is applied if at least three sub - jets are found .",
    "the variables that are used to discriminate top jets from generic qcd jets are : the number of sub - jets identified inside the hard jet , the hard jet mass ( as proxy to the top mass ) and the minimum di - jet mass pair among the three leading sub - jets ( as proxy to w mass ) .",
    "figure  [ n_subjets ] shows the distribution of the number of sub - jets in collimated top jets from a 2  tev / c@xmath31 mass @xmath32 resonance compared to the corresponding distribution of generic qcd jets .",
    "the qcd jets are selected so that their transverse momenta are in the same range as the typical transverse momenta of the top quarks from the @xmath32 resonance . a requirement that the hard jet contains at least three sub - jets",
    "is applied as it rejects a significant fraction of qcd background jets and retains most of the top jet signal events .",
    "decays @xmath33 ( black , solid line ) versus non - top jets from generic qcd ( red , dashed line ) .",
    "the samples are chosen such that the reconstructed top and qcd jets have approximately the same transverse momenta .",
    ", width=302 ]    the use of the jet mass as discriminating variable between top and qcd jets is justified because , in the case of true top jets , the jet mass tends toward the top mass , while for generic qcd non - top jets , the jet mass does not reconstruct to the top mass but instead approximately scales by the jet transverse momentum over a constant of order 10 .",
    "figure  [ jet_mass ] shows the distributions of the hard jet mass for top jets from a 2  tev / c@xmath34 @xmath32 resonance and the corresponding distribution for qcd jets with transverse momenta similar to the top jets .",

    "the minimum pairwise mass of the sub - jets often reconstructs in the vicinity of the @xmath3 mass .",
    "figure  [ gen_min_mass ] shows the true minimum mass pairing of the three partons from the @xmath35 decay where the top quarks come from the @xmath36 sample .",
    "it is most often the case that the minimum mass pairing of the true partons results in the @xmath3 mass , which means that the @xmath37 quark is most often the hardest parton in the event . despite the fact that the lowest mass pairing of the sub - jets is not always the @xmath3 mass after hadronization and reconstruction , the minimum mass pairing selection criterion is nonetheless exploited .",
    "the minimum mass pairing provides good discrimination against non - top jets , where there is no on - shell @xmath3 and instead the minimum mass pairing of the sub - jets reconstructs to a low - mass falling spectrum .",

    "only the low mass peak at @xmath38  gev / c is observed .",

    "the minimum pairwise mass is required to be above 50 gev / c@xmath34 .",
    "this minimum di - jet mass requirement is chosen to optimize @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the number of top jets and @xmath42 is the number of background qcd events .",
    "to estimate the efficiency of the boosted top tagging algorithm several simulated samples of randall - sundrum gluons decaying to @xmath0 , with masses in the range 750 - 3000 gev / c@xmath34 were examined . the efficiency defined as the number of matched top - jets that are identified by the algorithm divided by the total number of matched top - jets",
    "is measured on these samples as function of jet transverse momentum . the efficiency as function of the top jet transverse momentum",
    "is shown in figure  [ fig : efficiency ] .",
    "the efficiency reaches a plateau value of @xmath43 for jet transverse momenta above @xmath44  gev / c .",
    "below 600 - 700 gev / c the efficiency is lower and drops to zero below 300 gev / c .",
    "this behavior is explained by the fact that this algorithm requires the daughters of the boosted top quark to be merged into a single jet .",
    "merging is enhanced as the top quark momentum increases . for low transverse momenta",
    "the top quark daughters produce separate jets . as their transverse momenta increase from @xmath45  gev / c to @xmath44  gev /",
    "c the top jets become more and more collimated , approaching full merging above @xmath44  gev / c .",
    "there are several theoretical systematic effects that can affect the estimate of the top tagging efficiency by changing the profile of the sub - jets :    * initial and final state radiation * renormalization scale * fragmentation    the issue is that considering a reasonable variation on these parameters is not yet understood",
    ". variations are taken relying on experience from lower energy colliders extended with theoretical arguments .",
    "a total theoretical uncertainty of 3.8% is found .",
    "this estimate should be taken only as indicative of the theoretical uncertainty , while a more careful study must be determined in the future to ascertain a more accurate estimate , when there is sufficient data to estimate these effects .      in order to account for the detector - based systematic uncertainties ,",
    "the resolution of the sub - jets within the hard jets was derived from simulation of @xmath46 events with masses of 1000 and 3000 gev/@xmath47 .",
    "the partons from the @xmath48 decay ( i.e. the @xmath37 , @xmath49 , and @xmath7 ) were matched to the closest reconstructed sub - jet .",
    "the response of the simulated calorimeter was then parameterized with sub - jet transverse momentum .",
    "this was done for the resolution of the transverse momentum , rapidity , and azimuthal angle .",
    "it was observed that the resolutions could be estimated as @xmath50    the resolutions were hypothesized to be 10% and 50% worse than the simulation for the momentum and angular resolution , respectively .",
    "an additional 5.3% systematic uncertainty due to assumed worse resolution was assigned to the efficiency .",
    "figure  [ fig : efficiency ] shows the efficiency with simulation statistical uncertainties , as well as the total 6.5% systematic uncertainty from combining the theoretical ( 3.8% ) and detector - based ( 5.3% ) systematic uncertainties .",
    "table  [ tab : eff_systematics ] summarizes the systematic uncertainties .",
    ".[tab : eff_systematics ] effects of variation of several systematic uncertainties on the estimated efficiency from simulation . [ cols=\"<,^\",options=\"header \" , ]      the shape of the efficiency curve has been studied , and the primary factor has been determined to be the r - parameter in the ca algorithm . as the width of the jet is increased , the lower transverse momentum top jets have more products merged . however , at some point at higher transverse momentum values , the only quantities that are subsumed by a larger distance parameter are radiative jets , which manifests in a decreasing efficiency because the minimum mass combination of the sub - jets tends to bias away from the @xmath3 mass when there is radiation present .",
    "figure  [ fig : eff_catoptag_widecone ] shows the efficiency turn - on for a distance parameter of 1.5 ( up from the default 0.8 ) .",
    "the faster turn - on at the low transverse momentum end is readily apparent , as is the faster turn - off at the high transverse momentum end .",
    "non - top decays may pass the selection defined in the previous section and thus fake a boosted top tag . in order to derive a parameterization of the fake tag rate ,",
    "a data - driven method is proposed that makes use of a high statistics sample , and uses an `` anti - tag and probe '' method .",
    "this method is expected to provide over a thousand fake tags for a data sample of 100  pb@xmath51 , allowing for a robust data driven determination of the fake background .",
    "the following selection is made to select fake tags :    * two jets are required to have @xmath52 250 gev / c , and @xmath53 .",
    "* events are required to have one jet `` anti - tagged '' . to `` anti - tag '' , jets are selected that have two sub - jets or less , or to have more than two sub - jets , with jet mass and jet minimum mass outside the signal window . * the other jets in the sample are referred to as the `` probe '' jets .",
    "the contamination from continuum @xmath0 production is subtracted based on an estimate from simulation , and the amount of that subtraction is taken as a systematic uncertainty .",
    "this `` probe jet '' selection constitutes an almost entirely signal - depleted sample . *",
    "the tag rates are then parameterized with respect to the jet @xmath54 using these `` probe jets '' .",
    "the prediction from the simulation is taken as the central value and scaled to 100 pb@xmath51 , assuming poisson statistics and taking a binomial uncertainty .",
    "figure  [ fig : mistag_param_lum ] shows the fake tag parameterization as function of transverse momentum for a 100 pb@xmath51 data sample .",
    "these plots should be taken as a proxy for the real data .",
    "the results are fully data - driven in the real analysis with data , with the sole exception of the correction for the @xmath0 contamination . even for a sample as low as 100 pb@xmath51 ,",
