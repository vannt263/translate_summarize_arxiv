    "these observations suggest that the quasiparticle excitations observed in the undoped cuprates are quite different from conventional fermi liquid quasiparticles .    in order to understand arpes experiments in the undoped compounds ,",
    "first we need to figure out the elementary excitation whose excitation spectrum obeys the dispersion observed experimentally .",
    "the next step is to consider a mechanism of spectral shape broadening that would arise from coupling to a boson mode . concerning the first point , it was shown that the slave - fermion approach to the t - t-t-j model reproduces the dispersion .",
    "@xcite ( it is known that the simple t - j model fails to reproduce the dispersion along @xmath10 to @xmath11.@xcite ) however , it has been shown@xcite that the coupling to antiferromagnetic spin - wave modes does not lead to a broad line shape .",
    "recently mischenko and nagaosa@xcite considered a coupling to an optical phonon .",

    "we show that the coupling to the longitudinal gauge field leads to the localization of the dirac fermions and the spectral function is approximately given by a gaussian form .",
    "the main assumption here is that a doped hole excite a quasiparticle in the @xmath12-flux state .",
    "one way to interpret this is to consider the slave - boson approach to the t - j model .",
