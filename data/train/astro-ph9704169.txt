    "velocity fields within protogalaxies carry important clues about the process of galaxy formation .",
    "the kinematic history of the protogalactic gas is of particular importance as it is a sensitive discriminator between competing theories of galaxy formation . in standard hierarchical models ,",
    "low - mass subunits of dark matter and gas continuously merge to form the high - mass galaxies seen today @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the rotation speeds of galaxy disks at high redshifts ( @xmath8 ) are low compared to the rotation speeds of current massive spirals @xcite .",
    "by contrast , higher rotation speeds are predicted at large redshifts by models in which disks form from the coherent collapse of gas in massive dark - matter halos @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to test these ideas _ directly _ with data that accurately measure the motions of protogalactic gas . specifically , we present an analysis of high - resolution spectra of metal absorption lines from a sample of damped systems .",
    "the latter are high - redshift layers of neutral gas widely thought to be the progenitors of current galaxies @xcite .",
    "we use the hires echelle spectrograph @xcite on the keck 10 m telescope to detect the gas in absorption against the light of more distant qsos .",
    "the velocity profiles of the damped systems are notable for the following properties : ( 1 ) they comprise multiple narrow components ; ( 2 ) they are asymmetric in that the component with strongest absorption tends to be at one edge of the profile ; and ( 3 ) the velocity intervals over which absorption occurs , @xmath9 , are uniformly distributed between @xmath10 20 and 200 . by constructing statistical measures characterizing the velocity structure of the absorption profiles , we demonstrate that the asymmetry rules out models dominated by random motions or by spherically symmetric radial motions . rather , we show the asymmetry can be caused by the rotation of `` cold '' gaseous disks with significant vertical scale heights .",
    "furthermore , the distribution of velocity intervals implies high rotation speeds , @xmath5 @xmath10 225 .",
    "two types of models have been proposed to explain the damped systems .",
    "the hierarchical schemes assume the damped systems to be slowly rotating disks embedded in low - mass protogalaxies @xcite .",
    "other models , that do not assume a particular cosmological context , propose the damped systems to be rapidly rotating disks in high - mass protogalaxies @xcite , protospheroidal gas @xcite , dwarf galaxies , @xcite , or gas falling into protogalaxies @xcite .",
    "we compare all the model predictions with the data using monte carlo techniques .",
    "the models are constructed by inserting gas into discrete velocity components according to algorithms described below .",
    "we randomly select the locations and velocities of components along the line of sight from parent distributions appropriate for the scenario being tested .",
    "synthetic spectra are generated by computing the absorption profiles for optically thin transitions arising in low ions such as si@xmath11 , because the latter accurately traces the velocity structure of the neutral gas .",
    "we generate an ensemble of velocity profiles by assuming the model protogalaxies are randomly oriented in projection on the sky .",
    "we then compare the computed and observed distributions of statistical measures that are sensitive to the degree of asymmetry and width of the absorption profiles .",
    "as demonstrated below , the asymmetry in the velocity profiles rules out `` hot '' models in which @xmath6 @xmath12 @xmath5 at high confidence levels , where @xmath6 is the component - component velocity dispersion .",
    "this is why models with significant random motions are unlikely .",
    "we then focus on `` cold '' rotating disks in which @xmath6 @xmath13 @xmath5 and compare the model distribution of @xmath9 with the observed distribution .",
    "this particular test is crucial for evaluating model disks with different rotation speeds and is the test that rules out models with low @xmath5 .",

    "rotating disks have figured prominently in damped research . the original survey for damped lines",
    "was initiated in order to find rotating galactic disks at high redshifts @xcite . since then , much of the modeling has incorporated rotating disks as a working hypothesis ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the first attempt to infer the velocity field of the gas from the data was made by briggs ( 1985 ) who argued the red - blue asymmetry detected in the metal lines of a @xmath63 @xmath3 1 damped absorber could arise from passage of the line of sight through a rotating disk .",
    "working with higher resolution data lanzetta & bowen ( 1992 ) presented formulae for velocity profiles arising from highly inclined sightlines through a rotating spheroid , that mimic sightlines through a thin rotating disk , in order to model the asymmetries they found in three damped systems with @xmath63 @xmath3 1 .",
    "using even more accurate hires spectra wolfe ( 1995 ) noticed similar asymmetries in the metal - line profiles of five damped systems with @xmath63 @xmath7 1.7 .",
    "wolfe ( 1995 ) assumed the velocity profiles arose in rotating disks of gas in which the gas distribution decreases exponentially both with radius and vertical distance from the plane .",
    "a monte carlo approach to this problem was outlined , and a preliminary description of the present work was given in wolfe ( 1996 ) .    in @xmath64",
    "the techniques described in this section will be applied to : ( 1 ) rapidly rotating `` cold '' disks of massive galaxies ; ( 2 ) slowly rotating `` hot '' disks of dwarf galaxies ; and ( 3 ) rotating disk progenitors of ordinary spirals predicted by the cdm cosmology .      assume the velocity profiles in damped systems are explained by passage of the line of sight through a centrifugally supported disk in which the volume density of neutral gas is given by    @xmath65    where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are cylindrical radius and vertical displacement from midplane , @xmath68 is the central gas density , @xmath4 is the radial scale length , and @xmath2 is the vertical scale height .",
    "the column density of gas perpendicular to the disk is thus    @xmath69    where the central perpendicular column density ,    @xmath70    because the velocity profiles in figure  [ sptra ] indicate the density field comprises a discrete rather than continuous distribution of gas in velocity space , @xmath71 is proportional to the number of discrete clouds ( i.e. , velocity components ) per unit volume , if , as we assume , the column density per cloud remains constant .",
    "further suppose the gas rotates with a flat rotation curve given by    @xmath72    where @xmath73 is the azimuthal component of the velocity .",
    "although equation  [ vroteq ] breaks down at values of @xmath67 where the @xmath74 component of the gravitational force differs significantly from its value at @xmath67 = 0 , we shall assume this equality is valid at all @xmath67 , and re - examine this assumption in @xmath14 9 .",
    "in addition , let the clouds exhibit isotropic random motions characterized by a one - dimensional velocity dispersion , @xmath6 .",
    "the profile asymmetry is the product of two effects .",
    "the `` radial effect '' stems from the @xmath66 dependence of @xmath71 _ along the line of sight_. this produces a cloud distribution symmetric about the peak located where @xmath66 equals the impact parameter , @xmath75 , i.e. , where the sightline crosses the major axis of the inclined disk ( see figure  [ mlos ] where the major axis is denoted by the horizontal dash - dot line and the line of sight by the vertical dashed line ) . in this case",
    "the strongest absorption occurs at the smallest value of @xmath66 where the magnitude of the rotational velocity projected along the line of sight is largest ; i.e. , the `` tangent point '' used in 21 cm investigations of the galactic rotation curve @xcite .",
    "as @xmath66 increases , the absorption gets weaker and the magnitude of the projected rotational velocity decreases , thereby producing a velocity profile with strong absorption at one side of the profile and progressively weaker absorption toward the other .",
    "the `` perpendicular effect '' stems from the @xmath67 dependence of @xmath71 along the line of sight . if the line of sight intersects midplane , @xmath67 = 0 , more than a few scale heights from the major axis",
    ", the cloud distribution will peak at the intersection point rather than the major axis , because @xmath2 @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "the resultant cloud distribution along the line of sight is lopsided with more clouds expected toward than away from the major axis , owing to the `` radial effect '' .",
    "the asymmetry of this profile is the reverse of the previous profile , because the absorption is strongest where the magnitude of @xmath5 projected along the line of sight is smallest and weakens as the magnitude of this velocity component increases toward the major axis .",
    "figure  [ mlos ] shows examples of velocity profiles arising from these effects .",
    "the profiles designated 1 and 2 are caused by sightlines intersecting midplane at locations 1 and 2 .",
    "the profiles are produced by absorption in discrete clouds and are computed according to the prescription given in the next subsection .",
    "the asymmetry of profile 2 is dominated by the radial effect because the midplane intersection is so close to the major axis .",
    "profile 1 exhibits the reverse asymmetry because the midplane intersection is so far from the major axis .",
    "figure  [ mlos ] also shows how the velocity profiles are affected by changes in @xmath75 .",

    "we design test statistics to discriminate among these models .",
    "in particular , the tests focus on the width of the features in velocity space ( the velocity interval ) , the location of the peak component within the velocity interval , and the degree of asymmetry evident in the profiles .",

    "this definition removes outlying weak components that may be statistical fluctuations that are not good tracers of the underlying velocity field . while the routine may underestimate the true velocity interval , this is preferable to including misleading statistical artifacts .",

    "the mean@xmath17median test gauges asymmetry by measuring the relative difference between the mean and median velocities of the optical depth profile .",
    "the test first establishes the velocity interval as discussed above .",
    "the mean velocity is defined as the velocity of the midpoint of the interval where the edge corresponding to the smallest velocity is normalized to @xmath32 ( i.e. @xmath145 ) .",
    "the routine calculates @xmath142 within the velocity interval , and then determines the median velocity , @xmath146 , as the velocity dividing @xmath142 in half .",

    "the test is both physically motivated and relatively simple . note that because the velocity interval routine removes @xmath143 of @xmath142 symmetrically , it does not affect the mean@xmath17median test .",

    "furthermore , while the model predicts a peak in the @xmath150 distribution near @xmath150 @xmath10 0.75 , the empirical distribution is more uniform between 0 and 1.0 .",
    "thus the profiles predicted by the spherical infall model are actually too `` edge - leading '' , and as a result @xmath225 .",
    "note , in order to reproduce the observed @xmath9 distribution we developed _",
    "ad hoc _ distributions of @xmath223 .",
    "the combined weight of the tests rule out this model at very high confidence levels .",
    "the random motion model assumes a uniform deviate yielding less symmetric , more edge - leading profiles than those models with a gaussian deviate .",
    "owing to the uniform deviate , the strongest peak is distributed uniformly within the velocity interval . as a result",
    "the model yields acceptable values of @xmath187 for a wide range of cloud numbers .",
    "however , the profiles are still too symmetric for consistency with the mean - median test for all but the smallest values of @xmath98 .",
    "and the model fails the two - peak test and , the velocity interval test for all values of @xmath98 .",
    "therefore , this model is highly unlikely to represent the data . as in our treatment of the dwarf galaxies , we also considered a model ( not plotted in figure  [ fail ] ) in which @xmath109 is drawn uniformly from a distribution designed to give an acceptable distribution of @xmath9 .",
    "although this model yields @xmath226 , it is ruled out at high confidence levels by both the mean@xmath17median and two@xmath17peak tests .",
    "apart from rapidly rotating `` cold '' disks and slowly rotating `` hot '' disks , every model we tested is ruled out at higher than 99.9 @xmath0 confidence by one or more of the tests . because the `` hot disks '' , i.e. , the turbulent dwarf galaxies , are ruled out at @xmath227 confidence , the only considered models compatible with the kinematic data are those with rapidly rotating `` cold '' disks . in order to place more rigorous bounds on parameters such as rotation speed and disk thickness",

    "the maximal points are indicated by the @xmath26 s on the right side of figure  [ rsltfig ] .",

    "therefore , it is possible that the contours with this @xmath88 will encompass an even smaller area in this parameter space .    the likelihood ratio test results in several significant trends .",
    "first , a lower limit of @xmath252 is established at the @xmath253 confidence level , independent of @xmath78 and @xmath81 .",
    "upper limits on @xmath5 are less restrictive , especially for smaller values of @xmath108 and larger @xmath88 . in fact there is a portion of parameter space allowing @xmath254 at the 95@xmath0 confidence level for all 3 values of @xmath88 . but in every case the optimal rotation speed is given by @xmath255 225 . also note that the @xmath256 and 99@xmath0 contours have larger areas when @xmath257 , a trend caused by the `` column - density kinematic '' effect discussed in @xmath258 .",
    "this is further illustrated in figure  [ vnhih3 ] which is an iso - probability contour plot of @xmath5 vs. @xmath88 for @xmath81 = 0.3 .",
    "the gradual rise of @xmath5 with increasing @xmath88 indicates larger rotation speeds are required to compensate for the narrower profiles produced when @xmath88 is large .",
    "second , the optimal @xmath108 value is at 0.32 . while we find a lower limit of @xmath81 @xmath7 0.1 at the 99@xmath0 confidence level , the test places no upper limit on @xmath81",
    "this is because the gradient of @xmath5 along the line of sight increases with @xmath81 until it remains nearly constant at @xmath81 @xmath25 0.4 .",
    "finally , we consider the robustness of our results , in particular the optimal rotation speed , @xmath259 , found from maximum likelihood techniques .",
    "first , we believe the rotation speed must be large simply because there is no evidence that the @xmath109 with the largest values are spurious outliers .",
    "rather , the distribution out to large @xmath109 contains a tail which is real ; for example , 6 of the 17 profiles have @xmath260 .",
    "however , our single population model with @xmath5 the same for all disks is naive in that it can not explain the detection of a single system with @xmath261 . in a more realistic multi - population model",
    ", @xmath5 would be distributed out to 350 in order to explain the largest rotation speeds measured for current sa spirals @xcite . such a model",
    "could then explain @xmath262 .",
    "higher values would then have to be interpreted in terms of multiple disks or some other mechanism .",
    "vs @xmath109 .",
    "clear squares represent the data .",
    "dots represent simulation results for three runs with @xmath263 , and @xmath264 ( a ) @xmath229 , ( b ) @xmath230 , and ( c ) @xmath231.,width=288,height=384 ]    while the statistical tests show the general features of the `` cold '' disk models are consistent with observation , the assumption of identical @xmath78 may be incorrect .",
    "figure  [ dat2d ] is a plot of observed @xmath24(h i ) vs @xmath9 for @xmath78 = ( a ) @xmath229 , ( b ) @xmath230 , and ( c ) @xmath231 .",
    "although the data exhibit a possible anti - correlation between @xmath24(h i ) and @xmath9 , all three models predict a positive correlation between these quantities .",
    "the correlation arises because low @xmath9 are generally produced at large impact parameters where @xmath24(h i ) is small and large @xmath9 are produced at small impact parameters where @xmath24(h i ) is large .",
    "better agreement with the data could be achieved by dropping the unrealistic assumption of identical @xmath88 .",
    "thus some contribution from disks with @xmath88 = 10@xmath111 @xmath28 would help to explain data points with @xmath24(h i ) @xmath7 10@xmath265 @xmath28 , while disks with @xmath88 = 10@xmath110 @xmath28 help to explain the distribution of data points at @xmath24(h i ) @xmath3 10@xmath110 @xmath28 . but even this scheme produces too many disks with @xmath9 @xmath3 60 and @xmath24(h i ) @xmath3 10@xmath110 @xmath28 .",
    "these might be eliminated by invoking photoionization of the outer disks where the gas density is low and ionization parameter high .",
    "we are currently experimenting with these and other schemes in order to obtain a better match with the data .",
    "recently emission , at @xmath63 = 3.15 , was detected from an object displaced by 2.3 arcsec from a sightline intersecting a damped system with a similar redshift ( djorgovski 1996 ) .",
    "this suggests a test of the rotating disk hypothesis .",
    "let the emission come from the center of the gaseous disk causing absorption .",
    "the geometry of such a configuration is illustrated in figure  [ hstfig ] .",
    "the circle represents a disk rotating with @xmath5 in the counterclockwise direction as indicated by the velocity vectors .",
    "two possible sightline geometries are indicated by the vertical dashed lines that run from the observer at the bottom to the qso at the top of the figure .",
    "the kinematic major axis of the disk is the dash - dot - dash line .",
    "the dots at positions 1@xmath174 show four locations where the sightlines encounter the disk midplane .",
    "the metal - line velocity profiles in the figure were computed according to the algorithms of @xmath14 3.2 which describes why `` edge - leading '' profiles arising from midplane encounters far from the major axis , as in positions 1 and 4 , exhibit asymmetries that mirror `` edge - leading '' profiles arising from midplane encounters near the major axis , as in positions 2 and 3 .",
    "the figure shows the emission redshift , @xmath36 = 0 , lies at or beyond the boundaries of the absorption profile in every case .",
    "furthermore , the component with peak optical depth should be at the profile boundary nearest to @xmath36 = 0 , when the point of midplane encounter is far from the major axis or farthest from @xmath36 = 0 , when the midplane encounter is nearer to the major axis .    as a result ,",
    "the disk model predicts a systematic relation between the kinematics of emission and absorption lines .",
    "by contrast the peak component would be _ randomly _ distributed with respect to @xmath36 = 0 , were damped absorption to arise in undetected satellite galaxies bound to massive primary galaxies detected in emission .",
    "suppose the speed of the satellite with respect to the primary is given by @xmath266 , and the internal kinematics of the satellite generates a profile with velocity interval , @xmath109 .",
    "the probability that the emission redshift of the primary is within @xmath109 is then given by    @xmath267    therefore , when @xmath109 @xmath13 @xmath266 , the satellite - primary configurations are unlikely to produce emission redshifts within the absorption profile , and are thus indistinguishable from absorption by a single large disk .",
    "but when @xmath109 @xmath10 @xmath266 , the emission redshifts are likely to lie within @xmath109 . because @xmath266 @xmath7 100 @xcite , a significant fraction of absorption profiles with @xmath109 @xmath7 100 should contain the emission redshift , if the satellite / primary galaxy hypothesis is correct . clearly , the combination of emission and absorption kinematics provides powerful and independent tests of the rotating disk model .",
    "such a test was initiated by lu ( 1996b ) .",
    "they used hires to obtain low - ion profiles for the @xmath54 = 3.15 damped absorber toward q2233@xmath22131 , the same system djorgovski ( 1996 ) found to be associated with an emitting galaxy at the absorption redshift .",
    "comparison between emission and absorption profiles shows the centroid of the emission line is located outside the absorption profile characterized by @xmath109 = 200 .",
    "this is consistent with the kinematics of a large , rotating disk centered on the emitter .",
    "because the peak component is at the profile boundary farthest from @xmath36 = 0 , the point of midplane encounter should be near the major axis . lu etal ( 1996b )",
    "used their measurement of @xmath109 to set a lower limit of 200 on @xmath5 which was combined with the impact parameter , @xmath75 = 30@xmath268 kpc , to deduce a total mass for the galaxy of @xmath269 @xmath7 @xmath270 ( note this mass is somewhat higher than the @xcite estimate , since we assume @xmath271 = 0.1 rather than @xmath271 = 1.0 ) . on the other hand",
    "the combination of large values for @xmath75 and @xmath109 raises potential problems for the big disk interpretation , because the column - density velocity effect ( @xmath14 3.2 ) indicates small @xmath109 when @xmath272 is large .",
    "perhaps @xmath272 is small in this case because @xmath4 exceeds 10 kpc , as expected from the high incidence of damped systems along the line of sight .",
    "moreover a large inclination angle , @xmath41 @xmath7 80@xmath273 , would also increase @xmath109 .",
    ", lies at or beyond the boundaries of the absorption profile in every case and the strongest feature lies at one of the edges.,width=288,height=384 ]",
    "our principal result is the cdm scenario for the formation of galactic disks predicts rotation speeds at @xmath63 @xmath10 2.5 that are ruled out at high confidence levels by the neutral - gas kinematics in damped systems .",
    "specifically , the semi - analytic model of kauffmann ( 1996 ) predicts most precursors of current massive spirals to be disks embedded in dark - matter halos with masses less than @xmath10 10@xmath274@xmath204 and rotation speeds less than 100 .",
    "by contrast , the likelihood ratio test in @xmath14 8 requires minimum rotation speeds , @xmath5 @xmath7 180 , at the 99 @xmath0 confidence level .",
    "the most likely value , @xmath275 while estimates of the masses responsible for rotation are not generally available , the @xmath270 lower limit set for the galaxy at @xmath63 = 3.15 is an important constraint , because galaxies with such large masses rarely contain disks with significant gaseous cross sections at large redshifts in hierarchical scenarios @xcite .",
    "rather our impression is that disks embedded in low - mass halos causing low rotation speeds dominate the damped interception probabilities in most hierarchical models .",
    "we will check this impression by using our monte carlo techniques to test the predictions of other independent cdm models ( see the numerical models of @xcite ) and hot @xmath22 cdm models @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we will test the recent suggestion that damped absorption arises in multiple low - mass galaxies rather than in a single object @xcite .",
    "however , until such schemes are shown to be consistent with the kinematic data , we shall adopt the idea of large , rapidly rotating disks that formed prior to @xmath63 @xmath276 3 as a working hypothesis for the damped systems .",
    "we note the early formation of large disks in massive galaxies is a signature of the isocurvature models @xcite , and possibly hierarchical models where @xmath277 and @xmath278 .",
    "let us take a closer look at the rapidly rotating disk model .",
    "first , we assumed the rotation curve was flat for all radii .",
    "this is true in current spirals , owing to a coincidence at small radii of ( i ) the sum of the radial gravitational forces due to stellar disk and bulge , and ( ii ) the radial gravitational force due to the dark - matter halo @xcite .",
    "however , in damped systems the force due to the disk is small compared to the halo or bulge ( the evidence for bulges in damped systems stems from the recent detection of damped absorption , at the emission redshift , in the spectrum of a lyman - break bulge at @xmath63 = 2.7 @xcite ) , because the surface densities of the gaseous damped disks are low compared to the surface densities of stellar disks in current spirals .",
    "for example the central surface densities of disk - population stars in spirals like the galaxy are typically 500 to 1000 @xmath204pc@xmath279 , whereas the central surface densities of gas in damped systems are at least 10 times smaller ( see @xcite ) . as a result rotation curves in damped systems",
    "should behave as follows . in the absence of a bulge ,",
    "the rotation speed due to a spherical isothermal halo rises out to the core radius and remains flat at larger radii .",
    "the presence of a bulge in the damped system results in a steeper rise from @xmath66 = 0 because of the smaller core radius of the bulge . at larger",
    "radii the rotation speed will drop and then rise again at radii sufficiently large for the halo to dominate .",
    "sightlines penetrating these types of disks may produce @xmath109 smaller than predicted by our model .",
    "we are currently constructing self - consistent models including bulge , disk , and halo components .",
    "second , we assumed @xmath5 was independent of @xmath67 . in a self - consistent model",
    "the azimuthal velocity , @xmath280 , would decrease with increasing @xmath67 because the @xmath74 component of the radial force decreases with @xmath67 for spherically symmetric mass distributions .",
    "we carried out some preliminary tests of this effect by imposing a negative @xmath67 gradient on @xmath5 .",
    "specifically , we let @xmath5 vary linearly from 225 at @xmath67 = 0 to 150 at 1 kpc and found the gradient had only minor effects on the test statistics .",
    "third , we are investigating the limits ionizing radiation places on the sizes of the gaseous disks and its effect on the test statistics .",
    "having explored the gas we turn to the stars by speculating about possible stellar byproducts of the damped disks .",
    "the kinematic evidence points to disks that : ( 1 ) are rapidly rotating , @xmath5 @xmath10 225 ; ( 2 ) are `` cold '' , @xmath6 @xmath13 @xmath5 ; and ( iii ) may have large scale heights , since @xmath2 @xmath7 0.1@xmath281 .",
    "by contrast the abundance measurements bring to mind `` hot '' configurations in which @xmath6 @xmath112 @xmath5 .",
    "this is because the low metallicity , [ zn / h ] = @xmath171.2 @xcite or [ fe / h ] = @xmath17 1.5 @xcite , and the relative abundance patterns , suggesting gas enrichment only by type ii supernovae @xcite , are signatures of halo population ii stars .",
    "therefore the kinematic and chemical evidence are in conflict .",
    "the conflict might be resolved if star formation in damped disks results in a thick , metal - poor disk not unlike the thick stellar disk of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the latter is characterized by scale height @xmath2 @xmath10 1.5 kpc .",
    "the scale height is compatible with @xmath2 @xmath7 0.1@xmath4 inferred for the damped systems because @xmath4 for current spirals ranges between 3 and 6 kpc @xcite , and @xmath4 for high-@xmath63 damped systems must be more than twice these values to explain their incidence along the line of sight @xcite .",
    "however , it is not obvious that the assumed velocity dispersion , @xmath6 = 10 , can maintain matter , gas or stars , at scale heights as large as 1.5 kpc . at the solar neighborhood ,",
    "where the surface density @xmath282 = 70 @xmath204pc@xmath279 , stars with @xmath6 @xmath10 25 have a scale height @xmath2 = 0.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "because the disk models fail the velocity interval and two peak tests when @xmath6 @xmath7 25 , large physical scale heights could be a serious problem for the disk model .",
    "however , the average surface density for damped systems is only @xmath10 10@xmath204pc@xmath279 , and since @xmath6 @xmath106 @xmath283 for self - gravitating disks , @xmath2 @xmath276 1.5 kpc is in principal compatible with @xmath6 @xmath3 20 . on the other hand",
    ", the damped disks may be self - gravitating only at @xmath66 @xmath3 @xmath4 .",
    "this is because the vertical structure of the disk is controlled by dark matter in the halo rather than self gravity at @xmath66 @xmath7 @xmath4 for exponential disks with central surface densities low compared to that of the galaxy ( gunn 1982 ) . in the dark - matter limit @xmath2 @xmath10 @xmath6@xmath66/@xmath5 and @xmath6 @xmath10 10 . as a result thick disks with low velocity dispersions",
    "may be physically plausible at any radius .",
    "while we have not run simulations in which @xmath2 @xmath106 @xmath66 , we see no reason why `` flaring '' disks would dilute the asymmetries required to explain the line profiles .",
    "other parameters characterizing the thick stellar disk are the mass fraction , rotation speed , and metallicity .",
    "the mass fraction , @xmath284 @xmath10 0.1 .",
    "this could be explained by a 10 @xmath0 decrease of @xmath285 between @xmath63 = 3 and 1.5 , which is consistent with the observed variation of @xmath285 @xcite .",
    "the rotation speed is given by @xmath5 @xmath10 150 .",
    "although this is lower than the optimal rotation speed , @xmath5 = 225 , a vertical velocity gradient going from @xmath5 = 225 at midplane to 150 at @xmath67 @xmath10 @xmath2 would explain the kinematics and results in simulated test - statistics compatible with the data , as discussed above .",
    "the most difficult problem has to do with metallicity , because the average [ fe / h ] for the damped systems is between a factor of 4 and 10 below the mean metallicity of the thick disk , @xmath286[fe / h]@xmath287 = @xmath170.6 @xcite .",
    "however , the thick disk abundance data refer only to stars near the solar circle , whereas the relevant metallicity is an average over the entire thick disk , which is unknown . as a result [ fe / h ]",
    "averaged over thick stellar disks would range between @xmath171.2 and @xmath171.6 in this scenario .",
    "finally we can not rule out the possibility that a significant fraction of the neutral gas experiences negligible star formation between @xmath63 = 3 and 1.5 . in that case",
    "the descendents of damped systems would be extended metal - poor configurations of gas surrounding the visible parts of galaxies .",
    "the detection of low metallicity damped systems at low redshifts , @xmath63 @xmath3 1 , provides evidence for such gas @xcite . in this case the agreement between the comoving density of neutral gas at @xmath63 @xmath10 3 and the density of visible matter in current galaxies would refer to the inner disks where star formation occurs , presumably at @xmath63 @xmath3 1.5 .",
