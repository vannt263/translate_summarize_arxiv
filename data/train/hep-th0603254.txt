    "according  to brane - world models our observable universe is a 4-dimensional ( 4d ) hypersurface ( the brane ) with tension @xmath0 , embedded into a 5-dimensional ( 5d ) curved space - time ( the bulk ) .",
    "standard model fields act on the brane , however gravitation spreads out into all five dimensions and it evolves according to the 5d einstein equation . while in the original randall - sundrum ( rs ) second model @xcite a flat brane is embedded into an anti de sitter ( ads ) bulk in a @xmath1-symmetric way , later generalizations have evolved into considering curved branes , embedded both symmetrically and asymmetrically into a bulk characterized by both weyl- and ricci - curvatures .",
    "a negative bulk cosmological constant has a warping effect .",
    "the bulk can host non - standard model fields , like moduli or dilatonic scalar fields or a radiation of quantum origin .",
    "such models are motivated by string /  m - theory .    in brane - world models",
    "the projection of the 5d einstein gravity onto the brane leads to a 4d gravitational dynamics @xcite , which is different from the einstein gravity .",
    "an essential modification appears at high energies in the form of a new source term in the effective einstein equation , which is quadratic in the brane energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this source term becomes negligible at low energies .",
    "therefore early cosmology is modified , however late - time cosmology is not .",
    "another modification arises whenever the bulk has a weyl - curvature with non - vanishing projection onto the brane .",
    "this is known as the electric part of the bulk weyl tensor .",
    "the possible asymmetric embedding contributes with a third unconventional source term in the effective einstein equation @xcite .",
    "so does the non - standard model bulk matter , via the pull - back to the brane of its energy - momentum tensor .",
    "solar system tests , all in the weak gravity regime , could not confirm or disprove the quadratic source term , but can put strong limits on the other types of modifications .",
    "quantum corrections arising from the coupling between bulk gravity and brane matter , known as induced gravity , were introduced originally in @xcite and presented in the most generic covariant form ( including asymmetry ) in @xcite .",
    "corrections from higher order curvature invariants , more specifically gauss - bonnet type modifications , which are motivated by the ads / cft correspondence , were discussed covariantly in @xcite .    even in the simplest of these models , with the gauss - bonnet and induced gravity contributions switched off , the possible brane - worlds can be of great variety , according to the symmetries of the brane .",
    "friedmann branes , for example , are known to be embeddible into any of the schwarzschild / reissner - nordstrm / vaidya - anti de sitter bulks ( depending on the energy - momentum in the bulk ; for a systematic treatment see @xcite ) .",
    "cosmological evolution has been extensively studied in this scenario ( for symmetric embeddings see @xcite , @xcite and references therein ; for asymmetric embeddings @xcite , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "the matter in the bulk affects the cosmological evolution on the brane through a `` comoving mass '' and a bulk pressure @xcite , @xcite .",
    "other branes of cosmological type , like the einstein brane @xcite or the kantowski - sachs type homogeneous brane @xcite , are embedded into a vacuum bulk which is _ not _ schwarzschild - anti de sitter ( sads ) .",
    "black hole type branes again are not embedded into a sads bulk . the spherically symmetric , static black hole on the brane @xcite is given by the reissner - nordstrm metric of general relativity , with the ( square of the ) electric charge replaced by a tidal charge .",
    "the tidal charge @xmath2 can take both positive and negative values , in contrast with the general relativistic case , when @xmath3 represents the square of the electric charge , @xmath2 being always positive .",
    "due to the @xmath2 term , the tidal charged black hole presents @xmath4 type corrections to the schwarzschild potential .",
    "this has to be contrasted with the @xmath5 type correction to the schwarzschild potential @xcite , @xcite-@xcite , arising in the weak field analysis of the spherically symmetric gravitational collapse on the brane in the original rs setup .",
    "as such corrections are related to the electric part of the bulk weyl curvature ( the kaluza - klein , kk modes of gravity ) , the bulk in which the tidal charged black hole can be embedded , can not be sads .",
    "neither is the bulk containing a schwarzschild black hole ( @xmath6 ) on the brane .",
    "in fact , the bulk containing the tidal charged brane black hole remains unknown .",
    "incorporating black hole singularities in brane - world models is a difficult task . in the original , simplest rs model @xcite , containing a flat brane , there are no black holes at all . in its curved , cosmological generalizations",
    "no black holes can exist on the brane - except as test particles . among the black hole space - times of general relativity ,",
    "remarkably , the schwarzschild solution still solves the modified gravitational equations on the brane , under the assumptions of vacuum and no electric  bulk weyl source term .",
    "( this is the tidal charged brane black hole with @xmath7 . )",
    "it was conjectured in @xcite , that a schwarzschild brane can be embedded in the bulk only by extending the singularity into the bulk . in this way one obtains a black string with singular ads horizon . due to",
    "the gregory - laflamme instability @xcite the black string can decay into a black cigar @xcite , although other arguments show that under very mild assumptions , classical event horizons can not pinch off @xcite .",
    "stable black string solutions with no weyl source arise in the two brane model of @xcite .",
    "recently , the gravity wave perturbations of such a black - string brane - world were computed @xcite . only if the bulk contains exotic matter ,",
    "the schwarzschild brane black hole is allowed to have regular ads horizon @xcite . in any case",
    "the brane black hole is not localized on the brane .",
    "more generically , in brane - worlds any event horizon on the brane can hide a singularity which may even not be on the brane .",
    "rotating stationary axisymmetric black holes with tidal charge , localized on the brane in the rs brane - world model were presented in @xcite and brane black hole solutions in a simple model with induced gravity were given in @xcite , @xcite .",
    "the gravitational collapse on the brane in the presence of curvature corrections was also studied in @xcite .",
    "the formation of black holes is quite different in brane - worlds , as compared to general relativity .",
    "this is because well - known processes from general relativity are modified due to the unconventional brane - specific sources .",
    "however , the `` energy momentum squared '' source term becomes dominant at high energies .",
    "such high energies are certainly occurring in the final stages of the gravitational collapse , therefore serious modifications are to be expected in comparison with the general relativistic gravitational collapse .",
    "based on the tidal charged brane black hole solution , which is set as the exterior of the collapsing object , the gravitational collapse of a _ dust sphere _ was analyzed @xcite and indeed , sharp differences as compared to the general relativistic oppenheimer - snyder collapse oppsny were found .",
    "first it was shown that the idealized collapse of homogeneous kk energy density with static exterior leads to either a bounce , a black hole or a naked singularity .",
    "this result has no counterpart in general relativity .",
    "second , in the _ absence _ of the tidal charge ( no kk energy density ) , the vacuum surrounding the collapsing sphere of _ dust _ could not be _",
    "this is in sharp contrast with general relativity , where the birkhoff theorem yields the schwarzschild solution outside any spherically symmetric configuration as the unique vacuum .",
    "the non - static exterior of the collapsing brane star could be the vaidya radiating solution on the brane @xcite .",
    "moreover , this can be regarded as an intermediate radiation layer , and matched from exterior to the tidal charged brane black hole solution @xcite . according to this model ,",
    "the spherically symmetric collapse on the brane is accompanied by radiation , in contrast with general relativity .",
    "alternatively , in a special toy model a hawking flux was shown to appear from a collapsing spherically symmetric dust object on the brane casadiogermani . a related result states that the vacuum exterior of a spherical star has radiative - type stresses , and",
    "again the exterior is not a schwarzschild space - time @xcite .",
    "an effective schwarzschild solution on the brane was however shown to exist if there is energy exchange between the bulk and the brane collapsing star @xcite .",
    "the above mentioned results refer to collapsing spherically symmetric matter configurations with vanishing surface pressure . but as pointed out first in @xcite , the junction conditions on the boundary of a star in brane - world theories do not necessarily require a vanishing pressure on the junction surface .",
    "this is , because the multitude of source terms in the effective einstein equation can conspire in such a way that the _ effective _ pressure still vanishes on the junction surface with the vacuum exterior , in spite of a non - vanishing ordinary pressure .",
    "the same conclusion on the junction surface emerged in @xcite , where the possibility of a swiss - cheese brane - world was raised .",
    "the generic junction conditions between the schwarzschild vacua embedded in the flrw brane along spheres of constant comoving radii were exploited in swisscheese and @xcite by discussing models of black strings penetrating a cosmological brane .    in this paper",
    "we drop the assumption of vanishing surface pressure on the boundary of the collapsing matter configuration .",
    "obviously then the dust model for the collapsing matter is given up .",
    "the gravitational collapse of spherically symmetric _ perfect fluid _",
    "matter configuration can be modeled by immersing a flrw sphere into a static vacuum .",
    "mathematically the problem of a collapsing perfect fluid sphere immersed into a static vacuum becomes very similar to the reverse problem of embedding of the schwarzschild vacua into flrw branes .    by lifting the requirement of vanishing pressure we can achieve a static exterior of the collapsing star even in the absence of the kk energy density and even without inserting an intermediate radiation layer",
    "this will be shown in the following section . in the original rs setup",
    "the assumption of a static exterior without tidal charge can be justified whenever the radius of the collapsing sphere is much higher then the characteristic scale @xmath8 of the extra dimension @xcite . with @xmath9 mm from table - top experiments @xcite and for astrophysical or galactic black holes , this is certainly the case .    in section 3",
    "we discuss the results and comment on the formation of the black hole and singularity .",
    "finally , section 4 contains the concluding remarks .    throughout the paper we use units @xmath10 .",
    "we choose a simple scenario , with vanishing cosmological constant on the brane , @xmath11 ( randall - sundrum fine - tuning ) .",
    "the collapsing star is described by the flrw metric with flat spatial sections , @xmath12 .",
    "the static vacuum exterior is the schwarzschild metric .",
    "this simplification arises by switching off the kk modes .",
    "table - top experiments @xcite on possible deviations from newton s law currently probe gravity at submillimeter scales and as a result they constrain the characteristic curvature scale of the bulk to @xmath9 mm",
    ". therefore our results will apply to collapse situations which may end in black holes with radii @xmath13 . with this choice we focus on the effect of the non - linear source terms on the gravitational collapse .",
    "the junction condition of these two space - times along spheres of constant comoving radius @xmath14 was derived in @xcite : @xmath15where @xmath16 is the scale factor in the flrw metric .",
    "we apply the above result for a stellar model with boundary surface in free fall , given by @xmath17constant .",
    "then @xmath18 is the schwarzschild mass of the collapsing star .",
    "the integration of eq .",
    "( [ junct1 ] ) gives the evolution of the scale factor of the collapsing star in comoving time @xmath19 : @xmath20 in order to describe a collapse situation we have chosen the @xmath21  root of eq .",
    "( [ junct1 ] ) and we have kept the integration constant @xmath22 , which represents the scale factor at the beginning of the collapse ( at @xmath23 ) , see @xcite . ] .",
    "it is immediate to see that the collapse ends when @xmath24 is reached , after finite time @xmath25 .",
    "how is the schwarzschild mass @xmath18 related to the integral of the energy density over the volume of the star ?",

    "if @xmath26 would be constant , the energy density of the star would scale as @xmath34 , cf .",

    "the star therefore would consist of dust , as the pressure would vanish by virtue of the continuity equation @xmath35 for such a dust sphere the exterior can not be static , and we arrive to the no - go result presented in @xcite .    however , as remarked earlier , it is not compulsory to impose a vanishing pressure in the star .",
    "the energy density of an ideal fluid _ with pressure _ does not evolve as @xmath36 .",
    "this means that @xmath26 varies .",

    "the bardeen mass contains contributions not only from matter , but from gravitational energy as well . therefore it should be different compared to the general relativistic bardeen mass ( which agrees with the physical  mass @xmath26 ) because in brane - worlds the gravitational dynamics is modified ( in the present case by @xmath64 source terms ) .    in the chosen simple scenario , with no bulk matter and no weyl contribution to the sources from the bulk ,",
    "the effective einstein equation for the exterior region is the _ vacuum _ einstein equation of general relativity . for spherical symmetry",

    "being satisfied somewhere below the horizon for all black holes , the collapse of the fluid will not be stopped or even slowed down . due to the energy - squared source term , appearing in the modified brane dynamics",
    ", the fluid further evolves into a central singularity .",
    "thus as in general relativity , the singularity is formed in brane - world theory too .",
    "the appearance of the tension in the collapsing fluid is a pure brane - world effect .",
    "as we have disregarded the weyl - source term of the bulk , the rising tension is due solely to the source term quadratic in the fluid energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this source term modifies the early cosmology ( before bbn ) in an essential way .",
    "the same happens in the case of the gravitational collapse : a tension rises , induced by the non - linearity of the dynamical equations in the energy - momentum tensor . in this sense ,",
    "the tension in the fluid is an expressions of the interaction of the fluid with the brane .",
    "however as long as the brane is considered as a hypersurface in the mathematical sense ( with only one characteristics , the brane tension ) such an interaction could not be described phenomenologically .",
    "this feature of the model may be an indication for the need of a description based on thick - branes ."
