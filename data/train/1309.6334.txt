    "black holes represent the ultimate frontier in astrophysics : the one - way passage to the unknown and the unknowable .",
    "these exotic objects are defined by a characteristic radius known as the event horizon : the radius from the central collapsed remnant ( or singularity ) at which the escape velocity of the black hole equals the speed of light .",
    "black holes therefore emit no light themselves , and we can only observe them indirectly by analyzing the electromagnetic ( e / m ) radiation released from the gas they accrete .",
    "this accretion typically takes the form of a geometrically - thin , optically - thick disk ( shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) for black holes which are actively accreting gas ( @xmath0 , miller 2007 ) .",
    "the finite value of the speed of light renders all material and spacetime within the event horizon causally separated from the universe in which we live ; at present , there is no known way to access information from beyond the event horizon .",
    "years to evaporate via this process .",
    "a supermassive black hole would take considerably longer . ] due to this limitation , all of our knowledge of black hole systems comes from einstein s special and general theories of relativity , and from e / m observations of accretion disks around known or suspected black hole systems which are , almost invariably , bright and/or nearby .    in spite of their enigmatic nature , black holes are arguably the simplest objects in the universe , possessing only three fundamental properties by which they can be completely defined :",
    "( 1 ) mass , ( 2 ) spin , and ( 3 ) electric charge . in practice , the electric charge of a black hole in any environment other than a pure vacuum is assumed to be negligible , as the black hole would rapidly accrete oppositely charged particles and neutralize itself .",
    "mass and spin or angular momentum are thus the only two meaningful properties that describe an astrophysical black hole ( kerr 1963 ) .",
    "the mass of a black hole determines the degree to which the spacetime in which it resides is warped ( as in the classic `` bowling ball on a trampoline '' analogy ) , whereas spin determines the degree to which that spacetime is twisted ( much like beaters in thick batter ) .",
    "the masses of stellar - mass black holes within our own galaxy are typically determined by examining the orbital and radiative properties of their companion stars .",
    "measuring the masses of smbhs can be more difficult , however .",
    "several methods have been developed to estimate the masses of smbhs : e.g. , reverberation mapping ( blandford & mckee 1982 ) , stellar velocity dispersion ( ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) , tracing of stellar orbits ( ghez 2000 , genzel 2000 ) , maser observations ( watson & wallin 1994 ) , and gravitational lensing ( silvestro 1974 ) .",
    "most of these methods rely on measuring radiation emitted relatively far from the black hole .",
    "observationally , black holes range in size from @xmath1 , with most stellar - mass black holes clustered in the @xmath2 range and most smbhs with masses of @xmath3 . over the last decade",
    "there has been some evidence to support the existence of intermediate mass black holes with masses of order @xmath4 ( e.g. , miller & colbert 2004 ) .    though black hole mass is by no means trivial to measure , spin is the more challenging property to ascertain .",
    "in contrast to constraining mass , measuring spin requires probing the nature of the spacetime within a few gravitational radii of the event horizon ( where the gravitational radius is defined as @xmath5 ; @xmath6 is newton s constant , @xmath7 is the mass of the black hole and @xmath8 is the speed of light ) .",
    "the angular momentum of a black hole only manifests through lense - thirring precession , also known as frame - dragging , which occurs only in the innermost part of the accretion disk where relativistic effects cause the spacetime in this region to become twisted in the same direction that the black hole is rotating . to observe this effect ,",
    "observations of the innermost disk must be made in x - rays , given the energetic processes at work in the cores of actively - accreting black holes .",
    "current x - ray telescopes lack the spatial resolution necessary to resolve the innermost regions of the accretion disk , even in bright , nearby agn . as such , x - ray spectra taken from the core of the agn are the tool of choice for examining the spacetime of the inner disk .",
    "spin ( in dimensionless form ) is defined as @xmath9 , where cosmic censorship within the framework of general relativity dictates that @xmath10 ( negative spin values represent retrograde configurations in which the black hole spins in the opposite direction to the disk , positive values denote prograde spin configurations , and @xmath11 implies a non - spinning black hole ) , and @xmath12 represents the black hole angular momentum ( bardeen , press & teukolsky 1972 , thorne 1974 ) . if spin is known to within @xmath13 , then meaningful correlations can be drawn between spin and other environmental variables , e.g. , the history of the accretion flow and the presence and power of relativistic jets in the system .",
    "supermassive black holes are particularly interesting to examine , given that their masses and spins have likely evolved considerably in the billions of years since their formation .",
    "smbhs grow by either merging with other black holes or accreting gas , most often by a combination of the two processes ( e.g. , volonteri 2005 ) . additionally ,",
    "as a smbh grows , it can go through periods where it produces powerful outflows of kinetic and radiative energy through the production of winds and jets ( fabian 2012 ) , seeding the surrounding environment with matter and energy .",
    "such heating of the ambient gas in and around the host galaxy may ultimately play a significant role in regulating its rate of star formation .",
    "this type of `` feedback '' process has been cited as a potential explanation for the famed @xmath14 relation linking the mass of the smbh to the velocities of the stars in the central bulge of its host galaxy , as well as to the mass of the bulge itself ( e.g. , ferrarese & merritt 2000 , gltekin 2009 ) . given that jets are thought to be launched by the magnetic extraction of rotational energy from the ergosphere of the black hole ( blandford & znajek 1977 ) when the black hole spin gets sufficiently large ( @xmath15 ; agol & krolik 2000 ) , spin may play a siginficant role in regulating galaxy growth on scales far beyond the gravitational sphere of influence of the black hole .    put simply",
    ", measurements of the spins of smbhs in agn can contribute to our understanding of these complex and energetic environments in three principal ways :    * they offer a rare probe of the nature of the spacetime proximal to the event horizon of the black hole , well within the strong - field gravity regime ( fabian 1989 , laor 1991 ) ; * they can shed light on the relation of a black hole s angular momentum to its outflow power in the form of jets ( e.g. , narayan & mcclintock 2012 , steiner 2012 for stellar - mass black holes ) ; * they can also inform us about the relative role of gas accretion vs. mergers in recent epochs of the life of the host galaxy and its agn ( berti & volonteri 2008 ) .    for these reasons , developing a theoretical and observational framework in which to measure black hole spin accurately and precisely is of critical importance to our understanding of how galaxies form and evolve over cosmic time .",
    "advances in theoretical modeling as well as observational sensitivity in the _ chandra / xmm - newton / suzaku _ era are finally producing robust constraints on the spins of a handful of smbhs .",
    "computationally , new algorithms developed within the past decade ( doviak 2004 , beckwith & done 2005 , brenneman & reynolds 2006 , dauser 2010 , 2013 ) have made it possible to perform fully relativistic ray - tracing of photon paths emanating from the accretion disk close to the black hole , keeping the black hole spin as a variable parameter in the model .",
    "when such models are fit to high signal - to - noise ( s / n ) x - ray spectra from the innermost accretion disk , they yield vital physical information about the black hole / disk system , including constraints on how fast and in what direction the black hole is rotating .    in this work",
    ", i discuss our current knowledge of the distribution of smbh spins in the local universe and future directions of black hole spin research .",
    "i begin in  2 with an examination of the spectral modeling techniques used to measure black hole spin , focusing on those most effective in constraining spin in agn .",
    "i then discuss the models involved , reviewing the caveats that must be considered in the process in  3 . in ",
    "4 i demonstrate the application of these techniques to deep observations of the nearby , type 1 agn mcg6 - 30 - 15 , ngc  3783 and fairall  9 .",
    "i examining our current knowledge of the spin distribution of local smbhs in  5 , along with its implications .",
    "future directions for this field of research are presented in  6 .",
    "in principle , there are at least five ways that spin can be measured for a single ( i.e. , non - merging ) smbh .",
    "all five are predicated on the assumption that general relativity provides the correct description of the spacetime near the black hole , and that there is an easily - characterized , monotonic relation between the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit ( isco ) of the accretion disk and the black hole spin ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : isco ] ) . the disk is also assumed to remain geometrically thin , optically thick and radiatively efficient down to the isco boundary , and to truncate relatively rapidly therein ( see  [ sec : systematics ] ) .",
    "the five methods for measuring spin are listed below .    *",
    "* thermal continuum fitting * ( e.g. , remillard & mcclintock 2006 ) treats the inner accretion disk as a modified blackbody , and the radius of the isco is computed via the stefan - boltzmann law , by measuring the peak temperature and flux of this blackbody ( @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the disk blackbody flux , @xmath18 is the distance to the source , @xmath19 is the radius of the isco , @xmath20 is the peak blackbody temperature of the disk , and @xmath21 is the inclination angle of the disk to our line of sight ) .",
    "the physics behind this method is straightforward , much like the method one would use to measure the photospheric radius of a star .",
    "when dealing with an accretion disk , however , caveats include the degree to which the disk emission is comptonized by the highly ionized disk atmosphere ( `` spectral hardening , '' as per davis 2006 ) , which can be difficult to quantify precisely .",
    "the disk luminosity must also fall within a range roughly @xmath22 of the eddington value in order to ensure that the blackbody emission dominates over the comptonized , power - law component . because this method also relies on precise , accurate , independent measurements of the distance to and mass of the black hole , as well as its disk inclination angle , the thermal continuum fitting method",
    "can only viably be used to measure spin in stellar - mass black holes ( for which there are @xmath23 published spin constraints at the time of this writing ) . moreover",
    ", the temperature of the accretion disk goes as @xmath24 ( frank , king & raine 2002 ) , so the blackbody peak for agn disks is in the uv , whereas stellar - mass black hole disks peak in soft x - rays .",
    "the prevalence of absorption in the uv band can present serious complications for accurately measuring the thermal disk emission in agn . * * inner disk reflection modeling * ( e.g. , brenneman & reynolds 2006 ; hereafter br06 ) assumes that the high - energy x - ray emission ( @xmath25 ) is dominated by thermal , uv disk emission which has been comptonized by hot electrons in a centrally - concentrated `` corona . ''",
    "this structure may represent the disk atmosphere , the base of a jet or some alternative geometry ( e.g. , markoff , nowak & wilms 2005 ) . some of the comptonized photons will scatter out of the system and form the power - law continuum characteristic of typical agn in x - rays .",
    "a certain percentage of the photons , however , will be scattered back down ( `` reflected '' ) onto the surface of the disk again .",
    "provided that the disk is not completely ionized , the irradiation from the continuum power - law photons will excite a series of fluorescent emission lines of various atomic species at energies @xmath26 , along with a `` compton hump '' shaped by the fe k absorption edge at @xmath27 and by downscattering at @xmath28 ( see fig .  [ fig : refl_spec ] ) .",
    "the most prominent of the fluorescent lines produced is fe k@xmath29 at a rest - frame energy of @xmath30 , due largely to its high abundance and fluorescent yield .",
    "as such , the fe k@xmath29 line is the most important diagnostic feature of the inner disk reflection spectrum ; its shape is altered from the typical near - delta function profile expected in a laboratory , becoming highly broadened and skewed due to the combination of doppler and relativistic effects close to the black hole ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fek ] ) .",
    "the energy at which the `` red '' wing ( i.e. , low - energy tail ) of this line truncates is directly linked to the location of the isco , and therefore the spin of the black hole ( see reynolds & nowak 2003 and miller 2007 for comprehensive reviews of the reflection modeling technique ) .",
    "this method does not require _ a priori _ knowledge of the mass , distance or inclination of the black hole system in question , and can therefore be applied to any black hole system . however , the principal caveat for the reflection method is that the effects of disk ionization ( especially in stellar - mass black holes with hotter disks , e.g. , davis 2006 ) and/or complex absorption from gas along the line of sight to the system ( particularly within agn systems ; e.g. , halpern 1984 , reynolds 1997 ) can make the determination of the low - energy bound of the red wing challenging . * * high frequency quasi - periodic oscillations * ( e.g. , strohmayer 2001 ) , in which the x - ray power density spectrum of the emission from the inner accretion disk is characterized by @xmath31 pulses at certain harmonic frequencies ( e.g. , in a 3:2 ratio ) , indicative of some type of resonance or regular oscillation within the accretion flow in this region .",
    "such phenomena have been reported commonly in actively accreting stellar - mass black holes ( e.g. , ptri 2008 ) , but only once in an agn ( gierliski 2008 ) .",
    "the physical mechanism for producing these hfqpos is not yet known , but if the frequencies at which they are observed are related in a fundamental way to the frequency of the isco ( the fourier transform of its period of rotation around the black hole ) , then the radius of the isco could potentially be derived from hfqpo observations , and the black hole spin thereby inferred . * * x - ray polarimetry * ( e.g. , tomsick 2009 ) , in which the reflected emission from the inner accretion disk is expected to be polarized if the disk is indeed a geometrically - thin , optically thick slab of gas , as expected ( i.e. , shakura & sunyaev 1973 ) .",
    "the degree and angle of the observed polarization vs. energy function would then have a characteristic shape depending on the spin of the black hole , due to the influence of the black hole spin on the shape of the spacetime immediately surrounding the black hole , and the radius of the isco ( schnittman & krolik 2009 ) .",
    "measurements of the degree and angle of polarization vs. energy would require a sensitive x - ray polarimeter to be flow in space , however , and there are currently no active or planned missions to incorporate such an instrument .",
    "* * imaging the event horizon shadow * ( e.g. , broderick 2011 ) , in which sub - mm very long baseline interferometry ( vlbi ) is used to obtain micro - arcsecond spatial resolution to produce the first - ever images of the innermost accretion disk surrounding a black hole . by comparing these images with detailed models of the appearance of the innermost disk , which incorporate the necessary relativity and light bending as a function of physical parameters such as the radius of the isco , the black hole spin can be constrained ( doeleman 2008 ) .",
    "both the modeling and vlbi measurement techniques are a work in progress at present , however , and this method is currently only able to achieve the spatial resolution necessary to image black holes with event horizons of comparatively large angular size ( tens of micro - arcseconds ) , limiting the sample to sgr a * and m87 at present .",
    "there are limitations in applying the last three methods listed above , and the continuum fitting method has only been applied successfully to stellar - mass black holes .",
    "we are therefore currently restricted to using only the reflection modeling method for constraining the spins of smbhs in agn .",
    "though the reflection modeling method could , in principle , be used to measure the angular momentum of an actively accreting black hole of any mass , we restrict our focus here to determining spin in smbhs .      an agn must satisfy a few important requirements in order to be a viable candidate for obtaining spin constraints .",
    "firstly , it must be bright enough to achieve the necessary s / n in x - rays to accurately separate the reflection spectrum from ( a ) the continuum , and ( b ) any intrinsic absorption within the host galaxy and its nucleus .",
    "typically one must obtain @xmath32 photons over the @xmath33 energy range ( guainazzi 2006 ) , though in practice the required number of counts can be substantially higher in sources with complex absorption .",
    "secondly , the agn must possess a broad fe k@xmath29 line of sufficient strength relative to the continuum to allow its red wing to be successfully located ; usually this corresponds to a line equivalent width of @xmath34 .",
    "the first and best - studied broad iron line in an agn is that of mcg6 - 30 - 15 , which was initially discovered in an _ asca _ observation by tanaka ( 1995 ) , largely because of its high equivalent width ( @xmath35 ) .",
    "the strength and breadth of this feature have been confirmed in subsequent _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ observations by many authors , most recently brenneman & reynolds ( 2006 ) , miniutti ( 2007 ) , and chiang & fabian ( 2011 ) .",
    "not all type 1 agn have been observed to possess such features , however .",
    "recent surveys of hundreds of agn with _ xmm - newton _ have concluded that broadened fe k@xmath29 lines are only present in @xmath36 of all bright , nearby type 1 agn ( nandra 2007 , de la calle prez 2010 ) , and some broad iron lines have been ephemeral , appearing and disappearing in the same object observed during different epochs ( e.g. , ngc  5548 , brenneman 2012 ) .",
    "thirdly , the fe k@xmath29 line in question must be _ relativistically _ broad in order to be used to constrain black hole spin ; that is , it must have a measured inner disk edge assumed to correspond to the isco of @xmath37 . because the measurement of spin is predicated on the assumption that the inner edge of the disk truncates at the isco , the traditional approach when employing spectral models for the iron line ( and other reflection features ) that allow black hole spin to be a free parameter in the fit is to fix @xmath38 . a valuable first step before applying such a model , however , is to assess the location of the inner edge of the disk by first fitting the iron line with a fixed - spin model such as diskline ( @xmath11 ; fabian et al . 1989 ) or laor ( @xmath39 ; laor 1991 ) and allowing the @xmath40 to fit freely .",
    "if @xmath41 , subsequent fitting with a free - spin model will return believable spin constraints .    though line - only models are useful as a tool to establish an initial starting point in parameter space for spectral fitting , it is important to model the inner disk full reflection spectrum when making spin measurements , not just the broad fe k@xmath29 line .",
    "separate , line - only models can be misleading when attempting robust spin measurements because they do not take into account the curvature of the reflection spectrum over the full energy range of the data , e.g. , from the compton hump and associated iron edge absorption . only an accurate , holistic modeling approach that treats the continuum , absorption and the entire reflection spectrum at once will yield robust constraints on black hole spin .    taking all these points into consideration ,",
    "the potential sample size of spin measurements for agn in the local universe is @xmath42 sources ( miller 2007 ) .",
    "most of these agn are type 1 , lacking significant obscuration by dust and gas along the line of sight to the inner disk .",
    "though it is possible to obtain spin measurements for more heavily absorbed type 2 sources , great care must be taken to properly account for all of the absorption in the system .",
    "the reflection spectrum from the inner disk can be self - consistently reproduced by models such as reflionx ( ross & fabian 2005 ; see fig .  [",
    "fig : refl_spec ] ) or xillver ( garcia & kallman 2010 ) .",
    "these models simulate not only the broad fe k@xmath29 line , but all other fluorescent emission species at lower energies , as well as the compton hump at higher energies .",
    "typical free parameters include the ionization of the disk and its iron abundance ( assumed , simplistically , to be constant values ) , the photon index of the irradiating power - law continuum ( usually tied to that of the power - law itself ) , and the flux or normalization of the reflection spectrum . in order to incorporate the effects of relativity and doppler shift , this static reflection spectrum",
    "must then be convolved with a smearing algorithm which computes the photon trajectories and energies during transfer from the accretion disk to the observer .",
    "several free - spin smearing algorithms are currently available for use ( see  1 ) .",
    "the kerrconv algorithm of br06 is the only one of these models that is currently built into xspec , though it limits black hole spin to prograde values only .",
    "a more recent improvement is the relconv model of dauser ( 2010 , 2013 ) , which generalizes the possible spins to incorporate retrograde black holes ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : fek ] ) .    isolating",
    "the inner disk reflection spectrum from other x - ray spectral signatures is often the greatest challenge in obtaining robust constraints on black hole spin , even in deep ( @xmath43 ) observations of bright agn . due to the relatively poor spatial resolution of x - ray telescopes ,",
    "the spectra obtained from the cores of agn represent a superposition of emission and absorption from several different physical processes within these regions .",
    "the principal components of agn x - ray spectra ( other than relativistic reflection ) and their physical origins are enumerated below .",
    "most , though not all , of these components are present in any given agn .    1 .",
    "* continuum emission : * as discussed in  2 , the source of the continuum in x - rays is compton upscattering of thermal photons from the accretion disk . at present",
    "very little is known about the origin , geometry and location of the hot electrons responsible for this scattering , but the timescales of variability ( @xmath44hours ) for the power - law component in agn spectra suggest that this corona is compact and likely also close to the accretion disk ( e.g. , markoff , nowak & wilms 2005 ) .",
    "magnetic fields almost certainly play a critical role in its formation , perhaps facilitating the heating and/or flaring of certain regions of the electron plasma ( di matteo 2001 ) .",
    "though this corona is readily approximated by a power - law with a high - energy cutoff ( a proxy for the electron temperature ) , more physical models have been created which include free parameters for optical depth , electron temperature , seed photon temperature , compactness , thermal vs. non - thermal electron population , etc .",
    "three of the most popular of these models are comptt ( titarchuk 1994 ) , its successor , compps ( poutanen & svensson 1996 ) , and eqpair ( coppi 1999 ) .",
    "* intrinsic cold ( neutral ) absorption : * the putative molecular torus of agn unification schemes ( antonucci 1993 , urry & padovani 1995 ) manifests in two forms in x - rays : as the source of the primary neutral absorbing column within the nucleus , and as a scattering medium for the continuum emission , forming the distant reflection signatures discussed in item @xmath45 below .",
    "this reservoir of gas is a relatively cold , neutral , optically - thick medium thought to reside on the order of @xmath46 from the black hole .",
    "its gas appears to be anisotropically distributed , though its origins are still a topic of active research .",
    "the radius of this neutral gas from the black hole , with respect to the broad emission line region ( belr ) , may vary from object to object , however .",
    "for example , ngc  1365 shows evidence for a clumpy absorber at a radius @xmath47 from the black hole , well within the belr , in which the clumps of gas eclipse the inner disk / corona region ( e.g. , risaliti 2005a , maiolino 2010 , brenneman 2013 ) .",
    "recent work suggests that radiation pressure may play a prominent role in forming these collections of neutral gas ( elvis 2012 ) .",
    "whatever its origin , this cold absorbing gas is best modeled with a simple photoelectric absorption component whose low - energy cutoff is determined by the column density of the gas ( e.g. , phabs , within xspec , or tbabs , from wilms , allen & mccray 2000 ) , or a partial - covering variant of these models with an additional parameter for the covering fraction of the gas over the continuum source ( e.g. , pcfabs , within xspec ) .",
    "intrinsic warm ( ionized ) absorption : * some of the first signatures of ionized absorbing gas within agn were originally reported by halpern ( 1984 ) , though they were not detected commonly in x - rays until the _ asca _ era ( e.g. , reynolds 1997 ) .",
    "early ccd resolution could only detect the two most obvious manifestations of these features , the ovii and oviii absorption edges at @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively .",
    "but with the advent of grating spectroscopy in the _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ era , warm absorbers are now known to harbor a rich forest of lines and edges from various species of gas and dust ( lee 2010 ) .",
    "the presence of these features can extend up into the fe k band in some cases where the ionization of the gas is high enough , and are sometimes associated with outflows having speeds of up to @xmath50 based on their blueshifted absorption features ( e.g. , tombesi 2010 ) .",
    "most warm absorbers are now thought to incorporate several `` zones '' of material , distinct in their kinematic properties as well as their column densities and ionizations , but maintained in pressure balance ( e.g. , ngc  3783 ; krongold 2003 ) .",
    "though they can be modeled with individual absorption lines and edges , the most self - consistent way to model these features over an entire spectrum is with tables produced by spectral synthesis codes ( including radiative transfer ) such as cloudy ( ferland 2013 ) or xstar ( kallman & bautista 2001 ) .",
    "* distant reflection : * when irradiated by the x - ray power - law continuum emission , the outer disk / torus produces a reflection spectrum much like that of the inner accretion disk , only without the convolved relativistic effects due to its distance from the black hole ( george & fabian 1991 , matt 1992 ) .",
    "the narrow fe k@xmath29 line and compton hump are the two most prominent features of this distant reflection spectrum ; in fact , the narrow fe k@xmath29 line appears to be nearly ubiquitous in seyfert 1 galaxies ( yaqoob & padmanabhan 2004 ) .",
    "though the compton hump can be modeled adequately with a pexrav component ( magdziarz & zdziarski 1995 ) , one must include additional gaussian emission lines to model the discrete fe k features .",
    "alternatively , the pexmon model ( nandra 2007 ) includes the fe k@xmath29 , k@xmath51 and ni k@xmath29 lines as well as the compton shoulder of the fe k@xmath29 line self - consistently with the pexrav reflected continuum .",
    "there are two important caveats to keep in mind when applying these models , however : ( 1 ) pexrav and pexmon are designed to simulate the spectrum produced from the irradiation of a thin disk rather than a puffy or toroidal structure , so this model may not be an accurate representation of the system ; ( 2 ) neither model accounts for the contribution of the cold reflected emission at energies @xmath52 .",
    "to consider the contribution from emission below this energy , one can also use a static reflionx model to simulate the contribution from the torus across all energies , though this model also assumes a disk geometry .",
    "the mytorus model of murphy & yaqoob ( 2009 ) is a more physical alternative that takes the geometry of the reprocessing medium into account , as well as its low - energy emission , though at present it is unclear how well the opening angle of the reprocessor can be constrained , and the model does not allow the iron abundance of the reprocessor to vary freely . 5 .",
    "* soft excess emission : * some of the first observational evidence for a `` soft excess '' in x - rays above the power - law continuum was observed by _",
    "exosat _ in mrk  841 ( arnaud 1985 ) .",
    "though this emission can be well fit with a blackbody or modified disk blackbody ( diskbb ) component , however , the typical temperature ( @xmath53 ) is too high to be thermal emission from the disk in an agn , as a rule .",
    "advanced ccd and grating spectra made possible in the _ chandra / xmm - newton / suzaku _ era have since demonstrated both the ubiquity of this feature in agn with moderate - to - high accretion rates , and that the typical temperature of this component does not appear to change with source luminosity , posing theoretical problems for many thermal and single - zone comptonization models ( bianchi 2009 , done 2012 ) .",
    "other possible origins for the soft excess include a contribution from inner disk reflection , photoionized or extended thermal plasma emission ( e.g. , from a circumnuclear starburst region ) , scattering of continuum photons , or emission from the base of a jet ( see lohfink 2013a and references therein ) .",
    "because the soft excess typically manifests as a smooth feature , an adequate fit can be equally well achieved with any ( or more than one ) of the above modeling components , leading to uncertainty about its physical origin .",
    "the best - fit model component(s ) of the soft excess also seem to vary between agn .",
    "effective modeling of the soft excess is critical to constraining the physical parameters of the agn spectrum , however , because x - ray detectors tend to have higher collecting areas at lower energies where this component dominates ( i.e. , @xmath54 ) .",
    "the fit statistic will therefore be dominated by this region of the spectrum as well .",
    "an examination of the time - averaged spectrum maximizes the s / n of the observation and allows one to assess which physical components are present in the data .",
    "by contrast , time - resolved spectroscopy is critical for identifying and properly modeling the various physical components of a typical agn system .",
    "many of these components may vary substantially during the observation , and those variations may appear averaged - out and provide misleading information about the source when viewed through the time - averaged spectrum alone .    whenever possible ( i.e. , given enough s / n in reasonable time bins , @xmath55 counts per bin ) , a time - resolved spectral analysis should be undertaken in addition to the time - averaged analysis .",
    "data from different time intervals and/or flux states within an observation ( or indeed , data of the same source taken during multiple epochs ) can be analyzed jointly in order to assess the physical nature and variability of all of the components in a given x - ray spectrum , often yielding a more physical picture of the system whose changes during an observation are washed out in a time - averaged spectrum .",
    "for example , the power - law and inner disk reflection are expected to vary on timescales as short as hours in a typical agn if the continuum emission and reflection are centrally concentrated ( e.g. , miniutti & fabian 2004 , uttley , mchardy & vaughan 2005 ) . by contrast ,",
    "distant reflection from the outer disk / torus region typically varies on the order of @xmath44days - weeks ( mchardy , papadakis & uttley 1999 ) , and warm absorbers can show changes in their column densities and/or ionizations on timescales of @xmath44weeks - months ( krongold 2005 ) .",
    "both of these components take longer to respond to changes in the continuum emission than the inner disk radii due to their relatively large distances from the corona . the soft excess in many agn is often unrelated to source luminosity and can be constant over years - long timescales ( crummy 2006 ) . by jointly analyzing spectra from different time or flux intervals in a given agn",
    ", one can tie certain model parameters together between intervals if they are not expected to vary during or between observations , while leaving the other model parameters free to vary .",
    "doing so effectively increases the s /",
    "n of the data and yields more accurate constraints on slowly- or non - varying parameters of these systems ( e.g. , black hole spin , disk inclination , iron abundance ) .",
    "time - resolved spectroscopy is particularly useful for disentangling the effects of complex absorption from the properties of the continuum and inner disk reflection , because the majority of agn show evidence for warm absorption in their spectra .",
    "some researchers have even proposed that , in many agn with purported broad fe k@xmath29 lines , these apparent reflection features are actually artifacts of improperly modeled absorption .",
    "for example , miller , turner & reeves ( e.g. , 2008 , 2009 ; mtr ) argue that the archetypal broad iron line agn , mcg6 - 30 - 15 , actually shows no relativistic inner disk reflection , but instead has five layers ( or `` zones '' ) of absorbing gas covering a wide range in column density , ionization parameter and covering fraction .",
    "the superposition of spectral features created by these absorbing structures mimics the appearance of relativistic reflection features .",
    "the mtr absorber s incorporation of partial covering , especially , is what allows the model to achieve a goodness - of - fit comparable to that of the relativistic reflection model , which does include complex absorption , but with fewer zones .",
    "the debate is ongoing regarding which model is a more plausible physical representation of the system , and a combination of a broad spectral bandpass and time - resolved and/or multi - epoch spectral analysis are needed to definitively address this question ( see  5 ) . when viewed holistically in this manner , the relativistic reflection model ( e.g. , that of br06 , miniutti 2007 and chiang & fabian 2011 ) will vary in ways that have no analog in the mtr absorber model , and vice versa .    in the following sections ,",
    "i describe the practicalities of using the relativistic reflection model ( employing a reflionx disk reflection model and either a kerrconv or relconv smearing algorithm ) to measure the spins of the smbhs in three well - known agn using _ xmm - newton , chandra _ and _ suzaku _ observations : mcg6 - 30 - 15 , ngc  3783 and fairall  9 .",

    "a weak soft excess is evident below @xmath73 .",
    "the goal in modeling the spectrum over the entire energy range is to achieve the best possible statistical fit with the lowest possible number of parameters using a physically self - consistent approach .",
    "cf11 assumed that the basic components of the fit are the same as those seen in all other type 1 agn , as described in  3.2 : power - law continuum , distant and inner disk reflection , complex absorption and a soft excess .",
    "no _ a priori _ constraints were placed on the physical nature of the soft excess emission , as this is still a topic of debate within the community and may vary among agn .",

    "cf11 modeled the spectra from _",
    "chandra , xmm+bepposax _ and _ suzaku _ accordingly , beginning with the power - law continuum modified by galactic photoabsorption and progressively adding new components as warranted by an improvement in the fit statistic .",
    "absorption modifies an entire spectrum in a multiplicative sense ( @xmath75 , where @xmath76 is the optical depth of the absorbing gas ) , meaning that it can affect the shape of the overall spectrum across a significant fraction of the energy band . as such",
    ", the absorption should be addressed early during modeling because it will have a significant effect on the parameters of the continuum ( most notably the slope of the power - law ) . cf11",
    "employ xstar tables to model the multi - zone warm absorber in mcg6 - 30 - 15 , allowing the column density and ionization to be free parameters in the fit .",
    "primarily informed by the high - resolution _",
    "chandra_/hetg data , the authors find that three zones of ionized absorbing gas intrinsic to the agn are required to properly model its spectral curvature .    to illustrate that these three absorption components are both necessary and sufficient , cf11 consider difference spectra created by subtracting the spectrum of the low - flux state of the source from that of the high - flux state of the source in each observation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : chiang_diff ] ) .",
    "although examining a difference spectrum is a common technique used to assess the contribution of additive components ( e.g. , individual emission lines ) to a spectrum at difference times , the multiplicative components ( e.g. , absorption ) also manifest because they can not be subtracted out .",
    "the difference spectra drawn from the three satellites are shown here as a ratio to a simple power - law model modified by galactic absorption .",
    "they are remarkably similar at energies below @xmath77 . an obvious drop below @xmath78",
    "is seen and goes to nearly the same depth in all difference spectra .",
    "this suggests that the low energy spectra can be represented by the same model , and that the warm absorber does not change significantly between the three observations .",
    "the @xmath79 ( @xmath80 for _ chandra _ ) difference spectra can be fitted by a simple power - law , implying that the warm absorber causes little curvature above @xmath77 and that the ( additive ) reflection signatures are largely unchanged between epochs .",
    "the warm absorber does not appear to mimic the red wing structure seen in the fe k band , nor the excess emission seen at higher energies that is commonly attributed to the compton hump also produced by reflection .",
    "this contrasts with the model suggested by miller ( 2008 , 2009 ) which incorporates two additional partial - covering clumpy absorbing zones to model the high - energy spectrum , in particular .",
    "one of these zones mimicked the shape of broadened fe k@xmath29 line , and the other partially covered the continuum in order to explain the hard excess .",
    "the main difference between the absorption - only model and the reflection - dominated model is that the former has no distortions due to relativistic effects .",
    "miller ( 2009 ) have claimed that the reflection model fails to interpret the hard excess .",
    "however , cf11 showed that the hard excess can be simply explained by a relativistically blurred reflection component of super - solar iron abundance _ without _ any additional , partial - covering absorption .",
    "however , it should be noted that , though the miller model does not address the difference spectra of mcg6 - 30 - 15 , both the reflection and absorption - only models do provide adequate fits to the spectrum and variability seen in mcg6 - 30 - 15 in these data .    within the framework of the reflection model , both distant and inner disk reflection components",
    "must be included in order to accurately model the spectrum of mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "cf11 parametrize these features with two reflionx models , convolving the inner disk component with a kdblur smearing kernel analogous to the laor relativistic line profile ( i.e. , spin fixed at @xmath39 ) while leaving the distant reflionx component unsmeared .",
    "though it is not possible to formally constrain black hole spin using the approach these authors have chosen , the measurement of the inner disk radius obtained via this method can provide some insight into the magnitude and direction of the black hole s angular momentum .",
    "the best fit obtained is @xmath81 for _ xmm+bepposax _ , @xmath82 for _ chandra _ and @xmath83 for _ suzaku_. in each case , the good quality of the fit is a strong indication that a rapidly - spinning , prograde black hole resides in mcg6 - 30 - 15 .",
    "this is confirmed by the constraints placed on the inner edge of the disk , particularly in the _ xmm - newton _ observation , which has the highest s / n in the fe k band : @xmath84 .",
    "this equates to a spin of @xmath85 , entirely consistent with the results of br06 and miniutti ( 2007 ) .",
    "the reflectors are both approximately neutral , with a measured iron abundance of @xmath86 and a disk inclination angle of @xmath87 to the line of sight .",
    "the soft excess is represented adequately by the inner disk reflector in the cf11 model , so no additional spectral component is required .",
    "the best - fitting model to all three datasets is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiang_best ] , while the best - fitting model components are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : chiang_best_eemo ] .",
    "even if we assume that the reflection - dominated model is the most physically realistic explanation for the spectrum and variability of mcg6 - 30 - 15 , controversy over the derived reflection parameters remains .",
    "patrick ( 2011 ; hereafter p11 ) employ a very similar spectral model to cf11 with a three - zone warm absorber , power - law continuum and both distant and inner disk reflection , yet their measured spin parameter is @xmath88 , more than a @xmath89 off the value measured by br06 and miniutti ( 2007 ) .",
    "however , p11 also model the soft excess with a comptt component that is assumed from the start of their modeling , rather than fitted as a remaining residual after the continuum , absorption and reflection have been accounted for .",
    "this comptt component has a modest temperature , optical depth and flux , in keeping with the modest strength of the soft excess in this source ( @xmath90 , @xmath91 , @xmath92 ) .",
    "another , and perhaps more critical difference of the p11 model from that of cf11 is in the construction of the warm absorber tables . cf11 use iterative fitting to determine the turbulent velocities of the three warm absorption zones : @xmath93 for two zones , @xmath94 for the remaining zone .",
    "p11 , by contrast , keep the turbulent velocity of the two low - ionization zones at @xmath95 and fix that of the high - ionization zone to @xmath96 .",
    "additionally , cf11 allow the iron abundance of the warm absorber to vary ( tying it to that of the distant and inner disk reflector ) , whereas p11 fix the iron abundance at the solar value .",
    "these two differences have significant effects on the appearance of the warm absorber , giving it broader spectral lines and requiring higher column densities to model iron features than would be required if super - solar iron abundance were allowed ( as found in cf11 , using _",
    "chandra_/hetg data ) .",
    "these differences are likely responsible for the different column densities and ionizations measured for the warm absorber zones by the two groups .",
    "finally , p11 employ an additional neutral , high column , partial - covering absorber to account for a hard excess above @xmath68 above the dual reflector model .",
    "this absorber has @xmath97 and @xmath98 .",
    "no such additional absorber is needed in the cf11 analysis ; the hard excess is well accounted for by the super - solar iron abundance allowed in the cf11 absorber tables .",
    "the low - ionization absorber of p11 possesses much more curvature up into the fe k band , while the partial - covering absorber takes up the hard excess emission that would otherwise be modeled by the compton hump in the cf11 model .",
    "this combination results in the lower spin derived by p11 .    disregarding the ongoing debate about",
    "which model is a more physical representation of the system , the fact remains that a good statistical fit to the spectral data can be achieved by the reflection - dominated model of br06 and cf11 , the absorption - only model of miller ( 2008 , 2009 ) and the `` hybrid '' model of p11 that combines features of both .",
    "breaking the degeneracy between these models will require high s / n over a broad bandpass in x - rays , and good spectral resolution over the @xmath99 range , especially in the fe k band ( i.e. , @xmath100 resolution at @xmath101 ) .",
    "these capabilities will enable the continuum , absorption , reflection and any remaining soft or hard excess emission to be accurately and simultaneously characterized based on their discrete and broad - band features .",
    "the recently launched _",

    "these parameters remained consistent , within errors , when energies @xmath124 were ignored in the fit , negating the importance of the soft excess emission in driving the fit to these parameter values .",
    "the results of b11 were corroborated by reis ( 2012 ) , who examined the temporal and spectral variability of ngc  3783 within the _ suzaku _ observation , and by reynolds ( 2012 , hereafter r12 ) , who re - examined the time - averaged data using a markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) analysis to more closely probe the total available parameter space .",
    "these authors especially noted the robustness of the rapid black hole spin and super - solar iron abundance found by b11 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : mcmc ] ) .",
    "the variability analysis of reis revealed that the spectrum is principally composed of two elements : a variable soft component and a quasi - constant hard component , similar in nature to that expected from reflection arising from the inner parts of an accretion disk .",
    "further , difference spectra between different flux states during the observation are all well fit by a simple power - law , suggesting that the well - known warm absorber in this source is not variable during the observation and that the variability is due to changes in the power - law continuum flux .",
    "an excess of flux appears at energies @xmath109 in the later stages of the observation .",
    "this excess was shown to vary with time but not source flux , and can be effectively accounted for by changes in the reflection strength and/or ionization of the inner disk during the observation .",
    "however , p11 analyzed the same data separately and reached a strikingly different conclusion regarding the spin of the black hole in ngc  3783 : @xmath125 .",
    "this discrepancy illustrates the importance of assumptions and modeling choices in influencing the derived black hole spin and other physical properties of the black hole / disk system .",
    "p11 made three critical assumptions that differed from b11 : ( 1 ) that the iron abundance of the inner disk is fixed to the solar value ; ( 2 ) that the warm absorber has a high - turbulence ( @xmath126 km / s ) , high - ionization ( @xmath127 ) component not reported by b11 ; ( 3 ) that the soft excess originates entirely through comptonization , with the comptonizing medium at a temperature of @xmath128 and an optical depth of @xmath129 .",
    "reynolds ( 2012 ) demonstrated that fixing the iron abundance at the solar value significantly worsens the global goodness - of - fit in ngc  3783 when compared with allowing the iron abundance of the inner disk to fit freely ( @xmath130 ) .",
    "b11 found no need to include a high - turbulence component in their fit to the _ suzaku _ data , and noted no evidence for such a component in the higher - resolution 2001 _ chandra_/hetg data .",
    "finally , r12 note that there is no physical reason to assume that the soft excess originates entirely from comptonization processes , as other processes within the agn might contribute ( e.g. , photoionized emission , scattering , thermal emission ) .",
    "r12 attempted several different model fits to the soft excess and found not only a much smaller contribution to the overall model for the soft excess component than p11 , but also no statistical difference between fits using different models ( e.g. , blackbody vs. comptt ) .",
    "it should be noted , however , that modeling the soft excess with a comptonization component of high temperature , high optical depth and high flux , as p11 have done , requires the comptt component to possess significant curvature up into the fe k band , reducing the need for the relativistic reflector to account for this same curvature seen in the data and thereby eliminating the requirement of high black hole spin .",
    "to illustrate this , see fig .",
    "[ fig : eemodel_patrick ] for a plot of the relative importance of the best - fit model components in the p11 analysis , as compared with fig .",
    "[ fig : eemodel ] for b11 .",
    "clearly , different modeling approaches can lead to vastly different conclusions regarding black hole spin and careful consideration should be given to the models used and to their allowed parameter ranges .",
    "degeneracies between model parameters can also be a factor and should be carefully considered .",
    "for example , r12 discuss the positive correlation between black hole spin and iron abundance found through their mcmc analysis of ngc  3783 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : a - z_correl ] ) .",
    "both have high values as preferred in the best - fit model , and because increasing the amount of iron in the disk will increase the strength of the reflection features , a rapid spin is required in order to smooth those features out enough to produce an adequate fit to the spectrum .",
    "r12 note a worsening of the fit when a fixed , solar iron abundance is adopted , however , lending credence to the super - solar abundance measured .    one possible explanation for the overabundance of iron detected in ngc  3783 and other agn ( e.g. , ngc 1365 , walton 2010 ; 1h0707 - 495 , zoghbi 2010 ) is radiative levitation .",
    "previously discussed in the context of surface abundances of white dwarfs ( chayer , fontaine & wesemael 1995 , seaton 1996 , wassermann et al . 2010 ) , r12 applied the concept to agn accretion disks for the first time . because disks are radiation - pressure dominated in their central regions and",
    "can also possess fairly low ionization states of iron ( fexvii and below ) that have populated l- and m - shells , the radiation pressure acting on these heavy metal ions can be much stronger than that acting on the surrounding , fully - ionized plasma . this outward force can also greatly exceed that of gravity , causing the preferential upward drift of iron ions to the disk surface , resulting in an enhancement of iron relative to other elements in the disk atmosphere .              as we have seen in the cases of mcg6 - 30 - 15 and ngc  3783 , spectral complexities like ionized absorption intrinsic to the agn can confuse our interpretation of the spectrum .",
    "the presence of such components can significantly affect the derived physical parameters of the system , such as black hole spin .",
    "it would therefore be ideal to fit relativistic reflection models to a cleaner agn system without warm absorption as a kind of control case .",
    "there exists a small sample of type 1 agn , known as `` bare '' seyferts , which seem to lack any observable signatures of significant intrinsic absorption in x - rays .",
    "while most of these objects do display a soft excess , usually the flux of this component is substantially smaller than that seen in ngc  3783 , so the exact model used to parametrize it will have a negligible effect on the spectrum in the fe k band and will not compromise the spin measured from the broad fe k@xmath29 line and compton hump .",
    "fairall  9 is one such bright , nearby ( @xmath131 ) , `` bare '' seyfert with over @xmath132 of data in the _ xmm - newton _ archive and nearly @xmath133 in the _ suzaku _ archive .",
    "though a spectral analysis of the _ xmm - newton _ data incorporating relativistic reflection features was reported in brenneman & reynolds ( 2009 ) , the first reported spin measurement for this agn was published by schmoll ( 2009 ) using a @xmath134 _ suzaku _ observation from 2007 .",

    ". these authors also detect the ionized emission from fexxv and fexxvi , choosing to parametrize the lines with individual gaussians rather than a photoionized emission model as per l12 .",
    "there is no clear evidence to either support or disprove the presence of the neutral absorber , which is not reported in any other work on fairall  9 , but it is not necessary to include this component in order to achieve a good fit : the @xmath152 of p11 is comparable to that of l12 . it should also be noted that p11 choose to fix the iron abundance of fairall  9 at @xmath153 , contrary to their approach for the other four agn in their sample which have @xmath154 .",
    "the comptt soft excess used by p11 has a modest flux and optical depth , with @xmath155 and @xmath156 , but the upper limit on its temperature is quite high : @xmath157 .",
    "this large temperature pushes the influence of this component almost into the fe k band , possibly interfering with the measurement of the red wing of the broad fe k@xmath29 line by the kerrconv inner disk reflection model . adopting these assumptions",
    ", the authors can not constrain the spin of the smbh in fairall  9 using the dual reflector model , though they do achieve constraints using a more phenomenological approach by modeling the broad fe k@xmath29 line alone with a kerrdisk component : @xmath158 .",
    "a similar approach was adopted by l12 to examine modeling degeneracies in the soft excess ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : f9_eemo ] ) . comparing the l12 and",
    "p11 models fit to the _ suzaku _ data , the addition of the comptt component ( here with comparable optical depth , but higher temperature : @xmath159 ) drives the iron abundance of the inner disk to a much higher value : @xmath160 .",
    "the ionization of the inner disk is also much smaller ( @xmath161 ) , since the inner disk no longer has to account for the soft excess emission on its own .",
    "the inclination angle of the disk rises to @xmath162 , while the spin of the black hole drops to @xmath163 .        in order to constrain the proper physical components of the spectrum",
    ", we must await the high s / n achievable by _ nustar _ , which will be able to differentiate between the comptt ( p11 ) and reflection - only ( l12 ) models for the first time ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : f9_nustar ] ) . given the differences between the various modeling approaches used in l12 and p11",
    ", however , it is somewhat surprising that the spin constraints achieved in each case are consistent , within errors .",
    "this could be an indication that the presence of warm absorption is the greatest complicating factor in measuring spin , due to the curvature it induces in the spectrum interfering with the isolation of the red wing of the broad fe k@xmath29 line .",
    "alternatively ( or perhaps in addition to this point ) , the nature of the spin parameter space could be playing a role in the similarity of the two measurements . as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : isco ] , the shape of the function relating spin to the isco radius changes quite slowly in nearly linearly at moderate spin values below @xmath164 , but changes much more rapidly above @xmath165 .",
    "therefore , differentiating between a spin of , e.g. , @xmath166 and @xmath167 is much more challenging , statistically , then differentiating between spins of @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "this point was discussed at some length in walton ( 2013 ; w13 ) as the authors analyzed the x - ray spectra of 25 `` bare '' seyfert agn with _ suzaku _ , specifically to avoid the spectral complexities introduced by the presence of warm absorbing gas along the line of sight to the nucleus .",
    "in contrast to patrick ( 2012 ; p12 ) , in which a comptonized soft excess is assumed for the best fit to six bare seyferts , w13 do not employ a separate model component for the soft excess , but rather allow it to be fit by the inner disk reflector .",
    "of the five sources common to both the w13 and p12 samples , consistent spin measurements ( within errors ) were found for mrk  335 and ark  120 , but not for fairall  9 , mcg2 - 14 - 9 or ngc  7469 . the sixth source from p12 , swift  j2127.4 + 5654 ,",
    "was not considered in the w13 sample , but the spin derived in p12 is consistent with that measured by miniutti ( 2009a ) , who employed a reflection modeling scheme for the soft excess similar to w13 .",
    "the model used to parametrize the soft excess has a noticeable impact on the derived spins in half of the small sample of p12 bare seyferts , then , underscoring the importance of establishing the correct form of this spectral component .",
    "it is also interesting to note , however , that the three sources with consistent spin measurements in spite of modeling differences all have spins of @xmath170 , in keeping with the importance of the shape of the spin parameter space .",
    "in previous sections we have noted the importance of both adequate data ( i.e. , high s / n ) and a physically self - consistent modeling approach to constraining smbh spins in agn . we have also stressed the importance of one very critical assumption that must be made in order to calculate black hole spin : namely , that the inner edge of the accretion disk truncates at the isco .",
    "if the optically - thick disk is truncated further out , then any spin derived using this assumption and the reflection modeling technique will be a lower limit .",
    "such truncated disks may reside in radio - loud agn ; a disruption of the inner accretion flow ( using dips in the x - ray light curve as a proxy ) is thought to coincide roughly with the ejection of new `` knots '' of plasma into the radio jet ( as observed in vlbi data ) .",
    "this behavior has been noted previous in , e.g. , 3c  120 ( marscher 2002 ) and 3c  111 ( kataoka 2007 ) . by contrast , if there is significant emission produced inside the isco , this will lead to a systematic error on the black hole spin measurement obtained via the reflection method that can be @xmath171 above the actual value of spin for non - spinning or retrograde black holes , but is @xmath172 higher than the real spin for black holes with spins @xmath173 ( reynolds & fabian 2008 ) .    the models currently used to represent both the accretion disk and the relativistic smearing also have their inherent limitations and uncertainties .",
    "the reflionx and xillver models both assume that the disk is thin and can be well - approximated by a novikov - thorne formalism .",
    "this is still an active topic of debate : disk thickness ( e.g. , penna 2010 , noble 2011 ) and disk warping ( e.g. , fragile & anninos 2005 ) at small radii can have a substantial impact on measurements of black hole spin .",
    "the current models also assume that the disk has a constant density and ionization structure throughout , which can not be the case , physically . portraying them as such is a necessary simplification , computationally , and",
    "it is unclear whether even the highest - quality data can differentiate between these simplified assumptions and more complex models that have density and ionization varying as a function of radius and/or depth in the disk .",
    "there is also some question about whether a limb - brightening vs. limb - darkening algorithm should be used to represent the directionality of the reflected emission from the disk when convolved with the smearing kernel ( svoboda 2010 ) .",
    "the nature of the disk emissivity profile itself is also an active topic of research ; though the disk is thought to dissipate energy as a function of radius ( @xmath174 ) , the emissivity index likely varies as a function of radius as well ( wilkins & fabian 2011 ) .",
    "the directionality of the coronal emission irradiating the disk also impacts the observed reflection spectrum .",
    "if the coronal photons reflected back onto the disk are produced from a compact , localized spot near the black hole spin axis and close to the disk surface , light bending effects will focus the coronal emission preferentially toward the center of the disk , resulting in an apparent enhancement of the disk emissivity at small radii ( corresponding to @xmath175 ) . the degree to which the emission is centrally concentrated in this scenario",
    "depends on the height @xmath176 of the coronal active region above the disk ( e.g. , miniutti & fabian 2004 , dauser 2013 ) .",
    "we currently lack the ability to characterize the physical properties of the corona in a given agn , however , which limits our ability to understand disk irradiation and emissivity independently .    finally ,",
    "when multiple detectors are involved in collecting the data used to measure black hole spin , the cross - calibration uncertainty between detectors can also contribute to the systematic error on the spin constraint .",
    "given the need for high - s / n spectra across a wide bandpass in x - rays , the use of multiple detectors is increasingly necessary in order to achieve a reliable spin measurement .",
    "for example , b11 and w13 discuss how uncertainty in the cross - calibration between the _ suzaku_/xis and pin instruments can affect constraints on spin in ngc  3783 and a sample of 25 bare seyfert agn , respectively .",
    "the _ nustar _ mission , too , is currently working to improve the calibration between its two identical focal plane detectors , as well as its cross - calibration with the instruments on both _ xmm - newton _ and _",
    "suzaku_.      taking all the caveats of  [ sec : systematics ] into account , one can begin to appreciate the challenge involved in obtaining precise , accurate spin constraints , and the limitations of our sample size to bright , nearby agn that are relatively unobscured .",
    "for these reasons , there are currently only 22 agn with robust , published constraints for their smbh spins .",
    "here , i have defined a `` robust '' constraint in a manner similar to that of reynolds ( 2013 ) , requiring that all other parameters of the accretion disk be left free to vary during the fit ( i.e. , the disk inclination angle , iron abundance and emissivity index , which must be itself constrained to @xmath177 in order for the majority of the x - ray reflection to originate in the inner disk ) .",
    "the spins presented here meet these criteria and are single - valued .",
    "these agn , and their properties , are listed in table  1 , and the histogram of spin values is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin_dist ] .    .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]         while it is difficult to draw any robust statistical inferences from a sample size of 22 objects , the trend toward higher spin values is obvious , even considering that systematic error ( which can lower measured spins as described above in  [ sec : systematics ] ) is not taken into account in the uncertainties quoted here",
    ". there may be selection biases in play which may make it more likely that we measure higher spin values : agn whose disks extend down closer to the event horizon ( i.e. , those with large , prograde smbh spins ) accrete more efficiently than those whose disks truncate farther from the smbh , provided that the disks in question conform to standard thin - disk profiles ( e.g. , novikov - thorne ) .",
    "as such , an accreting , rapidly spinning black hole will be more luminous than an accreting , slowing spinning black hole and hence will be over - represented in flux - limited samples ( b11 ) .",
    "the nature of the spin parameter space may also be playing a role here , as discussed in w13 : because of the rapid change in the shape of the spin function vs. the isco radius at large prograde spin values , it is easier to constrain spins with greater precision and accuracy when they have spin values closer to @xmath178 .",
    "nonetheless , the pattern that is most readily apparent in table  1 is that 15/22 agn have relatively high , prograde smbh spins ( @xmath179 ) , and no retrograde spins have conclusively been measured ( although the 90% confidence lower bound on the spin of the smbh in of mrk  1018 allows for retrograde spin ) .",
    "cowperthwaite & reynolds ( 2012 ) previously published a spin constraint of @xmath180 for 3c  120 , but by taking multi - epoch , multi - wavelength data and the latest _",
    "calibrations into account , lohfink ( 2013 ) have revised this measurement to @xmath181 .",
    "3c  120 is the one radio - loud galaxy with a measured spin in the current sample , and is thus of great interest in terms of probing the connection between black hole spin and jet production .",
    "garofalo ( 2009 ) postulated that jet power is maximized for rapidly - rotating retrograde black holes , though this idea is not without controversy ( e.g. , tchekhovskoy & mckinney 2011 ) .",
    "more work needs to be done to constrain black hole spin and jet power independently from observations in order to prove or disprove this conjecture , and to place the rapid prograde spin measured for 3c  120 in context with smbh spins and jet luminosities for other radio - loud agn .",
    "it is worth noting , however , that even the modest distribution in spin values seen in table  [ tab : table2 ] implies that black hole spin can not be the primary driver in determining whether an agn possesses a relativistic jet .",
    "narayan & mcclintock ( 2012 ) and steiner ( 2012 ) demonstrate two examples of the beginnings of such research in microquasars .",
    "these authors report a correlation between jet power and spin ( @xmath182 ) in a sample of five stellar - mass black holes , as expected based on the theoretical work of blandford & znajek ( 1977 ) .",
    "there is some disagreement about this finding , however ( e.g. , see fender , gallo & russell 2010 ) , largely centered on how the jet power is measured .",
    "daly ( 2011 ) , meanwhile , has made a first effort at measuring smbh spins in 55 radio - loud agn , finding a distribution with an average close to @xmath183 , but with large uncertainties on the individual spin values .",
    "precise measurements of agn jet magnetic fields are necessary in order to definitively constrain the smbh spins in these sources , however , and a @xmath184 relation is assumed _ a priori _ in the work .",
    "if the trend toward large prograde spins continues to hold as our sample size increases , we might ultimately infer that the growth of bright , nearby agn in recent epochs has been driven primarily by prolonged , prograde accretion of gas .",
    "if the overall distribution of smbh spins in the local universe begins to drift toward intermediate values , it is likely that the role of mergers has been more significant than that of ordered gas accretion .",
    "similarly , if the distribution tends toward low values of spin , we can infer that episodes of randomly - oriented accretion have been the dominant means of smbh and galaxy growth ( berti & volonteri 2008 ; see fig .",
    "[ fig : bv08 ] ) .",
    "reynolds ( 2013 ) further note that both the most and least massive smbhs in table  [ tab : table2 ] seem to have more moderate spin values than their rapidly - spinning counterparts in the middle of the mass range .",
    "if this trend continues as the sample size of measured smbh spins grows , it would provide direct evidence for the increased role of chaotic accretion and/or major mergers at these two extreme ends of the smbh mass spectrum .",
    "measuring black hole spin is painstaking work , even with the best data from current observatory - class missions such as _ xmm - newton _ , _ suzaku _ and _ chandra_. long observations ( @xmath44hundreds of kiloseconds ) of bright agn are needed , and multi - epoch , multi - instrument data should be analyzed jointly whenever possible in order to assess the physical nature and variability of all of the components in a given x - ray spectrum , knowing that the spin value will not change over human timescales .",
    "high s / n across a broad energy range is also desirable in order to constrain the properties of the continuum and complex absorption , particularly , and to distinguish these components from any signatures of inner disk reflection . only by isolating the broad fe k@xmath29 line and its associated compton hump",
    "can we measure black hole spin with the accuracy and precision necessary to begin constructing a spin distribution for local agn .",
    "we can then begin to draw inferences regarding the dominant growth mechanism of these smbhs over cosmic time , and to understand the role of spin in jet production and agn feedback .",
    "our current sample of 22 agn with measured , published smbh spins must be extended in order to accomplish these goals .",
    "the _ suzaku _",
    "spin survey has recently been completed , and is providing rich legacy datasets that will benefit this science for years to come .",
    "additionally , many datasets from the _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ archives have recently been analyzed with an eye toward measuring spin ( e.g. , p11 , p12 , w13 ) .",
    "_ nustar _ will also play a vital role in this science , providing an invaluable high - energy ( @xmath185 ) complement to _ xmm - newton _ and _ suzaku _ spectra , particularly , when used simultaneously with either observatory .",
    "this high - energy capability will improve the accuracy of black hole spin measurements , and will also enable improvements in precision in these measurements by up to a factor of ten in some sources ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : mcg6_spin ] ) .",
    "_ astro - h _ , scheduled for launch in 2015 , will bring the science of micro - calorimetry to x - ray astronomy with a spectral resolution of @xmath186 over the @xmath60 range .",
    "though the observatory will also fly a high - energy detector capable of producing spectra up to @xmath187 , the calorimeter will be the unique strength of this mission , enabling the broad and narrow fe k emission and absorption features to be definitively disentangled and the telltale signatures of complex intrinsic absorption to be identified and modeled correctly .    in order to achieve the order of magnitude increase in sample size necessary to begin assessing the spin distribution of smbhs in the local universe from a statistical perspective , future large - area ( @xmath188 ) x - ray observatories are needed .",
    "proposed concepts such as _ ixo / axsio _ ( white 2010 ) , _ athena _ ( barcons 2012 ) and the _ extreme physics explorer ( epe ) _ ( garcia et al .",
    "2011 ) would all offer the necessary collecting area and superior spectral resolution , allowing us to extend our sample of measured smbh spins to several hundred agn using the reflection modeling method .",
    "additionally , such large - area observatories will also enable the orbits of distinct `` blobs '' or `` hot spots '' of material within the accretion disk to be measured via the periodicity of their emission , allowing velocity to be charted as a function of radius within the disk for tens of agn .",
    "such measurements would provide an independent check on the spin value obtained from spectral fitting of the inner disk reflection signatures averaged over many orbits , and would also yield important constraints on black hole masses as well .",
    "the large observatory for timing ( _ loft _ ; feroci 2012 ) is a proposed concept that , if funded , would provide the necessary effective area ( @xmath189 ) to achieve this goal , coupled with moderate spectral resolution ( @xmath190 ) across a reasonably broad bandpass ( @xmath191 ) .",
    "as discussed in reynolds ( 2013 ) , _ loft _ would also revolutionize the science of relativistic reverbertion mapping , in which the lag time is measured between variations in the continuum emission from the corona and variations in the response of the observed x - ray reflection from the inner accretion disk .",
    "the full , energy - dependent transfer function relating the changes in these two x - ray spectral signatures encodes the spin of the black hole , among other physical information about the inner accretion flow ( zoghbi & fabian 2011 , de marco 2011 , fabian 2012b , kara 2013 ) .",
    "having an instrument such as _ loft _ at our disposal would thus provide two more methods to use in determining black hole spins .",
    "the science of measuring the angular momenta of black holes is in its infancy .",
    "though the past decade has seen great strides in our ability to constrain spin through long x - ray observations coupled with detailed spectral modeling , much work remains to be done in terms of improving the precision and accuracy of these measurements , as well as the sample size .",
    "the next decade will see an improvement in the quality of black hole spin science , but a significant advance in the quantity of this work in the decades beyond will depend critically on the amount of funding available to facilitate the international collaborations necessary to build large - area x - ray spectroscopy missions , or on advances in technology development that will allow such a large - area x - ray spectroscopic mission to be flown for a fraction of the current cost .",
    "at the time of this writing , the _ nustar _",
    "x - ray observatory is undertaking an ambitious campaign to observe several agn simultaneously with either _ xmm - newton _ or _",

    "<S> measuring the spins of supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in active galactic nuclei ( agn ) can inform us about the relative role of gas accretion vs. mergers in recent epochs of the life of the host galaxy and its agn . </S>",
    "<S> recent advances in theory and observation have enabled spin measurements for a handful of smbhs thus far , but this science is still very much in its infancy . </S>",
    "<S> herein , i discuss how and why we seek to measure black hole spin in agn , using recent results from long x - ray observing campaigns on three radio - quiet agn ( mcg6 - 30 - 15 , ngc  3783 and fairall  9 ) to illustrate this process and its caveats . </S>",
    "<S> i then present our current knowledge of the distribution of smbh spins in the local universe . </S>",
    "<S> i also address prospects for improving the accuracy , precision and quantity of these spin constraints in the next decade and beyond with instruments such as _ nustar , astro - h _ and a future generation large - area x - ray telescope . </S>"
