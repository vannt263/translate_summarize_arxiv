    "a great deal of astronomical evidence suggests that approximately 25% of the energy density of the universe today is composed of cold , non - baryonic `` dark matter '' ( dm ) @xcite . amongst the plethora of dark matter candidates , thermal relic particles with self - annihilation cross sections set by the electroweak scale",
    "are thought to be well motivated as they can lead naturally to the observed abundance and because the hierarchy problem suggests that we expect new physics to show up at the energy scale .",
    "direct detection experiments aim to detect such particles via the nuclear recoils caused by their elastic scattering off nuclei @xcite .    in the near future",
    ", the target masses of dm detectors will be increased to the ton - scale @xcite , and neutrino - nucleon scattering from solar neutrinos will become detectable @xcite .",
    "this can be viewed as a positive development , potentially shedding light on new aspects of solar physics and neutrino physics beyond the standard model @xcite .",
    "however it is a hindrance to the potential detection of light dark matter because these solar neutrinos act as a background which produce signals very similar to dark matter candidates . in recent years , several strategies",
    "have been suggested to distinguish between neutrino and dark matter signals .",
    "these involve directional detectors @xcite , annual modulation of both the dark matter and solar neutrinos signals @xcite , data combination from detectors composed of different target materials @xcite , and detectors with improved energy resolution @xcite .    in this work we present another strategy , that of a polarised helium-3 target where the cross section for neutrino scattering is a strong function of the angle between the neutrino momentum and the axis of polarisation . assuming the detector is not close to a reactor , most low energy background neutrinos come from the sun .",
    "we analyse the dependence of the neutrino signal distribution to the orientation of the incoming neutrinos in a polarised detector and use it to reduce this background .",
    "a standard model neutrino is thought to scatter simultaneously off all nucleons in a nucleus in phase when the wavelength of the momentum transfer is larger than the radius of the target nucleus .",
    "this coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering leads to a cross section enhanced by a factor of @xmath0 ^ 2 $ ] , where @xmath1 and @xmath2 are the number of target neutrons and protons respectively , and @xmath3 is the weak mixing angle @xcite . this process has never been observed in standard neutrino detectors due to to the tiny cross section and very low nuclear recoil energies",
    ". the coherent nature of the interaction depends upon the vectorial @xmath4 part of the @xmath5 standard model coupling .",
    "the axial @xmath6 part also leads to a scattering upon any net spin of the nucleus , but this will not be coherently enhanced since in general there will be only one unpaired nucleon .",
    "for a target like xenon for example , the axial coupling will give rise to a much smaller spin - dependent cross - section than the coherent spin - independent cross section arising from the vector current .",
    "the maximum recoil kinetic energy in coherent neutrino - nucleus scattering is @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the incident neutrino energy , and @xmath9 is the mass of the target nucleus .",
    "the three - momentum exchange is related to the recoil energy by @xmath10 . for neutrino energies below 20 mev and nuclear targets from @xmath11he to @xmath12xe , the maximum recoil energy ranges between 280 kev and 6 kev , meaning that the maximum possible @xmath13 is quite small , @xmath14 .",
    "typical nuclear radii , @xmath15 , are 3 - 5 fm , then the product @xmath16 . in this regime , the neutrino scatters coherently off the nucleus .",
    "the most important contribution to the neutrino flux in the lowest energy range capable of giving a detectable nuclear recoil ( around a kev ) comes from the various nuclear fusion and decay processes occurring in the sun . for this work ,",
    "we consider only the fluxes of solar neutrinos .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos and neutrinos from the diffuse supernova background are produced at higher energies and with much lower rates , only being detectable in future multi - ton detectors .    in figure",
    "[ fig : fluxes ] we show the solar neutrino fluxes .",
    "the grey coloured fluxes will not give events above the thresholds considered in this paper .",
    "solar neutrinos produced in the proton - proton chain are in orange , while those produced in the cno cycle are in red .",
    "the differential cross section for a neutrino scattering off a polarised nucleon is    @xmath17-(p^{\\prime}s)[(pp_n)-(pp_n^{\\prime})]\\big]\\\\&-m_n^2(pp^{\\prime})\\big\\}+c_a^2\\big\\{(pp_n)(p^{\\prime}p_n^{\\prime})+(pp_n^{\\prime})(p^{\\prime}p_n)\\\\&-m_n\\big[(ps)[(p^{\\prime}p_n)+(p^{\\prime}p_n^{\\prime})]-(p^{\\prime}s)[(pp_n)+(pp_n^{\\prime})]\\big]\\\\&+m_n^2(pp^{\\prime})\\big\\}+2c_vc_a\\big\\{(pp_n)(p^{\\prime}p_n^{\\prime})-(pp_n^{\\prime})(p^{\\prime}p_n)\\\\&-m_n\\big[(ps)(p^{\\prime}p_n^{\\prime})+(p^{\\prime}s)(pp_n^{\\prime})\\big]\\big\\}\\bigg\\}. \\end{split}\\ ] ]    here @xmath18 is the fermi constant , @xmath8 is the incoming neutrino energy , @xmath19 is the outgoing neutrino energy , and @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the effective couplings .",
    "the neutrino and nucleus initial ( final ) four - momenta are respectively @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) and @xmath24 ( @xmath25 ) , and @xmath26 is the nuclear spin four - vector . in the limit of low recoil energies , this expression reduces to @xmath27\\ } , \\end{split } \\label{eq : dsdo}\\ ] ] where @xmath28 is the scattering angle in the lab frame of the outgoing neutrino with respect to the incoming neutrino direction , @xmath29 and @xmath30 are respectively the directions of the incoming and outgoing neutrinos and @xmath31 is the direction of the nuclear spin .",
    "0.49     0.49     for low - energy interactions , atomic nuclei behave , in a good approximation , as a collection of independent nucleons , which yields @xmath32 and @xmath33 for a dm - nucleus coupling , where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the effective vector and axial neutrino couplings to protons and neutrons . we take the values shown in table [ tab : couplings ] . in equation",
    "[ eq : ca ] it is assumed that the nuclear spin is solely due to the spin of the single unpaired nucleon .    .effective neutral - current couplings . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "for dark matter particles , the polarisation modulated amplitude is small because it is velocity suppressed @xcite , so the detector s orientation is largely irrelevant for those events , even though there is a preferred arrival direction for the fastest dark matter particles due to the motion of the solar system through the galaxy .    direct dark matter detection results put tight constraints on a @xmath36 with vector couplings to light quarks due to the coherent enhancement in such models .",
    "conversely , models where dark matter scattering on nuclei is spin - dependent are very weakly constrained @xcite .",
    "for such a class of models , helium-3 detectors would be more efficient than xenon - based detectors since 1 kg of helium-3 has the same number of unpaired neutrons as 90 kg of xenon .",
    "figure [ fig : exclusion ] shows the limits we expect to be able to obtain with a 100 kg helium-3 detector and an exposure of one year for an unrealistically low threshold of 0.2 kev and a perhaps more realistic one of 2 kev @xcite .",
    "the limits come from performing monte carlo simulations of distinguishing signal ( dm+neutrino ) from background ( neutrino only ) over bins of 0.2 kev width with an upper energy threshold limit of 20 kev .",
    "the addition of polarisation increases the sensitivity by nearly an order of magnitude . in the figure",
    ", we do nt assume any particular coherent enhancement between dark matter and the nuclei , any assumptions about the coupling of dark matter to nucleons which leads to such an enhancement should be added by the reader .",
    "the use of helium-3 for dark matter detection is very appealing for many reasons @xcite : being a spin 1/2 nucleus , it is sensitive to the axial interactions with wimps ; for massive wimps the maximum recoil energy depends very weakly on its mass and , therefore , is higher - bounded ( see figure [ fig : ermax ] ) ; it has a low compton cross section to @xmath37-rays reducing by several orders of magnitude the natural radioactive background ; it has no intrinsic x - rays ; the capture process @xmath38 gives a clear signal for neutron rejection ; it can be polarised and used as a target @xcite .",
    "there are two leading methods to polarise a significant amount of nuclei in gaseous helium-3 : spin - exchange optical pumping ( seop ) @xcite and metastability exchange optical pumping ( meop ) @xcite .",
    "the latter method is not well suited for our purposes because it needs very low pressure ( @xmath39 1 mbar ) , implying a huge volume for the detector . in the first method , which can operate at typical pressures of 1 - 10 bar",
    ", alkali metal vapour is polarised by optical pumping and then transfers its electronic polarisation to the helium-3 nuclei via spin - exchange collisions .",
    "originally , a pure rubidium vapor was used in this process . however , since potassium is much more efficient than rubidium at transferring its polarisation to helium-3 nuclei , hybrid mixtures of these elements are used , leading to degrees of polarisation up to 70% @xcite .",
    "in this work we looked at the neutrino floor problem for future direct dark matter searches , when neutrino backgrounds from coherent neutrino - nucleus elastic scattering are important .",
    "these neutrinos interact either via the vector or axial current , the former of which depends roughly on @xmath40 , where n is the number of neutrons , and the latter of which depends on the net spin of the nucleus .",
    "hence for lighter elements such as helium-3 the two currents , labeled spin - independent and spin - dependent respectively , are of similar size .",
    "we investigated how a polarised detector can in theory help reduce this background .",
    "we considered a detector based on helium-3 so that the spin - dependent contribution is not suppressed relative to the coherent cross section and the effect of polarisation is maximised .",
    "we showed that the neutrino - nucleus cross section has a strong dependence on the angle between the incoming neutrino for helium-3 and the nuclear spin .",
    "this property can be used in the construction of a polarised detector , which is kept at an angle that minimises the number solar neutrinos detected .",
    "such a detector operating at full polarisation would be able to rule out 98% of solar neutrino events .",
    "we showed that such discrimination could reduce the neutrino background from the sun for light dark matter by almost an order of magnitude and performed estimates of the potential performance of such a detector with and without polarisation for a realistic and an optimistic lower energy threshold .",
    "the cost of helium-3 is very high relative to other materials which are used for dark matter detection , and we are aware of the difficulties that would be encountered in setting up such an experiment in practice . the purpose of this note was to point out the nice features that such a detector would have if we were able to polarise the nuclei , especially with regards to their interactions with neutrinos .",
    "new techniques to reduce backgrounds would help in obtaining lower thresholds and thus lead to the requirement of lower target masses .",
    "such advances , perhaps combined with a continued drop in price of helium-3 , would make the realisation of such a device feasible .",
