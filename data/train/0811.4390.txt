    "a number of studies over the past ten years have estimated the inter - galactic void probability function and investigated its departure from randomness .",
    "the basic random model is that arising from a poisson process of mean density @xmath0 galaxies per unit volume in a large box . then , in a _ given region of volume _",
    "@xmath1 the probability of finding exactly @xmath2 galaxies is @xmath3 so the probability that the given region is devoid of galaxies is @xmath4 then it follows that the probability density function for the continuous random variable @xmath5 in the poisson case is @xmath6 for comparison with observations , the approximation fails for very large @xmath5 since a finite volume box is involved in any catalogue .",
    "a hierachy of @xmath7-point correlation functions needed to represent clustering of galaxies in a complete sense was devised by white  @xcite and he provided explicit formulae , including their continuous limit .",
    "in particular , he made a detailed study of the probability that a sphere of radius @xmath8 is empty and showed that formally it is symmetrically dependent on the whole hierarchy of correlation functions .",
    "however , white concentrated his applications on the case when the underlying galaxy distribution was a poisson process , the starting point for the present approach which is concerned with geometrizing the parameter space of departures from a poisson process .",
    "we choose a family of parametric statistical models that includes  ( [ negexp ] ) as a special case .",
    "there are of course many such families , but we take one that has been successful in modelling void size distributions in terrestrial stochastic porous media  @xcite and has been used in the representation of clustering of galaxies  @xcite .",
    "the family of gamma distributions has event space @xmath9 parameters @xmath10 and probability density functions given by @xmath11 then @xmath12 and @xmath13 and we see that @xmath14 controls the mean of the distribution while the spread and shape is controlled by , @xmath15 the square of the coefficient of variation .",
    "the special case @xmath16 corresponds to the situation when @xmath5 represents the random or poisson process in  ( [ negexp ] ) with @xmath17 thus , the family of gamma distributions can model a range of stochastic processes corresponding to non - independent ` clumped ' events , for @xmath18 and dispersed events , for @xmath19 as well as the random case ( cf .",
    "thus , if we think of this range of processes as corresponding to the possible distributions of centroids of extended objects such as galaxies that are initially distributed according to a poisson process with @xmath20 then the three possibilities are :    chaotic or random structure : :    with no interactions among constituents , @xmath21 clustered structure : :    arising from mutually attractive interactions , @xmath22 dispersed structure : :    arising from mutually repulsive interactions , @xmath23    figure  [ fgamma ] shows a family of gamma distributions , all of unit mean , with @xmath24    ( 300,220)(0,0 ) ( 80,0 ) ( 45,177)@xmath25 ( 125,160)@xmath26 ( 180,70)@xmath16 ( 310,50)@xmath27 ( 300,-7)void volume @xmath5    shannon s information theoretic ` entropy ' or ` uncertainty ' for such stochastic processes ( cf .",
    "jaynes  @xcite ) is given , up to a factor , by the negative of the expectation of the logarithm of the probability density function  ( [ feq ] ) , that is @xmath28 in particular , at unit mean , the maximum entropy ( or maximum uncertainty ) occurs at @xmath20 which is the random case , and then @xmath29    the ` maximum likelihood ' estimates @xmath30 of @xmath31 can be expressed in terms of the mean and mean logarithm of a set of independent observations @xmath32 these estimates are obtained in terms of the properties of @xmath33 by maximizing the ` log - likelihood ' function @xmath34 with the following result @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 is the digamma function , the logarithmic derivative of the gamma function    the usual riemannian information metric on the parameter space @xmath38 is given by @xmath39 for more details about the geometry see  @xcite .",
    "the 1-dimensional subspace parametrized by @xmath16 corresponds to the available ` random ' processes .",
    "a path through the parameter space @xmath40 of gamma models determines a curve @xmath41\\rightarrow { \\cal{s } } : t\\mapsto ( c_1(t),c_2(t))\\ ] ] with tangent vector @xmath42 and norm @xmath43 given via  ( [ gammametric ] ) by @xmath44 the information length of the curve is @xmath45 and the curve corresponding to an underlying poisson process has @xmath46 so @xmath47 and @xmath48 and the information length is @xmath49    as we know from elementary geometry , arc length is often difficult to evaluate analytically because it contains the square root of the sum of squares of derivatives .",
    "accordingly , we sometimes use the ` energy ' of the curve instead of length for comparison between nearby curves . energy is given by integrating the _ square _ of the norm of @xmath50 @xmath51 so in the case of the curve @xmath46 the energy is @xmath52 it is easily shown that a curve of constant @xmath14 has @xmath53 where @xmath54 and @xmath55 this has energy @xmath56    locally , minimal paths joining nearby pairs of points in @xmath40 are given by the autoparallel curves or geodesics  @xcite defined by  ( [ gammametric ] ) .",
    "some typical sprays of geodesics emanating from various points are provided in  @xcite .",
    "the gaussian curvature of the surface @xmath40",
    "@xcite actually controls all of the geometry of geodesics and it is given by @xmath57 @xmath58",
    "for a general account of large - scale structures in the universe , see fairall  @xcite .",
    "kauffmann and fairall  @xcite developed a catalogue search algorithm for nearly spherical regions devoid of bright galaxies and obtained a spectrum for diameters of significant voids .",
    "this had a peak in the range 8 - 11 @xmath59 a long tail stretching at least to 64 @xmath59 and is compatible with the recent extrapolation models of baccigalupi et al  @xcite which yield an upper bound on void diameters of about 100 @xmath60 we shall return to the data of kauffmann and fairall later in this section .",
    "simulations of sahni et al .",
    "@xcite found strong correlation between void sizes and primordial gravitational potential at void centres ; void topologies tended to simplify with time .",
    "ghigna et al .",
    "@xcite found in their simulations that void statistics are sensitive to the passage from cdm to chdm models .",
    "this suggested that the void distribution is sensitive to the type of dark matter but not to the transfer function between types .",
    "chdm simulations gave a void probability in excess of observations , cdm simulations being somewhat better .",
    "vogeley et al .",
    "@xcite compared void statistics with cdm simulations of a range of cosmological models ; good agreement was achieved for samples of very bright galaxies ( @xmath61 ) but for samples containing fainter galaxies the predicted voids were reported to be ` too empty ' .",
    "ghigna et al .",
    "@xcite compared observational data with gaussian - initiated @xmath7-body simulations in a @xmath62 box and found that at the @xmath63 scales the void probability for chdm was significantly larger than observed .",
    "ghigna et al .",
    "@xcite compared simulated galaxy samples with the perseus - pisces redshift survey .",
    "the void probability function did discriminate between dm and cdm models , the former giving particularly good agreement with the survey .",
    "little and weinberg  @xcite used similar @xmath7-body simulations , and found that the void probability was insensitive to the shape of the initial power spectrum .",
    "watson and rowan - robinson  @xcite found that standard cdm predictors do yield reasonably good void probability function estimates whereas voronoi foam models performed less well .",
    "lachize - rey and dacosta were of the opinion that the available samples of galaxies were insufficiently representative , because of greater apparent frequency of larger voids in the southern hemisphere .",
    "bernardeau  @xcite started from a gaussian field and derived an expression for the void probability function , obtaining @xmath64 with @xmath65 the variance of the number of galaxies in volume @xmath66 this distribution has an extended large tail because it is asymptotically more like the exponential of @xmath67 than the poisson case which decays like the exponential of @xmath68 cappi et al .",
    "@xcite examined the dependence of the void probability function on scale for a range of galaxy cluster samples , finding a general scaling to occur up to void diameters of about @xmath69 kerscher et al .",
    "@xcite used the void probability function to obtain spatial statistics of clusters on scales @xmath70 obtaining satisfactory agreement in a model with a cosmological constant and in a model with breaking of scale invariance of perturbations .",
    "( 300,220)(0,0 ) ( 80,0 ) ( 43,160)@xmath71 ( 300,-7)void diameter @xmath72    for our model we consider the diameter @xmath72 of a spherical void with volume @xmath73 having distribution  ( [ feq ] ) .",
    "something close to the random variable @xmath72 has direct representation in some theoretical models , for example as polyhedral diameters in voronoi tesselations  @xcite .",
    "( 300,220)(0,0 ) ( 50,0 )    the probability density function for @xmath72 is given by @xmath74 then the mean @xmath75 variance @xmath76 and coefficient of variation @xmath77 of @xmath72 are given , respectively , by @xmath78    the fact that the coefficient of variation  ( [ cvd ] ) depends only on @xmath79 gives a rapid fitting of data to  ( [ dpdf ] ) .",
    "numerical fitting to  ( [ cvd ] ) gives @xmath80 this substituted in  ( [ meand ] ) yields an estimate of @xmath14 to fit a given observational mean . by way of illustration",
    ", this has been done in figure  [ kfzcat ] for the zcat / src data from kauffmann and fairall  @xcite figure 8a ( cf also  @xcite figure 6.5 ) , both set to unit mean diameter  the true mean for that catalogue was about @xmath81 the fitted values were @xmath82 and @xmath83 this fit is not particularly good if the reported peaks are not an artifact but , qualitatively , we observe that the fitted value @xmath84 is apparently significantly less than @xmath85 which would correspond to the random model .",
    "we conclude tentatively that , for the zcat / src data subjected to the kauffmann and fairall search algorithm , the new model suggests clumping rather than dispersion in the underlying stochastic process .",

    "notebook for performing the fitting procedure is available from the author , who would welcome more sets of data .",
    "suppose that the parameter space @xmath40 of gamma - based models is a meaningful representation of the evolutionary process and that some coordinates such as @xmath86 @xmath87 in @xmath40 represent current data .",
    "then geodesics in @xmath40 through this point represent some kind of extremal path .",
    "moreover , we may consider a vector field @xmath88 on @xmath40 such that @xmath86 @xmath87 is the present endpoint of an integral curve of @xmath89 the initial point of this curve being presumably in an epoch when less clustering ( @xmath90 ) , a random state ( @xmath16 ) or even dispersion ( @xmath91 ) was present at higher density .",
    "it would be interesting to investigate the various candidate cosmologies for their appropriate vector fields , via the statistics of matter and voids they predict .",
    "the present gamma - related parametric statistical models provide the means to convert the catalogue statistics into the coordinate parameters and a background geometrization of the statistics on which dynamical processes may be formulated .",
