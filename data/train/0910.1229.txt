    "results from lattice qcd calculations are generally computed in units of the lattice spacing  @xmath9 used in the simulation .",
    "the lattice spacing must be computed separately and divided out in order to convert these results into physical units ( gev , fm  ) , for comparison with experiment .",
    "any error in the lattice spacing determination feeds into most other quantities from lattice qcd , and , in many cases , it is among the dominant sources of errors .",
    "for example , in our determination of the decay constant of the @xmath10 meson  @xcite , 1% of the total error of 1.3% comes from the 1.5% uncertainty in the value of the lattice spacing .",
    "reducing the error on the lattice spacing is then very important for increasing the precision of the realistic lattice qcd calculations now possible  @xcite .",
    "generally the value of the lattice spacing is determined by comparing values from the simulation , in lattice units , with values from experiment , in physical units . a lattice simulation , for example ,",
    "might give a value for the pion decay constant in lattice units : @xmath11 .",
    "dividing by the experimental value @xmath12 in gev gives a value for the lattice spacing , @xmath13 , in inverse  gev .",
    "this lattice spacing can then be used to convert other simulation results from lattice units to physical units .",
    "lattice spacings determined in this way are inherently ambiguous because lattice simulations are never exact .",
    "in particular the use of a nonzero lattice spacing causes lattice quantites , like @xmath14 , to deviate from their physical values , in this case @xmath12 .",
    "such errors differ from quantity to quantity , and therefore so will values for the lattice spacing that are computed from these quantities .",
    "such differences , however , vanish in the continuum limit ,  @xmath15 , and so do not affect lattice predictions that have been extrapolated to  @xmath16 .    in principle , any dimensionful quantity can be used to determine the lattice spacing , but some quantities are more useful than others .",
    "ideally one wants quantities that are easily computed , free of other types of simulation error , largely independent of lattice parameters other than the lattice spacing , and well measured in experiments .",
    "use of the pion decay constant , for example , is not ideal .",
    "this decay constant is quite sensitive to the @xmath0  and @xmath1  quark masses , which are generally too large in current simulations ; accurate values for the decay constant can be obtained only after chiral extrapolations of the simulation data to the physical quark masses .",
    "this greatly complicates the use of the decay constant to set the lattice spacing .",
    "one physical quantity that is very easy to calculate in lattice simulations is the @xmath3  parameter derived from the potential  @xmath17 between two infinite - mass quarks separated by distance  @xmath18 .",
    "parameter @xmath3 is defined implicitly by the equation @xmath19 where @xmath20 and @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "( taking @xmath22 gives the original such standard parameter , @xmath5  @xcite . ) this quantity is easily calculated , in lattice units ( that is , @xmath23 ) , to better than  1% . unlike the pion decay",
    "constant , it is only weakly dependent upon the quark masses .",
    "it would be an ideal choice for setting the lattice spacing except for the fact that there is no experimental value for the physical  @xmath3this must be estimated instead from other lattice calculations .    in this paper",
    "we examine three other quantities that can be used to determine the lattice spacing : 1 )  the radial excitation energy in the @xmath24 system ( @xmath25 ) ; 2 )  the mass difference between the @xmath10 meson and one half the @xmath26 mass ; and 3 )  the decay constant of the fictitious @xmath6 particle , which can be related accurately to @xmath27 and @xmath28 .",
    "the valence - quark masses are easily tuned in each case and each quantity is relatively insensitive to sea - quark masses .",
    "consequently each of these quantities can be used to generate lattice spacings on an ensemble - by - ensemble basis .",
    "none of these quantities can be computed as accurately as @xmath23 in simulations , but we can combine simulation results for them with values for @xmath23 to obtain very accurate estimates for the physical value of  @xmath3 .",
    "given @xmath3 , the different values of @xmath23 can be used to obtain accurate lattice spacings for each of the simulations we discuss here and any other simulations where @xmath23 has been computed .    of our three quantities ,",
    "the @xmath6 decay constant gives the most accurate results .",
    "the @xmath6 is a fictitious meson , however , and so its `` experimental '' properties must be related to those of real mesons using simulations .",
    "the @xmath6 is particularly closely related to the @xmath29 and @xmath30 mesons .",
    "as we will show , its mass and decay constant can be accurately related to those of the @xmath29 and @xmath30 through a chiral analysis of simulation data for a variety of quark masses and lattice spacings .",
    "such an analysis also gives an independent , fourth estimate of @xmath3 .",
    "we describe in section 2 the three primary methods we have used to obtain lattice spacings for a wide variety of simulations .",
    "each can be used to generate an estimate for the physical value of @xmath3 , given values of @xmath23 . in section 3",
    "we combine the three analyses to generate a single , combined estimate for @xmath3 .",
    "this can then be used to covert the @xmath23 values into a determination of @xmath9 on each ensemble .",
    "we also demonstrate how to determine the lattice spacing from the @xmath6 without using @xmath3 .",
    "the two methods are compared and shown to agree in the @xmath31 limit . in section",
    "4 we give a value for @xmath5 derived from our value of @xmath3 for comparison to others using that parameter . in section 5 summarize our results .",
    "finally , we discuss the chiral analysis of decay constants and masses for the @xmath29 , @xmath30 and their relation with those of the  @xmath6 meson in appendices  a , b and  c.",
    "in table  [ tab : params ] we list the parameter sets for the different milc ensembles of gluon configurations that we have used here , although not all ensembles were used in every lattice spacing determination .",
    "values for the static - quark potential parameter @xmath23 , in lattice units , were determined by the milc collaboration  @xcite .",
    "they calculated the heavy quark potential by fitting wilson loops of fixed spatial size as a function of lattice time . on the finest two sets of ensembles",
    "smeared time links were used to reduce statistical noise and a two - state exponential fit in time reduced the contamination from excited potentials .",
    "the heavy quark potential obtained was then fit as a function of spatial separation over the range between 0.2fm and 0.7fm to a cornell potential with the addition of corrections for lattice artifacts .",
    "the point at which the condition for @xmath3 held was then determined from this fit .",
    "the errors given are statistical errors only , since discretisation effects are taken care of in our continuum extrapolations .    in what follows",
    "we will combine these values for @xmath23 with estimates of the lattice spacing  @xmath9 determined using three different physical quantities to obtain estimates for the physical value of @xmath3 ( that is , at zero lattice spacing and with correct sea - quark masses ) .",
    "the calculation of the spectrum of mesons formed as bound states of bottom quarks and antiquarks has been an important test for lattice",
    "there are many radial and orbital excitations below threshold for strong decay and so many gold - plated states , well - characterised experimentally .",
    "the radial and orbital excitation energies are almost identical for charmonium and bottomonium when spin - averaged  @xcite and so rather insensitive to the heavy quark mass .",
    "heavy - quark vacuum polarization effects are tiny and so can be safely neglected .",
    "this makes these systems very suitable for the determination of the lattice spacing  @xcite and was one of the key calculations demonstrating the importance of including the effect of @xmath0 , @xmath1 and @xmath2 sea quarks  @xcite .",
    "here we improve on the calculations in  @xcite which used results from milc super - coarse , coarse and fine ensembles and compared ensembles with and without sea quarks .",
    "we study only ensembles including sea quarks but include also very coarse and superfine ensembles for a wider range of lattice spacing values .",
    "we calculate @xmath33-quark propagators on the milc gluon field configurations using lattice nonrelativistic qcd ( nrqcd ) which has been developed over many years to handle well the physics of heavy quark systems on the lattice  @xcite .",
    "it makes a virtue of the nonrelativistic nature of bottomonium bound states ( @xmath34 for the @xmath24 ) by discarding the rest mass energy in favour of accurately handling typical momentum and energy scales inside the bound states .",
    "nrqcd can be matched to full qcd order by order in @xmath35 and @xmath36 .",
    "we work through @xmath37@xmath38 in the nonrelativistic expansion and apply discretisation improvements through @xmath37@xmath39 to @xmath35 terms and to chromomagnetic and chromoelectric field - dependent terms at @xmath40 ( so that terms which induce fine structure are completely improved to @xmath37@xmath41 ) .",
    "an analysis of remaining systematic errors is given in  @xcite .",
    "the nonrelativistic hamiltonian that we use is given by  @xcite : @xmath42 this is implemented in calculating @xmath33 quark propagators by evolving the @xmath33 quark green s function on a single pass through the lattice using : @xmath43 with starting condition : @xmath44 here @xmath45 is the symmetric lattice derivative and @xmath46 is the improved derivative , @xmath47 .",

    "@xmath53 is a real spatial smearing function which multiplies a unit matrix in color and spin space as the starting point for the quark propagator .",
    "the antiquark propagator for a given source is then the complex conjugate of the green s function obtained from eq .",
    "[ eq : evol ] .",
    "when the quark and antiquark propagators are combined ( with appropriate pauli matrices for different @xmath54  @xcite ) into meson correlators , @xmath55 improves the overlap with particular ground and excited states for a better signal .",

    "these fit results have statistical correlations with each other , as well as with the output value of @xmath3 , the values of @xmath23 used in the fit , and the simulation results for @xmath62 ( table  [ tab : etas ] ) .",
    "we used the fit here to compute means and a covariance matrix for all of these quantities , and this is used as input data in the @xmath8 analysis of section  [ sec : fetas ] .",
    "note that the values for the @xmath6 mass and decay constant agree to better than a percent with the leading - order expectations from chiral perturbation theory : @xmath63 and @xmath64 , respectively .",
    "our analysis above , however , goes far beyond leading order ( see appendix  [ sec : chiral2 ] ) .",
    "our @xmath6 results are also quite independent of the input prior for @xmath3 ; taking 0.3133(23)fm as the prior , for example , causes shifts that are smaller than a quarter of a standard deviation .",
    "the @xmath6 parameters are most sensitive to the physical parameters for the pion and kaon .",
    "they can easily be corrected should there be small shifts in the values derived from experiment for @xmath28 and @xmath27 .",
    "the changes in the @xmath6 parameters would be : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are changes in the pion and kaon decay constants from the values used here .",
    "we model light - quark pseudoscalar masses and decay constants using partially - quenched chiral perturbation theory , augmented with corrections for the finite lattice spacing . for simplicity we re - express chiral perturbation theory in terms of pion and kaon masses , in place of the quark masses , using @xmath68 as expansion parameters , where @xmath69 we use the formulas through next - to - leading order from  @xcite , together with higher - order corrections in @xmath70 and @xmath71 and finite-@xmath9 corrections .",

    "still higher - order terms are smaller than 0.1% and so negligible , as are the last few terms in practice .",
    "following  @xcite , we model the @xmath84 dependence using a mixture of terms that depend upon @xmath84 and @xmath70 : @xmath85 where we set @xmath86 , @xmath87 as in  @xcite .",
    "( @xmath88 is also the ultraviolet scale in the chiral logarithms . ) .",
    "we allow the coefficients to have mass dependence @xmath89 again the @xmath90 are expected to be  @xmath83 , except for terms involving sea - quark terms which should be 35  times smaller .",
    "the highest - order terms in these expansions are already negligible , making further terms irrelevant .",
    "we include the @xmath91 term in eq .",
    "( [ a2-corrn ] ) to allow for non - analytic behavior at small  @xmath70 , although in practice it is negligible in our fits .",
    "we included priors in our fitting analysis for each of the parameters in @xmath73 and for all the @xmath82s and @xmath90s .",
    "these are initial estimates for each parameter that function as extra `` data '' and allow us to account ( in our error estimates ) for the uncertainties in these parameters , even when they are largely unconstrained by our simulation data .",
    "the parameters in @xmath73 are well determined by our data ; we use very broad priors for these , which have no impact on the final errors .",
    "we use a prior of @xmath92 for each of the @xmath82s and @xmath90s , except for terms involving sea - quark masses in which case we use  @xmath93 .",
    "as reported in  @xcite , we have tested these fitting formulas extensively by using formulas from partially - quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory , with randomly selected coefficients and randomly generated higher - order corrections in the masses and @xmath84 , to generate fake data sets for the same masses and lattice spacings used in our analysis here .",
    "we added statistical noise to the fake data that was comparable in magnitude to that in our real simulation data , with similar correlations .",
    "we then fit the fake data using the formulas above , together with the empirical bayes method  @xcite to set a prior for the expansion parameters ( @xmath82 and @xmath90 ) . in each case",
    "we could compare extrapolated results from our analysis of the fake data with the exact results , since we knew the underlying formula used to generate the fake data .",
    "we ran tests for several hundred cases . as expected",
    ", we found that 70% of the time the extrapolated results were within one standard deviation of the exact results .",
    "two examples , shown in fig .  [ fig : fakedata ] , illustrate how effective our formulas are in handling @xmath84  dependence that is much larger and much more complex than we see in our actual simulation results ( figure  [ fig : fmpi2 ] ) ,    the logarithms in the nlo chiral formulas reflect infrared sensitivity .",
    "these terms are sensitive to the finite volume of our lattice at the level of  0.11% for the decay constants ( less for masses ) .",
    "we add finite - volume corrections to the logarithms which we obtain by recomputing the one - loop chiral corrections that lead to logarithms using finite - volume sums instead of integrals in momentum - space , and subtracting them from the infinite volume results .",
    "these corrections are quite sensitive to the meson mass , which raises an issue since in staggered - quark formalisms like hisq each pseudoscalar meson comes in several different `` tastes '' , all of them heavier than the goldstone meson whose mass we use in our formulas .",
    "taste splittings are @xmath84 corrections , which vanish in the continuum limit , and most of the effects of these we model with our corrections  eq .  ( [ a2-corrn ] ) ( which we have tested , as discussed in the previous paragraph ) .",
    "the finite - volume corrections , however , are particularly sensitive to meson masses , so we use an `` effective '' pseudoscalar mass when we calculate them : @xmath94 where @xmath95 is the goldstone meson s mass .",
    "we expect @xmath96 .",
    "we allow @xmath97 to float in our fits , treating it as a fit parameter .",
    "we use @xmath98 as our prior .",
    "our fit favors a nonzero value for @xmath97 , giving  @xmath99 which is consistent with expectations .",
    "we include terms in each of our fitting functions that correct for the discrepancies @xmath100 between the bare sea - quark masses used in the simulation and the physically correct bare quark masses ( that is , the ones that give correct masses for the @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath6 ) . our estimates for the correct @xmath2-quark masses ( in lattice units ) for each ensemble are given in table  [ tab : alatt - r1-fetas ] ; the @xmath101 mass is 27.8(3 ) times smaller  @xcite .",
    "these masses , however , are for hisq quarks , while the sea quarks were all analyzed using the asqtad formalism .",
    "quark masses in the two formalisms can be related to each other , ensemble by ensemble , by comparing @xmath29 and @xmath6 masses for mesons whose valence quarks are either hisq or asqtad quarks .",
    "hisq masses and asqtad masses are equivalent when they give the same @xmath29 and @xmath6 masses .",
    "the ratio of a hisq mass to the corresponding asqtad mass determined in this way should be almost independent of the valence - quark mass , but will depend somewhat on the lattice spacing and weakly on the sea - quark masses .",
    "we have compared asqtad data from  @xcite for ensembles  3,4,6,7 with our results in table  [ tab : pik ] to obtain the following simplified parameterization for the ratio of hisq to asqtad quark masses : @xmath102 where @xmath103 is the tuned hisq mass given in table  [ tab : alatt - r1-fetas ] and @xmath104 is the sum of the three sea - quark asqtad masses for that ensemble .",
