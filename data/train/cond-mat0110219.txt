    "in the studies of spin glasses , much effort has been devoted either exprimentally or theoretically to the properties under magnetic fields .",
    "unfortunately , our understanding of them still has remained unsatisfactory@xcite .",
    "on theoretical side , most of the numerical studies have focused on the properties of the simple ising model , especially the three - dimensional ( 3d ) edwards - anderson ( ea ) model . while the existence of a true thermodynamic spin - glass ( sg ) transition has been established for this model in zero field , the question of its existence or nonexistence in magnetic fields has remained unsettled . this question is closely related to the hotly debated issue of whether the ordered state of the 3d ising sg in zero field exhibits a replica - symmetry breaking ( rsb ) or not .",
    "if one tries to understand real experimental sg ordering , one has to remember that many of real sg materials are more or less heisenberg - like rather than ising , in the sense that the random magnetic anisotropy is considerably weaker than the isotropic exchange interaction@xcite .",
    "for example , in widely studied canonical spin glasses , _",
    "i.e. _ , dilute metallic alloys such as aufe , agmn and cumn , random magnetic anisotropy originated from the dzyaloshinski - moriya interaction or the dipolar interaction is often one or two magnitudes weaker than the isotropic rkky interaction .",
    "numerical simulations have indicated that the isotropic 3d heisenberg sg with finite - range interaction does not exhibit the conventional sg order at finite temperature in zero field @xcite .",
    "( however , see also ref.@xcite . )",
    "since applied fields generally tend to suppress the sg ordering , a true thermodynamic sg transition is even more unlikely under magnetic fields in case of the 3d heisenberg sg .",
    "experimentally , however , a rather sharp transition - like behavior has been observed under magnetic fields in typical heisenberg - like sg magnets , although it is not completely clear whether the observed anomaly corresponds to a true thermodynamic transition@xcite .",
    "the situation is in contrast to the zero - field case where the existence of a true thermodynamic sg transition has been established experimentally@xcite .",
    "set aside the question of the strict nature of the sg `` transition '' , it is experimentally observed that a weak applied field suppresses the zero - field sg transition temperature rather quickly . for higher fields ,",
    "the sg `` transition '' becomes much more robust to fields , where the `` transition temperature '' shows much less field dependence @xcite .",
    "such behaviors of the sg transition temperature under magnetic fields @xmath0 were often interpreted in terms of the mean - field model @xcite .",
    "indeed , the mean - field sherrington - kirkpatrick ( sk ) model@xcite with an infinite - range heisenberg exchange interaction with weak random magnetic anisotropy exhibits a transition line similar to the experimental one @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _ , the so - called de almeida - thouless ( at ) line@xcite @xmath1 in weak - field regime where the anisotropy is important , and the gabay - toulouse ( gt ) line@xcite @xmath2 in strong - field regime where the anisotropy is unimportant . nevertheless , if one notes that the true finite - temperature transition under magnetic fields , though possible in the infinite - range sk model , is unlikely to occur in a more realistic finite - range heisenberg model , an apparent success of the mean - field model in explaining the experimental phase diagram should be taken with strong reservation .",
    "thus , the question of the true nature of the experimentally observed sg `` transition '' under magnetic fields remains unsolved .",
    "recently , one of the present authors has proposed a scenario , the spin - chirality decoupling - recoupling scenario , aimed at explaining some of the puzzles concerning the experimentally observed sg transition@xcite . in this scenario , _ chirality _ , which is a multispin variable representing the sense or the handedness of local noncoplanar spin structures induced by spin frustration , plays an essential role . as illustrated in fig.[fig - chiral ]",
    ", locally noncoplanar spin structures inherent to the sg ordered state sustain two energetically degenerate `` chiral '' states , `` right - handed '' and `` left - handed '' states , characterized by mutually opposite signs of the `` chiralities '' . here",
    ", one may define the local chirality by _ three _ neighboring heisenberg spins @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath5 by , @xmath6 this type of chirality is called `` scalar chirality '' , in distinction with `` vector chirality '' defined as a vector product of two neighboring heisenberg spins , @xmath7@xcite .",
    "note that the chirality defined by eq.([chidef ] ) is a pseudoscalar in the sense that it is invariant under global @xmath8 spin rotations but changes its sign under @xmath9 spin reflections ( or inversions which can be viewed as a combination of reflections and rotations ) .",
    "-@xmath10 denote four distinct heisenberg spins . ]    for a fully isotropic heisenberg sg , in particular , the chirality scenario of ref.@xcite claims the occurrence of a novel _ chiral - glass _ ordered state in which only the chirality exhibits a glassy long - range order ( lro ) while the spin remains paramagnetic . at the chiral - glass transition , among the global symmetries of the hamiltonian , @xmath11 , only the @xmath9 spin reflection ( inversion ) symmetry is broken spontaneously with keeping the @xmath8 spin rotation symmetry preserved .",
    "note that this picture entails the spin - chirality ( or @xmath12 ) decoupling on long length and time scales : namely , although the chirality is not independent of the spin on microscopic length scale , it eventually exhibits a long - distance behavior entirely different from the spin .",
    "such a chiral - glass transition without the conventional spin - glass order was indeed observed in recent equilibrium and off - equilibrium monte carlo ( mc ) simulations in zero field performed by hukushima and one of the authors ( h.k.)@xcite .",
    "it was also found there that the critical properties associated with the chiral - glass transition were different from those of the ising sg , and that the chiral - glass ordered state exhibited a one - step - like peculiar rsb .    in the chirality scenario of ref.@xcite , experimental sg transition in real heisneberg - like sg magnets",
    "is regarded essentially as a chiral - glass transition `` revealed '' via the random magnetic anisotropy .",
    "weak but finite random magnetic anisotropy inherent to real magnets `` recouples '' the spin to the chirality , and the chiral - glass transition shows up as an experimentally observable _",
    "spin_-glass transition in real heisneberg - like sg magnets .",
    "an interesting outcome of this picture is that the experimental sg transition is dictated by the chiral - glass transition of the fully isotropic system , _ not by the spin - glass transition of the fully isotropic system _ , which has been separated from the chiral one .",
    "very recently , the present authors discussed some of the possible consequences of the chirality scenario of ref.@xcite on the finite - field properties of the fully isotropic 3d heisenberg sg@xcite .",
    "it was argued there that the chiral - glass transition , essentially of the same character as the zero - field one , occurred also in finite fields . in the weak field regime ,",
    "the transition line was predicted to behave as @xmath13 where @xmath14 and @xmath10 are constants .",
    "generally , the coefficient @xmath14 could be either positive or negative .",
    "an interesting observation here is that the chiral - glass transition line ( [ eqn : phaseline ] ) aparrently has a form similar to the gt line of the mean - field model .",
    "we emphasize , however , that their physical origin is entirely different .",
    "the quadratic dependence of the chiral - glass transition line is simply of regular origin , whereas that of the gt - line in the sk model can not be regarded so .    in the present paper ,",
    "we report on our results of large - scale monte carlo simulations on the 3d isotropic heisenberg sg , performed with the aim to reexamine the sg ordering in magnetic fields in light of the chirality scenario .",
    "in particular , by means of extensive numerical simulations , we wish to clarify in detail how the spin and the chirality order in applied fields .",
    "part of the mc results have been reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "the present paper is organized as follows . in  [ secmodel ] , we introduce our model and explain some of the details of our numerical method .",
    "various physical quantities calculated in our mc simulations are defined in  [ secphysq ] .",
    "the results of mc simulations are presented in  [ secresult ] .",
    "the results for the chirality- and spin - related quantities are presented in  [ subsecchiral ] and",
    " [ subsecspin ] , respectively .",
    "it is found that the chiral - glass transition , essentially of the same character as the zero - field one , occurs under magnetic fields . the chiral - glass ordered state exhibits a one - step - like peculiar replica - symmetry breaking in the chiral sector , while it does not accompany the spin - glass order perpendicular to the applied field .",
    "critical properties of the chiral - glass transition are analyzed in  [ subseccritical ] .",
    "the analysis suggests that the universality class of both the zero - field and finite - field chiral - glass transitions might be common , which , however , differs from that of the standard 3d ising sg . in  [ subsecphase ] , we construct a magnetic phase diagram of the model .",
    "the chiral - glass ordered state remains quite robust against magnetic fields , while the chiral - glass transition line in applied fields has a character of the gt line of the mean - field model .",

    "our numerical results are discussed in terms of the recent experimental result on canonical sg .",
    "in this section , we introduce our model and explain some of the details of our numerical method .",
    "the model we consider is the isotropic classical heisenberg model on a 3d simple cubic lattice defined by the hamiltonian , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a three - component unit vector , and @xmath17 is the intensity of magnetic field applied along the @xmath18 direction .",

    ", we combine the standard heat - bath method with the temperature - exchange technique@xcite .",
    "care is taken to be sure that the system is fully equilibrated .",
    "equilibration is checked by the following procedures : first , we monitor the system to travel back and forth many times during the the temperature - exchange process ( typically more than 10 times ) between the maximum and minimum temperature points , and at the same time check that the relaxation due to the standard heat - bath updating is reasonably fast at the highest temperature , whose relaxation time is of order @xmath29 monte carlo steps per spin ( mcs ) .",
    "this guarantees that different parts of the phase space are sampled in each `` cycle '' of the temperature - exchange run .",
    "second , we check the stability of the results against at least three times longer runs for a subset of samples . error bars of physical quantities are estimated by the sample - to - sample statistical fluctuation over bond realizations .",
    "further details of our monte carlo simulations are given in table [ table - condition ] .",
    "in this section , we define various physical quantities calculated in our simulations below .",
    "[ defquantity ]      let us begin with the definition of the chirality .",

    "this indicates that the spin ordering of the 3d heisenberg sg is certainly noncoplanar , which guarantees that the system sustains the nontrivial chirality .",
    "meanwhile , a direct inspection of the spin pattern suggests that such noncoplanar spin configurations realized at low temperature in zero and weak fields is rather close to the coplanar one .",
    "indeed , for completely random configurations of heisenberg spins , @xmath36 should take a value @xmath96@xcite , a value considerably larger than the extrapolated @xmath97 values .",
    "this again suggests that the noncoplanar configuration realized in zero and weak fields is close to the coplanar one .",
    "interestingly , our mc data indicate that , in the weak field regime , @xmath98 slightly _ increases _ with increasing magnetic field at fixed temperatures .",
    "this observation could be understood if one notes that the zero - field noncoplanar spin configuration is close to the coplanar one , and that the application of a magnetic field to such nearly coplanar spin configuration tends to `` rise up '' the spins from this plane with keeping the plane orthogonal to the applied field .",
    "this gives rise to more `` three - dimensional '' local spin structures with larger @xmath36 .",

    "the same procedure is repeated for the case of @xmath24 .",
    "we then get @xmath182 , @xmath183 , @xmath184 . these estimates for @xmath24 agree within errors with the corresponding estimates for @xmath101 .",
    "our estimates of the chiral - glass exponents are summarized in table [ table - criticalexp ] , and are compared with the corresponding zero - field exponents reported in ref.@xcite .",
    "the finite - field exponents turn out to agree within errors with the corresonding zero - field exponents , suggesting that the zero - field and finite - field chiral - glass transitions lie in a common universality class .",
    "we note that this observation is consistent with the chirality scenario of refs.@xcite . in table",
    "[ table - criticalexp ] , we also show the sg exponents of the 3d ising ea model@xcite together with typical experimental values ( in zero field ) of real heisenberg - like sg magnet agmn@xcite .",
    "the critical properties of the chiral - glass transition differ clearly from those of the 3d ising ea sg .",
    "by contrast , the chiral - glass exponents are close to the experimental exponent values for canonical sg agmn , giving further support to the spin - chirality decoupling - recoupling scenario .        as a consistency check of our estimates of exponents and @xmath119 values ,",
    "we have also done the following : we use the @xmath185 value determined above , @xmath186 , and extrapolate the dip temperature of @xmath105 , @xmath109 , to @xmath187 ( see the dashed lines of fig.[fig - dip ] ) .",

    "these estimates of @xmath119 agree with those obtained from the chiral autocorrelation and employed in our scaling analysis .",

    "as can be seen from the figures , reasonable data collapsing are obtained , at least for larger lattices . at the same time , however , one sees that there exists a systematic deviation from the scaling for smaller lattices , particularly in the case of @xmath24 .",
    "such a deviation observed for smaller lattices suggests the existence of a significant finite - size correction .    , and ( b ) @xmath101 . ]",
    "the existence of such significant finite - size effects has also been suggested from the behavior of the chiral - overlap distribution function @xmath190 and of the chiral binder ratio @xmath105 . in a truly asymptotic critical regime , @xmath134 itself should scale at @xmath124 with tuning one exponent @xmath159 .",
    "however , in the range of sizes studied here @xmath191 , we can not observe such a full scaling of @xmath134 .",
    "such a lack of complete scaling of @xmath134 gives rise to certain degrees of uncertainty in our estimate of @xmath159 : namely , if one tries to scale the width of the distribution such as its second moment @xmath48 , it yields @xmath192 as given above ( see fig . [",
    "fig - getexponents](b ) ) , while if one tries to scale the height of @xmath190 , it instead yields @xmath193 , which is somewhat smaller than the above estimate , though still lying within the quoted error bar .",
    "lack of a complete scaling in @xmath134 is also reflected in the behavior of @xmath102 , which does not show a unique crossing at @xmath194 within the range of sizes studied : instead , as shown in fig.[fig - gx ] , the crossing occurs on the negative side of @xmath105 considerably above @xmath124 , while the crossing points tend to come down toward @xmath119 as @xmath27 increases .",
    "concerning the transverse spin order , from the behaviors of the binder ratio and of the diagonal transverse - spin - overlap distribution function , we have already found a strong numerical evidence that the chiral - glass transition does not accompany the transverse sg order , at least just below @xmath119 . in other words , the transverse component of the spin orders only at zero temperature , or else ,",
    "if it orders at a finite temperature , the associated transverse sg transition temperature @xmath195 is significantly lower than @xmath119 , say , below @xmath152 .",
    "we warn the reader here that , so long as one looks at the sg correlation or the sg order parameter , a rather careful analysis is required to really see such a behavior . as an example , we show in fig.[scalesph01 ] the standard finite - size scaling plots of the transverse sg order parameter @xmath196 for @xmath24 ; ( a ) the one assuming @xmath197 , and ( b ) the other assuming @xmath198 .",
    "similar plots are given in fig.[scalesph05 ] for the field @xmath101 with assuming @xmath197 , assuming ( a ) @xmath197 and ( b ) @xmath199 . at a look",
    ", both fits seem equally acceptable without appreciable difference if the exponents are adjusted in appropriate ways .",
    "then , one may wonder if the transverse spin might order simultaneously with the chirality , with the associated sg exponents @xmath200 ) and @xmath201 : see fig.[scalesph01 ] .",
    "we believe , however , this not to be the case due to the following reasons .    , assuming ( a ) @xmath202 , and ( b ) @xmath198 . ]    , assuming ( a ) @xmath202 , and ( b ) @xmath199 . ]",
    "first , as shown above , such simultaneous chirality and transverse - spin ordering contradicts with our result of the binder ratio @xmath73 and the diagonal transverse - spin - overlap distribution function @xmath79 .",
    "second , a closer inspection of the data reveals that , at and below @xmath124 , there exists an important difference between the behaviors of the transverse spin @xmath86 and of the chirality @xmath100 .    in fig.[fig - q2log ]",
    ", we show on a log - log plot the size dependence of the both order parameters , @xmath86 and @xmath100 , at several temperatures at and below @xmath119 .",
    "as can be seen from fig.[fig - q2log](a ) , below @xmath119 the chiral - glass order parameter exhibits a clear upbending for larger @xmath27 , indicating that @xmath100 tends to a nonzero value in the thermodynamic limit . in sharp contrast to this",
    ", such an upbending is never seen in the transverse sg order parameter @xmath86 : instead , @xmath86 shows a slight downbedning behavior at @xmath124 , which gradually shifts to the near linear behavior at lower temperatures .",
    "the observed behavior of @xmath86 is consistent with either , ( a ) the onset of the kosterlitz - thouless(kt)-like transition at a finite temperature below which the spin - glass correlations decay algebraically with a power - law or , ( b ) the gradual growth of the transverse sg correlation length @xmath203 which exceeds the investigated system size @xmath121 around a certain nonzero temperature close to @xmath119 . in the former case ,",
    "there should exist a well - defined finite sg transition temperature with the critical sg ordered state , while , in the latter case , there need not be a thermodynamic sg transition at a finite temperature . generally speaking , it is difficult to discriminate between the above two possibilities only from the @xmath86 data of finite sizes with @xmath204 .    nevertheless , we believe we can at least exclude here the possibility that the kt - like transverse sg transition occurs _ simultaneously _ with the chiral - glass transition at @xmath124 , accompanied by the critical sg ordered state at @xmath153 .",
    "first , we note that such a critical sg ordered state is not supported by our data of @xmath73 of fig.[fig - gst ] .",
    "second , the transverse _",
    "spin_-glass correlation - length exponent estimated in figs.[scalesph01](b ) and [ scalesph05](b ) assuming the simultaneous spin and chiral transition , @xmath205 , is far from from the lower - critical - dimension ( lcd ) value , @xmath206 , generically expected for such a kt - like transition . in",
    "so far as one insists that the transverse sg order occurs simultaneously with the chiral - glass order , our numerical estimate of the transverse sg correlation - length exponent is not compatible with the lcd value @xmath207 , which is now hard to reconcile with the kt - like behavior observed in @xmath86 at @xmath208 .",
    ", at several temperatures at and below @xmath136 : ( a ) the transverse - spin - glass order parameter @xmath86 , and ( b ) the chiral - glass order parameter @xmath48 .",
    "the chiral - glass transition temperature at this field is @xmath118 . to emphasize the deviation from the linearity , lines connecting the two small - size data @xmath26 and @xmath209 are drawn at each temperature . ]    in fact , as recently argued in ref.@xcite for the case of the _ xy_sg , the chirality scenario gives the possible cause why simultaneous spin and chiral orderings are apparently observed in the sg order parameter or the sg correlation function .",
    "this would closely be related to the length and time scales of the measurements . here",
    ", one should be aware of the fact that the spin - chirality decoupling is a _ long - scale _ phenomenon : at short scale , the chirality is never independent of the spin by its definition , roughly being its squared ( @xmath210 ) as expected from the naive power counting .",
    "hence , the behavior of the spin - correlation related quantities , including the sg order parameter which is a summed correlation , might well reflect the critical singularity associated with the _ chirality _ _ i.e. _ , the one of the chiral - glass transition , up to certain length and time scale .",
    "in such a scenario , apparent ( not true ) transverse `` spin - glass exponents '' expected would be @xmath211 and @xmath212 , the latter being derived from the short - scale relation , @xmath213 .",
    "note that these values are not very far from the ones we get from the finite - size scaling analysis of figs.[scalesph01](b ) and [ scalesph05](b ) , assuming the simultaneous occurrence of the spin and chiral transition .",
    "however , we stress again that such a disguised criticality in the spin sector is only a short - scale phenomenon , not a true critical one .      by collecting our estimates of the @xmath119 values for various field values , as obtained by the extrapolation of @xmath109 to @xmath187",
    ", we construct a phase diagram in the temperature vs. magnetic field plane .",
    "the result is shown in fig.[fig - phase ] .",
    "we have used here the zero - field estimate of ref.@xcite , @xmath214 .",
    "error bars are estimated here from the differences between the extrapolated @xmath119 values via the @xmath110 and @xmath215 fits . as is evident from fig.[fig - phase ]",
    ", the chiral - glass state remains quite robust against magnetic fields .",
    "this is most evident in fig.[fig - phase](b ) where we draw the same phase diagram on a plot where both the temperature and the magnetic - field axes have common energy scale .",
    "indeed , @xmath216 is not much reduced from the zero - field value even at a field as large as ten times of @xmath217 . at lower fields ,",
    "the chiral - glass transition line is almost orthogonal to the @xmath218 axis , consistent with the behavior eq.([eqn : phaseline ] ) derived from the chirality scenario .",
    "our data are even not inconsistent with the coefficient @xmath14 in eq.([eqn : phaseline ] ) being slightly negative so that @xmath216 initially _ increases _ slightly with @xmath17 , though it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion due to the scatter of our estimate of @xmath216 .",
    "if one remembers here our mc observation that the application of a weak magnetic field tends to increase the mean local amplitude of the chirality , @xmath36 , from its zero - field value , such an initial increase of @xmath216 seems not totally unlikely .",
    "-@xmath219 phase diagram of the 3d @xmath22 heisenberg sg determined by the present simulation .",
    "note that the energy scales of the @xmath17 and of the @xmath219 axes are mutually different in fig.(a ) , while they are taken to be common in fig.(b ) . ]",
    "in summary , we have performed large - scale equilibrium monte carlo simulations on the 3d isotropic heisenberg sg in finite magnetic fields . we have confirmed that our mc results are consistent with the chirality scenario of ref.@xcite . among other things",
    ", we have verified the occurrence of a finite - temperature chiral - glass transition in applied fields , essentially of the same character as the zero - field one . the chiral - glass ordered state exhibits a one - step - like peculiar rsb , while it does not accompany the transverse sg order , at least up to temperatures around @xmath152 .",
    "the criticality of finite - field chiral - glass transitions seems to be common with that of the zero - field one , which , however , clearly differs from the criticality of the standard 3d ising ea model .",
    "meanwhile , the chiral - glass exponents turn out to be close to the experimental exponents determined for canonical sg such as agmn .",
    "we have also constructed a magnetic phase diagram of the 3d heisenberg sg model .",
    "the chiral - glass transition line in the @xmath17-@xmath219 plane is found to be almost vertical to the temperature axis , up to rather high fields of order @xmath220 , indicating that the chiral - glass ordered state is quite robust against magnetic fields .",
    "this somewhat surprising property probably arises from the fact that the magnetic field couples in the hamiltonian directly fo the spin , _ not to the chirality _ , and the effective coupling between the field and the chirality is rather weak .",
    "the chiral - glass transition line has a character of the gabay - toulouse line of the mean - field model , yet its physical origin being entirely different .    . for comparison",
    ", we also show the present numerical result of the magnetic phase diagram of the 3d @xmath22 heisenberg sg model .",
    "the way how we scale the units of magnetic field and temperature in plotting the experimental data is explained in the text . ]",
    "it is not immediately possible to make a direct comparison of our results with experiments .",
    "this is mainly because the random magnetic anisotropy , which inevitably exists in real sg materials , is not introduced in our present model .",
    "furthermore , in real sg magnets , spins do not necessarily sit on a simple - cubic lattice , nor interact with other spins via the nearest - neighbor @xmath22 coupling , _",
    "etc_. in spite of these obvious limitations , it might be interesting to try to compare our present magnetic phase diagram with the experimental one for heisenberg - like sg magnets .",
    "chirality scenario claims that , in the high - field region where the anisotropy is negligible relative to the applied magnetic field , the sg transition line should essentially be given by the chiral - glass transition line of the fully isotropic system .",
    "if so , our present result entails that the sg transition line of real heisenberg - like sg should be almost vertical against the temperature axis in the high - field regime where the magnetic field overwhelms the random magnetic anisotropy . in fig.[phasedg](a ) , we reproduce the experimental @xmath17-@xmath219 phase diagram of canonical sg aufe from ref.@xcite . in the same figure",
    ", we also show our present result of the chiral - glass transition line , scaled in the following way .",
    "we try to mimic the real system by the classical heisenberg hamiltonian with an effective coupling @xmath20 and an effective magnetic field @xmath17 , which is defined in terms of eq.([eqn : phaseline ] ) .",
    "first , we estimate the zero - field transition temperature of the hypothetical _ isotropic _ system to be @xmath221k , by extrapolating the high - field gt - like transition line of aufe to @xmath218",
    ". then , with the knowledge of our present estimate of @xmath222 , we estimate the relevant @xmath20 roughly to be 50k .",
    "the field intensity @xmath17 is then translated into the field intensity in the standard unit @xmath223 by the relation @xmath224 , @xmath225 being the effective bohr number : in case of aufe , @xmath225 was experimentally estimated to be @xmath226 , where @xmath227 is the bohr magneton@xcite .",
    "thus , our fig.[fig - phase ] suggests that the sg phase boundary of aufe might stay nearly vertical up to the field as high as @xmath228[t ] .",
    "of course , considering the difference in microscopic details between the present model and real aufe , one can not expect a truly quantitative correspondence here .",
    "anyway , further high - field experiments on aufe and other heisenberg - like sg magnets might be worthwhile to determine the sg phase boundary in the high - field regime .    in order to make further comparison with the experimental phase diagram in the low - field regime , it is essential to examine the effects of random magnetic anisotropy inherent to real sg materials . indeed ,",
    "in the low - field regime where the applied field intensity is comparable to or weaker than the random magnetic anisotropy , the chirality scenario predicts the appearance of a singular crossover line which has some character of the at - line of the mean - field model@xcite . in order to make further insight into the spin - glass and the chiral - glass orderings in magnetic fields and to check further the validity of the chirality scenario , it would be interesting to make similar finite - field simulations for the _ anisotropic _ 3d heisenberg sg model .",
