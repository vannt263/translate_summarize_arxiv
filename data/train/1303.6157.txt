    "otherwise , if such trapped surfaces do not form as the collapse evolves , the radial null geodesics emerging from the singularity can reach the distant observer and hence , singularity will be naked @xcite .",

    "the effective theory shares the form of the classical theory , but contains correction terms from the quantum theory .",
    "furthermore , in the semiclassical regime , this scenario agrees with classical general relativity .",
    "within such a scenario , the classical concepts ( such as singularities and trapped surfaces ) , looks promising to be developed in quantum theory .    to that purpose , we apply the recent results of the effective theory of lqc in the resolution of the singularities related to the gravitational collapse of a star .",

    ". finally , we present the conclusion of our results in section [ discussion ] .",
    "the physical model we consider is that of a collapsing spherical body ( star ) , whose matter is described by a _ homogeneous _",
    "massless scalar field .",
    "the matter is confined to a spherically symmetric region , whose coordinates are considered as @xmath0 . in order to describe the whole spacetime structure , we assume that the spacetime is splitted into two parts : the _ interior _ region which constitutes the matter field ; and the _ exterior _ region which must be matched to the interior one at the boundary with the coordinate radius @xmath1",
    ".    the geometry in the interior region can be modeled by a metric of the flrw family @xcite : @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the standard line element on the unit two sphere .",

    "@xmath24 is the total gravitational mass within the shell labelled by @xmath4 .    in order to investigate the geometry of trapped surfaces inside the star , it is convenient to study the behaviour of the radial null geodesics emerging from the interior spacetime .",

    ", it allows the matter to be radiated away as collapse evolves ; and secondly , it enables the study of formation and evolution of horizon during the collapse .",
    "the second aspect is particularly important ; indeed , formation of a black hole as the end state of a collapsing star indicates that there exists a moment when an apparent horizon develops inside the cloud , and thence all the matter content collapses inside such horizon .",

    "on this section , we discuss the quantum gravity induced corrections to the classical evolution presented in previous section . to do this , we follow an effective scenario provided by the holonomy corrections imported from lqg for the spherically symmetric model ( [ intmetric ] ) .    in lqc ,",

    "thus , if the maximum speed @xmath106 is lower than the critical speed @xmath115 , no horizon can form .",

    "it has been proposed that gamma - ray bursts may occur at the final state of the collapse @xcite . in our model herein , although the effective theory is not accurate in a deep planck regime , there might be some stages of the gravitational collapse where the effective theory becomes relevant .",
    "therefore , from such a scenario it could be observed some of those outward flux of energy from gamma - ray bursters .",
    "in addition , in the cases in which one or two horizons form , the resulting exterior geometry corresponded to an exotic non - singular black hole which is different than the schwarzschild spacetime @xcite .",
    "modification to the mass function through the ( interior ) quantum gravity effects at the boundary of two regions , results in an effective exterior vaidya geometry .",
    "more precisely , from eq .",
    "( [ mass - effb ] ) we have that @xmath180 therefore , using eq .",
    "( [ match3 ] ) , we get @xmath181 , so that @xmath182 . consequently , the vaidya metric ( [ extmetric ] ) takes the effective form : @xmath183 the effective vaidya solution ( [ extmetric-1 - 1 ] ) shows that the semiclassical ( interior ) spacetime is manifest through a modification to the newton constant @xmath12 as @xmath184 .",
    "similar scenario was presented in the recent works @xcite .",
    "therein , it was shown that , in situations where the interior spacetime undergoes a transition from positive to negative pressures , a quantum improvement to the vaidya outgoing solution should be implemented . nevertheless , this effective outgoing vaidya solution , results in a modification of the newton constant as @xmath185 being a scale dependent function @xcite .",
    "the redefinition of the newton constant in this context was introduced to model quantum effects and avoid the problem of unbound back scattered radiation @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is seen from eq .",
    "( [ extmetric-1 - 1 ] ) that near the bounce , as @xmath186 , then @xmath187 .",
    "hence , the ( effective ) exterior metric ( [ extmetric-1 - 1 ] ) along with the bounce , smoothly transforms to @xmath188 which describes a minkowski spacetime in retarded null coordinate . from the modified equation , corresponding to eq .",
    "( [ match3 ] ) in this case , it is seen that the ( effective )",
    "vaidya geodesic , which emerges from the bounce before it evaporates into free space , is null .",
    "it follows that the non - spacelike trajectories can come out from the bounce and reach the exterior observers at the final stages of the gravitational collapse .",
    "hence , the final bounce will be naked in the case in which the occurrence of trapped surfaces is avoided ( cf .",
    "section [ outward - energy ] ) .",
    "the qualitative picture that emerges from our toy model was influenced by a homogeneous interior spacetime .",
    "nevertheless , in a realistic collapsing scenario one has to employ a more general inhomogeneous setting ( see ref .",
    "@xcite for recent development of techniques to handle inhomogeneous systems , which gives promising indications ) .",
    "furthermore , the effective theory that lead to a modified homogeneous dynamics , for the interior spacetime , may also modify the spacetime inhomogeneous structure @xcite . on the other hand , using the homogeneous techniques , only the interior spacetime carries quantum effects while the outside is still described by a generalized vaidya metric of general relativity .",
    "some quantum effects are transported to the outside by matching at the boundary surface , which then enter the vaidya solution effectively through a non - standard energy - momentum tensor .",
    "this is still more indirect than considering a complete inhomogeneous quantization for the exterior region which may provide significant modifications to the spacetime structure .",
    "these effects may not be captured for a general vaidya mass in a spacetime line element @xcite .",
    "nonetheless , it is difficult to calculate such effects , and we are still far from a complete picture .",
