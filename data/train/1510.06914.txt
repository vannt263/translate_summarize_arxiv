    "in its formulation due to kohn and sham ( ks ) ,  @xcite density functional theory ( dft )  @xcite allows the computation of the ground state density and total energy of a many - particle system by solving a set of single particle schrdinger - like equations . within current approximations to the unknown exchange - correlation ( xc ) energy , this can be done with a computational cost that grows as a power of the number of particles , thus making ks - dft very attractive from a computational point of view and the ideal tool to study complex systems . the local spin density approximation ( lsda )  @xcite and its generalized gradient corrections ( ggas )  @xcite are the",
    "most widely used xc energy functionals .",
    "notwithstanding their capability to successfully predict the properties of a wide class of electronic systems , there are still many situations in which they perform poorly or even fail qualitatively .",
    "one such fundamental problem is the description of dispersion interactions .",
    "although one of the weakest , the dispersion interaction is ubiquitous and can add up to give a substantial contribution to the interaction energy in large assemblies of atoms and molecules thus becoming very important in systems like , for instance , biomolecules , adsorbates or nanomaterials .",
    "different solutions have been proposed to deal with weakly interacting systems in dft , ranging from semi - empirical approaches  @xcite to truly non - local and parameter - free functionals .",
    "@xcite    another class of materials for which standard density functional approximations ( dfas ) badly fail is represented by the strongly correlated systems .",
    "strong correlation is usually meant to refer to situations where multiple determinants associated with degeneracy or near degeneracy are needed and a single - particle picture becomes inadequate .",
    "this limitation leads , for instance , to a dramatic failure of standard ks methods when studying the dissociation of systems into open shell fragments , whose simplest and paradigmatic example is the stretched hydrogen molecule . however , this is not a failure of dft itself , but just a break - down of present dfas . in this respect",
    "many different corrective approaches have been developed for _ ab initio _",
    "calculations on strongly correlated systems ranging from self interaction correction  @xcite to exact - exchange and hybrid functionals  @xcite to dft+u .  @xcite    however , rather than introducing _",
    "ad hoc _ corrections to describe selected problems , it would be highly desirable to find a new class of functionals that perform uniformly better than the present ones as already happened passing from lda to ggas and more recently with the development of hybrid functionals . in this respect",
    "it is illuminating to start with the formally exact way of constructing the exchange and correlation functional using the adiabatic connection fluctuation - dissipation ( acfd ) theory .",
    "@xcite in this framework an exact expression for the exchange - correlation energy can be derived in terms of the density - density response functions of a continuous set of fictitious systems defining a path that couples the non - interacting ks system with the real many - body interacting one .",
    "the formalism thus provides a powerful theoretical framework for a systematic development of advanced functionals  @xcite but also a practical way to compute accurate correlation energies .",
    "moreover , all acfd methods treat the exchange energy exactly thus cancelling out the spurious self - interaction error present in the hartree energy , while the correlation energy is fully non - local and automatically includes van der waals interactions .",
    "although much more expensive than the simple approximations to it , a direct evaluation of the exact formula is also possible when the interacting density - density response function is given .",
    "a dyson - like equation linking the latter to its non - interacting counterpart can be derived from time dependent density functional theory ( tddft ) , but still requires a suitable approximation for the unknown exchange - correlation kernel , @xmath1.@xcite nevertheless it has been shown that using the random phase approximation ( rpa ) , i.e. , by completely neglecting the xc kernel , plus a local - density correction for short range correlation , leads to a qualitatively correct description of van der waals interactions ,  @xcite static correlation  @xcite and systems with mixed bonds.@xcite    on the other hand , the rpa total energy is far too negative  @xcite because of the well know overestimation of the correlation energy ;   @xcite moreover , the binding energy of van der waals systems is systematically underestimated and an erroneous repulsion hump appears in the dissociation curve of covalently bonded systems at intermediate distances .",
    "for an exhaustive review on the rpa see for instance refs .   and citations therein",
    ".    staying within the acfd framework , a rigorous possibility to address the shortcomings of rpa is to include a xc contribution to the kernel that appears in the dyson - like equation defining the interacting density - density response function . for a consistent description to first order in the electron - electron interaction , not only the coulomb kernel , defining rpa , but",
    "also an exchange contribution has to be taken into account .",
    "the frequency - dependent exact - exchange kernel , @xmath2 , has been derived by grling  @xcite from the time - dependent optimized effective potential ( tdoep ) method , by hellgren and von barth  @xcite from a variational formulation of many - body perturbation theory ( mbpt ) and more recently by us  @xcite from a perturbative approach along the adiabatic - connection path .",
    "the corresponding approximation for the density - density response function , named rpax , is obtained by solving the dyson equation approximating the xc kernel , @xmath1 , with its exact - exchange contribution , @xmath2 , and has been successfully used in the acfd formula to compute correlation energies of atoms  @xcite and molecules .",
    "@xcite in a recent work by us we showed that with a slight redefinition of the re - summation procedure one can overcome a severe deficiency of the rpax when it is applied to the low density regime of the electron gas and the stretched n@xmath0",
    "dimer.@xcite    in this work , we investigate the rpax for molecular dissociation of diatomic molecules with different types of chemical bonds .",
    "the binding energies as well as the entire potential energy surfaces are obtained .",
    "we study the weakly interacting kr@xmath0 and ar@xmath0 dimers which allows us to test how well the van der waals forces are described .",
    "we also study the be@xmath0 and mg@xmath0 dimers which are challenging due to the complex interplay between van der waals and covalent bonding forces .",
    "finally , we address the question of how well the rpax can describe strong correlation by analyzing the lih molecule .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . section  [ sect : theory ] briefly summarizes the basic equations of the acfd theory , the rpax approximation and the computational details of our calculations .",
    "results for dissociation curves and structural parameters of different kind of molecules are reported and discussed in sec .",
    "[ sect : res ] . in sec .",
    "[ sect : summ ] we give our conclusions .",
    "in this section we recall some basic ideas concerning the acfd theory as well as some technical aspects of the plane - wave and pseudopotential implementation of the rpa(x ) total energy .      within the acfd framework a formally exact expression for the exchange - correlation energy @xmath3 of an electronic system can be derived :  @xcite @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the density - density response function at imaginary frequency , @xmath6 , of a system whose electrons interact with a scaled coulomb interaction , @xmath7 , and move in a local potential chosen in such a way to keep the electronic density fixed to the ground state density of the fully interacting system ( @xmath8 ) . at @xmath9 ,",
    "the local potential is equal to the external potential ( usually the nuclear potential ) of the fully interacting system and @xmath10 coincides with the fully interacting hamiltonian while at @xmath11 the local potential coincides with the ks potential and @xmath12 is the ks hamiltonian .",
    "the exchange - correlation energy can be further separated into the ks exact - exchange energy , e@xmath13 and the correlation energy e@xmath14 .",
    "the former has the same expression as the hartree - fock exchange energy but is evaluated with the ks orbitals @xmath15 , @xmath16 it is easy to verify that it can be derived from eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) replacing @xmath17 with the non - interacting density response function @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath15 and @xmath20 are the ks eigenvalues , ks orbitals and occupation numbers , respectively . subtracting the ks exchange energy from eq .",
    "( [ eq1.1 ] ) the correlation energy @xmath21 is obtained in terms of linear density - density responses : @xmath22 \\right\\ }     \\label{eq1.3}\\ ] ] where @xmath23 is the coulomb kernel and tr indicates the integrals over spatial coordinates .    for @xmath24 the interacting density response function @xmath25",

    "spatial coordinate dependence is implicit in the matrix notation .",
    "when the xc kernel is specified one can thus determine a corresponding correlation energy via eq .",
    "( [ eq1.3 ] ) .",
    "alternatively , the interacting density response function can be obtained from many - body perturbation theory which allows truncation at arbitrary order and various re - summations of the higher order terms .",
    "for example , by truncating to first order we generate an approximation similar to the mp2 ( moller - plesset second order perturbation theory ) approximation.@xcite a different rpax re - summation based on a first order expansion of the irreducible polarisability was used in our previous work to eliminate a pathology in the original formulation of rpax.@xcite      the rpa and rpax correlation energies @xmath28 are obtained by solving the dyson equation  ( [ eq1.4 ] ) setting @xmath29 and @xmath30 , respectively , and inserting the result in the acfd formula .",
    "the rpa(x ) total energy is then defined as @xmath31 where @xmath32 , @xmath33 and @xmath34 are the ks kinetic , external and hartree energy , respectively . in this work",
    "we have also exploited alternative re - summations@xcite based on the rpax defined as @xmath35 with @xmath36 and @xmath37 both trpax and trpax have shown to give results either very similar to the original rpax or results which qualitatively improve upon the rpax . in particular",
    ", we observed that the break - down of the rpax approximation in the low density regime of the homogeneous electron gas and in the stretched nitrogen dimer is lifted by using the trpax and trpax resummations  @xcite .",
    "the difference between the rpax and the alternative resummations for @xmath38 lies in the treatment of the terms beyond first order in the coulomb interaction .",
    "crucial to the original rpax is the so - called exchange kernel which is defined as the functional derivative of the exchange oep potential .",
    "when inserted into the linear response equation it can be shown to exactly reproduce first order particle - hole and self - energy effects as defined within linear response time - dependent hartree - fock ( tdhf ) theory.@xcite however , higher orders can not be represented in terms of higher order particle - hole and self - energy diagrams and therefore a direct comparison between the rpax- and the tdhf response function can not be made .",
    "on the other hand , it is well known that tdhf produces a particle - hole interaction in solids that is too strong.@xcite this is to some extent compensated by the hf band structure which overestimates the quasi - particle gap .",
    "it can therefore be argued that the instabilities of the rpax response function that are not present in the tdhf response function are due to the fact that to higher orders the exchange kernel is not able to correctly balance the particle - hole attraction with a dft band structure that has an energy gap much smaller than the hf band structure .",
    "the use of trpax and trpax removes this type of instability by simply neglecting higher order particle - hole terms in the response function . in the cases where rpax is well - behaved we found that this procedure has only a minor effect on the total energies .    in this work we focus on systems with a rather large gap ( or on two - electron systems for which the exact - exchange kernel simply reduces to a half of the hartree kernel ) and we do not expect any critical behavior of the original rpax .",
    "nevertheless we tested all the alternative resummations for all the systems considered in this work finding additional cases ( be@xmath0 and mg@xmath0 which have a relatively small gap around equilibrium ) where the alternative resummations perform quantitatively better than the original rpax .",

    "different schemes for treating the @xmath40 limit are compared .",
    "see text for details . ]    in principle a fully self consistent field ( scf ) evaluation of the rpa(x ) energy can be done by relying on the optimized effective potential ( oep ) method which provides a way to compute the local multiplicative potential that minimizes a given orbital dependent energy functional .",
    "the first approximate rpa - potential calculations were performed on bulk materials.@xcite fully scf - rpa calculations have been performed for closed shell atoms  @xcite and simple molecules .",

    "the functional derivative of the rpax correlation energy was first calculated for spherical atoms  @xcite and recently for molecules .",
    "@xcite however , despite the efforts in trying to reduce the computational workload of rpa and rpax calculations , they still remain computationally very demanding . for this reason , most of the rpa / rpax calculations",
    "are limited to a post self - consistent correction where the xc energy is computed from the charge density obtained from a self - consistent calculation performed with a more traditional xc functional .",
    "the calculations of the rpa and rpax correlation energies presented in this work are based on an eigenvalue decomposition of the non - interacting response function and of its first order correction in the limit of vanishing electron - electron interaction , respectively .",
    "only a small number of eigenvalues contributes significantly to the decomposition meaning that accurate results for the rpa and rpax correlation energy can be obtained considering only the most relevant ones .",

    "both rpa and rpax are able to capture almost the full dissociation curve , as first shown in ref .  .",
    "more recently , it was shown that also the strong triple bond of the n@xmath0 dimer can be accurately captured by the trpax,@xcite for which only ccsd(t ) has been applied successfully so far.@xcite the common difficulty of h@xmath0 and n@xmath0 is the fact that they are composed of atoms with open shells , which results in a nearly degenerate situation as the bond is stretched .",
    "a similar situation occurs in the case of the lih molecule which is described by a covalent / ionic bond .",
    "in addition , lih is hetero - nuclear and as such the problem of charge delocalisation , as predicted by most functionals , is largely enhanced .",
    "as the lih bond breaks the electrons should , in an exact treatment , localize and form two neutral atoms . however , standard approximations allow the electrons to delocalise and form fractionally charged dissociation fragments .",
    "this failure of common dfas was first discussed in ref .   where it was linked to a missing derivative discontinuity of the xc functional and an associated step in the corresponding xc potential .",
    "in order to estimate this type of delocalisation error one can determine the amount of fractional charge a given functional predicts by means of a fractional charge analysis.@xcite the functional is extended to allow for densities that integrate to a non - integer particle number and the energy of the independent atoms are calculated as a function of particle number .",
    "the total energy of the combined system ( i.e. the molecule at infinite separation ) can then be determined as a function of the amount of charge on e.g. the h atom and the minimum can be located .",
    "we carried out such a fractional charge analysis for lih using the pbe , rpa and rpax functionals .",
    "the results can be found in fig .",
    "[ fig : lih - frac ] .",
    "notice that the pseudo potential approximation has been applied to the li - atom ( middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : lih - frac ] ) so we can not compare the total energy to the exact result .",

    "[ fig : lih - frac ] . as expected , at integer particle number rpa and rpax",
    "outperform the pbe .",
    "however , we also see that as soon as we deviate from an integer both rpa and rpax are smooth with a rather large curvature .",
    "as already found within the rpa  @xcite also within the rpax the derivative discontinuity is missing meaning that the inclusion of the exchange kernel does not improve the qualitative behavior of the rpa for fractional particle numbers . in the third panel we see that the rpax minimizes at 1.2 electrons on the h - atom which is a result comparable to those of the rpa and pbe .",
    "this result is perhaps not surprising since for two electrons the exx kernel is hartree - like and thus does not introduce any new correlation effects . if the rpax calculation for the lih molecule was performed self - consistently we would obtain 1.2 electrons on the h - atom in the dissociation limit .",
    "to be consistent when calculating the binding energy we should therefore subtract the value of the energy at this minimum and not the energy of the two atoms with integer particle numbers . in fig .",
    "[ fig : lih - be ] we have plotted the binding energy curve of lih with the energy in rpa and rpax evaluated using pbe orbitals . since the pbe functional minimizes at a value close to rpa(rpax ) we expect the result to be close to the self - consistent result .",
    "we see that , although rpax gives a better total energy ( not shown ) , the binding energy is slightly worse than rpa , still gives an improvement compared to pbe .",
    "the use of trpax does not improve the results much .",
    "the fact that rpa and rpax perform worse for lih as compared to the h@xmath0 is a result of the additional delocalisation error .",
    "we also notice a very slow convergence to the dissociation limit .",
    "the maximum of the hump has not been reached at 5  .",
    "this slow convergence can also be attributed to the delocalisation error as we will now further discuss .",
    "recently , fully self - consistent rpa was implemented within quantum espresso.@xcite however , in order to compare with exact results we decided to simplify the problem and model the lih molecule as a one - dimensional system with a softened coulomb interaction . for this problem we could use an implementation based on cubic splines as basis functions which is known to solve the optimized effective potential equation with high precision.@xcite to obtain the exact potential we used octopus.@xcite in fig .",
    "[ fig : lih - pot ] ( left ) we plot the full ks potential at a bond distance of @xmath65    in rpa , rpax and exx and compare the results to the exact potential .",
    "the bond midpoint is located at @xmath66 and the corresponding potential energy curves are shown in the inset .",
    "the rpa is in rather good agreement with the exact potential .",
    "it exhibits the correlation peak at the bond midpoint but it misses the step feature .",
    "the rpax is similar to rpa but with an overestimated bond midpoint peak .",
    "again the step feature is missing which is consistent with the missing derivative discontinuity in the xc energy .",
    "the large humps of the exx potential is a result of the large delocalisation error in exx which has been estimated to 1.4 electrons on the h - atom in previous works.@xcite    in order to understand the huge impact of the missing step or derivative discontinuity on the density we have also calculated the dipole moment of the lih molecule , see fig .",
    "[ fig : lih - pot ] ( right ) . in the exact treatment",
    "the dipole moment should tend to zero in the dissociation limit since the molecule dissociates into neutral atoms .",
    "due to the fact that approximate functionals produce fractional charges on the dissociation fragments the dipole moment will instead tend to infinity.@xcite indeed , this is exactly what we see for the approximations studied and the bond breaking transition is missing in the self - consistent density of the exx , rpa and rpax .",
    "we presented an assessment of rpa and rpax functionals on a set of diatomic molecules having chemical bonds of different nature . for weakly interacting systems we found that the inclusion of the exact - exchange kernel leads to a quantitative improvement with respect to the rpa results .",
    "the binding energy and the structural properties of ar@xmath0 and kr@xmath0 molecules show a significant improvement when moving from the rpa to the rpax approximation due to an improved description of the van der waals forces . for the binding energy curve of be@xmath0",
    "even if a better description of the dissociation region and a reduction of the hump at intermediate inter - atomic distances can be achieved within the trpax approximation , the binding energy is still far from the experimental results and a potential energy surface with two minima is obtained . on the other hand ,",
    "the dissociation curve of the mg@xmath0 molecule shows a much larger improvement passing from the rpa to the rpax approximation due to the increased van der waals character of the bond .",
    "the double minimum structure found at the rpa level is correctly removed by including the exact - exchange contribution to the kernel and a well behaved potential energy surface is recovered .",
    "a comparison between results for purely van der waals and mixed covalent - van der waals molecules reveals the difficulty of rpa and rpax functionals in describing situations where the energetic and structural properties of the system result from a delicate balance between bonding forces of different nature .",
    "nevertheless also in these difficult cases the long range part of the dissociation curves display a sensible improvement passing from the rpa to the rpax .",
    "finally , we addressed the problem of strong correlation by analysing the dissociation of the lih molecule .",
    "the rpa gives a qualitative improvement of the total energy as compared to standard density functionals .",
    "the inclusion of the exchange kernel within rpax further corrects the correlation energy and gives results in good agreement with experiment .",
    "the hump at intermediate bond distances remains , however , and is shown to be a symptom of a large error in the corresponding rpa / rpax densities .",
    "this error originates from a poor description of fractional charges and a missing derivative discontinuity within rpa and rpax .",
    "although in the present work we focused on molecular systems , for which exact reference data are available for comparison , the current approach can easily be extended to solids and surfaces . the additional computational workload required by the brillouin zone integration ( see eq .",
    "9 ) should be largely compensated by the reduced number of plane - waves associated to a much smaller unit cell .",
    "we therefore believe the application of the method to extended systems to be as computational demanding as the calculations presented here .",
    "work toward this goal is underway .",

    "<S> in a recent article [ phys . rev . b 90 , 125102 ( 2014 ) ] we showed that the random phase approximation with exchange ( rpax ) gives accurate total energies for a diverse set of systems including the high and low density regime of the homogeneous electron gas , the n@xmath0 molecule , and the h@xmath0 molecule at dissociation . in this work , we present results for the van der waals bonded ar@xmath0 and kr@xmath0 dimers and demonstrate that the rpax gives superior dispersion forces as compared to the rpa . </S>",
    "<S> we then show that this improved description is crucial for the bond formation of the mg@xmath0 molecule . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , the rpax performs better for the be@xmath0 dissociation curve at large nuclear separation but , similar to the rpa , fails around equilibrium due to the build up of a large repulsion hump . for the strongly correlated lih molecule at dissociation we have also calculated the rpax potential and find that the correlation peak at the bond mid - point is overestimated as compared to the rpa and the exact result . </S>",
    "<S> the step feature is missing and hence the delocalisation error is comparable to the rpa . </S>",
    "<S> this is further illustrated by a smooth energy versus fractional charge curve and a poor description of the lih dipole moment at dissociation . </S>"
