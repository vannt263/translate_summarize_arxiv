    "we account for the fact that @xmath87 terms in the action are enhanced numerically by including them at the same order as simple discretization effects .",
    "in fact , while it may seem ad hoc , @xmath88 is the _ standard _ s@xmath4pt power counting scheme .",
    "it is simply not traditionally written as such because standard s@xmath4pt calculations have only included @xmath89 taste - breaking discretization errors from the action , and have therefore not needed to contrast them with pure @xmath3 discretization effects .",
    "we also use conservative power - counting for the perturbative errors by assuming that 2-loop contributions are not significantly smaller than those from 1-loop diagrams .",
    "we emphasize that our scheme is _ phenomenologically based _ on the particular parameter values of current staggered simulations ",
    "simulations using significantly lighter quark masses or smaller lattice spacings would require a different scheme and result in a different s@xmath4pt expression for .",
    "we must determine all of the contributions at nlo in our power counting to @xmath90 , including the effects of perturbative matching and discretization errors .",

    "this task is not as daunting as it first seems given the extended power - counting scheme because it turns out that the only lo contribution to is of @xmath93 .",

    "this is crucial because in continuum @xmath4pt only depends on a single parameter @xcite , and our result must match the continuum one when @xmath96 . only the `` standard '' chiral operator contributes to at tree - level , and its contribution is of @xmath93 .",

    "there turn out to be nine such operators  the same as those which arise from perturbative operator mixing .",
    "finally , four - fermion operators from the staggered action that arise due to discretization effects can enter time - ordered products with the operator @xmath34 , effectively correcting the four - fermion vertex at @xmath89 .",
    "the diagram for this process is shown in figure  [ fig : actins ] .",
    "we must therefore determine the chiral operators which result from a _ combination _ of the four - fermion operator and the inserted four - fermion operator from the action .",

    "we note , however , that many of these chiral operators arise in more than one way and correspond to more than one quark level operator , so they actually have _ more than one undetermined coefficient_. we list the @xmath56 , @xmath97 , @xmath3 , and @xmath89 operators and their coefficients in table  [ tab : nlocoeff ] .",

    "the three coefficients can be separated in principle by carrying out simulations at more than one lattice spacing .",

    "such contributions are of nlo in our power - counting because of the factor of @xmath51 or @xmath52 in the coefficients and the further suppression of @xmath93 by the loop - momentum .",
    "we therefore do not need to consider wrong - taste operators with derivatives .",
    "the four - fermion operator @xmath34 is dimension 6 .",
    "as discussed in the previous subsection , it mixes with other dimension 6 operators on the lattice , but such mixing is due to gluon exchange and suppressed by @xmath51 .",
    "therefore the naively discretized version of the continuum operator , @xmath402 , generates the dominant contribution to the lattice @xmath403 matrix element , @xmath404 .",
    "however , many higher - dimension quark - level operators respect the _ same lattice symmetries _ as @xmath34 and thus can also contribute to on the lattice .",
    "dimension 7 and 8 quark - level operators are explicitly suppressed in the action relative to dimension 6 operators by factors of @xmath8 and @xmath62 , respectively , so they can map onto chiral operators which generate 1-loop contributions to at nlo .",
    "in fact , because @xmath405 in our power - counting , they are just as or more important than the dimension 6 operators which contribute through mixing . fortunately we need not go higher than dimension 8 at the quark - level because 1-loop contributions to from dimension 9 operators are at least @xmath406 and thus of higher than nlo .    at the quark level ,",
    "dimension 7 operators contain four fermions plus either a derivative or a factor of the quark mass matrix .",
    "however , all dimension 7 quark level operators turn out to be _ taste off - diagonal _ @xcite , and therefore can not contribute to any pgb processes of interest .",
    "thus we move on to dimension 8 quark - level operators , which contain four fermions plus two derivatives , two factors of the quark mass matrix , or one of each .",
    "dimension 8 operators with one derivative and one mass matrix must have a single nontrivial spin or taste matrix ( either @xmath123 or @xmath118 ) in order to contract up the free derivative index .",
    "such operators are either spin off - diagonal or taste off - diagonal ; both are irrelevant .",
    "dimension 8 operators with two mass matrices map onto chiral operators with at least two mass spurions . because they also carry a factor of @xmath62 from the action , such operators are of @xmath407 or higher in our power - counting and can be neglected .",
    "we therefore need only consider dimension 8 four - fermion operators with two derivatives that possess the same lattice symmetries as @xmath34 .",
    "enumerating all such operators would be a tedious exercise in staggered group theory .",
    "fortunately , this exercise is unnecessary if we start with all _ chiral _ operators which could contribute to at nlo and work backwards .",
    "all chiral operators which arise from dimension 8 quark - level operators automatically come with a power of @xmath62 .",
    "thus , in order to generate 1-loop contributions to at nlo , they can not contain any derivatives or be suppressed by additional powers of @xmath8 or @xmath50 .",
    "all of the operators listed in table  [ tab : tbops ] satisfy this condition .",
    "in fact , it turns out that there are no additional chiral operators which are invariant under @xmath26 and derivative - free .",
    "therefore all of the chiral operators in eqs .",
    "( [ eq : o1p ] ) and ( [ eq : o1i])-([eq : o3a ] ) should contribute to both through 1-loop mixing , suppressed by @xmath56 , and through dimension 8 operators , suppressed by @xmath3 .",
    "yet there is a subtlety  not all @xmath62 s are created equal .",
    "this is because , at the quark level , taste - changing four - fermion interactions require gluon exchange , and therefore have hidden powers of @xmath50 which do not appear explicitly in the chiral effective lagrangian , eq .",
    "( [ eq : chlag ] ) .",
    "we must therefore consider the @xmath408 operators in more detail to allow correct extrapolation of lattice data .",
    "in the case of matching the continuum version of @xmath34 onto dimension 8 lattice four - fermion operators , we want to find the dimension 8 operators that match onto with @xmath368 $ ] _ without _ gluon exchange , because they truly contribute at @xmath3 .",
    "any other dimension 8 operators contribute at @xmath409 or higher , and thus are of at least nnlo in our power counting . as discussed in both refs .",
    "@xcite and @xcite , lattice bilinears of different spins and tastes  mix \" with each other at tree - level in perturbation theory , but to all orders in @xmath8 , simply because of the fact that the spinor components of staggered fermions are spread out over a hypercube .",
    "fortunately , at tree - level , one can consider the two bilinears in each four - fermion operator separately .",
    "thus , in order to determine which four - fermion operators mix at @xmath3 , one needs only find _ which bilinears mix at @xmath410 , @xmath411 , and @xmath3_. the product of two @xmath411 bilinears , or of one @xmath410 and one @xmath3 bilinear , will be a four - fermion operator that mixes at @xmath3 .",
    "we do so using eqs .",
    "( 26 ) and ( 27 ) in ref .",
    "we find that the dimension 3 bilinear @xmath412 $ ] mixes with taste @xmath123 dimension 4 bilinears at @xmath411 .",
    "it also mixes with dimension 3 and 5 taste @xmath24 bilinears at @xmath410 and @xmath3 , respectively . because spin off - diagonal four - fermion operators can not contribute to pgb processes , we are restricted to multiplication of each of these bilinears by itself .",
    "for example , we can multiply the bilinear @xmath413 $ ] times itself to generate the four - fermion operator @xmath414 the above operator is simply a generalization of the dimension 6 four - fermion operator @xmath415 $ ] to dimension 8 .",
    "the derivatives give it the appropriate dimension , and allow it to have both @xmath329 rotational symmetry breaking ( @xmath416 ) and conserving ( @xmath417 ) pieces .",
    "it is clear now that the lattice version of @xmath34 really only mixes at @xmath3 with dimension 8 quark - level operators that have spin - taste structures @xmath415 $ ] , @xmath418 $ ] , @xmath419 $ ] , @xmath420 $ ] , and @xmath421 $ ] along with two derivatives .",
    "these lead to the four chiral operators @xmath422 , @xmath423 , @xmath424 , and @xmath425 . taste symmetry , corresponding to the piece of eq .  ( [ eq : dim8 ] ) with @xmath416 . ]",
    "we therefore conclude that their coefficients are of @xmath3 , while the rest of the operators enumerated this section can be neglected .",
    "this is summarized in the second column of table  [ tab : nlocoeff ] .",
    "the lattice operator mixing discussed in the past two subsections is not particularly intuitive because it is a stems from perturbation theory and complicated lattice symmetries .",
    "in contrast , the fact that operators from the staggered action modify the quark - level operator , @xmath34 , can be shown through a simple diagrammatic argument .",
    "consider the four - fermion @xmath34 and another four - fermion operator from the staggered action .",
    "two of the quarks in @xmath34 can contract with two of the quarks in the other operator to form a 1-loop diagram with four external quarks , as shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : actins ] .",
    "this produces a local operator in the chiral effective theory because the loop propagates over @xmath426 , rather than over @xmath427 .",
    "it corrects @xmath34 at @xmath89 because all of the dimension 6 four - fermion operators in the staggered action are taste - breaking .",
    "such @xmath89 corrections turn out to be numerically enhanced , however , so they are still of nlo in our power - counting .",
    "we must therefore determine all chiral operators produced by combining @xmath34 with each of the dimension 6 four - fermion operators in the staggered action .",
    "@xcite developed a method for combining four - fermion operators at the chiral level .",
    "essentially , one forms chirally invariant operators which contain two taste spurions from the first four - fermion operator and two from the second .",
    "@xmath34 has spin - taste structure @xmath420 $ ] , so the two taste spurions from @xmath34 must transform as in eq .",
    "( [ eq : vatrans ] ) .",
    "moreover , we learned in sec .",
    "[ app : lo ] that only operators with two left - handed ( or two right - handed ) taste spurions survive after taking the linear spin combination @xmath352 .",
    "in contrast , the four - fermion operator may have any spin  @xmath428 or @xmath234  combined with an appropriate taste to maintain overall @xmath26-invariance .",
    "furthermore , the two taste spurions from the inserted four - fermion operator must be _ flavor diagonal _ because the action does not change quark flavor .",
    "operators with spins @xmath123 or @xmath118 can have tastes @xmath429 or @xmath234 , and their taste spurions transform as eq .",
    "( [ eq : vatrans ] ) .",
    "generically , there are three possible ways of combining these spurions with those from @xmath34 : @xmath430 where `` p.c . ''",
    "indicates parity - conjugate . here",
    "the unprimed spurions are from @xmath34 and the primed are from the four - fermion operator in the staggered action .",
    "because the two @xmath350 s will ultimately have different off - diagonal flavor structures , they must be separated by at least one @xmath311-field on either side within a supertrace .",
    "we use this fact to eliminate a few operators .",
    "consequently , these spurion combinations only lead to two nontrivial generic chiral structures , shown at the top table  [ tab : insops ] . to produce operators which contribute to we",
    "let @xmath431 and @xmath432 or @xmath394 .",
    "it is easy to see that the chiral operators are trivial when the taste spurions from the quark - level operator in the action are just the identity .",
    "thus we are left with four new operators which contribute to with coefficients of @xmath89 : @xmath433          @xmath442 & @xmath377 & @xmath443 + @xmath383 & & @xmath444 + @xmath445 & @xmath377 & @xmath446 + @xmath383 & & @xmath447 + @xmath448 & @xmath377 & @xmath449 + @xmath383 & & @xmath450 + @xmath451 & @xmath377 & @xmath452 + @xmath383 & & @xmath453 +    operators with spins @xmath281 or @xmath24 can have tastes @xmath123 or @xmath118 . in this discussion because it ultimately leads to a subset of operators already generated by spins @xmath281 and @xmath24 . ]",
    "their chiral structure is as follows : @xmath454 where and the upper and lower signs correspond to spin s and p , respectively , so their taste spurions must transform as @xmath455 as before , there are three possible ways of combining these spurions with those from @xmath34 : @xmath456 these spurion combinations generate the four nontrivial chiral structures shown in the lower panel of table  [ tab : insops ] . in this case , to produce operators which contribute to we let @xmath431 and @xmath457 or @xmath458 . because two of the taste matrices are diagonal , the following ( and similar ) relations allow further simplification of the resulting operators : @xmath459 such simplification reveals that these operators are none other than other than @xmath241 and @xmath246  @xmath214 .",
    "however , here they have arisen through insertions of the staggered action rather than lattice operator mixing .    in principle , we must also consider insertions of the dimension 4 quark mass term , which can modify @xmath460 in a similar manner to the four - fermion operators already considered .",
    "the resulting chiral operators would contain the two taste spurions from @xmath34 and a mass spurion , and thus be of @xmath461 in our power - counting .",
    "however , it turns out that there are no such operators for quite a simple reason .",
    "recall that , since @xmath103 and @xmath104 are flavor off - diagonal , they must either be separated by a @xmath311-field on both sides or be in different supertraces , each with a @xmath311 .",
    "a single mass spurion is insufficient for meeting this criterion .",
    "therefore operators with mass spurions only contribute to at nlo through analytic terms , which we discuss next .",
    "we finally consider analytic nlo contributions to the @xmath0 matrix element , @xmath17 .",
    "many operators generate contributions with the same quark mass dependence ; it is unnecessary to separate them in fits to lattice data .",
    "thus rather than enumerating all possible operators , we can determine all linearly - independent functions of the quark masses , allowing symmetries to do much of the work .",
    "given our power - counting scheme , generically six types of operators can contribute to @xmath17 : @xmath462 where quotation marks indicate that @xmath62 can be interchanged with either @xmath52 , @xmath51 , or @xmath253 .",
    "we can immediately rule out contributions from @xmath463 operators because there are four derivatives but only two fields upon which they can act .",
    "we can also rule out nlo analytic contributions from @xmath464 operators . without derivatives or mass matrices",
    "the only possible matrix element from such operators is @xmath465 .",
    "however , this contribution does not vanish in the chiral limit , and therefore violates the @xmath26 symmetry possessed by @xmath34 , so it can not occur .",
    "effectively , @xmath26 forces all tree - level matrix elements between taste-_@xmath25 _ kaons to vanish in the chiral limit .",
    "mesons are lattice goldstone bosons , but we have nevertheless checked this result explicitly . ]",
    "determination of the nlo analytic contributions to @xmath17 from @xmath466 operators is also straightforward .",
    "the derivatives _ must _ act on the two external kaons , bringing down a factor of @xmath467 which becomes @xmath468 when the kaons are on - shell .",
    "therefore the first nlo analytic term in the expression for @xmath17 is @xmath469 where @xmath118 is an undetermined coefficient that is , in principle , suppressed by either @xmath62 , @xmath52 , @xmath51 , or @xmath253 . for fitting",
    "it is important to know whether or not @xmath118 does , in fact , depend upon all four expansion parameters .",
    "operators of @xmath470 come from mixing with dimension 8 operators .",
    "recall from appendix  [ app : dim8 ] that @xmath368 $ ] mixes with taste @xmath24 and taste @xmath123 operators at @xmath3 .",
    "the operator @xmath471 itself comes from a taste @xmath24 quark - level operator , so its coefficient , @xmath125 , receives a correction of @xmath3 .",
    "one can also easily map the quark - level operator @xmath369 $ ] onto a two - derivative chiral operator that contributes to @xmath17 at tree - level : @xmath472 although we lump all nlo analytic contributions to @xmath17 of the form @xmath473 together , we note that it _ would _",
    "be important to separate the correction to @xmath125 from the rest if one were to do a fit including some nnlo terms .",
    "operators of @xmath371 come from perturbative matching with all tastes of four - fermion operators on the lattice , which we discussed in appendix  [ app:1loop ] . as we just showed , mixing with taste @xmath24 four - fermion operators leads both to corrections to @xmath125 and to a new operator .",
    "this time they produce contributions to @xmath17 of the form @xmath474 .",
    "in contrast , operators of @xmath475 only come from perturbative matching with _ wrong - taste _ dimension 6 four - fermion operators . because wrong - taste operators can not contribute to @xmath17 at tree - level , however",
    ", there is no analytic contribution of the form @xmath476 .",
    "finally , operators of @xmath477 come from insertions with operators in the action .",
    "the insertion of @xmath34 with the taste - singlet dimension 6 four - fermion operator maps onto @xmath220 , but now at higher - order .",
    "thus there is an nlo analytic correction to @xmath125 , and therefore a contribution to @xmath17 , of the form @xmath478 .",
    "we summarize the parametric dependence of the coefficient @xmath118 in table  [ tab : analcoeff ] .",
    "determining the analytic nlo contributions to @xmath17 from the last three types of operators requires a bit more work . to do this , we utilize a symmetry of @xmath34 which has not been explicitly needed until now : _ cps symmetry _",
    "recall that , because @xmath34 is a weak operator , it is _ not _ parity - invariant , as is the strong chiral lagrangian .",
    "however , it _ is _ invariant under cps symmetry , and this can be used to restrict the chiral operators to which is corresponds .",
    "standard cps symmetry is cp plus @xmath479 and @xmath480 . in our case , because there are two sets of valence quarks , we must impose a modified cps symmetry with both @xmath481 and @xmath482 so as to make the quark - level operator invariant . at the chiral level",
    ", this corresponds to the following transformations : @xmath483 where the last line denotes an interchange of indices in both @xmath311 and @xmath484 .",
    "one can easily show that all of the operators enumerated in the previous subsections are already invariant under this series of transformations .",
    "however , cps symmetry will prove important for restricting the analytic contributions to @xmath17 .    first consider analytic contributions to @xmath17 from @xmath485 operators , which necessarily contain the two spurions from @xmath34 plus two mass spurions .",
    "because of the _ flavor _ structure of @xmath103 and @xmath104 , such operators will only produce nonvanishing tree - level matrix elements if one mass spurion is within each supertrace , e.g. : @xmath486 note that the second term in each operator is the cps conjugate of the first term .",
    "when contracted with an external @xmath357 and a @xmath30 , the first operator generates an analytic term proportional to @xmath487 , while the second generates one proportional to @xmath488 .",
    "we choose to combine these terms such that the new analytic contributions to @xmath17 at nlo are of the form @xmath489 note that the second term vanishes quadratically as @xmath490 .",
    "next consider @xmath491 operators which consist of the two spurions from @xmath34 , two lie derivatives , and a mass spurion . to produce a nonvanishing matrix element , each lie",
    "derivative must be in a separate supertrace with either @xmath103 or @xmath104 , e.g. : @xmath492 once again , these operators are cps - invariant .",
    "the first operator generates a term proportional to @xmath493 , while the second generates one proportional to @xmath494 .",
    "thus there is only one new analytic contribution to @xmath17 at nlo from such operators : @xmath495 lastly we consider @xmath496 operators .",
    "these contain two spurions from @xmath34 , possibly two flavor - diagonal taste spurions , and a mass spurion .",
    "thus their tree - level matrix elements are proportional to one power of the quark mass , for which there are three possibilities : @xmath497 , @xmath498 , and @xmath499 .",
    "however , @xmath500 is not cps - invariant , and @xmath501 is included in the parameter @xmath118 , so we need only consider analytic terms of the form @xmath502 .",
    "the factor @xmath499 always arises from the operator @xmath503 when @xmath504 , so the only operators that can produce tree - level contributions of the form @xmath502 are simply the previously enumerated @xmath3 , @xmath97 , @xmath56 , or @xmath89 operators multiplied by @xmath503 .",
    "however , @xmath408 operators can not generate tree - level contributions to @xmath17 because of the @xmath26 symmetry , so neither do these particular @xmath496 ones .",
    "many of the chiral operators enumerated in the previous sections come from multiple quark - level operators .",
    "thus they can have _ multiple coefficients _ , each multiplied by a different expansion parameter .",
    "while this does not affect the form of at nlo in s@xmath4pt , it certainly affects extrapolation of lattice data using multiple lattice spacings .",
    "thus , for ease of use , we summarize the dependence of the nlo operator coefficients on the various expansion parameters in table  [ tab : nlocoeff ] .",
    "all operators which come from 1-loop operator mixing have coefficients of @xmath97 , @xmath56 , or both , as described in section  [ app:1loop ] .",
    "operators which arise through mixing with dimension 8 four - fermion operators come in at @xmath3",
    ". finally , operators that arise from insertions of four - fermion operators are of @xmath505 .",
    "thus the various operators have anywhere between 1 and 4 independent undetermined coefficients .",
    "for example , @xmath246 has four coefficients , multiplied by @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath62 , and @xmath253 , respectively , whereas @xmath242 has a single coefficient multiplied by @xmath253 .",
