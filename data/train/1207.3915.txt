    "a _ pattern _ @xmath7 is a given small tree .",
    "we say that @xmath7 _ occurs _ in a tree @xmath8 if @xmath7 is a subtree of @xmath8 in the sense that the degree of each internal vertex ( of degree more than one ) of @xmath7 matches the degree of the corresponding vertex in @xmath8 , while each external vertex ( of degree one ) of @xmath7 matches a vertex of @xmath8 with an arbitrary degree .",
    "occasionally , we say that the pattern is in a tree instead of that the pattern occurs in a tree for abbreviation .",
    "let @xmath0 be the set of trees with @xmath1 vertices .",
    "if we use @xmath9 to denote the number of a given pattern @xmath7 in @xmath0 , then @xmath9 is a random variable with probability @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the number of such trees in @xmath0 that the number of pattern @xmath7 in each of the trees is @xmath12 , and @xmath13",
    ".    moreover , let @xmath14 be the set of rooted trees .",
    "we can also consider the number of a given pattern in @xmath14 .",
    "denote @xmath15 to be the random variable .",
    "the main work of this paper is to show that some random variable satisfies @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the random variable with standard normal distribution and @xmath18 means weak convergence .",
    "we then call this @xmath19 _ asymptotically normal_. moreover , if @xmath20 then @xmath19 is asymptotically normal with mean @xmath21 and variance @xmath22 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details .",
    "in fact , it was shown in @xcite that in @xmath14 the number @xmath15 of any given pattern is asymptotically normal with mean @xmath4 and variance @xmath5 , where @xmath23 and @xmath24 are some constants corresponding to the given pattern .",
    "but , for the set @xmath0 there is no such a result on normal distribution . in @xcite",
    ", the authors proved that for any given pattern in @xmath0 the limiting distribution has a density @xmath25 , where @xmath26 are some constants .",
    "the mean and variance of the number of any given pattern are still asymptotically @xmath27 and @xmath28 where the constants are the same as in @xmath14 .",
    "clearly , if one shows that @xmath29 , then the distribution is normal .",
    "for some special patterns , such as a star ( or a node with a given degree ) pattern @xcite , a double - star pattern @xcite , and a path pattern @xcite , the corresponding limiting distributions were proved to be normal . for some previous work we refer to robinson and schwenk @xcite . for more details , we refer to @xcite .",
    "however , for any given pattern kok in his thesis @xcite claimed that it seems much more difficult to demonstrate the normality . in this paper , we will solve this problem from a new point of view which is different from the existing ones .",
    "we study the number of different rooted trees of tree and get that for almost every tree of order @xmath1 the number of different rooted trees of the tree is @xmath30 .",
    "then , for any given pattern @xmath7 , since we already knew that the number of pattern @xmath7 in @xmath14 is asymptotically normal , as a consequence , in @xmath0 the limiting distribution for @xmath7 is also normal",
    ".    we organize this paper as follows . in section 2",
    ", we will introduce some basic knowledge that will be used in our proofs . in section 3",
    ", we will present the detailed proofs .",
    "we concentrate on the number of different rooted trees of a tree .",
    "section 4 is devoted to study the limiting distribution for any given pattern .",
    "analogous to patterns , for each tree @xmath8 we use @xmath31 to denote the number of different rooted trees of @xmath8 .",
    "clearly , @xmath31 is also a random variable in @xmath0 and notice that @xmath32 .",
    "we introduce the following two functions : @xmath33 @xmath34 where the coefficient @xmath11 denotes the number of such trees in @xmath0 that each of the trees has @xmath12 different rooted trees .",
    "clearly , @xmath35 .",
    "we always assume that every tree of @xmath0 is equally likely .",
    "then , @xmath36 .",
    "let @xmath37 be a tree in @xmath0 .",
    "an automorphism @xmath38 of @xmath37 is defined as @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are any two vertices in @xmath37 and @xmath42 is an edge of @xmath37 joining vertices @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "we call that two vertices @xmath43 and @xmath44 of @xmath37 are in the same vertex class if @xmath43 can be mapped to @xmath44 by some automorphism",
    ". clearly , this sets up an equivalence relation on the vertex set of @xmath37 , and hence the vertices in @xmath37 are partitioned into some classes .",
    "if we designate every vertex in a same vertex class to be the root , we shall get the same rooted tree .",
    "exactly to say , suppose that @xmath40 can be mapped to @xmath41 under an automorphism @xmath38 of @xmath37 , and @xmath45 , @xmath46 are the two rooted trees of @xmath37 which rooted at @xmath40 and @xmath41 .",
    "one can easily illustrate that the automorphism @xmath38 is also an isomorphism that maps @xmath45 to @xmath46 .",
    "hence , the number of different rooted trees of a tree is exactly the number of vertex classes of the tree .",
    "then , let @xmath31 also represent the number of vertex classes of the tree under automorphisms .",
    "therefore , we can similarly introduce the random variable @xmath47 of vertex classes on the space of rooted trees @xmath14 .",
    "if we consider @xmath47 in @xmath14 , we also suppose that each tree in @xmath14 is equally likely .",
    "we can define similar generating functions on @xmath14 , and let @xmath48 , @xmath49 be the related functions , respectively .",
    "one can see that @xmath50 .",
    "suppose @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the number of rooted trees in @xmath14 that have @xmath12 vertex classes .",
    "it follows that in @xmath14 , @xmath53 where @xmath54 .    we should notice that when we count the number of vertex classes of a rooted tree , the root itself always forms a class with a single vertex , since any automorphism on a rooted tree must map the root to itself",
    "that is a bit different from the case for non - rooted trees .",
    "furthermore , suppose that the convergence radius of @xmath48 is @xmath55 .",
    "otter @xcite showed that @xmath55 satisfies that @xmath56 and the asymptotic expansion of @xmath48 is @xmath57 where @xmath58 and @xmath59 . and",
    ", @xmath60 has a similar expansion , namely , @xmath61 applying the transfer theorems in @xcite on eqs.([rexpa0 ] ) and ( [ t(x ) ] ) , we get that @xmath62 where @xmath63 and @xmath64 are some constants . for this , we refer to @xcite .",
    "it has been showed that @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "the book @xcite gives us more details on the transfer theorems .    in what follows",
    ", we first investigate @xmath67 in @xmath14 .",
    "to start with , we need the following two lemmas .",
    "we refer to @xcite for detailed information .",
    "[ main1 ] suppose that @xmath68 is an analytic function around @xmath69 such that @xmath70 , @xmath71 , @xmath72 and @xmath73",
    ". then there exist a neighborhood @xmath74 of @xmath75 , a neighborhood @xmath76 of @xmath77 and analytic functions @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 which are defined on @xmath74 , such that the only solutions @xmath81 with @xmath82 and @xmath83 are given by @xmath84 .",
    "furthermore , @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "[ main2 ] let @xmath87 denote a function defined on a neighborhood @xmath88 of @xmath75 , and @xmath89 .",
    "if @xmath90 is aperiodic , i.e. , if from @xmath91 with some power series @xmath92 it follows that @xmath93 and all the taylor coefficients of @xmath94 are non - negative , then there exists an @xmath95 such that @xmath87 can be analytically continuous in @xmath96 moreover , if @xmath97x^n$ ] and @xmath98 , then @xmath99 and if @xmath100 , we get that @xmath67 is asymptotically normal with mean @xmath21 and variance @xmath22 .",
    "* remark : * in @xcite and @xcite , the authors always assumed that all the taylor coefficients of @xmath68 are non - negative and had the same conclusions .",
    "we can extend this condition to the above one : all the taylor coefficients of @xmath94 are non - negative .",
    "however , we can completely follow the steps of the proofs in @xcite and @xcite without any changes to show the above lemmas .",
    "hence , the proof will not be repeated here .",
    "now we concentrate on the number of vertex classes of a rooted tree .",
    "recalled that an automorphism of a rooted tree must map the root to itself , which is a bit different from an automorphism of a non - rooted tree , namely , the root always forms a vertex class with a single vertex .",
    "we shall show that @xmath47 is asymptotically normal with mean @xmath101 and variance @xmath102 in @xmath14 .",
    "in what follows , there appears an expression of the form @xmath103 ( or @xmath104 ) , which is the substitution of the counting series @xmath105 ( or @xmath106 ) into the cycle index @xmath107 of the symmetric group @xmath108 .",
    "this involves replacing each variable @xmath109 in @xmath107 by @xmath110 ( or @xmath111 ) .",
    "for instance , if @xmath112 , then @xmath113 and @xmath114 , @xmath115 .",
    "we refer to @xcite for details , where it was shown that @xmath116 the coefficient of @xmath117 in @xmath118 is the number of rooted trees of order @xmath119 whose roots have degree @xmath1 .",
    "multiplication of @xmath118 by @xmath120 corrects the power of @xmath120 so that @xmath117 in @xmath121 is the number of those trees with @xmath122 vertices .",
    "this expression @xmath118 follows from the plya enumeration theorem @xcite .",
    "analogously , we take the same procedure for @xmath49 in this paper .",
    "but , here we should notice that if the same two copies of a rooted tree with @xmath12 vertex classes connect to a root , then the number of vertex classes of the new rooted tree is @xmath123 , because there is only one new class , i.e. , the new root , which is different from the procedure for calculating the number of a given pattern .",
    "hence , we use @xmath124 to denote the generating function for @xmath12 copies of a rooted tree . and we can get @xmath125 where the modification term @xmath126 is a series with integral coefficients .    for instance , suppose that the tree has a root of degree @xmath127 . then , @xmath128 . we have @xmath52 choices to form a rooted tree with the same two branches . in @xmath129 the term @xmath130 denotes the number of such rooted trees .",
    "we should notice that the power @xmath131 must be corrected into @xmath12 which means that the number of vertex classes is still @xmath12 .",
    "but , in @xmath132 the term @xmath133 denotes the number of those rooted trees with two same branches .",
    "moreover , note that @xmath132 and @xmath134 are both with integral taylor coefficients .",
    "hence , there must be a modification term @xmath135 such that @xmath136 performs the generating function of the trees with roots of degree 2 . clearly , @xmath135 is a series with integral coefficients .",
    "we can see that for any number of branches , we have to modify the function when counting the numbers corresponding to the cases that some branches are the same .",
    "hence , in general , expression ( [ rrr ] ) follows .",
    "let @xmath137 , and @xmath138 here , the taylor coefficients of @xmath139 and @xmath43 may not be non - negative . recall that @xmath50 , that is , @xmath140 . recall also that there exists a real number @xmath55 such that @xmath56 and @xmath55 is the convergence radius .",
    "then , we have @xmath141 and @xmath142 which implies that @xmath143 . moreover , @xmath72 and @xmath73 .",
    "that is , all the conditions of lemma [ main1 ] hold . furthermore , we have that the taylor coefficients of @xmath144 are non - negative , because in @xmath145 all @xmath124 s ( @xmath146 ) are within non - negative taylor coefficients and the expression of @xmath145 has an exponential form .",
    "thus , by lemma [ main2 ] we have that the random variable @xmath47 is asymptotically normal with mean @xmath147 and variance @xmath148 where @xmath3 and @xmath149 are some constants . here",
    ", we just concentrate on the rooted trees .",
    "some researchers had considered the number of vertex classes of other kind of trees , such as phylogenetic trees @xcite , and the conclusion also points to an asymptotically normal distribution .    in this paper , we mainly focus on the overall property of a probability space . following the book @xcite",
    ", we will say that _ almost every _",
    "graph in a graph space @xmath150 has a certain property @xmath151 if the probability @xmath152 in @xmath150 converges to @xmath153 as @xmath1 tends to infinity . occasionally , we will say _ almost all _ instead of almost every .",
    "from chebyshev inequality @xmath154\\leq \\frac{var x_n}{n^{3/2}}\\rightarrow 0 \\mbox { as } n\\rightarrow \\infty,\\ ] ] it follows that for almost all rooted trees , @xmath155 , namely , @xmath156 .",
    "we can get that    [ riso ] for almost all rooted trees in @xmath14 , the number of vertex classes under automorphisms is @xmath157 .",
    "therefore , we can study the number of vertex classes in a tree . to get the final result",
    ", we need another property as follows .",
    "we have defined the number of vertex classes of a tree . and , we call a vertex _ fixed _ if this single vertex forms a class .",
    "[ tn2rn ] almost every tree in @xmath0 has more than @xmath158 fixed vertices .",
    "we prove this result by contradiction .",
    "suppose that @xmath159 is a subset of @xmath0 such that every tree @xmath160 in @xmath159 has at most @xmath158 fixed vertices .",
    "we first show that these fixed vertices form a subtree in @xmath160 .",
    "in fact , for any two fixed vertices @xmath161 and @xmath162 , they can only map to @xmath161 and @xmath162 among themselves , respectively .",
    "thus , any @xmath163-path maps to the @xmath163-path under any automorphism .",
    "so , all vertices in a @xmath163-path are fixed ones , that is , all the fixed vertices form a connected subgraph of @xmath160 .",
    "consequently , the fixed vertices induce a subtree @xmath164 of @xmath160 and @xmath165 .    if @xmath166 , then the tree @xmath160 has a symmetrical edge .",
    "the structure of @xmath160 is determined by one half of the vertices in @xmath160 .",
    "hence , the number of trees in @xmath0 having a symmetrical edge is at most @xmath167 , and @xmath168 , which completes the proof .",
    "then , we always suppose @xmath169 .",
    "let @xmath43 be a vertex in @xmath164 .",
    "suppose that @xmath170 is a subtree of @xmath160 attaching to @xmath43 such that all the vertices in @xmath170 are not in @xmath164 .",
    "suppose there are @xmath171 copies of @xmath170 after deleting @xmath43 .",
    "we have @xmath172 ; otherwise the vertex in @xmath170 connecting to @xmath43 is also a fixed vertex , a contradiction .",
    "if @xmath171 is even , we get rid of @xmath173 copies of @xmath170 , and if @xmath171 is odd , we get rid of @xmath174 copies of @xmath170 .",
    "we repeat this operation on all vertices in @xmath164 . at the end , this produces a new tree @xmath175 with at most @xmath176 vertices , and we denote the set of these new trees by @xmath177 .",
    "moreover , if we replace these @xmath178 copies of @xmath170 by a vertex , that is , we add some vertices to @xmath43 and different kinds of @xmath170 correspond to different vertices .",
    "thus , we construct another tree @xmath179 .",
    "observe that @xmath164 is a subtree of @xmath179 .",
    "we shall show that @xmath179 has at most @xmath180 vertices .",
    "color the vertices in @xmath179 corresponding to @xmath164 by black and the others by gray .",
    "we already knew that there are at most @xmath158 black vertices .",
    "let @xmath43 be a black vertex .",
    "if a gray vertex connecting to @xmath43 in @xmath179 represents just only one vertex of @xmath175 , then there is only one such vertex connecting to @xmath43 .",
    "one can see an example in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "hence , in @xmath179 there are at most @xmath181 gray vertices representing the subtrees of @xmath175 having a single vertex and at most @xmath182 gray vertices representing the other subtrees ( or forests ) having at least two vertices .",
    "consequently , we get that @xmath179 has at most @xmath183 vertices .     and @xmath175.,title=\"fig:\",height=226 ] +    moreover , we need the fact that the order of @xmath0 is asymptotically @xmath184 .",
    "so , the number of trees with at most @xmath1 vertices is asymptotically less than @xmath185 . in the above , we have built a map from @xmath159 to @xmath177 .",

    "we color these vertices in @xmath175 by black .",
    "notice that any tree in @xmath189 has at most @xmath158 vertices .",
    "then , the number of all subtrees within @xmath12 vertices in @xmath175 is less than @xmath190    we select one subtree @xmath164 , and color the vertices black .",
    "suppose that @xmath179 is the corresponding tree defined as above . for @xmath191 ,",
    "each gray vertex in @xmath179 connecting to @xmath43 corresponds to a kind of subtree @xmath170 .",
    "moreover , the number of @xmath170 can be odd or even in @xmath160 . from the structure of @xmath175",
    ", we reconstruct the tree @xmath160 from @xmath175 by deciding the number of @xmath170 to be odd or even . since the number of gray vertices is less than @xmath192 , we can get that there exist at most @xmath193 different @xmath160 s mapping to the same @xmath175 .    therefore , for trees in @xmath189 with @xmath12 vertices , at most @xmath194 trees in @xmath159 map to them . recall that each @xmath160 corresponds to some @xmath164 .",
    "then we have @xmath195    by stirling s approximation , i.e. , @xmath196 as @xmath197 , we can get that when @xmath1 is large enough , @xmath198 where @xmath199 is a constant .",

    "it is known that @xmath202 . recall that @xmath58 .",
    "consequently , @xmath203 .",
    "hence , in conclusion , we get that almost all trees do not belong to @xmath159 .",
    "the proof is thus complete .",
    "+ next , we proceed to estimate the number of different rooted trees of a tree from theorem [ riso ] and lemma [ tn2rn ] .",
