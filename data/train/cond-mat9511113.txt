    "the exact diagonalization of the hubbard model ( or the @xmath0 model ) on finite clusters has become one of the prominent techniques in the study of correlated electron systems @xcite .",
    "this technique has the advantage of treating the correlations on finite clusters without any approximation . since the hilbert space grows exponentially with cluster size one",
    "is limited , for the hubbard model , to clusters with up @xmath1 sites . by _ finite size corrections _",
    "one means the difference between the results obtained for the finite cluster and its ( unkown ) value in the thermodynamic limit , @xmath2 .",
    "the control of the finite size corrections poses a great challenge to the exact diagonalization technique , especially in the case of two dimensions ( 2d ) . in 1d , it is a standard procedure to plot the results systematically as a function of chain length , @xmath3 sites . in 2d , on the other side , where most calculations have been done up to now with either periodic or antiperiodic boundary conditions , it is difficult to estimate the finite size corrections by direct comparison of clusters of different sizes , for two reasons :    1 .",
    "the finite size corrections are often non - monotonic as a function of @xmath4 , due to strongly varying cluster geometries .",
    "2 .   the nominal density of particles , @xmath5 does normally not coincide for clusters of different sizes as the allowed number of particles @xmath6 is an integer .",
    "both of these two difficulties can be circumvented by a method introduced recently @xcite , the _ integration over boundary conditions _ ( ibc ) .",
    "the ibc circumvents the first of above difficulties by performing a grand - canonical integration over boundary conditions .",
    "it has been shown , that this procedure removes all those finite size corrections which are caused by the special geometry of the fermi - sea of the cluster @xcite .",
    "the _ grand - canonical _ approach then leads to the possibility of directly comparing the results for different @xmath4 with the _ same _ density @xmath7 , solving also the second of above difficulties .    in a previous publication @xcite",
    "the ibc had been introduced and some results for the hubbard model on very small clusters had been presented . here we want to study in detail how the finite size corrections can be estimated _ systematically _ within the ibc both at zero and at finite temperatures . for this purpose we will concentrate on the hubbard model , the same study could be performed , in principle , for the @xmath0 model or any other cluster hamiltonian .",
    "we consider the hubbard hamiltonian on a cluster with @xmath4 sites , @xmath8 where the symbol @xmath9 denotes pairs of n.n .",
    "sites and where the @xmath10 and the @xmath11 are the electron creation / destruction operators of spin @xmath12 respectively .",
    "the hopping amplitudes , @xmath13 \\label{t}\\ ] ] depend , in general , on phases @xmath14 , related to the boundary condition . in the following all energies will be measured in unities of @xmath15 .",
    "we will now give an account of the ibc for 1d , the generalization to 2d is then straightforward .",
    "in 1d we can choose the @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is the boundary condition .",
    "periodic and antiperiodic boundary conditions correspond to @xmath18 and @xmath19 respectively .",
    "the ibc technique needs the exact diagonalization of the cluster for any particle number @xmath20 and any @xmath17 . for any given @xmath21 one then calculates the free energy @xmath22 where @xmath23 is the inverse temperature , @xmath24 the chemical potential , @xmath25 the dimension of the hilbert space and the @xmath26 the eigenenergies .",
    "( @xmath27 depends on both on @xmath4 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "the total free energy of the cluster and the particle density @xmath29 $ ] are then given by the average @xmath30 and by @xmath31 .",
    "the free energy eq .",
    "( [ f_total ] ) obtained with the ibc technique is constructed in such a way that the finite size corrections _ vanish identically _ in the limit @xmath32 @xcite .",
    "one can understand this result most easily in momentum space , noting that the fermi - sea , as obtained by the ibc , has no finite size corrections for @xmath32 .",
    "this property of the ibc holds in any dimension and is especially important in 2d .",
    "the particle density @xmath7 can furthermore be tuned to _ any _ value , by choosing an appropiate @xmath24 , allowing to directly compare data from clusters with different @xmath4 .",
    "these properties distingish the ibc technique from other exact diagonalization studies employing a range of boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "the integration over boundary conditions , appearing in eq .",
    "( [ f_total ] ) , is replaced in actual calculations by a finite sum over @xmath33 equal - distant boundary conditions .",
    "indeed we will find further below that only a few @xmath33 are needed in order to already obtain most of the reduction in the finite size corrections .",
    "ground - state properties can be calculated , as usual , by the lanczos technique . with @xmath34 being the ground - state energy for a given @xmath21 and @xmath28",
    "one finds the estimate @xmath35 for the grand - canonical ground - state energy per site to be @xmath36 .",

    "[ 2d_u8 ] we have plotted results obtained for the 2d hubbard model with @xmath38 .",
    "the results for @xmath39 , corresponding to periodic boundary conditions only , differ typically by @xmath40 in between clusters with @xmath41 and @xmath1 sites . also shown in fig .",
    "[ 2d_u8 ] are the data obtained for @xmath42 @xcite . here",
    "the data differ only by @xmath43 in between @xmath41 and @xmath1 , an improvement by one order of magnitude . for comparision",
    "we have plotted also data obtained by projection monte carlo for a @xmath44 system with periodic boundary condition by furukawa and imada @xcite .",
    "( [ f_alpha ] ) for the free energy needs the knowledge of all eigenstates and can therefore be used only for very small sytems , typically up to @xmath45 for the hubbard model .",
    "several approximative methods have been developed for the numerical evaluation of thermodynamic properties of sytems with large hilbert spaces @xcite .",
    "here we use the _ kernel polynomial approximation _ ( kpa ) developed by silver and roeder @xcite , since it has a very good error control .",
    "one starts by scaling the hamiltonian so that the magnitude of all eigenenergies is less than unity .",
    "the grand - canonical partition function , @xmath46 $ ] , is then expressed as an integral over the density of states , @xmath47 , @xmath48 the density of states can be expanded in a set of orthogonal polyomials , here we take legendre polyomials , @xmath49 : @xmath50 with @xmath51 . using the orthogonality relations for legendre polynomials",
    "one can express the coefficients @xmath52 in term of the eigenstates of the hamiltonian , @xmath53 , via @xmath54 in practice one uses a finite @xmath55 .",
    "a finite values of @xmath56 leads to the well known gibbs oscillations in @xmath57 .",
    "the gibbs oscillations can be smoothed out by the replacement @xmath58 in ( [ d ] ) .",
    "the optimal functional form of the smoothing functions @xmath59 , with @xmath60 and @xmath61 , has been studied intensively in the literature @xcite .",
    "we use @xmath62 , with @xmath63 .    the number @xmath56 of polynomials necessary for an accurate representation of the density of states in ( [ d ] ) increases with decreasing temperature , @xmath64 .",
    "we have evaluated the specific heat @xmath65 for a 6-site hubbard chain with periodic boundary conditions exactly , via eq .",
    "( [ f_alpha ] ) , and via the kernel polynomial approximation with various @xmath56 .",
    "we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ 1d6 ] the results for ( a ) @xmath66 and ( b ) @xmath67 .",
    "f the kpa becomes asymptotically exact for large temperatures and any values of @xmath56 .",
    "a numerical accurate approximation to the specific heat for temperatures down to @xmath68 may be obtained with @xmath69 and @xmath70 , for @xmath66 and @xmath67 respectively .",
    "the large value , @xmath70 , needed for big @xmath71 s is the reason that all data presented further below will be for @xmath66 .",
    "formula ( [ a_l ] ) is clearly not useful for larger clusters .",
    "it has been observed @xcite that one can _ systematically _ approximate the trace occuring in the rhs side of ( [ a_l ] ) by sampling over @xmath72 random states @xmath73 , @xmath74 it is possible to evaluate ( [ a_random ] ) recursively , by a procedure very similar to the lanczos technique @xcite .",
    "the errors introduced by random averaging vanish like @xmath75 @xcite . we have performed extensive tests of the dependence of the data on @xmath72",
    "; we will present further below only data which are unaffected by finite-@xmath72 effects .",
    "in fig .  [ 1d_u2 ] we have plotted the results for the specific heat per site for various 1d chains of length @xmath76 , both for the case of periodic boundary conditions only , @xmath39 , and for @xmath77 .",
    "let us first note that the specific - heat curves for clusters of different sizes have eventually all to coincide at large enough temperatures , due to the grand - canonical formulation . at large enough temperatures the leading terms contributing to the specific heat of a cluster of a given size are identical to the leading terms of a high - temperature expansions .",
    "one can consequently define a @xmath78 as the temperature above which the finite size corrections to the specific heat are smaller than a given accuracy @xmath79 , say @xmath80 . as the specific heat for @xmath2",
    "is generally not known we took as a practical estimate for @xmath78 the criterium that @xmath81 for all @xmath82 .",
    "we found that @xmath78 is roughly inversely proportional to @xmath4 , for the 1d data presented in fig .",
    "[ 1d_u2 ] and that the integration over boundary conditions reduces @xmath78 by factors of @xmath83 , as it is evident from a comparison of fig .  [ 1d_u2](a ) and fig .  [ 1d_u2](b ) .",
    "the ibc improves the cluster estimates of the specific heat in a second way , besides the reduction of @xmath78 .",
    "one finds empirically that the specific heat becomes _ linear _ at low temperatures in the limit @xmath84 .",
    "this property of the low - t specific heat is present for all @xmath4 and is a consequence of the absence of those finite size corrections which are caused by the geometry of the fermi - surface of the cluster , within the ibc @xcite . for finite @xmath33 there will be in general an intermediate temperature range where the specific heat is roughly linear , like it is the case for @xmath77 in fig .  [",
    "1d_u2](b ) for temperatures",
    "this feature of the specific heat data obtained with the ibc may be used , e.g. , to estimate the inverse effective mass .    in fig .",
    "[ 2d_u2 ] we present the specific heat per site , as a function of temperature , for 2d clusters with @xmath86 , @xmath87 , @xmath88 and @xmath39 and @xmath89 .",
    "the improvement obtained with the ibc is even more pronounced than in 1d .",
    "the data for periodic boundary conditions is affected so much by finite size errors that is does not allow for a reliable estimate of the specific heat for @xmath90 . for @xmath89",
    "the finite size corrections are , on the other side , practically absent for @xmath91 .",
    "in conclusion we have shown that the integration over boundary conditions ( ibc ) can be used to reduce substantially the finite size corrections occuring in exact diagonalization studies .",
    "the data obtained by the ibc show typically a smooth behaviour as a function of cluster size , even in 2d where the cluster geometry may vary widely from cluster to cluster .",
    "this smooth behaviour often allows for _ quantitative _ estimates of the finite size corrections of the data obtained by the ibc , even in 2d .",
    "one obtains furthermore certain qualitative improvements with the ibc , like a linear specific heat for the hubbard model on one- and two dimensional clusters .          with this",
    "we mean that for @xmath32 the fermi surface of the thermodynamic limit is _ exactly _ reproduced by the ibc , for any finite cluster . at finite @xmath92",
