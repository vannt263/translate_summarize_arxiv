    "galaxies are the principle tracers of the global evolution of the star formation history , the metal enrichment , and the formation of dust in the universe .",
    "their detection at very high redshifts offers a unique glimpse of these physical processes during the earliest epochs of galaxy evolution .",
    "dust has been detected in several high - redshift galaxies @xcite , the current record being held by the dusty quasar qso j1120 + 0641 located at redshift @xmath2  @xcite .",
    "dust attenuates the intrinsic spectrum of the stellar population , affecting the various physical quantities derived from uv - optical observations .",
    "detection of dust through its extinction and emission is therefore essential in determining the properties of galaxies in the high - redshift universe .",
    "a gravitationally magnified galaxy , designated macs1149-jd was recently discovered at a photometric redshift of @xmath30.2 @xcite .",
    "the massive lensing cluster ( macs j1149.6 + 2223 ) , located at redshift 0.544 , provides a magnification factor of @xmath4 . assuming no extinction by dust , and correcting for magnification , the star formation rate ( sfr ) , the total stellar mass , and luminosity derived from the observed uv - optical ( uvo ) flux are about @xmath5  @xmath6  yr@xmath7 , @xmath8  @xmath6 , and @xmath9  @xmath10 , respectively , where @xmath11 is the lensing magnification normalized to the nominal value of 15 @xcite .",
    "however , uncertainties in fitting the spectral energy distribution ( sed ) of this galaxy allow the possibility of a certain amount of extinction @xcite .",
    "the goddard - iram superconducting 2  millimeter observer ( gismo ) camera at the iram 30 m telescope on pico veleta @xcite , spain was used to probe whether macs1149-jd has a rest frame far - infrared counterpart .",
    "the observations detected a 2  mm source with an intensity of @xmath12jy ( see figure  [ gismo ] ) .",
    "the observed offset of @xmath13 ( less than half the gismo beam ) is entirely consistent with this source being at the _ hst _ detected position of macs1149-jd .",
    "the rest wavelength is @xmath14  @xmath15 m , close to the peak of the dust emission in star forming galaxies .",
    "these observations strongly suggest that dust is present in this galaxy , however , further confirmations are needed to absolutely corroborate this association .",
    "observations using the sharc-2 submillimeter bolometer camera at the caltech submillimeter observatory yielded a 350  @xmath15 m  upper limit of @xmath16  mjy within an area consistent with the nominal position of macs1149-jd .    for sake of the current analysis we will assume the validity of this association , adopt the observed 2  mm flux as originating from macs1149-jd , and demonstrate the unique properties of any dust that may be forming in the high redshift universe .",
    "all fluxes and results of this paper are presented in the galaxy s rest frame with the adopted cosmological parameters @xmath17  km  s@xmath7  mpc@xmath7 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 @xcite , and a lensing magnification factor of 15 . with these cosmological parameters",
    "the age of the universe is @xmath20  myr at @xmath1 .",
    "in the absence of any starlight , dust would be in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) .",
    "this effect can be important at high redshifts where starlight and the cmb can have comparable energy densities @xcite .",
    "the gismo flux is the differential 2  mm flux with respect to the cmb emission .",
    "therefore , the observed 2  mm flux consists of only reradiated starlight .",
    "we characterize the ir spectrum by @xmath21 , the temperature that would be attained by the dust in the absence of the cmb , and by a mass absorption coefficient @xmath22 , that has a @xmath23 ( @xmath24 ) dependence at far - ir wavelengths and a value of 1.5  @xmath25  g@xmath7 at @xmath26  @xmath15 m  @xcite .",
    "the specific ir luminosity in the galaxy s rest frame is then given by : @xmath27\\ ] ] where @xmath28 , @xmath29 is the dust mass , and @xmath30  k is the cmb temperature at @xmath1 .",
    "@xmath31 is a function of the dust temperature and mass . with @xmath32@xmath15",
    "m ) normalized to the observed gismo flux , the dust temperature @xmath21 and dust mass are inversely related .",
    "the presence of dust significantly affects the properties of macs1149-jd  derived under the assumption that it is dust free , and constrains viable star formation scenarios for this galaxy .",
    "the panels of figure  [ sedfit ] depict the analysis used to constrain the star formation history ( sfh ) , the amount of dust obscuration and resulting infrared emission , and the mass of radiating dust , based on the available uvo data and adopted far - ir flux .",
    "two star formation histories , characterized by a delayed exponential star formation rate ( sfr ) , @xmath33 , were used in the analysis with values of @xmath34100 and 300  myr ( hereafter models @xmath35  and @xmath36 , respectively , see figure  [ sedfit]a ) .",
    "intrinsic stellar spectra were calculated using the stellar population synthesis code pgase @xcite with low - metallicity ( lowz ) and kroupa ( kr ) stellar initial mass functions ( imfs ) @xcite .",
    "the lowz imf is more heavily weighted towards the formation of massive stars , and its stellar population produces more uv radiation compared to its kroupa counterpart .",
    "its choice is motivated by the theoretical argument that inefficient cooling inhibits the fragmentation of protostellar clouds into smaller units @xcite , and by observed variations of the imf with stellar metallicity @xcite .",
    "figure  [ sedfit]b shows the spectra for @xmath37  @xmath6  yr@xmath7 .    for each star formation ( sf ) scenario , characterized by @xmath38 , @xmath39 , and a stellar imf , we calculated the amount of dust absorption needed to reproduce the observed uvo fluxes .",
    "the ratio between the observed and intrinsic flux is the escape probability at that given wavelength , which for a homogeneous sphere is given by @xcite : @xmath40   \\\\",
    "\\nonumber   p_{esc}(\\tau,0 ) & = & { 3\\over 4\\tau}\\ , [ 1-{1\\over",

    "the second expression corresponds to the case when @xmath43 .",
    "the albedo of small dust grains ( @xmath44  @xmath15 m ) is @xmath45 and @xmath46 for most scenarios . with these parameters , scattering will increase the escape probability by at most 20% , having only a minor effect on the conclusions of this paper .",
    "we assumed that the ir emission is only powered by stellar radiation , so that the dust giving rise to the ir emission is also responsible for the attenuation of the stellar emission .",
    "the reradiated ir luminosity , given by the integral of @xmath31 in eq .",
    "( 1 ) , must then be equal to that the starlight energy absorbed by the dust : @xmath47\\ , d\\nu\\ ] ] where @xmath48 is the intrinsic stellar luminosity .",
    "figure  [ sedfit]c illustrates this principle of energy balance for model @xmath36lowz for values of @xmath49 and 40  @xmath6  yr@xmath7 .",
    "the dust must correspondingly radiate at temperatures of 44 and 70  k , with dust masses of @xmath50 and @xmath51  @xmath6 , respectively .",
    "not all sf scenarios can fulfill the energy constraint . figure  [ sedfit]d plots the ir luminosity as a function of @xmath21 , and the absorbed stellar luminosity as a function of  @xmath39 .",
    "energy conservation requires @xmath52 ( red curve ) to be equal to @xmath53 ( green and blue curves ) .",
    "the gismo detection sets a lower limit on the dust luminosity regardless of the dust temperature .",
    "this constraint sets a corresponding lower limit on @xmath39 for each sf scenario ( see table 1 for details ) .",
    "an additional constraint on viable sf scenarios is that the dust mass giving rise to the uvo attenuation and the ir emission be produced within the allotted time of @xmath54  myr , taking possible grain destruction processes into account @xcite .",
    "dust in galaxies is produced in the ejecta of explosive core - collapse supernovae ( ccsne ) and in the quiescent winds of asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars which are not massive enough to end their life as ccsne .",
    "refractory elements locked up in dust are returned to the gas phase by thermal and kinetic sputtering and evaporative grain - grain collisional processes in supernova blast waves @xcite .",
    "star formation removes both , gas and dust from the ism .",
    "the equations governing the evolution of the dust and gas masses in the ism of galaxies were presented in @xcite . at high redshifts ,",
    "ccsne dominate the rate of dust production at a rate given by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is the imf - averaged dust yield in ccsne ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* table  2 for the maximum attainable dust yield as a function of stellar mass ) , and @xmath57 is the imf - dependent rate of ccsne .",
    "ccsne are also the main source of grain destruction in the ism , at a rate given by @xmath58 , where @xmath59 is the dust lifetime , given by @xcite : @xmath60 where @xmath61@xmath62 is the time - dependent total mass of refractory elements locked in dust that is returned back to the gas phase by a single supernova remnant , @xmath63@xmath64 @xmath61@xmath65 is the effective mass of interstellar gas that is totally cleared of dust , where @xmath66 is the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the ism , and @xmath67 is the total gas mass .",
    "the dust destruction rate is then given by : @xmath68 the value of @xmath63  is approximately time - independent and about equal to @xmath69  @xmath6  @xcite , and @xmath70 in the solar neighborhood @xcite .",
    "the total mass of dust destroyed by a single snr is therefore @xmath71  @xmath6 , significantly larger than the total @xmath72  @xmath6  of condensible elements in their ejecta . in the local universe ,",
    "ccsn are therefore net destroyers of interstellar dust .    in a dust - free galaxy ,",
    "ccsne are obviously net sources of interstellar dust .",
    "there is therefore a limiting value of @xmath73 for which the grain destruction rate by snr is balanced by their formation rate , assuming a 10% condensation efficiency in the ejecta .",
    "the initial rate of dust enrichment in a galaxy depends therefore on : ( 1 ) the stellar imf - a top - heavy imf will have a higher imf - averaged dust yield ; and ( 2 ) the evolution of the gas mass in the galaxy , which in the instantaneous recycling approximation is given by : @xmath74\\ , \\int_0^t\\psi(t')\\ , dt ' + \\left({dm_g\\over dt}\\right)_{inf}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 is the initial gas mass , @xmath76 and @xmath77 are , respectively , the imf - averaged ejecta and initial stellar mass , and @xmath78 is the infall rate of the gas into the galaxy .",
    "dust masses derived from evolutionary models depend on @xmath39 and @xmath63 , whereas dust masses derived from fitting the uvo - ir sed depend only on @xmath39 . figures  [ sedfit]e - f depict these two distinctly derived dust masses as a function of the stellar mass derived from the corresponding population synthesis and dust evolution models at @xmath79  myr , the epoch of observations .",
    "figure  [ sedfit]e represents the results for the lowz imf and an initial gas mass of @xmath80  @xmath6 , and figure  [ sedfit]f for the kroupa imf and an initial gas mass of @xmath81  @xmath6  with no infall .",
    "the solid black lines show the relation between @xmath29 and stellar mass for the dust evolutionary models with selected lines labeled by the value of @xmath63  ( in @xmath6 ) .",
    "tick marks along the lines indicate the values of @xmath39 .",
    "the models were calculated assuming that all refractory elements condensed in the mass outflow from agb stars , but that only 10% did in the ejecta of ccsn .",
    "the thick dashed lines show the derived dust masses in the absence of any grain destruction .",
    "the rate of grain destruction depends on the dust - to - gas mass ratio in the ism , and therefore on the choice of the initial mass of the gas reservoir .",
    "the line connecting the filled and open diamonds represents the relation between the dust mass derived from the sed fitting to the stellar mass derived from the population synthesis models .",
    "the diamonds are labeled by the value of @xmath39 .",
    "the hatched region gives the dust masses for all combinations of @xmath39 and @xmath63  considered in this paper .",
    "viable sf scenarios are those for which dust masses derived from sed fitting are equal to those derived from the evolutionary models ( hatched regions ) .",
    "the resulting constraints on the sf scenarios and dust and stellar masses are summarized in the 3rd and 4th column of table  1 .    in general",
    ", sf scenarios characterized by a lowz imf produce the inferred dust mass at lower sfr and lower stellar masses .",
    "scenarios that require low values of @xmath63  imply dust lifetimes that are significantly larger than those expected for a homogeneous ism , implying a clumpy ism @xcite .",
    "figure  [ dustvol ] depicts the evolution of the dust for different values of the sfr and the stellar imf , highlighting the role of the gas mass in determining the dust production rate .",
    "the models assume no infall , so the gas mass is only determined by its initial value and net consumption rate by stars .",
    "models with large initial gas masses produce dust at a higher rate than those with a lower initial gas mass .",
    "eventually , the dust - to - gas mass ratio will reach the critical value of @xmath82 after which the rate of grain destruction by ccsn exceeds the rate of dust formation in their ejecta .",
    "galaxies with large initial gas mass have therefore a faster rate of dust enrichment . however , they will also be rarer objects since lower mass galaxies are more readily assembled at @xmath83 than the more massive ones @xcite .",
    "the galaxy s intrinsic spectrum was forced to reproduce the observed uvo emission ( see figure  [ sedfit]c ) .",
    "it is therefore of interest to examine how the derived mass absorption coefficient of the dust compares with that of astrophysical dust grains .",
    "figure  [ kappa ] compares the wavelength dependence of @xmath22 with that of 0.01  @xmath15 m  radii silicate and amorphous carbon grains , with optical constants from @xcite .",
    "the mass absorption coefficient shows a sharp rise at @xmath84  @xmath15 m .",
    "the rise is similar to that of the silicate grains but at shorter wavelengths . a good match",
    "would require the galaxy to be at a somewhat lower redshift than that inferred from the uvo sed fitting .",
    "this suggests that young galaxies , in which silicates are the dominant dust component , will exhibit a sharp drop in their spectrum around 0.15  @xmath15 m  caused by this rising silicate uv opacity .",
    "this `` uv silicate break '' could be mistaken for an intrinsic lyman break at @xmath85  @xmath15 m , leading to an overestimate in the photometric redshift determination of galaxies .",
    "such galaxies may also exhibit a break in their ir spectrum that is associated with the 9.7 and 18  @xmath15 m  silicate absorption features .",
    "this `` ir silicate break '' can be used to photometrically select galaxies in the @xmath86 range @xcite , or to estimate the photometric redshift of high-@xmath87 galaxies .",
    "the evolution of dust at redshifts above @xmath88 differs fundamentally from that at lower redshifts : ( 1 ) at these redshifts , ccsne are the dominant sources of interstellar dust .",
    "the enrichment of the ism with carbon and carbon dust is delayed until the most efficient carbon producing agb stars have evolved off the main sequence .",
    "the composition of the ism and its dust may therefore be significantly different from that in lower redshift galaxies @xcite .",
    "the redshift interval over which this effect can be observable may be quite narrow , depending on the stellar imf and the mass range of carbon rich stars ; ( 2 ) at low metallicities , hence low dust - to - gas mass ratios , ccsne are net producers of interstellar dust .",
    "this is in sharp contrast to lower redshift galaxies , where ccsne destroy more dust than they produce , which has led to the suggestions that most of the interstellar dust in galaxies must be reconstituted by cold accretion in the ism @xcite ; ( 3 ) the efficient production of dust in the high - z universe is also greatly facilitated by the fact that at low - metallicities the stellar imf is biased towards the formation of massive stars , further reducing the relative importance of lower mass agb stars to the production of carbon in the early universe .",
    "analysis of the sed of macs1149-jd , including the 2  mm ( 190  @xmath15 m  restframe ) flux from its gismo counterpart , shows that dust formation proceeds at rapid rate at the earliest stages of galaxy evolution .",
    "dust masses of @xmath89  @xmath6  can be readily produced within 500  myr of evolution with sfr as low as @xmath90  @xmath6  yr@xmath7 , without the need to resort to growth in the ism .",
    "this dust exhibits a sharp rise in opacity at uv wavelengths around 0.15  @xmath15 m , characteristic of very small silicate grains expected to form in the ejecta of ccsne @xcite .",
    "the sharp rise produces a `` uv silicate break '' in the spectra of very young galaxies , which can be mistaken for a lyman break , leading to an overestimate of their photometric - based redshifts .",
    "the existence of high - redshift , actively star - forming , galaxies with little dust , such as himiko at @xmath91 @xcite , shows that the dust abundance in galaxies strongly depends on their star formation history , the efficiency of grain destruction processes , and the presence of gas infalls and dusty outflows .",
    "our analysis shows that dust can form following the death of the first massive stars , but its survival and abundance will depend on the particular physical processes operating in each individual galaxy .",
    "finally , independent confirmation of the association of the gismo  2 mm source with macs1149-jd , will render this galaxy the youngest dust forming galaxy , with profound implications for the onset of radiative , thermal , and chemical processes in the early universe .",
