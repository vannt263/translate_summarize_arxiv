    "a major effort in theoretical cosmology is a satisfactory explanation of the late - time acceleration of the universe .",
    "no convincing theory has yet been constructed to explain this state of affairs .",
    "the proposed models , characterized by a departure from conventional cosmology , either assume the existence of dark energy @xcite , or require a modification of general relativity at cosmological distance scales @xcite , ( cf .",
    "@xcite-@xcite for comprehensive reviews and references ) .",
    "less explored is the idea that the geometry of spacetime is not the so far assumed lorentz geometry ( see for example @xcite ) . in this circumstance",
    "we need not only look for a new idea , but also revisit every type of the old models from a new viewpoint .",
    "weyl geometry is certainly one candidate to be reviewed and reanalyzed . according to the ehlers , pirani and schild proposed set of axioms @xcite ,",
    "weyl geometry is the natural space - time structure that follows from a small number of basic assumptions of two observable quantities : the worldlines of light rays and free falling particles @xcite .",
    "we recall that a weyl space is a manifold endowed with a metric @xmath0 and a symmetric connection @xmath1 which are interrelated via @xmath2where the 1-form @xmath3 is customarily called weyl covariant vector field ( see for example @xcite and the appendix in @xcite for a detailed exposition of the techniques involved in weyl geometry ) .",
    "we denote by @xmath4 the levi - civita connection of the metric @xmath5 . if @xmath6 is a gradient , i.e. , if @xmath7 for some scalar function @xmath8 the corresponding space is called weyl integrable spacetime .",
    "integrable weyl geometry does not suffer from the so - called second clock effect and for that reason it has been used in some approaches to gravitation and cosmology @xcite-@xcite .",
    "in this short paper we study friedmann - robertson - walker ( frw ) cosmologies in a weyl framework .",
    "we demonstrate that the simple model based on the lagrangian ( [ action ] ) , may provide a mechanism of late accelerating expansion .",
    "the field equations obtained from the lagrangian @xmath9 in a weyl spacetime constitute the generalization of the einstein equations in vacuum ( cf .",
    "eqs ( 30 ) and ( 31 ) in @xcite ) .",
    "more general lagrangians have also been suggested , especially in the context of the palatini formalism , for example @xmath10 in @xcite ; @xmath11 gravity for frw models was investigated in @xcite ; see also @xcite for a formulation of a theory invariant with respect to weyl transformations and @xcite for the inclusion of torsion .",
    "there is however an alternative view , namely that the pair @xmath12 which defines the weyl spacetime also enters into the gravitational theory and therefore , the field @xmath13 must be contained in the lagrangian independently from @xmath14 in the case of integrable weyl geometry , i.e. when @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a scalar field , the pair @xmath17 constitutes the set of fundamental geometrical variables .",
    "we stress that the nature of the scalar field is purely geometric .",
    "a simple lagrangian involving the set @xmath18 is given by @xmath19where @xmath20 is a constant and @xmath21 corresponds to the lagrangian yielding the energy - momentum tensor of a perfect fluid .",
    "motivations for considering theory ( [ action ] ) can be found in @xcite ( see also @xcite for a multidimensional approach and @xcite for an extension of ( [ action ] ) to include an exponential potential function of @xmath22 ) .",
    "the inclusion of the term @xmath23 in the lagrangian is not an arbitrary choice , as is explained in @xcite .",
    "in fact , apart from the scalar curvature @xmath24 there are two invariants with dimension of inverse squared length that can be constructed with the fundamental geometrical variables of a weyl space : @xmath25 and @xmath26 now the derivative operator @xmath27 can be expressed in terms of the levi - civita derivative operator @xmath28 so that , @xmath29 ( see the list of identities in the appendix in @xcite )",
    ". therefore the two invariants reduce to one .",
    "we conclude that the simplest vacuum lagrangian constructed from purely geometric quantities has the form @xmath30 .    by varying the action corresponding to ( [ action ] ) with respect to both @xmath31 and @xmath32 one obtains @xcite @xmath33and@xmath34where the accent @xmath35 denotes a quantity formed with the levi - civita connection , @xmath4 . as mentioned above",
    ", ordinary matter described by @xmath36 is a perfect fluid with energy density @xmath37 and pressure @xmath38 . setting @xmath39we",
    "note that for @xmath40 the field equations are formally equivalent to general relativity with a massless scalar field coupled to a perfect fluid i.e. , the simple theory @xmath41 was analyzed in @xcite under the severe assumption of separate conservation of the two fluids .",
    "it was shown that for all frw models , the weyl fluid has a significant contribution only near the cosmological singularities . in expanding models",
    "the real  fluid always dominates at late times and therefore the contribution of the weyl fluid to the total energy - momentum tensor is important only at early times .",
    "similar results were obtained in @xcite , under the assumption of energy exchange between the two fluids . ] . on the other hand the case @xmath42 , is more interesting , because the weyl field @xmath32 plays the role of a phantom scalar field characterized by the wrong  sign of the kinetic term .",
    "we emphasize that the scalar field has a geometric nature in weyl spacetime and therefore , no restriction exists for the sign of the value of @xmath43 . in the following",
    "we consider only the case of positive @xmath43 .",
    "we assume an initially expanding frw universe with expansion scale factor @xmath44 and hubble function @xmath45 .",
    "we adopt the metric and curvature conventions of @xcite .",
    "an overdot denotes differentiation with respect to time @xmath46 and units have been chosen so that @xmath47 ordinary matter is described by a perfect fluid supplemented with an equation of state,@xmath48 the field equations ( [ nove ] ) and ( [ emsf ] ) imply the friedmann equation,@xmath49 with @xmath50 the raychaudhuri equation , @xmath51 the equation of motion of the scalar field , @xmath52 and the conservation equation , @xmath53    we introduce expansion - normalized variables @xmath54 and a new time variable @xmath55 defined by @xmath56 for flat , @xmath57 models the dynamical system becomes @xmath58 where a prime denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath55 .",
    "the evolution of the hubble function is described by the equation,@xmath59 which decouples from the rest of the evolution equations ( [ sys2 ] ) .",
    "this is one of the merits of the introduction of the variables ( [ expa ] ) , namely that it allows for the reduction of the dimension of the dynamical system by one .",
    "the constraint ( [ fri1jm ] ) takes the form @xmath60the last equation implies that the phase space of the dynamical system consists of a parabola in the @xmath61 plane , i.e. , it is one - dimensional .",
    "in fact , substituting ( [ const ] ) into the first of ( sys2 ) , we obtain the one - dimensional dynamical system @xmath62the only real equilibrium of ( [ sys1d ] ) is @xmath63this solution was also found by oliveira et al @xcite , in the context of inflation .",
    "it corresponds to a scaling \" solution where the energy density of the weyl field is a constant fraction of the total energy density .",
    "a plot of the polynomial right - hand side of ( [ sys1d ] ) shows that the equilibrium solution ( [ equi ] ) is _ globally asymptotically stable _",
    ", i.e. , @xmath64 _ is the future attractor of all solutions of ( [ sys1d])_.    , all models asymptotically expand with acceleration .",
    "the dark region corresponds to models entering a phase of late accelerating expansion and avoid the big rip singularity . ]",
    "the decceleration parameter @xmath65 at the equilibrium is given by @xmath66 in figure 1 the curve corresponding to @xmath67 separates the parameter space into two disjoint regions .",
    "the region below the parabolic curve , @xmath68 , contains the values of the parameters corresponding to accelerating expansion ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "it is evident that the simple model ( [ action ] ) allows for a late accelerated expansion of the universe for a wide range of the parameters .",
    "in models with minimally coupled phantom fields , the density of the dark energy increases with increasing scale factor and , both the scale factor and the phantom energy density can become infinite at a finite @xmath70 , a condition known as the big rip ,  not , seva , flnos . since the scale factor corresponding to the asymptotic solution ( [ equi ] ) evolves as @xmath71 flat frw models in ( [ action ] ) theory may avoid the big rip singularity provided that @xmath72 .",
    "we conclude that for any couple @xmath73 in ( [ q ] ) satisfying @xmath74 all initially expanding universes eventually enter a phase of accelerating expansion and avoid the big rip singularity .",
    "inclusion of curvature , @xmath75 increases the dimension of the dynamical system by one .",
    "however , it can be shown that the resulting models share the main feature of the flat model , namely that the state of the system asymptotically approaches a stable equilibrium corresponding to accelerating expansion .",
    "the results of this study are purely qualitative and therefore , further investigation is necessary to answer the question if the ( [ action ] ) theory may model the whole history of the universe .",
    "i thank n. spyrou and s. cotsakis for useful comments during the preparation of this work ."
