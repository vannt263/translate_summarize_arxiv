    "mass loss is inexorably linked to evolution for high - mass stars .",
    "in fact , it has a _",
    "deterministic _ influence , which in turn has tremendous impact on other areas of astronomy influenced by stellar feedback ( regulating star formation , galaxy evolution , chemical evolution , reionization , etc . ) . for most of their lives ,",
    "massive stars above @xmath020 @xmath1 shed mass in fast winds that affect their subsequent evolution , but in post - main sequence ( post - ms ) phases the mass loss becomes critical in determining the type of resulting supernova ( sn ) .",
    "the most dramatic mass loss in post - ms evolution is during the luminous blue variable ( lbv ) phase .",
    "some of the most pressing issues in massive star research concern resolving problems with mass - loss rates and how they are incorporated into evolutionary models , as well as the treatment ( or neglect ) of close binaries in these models ( see recent reviews by @xcite ) .",
    "a majority of massive stars are in binary systems whose separation is small enough that they will exchange mass @xcite . with current uncertainties in mass loss and mass transfer , connecting massive stars to their end fates as various types of sn explosions",
    "is still very challenging .",
    "lbvs and their eruptive mass loss have emerged as the linchpin in our paradigm for the evolution of single massive stars . in light of recent estimates of lower mass - loss rates for clumpy winds ,",
    "eruptive mass loss of lbvs would need to be the primary agent responsible for turning most h - rich o stars ( above @xmath030 - 35 @xmath1 , the upper limit for red supergiants ) into h - free wolf - rayet ( wr ) stars before they die as sne  ibc @xcite .",
    "however , our understanding of the physics and evolutionary states of lbvs is still poor , and their connection to ( or overlap with ) the evolution of close binary systems leaves many open questions . when ideas about lbvs were taking shape , @xcite discussed mass - transferring binaries and how they may provide suitable explanations for lbvs , but for whatever reason , these ideas did not appear to dominate the interpretation of lbvs and so they were mostly discussed as very massive single - stars .",
    "later , @xcite mentioned difficulties in explaining the formation of the nebula around @xmath2 carinae with a single star , although that paper did not discuss evolutionary aspects of lbvs .",
    "the role of binarity and initial mass in evolution is a central question we address here from a new perspective , by studying lbv environments .",
    "lbvs were recognized early - on as the brightest blue irregular variables in nearby spiral galaxies like m31 , m33 , and ngc  2403 @xcite , originally referred to as the `` hubble - sandage variables '' .",
    "famous galactic objects like p  cygni and @xmath2 carinae had spectacular outbursts in the 17th and 19th centuries , respectively , and appeared to share many of the same properties , so they were grouped together and called `` lbvs '' by @xcite .",
    "over a dozen true lbvs are now identified in the milky way ( mw ) and the large and small magellanic clouds ( lmc / smc ) , and a similar number resides in other local group galaxies @xcite . stars that spectroscopically resemble lbvs with similar luminosity and color , but which have not ( as yet ) been observed to show the signature eruptive variability of lbvs , are often called `` lbv candidates '' ; these are presumed to be temporarily dormant lbvs .",
    "the traditional view of lbvs , which emerged in the 1980s and 1990s , is that they correspond to a very brief _ transitional _ phase of evolution of the most massive single stars , when the star moves from core h burning , through the onset of h shell burning , to the core he burning phase @xcite .",
    "the motivation for a very brief phase comes from the fact that lbvs are extremely rare compared to o stars : the duration of the lbv phase is thought to be only a few 10@xmath3 yr @xcite based on this line of reasoning .",
    "10@xmath4 yr @xcite , but it is unclear if this longer lbv lifetime ( and shorter wr lifetime ) agrees with observed statistics . ]",
    "a typical and often quoted monotonic evolutionary scheme for a star of 60 - 100 @xmath1 initially is :    o star @xmath5 of / wnh @xmath5 lbv @xmath5 wn @xmath5 wc @xmath5 sn ibc .    in this scenario ,",
    "the strong mass - loss experienced by lbvs is a crucial component of the central paradigm of massive star evolution , which is that a star s own mass loss determines its evolution .",
    "high luminosity powers strong radiatively driven winds , and this wind mass loss propels the evolution that converts the most massive h - rich main - sequence stars to become h - free wr stars .",
    "this is the co - called `` conti scenario '' @xcite .",
    "lbvs are crucial to this picture because of the recent downward revisions of o - star mass - loss rates , as noted above ( see review by @xcite and many references therein ) .",
    "thus , single massive stars of 30 - 80 @xmath1 do not have strong enough winds to make wr stars on their own ; lbv eruptions are needed @xcite .",
    "( especially wnh stars ) , might be strong enough to make wr stars without an intervening lbv phase @xcite . in this case",
    ", the remaining he cores would be more massive than any observed h - free wr stars @xcite .",
    "such massive he stars might be rare , so this is not yet a solved issue . ]",
    "the lbv phase is still generally presumed to arise in the evolution of single stars @xcite , and it is _ required _ in the standard scenario for single massive - star evolution .",
    "the origin of the instability is not fully understood , but it is expected that the core luminosity goes up with time as the growing he core contracts , while winds steadily reduce the stellar mass .",
    "thus , the ratio @xmath6 goes up until the star confronts the classical eddington limit and somehow erupts with catastrophic mass loss @xcite . as seen in the case of @xmath2 car , these eruptions can eject 10 - 20 @xmath1 in a single event @xcite .",
    "while this traditional view of lbvs persisted through the 1990s @xcite , in the past decade or so , several problems have emerged that threaten it .",
    "one issue has to do with the interpretation of lbv variability and the behavior of their winds .",
    "the proposed interpretation was that during a standard s  dor eruption , the star brightens while staying at constant bolometric luminosity because its mass - loss rate is assumed to increase , which in turn initiates a cooler and brighter `` pseudo photosphere '' @xcite . however , quantitative spectroscopy has since revealed that mass - loss rates in s  dor outbursts do not increase enough to cause true pseudo photospheres @xcite , and the changes do not really occur at constant bolometric luminosity @xcite .",
    "instead , the brightening in an s  dor event is more akin to a pulsation or temporary inflation of the envelope , perhaps driven by the sub - surface fe opacity peak @xcite .    similarly , the traditional explanation for lbv giant eruptions was that they experience a substantial _ increase _ in their bolometric radiative luminosity ( for reasons unexplained ) that temporarily pushes them well above the classical eddington limit @xcite ; this necessarily initiates a super - eddington continuum - driven wind @xcite .",
    "however , several lines of evidence now point to an explosive mechanism driving lbv giant eruptions , instead of ( or in addition to ) a wind @xcite .",
    "moreover , spectra of the light echoes from @xmath2 car s 19th century great eruption seem inconsistent with a wind pseudo - photosphere @xcite .",
    "these considerations point to problems with our interpretation of the physics behind lbv eruptions , but even more serious problems have arisen with the traditional role played by lbvs in evolution .",
    "the first clear sign of something very fishy came from the recognition that eruptive lbvs are the most likely progenitors of a particular class of luminous narrow - lined sne with type  iin spectra ( sne  iin ) . the dense h - rich circumstellar material ( csm ) of some sne",
    "iin requires eruptive pre - sn mass loss akin to lbvs , and in some cases very large csm mass budgets ( see review by @xcite ) .",
    "other aspects of the csm around sne  iin point to wind variability reminiscent of lbvs @xcite .",
    "moreover , we now have four direct detections of lbv - like progenitors of sne  iin , including sn  1961v , sn  2005gl , sn  2010jl , and sn  2009ip ( @xcite ; see review by @xcite ) . in the traditional paradigm of single - star evolution ,",
    "massive lbvs are prohibited from exploding as sne  iin , because lbvs represent merely a brief intermediate phase after core - h burning and before core - he burning .",
    "they should still have 0.5 - 1 myr to live as a wr star , and should die without their h envelopes .",
    "another clue that something was seriously amiss came from `` sn impostors '' , which are thought to be lbv giant eruptions associated with very massive stars in external galaxies @xcite .",
    "for some nearby sn impostors , detections of their relatively low - luminosity dust - enshrouded progenitors , as well as the ages of surrounding stars , suggest either progenitors that are 10 - 15 @xmath1 bsgs / rsgs or even @xmath08 @xmath1 super - agb stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this is much lower than the initial masses attributed to eruptive lbvs , which are generally above 25 @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "the reason this is physically significant is because these lower - mass stars ( @xmath08 @xmath1 ) never approach the eddington limit in their normal evolution , but they appear to suffer lbv - like eruptions anyway .",
    "if they can do this , then the physical cause of the outbursts might not be related exclusively to high initial mass , but perhaps some other exotic mechanism ( collisions , mergers , etc . ) .",
    "additionally , anderson and collaborators @xcite examined the spatial correlation between various types of extragalactic sne or sn impostors , as compared to presumed indicators of youth such as h@xmath7 emission in their host galaxies . on the one hand",
    ", they found the expected result that sne  ii - p ( arising from 8 - 20 @xmath1 stars ; @xcite ) are less correlated with h@xmath7 than stripped - envelope sne .",
    "however , they also found the very surprising result that _ sn impostors and sne  iin are apparently even less correlated with star formation than sne ii - p_. this was curious , and motivated us to take another look at lbvs in the mw and lmc / smc .",
    "in this paper , we will argue that the likely solution to many of these problems with lbvs resides in binary evolution , and that the resulting sn kicks may be quite important in explaining their isolation .",
    "the idea that binary interaction influences the outcomes of stellar evolution is not a new one @xcite , and various aspects including sn kicks have been studied in theoretical work by several groups @xcite .",
    "uncertainty persists in the difficult problems of mass transfer and the subsequent evolution of the mass gainer .",
    "the way that lbvs may fit into this picture is disussed in more detail later in the paper .",
    "we begin with a discussion of the projected locations on the sky of classic galactic and magellanic cloud lbvs as compared to the locations of o - type stars (  2 ) .",
    "this includes a qualitative examination of the sites of individual lbvs , as well as a quantitative statistical comparison of the relative isolation of early , mid , and late - type o stars , wr stars , lbvs , b[e ] supergiants , and rsgs . for this statistical comparison ,",
    "we only consider stars in the lmc and smc , due to large distance and reddening uncertainties in the milky way . in ",
    "3 we discuss how these results are fundamentally incompatible with the standard monotonic evolutionary view of lbvs as the descendants of very massive single stars , and in  4 we argue for an alternative view of bifurcated evolutionary paths for massive stars ( where the `` bifurcation '' corresponds to mass donors and mass gainers ) . in  5 we discuss the environments of extragalactic sn impostors and sne .",
    "we end (  6 ) with an epilogue about why something so simple as the avoidance of ob - star clusters by lbvs was not emphasized before .    , but for the two confirmed lbvs in the smc.,width=268 ]",
    "in figures  [ fig : mw ] , [ fig : lmc ] , and [ fig : smc ] we present maps of o - type stars in the surrounding environments for several individual cases of well - studied lbvs .",
    "the positions of o - type stars are taken from the simbad databse .",
    "this depends on the spectral type listed in simbad , which in some cases contains errors . as a check",
    ", we also made similar plots using the very recently revised galactic o - star catalog @xcite . using this newer catalog ( not shown ) , some spectral types changed slightly ( for example , some b0 stars changed to late o - types and vice versa , and some o stars shifted from our early - type bin to late - type or vice versa ) , but this did not change the overall result described below where lbvs generally avoid clusters of o stars .",
    "it did not , for example , produce o - star clusters where there were none previously .",
    "for galactic lbvs we plot a projected size on the sky of @xmath83.8 deg , and for stars in the magellanic clouds we plot @xmath80.3 deg . in each case",
    "this represents ( very roughly ) the surrounding several 10@xmath9 pc of each lbv .",
    "this is the 2d location projected on the sky , which gives the lbvs the `` benefit of the doubt '' that they are actually at the same distance as the o - type stars seen near them on the sky .",
    "we did not attempt to correct for distances along the line - of - sight to further cull the sample of o - type stars , because that may introduce a bias .",
    "for example , in many cases , such as milky way lbvs whose distances are based on radial velocities , the distance adopted might be substantially wrong if the star has a peculiar velocity .",
    "since our main finding is that lbvs are relatively isolated , treating all stars projected on the sky as being at the same distance is conservative .",
    "[ cols=\"<,<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     notes : + p1 = ks p - value for separations to the nearest o star .",
    "+ p2 = ks p - value for separations to the second - nearest o star .",
    "+    [ tab : ks ]      the large fraction of lbvs that appear isolated should sound alarm bells for anyone familiar with the traditional view of lbvs as `` massive stars in transition '' , just having finished core - h burning and soon moving on to he burning as wr stars . upon comparing positions of o - type stars to the coordinates of known lbvs",
    ", the result is astonishing . basically , _",
    "lbvs systematically avoid clusters of o - type stars , and they are rarely associated with o - type stars of similar ( presumed ) initial mass_. this is the opposite of what is expected in the standard paradigm of massive star evolution where lbvs are the immediate descendants of the most massive o stars , and the predecessors of luminous wr stars .",
    "[ fig : cum ] and [ fig : cum2 ] indicate that the vast majority of o - type stars are indeed in highly clustered environments .",
    "wr stars are significantly more dispersed , consistent with their more evolved status .",
    "lbvs should be intermediate between o stars and wr stars , but in fact they are more isolated than wr stars .",
    "this requires that they are older , on average , than wr stars , which in turn implies that they arise either from lower initial masses ( longer core - h burning lifetimes ) , that they are a more advanced evolutionary state than wr stars ( improbable based on chemical composition ) , or that some mechanism has systematically removed them from clusters without disturbing other massive stars .",
    "initial masses implied by lbv environments differ considerably from other inferences about their likely initial masses based primarily on turnoff masses and ages of nearby stars .",
    "( actually , there have been very few studies of the ages and masses of lbvs based on their environments , perhaps reflecting the fact that many of them are not in clusters where this is usually done . )",
    "@xmath2 car is located in the tr16 cluster .",
    "tr16 is inferred to have an age of @xmath03 myr , which is , however , based largely on the fact that @xmath2 car itself has not yet gone sn . excluding @xmath2 car",
    ", tr16 has a turnoff mass of roughly 80 - 100 @xmath1 , which is significantly below the presumed initial mass of @xmath2 car itself  although perhaps consistent enough that it does not immediately raise questions , due to the similar main - sequence lifetimes of very massive stars at @xmath10100 @xmath1 .",
    "based on studying ob associations in the lmc / smc and adopting characteristic turnoff masses for the earliest o - type stars in each , @xcite inferred initial masses of lbvs and wr stars .",
    "they favored an initial mass of @xmath1185 @xmath1 for the two lbvs in their study ( s  dor and r85 ) , and high initial masses for wr stars as well ( @xmath1170 @xmath1 in the smc , and 30 - 60 @xmath1 in the lmc ) .",
    "there are , however , two key effects that compromise this method of determining initial masses : ( 1 ) it requires that the cluster or association is coeval , but many of the regions studied have large age spreads compared to the lifetimes of very massive stars . for example , the association lh41 in which s  dor and r85 reside has a very large age spread ; while its most luminous members do suggest a turnoff mass around 85 @xmath1 by comparison to single - star evolutionary tracks , this same association also contains cool supergiants with initial masses of only 10 - 15 @xmath1 @xcite . ( 2 ) this method ignores important effects of binary evolution that corrupt the inferred turnoff mass ( see , e.g. , @xcite )",
    ". both binary mass transfer and binary mergers will produce luminous stars that repopulate the upper main sequence ( e.g. , @xcite ) . when compared to isochrones of single - star evolutionary models",
    ", these massive blue stragglers will imply an age younger than the true age of the cluster , and will overestimate the main - sequence turnoff mass .",
    "convolved with an age spread due to star formation that may be comparable to teh lifetimes of massive stars , this makes it difficult to use cluster turnoffs to estimate the initial masses of the most luminous evolved stars .",
    "looking at the spatial relationship between lbvs and other massive stars gives an independent and quantitative check on relative ages that does not have the same pitfalls as cluster turnoffs .",
    "if we assume that the vast majority of massive stars form in clusters ( indeed they do , as o - type stars are observed to be highly clustered in figure  [ fig : cum ] ) , then as the most massive stars explode early and the cluster spreads out due to random motions , the distribution of distances to a nearest neighboring o - type star must slowly and steadily increase with age .",
    "this method has no reliance on uncertain input physics of stellar evolution models or their neglect of binaries .",
    "it does not give a precise absolute age , but it does provide a reliable measure of the _ relative _ ages of different populations of massive stars .",
    "this method produces a very different result from cluster turnoffs @xcite .",
    "the relative isolation of lbvs is apparent in the mw as well as the lmc / smc , although only the lmc / smc produce a meaningful statistical analysis due to distance and reddening uncertainties in the mw .",
    "if there were only a few isolated lbvs , it would nt be so troubling because we might expect a few cases where the lbv was initially the most massive star in a small cluster that contains no other o - type stars .",
    "indeed , a few percent of o stars ( mostly late o - type stars ) appear to have been born in relative isolation ( e.g. , fig .",
    "[ fig : cum ] and @xcite )  but @xmath090% of early o - type stars _ are _ in clusters .",
    "lbvs are the opposite : only rare exceptions are found in clusters ( @xmath2 car and r127 ) and most of them are either in loose associations with large age spreads , or they are found 10s or even 100s of pc from other o - type stars .",
    "this isolation requires that lbvs are either very massive stars that for some reason were preferentially born well outside clusters ( hard to justify physically ) , or that they have lived longer than we expect based on single - star evolution and have systematically moved away from their birth environments .",
    "this can not be reconciled with the traditional view of lbvs in single - star evolution .",
    "as noted in the introduction , the current standard paradigm of massive - star evolution is that single massive o - type stars evolve into h - deficient wr stars by virtue of their own radiation - driven mass loss . for all but the most luminous and most massive stars",
    "( i.e. @xmath10100 @xmath1 ) that pass through a strong - winded wnh phase , accounting for clumping effects indicates that line - driven stellar winds are too weak to accomplish this ( see @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "thus , if lbvs are presumed to fit into the evolutionary sequence of single stars :    o star @xmath5 of / wnh @xmath5 lbv @xmath5 wn @xmath5 wc @xmath5 sn ibc ,    then enhanced eruptive lbv mass loss would be essential in order for single massive o - type stars to become wr stars @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the lbv phase is a very brief , fleeting transitional phase ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . in evolutionary models ,",
    "there is little time ( @xmath010@xmath4 yr ) after the end of core - h burning and before the onset of the wr phase when a star can be an lbv . in this short time interval",
    ", stars can not move very far , and so lbvs are expected to have a spatial distribution on the sky that is very similar to the o stars that are supposedly their immediate progenitors . for a typical velocity dispersion in a cluster of a few km s@xmath12 , a single star will move less than @xmath010 pc in 3 myr , and much less than 1 pc in 10@xmath13 yr . therefore , if early o - type stars are mostly in clusters ( they are ; see figs .",
    "[ fig : cum ] and [ fig : cum2 ] ) , then their immediate single - star descendants must be as well . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cum ] , the cumulative distribution of lbv separations should therefore be in between o - type stars and wn stars , and lbvs should be much more clustered than wc stars . in this paper",
    "we have shown that the opposite is true  that lbvs are surprisingly isolated from o stars .",
    "most critically , observations indicate that in terms of their separation from o - type stars , _ lbvs are even more isolated than wr stars ( both wn and wc ) .",
    "_    the observed population of lbvs therefore can not evolve into the observed population of wr stars , because lbvs would need to turn around and systematically move back toward clusters and associations in order to match the locations of wr stars .",
    "this can not be .",
    "the standard view of lbvs as single `` massive stars in transition '' is incompatible with observations of their locations , and must no longer be considered as a viable evolutionary scenario for the majority of massive stars .",
    "this rules out the monotonic evolutionary paradigm outlined above , making it difficult for single massive stars to become h - poor wr stars and sne  ibc ( because without lbv mass loss , their winds are nt strong enough ) .",
    "most often , the lbv phase must play a different role .",
    "a straightforward alternative is discussed next .",
    "the fact that lbvs are more isolated than wr stars , plus the fact that some stars appear to remain in an lbv phase until death as sne  iin ( see @xcite for a review ) , suggests an entirely different picture . instead of the monotonic evolutionary scheme for single stars discussed above , the spatial distributions discussed in this paper suggest that massive star populations and especially lbvs are dominated by bifurcated evolutionary trajectories :    o star @xmath5 @xmath14 }    \\rightarrow { \\rm sniin } & { \\rm ( gainer ) } \\end{cases}$ ] .    in this scenario ,",
    "o - type stars evolve off the main sequence , and through binary interaction the majority of massive stars either ( 1 ) lose their h envelope through mass transfer to a companion , become wr stars and die as stripped - envelope sne , or ( 2 ) gain mass from a companion , become bsgs , sgb[e]s , and lbvs , and then retain their h envelopes until they die as sne  iin .",
    "after the mass transfer phase , the subsequent evolution of the mass gainer may be quite varied , and so not all mass gainers will necessarily be lbvs and sne iin . in an insightful early paper ,",
    "@xcite discussed the fact that a few of the hubble - sandage variables in m31 appeared relatively isolated , and they suggested a similar binary mass - transfer scenario for these , while still favoring a single - star evolutionary scheme for most lbvs . here , we show that the environments of _ most _ lbvs violate the single - star picture , not just a few exceptions . instead of lbvs",
    "being a brief transitional phase for all very massive stars , they become the dominant late evolutionary phase for a subset of massive binaries .",
    "lbvs are rare enough that the fraction of stars which do this and for how long they remain in the lbv phase is poorly constrained observationally .",
    "( note that when the oversimplified , monotonic evolutionary scheme is abandoned , the number ratio of lbvs to o - type stars offers no meaningful constraint on the lbv duration without additional information . )",
    "[ fig : hrd ] shows the locations of lbvs on the hr diagram , mostly taken from @xcite , except as noted in the caption .",
    "the locations of lbvs are compared to standard evolutionary tracks for single stars , and also to an example of an evolutionary track for an interacting binary system from @xcite . using single - star evolution tracks as a reference",
    ", the initial masses of lbvs would appear to range from 30 - 40 @xmath1 for the lower - l lbvs , and from 50 - 250 @xmath1 or more for the classical high - luminosity lbvs .",
    "we infer from figure  [ fig : hrd ] are approximate .",
    "values of the luminosity depend on the analysis technique used for each star and the distance assumed , and there are multiple values available in the literature for several lbvs ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . ] a main point of our paper is that the isolated environments of lbvs are incompatible with the short lifetimes experienced by stars with such high initial mass , and they are incompatible with the key idea that most lbvs continue their evolution to wr stars .    instead , ascribing lbvs as the mass gainers in interacting binaries provides an attractive and plausible alternative . as noted earlier ,",
    "the plausibility of this basic idea was mentioned long ago @xcite , but did not become the dominant view . through the process of rlof , the mass gainer can substantially increase its mass and luminosity to resemble a star that had an initially much higher mass .",
    "one example is shown in fig .  [ fig : hrd ] , where a star with an initial mass of 14 @xmath1 accretes mass in a binary and ends up with a luminosity commensurate with a @xmath026 @xmath1 star @xcite .",
    "it is easy to see that such an evolutionary path could , in principle , give rise to the low - luminosity group of lbvs .",
    "similarly , somewhat more massive stars in binaries ( initial masses of 30 - 40 @xmath1 ) , could accrete mass to appear as 60 - 80 @xmath1 classical lbvs .",
    "one can imagine higher mass analogs of this that could correspond to the classical lbvs like ag  car and r127 .",
    "a crucial point is that this mass accretion and corresponding increase in luminosity may occur after a long delay , after both stars in the binary system have lived through much or all of their h - core burning main - sequence lifetimes . as initially lower mass stars",
    ", their core - h burning lifetimes may be much longer than the main - sequence lifetime expected for the more massive star that they become . as such",
    ", a mass gainer may appear younger than the population of stars around it . in cases where the discrepancy between the initial mass and @xmath15 is close to a factor of 2 ,",
    "the lifetime can be doubled for moderately massive stars ( 15 - 30 @xmath1 ) .",
    "for example , the approximate lifetimes of single stars of 15 and 30 @xmath1 initial mass are about 14 and 6.5 myr , respectively @xcite .",
    "if lbvs fit this role , then they are essentially evolved massive blue stragglers , not massive stars in transition .",
    "lbvs originating this way may help solve a number of issues that have been problematic for a single - star scenario :    \\1 .",
    "as noted above , the mass gainer will have a longer age than expected for its current mass and luminosity , helping to rectify the isolation of lbvs discussed in this paper and the initial mass discrepancy .",
    "in addition to becoming more massive and more luminous , the mass gainer will also gain angular momentum during rlof . this may cause lbvs to appear as rapid rotators late in life .",
    "a number of lbvs do exhibit properties consistent with rapid rotation @xcite .",
    "moreover , rotation has been inferred to be quite important in some ideas about lbv instability @xcite . in a single - star scenario , it is difficult to understand how they can shed large amounts of mass in steady winds while retaining their angular momentum .",
    "single - star models generally predict negligible rotational speeds for the lbv phase @xcite .",
    "this scenario also implies that a large fraction of the fast runaway stars that are kicked out of clusters by their companion s sn will be these rapidly rotating mass gainers ( i.e. there must be a fair number of them to account for the observed distribution of lbvs ) .",
    "it is not clear yet if this is the case , but further study of this may provide an important test",
    "rlof or other binary interaction may produce very asymmetric csm , as seen around many lbvs with bipolar or elliptical nebulae ( @xmath2 car , ag  car , hr  car , hd  168625 , etc . ) .",
    "using spectropolarimetry , equatorial distributions of csm around sne  iin have also been inferred @xcite .",
    "some of the more extreme observed asymmetries in the csm may be difficult to achieve with single stars .",
    "\\4 . removing the restriction that lbvs must transition into h - poor wr stars before they die",
    ", mass gainers might retain some of their h envelopes until death .",
    "this would reconcile the problem of lbvs exploding as sne  iin .",
    "the mass gained from a more evolved companion may be significantly enriched in nitrogen .",
    "this by itself does not necessarily argue against a single - star scenario if efficient mixing can bring n to the star s",
    "surface @xcite , but the n - enriched nebulae around lbvs are consistent with n enrichment in a binary mass - gainer scenario .",
    "similarly , the accretion of enriched material from a companion could help explain why lbv relative h / he abundances are similar to those of wn stars with h ( actually between those of very luminous wnh stars and other wn stars with h ; @xcite ) , even though their locations on the sky are very different .",
    "when their stripped - envelope companion explodes as a sn  ibc or iib , the mass - gainer star is likely to receive a kick .",
    "this provides an attractive explanation for why lbvs would preferentially and systematically seem to avoid star clusters , and adds to their longer lifetimes in explaining their observed isolation .",
    "even if they are born in clusters and live in associations for several myr , they may get kicked out of the cluster . because the initially more massive star will usually explode first",
    ", the kicked mass gainer may have a few more myr to live after that sn event .",
    "traveling at 50 - 100 km s@xmath12 , the star can move about 50 - 100 pc in 1 myr .",
    "such motion for only 1 - 2 myr is therefore sufficient to explain the relative isolation of most of the lbvs discussed here .",
    "it is important to recognize that the mass gainer may not exhibit the lbv instability immediately upon accreting mass , but is likely to do so in its own time when it finishes core - h burning and evolves to become a supergiant .",
    "( in the mean time , it will be a much hotter o - type star that is fainter in visual light ; thus , we would not expect bright lbvs to be seen at the positions of most sne  ibc , because it may take them another 10@xmath16 yr to evolve into their own supergiant phase . ) the delayed onset of the lbv phase may lead them to preferentially appear outside clusters . depending on how long it takes them to die , this may also lead sn impostor eruptions and the eventual sne  iin to appear isolated .",
    "even if they are a product of binary evolution , lbvs may appear as single stars if their companion has already exploded . in some cases ,",
    "of course , the close companion may not have exploded yet .",
    "if they were born in triple systems , they may still be in binaries .",
    "\\9 . in the mw , lmc / smc , and in other nearby galaxies",
    ", there is a large population of massive stars that resemble lbvs but that have not yet exhibited the eruptive lbv instability .",
    "these are usually called `` lbv candidates '' as noted earlier .",
    "@xcite find an order of magnitude more lbv candidates than bona fide lbvs in nearby galaxies , and massive dusty shells around massive stars in the mw suggest a similarly large number here @xcite . counting only lbvs ,",
    "their small number compared to o - type stars has been used to justify a very brief transitional phase ( e.g. , @xcite ) before becoming a wr star . however ,",
    "if lbv candidates are included in the count , the implied lbv lifetime becomes much longer ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in the bifurcated evolutionary scheme discussed above",
    ", the post main - sequence lifetime of the h - rich mass gainer is much longer than the lbv phase envisioned in single - star models , allowing lbv candidates to be the same stars as lbvs , if the lbv eruptive instability is only active for part of that time or in a subset of circumstances .",
    "in addition to mass accretion through rlof , stellar mergers or more exotic systems such as blue thorne - zytkow - like objects ( tzos ) might also yield some of the same results that are compatible with observed properties of lbvs ( overluminous or young compared to surrounding stars , rapid rotators , enriched and asymmetric csm , etc).10@xmath16 @xmath17 ) , rsgs do not exist .",
    "very luminous shell burning stars that would otherwise be luminous rsgs are thought to reside in the blue because of mass loss and instability in their outer envelopes .",
    "the same might apply to the envelopes of tzos in this high - luminosity range , if they exist .",
    "this is still speculative , but we mention it because blue tzos can not be ruled out for lbvs without more detailed study . ] the role of mergers in producing asymmetric csm , in particular , has been discussed extensively ( see review by @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "theoretical predictions for tzos are highly uncertain , and it remains difficult to rule out the possibility that some lbvs are merger products or blue tzos , especially those that may still be in clusters or associations .",
    "however , lacking a significant kick from a companion s sn , stellar mergers do not offer a compelling explanation for why the larger population of lbvs seem to systematically avoid clusters .",
    "so , what about the fates of single stars or binaries that merge early on the main sequence ? if lbvs are exclusively or mostly a binary phenomenon , then it becomes very unclear if wr stars can arise from single stars .",
    "perhaps rsg mass loss becomes critical .",
    "uncertainties ( in most cases overestimates ) in mass loss , plus errors in models that have arisen from comparing single - star models to binary populations , prohibit existing evolution models from making unique predictions ( again , see @xcite ) . with all known stellar mass black holes in binaries , there are few observational constraints on the end fates ( back hole or neutron star ; successful exoplosion or quiet collapse ) for truly single high - mass stars .",
    "a key conclusion from lbv environments as compared to other types of stars is that while lbvs are indeed very massive stars based on their current high luminosity , they did nt necessarily begin their lives that way .",
    "although this paper advocates a different origin for lbvs than is usually assumed , much of the traditionally discussed phenomena associated with lbvs may still apply .",
    "they are still stars with extreme mass loss and instability that have eruptive super - eddington winds or explosive mass loss ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "what is very different in the evolutionary scheme advocated above is the path by which the stars have come to be in their current state .",
    "hence , their initial masses and ages are very different than previously assumed .",
    "lbvs have been discussed as a normal transitional state for the most massive stars that have evolved to be in close proximity to the classical eddington limit .",
    "instead , we argue that in most cases they are stars that have become more luminous , rapidly rotating , and unstable as a consequence of mass accretion in a binary system ( or perhaps in some cases something more exotic , such as a merger or blue tzo ) . although the scenario suggested here does not solve the overarching mystery of the physical trigger of lbv eruptions , the evolutionary path to arrive at this point may be a critical part of the puzzle ( especially where angular momentum and stellar structure are concerned ) . this remains a challenge for future theoretical work .",
    "a clear message with broader significance is that cluster turnoffs analyzed with single - star model isochrones will systematically underestimate the age and overestimate the turnoff mass of clusters and associations , because the apparent turnoffs are contaminated by massive blue stragglers .",
    "this method is especially unreliable for very massive stars , where age spreads in clusters are comparable to their absolute age .",
    "similarly , we must be mindful of sn progenitors and their `` initial mass '' , as discussed next .",
    "evidence presented in recent years has begun to shift our central paradigm of massive star evolution . on the one hand ,",
    "wind mass - loss rates are lower than we used to think , while the close binary fraction among o - type stars is shown to be quite high ( roughly 2/3 are interacting , as noted in the introduction ) .",
    "the isolation of lbvs now seems to require a major shift .",
    "the interaction process of rlof or mergers has a profound impact on the types of evolved stars that are observed , and binarity must therefore also have a strong ( or dominant ) impact on the distribution of sn subtypes that mark the end fates of these massive stars  perhaps even moreso than metallicity dependent winds and initial mass , as has generally been assumed",
    ".    observed statistics of sn subtypes and other considerations already argue that binary rlof and not stellar winds must dominate the removal of the h envelope for most stripped - envelope sn progenitors @xcite , and binary population synthesis studies have suggested this for some time @xcite .",
    "there are too many sne  ibc and iib than there are stars initially massive enough to remove their h envelopes via their own winds . including sne  iib , the fraction of core - collapse sne that have stripped - envelope progenitors is @xmath036% , whereas stars that are luminous enough to shed their h envelopes through their own winds comprise only 10 - 15% of a normal sn - producing imf @xcite , or perhaps even less if some massive stars collapse to black holes without producing bright sne .",
    "interestingly , from the fraction of o stars that will interact and exchange mass , @xcite estimate that 1/3 is the approximate fraction of massive stars that we might expect to lose their h envelope in rlof . comparing this 33% to the observed value of 36% of ccsne that have stripped - envelope progenitors",
    ", there appears to be little wiggle room to allow massive single stars to die as sne  ibc .",
    "similar arguments in favor of binary progenitors have been made based on the mass and composition of the ejecta in stripped - envelope sne @xcite .",
    "a natural question arises .",
    "if binary rlof strips the h envelope to make most sne  iib , ib , and ic , then what happens to the mass - gainer companions of these stripped - envelope stars ?",
    "what do those mass - gainer stars look like , and which sne do they yield ? in a theoretical study , @xcite assumed that the spun - up mass gainers would experience enhanced rotational mixing and would undergo quasi - homogeneous chemical evolution , suggesting that they would die as h - free wr stars and possibly grbs .",
    "@xcite therefore inferred that there may be a population of relatively isolated wr stars and grbs . in this paper",
    "we have argued something different : that lbvs might be the direct products of mass transfer in binaries , and in particular , the mass gainers .",
    "( if this is correct , it may suggest that quasi - homogeneous chemical evolution may not be appropriate for these stars , but a further discussion is beyond the scope of this paper . )",
    "we have discussed above that this binary scenario alleviates the apparent paradox of lbvs exploding as sne  iin , which is prohibited in the standard single - star evolution framework ( although see @xcite for a possible caveat ) . if lbvs do indeed explode as sne  iin , then we should expect the relative isolation of lbvs discussed herein to be reflected in their resulting sne as well . as noted above ,",
    "if these stars receive a kick when a companion in the binary system explodes , they may travel 100 pc or more from their birthsites by the time they die .",
    "they should die at locations that are preferentially outside clusters , causing them to systematically avoid bright h  ii regions or blue star clusters . even without a kick , the extended lifetime of an lbv ( because its true initial mass was much lower than its apparent @xmath15 )",
    "would allow it to live much longer then the h  ii region that it might have been born in , since the massive stars that ionized the region may have long since died away .",
    "evidence consistent with this from observations of sn host environments has already been published in the literature , although the results were interpreted somewhat differently . as noted in the introduction , anderson and collaborators @xcite",
    "have found that sn  iin show a weaker association with h@xmath7 emission in host galaxies , as compared to sne  ibc , and their h@xmath7 association is more like that of sne  ii - p .",
    "those authors interpreted these results in a context where initial mass dominates sn types ; they attributed the correlation of sne  ibc with h@xmath7 to indicate the highest range of initial mass , and they interpreted the lack of correlation between sne  iin and h@xmath7 as indicating lower initial masses .",
    "they therefore concluded that lbvs are a less likely progenitor channel for sne  iin .    as we noted earlier , this result motivated us to examine the environments of nearby lbvs .",
    "we found that despite their high luminosities and initial masses higher than those of most rsgs , lbvs do actually appear to be very isolated from ob star clusters ( moreso than wr stars , and almost as isolated as rsgs ) .",
    "we have argued that this is most likely due to receiving a kick from a companion s sn that preferentially sends the mass gainers flying out of clusters .",
    "binary evolution will have an impact not only on the stars that are kicked ( in this case the lbvs and resulting sne  iin ) , but also on the mass donors that explode first .",
    "they ( in this case sne  ibc or iib ) will occur preferentially in young clusters as compared to other sn types that are found anywhere , and will be anticorrelated with those that are preferentially kicked out of clusters .",
    "thus , assuming that both sne  ibc and sne  iin come from a wide range of overlapping initial masses appears to be consistent with the data . because of the important influence of binary evolution , interpreting sn host invironments only in terms of progenitor initial mass is overly simple .",
    "some stars and certain types of sne can selectively move from their birthsites ; a theoretical study of the delay - time distributions and correlations ( or not ) with h  ii regions is needed to quantify this effect",
    ".    moreover , there are reasons why a correlation with h@xmath7 as adopted by anderson and collaborators is not necessarily a reliable indicator of extreme youth and the highest intial masses .",
    "that interpretation was criticized by @xcite , who pointed out that the brightest ( and therefore the most easily detected h  ii regions in distant galaxies ) are giant h  ii regions that are actually quite long lived ( @xmath020 myr ) , with ages comparable to the ages of stars with initial masses of only @xmath012  @xmath1 .",
    "anderson and collaborators have based their metric of association with h@xmath7 , and hence youth , as flux - depenent , so that a sn landing on a bright source of h@xmath7 is interpreted as younger than a sn landing on pixels with fainter h@xmath7 .",
    "in some sense this is backwards  the brightest h  ii region complexes are the longest lived ones with median ages @xmath1110 myr , whereas more isolated , smaller , and fainter h  ii regions are fleeting , and have shorter ages of only @xmath03 - 4 myr .",
    "therefore , finding a sn in a smaller isolated h  ii region is more likely to indicate a very high initial mass above 60 @xmath1 than if a sn is seen in a very bright and long - lived giant h  ii region complex @xcite .",
    "when these fainter and more isolated h  ii regions go preferentially undetected in ground - based imaging of distant galaxies , their associated sne may be mistakenly assumed to come from an older population .",
    "note that sn  1987a , with an initial mass of @xmath018 @xmath1 would have a high correlation with star formation as seen from a distant galaxy because of its proximity to 30 dor ( only @xmath01 at a distance of 50 mpc ) , whereas @xmath2 carinae would explode in the fainter carina nebula , which in some cases would not be detected .",
    "anderson et al .  have discussed potential biases in detecting various sn types and found that it does not strongly impact the trends in their observations , but there may be other selection effects besides those that govern the discovery of various sn types .",
    "for example , a metallicity bias may cause there to be more of some type of sn in the inner regions of a galaxy as compared to outer regions . in a typical spiral galaxy ,",
    "inner regions are more densely packed with star formation , and they have a larger fraction of the observed surface area covered by very bright h  ii regions than in the much sparser outer regions .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that sne  ibc in their sample were systematically found at smaller galactic radii than sne  ii .",
    "thus , even if sn types have the same range of progenitor initial mass , a type of sn that has a preference for smaller galactocentric radii because of metallicity may have a higher probably of coincidence with a very bright h  ii region .",
    "the potential influence of this bias deserves further attention .",
    "the sensitivity and potential bias in the flux - dependent h@xmath7 diagnostic used by anderson and collaborators @xcite may explain why their conclusions differed from other studies of sn host environments .",
    "earlier studies of spatial proximity to h  ii regions ( rather than the strength of h@xmath7 flux ) found no statistically significant preference between sne  ii and ibc @xcite",
    ". some of these might be chance coincidence with long - lived giant h  ii regions at relatively course ground - based angular resolution . in general",
    ", one expects no direct correlation between a sn and its own h  ii region for any but the most massive stars above 75  @xmath1 @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite found that high resolution _",
    "images for nearby sne with good constraints on the progenitor stars do not support a correlation with h  ii regions , and @xcite argued against the monotonic increasing progenitor mass from type  ii to iib to ibc based on this and a number of other considerations ( see also @xcite ) . when examining the sn host color at the location of sne rather than host h@xmath7 , @xcite found that sne  ibc , sne  ii , and sne  iin show basically the same distribution of @xmath18 colors .",
    "they did , however , find bluer colors for broad - lined sne  ic and sne  iib ; it is unlikely that this is due to initial mass , since progenitor detections suggest rather low masses for sne  iib .",
    "one may ask , if lbvs are the mass gainers that get a kick from their companion s sn  ibc in a cluster or association , then why do we not detect bright lbvs at the positions of sne  ibc ?",
    "the most likely answer is that the mass gainer will appear as a more luminous but hot o - type star that is still quite difficult to detect ( see figure  [ fig : hrd ] ) , and may not become a visually bright lbv until 1 - 2 myr later , when its own core evolution drives it off the main sequence to become a cooler b[e]/lbv supergiant . moreover , in the binary scenario , the majority of sne  ibc will be from relatively low initial masses , compared to the high - mass wr progenitors envisioned in the single - star scenario .",
    "overall , we find it likely that the sequential order of explosion in a binary system and subsequent kicks out of clusters ( and to a somewhat lesser extent , metallicity and star cluster density ) , plus the extended main sequence lifetime before mass accretion , will have a more important influence on the observed environments of core - collapse sne than monotonic differences in the range of initial mass .",
    "this may be especially true for more extreme or rare explosions that may require special evolutionary paths in binaries , such as long grbs @xcite .",
    "of course , the observed isolation of sne  iin might also be influenced to some degree by sn  iin progenitor contamination from non - lbv objects .",
    "indeed , there is strong evidence for this already , although the fraction of contamination is poorly constrained . in principle",
    ", any type of explosion can yield a type  iin event , since the iin designation depends on csm interaction and not the explosion mechanism . while lbv mass loss fits the bill @xcite , the case for lbvs is strongest for the most luminous sne iin where the csm mass budget requires extreme parameters @xcite .",
    "b[e ] supergiants are also suitable for providing moderate - luminosity sne  iin , and their spatial distribution is even more isolated than lbvs , comparable to rsgs ( figures [ fig : cum ] and [ fig : cum2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the concentration of eruptive mass loss associated with the final nuclear burning sequences in the last few years before core collapse @xcite means that the progenitor need not have been in a dense - wind phase for very long . besides massive lbvs exploding as sne  iin , there are also examples where sne  iin may result from : ( 1 ) extreme rsgs with strong clumpy winds @xcite , ( 2 ) electron - capture sne ( ecsne ) from 8 - 10 @xmath1 super - agb stars ( such as the class of sne  iin - p and possibly the crab nebula ; @xcite ) , and ( 3 ) some hybrid type ia / iin events that are apparently thermonuclear sne  ia exploding in a dense h - rich csm , like sn  2002ic and several similar objects @xcite .",
    "when these other objects having much lower mass progenitors are included with sne  iin , it would make the mixed population appear statistically even more isolated .",
    "this is the likely explanation for why @xcite found that sne  iin had a spatial distribution similar to sne  ii - p , even though we find lbvs have isolation intermediate between wr stars and rsgs .",
    "it is worth reiterating the point that not all mass gainers will become lbvs , since this likely depends on the mass accreted and final luminosity ( many may become b[e ] supergiants instead , or they may evolve to become rsgs , etc . ) , and not all mass gainers will necessarily become sne  iin , since these sne require special conditions ( pre - sn mass ejections ) . comparing the observed fraction of sne iin ( 89% of core collapse sne ; @xcite ) to theoretical expectations",
    "requires continued modeling of the evolution of mass gainers , which still depends on uncertain assumptions .",
    "in addition to core - collapse sne , caution about inferring an initial mass also applies to sn impostors and related transients .",
    "some eruptive transients have been discussed where the apparent age of surrounding stellar population indicates a surprisingly low initial mass .",
    "the most representative cases are sn  2008s and the 2008 transient in ngc  300 @xcite . if lbvs or lower - mass analogs preferentially receive a kick from an exploded companion , then this needs to be included in the uncertainty when inferring an age and initial mass from their surrounding stellar populations .",
    "one last important consequence to mention is that stars with initial masses below 8 @xmath1 may , if in a binary system , accrete mass and explode as a ccsn or an electron - capture sn , even if their initial mass would have precluded that fate in a single - star scenario . due to the slope of the imf , these initially lower - mass stars",
    "may potentially contribute a substantial number of observed sne .",
    "we encourage a detailed study of this effect , including the delay time distribution and its contribution to sn statistics .",
    "this paper suggests a major reversal in our interpretation of the nature of lbvs . instead of being the result of instability in very massive single stars that have evolved to become unstable through their own core evolution and mass loss , they must preferentially or exclusively be the products of binary evolution .",
    "they are most likely the mass gainers in binary rlof or mergers because their ages and initial masses ( inferred from single - star evolution tracks ) systematically disgree with the stars around them . while counter arguments can point to one or two possible exceptions",
    ", this must apply to most of the lbvs .",
    "why was this seemingly obvious result missed ?",
    "the answer may be partly sociological : lbvs are very few in number , and @xmath2 car garners disproportionate attention , so its location in the carina nebula did not arouse suspicion .",
    "also , interest in lbvs has concentrated more on driving their eruptive mass loss , as opposed to the evolutionary history that led them to be unstable in the first place .",
    "last , lbvs seem to fit nicely into the picture of single - star evolution ( and indeed they are needed for it ) , so the question of whether or not their environments contradict models was not pursued with adequate vigor .    actually , a suggestive result along similar lines was found more than a decade ago by n.l .",
    "king and collaborators ( 2000 ; see also @xcite , as well as @xcite ) . based on environments of some candidate lbvs in m31",
    ", it was found that they seem to reside outside ob associations and clusters , implying stellar ages of several myr .",
    "that work did not instigate a major rethinking of our standard paradigm of massive star evolution because the paper was not accepted for publication in the refereed literature ( the first author has since left the field ) . in hindsight",
    ", the main result of that work appears to have pointed in the correct direction after all .",
