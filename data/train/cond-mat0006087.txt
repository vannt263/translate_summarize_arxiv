    "we propose a new , easy , and more transparent access to the thermodynamics and especially to phase transitions which applies also to `` small '' systems .",
    "only the static geometrical and topological properties of the volume of energy - shell of the n - body phase - space is investigated . _",

    "first order transitions are distinguished from continuous transitions by the appearance of phase - separations . here",
    "the system becomes inhomogeneous and coexistent phases are separated by interfaces .",
    "any system at phase separation is necessarily _ inhomogeneous and non - extensive_. this is also the case for the majority of systems in nature : hot nuclei , hot atomic clusters and the real big ones : astrophysical systems under self - gravity .",
    "they are inhomogeneous even away from phase transitions . there",
    "the thermodynamic limit makes no sense .",
    "we will henceforth call these systems `` small '' or `` non - extensive '' .    to describe these non - extensive systems",

    "it defines entropy @xmath7 and with it thermodynamics entirely by mechanical quantities and geometry .",
    "no thermodynamic limit , no extensivity , no concavity ( downwards bending ) of the entropy have to be invoked .",
    "this was largely forgotten since hundred years .",
    "like boltzmann we are led by mechanics as the safe guide when we want to extend thermodynamics here to non - extensive or `` small '' systems . for `` small '' systems the canonical ensemble and with it the boltzmann - gibbs distribution",
    "have no support by mechanics anymore .",
    "a fact by the way gibbs agreed fully with @xcite .",
    "whereas boltzmann s definition above opens the way to interprete thermodynamics by the _",
    "topological and geometrical _ properties of the n - body phase space .",
    "this is new and in marked contrast to e.g. the book of balian @xcite where the entropy is derived from information theory and its extensivity as well its concavity seems to be demanded from the beginning .",
    "boltzmann s definition as written above is free of this .",
    "it is a _ purely geometric _ definition and therefore simple .",
    "as it allows for convexity as well for non - extensivity without contradicting the second law of thermodynamics @xcite it is much more suited for the purpose of non - extensive thermo - statistics of `` small '' systems .",
    "another fairy tale told to us by most textbooks of statistical mechanics and thermodynamics says : `` phase transitions exist only in the thermodynamic limit . '' there , we also learn that phase transitions get smeared in finite systems .",
    "nevertheless though , phase transitions do exist in these systems .",
    "it was the result of experiments and theoretical thoughts especially in _ nuclear physics _ that paved the way to a new and much deeper understanding of equilibrium statistical mechanics and phase transitions in `` small '' systems .",
    "i want to remind the pioneering attempts on nuclear multifragmentation , experimentally by the references @xcite , where finally moretto @xcite gave a concluding overview on the experimental situation of multifragmentation , even though he initially doubted the very existence of this new phenomenon in the paper entitled : `` complex fragment emission at 50 mev / u - compound nuclei for ever '' @xcite .",
    "this development was soon theoretically accompanied and stimulated : @xcite and others .",
    "in fact the paper @xcite is the first of some 500 papers on `` multifragmentation '' cited in the large citation database isi `` web of science '' .",
    "very early , multifragmentation was discussed as a real phase transition of first order in nuclei .",
    "e.g. in @xcite it was argued that multifragmentation is a transition of first order distinct from the usual liquid - gas transition .",
    "and of course this was violently attacked also .",
    "i remember some experimental colleagues who claimed the intermediate mass fragments were coming from the silicon grease used in the vacuum chamber . theoretically , it was warned that phase transitions can not occur in such small systems like nuclei .",
    "they will be washed out and maybe not even recognizable .",
    "in contrast to phase transitions discussed so far in nuclear physics like the transition from spherical to deformed nuclei or the one from normal to superfluidity which are all entropy @xmath8 phenomena , here the real macroscopic signals of a transition in phase - space are seen where the _ entropy shows some anomaly _ : a sudden change of the configuration , a latent heat , even a negative heat capacity is seen c.f .",
    "@xcite which is linked to a convexity of the entropy , forbidden in normal extensive thermodynamics by van hove s concavity rule @xcite .",
    "in this talk i will show just for demonstration how the whole `` zoo '' of phase transitions : first order transitions _ including the interphase surface tension _ , continuous transitions , critical and even multi - critical points are unambiguously and _ sharply _ defined in `` small '' systems of some hundred particles _ by the curvatures of the micro - canonical entropy surface @xmath9 .",
    "_ details can be found in @xcite .",
    "for an example , i show ( figs.[det ] and [ cuts ] ) here only the phase diagram of the determinant of curvatures of @xmath10 vs. energy per volume ( lattice point ) @xmath11 and density ( occupation ) @xmath12 for a potts lattice gas of @xmath13 lattice points with three spin components ( @xmath14 ) : @xmath15     +     +     + cut through the determinant @xmath16 along the line shown in figure ( [ det ] ) at const .",
    "@xmath17 , through the critical line @xmath18 close to the critical point @xmath19 of the ordinary potts model ( @xmath20 )    ' '' ''     + cut through the determinant @xmath16 along the line shown in figure ( [ det ] ) at const .",
    "@xmath21 , slightly below the multi - critical region .",
    "there are several zero points of the determinant of curvatures : the left one is simultaneously a maximum with @xmath22 and consequently critical as discussed above    the eigenvectors of the curvature matrix define the main curvature directions .",
    "notice , the smaller of the two eigenvalues is here always @xmath23 .",
    "the larger eigenvalue @xmath24 may be positive or negative .",
    "the direction of the eigenvector @xmath25 belonging to @xmath24 gives a natural and unambiguous definition of the _ order parameter _ of the system .",
    "it is by a progression in this direction that the system changes from one phase over a region of phase - separation to the other phase . in figure ( [ maincurvature ] )",
    "we see the phase transition of first order is controlled by variation roughly parallel to the ground - state ( similar to the magnetization axis in the ising model ) and the phase transition of second order in the pure potts - model by a variation @xmath26 the energy .",
    "as can be well seen the order parameter is not always a straight line in the parameter space .",
    "the systematics of micro - canonical phase transitions will be listed in the conclusion .",
    "the multi - critical point @xmath27 is most interesting : here the largest curvature eigenvalue @xmath24 and therefore also the curvature determinant @xmath16 vanishes in a _ two - dimensional _ neighborhood .",
    "the entropy surface @xmath9 has the topology of the surface of a cylinder inside this neighborhood .",
    "as is discussed in all details in ref.@xcite this new and more extended definition of phase transitions agrees with the yang - lee definition in the thermodynamic limit but it allows to define phase transition also in the much larger world of non - extensive systems .",
    "_ applications of thermodynamic arguments to these systems and of course to hot nuclei make sense only within the micro - canonical theory .",
    "_ this is also a serious reminder for many contributions to this conference .",
    "moreover , thermodynamics of `` small '' systems like hot nuclei is naturally probabilistic and therefore requires normally a monte carlo kind of treatment .",
    "micro - canonical thermo - statistics describes how the entropy @xmath9 as defined entirely in mechanical terms by boltzmann depends on the conserved `` extensive '' variables : energy @xmath28 , particle number @xmath29 , angular momentum @xmath30 etc .",
    "in contrast to the conventional theory , we can study phase transitions also in `` small '' systems or other non - extensive systems .",
    "they are sharply defined for finite systems without invoking the thermodynamic limit .",
    "we classify phase transitions in a `` small '' system by the topological properties of the determinant of curvatures @xmath16 , eq.([curvdet ] ) , of the micro - canonical entropy - surface @xmath9 :    * a single stable phase by @xmath31 . here",
    "@xmath9 is concave ( downwards bended ) in both directions and there is a one to one mapping of \\{e , n } @xmath32\\{t,@xmath33 } or between the micro and the grand - canonical ensemble . * a transition of first order with phase separation by @xmath34 or the largest curvature @xmath35 . here",
    "the entropy surface @xmath9 has a convex intruder .",
    "the depth of the intruder is a measure of the inter - phase surface tension @xcite .",
    "this region is bounded by a line with @xmath36 .",
    "* on this line @xmath27 is a critical end - point where additionally @xmath37 in the direction of the eigenvector of @xmath16 with the largest eigenvalue @xmath24 .",
    "i.e. @xmath16 has here a minimum .",
    "there , the transition is continuous ( `` second order '' ) with vanishing surface tension , and no convex intruder in @xmath9 . here",
    "two neighboring phases become indistinguishable , because there are no interfaces .",
    "moreover , we found a further _ line _ ( @xmath38 , critical ) with @xmath37 which does not border a region of negative @xmath16 . presumably @xmath16 should be @xmath39 also",
    "this needs further tests in other systems .",
    "it may further be that these lines signalize transitions of first order in another , but hidden non - conserved order parameter , e.g. the staggered magnetization c.f.@xcite .",
    "* finally a multi - critical point @xmath27 where more than two phases become indistinguishable by the branching of several lines with @xmath40 or with @xmath37 to give a _ cylindrical _ region of @xmath9 with additionally @xmath41 , here the largest curvature @xmath42 has a maximum in a 2-dim . neighborhood . * all regions with @xmath43 lead to the catastrophes of the laplace transform from the micro to the grand - canonical ensemble and thus to the yang - lee singularities of the grand - canonical partition sum in the thermodynamic limit .",
    "it is fair to say that the discovery of nuclear multi - fragmentation as a real phase transition of first order in a _ `` small '' _ many - body system is a challenge for statistical mechanics to understand its foundation better and to become able to describe also the thermodynamics of inhomogeneous and non - extensive systems @xcite .",
    "it opens thermo - statistics for so many applications from small systems like nuclei up to the largest like astro - physical ones .",
    "boltzmann s definition of entropy allows for a _ geometrical and topological _ interpretation of thermo - statistics with the virtue of great conceptional clarity and to be free of invoking the thermodynamic limit .",
    "nuclear collisions are a beautiful testing ground of these new ideas .",
    "this is of course an idealized description .",
