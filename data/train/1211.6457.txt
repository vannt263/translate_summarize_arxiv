    "accreting millisecond pulsars ( amps ) are all in low mass x - ray binary ( lmxb ) systems , spinning at frequencies more than 100 hz and containing companion stars with masses less than @xmath8 @xcite .",
    "the periodical pulsed emission from amps is accretion powered , which distinguishes them from normal radio millisecond pulsars ( msps ) that are powered by rotation .",
    "amps are believed to be the progenitors of msps spun up from old slowly rotating neutron stars ( nss ) by the recycling scenario @xcite , that is when a ns in a binary system switches off the pulsed radio emission , the mass and angular momentum of the companion star are transferred to the ns through accretion , producing a recycled pulsar that eventually spins at a period of milliseconds .",
    "the currently known amps are all transient systems with recurrent times of years .",
    "evolution of their accretion disks leads to weeks - long outbursts , during which pulsed x - ray emission is detected .",
    "the first known amp sax j1808.4@xmath13658 was found by the _",
    "bepposax _ mission in 1996 @xcite and discovered to have pulsed x - ray emission with the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer _ ( rxte ) during its 1998 outburst @xcite .",
    "since then , over a dozen of amp systems have been discovered @xcite .",
    "one interesting property of amp binaries was first pointed out by @xcite : because the orbital optical modulation seen in sax j1808.4@xmath13658 has a larger than expected amplitude in the quiescent state @xcite , the amp probably switches to be rotation - powered and thus is able to provide the required energy output to heating of the companion",
    ". followup observations of sax j1808.4@xmath13658 at x - ray and optical energies have firmly verified the inconsistency between the large optical modulation and low x - ray luminosity in quiescence @xcite .",
    "x - ray emission from accreting compact stars normally is the heating source to cause orbital optical modulations seen in lmxbs ( e.g. , @xcite ) . in addition",
    ", the inconsistency has also been seen in two other amp systems , igr  j00291@xmath25934 and xte  j1814@xmath1338 @xcite , which suggests a common property of being able to switch to be radio pulsars in quiescence for amp systems , although no direct evidence has been found from radio observations of them @xcite .",
    "the more recent discovery of the millisecond pulsar binary psr j1023@xmath20038 @xcite has strengthened the likelihood of the radio - pulsar switching property of the amp systems .",
    "the binary is considered to be the first system found at the end of its evolution from a lmxb to a msp binary , as a short - term accretion disk was seen in it @xcite .",
    "@xmath0-ray emission from psr j1023@xmath20038 was also found from observations carried out by _ fermi _ gamma - ray space telescope @xcite .",
    "considering psr  j1023@xmath20038 as an end product of lmxb evolution closely related to amp systems , @xcite studied possible @xmath0-ray emission mechanisms for the amp systems known with large - amplitude optical modulations ( see table 1 ) . in their work , they attributed the optical modulations of the amp systems to @xmath0-ray irradiation of the companions , which required @xmath0-ray luminosity @xmath9 @xmath10 @xmath11 ergs  s@xmath4 .",
    "the predicted @xmath0-ray emission is possibly detectable by _ fermi _ , and any detection would provide strong evidence for the existence of radio pulsars in these amp systems in quiescence .",
    "we thus searched for @xmath0-ray emission from the four amps in the data obtained by _",

    "we rejected events below 200 mev and included only events in energy range from 200 mev to 300 gev for the likelihood analysis , because the instrument response function of lat has relative large uncertainties in lower energy range .",
    "we included all sources within 20 degrees centered at the four amps to make the source models based on the _ fermi _ 2-year catalog .",
    "most of them are point sources , while a few of them are diffuse sources .",
    "the spectral function forms of these sources were selected the same as those in the catalog .",
    "we let the spectral normalization parameters of sources within 3 degrees from the four amps free , and fixed all the other parameters of sources included in our source models to their catalog values .",
    "the four amps we are interested in were not included in the fermi catalog .",
    "we modeled the @xmath0-ray spectra of them with a exponentially cut - off power law which is the typical spectral form of pulsars @xcite .",
    "the exponentially cut - off power law can be expressed by @xmath12 $ ] , where @xmath13 is the spectral index and @xmath14 is the cut - off energy . in addition",
    "we considered the galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission using the model gal_2yearp7v6_v0.fits and the spectrum file iso_p7v6source.txt , respectively .",
    "the value of the galactic diffuse emission model and the normalization of the extragalactic diffuse emission model were let free .",
    "we performed standard binned likelihood analysis with the lat science tools software package v9r27p1 .",
    "the binned likelihood used events in a square region instead of a circle , so we selected events inside a @xmath15 region centered at each interested source , which is nearly the inscribed square of the circular region we selected above .",
    "we obtained the test statistic ( ts ) of the four amps , and the ts maps of @xmath16 regions centered at each of the four amps are shown in figure  1 .",
    "each of the maps was extracted by assuming a putative source and performing binned likelihood analysis to obtain the ts value at each grid point of the regions .",
    "the sources in the source models outside of the regions , and the galactic and extragalactic diffuse emission were considered .",
    "we found that igr j00291@xmath25934 , xte j1814@xmath1338 , and xte j0929@xmath1314 had ts values of @xmath17 0 , and sax j1808.4@xmath13658 had a ts value of @xmath17 3 .",
    "a ts value is approxmiately the square of the detection significance of a source and it can be used to assess whether a source exists or not .",
    "actually in the _ fermi _ source catalog only sources with ts values greater than 25 were included , which corresponds to the detection significance of 4.6@xmath18 @xcite .",

    "the @xmath0-ray flux upper limits of these four amps were estimated by the binned likelihood analysis with the source models we described above .",

    "the spectral normalization factors were let free .",
    "we extracted the upper limits of normalization factors by increasing these factors until the maximum likelihood values decreased by e/2 in logarithm , following the procedure introduced by the lat team . then using the upper limits of normalization factors we derived the 95@xmath19 flux upper limits in energy range from 100 mev to 300 gev by integrating the spectral models .",
    "assuming isotropic @xmath0-ray emission , the upper limits of the @xmath0-ray luminosities of these four sources were calculated , where the distance values of the sources listed in table 1 were used .",
    "we performed timing analysis of the _",

    "we included events in energy range from 100 mev to 300 gev within 1 degree centered at the positions of these four sources , and folded them into 20 phase bins using x - ray ephemerides ( table 1 ) .",
    "the frequency derivatives were considered for the sources with the measurements of their spin - down rates .",
    "we obtained the folded light curves of these sources ( figure 2 ) and made @xmath20 test and h test to identify possible presence of @xmath0-ray pulsations .",
    "the four folded light curves have @xmath20 values in the range of 11@xmath128 which are comparable to the 19 degrees of freedom @xcite , and h values in the range of 0.4@xmath110.8 which are significantly smaller than the value ( h@xmath2142 ) used by the lat team to comfirm @xmath0-ray pulsations @xcite , thereby indicating no significant @xmath0-ray pulsations from these four amps were detected .",
    "in addition , since our targets are all located in the galactic plane , contamination from diffuse emission and nearby sources may prevent the detections of @xmath0-ray pulsations .",
    "we thus tested to decrease the radii of the target regions from 1 degree to 0.5 degree to search for @xmath0-ray pulsations .",

    "finally the complex regions near the galactic plane , in which the four amps are located , certainly affects the @xmath0-ray detections and the upper limit evaluations of them . as can be seen from the ts maps ( figure 1 ) , while the galactic diffuse emission was removed from the source regions at a satisfactory level",
