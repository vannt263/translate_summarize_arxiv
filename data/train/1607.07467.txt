    "the goal of this paper is to investigate the fluctuations of the kinetic , potential and total energy of a one - dimensional langevin oscillator .",
    "the results will be presented in the form of analytical expressions for the respective autocorrelation functions ( acfs ) and cross - correlation functions ( ccfs ) and their frequency spectra .",
    "the paper is rather technical and heavily relies on the formalism of spectral representations of stochastic processes . for the readers benefit ,",

    "this can be readily done in computer simulations and , in principle , in experiments measuring a property sensitive to kinetic energy of the particles .",
    "this approach obviously assumes ergodicity of the system and classical dynamics .",
    "the langevin oscillator offers a simple model that can illustrate these ideas .",
    "consider the einstein model of a solid with a single vibrational frequency @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath192 oscillators describing the atomic vibrations are considered totally decoupled from each other and only interacting with a thermostat .",
    "suppose the latter is a langevin thermostat characterized by a damping constant @xmath1 and a random force @xmath6 satisfying the fluctuation - dissipation relation ( [ eq:17 ] ) for a given thermostat temperature @xmath8 . in this model ,",
    "each vibrational mode can be represented by a single langevin oscillator . the damping time @xmath193 sets the timescale of energy exchanges with the thermostat .",
    "by contrast to a real solid wherein internal equilibration requires redistribution of energy between different vibrational modes by phonon scattering , in the present model the energy is pumped into or removed from each oscillator individually .",
    "thus , the internal equilibration timescale @xmath186 is on the order of @xmath194 .",
    ", which is sufficient for the kinetic energy to transform to potential .",
    "but since we are only interested in orders of magnitude , @xmath194 is a suitable estimate of the relevant timescale .",
    "] we assume that the vibrations are quasi - harmonic and thus @xmath195 ( underdamped regime ) .",
    "then @xmath188 and there is a quasi - equilibrium timescale in between on which the temperature can be defined .",
    "we have shown above that kinetic energy fluctuations of an underdamped langevin oscillator have two components : a fast component due to transformations between the kinetic and potential energies during atomic vibrations ( period @xmath196 ) , and a slow component due to energy exchanges with the thermostat ( timescale @xmath15 ) .",
    "it is the slow component that should be used to calculate the quasi - equilibrium temperature of the system .",
    "the fast component can be `` filtered out '' by averaging @xmath63 over several vibration periods .",
    "alternatively , the same can be achieved by separating the peaks in the spectrum of the kinetic energy acf . as was shown above , @xmath32 has two peaks separated by a frequency gap ( figs .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) and  [ fig : k - acf](a ) ) .",
    "one peak at @xmath70 represents the kinetic - potential energy exchanges during the vibrations ( fast component ) while the other at @xmath53 represents the energy exchanges with the thermostat ( slow component ) .",
    "thus , the separation of the two timescales can be accomplished by splitting the spectrum in two lorentz peaks described by eqs.([eq:41 ] ) and ( [ eq:38 ] ) , respectively . as was shown in sec .",
    "[ sec : ke ] , each peak describes kinetic energy fluctuations with the same mean - square value @xmath197 for a solid composed of @xmath192 statistically independent oscillators , we use the low - frequency peak ( at @xmath53 ) to obtain @xmath198    we can now identify the quasi - equilibrium temperature with the equipartition value @xmath199 using the kinetic energy defined by the low - frequency peak . inserting this temperature in eq.([eq:94 - 1 ] ) we have @xmath200 this fluctuation relation matches eq.([eq:91 ] ) if @xmath201 , which is exactly the classical specific heat of the solid .",
    "we emphasize that this result was obtained by defining the quasi - equilibrium temperature without any reference to the behavior of the total energy during the fluctuations .",
    "this is fundamentally different from the approach mentioned above wherein @xmath184 is defined as a formal quantity strictly proportional to @xmath169 .",
    "that approach also gives eq.([eq:95 ] ) , except that the latter simply reflects the temperature definition .    to show that the foregoing derivation of eq.([eq:95 ] ) is non - trivial ,",
    "suppose we ignore the different timescales and define the temperature from the same equipartition rule but now using _",
    "instantaneous _ values of kinetic energy , as is often done in md simulations .",
    "the mean - square fluctuation of this `` instantaneous temperature '' @xmath202 is obtained by averaging over both times scale or , which is equivalent , by including both peaks of @xmath32 . as was discussed in sec .",
    "[ sec : ke ] , the respective kinetic energy fluctuation of an oscillator is then @xmath84 .",
    "this leads to the temperature fluctuation @xmath203 the specific heat extracted from this fluctuation relation is @xmath204 , which is factor of two wrong .",
    "it is only the temperature defined on the quasi - equilibrium timescale that satisfies the fluctuation relation ( [ eq:91 ] ) with the correct specific heat .",
    "the main result of this work is the derivation of the analytical solutions for the energy correlation functions of a langevin oscillator .",
    "the derivation was enabled by approximating the quadruple correlation functions by a sum of products of pair correlation functions as explained in appendix b. in other words , the derivations neglect all correlations between stochastic properties beyond pairwise .",
    "the accuracy of this approximation has been validated by comparison with md simulation results , which are found to be in excellent agreement with the analytical solutions .    given the role of the langevin oscillator model in various areas of physics , the results obtained here might be useful for addressing diverse physical problems involving energy fluctuations in systems in contact with a thermostat .",
    "as one example of possible applications , we have presented a simple model illustrating the existence and the meaning of the temperature fluctuations in canonical systems .",
    "temperature fluctuations is a controversial subject with many conflicting views published over the past century ( see references in @xcite ) .",
    "one of the oldest and , in our opinion , most fruitful approaches recognizes the existence of quasi - equilibrium states that arise during canonical fluctuations and exist on a particular timescale @xcite .",
    "the temperature calculated on this quasi - equilibrium timescale by treating the system as if it were equilibrium , is a well - defined physical property whose fluctuations follow the relation ( [ eq:91 ] ) . by considering an einstein solid composed of langevin oscillators , we have demonstrated the existence of the quasi - equilibrium timescale and verified that the temperature computed on this timescale indeed satisfies eq.([eq:91 ] ) .",
    "although rather simplistic , this model captures the essential physics .",
    "a more realistic md study of temperature fluctuations in a crystalline solid modeled with accurate many - body atomistic potentials will be published elsewhere @xcite .    _",
