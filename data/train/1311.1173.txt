    "one of the most stunning results from the heavy ion programs at rhic and lhc is the quenching of jets and single - inclusive hadron spectra  @xcite .",
    "being perturbative probes for which we can calculate the vacuum baseline to high precision , jets are potentially excellent probes of the medium created in heavy ion collisions . modifications , arising due to interactions with the hot and dense matter , are indeed expected to arise at timescales comparable to the lifetime of the medium are typically characterized in terms of elastic and radiative energy losses @xcite , for recent reviews see , e.g. , @xcite .",
    "presently our theoretical control of the jet fragmentation is however limited .",
    "in particular , the importance of modifications of the jet sub - structures due to the transverse medium resolution was only recently pointed out @xcite .",
    "recent results from the lhc on the suppression of single - inclusive hadrons and jets are in this context challenging to reconcile with the corresponding observations at rhic @xcite and call for the refinement of present theoretical tools .",
    "furthermore , at rhic it is challenging to reconcile both the data on the nuclear modification factor , @xmath0 , and azimuthal flow , characterized by @xmath3 , at high @xmath1within models based on radiative qcd mechanisms @xcite .",
    "we take this uncertainty at the theoretical level as an opportunity to make a data driven study that we present here .",
    "similar studies have also been carried out previously in  @xcite , see also @xcite for more theoretically driven studies , and we will return to how they differ from the present work in section  [ sec : discussion ] .",
    "one of the challenges of modeling the energy loss is that the medium created in heavy ion collisions behaves as a perfect liquid .",
    "there are at least 2 major issues .",
    "first of all , both the geometry and the dynamical expansion of the medium introduce a complication for the clean extraction of the transport properties of the medium .",
    "the longitudinal expansion of the medium causes the energy density to decrease quickly with time ( as the inverse of the proper time in the bjorken model  @xcite ) , and this could clearly affect the path length dependence of the energy loss .",
    "furthermore , the dynamics of the medium in the transverse plane signifies that in non - central collisions there is an asymmetric expansion of the medium , where the expansion in the reaction plane is larger than out - of - plane . to first order",
    "the latter effect is supposed to be negligible , but various studies have documented significant effects  @xcite . since we wish to pursue a data driven study , these effects can not be handled without recourse to modeling and so we will focus on characterizing the energy loss in terms of initial state observables .",
    "it is quite remarkable that this seems to work very well .    secondly , the convincing signals of collective behavior in a - acollisions hint at the existence of a strongly coupled system .",
    "this , in turn , challenges the paradigm of using perturbative methods to calculate the relevant degrees of freedom for the jet - medium interactions .",
    "our present study avoids these conceptual difficulties .",
    "one could worry that the measured @xmath0 in and out of the reaction plane is significantly affected by flow .",
    "let us try to argue here that for @xmath4 this is in our opinion not very likely .",
    "flow is typically characterized by introducing a mass dependence . both measurements of @xmath3  @xcite and the @xmath0  @xcite have shown that for @xmath5 there is little or no difference between results for pions and protons .",
    "the triangular flow , characterized by the coefficient @xmath6 , also seems to disappear in this @xmath1region  @xcite . as the baryon to meson ratios are rather similar from rhic energy ( @xmath7 ) to lhc energies ( @xmath8 )  @xcite this indicates that also for rhic energies we need to have data for @xmath5 to eliminate flow effects .",
    "in our opinion , this allows us safely to assume that both @xmath0and @xmath3at high @xmath1are dominated by energy loss .",
    "the effect of residual flow would be an underestimate ( overestimate ) of the quenching contribution in ( out ) of plane .",
    "there are no indications for such an effect in fig .",
    "[ fig : scaling ] .    at high energies the energy loss of a colored parton going through a colored medium",
    "is expected to be dominantly radiative .",
    "navely one expects that radiative qcd energy loss @xcite increases quadratic with path length , since this follows from the stimulated emission probability of a single _ hard _ gluon @xcite .",
    "these emissions are however rare and one should also account for multiple _ soft _ emissions .",
    "this changes the path length dependence of the characteristic @xmath1shift of the medium - modified spectra so it becomes linear @xcite , see appendix  [ sec : app : radiative ] .",
    "a crucial point of this paper is that the existing data allows to disentangle more than simply the path length dependence of the suppression .",
    "as we will show , this information has to be supplemented by including a dependence on the energy density . while our results will rely on simple estimates of both of these quantities , for details see section  [ sec : setup ] , the agreement with the data at two , widely separated energies of rhic and lhc represent a strong argument for the consistency of the interpretation of energy loss in ultrarelativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "finally we note that there is a significant @xmath1dependence of the @xmath0 .",
    "we shall ignore this @xmath1dependence in our quantitative studies and focus on a common @xmath1region of @xmath9 for lhc and rhic .",
    "the scaling plots we show , in particular fig .",
    "[ fig : pt_ratio ] , does however indicate that the scaling relations we find are also valid at higher @xmath1 .",

    "the selection was done on the characteristic length , which we define as the root - mean - squared ( rms ) of the distribution .",
    "we can then compare the in- and out - of - plane @xmath0data for different centrality classes where these properties will agree . in fig .",
    "[ fig : l_example ] we have chosen two centrality classes , 10 - 20  % and 30 - 40  % , where the in - plane rms width of the former distribution , denoted @xmath11 , is approximately equal to the out - of - plane rms , denoted @xmath12 , of the latter , see the top panels . in the lower - left panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : l_example ] we also demonstrate that the participant distribution is quite similar in the two cases .",
    "an important motivation behind such a simplified event selection is the fact that in central collisions we expect the distribution of hard scatterings ( binary collisions ) to be more narrowly distributed around the origin . in that way",
    "the path length of the two samples should on the average be quite similar , but we note most importantly that the density is quite different .",
    "moreover , the transverse expansion could be much more significant in - plane than out - of - plane and could spoil the comparison . in our studies",
    "we find that the latter effect can be neglected and this is in fact also , as mentioned above , what one would expect to first order from theoretical arguments .",
    "once we have fixed the characteristic length to be similar , it remains to include the effect of the difference in energy density . as it is clearly seen in the lower - right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : l_example ] , comparing the @xmath0for our example cases for which the path lengths were equal in- and out - of - plane does not result in the same amount of suppression .",

    "[ fig : l_example ] , and so we assign an area as @xmath13 .",

    "the lhc data on charged particle @xmath0and @xmath3used in this publication have been taken from  @xcite .",
    "cms has published similar data  @xcite but with coarser segmentation in centrality and @xmath1 , while alice @xmath3measurements does not cover centralities above 50  %  @xcite . the @xmath0in- and out - of - plane used in our data driven analysis has been obtained as @xmath21 and @xmath22 , respectively . the @xmath1bins for",
    "the @xmath0and @xmath3results do not match perfectly but the closest @xmath1points have been used and as both the @xmath0and @xmath3are only rather moderately varying at high @xmath1we consider this a negligible effect .",
    "the error bars shown in the figures for @xmath23and @xmath24always include the full statistical and systematic uncertainties added in quadrature from both the @xmath0and @xmath3 .",
    "normalization errors for @xmath0have been ignored as they are expected to be directly correlated across centralities ( and to some degree also across beam energies ) . when @xmath25 and @xmath26 is compared we assume in our interpretation that the relative systematic error is smaller than shown . for the @xmath0one",
    "expects e.g. the efficiency and corrections to have similar systematic errors and so there it seems a common shift of @xmath25 and @xmath26 is expected .",
    "on the other hand for @xmath3a systematic shift would tend to shift @xmath25 and @xmath26 in opposite directions . a better understanding of this aspect can only be obtained by the experiments .",
    "to extract information beyond merely the level of suppression of the spectra , we would like to study the phenomenon of energy loss more directly  @xcite .",
    "to this aim we will assume that the spectra in p - pand a - acollisions can be described by a power - law with a similar exponent and that the difference comes from the fact that the primordial @xmath1of the partonic a - aspectrum has been shifted to lower values due to energy loss in the medium .",
    "note that the shift itself could be @xmath1dependent .",
    "explicitly , the @xmath1shift is defined as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the momentum of the parton prior to energy loss while @xmath29 is the momentum of the hadron as measured in the detector . then , following a similar method as employed by phenix  @xcite , the @xmath1spectra of particles in a certain centrality class can be compared via @xmath30 where the first term is the jacobian of the transformation , see appendix  [ sec : app : ptloss ] for further details .",

    "the relationship between @xmath0and energy loss at lhc and rhic is therefore different even if the @xmath0are quite compatible for each of the centralities .",
    "the main change in the scaling variable going from lhc down to rhic energies is an almost centrality independent decrease of particle density @xmath20 of a factor 0.48  @xcite . in our picture one",

    "despite the fact that these properties are quite inclusive and do not take account of the dynamical evolution of the system created in these collisions , the observed scaling suggests a dominant and consistent mechanism underlying the physics of jet quenching from rhic to lhc .    in the discussion of energy loss",
    "we have focused on the very high @xmath1data while in fig .",
    "[ fig : pt_ratio ] one clearly observes large differences at lower @xmath1(@xmath50 ) .",

    "[ fig : scaling ] .",
    "this might suggest that the transverse expansion of the medium has little effect on jet quenching , i.e. , the dilution of the medium is canceled by the longer path length .",

    "[ sec : results ] in light of radiative energy loss , see appendix  [ sec : app : radiative ] for a brief review .",

    "[ fig : scaling ] , this relation breaks down when one studies @xmath0in- and out - of - plane .",
    "therefore their results should be supplemented by the additional information we have extracted here .",

    "presently , we will identify the extracted density @xmath18from eq .  ( [ eq : bjorkendensity ] ) with the transport parameter for jet quenching averaged over the trajectory of the jets , @xmath55 , in the context of radiative energy loss .",

    "in fact , we expect both @xmath57 and @xmath62 to vary with the center - of - mass collision energy .",
    "the reason for the variation of the latter quantity , comes about since at rhic ( lhc ) we expect the high @xmath1particles to be fragments from dominantly quarks ( gluons ) implying a different color factor in @xmath62 .",

    "[ fig : finalresults ] therefore appears accidental in this context .",
    "we recall that the main motivation behind the data driven study was to avoid these conceptual difficulties . in our opinion ,",
    "the most solid conclusion that can be drawn from fig .",
    "[ fig : qhat ] is the decrease of @xmath63 by roughly a factor 4 from central to peripheral collisions dictated by the @xmath64 dependence .",
    "albeit the data - driven analysis and subsequent interpretation both deal with static quantities , and therefore are inherently consistent , a serious caveat of the interpretation in terms of radiative energy loss is the neglecting of the longitudinal expansion of the medium .",
    "this can be estimated by making use of the dynamical scaling law for @xmath65 @xcite . for a bjorken - expanding medium",
    "the average transport parameter @xmath63 is related to the initial @xmath66 measured at some initial proper time @xmath67 as @xmath68 .",
    "this , in turn , implies that the expected path length dependence due to medium - induced radiative processes would scale as @xmath69 , rendering it incompatible with the extracted scaling behavior . within our data driven approach ,",
    "these ideas rather imply that the extracted values of the average transport parameter involves a significantly largerinitial @xmath66 in the early stages of the collision . a generic theory driven approach to a wide array of energy loss scenarios",
    "were presented in @xcite in the context of a monte - carlo model which also includes realistic nuclear geometry and couples to a hydrodynamical model of the plasma , see also , e.g. , @xcite for similar efforts .",
    "the extraction of the @xmath1loss is done for charged particles while the quenching supposedly affects the spectra at the parton level .",
    "the charged particle @xmath1spectrum at high @xmath1largely reflects leading particles and as we know from measurements at lhc that leading particle fragments in quenched and unquenched jets share similar fractions of the jet @xmath1  @xcite , this approximation is probably not so bad .",
    "still it would be interesting to make a similar study with jets .",
    "in this study the goal have been to distance ourselves as far as possible from models of jet quenching and rather by selecting samples from different centrality classes with similar path lengths to be able to isolate the density effect and then study the path length dependence .",
    "surprisingly the method works very well and is in fact in reasonable agreement with theoretical considerations .",
    "a critical question is how the longitudinal expansion of the medium affects jet quenching and this has tremendous impact on how one would interpret the results in terms of e.g. the path length dependence .",
    "finally we note that the exact same density dependence observed for different centrality classes for lhc data is consistent with rhic data indicating that the dense matter at rhic and lhc has fundamentally similar properties .",
    "the definition of the nuclear modification factor is @xmath70 where @xmath71 represents the number of binary collisions ( the nuclear overlap function ) for the given centrality class estimated from the glauber model ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . following the standard interpretation of the suppression of hadron spectra in a - acollisions",
    ", we assume that it arises due to a @xmath1shift of the primordial parton spectrum .",
    "we will therefore write @xmath72 where we have made explicit for which @xmath1value the spectrum is evaluated at and included the jacobian of the transformation , which also can be written as @xmath73 .",

    "( [ eq : stypical ] ) and ( [ eq : shard ] ) ) , fall in between the  extremes \" considered above .",
    "the @xmath1shifts estimated from these two cases will be averaged and the difference will be indicated as a systematic uncertainty of the procedure .",
    "for highly energetic probes the hot and dense medium is parameterized by one characteristic transport coefficient , the so - called @xmath65 parameter which encodes the transverse momentum broadening per unit length .",
    "heuristically , this parameter scales with the energy density @xmath18 as @xmath84 .",
    "the largest energy that can be carried by a medium - induced gluon accumulates momentum along the whole path length of the medium and is usually defined as @xmath85 .",
    "the spectrum of induced gluons per unit length reads @xcite @xmath86 for energies @xmath87 , ) is regularized at a minimal energy marking the onset of the bethe - heitler regime . ]",
    "where @xmath88 .",
    "it follows that the energy loss caused by the single - gluon emission , given by @xmath89 , is dominated by the hard sector , @xmath90 .",

    "assuming independent gluon emissions it is simply given by a poisson distribution @xcite , but this premise can be improved upon by including , e.g. , phase - space limitations @xcite or energy - momentum conservation , see @xcite .",
    "these corrected distributions give rise to more complex scaling trends than discussed below , but will be neglected in the following .",
    "presently we assume that the invariant p - pis well described by a power law spectrum with constant exponent @xmath57 .",
    "then , in the large-@xmath57 approximation we recast the quenching factor as @xmath95 , where @xmath74is directly related to the @xmath1shift of the medium - modified parton spectrum as @xmath96 .",
    "this shift can be estimated to be @xcite @xmath97 inserting the latter expression into the formula for @xmath98 we obtain the so - called  pocket formula \" for radiative energy loss @xcite . relating to our previous discussion , the shift scales as @xmath99 .",
    "finally , note that in the special limit of @xmath100 the @xmath1shift rather becomes @xmath101 and scales as @xmath102 .",
    "thus , only in this particular regime can one identify the mean energy loss with the typical @xmath1shift due to the dominance of one - gluon emission .",
