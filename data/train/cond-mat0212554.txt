    "thus , the energy decreases by local li - redirections along @xmath44   and this decreases the corresponding elastic constant proportionally to @xmath37 .",

    "in addition to promoting li - redirection , tetragonal distortions change the to soft mode frequency . using the average dynamical charges and computed ionic displacements",

    "partial contributions to the dipole moment that are associated with ta- and o - displacements are most sensitive to changes in @xmath44 ; which is consistent with an electrostriction induced reduction in the soft - mode frequency .",
    "the picture of klt in which li - dipoles , a soft - mode , and pnc all interact , lends itself to a first - principles based effective hamiltonian , @xmath76 , treatment .",
    "full formulation of @xmath76   is beyond the scope of this work , but some essential intermediate results have been derived . for simplicity ,",
    "consider klt40 , with the same ionic displacements in each unit cell .",
    "to derive @xmath76   for a fe , one selects a local basis for the instabilities that cause the fe transition , and includes interactions between sites , between local distortion and strain , etc.@xcite . in klt , it is clear that instabilities centered on li are responsible for the phase transition , and that li - centered distortion variables must be included in @xmath76 .",
    "however , the coupling of li - dipole moments to the kt soft - mode is sufficiently important that one must also include a local variable for the kt soft - mode . by analogy with @xmath76   for knbo@xmath2@xcite",

    "one can reduce the number of variables by excluding strain .",
    "this results in a decrease of the nonlinearity constant which multiplies the fourth power of polarization , and changes the sign of the angle dependent term for the soft - mode .",
