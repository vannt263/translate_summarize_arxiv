    "a resent experiment by switkes et al .",
    "@xcite has stimulated increasing interest in adiabatic quantum charge pumping .",
    "idealy in such an experiment one aims at generating a dc - current by slowly modulating the shape of a mesoscopic conductor with the help of oscillating gate voltages .",
    "a single potential oscillating at frequency @xmath0 does not generate a dc - current , but two potentials oscillating with the same frequency but out of phase can generate a dc - current .",
    "the effect is of interest under conditions in which electron motion is phase - coherent and is thus termed _",
    "quantum _ pumping .",
    "the frequency of the potential modulation is small compared to the characteristic times for traversal and reflection of electrons and the pump is thus termed _",
    "thus carriers traversing the sample see an almost static potential .",
    "the last circumstance allows to give an elegant formulation of quantum pumping @xcite which is based on the scattering matrix approach to low frequency ac transport in phase coherent mesoscopic systems @xcite .",
    "+ recently avron et al .",
    "@xcite investigated adiabatic quantum pumping with the aim to formulate criteria for an `` optimal pump '' .",
    "the term `` optimal '' means that such a pump is noiseless and transports integer charge in each cycle . to this extent",
    "they have investigated not only the dc - current but also the dissipation and the noise generated by a pump .",
    "avron et al .",
    "express their results in terms of an energy shift matrix @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the time - dependend scattering matrix .",
    "this is an elegant formulation which gives a correct description of time - dependent adiabatic currents and dissipation .",
    "however , for quantities which invoke correlations at different times the approach is valid only for pump frequencies @xmath4 .",
    "it is the purpose of this work to investigate the distribution function , heat flow and noise properties of an adiabatic pump for an arbitrary relation of pump frequency and temperature . to achieve this we start with the scattering matrix approach for ac - transport",
    "this approach leads to expressions for the quantities of interest in terms of the side bands of particles exiting the pump .",
    "the side bands correspond to particles which have gained or lost a modulation quantum @xmath1 .",
    "in particular , the approach presented here allows a description of the quantum statistical correlation properties ( noise ) of an adiabatic quantum pump .",
    "the adiabatic quantum pump @xcite of interest here should be distinguished from a variety of other pumping mechanisms . for certains pumps @xcite the charge transferred in each cycle",
    "is quantized .",
    "quantized charge pumping is most easily achieved in devices based on the coulomb blockade effect @xcite where the charge on a quantum dot is quantized .",
    "this is of considerable metrological interest @xcite .",
    "other effects which lead to pumping are the photovoltaic effect @xcite and the acoustoelectric effect @xcite .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec.ii",
    "the essential assumptions we make are described . in sec.iii",
    "we calculate the nonequilibrium distribution function for the outgoing particles produced by the pump . in sec.iv",
    "we formulate the condition which is necessary to pump dc - current . in sec.v",
    "we calculate the heat flows produced by an oscillating mesoscopic scatterer . in sec.vi we consider the shot noise produced by the pump and analyze the noise in terms of uncorrelated movement of nonequilibrium quasi - particles ( quasi - electrons and holes ) generated by the pump and correlations between them @xcite . in sec.vii we present explicit results for the particular case of a two - leads scatterer with the time - reversal symmetry .",
    "to describe the response of a mesoscopic phase coherent sample to slowly oscillating ( with a frequency @xmath0 ) external real parameters @xmath5 ( gate potential , magnetic flux , etc . )    @xmath6    we will use the scattering matrix approach @xcite .",
    "the sample is connected via leads ( which we will number via greek letters @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , etc . ) to @xmath10 reservoirs . the scattering matrix @xmath11 being a function of parameters @xmath5 depends on time .",
    "two main assumption will be used .",
    "first , we suppose that the external parameter changes so slowly that we can apply an `` instant scattering '' description using the scattering matrix @xmath12 frozen at some time @xmath13 . physically this means that the scattering matrix changes only a little",
    "while an electron is scattered by the mesoscopic sample ( i.e. , the frequency @xmath0 is much smaller than the inverse wigner time delay @xcite ) . in this sense",
    "we use the term `` adiabatic '' pump .",
    "second , we assume that the amplitude @xmath14 is small enough to keep only the terms linear in @xmath14 in an expansion of the scattering matrix    @xmath15    in the limit of small frequencies the amplitudes @xmath16 can be expressed in terms of parametric derivatives of the on - shell scattering matrix @xmath11 ,    @xmath17    the expansion eq.([eq2 ] ) is equivalent to the nearest sidebands approximation @xcite which implies that a scattered electron can absorb or emit only one energy quantum @xmath18 before it leaves the scattering region .    the kinetic properties ( charge current , heat current , etc . ) which are of interest here depend on the values of the scattering matrix within the energy interval of the order of @xmath19 near the fermi energy .",
    "in the low frequency ( @xmath20 ) and low temperature ( @xmath21 ) limit we assume the scattering matrix to be energy independent .",
    "in a pump setup the mesoscopic scatterer is coupled to reservoirs @xmath22 with the same temperatures @xmath23 = @xmath24 and electrochemical potentials @xmath25 = @xmath26 .",
    "thus electrons with the energy @xmath27 entering the scatterer are described by the fermi distribution function @xmath28 due to the interaction with an oscillating scatterer an electron can absorb or emit an energy quantum @xmath18 that changes the distribution function .",
    "our aim is to find the distribution function for outgoing particles ( i.e. , for electrons leaving the mesoscopic sample and entering the reservoir ) far from the scatterer .",
    "let us consider a single transverse channel in one of the leads .",
    "we introduce two kinds of carriers @xcite .",
    "first , incoming particles which are going from the reservoir to the scatterer . and , second , outgoing particles which are leaving the scattering region .",
    "we can express the operators @xmath29 which annihilate outgoing carriers in the lead @xmath7 in terms of operators @xmath30 annihilating incoming electrons @xcite in lead @xmath8 . applying the hypothesis of an instant scattering we can write    @xmath31    here",
    "@xmath32 is an element of the scattering matrix @xmath11 ; the time dependent operator is @xmath33 = @xmath34 , and the energy dependent operators obey the following anticommutation relations @xcite @xmath35 =   \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta}\\delta(e - e').\\ ] ] note that above expressions correspond to single ( transverse ) channel leads and spinless electrons . for the case of many - channel leads",
    "each lead index ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 , etc . ) includes a transverse channel index and any repeating lead index implies implicitly a summation over all the transverse channels in the lead . similarly an electron spin can be taken into account .    using eq.([eq2 ] ) and eq.([eq4 ] )",
    "we obtain @xcite    @xmath36    the distribution function for electrons leaving the scatterer through the lead @xmath7 is @xmath37 = @xmath38 , where @xmath39 means quantum - mechanical averaging . substituting eq.([eq5 ] )",
    "we find    @xmath40    note that the distribution function for outgoing carriers is a nonequilibrium distribution function generated by the nonstationary scatterer .",
    "the above expression gives a simple physical interpretation for the fourier amplitudes of the scattering matrix .",
    "@xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) is the probability for an electron entering the scatterer through the lead @xmath8 and leaving the scatterer through the lead @xmath7 to emit ( to absorb ) an energy quantum @xcite @xmath18 .",
    "note that @xmath43 is the probability for the same scattering without the change of an energy . below we will use eq.([eq6 ] ) to analyze the kinetics of a pump .",
    "to be definite we take currents from the scatterer to the reservoirs to be positive . using the distribution functions @xmath44 for incoming electrons and @xmath45 for outgoing electrons",
    "we find for the dc - current @xmath46 in the lead @xmath7 far from the scatterer    @xmath47 . \\label{eq7}\\ ] ]    substituting eq.([eq6 ] ) we get    @xmath48 . \\label{eq8}\\ ] ]    here we have introduced the total probabilities for electrons scattered into the lead @xmath7 ( irrespective of the lead through which they entered the scattering region ) to absorb @xmath49 or to emit @xmath50 an energy quantum @xmath18    @xmath51    we see that only a scatterer with the property    @xmath52    can pump current into the lead @xmath7 .",
    "it is useful to express these probabilities in terms of a bare scattering matrix @xmath11 . to this end",
    "we introduce a generalized parametric emissivity matrix @xmath53 $ ]    @xmath54 = -\\frac{1}{2\\pi i }    \\frac{d\\hat s}{dx}\\hat s^\\dagger . \\label{eq9b}\\ ] ]    with matrix elements    @xmath55 =   -\\frac{1}{2\\pi i }    \\sum_\\gamma \\frac{ds_{\\alpha\\gamma}}{dx } s^*_{\\beta\\gamma}. \\label{eq9ba}\\ ] ]    the diagonal element @xmath56 $ ] of the parametric emissivity matrix @xcite is the charge that leaves the sample through contact @xmath7 in response to a variation of the parameter @xmath57 .",

    "we express the probabilities @xmath60 given by eq.([eq9 ] ) in terms of the matrix elements of the parametric emissivity matrix ( to lowest order in @xmath14 )    @xmath61   \\right|^2 . \\label{eq9c}\\ ] ]    the quantities @xmath60 admit a simple interpretation in the quasi - particle picture . due to scattering the electron system gains an energy from the nonstationary ( oscillating ) scatterer .",
    "absorption of an energy quantum @xmath18 leads to creation of a nonequilibrium ( quasi-)electron - hole pair . note that at any temperature @xmath62 equilibrium electron - hole pairs exist .",
    "this nonequilibrium pair is neutral but transfers an energy @xmath18 . from eq.([eq6 ] ) it follows that @xmath63 is proportional to the number of nonequilibrium quasi - electrons ( holes ) leaving the scattering region through the lead @xmath7 .",
    "the electron and hole ( belonging to the same pair ) can be scattered either into one lead ( see fig.[fig1].a ) or into different leads ( see fig.[fig1].b ) .",
    "if they are scattered into the same lead they do not contribute to the current .",
    "but if they are scattered into different leads they do contribute .",
    "in any case they contribute to the heat transfer from the oscillating scatterer into the reservoirs .",
    "the dc - current @xmath46 in the lead @xmath7 can be represented as a sum of two contributions @xmath46 = @xmath64 + @xmath65 , where @xmath64 = @xmath66 and @xmath65 = @xmath67 are currents carried by nonequilibrium quasi - electrons and holes , respectively ( here e ( -e ) is an electron ( a hole ) charge ) .",
    "now we will show that current is conserved , i.e. , @xmath68 . to this end",
    "we use the fact that the scattering matrix is unitary    @xmath69    for the expansion eq.([eq2 ] ) this leads to the relations    @xmath70 = \\delta_{\\alpha\\beta } , \\label{eq11}\\ ] ]    @xmath71    @xmath72    multiplying eq.([eq12 ] ) and eq.([eq13 ] ) by parts , summing the result over @xmath7 and taking into account eq.([eq9 ] ) we obtain ( neglecting the higher powers of @xmath73 )    @xmath74    using eqs.([eq8 ] ) and ( [ eq14 ] ) we see that the scatterer does not produce any current @xmath75 = 0 but it can only push a current from some reservoir to another reservoir .",
    "an alternative ( but equivalent ) way to find the dc - current is to average the time - dependent current @xmath76 the current operator is @xcite    @xmath77 .",
    "\\label{eq15}\\ ] ]    substituting eqs.([eq2 ] ) and ( [ eq4 ] ) into eq.([eq15 ] ) and performing quantum mechanical and time averaging we obtain eq.([eq8 ] ) .",
    "note that in a pump setup where the external reservoirs are at the same macroscopic conditions ( electrochemical potential , temperature , etc . ) and a periodic in time perturbation is applied directly to the mesoscopic conductor there is no linear regime for dc transport ( only ac currents are linear in perturbation ) . the dc - currents ( charge , heat , etc . )",
    "are of a quantum mechanical nature and arise because of a nonlinear ( quadratic ) dependence on the quantum - mechanical ( scattering ) amplitudes ( see eq.([eq9 ] ) ) .",
    "particles traversing the sample absorb energy from a time dependent scatterer and carry it into the reservoirs .",
    "we assume that the reservoirs are large enough to absorb this energy and to remain still in thermal equilibrium . in the leads",
    "the energy is transferred by electrons only ( we neglect any inelastic processes in the leads ) .",
    "thus to calculate @xcite an energy flow @xmath78 entering the reservoir @xmath7 we can use an electron distribution function and write    @xmath79 .",

    "the existence of a dc - current eq.([eq8 ] ) requires a special condition ( see eq.([eq9a ] ) ) .",
    "another difference is that the heat flow is directed ( at any lead ) from the scatterer to the reservoir ( if all the reservoirs are at the same temperature ) but the charge flow , if it exists , can be directed either from the reservoir to the scatterer ( at some lead ) or vice versa ( at another lead ) because of charge conservation .",
    "the quasi - particle description gives a simple physical interpretation of eq.([eq17 ] ) .",
    "we can say that the heat is transported by two kinds of quasi - particles , the quasi - electrons and holes .",
    "each quasi - particle has an energy @xmath81 ( on average ) .",
    "this is because the absorption of each energy quantum @xmath18 creates two quasi - particles , a quasi - electron and a hole .",
    "thus the heat ( energy ) transferred by quasi - electrons and holes is @xmath82 = @xmath83 and @xmath84 = @xmath85 , respectively ( the quasi - electron @xmath64 and hole @xmath65 currents are defined in the previous section after eq.([eq9c ] ) ) .",
    "the sum of these contributions gives eq.([eq17 ] )",
    "the problem of current noise in a quantum pump is closely connected with the problem of quantization of the charge pumped in one cycle @xcite . on the other hand",
    "the noise in mesoscopic phase coherent conductors is interesting in itself @xcite because it is very sensitive to quantum - mechanical interference effects and can give additional information about the scattering matrix .    to describe the current - current fluctuations we will use the correlation function @xcite    @xmath86    where @xmath87 = @xmath88 - @xmath89 and @xmath90 is the quantum - mechanical current operator in the lead @xmath7 given by eq.([eq15 ] ) .",

    "in addition to the probabilities @xmath60 which determine the dc current eq.([eq8 ] ) and heat flow eq.([eq17 ] ) there appears a third key quantity @xmath109 , which describes the effect of correlations between ( quasi-)particles .",
    "similarly to @xmath60 ( see eqs.([eq9c ] ) ) this probability can be expressed in terms of a generalized emissivity matrix @xmath110 ( see eq.([eq9b ] ) )    @xmath111   \\right|^2 . \\label{eq24a}\\ ] ]    note that there is no summation over @xmath7 or @xmath8 : consequently this probability which determines the current cross - correlation is directly proportional to the off - diagonal element of the emissivity matrix .",
    "now we will analyze the noise power eq.([eq23 ] ) .",
    "we can see that the current cross - correlations @xmath104 ( @xmath59 ) produced by the pump are negative : that is quite general for nonequilibrium noise in the system of fermions @xcite .",
    "the noise generated by the pump obeys the following sum rules @xcite @xmath112 = @xmath113 = 0 .",
    "this is a straightforward consequence of an instant scattering description applied here . indeed , using eqs.([eq4]),([eq10 ] ) and",
    "( [ eq15 ] ) we can see that the conservation law holds not only for a quantum averaged current @xmath114 but for a current operator as well @xcite : @xmath115 .",
    "thus the current correlations @xmath116 must obey the same sum rule .    the function @xmath107 describes the effect of thermal fluctuation on shot noise and determines the dependence of the noise on the pump frequency @xmath0 . at sufficiently high temperature @xmath117 the noise eq.([eq23 ] ) is quadratic in @xmath0 .",
    "this is in agreement with ref .. but at low temperature @xmath118 the noise is linear in @xmath0 and this is in agreement with the counting statistics calculations of levitov @xcite .    next consider the three terms in the brackets of the r.h.s . of eq.([eq23 ] ) .",
    "consider the low temperature limit @xmath119 and devide the expression for noise into two parts @xmath104 = @xmath120 + @xmath121 .",
    "the first part @xmath122,\\ ] ] is due to an uncorrelated movement of nonequilibrium quasi - electrons and holes . to verify this we apply the schottky formula @xcite for shot noise @xmath123 = @xmath124 ( here @xmath125 is a particle charge and the index ``",
    "q '' means that the current is carried by the particles with the charge q ) . substituting the current carried by the",
    "quasi - electrons @xmath64 = @xmath66 and by the holes @xmath65 = @xmath126 ( here e(-e ) is an electron ( hole ) charge ) into schottky s formula we obtain @xmath127 = @xmath128 + @xmath129 ( in the literature the schottky result is referred as the poisson value of shot noise that we indicate by the upper index `` p '' ) .",
    "the second part @xmath130 is due to correlations between quasi - electrons and holes .",
    "these correlations are a consequence of the common origin of the electron and hole forming a pair and their subsequent scattering into different leads fig.[fig1].b .",
    "thus we can say that the cross - correlations are exclusively due to dissolving ( neutral ) electron - hole pairs .",
    "because of charge conservation this gives a simple explanation of a negative sign of cross - correlations in our case eq.([eq23 ] ) .",
    "note that schottky s result gives no correlations between currents at different leads . due to",
    "@xmath131 the current correlation at the same lead @xmath132 is below the poisson value @xmath133 and the fano factor characterizing the deviation of the actual shot noise from the poisson noise ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) @xmath134 = @xmath135 is , in general , less than unity .",
    "we would like to emphasize that when we calculate the poisson value of shot noise we do not use the total current @xmath46 in the lead @xmath7 but we calculate the sum of the poisson noises produced by both the quasi - electrons ( the current is @xmath64 ) and the holes ( the current is @xmath65 ) .",
    "in this section we consider a simple but a quite generic case of a two - terminal mesoscopic conductor with a time - reversal symmetry ( without magnetic fluxes ) .",
    "in addition we assume that the external , time - dependent parameters @xmath5 do not change the total charge on a sample ( if this is not the case we need to take into account the self - consistent internal potential @xcite ) . in this case",
    "we can choose the scattering matrix as follows ( we consider spinless electrons )    @xmath136    here @xmath137 and @xmath138 are the reflection and the transmission probability , respectively ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "we assume the quantities @xmath140 to be the functions of external parameters @xmath141 ( see eq.([eq1 ] ) ) .",
    "if only one external parameter @xmath57 is varied then we get from eq.([eq3 ] ) @xmath41 = @xmath42 for any @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",

    "in this work we have developed the approach to the kinetics of an adiabatic quantum pump for an arbitrary relation of pump frequency and temperature .",
    "our consideration is based on the scattering matrix approach for ac - transport .",
    "this approach takes into account the existence of the side bands of particles exiting the pump and thus allows a description of the quantum statistical correlation properties ( e.g. , noise ) of an adiabatic quantum pump .",

    "we find that our results for the pump current , the heat flow and the noise can all be expressed in terms of a parametric emissivity matrix .",
    "in particular we find that the current cross - correlations of a multiterminal pump are directly related a to a non - diagonal element of the parametric emissivity matrix .    using the quasi - particle picture we have given a simple physical interpretations of processes leading to charge and energy transfer in the system . due to the oscillations of the scatterer the electron system gains energy ( the side bands arise ) .",
    "absorption of an energy quantum @xmath18 leads to the creation of a nonequilibrium ( quasi-)electron - hole pair .",
    "these quasi - particles carry energy from the scatterer to the reservoirs . on average",
    "the electron - hole pair is neutral thus the pump is not a source of a charge current but under some conditions @xcite can only push charge from some reservoirs to others .",
    "these conditions can be realized if the quasi - electron and hole ( belonging to the same pair ) leave the scatterer through different leads ( say , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) . in this case",
    "these quasi - particles contribute to the charge transfer between the reservoirs @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "these quasiparticles are correlated since they are created in the same event .",
    "this is also the source of the correlations between the currents at the leads @xmath7 and @xmath8 ( cross - correlations ) .",
    "thus we conclude that the existence of the dc - current in a weak amplitude pump is always accompanied by current correlations ( shot noise )",
    ". this type of a pump can not be optimal ( in particular , noiseless ) in the sense of ref.@xcite .    to assess the possibility of an optimal adiabatic quantum pump further investigations are necessary .",
    "in particular large amplitude variations of the external parameter have to be considered .",
    "we hope that by taking into account many photon processes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) the approach developed in the present paper can be generalized to the case of a strong amplitude adiabatic quantum pump .",
