    "the discovery of new superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 took the world by surprise @xcite .",

    "on the other hand the anisotropy in @xmath5 suggested an anisotropic @xmath6-wave model @xcite .",
    "further it is clear that the simple two gap model can not describe the strong temperature dependence of @xmath7 observed in single crystal mgb@xmath0 @xcite . for this",
    "we need an order parameter @xmath8 of oblate shape @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", it is well known that @xmath9 and @xmath10 for single crystal experiments @xcite , which contradicts the ginzburg - landau phenomenology .",
    "further , both magnetic penetration depth data and @xmath11 data suggest a prolate order parameter as in @xcite . indeed , an earlier stm study suggested a prolate order parameter as well @xcite .",
    "is the order parameter prolate or oblate ?",
    "the answer is that we need both .",
    "we suggest , that the oblate order parameter is attached to the @xmath2-band while the prolate order parameter to the @xmath3-band . in the following",
    "we shall describe salient features of single crystal mgb@xmath0 within the present model .",
    "we just point out two features in the upper critical field which are outside of the ginzburg - landau phenomenology .",
    "\\(a ) the strong temperature dependence of the anisotropy parameter @xmath7 @xcite . ( b )",
    "second the deviation from the effective mass model @xmath12 @xcite .",
    "for example @xmath13 , where @xmath14 and @xmath15 can describe the temperature dependence of @xmath16 , as has been shown in ref . @xcite . also , by fitting the experimental data we obtained @xmath17  cm / sec and @xmath18 .",
    "we point out that these values are very consistent with the ones for the @xmath2-band @xcite .    by fitting experimental data for @xmath19",
    "@xcite close to @xmath20 we can deduce the ratio @xmath21 , implying @xmath22 , for example . this result is bigger than that estimated in our previous analysis of @xmath23 @xcite .",
    "next order correction in @xmath24 leads to the increase of the ratio @xmath25 for the same values of the parameter @xmath26 . in the future we are going to elaborate our study of the upper critical field behavior in mgb@xmath0 by taking into account impurity scattering , what we believe will improve the agreement with experiment",
    "> from @xmath27-axis oriented films and single crystals , the superfluid density @xmath28 and the lower critical fields @xmath29 and @xmath30 have been extracted reliably @xcite .",
    "it is clear this time that we need a prolate order parameter to fit these data .",
    "we choose @xmath31 with @xmath32 .",
    "these values give a good fit of penetration depth data @xcite .",
    "the magnetic penetration depths are related to the lower critical fields via the formulas @xmath33 where @xmath34 and @xmath35 are the magnetic penetration depth with the supercurrent in the ab - plane and in parallel to the c - axis , respectively .",
    "they are related to the superfluid density via @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "taking @xmath38 , which fits @xmath39 from ref .",
    "@xcite , we calculate @xmath40 and obtain the temperature dependences of @xmath29 and @xmath30 from eqs .",

    "[ fig2 ] along with the experimental results from ref . @xcite . from these fits",
    "we obtain @xmath41  mt and @xmath42  mt . from this the ratio of the relevant fermi velocities can be estimated as @xmath43 . in other words ,",
    "the corresponding fermi surface is more isotropic and further @xmath44 .",
    "this strongly suggests that the prolate order parameter we are considering has to be associated with the @xmath3-band .",
    "( dashed line ) and @xmath30 ( solid line ) along with the corresponding experimental data from ref.@xcite . ,",
    "we have seen so far that we need two energy gaps of different shape in order to describe @xmath5 and @xmath45 .",
    "the temperature dependence of @xmath16 indicates that an oblate order parameter ( @xmath46 ) dominates the behavior at high magnetic field .",
    "also we need @xmath47 .",
    "this suggests the cylindrical fermi surface associated with the @xmath2-band as the carrier of this order parameter . on the other hand , for @xmath45",
    "we need a prolate order parameter ( @xmath31 ) .",
    "also , the anisotropy in @xmath45 suggests the @xmath3-band as the carrier of this order parameter . in other words , if we assume that the high field properties are controlled by the oblate order parameter attached to the @xmath2-band , while the low field properties are due to the prolate order parameter attached to the @xmath3-band , we have a consistent picture for superconductivity in mgb@xmath0 ."
