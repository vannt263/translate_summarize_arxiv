    "the magnitude and direction of photocurrents in semiconductors are ordinarily controlled using applied bias voltages .",

    "are simultaneously coupled using two coherent excitations : one photon excitation at frequency @xmath2 and two photon excitation at @xmath1 .",
    "the coherent superposition of these two excitations can lead to a polar asymmetry in the momentum space distribution of the excited photocarriers and therefore to a net photocurrent .",
    "the effect has been discussed theoretically @xcite and observed experimentally in photoyield from atoms @xcite and for photocurrents in semiconductors @xcite .",
    "recently , two of us have proposed that for carbon nanotubes this effect could provide directional control of a photocurrent along the tube axis @xcite and even suggests a novel method for biasing the diffusion of ionic species which intercalate within the nanotubes .    in this paper",
    "we study the excitations which lead to this effect both for graphene sheets and for carbon nanotubes . in both",
    "these systems the low energy electronic properties relevant to most solid state effects are determined by an interesting feature of the band structure .",
    "the isolated graphene sheet has only an incipient fermi surface ; it is actually a zero gap semiconductors where the conduction and valence bands meet at precise points in momentum space .",
    "the carbon nanotube is a cylindrical tubule formed by wrapping a graphene sheet and for metallic tubes the  zero gap \" feature manifests itself in a peculiar doubling of the low energy electronic spectrum with  pairs \" of forward and backward moving excitations at both @xmath3 and @xmath4 @xcite . in either case",
    "the low energy electronic spectra are described by a two component dirac hamiltonian @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we develop the theory of phase coherent one- and two- photon excitation within this model .",
    "the application to the graphene sheet turns out to be a useful pedagogical model which is unusual for a semiconductor and nicely illustrates the origin of phase coherent control of photocurrents for a graphene derived system . for graphene",
    "it is inappropriate to analyze the third order nonlinearity by analogy with the third order response in atomic systems , as has been done previously for semiconductors@xcite .",
    "instead we find that the third order response probes the rather unique geometry of the extended low energy electronic eigenstates which occur within the graphene sheet .",
    "the application of the model to a carbon nanotube shows , interestingly , that the third order nonlinearity is suppressed for excitations between the lowest subbands of any conducting nanotube and vanishes completely for transitions between the lowest subbands of a conducting  armchair \" tube , but it is nonzero and robust for the gapped subbands of a semiconducting tube .",
    "in fact the effects we calculate are significantly stronger for semiconducting nanotubes than for a conventional semiconductor . in principle",
    "this effect might be used to distinguish conducting and semiconducting tubes in a compositionally mixed sample .",
    "other possible applications of the idea will be discussed later in the paper .    in this paper",

    "in this section we briefly review the effective mass description of the low energy electronic states .",
    "the theory is developed for an ideal graphene sheet , a section of which is shown in figure 1 .",
    "the primitive cell of this structure contains two atoms , labelled a and b in the figure .",
    "the lattice is unchanged after a translation by any combination of the two primitive translations vectors @xmath5 where the bond length @xmath6 .",
    "we introduce a pair of primitive translation vectors for the reciprocal lattice @xmath7 such that @xmath8 , yielding @xmath9 which generate a triangular lattice in reciprocal space .",
    "= 3.0 in    the critical points k(k ) are important to our discussion , and they occur at the corners of the brillouin zone of this reciprocal lattice at the positions @xmath10 the  bonding \" and  antibonding \" @xmath11 electron bands meet precisely at these k(k ) points in reciprocal space . this band touching is required by symmetry for this system and it is correctly described by the simplest model for electron propagation within the graphene sheet which is a tight binding model in which the hopping of an electron between neighboring sites is set by a single energy , t. thus we have @xmath12 working in the sublattice basis and at crystal momentum @xmath13 we have the hamiltonian @xmath14 if we set @xmath15 and expand the hamiltonian for @xmath16 we obtain the long wavelength hamiltonian @xmath17 where @xmath18 are the @xmath19 pauli matrices .",
    "a similar expansion near the k point yields @xmath20 identifying each of the critical points with the index @xmath21 so that @xmath22 denotes the k point and @xmath23 denotes the k point , these hamiltonians can be rotated into diagonal form with the unitary operators @xmath24 where @xmath25 .",
    "thus @xmath26 so that equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) describe pairs of bands which disperse linearly away from the critical k and k points .",
    "note also that @xmath27 as expected .",

    "@xmath42 and @xmath43 commute along these special lines in reciprocal space , so that interband transitions are forbidden along this trajectory .",
    "this peculiar feature can be traced to the absence of a mass term in the effective hamiltonians in equations ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) which would ordinarily mix the plane wave solutions to ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) and thereby allow interband transitions by coupling with the long wavelength current operator . when @xmath41 and @xmath29 are not collinear interband transitions are allowed and the transition amplitudes are fixed by the mismatch in their orientations in the graphene plane .",
    "this has interesting consequences for possible coherent control of nonlinear optical processes in the nanotubes , as we show below .",
    "in this section we present a calculation of the transition probabilities for the third order nonlinear optical excitations among the electronic states given by the models in sections ii and iii .",
    "we introduce time varying fields of the form @xmath44 and study the response of the system to third order in these exciting fields .",
    "asymmetries in the photocurrent are controlled by the coherent excitation of electrons from an initial state to a final state by one photon ( @xmath0 ) and by two one photon ( @xmath1 ) processes .",
    "the coherent mixing of these two processes is studied by evolving the density matrix to third order in the exciting fields and isolating the terms proportional to @xmath45 .",
    "it is convenient to study the time evolution of the one particle density matrix @xmath46 .",

    "the density matrix in the initial state has the form @xmath51 since only the negative energy states of the hamiltonians ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) are initially occupied .",
    "we expand the density matrix order by order in the exciting fields @xmath52 integrating equation ( 17 ) to first order in the applied fields gives @xmath53 where @xmath54 where @xmath55 and @xmath56 is a positive infinitesimal .",
    "the second order terms @xmath57 include the lowest order changes to the occupation probabilities which can be induced with excitation by the @xmath58 or the @xmath0 fields @xmath59 as well as oscillating nonlinear off diagonal coherence terms @xmath60 anticipating the situation @xmath61 , the most important contribution to @xmath62 has the form @xmath63 the second order coherence term in equation ( 22 ) leads to a transition rate which is third order in the applied fields and is the source of the polar asymmetry of the photocurrent .",
    "@xmath64 equation ( 23 ) contains a factor of two from the sum over the ( physical ) spins .",
    "equation ( 23 ) presents the main result of the paper .",
    "it shows that the transition rate depends on the polarization and phases of both exciting fields and the bloch wavevector @xmath65 .",
    "we will explore the consequences of the geometric structure of this result for the graphene sheet and for carbon nanotubes in the following two sections . for the moment we note that the result is odd in the direction of the bloch wavevector @xmath66 and even in the critical point index @xmath21 ( it depends on @xmath67 ) and",
    "therefore the symmetry breaking nonlinearity is nonzero after integration over the full brillouin zone .",
    "in this section we apply the formalism developed in section iii to study the coherent optical control of photocurrents for a single graphene sheet .",
    "the model nicely illustrates the selection rules which apply in this geometry , and the results can be extended to analyze the more complex situation for the nanotube which will be presented in section vi .",
    "we note that both equations ( 20 ) and ( 23 ) contain terms which describe transitions from the valence to the conduction band at the frequency @xmath68 .",
    "equation ( 20 ) is the ordinary linear absorption in the material .",
    "interestingly we see that the angular distribution of the excited photocarriers is not isotropic but rather follows a @xmath69 dependence with respect to the polarization of the exciting radiation .",
    "nevertheless this angular distribution has even parity and thus does not produce a net current . on the other hand equation ( 23 )",
    "gives an angular distribution that breaks the inversion symmetry of the graphene sheet .",
    "the symmetry breaking is actually implicit in the coherent superposition of the exciting fields .",
    "we will estimate the prefactors to compare the relative strengths of these terms for accessible laboratory fields later in the paper ; for the moment we note that the nonlinear terms in equation ( 23 ) typically contribute @xmath70 of the total transition rate , and thus the induced anisotropy while nonzero ( and we believe measurable ) is a subtle effect .    the angular distribution in equation ( 23 )",
    "is controlled by the relative polarizations and phases of the incident @xmath71 and @xmath72 fields .",
    "figure 2 displays polar plots of the angular distributions for the situation where the amplitudes are in phase ( i.e. @xmath71 and @xmath72 in equation ( 14 ) are presumed to be real ) for various incident polarizations .",
    "note that the underlying electronic dispersion relations are completely isotropic in the linearized theory , and thus only the relative polarization of the two exciting fields is relevant for the interference pattern . in all cases @xmath71 is taken to be polarized along the horizontal direction shown by the arrow in the plots .",
    "in each plot we observe a node in the current distribution along this direction .",
    "this follows from the symmetry of @xmath73 in equation ( 13 ) which shows that interband coupling is prohibited for @xmath66 parallel to @xmath29 .",
    "nonetheless , the situation for collinear @xmath58 and @xmath0 excitation clearly shows the asymmetry between the  forward \" and  backward \" distribution of the photocurrent .",
    "the situation is more interesting when the exciting fields are noncollinear .",
    "we observe that the angular distribution develops a  three \" lobe structure .",
    "ultimately when the exciting fields area mutually orthogonal , we recover the  two lobe \" pattern with the angular distribution rotated by @xmath74 with respect to the polarization of the incident @xmath58 field .",
    "it is useful to quantify the anisotropy of the distribution by calculating the average polarization of the net photocurrent @xmath75 and @xmath76 averaged over this distribution .",
    "one finds @xmath77 so that when the @xmath0 field is tipped by an angle @xmath78 with respect to the @xmath58 field , the photocurrent is oriented in the direction @xmath79 .",
    "finally , the  sign \" of the effect is determined by the relative phases of the two exciting fields .",
    "note that the phase delays @xmath80 and @xmath81 in the exciting fields of equation ( 14 ) modulate the transitions rates@xcite in equation ( 23 ) in the combination @xmath82 this does not change the qualitative features of the angular distribution but it can modify both its magnitude and its sign . thus the angular distribution in the collinear case @xmath83 can be reversed by advancing the phase of the @xmath58 fields by @xmath74 .",
    "in this section we apply the formalism of section iii to study phase coherent control of a photocurrent on a carbon nanotube .",
    "the essential complication is that the wrapped structure of the nanotube quantizes the allowed crystal momenta so that the transition rate automatically contain an intrinsic anisotropy .",
    "nevertheless , the formalism developed in section iii can be extended to include this situation .",
    "we first define the geometry for the single wall nanotube .",
    "the nanotube is a cylinder formed by wrapping graphene sheet and the wrapping can be defined by the graphene superlattice translation vector around the tube waist .",
    "we adopt the primitive vectors of equation ( 1 ) as a basis and represent the superlattice translation @xmath84 as @xmath85 it is useful to define two unit vectors defining the longitudinal and azimuthal directions within the graphene plane @xmath86 where @xmath87 is the chiral angle of the tube .",
    "the wrapping of the tube quantizes the allowed momenta along the azimuthal direction @xmath88 while the electrons obey free particle boundary conditions along the tube direction and the longitudinal component @xmath89 can take any value @xcite .",
    "thus the loci of allowed momenta are  lines \" in reciprocal space .",
    "these lines need not intersect the critical k and k points which are used as a reference for the long wavelength theory . to determine the mismatch between the allowed crystal momenta and the k and k point wavefunctions we resolve the bloch wavevector at k and k into its longitudinal and azimuthal components .",
    "we find @xmath90 and @xmath91 which lies along the locus of allowed wavectors when @xmath92 .",
    "one third of the @xmath93 tubes satisfy this condition , and for the remaining two - thirds of the tubes the k(k ) momenta are mismatched to the kinematically allowed momenta by a mimimum amount @xmath94 representing the  reduced \" bloch wavector with the complex number @xmath95 and the momentum mismatch by @xmath96 after a rotation of the coordinate system by the chiral angle @xmath97 ( so that the x - axis runs parallel to the the tube length ) the hamiltonians in equation ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) can be written @xmath98 note that in equation ( 31 ) @xmath99 .",
    "the spectrum is now @xmath100 and the hamiltonian is diagonalized with the unitary transformation @xmath101 where @xmath102 .",
    "this is the rotation identified in equation ( 8) for the unfolded graphene sheet with @xmath103 playing the role of the y - component of the momentum . with this identification",
    "the interaction hamiltonian for the nanotube analogous to equation ( 13 ) in the band basis is @xmath104 note that the off - diagonal terms which describe the amplitudes for interband transitions depend explicitly on the size of the semiconducting backscattering gap @xmath103 and vanish for the lowest subbands of a conducting nanotube as shown in figure 3 .    3.0 in    thus when the exciting fields are collinear and directed along the tube direction the third order transition rate is @xmath105 equation ( 34 ) is the origin of the asymmetry discussed in reference @xcite .",
    "we note that the result depends on the square of the magnitude of the gap @xmath103 and it vanishes for transitions between the lowest subbands of a conducting tube .",
    "the result is odd in the reduced momentum @xmath106 which produces the asymmetry between forward and backward moving photocarriers .",
    "the third order transition rate is very small for high exciting frequency since the high energy electrons are very weakly backscattered through the mass term in equation ( 31 ) and behave essentially as free particles .",
    "these properties are displayed in figure 4 which shows the third order transition rate between two bands of a semiconducting tube as a function of the exciting frequency .",
    "it is interesting to note that the expected divergence in the one dimensional density of states at threshhold is exactly cancelled by the momentum prefactor @xmath106 in equation ( 36 ) and thus the spectrum shows only a step - like singularity at the threshhold .    3.0 in    thus the transition probability for right and left moving photocarriers jumps discontinuously across the critical point at @xmath107 .",
    "note however that the states near the bandgap have no group velocity and can not contribute to the photocurrent so the velocity weighted transition rate ( which is more relevant to this application ) goes to zero at threshhold .",
    "this is shown by the dashed curve in figure 4 .",
    "the results in figure 4 show the nonlinear injection rate for a perfect defect free semiconducting tube .",
    "a slowly varying impurty potential ( long range disorder in the notation of reference @xcite ) can produce an additional channel for backscattering and will therefore further suppress the group velocity for electronic states near the band edges . in the presence of disorder we therefore expect an additional rounding of the current injection rate , similar to that shown as the dashed curve in figure 4 .",
    "the range and strength of this suppression will depend sensitively on the details of the long range impurity potential",
    ". the results of figure 4 are insensitive to this additional backscattering deeper into the particle - hole continuum .",
    "equation ( 34 ) gives the third order nonlinear response in the long wavelength limit where we can linearize the electronic bands around the critical k(k ) points .",
    "corrections to this result can be obtained in an expansion in @xmath108 and physically arise from crystal field (  trigonal warping \" ) effects in the underlying band structure .",
    "the most significant such corrections occur for conducting tubes .",
    "equation ( 36 ) gives a vanishing transition rate for excitations between the lowest bands of a conducting tube and trigonal warping of the band structure of the graphene sheet provides a mechanism to ",
    "turn on \" these transitions even for conducting tubes .",
    "thus a third order nonlinear response is symmetry allowed for the lowest subbands of a conducting nanotube , though it strictly vanishes in the long wavelength limit we have discussed so far .    to investigate the trigonal warping effects we re - derive the interaction hamiltonian without adopting the effective mass representation . to do this we note that in the presence of a vector potential @xmath29 the hamiltonian ( 5 ) is perturbed through the peierls substitution @xmath109 .",
    "therefore we can calculate the current operator using @xmath110 .",
    "in the site representation the hamiltonian has only off diagonal elements , so we can write @xmath111 we also note that the hamiltonian is diagonalized with the unitary transformation : @xmath112 which is the discrete lattice analog of the continuum result in equation ( 8) .",
    "thus we can rotate the interaction hamiltonian into the band basis according to @xmath113 which gives @xmath114 explicit evaluation of the matrix elements in equation ( 36 ) for a general chiral nanotube is complicated .",
    "_ in general _",
    "one may have interband matrix elements between lowest subbands of a conducting tube ( which are the off diagonal terms in equation ( 37 ) ) ; albeit with greatly reduced magnitudes  the scale of these matrix elements is typically @xmath115 the scale for the matrix elements in ( 31 ) which are produced by the mass term in the linearized theory for a semiconducting tube .",
    "an important exception to this rule for conducting tubes occurs for the armchair ( m , m ) tubes .",
    "then one finds that @xmath116 for propagation in the lowest subbands of the tube , and we have @xmath117 thus near the critical points the diagonal elements of the velocity operator are @xmath118 and the off diagonal components vanish _ everywhere_. note that this occurs because of a tube symmetry ; the armchair tube retains a mirror plane which contains the tube axis so that the two lowest subbands of the conducting tube can be indexed as even or odd under reflection through this mirror plane .",
    "the vector potential along the tube axis is even under the mirror reflection and can not couple even and odd subbands . on the other hand , for a zigzag tube one has @xmath119 .",
    "this vanishes for @xmath120 which corresponds to a  face \" of the brillouin zone in figure 1 .",
    "thus one finds for the conducting zigzag tube : @xmath121 therefore near the crossing point @xmath122 one finds @xmath123 thus the diagonal matrix elements of the velocity operator ( the real part of equation ( 39 ) ) are constant ( @xmath124 ) while the off diagonal elements ( the imaginary part ) vanish proportional to @xmath108 near the fermi points .",
    "this implies that the product of the matrix elements in the third order transition rate vanish as @xmath125 for the conducting zigzag tube .",
    "this changes both the magnitude and the frequency dependence of the third order transion rate .",
    "we obtain @xmath126 the result is plotted in figure 5 using the same normalization as in figure 4 for comparison ( note the scale change ) .",
    "one finds that the transition rate vanishes linearly in frequency , and is suppressed by @xmath115 with respect to the interband transition rate for a semiconducting tube .",
    "this reflects the fact that at low energy the effects of trigonal warping are relatively small compared to the backscattering from the mass term in the low energy hamiltonian for a semiconducting tube . we note that calculations of the frequency dependence of the resonant raman cross section for conducting tubes @xcite show a strong enhancement of the cross section near the first interband threshhold , also demonstrating the suppression of interband transition matrix elements between the lowest conducting subbands in these structures .",
    "3.0 in    figure 5 presents _ only _ the results for excitations coupling the lowest subbands of a conducting tube .",
    "transition rates between gapped subbands are described by equation ( 34 ) so that the transition rate displayed in figure 4 should be superposed on these results .",
    "this situation calculated for a zigzag tube illustrates the generic behavior for a a general ( m , n ) tube if one wishes to calculate beyond the linearized theory .",
    "analogous results for arbitrary chiral tubes can be obtained by direct evaluation of the matrix elements in equation ( 37 ) .",
    "this treatment can be extended to include the situation where the exciting fields are not collinear .",
    "interestingly , this does not change the qualitative frequency dependence shown in figure 4 , although the prefactor is altered for noncollinear fields .",
    "we will consider only the case where the exciting fields are orthogonal , since any incident field can be resolved into its longitudinal ( along the tube ) and transverse ( perpendicular to the tube ) components .",
    "we observe that for a field perpendicular to the tube axis we have allowed interband transitions only when the azimuthal quantum number @xmath127 changes by @xmath128 since the vector potential @xmath129  seen \" in the tangent plane of the tube is @xmath130 where @xmath131 is a unit vector which circulates counterclockwise around the tube waist .",
    "for the graphene sheet this is equivalent to introducing a spatially varying vector potential with wavevector @xmath132 where @xmath133 is the tube radius .",
    "thus the third order nonlinear process we are seeking is symmetry forbidden if @xmath72 has a transverse polarization ( the lowest subbands have the same azimuthal quantum numbers . )",
    "however , it is possible to have the situation shown in figure 6 , where @xmath71 is perpendicular to the tube axis , and @xmath72 is polarized along the tube direction . here",
    "the virtual intermediate state for the two - photon process is provided by a higher azimuthal subband .",
    "1.5 in    this reduces the strength of the effect , but not the overall frequency dependence which is controlled by dispersion of the lowest azimuthal subband that is accessed to second order in @xmath71 .",
    "we modify the interaction hamiltonian equation ( 33 ) for the situation where the exciting radiation is polarized perpendicular to the tube direction . in the  site \"",
    "basis one finds that the interaction hamiltonian for this polarization is @xmath134 where @xmath135 .",
    "the @xmath136 dependence implies that ths interaction couples subbands with a difference in azimuthal quantum numbers @xmath127 such that @xmath137 and we will explicitly condsider only the two low energy pairs of subbands as shown in figure 6 , which we label 1 and 2 .",
    "the hamiltonian in equation ( 42 ) can now be rotated into the band basis using the unitary rotations of equation ( 32 ) in the combination @xmath138 which gives @xmath139 thus the second order coherence term ( analogous to equation ( 22 ) for the graphene sheet ) is @xmath140 the coherence factor appearing in ( 44 ) can be re - expressed in terms of the hamiltonian parameters @xmath141 where @xmath142 and @xmath103 is the lowest gap of the semiconducting tube .",
    "note that the effect vanishes for @xmath143 i.e. between subbands of the same azimuthal symmetry .",
    "the second order coherence factor leads to the symmetry breaking third order transition rate @xmath144 which has exactly the same frequency dependence as the result of equation ( 34 ) .",
    "third order phase coherent control of photocurrents have been studied and demonstrated for semiconductors ( e.g. gaas @xcite ) and since the effects calculated for carbon nanotubes are strongest for semiconducting tubes , it is appropriate to compare these effects .",
    "we find that the predicted effects are significantly stronger in nanotubes than for conventional semiconductors .",
    "this occurs because of the larger carrier velocities and the longer carrier relaxation times which are expected for the nanotubes . for carbon nanotubes",
    "this is particularly interesting since this third order nonlinearity provides a method for current injection without contacts .",
    "it has proven experimentally difficult to fabricate low resistance electrical contacts with carbon nanotubes by conventional submicron lithographic methods .    for an incident intensity",
    "@xmath145 the electric field amplitude @xmath146 . at an optical frequency @xmath147",
    "this corresponds to a vector potential amplitude @xmath148 ( which is the value used in obtaining the results in figures 4 and 5 . )",
    "then we find that the typical carrier injection rate @xmath149 per unit cell . for hot photo - excited carriers the relaxation rate",
    "is presumed to be dominated by phonon emission , for which we estimate a carrier relaxation time @xmath150 so the steady state distribution gives @xmath151 carriers per tube unit cell ( note that the unit cell contains typically 40 - 60 carbon atoms around the tube circumference ) .",
    "summing over the electron and hole contributions to the photcurrent and over the two electronic branches ( k and k ) we obtain an induced current @xmath152 0.4 na , or an effective current density @xmath153 .",
    "this is @xmath154 larger than the induced density predicted for third order transitions between the valence and conduction bands in gaas @xcite .",
    "the enhancement is due mainly to the relatively large carrier velocity for the carbon nanotubes , and the larger estimated carrier relaxation times . for conducting tubes",
    "this enhancement is partially offset by the _ small _ interband matrix elements between the lowest subbands of conducting tubes ; for a conducting zigzag tube we estimate the photocurrent density @xmath155 under the same assumptions , a value which is comparable to that found for conventional semiconductors @xcite .",
    "we note that even with these long carrier relaxation times , one should be able to achieve a steady state distribution during a 100 ns incident pulse . for conducting nanotubes",
    "one has the additional difficulty of resolving this signal over a background free carrier density @xmath156 produced by ordinary one - photon excitation between the lowest subbands ( first term in equation ( 20 ) ) .",
    "since this is a  non - polar \" contribution , i.e. it does not contribute to the photocurrent , the nonlinear contribution can be identified , in principle .",
    "the angular distributions calculated for interband excitations in graphene sheets show a similar structure to the angular dependence calculated for the third order rate for transitions from the heavy hole band to the conduction band in gaas@xcite . in both cases",
    "the net induced current is polarized along the direction of the exciting field , but the current distribution is peaked _ away _ from the field direction .",
    "the high symmetry of the graphene sheet provides an additional interesting degree of freedom , namely control of the direction of the injected current by controlling the _ relative _ polarizations of the incident fields , as displayed in figure 2 .",
    "it would be very interesting to carry out experiments on graphite ( either bulk or thin films ) to verify the predicted angular dependence .",
    "quantitative studies of the magnitude of the effect would be very useful as a probe of the scattering processes which control the dynamics of hot photoexcited carriers in these systems .",
    "we note that previous experiments on gaas have observed the third order nonlinearity , but with an amplitude which is an order of magnitude smaller than predicted theoretically .    for carbon nanotubes",
    ", one can anticipate at least three interesting applications of this phenomenon .",
    "first , as noted above , the method provides a means for current injection without electrical contacts .",
    "the absence of  low resistance \" contacts on carbon nanotubes has often made it difficult to explore low energy transport phenomena in these systems @xcite .",
    "a particularly interesting experiment would be to use the third order nonlinearity to produce a steady state separation of charge in a carbon nanotube rope or mat . in this state the  driving force \" which produces a photocurrent via the third order nonlinearity would be balanced by the internal electric field produced by charge separation ( in an open circuit condition ) .",
    "the relaxation of this charge distribution after the driving fields are turned off directly measures the conductivity _ along _ the pathways for charge motion in the system .",
    "thus measurement of the transient relaxation after pulsed excitation would provide an interesting probe of the microscopic conductivity in this structurally heterogeneous system .",
    "second , one can imagine applications which make use of the enhancement of the effect on semiconducting tubes ( and its suppression in conducting tubes ) to isolate semiconducting and conducting species in compositionally mixed samples .",
    "finally , momentum transfer from the photoxcited carriers to intercalated ionic species can be used in principle to bias the diffusion of atomic or molecular species in the current carrying state .",

    "<S> coherent one photon ( @xmath0 ) and two photon ( @xmath1 ) electronic excitations are studied for graphene sheets and for carbon nanotubes using a long wavelength theory for the low energy electronic states . for graphene sheets </S>",
    "<S> we find that coherent superposition of these excitations produces a polar asymmetry in the momentum space distribution of the excited carriers with an angular dependence which depends on the relative polarization and phases of the incident fields . for semiconducting nanotubes </S>",
    "<S> we find a similar effect which depends on the square of the semiconducting gap , and we calculate its frequency dependence . we find that the third order nonlinearity which controls the direction of the photocurrent is robust for semiconducting tubes and vanishes in the continuum theory for conducting tubes . </S>",
    "<S> we calculate corrections to these results arising from higher order crystal field effects on the band structure and briefly discuss some applications of the theory . </S>"
