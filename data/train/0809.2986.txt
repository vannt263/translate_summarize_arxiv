    "lipids are polymer molecules composed of hydrophobic acyl chains attached to a hydrophilic polar head group . in the presence of a polar solvent ( e.g. , water ) lipids can spontaneously self - assemble to form a bilayer membrane ( fig .",
    "[ lipid ] ) .",
    "the fluid ( l@xmath6 ) phase of lipid bilayers behaves as a two dimensional ( 2d ) fluid and the lateral 2d self - diffusion coefficient of individual lipids within a leaflet of the bilayer has been determined both experimentally by a variety of methods @xcite and through computer simulations @xcite .",
    "the experiments suggests that there are at least two relevant length / time scales associated with the lateral diffusion of lipids in a bilayer .",
    "experiments designed to probe motion on picosecond ( ps ) time scales measure a diffusion coefficient @xmath7 that can be one to two orders of magnitude larger than the diffusion coefficient @xmath8 measured in experiments which probe motion on tens or hundreds of nanosecond ( ns ) time scales .",
    "there have been several models used to explain the difference in the diffusion coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 .",
    "vaz and almeida @xcite suggested a free - volume jump - diffusion model where the lipid moves in discrete steps when a void forms next to the lipid .",
    "after a jump , the lipid can either return to its original position or another lipid can jump into the empty space left behind . in this model ,",
    "the short time diffusion coefficient @xmath7 is associated with the `` rattling '' motion of the lipid inside the `` cage '' created by the surrounding lipids .",
    "the jump diffusion mechanism was investigated by falck _ _ et al.__@xcite in a simulation of diyristoyl - phosphatidylcholine ( dmpc ) bilayers , and they did not observe enough jump events to provide evidence for the jump diffusion model . to explain their md simulation results of a dmpc bilayer , wohlert and edholm @xcite proposed a model where the motion of the lipid in the plane of the bilayer can be regarded as diffusion ( with a coefficient @xmath7 ) confined in a circular `` cage '' whose center undergoes free diffusion ( with a coefficient @xmath8 ) .",
    "the two diffusion coefficients obtained by fitting their simulated data to the analytical solution of this model were in reasonable agreement with the experimental values .",
    "none of the above diffusion models explicitly take into account the microscopic polymeric structure of lipids , but effects of this structure has been observed in simulations . for example , doxastakis _ et al . _",
    "@xcite observed in a md simulation of 1,2-dipalmitoyl - sn - glycero-3-phosphocholine ( dppc ) bilayers that the atoms at the ends of the lipid tails fluctuate more than those in the head group , but the overall diffusion of the lipid is limited by the diffusion of the head group .",
    "this observation led them to examine a diffusion in a sphere model where the size of the sphere depends on the position of the chain .",
    "however , the authors describe this model as `` not particularly accurate '' , and the model was extended to include a distribution of spheres at each tail position .",
    "the dynamics of the atoms in lipid molecules are more complex than those in ordinary liquids .",
    "in a simple liquid @xcite atoms move ballistically at short times .",
    "thus the mean square displacement ( msd ) @xmath9 ^ 2 \\rangle \\approx \\langle ( v t)^2 \\rangle \\sim t^2 $ ] , which is followed by a crossover to fickian diffusion , characterized by @xmath9 ^ 2",
    "\\rangle \\sim t$ ] for long times . in dense fluids",
    "a caging effect , where the atoms are trapped by their neighbors , is observed between the ballistic and diffusive regimes , leading to a plateau in @xmath9 ^ 2 \\rangle$ ] . in a lipid bilayer ,",
    "the motion of lipid atoms is further complicated by the polymeric structure , characterized by connectivity and flexibility , of the lipids .",
    "a more realistic description of the diffusion of lipids should be based on theoretical models designed for polymers .",
    "two such theories are the rouse model @xcite and the mode - coupling theory @xcite . in the rouse model over - damped brownian motion",
    "is assumed for the individual monomers with a harmonic potential connecting adjacent monomers .",
    "the motion is subdiffusive with @xmath10 ^ 2 \\rangle \\sim t^{1/2}$ ] then there is a crossover to diffusive motion @xmath9 ^ 2 \\rangle \\sim t^{1}$ ] at later times .",
    "the mode - coupling theory ( mct ) , generally used to study the dynamics of glass - forming liquids , has recently been extended for flexible macromolecules and polymers @xcite , though it has not been applied to study lipid bilayers to our knowledge .",
    "the mct is a method used to approximately calculate space - time correlation functions ( e.g. , intermediate scattering function ) by solving a set of integro - differential equations obtained from first principles .",
    "an important feature of the extended polymer version of the mode coupling theory is the prediction of a sub - diffusive region between the short time ballistic and the long time fickian diffusion regimes . specifically , the theory predicts @xmath9 ^ 2 \\rangle \\sim t^{\\beta}$ ] , with @xmath11 typically between 0.5 and 0.65 . besides other parameters ,",
    "the exponent @xmath11 depends on the length of the polymer chain and approaches 0.5 , the rouse limit , for an infinite chain of identical monomers@xcite . since the only input to the theory is the static structure , the subdiffusion predicted by the extended mct is due to the polymeric structure and not to the specifics of the interactions .",
    "thus , one expects that the dynamics of the atoms in a lipid bilayer should exhibit a pronounced sub - diffusive regime before it crosses over to normal fickian diffusion .",
    "we argue that the extended sub - diffusive region in the msd is the cause of the difference between the experimentally measured diffusion coefficients @xmath7 and @xmath8 .    in this paper , we report an extensive computational investigation of the complex dynamics of both individual lipid atoms and entire lipid molecules in the fluid phase of a hydrated dmpc bilayer by employing a microscopic description of the system .",
    "our study is based on a @xmath12s long all atom molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation of the dmpc bilayer . by calculating the time evolution of the mean square displacement of lipid atoms in the plane of the bilayer for a time interval ranging from @xmath13s to @xmath14s ,",
    "we identify the short time ( @xmath15  ps ) ballistic region , the long time ( @xmath16  ns ) fickian diffusion region , and in between an extended _ subdiffusive _ region characterized by a power law @xmath17 ^ 2 \\rangle \\sim t^{\\beta}$ ] , with @xmath3 .",
    "we find that @xmath11 depends on the atom type and , most importantly , on its position within the lipid molecule .",
    "the dynamics is different for atoms in the lipid tail versus atoms in the head group .",

    "the md simulation was performed with namd-2.6 @xcite using the charmm27 @xcite force field .",
    "the equations of motion were integrated with a multiple time step algorithm with time steps of 1  fs for bonding interaction , 2  fs for non - bonding interactions , and 4  fs for long - range electrostatic interactions .",

    "long - range electrostatic interactions were computed by employing the smooth particle mesh ewald method @xcite with a grid spacing of 1   .",
    "the system was brought to @xmath19  k and normal pressure ( @xmath20  atm ) through several stages of equilibration .",
    "first , the system was subjected to @xmath21 energy minimization steps by harmonically restraining the phosphorous ( p ) atoms of the lipid headgroups along the normal direction to the surface of the membrane .",
    "next , the system was gradually heated to the desired temperature @xmath19  k during a 0.5  ns period . after removing all the restraints ,",
    "the system was equilibrated through a 75  ns long npt simulation . at the end of this process",
    "the area per lipid ( apl ) was 56.2  @xmath22 . to increase the apl to the desired value of @xmath23  @xmath22 , we performed nvt simulations and gradually increased the size of the system in the @xmath24-plane of the membrane .",
    "the final system size was @xmath25  @xmath26 , with an apl of @xmath27  @xmath22 .",
    "the equilibration process was concluded with an additional 10  ns nvt simulation .",
    "a production run of @xmath0s was performed in the nvt ensemble .",
    "we employed a langevin thermostat with a coupling constant of 0.05  ps@xmath28 .",
    "the coordinates of all the atoms were stored every 2  fs for the first 100  ps , then saved every 20  fs for the next 10  ns , then every 100  fs for the next 90 ns . this allowed us to study the short , intermediate , and long time dynamics of the individual atoms and lipids . a snapshot of the lipid bilayer system is shown in fig .",

    "the md simulations were carried out on 40 cpus of a dual core 2.8ghz intel xeon em64 t cluster with a performance of around 0.2 days / ns .",
    "in this section we examine the time dependence of the lateral mean square displacement ( msd ) of selected atoms within a lipid , and of entire lipids within the bilayer .",
    "we compare the results with the general predictions of the extended mct for polymers @xcite , and we propose a memory function method capable of describing the time dependence of msd in lipid bilayers .",
    "we begin by outlining some of the qualitative predictions of the extended mct for polymers . to derive the extended mode coupling equations ,",

    "this leads to a set of coupled integro - differential equations for monomer density fluctuations .",
    "the mct is a set of approximations of the memory kernel that permits the corresponding integro - differential equations to be numerically solved with the only input being the static structure .",

    "after the ballistic regime , the growth of the mean square displacement is suppressed due to a local caging effect caused by the trapping of the polymer by its neighbors . at larger times",

    "the ballistic , the sub - diffusive , and the diffusive time scales are identifiable for all the atoms .",
    "the msd in the ballistic regime is the same for ch and ct since they have the same mass and are at the same temperature , but their mean square displacements differ starting in the caging region .",
    "the msd for ct is larger than that of ch , which indicates that the size of the cage is larger for atoms at the end of the tail than atoms close to the head group .",

    "the value of @xmath42 depends on the atom type and ranged from @xmath50 for the cm to @xmath51 for ct , the carbon atom at the end of the tail .",
    "the dynamics in the ps time scale strongly depends on the position of the atom within the lipid .",
    "the atoms at the end of the lipid tails have more freedom to move , and hence a larger cage . however , these atoms are connected to those within the head group , which ultimately determine their diffusion on long time scales .    for @xmath16  ns ,",

    "this difference may be due to a combination of several factors , e.g. , imperfection of the empirical charmm27 force field used in the md simulations , discrepancy between the apl of the experimental and the simulated systems , finite size of the dmpc bilayer system and insufficient sampling .",

    "in spite of extensive literature dealing with the experimental and computational study of the dynamics of lipid bilayers , the determination of the lateral self - diffusion coefficient @xmath33 of lipid molecules in the membrane remains a controversial problem .",
    "the results for @xmath33 appear to depend significantly on the time and length scales probed by the employed measurement or computational method .",
    "this observation prompted researchers to propose different models that have been predominantly influenced by models of diffusion in dense fluids .",
    "however , lipid molecules are polymers , characterized by flexibility and connectivity , and their lateral diffusion in the leaflets of lipid bilayers is qualitatively different from the diffusion of molecules in dense fluids .",
    "this difference is reflected in the time dependence of the msd .",
    "we observe a broad sub - diffusive region , not present in simple fluids , between the short time ballistic region and the long time fickian diffusion region .",
    "here we developed a phenomenological memory function approach , which can be used to describe the behavior of the msd of lipid atoms and molecules over the whole time interval spanning from the ballistic regime ( t @xmath63 ) to the fickian diffusion regime ( t @xmath64 ) . by fitting the mean square displacement , we were able to identify three clearly separated time scales that correspond to three different dynamic regimes in the lipid system .",
    "overall , our memory function fits to the msd matched remarkably well @xmath1 ^ 2\\rangle$ ] from the md simulation .",
    "however , some features in the fairly broad crossover region between the ballistic and sub - diffusive regimes are missed by our approximation .",
    "our memory function approach allows us to calculate the lateral self - diffusion coefficient @xmath33 of lipid atoms and molecules through eq .  , and shows that , while the dynamics of the different atoms are very different at ps time scales , the motion at @xmath65 is best described by simple diffusion .",
    "we also investigated the consequence of the sub - diffusive behavior of the msd by examining the first two terms in the cumulant expansion of the sisf .",
    "the first term is referred to as the gaussian approximation and is exact if the probability distribution @xmath66 of the displacements is gaussian . by calculating the first non - gaussian correction , characterized by the parameter @xmath67 ( eq .  [ nongauss ] ) , we found that @xmath66 is nearly gaussian outside the sub - diffusive region . while for the p atoms and the center of mass of individual lipid molecules @xmath66 remained nearly gaussian even in the sub - diffusive region , @xmath66 for the carbon and hydrogen atoms showed significant deviation from gaussian in this region .",
    "interestingly , a gaussian distribution for the center of mass , whose width did not increase as the square root of time , for lipid displacements has been observed in previous simulations @xcite .",
    "when @xmath66 is gaussian , the sisf ( e.g. , measured in inelastic neutron scattering ( ins ) experiments of protonated lipid membrane samples ) can be expressed in terms of the msd , eq .  .",
    "the sub - diffusive dynamics strongly influences the scattering from the lipids whenever the probing scattering vector , @xmath29 , and frequency , @xmath68 , correspond to lengths and times in the sub - diffusive regime of the lipid atoms and molecules . in this case",
    "the sisf can be fairly well fitted with a stretched exponential ( kww ) function , @xmath69^{\\beta(q)}]$ ] .",
    "note , however , that for a given @xmath29 the stretched exponential will not be able to reproduce the short ( ballistic ) and long ( fickian diffusion ) time regimes .",
    "we examined the @xmath29 dependence of @xmath70 and @xmath71 . for the phosphorus atoms we find that @xmath72 for @xmath73 , which agrees with the exponent determined from the msd .",
    "we emphasize that in most ins experiments on lipid bilayers primarily one explores the sub - diffusive region and not the long time fickian diffusion region , thus making the use of eq .",
    "therefore , it should come as no surprise that the values of the lipid lateral self - diffusion coefficient extracted from ins experiments using eq .",
    "have a strong @xmath29 dependence and generally overestimate the real @xmath33 obtained by other ( e.g. , frap ) experiments .",
    "furthermore , it would be interesting to investigate the temperature dependence of the analysis presented in this paper . in some liquids",
    ", it has been observed that activated events become more pronounced as the temperature is lowered .",
    "it would be reasonable to expect a similar behavior in lipid membranes , thus the diffusion could change character at lower temperatures and in the gel phase .",
    "it is also unknown how the picture presented in this work would change in the gel phase of the lipid membrane .",
    "since the tails of the lipids are aligned , do the lipids behave as if they are more rigid ? this may change the sub - diffusive region dramatically .",
    "the addition of cholesterol or proteins to the lipids may also change the nature of the sub - diffusive region and dramatically change the dynamics of the lipids .",
