    "since the discovery of high - temperature superconductivity in the layered cuprates in 1986 [ bednorz and mller 1986 ] , it has been established that the superconducting order parameter has the @xmath0-wave symmetry in a number of these materials [ schrieffer 1994 , scalapino 1995 , van harlingen 1995 , tsuei and kirtley 2000 ] .",
    "this is important , because the @xmath0-wave symmetry of the order parameter suggests the possibility of an electronically mediated pairing mechanism .",
    "perhaps , the simplest model used for modelling the low - energy electronic correlations of the layered cuprates is the two - dimensional ( 2d ) hubbard model . within this context ,",
    "the nature of the pairing correlations in the hubbard model as well as the nature of its low - lying electronic excitations has received considerable attention .    in 1987",
    "anderson suggested that the 2d hubbard model is relevant to the cuprates [ anderson 1987 ] .",
    "however , even today questions remain about this model . in this article , what has been learned about the physical properties of the 2d and the 2-leg hubbard models from the numerical studies will be reviewed .",
    "the emphasis will be placed on the @xmath0 pairing correlations seen in these models and their microscopic origin .",
    "the implications of these calculations for the @xmath0-wave pairing in the high-@xmath1 cuprates is of current interest . in particular , one is interested in knowing whether the @xmath0-wave superconducting order could exist in the ground state of the 2d hubbard model , and , if it does , whether it would have sufficient strength to explain the superconducting transition temperatures as high as those seen in the cuprates .",
    "there is also much interest in finding ways of enhancing the strength of the @xmath0-wave pairing correlations observed in the hubbard model . within the past ten to fifteen years",
    ", the determinantal quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) and the density - matrix renormalization - group ( dmrg ) techniques have been used to address these questions .",
    "these numerical studies are the subject of this review article .    for the 2d hubbard model ,",
    "the qmc data on the magnetic , charge and the single - particle excitations will be presented . in order to investigate the pairing correlations ,",
    "the qmc data on the irreducible particle - particle interaction and the solutions of the particle - particle bethe - salpeter equation will be shown . using the dmrg method ,",
    "the equal - time pair - field correlation function has been calculated in the ground state of the 2-leg hubbard ladder .",
    "these dmrg data along with the qmc results on the 2-leg ladder will be shown and compared with each other .",
    "in addition , these results will be compared with the numerical studies of the @xmath2-@xmath3 model .",
    "figure 1.1 shows a schematic drawing of the cuo@xmath7 plane of the cuprates consisting of the one - electron cu(@xmath8 ) and o(@xmath9 ) orbitals that give rise to the band in which the @xmath0-wave superconducting pairs form . in an electronic model of the cuo@xmath7 plane",
    ", there would be an onsite coulomb repulsion at the cu(@xmath8 ) and the o(@xmath9 ) orbitals and one - electron hopping matrix elements between the neighbouring cu - o and the o - o orbitals as well as longer - range hoppings and coulomb interactions .",
    "a simplified approach is to use the single - band hubbard model on the 2d square lattice which has an onsite coulomb repulsion and one - electron hopping matrix elements between the nearest - neighbour sites , as illustrated in fig .",
    "to some extent , this is motivated by the notion that the nonperturbative effects due to the onsite coulomb repulsion will dominate at low temperatures and low energies .",
    "extensive numerical calculations have been carried out for studying the properties of the one - band 2d hubbard model .",
    "another model which has proven useful for studying @xmath0-wave pairing is the 2-leg hubbard ladder illustrated in fig .",
    "this model has an onsite coulomb repulsion @xmath10 and the intrachain and interchain hopping matrix elements @xmath2 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "the 2-leg hubbard ladder is an important model where the pairing correlations can be studied in detail in the ground state for systems with up to 32 rungs . here",
    ", the numerical results on the 2d and the 2-leg hubbard models will be used to discuss the nature of the @xmath0-wave pairing found in the cuo@xmath7 layers of the high-@xmath1 cuprates .",
    "the hubbard model was introduced for describing the coulomb correlation effects in the @xmath12-bands of the transition metals , which show both band - like and atomic - like behaviour [ hubbard 1963 ] .",
    "the hubbard hamiltonian has a one - body kinetic term and an interaction term which represents the onsite coulomb repulsion when two electrons occupy the same orbital . in spite of studies covering four decades",
    ", questions remain about the hubbard model . in two dimensions , the hubbard hamiltonian with only nearest - neighbor hopping",
    "is given by @xmath13 where the sum over @xmath14 and @xmath15 is done over the nearest - neighbour sites on a square lattice .",
    "the one - electron hopping matrix element is @xmath2 , the onsite coulomb repulsion is @xmath10 and the chemical potential @xmath16 is used for controlling the electron occupation in the grand canonical ensemble . here , @xmath17",
    "( @xmath18 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron of spin @xmath19 at site @xmath14 and @xmath20 is the occupation number of electrons with spin @xmath19 at site @xmath14 .",
    "in addition to the 2d hubbard model , the numerical results on the 2-leg hubbard ladder with anisotropic hopping will be reviewed . in this case",
    ", the hamiltonian is @xmath21 where @xmath2 is the hopping matrix element parallel to the chains and @xmath11 is the inter - chain hopping , as illustrated in fig .",
    "the operators @xmath22 create an electron of spin @xmath19 at site @xmath14 of the @xmath23th leg , and @xmath24 is the electron number operator with spin @xmath19 at site @xmath25 .",
    "the qmc and the dmrg are powerful numerical methods , which have been developed for studying strongly - correlated systems such as the hubbard model .",
    "these techniques allow for the possibility to determine whether superconductivity exists in the ground state of an interacting system without first having to construct an approximate theoretical framework for describing its elementary excitations .",

    ", it is useful to first discuss the magnetic , density and the single - particle excitations .",
    "the review of the numerical studies on the 2d hubbard model will begin in section 3 by presenting qmc data on the magnetic properties . here",
    ", qmc results on the magnetic susceptibility will be shown at and near half - filling .",
    "in addition , an rpa - like model for the magnetic susceptibility will be introduced , and the effective particle - hole vertex will be discussed . the nmr experiments which support the existence of short - range af fluctuations in the high-@xmath1 cuprates will also be reviewed briefly .    in section 4 ,",
    "the qmc results on the charge susceptibility will be shown and its dependence on the strength of the coulomb repulsion will be discussed . here ,",
    "the possibility of any `` @xmath26 '' charge - density - wave ( cdw ) fluctuations in the 2d hubbard model will be investigated . in this section , numerical results on the optical conductivity will also be discussed .",
    "the nature of the single - particle excitations in the 2d hubbard model has received much attention within the context of the cuprates . in section 5 , the single - particle density of states @xmath27 and spectral weight @xmath28 obtained from the maximum - entropy analytic continuation of the qmc data on the single - particle green s function will be reviewed . at half - filling ,",
    "these calculations find a mott - hubbard gap , lower and upper hubbard bands and quasiparticle bands .",
    "these quasiparticle bands are similar to those found in a spin - density - wave ( sdw ) insulator .",
    "it will be seen that , upon doping , a redistribution of the spectral weight takes place forming a narrow metallic band at the fermi level .",
    "this band has unusually flat dispersion near the @xmath5 and @xmath6 points of the brillouin zone leading to large amount of single - particle spectral weight available for scatterings in the particle - particle channel .",
    "these results on @xmath28 will also be compared with the results of the angular - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) measurements on the cuprates .    after reviewing the numerical results on the magnetic , density and the single - particle properties , in section 6 the @xmath0-wave pairing correlations in the 2d hubbard model",
    "will be discussed .",
    "the qmc simulations have found that when doped away from half - filling there are short - range @xmath0-wave pairing correlations in the 2d hubbard model , but no long - range superconducting order has been observed in the parameter regime where the simulations are carried out .",
    "the irreducible particle - particle interaction @xmath29 has been also calculated with the qmc simulations and it gives information on the microscopic many - body processes causing the attraction in the @xmath0-wave pairing channel . in section 6 , these qmc results will be reviewed .",
    "it will be seen that @xmath29 is repulsive at @xmath30 momentum transfers and that it is the short - range af correlations which are responsible for this behavior .",
    "comparisons with the various diagrammatic approaches will also be carried out , which indicate that in the intermediate - coupling regime the momentum and the matsubara - frequency structure in @xmath29 can be described by a properly - renormalized single spin - fluctuation exchange interaction . using the qmc data on @xmath29 and the single - particle green s functions , the bethe - salpeter equation in the particle - particle channel has been solved .",
    "these calculations allow for a comparison of the strength of the pairing correlations in the various channels . here",
    ", it will be seen that as the temperature is lowered , the fastest growing pairing correlations occur in the singlet @xmath0-wave channel .    while these calculations are not carried out at sufficiently low temperatures to determine whether the @xmath0-wave long - range superconducting order exists in the ground state of the doped 2d hubbard model , the results on @xmath29 are useful in the following sense .",
    "consider a phonon - mediated superconductor such as pb , where the effective interaction mediating the pairing forms already at temperatures of order the characteristic phonon frequency @xmath31 .",
    "hence , in this case , at @xmath32 it would be possible to study the effective particle - particle interaction responsible for superconductivity , even though the superconducting long - range order takes place at much lower temperatures .",
    "similarly , the qmc simulations are carried out at temperatures of order or less than the characteristic energy scale @xmath33 of the af correlations .",
    "hence , it is possible to probe @xmath29 in the temperature regime where short - range af correlations have formed , and see what type of many - body processes are important in mediating the pairing and which pairing channels are favored .",

    "the comparisons of the dmrg and the qmc results show that it is the strong short - range af fluctuations which mediate the @xmath0-wave pairing correlations in this system .",
    "furthermore , in this case , it is possible to study the dependence of the strength of the superconducting correlations on the model parameters such as @xmath34 and @xmath35 .",
    "it will be seen that the superconducting correlations are strongest in the intermediate - coupling regime and when @xmath34 is such that there is large amount of single - particle spectral weight pinned near the @xmath5 and @xmath6 points of the brillouin zone .",
    "in addition , the qmc calculations find that @xmath29 peaks at @xmath4 momentum transfer .",
    "these features of @xmath28 and @xmath29 create optimum conditions for @xmath0-wave superconducting correlations . in section 7.3 , these numerical results on the 2d and the 2-leg hubbard models will be compared with each other .",
    "this comparison suggests that the @xmath0-wave pairing correlations seen in these models do not require a particularly sharp peak in @xmath29 but rather simply weight at momentum transfers near @xmath4 .    in section 8",
    ", the qmc and the dmrg results reviewed above will be compared with the diagrammatic and the other numerical approaches to the hubbard model as well as with the numerical results on the @xmath2-@xmath3 model .",
    "first , in section 8.1 , the qmc results on the 2d hubbard model will be compared with the results of the fluctuation exchange ( flex ) approach . here , the purpose will be to make simple estimates for the maximum @xmath1 possible in the 2d hubbard model , if a superconducting phase were to occur .",
    "in particular , the effects of the system being near an af mott - hubbard insulator on the strength of the @xmath0-wave pairing will be explored . in section  8.2",
    ", the results from the variational and the projector monte carlo studies of the hubbard model will be reviewed briefly .",
    "recently , the dynamical cluster approximation ( dca ) and the one - loop renormalization - group ( rg ) technique employing a 2d fermi surface were applied to study @xmath0 pairing in the 2d hubbard model .",
    "the results of these calculations will be discussed in section  8.3 .",

    "since the development of the bcs theory , it has been of interest to see whether the effective interaction which is responsible for pairing could be mediated by excitations other than phonons .",
    "the superfluidity of @xmath36he is an example where it is believed that the pairing is due to the exchange of ferromagnetic spin fluctuations resulting in triplet @xmath37-wave superconductivity [ leggett 1975 ] . within the context of organic superconductors ,",
    "the possibility of the pairing being mediated by spin fluctuations had been noted in ref .",
    "[ emery 1986 ] . for the heavy fermion materials , the possibility of @xmath12-wave superconductivity due to the exchange of af spin fluctuations",

    ", a discussion of these ideas on how the exchange of the af spin - fluctuations leads to a @xmath0-wave gap function will be given , since this picture will be useful for the remainder of the article .",
    "in the paramagnetic phase of the 2d hubbard model and within rpa , the single spin - fluctuation exchange interaction between opposite - spin particles at zero frequency transfer is given by [ berk and schrieffer 1966 , doniach and engelsberg 1966 ] @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the usual lindhard function .",
    "the longitudinal and the transverse spin fluctuations contributing to @xmath40 are illustrated in fig .",

    "near half - filling and for a tight - binding band structure @xmath44 , where @xmath16 is the chemical potential , the lindhard function peaks at @xmath45 .",
    "consequently , for a system with stoner - enhanced af correlations , the spin - fluctuation exchange interaction @xmath46 is large and repulsive at @xmath47 momentum transfers .",
    "now , consider the bcs gap equation @xmath48 where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are restricted to being on the fermi surface of the doped system as illustrated in fig .  2.2 .",
    "when this equation is solved , it is found that the leading superconducting instability occurs for a gap function with the @xmath0-wave symmetry , @xmath51 in order to see why the @xmath0-wave form is a solution , consider a quasiparticle pair occupying @xmath42 with @xmath49 near @xmath5 , as shown in fig .",
    "this pair can scatter to @xmath43 where @xmath52 through the interaction @xmath41 , which is enhanced and positive for momentum transfers near @xmath4 , because @xmath53 changes sign between @xmath49 and @xmath50 .",
    "this is basically the reason for why the @xmath0-wave gap symmetry is favored by the af spin fluctuations .",
    "since @xmath41 is always positive , there is no singlet solution with the usual @xmath54-wave symmetry . for simplicity ,",
    "these arguments were given at zero frequency , where @xmath49 and @xmath50 are restricted to being on the fermi surface , but the same arguments hold when the frequency dependencies of the gap equation and of the effective interaction are taken into account . in section  6 , the qmc data on the irreducible particle - particle interaction @xmath29 and the solutions of the bethe - salpeter equation will be reviewed for the 2d hubbard model .",
    "there , it will be seen that @xmath29 is similar to the single spin - fluctuation exchange interaction and the leading singlet pairing instability occurs in the @xmath0-wave channel in the parameter regime where the qmc simulations are carried out .",
    "early experimental evidence for @xmath0-wave pairing in the cuprates arose from the measurement of the nmr longitudinal nuclear relaxation rate @xmath55 for cu(2 ) and o(2,3 ) nuclei in yba@xmath7cu@xmath56o@xmath57 .",

    "these calculations represent the first example where a purely repulsive onsite interaction leads to superconducting correlations which are enhanced over the noninteracting ( @xmath152 ) case in the ground state of a bulk system . for certain values of @xmath34 and in the intermediate coupling regime ,",
    "this model exhibits enhanced power - law @xmath0-like superconducting correlations .",
    "the qmc simulations for this system show that the effective particle - particle interaction @xmath29 peaks at @xmath4 momentum transfer and , in addition , the @xmath0 pairing correlations are strongest when there is significant amount of single - particle spectral weight near the fermi level at the @xmath5 and @xmath6 points in the brillouin zone . this way the system makes optimum use of the momentum structure in @xmath29 for @xmath0-wave pairing .",
    "these data were also compared with various other approaches to the hubbard model , such as the diagrammatic flex approximation , the variational and the projector monte carlo simulations , the dynamical cluster approximation and the one - loop rg calculations . in addition , the similarities and the differences with the @xmath2-@xmath3 model were briefly discussed .",
    "the implications for the @xmath0-wave superconductivity seen in the cuprates were also noted .",
    "it is difficult to reach conclusions about the strongly correlated systems .",
    "nevertheless , here , the following conclusions are given :    \\(1 ) an onsite coulomb repulsion can lead to superconducting correlations which are enhanced with respect to the noninteracting ( @xmath152 ) case in the ground state of a bulk system .",
    "this is proven for the case of the 2-leg hubbard ladder .",
    "\\(2 ) the 2d hubbard model exhibits @xmath0-wave pairing correlations which grow as the temperature is lowered in the parameter regime where the qmc simulations are carried out .",
    "the fastest growing pairing correlations occur in the singlet @xmath0-wave channel .",
    "these correlations are not weak .",
    "\\(3 ) the qmc simulations also find that the effective pairing interaction in the 2d and the 2-leg hubbard models in the intermediate coupling regime and at temperatures greater or of order @xmath355 is consistent with the spin - fluctuation exchange approximation .",
    "\\(4 ) two factors which create optimum conditions for @xmath0 pairing in the hubbard model are enhanced single - particle spectral weight at the fermi level near the @xmath5 and @xmath6 points in the brillouin zone and large weight in the effective pairing interaction @xmath29 at large momentum transfers .",

    ", at each lattice site @xmath14 and for each time slice @xmath241 , an ising spin @xmath523 is used for the decoupling .",
    "this form of the hubbard - stratonovich decoupling was introduced by hirsch [ hirsch 1985 ] . after integrating out the fermion degrees of freedom ,",
    "the partition function is given by @xmath524 where @xmath525 and @xmath526 with electron spin @xmath527 . here",

    "the hubbard - stratonovich transformation maps the interacting fermion problem on the 2d lattice to that of non - interacting fermions in a random ising field on a 3d lattice , the third dimension being the imaginary time axis @xmath544 . at this stage , for a given spin configuration @xmath528 , the wick s theorem applies to the higher order correlation functions .",
    "hence , the higher - order correlation functions can be obtained by averaging over the products of the single - particle propagators in random ising fields .",
    "for instance , the two - particle correlation function @xmath545 which is used in extracting the particle - particle reducible interaction @xmath243 in section 6 , can be obtained from @xmath546    for @xmath221 , the product of the fermion determinants , @xmath547 , is positive . however , away from half - filling and for @xmath548 , this product is not positive for all configurations @xmath528 . in this case , one can use the probability distribution @xmath549 in order to calculate the expectation value @xmath550 with @xmath551 here , @xmath552 is the sign of @xmath553 and the average @xmath554 is calculated with the probability distribution @xmath555 .",

    "it has been shown that away from half - filling @xmath357 decreases exponentially as @xmath72 decreases [ loh _ et al .",
    "this causes large statistical errors in @xmath550 and it is the cause of the sign problem .",
    "the temperature and the doping regime of the 2d hubbard model which can not be studied with qmc because of the sign problem is shown at the end of section 6 . in spite of the sign problem ,",
    "useful information has been extracted from the 2d and the 2-leg hubbard models with qmc simulations .",
    "currently , the search for ways of removing the sign problem is an important field of study .",
    "improvements in the sign problem which decreases the temperatures accessible to qmc simulations by even a factor of two would be valuable .",
    "the dmrg technique which was invented by white represents a significant development in the application of the renormalization group ideas to interacting lattice models [ white 1992 and 1993 ] .",
    "currently , it is the numerical method of choice for studying the ground state properties of quasi-1d interacting systems .",
    "the brief discussion of this technique given here follows closely that of ref .  [",
    "white 1993 ] . for simplicity",
    ", the following discussion will be for a 1d lattice .",
    "one of the differences between the dmrg and the standard real - space rg approach is in the treatment of the boundary conditions in the basic blocking procedure . in the standard approach for a finite 1d system",
    ", the chain is broken into finite blocks @xmath557 of @xmath241 sites . here , first the hamiltonian for two identical blocks is diagonalized and then the lowest eigenstates are kept to form a new approximate hamiltonian describing a larger block @xmath558 with @xmath559 sites .",
    "this procedure is illustrated in fig .",
    "white and noack have shown that this was of blocking introduces large errors for a model of a free particle on a 1d lattice because of the way the boundary conditions are treated during the blocking [ white and noack 1992 ] . in the standard rg scheme , neglecting the connection of the two blocks to the neighboring blocks corresponds to setting the wave function of the particle to 0 outside of the blocks .",
    "consequently , the low lying states from the previous iteration cause a  kink  in the wave function in the middle of the enlarged block @xmath558 .",
    "hence , in order to accurately represent the states of block @xmath558 , it is necessary to use almost all of the states of block @xmath557 , and any truncation of these states introduces large errors in the rg process .",
    "white and noack have noted that using a combination of boundary conditions during the blocking fixes this deficiency for a free particle on a 1d lattice .",
    "they have also shown that an alternative approach is to use a superblock which is composed of more than two blocks . in this way ,",
    "two of the blocks in the superblock are used to form a larger block for the next iteration while the effect of the other blocks is to apply a variety of boundary conditions .",
    "the dmrg technique uses a superblock during the rg iteration , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "10.1(b ) for a 1d lattice of @xmath518 sites .",
    "this superblock is composed of two blocks with @xmath241 and @xmath560 sites and two additional sites in the middle , which can be considered as additional blocks .",
    "the block @xmath557 and its neighboring lattice site are called the ` system ' , while the rest of the superblock is called the ` environment ' . with each iteration , the system block gets enlarged by one lattice site .",
    "another novel feature of the dmrg technique is the use of the density matrices to choose the states which are to be kept during the iteration [ white 1992 and 1993 ] . in the standard rg approach , the lowest @xmath561 eigenstates of the hamiltonian for two blocks",
    "is used in forming the truncated hamiltonian for the larger block , as illustrated in fig .",
    "this would be a reasonable approximation for a model where the coupling between the blocks is weak .",
    "however , for an interacting system such as the hubbard model , each block is strongly coupled to its environment . in this case",
    ", white has shown that it is better to use during the truncation the eigenstates of the density matrix of the system , and , in fact , the optimal states to be kept are the eigenvectors of the density matrix of the system with the largest eigenvalues .",
    "the use of the superblock and the density matrix formulation are the important new ideas used by the dmrg technique .    at this point ,",
    "the dmrg algorithm for a finite 1d lattice can be summarized as follows : ( 1 ) the first step is to diagonalize the hamiltonian for the superblock , which is illustrated in fig .",
    "10.1(b ) , using exact diagonalization techniques in order to find the ground state @xmath562 . here",
    ", the index @xmath14 refers to the system part of the lattice and @xmath15 refers to the environment .",
    "( 2 ) next , the reduced density matrix for block @xmath563 is calculated by tracing over the environment , @xmath564 and then @xmath565 is diagonalized .",
    "( 3 ) at this stage , the hamiltonian for @xmath563 can be transformed to a reduced basis which consists of the @xmath561 leading eigenstates of @xmath565 .",
    "typically a few hundred eigenstates of @xmath565 are kept .",
    "( 4 ) in the next iteration , this approximate hamiltonian for @xmath563 is used in place of the hamiltonian for @xmath557 .    with this procedure ,",
    "the system block is built up by adding one lattice site at a time as the iteration continues form one end of the lattice to the other end . with each sweep through the lattice ,",
    "a better approximation is obtained for the hamiltonian of the block @xmath557 .",
    "in addition , during the sweeps , the hamiltonians of the system blocks from the previous sweep are used as the hamiltonians for the environment blocks . for 1d lattices ,",
    "reflections of @xmath557 can be used in place of @xmath566 in order to build up the superblock to the proper size during the first sweep . in order to extend this algorithm to 2d",
    ", a row of neighboring sites can be added to the system block at each iteration , or a single site can be added using a connected 1d path through the 2d lattice . for higher dimensional lattices ,",
    "an empty environment block @xmath566 is used in the first sweep .",
    "the dmrg technique is more accurate when the number of connections between the system and the environment blocks is minimized .",
    "hence , usually open boundary conditions are employed .",
    "when periodic boundary conditions are used , the accuracy decreases . for 2d lattices ,",
    "the accuracy of dmrg also decreases as a function of the width of the lattice .",
    "however , if a larger number of the eigenstates of @xmath565 are kept during the truncation , the accuracy of the algorithm increases . finally , the dmrg is most accurate for large @xmath10 and least accurate for @xmath152 .    with this technique , various equal - time correlation functions for the 2-leg hubbard ladder",
    "have been calculated on lattices up to @xmath373 in size [ noack _ et al .",
    "_ 1996 ] . for the 3-leg hubbard ladder",

    ", larger systems can be studied with this technique . in this case , 2d clusters up to @xmath568 in size have been studied using cylindrical boundary conditions [ white and scalapino 1998a ] .",
    "currently , the dmrg technique is used in a wide variety of fields , and the efforts to develop new algorithms to study larger clusters continues .",
    "in addition , there is continuing work to extend the dmrg technique in order to calculate the dynamical correlation functions .",
