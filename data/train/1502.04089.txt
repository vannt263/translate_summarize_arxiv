    "the famous painlev transcendents are six nonlinear second - order differential equations whose key features are that their movable ( spontaneous ) singularities are poles ( and not , for example , branch points or essential singularities ) .",
    "there is a vast literature on these remarkable differential equations @xcite .",
    "these equations have arisen many times in mathematical physics ; for a small sample , see refs .",
    "this paper considers the first and second painlev transcendents , referred to here as p - i and p - ii .",
    "the initial - value problem ( ivp ) for the p - i differential equation is @xmath18 ^ 2+t,\\qquad y(0)=c,~y'(0)=b \\label{e1}\\ ] ] and the ivp for p - ii ( we have set an arbitrary additive constant to 0 ) is @xmath19 ^ 3+ty(t),\\qquad y(0)=c,~y'(0)=b . \\label{e2}\\ ] ]    many asymptotic studies of the painlev transcendents have been published , but in this paper we present a simple numerical and asymptotic analysis that to our knowledge has not appeared in the literature .",
    "this analysis concerns the initial conditions that give rise to special unstable separatrix solutions of p - i and p - ii .",
    "our asymptotic analysis verifies the numerical results given in this paper for p - i and p - ii as well as some preliminary numerical calculations that were presented in an earlier paper on nonlinear differential - equation eigenvalue problems @xcite .",
    "the main idea , originally introduced in ref .",
    "@xcite , is that a nonlinear differential equation may have a discrete set of _ critical _ initial conditions that give rise to unstable separatrix solutions .",
    "these discrete initial conditions can be thought of as eigenvalues and the separatrices that stem from these initial conditions can be viewed as the corresponding eigenfunctions .",
    "the objective in ref .",
    "@xcite was to find the large-@xmath4 ( semiclassical ) asymptotic behavior of the @xmath4th eigenvalue .",
    "the general analytical approach that was proposed was to simplify the nonlinear differential problem to a linear problem that could be used to determine the leading asymptotic behavior of the eigenvalues as @xmath20 .",
    "a toy model was used in ref .",
    "@xcite to explain the concept of a nonlinear eigenvalue problem .",
    "this model makes use of the elementary first - order differential equation problem @xmath21,\\quad y(0)=a . \\label{e3}\\ ] ] it was shown that the solutions to this initial - value problem pass through @xmath4 maxima before vanishing like @xmath22 as @xmath23 . as the initial condition @xmath24 increases past special critical values @xmath25 , the number of maxima jumps from @xmath4 to @xmath26 . at these critical values",
    "the solution @xmath27 to ( [ e3 ] ) is an unstable separatrix curve in the following sense : at values of @xmath28 infinitesimally below @xmath25 the solution merges with a bundle of stable solutions all having @xmath4 maxima and when @xmath28 is infinitesimally above @xmath25 the solution merges with a bundle of stable solutions all having @xmath26 maxima .",
    "the challenge is to determine the asymptotic behavior of the critical values @xmath25 for large @xmath4 .",
    "( this generic problem is the analog of a semiclassical high - energy approximation in quantum mechanics . ) to solve this problem it was shown that for large @xmath4 , the nonlinear differential equation problem ( [ e3 ] ) reduces to a _ linear _ one - dimensional random - walk problem .",
    "the random - walk problem was solved exactly , and it was shown analytically that @xmath29 kerr subsequently found an alternative solution to this asymptotics problem and verified ( [ e4 ] ) @xcite .",
    "the nonlinear eigenvalue problem described above is similar in many respects to the linear eigenvalue problem for the time - independent schrdinger equation . for a potential @xmath30 that rises as @xmath31 , the eigenfunctions @xmath32 of the schrdinger eigenvalue problem @xmath33 are unstable with respect to small changes in the eigenvalue @xmath34 ; that is , if @xmath34 is increased or decreased slightly , @xmath35 abruptly ceases to obey the boundary conditions [ and thus is not normalizable ( square integrable ) ] .",
    "furthermore , like the eigenfunctions ( separatrix curves ) of ( [ e3 ] ) , the eigenfunction @xmath36 corresponding to the @xmath4th eigenvalue has @xmath4 oscillations in the classically allowed region before decreasing monotonically to @xmath37 in the classically forbidden region .",
    "this paper considers four eigenvalue problems .",
    "first , for p - i we find the large-@xmath4 behavior of the positive eigenvalues @xmath5 for the initial condition @xmath38 and also the large-@xmath4 behavior of the negative eigenvalues @xmath7 for the initial condition @xmath39 .",
    "we show that @xmath40 second , for p - ii we show that for large @xmath4 the asymptotic behaviors of @xmath5 and @xmath7 are given by @xmath41 we determine the constants @xmath11 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath42 both numerically and analytically .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .  [ s2 ] we obtain the constants @xmath11 and @xmath12 by using numerical techniques and in sec .",
    "[ s3 ] we do so analytically by reducing the large - eigenvalue problem to the _ linear _ time - independent schrdinger equation for the cubic @xmath15-symmetric hamiltonian @xmath43 .",

    "[ s6 ] we make some brief concluding remarks .",
    "in ref .  @xcite there is a brief numerical study of the initial - value problem for the first painlev transcendent ( [ e1 ] ) .",
    "it is easy to see that there are two possible asymptotic behaviors as @xmath45 ; the solutions to the p - i equation can approach either @xmath46 or @xmath47 .",
    "an elementary asymptotic analysis shows that if the solution @xmath27 approaches @xmath47 , the solution oscillates stably about this curve with slowly decreasing amplitude @xcite . however , while the curve @xmath46 is a possible asymptotic behavior , this behavior is _ unstable _ and nearby solutions tend to veer away from it .",
    "we define the eigenfunction solutions to the first painlev transcendent as those solutions that _ do _ approach @xmath46 as @xmath48 .",
    "these separatrix solutions resemble the eigenfunctions of conventional quantum mechanics in that they exhibit @xmath4 oscillations before settling down to this asymptotic behavior .",
    "however , because the p - i equation is nonlinear , these oscillations are violent ; the @xmath4th eigenfunction passes through @xmath49 $ ] double poles where it blows up before it smoothly approaches the curve @xmath46 .",
    "( the symbol @xmath49 $ ] means greatest integer in @xmath50 . )",
    "one can specify two different kinds of eigenvalue problems for p - i , each of which is fundamentally related to the instability of the asymptotic behavior @xmath46 .",
    "one can ( i ) fix the initial value @xmath28 and look for ( discrete ) values of the initial slopes @xmath51 that give rise to solutions approaching @xmath46 , or else ( ii ) one can fix the initial slope @xmath52 and look for the ( discrete ) initial values of @xmath53 that give rise to solutions approaching @xmath46 .",
    "let us examine the numerical solutions to the initial - value problem for the p - i equation ( [ e1 ] ) for @xmath54 . to find these solutions we use runge - kutta to integrate down the negative - real axis .",
    "when we approach a double pole and the solution becomes large and positive , we estimate the location of the pole and integrate along a semicircle in the complex-@xmath55 plane around the pole .",
    "we then continue integrating down the negative - real axis .",
    "we choose the fixed initial value @xmath0 and allow the initial slope @xmath51 to have increasingly positive values .",
    "( we only present results for positive initial slope ; the behavior for negative initial slope is analogous and describing it would be repetitive . )",
    "our numerical analysis shows that the particular choice of @xmath28 is not crucial ; for _ any _ fixed @xmath28 the large-@xmath4 asymptotic behavior of the initial - slope eigenvalues @xmath5 is the same .",
