    "the symbiotic binary v407 cyg consists of an accreting white dwarf and an o - rich mira companion pulsating with a 745 day period .",
    "miras with such a long pulsation period are generally oh / ir sources with a very thick dust envelope which prevents direct observation of the central star at optical wavelengths .",
    "the much thinner dust envelope in v407 cyg is probably due to the presence of the wd companion whose orbital motion , hard radiation field in quiescence and violent mass ejection during outbursts inhibits dust formation in a large fraction of the mira wind ( munari et al .",
    "1990 , hereafter m90 ) .",
    "v407 cyg was discovered by hoffmeister ( 1949 ) as nova cyg 1936 , just at the time when its mira was passing through maximum brightness .",
    "no spectroscopic observations confirming it as a genuine nova outburst were however available .",
    "what actually occured is unclear because ( i ) the object was discovered and remained at b@xmath114.5 mag for an entire mira pulsation cycle , without declining to an expected @xmath2@xmath319 minimum ( cf figure 1 in m90 ) , but at the same time ( ii ) the peak brightness was much smaller than @xmath2@xmath48 reached by v047 cyg during its present 2010 outburst which resembles a true nova eruption .",
    "the 1936 - 1938 event could have been one of the usual low amplitude , long - lasting outbursts that symbiotic binaries frequently display .",
    "two such active phases during the 1990 s were reported and discussed by munari et al .",
    "( 1994 ) , kolotilov et al .",
    "( 1998 , 2003 , hereafter k98 and k03 ) , and some earlier ones can be spotted in the historical light - curves of v407 cyg by munari and jurdana - epi ( 2002 ) and m90 .",
    "the 2010 outburst of v407 cyg was discovered on march 10.813 ut by nishiyama and kabashima ( 2010 ) at @xmath5=7.6 mag .",
    "this was at an unsurpassed brightness level in the star s recorded photometric history thereby underscoring the peculiarity and importance of the event .",
    "the first spectroscopic confirmation and analysis of the outburst was given by munari et al .",
    "( 2010a ) who described the event as a he / n nova expanding within the wind of the mira companion .",
    "the similarity with rs oph was also pointed out . in the following weeks and months",
    "the outburst was intensively monitored over several wavelength regimes viz . in @xmath6-rays ( abdo et al .",

    "so far , apart from brief circulars , no comprehensive report on the photometric and spectroscopic evolution of v407 cyg at optical and ir wavelengths is available .",
    "the aim of this letter is thus to provide a first report ; follow - up papers will present a more detailed analysis and modeling of the huge amount of data we have and are still collecting .",
    "optical photometry was recorded with several small telescopes operated by the ans collaboration in northern italy , all equipped with ccds and photometric _",
    "ubvr@xmath7i@xmath7 _ filters .",
    "corrections for bias , dark , and flat fields were applied in the usual manner .",
    "photometric calibration and correction for color equations was performed for all instruments against the same _ ubvr@xmath7i@xmath7 _ sequence calibrated by henden and munari ( 2000 ) around v407 cyg .",
    "our photometry of v407 cyg covering the 2010 outburst is presented in table  1 and plotted in figure  1 and 2 .",
    "optical spectroscopy was obtained with different telescopes : asiago 1.82 m + echelle spectrograph ( 20000 resolving power ) , asiago 1.22 m + b&c spectrograph ( low resolution mode ) , varese 0.6 m + multi mode spectrograph .",
    "a journal of the observations is given in table  2 .",
    "with the varese 0.6 m telescope we obtained both low resolution and echelle spectra .",
    "the latter were recorded both in unbinned ( resolving power 17000 , marked _",
    "ech _ in table 2 ) and binned mode ( resolving power 10000 , marked _",
    "echb _ in table 2 ) .",
    "all spectra ( including echelle ones ) were calibrated in absolute fluxes by observations of several spectrophotometric standards during the night .",
    "their zero - points were then checked against simultaneous bvri photometry by integrating the band transmission profiles on the fluxed spectra .",
    "near - ir observations were carried out in the @xmath8 bands at the mt .",
    "abu 1.2 m telescope during the early outburst phase .",
    "the spectra were obtained at a resolution of @xmath4@xmath9 using a nicmos3 imager / spectrometer .",
    "spectra and photometry of the comparison star hr 7984 were also obtained for the spectro - photometric data reduction .",
    "wavelength calibration was done using oh sky lines and telluric features that register with the stellar spectra .",
    "the detailed reduction of the spectral and photometric data , using iraf tasks , follow a standard procedure that is described for e.g in naik et al .",
    "the journal of infrared spectroscopic observations is given in table  3 , and the results of infrared photometry in table  4 and figure  2 .",
    "emission line . ` nova ejecta ' refer to the broad component ( cf .",
    "3 ) , ` mira wind ' to the superimposed narrow one ( see figure 5).,width=313 ]",
    "the observations presented in this paper show that the violent outburst experienced by v407 cyg in march 2010 was a thermonuclear runaway ( tnr ) , the same event that powers a normal nova eruption . in normal novae , the ejected material essentially expands freely into a void circumstellar medium",
    ". however , in v407 cyg , the fast ejecta have to expand into the dense and slow wind of the mira companion , and are thus progressively slowed down as the pre - existing circumstellar material is swept up in an expanding shell .",
    "noteworthy , the pre - existing circumstellar material offers an ideal ionization target for the hard radiation from the initial tnr flash .",
    "the similarity with the outburst displayed by the celebrated rs oph is evident ( bode 1987 , evans et al . 2008 , and references therein ) .",
    "the latter is a symbiotic binary , with an orbital period of 460 days and an m giant filling its roche lobe ( schaefer 2009 ) which transfers material to a massive wd ( hachisu et al .",
    "similar nova eruptions have been seen also in the symbiotic binaries and recurrent novae t crb , v745 oph and v3890 sgr ( schaefer 2010 ) .",
    "what occured in v407 cyg is well illustrated by the evolution of the h@xmath10 profile ( figure  5 ) and its width and integrated flux ( top panels of figure  2 ) .",
    "at the earliest stages , the h@xmath10 profile is dominated by a sharp component superposed on a much broader one , as first noted by munari et al .",
    "( 2010a ) .",
    "the sharp component , identical to that in quiescence but enormously brighter ( cf profiles for 2008 and 2009 in figure 5 ) , is due to the sudden ionization of a large fraction of the mira s wind by the flash of energetic radiation produced by the tnr event .",
    "the wind of the mira does not as yet get perturbed kinematically , as proven by the preserved sharpness of the h@xmath10 profile that increased its emissivity by two orders of magnitude compared to quiescence .",
    "the flux of hard photons , however , is not large enough to ionize the whole mira wind , as indicated by the persistence of the sharp absorption component which maintains the same heliocentric radial velocity as in quiescence ( @xmath1150 km / sec ) .",
    "the intensity of the h@xmath10 sharp component rapidly declines subsequently ( cf figure  2 ) , with a recombination time scale of 4 days , which can be written as @xmath12 following ferland ( 2003 ) .",
    "it corresponds to a density of about 5@xmath1310@xmath14 @xmath15 for the fraction of the mira wind ionized by the tnr initial flash .",
    "the point at day + 12.3 in figure  2 , e.g. the last epoch at which a narrow component could still be resolved in the h@xmath10 profiles of figure  5 , deviates from the @xmath16=4 days of earlier points . by this time",
    ", the nova ejecta has begun to turn optically thin and the hard radiation field of the central star ( presumably still burning hydrogen at its surface during the constant luminosity phase ) is hot and intense enough to produce coronal emission lines , as reported by munari et al .",
    "( 2010b ) . the same radiation field , leaking through the optically thin ejecta , is also responsible for sustaining the ionization of the circumstellar gas not yet reached by the expanding shell .",
    "the broad component of the v407 cyg h@xmath10 profiles in figure  5 , originates instead in the material ejected at high velocity , as in any normal nova .",
    "the broad spectrum nicely matches that of a normal `` he / n '' nova ( williams 1992 ) as illustrated by the low resolution optical and infrared spectra for days + 2.3 and + 4.2 in figure  3 and 4 respectively .",
    "a he / n spectrum is typical of fast novae and of rs oph too .",
    "the nova ejecta is rapidly decelerated while trying to expand through the surrounding mira wind and the distinction between a sharp and a broad component to the emission lines is then progressively attenuated , disappearing two weeks past optical maximum .",
    "as more material is swept by the expanding shell , the velocity continues to decrease .",
    "figure  2 illustrates the temporal evolution of the fwhm ( in km sec@xmath0 ) of the broad component of h@xmath10 , which is accurately fitted by the expression @xmath17 including later phases characterized by 400 , 280 and 200 km  s@xmath0 on days + 48.2 , + 105 and + 196 respectively .",
    "the same trend is shared also by the hydrogen lines dominating the infrared spectra of figure  4 .",
    "for comparison the fwhm of h@xmath10 in quiescence was stable at @xmath4120 km  s@xmath0 ( cf profiles for 2008 and 2009 in figure 5 ) .",
    "figure  5 shows the emergence of [ nii ] 6548 , 6584   doublet two months past optical maximum .",
    "it did not originate in the expanding material , but instead in the outer wind of the mira , external to the expanding shell .",
    "this is proved since its profile fwhm of @xmath4110 km",
    "s@xmath0 is much sharper than that of the adjacent h@xmath10 and identical to the width in quiescence .",
    "the existence of an outer region of the mira wind not yet reached on day + 196 by the already greatly slowed down ejecta ( cf the sharp absorption component at @xmath1150 km s@xmath0 in figure  5 ) , leads us to speculate that some part of the ejecta could remain bound to the binary system and could be re - accreted at later times by the wd .",
    "the light - curve of v407 cyg over the last 15 years is presented in figure  1 .",
    "it is characterized by three main components : ( 1 ) the 745 day pulsation of the mira ( sinusoid drawn as a solid line ) , which dominates the light - curve at reddest wavelengths ; ( 2 ) the presence of a limited amplitude , slow evolution active phase ( dashed line in the @xmath5 band panel ) that peaked in intensity in 1998/99 ( described in detail by k98 and k03 ) when it rivalled in @xmath5 the brightness of the mira but went unnoticeable in @xmath18 .",
    "this corresponds to the typical , non - tnr outbursts that essentially all symbiotic stars have experienced several times in their recorded photometric history ; and ( 3 ) the violent , rapid and bright tnr outburst of 2010 .",
    "the latter overwhelmed the brightness of the mira at optical wavelengths , but only equalled it in the @xmath19 band ( cf .",
    "data in table  4 with the long term @xmath20@xmath21@xmath19 light - curve of the mira presented by k98 and k03 ) .",
    "figure  2 presents a zoomed view on the earliest evolution of the 2010 outburst in the @xmath2@xmath5@xmath22@xmath18@xmath20@xmath21@xmath19 bands .",
    "the optical maximum was reached at @xmath5=7.1 on march 10.8 ut , and the subsequent decline was very fast and characterized by @xmath23=5.9 and @xmath24=24 days .",
    "the decline was similarly fast in t crb , v745 sco , rs oph and v3890 sgr that showed @xmath25= 4 , 5 , 7 and 9 days , respectively .",
    "the @xmath5-band light - curve in figure  1 shows a distinct knee at day + 47 . by analogy with rs oph ( cf .",
    "hachisu et al .",
    "2006 ) , it could mark the end of the stable h - burning on the wd .",
    "the outburst evolution seen in the @xmath18 panel in figure  1 could appear in conflict with the expected underlying pulsation cycle of the mira .",
    "indeed , the pulsation of the latter is known to be highly variable from cycle to cycle ( k98 , munari and jurdana - sepic 2002 ) , with puzzling sharp minima occurring at various pulsation phases ( kiziloglu and kiziloglu 2010 ; some of them are visible also in the light - curve of figure  1 in 2007 and 2009 ) , and that could be related to the unusual nature of the mira in v407 cyg .",
    "in fact , miras of such a long pulsation period are usually the central stars of oh / ir sources and their thick dust cocoon prevent them from being visible in the optical .",
    "as remarked by m90 , the presence of the hot and outbursting wd companion , could disturb the formation of the dust cocoon and thus make the mira in v407 cyg visible at optical wavelengths ."
