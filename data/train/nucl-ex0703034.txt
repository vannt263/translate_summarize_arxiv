    "pseudo - scalar @xmath2-meson exchange is , to first order , suppressed by the okubo - zweig - iizuka ( ozi ) rule in the vector meson dominance model ( vdm )  @xcite because of the dominant @xmath5 quark content of @xmath0 mesons .",
    "furthermore , with the use of an isoscalar deuteron target , the coupling between isovector pions and deuterons is forbidden due to isospin conservation  @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the coherent photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons from deuterons becomes an excellent source of information for pomeron dynamics at low energies  @xcite .",
    "in addition , coherent @xmath0-meson photoproduction provides the opportunity to observe additional exotic processes .",
    "possible channels include regge trajectories associated with particles containing gluonic degree of freedom ( _ e.g. _ , a daughter pomeron inspired by a scalar - type @xmath6 glueball  @xcite , and scalar or tensor mesons  @xcite ) .",

    "the differential cross sections ( extrapolated to zero degrees ) have a local maximum around 2.0 gev .",
    "it was conjectured that this structure was not solely due to the non - negligible pseudo - scalar - meson processes at low energies but is likely signaling new dynamics beyond the pomeron .",
    "besides the cross section information , the decay angular distribution of @xmath0 mesons with respect to the photon polarization helps to differentiate the relative contributions from natural - parity ( @xmath7 ) and unnatural - parity exchange processes ( @xmath8 )  @xcite . with the availability of linearly polarized photon beams ,",

    "in this letter , we present measurements of differential cross sections and decay asymmetries of coherent @xmath0-meson photoproduction from liquid deuterium near threshold in the very forward direction with linearly polarized photons using the leps spectrometer  @xcite .",
    "highly polarized photons were produced by backward compton scattering with an ultra - violet ar laser from 8 gev electrons in the storage ring of spring-8 .",
    "the photon energy ( @xmath1 ) was determined by measuring the recoil electrons with a tagging spectrometer event by event . a liquid deuterium target with an effective length of 16 cm was employed .",

    "charged particles produced at the targets were detected at forward angles with the leps spectrometer which consisted of a dipole magnet , a silicon - strip vertex detector , three multiwire drift chambers , a plastic scintillator ( sc ) behind the target , and a time - of - flight ( tof ) hodoscope placed downstream of the tracking detectors .",
    "the charged particle identification was made by mass reconstruction using both time of flight and momentum information .",
    "the momentum resolution for 1 gev / c particles was 6 mev / c .",

    "the vertex positions of @xmath11   pairs were required to be within the target boundaries .",
    "a clear signal of @xmath0 mesons was seen in the invariant mass of @xmath11  pairs , m(@xmath11 ) , for @xmath1=1.5 - 2.4 gev as shown in fig .",

    "instead , the individual yields were disentangled by fitting the distributions of missing mass @xmath12 where the reaction of coherent @xmath0 production from deuterons , @xmath26@xmath27@xmath28 , has a structure peaking at the mass of deuterons 1.875 gev / c@xmath4 , as shown in fig .",

    "a photon energy resolution of 10 mev was determined from the width of the missing mass spectra of the @xmath0 events in data from a hydrogen target .",
    "the @xmath12 distribution of incoherent events is affected by the fermi motion and the offshell effects of the target nucleons inside deuterium .",
    "the treatment of offshell effects was found to be the dominant source of systematic errors in this work .",
    "two kinds of approaches were studied for the estimate of systematic bias . in the first approach  @xcite ,",
    "the spectator nucleon was assumed to be on - shell and the total energy of the target nucleon was determined under the condition of fermi momenta generated by a parameterization with the paris potential  @xcite .",
    "assuming isospin symmetry in the photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons from a free nucleon , the event weighting was characterized by the measured differential cross section from protons @xmath29/@xmath30",
    "@xcite where @xmath31 is the effective photon energy giving the same center - of - mass energy @xmath32 of an on - shell target nucleon at rest .",
    "the interference between isoscalar @xmath9 and isovector @xmath2 exchange could lead to isospin asymmetry .",
    "however the ozi effect and the smallness of the @xmath9-n coupling strongly suppress this interference effect and thus the isospin asymmetry of the differential cross sections in the forward direction are expected to be small  @xcite .",
    "the second approach differs from the previous one in that the degree by which the target nucleon is offshell was randomly selected between zero and the full scale in each event whereas the mass of target remained unchanged after the interaction .",
    "the kinematics of the produced @xmath0-meson were determined by the final two - body phase space distribution .",
    "the mean values and statistic errors of the measurements using these two approaches were averaged for the final ones , and the difference of mean values were used for the estimation of the systematic uncertainty .",
    "first we constructed the differential cross sections in the region 1.57@xmath24@xmath1@xmath242.37 gev and @xmath23@xmath240.4 gev@xmath4/c@xmath4 .",
    "sets of missing mass spectra of selected @xmath0 events , in the bin sizes of 0.1 gev for @xmath33  and 0.02 gev@xmath4/c@xmath4 for @xmath18 , were fitted with those of mc simulated coherent and incoherent events and background processes .",

    "[ fig : tdiscro ] .",
    "the errors ( and same below ) are shown by error bars where the smaller range is statistical errors and the whole range is the square root sum of statistical and systematic uncertainties .",
    "the systematic uncertainties come from the disentanglement fit ( 25 - 30 % ) , background ( 3% ) , luminosity ( 5% ) and track reconstruction efficiency ( 5 - 10% ) .",
    "the fit was done with an expression inspired by a single - scattering diagram  @xcite : @xmath35=@xmath36@xmath37 ^ 2$]/@xmath38 ^ 2 $ ] where @xmath39 is the deuteron form factor and",

    "it is noted that the systematic error of the slope parameter is about 10% , which is less than the cross section uncertainties .",
    "the reason is two - fold : for one , the main systematic errors in the cross sections @xmath48 ( from the uncertainties in disentangling coherent and > incoherent ) vary in a more or less coherent way across all @xmath20 bins ; second , the slope parameter in the fitting function has a nonlinear @xmath20-dependence .",
