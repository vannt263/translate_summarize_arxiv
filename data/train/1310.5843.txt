    "the lepton flavor mixing is described by the pontecorvo - maki - nakagawa - sakata ( pmns ) matrix @xmath7 @xcite.given neutrinos the majorana nature , the pmns matrix can be parametrized in terms of three flavor mixing angles ( @xmath8 ) and three cp - violating phases ( @xmath9 ) as follows : @xmath10 where @xmath11 and @xmath12 ( for @xmath13 ) .",
    "so far all the three neutrino mixing angles have been measured to precisely in neutrino oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "a determination of the phase parameter @xmath14 will be one of the major goals in the next - generation long - baseline neutrino oscillation experiments .",
    "the most challenging task is to detect the majorana phases @xmath15 and @xmath16 , which can only emerge in the lepton flavor violation ( lnv ) processes . ref .",
    "@xcite shows that it is in principle possible to determine all the three phases from the cp - violating asymmetries @xmath17 between @xmath5 and @xmath6 oscillations .",
    "here we report our work in ref .",
    "@xcite , where we give a systematic analysis of the effective parameters and cp - violating asymmetries in the neutrino - antineutrino oscillations .",
    "in section 2 we briefly review some issues of three - flavor neutrino - antineutrino oscillations .",
    "six independent @xmath0-like mass terms @xmath18 and nine independent jalskog - like parameters @xmath19 ( for @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) are introduced and their main features are discussed . in section 3",
    "we study the sensitivities of six cp - violating asymmetries @xmath22 to the three phases , neutrino mass ordering , and the ratio of the neutrino beam energy @xmath23 to the baseline length @xmath24 .",

    "@xmath32 stands for the helicity suppression in the transition between @xmath33 and @xmath34 . the effective mass term @xmath35 is defined as @xmath36 .",
    "we call them @xmath0-like mass terms since @xmath37 is the effective mass term of the @xmath0 decay . @xmath38 and @xmath39 describe the cp - conserving and cp - violating contributions of the pmns mixing , where the greek and latin subscripts running over @xmath40 and @xmath41 , respectively .",
    "the cp - violating parts are referred to as jarlskog - like parameters since they are similar to the definition of the jarlskog parameter @xmath42 @xcite .",
    "a measurement of neutrino - antineutrino oscillations is far beyond nowadays experimental capability as @xmath43 highly suppressed by the factor @xmath44 .",
    "the typical oscillation lengths by taking @xmath45 kev for example , ( 1 ) @xmath46 , and ( 2 ) @xmath47 , corresponding to @xmath48 and @xmath49 , respectively . to make the oscillation effect detectable , the sizes of the neutrino ( or antineutrino ) source and the detector should be much smaller than @xmath50 and ( or ) @xmath51 .    the jarlskog - like parameters @xmath2 satisfy the relations",
    "@xmath19= @xmath52 = @xmath53 = @xmath54 , and @xmath55=@xmath56 ; but @xmath57 for @xmath58 . with the sum rules @xmath59 ( @xmath60 )",

    ", we take @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 as inputs @xcite . in general , @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 and @xmath67",
    "can maximally reach about @xmath68 in magnitude ; in comparison , the jarlskog invariant @xmath69 , suppressed by @xmath70 .",
    "one special case is the  pseudo - dirac \" case with @xmath71 .",
    "this case is interesting because appreciable cp- and t - violating effects are expected to show up in neutrino - antineutrino oscillations even if the majorana phases @xmath15 and @xmath16 vanish .",
    "the effective mass terms @xmath18 are important to understand the origin of neutrino masses , since they are simply the @xmath72 elements of the symmetric majorana neutrino mass matrix @xmath73 in the charged lepton flavor basis .",
    "these parameters also play important roles in some other lnv processes , such as the doubly charged higgs decay @xmath74 @xcite in the type - ii seesaw mechanism @xcite and some lnv decays of @xmath29 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 mesons @xcite .",
    "a measurement of the three cp - violating phases is absolutely necessary in order to fully reconstruct the neutrino mass matrix @xmath73 .",
    "figure 1 illustrates the profiles of six @xmath77 , with inputs shown above .",
    "we allow @xmath14 to randomly vary in @xmath78 and @xmath15 , @xmath16 vary in @xmath79 . for some values of the lightest neutrino mass ,",
    "texture zero @xmath80 is allowed , either in the normal hierarchy ( e.g. , @xmath81 @xcite ) or in the inverted hierarchy ( e.g. , @xmath82 ) , or in both of them ( e.g. , @xmath83 ) .",
    "to eliminate the @xmath84 and @xmath85 factors , we define the cp - violating asymmetry between @xmath86 and @xmath87 oscillations @xcite @xmath88 + only six of the nine cp - violating asymmetries are independent and nontrivial because of @xmath89 .",
    "the @xmath90 oscillation is actually a kind of  appearance \" process and thus it can accommodate the cp - violating effects .",
    "because of the fact @xmath91 , there may exist two oscillating regions dominated respectively by @xmath92 and @xmath93 .",
    "we classify our analysis into three cases : ( 1 ) the normal neutrino mass hierarchy with @xmath94 , ( 2 ) the inverted neutrino mass hierarchy with @xmath95 , and ( 3 ) the nearly degenerate mass hierarchy with @xmath96 . by fixing the cp phases , we schematically show some results in figs .",
    "( 2 ) , ( 3 ) and ( 4 ) , where the inputs of mixing angles and mass - squared differences are the same as above .",
    "note that some of @xmath17 are remarkably dependent on the cp phases .",
    "this has been considered in ref .",
    "@xcite , and more detailed discussions can be found over there .",
    "in principle , one may determine the majorana phases of the pmns matrix in neutrino - antineutrino oscillations . such an experiment might be feasible in the very distant future , but a systematic study of cp violation in neutrino - antineutrino oscillations is still useful , so as to enrich the majorana neutrino phenomenology .",
    "six independent @xmath0-like mass terms @xmath1 and nine independent jalskog - like parameters @xmath19 have been analyzed in detail , and allowed parameter spaces for @xmath1 have been presented .",
    "we have also carried out an analysis of the sensitivities of six cp - violating asymmetries @xmath17 to the three phase parameters and the ratio @xmath97 in different mass hierarchies .",
    "our analytical and numerical results provide a complete description of the distinct roles of majorana cp - violating phases in neutrino - antineutrino oscillations .",
