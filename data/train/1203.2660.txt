    "in this paper , we consider graphs @xmath7 that are finite , simple and connected . as usual , the distance between two vertices @xmath8 and @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath10 , or simply @xmath11 if the graph @xmath1 is clear .",
    "a vertex @xmath12 is said to _ resolve _ a pair @xmath13 if @xmath14 .",
    "a set @xmath15 is a _ resolving set _ for @xmath1 if any pair of vertices of @xmath1 can be resolved by some vertex in @xmath0 .",
    "if the set @xmath0 is as small as possible , then it is called a _",
    "metric basis _ and its cardinality @xmath16 is the _ metric dimension _ of the graph @xmath1 .",
    "metric bases and resolving sets were first introduced to the graph theory literature in the 1970s by slater  @xcite and independently by harary and melter  @xcite .",
    "( however , the definition of a metric basis for an arbitrary metric space was known in the geometry literature at least 20 years earlier : see blumenthal ( * ? ? ?",
    "* definition 39.1 ) , for instance . ) in his seminal paper , slater mentioned the following potential application : a moving point in a graph may be located by finding the distances from the point to a collection of sonar or loran stations which have been judiciously positioned in the graph .",
    "subsequently , many other applications of resolving sets and metric dimension have appeared in the literature .",
    "for example , the study of resolvability in hypercubes is closely related to a coin - weighing problem ( see  @xcite for details ) ; strategies for the _ mastermind _ game use resolving sets in hamming graphs  @xcite ; resolving sets in triangular , rectangular and hexagonal grids have been proposed to study digital images  @xcite ; a method based on resolving sets for differentiating substances with the same chemical formula is given in  @xcite .",
    "mathematical applications of closely - related parameters were given by babai in the study of the graph isomorphism problem  @xcite and in obtaining bounds on the possible orders of primitive permutation groups  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .",
    "since the problem of computing the metric dimension of a graph is np - complete ( see  @xcite ) , many efforts have been focused on finding either exact values or good bounds for the metric dimension of certain classes of graphs .",
    "examples include trees  @xcite , wheels  @xcite , unicyclic graphs  @xcite , cayley digraphs  @xcite and cartesian products  @xcite , among others",
    ".    a lower bound on the metric dimension of a graph @xmath1 can be obtained by considering its automorphism group @xmath17 .",
    "a _ base _ for a group acting on a set is a collection of points , chosen so that the only group element fixing all of those points is the identity element ; equivalently , every group element is uniquely specified by its action on those points .",
    "( see  @xcite for more background on bases . )",
    "recently , in the case where the group is the automorphism group of a graph @xmath1 , bases have been referred to as _ determining sets _ for @xmath1 , and the least cardinality of a base for @xmath17 has become known as the _ determining number _ of @xmath1 , denoted @xmath18 ( see  @xcite ) .",
    "it is straightforward to verify the following result ( see , for instance , ) .",
    "[ prop : detmet ] for any finite , connected graph  @xmath1 , we have @xmath19 .",
    "we refer the reader to  @xcite for further information on the relationship between the two parameters .    in this paper , we are interested in the metric dimension of johnson and kneser graphs , which we now introduce .",
    "the _ kneser graph _",
    "@xmath6 ( where @xmath20 ) has the collection @xmath21}{k}$ ] of all @xmath22-subsets of the @xmath23-set @xmath24=\\{1,\\ldots , n\\}$ ] as vertices , and edges connecting disjoint subsets .",
    "as an example , the petersen graph is the kneser graph @xmath25 .",
    "like kneser graphs , the vertices of the _ johnson graph _ @xmath5 , with @xmath20 , are the @xmath22-subsets of @xmath24 $ ] , but two @xmath22-subsets are adjacent when their intersection has size @xmath26 .",
    "it is easy to see that the kneser graph @xmath6 is connected if and only if @xmath27 : if @xmath28 , there are no edges , while if @xmath29 , the kneser graph is a perfect matching . also , it is not difficult to show that the johnson graphs @xmath5 and @xmath30 are isomorphic",
    ". consequently , in the remainder of the paper , we shall only consider kneser graphs with @xmath27 and johnson graphs with @xmath31 .",
    "a consequence of the definition is that in the johnson graph @xmath5 there is a one - to - one correspondence between intersection sizes and distances : specifically , the distance between two vertices @xmath32 and @xmath33 in @xmath5 is given by @xmath34 from this , it is clear that @xmath5 has diameter  @xmath22 .",
    "furthermore , one can show that the johnson graph @xmath5 is _ distance - transitive _",
    ", i.e.  for any vertices @xmath35 with @xmath36 , there is an automorphism mapping @xmath32 to @xmath37 and @xmath33 to @xmath38 ( see  @xcite for more details ) . in general",
    ", kneser graphs do not have this property , as the correspondence between distances and intersection sizes does not arise .",
    "however , there are two exceptional families , and both are `` extreme '' cases .",
    "first , the kneser graph @xmath39 is the complement of the corresponding johnson graph @xmath40 , and both graphs have diameter  2 , so if @xmath41 then @xmath42 , and vice - versa .",
    "secondly , there is the kneser graph @xmath43 ( known as the _ odd graph _ : see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the notation @xmath44 is often used to denote this graph , with the subscript @xmath45 being chosen as it is the valency of the graph ; this family includes the petersen graph as @xmath46 .",
    "the distance between two vertices in an odd graph is determined exactly by the size of the intersection of the corresponding @xmath22-subsets , but by a different rule : @xmath47    in general , the distance between two vertices of a kneser graph @xmath6 is specified by the size of the intersection of the corresponding @xmath22-subsets ( but not with a one - to - one correspondence ) . if @xmath48 , it is not difficult to see that two non - adjacent vertices of @xmath6 share a common neighbour , and thus the distance between vertices @xmath32 and @xmath33 is either 1 or 2 , depending on whether @xmath49 is empty or not .",
    "more generally , if we write @xmath50 , it was shown in  @xcite that distances in @xmath51 are given by the following formula : @xmath52 for @xmath53 and @xmath54 .    in this paper , we are concerned with constructing resolving sets for johnson and kneser graphs . to begin ,",
    "we show that resolving sets for the two families of graphs are related in a straightforward way .",
    "[ imp ] suppose @xmath27 .",
    "any resolving set @xmath55 for the kneser graph @xmath6 is a resolving set for @xmath5 .",
    "thus @xmath56 .",
    "suppose that the vertex @xmath37 in the kneser graph @xmath6 resolves the pair @xmath57 .",
    "clearly then @xmath58 .",
    "by equation  [ johnsondistance ] , @xmath32 and @xmath33 are also resolved by @xmath37 in @xmath5 , and therefore the result follows .",
    "the converse of this lemma is not true in general , apart from the two exceptional families of kneser graphs listed above , namely @xmath39 and @xmath43 . in the first of those cases , any",
    "resolving set for @xmath40 is also a resolving set for @xmath39 , and hence @xmath59 ; likewise , any resolving set for @xmath60 is also a resolving set for the odd graph @xmath61 , and hence @xmath62 .    for @xmath27 ,",
    "the johnson graph @xmath5 and kneser graph @xmath6 have the same automorphism group , namely the symmetric group  @xmath63 in its action on the @xmath22-subsets of @xmath24 $ ] ( see  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* sections 2.5 and 3.8 ) ) .",
    "( if @xmath29 , then @xmath64 : the extra automorphisms arise from being able to interchange a @xmath22-subset with its complement . )",
    "thus , for @xmath27 , @xmath65 . a summary of results about @xmath66 and @xmath67 can be found in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* section 2.5 ) ; in particular , in  @xcite the following result was obtained .",
    "[ thm : kneserdet ] suppose @xmath68 , and let @xmath69 be an integer such that @xmath70 .",
    "then whenever the inequality @xmath71 is satisfied , it follows that @xmath72 .    by proposition  [ prop : detmet ] ,",
    "these provide a lower bound of approximately @xmath73 on the metric dimension of these graphs .",
    "we note that for fixed values of @xmath22 , this lower bound is linear in @xmath23 .",
    "the metric dimension of the johnson graph @xmath40 , and thus also the kneser graph @xmath39 , were determined precisely in  @xcite : the values depend on congruence classes modulo  @xmath74 .",
    "[ th : k=2 ] suppose @xmath75 . then for the metric dimension of the johnson graph @xmath40 and kneser graph @xmath39 , where @xmath76 ( for @xmath77 ) , we have @xmath78 .    in fact , for @xmath79 , equality is achieved in proposition  [ prop : detmet ] , while in the other cases we have a difference of  @xmath80 between the determining number and metric dimension ( see  @xcite for details ) .    our goal in this paper is not to obtain exact values for the metric dimension of johnson and kneser graphs , but rather to ( i ) give explicit constructions of resolving sets , and ( ii ) demonstrate how various interesting combinatorial and geometric structures may be used as resolving sets for these graphs . in particular , some of our constructions provide good upper bounds on the metric dimension of @xmath5 and/or @xmath6 .",
    "the remainder of the paper is organized into four sections : in section  [ sec : general ] we give some general constructions ; sections  [ sec : johnson ] and  [ sec : kneser ] are devoted to johnson and kneser graphs , respectively ; section  [ sec : final ] has some concluding remarks .",
    "in this section , we give some constructions for resolving sets of johnson and kneser graphs , for arbitrary values of @xmath23 and @xmath22 .",
    "each of these constructions involves specifying an appropriate partition of the set @xmath24 $ ] , and taking subsets of the parts as the vertices of a resolving set .",
    "we give two related but different constructions of resolving sets , considering johnson and kneser graphs separately ; however , in the case @xmath81 , the two constructions coincide , and each generalizes the construction in  @xcite which yields theorem  [ th : k=2 ] .",
    "we then give an improved construction for kneser graphs of diameter  @xmath74 .",
    "recall from equation  [ johnsondistance ] that the distance between two vertices @xmath32 and @xmath33 in the johnson graph @xmath5 is given by @xmath82 thus , a vertex @xmath83 resolves the pair @xmath84 if and only if @xmath58 , which is equivalent to @xmath85 .",
    "a straightforward consequence is the following lemma .",

    "we will divide our construction into two separate cases .",
    "first , we will assume that @xmath92 for some positive integer @xmath93 , as our construction is more straightforward in that situation ; later , we will suppose otherwise .",

    "our goal is to find a vertex @xmath88 which resolves @xmath32 and @xmath33 , that is , @xmath89 .",
    "note that if @xmath99 , we have @xmath106 , so it suffices to show that @xmath107 .    since @xmath108 , there exists an index @xmath109 such that @xmath110 .",

    "at least one of    @xmath135 .",
