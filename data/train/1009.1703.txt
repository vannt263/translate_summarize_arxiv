    "horava@xcite has applied the anisotropic scaling that lifshitz developed@xcite for quantum gravity and established the power - counting renormalizability of the theory in 3 + 1 dimensional space - time .",
    "this model is usually called horava lifshitz ( hl ) gravity .",
    "cosmological solutions of hl gravity for the friedmann - lema^ itre - robertson - walker metric have been described l \" u , mei and pope ( lmp ) @xcite .",
    "although there has also been a lot of other work on hl gravity @xcite , the lmp solution is the most basic one , and therefore our discussion is based around it .",
    "the lmp solutions are based on conditions of relaxed projectability and of detailed balance .",
    "recently , gong et al.@xcite have shown using linear cosmological perturbation theory with projectability that hl gravity is reduced by the faddeev and jackiw condition@xcite and that there is a scalar ghost mode for @xmath2 , where @xmath1 is the running energy parameter in the hl model . in 1971 , hawking showed that black holes should have been generated with various masses in the early universe@xcite .",
    "nowadays , such black holes are called primordial black holes ( pbhs ) , and their masses @xmath3 are estimated from the hubble equation as @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the current time from the big bang .",
    "the black holes emit energy according to the stefan - boltzmann law and evaporate .",
    "because the time necessary for evaporation is @xmath6 years , black holes that are lighter than @xmath7 have completely evaporated via hawking radiation before the present @xmath8@xcite and only heavier pbhs remain . in @xcite",
    ", the observational values are given between 35 mev and 175 mev for @xmath9-rays , @xmath10 , with the hubble expansion rate @xmath11 , and between 30 mev and 120 gev for @xmath9-rays , @xmath12 .",
    "the observational upper limit on the pbh density parameter from measurements of hawking radiation is @xcite @xmath13 however , pbhs are as yet unidentified stellar objects@xcite and may constitute all the dark matter@xcite .",
    "regrettably , the nature of dark matter and dark energy is not yet understood , but here we assume that the density parameter of the pbh @xmath0 contains the density parameters of the dark energy @xmath14 or the dark matter @xmath15 .",
    "the values of the various density parameters from wmap @xcite are @xmath16 for baryons , @xmath17 for the dark matter and @xmath18 for the dark energy .    in hl gravity",
    "the ( running ) energy parameter @xmath1 lies in the range @xmath19 .",
    "the present value of the energy parameter is @xmath20 , based on observations of supernova , the baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) and the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) @xcite .",
    "however , because we are only discussing pbhs and the focus of our research is different from theirs , such a tight bound on @xmath21 may not be appropriate .",
    "note also that many works have been carried out that focus on dark energy in the hl model@xcite .",
    "this rest of this article is arranged as follows . in the next section",
    "we review hl gravity and the lmp solutions . in the following section ,",
    "we compare the lmp solutions with current observational pbh data",
    ". finally , we present our conclusions .",
    "the values in si units of some cosmological constants are given in an appendix .",
    "hl gravity@xcite has the anisotropic scaling property @xmath22 , with critical exponent @xmath23 .",
    "the theory is lorentz invariant in the long distance , ir limit ( @xmath24 ) but it is not lorentz invariant in the short distance , uv limit ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the arnowitt - deser - misner ( adm ) decomposition of 4-dimensional space - time is given by @xmath26 where @xmath27 is the lapse field , @xmath28 is the shift field and @xmath29 is the spatial metric .",
    "the scale dimensions of physical quantities in units of mass are @xmath30 = -2 $ ] , @xmath31 = [ g_{ij } ] = 0 $ ] , and @xmath32 = z - 1 $ ] . for simplicity , we assume that @xmath27 depends only on time @xmath33 ( @xmath34 , projectability ) . the adm decomposition of einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action is @xmath35 where @xmath36 is newton s gravitational constant and @xmath37 is the extrinsic curvature defined by @xmath38 . the original action of horava@xcite is @xmath39 where @xmath40 and @xmath41 are constant parameters , and @xmath42 is the cotton tensor @xmath43 .",
    "note that only @xmath44 controls the strength of the interaction and the free state corresponds to the limit @xmath45 .",
    "also note that we can identify @xmath46 as the ir limit and @xmath47 as the uv limit . by comparing ( [ eqn : hlaction ] ) with ( [ eqn : eh ] )",
    "the following relations are obtained .",
    "@xmath48 where @xmath49 is the cosmological constant . in 3 + 1 dimensions , the correspondence of the hl action to the einstein - hilbert ( eh ) action demands @xmath50 ( @xmath34 , the ir limit ) .",
    "if we demand that the speed of light is positive in ( [ eqn : cgl ] ) , then @xmath41 is negative .",
    "the analytic continuation @xmath51 and @xmath52 yields positive @xmath41 .",
    "then , we can describe the speed of light as @xmath53  for @xmath54 .",
    "the friedmann - lema^ itre - robertson - walker form is @xmath55 where @xmath56 corresponds to a closed , flat or open universe , respectively , and @xmath57 is the scale factor . for this metric the friedmann equation ( in units where @xmath58 ) is @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the sum of the energy density of matter ( @xmath61 ) and the energy density of radiation ( @xmath62 ) .",
    "reintroducing the speed of light explicitly , the density parameter is defined by the friedmann equation ( [ eqn : lmpfriedmann ] ) through @xmath63 , \\label{eqn : friedmanneq}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the energy density of matter @xmath61 consists of the baryonic energy density @xmath64 and the dark matter energy density @xmath65 , the total energy density of radiation @xmath62 consists of the photon energy density @xmath66 and the muonic energy density @xmath67 ( @xmath34 , @xmath68@xcite ) , and @xmath69 is the hubble parameter . on the right hand side of ( [ eqn : friedmanneq ] ) ,",
    "we identify the first term as the matter density parameter @xmath70 , the second term as the radiation density parameter @xmath71 and the third term as the curvature density parameter @xmath72 .",
    "consequently we obtain @xmath73.\\ ] ] the right hand side of this equation is called the dark radiation @xcite .",
    "the dark radiation contributes negative energy density and the greater part of this contribution disappears if the curvature @xmath74 is zero .",
    "we make the following assumptions .",
    "the density parameter of pbhs takes its maximum value @xmath75 if it includes the density parameters of the dark matter @xmath15 and dark energy @xmath14 .",
    "so @xmath76 from current observations ( via hawking radiation ) ( also see @xcite ) , it is thought that the present density parameter for pbhs @xmath77 satisfies @xmath78 ( [ eqn : upperbound ] ) . because ( [ eqn : upperbound ] ) is based on data from radiation observations , @xmath77 may contain the dark radiation term ( @xmath79 ) .",
    "thus , we obtain @xmath80 because @xmath41 is small , we can neglect second terms of ( [ eqn : dppbh ] ) and ( [ eqn : dppbh0 ] ) . then , assuming @xmath81 and @xmath82 , @xmath83 when we take the ratio of ( [ eqn : sdppbh ] ) and ( [ eqn : sdppbh0 ] ) , we obtain @xmath84 substituting @xmath85 into ( [ eqn : ratioofdensityparameter ] ) gives @xmath86 consequently , @xmath87 introducing @xmath88 , we have @xmath89    from ( [ eqn : lmpfriedmann ] ) the scale factor is @xmath90 where @xmath91 now , we define @xmath92 with the present values being denoted by the subscript @xmath93",
    ". then ( [ eqn : scale_factor ] ) becomes @xmath94 which can be solved easily .",
    "this differential equation has two types of solution for the present hubble parameter @xmath95 : @xmath96 where @xmath97 and @xmath98 are the constants of integration .",
    "with assumption that the extrinsic curvature @xmath74 is zero , we have @xmath99",
    ". then the constants of integration are given by @xmath100 and the present hubble parameters are @xmath101 that is , @xmath102 where @xmath103 then @xmath104 becomes @xmath105 with @xmath106 $ ] and @xmath107}$ ] ( see appendix ) , we obtain @xmath108 thus , @xmath109 in the hl theory the energy parameter @xmath1 is in the range @xmath19 , so we obtain @xmath110{7.80 \\times",
    "r^2}}{3}. \\label{eqn : ourresult}\\ ] ] the physical interpretation of ( [ eqn : ourresult ] ) is discussed in the next section .",
    "if 0.96 is substituted for @xmath75 and @xmath111 is substituted for @xmath77 , ( [ eqn : ourresult ] ) becomes @xmath112 although this range contains the parameter range ( @xmath113 ) of the hl model , it is clear that hl gravity is considerably more restrictive .    inversely ,",
    "when the limitations of the hl model are imposed on ( [ eqn : ourresult ] ) we obtain @xmath114 this is consistent with the result of frampton et al.@xcite .    if the black holes do not contribute to the density parameter(s ) , the present energy parameter @xmath21 in ( [ eqn : ourresult ] ) becomes 1/3 ( i.e. , we attain the uv limit ) . in the hl theory the general theory of relativity ( gr ) is not formed in the uv limit , but is recovered in the ir limit .",
    "thus , @xmath115 is inconsistent with the status of gr of today .",
    "it is interesting to combine our analysis with that of dutta and saridakis@xcite .",
    "if ( [ eqn : ourresult ] ) is combined with their result @xmath116 , it becomes @xmath117 this shows that @xmath75 can be larger than present observed value @xmath77 by few percent .",
    "this is consistent with the prediction in the hl theory that the horizon of a black hole appears as @xmath1 increases @xcite @xcite .",
    "a pbh that has not been observed up to now will be observed in the future because of an increase in @xmath1 .",
    "we thus arrive at the following three possible conclusions .",
    "( 1 ) if the hl theory and the current observational upper bound @xmath78 are correct , then the assumption @xmath118 is doubtful . ( 2 ) if the current observational upper bound @xmath78 and the assumption @xmath118 are correct , then the hl model is doubtful . ( 3 ) if hl gravity and the relation ( [ eqn : relationoandmax ] ) are correct , then the observational @xmath77 may increase slightly as @xmath1 increases .",
    "the present hubble parameter is observed to be @xmath119 $ ] @xcite .",
    "so we take @xmath120    = 2.30 \\times 10^{-18 } \\left [ \\frac{1}{s } \\right ]     = \\frac{1}{4.35 \\times 10^{17 } [ s]}$ ] , where @xmath121 $ ] .",
