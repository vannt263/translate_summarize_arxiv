    "as it was shown by @xcite and @xcite , in the absence of dissipation r modes are subject to a gravitational driven instability ( the cfs instability ) at _ any _ ns spin frequency @xmath0 . an account for dissipative processes stabilizes nss to some extent , resulting in the appearance of the so called `` instability window '' in the @xmath1 ",

    "this apparent contradiction was addressed in a number of papers ( e.g. , @xcite ) which attempted to reconcile theory with observations ( see @xcite for a short review of the existing ideas ) . in this paper",
    "we explore observational consequences of one such idea ( @xcite ) which , as we believe , allows one to explain the existing observations rather naturally .",
    "@xcite argued that a simultaneous account for superfluidity of nucleons in the cores of nss and finite - temperature effects substantially modifies the ns oscillation spectra and leads to a resonance interaction of r mode with superfluid inertial modes at some certain ns temperatures @xmath2 ( called `` resonance temperatures '' in what follows ) .",
    "this resonance interaction stabilizes r modes in the vicinity of @xmath2 . as a result",

    "note that near the resonances ( on the slopes of the stability peaks ) superfluid inertial modes admix to the r - mode solution ( r - mode transforms into a superfluid inertial mode and vice versa ) so that dissipation there is mainly determined by the mutual friction mechanism , which is extremely efficient for superfluid modes ( @xcite ) .",

    "these equations can be rewritten in a more compact form as @xmath51 where @xmath52 , @xmath53 @xmath54 @xmath55 @xmath56 equations ( [ 1])([3 ] ) fully describe evolution of nss in lmxbs . in what follows",
    "we will use them for the analysis of oscillations of ns evolution tracks near the left edge of the stability peak , mentioned in section [ sec : intro ] .",
    "an example of such oscillations is presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] , which is a zoomed in fragment of the track in the vicinity of the stability peak , analogous to that shown in panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : inst1 ] .",
    "the region filled with grey is the stability region inside the peak , almost vertical straight line is the instability curve ( the left edge of the peak ) .",
    "zigzag is the evolutionary track . at point",
    "a of the cycle the r mode amplitude has the lowest value which is not sufficient to keep a star at the given temperature .",
    "thus the ns cools down , crosses the instability curve and enters the instability region where r mode starts to grow . as the r mode amplitude increases , the heating by the dissipation of the excited r mode becomes more and more efficient and slows down the ns cooling rate .",
    "at some moment the ns reaches `` thermal balance '' point ( point b in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] ) , where heating by the accretion and r - mode dissipation exactly compensates ns cooling .",
    "further increase of the r - mode amplitude leads to a temperature growth , that brings the star to the instability curve .",
    "after ns crosses the instability curve ( point c ) , the r - mode rise replaces with the r - mode decay , and ns heating reduces .",
    "when a thermal balance point is reached again ( now it is point d ) , further decreasing of r - mode amplitude results in a net ns cooling . as the ns cools down to the instability curve ( point e ) , the cycle repeats . in what follows , to avoid confusion with the r - mode oscillations , we will call these oscillations @xmath4-oscillations ( emphasizing that it is the oscillations of the r - mode amplitude @xmath4 ) . in the next section @xmath4-oscillations are described analytically .",
    "in what follows , to simplify notations the redshifted internal stellar temperature @xmath1 will be denoted by @xmath57 . unlike the oscillation amplitude squared , @xmath58 , which varies significantly in the course of @xmath4-oscillations , the variations of @xmath57 and @xmath32 ( or @xmath0 ) are small .",
    "thus , for the analysis of @xmath4-oscillations we will present @xmath57 and @xmath32 as a sum of the equilibrium solution ( see below ) which we will denote by the subscript 0 , and a small perturbation near this solution , @xmath59 the equilibrium solution assumes that @xmath60 , @xmath61 , and @xmath62 do not oscillate and the star track follows the left edge of the stability peak , which is defined by the condition @xmath63 it gives us the dependence @xmath64 .",
    "the time dependence of these quantities is driven by the following equations ( cf .",
    "equations  [ 1 ] and [ 2 ] ) @xmath65 hence @xmath66 this equation should be understood as an equation for @xmath67 , because @xmath68 is known from equation ( [ stability_curve ] ) .",
    "generally @xmath69 , while the ratio of the terms @xmath70 and @xmath71 , entering the right - hand - side of equation ( [ a0_eq ] ) , can be estimated as @xmath72 that is it is of the order of the ratio of rotational energy to the thermal energy . in the range of @xmath73 and @xmath74 relevant to lmxbs , this ratio is @xmath75 . at the same time , the external torque @xmath41 in equation ( [ a0_eq ] ) is generally ( at not too small @xmath67 ) comparable to the torque due to r modes , @xmath76 .",
    "this means that to satisfy equation ( [ a0_eq ] ) @xmath67 , to a very good approximation , should be given by the thermal equilibrium condition , @xmath77 substituting now equations ( [ pertt ] ) and ( [ pertomega ] ) into ( [ 1])([3 ] ) one obtains the following system of equations for r - mode oscillation amplitude squared , @xmath58 , and perturbations @xmath78 and @xmath79 ( note that the quantity @xmath58 strongly deviates from its equilibrium value @xmath67 , while perturbations @xmath78 and @xmath79 are small so that only first - order terms @xmath80 and @xmath79 are retained in these equations ) @xmath81 this system does not depend on the external torque @xmath41 explicitly ( only by means of @xmath67 , which is a function of @xmath41 ) , thus it is valid for both ascending - the - peak and descending - the - peak nss , and is even valid in the absence of accretion ( that is , for millisecond pulsars , if they are attached to a peak or for hot widows / hofnars , see @xcite ) . generally , the underlined terms are small , because @xmath57 and @xmath32 only slightly deviate from their equilibrium values , while , as we already mentioned above , the deviation of r - mode amplitude squared , @xmath58 , is not small . thus the leading terms in equations ( [ dt ] ) and ( [ domega ] )",
    "are those proportional to @xmath82 .",
    "dividing now equation ( [ dt ] ) by equation ( [ domega ] ) and keeping the leading terms only , one can estimate [ ( cf .",
    "equation ( [ estim ] ) ] @xmath83 thus it is easy to verify that the terms in the system of equations ( [ dt])([da ] ) @xmath84 are small and can be skipped ( then the equation for @xmath79 decouples and can be disregarded in what follows ) .",
    "we are left then with @xmath85 the time derivative of the equation ( [ dacut ] ) is : @xmath86 substituting now @xmath87 from equation ( [ dt1 ] ) into ( [ dacut2 ] ) , we obtain @xmath88 where we introduced a new variable @xmath89 and defined @xmath90    the third term in the right - hand - side of equation ( [ oscill_y_diss00 ] ) is much smaller than the second one , because @xmath91 evolves on a timescale of peak climbing ( spin - up timescale ) , @xmath92  yr , which is much longer than @xmath93 , where @xmath94 is the cooling timescale , @xmath95  yr .",
    "thus , we will omit the third term in what follows , @xmath96 substituting now @xmath78 from equation ( [ dacut ] ) into ( [ oscill_y_diss0 ] ) , we arrive at @xmath97 where @xmath98 . equation ( [ oscill_y_diss ] ) describes _ nonlinear _ oscillations of the squared amplitude @xmath58 near the equilibrium point @xmath62 with dissipation / excitation described by the last term , which is typically small .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath58 , averaged over the period @xmath99 of @xmath4-oscillations , equals @xmath100 , i.e. , the equilibrium r - mode amplitude @xmath101 is , at the same time , the root mean square of @xmath4 .",
    "indeed , the integral of the function @xmath78 over @xmath99 should vanish ( we ignore a negligible change of the equilibrium temperature @xmath74 on a timescale of @xmath99 ) , @xmath102 on the other hand @xmath103 where use has been made of ( [ dt1 ] ) with the last small term @xmath80 omitted .",
    "thus , because @xmath74 and @xmath73 are almost constants on a timescale of @xmath4-oscillation period , @xmath104 or @xmath100 .    to study @xmath4-oscillations driven by equation ( [ oscill_y_diss ] ) , it is convenient to introduce a notion of the `` energy '' @xmath105 for this equation [ this function is conserved , @xmath106 , when @xmath107 ; then it is just the first integral of equation ( [ oscill_y_diss ] ) ] , @xmath108 equation ( [ oscill_y_diss ] ) is equivalent to the following formula , @xmath109 so that the energy variation averaged over the @xmath4-oscillation period , @xmath99 , is @xmath110 if @xmath111 is negative @xmath4-oscillations are damped , otherwise they are excited .",
    "as long as dissipation / excitation is weak , @xmath112 in this integral can be calculated from equation ( [ oscill_y_diss ] ) with @xmath113 .",
    "equivalently , @xmath112 can be found from equations ( [ dt1 ] ) and ( [ dacut ] ) with the last term [ @xmath114 in equation ( [ dt1 ] ) omitted . to analyze integral in equation ( [ int ] )",
    "let us notice that [ see also ( [ intdt ] ) ] @xmath115 where use has been made of equations ( [ dt1 ] ) ( with the last term neglected ) and ( [ dacut ] ) .",
    "since @xmath74 and @xmath73 are almost constants on a timescale of @xmath4-oscillation period , corresponding quantities can be factored out of the integral , yielding @xmath116 hence , @xmath117 which means that when @xmath118 is negative we have dissipation of @xmath4-oscillations ; in the opposite case @xmath4-oscillations excite .",
    "notice , that the value of @xmath118 depends on the geometry of the stability peak  for wider peaks the derivative @xmath119 , and hence @xmath120 [ see equation ( [ f1 ] ) ] , is smaller .",
    "it results in decrease of @xmath118 with increasing peak width ; for sufficiently wide peaks @xmath118 is negative and @xmath4-oscillations are damped .",
    "the same criterion follows from the analysis of the linear oscillations ( when @xmath121 ) .",
    "the stability of the solution to the system of linear equations @xmath122 requires @xmath123 and @xmath124 .",
    "the last condition is satisfied automatically at the left edge of the peak , while the first one coincides with the stability condition in the non - linear case .",
    "this coincidence was not necessary : a system , unstable in the linear approximation , can , in principle , have stable non - linear solutions ( and vice versa ) .",
    "we can conclude that in the case when @xmath125 a star can not move along the peak without @xmath4-oscillations . in all numerical examples considered below this inequality is satisfied .",
    "we note that a similar criterion was obtained , in the linear approximation , by @xcite .",
    "this reference analyzed stability of an ns track in the vicinity of the instability curve ( positive , negative and horizontal slopes of the instability curve were discussed ) .",
    "the above consideration allowed @xmath4 to vary without limits .",
    "however , the r - mode oscillation amplitude can not _ increase _ infinitely .",
    "it is limited by the saturation amplitude @xmath126 , which is determined by a non - linear interaction of r mode with other oscillation modes , or some other nonlinear processes such as those discussed by @xcite and @xcite ) is only valid if @xmath127 .",
    "for example , if the saturation is defined by the nonlinear mode coupling , this condition means that @xmath4 should be lower than the parametric instability thresholds for all nonlinear mode couplings . for larger r - mode",
    "amplitudes the nonlinear mode coupling leads to excitation of daughter modes , and this excitation should be described properly ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) . for definiteness",
    ", we apply a simplified model , assuming that r mode saturation fixes amplitude @xmath4 ( and thus @xmath112 ) at a constant value @xmath128 ( @xmath129 ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite for more details ) .",
    "[ footnote : satur ] ] .",
    "the value of @xmath126 is rather uncertain , but in what follows we will assume , in accordance with @xcite , that it is of the order of @xmath130 , i.e. , we take @xmath131 ( @xmath132 ) . similarly ,",
    "the oscillation amplitude @xmath4 can not _ decrease _ infinitely .",
    "the minimum value of @xmath4 is defined by some spontaneous excitation mechanism , that can be either of thermal origin or induced , e.g. , by accretion .",
    "for example , for internal temperature @xmath133 r - mode energy becomes comparable to @xmath134 ( @xmath135 is the boltzmann constant ) at the threshold value @xmath136 .",
    "this value seems to be too small to be a real lower limit for @xmath4 , thus , in what follows , we adopt @xmath137 as a fiducial value for illustration of our results .",
    "qualitatively , our main results are not sensitive to @xmath138 [ see a discussion after eq.([alpha1 ] ) and the footnote [ footnote : scaling ] ] .    strictly speaking ,",
    "the derivation of the criterion ( [ cond ] ) is valid only while @xmath139 during the whole oscillation period .",
    "when @xmath4 in the course of oscillations reaches the value of @xmath138 or @xmath126 , the above derivation is not applicable",
    ". then each @xmath4-oscillation cycle starts with the same initial condition at the left edge of the peak : it can be either @xmath140 ( in this case the star enters the instability window after the cycle starts , see point @xmath58 in fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution ] ) or @xmath128 ( in this case the star penetrates the stability region inside the peak after the cycle starts , see point @xmath141 in fig .  [ fig : evolution ] ) ; in both cases the cycle `` does not remember '' the prehistory ( initial conditions are the same for any such cycle ) . for illustration ,",
    "let us consider a cycle with the initial condition @xmath140 . in the beginning of the cycle ( point a in fig.[fig : evolution ] )",
    "the star is at the instability curve and @xmath142 [ @xmath143 , @xmath144 ( @xmath145 at the instability curve ) .",
    "if we forget for a moment about `` non - conservation '' of the energy @xmath105 during the cycle , then @xmath146 , and @xmath112 can reach its initial value @xmath147 only when @xmath148 will vanish again , that is at the instability curve ( point e in fig.[fig : evolution ] ) .",
    "the result of the energy injection into @xmath4-oscillations will be that @xmath112 will reach again the initial value @xmath147 not exactly at the instability curve , as strict energy conservation would imply , but a little bit earlier ( the r - mode amplitude wants to decrease further , hence increasing the range of @xmath112 variation , but @xmath112 is limited by @xmath147 ) .",
    "this is , however , not important for the next cycle , which again starts with @xmath142 and will be exactly the same as the previous one .",
    "a similar analysis can be carried out for the situation when @xmath149 limits the amplitude growth .",
    "notice that , anyway , satisfaction of the condition ( [ cond ] ) implies that @xmath4-oscillations are inevitable , and they will grow until they reach @xmath150 or @xmath151 .",
    "in the course of fully developed @xmath4-oscillations r mode amplitude @xmath4 varies in some range @xmath152 , with either @xmath153 ( @xmath154 ) or @xmath155 ( @xmath156 ) .",
    "typically , if @xmath126 is not too low , the former scenario is realized .",
    "let us estimate the value of @xmath157 in this case .",
    "the ` energy ' of oscillations ( [ energy ] ) in the beginning of the cycle , when @xmath142 at the instability curve , equals ( note that at that moment @xmath158 ) @xmath159 then ns penetrates the instability region where @xmath112 increases , r mode heats the star and eventually ns reaches the instability curve with the maximum ( over the period ) value of @xmath112 , given by @xmath160 . correspondingly , the energy can be written as ( again , we have @xmath145 at the instability curve ) @xmath161 as have already been discussed above , the energy of oscillations is conserved approximately on a timescale of @xmath4-oscillation period ( i.e.  dissipation / excitation of oscillations is small ) .",
    "hence one can equate equations ( [ emin ] ) and ( [ emax ] ) and get , neglecting @xmath162 in comparison to other terms , @xmath163 ( we recall that @xmath164 . ) since @xmath165 the coefficient @xmath166 depends mostly on @xmath138 and is not sensitive to , e.g. , peak and/or stellar parameters .",

    "unfortunately , up to now there are no calculations of temperature - dependent spectra of rotating superfluid nss , so currently we do not know the exact resonance temperatures @xmath220 and the widths of the stability peaks , characterized by the coupling parameter @xmath221 ( this parameter describes coupling of r modes with the superfluid inertial modes ) , see @xcite for more details . hence we will treat them as free parameters .",
    "we have some idea about the possible typical values of @xmath220 and @xmath221 from the calculations of temperature - dependent oscillation spectra of non - rotating nss ( @xcite ) .",

    "two of these peaks are those described by @xcite , see figure 6 of that reference ( one is centered at @xmath222 and is plotted for the coupling parameter @xmath223 , another is centered at @xmath224 and has @xmath225 ) , the other two are centered at @xmath226 and @xmath227 with the coupling parameters @xmath223 and @xmath225 , respectively .",

    "@xmath4-oscillations depend on the ns cooling rate , which is rather uncertain , and can be enhanced strongly by the direct urca ( durca ) processes ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most powerful of them is the neutron decay into proton and lepton ( electron or muon ) with the emission of anti - neutrino , @xmath228 ( @xmath229 stands for a lepton ) , and the corresponding inverse process , @xmath230 .",
    "however , these are the threshold processes which are forbidden at densities lower than some threshold densities .",
    "these thresholds are very sensitive to the eos , and can be rather high .",
    "for some eoss these processes are always forbidden , even for the most massive ns configurations ( see , e.g. , a recent model bsk19 by @xcite ) . on the other hand ,",
    "a majority of microscopic models predict that at a density @xmath231 ( @xmath232 is the nuclear density ) hyperons should appear ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) . in many of these models the first hyperon species to appear with growing density is @xmath233 hyperons ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "once @xmath233 hyperons appear the durca processes @xmath234 and @xmath235 become possible . although ns cooling due to these processes is slightly less efficient ( @xcite ) than in the case of nucleonic ( @xmath236 ) durca , these are _ not _ the threshold processes , and it is quite possible that they operate in nss with lower masses than @xmath236 durca processes ( but the ns mass should be sufficiently high to host @xmath233 hyperons in their cores ) .",
    "both nucleonic and @xmath233 hyperonic durcas can be suppressed by baryon ( i.e. , proton , @xmath233 hyperon , or neutron ) superfluidity whose properties are very uncertain . however , it is very probable that protons are non - superfluid at high densities ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) , while critical temperatures of @xmath233 hyperons are likely to be very low ( @xcite ) , so that @xmath233-hyperonic durca process is only weakly suppressed ( or completely unsuppressed ) .",
    "on the other hand , the neutron superfluidity still can affect @xmath236 durca . neglecting possible suppression by superfluidity ,",
    "the temperature dependence of the emission rate for both nucleonic and @xmath233 hyperonic durcas is the same , so that the emissivity due to @xmath233 hyperonic durca is equivalent to the emissivity due to @xmath236 durca from the smaller stellar volume ( namely , the radius of the central region of an ns , where durca processes operate , @xmath237 , should be smaller for @xmath236 durca by approximately a factor of @xmath238 , see appendix [ sec : appendix ] ) .",
    "thus , just to illustrate the effect of an enhanced ns cooling on the oscillations , we considered three cases : ( @xmath239 ) all durca processes are forbidden ( table [ tab : param1 ] ) ; ( @xmath240 ) unsuppressed @xmath233 hyperonic durca processes operate in the central region of an ns with the radius @xmath241 ( table [ tab : param2 ] ) ; ( @xmath242 ) the same as ( @xmath240 ) but for @xmath243 ( table [ tab : param3 ] ) . for more details on the durca processes with @xmath233 hyperons",

    "we also show the resonance temperature ( @xmath248 , in units of @xmath249 ) of the peak to which a given ns is assumed to be attached and the coupling parameter @xmath221 corresponding to a given peak ( the last two columns ) .",
    ".ns parameters . [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : param3 ]    one can see that , as was stated in the previous section , @xmath180 is indeed of the order of hours - months and is larger for low - temperature sources .",
    "this is so because of two reasons .",
    "first , @xmath180 roughly scales as @xmath250 , being thus higher by a factor of three for two low - temperature peaks which have @xmath223 . entering the expression for @xmath180 ( [ tau ] ) as @xmath251 , where @xmath252 is the mutual friction damping time of the superfluid mode . to derive this expression we used the formulas of section ivb of @xcite and considered a limiting case @xmath253 . ]",
    "another factor further increasing this difference is the fact that at higher temperatures the function @xmath254 is generally larger at comparable accretion rates , while @xmath255 . the period @xmath256 and hence behaves similarly .",
    "typical timing behaviour of an ns climbing a peak is the following .",
    "most of the time the stellar spin frequency and its derivative are not affected by the r modes and are determined by the external torque ( accretion and spin - down torques due to , e.g. , magneto - dipole losses ) .",
    "spin frequency derivatives at this stage , averaged over quiescent and active phases , @xmath257 , are presented in the fourth column of tables [ tab : param1][tab : param3 ] . to evaluate @xmath257",
    "we ( for definiteness ) neglected magneto - dipole losses and used the following simplified relation between @xmath258 and @xmath13 , valid for non - magnetized nss , @xmath259 when an ns gets into the instability region the r - mode amplitude starts to grow and soon approaches its maximum value .",
    "ns affected by r - mode torque spins down rapidly at this stage .",
    "the fifth column in the tables presents the value of the spin frequency derivative when r - mode amplitude is in its maximum , @xmath260 .",
    "this rapid spin down lasts until @xmath4 is high , that is during the period of time @xmath180 .",
    "finally , the sixth column contains the spin frequency derivative @xmath261 , averaged over the large number of @xmath4-oscillation periods .    in observations",
    "a sudden spin down due to the action of the r - mode torque , lasting the time @xmath180 , can be interpreted as an anti - glitch .",
    "the sizes of the `` anti - glitches '' can be estimated as @xmath262 ; they are presented in the seventh column of the tables .",
    "using equations ( [ wdiss ] ) , ( [ domegadt ] ) , ( [ tequil ] ) , and ( [ rough ] ) it is easy to show that @xmath263 can be expressed as @xmath264 .",
    "this formula implies that the rotation energy losses during an `` anti - glitch '' are three times larger than the energy emitted by an ns during the whole @xmath4-oscillation period , @xmath265 . as far as r - modes",
    "do not affect the spin frequency evolution in the remaining time , the average spin down rate is the same as in the absence of @xmath4-oscillations [ see equations ( [ t0temp ] ) , ( [ omega0temp ] ) and , e.g. , equation ( 2 ) of @xcite ] ; thus the main effect of @xmath4-oscillations on the timing is concentration of all r - mode spin down in narrow time intervals @xmath266 .",
    "typically , these `` anti - glitches '' are rather small ( the values from the tables lie in the interval @xmath267 ) and can contribute to the timing noise .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : spin ] we show examples of time dependencies of the r - mode amplitude @xmath4 ( top panels ) , spin frequency @xmath0 ( middle panels ) and its derivative @xmath219 ( bottom panels ) .",
    "three left panels show these functions for the pulsar 4u 1608 - 522 , assuming no durca processes operating in the star ; middle panels  for the pulsar igr j00291 - 5934 again without durcas ; right panels  for the same pulsar igr j00291 - 5934 , but with @xmath233-hyperonic durca allowed in the central region of a star with the radius @xmath243 .",
    "one can see that the pulsar 4u 1608 - 522 exhibits short periods ( several days ) of rapid spin down due to the action of the @xmath34-mode torque , which are repeated every @xmath268 .",
    "when durca processes are forbidden , every @xmath269 the pulsar igr j00291 - 5934 exhibits periods ( lasting several dozens of days ) of enhanced @xmath34-mode torque , which results in some decrease of ns spin up rate ( the torque is too weak to spin down the star ) .",
    "enhanced cooling makes the `` anti - glitches '' more pronounced and shortens the time @xmath180 of violent spin down as well as @xmath4-oscillation period , because @xmath270 [ see equations ( [ ppp ] ) and ( [ tau ] ) ] .",
    "thus , when @xmath233-hyperonic durca processes are open in the central region of a star , the pulsar igr j00291 - 5934 exhibits several days spin - down episodes with well pronounced `` anti - glitch '' .",
    "@xmath4-oscillation period in this case equals @xmath271 .",
    "one can see that @xmath4-oscillation periods obtained in numerical calculations ( and given above ) are slightly lower than those presented in the tables and calculated with the approximate formula ( [ ppp ] ) .",
    "the corresponding evolutionary tracks of the three particular ns models described here are presented in three panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : evolution2 ] .",
    "= 6.0 in    one more thing should be mentioned in relation with the tables described above . from table [",
    "tab : param3 ] it follows that the high - temperature sources , which are assumed to climb one of the two high - temperature peaks ( centered at @xmath249 and @xmath272 ) require a really high r - mode amplitude to maintain their temperature _ if _ durca processes are allowed in the substantial part of their cores",
    ". however , high values of r - mode amplitude result in the strong ns deceleration ( see the sixth column in table [ tab : param3 ] ) that could be ruled out by timing analysis ( see @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , such a strong neutrino cooling ( and hence ns deceleration ) rises a question : how did an ns get to the observed frequency ?",
    "in our scenario a star typically gets there by climbing up a stability peak . ) . ] assuming that an ns has climbed the peak up to the observed value of @xmath32 we automatically imply that the r mode braking torque was not too strong , so that a sufficiently high accretion rate ( e.g. , @xmath273 with corresponding @xmath274 ) , that probably took place in the past , could spin the star up .",
    "this assumption imposes the following `` spin up '' upper limit on @xmath169 at the stage of strong accretion , when ns was spinning up , @xmath275 where we used equation ( [ omega0temp ] ) .",
    "the value of @xmath276 is about @xmath277 for @xmath278 and scales with rotation frequency as @xmath279 [ this scaling follows from the equations ( [ taugr2 ] ) , ( [ gdef ] ) , ( [ nuacc ] ) and the fact that @xmath280 at the edge of the peak , see @xcite ) . ) that can be strongly modified by accounting for the magnetic field .",
    "] at the same time the thermal balance condition ( [ tequil ] ) dictates the value of @xmath169 .",
    "for example , if 4u 1608 - 522 was accreting at @xmath273 in the past , @xmath169 for this source was @xmath281 if @xmath243 .",
    "was slightly lower than that calculated in table [ tab : param3 ] for the current accretion rate , the same is predicted by equations ( [ f2 ] ) and ( [ tequil ] ) .",
    "however , the difference is very small , because neutrino cooling with @xmath243 is much stronger than the deep crustal heating rate even for @xmath273 ( the function @xmath282 defined by ( [ f2 ] ) and entering the thermal balance condition ( [ tequil ] ) , is practically independent of the accretion rate ) . ]",
    "thus @xmath169 was higher than @xmath276 , which means that 4u 1608 - 522 could not climb up the peak at the current cooling rate .",
    "there is , however , a possibility that durca processes were closed in the past for the pulsar 4u 1608 - 522 and had opened ( due to the mass accretion ) only after this source has climbed up the peak to a rather high frequency .",
    "only in the case of such a fine tuning one can allow the durca processes to operate in a substantial part of 4u 1608 - 522 currently .",
    "it is clear from the consideration above that detailed analysis of the hottest nss in lmxbs could put tight constraints on the neutrino emission due to durca processes in the cores of these stars .",
    "first , let us discuss whether gravitational waves can , in principle , be detected on long time scales ( involving large number of @xmath4-oscillation periods , @xmath283 ) .",
    "detection statistics respond to integrated signal power ( @xcite ) , thus to rms ( root - mean - square ) value of @xmath4 , i.e. to the quantity @xmath169 ( see section [ sec : equations ] ) . since @xmath169 is defined by approximate thermal balance of a star , equation ( [ tequil ] ) , the analysis in this case should be essentially the same as that of @xcite , where it was assumed that an ns undergoes r - mode oscillations at some ( small ) saturation amplitude and is in thermal equilibrium during these oscillations .",
    "assume that we know the frequency of gravitational waves @xmath284 , which equals to the r - mode frequency in the inertial frame , and is given , in the newtonian limit , by the formula , @xmath285 ( for @xmath27 r mode ) ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "however , direct measurements of ns spin frequency @xmath32 and frequency @xmath286 of x - ray emission modulation from the ns surface due to perturbations of the surface by r mode would allow to determine @xmath284 as @xmath287 .",

    "the registration of gravitational waves during a shorter period of time , particularly when @xmath298 , and hence @xmath291 stays near its maximum in the course of oscillations , can not improve statistics , since any collection of even weak signal contributes to the statistics [ see equation ( [ hhh ] ) ] .",
    "however , registration of the signal near the maximums of @xmath4 could substantially decrease the time cost ( or computational cost ) of the observation with the minimal losses in sensitivity .",
    "moreover , under certain conditions , the period of @xmath4-oscillations , @xmath99 , can be pretty large , up to @xmath299 years ( see the third columns in tables [ tab : param1][tab : param3 ] ) . in this case the duration of observations will be inevitably shorter than @xmath99 . then",
    ", if the period of observations is chosen properly ( its duration is of the order of @xmath180 and @xmath4 reaches its maximum during the period of observation ) , the gravitational wave can be detected if [ see equation ( [ hhh ] ) ] @xmath300 where @xmath301 is given by ( [ hhh2 ] ) with @xmath302 . to derive ( [ hhh3 ] ) we used the fact that most of the @xmath4-oscillation period @xmath4 is negligibly small and r mode excites for a time of the order of @xmath180 , and adopted an approximate equality ( [ rough ] ) .",

    "the values of @xmath304 are presented in the last column of tables [ tab : param1][tab : param3 ] .    to choose the correct time for the detection of gravitational signal we either should be sufficiently lucky or need to know @xmath4-oscillation parameters ( when exactly r - mode amplitude reaches the maximum ) .",
    "these parameters can , in principle , be found from the peculiarities in timing behavior of a given source , see section [ subsec : timing ] .",
    "since gravitational waves have not yet been detected , the only observational manifestation of @xmath4-oscillations in existing observations can be found in timing of nss .",
    "some of the nss in lmxbs are x - ray pulsars showing pulsations from time to time ( during outbursts ) . for this reason",
    "their timing parameters are poorly constrained .",
    "the best measurements of timing parameters were done for the source hete j1900.12455 ( see @xcite ) .",

    "@xcite fitted this change of @xmath219 as an exponential decay and interpreted it as a manifestation of the magnetic field burial .",
    "however , the same observational data can also be interpreted ( and fitted ) as @xmath4-oscillations discussed in this paper .",
    "unfortunately , the quality of the observational data does not allow one to distinguish which model is correct and which is not ( private communication with a.  patruno ) .",
    "additional x - ray observation of this source with high temporal resolution would be highly desirable .",
    "on the other hand , the timing behavior of millisecond radio pulsars is often measured very precisely and an upcoming projects like ska ( @xcite ; @xcite ) will increase the number of such pulsars .",
    "the scenario proposed by @xcite admits that after accretion stage finishes and an ns becomes a millisecond radio pulsar it may still stay attached to one of the stability peaks ( there are , however , other possibilities , see @xcite ) .",
    "this peak should be a low - temperature one , because observations indicate that non - accreting millisecond pulsars are relatively cool.4715 ( spin frequency @xmath306  hz ) with the redshifted surface temperature @xmath307 , corresponding to the emitting radius @xmath308  km ( @xcite ) ; even the largest estimate of the surface temperature for this pulsar corresponds to @xmath309  k , which is too low to make psr  j0437@xmath3104715 r - mode unstable . ] ns , attached to the peak , may experience @xmath4-oscillations .",
    "however , to our best knowledge , there are no known peculiarities in timing behavior of millisecond pulsars , which can be attributed to the timing features discussed here .",
    "we can not exclude that these peculiarities are masqueraded by the pulsar timing noise .",
    "the large periods of @xmath4-oscillations and small amplitudes of the accompanying `` anti - glitches '' in cold nss with low @xmath311 argue in favour of this assumption  hz , see , e.g. , @xcite ) . ] .",
    "however , if timing of all millisecond pulsars is indeed unaffected by @xmath4-oscillations , this can indicate that either ( @xmath239 ) all millisecond pulsars are stable with respect to r - modes ( for example , due to evolution in a nontrivial r - mode instability window , see , e.g. , appendix d in @xcite or due to some unknown dissipation mechanism , which makes the r - mode instability irrelevant for the physics of nss ) or ( @xmath240 ) all unstable millisecond pulsars are pinned to the stability peaks , which are sufficiently wide , so that @xmath4-oscillations do not excite for them ( see a corresponding discussion after the expression [ stability ] in section [ sec : equations ] ) .",
    "the latter assumption looks very natural , because the low - temperature peaks should be wider than the high - temperature ones , as is confirmed by calculations of the spectra of non - rotating superfluid nss ( @xcite ) .",
    "it is interesting to ask how wide should be a peak to allow an ns to climb it up / down without oscillations ?",
    "for example , to make the motion of igr j00291 - 5934 along the left edge of the stability peak stable ( i.e. , to make @xmath312 ) it is enough to increase the coupling parameter @xmath221 to the value @xmath313 ( by a factor of @xmath314 ) , which looks to be realistic ( this estimate is made for the case when durca is open in the region @xmath315 ) .    even if non - accreting millisecond pulsars are unaffected by @xmath4-oscillations , some nss in lmxbs ( accreting millisecond pulsars ) , which are attached to sharper peaks centered at higher temperatures , still can be unstable with respect to @xmath4-oscillations and",
    "thus should exhibit them . to check this possibility",
    "we need more x - ray observations with high temporal resolution that can be achieved by future missions such as loft ( @xcite ) , nicer ( @xcite ) , and srg ( @xcite ) .",
    "another opportunity to detect @xmath4-oscillations can be associated with the recently discovered transitional millisecond pulsars , which are switching between rotation- and accretion - powered states [ currently , three of such objects are known : psr  j1023@xmath3160038 ( @xmath317  hz , @xcite ) , igrj18245@xmath3102452 ( @xmath318  hz , @xcite ) , and xss  j12270@xmath3104859 ( @xmath319  hz , @xcite ) ] . in a rotation - powered state",
    "these nss are observed as radio pulsars , giving a chance to study their timing properties precisely .",
    "the accretion - powered state guaranties that these pulsars can not be too cold , and thus likely to be affected by r - mode instability and @xmath4-oscillations .",
    "for example , the red - shifted surface temperature of psr j1023@xmath3160038 can be as large as @xmath320  k ( @xcite ) .",
    "it corresponds to the internal temperature @xmath321  k , implying that psr j1023@xmath3160038 can be on the stability peak .",
    "its timing behavior was reported as ` complex ' by @xcite and can be influenced by @xmath4-oscillations .",
    "the reliable registration of @xmath4-oscillations would confirm the crucial role of the resonance interaction of oscillation modes in the evolution of nss in lmxbs ( @xcite ) .",
    "the measurements of @xmath4-oscillation parameters ( such as the period of oscillations , @xmath99 ) would provide us with a new powerful tool to constrain the properties of superdense matter .",
    "we showed that when an ns climbs the stability peak according to the scenario proposed by @xcite , its parameters can undergo _ nonlinear _ oscillations near their equilibrium values ( @xmath4-oscillations ) .",
    "we studied these oscillations analytically and determined their key parameters such as the oscillation period and amplitude .",
    "we also found a rigorous criterion showing when @xmath4-oscillations become unstable .",
    "for fully developed unstable @xmath4-oscillations we demonstrated that , most of the @xmath4-oscillation period , the amplitude of r - mode @xmath4 stays negligibly small and increases only for a short time of the order of hours - months ( depending on parameters ) by a factor of about @xmath322 in comparison to its root mean square value .",
    "thus , the spin frequency derivative , which is not affected by r modes most of the time , dramatically decreases , generally approaching large negative values , when @xmath4 becomes large .",
    "this results in small `` anti - glitches '' ( for nss in lmxbs considered here their sizes lie within the range @xmath267 for the adopted parameters ) , which typically last hours - months depending on the model . this fact can substantially affect timing analysis of rapidly rotating nss ( radio- , x - ray and transitional millisecond pulsars ) , in particular it potentially can be useful for interpretation of timing behavior of nss in lmxbs , such as hete j1900.12455 ( @xcite ) and igr j00291 - 5934 ( @xcite ) .",
    "moreover , the very existence of oscillations of the r - mode amplitude @xmath4 could substantially decrease the time cost of gravitational signal detection from lmxbs , because collection of the signal during the time period @xmath180 when @xmath4 is close to its maximum ( typically , hours - months ) results in almost the same sensitivity as collection of the signal during the whole @xmath4-oscillation period ( @xmath323 ) .",
    "the identification of @xmath4-oscillations in observations would confirm the scenario of ns evolution in lmxb proposed in @xcite and would show that r modes are crucially important for understanding of rapidly rotating nss .",
    "it would also open a new independent way to constrain the properties of superdense matter of ns cores by measuring @xmath4-oscillation parameters .",
    "to calculate the luminosity in the absence of durca processes ( let us denote it @xmath324 ) we use an approximate formula , which expresses @xmath324 as a function of the internal ( redshifted ) stellar temperature @xmath1 , see formula ( a1 ) in appendix a of @xcite .",
    "this formula fits numerical results for the luminosity obtained with the relativistic cooling code , described in detail by @xcite and @xcite . to calculate @xmath324 ,",
    "essentially the same microphysics input was used as in @xcite , namely , the parameterization by @xcite of apr eos ( @xcite ) was employed , and an ns with the mass @xmath325 was considered .",
    "it is generally believed that hyperons appear in the ns matter at densities @xmath326 , where @xmath327  g  @xmath328 is the nuclear density ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "this threshold for hyperon appearance is rather low which means that substantial fraction of nss ( probably ) host hyperons in their cores .",
    "most of the modern models predict that the first hyperons to appear with increasing density is @xmath233 hyperons ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "it is quite likely that the superfluid gap for them is very low ( @xcite ) so that @xmath233 hyperons are normal at temperatures relevant to nss in lmxbs .",
    "according to many microscopic models , protons are also non - superconducting at sufficiently high densities ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "as soon as @xmath233 hyperons appear , the very powerful direct urca process , @xmath234 , and the inverse one , @xmath235 , start to operate in the ns interiors ( here @xmath229 stands for a lepton , electron or muon ) .",
    "the corresponding neutrino emissivity was calculated by @xcite . here",
    "we present the total emissivity due to the reactions with electrons and muons and assume that it is not suppressed by the proton and/or @xmath233 hyperon superfluidity .",
    "@xmath329 where @xmath330  @xmath331 is the nuclear number density , @xmath332 is the electron number density , @xmath333 , @xmath334 , @xmath335 , and @xmath336 are the effective masses for @xmath233 hyperons and protons , respectively , @xmath337 is the mass of a free neutron . in all numerical calculations we adopt @xmath338 ( @xmath339 ) and @xmath340 .",
    "as long as the emissivity is not too sensitive to the actual value of the electron number density @xmath341 , we assume @xmath342 throughout the whole region where the durca processes are open ( it is a good approximation for the central part of a star ) .",
    "this is a typical value of @xmath341 near the threshold density of @xmath233 hyperon appearance ( @xcite ) .    using @xmath343 from the equation ( [ qq ] )",
    "we calculate ( or better to say , estimate ) the neutrino luminosity due to the @xmath233 hyperon durca processes as @xmath344 where @xmath237 is the radius of the inner part of the stellar core where @xmath233 hyperons are present ; we treat @xmath237 as a free parameter and consider three cases : @xmath345 ( no @xmath233 hyperons ) , @xmath346 , and @xmath347 . the resulting luminosity ( cooling rate ) @xmath9 is calculated as a sum of @xmath324 and @xmath348 , @xmath349 .",

    "<S> in the recent papers by @xcite a new scenario describing evolution of rapidly rotating neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries was proposed . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario accounts for a resonant interaction of normal r modes with superfluid inertial modes at some specific internal stellar temperatures ( `` resonance temperatures '' ) . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction results in an enhanced damping of r mode and appearance of the `` stability peaks '' in the temperature  spin frequency plane , which split the r - mode instability window in the vicinity of the resonance temperatures . </S>",
    "<S> the scenario suggests that the hot and rapidly rotating nss spend most of their life climbing up these peaks and , in particular , are observed there at the moment . </S>",
    "<S> we analyze in detail possible observational signatures of this suggestion . </S>",
    "<S> in particular , we show that these objects may exhibit ` anti - glitches '  sudden frequency jumps on a time scale of hours - months .    </S>",
