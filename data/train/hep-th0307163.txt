    "the casimir effect is a phenomenon common to all systems characterized by fluctuating quantities on which external boundary conditions are imposed .",
    "it may have important implications on all scales , from cosmological to subnuclear .",
    "the imposition of boundary conditions on a quantum field leads to the modification of the spectrum for the zero  point fluctuations and results in the shift in the vacuum expectation values for physical quantities such as the energy density and stresses .",
    "in particular , the confinement of quantum fluctuations causes forces that act on constraining boundaries .",
    "the particular features of the resulting vacuum forces depend on the nature of the quantum field , the type of spacetime manifold , the boundary geometries and the specific boundary conditions imposed on the field .",
    "since the original work by casimir in 1948 @xcite many theoretical and experimental works have been done on this problem ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "many different approaches have been used : mode summation method with combination of the zeta function regularization technique , green function formalism , multiple scattering expansions , heat - kernel series , etc .",
    "an interesting topic in the investigations of the casimir effect is the dependence of the vacuum characteristics on the type of the vacuum .",
    "it is well known that the uniqueness of the vacuum state is lost when we work within the framework of quantum field theory in a general curved spacetime or in non  inertial frames . in particular , the use of general coordinate transformations in quantum field theory in flat spacetime leads to an infinite number of unitary inequivalent representations of the commutation relations .",
    "different inequivalent representations will in general give rise to different pictures with different physical implications , in particular to different vacuum states .",
    "for instance , the vacuum state for an uniformly accelerated observer , the fulling ",
    "rindler vacuum @xcite , turns out to be inequivalent to that for an inertial observer , the familiar minkowski vacuum ( for a mathematical discussion by means of a normal mode analysis see ref .",
    "quantum field theory in accelerated systems contains many special features produced by a gravitational field .",
    "this fact allows one to avoid some of the difficulties entailed by renormalization in a curved spacetime .",
    "in particular , the near horizon geometry of most black holes is well approximated by rindler and a better understanding of physical effects in this background could serve as a handle to deal with more complicated geometries like schwarzschild .",
    "the rindler geometry shares most of the qualitative features of black holes and is simple enough to allow detailed analysis .",
    "another motivation for the investigation of quantum effects in the rindler space is related to the fact that this space is conformally related to the de sitter space and to the robertson  walker space with negative spatial curvature .",
    "as a result the expectation values of the energy  momentum tensor for a conformally invariant field and for corresponding conformally transformed boundaries on the de sitter and robertson  walker backgrounds can be derived from the corresponding rindler counterpart by the standard transformation ( see , for instance , @xcite ) .",
    "the problem of vacuum polarization brought about by the presence of an infinite plane boundary moving with uniform acceleration through the fulling - rindler vacuum was investigated by candelas and deutsch @xcite for the conformally coupled @xmath1 dirichlet and neumann massless scalar and electromagnetic fields . in this paper only the region of the right rindler wedge to the right of the barrier",
    "is considered . in ref .",
    "@xcite we have investigated the wightman function and the vacuum expectation values of the energy momentum - tensor for the massive scalar field with general curvature coupling parameter , satisfying the robin boundary conditions on the infinite plane in an arbitrary number of spacetime dimensions and for the electromagnetic field . unlike ref .",
    "@xcite we have considered both regions , including the one between the barrier and rindler horizon .",
    "the vacuum expectation values of the energy - momentum tensors for scalar and electromagnetic fields for the geometry of two parallel plates moving by uniform acceleration are investigated in ref .",
    "in particular , the vacuum forces acting on the boundaries are evaluated .",
    "they are presented as a sum of the interaction and self - action parts .",
    "the interaction forces between the plates are always attractive for both scalar and electromagnetic cases .",
    "the self - action forces contain well - known surface divergencies and needs further regularization . in refs .",
    "@xcite the mode summation method is used in combination with the generalized abel - plana summation formula @xcite .",
    "this allowed us to present the vacuum expectation values in the terms of the purely rindler and boundary parts .",
    "due to the well known non - integrable surface divergences in the boundary parts , the total casimir energy can not be obtained by direct integration of the vacuum energy density and needs an additional regularization .",
    "many regularization techniques are available nowadays and , depending on the specific physical problem under consideration , one of them may be more suitable than the others . in particular , the generalized zeta function method @xcite is in general very powerful to give physical meaning to the divergent quantities .",
    "there are several examples of the application of this method to the evaluation of the casimir effect ( see , for instance , @xcite ) . in this paper , by using the zeta function technique , we consider the casimir energy for the geometries of a single and two parallel plates , moving by uniform proper acceleration through the fulling - rindler vacuum .    the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "( [ fieldeq ] ) we have @xmath12 . as a result the eigenmodes are independent of the curvature coupling parameter and , hence , the casimir energy will not depend on this parameter .",

    "for the scalar case both dirichlet and neumann boundary conditions are investigated . in the case of a single plate geometry",
