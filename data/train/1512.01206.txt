    "optimal control problems with infinite horizon play an important role in economic theory .",

    "the authors determine the adjoint variable uniqly by a cauchy - tipe formula .",
    "this formula is equivalent to the transversality conditions in the following form @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the fundamental matrix of the state equation linearized about the optimal solution .    due to their limitations",
    "all aforementioned transversality conditions fail to select the optimal solution of ramsey problem without discounting , @xcite , where we consider diverging objective functional .",

    "condition ( [ eq : tckav ] ) fail because it is proved for problems without state constraints , while ramsey requires the state variable ( capital ) to be not negative for all time instances .",
