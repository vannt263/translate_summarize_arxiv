    "thus , the spectrum is in this case typically made up of a fairly flat band mixed together with  parabolic \" energy bands .",
    "when @xmath65 dominates @xmath66 , the situation is different and mixing of flat and  parabolic \" bands does not exist .",

    "this numerical procedure gives a good approximation for the ground state .",
    "another important point is that since the ground state ( for a non - interacting system ) is degenerate , the imaginary time evolution renders different states depending on the ansatz ( [ ansatz ] ) .",
    "in particular , since for the state of our assumption all population resides in the @xmath22 state and the momentum is centered around the origin , the ground state obtained from ( [ gs ] ) will mainly populate states spanned by @xmath44 .",
