    "from a modern perspective there are two main approaches to the modelling of interest rates .",
    "these are the  volatility approach \" and the  pricing kernel approach \" .",
    "both have been investigated extensively in the case of a brownian filtration , but rather less so in the general situation when bond prices are allowed to jump .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to present some new term structure models admitting , jumps based on parametric families of geometric lvy martingales ; but in doing so we shall take the opportunity to make some observations about the present state of interest rate modelling , both in the brownian setting and the more general lvy - ito setting .",
    "the volatility approach , in the case of a brownian market filtration , is at present perhaps the most important and widely implemented interest rate modelling methodology , and it is the best understood .",
    "the celebrated hjm framework ( heath _ et al_.  1992 ) belongs to this category , as does also the so - called libor market model in its various manifestations ( see e.g. rebonato 2002 , musiela & rutkowski 2005 , and references cited therein ) , and a number of the  classical \" short - rate models can be reformulated in this way as well . the volatility approach thus deserves special attention .",
    "we shall discuss the brownian case first , and then its rather less well understood extension to the jump category .",
    "the setup is as follows .",
    "the discount bond volatility , the market price of risk , and the initial yield curve , constitute the  primitive data \" of the model .",
    "we have a probability space @xmath0 equipped with the augmented filtration @xmath1 associated with a brownian motion @xmath2 of one or more dimensions . here and in what follows @xmath3",
    "denotes the `` physical '' measure ; most of the discussion will focus on @xmath3 rather than on alternative measures .",
    "the interest rate markets are represented by a system of unit - principal discount bonds @xmath4 and a unit - initialised money - market account @xmath5 satisfying a system of dynamical equations of the following form : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the random value at time @xmath8 of the bond that matures at time @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the short rate , @xmath11 is the bond volatility , and @xmath12 is the market price of risk . in the multi - dimensional setting ,",
    "@xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 are vector - valued processes , and in equation ( 1 ) there is an implied  dot product \" between @xmath13 and @xmath16 , and also between @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "we shall assume that the family of processes @xmath19 is differentiable with respect to @xmath9 in a suitable sense .",
    "we also assume that the family of processes @xmath13 is differentiable with respect to @xmath9 in a suitable sense , and that for any fixed @xmath9 it holds that @xmath20 . for some versions of the theory ( such as the original formulation of hjm )",
    "one imposes a finite time horizon over which the model is defined ; whereas for other versions the time horizon is infinite .",
    "we mostly consider the latter case here , and we assume that @xmath21 .    given the initial bond prices @xmath22 , we find , under suitable conditions , that the solution for the discount bond system is @xmath23 and that for the money - market account we have @xmath24 we require , in particular , that the conditions @xmath25 hold almost surely for all @xmath26 . if we set @xmath27 for all @xmath28 , we can invert equation ( [ eq:3 ] ) to obtain @xmath29 for the short rate @xmath30 we then have @xmath31 where @xmath32 denotes differentiation with respect to @xmath8 .",
    "putting these ingredients together we are led to the following expression for the bond prices : @xmath33 here @xmath34 denotes the @xmath8-forward price made at time @xmath35 for a @xmath9-maturity bond .",
    "we see that @xmath36 and @xmath19 are determined by the specification of the volatility @xmath13 , the market price of risk @xmath14 , and the initial bond prices @xmath37 .",
    "this is the sense in which these are the primitive data of the model . in particular",
    ", there is no need to model the short rate as such separately  it is a  derived \" quantity in the volatility approach .",
    "two further conditions are required , namely , that the processes @xmath38 and @xmath39 defined by @xmath40 for @xmath41 , and @xmath42 for @xmath43 , are martingales ( rather than merely local martingales ) .",
    "these conditions are needed if we are to make economic sense of the models and to put them into practice .",
    "but how do we put the volatility approach into practice ?",
    "as long as we are primarily interested in pricing and hedging , but less so ( at least from a modelling perspective ) in portfolio allocation , scenario analysis , and forecasting , then a transformation to the risk - neutral measure @xmath44 has the effect of removing the market price of risk from the equations ; and the problem of modelling the evolution of the term structure of interest rates is transformed into the problem of modelling @xmath13 under @xmath44 . in the methodology that has been adapted by practitioners",
    "the idea is that we specify @xmath13 exogenously , under @xmath44 or under an appropriate set of forward measures , up to some overall parametric or functional freedom .",
    "this freedom is used to calibrate the model to the prices of derivatives , typically interest rate caps and swaptions .",
    "the general line of attack outlined above has in one form or another been widely implemented by financial institutions , and has been in use for more than two decades .",
    "the volatility approach does nevertheless suffer from various defects , conceptual and practical , and it is reasonable to ask if one can do better .",
    "we shall not attempt a detailed critique here , but the following points can be made .",
    "one problem with the volatility approach is that it is difficult to impose a transparent condition on the discount bond volatility structure that ensures interest rate positivity ( see , e.g. , brody & hughston 2002 ) .",
    "there is no clear economic motivation for choosing one volatility structure over another , and the fact that the volatility is modelled in the risk - neutral measure ( or some other  unnatural \" measure ) further removes the model from economic reality . in this respect",
    "the elimination of the market price of risk is ultimately a shortcoming rather than a virtue .",
    "originally it was thought that ( following the triumph of the black - scholes formula ) the lack of any need to model the actual returns of bonds was a  good thing \" .",
    "the argument was that market volatilities could be inferred from option prices , whereas market returns could not , and therefore it would save a lot of trouble if one could avoid having to model the latter .",
    "but those were the days in which  derivative risk management \" was mostly about pricing and hedging .",
    "the industry is wiser now , and there is a general perception to the effect that  buy side \" concerns , which have always been somewhat less well - developed mathematically , involving the aforementioned issues of portfolio allocation , scenario analysis , and forecasting , are just as relevant to the  sell side \" as they are to their colleagues on the other side of the chinese wall .",
    "this argues for the reinstatement of @xmath45 and the abolition of @xmath44 .",
    "an alternative to the volatility approach is to base the theory on pricing kernels .",
    "the pricing kernel method allows for interest rate positivity , and it generalises readily to models not based on brownian motion .",
    "the connection with economic thinking is clearer , and the extension to other asset classes ( such as foreign exchange or inflation - linked products ) is cleaner .",
    "the method is rooted in @xmath45 , so that although the use of other measures arises naturally enough in the course of various specific calculations there is no temptation to model  in the risk neutral measure \" from the outset , a short cut that has often been taken in industry implementations in the past , but is in the final analysis limiting .",
    "it follows also that @xmath14 is present all along in the pricing kernel approach as part of the modelling framework , and is not swept underneath a @xmath44-rug .",
    "the idea is as follows .",
    "we assume the absence of arbitrage opportunities , but not market completeness .",
    "the filtration @xmath46 , which we take to satisfy the  usual conditions \" ,",
    "need not be brownian , so jumps can be accommodated .",
    "asset price processes have the cdlg property .",
    "we assume the existence of an established pricing kernel @xmath47 satisfying @xmath48 almost surely for @xmath49 , and such that for any asset with price process @xmath50 and cumulative dividend process @xmath51 , the associated  deflated \" or  discounted , risk - adjusted \" price process @xmath52 defined by @xmath53 is a @xmath54-martingale .",
    "thus if @xmath50 represents the price of an asset that pays no dividend , then @xmath55 is a martingale .",
    "if an asset delivers a single random cash flow @xmath56 at @xmath9 , and derives its value from that cash flow , then its value at @xmath57 is @xmath58 .\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in the case of a discount bond , which generates a cash flow of unity at @xmath9 , we have @xmath59\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath57 .",
    "it follows that we can use the pricing kernel as a basis for interest rate modelling .",
    "in particular , if we model @xmath60 parametrically , then we can generate families of bond price processes , and use the resulting freedom to calibrate the model to the prices of select market instruments , as in the volatility approach .    according to ushbayev ( 2011 ) ,",
    "the notion of a  pricing kernel \" dates back to the 1970s , and is used for example in ross ( 1978 ) , who has apparently modified the term  market kernel \" used by garman ( 1976 ) .",
    "authors have employed a variety of terms for essentially the same concept .",
    "economists often speak of the  marginal rate of substitution \" .",
    "the term  state price density \" appears in dothan & williams ( 1978 ) .",
    "one finds the term ",
    "stochastic discount factor \" in cox & martin ( 1983 ) , whereas the term  state price deflator \" is used by duffie ( 1992 ) .",
    "the idea of using the pricing kernel as a basis for interest rate modelling appears rather explicitly in constantinides ( 1992 ) .",
    "the following brief excerpt from this reference is indicative of the point of view proposed therein ( we have changed his notation slightly to conform with ours ) :  we assert the existence of a positive state - price density or pricing kernel @xmath60 such that the nominal price at time @xmath8 of a claim to a nominal payoff @xmath56 at some future date @xmath9 is given by [ our equation ] ( [ bond price ] ) , where @xmath61 $ ] denotes the expectation conditional on the information at time @xmath8 . the @xmath62 approach taken here is to explore directly the time - series process of @xmath60 , which yields plausible implications about the term structure of interest rates .",
    "i stress that in this @xmath63 approach it is unnecessary to assume a representative consumer economy in which the consumer has von neumann - morgenstern preferences . \"",
    "there are several different but more or less equivalent ways of representing the structure of the pricing kernel .",
    "perhaps the most straightforward is to regard the short rate and the market price of risk as being the primitive data , and write the pricing kernel in the form @xmath64 this line of attack works particularly well in the case of the  classical \" short rate models , such as those of vasicek ( 1977 ) and cox _ et al . _",
    "( 1985 ) , where one typically starts with an ansatz for the interest rate and the market price of risk . then one can deduce the bond prices by use of ( [ bond price ] ) , and the prices of derivatives based on bond prices ( i.e.  interest rate derivatives ) by use of ( [ pricing formula ] ) .",
    "the difficulty of this approach is that from an economic perspective it is unnatural to model the interest rate and market risk aversion processes  separately \" . in economic analysis ,",
    "these typically go hand in hand .",
    "furthermore , the initial term structure is buried away in the specification of the primitive date , and there is no obvious prescription for calibrating the model , so one has to proceed on a case by case basis .",
    "indeed , this is just what practitioners did before the advent of the hjm method .",
    "we are thus led to ask the following question : do we actually lose anything by adopting the pricing kernel method , as opposed to the volatility method ? in a brownian setting",
    "the answer is no .",
    "in fact , the pricing kernel itself can be expressed in terms of the volatility @xmath13 , the market price of risk @xmath14 , and the initial bond prices @xmath37 , as follows : @xmath65 this can be proved if , making use of ( [ money market account ] ) , one inserts ( [ eq:4 ] ) into ( [ pricing kernel formula ] ) and simplifies the result ( see jin & glasserman 2001 and tsujimoto 2010 ) .",
    "thus , any brownian  volatility model \" can be converted into a  pricing kernel model \" and vice - versa .",
    "more precisely , we can regard @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath37 as being specified up to some overall parametric freedom , thus inducing a corresponding parametrisation of the pricing kernel , which can then be calibrated to market data and/or market forecasts by various schemes .",
    "the upshot of this is that the various  approaches \" to modelling interest rates amount to different ways of representing the pricing kernel , such as the formulae given by ( [ pricing kernel formula ] ) and ( [ pricing kernel formula 2 ] ) , which in turn suggest various distinct way of parameterising the resulting models .",
    "we shall , in what follows , consider yet another representation of the pricing kernel , namely that associated with the so - called flesaker - hughston ( fh ) models . in this representation",
    "( flesaker & hughston 1996 , 1997 , 1998 ) the pricing kernel takes the form @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a family of positive unit - initialised martingales .",
    "thus , we require that @xmath68 for @xmath69 , that @xmath70 for @xmath71 , and that @xmath72=m_{ts}$ ] for @xmath73 .",
    "it follows from the assumed asymptotic property of the initial term structure , without further restriction on the martingale family , that the right side of ( [ pk ] ) is finite almost surely .",
    "in particular , by use of the fubini theorem , the martingale property , and the fundamental theorem of calculus , one finds that @xmath74=p_{0 t } $ ] . as a consequence of equation ( [ bond price ] )",
    "we deduce that the discount bond system takes the rational form @xmath75 to model the interest rate system we thus need to specify the initial term structure @xmath37 together with a family of positive martingales .",
    "the fh model originated as an attempt to characterise the complete family of hjm - type models with positive interest rates and valid over an arbitrary time horizon .",
    "the work was presented at the cornell / queen s university derivative securities conference organised by r.  jarrow and s.  turnbull in april 1995 ( cf .",
    "hughston 2003 ) .",
    "a generalised version of the model was presented by rutkowski ( 1997 ) , and it was made clear in this later work that the model was not tied to the use of a brownian filtration . in the words of rutkowski ( 1997 ) :  from a theoretical viewpoint , the basic input of the generalised flesaker - hughston model is a strictly positive supermartingale  \" .",
    "the relation of the fh models to the hjm theory and other approaches has been discussed in detail by a number of authors , including jin & glasserman ( 2001 ) , cairns ( 2004 ) , hunt & kennedy ( 2004 ) , musiela & rutkowski ( 2005 ) , and bjork ( 2009 ) .",
    "other representations of the pricing kernel method that offer interesting insights include the use of potentials ( rogers 1997 ) , and wiener chaos ( brody & hughston 2004 , hughston & rafailidis 2005 ) ; these will not be considered here .",
    "we return to the fh representation in the context of lvy models .",
    "one important deficiency of the volatility approach to interest rate modelling is that in its more successful implementations it has been so deeply intertwined with brownian motion based modelling techniques that little by way of consensus has emerged either in the industry or among academics on how best to incorporate jumps into the scheme .",
    "this being the case , it will not be amiss here to attempt to make some progress on the matter .",
    "the theory of lvy models for asset pricing has an extensive literature .",
    "we refer the reader , for example , to madan & senata ( 1990 ) , madan & milne ( 1991 ) , heston ( 1993 ) , gerber & shiu ( 1994 ) , eberlein & keller ( 1995 ) , eberlein & jacod ( 1997 ) , chan ( 1999 ) , kallsen & shiryaev ( 2002 ) , fujiwara & miyahara ( 2003 ) , schoutens ( 2003 ) , cont & tankov ( 2004 ) , esche & schweizer ( 2005 ) , hubalek & sgarra ( 2006 ) , and references cited therein . by a lvy process on a probability space @xmath76",
    "we mean a process @xmath77 such that @xmath78 , @xmath79 is independent of @xmath80 for @xmath81 , and @xmath82 for @xmath83 . here",
    "@xmath84 denotes the augmented filtration generated by @xmath77 . for @xmath77 to give rise to a lvy model for asset prices",
    ", we require that it should possess exponential moments ; that is , @xmath85 < \\infty   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath86 , for @xmath87 in some connected real interval @xmath88 containing the origin .",
    "the stationary and independent increments property implies that there exists a lvy exponent @xmath89 such that @xmath85 = { \\mbox{$\\rm e$}}^{t\\psi(\\alpha ) } \\label{cumulant}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath90 .",
    "then the process defined by @xmath91 is a martingale , called the associated geometric lvy martingale ( or esscher martingale ) , with parameter @xmath87 .",
    "more generally , let @xmath92 be an @xmath84predictable process , chosen in such a way that @xmath93 for @xmath49 , and such that the local martingale defined by @xmath94 is a martingale . if a predictable process @xmath92 satisfies these conditions then we say it is admissible .",
    "then we are led to consider an asset pricing model of the following form .",
    "let the exogenously specified short rate @xmath95 be @xmath84adapted , and be such that the unit - initialised money market account defined as in ( [ money market account ] ) is finite almost surely for @xmath26 .",
    "let the @xmath84-adapted risk aversion and volatility processes @xmath14 and @xmath96 be positive , and be such that @xmath97 , @xmath96 , and @xmath98 are admissible in the sense noted above .",
    "the pricing kernel is taken to be given by @xmath99 and the associated expression for the price of a typical non - dividend - paying asset is @xmath100 where @xmath101 is the excess rate of return function associated with the given lvy exponent .",
    "it is a remarkable property of the function @xmath102 , arising as a consequence of the convexity of the lvy exponent , that if the volatility and the risk aversion are positive , then the excess rate of return is positive , and is monotonically increasing in its arguments ( brody _ et al . _  2011 ) . in general the excess rate of return is nonlinear , and hence in a general lvy setting the process @xmath14 no longer admits the interpretation of being the market price of risk , but instead should be viewed as a measure of investor risk aversion .",
    "the theory of interest rates can be developed in just this spirit in a way that generalises the hjm framework to the lvy category .",
    "in particular , we are able to give a consistent treatment of the risk premium associated with interest rate products in such a way that the risk premium is positive for bonds .",
    "interest rate models admitting jumps have been pursued by a number of authors , including , _",
    "inter alia _ , shirakawa ( 1991 ) , jarrow & madan ( 1995 ) , bjrk _ et al_. ( 1997 ) , bjrk _ et al_. ( 1997 ) ,",

    "eberlein & kluge ( 2006a , b , 2007 ) , and filipovi _ et al_. ( 2010 ) , to mention a few .",
    "our approach is novel inasmuch as we introduce a pricing kernel at the outset , rather than attempting to model the interest rate system through a set of dynamical equations . a rather general class of lvy interest rate models exhibiting the positive excess rate of return property",
    "can thus be constructed as follows .",
    "the idea is to model the pricing kernel and the associated discount bond system .",
    "there is no need to introduce a system of instantaneous forward rates .",
    "let the pricing kernel be given by ( [ general pricing kernel ] ) , and write @xmath7 for the price at @xmath8 of a bond that matures at @xmath9 to deliver one unit of currency .",
    "for the lvy discount bond model we have : @xmath103 we require ( a ) that @xmath14 and @xmath13 are positive , ( b ) that @xmath97 , @xmath13 , and @xmath104 , are admissible in the sense indicated above , and ( c ) that @xmath13 should vanish as @xmath8 approaches @xmath9 . the maturity condition @xmath105",

    "if we substitute the expression for the money market account back into equation ( [ general pricing kernel ] ) , and simplify the result , we deduce the following :    [ prop:0 ] the pricing kernel in a lvy interest rate model can be expressed in terms of the initial term structure @xmath37 , the bond volatility @xmath13 , and the risk aversion @xmath14 as : @xmath108    this result offers one a rather general method for modelling an arbitrage - free interest rate system in the physical measure when there are jumps . in particular ,",
    "if we model the volatility structure and the risk aversion exogenously , and specify the initial term structure , then we determine the pricing kernel , the discount bond system , and the money market account . in practice , as in the brownian case , the volatility structure and the risk aversion process can be modelled parametrically , up to some undetermined functional degrees of freedom , to be fixed by calibration to the prices of market instruments at time zero .",
    "indeed , one could treat the lvy exponent itself as part of the  functional freedom \" of the model .",
    "one can also consider an extension of the fh models to the lvy category as a basis for representing the pricing kernel .",
    "we shall construct the required martingale families from the esscher martingales associated with various lvy processes .",
    "thus we fix a probability space @xmath109 and a lvy process @xmath110 admitting exponential moments as before , and for a suitable deterministic function @xmath111 we define a martingale family @xmath112 by setting @xmath113}.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] we note that @xmath70 and @xmath68 .",
