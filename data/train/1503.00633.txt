    "motor proteins or molecular motors are enzymatic molecules that actively participate in all major biological processes such as cellular transport , cell division , transfer of genetic information , synthesis of proteins , cell motility and signaling @xcite .",
    "they transform chemical energy from specific reactions that they catalyze ( usually , hydrolysis or biopolymerization ) into mechanical work to support their functions .",
    "for example , the directed motion along linear cytoskeleton filaments by kinesin , myosin and dynein motor proteins is fueled by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) @xcite .",
    "biological molecular motors have been intensively studied in recent years , and currently the single - molecule dynamics of motor proteins is well described @xcite .",
    "although the properties of individual molecules are very useful , in biological systems motor proteins typically function in large teams .",
    "this underlines the importance of understanding the collective behavior of molecular motors @xcite .",
    "experimental studies of kinesin motor proteins moving along microtubules indicate that these molecular motors interact with each @xcite . it was argued that these interactions most probably are short - range and relatively weak attractive ( @xmath0 ) @xcite .",
    "it is reasonable to assume that many other motor proteins have similar properties . at microscopic level",
    ", molecular motors are involved in a variety of chemical transitions such as binding to the filament , chemical transformations during the hydrolysis , dissociation from the track @xcite .",
    "intermolecular interactions influence all these processes , suggesting an important role for interactions in the collective behavior of molecular motors . however , the underlying mechanisms are still not well clarified @xcite .",
    "existing theoretical studies of cooperative dynamics in interacting molecular motors are mostly phenomenological without quantitative description of relevant chemical processes @xcite .",
    "recently , we introduced a new theoretical approach for analyzing collective properties of interacting molecular motors @xcite .",
    "it is based on using a class of non - equilibrium models called totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes ( tasep ) , which are very powerful for studying multi - particle dynamic phenomena @xcite .",
    "there are many processes in chemistry , physics and biology that have been successfully analyzed by utilizing the asymmetric exclusion processes @xcite .",
    "taseps were also employed before for investigating dynamic properties of motor proteins @xcite , including interacting molecular motors @xcite .",
    "but the main advantage of our method is a procedure that describes all chemical transitions at the single - molecule level using fundamental thermodynamic concepts @xcite .",
    "this allows us to properly couple microscopic properties of interacting molecular motors with their collective dynamic behavior .    analyzing this theoretical approach",
    ", it was found that there is an optimal interaction strength ( weakly repulsive ) that can maximize the current through the system @xcite .",
    "in addition , the calculations suggested that correlations play important role in dynamics of interacting molecular motors .",
    "however , the progress in understanding the cooperativity in motor proteins in this model was limited by the following issues .",
    "two mean - field analytical treatments were proposed .",
    "but the first one , a simple mean - field approach ( smf ) , failed completely , as compared with extensive monte carlo computer simulations , producing unphysical trends in dynamic properties for strong interactions .",
    "the second approach , a cluster mean - field ( cmf ) , worked better , but it involved very heavy numerical calculations . at the end",
    ", cmf was able to reproduce only qualitatively dynamics of interacting molecular motors and not even for all ranges of parameters .",
    "furthermore , only symmetric splitting of interactions on hopping rates was considered .",
    "in addition , it was not possible to extend cmf to take into account more realistic features of motor protein s transport such as backward steps , bindings and unbindings from the filament , and more general symmetries of the interactions . to understand the mechanisms of cooperativity , it is important to have an analytical method that can successfully capture main features of interacting molecular motors , and which can be also extended to more complex situations .    in this paper , a new theoretical framework for analyzing complex dynamics of interacting molecular motors via tasep is presented .",
    "we develop a modified cluster mean - field ( mcmf ) approach that accounts for some correlations in the system .",
    "this provides a direct way of analytically calculating all dynamic properties in the system , and the results agree quite well with computer simulations .",
    "the method allows us to explicitly analyze the role of interactions in dynamics of interacting molecular motors .",
    "more specifically , it is found that correlations are weaker and more short - range for repulsive interactions while for attractions they are stronger and more long - range .",
    "we also investigate the role of the symmetry of interactions and show that it might dramatically modify the dynamic behavior . but most importantly , the developed framework allows us to understand the microscopic origin of dynamic phenomena in motor proteins and it can be easily generalized to account for more complex processes associated with molecular motors .",
    "in our model , the transport of molecular motors along linear filaments is viewed as a motion of multiple particles on a lattice with @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) sites , as shown in fig .",

    "each lattice site can accommodate only one particle .",
    "in addition to exclusions , molecular motors can interact with each other via a short - range potential . here",
    "we assume that any two neighboring particles interact with each other with an energy @xmath9 .",
    "the case of positive @xmath9 defines attractive interactions , while @xmath10 corresponds to repulsions . in other words ,",
    "any bond connecting two neighboring particles on the lattice is associated with the energy @xmath9 . in our system transition rates",

    "any forward motion of the individual molecular motor that does not change the number of bonds is taking place with the rate 1 .",
    "it can be done by a single molecule that do not have any neighbors ( see fig .",
    "1 ) , or it can involve breaking one bond and creating another one ( fig .",
    "1 ) . in both cases ,",

    ", the molecular motor joins an existing cluster of particles : see fig .",
    "1 . similarly , the transition that is coupled with breaking the bond has a rate @xmath12 . here",
    "the particle dissociates from the cluster but simultaneously it does not bind to another cluster ( fig .",
    "1 ) . the transition rates @xmath13 and @xmath14 are associated with changes in energy .",
    "it has been argued that creating and breaking such bonds ( or pairs of particles ) can be viewed as opposing chemical transitions , which justifies the application of the detailed balance arguments @xcite .",
    "this leads to the following relation between the transitions rates , @xmath15 to evaluate dynamic properties of molecular motors we need to know the explicit values for rates @xmath13 and @xmath14 . the interaction energy can be split in the following way , @xmath16 where a dimensionless parameter @xmath17 ( @xmath18 ) specifies how the energy affects these transition rates .",

    " it is faster to break the particle cluster ( @xmath23 ) than to increase the cluster size ( @xmath24 ) . in the case of no interactions ( @xmath25 )",
    "these transitions rates are the same ( @xmath26 ) and the model reduces to standard tasep with only hard - core exclusions .        in our model",
    ", particles enter the system from the left side of the lattice and they leave the system from the right side of the lattice : see fig .",
    "1 . interactions are also modifying the entrance and exit rates in comparison with the original tasep model .",
    "when entering the system does not lead to creating a pair of particles the rate for this process is @xmath27 ( fig .",
    "1 ) . however ,",
    "entering with creating the bond has a rate @xmath28 .",
    "similarly , the exit rate for the case when no bond breaking is involved is equal to @xmath29 , while the dissociating from the cluster is taking place with the rate @xmath30 ( fig .",
    "previous theoretical studies indicated that correlations are important for the system with multiple particles @xcite .",
    "neglecting correlations leads to unphysical behavior for strong interactions between molecular motors @xcite .",
    "this indicates that any successful theoretical treatment must take correlations into account .",
    "this is the main idea of our approach that we call a _ modified cluster mean - field_.    to account for correlations we analyze bulk clusters of two neighboring sites on the lattice .",
    "each cluster can be found in one of four possible states .",
    "we label a configuration with 2 empty sites as @xmath31 , with two occupied sites as @xmath32 , and two half - occupied clusters are labeled as @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "next , we introduce functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 as probabilities of finding the configurations @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath31 , respectively .",
    "the conservation of probability for these functions requires that @xmath39 in addition , we have @xmath40 where @xmath41 is the bulk density ( or the probability to find the particle at given site ) . here",

    "the third factor ( @xmath48 ) is a probability to have the last site empty .",
    "if we have the configuration @xmath33 in the middle cluster then the last site can be found in one of two states : it can be occupied with the probability @xmath41 or it can be empty with the probability @xmath38 .",
    "this is because in this case the cluster consisting of the sites 3 and 4 can only be found in configurations @xmath31 or @xmath34 .",
    "then the particle current from the second configuration ( fig .",

    "previous theoretical studies suggested that kinesins function at the conditions that do support the maximal current , but the analysis was based on the symmetric splitting of interactions for transitions rates ( @xmath90 ) @xcite .",
    "our new results presented in figs . 4 and 6 indicate that this is probably a reasonable description of multi - particle dynamics of kinesins for for most interaction splittings ( @xmath138 ) . in this case",
    "the kinesin might operate at the conditions where small changes in interactions lead to large modification in the particle dynamics .",
    "it has been argued that this might be important for maintaining robust cellular transport @xcite .",
    "however , our results ( fig .",
    "6 ) also suggest another intriguing possibility that the kinesin fluxes might be optimized if the splitting affects more the formation of particle clusters ( @xmath139 ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 is a microscopic property that can not be obtained from our mesoscopic theoretical method . to test this idea",
    "it will be important to measure and calculate this quantity in more advanced experimental and theoretical investigations .",
    "we developed a new theoretical approach to analyze the role of intermolecular interactions in the collective dynamics of molecular motors that move along linear filaments .",
    "our method is based on utilizing totally asymmetric exclusion processes , which have been successfully applied for studying various processes in chemistry , physics and biology .",
    "it modifies the transition rates by interactions via fundamental thermodynamic arguments . a simple theoretical framework , that we call the modified cluster mean - field and that takes into account some correlations , is presented and fully discussed .",
    "it allows us to calculate analytically or numerically exactly all dynamic properties of interacting molecular motors .",
    "we find that interactions induce correlations in the system of collectively moving motor proteins , and the strength of correlations depends on the sign of the interactions .",
    "it was argued that for repulsions the correlations are short - range and relatively weak , while for attractions the range and amplitude of correlations are larger .",
    "this also leads to different dynamic behavior of interacting molecular motors . for repulsions the dynamics",
    "is weakly affected by the strength of interactions , however for attractions the dynamics is modified much stronger .",
    "we also investigated the effect of the symmetry of interaction by analyzing splittings between different transitions .",
    "it was found that when the formation of particle clusters is weakly affected by interactions the most optimal fluxes can be realized for weakly repulsive interaction .",
    "but when breaking of bonds between neighboring particles is strongly influenced , the maximal current can be achieved for attractive interactions .",
    "furthermore , the importance of these results for kinesin motor proteins has been discussed .",
    "the most important advantage of our method is that it can be easily extended to investigate additional more realistic features of molecular motors transport such as backward steps , binding and unbinding of motor proteins at all sites , multiple parallel pathways and limited resources of motor proteins in the surrounding solution",
    ". it will be very interesting to generalize our approach to study these phenomena if we want to understand better mechanisms of cellular transport processes .",
    "however , despite its simplicity and the successful application for the interacting molecular motors , it should be noted that our method is still approximate and many important features are not well described . for example , for a large range of parameters the effect of attractive interactions",
    "is given only qualitatively .",
    "thus it will be important to test our theory in experiments and in more advanced theoretical models .",
    "the work was supported by grants from the welch foundation ( c-1559 ) , from the nsf ( grant che-1360979 ) , and by the center for theoretical biological physics sponsored by the nsf ( grant phy-142765 ) ."
