    "for more than a decade , the young star tw hya has been an enigma since it lies in a region of sky apparently devoid of the raw materials to form stars , nearly 13@xmath3 from the nearest dark cloud , yet it is unambiguously a classical t tauri star ( @xcite ) surrounded by a great deal of cold dust ( @xcite ) and gas ( @xcite ) .",
    "recently , the tw hya mystery was solved : tw hya , along with other t tauri stars found in an area of @xmath4100 square degrees of the southern sky ( @xcite ) , compose a uniquely close association of young stars known as the tw hya association ( @xcite ) .    at a mean distance of only @xmath455 pc , the tw hya association ( hereafter twa )",
    "is almost three times closer than the next nearest known region of recent star formation . given the likely age ( @xmath410 my ) of the twa , these stars could harbor very young planetary systems with fully formed giant planets or low mass , brown dwarf companions , and may still be surrounding by circumstellar disks .",
    "in fact , there is substantial evidence for circumstellar gas and dust around several of these stars ( @xcite ) . the relative proximity and the absence of significant interstellar or intra - molecular cloud extinction in the direction of the twa make the prospects for detecting substellar companions around these nearest t tauri stars much better than the prospects for similar searches for young low mass companions around t tauri stars in taurus - auriga , chamaeleon , lupus or ophiuchus , the next closest regions of star formation . in a recent study of the twa , webb et al .",
    "( 1999 ) identified a total of at least 17 sources as members of the twa .",
    "in addition , lowrance et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and webb et al .  have reported the discovery of a likely low mass brown dwarf companion ( m @xmath5 0.02 @xmath2 ) to twa 5a (= cd@xmath633@xmath37795 ) in a combination of ground - based and _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) observations .",
    "twa 5b is found almost 2  from twa 5a ; thus , despite its relative physical proximity ( @xmath4100 au ) to the primary , twa 5b is amenable to spectroscopic and astrometric studies , uncontaminated by light from twa 5a .    in this paper , we report results from imaging the fields around five stars in the twa , including the twa 5 system , using the near infrared camera and multi - object spectrometer ( nicmos ) and the _ hst_. the goal of this program was to search for companions around these stars . our choice of three narrowband filters centered at 1.64 , 1.90 and 2.15 @xmath0 m was designed to enable us to identify cool and low surface gravity objects , including substellar mass companions , through their likely strong signatures of h@xmath1o absorption at 1.9 @xmath0 m .",
    "we obtained images of five star systems ( table 1 ) in the twa using camera 1 ( nic1 ) and camera 2 ( nic2 ) of nicmos between 1998 may 30 and july 12 ( u.t . ) observations of each of the five stars were made identically . using nic1 and filter f164n ,",
    "we imaged each target in a four position , spiral dither pattern , with an integration time per position of 33.894 s. three images were obtained at each position for a total integration time of 406.73 s. we carried out identical observations using nic1 and filter f190n , with an integration time per position of 43.864 s and a total integration time of 526.37 s. switching to nic2 and filter f215n , we again obtained three sets of four - position dithered image suites ; however , for the f215n observations we changed the starting position for the dithered image suites in order to obtain a better median filtered image for subtraction of the thermal background .",
    "the integration time per position was 15.948 s for the nic2 images , for a total integration time of 191.38 s.",
    "we find no sources in any of our images other than the previously known five primaries and four secondaries , to limiting magnitudes of 18.3 , 18.4 and 17.5 in the f164n , f190n and f215n images , respectively , at distances beyond @xmath413 at 1.64 and 1.90 @xmath0 m and 23 at 2.15 @xmath0 m .",
    "the images of twa 5 ( fig .",
    "1 ) reveal how how easy it is to detect and image young , intermediate mass , brown dwarf companions around stars in the twa , even without a coronagraph .",
    "in addition , all nine imaged objects appear as point sources ( with fwhm of 014 , 016 , and 018  in the f164n , f190n and f215n images , respectively ) , with no evidence ( after deconvolutions performed with point spread functions [ psfs ] generated using the software package tiny tim , direct subtractions of psfs , and examinations of azimuthally averaged radial intensity profiles [ fig .  2 ] ) of extended emission around any of them .",
    "thus , although some of these stars appear to be surrounded by circumstellar material ( e.g. , twa 1 is surrounded by a circumstellar disk of radius @xmath43  that is viewed nearly face - on ; @xcite ) , we conclude that these direct , narrow band images are insufficiently sensitive to image circumstellar disks around these stars .",
    "we report our photometry for these observations in table  1 .",
    "the factors used to convert from nicmos count rates to absolute fluxes and magnitudes were 5.376665 @xmath7 10@xmath8 jy sec adu@xmath9 for the f164n filter , 4.866353 @xmath7 10@xmath8 jy sec adu@xmath9 for the f190n filter , and 3.974405 @xmath7 10@xmath8 jy sec adu@xmath9 for the f215n filter with zero point flux densities of 1033 jy , 862 jy , and 690 jy , respectively .",
    "photometry was obtained by measuring the total counts within a 05 radius aperture and then applying a correction factor of 1.15 to compensate for the flux that falls outside of this radius .",
    "figure 3 shows how the photometry of twa stars through the @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath12 broadband and the f164n , f190n and f215n narrowband filters relates to the near infrared spectral characteristics of late - type stars .",
    "stars with lower effective temperatures have increasingly strong water absorption bands centered at @xmath13 m and @xmath14 m which are very effectively probed by this combination of broad and narrowband filters .",
    "we find no systematic differences between the @xmath12 and f215n photometry ( see fig .  3 , right panel ) , despite the slight difference in central wavelengths and large difference in bandwidth . on the other hand",
    "the stars are systematically brighter at f164n than at @xmath11-band , the most extreme case being twa 5b .",
    "finally , twa 5b is the only star with an absolute flux that is clearly lower at 1.9 than at 2.15 @xmath0 m .",
    "the left hand panel of fig .",
    "3 clearly shows how water absorption in the 1.35 - 1.55 and 1.7 - 2.1 @xmath0 m regions will strongly affect broad band @xmath11 measurements but will have no effect on observations with the f164n filter ( see also the library of near - infrared spectra published by lanon & rocca - volmerange 1992 ) .",
    "thus , the @xmath11-band and f164n observations reveal the presence of different amounts of water vapor absorption in the spectra of most of the stars in our sample .      for the four binary systems in our sample",
    ", we measured the intensity centroids for each binary component and transformed the cartesian positions on the array into offsets in right ascension and declination of the secondaries from the primaries ( table  2 ) . except for twa 8 ,",
    "for which the binary separation is such that the companion only appeared in the nic2 images , the results presented in table  2 are those obtained using only the nic1 images since the spatial resolution is highest when using the nic1 array .",
    "the nic1-based results in table  2 are the statistical average and standard deviations based on measurements of the f164n and f190n images .",
    "the pixel to ra and dec conversions were done using the plate scale measurement ephemeris generated by the nicmos instrument team .",
    "comparison of the results for the f164n and f190n images indicate that , in most cases , we can determine image separations to an accuracy of 0.02 pixels ( @xmath15 1 milli - arcsec ) .    because our astrometric results are obtained from unocculted _ hst _ images and with the highest resolution camera in nicmos , these results are much more precise than offsets previously reported for these binaries .",
    "they are , however , consistent with previous results ( table  2 ) . in the case of twa 5b ,",
    "lowrance , weinberger & schneider ( 1999 ) recently independently determined that the offsets reported in lowrance et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and webb et al .",
    "( 1999 ) have a sign error in ra ; the corrected values are reported in table  2 .",
    "we have constructed an h - r diagram for the twa ( fig .  4 ) using the pre - main sequence tracks of baraffe et al .",
    "this h - r diagram is quite similar to that presented by webb et al .",
    "( 1999 ) , which is based on the pre - main sequence tracks of dantona & mazzitelli ( 1997 ) ; however , fig .",
    "4 appears to constrain the cluster age more tightly than does previous work on the twa , presumably because of improved physics included in the baraffe et al .",
    "tracks ( see baraffe et al .",
    "1997 for a discussion ) . specifically , virtually all of the stars , including twa 5b , fall between the 3 and 10 my isochrones . in comparison ,",
    "the h - r diagrams of webb et al . and lowrance et al .  ( 1999 ) indicate that the twa stars have ages in the range 1100 my while kastner et al .",
    "( 1997 ) suggested that the likely age of the twa stars is 1030 my , based on lithium studies ( upper limit ) and x - ray luminosities ( lower limit ) .",
    "twa 6 and twa 9a , which lie together almost on the 30 my isochrone , and twa 9b , which falls near the 100 my isochrone , are mild outliers in our and the webb et al .",
    "hr diagrams and appear to be older than the other twa stars ( however , see webb et al .  for other possible explanations ) .",
    "what other information do we have to constrain the ages of the twa stars ?",
    "soderblom et al .  (",
    "1998 ) used the lithium abundance to place an age range of 520 my and a most probable age of 10 @xmath16 3 my on twa 4 ( hd 98800 ; ew(li @xmath176708 ) = 0.36  ) ; stauffer , hartmann , & barrado y navascues ( 1995 ) used the strength of the li line to assign an upper limit of 911 my to twa 11b ( hr 4796b ) while jayawardhana et al .",
    "( 1998 ) assigned an isochronal age of 8 @xmath16 3 my to this star ; and webb et al .",
    "( 1999 ) measured similar li ew strengths for 14 of the 17 stars identified as members of the twa and , on this basis , suggested that they are all less than @xmath410 my .",
    "the excellent agreement between the ages estimated from the li ews and those obtained from photometry and pre - main sequence evolutionary tracks suggests that the age of the twa is well constrained to be in the range 515 my .",
    "twa 5a is a m1.5 star ( webb et al .",
    "1999 ) with @xmath18k ( leggett et al .",
    "the distance to the twa 5 system is presently unknown but can be estimated as @xmath19pc from the measured parallaxes of four members of the association ( webb et al .",
    "the range of distances is consistent with the approximate angular dimension of the association . with @xmath20pc and @xmath21 ,",
    "we find @xmath22 . by comparing these values of @xmath23 and @xmath24 with the evolution sequences of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we find @xmath25 and an age of 2.5 to 6 my for twa 5a , assuming it is a single , pre - main sequence star ( fig .",
    "4 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "webb et al .",
    "report that twa 5a is suspected to be a spectroscopic binary .",
    "if we assume that twa 5a is binary with equal mass components , the mass of each component decreases to @xmath26 and the age range becomes 6 to 18 my .    since the baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) sequence does not extend to substellar masses , we analyze the photometric measurements of twa 5b with evolutionary models computed by saumon & burrows ( unpublished ) .",
    "these models use the same interior physics as saumon et al .",
    "( 1996 ) and burrows et al .",
    "( 1997 ) with the distinction that the surface boundary condition is provided by the `` nextgen '' sequence of atmosphere models computed by allard and hauschildt for cool stars ( allard et al .",
    "1996 , hauschildt , allard & baron 1999 ) .",
    "the atmospheric structures provide a surface boundary condition for the interior models by giving a relation between the interior entropy ( where the convective zone becomes essentially adiabatic at depth ) and the surface parameters @xmath27 .",
    "this relation plays a central role in controlling the evolution of fully convective stars .",
    "colors are computed from the synthetic spectra , and are therefore fully consistent with the evolution calculation .",
    "this evolution sequence was calculated for objects with solar compositions and masses between 0.01 and 0.3@xmath2 , and is very similar to that of baraffe et al .",
    "( 1998 ) since it uses the same input physics ( equation of state , atmosphere models , nuclear reaction screening factors , etc . ) .",
    "a limitation of the `` nextgen '' atmospheres is that they do not include dust opacity , which becomes significant for @xmath28k .",
    "figure 5 shows the evolution of the absolute magnitudes at @xmath29 , @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath12 bands , from 1 to 100 my , based on the models of saumon & burrows ( unpublished ) .",
    "each curve shows the evolution for a fixed mass .",
    "the two dashed lines highlight the 0.02 and 0.03@xmath2 models .",
    "the boxes show the photometric measurements for twa 5b ( webb et al . 1999 ,",
    "lowrance et al . 1999 ) , with the height of the box representing the @xmath30 photometric error and the width showing the 515 my estimated age of the association .",
    "the absolute magnitudes of twa 5b assume a distance of 55 pc and the @xmath31pc uncertainty is shown by the error bar in the upper right corner .",
    "all four bandpasses indicate that the mass of twa 5b is between 0.02 and 0.03@xmath2 with an upper limit of @xmath32 if the twa 5 system lies on the far side of the association and near the upper limit of our age estimate .",
    "given this mass range and the estimated age of twa 5b , the models indicate that its surface gravity is @xmath33 .",
    "stellar and substellar objects with @xmath34 undergo a phase of nearly constant luminosity which corresponds to the fusion of their primordial deuterium content ( dantona & mazzitelli 1985 , saumon et al .",
    "this phase lasts for 2 - 20 my and contraction  with a consequent steady decrease in luminosity  resumes once the deuterium is exhausted .",
    "figure 5 shows that twa 5b is almost certainly in the deuterium burning phase of its evolution .",
    "the @xmath35 colors of twa 5b are consistent with its dm8.5dm9 spectral classification based on 0.650.75 @xmath0 m spectra ( @xcite ) , and thus a temperature of @xmath36k ( @xcite ) . in a @xmath37 vs. @xmath38 diagram ,",
    "twa 5b falls well outside of the observed sequence of very - low mass stars and brown dwarf candidates in the field ( @xcite ) , while all other members of the association fall along the observed sequence of field stars .",
    "this indicates that the @xmath11 magnitude for twa 5b may be erroneous ( by @xmath39 1@xmath40 ) or that its relatively low surface gravity results in a redder @xmath38 color .",
    "the narrowband infrared colors are shown in fig .",
    "6 along with the synthetic colors from the `` nextgen '' spectra .",
    "each curve shows the colors for @xmath41 , 2800 , 3000 and 3200@xmath42k ( from left to right ) for a fixed gravity .",
    "the colors of twa 5b are shown by the triangle with error bars .",
    "for the estimated @xmath36k and @xmath43 , there is a reasonable agreement for the f164n@xmath6f215n color but the models are @xmath44 magnitude too blue in f164n@xmath6f190n .",
    "consequently , twa 5b is brighter at 1.9 @xmath0 m than predicted by the models .",
    "the f190n bandpass falls in the middle of a strong h@xmath1o absorption band ( fig .",
    "3 ) whose strength probably is overestimated by the `` nextgen '' models .",
    "allard et al .  (",
    "1997 ) compare a sequence of near - infrared spectra of late m dwarfs with their synthetic spectra . in all cases ,",
    "the models overestimate the depth of the h@xmath1o band , an effect which increases for later spectral types .",
    "while an inadequate h@xmath1o opacity may be partly responsible for this effect , tsuji , ohnaka , & aoki ( 1996 ) have shown that the condensation of dust in atmospheres of low @xmath23 results in a source of continuum opacity which decreases the depth of the water absorption bands .",
    "new atmosphere models including dust opacity ( tsuji , ohnaka , & aoki ; leggett , allard & hauschildt 1998 ) indicate that its effects on the spectrum ( and on broadband colors ) become discernible for @xmath45k but remain moderate ( @xmath46 mag ) at the effective temperature of twa 5b ( @xmath47k ) .",
    "while current models including dust opacity may not fully account for the relatively high f190n flux of twa 5b , the f164n@xmath6f190n color of twa 5b is a strong indication of the presence of dust in its atmosphere .      at a distance of 55 @xmath16 9",
    "pc , twa 5b lies at a projected distance from twa 5a of 108 astronomical units .",
    "twa 5a has a spectral type of m1.5 and a likely mass for the central binary of @xmath41.4 m@xmath48 while twa 5b has an estimated spectral type of m8.5 ( @xcite ) and a likely mass of @xmath425 m@xmath49 .",
    "given this information about the twa 5 system , the orbital period p of twa 5b should be p @xmath5 1000 years .",
    "thus , the angular motion of twa 5b , assuming a circular orbit of radius 196 viewed nearly pole - on , would be 0013 yr@xmath9 ( or 0010 yr@xmath9 if twa 5a is a single star with a mass of 0.7 m@xmath48 and p = 1300 years ) .",
    "the nicmos observations of twa 5 were obtained on 25 april ( @xcite ) and 12 july 1998 ( this paper ) , a difference of @xmath40.21 years . in only one - fifth of a year ,",
    "the orbital motion of twa 5b would have changed its position relative to twa 5a by only @xmath400027 , too small for the positional difference to be measured at these two epochs .",
    "thus , the differences between the positions we measured and the corrected positions from earlier epoch observations reported by lowrance , weinberger , & schneider ( 1999 ) are strictly due to the relative accuracies of the different measurements .",
    "although we have demonstrated that the positional change for twa 5b is measurement error , not orbital motion , we also have shown that the position reported in this paper is a very accurate `` starting '' position for twa 5b .",
    "in addition , our results show that it is possible to measure the relative separation of these two objects to an accuracy of only a few thousandths of an arcsec",
    ". thus , the orbital motion of twa 5b should be measurable to a fairly high degree of accuracy with ground - based observing facilities equipped with adaptive optics or with the refurbished nicmos camera .",
    "to the sensitivity limits of these data , our images reveal no detectable circumstellar disks or infrared reflection nebulae , and no low mass stellar or substellar companions around stars in the five studied twa systems other than the previously discovered twa 5b . as for twa 5b itself , our results suggest that this object has a mass in the range of 0.020.03 @xmath2 , in good agreement with the work of lowrance et al .",
    "( 1999 ) . finally , while our single epoch observations can not demonstrate or measure the orbital motion of twa 5b , they are more than accurate enough to permit the measurement of this motion , in combination with future epoch _ hst _ or adaptive optics , ground - based observations , with a baseline of only about a year .",
