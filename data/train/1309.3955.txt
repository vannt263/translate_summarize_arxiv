    "the diffuse galactic @xmath0-ray emission ( dge ) from the full sky has recently been analyzed and compared with the observations with the _ fermi _ large area telescope ( _ fermi_-lat ) for high energies ( he ; @xmath1 ) @xcite .",
    "the dge had been modeled using the galprop code ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "for a review , see @xcite .",
    "these phenomenological models were constrained to reproduce directly measured cosmic ray ( cr ) data and were then used iteratively to calculate the dge ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) . to construct a model for the expected total @xmath0-ray emission , the @xmath0-ray emission from the resolved point sources together with the residual instrumental @xmath0-ray background and the extragalactic diffuse @xmath0-ray background  both assumed to be isotropic @xcite ",
    "were added to the dge model . in the inner galaxy ,",
    "the emission of the resolved sources apparently reaches a fraction of @xmath2  percent of the expected overall spectral energy flux density at @xmath3  gev @xcite .",
    "these overall emission models describe the _",
    "fermi_-lat data well at high and intermediate latitudes and thereby show that the so - called egret gev excess ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) does not exist in the form previously inferred @xcite .",
    "in the galactic plane these models systematically underpredict the data above a few gev , and they do so increasingly above about 10 gev until 100 gev ( see fig . 15 of * ? ? ?",
    "in the present paper this difference between data and model will be called the `` _ fermi_-lat galactic plane surplus '' ( fl - gps ) .",
    "it is most pronounced in the inner galaxy . according to @xcite ,",
    "it can however also be seen in the outer galaxy , with even a small excess at intermediate latitudes .",
    "the galprop code is constrained by the charged energetic particles directly measured in the neighborhood of the solar system which are by assumption truly diffuse crs .",
    "therefore the above discrepancy is not too surprising , because in this comparison the @xmath0-ray emission from particles _ within _ the cr sources is only taken into account for those @xmath0-ray sources that are resolved by the instrument .    the dominant part of the @xmath0-ray sources resolved by the _",

    "fermi_-lat 1fgl catalog and taken into account in the ackermann et al .",
    "( 2012 ) analysis , are pulsars , as far as the galaxy is concerned .",
    "except for the crab nebula and vela x the he @xmath0-ray emission from pulsar wind nebulae may actually be again pulsar radiation , even though most recently three more pulsar wind nebulae have been identified with _",
    "fermi_-lat @xcite . for purposes of their @xmath0-ray emission",
    "these objects are assumed in the present paper to be sources of energetic electrons and positrons , but not sources of nuclear crs .",
    "of the latter presumably only a handful have been resolved , and are thus included in the overall _ fermi_-lat emission model @xcite . in all probability",
    "the majority of nuclear cr sources remains unresolved , and is therefore excluded from that model . as a consequence",
    "the fl - gps can be expected to be a physical , not an instrumental effect .    independently of whether they are resolved or not , the nuclear cr sources",
    "are presumably concentrated in the galactic disk , if they are the consequence of star formation processes .",
    "they are assumed in the present paper to be the shell - type supernova remnants ( snrs ) , regardless whether they are isolated or embedded in stellar associations , e.g. in superbubbles .",
    "the fact that the fl - gps is concentrated in the inner galaxy is then the result of the well - known concentration of sn explosions in the inner galaxy ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and in the inner parts of other galaxies @xcite . this concentration is also confirmed by the galactic distribution of pulsars as compact remnants of core - collapse sn explosions @xcite .",
    "the total @xmath0-ray emission does not have such a strong radial gradient in the galactic plane , as observed at comparatively low energies were the purely diffuse emission should dominate , by e.g. the cos - b satellite for @xmath4  mev @xcite and the egret instrument on the cgro satellite for @xmath5  mev @xcite .",
    "this difference has also been discussed by @xcite .",
    "a weak gradient of the diffuse emission has been interpreted theoretically as the consequence of preferential ( faster ) convective cr removal from the disk into the halo in the inner galaxy , where the higher cr source density and the decrease of the galactic escape velocity with increasing galactic radius drive a faster _ galactic wind _",
    "this is a nonlinear propagation effect .",
    "therefore the concentration of the fl - gps in the inner galaxy is largely the result of the radial gradient in the cr source density , because the diffuse cr density is largely independent of radius - to-@xmath6 scaling factor , regarding the gas target for the gamma - ray emission , on account of a radial decrease of the metallicity in the galactic disk inferred from observations in external galaxies @xcite . ] .",
    "the dependence of the fl - gps on @xmath0-ray energy is another aspect which is suggested to be due to the difference between the diffuse particle spectra and the particle source spectra . in a selfconsistent model for energetic particle propagation in such a galactic wind @xcite , where nonlinear damping of the scattering magnetic irregularities balances their growth due to the outward cr streaming , this spectral difference is naturally explained .",
    "the theoretical interpretation of the location of the fl - gps in the galaxy and of its energy dependence , presented here , is therefore entirely based on the _ propagation characteristics of the diffuse cr population in the galaxy _ , both in its dependence on the radial distance from the axis of rotation as well as in its variation with particle energy .    from a purely phenomenological point of view",
    "it is only necessary to assume that the dge is essentially independent of radius in the galactic plane and that the diffuse energy distribution of the charged energetic particles is significantly softer than the energy distribution in their sources . indeed , starting with the work of @xcite on the decrease of the flux ratio of secondary to primary nuclear particles with increasing rigidity , as observed in the neighborhood of the solar system , the particle energy spectra inside these sources have been inferred to be substantially harder than the energy spectrum of the average crs in the interstellar medium ( ism ) ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* for a recent review ) .",
    "even though the volume fraction of the active sources is presumably quite small , the energy density of the energetic particles there is very high , coexisting together with a thermal gas density comparable to that in the average ism . in this context",
    "an active source is meant to be one which still basically contains the particles it has accelerated .",
    "these particles shall be called source cosmic rays ( scrs ) .",
    "as demonstrated for the first time in @xcite , the contribution of scrs to the dge from accelerated crs - still confined in their parent snrs - progressively increases with energy due to their hard spectrum .",
    "therefore this contribution becomes unavoidably significant the latest at vhe energies .",
    "in a subsequent paper the scr contribution was studied in more detail @xcite . for the following these papers",
    "will be referred to as bv00 and bv04 , respectively .",
    "a later study of the contribution of unresolved source populations has been made by @xcite .",
    "shell - type snrs have been observed , especially at very high energy ( vhe ; @xmath7  gev ) , to be important sources of @xmath0-rays ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "it is less clear , in which phase of their lifetime they lose most of the accelerated particles .",
    "this is determined by a complex interplay of the dissipation of magnetic field fluctuations inside ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and the hydrodynamic break - up of the overall expanding snr shell .",
    "the shell - type snrs are not the only vhe @xmath0-ray sources in the galaxy .",
    "in fact , the most abundant resolved galactic @xmath0-ray sources at vhe are pulsar wind nebulae ( pwn ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these are in all probability the result of the winds from young , energetic pulsars with characteristic ages @xmath8  yrs , and of the accelerated population of electrons in them which , in particular , emit inverse compton ( ic ) @xmath0-rays in an almost calorimetric fashion @xcite . the particle acceleration and resulting emission is quite complex and poorly understood .",
    "pwn observations , including the radio and x - ray range , are often fitted by a phenomenological model going back to @xcite which assumes an energy distribution of the radiating electrons in the form of a power law with a cutoff , in a uniform magnetic field and in a radiation field approximately equal to the cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "the @xmath0-ray spectral energy densities of pwns are therefore assumed to be typically peaked with a cutoff at a few tev .",
    "the lifetime @xmath9 of tev emitting leptons in typical pwns has been estimated to be @xmath10  kyr @xcite . in a rough sense",
    "the total number @xmath11 of pwns in the galaxy is then @xmath12 , where @xmath13 denotes the galactic vhe - emitting pwn rate in units of core collapse events per century @xcite .",
    "this is at least as large as the number of active shell - type snrs ( see below ) . as a result",
    "the population of unresolved pwns may contribute to the fl - gps , and substantially to the total vhe emission , even though this is difficult to estimate for the reasons given above .",
    "the relative size of the contributions of the unresolved parts of the various @xmath0-ray source populations is an important question . presumably at energies beyond about 10 tev",
    "the pwn fraction is small due to the cutoff in the electron spectra as a result of radiative losses .",
    "the spectra of nuclear particles in shell - type snrs can , on the other hand , extend to energies of many hundreds of tev with differential energy spectra close to a power law @xmath14 , where @xmath15 .",
    "such an extent in energy is in particular expected in young objects , like the type ia objects sn1006 @xcite or tycho s snr @xcite , where the escape of the highest - energy particles is arguably still weak . in very energetic ,",
    "young core collapse supernovae , @xmath0-ray energies well in excess of 100 tev might be reached @xcite .",
    "however , the corresponding supernova rate is expected to be so low @xcite ( less than about 1% of the total supernova rate ) that their contribution is disregarded here .    in this paper",
    "only the contribution of unresolved shell - type snrs to the galactic @xmath0-ray emission will be discussed in detail , following the earlier work by bv00 and bv04 .",
    "as will be shown , the radiation from these scrs which extends with a hard power - law - type energy spectrum to multi - tev @xmath0-ray energies can readily explain the above - mentioned fl - gps and predicts its monotonic increase from @xmath16  gev into the multi - tev region .",
    "the evaluation of the contribution of the unresolved pwn population is left for a future study .",
    "the _ fermi_-lat overall emission model corresponds to a spectral energy distribution ( sed ) @xmath17 , where @xmath18 denotes the sum of the truly diffuse hadronic plus inverse compton plus bremsstrahlung emission spectra , @xmath19 is the contribution from the resolved sources , and @xmath20 corresponds to that of the isotropic backgrounds .",
    "the resolved sources  which include few shell - type snrs , many pulsars , and , at energies @xmath21  gev , the resolved pwns  are expected to have a harder spectrum than the dge .",
    "therefore @xmath22 corresponds to a harder spectrum than the approximate @xmath23-dependence of the modeled dge in the inner galaxy at energies @xmath24  gev below any cutoff . to a large degree",
    "this is due to the contribution of the ic component and especially , that of the resolved sources .",
    "given the representation by the fermi - lat collaboration , the most reasonable initial extension beyond 100 gev of @xmath22 appears to be an extrapolation by a power - law distribution @xmath25 of the same spectral index @xmath0 which it has between @xmath26  gev and @xmath27  gev .",
    "however , the @xmath0-ray spectral energy densities of pwns are assumed to be typically peaked with a cutoff at several tev .",
    "the truly diffuse leptonic emission is expected to cut off at similar energies",
    ". therefore the component @xmath28 is multiplied by an exponential term @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath22 extrapolated in this form is shown by the dashed curve in fig.[fig1]-ray binaries , which may reach significantly higher @xmath0-ray energies beyond 10 tev ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "] . from its construction @xmath22",
    "is an approximate lower limit to the expected sed without unresolved sources .",
    "the program of the present paper is then to calculate the contribution of the unresolved shell - type snrs in order to predict a lower limit to the total emission in the inner galaxy in the gev range and above .",
    "as will be shown , this lower limit implies an increasing discrepancy between measured and expected  diffuse galactic emission in the region of few gev @xmath30 100  gev , and thus can explain the fl - gps .",
    "the discrepancy is predicted to increase up to energies @xmath31  tev in the vhe range . beyond that @xmath0-ray energy",
    "the contribution of the unresolved shell - type snrs goes down due to energy dependent escape of crs from shell - type snrs that makes for a shorter confinement time of crs with higher energy .",
    "in fig.[fig1 ] a calculated @xmath0-ray spectrum @xmath32 of the low latitude inner galaxy ( @xmath33 , @xmath34 ) is presented . besides the overall emission model @xmath22 , discussed in the previous section , it includes the contribution @xmath35 of scrs confined within unresolved snrs .",
    "the scr contribution is calculated based on the approach developed in bv04 : @xmath36 where @xmath37 depends on the galactocentric distance as a result of the non - uniform distribution of the galactic snrs ( see introduction ) .",
    "@xmath35 comprises the @xmath38-decay component due to hadronic scrs @xmath39 and the inverse compton ( ic ) component due to electron scrs @xmath40 . here",
    "@xmath41 is chosen as the @xmath38-decay component due to hadronic gcrs . at @xmath0-ray energy @xmath42",
    "gev the quantity @xmath43 , determined by @xcite , and its power law extrapolation @xmath44 to higher energies @xmath45  gev is used .",
    "the dimensionless ratio @xmath46 according to bv04 has the form @xmath47 where @xmath48 and @xmath49 are the gas number density in the galactic disk and inside snrs , respectively . the first factor in this expression , @xmath50 , represents the ratio of target nuclei for the two populations of crs .",
    "the second factor , @xmath51 , represents the fact that the number of snrs , wich confine scrs with energy @xmath52 , is proportional to @xmath53 .",
    "the third factor @xmath54 is due to the harder scr spectrum compared with the gcr spectrum .",
    "contrary to the earlier considerations of bv00 and bv04 , where the interior snr magnetic field was assumed to be time independent , the proton confinement time @xmath55 inside the expanding snr is determined taking into account magnetic field amplification and its time dependence @xmath56 . magnetic field amplification in strong shocks",
    "is a general theoretical concept arising from the expected nonlinear growth of unstable magnetic irregularities produced by the accelerating crs themselves @xcite .",
    "field amplification is however also clearly observed in a number of snr sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "here it is assumed to be a universal effect in shell - type snrs ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "in this case the maximum energy of scr protons , accelerated at a given snr evolutionary epoch , decreases with time according to the relation @xmath57 .",
    "this leads to the following expression for the proton confinement time @xmath58 where @xmath59 is the time until which snrs can confine the main fraction of accelerated particles , @xmath60 is the maximal energy of protons that can be accelerated in snrs , achieved at the beginning of the sedov phase @xmath61 .",
    "the decrease of the proton confinement time @xmath51 with energy @xmath52 is due to the diminishing ability of the snr shock to produce high - energy crs during the sedov phase , which implies the escape of the highest energy crs from the snr @xcite .",
    "therefore the description in terms of the escape time @xmath51 is equivalent to an initial production of the scr spectrum @xmath62 for @xmath63 in the evolving snr , following the sn explosion proper .",
    "subsequently this spectrum is confined over the time - scale @xmath53 .",
    "this weighs the fraction of the highest energies @xmath60 with the sedov time @xmath64 , lower - energy particles with a larger time that increases with decreasing @xmath52 , and `` low - energy '' particles with @xmath59 .",
    "note that , due to the considerably harder scr energy spectrum compared with the gcr spectrum , the factor @xmath65 grows with energy up to a maximal energy @xmath66 of @xmath0-rays produced by scrs confined in snrs for the whole active evolutionary time @xmath67 .",
    "the spectrum @xmath68 at @xmath69 is predominantly produced by snrs of ages @xmath70 .",
    "therefore it is only weakly sensitive to the details of snr evolution at the epochs @xmath71 . at higher energies @xmath72 ,",
    "the ratio @xmath73 goes down with energy and the scr contribution decreases due to the decrease of the confinement time @xmath51 .    the ratio @xmath74 is calculated as described in bv04 with a time - independent interior magnetic field value @xmath75  @xmath76 g .    since the dominant part of snrs in our galaxy is due to type ii sne with a relatively low progenitor star mass , which do not form extended wind bubbles during their evolution , here only the contribution of snrs expanding into a uniform ism",
    "will be considered .",
    "the calculations presented in fig.[fig1 ] have been performed with the following values of the relevant physical parameters : sweep up time @xmath77  yr , confinement time of scrs inside snrs @xmath78  yr , electron to proton ratio @xmath79 , effective scr power law index @xmath80 , and 10 percent efficiency of scr production in snrs , the choice of an effective @xmath80 for the scr @xmath0-ray -production allows the approximate inclusion of he @xmath0-ray emission from localised strong gas density enhancements overrun by the snr shock , as one might interpret snr - associated @xmath0-ray emissions observed , limited largely to the he range ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "since the scrs are confined inside the snrs within a thin shell behind the shock , where also the shock - compressed ism gas is situated , the interior snr gas number density @xmath81 is used , where @xmath48 is the ism gas number density .",
    "since during the last ten years convincing observational evidence of considerable snr magnetic field amplification @xcite leading to the production of crs with energy up to @xmath82  gev @xcite has been found , the value @xmath83  gev is used here .",
    "it is considerably larger compared with bv00 and bv04 .    due to the cutoff introduced for the component",
    "@xmath84 the calculated sed @xmath85 represents a lower limit for the expected @xmath0-ray background at energies @xmath86  tev .",
    "it should nevertheless be emphasized here that @xmath87 is given in terms of the ratios @xmath88 and @xmath89 , and that @xmath41 is determined by the diffuse nuclear cr distribution which is rather well - known at least until the `` knee '' of the all - particle gcr spectrum .",
    "therefore @xmath35 does not depend on the form of the extrapolation of @xmath22 beyond 100 gev .    as demonstrated in bv04",
    "there are two physical parameters which significantly influence the expected @xmath0-ray emission from the ensemble of shell - type snrs : the cr confinement time @xmath59 and the mean magnetic field strength @xmath90 inside the snrs . for a conventional value @xmath91",
    "@xmath76 g the expected @xmath0-ray flux from snrs exceeds the hegra upper limit considerably if the scr confinement time is as large as @xmath92  yr .",
    "the contradiction can be resolved either if one suggests an appreciably higher postshock magnetic field @xmath93  @xmath76 g or if the scr confinement time is as small as @xmath94  yr .",
    "these possibilities can be attributed to field amplification by the scrs themselves .",
    "in fact , nonlinear field amplification may also lead to a substantial decrease of the scr confinement time : according to @xcite maximal turbulent alfv@xmath95n wave damping with its corresponding increase of cr mobility could make the scr confinement time as small as @xmath94  yr .    the only physical parameter which strongly influences the ic @xmath0-ray production rate for given synchrotron emission rate is the snr magnetic field @xmath90 : @xmath96 . due to the high magnetic field",
    "@xmath75  @xmath76 g the overall contribution of the hadronic scrs to the @xmath0-ray flux dominates over that of the electron scrs : at tev - energies @xmath97 .    as shown in fig.[fig1 ] , the discrepancy between the observed `` diffuse '' intensity and standard model predictions at energies above a few gev @xcite can be attributed to the scr contribution alone up to @xmath98  gev .    unfortunately , existing vhe measurements do not coincide well in their longitude ( l ) and latitude ( b ) coverage with the corresponding ranges for _",
    "fermi_-lat that correspond to @xmath99 and @xmath100",
    ". therefore the following comparisons must be taken with reservations , and for this reason the observational results from these measurements are indicated in grey color in fig.[fig1 ] 1 . : as one can see , the expected @xmath0-ray flux at @xmath101  tev is consistent with the hegra upper limit , the whipple upper limits @xcite , the tibet - as upper limits @xcite , and with the fluxes measured by the milagro detector @xcite at @xmath102  tev , as well as with those obtained with the argo - ybj detector @xcite in the tev range , taken at face value .",
    "these considerations demonstrate that the scrs inevitably make a strong contribution to the `` diffuse '' @xmath0-ray flux from the galactic disk at all energies above a few gev , if the population of shell - type snrs is the main source of the gcrs .",
    "this explains the _",
    "fermi_-lat galactic plane surplus .",
    "the quantitative estimates show in addition that the scr contribution dominates over the extrapolated fermi - lat model for the total diffuse emission - which includes detected sources and isotropic backgrounds - at energies greater than 100  gev due to its substantially harder spectrum .",
    "the diffuse emission measured by milagro at 15  tev and by argo - ybj at tev energies provide limited evidence for that",
    ". it will be interesting to see if , and then to which extent , tev observations will show an even higher total emission than the one calculated here .",
    "if this was the case it is suggested that such a difference should be attributed to the emission from pulsar wind nebulae , or even to other particle sources , some of which were mentioned above .",
    "a full consideration of the potential particle sources is beyond the scope of this paper .",
    "the galactocentric variation of any surplus over the purely diffuse emission above a few gev should correspond to the galactocentric variation of the ratio @xmath37 between the @xmath38-decay components of source cosmic rays and truly diffuse galactic cosmic rays as a result of the observed snr distribution .",
    "this implies a concentration in the inner galaxy .    the authors would like to thank the referee , olaf reimer , for a number of critical and insightful comments that helped to improve the manuscript",
