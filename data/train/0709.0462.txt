    "we report briefly here some of the results extensively presented and discussed in @xcite .",
    "we considered three different mass models for the galaxy+halo system . in all the three cases",
    "considered we adopted triaxial shapes for both components , but with a different radial distribution for the dark and luminous matter ( lm ) . in the first model",
    "the dark matter ( dm ) was assumed to have the same axial ratios as the luminous matter ( 0.7:0.86:1 ) , while the second and third models were characterized by halos that were more prolate ( 0.5:0.66:1 ) and more oblate ( 0.7:0.93:1 ) , respectively , than the luminous matter .    in the absence of analytic expressions for the orbital integrals",
    ", one must resort to numerical methods to construct self - consistent models of galaxies or dark - matter halos . at this scope , we followed the @xcite scheme , which is also often referred to as _ orbital   superposition _ technique .",
    "we generalized schwarzschild s method to the construction of two - component ( luminous and dark matter ) , self - consistent models as follows .",
    "first , we constructed a catalog of orbits integrating the equations of motion for a particle moving in the potential generated by the sum of the luminous and dark matter density distributions .",
    "then , two different grids of cells , one for the luminous and one for the dark matter components , were built .",
    "we were able to successfully construct self - consistent models in all of the three cases considered for the shape of the dm halo .",
    "a large fraction of orbits in all the models are chaotic ; nevertheless , the evolution of the models shapes over a hubble time is likely to be small .",
    "this result suggests that dm haloes can coexist with triaxial galaxies .",
    "the velocity distribution are non - gaussian in shape ; the distribution is more peaked around the maximum and with broader tails , so to be better represented with a lorentzian profile ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this finding suggests care about unquestioned use of gaussian distributions as initial conditions for simulations ."
