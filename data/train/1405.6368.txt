    "understanding the role of dipolar interactions on thermally activated processes in assemblies of magnetic nanoparticles remains a challenge despite the technological importance in many areas such as magnetic information storage  @xcite , biology and medicine  @xcite .",
    "difficulties stem from the many - body nature of the problem involving anisotropic dipolar coupling between a large number of degrees of freedom and the multivariate distribution of particle properties relevant in real systems , giving rise to a range of complex behaviors such as multi - scale dynamics  @xcite , aging  @xcite , spin glass phase  @xcite , or initialization and memory effects  @xcite .",
    "langevin type dynamics that emerge from a system of coupled stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations  @xcite have proved to be a useful approach for understanding the behavior of assemblies of interacting superparamagnetic particles and the related high frequency phenomena  @xcite . a numerical solution of landau - lifshitz - gilbert equations requires the time step in the stochastic integration to be much smaller than the precession time , which practically limits calculations to time scales of hundreds of nanoseconds .",
    "however , thermal relaxation often takes many orders of magnitude longer .",
    "this is particularly true for magnetically ` viscous ' particles in the high damping regime , in or near their blocked states . in such cases",
    "the configuration space becomes separated into virtually disconnected regions , defining discrete states of a particle system . due to the relatively large energy barriers , the residence times in the neighborhood of these states",
    "are often very long , extending from milliseconds , for example in many biological applications , to years in magnetic recording . as a result , integrating the stochastic dynamical equations to explore the thermal relaxation dynamics in the full state space goes far beyond current computing capabilities .",
    "instead , a complementary framework describes the thermally activated transitions as a discrete markov process in this state space governed by the associated master - equation ( me )  @xcite , similar to the transition state theory in chemistry  @xcite . the problem is ideally approached by applying the kinetic ( dynamic ) monte - carlo methods which propagate the me in time  @xcite .",
    "the transition rates are taken to be of arrhenius form , dependent on energy barriers between the available states , in analogy with the early model of nel  @xcite .",
    "the crossover between the stochastic landau - lifshitz - gilbert dynamics and the me approach has been demonstrated previously in the case of ensembles of non - interacting particles  @xcite .    it is necessary to emphasize that such a me framework is fundamentally different from the time - quantified monte - carlo approaches  @xcite , which inherently lack any physically motivated time scales and rely on quantifying the monte - carlo step by a direct association with the time normalization in the langevin dynamics approach ( or the associated fokker - planck equation )  @xcite .",
    "such a ` time - coarse - grained ' approach does not allow resolving the spectrum of natural time scales of thermal fluctuation modes , which becomes essential if hysteresis plays a dominant role and the active part of the time scale spectrum depends on the memory of all previously visited states .    in the me",
    "formalism employed here , such a spectrum of time scales is naturally embedded , which allows a fully resolved description of time - dependent thermal relaxation processes .",
    "this comes at a price , since the procedure generally requires the solution of a global optimization problem to obtain a topographic mapping of the entire energy landscape of an interacting particle system .",
    "this essentially means identifying all possible transition paths between the available states and the associated energy barriers @xmath0 separating these states , determining the transition rates governing the network of probability flows within the state space .",
    "such a procedure quickly becomes a formidable task as the system size grows .",
    "the problem can be simplified , for instance by applying cumulant expansion methods to re - express the many - body me problem as a hierarchy of coupled evolution equations for cumulants of perpetually increasing order , which can then be truncated to a tractable form by applying appropriate decoupling approximations  @xcite .",
    "low order approximations are typically presumed , essentially neglecting any effects that might result from the correlated nature of thermal fluctuations within the interacting system .    in this way , the dipolar effect has been explored in systems of magnetic nanoparticles by varying particle concentration , clustering , and dimensionality  @xcite , and revealed the enhancement or suppression of relaxation time scales in specific cases . in small clusters of nanoparticles ,",
    "the finite size effects introduce a further dependence on geometry .",
    "the analyses lead to competing interpretations  @xcite , which brings into question the overall validity of the simplifying assumptions and suggests the need for a self - consistent treatment of the correlated fluctuation effects in any description of relaxation phenomena in interacting particle systems .    in this article",
    "such effects are included to a full extent to study weakly dipolar - interacting single - domain magnetic particles organized into small clusters , by adopting the full me formalism without assuming any degree of reduction .",
    "changing the particle cluster geometry , symmetry , and dimensionality allows a direct control of the dipolar interaction effects . quantifying the energy landscape in terms of the barriers @xmath0 ,",
    "composing the me and solving the associated eigenvalue problem , we express the magnetization decay during the approach to equilibrium in zero external field as a weighted superposition of contributions from time scales of the available relaxation modes : @xmath1 recovering the well - known expression of street - woolley  @xcite . here , @xmath2 is the initial magnetization , and @xmath3 following the arrhenius law with @xmath4 typically taken to be a constant in the nanosecond range  @xcite . as we will show , the variables @xmath5 , being a solution of the eigenvalue problem , are distinct from the energy barriers @xmath0 , and are to be interpreted as ` renormalized ' or ` eigen ' energy barriers ( in the units of thermal energy @xmath6 ) representing the time scales @xmath7 of dynamical modes resulting from the correlated nature of fluctuations .",
    "these emerge even in the weak interaction limit with a likelihood of only single spin - flip events .",
    "we show that the differences between @xmath5 and @xmath0 are strongly determined by the symmetry of clusters and give rise to an initial memory dependent relaxation .",
    "any deviations from the energy barrier picture and the memory effect disappear for symmetric spin clusters with an isotropic moment of inertia . on the other hand , in the non - symmetric cases",
    ", the same cluster structure may display both enhanced or suppressed interaction strength dependence of relaxation time scales , determined solely by the initialization prior the relaxation process , which is rather surprising . although our approach is semi - analytical , it remains fully equivalent to kinetic monte - carlo modeling  @xcite , as illustrated below .",
    "we develop a semi - analytical approach , based on a master - equation formalism , applicable to weakly interacting systems .",
    "consider an ensemble of @xmath8 independent clusters of spins .",
    "a typical cluster @xmath9 contains @xmath10 interacting spins @xmath11 , @xmath12 , represented as vectors of unit length .",
    "the governing energy density associated with the @xmath9-th cluster in the ensemble reads : @xmath13 the first term determines the preferential orientation of spins @xmath11 towards their anisotropy vectors @xmath14 , and the remaining terms are the zeeman energy and the dipolar interaction energy due to all neighbors of @xmath11 within the cluster where @xmath15 .",
    "here @xmath16 , the spin - spin separation vectors @xmath17 are normalized by the smallest spin - spin distance within a spin structure , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 is the interaction strength .",
    "interactions between different clusters @xmath9 are not considered .",
    "we use the standard phenomenology for describing thermal activation processes  @xcite , where the minima of eq .  , to be denoted as @xmath20 , define stable configurations of the @xmath10 spins as labeled microstates @xmath21 . at any field @xmath22 , the form of eq .",
    "forces the spins within the microstates to be bistable entities with a possibly non - collinear alignment , depending on the cluster geometry , the distribution of @xmath14 , and on @xmath22 .",
    "the model is analogous to a system of interacting stoner - wohlfarth particles  @xcite .    the total number of microstates @xmath23 of a cluster defines a discrete state - space for the stochastic thermal activation process .",
    "the rates @xmath24 of transitions from a microstate @xmath25 to @xmath21 are dependent on the energy barriers @xmath26 , where @xmath27 is the saddle point energy along the transition path @xmath28 . throughout this work",
    ", we assume the rates to take the arrhenius form : @xmath29  @xcite .",
    "the master - equation governing the time evolution of microstate probabilities reads  @xcite : @xmath30 including the initial condition at @xmath31 , consistent with the initial microstate @xmath32 , and the transition matrix is @xmath33 .",
    "if the external field @xmath22 is constant , then both @xmath34 and @xmath35 are time invariant .",
    "the master - equation reduces to a linear system of ordinary differential equations with the most general form of solutions  @xcite : @xmath36 here @xmath37 are the initial condition - dependent constants to be found by inverting the solutions @xmath38 at @xmath31 , and @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the eigenvalues and the right eigenvector components of the transition matrix , respectively . .",
    "the numerical analysis of ensembles containing @xmath41 individual cluster structures in fig .",
    "[ fig : structures ] , which will be discussed in detail below , suggests that although the eigenvalues of the transition matrices @xmath42 obtained from the corresponding eqs .",
    "are often degenerate in symmetric cases , the associated right eigenvectors are always linearly independent . , which reduces eq .   to a linear superposition of exponential contributions from the available relaxation time scales .",
    "the average magnetization of a cluster is obtained from the solutions as an expectation value @xmath43 , where @xmath44 are the magnetizations of microstates @xmath21 projected onto the external field vector @xmath45 : @xmath46 and the sum runs through all @xmath47 in @xmath21 . combining the expressions and arranging gives @xmath48 with @xmath49 . for convenience",

    "at this stage , it is useful to summarize the current notations and introduce some further notations used below .",

    "the energy equivalents of the relaxation time scales of eigenmodes @xmath7 have been denoted by @xmath5 , and will be termed rather artistically as ` eigen - barriers ' . to analyze ensembles of clusters with random properties , it will also be useful to distinguish between the notations for the distribution of a property of a cluster and those of an ensemble , denoted by @xmath54 and @xmath55 respectively .",
    "for example , the set @xmath56 is a distribution of energy barriers of a cluster @xmath9 calculated from the associated eq .   and the @xmath57 a distribution of all energy barriers obtained from eqs .   individually for every cluster in the ensemble",
    "similarly , @xmath58 denotes the transition matrix associated with a cluster @xmath9 , i.e. equivalent to @xmath35 in the previous notation , and @xmath59 the ensemble of all matrices .",
    "the ensemble averages will be denoted by the triangular brackets @xmath60 . to avoid confusion , where possible we will drop the subscript @xmath61 to further simplify these notations , replacing @xmath58 simply by @xmath62 , etc .    the above calculation of @xmath63 in eq .",

    "the coefficients @xmath69 weight the contributions of eigen - barriers @xmath5 to the magnetization decay .",

    "it is then expected that the symmetry is always broken for the ensembles of spin - chains , as opposed to ensembles of clusters with higher geometrical symmetries such as that of the pyramidal structure .    while the conclusions below are general and based on thorough testing , the specific parameter set used in simulations here was @xmath93 nm , @xmath94 k , @xmath95 j / m@xmath96 , @xmath97 a / m ( @xmath98fe@xmath99o@xmath100 particles ) , giving @xmath101 and the maximum interactions strength @xmath102 j / m@xmath96 , which will be used as a reference .",

    "furthermore , it is a common feature in the ensembles @xmath81 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 that increasing the cluster size gives rise to the systematic increase of the correction @xmath157 , i.e. more pronounced deviations from the energy barrier picture , and that this occurs for both types of initializations .",
    "however , in some cases of structures of type @xmath86 the @xmath157 no longer increases monotonically with @xmath105 .",
    "for example , the ensemble of 4-spin clusters @xmath86 displays larger @xmath157 than the ensemble of 5-spin clusters . in addition , in some cases of structures @xmath86 with higher geometrical symmetry , the observed @xmath157 is small and the effect of initialization negligible .",
    "these observations suggest the role of cluster geometry in the quantitative description by eq .   and possibly a relation to the dimensionality of a system .",
    "to check this , we define as a measure of symmetry a cumulative sum of the differences of the principal moments of inertia obtained by combining the eigenvalues @xmath169 , @xmath170 , @xmath171 of the cluster s moment of inertia tensor : @xmath172 .",
    "thus @xmath173 for a spherically symmetric structure , and @xmath174 for a structure with anisotropic geometry . in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct_fits ] , the @xmath175 vs. @xmath176 is shown for the ensembles of spin clusters @xmath81 , @xmath84 , @xmath83 , and @xmath86 of varying @xmath105 and initializations .",
    "the @xmath177 corresponds to the upper estimate of the correction , i.e. the maximum @xmath178 from all @xmath19 for a given structure type , and equals the maximum deviation from the dotted lines in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct_de ] .",
    "the systematic increase of the relative correction with increasing @xmath176 , and thus the breakdown of the energy barrier picture , is clearly demonstrated for all types of structures considered and correlates well with the dependence on initialization . for example , the highly symmetric structures @xmath179 in @xmath180 as well as the small size structures @xmath81 , @xmath83 , and @xmath84 show practically no memory of initialization during the magnetization decay in the approach to equilibrium .",
    "thus , this confirms the fundamental relation between the geometry of spin arrangements , initialization dependence of relaxation , and the validity of the energy barrier picture .",
    "as a main conclusion , the developed me framework allows the quantification of the validity of the conventional energy barrier picture which is widely used for interpreting experimental and computational studies of the relaxation behavior in magnetic nanoparticle systems .",
    "it shows , that the energy barrier picture neglects important aspects of the correlated nature of thermal fluctuations , and as a result can not reproduce the initialization dependence , effects of geometry , symmetry properties , or dimensionality of interacting structures on thermal relaxation processes .",
    "this implies that the inverse problems to quantify dipolar interactions from experiments are ill - posed , where , for example , the same structures may display both increasing or decreasing interaction trends of relaxation time scales ( i.e. the approach to equilibrium ) , depending solely on the character of sample preparation prior the relaxation process .    as has been shown",
    ", the main reason for the breakdown of the energy barrier picture is the dynamical character of thermal activation as a random walk in a spatially distributed energy landscape which , due to the correlations resulting from spatial inhomogeneities in the energy space , renormalizes the energy barriers @xmath0 to eigen - barriers @xmath5 consistent with the probabilistic me dynamics .",
    "only a relative spatial homogeneity of the energy landscape emerging in symmetric structures preserves the validity of the energy barrier picture . to reconcile the discrepancies",
    ", we developed a simple two - state system description introducing the notion of the initial condition dependent energy barrier @xmath150 , which qualitatively captures the behavior of the eigen - barriers @xmath5 .",
    "future work will also explore the effect of non - zero applied magnetic field on the magnetization decay , which is expected to act as a symmetry breaking element controlling the uniformity of the energy landscape and thus , according to the present study , also the applicability of the energy barrier picture .",
    "although the present study could not be extended to bulk systems due to the computational costs , the converging trends with the increasing size @xmath105 seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : struct_fits ] suggest that similar behavior may persist even towards the bulk size , at least in structures with reduced dimensionality .",
    "our study is directly relevant to experimental magnetorelaxometry , which is a basis for biological sensing methodologies  @xcite and in the emerging research field of magnetic particle imaging ( mpi )  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , our findings are also fundamental to interpreting the rate - dependent experiments , such as the field or temperature dependent magnetization or susceptibility measurements , where the blocking temperature dependencies are typically quantified by assuming the energy barrier picture  @xcite . in such cases the description is however more involved because the correlated thermal fluctuation effects further compete with the time scales of external driving forces , which need to be included in the mathematical framework if the full physical interpretation is to be acquired .",
