    "there is an old dream that matter is topological excitations of the geometry of spacetime .",
    "recently it was discovered that this is realized in the context of models of quantum geometry based on spin networks , such as those used in loop quantum gravity and spin foam models@xcite .",
    "although the rough idea that topological features of spacetime qeometry might be interpreted as particles is very old , two questions delayed implementation of the idea till recently .",
    "first , how do we identify an independent excitation or degree of freedom in a background independent quantum theory , where the semiclassical approximation is expected to be unreliable ?",
    "second , why should such excitations be chiral , as any excitations that give rise to the low mass observed fermions must be ?",
    "recently a new approach to the first question was proposed in @xcite , which was to apply the notion of noisefree subsystem from quantum information theory to quantum gravity , and use it to characterize an emergent elementary particle .",
    "the key point is that noiseless subsystems arise when a splitting of the hilbert space of the whole system ( in this case the whole quantum geometry ) into system and environment reveals emergent symmetries that can protect subsystems from decohering as a result of inherently noisy interactions with the environment .",
    "the proposal raised the question of whether there were models of dynamical quantum geometry in which this procedure reproduced at least some of the symmetries of the observed elementary particles .",
    "this led to an answer to the second question .",
    "in @xcite it was shown that this was the case in a simple model of the dynamics of quantum geometry .",
    "the result of that paper incorporated prior results of @xcite where a preon model was coded into a game of braided triplets of ribbons .",
    "the needed ribbon graphs are present in models related to loop quantum gravity when the cosmological constant is non - zero@xcite ; and the three ribbon braids needed are indeed the simplest systems in that model bound by the conservation of topological quantum numbers .",
    "strikingly , the results of @xcite make contact with both structures from topological quantum computing and now classic results of knot theory from the 1980s . in",
    "both chirality plays a key role because braids are chiral and topological invariants associated with braided ribbons are able to detect chirality and code chiral conservation laws .",
    "many questions remained unanswered however .",
    "one was quickly answered in @xcite : can the excitations be considered local in the quantum geometry ?",
    "the answer is that many of the braided excitations can be evolved by local moves to states which can be considered local because they are attached by only a single edge to the rest of the graph representing the quantum geometry of space .",
    "the same paper answered in the affirmative another question : do these excitations propagate ? if the quantum geometry of space can be modeled as a large and complicated spin network graph , @xcite showed that the braids which code the excitations propagate on the larger graph under the local dynamical moves of the model .",
    "however , the results of @xcite suffered from a serious limitation . the conservation laws which preserve the excitations are exact , which means that there can be no creation and annihilation of particles . indeed , as shown by @xcite the braided excitations of @xcite are like solitons in integrable systems : they pass right through each other .",
    "this means that interactions necessary to turn the game coded in @xcite into a real theory of the standard model do not appear to exist in that model .    as a result",
    ", a search has been underway for a modification of the dynamics studied in @xcite which would allow propagation and interactions of emergent chiral matter degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "this is not so easy as many extensions of the local moves studied in @xcite destabalize the braids so that there are no longer any emergent conservation laws .    in this paper",
    "we report on one successful such modification .",
    "this is based on two ideas proposed by markopoulou@xcite .",
    "first extend the graphs in the model from three valent to four valent and base the dynamics on the dual pachner moves naturally associated with four valent graphs .",
    "second , only allow the dual pachner moves when acting on a subgraph which is dual to a triangulation of a trivial ball in @xmath0 .",
    "four - valent graphs and the corresponding dual pachner moves naturally occur in spin foam models@xcite , hence this extends the results on the existence of emergent , chiral degrees of freedom to that much studied case .",
    "as we will show below , the dual pachner moves , with the restriction to duals of triangulations of trivial regions , is exactly right to preserve the stability of certain braid states , while giving some propagation and interactions .",
    "we do not however , in this paper , investigate the correspondence to the preon models of @xcite .    in many studies of spin foam models",
    "the graphs and spin foam histories are taken to be abstract , or unembedded .",
    "our results do not directly apply to these models , as the topological structures our results concern arise from the embedding of the graphs in a topological three manifold . but neither do such models give dynamics for states of loop quantum gravity , which are embedded .",
    "a path integral formulation of loop quantum gravity must give evolution amplitudes to embedded graphs , as those are the states found by quantizing diffeomorphism invariant gauge theories such as general relativity .",
    "we study here two cases of four valent embedded graphs .",
    "the first are framed , which means that the edges are represented by tubes which meet at nodes which are punctured spheres .",
    "if we take the limit where the edges become curves , while the nodes remain punctured spheres we get the unframed case .",
    "one might go further and consider the case in which the nodes are structureless points rather than punctured spheres .",
    "however , in this case the dual pachner moves are not all well defined in the embedded case , so that there can not be an application of spin foam models to amplitudes for such graphs which incorporate dual pachner moves .",
    "the main results of this paper are as follows :    * the dual pachner moves on embedded four valent graphs may be restricted to those that are dual to pachner moves on triangulations of regions of @xmath1 , in such a way that some chiral braid states are locally stable , which means they can not be undone by local moves involving the nodes that comprise them . *",
    "some of those stable chiral braids propagate , in the sense that under the local evolution moves they can exchange places with substructures adjacent to them in the graph .",
    "the propagation in most cases is chiral . in these cases",
    "a braid will propagate along an edge in the larger graph only to the left and its mirror image ( which is a distinct state ) will propagate only to the right .",
    "* results are found which limit the classes of propagating states . * in some cases two braids adjacent to each other in a spin network may merge under the action of the local moves . for this to happen",
    "one of them must be in a small class of states called actively interacting .",
    "we find examples of actively interacting braids , all of which are equivalent to trivial braids with twists .",
    "this is the second of a series of papers in which the conservation , propagation and interactions of four valent spin networks are investigated .",
    "the first paper @xcite contains results on classifications of the relevent braid embeddings and it also establishes our notation . for completeness",
    "we give a summary of the notation and main results of that paper in the next section .",
    "the dynamics is then introduced in section 3 , by giving the allowed set of dual pachner moves by which embedded graphs are allowed to evolve . in section 4",
    "we discuss the local stability of the braids under the equivalence and evolution moves and introduce a quantity that is conserved under both .",
    "section 5 gives examples of braids propagating as well as some results which limit which braids can propagate .",
    "section 7 does the same with interactions .",
    "we work with a graphic calculus which describes 4-valent framed spin - networks embedded in 3-manifolds up to diffeomorphisms .",
    "the graphs represent the networks and their embeddings in terms of two dimensional diagrams which represent projections of the graphs onto a two - plane . as the spin or ,",
    "more generally , representation , representation labels play no role in the results of this paper , they are not indicated in these diagrams .",
    "the notation we use was described in detail in @xcite , in this section we review the notation and the results we will need from that paper .    when using this notation it is important to keep in mind the distinction between braids , which are diffeomorphism equivalence classes of embeddings of diagrams in three dimensional space , and the braid diagrams that represent them .",
    "many braid diagrams will correspond to the same braid , these will be related by a set of equivalence moves .",
    "it will be important also to distinguish these equivalence moves from dynamical moves we introduce in the next section , which take equivalence classes , or braids , to equivalence classes .      in the category of framed graphs",
    "we discuss edges that are represented by tubes and nodes that are represented by 2-spheres with the incident edges attached at circles called punctures .",
    "we consider only four valent nodes which are non - degenerate so that not more than two edges of a node are co - planar .",
    "since we are interested in projections representing graphs up to diffeomorphisms , there is a single diffeomorphism class of nodes . for convenience , the nodes are all represented as rigid and dual to tetrahedra , as shown in fig .",
    "[ notation ] .",
    "we will limit ourselves to projections in which all nodes are in one of the configurations or states shown in fig .",
    "[ notation ] .",
    "because of the freedom to make a diffeomorphism before projecting this can be done without loss of generality .",
    "we note that as shown in fig .",
    "[ notation ] the different such allowed projections are related to each other by rotations of @xmath2 around an axis defined by one of the edges .",
    "as we have noted , the possible states by which a node may be represented in a projection can be taken into each other by @xmath2 rotations around one of the edges . by the local duality of nodes",
    "to tetrahedra , these correspond to the @xmath2 rotations that relate the different ways that two tetrahedra may be glued together on a triangular face .",
    "these rotations cause twists in the edges and , as a result of the restriction on projections of nodes we impose , the twists in a projection of an edge of a graph will be in units of @xmath2 .",
    "this allows a simple representation of twists of edges which is shown in fig .",
    "[ notationtwist](a ) .",
    "we note that the twist indicated in [ notationtwist](a ) is equivalent to that shown in [ notationtwist](b ) .",
    "this provides a way simplifying the notation , as it allows us to label an edge with a right - handed twist by a positive integer ( and left - handed twist by a negative integer ) .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "[ notationtwist](a ) and ( b ) can be replaced by [ notationtwist](c ) without introducing any ambiguity .",
    "most of the results of this paper will refer to the case of framed graphs , defined above .",
    "however , unframed graphs are used in loop quantum gravity and it is useful to have results then for that case as well . to do that we need a particular definition of unframed graphs , which is gotten from the framed case discussed here by dropping information about rotations or twists of the edges , but keeping the nodes as spheres , locally dual to tetrahedra .",
    "this is necessary so that the dual pachner moves are well defined for embedded graphs .",
    "if we drop the resolution of nodes as spheres , and represent them as structureless points which are just intersections of edges , we loose the information as to which pairs of edges at a node are over or under ( in the sense of fig",
    ". [ notation ] ) and the dual pachner moves which will be defined in the next section will no longer well defined .    in the rest of this paper",
    "we refer always to the framed case , unless we explicitly describe results for the unframed case",
    ".      we will be interested in a class of embedded sub - spinnets which consist of two nodes which share three edges which may be braided .",
    "these are defined as braids , whose two dimensional projections are called braid diagrams@xcite .",
    "an example of such a braid diagram is shown in fig .",
    "[ braid ] . in the rest of the paper ,",
    "we use braids for both braids and their braid diagrams , unless an emphasis on braid diagrams is necessary .      as usual",
    "we can assign a number to a crossing according to its chirality , viz @xmath3 for a right - handed crossing , @xmath4 for a left - handed crossing , and @xmath5 otherwise .",
    "[ assignment ]  shows this assignment .",
    "diffeomorphism classes of embedded knots and links are described in terms of two dimensional diagrams which represent projections of the embedded graphs onto a two dimensional plane .",
    "many projections , hence many diagrams , represent the same diffeomorphism equivalence class of an embedded grap . in the case of knots and links without nodes this is reflected in reidemeister s theorem which gives a small number of local moves in the diagrams such that any two diagrams represent the same three dimensional diffeomorphism equivalence class iff they are related by a finite sequence of such moves .    for the class of framed four valent graphs with rigid nodes ,",
    "the reidemeister moves are extended by two classes of moves@xcite .",
    "* translations in which nodes are slid over or under crossings in the diagram , as shown in figures [ translation ] and [ translationx ] .",

    "so the question is , if @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 and 1 can be configured for a @xmath21 move , can we also configure @xmath51 , @xmath52 , and 1 for a @xmath17 move ?",
