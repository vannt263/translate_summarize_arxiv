    "for physical systems , mean - field theory often provides a qualitatively correct description of `` realistic behavior . ''",
    "the corresponding analysis usually begins with the derivation of so called mean - field equations which are self - consistent relations involving the physical quantity of primary interest and the various parameters of the model .",
    "this approach may be realized and , to some extent , justified mathematically by considering the model on the complete graph where each constituent interacts with all others .    as an example , let us consider the ising model on a complete graph  @xmath0 of  @xmath1 vertices .",
    "here we have a collection of  @xmath2-valued random variables  @xmath3 which are distributed according to the probability measure  @xmath4 , where @xmath5 and where  @xmath6 are parameters .",
    "the relevant physical quantity is the _ empirical magnetization _ , @xmath7 . in terms of this quantity , @xmath8 ^ 2-h m_n(\\sigma)$ ] and so @xmath9+o({\\mathchoice     { \\myffrac{1}{n } in \\scriptstyle }      { \\myffrac{1}{n } in \\scriptstyle }      { \\myffrac{1}{n } in \\scriptscriptstyle }      { \\myffrac{1}{n } in \\scriptscriptstyle } } ) .\\ ] ] this permits the following `` cavity argument : '' supposing that  @xmath10 tends , as  @xmath11 , to a value  @xmath12 in probability , we have that @xmath13 obeys @xmath14.\\ ] ] this is the _ mean - field equation _ for the ( empirical ) magnetization .",
    "of course , the concentration of the law of  @xmath10 still needs to be justified ; cf  @xcite for details .    in the context of percolation",
    "@xcite , the relevant mean - field model goes under the name the erds - renyi random graph . here",
    "each edge of  @xmath0 is independently occupied with probability  @xmath15 , where  @xmath16 , and vacant with probability  @xmath17 .",
    "the relevant `` physical '' quantity is the _ giant - component density _",
    "@xmath18 , i.e. , the limiting fraction of the vertices that belong to the giant component of the graph . the corresponding mean - field equation , @xmath19 is also readily derived from heuristic `` cavity '' considerations . as is well known , @xmath20 is the only solution for  @xmath21 , while for  @xmath22 there is another , strictly positive solution .",
    "this solution tends to zero as  @xmath23 ; hence we may speak of a continuous transition .    while ( [ m - tanh - m][1.1 ] ) are indeed straightforward to derive ,",
    "matters at the level of mean - field equations are not always satisfactory ; the problem being the existence multiple solutions .",
    "as it turns out , for the percolation model ( as well as the @xmath24-core percolation ) the proper choice is always the _ maximal _ solution , but prescriptions of this sort generically fail , e.g. , for the ising model with  @xmath25 and , as often as not , whenever there is a first - order transition .",
    "thus , one is in need of an additional principle which determines which of the solutions is relevant .    the existing mathematical approach to these difficulties  e.g .",
    ", for percolation  @xcite , see also  @xcite , or the @xmath24-core  @xcite  is to work with sufficient precision until the mean - field conclusions are rigorously established .",
    "another approach  which admits some prospects of extendability beyond the complete graph  @xcite  is to supplement the picture by the introduction of the _ mean - field free - energy function_. for the ising model , this is a function @xmath26 such that @xmath27 i.e. , @xmath26 is the large - deviation rate function for the probability of observing the event @xmath28 .",
    "this spells the end of the story from the perspective of probability and/or theoretical physics : one seeks the minimum of the free energy function , setting its derivative to zero yields the mean - field equations with the irrelevant solutions corresponding to the local extrema which are not absolute minima ; see again  @xcite .",
    "the free - energy approach to mean - field problems has met with success in ising systems and , to some extent , it has been applied to the potts and random - cluster models  @xcite .",
    "however , no attempt seems to have been made to extend this technology to `` purely geometrical '' problems on the complete graph , specifically , ordinary percolation or  @xmath24-core percolation .",
    "the purpose of this note is to derive the large - deviation rate function for the event that the random graph contains a fraction  @xmath29 of vertices in `` large '' components .",
    "as we will see , the function has a unique minimum for all  @xmath30 which coincides with the `` correct '' solution of .",
    "we do not necessarily claim that the resultant justification of this equation is easier than which already exists in the literature .",
    "however , the picture presented here provides some additional insights into the model while the overall approach indeed admits the possibility of generalizations .",
    "consider the set of vertices  @xmath31 and let  @xmath32 be a collection of i.i.d .",
    "random variables taking value one with probability  @xmath33 and zero with probability  @xmath34 .",
    "let  @xmath35 be the ( random ) set  @xmath36 . in accord with the standard notation , cf  @xcite , we will use  @xmath37 to denote the undirected graph with vertices  @xmath38 and edges  @xmath39 . of particular interest",
    "are the cases where  @xmath33 decays to zero proportionally to  @xmath40 .",
    "since these are the only problems we will consider , let us set , for once and all , @xmath41 for some fixed  @xmath42 .",
    "we will denote the requisite probability measure by  @xmath43 .    in order to state our main theorems",

    "finally , let us also define @xmath49 -(1-\\varrho)\\psi\\bigl(\\alpha(1-\\varrho)\\bigr ) .",

    "then for every  @xmath53 $ ] , @xmath54    an inspection of lemma  [ cor6.2 ] reveals that , conditional on @xmath55 , with  @xmath56 , there will be only one `` large '' component with probability tending to one as  @xmath11 .",
    "1 shows the graph of  @xmath57 for various values of  @xmath30 which is archetypal of free - energy functions in complete graph setting .",
    "the figure indicates a unique global minimum ; direct , albeit arduous differentiation of yields the fact that all local extrema satisfy the mean - field equation  .",
    "the extremum at  @xmath58 is ruled out for  @xmath48 by noting that , under these conditions , the last term in is strictly positive .    the corresponding conclusion may also be extracted from the following probabilistic argument : let  @xmath59 and note that  @xmath60 is then the exponential growth - rate of  @xmath61 .",
    "this allows us to write @xmath62^m \\bigl[1-\\pi_1(\\alpha\\varrho)\\bigr]^{n - m } \\,{\\text{\\rm e}}^{(n - m)\\psi(\\alpha(1-\\varrho))}.\\ ] ] neglecting the  @xmath63-term ( which provides a lower bound on  @xmath57 ) , one sees a quantity reminiscent of binomial distribution .",
    "well known results on the latter inform us that the right - hand side is exponentially small unless @xmath64 i.e. , unless  @xmath29 satisfies the mean - field equation  .",
    "if  @xmath63 is set to zero , there are degenerate minima for  @xmath48 ; however , the @xmath63-function will lift the degeneracy and , in fact , create a local _ maximum _ at  @xmath58 once  @xmath48 .",
    "meanwhile , in the region of the maximal solution , @xmath63 has vanished and the above mentioned approximation is exact .",
    "\\(1 ) a closely - related , but different problem to the one treated above has previously been studied using large - deviation techniques .",
    "indeed , in  @xcite , oconnell derived the large - deviation rate function for the event that the _ largest _ connected component is of size about  @xmath65 .",
    "note , however , that this does not restrict the total volume occupied by these component . for  @xmath66 close to  @xmath18 from explicitly ,",
    "as long as the complement of the large component has effective  @xmath30 less than  @xmath67oconnell s rate function coincides with ours .",
    "but once  @xmath66 is sufficiently small , his conditioning will lead to the creation of several large components whose total volume is such that their complement is effectively subcritical .",
    "consequently , oconnell never needs to address the central issue of our proof ; namely , the decay rate of the probability that supercritical percolation has no giant components .",
    "( this is what gives rise to the term  @xmath63 in and the dashed portion of the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] . ) in fact , his rate function is basically a concatenation of many scaled copies of the undashed portion of the graph in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] .",
    "\\(2 ) while the @xmath63-term in has a non - trivial effect on the large - deviation questions studied here , it does not play any role for events whose probability is of order unity ( or is subexponential in  @xmath1 ) .",
    "this is because @xmath63 `` kicks in '' only for @xmath29 away from the minimizing value .",
    "this is not the case for the @xmath24-core where the corresponding large - deviation analysis  @xcite suggests that the analogous term `` kicks in '' right at the minimizer and may even affect the fluctuation scales .",
    "one way to bring  @xmath63 out of the `` realm of exponentially - improbable '' for percolation would be to give each configuration a weight suppressing large components .",
    "however , we will not pursue these matters in the present note .",
    "\\(3 ) our control of the rate function is not sharp enough to provide a detailed description of the critical region , i.e. , the situations when @xmath68 .",
    "the corresponding analysis of the scaling phenomena inside the `` critical window '' has been performed in  @xcite . on the other hand , for  @xmath48",
    "one should be able to sharpen the control of the rate function near its minimum to derive a clt for the fluctuations of the size of the giant component .",
    "several ingredients enter our proof of theorem  [ thm - main ] which are of independent interest .",
    "we state these as separate theorems .",
    "the first one concerns the exponential decay rate for the probability that the random - graph is ( completely ) connected :    [ thm - connected ] let  @xmath69 denote the event that @xmath70 is connected .",
    "then @xmath71 where  @xmath72 is bounded by a constant times @xmath73 uniformly on compact sets of  @xmath42 .",
    "we remark that theorem  [ thm - connected ] holds with  @xmath74 replaced by  @xmath75 , see  @xcite for a proof .",
    "however , the requisite steps seem far in excess of the derivation in sect .  [ sec3 ] .",
    "furthermore , various pieces of theorem  [ thm - connected ] have been discovered , apparently multiple times , in  @xcite ; cf also the discussion following lemma  [ lemma3.3 ] .",
    "next we present a result concerning the event that  @xmath70 contains no cycles .",
    "such problems have been extensively studied under the conditions where this probability is  @xmath76 , see e.g.  @xcite .",
    "our theorem concerns the large - deviation properties of this event :    [ thm - only - trees ] let  @xmath77 be the event that  @xmath70 contains no cycles .",
    "then @xmath78    strictly speaking , this result is not needed for the proof of our main theorem ; it is actually used to derive the exponential decay for the probability of the event that  @xmath70 contains only `` small '' components .",
    "surprisingly , the decay rates for these two events are exactly the same :    [ thm - only - small ] let  @xmath77 be the event that  @xmath70 contains no cycles and let  @xmath79 be the event that there are no components larger than  @xmath52 . then @xmath80    _ update _ : in the present paper we prove theorem  [ thm - only - trees ] using enumeration and generating - function techniques .",
    "recently , a probabilistic approach has been developed by which we obtain an expansion of @xmath81 to quantities of order unity .",
    "one advantage of the new approach is that it also permits the analysis of the conditional measure @xmath82 ; see  @xcite .",
    "to finish the discussion of our results , let us give some reason for the word `` thermodynamic '' in the title .",
    "the motivation comes from an analogy with droplet formation in systems at phase transition .",
    "such situations have been studied extensively in the context of percolation  @xcite and ising ( and potts ) model  @xcite under the banner of `` wulff construction , '' see  @xcite for a review of these matters .",
    "one of the principal questions underlying wulff construction is as follows : compute the probability  and the characteristics of typical configurations carrying the event  that a given fraction of the system is in one thermodynamic state ( e.g. , liquid ) while the rest is in another state ( e.g. , gas ) .",
    "it turns out that the typical configurations are such that the two phases separate ; a droplet of one phase `` floats '' in the other phase . the requisite probability is then given by a large - deviation expression whose rate function is composed of three parts : the `` surface '' energy and entropy of the droplet , the rate function for the probability that the droplet is all in one phase , and the rate function for the probability that the complement of the droplet is in the other phase .    in the case under study ,",
    "the droplet is exactly the giant component and its weight is just the probability that all vertices in the droplet are connected to each other . the `` surface '' energy is ( the  log of ) the probability that no vertex inside is connected to no vertex outside ; the entropy is ( the log of ) the number of ways to choose the corresponding number of sites .",
    "the weight of the phase outside simply amounts to the probability that all remaining components are of submacroscopic scale . when the leading - order exponential decay rate of all of these contributions is extracted using theorems  [ thm - connected][thm - only - small ] , we get a quantity that only depends on the fraction of vertices taken by the droplet .",
    "the resulting expression is the one on the right - hand side of .",
    "the goal of this section is to prove theorem  [ thm - connected ] .",
    "our proof is based on showing that the probability in   is exactly the same probability in a related , directed graph problem .",
    "for a collection of vertices  @xmath83 and a set of edge probabilities  @xmath84 , let  @xmath85 be the inhomogeneous undirected random graph over  @xmath86 .",
    "similarly , let  @xmath87 denote the inhomogeneous _ directed _ complete random graph with the restriction that the two possible ( directed ) edges between  @xmath24 and  @xmath88 occur independently , each with probability  @xmath89 .",
    "to keep our notation distinct from the special case  @xmath90 treated throughout this paper , we will write  @xmath91 instead of  @xmath43 .    a labelled directed graph @xmath92 is said to be _ grounded _ at vertex @xmath93 if for every @xmath94 there exists a ( directed ) path from @xmath95 to @xmath96 in @xmath39 .",
    "the identification of the two problems is now stated as follows :    [ lemma3.2a ] let  @xmath69 be the event that @xmath85 is connected and let  @xmath97 be the event that @xmath98 is grounded at vertex  `` @xmath67 . ''",
    "then @xmath99 .",
    "proof we use induction on the total number of edges incident with vertex  `` @xmath1 . '' indeed , if  @xmath100 for all  @xmath101 , then  @xmath102 because both probabilities are zero .",
    "now let us suppose that @xmath99 when  @xmath103 for all  @xmath104 and let us prove that it also for  @xmath105 .",
    "it clearly suffices to show that the partial derivatives of  @xmath106 and  @xmath107 with respect to  @xmath108 are equal for all  @xmath109 $ ] .",
    "notice first that both  @xmath69 and  @xmath97 are increasing events . invoking russo s formula ,",
    "@xcite or  ( * ? ? ?",
    "* theorem  2.25 ) , we obtain @xmath110 where the event @xmath111 means that if  @xmath112 is occupied , the event  @xmath97 occurs and if not , it does not . (",
    "note that  @xmath112 denotes the edge going from  `` @xmath1 '' to  `` @xmath24 . '' ) the conditions under which this event occurs are straightforward : the set @xmath83 splits into two disjoint components , one rooted at  `` @xmath67 '' and the other at  `` @xmath1 , '' such that no vertex in the component associated with vertex  `` @xmath1 '' has an oriented edge to the other component and  @xmath24 has an oriented path to  @xmath67 .",
    "similarly , we have @xmath113 here  @xmath114 simply means that , if the edge  @xmath112 is absent ,  @xmath86 consist of two connected components , one containing  `` @xmath67 '' and the other containing  `` @xmath1 . ''    to see the equality of partial derivatives , we split both `` pivotal '' events according to the component containing the vertex  `` @xmath1 . ''",
    "if  @xmath115 is a set of vertices such that  @xmath116 and  @xmath117 , let  @xmath118 and  @xmath119 be the restrictions of  @xmath85 to  @xmath115 , and @xmath120 , respectively . similarly , let  @xmath121 and  @xmath122 be the corresponding `` components '' of the oriented graph .",
    "let  @xmath123 and @xmath124 be the events that  @xmath118 and  @xmath119 are connected and let  @xmath125 and @xmath126 be the events that  @xmath121 is grounded at  `` @xmath1 '' and that  @xmath122 is grounded at  `` @xmath67 , '' respectively .",
    "since these pairs of events are independent , we have @xmath127 where  @xmath128 is the event that no vertex in  @xmath115 has a ( directed ) edge to  @xmath120 . but the induction assumption tells us that  @xmath129 and  @xmath130 , and the symmetry of edge probabilities for the directed graph tells us that  @xmath131 is the probability that  @xmath118 , and  @xmath119 are not connected by an edge in  @xmath85 .",
    "substituting these into , we get the right - hand side of .",
    "this completes the induction step .    from now on , let  @xmath69 and  @xmath97 pertain to the specific random graphs  @xmath70 and  @xmath132 .",
