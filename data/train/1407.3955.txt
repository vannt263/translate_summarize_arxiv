    "the amount and distribution of dark matter relative to stars is a crucial probe of early - type galaxy structure . in particular , changes in the dark matter fraction with radius",
    "provide important information about the mechanisms of galaxy formation and the interaction of dark and baryonic matter during the initial collapse ( including processes like baryonic cooling , settling , star formation and feedback ) and subsequent mergers ( see diemand & moore 2011 for a review ) .    but",
    "measuring this dark matter fraction is difficult .",
    "existing estimates use x - ray observations , stellar dynamics or gravitational lensing , and each of these methods has its own advantages and difficulties .",
    "x - ray observations of the hot gas in massive galaxies can provide an estimate of the total mass under the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium ( see buote & humphrey , 2012 ) .",
    "this method is very robust and simple , with its main uncertainties coming from the robustness of the hydrostatic equilibrium hypothesis , the possibility of non - thermal contributions to the pressure and contamination from emission by larger scale group / cluster halo gas .",
    "stellar dynamics can also be used to estimate the structure of the gravitational potential ( see for example courteau et al",
    ". 2014 ) . in this case , the structure of the orbits ( anisotropy ) is the primary source of uncertainty . with both x - ray and stellar dynamics",
    "it is difficult to extend the measurements to large radii .",
    "gravitational lensing is also a very powerful probe of dark matter because it provides direct measurements of the total mass of the system ( within a certain radius ) regardless of whether it is dark or baryonic . on large scales ,",
    "weak lensing can be used to estimate the mass distribution in the outer parts of halos .",
    "such studies have shown that the mass profiles at those radii are consistent with the navarro , frenk & white ( 1997 ) ( hereafter nfw ) or einasto ( 1965 ) profiles predicted by simulations ( e.g. mandelbaum , seljak & irata 2008 ) .",
    "the inner regions of galaxies are more complex , as baryons influence the mass profile and can make the halos significantly steeper ( blumenthal et al .",
    "1986 , gnedin et al .",
    "2004 ) . in these inner regions ,",
    "strong lensing can be used to robustly estimate the total galaxy mass within the einstein radius of the lens ( typically 1 - 2 effective radii ) .",
    "indeed , this estimate of the total projected mass inside the einstein radius of the lens galaxy is very robust , and depends very weakly on the specific lens model ( i.e. on the specific radial profile or the angular structure of the lens ) and this can be used to statistically constrain the structure of galaxies ( rusin & kochanek 2005 ) .",
    "the radial mass distribution can be constrained if additional or extended images exist ( e.g. sonnenfeld et al . 2012 ) , or by combining lensing with stellar dynamics ( e.g. romanowsky & kochanek 1999 , koopmans et al .",
    "however , dividing the measured mass between dark matter and stars is more difficult , as it requires a model of the stellar mass .",
    "photometry , in combination with stellar population synthesis ( that can provide an estimate for the stellar m / l ratio ) can be used to estimate the stellar mass distribution ( see for example jiang & kochanek 2007 , auger et al . 2009 , tortora et al .",
    "2010 , leier et al .",
    "2011 , oguri et al .",
    "nevertheless , in this procedure there is always a great uncertainty due to the imf of the stars , particularly given recent arguments in favour of `` bottom heavy '' and variable imfs ( van dokkum & conroy 2010 , 2011 ; conroy & van dokkum 2012 ) .",
    "examples of lensing studies are rusin & kochanek ( 2005 ) , koopmans et al .",

    "( 2014 ) , and these studies generally find that the integrated dark matter fraction inside the einstein radius is roughly 0.3 - 0.7",
    ". estimates of the local value at the einstein radius are more model dependent .",
    "microlensing of the images of gravitationally lensed quasars provides a direct means of measuring the dark matter fraction at the location of the lensed images .",
    "microlensing is caused by the granularities in the mass distribution created by stars and their remnants which induce time dependent changes in the flux of the lensed quasar images ( see the review by wambsganss , 2006 ) .",
    "at any instant , they produce flux ratio anomalies that can not be accounted for by the smooth macro model of the lens .",
    "particularly when the stars are only a small fraction of the surface mass density , microlensing is very sensitive to the relative fractions of stars and dark matter near the images ( e.g. schechter & wambsganss , 2004 ) .",
    "we can therefore estimate the local fraction of mass in stars or dark matter from the statistics of microlensing .",
    "recently , this effect has also been used to calibrate the stellar mass fundamental plane by schechter et al .",
    "( 2014 ) .",
    "the main practical difficulty of this method resides in the determination of the flux anomalies generated by microlensing .",
    "the problem is that the anomalies are usually identified assuming that a standard macrolens model can be used as an absolute `` flux ratio '' reference , without contamination by differential extinction ( e.g. falco et al .",
    "1999 , muoz et al . 2004 ) or perturbations from substructures in the lens ( e.g. dalal & kochanek 2002 , keeton et al .",
    "one solution is to use emission line ratios , which are little affected by microlensing ( e.g. , guerras et al . 2013 ) , as a baseline to remove the effects of the macro - magnification , extinction and substructure ( mediavilla et al .",
    "2009 , hereafter med09 ) .",
    "there remains the problem of intrinsic source variability modulated by the lens time delays as a contribution of apparent flux anomalies . at optical wavelengths ,",
    "the amplitude of quasar variability on timescales of the order of the time delays between images is rather modest , and should be a source of some extra noise rather than a significant bias on the results ( see the discussion in med09 ) .",
    "to date , there have been two microlensing studies of the stellar mass fraction using ensembles of lenses , and they obtained similar values for the fraction of mass in stars .",
    "med09 , using optical flux ratios of 29 images in 20 lenses , found a stellar surface density of 5% , and pooley et al .",
    "( 2012 ) , using x - ray flux ratios of images in 14 lenses , found a fraction of 7% near the einstein radius of the lenses . a third study based on microlensing for only three lenses by bate et al .",
    "( 2011 ) found much higher values , in the range 20% to 100% .",
    "there are also several microlensing results for individual lenses that usually favour dark matter dominated galaxies with stellar fractions at the image positions roughly in the range 8 - 25% ( keeton et al .",
    "2006 , kochanek et al . 2006 , morgan et al . 2008 , chartas et al . 2009 , pooley et al .",
    "2009 , dai et al .",
    "2010b , morgan et al .",
    "the exception to this rule is the lens q2237 + 0305 , where microlensing is dominated by bulge stars and is therefore compatible with nearly 100% of the surface mass density in form of stars ( kochanek 2004 , bate et al .",
    "2011 , pooley et al . 2012 ) .",
    "these estimates are somewhat larger than the microlensing estimates from lens samples by med09 and pooley et al .",
    "while it is not straightforward to compare local and integrated values for the stellar mass fractions , there also seems to be an apparent discrepancy between the low local values of 0.05 - 0.07 determined by the microlensing samples and the ( integrated ) values of 0.3 - 0.7 estimated by other means .",
    "the studies of microlensing in individual lenses are largely focussed on measuring the sizes of quasar emission regions , with the dark matter fraction as a `` nuisance '' parameter , so the source size is included as an unknown in the calculations , while the two large statistical microlensing studies ( med09 , pooley et al .",
    "2012 ) were done under the hypothesis that the size of the source is very small compared to the einstein radii of the microlenses . at the time of these studies",
    ", it seemed plausible that source sizes were small enough to be neglected , although med09 did point out that there was a clear covariance in the sense that larger source sizes lead to larger stellar mass fractions .",

    "similarly , quasar size estimates are also dependent on the fraction of mass in microlenses . here",
    ", we carry out a joint analysis of both . in section 2",
    "we describe the statistical analysis of the data based on microlensing simulations using magnification maps . in section 3",
    "we compare the results with previous studies and discuss the possible implications .",
    "we use the microlensing magnification estimates for 27 quasar image pairs in 19 lens systems from med09 . in order to have the largest possible sample but",
    "with a similar range of observed rest wavelengths , we include all objects from med09 with magnifications measured in the wavelength range between @xmath3 ( 1216  ) and mg ii ( 2798 ).with this choice , the average rest wavelength is @xmath4  , while we still keep 27 out of 29 image pairs from 19 out of 20 lensed quasars .",
    "only the system rxs j1131@xmath51231 is excluded , as it was observed in [ oiii ] , at a much larger wavelength of @xmath65000  .",
    "these microlensing magnification estimates are calculated after subtracting the emission line flux ratios , which are little affected by microlensing ( see e.g. guerras et al .",
    "2013 ) , from the continuum flux ratios , and are therefore virtually free from extinction , substructure and macro model effects ( as these affect the line and continuum flux ratios equally ) .",
    "our strategy is to compare the observed microlensing magnification for a given image pair @xmath7 with a statistical sample of simulated values for that measurement as a function of the source size ( @xmath8 ) and the fraction of surface mass density in stars ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "this will allow us to calculate the likelihood of the parameters @xmath10 given the observations @xmath11 .",

    "<S> we present a joint estimate of the stellar / dark matter mass fraction in lens galaxies and the average size of the accretion disk of lensed quasars from microlensing measurements of 27 quasar image pairs seen through 19 lens galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the bayesian estimate for the fraction of the surface mass density in the form of stars is @xmath0 near the einstein radius of the lenses ( @xmath1 effective radii ) . </S>",
    "<S> the estimate for the average accretion disk size is @xmath2 light days . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of mass in stars at these radii is significantly larger than previous estimates from microlensing studies assuming quasars were point - like . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding local dark matter fraction of 79% is in good agreement with other estimates based on strong lensing or kinematics . </S>",
    "<S> the size of the accretion disk inferred in the present study is slightly larger than previous estimates . </S>"
