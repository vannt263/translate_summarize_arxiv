    "junctions consisting of a single organic molecule between two metallic leads hold great promise for future nanoscale devices , where their potential applications include switches , transistors , and sensors .",
    "experimentally , it has proved difficult to control their production in an atomistic manner , and so theoretical studies are crucial for a full understanding of their behaviour .",
    "it is known that inelastic effects play an important role in the behaviour of such devices @xcite , but as yet we lack a full understanding of the processes at play that will lead to a complete interpretation of experimental results .    in this paper",
    ", we use a model - system nanojunction including electron - vibration coupling @xcite in order to determine , by investigating the whole parameter space , what level of diagrammatic expansion is appropriate to describe the electron - vibration interaction in such junctions . we cover the entire parameter space , thus accounting for all the physical analogues to our model .",
    "the parameters we can vary correspond to the lead - molecule - lead coupling , the electron - vibron coupling strength , and the resonance of the electronic level with the leads electronic states    in general , an organic molecule - based nanojunction is unlikely to have its homo or lumo levels in alignment with the equilibrium fermi level of the leads , and so such a nanojunction will be dominated by what we term the off - resonant regime with strong tunneling at low bias .",
    "moreover , coupling between the leads and the central molecule is likely to be relatively weak , in the sense that the corresponding coupling to the leads is much smaller than the corresponding hopping integrals in the leads themselves .",
    "conversely , a system consisting of a nanoconstriction in a gold wire will have electronic levels in the constriction that are close to those of the leads , and a larger coupling between the central region and the leads , closer to the tight - binding hopping parameter of the leads",
    ".    this work will distinguish between these regimes and discuss for which physical systems diagrams beyond the self - consistent born approximation ( scba ) become relevant for electron - phonon coupling .",
    "we study this using a full non - equilibrium greens - function ( negf ) technique @xcite which allows us to study all the different transport regimes in the presence of electron - vibron  interaction . following the spirit of many - body perturbation theory and feynman diagrammatics",

    "[ ] . in this work we studied the equilibrium and non - equilibrium electronic structures of the nanojunctions in the presence of electron - vibron  coupling .",
    "in the present paper , we now give and analyse results for the full non - equilibrium transport properties , namely the non - linear @xmath0 characteristics , the conductance @xmath1 , and especially the iets signal @xmath2 calculated with our negf code .",
    "the paper is structured as follows . in section [ sec : theory ] we summarize the key aspect of our methodology detailed in ref . [ ] .",
    "results for the effects of the second order diagrams on the non - equilibrium non - linear transport properties are presented in section [ sec : results ] .",
    "they are separated into the features we observe for the purely inelastic effects in the iets signal at bias equal to an integer multiple of the vibron energy , and for the inelastic resonant features related to the vibron replica of the electronic resonances .",
    "our conclusions are given in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in addition , we explain in detail in appendix [ sec : appendix - vertex ] how one of the second - order diagrams acts as a vertex correction to the fock - like electron - vibron  diagram .",
    "a fully atomistic description of the non - equilibrium inelastic transport properties we wish to study is , unfortunately , beyond the reach of current _ ab initio _ methods .",
    "instead we use a model system which retains the essential physics of the junction while reducing the calculations to a tractable size .",
    "a full description of both the model and our methodology is given in ref .",
    "[ ] , and so we review only the most salient features here .",
    "we use the single - site single - mode model ( sssm),in which the central molecule of the junction is represented by a single molecular level coupled to a single vibrational mode . we have already used this model and discussed its validity in our previous study on the equilibrium and non - equilibrium electronic structures of such a system coupled to two electron reservoirs @xcite .",
    "the total hamiltonian for the nanojunction is given by @xmath3 in this work , we represent the hamiltonian of the left ( @xmath4 ) and right ( @xmath5 ) leads @xmath6 with a non - interacting tight - binding model with semi - elliptic bands , although in principle it can take any valid form .",
    "the hopping between leads and the central region is given by @xmath7 , where @xmath8 is the hopping integral between the @xmath9 lead and the central region .",
    "the central region contains the electron - vibron interactions .",
    "we choose that an electron couples linearly , via its density , to the displacement of a single vibration mode .",
    "the hamiltonian for the central region in the sssm model is then given by @xmath10 where @xmath11 ( @xmath12 ) creates ( annihilates ) an electron in the molecular level @xmath13 , which is coupled to the vibration mode of energy @xmath14 via the coupling constant @xmath15 .",
    "a detailed analysis of the formalism of the non - equilibrium transport properties from negf and for interacting system is provided in ref .",
    "the current @xmath16 passing through each lead @xmath17 is expressed in terms of two time green s functions@xcite .",
    "it is transformed into frequency representation for the steady - state regime to give : @xmath18 we vary the applied bias by moving the chemical potentials of the left and right leads . with the equilibrium",

    "the second , which we call the double - exchange ( dx ) diagram ( fig .",

    "we use these diagrams to construct expressions for the electron - vibron self - energy @xcite as the ( total or partial ) sum of each diagram : @xmath33 .    note that in order to handle numerically sharply peaked functions or strongly discontinuous functions ,",
    "we have found it necessary to include a very small but finite imaginary part in our expression for the bare vibron green s function @xcite .",
    "this also allows us to perform calculations with a smaller number of @xmath34-grid points , as long as our imaginary part @xmath35 in the bare vibron green s function is around two to three times the @xmath34-grid spacing .",
    "we have already discussed in detail the effects of the corresponding extra broadening on the lineshape of the spectral functions and on the values of the linear conductance in ref .",
    "in this section we present the effects of the second - order diagrams on the full non - equilibrium transport properties of the nanojunction in the presence of electron - vibron  coupling .",

    "in addition we have performed non - self - consistent second - order corrections , i.e. by using the scba green s functions  to calculate the second - order diagrams , we then determine the new green s functions  without full self - consistency .",

    "the inelastic properties of the system are present in the current @xmath0 but are better represented by the second derivative of the current @xmath2 as it is the signal that is directly measured experimentally in the form of the inelastic electron tunneling spectrum ( iets)@xcite",
    ".    the iets curves present features , peaks or dips @xcite at biases corresponding to the energy of a specific excitation , in our case to the energy of one or several excitations of the vibration mode .",
    "the peak feature is commonly associated with the opening of a new inelastic channel for the conductance of nanojunctions in the off - resonant regime , i.e.  when the electronic level @xmath13 is sufficiently far from the equilibrium fermi level . in the case of the resonant transport regime ( when @xmath13 is close to @xmath36 ) , a dip feature is obtained in the iets .",
    "it is associated with electron - vibron  backscattering effects and a decrease in the conductance at the threshold bias .",
    "furthermore , being the derivative of the conductance , the iets curves also present features at biases corresponding to peaks in the conductance .",
    "we have found @xcite that in order to get a better aspect ratio for the iets features corresponding to vibron excitations , it is more convenient to normalize the iets curves by the dynamical conductance , i.e.  @xmath37/[di / dv]=d / dv \\ln g(v)$ ] as in refs .  .",
    "we divide our results into two sections ; the first for purely inelastic features , and the second for inelastic features associated with the electron resonance effects .",
    "the first category corresponds to features observed in the iets signal at bias equal to an integer multiple of the vibron energy @xmath38 , i.e. a tunneling electron excites @xmath39 vibrons .",

    "we consider first of all the off - resonant regime . in this limit",
    "the iets features associated with inelastic resonant tunneling are sufficiently far ( or sufficiently small for the higher vibron replica ) from the inelastic feature at @xmath42 .",

    "as @xmath8 is increased , the iets signal decreases in overall magnitude , although the feature at @xmath14 itself remains clear ( fig .",
    "[ fig : w0peak ] inset ) .    in the off - resonant regime",
    ", we do not find any difference to the curves when the second - order dressed - phonon ( dph ) diagram is included .",
    "possible reasons for this are discussed in section [ sec : electron - resonance ] .",
    "we also note that the results are dependent on the symmetry of the potential drops at the left and right contact . as shown in the separate panels of fig .",
    "[ fig : w0peak ] , the curves for symmetric potential drops have a much lower baseline than for the asymmetric potential drops , although the inelastic features have the same lineshape , position and magnitude ( see figs .  [",
    "fig : w0peak ] , [ fig : scba+dx ] and [ fig : iets_badx_andfit ] ) .",
    "this is because ( for positive bias ) in the asymmetric case , @xmath25 is rising bias while @xmath24 is kept fixed at its equilibrium value .",
    "thus @xmath25 is approaching the electron resonance twice as fast as in the symmetric case , where @xmath25 rises at the same rate as @xmath24 falls .",
    "the symmetric case therefore contains much less effect from the tail of the main electron resonance , and allows us to further isolate the purely inelastic part of the iets signal .",
    "we now consider the effect of the double - exchange diagram ( fig .",
    "[ fig : dph - dx ] right ) on the inelastic peak at @xmath14 .",
    "calculation of @xmath50 is extremely computationally intensive , as it can be reduced neither to a simple convolution product , nor even to a simple double - convolution product @xcite .",
    "calculations for the integration in the energy representation of the green s functions  and the self - energies  scale as the cube of the number @xmath51 of points in the energy - grid @xcite .",
    "moreover , as the finite imaginary part @xmath35 we have included in the vibron green s function causes extra broadening , if taken too large it washes out much of the effect of the dx diagram . in order to decrease @xmath35",
    "we need to increase the number of grid points , and thus , even for our minimal model , a fully self - consistent calculation of the double - exchange diagram becomes intractable with @xmath52 .",

    "we see that the effect of dx can also be reproduced with a scba calculation in which we increase the value of @xmath15 .",

    "however their effects are non - negligible , and are important for the full understanding of the spectroscopic information conveyed by the iets signal .",
    "the effect of the dressed - phonon ( dph ) diagram is more important in the bias regions where one of the leads chemical potentials begins to impinge upon the electron resonance or one of its vibron replica ( i.e. for resonant inelastic features ) .",
    "its effect is reduced both by increasing the lead - molecule - lead coupling and/or reducing the electron - vibron interaction .",
    "the renormalization of the vibron propagator ( dph ) has been shown to be strongly dependent on the self - consistency of the calculations .",
    "it would be interesting now to study the effects of the full series of the electron - hole bubble on the renormalised vibron propagator ( i.e. full @xmath32-like diagram ) .",
    "the double - exchange diagram ( dx ) affects all the features in the iets signal ( i.e. resonant inelastic features and purely inelastic features at @xmath108 ) .",
    "the corrections are small in the weak - to - medium electron - vibron  coupling because they are of the order of @xmath109 .",
    "however we have shown , numerically and analytically , that the effect of dx is similar to a dynamical renormalization of one vertex in the fock - like diagram .",
    "more interestingly , the complex form of the non - equilibrium dynamical renormalized electron - vibron coupling @xmath110 we have derived analytically can be adequately replaced in our iets calculations by a single static renormalized parameter @xmath61 .",
    "this important result leads us to believe that the second - order dx calculations , which are extremely costly in computing time even for our model system , can be incorporated in calculations for realistic systems by an appropriate renormalization of the vertex in a low - computing - cost scba calculation .",
    "in appendix a of ref . [ ] we have given all the details for the derivations of the first- and second - order electron - vibron self - energies . in this section",
    "we show how the second - order double - exchange ( dx ) diagram can be recast in an effective first - order fock - like diagram with a renormalized vertex .",
    "we recall that for the sssm model , the fock and dx self - energies defined on the keldysh contour @xmath111 are given by @xmath112 and @xmath113 the dx self - energy can be rewritten as an effective fock - like diagram after introducing a renormalized electron - vibron  coupling parameter @xmath114 and the vertex function @xmath115 : @xmath116 with @xmath117 and where the vertex function is given by @xmath118    the above expression for the vertex function is compatible with the second - order expansion of the electron - vibron  interaction .",
    "a generalization of the vertex function ( see fock - like diagram in figure [ fig : dx - feynman - mod ] ) to all orders of the interaction is possible , though beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "note that at the lowest order , the renormalized electron - vibron  coupling parameter would be given by @xmath119 with @xmath120 .",
    "hence eq.([eq : dxse_onck ] ) would simply be transformed eq.([eq : fockse_onck ] ) as expected .    using the rules of analytical continuation on the real - time branches given in appendix a of paper ref .",
    "[ ] , we find the different components of the self - energies . then after taking the fourier transform of the different quantities in the steady - state limit , i.e. @xmath121 , we find the following expression for the different components of the energy - dependent self - energies :        ( the index @xmath125 labels the branch of the keldysh time - loop contour @xmath111 and are related to the usual convention : time - ordered ( @xmath126 ) , anti time - ordered ( @xmath127 ) , greater ( @xmath128 ) and lesser ( @xmath129 ) components . )    because all the quantities are originally defined on @xmath111 and because the vertex function is a 3-point ( 3 times ) function , the non - equilibrium dynamical renormalized electron - vibron  coupling is a complex function of three indices @xmath130 and of two energy variables .",
    "such a dynamical renormalization ( including non - equilibrium conditions ) is much more complicated than a simple static renormalization of the electron - vibron  constant coupling @xmath131 .    in our analysis of the iets signal in the off - resonant transport regime",
    ", we try to keep the interpretation of the results as simple as possible , and we show that the renormalization of the iets signal due to the dx diagram can be fairly well approximated by a simple static renormalization of the coupling constant @xmath15 for applied bias around the vibration frequency @xmath132 ."
