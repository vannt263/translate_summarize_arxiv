    "coronal mass ejections ( cmes ) are one of the most powerful energy release phenomena in the solar atmosphere . after such events ,",
    "coronal dimmings usually appear as regions of temporary lowered intensity in coronal lines , near the erupting active region .",
    "the fainter emission is interpreted in terms of density decrease , as it is usually observed in several temperature regimes , and is usually linked to the coronal mass removal that follows the eruption @xcite .",
    "spectroscopic studies showed that coronal dimmings are associated with large outflows with speeds of tens of kilometers per second lasting several hours @xcite . using the euv imaging spectrometer ( eis , * ? ? ? * ) on board the _ hinode _ spacecraft , many observations revealed that strong outflows occurring in low - intensity regions were also associated with larger line widths than in the surrounding area ( e.g. * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "@xcite suggest that these wide profiles may be due to turbulence or to the addition of several components having different intrinsic velocities .",
    "they even note that some profiles show secondary components that make the profile depart from a pure gaussian profile . according to @xcite and @xcite",
    ", the broadening is due to the growth of alfvn wave amplitude in the magnetically open and rarefied region of a dimming .",
    "all these studies stress the possible connection between the solar wind and the observed outflows .    from a theoretical point of view , both interpretations are possible .",
    "the corona is optically thin for most coronal emission lines .",
    "the observed lines are then the result of integration along the line of sight ( los ) and on scales smaller than the spatial resolution scales .",
    "this includes different layers having temperatures close to that of maximum formation of the line and also different magnetic flux tubes having differing plasma parameters .",
    "but integration is also done over the exposure time .",
    "therefore , alfvn waves and inhomogeneities of flows both produce spatial and temporal variations of doppler velocities , which results in an apparent broadening of the integrated profile .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to investigate the distortion of the line profiles to distinguish between both interpretations .",
    "different methods can be used to quantify the presence of additional components in line profiles .",
    "for example , @xcite use a coefficient they call `` additional component contribution to the line broadening '' , that makes use of the coefficients of a two - gaussian fit that they apply in cases where the reduced chi - square ( @xmath0 ) of the single - component fit is larger than @xmath1 .",
    "@xcite evaluate the asymmetry by first finding the center of the line with a gaussian fit , then calculating the difference of counts in symmetric intervals in the red and blue wings , for a given offset velocity interval .",
    "the classical skewness and kurtosis of a statistical distribution are influenced too much by discretization effects in the line profiles we observe , while we prefer not to interpolate into the profiles to avoid adding information that would not be present before .",
    "they nevertheless inspired us to propose two empirical coefficients that we call hereafter `` asymmetry '' and `` peakedness '' to avoid confusion .",
    "they enable us to analyze the distortion of line profiles when the separation between the components is hardly noticeable , for cases where @xmath2 with a single - gaussian fit . as for a @xmath0 computation",
    ", we use the squared differences between the real data and a fitted gaussian . but contributions are positive or negative according to the sign of the difference and the data point position on predefined intervals of the line profile .",
    "each coefficient @xmath3 is defined as follows : @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the total number of points where the contribution factor @xmath6 , defined below , is non - zero .",
    "the spectrum @xmath7 at wavelength @xmath8 is discretized on spectral pixel @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the fit to @xmath7 , and @xmath11 is the error on @xmath7 . for the asymmetry ,",
    "@xmath6 is defined as follows , with @xmath12 being the center and @xmath13 being the half - width at @xmath14 of the fitted gaussian : @xmath15\\\\ 1 & \\textrm { if } \\lambda \\in { } ( \\lambda_0 + \\sigma ; \\lambda_0 + 2 \\ , \\sigma]\\\\ 0 & \\textrm { otherwise . } \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for the peakedness : @xmath16\\\\ 1 & \\textrm { if } \\lambda \\in { } ( \\lambda_0 - 0.5 \\ , \\sigma ; \\lambda_0 + 0.5 \\ , \\sigma ) \\\\",
    "-1 & \\textrm { if } \\lambda \\in [ \\lambda_0 + 0.5 \\ , \\sigma ; \\lambda_0 + 1.5 \\ , \\sigma]\\\\ 0 & \\textrm { otherwise . } \\end{array } \\right.\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    tails beyond @xmath17 and @xmath18 , respectively , are not taken into account because they are more sensitive to noise . in practice",
    ", a coefficient equal to @xmath19 means that over the main part of the profile the deviation was on average equal to one error bar , but systematically above or below the fitted gaussian according to the above defined intervals .",
    "this can then hardly be a coincidence and appears as a significant distortion .",
    "the basic idea is that any departure from a gaussian profile may be due to the presence of additional components having different centers , widths , or amplitudes at the line center . for simplicity ,",
    "we further show synthetic profiles compound of only two components and fitted them with single gaussians .",
    "but the results can be extrapolated to the addition of several components , with the limitation that any distortion can be smoothed out when their number increases . as a simple example , we simulated spectra with a dominant component having an amplitude at the line center of 100 in photon units , varying the relative amplitude of the other component .",
    "artificial error bars are used for the consistency of the definition of the coefficients , using poisson statistic ( note that the coefficients become less sensitive as the statistics decrease , because of the increased error bars ) .",
    "but for the basic behaviors analyzed here , no real noise is added : it can create an artificial distortion , or on the contrary may blur the real one , and requires statistical analysis beyond the scope of this paper .    first , we study the case of two components having identical widths @xmath13 ( taken equal to 1.4 pixel , the average one measured in our data set , see below ) , with separations of the centers varying from 0 to @xmath20 ; above @xmath20 , the double component becomes clearly visible .",
    "the coefficient of asymmetry increases ( in an absolute value ) when the separation between both lines increases , but reaches its maximum when the ratio between their amplitudes is around 50% .",
    "this is easily understandable : if it is too weak , the additional component can not significantly distort the profile , and if both amplitudes are too similar , the profile is only broadened without showing any asymmetry .    the upper panels of fig .",
    "[ fig simulated profiles ] show two examples for a second component of 50% amplitude , with a separation equal to @xmath13 in panel _ ( a ) _ and @xmath20 in panel _ ( b)_. in the case of panel _ ( a ) _ , it is impossible to say by eye that there are two components , and the coefficients of asymmetry and peakedness ( shown in the inset of each panel ) are roughly equal to 0 that is the value for a pure gaussian ( the first significant digit , not shown , is the third one after the decimal point ) .",
    "nevertheless , the width of the resulting profile is already increased by 10% as compared to that of the components . in the case of panel _",
    "( b ) _ , the asymmetry is difficult to notice without the visual comparison with the fit .",
    "these two examples show that the fit tends to balance between the major component and the small tail by shifting the center of the fitted gaussian from the major component toward the smaller one .",
    "the coefficients in eqs .",
    "( [ eq coeff ] ) to ( [ eq intervals peak ] ) were exactly designed to emphasize this behavior .",
    "note that while @xmath0 only estimates the deviation from the fitted gaussian , the coefficient of asymmetry provides more refined information on the line distortion .",
    "indeed , its sign gives the side on which the asymmetry is present : if positive , the profile has a major component on the shorter wavelengths ( hence a tail at larger wavelengths ) , and vice versa .",
    "it can also detect asymmetries for the cases of @xmath0 values that would not be regarded as abnormal , i.e. , close to 1 .",
    "the coefficient of peakedness is less useful , because it is also influenced by the asymmetry of the profile .",
    "nevertheless , it is noticeably negative ( i.e. , the profile is flatter than a gaussian ) when the components are similar in intensity and separated by more than @xmath21 ( flat - top profile , fig .",
    "[ fig simulated profiles ] _ ( c ) _ ) .",
    "therefore , it is sometimes possible to detect the presence of two ( or more ) components when the asymmetry fails to do so .",
    "the peakedness is positive ( i.e. the profile is more peaked ) when the small component is less than 40% in amplitude than the major one , still for large separations .",
    "it is also positive when both components have different widths ( fig .",
    "[ fig simulated profiles ] _ ( d ) _ ) . in this last case ,",
    "as long as the components have the same center , the asymmetry stays around 0 .",

    "for the doppler shift , absolute wavelength calibration is difficult , so like in many other studies , we take an average wavelength position along the y - direction as a reference , after correcting for the slit tilt and orbital variation ( standard procedures included in solarsoft ) . although we will show that the concept of non - thermal velocity has to be taken with care , we derive it by assuming an ion temperature equal to that of maximum line formation .",

    "the most noticeable result is that negative or positive asymmetries cluster and do not spread around randomly .",

    "there are some exceptions , like the negative areas in the core of the active region in set  1c ( fig .",
    "[ fig 13 dec main ] ) . but a closer look at the spectral profiles showed us that they correspond to large asymmetries , so that the fit is heavily shifted from an otherwise not particularly flat profile ; this weights the coefficient of peakedness and shows that this coefficient can be better defined in the future .    some examples of spectra extracted from the dimming area in data set  1c that presents large non - thermal velocity ( contoured area in fig .",

    "note that in most cases , the reduced @xmath0 is relatively small , especially when statistics are poor , even though the distortion of the line profile can be detected by the eye .",
    "our coefficients better detect the mismatch between the line profile and the fitted gaussian .",
    "following our analysis in sect .",
    "[ sec estimating line profiles ] , we interpret these asymmetries as due to the presence of a minor component in the profiles : in the blue ( red ) wing for the negative ( positive ) asymmetry . this is consistent with multiple flows merging in the same los or pixel .",
    "we checked the results produced when not using the interpolation procedure for the missing data , and the asymmetry and peakedness show the same overall behavior .",
    "therefore , the effect of the interpolation procedure for explaining the observed features can be ruled out .",
    "@xcite also found , in upflows , deviations from a single gaussian in the blue wing of the 274   and the 284   lines .",
    "note that we consider here smaller outflows and much less obvious asymmetries than those presented by @xcite , @xcite or @xcite for the same data set ( 1c ) , even if we also detect the prominent features that they found .",
    "in particular , the small black spot near @xmath27 in fig .  [ fig 13 dec main ]",
    "corresponds to the bs1 region of @xcite .",

    "set  1c , i.e. , in pixels with non - thermal velocities larger than @xmath23 ( fig .  [ fig 13 dec main ] ) , we found 21% of pixels having an absolute coefficient of asymmetry larger than 0.5 .",
    "this goes up to 28% if we count pixels with asymmetry _ or peakedness _ larger than 0.5 . in bright loops , most of the pixels present noticeable distortion of the spectral profiles .      for the multi - component analysis",

    "[ fig 13 dec main ] ) , we rejected pixels where the components are separated by more than 2 gaussian widths of the first component .",
    "this criterion is used to prevent us from considering cases where the double fit selected neighboring lines of different rest wavelengths , that appear in the 195.12   spectral window in some pixels .",
    "we also rejected pixels where the components are separated by less than @xmath28 ( nearly one third of a spectral pixel ) , or where the peak intensity of one of the components is less than 20% of the other .",
    "we applied these conservative filters to ensure that the double component that is further analyzed is significant .",
    "the white pixels in the right column of fig .",
    "[ fig doppler double ] mostly correspond to the rejected pixels .",
    "judging by the retained pixels in this figure , most of the faster components are well separated from the slower ones , with a contribution of more than 20% for the minor component , both in the dimming area and the active region core .",
    "because of the limitations of the double - gaussian fit explained in appendix  [ app testing double - gaussian fit ] , a thorough analysis of the ratios of amplitude between the components is left for future work .    the first row of fig .",
    "[ fig distrib velocities grandes ] shows the distribution of doppler velocities of both components compared to that of the single - gaussian fit , for pixels where the non - thermal velocity is larger than @xmath23 ( i.e. , the contoured areas in fig .",
    "[ fig 13 dec main ] ) .",
    "we plot the distributions separately for pixels in the dimming area and for the active region core . in the active region core , we only retained pixels where the single - gaussian fit provided a redshifted component .",
    "this prevents us from including the highly blueshifted event related to the flare that is studied by @xcite , and focuses the analysis on the cooling loops .",
    "the medians of these distributions are listed in table  [ tab medians velocity distributions ] . as the error on the velocity determination is around a few kilometers per second",
    ", we can conclude that the slower component , in the dimming area and the active region core , corresponds to emission from a roughly static plasma .",
    "for this reason , we will hereafter call this component the _ ( nearly ) static component_. the second component presents doppler velocities larger than those derived from the single - gaussian fit",
    ". we will call it the _ dynamic component_.    regarding the non - thermal velocities retrieved from the component widths in the dimming , we find distributions with medians at 70 , 42 , and @xmath29 for the single - gaussian fit , the static component , and the dynamic component , respectively .",
    "therefore , the double component analysis shows that the static component presents a non - thermal velocity more akin to what can be found in the quiet sun , even though it may consist of more components , so that the individual profiles may get even narrower .",
    "the reliability of the double - component fit was tested on synthetic line profiles ( see appendix  [ app testing double - gaussian fit ] ) .",
    "this analysis shows that : ( 1 ) the presence of two components in the data is real and is not an artifact of simply applying the double - component model on the broad profiles ; ( 2 ) the average non - zero value of the static component is an artifact of the fitting procedure and can not be considered as a definite result .",
    "overall , the analysis we made in sect .",
    "[ sec estimating line profiles ] is verified : areas with a definite positive ( negative ) asymmetry correspond to a redshifted ( blueshifted ) dynamic component in the profile .",

    "it appears that transverse velocity components of mhd waves and , in particular , alfvn waves as suggested by @xcite can not be responsible for the line broadening observed in dimmings . if this were true , the broadened profiles should be symmetric , because velocity perturbation in a wave oscillates around zero .",
    "if one assumes that the spectrometer takes a snapshot of mhd waves having periods longer than the exposure time ( 30  s per x - position ) , one should find an approximately equal number of points with negative or positive asymmetry , randomly positioned .",
    "one could also imagine that all the waves in adjacent pixels are in phase so that their velocity perturbations all have the same sign .",
    "but this would have to be the case not only in the y - direction ( simultaneous exposure ) but also in the x - direction , which implies the coincidence of the rastering speed with the wave propagation speed .",
    "this appears very unlikely , especially in so many different data sets . above all",
    ", waves can not explain the fact that the left - skewed profiles are found in dimmings and the right - skewed profiles in loops .",
    "our interpretation appears more plausible : the broadened profiles are due to the additional component that has the same velocity direction as that found with the single - gaussian fit .",
    "downflows in loops may correspond to draining of cooling material ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , while upflows correspond to material escaping the corona or refilling it after the eruption .",
    "the multi - component approach offers a new point of view on the `` coronal circulation '' concept suggested by @xcite : the dynamic component is most of the time observed together with a nearly static one in the same los .",
    "plasma velocity varying quickly on temporal scales smaller than the exposure time ( associated with jets or any other short duration events ) , may be another explanation .",
    "it is noteworthy that these interpretations are compatible with the fact that a lot of line profiles do not show any substantial distortion in the dimming areas that nevertheless present a broad profile ( e.g. , the central panel of fig .",
    "[ fig sample of spectra ] ) .",
    "indeed , for small differences in the centroid positions of the components or for small relative intensity of the additional component , the resulting profile is broadened but does not present a noticeable distortion , like in fig .",
    "[ fig simulated profiles ]  _ ( a)_. in this simple two - component case , the width of the resulting profile is increased by about @xmath30 as compared to that of the single components .",
    "this turns into an increase of 30% in non - thermal velocity in the case of an line .",
    "this value is larger than the average increase observed in the dimming area of data set  2 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig 14 15 dec ] ( see also panel ( d ) in the figure 3 of the work by * ? ? ?",
    "the lack of photon statistics in dimmings may be another reason for non - detected distortions .",
    "but the additional component is probably present in all pixels with large line profiles , and thus can explain the observed increase of the coronal line widths .",
    "we now assess the effect of line blending on the observed distortions .",
    "first of all , let us remind that to calculate the coefficients of asymmetry we select only a window around @xmath31 from the line center ( see eq .",
    "[ eq intervals asym ] ) .",
    "this means that one can consider any line lying beyond that interval as not contributing to this coefficient .",
    "the interval is even smaller for the peakedness ( see eq .",
    "[ eq intervals peak ] ) .",
    "note also that when considering the double - gaussian analysis , we discard any fits where the center of the second component is beyond @xmath31 from the main component .",
    "this filter is applied after all the iterations of the fitting procedure ( not during the iterations ) , which means that we have no selection effect .",
    "note also that a very few of such fits were discarded .",
    "they are located mainly in the active region near x=300 , y=-120 in the case of ( see fig .  [ fig doppler double ] , where they appear as the white pixels that do not correspond to the black pixels of the line - width panel in fig .  [ fig 13 dec main ] ) .",
    "a @xmath31 interval for the 195.12   line makes on average 0.06   ( or about @xmath32 ) .",
    "it can go up to 0.1   in the large widths areas ( dimming and active region core ) .",
    "@xcite report on the following neighboring lines for 195.12   .",
    "there is an 194.92   line in the red wing .",
    "this is more than @xmath33 apart ( and it is only less than 2% of the 195.12   line , according to these authors ) . on the blue wing ,",
    "the closer one is 195.25   , which is more than @xmath33 apart from the 195.12   line , or @xmath34 if we consider the large width case ( and again , it is less than 2% of the intensity of the line ) .",
    "thus , this line is not taken into account in our computations and analysis . in the chianti database @xcite",
    ", we also find a line at 195.27   which is again too far .",
    "the only critical blending issue is another line at 195.18   . for a density of @xmath35 , i.e in active regions ,",
    "it is predicted to contribute around 10% in intensity @xcite . when we simulated such kind of line profiles with the high photon statistics characteristic of active regions , we found coefficients of asymmetry larger than 1 .",
    "but the coefficients really measured in data set  1c are much larger .",
    "moreover , the distortion is hardly distinguishable by the eye in the simulated profiles , contrary to that observed in the real active region profiles .",
    "this suggests that the main contribution for the positive asymmetry of the 195.12   line profile in loop areas is not the self - blend with 195.18   .",
    "the self - blend can not account anyway for the negative asymmetry in the dimming .    according to @xcite , the",
    "202.04   line is unblended , the 274.20   line blend with a line ( in the blue wing ) can be neglected in active regions @xcite .",
    "therefore , the negative asymmetry in dimmings , free of any blending , can be ascertained from the 195.12   and 202.04   lines . the positive asymmetry in loops , at least in the active region core , can be ascertained from the 202.04   .",
    "this positive asymmetry can also be ascertained from the 274.20   line because the weak blend it is subject to is present in the blue wing , which means it should produce a negative , and not positive asymmetry .",
    "overall , similar patterns of asymmetry and/or peakedness observed in different lines ( see fig .  [",
    "fig asym peak other lines ] ) suggest that the line profile distortions are not essentially produced by blending .",
    "inhomogeneities of flow then appear as the main cause of these asymmetries , even though line blending complicates the analysis of the components .      we showed that rebinning the data does not produce additional distortion of line profiles . on the contrary",
    ", it helps to emphasize the pre - existing distortions .",
    "consequently , the inhomogeneities in velocities on scales larger than the resolution scale are not sufficient to produce the observed distortions : such inhomogeneities must be already present before the binning .",
    "they should exist on scales smaller than the initial resolution scale ( @xmath36 ) , or must be due to los or temporal integration .",
    "an interesting question is the nature of the static component , most of the time the more intense one .",
    "it could correspond to a zero sum between blue and red shifts that will symmetrically broaden the static component in excess of the thermal width ( the usual interpretation of the non - thermal velocity ) .",
    "this can be caused by waves or turbulence , for example alfvn waves .",
    "another possible interpretation is the presence of flux tubes where the plasma has no or small overall projected velocity on the los .",
    "in addition to a truly static component , this may also be the case when the los ( or pixel ) superposition of many flux tubes with different ( counter - streaming ) flow velocities is present .",
    "additionally , the cross section of some of the flux tubes may be perpendicular to the los ( e.g. , near the loop apexes ) .",
    "these interpretations can hold both for loops ( multiple parallel strands in one loop or overlying different loops ) or the dimming areas . in the latter case ,",
    "the areas of negative asymmetry seem to present a radial pattern ( especially for data sets 1b , 1c , 3a and 3b , see the black areas in the corresponding panels in fig .",
    "[ fig 13 dec ] , [ fig 13 dec main ] and [ fig 22 23 aug ] ) .",
    "it is tempting to link them to flux tubes of the fanning - out structure .",
    "the static component could then correspond , here again , to neighboring radial strands with plasma at rest or to apexes of very long loops overlying the dimming area . in three dimensions",
    ", one can imagine a mix of field lines , some of them nearly vertical and maybe open , some other ones more inclined or even horizontal , all more or less entangled , with proportions depending on the local topology of the magnetic field .",
    "note also that more components may be present in the line profiles . due to their closeness",
    ", it is very difficult to distinguish them .",
    "the profiles do not present enough `` bumps '' to unambiguously retrieve every component by a multi - component fitting procedure . with the present analysis",
    ", the only thing we can be certain of is that these profiles are not symmetric enough to be explained by a gaussian or any other symmetric distribution of velocities for the components .",
    "there are at least two components .",
    "it is tempting to relate the systematic blueshift of the nearly static component to a real flow corresponding , e.g. , to the nascent solar wind . but first , one has to remember that this doppler velocity has been derived by taking a reference wavelength computed by using the centers of the single - gaussian fits , i.e. , not taking into account the fact that some of these profiles have multiple components .",
    "second , this systematic shift may be a bias of the two - gaussian fit ( see appendix  [ app testing double - gaussian fit ] ) .",
    "third , these doppler shifts are within the error bars .",
    "this prevents us from firmly concluding on the reality of this upflow .",
    "another interesting issue is the relation between negative asymmetries and eruptions . in our data sets ,",
    "it is obvious that the negative asymmetries get larger and more extended after every eruption ( cf sect .",
    "[ sec obs and data processing ] and fig .",
    "[ fig 13 dec ] to [ fig 22 23 aug ] ) .",
    "we note that data sets 1 and 2 are taken in the same active region that underwent a significant rotation from near the disk center toward the west limb . nevertheless , the doppler shift patterns as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig 13 dec ] , [ fig 13 dec main ] and [ fig 14 15 dec ] look very similar .",
    "we could not find any marked difference between the flows due to the different positions on the disk .",
    "three effects can explain the increase of asymmetries after eruptions .",
    "first , we can suppose that the high - speed dynamic component is already present before the eruption .",
    "the disappearance of a large part of the coronal material , especially in the apexes of closed loops discussed above , may lower the intensity of the static component and thus make the dynamic one more prominent in the profile",
    ". this can be the case for data sets  1 and 2 .",
    "this interpretation is reinforced by the fact that between data sets  1c and 2a , the transient coronal hole has been refilled , while the negative asymmetries have disappeared .",
    "the case of data set  3 is more complex : the observed dimmings here are very faint and do not really correspond to the most blueshifted structure .    still with a pre - existing dynamic component ,",
    "a second explanation is that the reorganization of the magnetic topology during the eruption leads to a better alignment of the flows with the los ( e.g. , more vertical flux tubes , as expected during a dimming event ) .",
    "this increases the los component of the flow and the asymmetry of the resulting profiles .",
    "this explanation can account for the transition between data sets  3a and 3b , or maybe for the transition from data set  2a to 2b .",
    "but there is a large area of redshifts in data set  1b around @xmath37 .",
    "after the eruption , these areas show only blue shifts .",
    "this implies that the flows reverted from downward to upward .",
    "it is then difficult to envisage that all the outflows were present before .",
    "the third possibility is that the dynamic component may be a feature appearing in dimming only after eruptions .",
    "it is possible that dimmings are magnetically open structures ( see e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the plasma then can easily escape from the sun , producing the observed outflows ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . from this point of view , it is possible that apparently broader profiles ( cf sect .  [ sec double gaussian fit ] ) of the dynamic component correspond to the acceleration that produces sub - components of increasing blue shift during the exposure time .",
    "they would then be considered as a single dynamic component by the double - gaussian fit .",
    "therefore , the increase of asymmetry of the coronal line profiles may be due to an increase of the transient activity after the eruption . whatever the case may be , the outflow corresponding to the dynamic component may take part in the refilling of the corona during the dimming recovery .",
    "it is worthwhile to emphasize that most of the los velocities that we find for the dynamic component are subsonic ( the sound speed @xmath38 at @xmath39  k ; cf fig .",
    "[ fig distrib velocities grandes ] ) .",
    "we analyzed the profiles of coronal iron lines observed with _",
    "hinode_/eis by using empirical coefficients ( asymmetry and peakedness ) efficient at both detecting and discriminating different distortions of the line profiles .",
    "these coefficients are sensitive to the photon statistics in the profiles , but this is what makes them reliable .",
    "they are a good complement to multi - component analysis , particularly for a preliminary check of interesting data sets , as they are fast to compute .",
    "they are especially suitable to reveal the presence of very close components , which are difficult to resolve with a double - gaussian fit .",
    "we showed that the line broadenings correlated with large doppler shifts observed in several active regions , are associated with the presence of more than one gaussian component in the line profile .",
    "upflows are found in the coronal dimming area and downflows in the loops , confirming previous studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . however , their velocities are underestimated if a single - gaussian fit for the line profile is used . both static plasma and large flows ( several tens of kilometers per second ) are present in the same los or pixel .",
    "we do not rule out the interpretation that the inherent density decrease in coronal dimmings can broaden the line profiles due to the induced increase of the alfvn wave amplitude , as suggested by @xcite , but this can not be the sole cause .",
    "it is difficult to explain the asymmetries observed on large scales only by alfvn waves .",
    "one has to take into account the effect of inhomogeneities of velocities in the los ( overlapping strands with different inclination or intrinsic velocity ) or in the spatial resolution pixel ( flows with sub - resolution structure ) , or transient variations of the velocity on timescales smaller than the exposure time ( 30  s ) .",
    "the concept of non - thermal velocity derived from a single - gaussian fit must then be handled with care .",
    "in particular for on - disk observations , one can not directly interpret this quantity as the measure of average fluctuations of velocities in the observed pixel , especially in terms of alfvn wave amplitude .",
    "we demonstrated that this pattern is visible in three types of coronal structures which exhibit large - scale flows : cme - associated dimmings , loops , and fanning - out structures .",
    "a new field of investigation is now opened to analyze the structure of inhomogeneities in an optically thin coronal medium .",
    "finally , we note that since the submission of this paper , three more works emphasized the importance of asymmetric coronal line profiles .",
    "@xcite use a different approach based on the method described by @xcite to analyze the 202   and 274   lines .",
    "they redress the alfvn wave interpretation suggested by @xcite and independently arrive at the same conclusion as reported in our work : the analysis of line profile asymmetries shows that multiple component flows ( and not only alfvn waves ) play an important role in the plasma dynamics in coronal dimmings .",
    "@xcite finds in an active region a narrow line core and a broader minor component blueshifted by up to @xmath40 for the 284   line .",
    "@xcite showed that , in outflows observed near an active region , the and line profiles are better represented by double - gaussian fits .",
    "we find this behavior not only in upflows associated with dimmings events , but also in downflows associated with loop structures .",
    "we thank the referee , s. mcintosh , for his useful suggestions , in particular to present more data sets and wavelengths to ascertain the observed asymmetries .",

    "we used a double - gaussian fit procedure including a constant and a linear term , based on a random - restart hill - climbing method .",
    "basically , a classical gradient - expansion algorithm ( ` curvefit.pro ` in idl ) computes a non linear least - squares fit .",
    "it is restarted more than @xmath41  times , finally selecting the solution presenting the best @xmath0 .",
    "we used random starting estimates that could vary relatively widely : peak intensity between 0 and the maximum of the spectrum in the recorded window , line center within the wavelength interval of this window and line width between the instrumental width and @xmath42 of the spectral window width . to be selected ,",
    "the solution of the gradient expansion had to keep into those limits .",
    "hereafter , one has to understand the solution of a `` double - gaussian fit '' as the best solution of multiple iterations .",
    "we tested the reliability of this procedure on synthetic line profiles .",
    "first we simulated a double - gaussian profile with components similar to what we find in the contoured area of the dimming in data set  1c : a component at rest and an additional one with 40% amplitude , offset by a few tens of kilometers per second , but having the same width as the static component .",
    "we applied the double - gaussian fit thousands of times on the same synthetic profile ( i.e. , each solution of a fit being itself the results of thousands of iterations ) .",
    "we then analyzed the resulting statistics . even without added statistical noise on the synthetic profiles",
    ", the amplitude , velocity and line width of the individual components can not be retrieved with high precision . not surprisingly , the parameters of the component having the lowest amplitude present the largest dispersion .",
    "its amplitude is on average overestimated by 25% .",
    "the distribution of retrieved component centers is rather flat over an interval more than @xmath43 wide , with a median displaced by about @xmath44 as compared to the initial value .",
    "this means that the center of the small ( and dynamic , in our case ) component is on average artificially found redshifted as compared to the original component .",
    "we remind that an eis spectral pixel is equivalent to @xmath45 .",
    "likewise , the line width of the small component is on average overestimated by 15% . in compensation ,",
    "the center of the static ( and more intense ) component is artificially blueshifted by about @xmath28 , which is similar to what we find in real data .",
    "when we add statistical noise , the results are not modified very much .",
    "this analysis holds for profiles where no clear double - peak appears in the resulting profile ; it is of course easier to retrieve the correct parameters when the two components are well separated .    in a second kind of verification , we simulated a single , large gaussian and try to fit it with two gaussians .",
    "not surprisingly , when no noise is added , the fit provided two nearly identical gaussians , with an amplitude half of the original one .",
    "when we add some statistical noise , the fitting procedure starts to `` lock '' on some local bumps on the profile and finds two components that can be separated by up to several tens of kilometers per second . on average ,",
    "they nevertheless remain separated only by about @xmath46 .",
    "all these results correspond to a few particular sets of parameters and can not be compared directly to our data set that more likely corresponds to a wider range of parameters .",
    "but it gives us important information about the reliability of results of our double - gaussian fit : the presence of two components ( at least ) is real in the pixels with large non - thermal velocity .",
    "the fact that one of them is at rest and the other one is highly doppler - shifted is statistically relevant , even though it is impossible to have confidence in the fit parameters for a given pixel .",
    "our analysis also shows that one should be careful in interpreting the results of our double - gaussian fit for pixels with small non - thermal velocity .",
    "only when the coefficient of asymmetry and/or peakedness are non - negligible , one can trust the double - gaussian fit .",
    "due to the orbital variation of the line center and to the spatial inhomogeneity of the doppler shift , the rebinning ( cf sect .  [ sec different lines ] ) can be an additional source of distortion for the line profiles .",
    "we have to verify , then , that the rebinning does not contribute much to the distortion we want to emphasize . for that , we simulated a @xmath47 rebinning but with the single - gaussian fitted profiles of instead of the real data .",
    "the derived maps of asymmetry and peakedness ( not shown ) present no particular pattern , and are absolutely not comparable to what we obtained in fig .",
    "[ fig 13 dec main ] without rebinning .",
    "in fact , the coefficients are nearly equal to 0 for almost all pixels .",
    "we can then conclude that the rebinning does not have any effect on revealing the distortion of the line profiles qualitatively .",
    "this also demonstrates that the source of the distortion has nothing to do with the resolution scales : it has to be found in the los integration , in scales much smaller than the resolution scale or in temporal variation .    2008 , , 685 , 622 2008 , , 252 , 349 2008 , , 486 , l5 2008 , , 176 , 511 2010 , , 715 , 1012 2004 , , 109 , 2112 , j.  l. et al . 2007 , , 243 , 19 del zanna , g. 2008 , , 481 , l49 del zanna , g. , & mason , h. e. 2005 , , 433 , 731 , j .-",
