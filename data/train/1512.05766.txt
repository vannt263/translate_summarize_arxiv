    "interactions between electrons in solids are responsible for a large variety of symmetry broken electronic phases",
    ". unconventional superconductivity and anti - ferromagnetism are two canonical examples . from the perspective of weak coupling ,",
    "the anti - ferromagnet is an example of a density wave : a spatial modulation of electronic spin density characterized by a finite ( generally commensurate ) propagation vector , breaking translational symmetry . in general , apart from spin density , other observables involving particle - hole pairs such as charge density , orbital density , or current density , can acquire finite wave - vector modulations and break translational symmetry , giving rise to many possible unconventional and exotic density wave states .    a systematic way to study unconventional density waves",
    "is to classify them according to their symmetry properties .",
    "density wave states are condensates of particle - hole pairs and can be classified by specifying the angular momentum and spin of the particle - hole pair  @xcite , in close analogy to unconventional superconductivity  @xcite",
    ". for instance , the familiar charge and spin density waves are both @xmath1-wave condensates .",
    "distinct angular momentum channels are labeled by representations of the symmetry group of the crystal . in case of particle - hole condensates ,",
    "contrary to a superconductor , spin and angular momentum are not tied together by fermi statistics .",
    "knowledge of the symmetry of density wave states is essential for understanding the properties of materials , in particular for connecting theory to experiment .",
    "in addition , from a modern condensed matter perspective , determining the symmetry of an electronic phase is particularly relevant , as symmetries can give rise to topological electronic states  @xcite .",
    "the presence of a symmetry , such as time - reversal and/or parity symmetry , can protect or prohibit a topological phase , which may be either gapped or gapless .",
    "a number of works have specifically explored the role of lattice symmetries  @xcite . in the context of density wave states ,",
    "a number of proposals for realizing interaction - induced topological particle - hole condensates have been made in recent years  @xcite , which have set the stage for the rapidly growing and evolving field of interacting topological phases .",
    "motivated by the exciting possibility of electrons condensing into exotic collective phases , possibly characterized by large nonzero angular momentum and spontaneously generated charge- or spin - currents , in this paper we develop a symmetry analysis of density waves with finite commensurate wave - vector modulation .",
    "when particle - hole condensation occurs at finite wave vector , breaking translational symmetry , the crystal symmetry group is reduced to the group of the wave vector .",
    "the symmetry classification proposed in this paper naturally takes translational symmetry breaking into account . instead of a reduced symmetry group ,",
    "it is defined in terms of a symmetry group called the _ extended _ point group .",
    "the essential feature of the extended point group can be summarized by noting that it treats a given set of ordering wave vectors on similar footing with angular momentum channels . as a result ,",
    "extended point groups provide a means to classify translational symmetry broken density waves , in much the same way as ordinary point groups provide a means to classify different angular momentum channels  @xcite . in particular , multidimensional representations signal degeneracies in both cases .",
    "this property is particularly useful in case of inequivalent but symmetry - related ordering wave vectors .",
    "another way to think of extended point groups is to consider them as the point groups of a mathematically enlarged unit cell , i.e. , a unit cell which supports the physically enlarged unit cell associated with condensation at given wave vector ( or set of wave vectors ) .",
    "the extended point group contains translations that do not map the enlarged unit cell to itself .",
    "these are the translations broken by density wave formation .    in the next section",
    "we start by introducing the symmetry classification based on the notion of extended point groups .",
    "the classification of particle - hole condensates manifestly distinguishes two types of order : time - reversal invariant charge order and time - reversal breaking flux order .",
    "the former class consists of diagonal site order of the form @xmath2 , and off - diagonal bond order of the form @xmath3 , where @xmath4 label lattice sites .",
    "the second class , flux order , corresponds to dynamically generated orbital currents , i.e. , order of the form @xmath5 .",
    "importantly , instead of the imaginary part of bond expectation values , the symmetry classification is defined in terms of fluxes : the sum of phases around a closed lattice plaquette .",
    "this preserves gauge invariance by construction .",
    "in this work , we only consider spin - singlet or spin - rotation invariant density wave order .    as a simple first example",
    ", we revisit the density wave states of the square lattice by an application of the symmetry classification . as a second example",
    ", we apply the symmetry classification to a two - orbital square lattice model , which can be viewed as a basic description of certain iron - pnictide materials  @xcite .",
    "given these useful examples , our main goal is to apply to apply the symmetry classification to lattices with hexagonal symmetry , in particular the triangular and honeycomb lattices .",
    "hexagonal lattices have two sets of special commensurate wave vectors : the @xmath6 and @xmath0 points .",
    "the emphasis will be on the latter due their special commensurability and threefold degeneracy .",
    "degeneracies can give rise to multi - component orders .",
    "we find two sets of @xmath0-point density waves common to lattices with hexagonal symmetry : a set of conventional @xmath1 waves ( i.e. , charge density waves ) and a set of time - reversal odd @xmath7 waves ( charge - current density waves ) .",
    "the mean - field ground state of the rotationally symmetric triple-@xmath0 @xmath7-wave state is a chern insulator .    as a next step ,",
    "using extended lattice symmetries , we study the hexagonal @xmath0-point density waves focusing only on relevant low - energy electronic degrees of freedom .",
    "this will allow us to cast the results demonstrated for the triangular and honeycomb lattices in a more general form .",
    "due to the threefold degeneracy of the @xmath0-points , the low - energy electrons come in three flavors .",
    "we obtain and discuss the low - energy su(3 ) theory governing these three - flavor electrons . in particular , it is straightforward to demonstrate that @xmath1- and @xmath7-density waves correspond to nesting instabilities .",
    "we address the quasiparticle gap structures of these density waves and show that the triple-@xmath0 @xmath7-wave state is always associated with nonzero chern number .",
    "we summarize the organization of this paper as follows . in sec .",
    "[ sec : class ] , the symmetry classification is defined and applied to the square lattice ( secs .  [ ssec : sq ] and  [ ssec:2orbsq ] ) . in sec .",
    "[ sec : condens ] , the symmetry classification is applied to the hexagonal lattices , including a further characterization of selected density wave states . in sec .",
    "[ sec : lowenergy ] , the analysis is complemented by focusing on the relevant low - energy degrees of freedom . we summarize and conclude in sec .",
    "[ sec : summary ] .",
    "a number of appendixes collect details of results presented in the main text .",
    "condensation of particle - hole pairs at finite commensurate wave vector implies the breaking of translational symmetry and an enlargement of the crystal unit cell . to develop a classification that takes this feature into account in a systematic way",
    ", we describe the system in terms of a mathematically enlarged unit cell , chosen so as to support the physically enlarged unit cell of the density waves we want to study .",
    "the choice of the mathematically enlarged unit cell is determined by the ordering wave vectors relevant to the particular physical system .",
    "all possible patterns of translational symmetry breaking can then be described within the new enlarged unit cell .",
    "the symmetry group of the ( mathematically ) enlarged unit cell is the _ extended _ point group , which consists of all point group elements of the bravais lattice supplemented with the translations that do not map the enlarged unit cell onto itself , i.e. , the translations that can be broken in the density wave state . as a result , these are an extension of the ordinary point groups with additional composite elements .",
    "naturally , the extended point group depends on the set of ordering vectors .    as an example , consider ordering at wave vector @xmath8 of the square lattice .",
    "this breaks the translation @xmath9 over the unit vector @xmath10 and doubles the unit cell .",
    "clearly , the translation @xmath9 does not map the doubled unit cell onto itself , but instead connects the two sites of the enlarged cell . the translations @xmath11 and @xmath12 do map the doubled unit cell to itself and generate the group of unbroken ( or invariant ) translations .",
    "adding @xmath9 to the square point group @xmath13 gives the extended group @xmath14 , where one prime is meant to indicate that one translation has been added .",
    "the group @xmath14 is the symmetry group of the enlarged unit cell , and is treated as any other ordinary point group . in particular , its character table follows from its algebraic structure .",
    "note that in the extended group @xmath14 the translation @xmath9 is its own inverse , since @xmath15 is an invariant translation .",
    "similarly , @xmath16 is equivalent to @xmath9 as it can be written as @xmath17 . in appendix  [ app",
    ": gt ] , we collect some point group essentials , specifically in relation to extended point groups , and list character tables of symmetry groups .    in our classification",
    "we distinguish three types of orderings : site ( or charge ) order , bond order , and flux order .",
    "flux order originates from imaginary bond order amplitudes breaking time - reversal symmetry , but since we only aim to distinguish gauge inequivalent orders , we define time - reversal breaking orders by fluxes . we adopt a real - space lattice approach to classify all types of ordering according to lattice symmetry .",
    "the set of ordering vectors , specified a priori , determines the size of the ( mathematically ) enlarged unit cell . in this work",
    "we will consider cases where the unit cell is at most quadrupled .",
    "the enlarged unit cell contains @xmath18 sites @xmath19 , @xmath20 bonds @xmath21 , and @xmath22 fluxes @xmath23 .",
    "the fluxes @xmath24 are associated with each plaquette of the lattice .",
    "the extended point group operations @xmath25 permute the elements of the vectors @xmath26 , @xmath27 , and @xmath28 . writing the permutation matrix as @xmath29 , and similarly for bonds and fluxes , we have ( repeated indices are summed ) , @xmath30 it is important to bear in mind that fluxes change sign under reflections , and therefore elements of @xmath31 acquire a minus sign when @xmath25 is a reflection . in each of the three cases",
    "the set of all permutations defines a representation of the extended point group , which we call @xmath32 for site order and similarly for bond and flux order .",
    "the representations @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 are reducible and can be decomposed into a sum of irreducible representations .",
    "we take this decomposition to define the symmetry classification of all particle - hole condensates of a given type of order .",
    "specifically , the particle - hole condensates are basis functions of the irreducible representations . the transformation properties of the condensates under lattice symmetries directly follow from the symmetry of the representation . in particular , the dimensionality of the representation is equal to the number of symmetry - related partner density waves . therefore , the construction in terms of symmetry representations is useful to study degeneracies and multiple-@xmath35 ordering scenarios .    even though the classification itself is defined in terms of a real - space construction , ultimately we are interested in explicit momentum - space expressions of particle - hole condensates , in order to , for instance , study mean - field hamiltonians .",
    "the symmetry classification serves this purpose by providing an exhaustive list of all condensates supported by the ordering vectors , which are obtained using a simple and straightforward construction .",
    "the symmetry properties of the condensates , automatically delivered by the classification , can be used to derive the condensate functions systematically , even though in simple cases they follow directly .",
    "in addition , the distinction between time - reversal even and gauge invariant time - reversal odd orderings is naturally formulated in the real space construction .",
    "a further benefit of the present classification is that the symmetry of density waves , labeled by representations of the symmetry group , can be directly used to derive phenomenological landau theories .",
    "phenomenological models can be derived and analyzed simply based on the symmetry of the order parameter , and do not require knowledge of condensate functions . in particular , multi - component landau theories typically give rise to distinct composite or subsidiary orders , which can be directly obtained using the symmetry classification .",
    "this will be demonstrated below in the context of a simple example ( sec .",
    "[ ssec:2orbsq ] ) .",
    "the extended point group structure is hierarchical in the sense that the bare point group ( without translations ) is a proper subgroup .",
    "therefore , all representations of the extended point group can be decomposed into representations of the bare point group .",
    "this decomposition contains information regarding the spectral effects of the density waves , as we will see in the following .",
    "furthermore , this decomposition can be used to define and study multiple-@xmath35 ordering in case the extended point group representation describes inequivalent wave vector components .",
    "the starting point is fixing the ordering vectors .",
    "we consider the set of ordering vectors given by the three momenta @xmath36 which are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : bz_square ] .",
    "each of these ordering vectors is half of a reciprocal lattice vector , e.g. @xmath37 , which is an expression of their commensurability .",
    "the unit cell is quadrupled and as a consequence the three translations @xmath9 , @xmath16 and @xmath38 become members of the extended square symmetry group @xmath39 . the character table of @xmath39",
    "is reproduced in appendix  [ app : gt ]  @xcite .",

    "the momenta @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are marked by bold red dots .",
    "( right ) red rotated square inscribed in the square lattice bz marks the nested fermi surface at half - filling .",
    "inner black square represents the reduced brillouin zone for multiple-@xmath35 ordering and @xmath43 denotes the location of the degeneracy point of the @xmath44 density - wave state . ]",
    "the enlarged unit cell of the square lattice has @xmath45 and @xmath46 . using the recipe of the symmetry classification",
    ", we construct the permutation representations @xmath32 , @xmath33 , and @xmath34 and decompose into irreducible representations . for site order",
    "we find the following decomposition @xmath47 the first term is the trivial representation .",
    "the second and third term are representations specific to @xmath39 and correspond to translational symmetry breaking . from the symmetry of the @xmath48 state",
    "we see that it describes site order at wave vector @xmath49 , i.e. , a staggered charge density wave .",
    "the representation @xmath50 is two - dimensional and describes a doublet of striped charge orderings with wave vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 .    in case of bond order",
    ", we find that @xmath33 is decomposed as @xmath53 the square lattice unit cell ( as opposed to the enlarged one ) contains two bonds and the first to terms @xmath54 describe the translationally invariant bond modulations .",
    "the remaining representations correspond to translational symmetry breaking and are all two - dimensional .",
    "the @xmath55 doublet is a set of staggered @xmath56-waves with ordering vector @xmath49 .",
    "the @xmath50 doublet is symmetry equivalent to the site ordered doublet of stripes with ordering vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "for the flux order representation @xmath34 we find the decomposition @xmath57 the fluxes necessarily break time - reversal and reflection symmetries , which explains the absence of a fully invariant term @xmath58 .",
    "the representation @xmath59 corresponds to a state of staggered fluxes with ordering vector @xmath49 and @xmath7-wave ( @xmath44 ) structure .",
    "this staggered flux or @xmath7-density wave has a long history in the context of spin liquid  @xcite and cuprate pseudogap physics  @xcite .",
    "the doublet @xmath60 corresponds to staggered flux stripes with wave vectors @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "the bond ordered states of eq .",
    "derive from bonds connecting nearest neighbor sites .",
    "we can apply the same method to the diagonal bonds , connecting next - nearest neighbors . including the diagonal bonds in the bond vector @xmath27 yields the decomposition @xmath61 the state with @xmath62 symmetry has @xmath7-wave ( @xmath63 ) structure and ordering vector @xmath49 .",
    "it is the time - reversal even @xmath7-wave partner of the flux ordered state with @xmath59 symmetry .",
    "the notable density wave states of this example are summarized in table  [ tab : square ] . to conclude this example of square lattice density waves ,",
    "we demonstrate how symmetry can be used to identify topologically nontrivial states . in two dimensions and",
    "disregarding spin the most common nontrivial state is the chern insulating state .",
    "time - reversal symmetry and reflection symmetry each force the chern number to be zero  @xcite and we are therefore limited to flux ordered states .",
    "the @xmath59 state is odd under all reflections ( see appendix  [ app : gt ] for @xmath39 character table ) but it is even under reflections combined with a translation @xmath9 , which is sufficient to enforce zero chern number .",
    "equivalently , time - reversal symmetry is preserved up to a translation .",
    "similarly , one can not form a flux ordered state out of the two @xmath60 partners which manifestly breaks all reflections . as a result , a chern insulating state can not be formed within a single density wave channel .",
    "we can alternatively consider mixed representation states .",
    "inspection of the characters of the representations @xmath62 ( @xmath63 ) and @xmath59 ( @xmath44 ) leads to the conclusion that a combination of these breaks time - reversal symmetry and all reflections .",
    "hence , a @xmath64 state can have nonzero chern number .",
    "both @xmath7-waves have semi - metallic gapless spectra , a combination of the two of the form @xmath64 has a gapped mean - field spectrum .",
    "one can start from the ( imaginary ) @xmath44 state and show that admixture of the ( real ) @xmath63 state gaps out the nodal degeneracies , or vice versa .",
    "indeed the resulting insulating state has nonzero chern number and is associated with a spontaneous quantum hall ( qh ) effect  @xcite .",
