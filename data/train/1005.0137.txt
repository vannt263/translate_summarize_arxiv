    "the ability to design and fabricate controllable many - body systems has been realized to be a precious tool to explore the world of strongly correlated systems . in several different physical phenomena , ranging from high temperature superconductivity to heavy fermions or the fractional quantum hall effect",
    ", strong local electronic correlations play a crucial role .",
    "the seemingly simplified models to describe these correlations , the hubbard model of high temperature superconductivity for example , are extremely difficult to solve and over the years a number of judicious analytical and numerical methods have been developed . together with these more `` traditional '' methods ,",
    "in recent years it was proposed that strongly correlated systems could be studied by means of quantum simulators  @xcite , _",
    "i.e. _  fabricated systems that can experimentally simulate the model hamiltonian underlying the non - trivial properties of the physical systems under consideration .",
    "the advantages of this approach are twofold .",
    "first of all it is possible to explore the properties of strongly correlated model hamiltonians also in those regions of the phase diagram which are elusive to numerical and analytical investigations . secondly it allows to test to which extent the model hamiltonians under consideration are appropriate to treat the physical systems that they are supposed to describe or whether additional ingredients are necessary .",
    "quantum simulators have a long and successful story .",
    "probably the first fabricated system to have these characteristics were josephson junction arrays  @xcite .",
    "the field boosted with the appearance of cold atoms in optical lattices  @xcite which proved to be excellent simulators of a large variety of strongly interacting fermi and bose systems .",
    "topic of the present paper is to review the latest developments of a newly born direction in the field of quantum simulators based on arrays of qed - cavities  @xcite .",
    "there is already a comprehensive review on the subject  @xcite , in this paper we will focus on some of the recent developments .",
    "cavity - qed arrays offer the possibility to realize strongly correlated states of light .",
    "they can operate at high temperatures ( as compared to josephson arrays and optical lattices ) and allow for single - site addressing thus opening a way to access experimentally correlation functions .",
    "furthermore they might allow to explore a number of new equilibrium and non - equilibrium quantum phase transitions .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in the next section",
    "we will introduce cavity arrays .",
    "we define the model hamiltonians that govern their dynamics and the most relevant sources of dissipation . in sec .",
    "[ sec : phasediagram ] we discuss the most important characteristics of the equilibrium phase diagram and the nature of the low - lying excitations .",
    "section  [ sec : simulators ] describes how cavity arrays can operate as quantum simulators .",
    "section  [ sec : nonequilibrium ] reviews some properties of these systems out of equilibrium .",
    "we complete the presentation with the conclusions where we will briefly discuss possible experimental realizations and some perspectives in the field .",
    "a sketch of a cavity array is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : array ] .",
    "it consists of a regular arrangement of qed - cavities which are coupled by the hopping of photons .",
    "light resonates in each cavity and interacts with matter contained therein .",
    "experimental realization of cavity arrays can be imagined in different ways .",
    "we will briefly discuss this point at the end of the paper .",
    "[ fig : array ] illustrates the case in which the array is realized using photonic crystals .",
    "the salient ingredient at the base of the rich physics of cavity arrays is the interplay of two competing effects .",
    "matter interaction inside the cavity leads to a ( possibly strong ) nonlinearity between photons .",
    "on the other hand , photon hopping between neighboring cavities favors delocalization thus competing with photon blockade .",
    "a model that describes a cavity array must then take into consideration the interaction of the light and the matter within each cavity , the coherent coupling between the cavities induced by the propagation of the light , the leakage of photons out of the cavities , and the dissipation and decoherence of the matter .",
    "it is also necessary to include an external pump to populate the cavities and devise a method to perform the measurement of the state of each cavity .",
    "we first describe the terms that lead to the unitary evolution of the array and afterwards the main sources of dissipation .",
    "a single cavity confines several modes of the electromagnetic field and each mode is quantized as an harmonic oscillator . in the case that a single mode with frequency @xmath0 is considered , the corresponding hamiltonian is given by @xmath1 where the operator @xmath2 ( @xmath3 ) annihilates ( creates ) a quantum of light in the mode of the @xmath4-th cavity .",
    "if the cavities are sufficiently close to allow for photon hopping , an additional kinetic term @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is associated to the tunneling rate ) should be added to the hamiltonian .",
    "these two terms constitute the model for a cavity array in the absence of any interaction with the matter field . in the presence of hopping the hamiltonian of the photons",
    "is still harmonic and can be diagonalized by fourier transform leading to the dispersion law of the photons in the lattice .     a sketch of a qed - cavity array .",
    "it consists of a regular arrangement of qed cavities .",
    "neighboring cavities are coupled by photon hopping .",
    "nonlinearities in the cavities may produce an effective repulsion between the photons leading to an anharmonic spectrum .",
    "the nonlinearity may be produced , _ e.g. _  by a two - level system ( depicted in the inset ) coupled to the light resonating in the cavity and subjected to decay .",
    "photons in the cavities have a finite lifetime therefore the cavities are pumped with an external coherent drive .",
    "]    the presence of atoms ( quantum dots or cooper pair boxes depending on the implementation ) inside each cavity leads to a strong effective nonlinearity between photons .",
    "it is enough to think to the matter field as a few - level system coupled to cavity mode and possibly to some external source .",
    "the hamiltonian for an array of cavities can be written as on each cavity and the photon hopping term between different cavities @xmath7 the local contribution @xmath8 describes the light ",
    "matter interaction . in the limit in which leakage of photons is ignored ,",
    "the hamiltonian in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fullham ] ) has been treated in the grand - canonical ensemble . in this case",
    "one should add a term containing the chemical potential . in the next section",
    "the phase diagram will be presented in the grand - canonical ensemble .",
    "probably the simplest model to describe the interaction between light and matter is the jaynes - cummings model in which one mode of the cavity interacts with a two - level system  @xcite .",
    "one photon can be absorbed by the two - level system , that goes into the excited state , and conversely a photon can be emitted if the two - level system flips from the excited @xmath9 to the ground state @xmath10 .",
    "the jaynes - cummings model reads @xmath11 @xmath12 are the raising / lowering operators for the two - level system and @xmath13 denotes the transition energy between the two levels . in the rotating frame with respect to the uncoupled hamiltonian",
    "the relevant quantity is the detuning @xmath14 .",
    "the spectrum of eq .",
    "( [ eq : jaynescummings ] ) is anharmonic so that , effectively , the two - level system induces a repulsion between the photons in the cavity .",
    "the strong effective nonlinearity between the photons turns the cavity into a turnstile device , where only a photon can be present at the same time .",
    "intuitively , this can be understood as the fact that one photon in the cavity strongly modifies the effective resonance frequency , inhibiting the injection of a second photon .",
    "this phenomenon has been termed `` photon blockade ''  @xcite , after the coulomb blockade effect of electrons in mesoscopic structures .",
    "the entire cavity thus behaves as an effective spin system , that emits strongly anti - bunched light .",
    "the cavity array hamiltonian with the jaynes - cummings term was first used by greentree _",
    "et al . _  in ref .",
    "@xcite and by angelakis _",
    "et al . _  in ref .",
    "a similar model with many two - level systems in each cavity has also been used @xcite , where each two - level system interacts with the mode of the cavity in a sort of dicke - bose - hubbard model .",
    "_  in ref .",
    "@xcite allowed for the number of systems to fluctuate among the cavities and showed that if the cavity is strongly red - detuned with respect to the transition in the two - level systems , the photons experience an effective kerr nonlinearity . koch and le hur  @xcite , though , pointed out that the substitution of the jaynes - cummings coupling with an effective kerr nonlinearity is not appropriate in general .",
    "since the quantum effects in the cavity may be visible if the coupling exceeds the decay amplitude of the matter and of the light , there has been a lot of effort in increasing the effective cavity nonlinearity .",
    "strong interaction of light is in general limited by the absorption of the medium , because the optical nonlinearities are weak in non - resonant processes , while the absorption plays a dominant role in the resonant processes .",
    "one route to access the strong - coupling regime involves the usage of external classical sources that prepare coherently the matter in a state with reduced absorption .",
    "electromagnetically induced transparency ( eit ) can be used to achieve interaction strengths that are one order of magnitude larger than what is possible with an ensemble of two - level systems  @xcite .",
    "various schemes to obtain strong nonlinearities have been discussed  @xcite . in this spirit",
    "et al . _  in ref .",
    "@xcite considered an ensemble of four - level atoms in a cavity array defined , in the rotating frame , by a local interaction of the form @xmath15 having defined the global atomic raising and lowering operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 ) , or energy level populations ( @xmath18 ) for the @xmath19th atom . the transition @xmath20 is driven by a classical coupling field with rabi frequency @xmath21 ; the cavity mode couples the @xmath22 and @xmath23 ; the parameters @xmath24 and @xmath25 account for the detunings of levels @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "they considered a setup similar to ref .",
    "@xcite and introduced three families of polaritons , delocalized over the whole atomic ensemble , that diagonalize the hamiltonian ( if the state @xmath28 decouples from the dynamics and the number @xmath29 of atoms is very large ) .",
    "one of the polaritons projects only on the lowest - lying metastable states @xmath10 and @xmath9 and is thus the longest - lived .",
    "the polaritons can be considered independent bosonic particles if their number is much smaller than the number of atoms inside each cavity  @xcite .",
    "the longest - lived polariton decouples from the others and experiences an energy shift due to the perturbative coupling to the level @xmath28 , that induces an interaction of the kerr form . in this way , in the large @xmath29 limit",
    ", they were able to show that the cavity model maps onto an effective bose - hubbard model  @xcite for polaritons @xmath30 up to now we did not take into account the leakage of photons out of the cavities and the decoherence and dissipation of the few - level systems .",
    "one possibility , in the case of slow decay , is to complement the hamiltonian with imaginary frequencies multiplied by the projectors of the decaying states , that render the dynamics non - hermitian ( see some application of this method in ref .",
    "alternatively the decay can be given in terms of the density matrix @xmath31 of the cavity array , using the master equation @xmath32 + { \\cal l}[\\rho(t)]~,\\ ] ] where the liouvillian @xmath33 in the lindblad form reads _",
    "@xmath34 = \\frac{\\kappa}{2 } \\sum_{\\ell } \\left ( a_{\\ell } \\rho(t ) a_{\\ell}^{\\dag } - a_{\\ell}^{\\dag } a_{\\ell }       \\rho(t ) - \\rho(t ) a_{\\ell}^{\\dag } a_{\\ell } \\right ) ~.\\ ] ] this term describes leakage of photons from all the cavities of the array , with an equal rate @xmath35 .",
    "a similar term can be used to describe decoherence and dissipation of the matter , although these processes can usually be neglected in the timescale of the photonic decay @xcite .    in order to have a measurable signal out of the cavity array",
    "it is necessary to refill with photons the modes of the cavities , to contrast the leakage .",
    "if a coherent laser beam of frequency @xmath36 is coupled to the cavity , the hamiltonian acquires a term @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is proportional to the electric field of the beam . to eliminate the explicit time - dependence @xmath39 from @xmath38",
    "it is convenient to use a rotating frame in which the strength of the pumping is constant and the frequency @xmath36 is subtracted from the energy of the photons in the cavity mode .",
    "the contribution of the drive to the hamiltonian reads @xmath40 in the next section we will discuss the main features of the phase diagram deriving from the hamiltonian  ( [ eq : fullham ] ) .",
    "the phase diagram of the bose - hubbard model defined in eq .",
    "( [ eq : bhmodel ] ) has been studied for more than two decades ( see for example references in  @xcite ) .",
    "a qualitative understanding of the zero - temperature phase diagram can be obtained by considering the two limiting cases in which one of the two coupling energies ( @xmath6 or @xmath41 ) dominates .",
    "if the hopping dominates , the bosons delocalize throughout the whole lattice . in the limit of vanishing interactions , the many - body ground state becomes simply an ideal bose - einstein condensate where all the bosonic particles are in the bloch state of the lattice with vanishing quasimomentum , so that the many - body wavefunction is written as @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the total number of cavities , @xmath29 is the total number of bosons and @xmath44 is the vacuum state of the many - body fock basis .",
    "in contrast , if the interaction dominates , each site has a well defined number of bosons in the ground state . in order to put an extra boson on a given site ,",
    "one has to overcome an energy gap of the order of @xmath41 . in the mott",
    "lobes each cavity contains a definite number of bosons , the fluctuations of the number operator vanish , and each particle is localized in a given cavity .",
    "each mott lobe exists up to a maximum hopping @xmath45 at which it is energetically convenient for the particles to delocalize over the whole lattice ( decreasing their kinetic energy ) rather than localize in a given site ( decreasing their mutual interaction ) . in the case of vanishing hopping ,",
    "the hamiltonian is the sum of commuting local hamiltonians and the ground state can be written in the product form @xmath46 . when the hopping is comparable with the onsite repulsion a quantum phase transition takes place , separating a superfluid from a mott insulator .",
    "although there are large quantitative differences between the case of one- , two- , or three - dimensional lattices , the equilibrium phase diagram of the model ( at zero temperature , in the plane of the hopping and the chemical potential ) is similar in all cases and consists of a superfluid phase surrounding a sequence of mott - insulator lobes [ see fig .

    "quantitative differences arise depending on the model of the cavity . for the sake of clarity",
    "we will ignore these differences and try to highlight only those characteristics which are common to cavity arrays .",
    "the phase transition between the mott - insulator and the superfluid is a symmetry breaking phenomenon that involves the conservation of the number of bosons @xmath48 .",
    "the conserved quantity in the cavity model , take for example the jaynes - cummings interaction , instead is the number of polaritons , that do not have a definite quantum statistics . in cavity arrays",
    "the detuning @xmath25 can also be varied so that the phase diagram becomes effectively three - dimensional @xcite .",
    "it turns out that the detuning is a convenient experimental knob to tune the system across the phase transition .",

    "the method relies on the dynamical instability of the bh that follows a quantum quench from the mott to the superfluid phase .",
    "the realization of the quantum quench in the dissipative environment is realized with a careful design of the initial pulse , that is substantially different from a @xmath69-pulse , and it is shown that the detection of the phase border is very robust to imperfections in the pumping .",
    "the time - evolution of the system produces antibunched light if the ratio @xmath70 is smaller than the critical value @xmath45 at the tip of the mott lobe , and the crossover from antibunched to bunched light clearly marks the phase boundary .",
    "as candidates for simulating strongly interacting models , coupled cavities present new characteristics as compared to other successful examples , like optical lattices or josephson junction arrays : most notably it is possible to access their local properties . in this paper we briefly review their basic properties and some of the latest developments in the field .",
    "qed - cavities can be realized in a number of different ways  @xcite .",
    "this flexibility in the design is a potential advantage to realize different local nonlinearities .",
    "moreover different systems may allow for different measurement schemes as well .",
    "as already mentioned , at present there are no experimental realizations of cavity arrays although it seems that technological requirements are already at hand to fabricate a small number of coupled cavities . in this respect",
    "it may be interesting to explore properties of small clusters .    in this review we confined the discussion to coupled cavities .",
    "there are other systems in which many - body physics with light can be realized ( see for example  @xcite ) . due to space limitations",
    "we did not touch these very interesting directions of research .",
    "we acknowledge a very fruitful collaboration with iacopo carusotto , dario gerace , vittorio giovannetti , atac imamoglu , davide rossini , giuseppe santoro , and hakan tureci .",
