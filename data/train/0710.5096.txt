    "in recent years , the halo occupation distribution and conditional luminosity function have become powerful statistical measures to probe the link between galaxies and their hosting dark matter halos .",
    "although these statistical measures themselves do not give physical explanations of how galaxies form and evolve , they provide important constraints on various physical processes that govern the formation and evolution of galaxies , such as gravitational instability , gas cooling , star formation , merging , tidal stripping and heating , and a variety of feedback processes .",
    "in particular , they constrain how their efficiencies scale with halo mass .",
    "the halo occupation distribution ( hereafter hod ) , @xmath18 , which gives the probability of finding @xmath19 galaxies ( with some specified properties ) in a halo of mass @xmath20 , has been extensively used to study the galaxy distribution in dark matter halos and galaxy clustering on large scales ( e.g. jing , mo & brner 1998 ; peacock & smith 2000 ; seljak 2000 ; scoccimarro et al .  2001 ;",

    "the conditional luminosity function ( clf ) , @xmath21 , which refines the hod statistic by considering the average number of galaxies with luminosity @xmath22 that reside in a halo of mass @xmath20 , has also been extensively investigated ( yang , mo & van den bosch 2003 ; van den bosch , yang & mo 2003 ; vale & ostriker 2004 , 2006 ; cooray 2006 ; van den bosch et al .",

    "mo et al . 2004 ; wang et al .  2004 ; zehavi et al .",

    "these investigations demonstrate that the halo occupation statistics are very useful in establishing and describing the connection between galaxies and dark matter halos .",
    "furthermore , they also indicate that the galaxy / dark halo connection can provide important constraints on cosmology ( e.g.,van den bosch , mo & yang 2003 ; zheng & weinberg 2007 ) .",
    "finally , the hod / clf framework also allows one to split the galaxy population in centrals and satellites , and to describe their properties separately ( e.g. cooray 2005 ; white et al .  2007 ;",
    "zheng et al .  2007 ) .",
    "as has been pointed out in yang et al .",
    "( 2005c ; hereafter y05c ) , a shortcoming of the hod / clf models is that the results are not completely model independent .",
    "typically , assumptions have to be made regarding the functional form of either @xmath18 or @xmath23 .",
    "moreover , in all hod / clf studies to date , the occupation distributions have been determined in an indirect way : the free parameters of the assumed functional form are constrained using _ statistical _ data on the abundance and clustering properties of the galaxy population .",
    "one may hope to circumvent this shortcoming by directly measure the dark matter distribution around galaxies .",
    "such measurements can in principle be obtained through gravitational lensing and x - ray observations . however",
    ", both methods are hampered by requirements on the data quality and uncertainties related to the interpretation of the data .",
    "for instance , weak lensing measurements , which requires high - quality imaging , typically needs to resort to the stacking of many lens galaxies in order to get a detectable signal , but this stacking severely complicates the interpretation in terms of the halo masses of the lens galaxies . in the case of x - ray observations , robust constraints can only be obtained for massive clusters , but even here the interpretation of the data can be complicated due to the presence of substructure and deviations from hydrostatic equilibrium . an alternative method to directly probe",
    "the galaxy - dark halo connection is to use galaxy groups as a representation of dark matter halos and to study how the galaxy population changes with the properties of the groups ( e.g. , y05c ; zandivarez et al .",
    "2006 ; robotham et al .",
    "2006 ; hansen et al .",

    "recently , we have constructed a large galaxy group catalogue based on the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 ( sdss dr4 ) , using an adaptive halo - based group finder ( yang et al .",
    "2007 ; paper i ; y07 hereafter ) . detailed tests with mock galaxy catalogues have shown that this group finder is very successful in associating galaxies according to their common dark matter halos .",
    "in particular , the group finder performs reliably not only for rich systems , but also for poor systems , including isolated central galaxies in low mass halos .",
    "this makes it possible to study the galaxy - halo connection for systems covering a large dynamic range in masses .",
    "various observational selection effects have been taken into account , especially the survey edge effects and fiber collisions .",
    "the halo masses for the groups are estimated according to the abundance match , using the characteristic group luminosity and stellar masses ( see  [ sec_data ] below ) . according to tests with mock galaxy catalogues ,",
    "the halo masses are estimated with a standard deviation of about 0.3 dex . with these well - defined galaxy group catalogues",

    "detailed tests using mock galaxy redshift surveys have demonstrated that the group masses thus estimated can recover the true halo masses with a 1-@xmath50 deviation of @xmath51 dex , and are more reliable than those based on the velocity dispersion of group members ( y05c ; weinmann et al .",
    "2006 ; berlind et al .",
    "2006 ; y07 ) .",
    "note also that survey edge effects have been taken into account in our group catalogue : groups that suffer severely from edge effects ( about 1.6% of the total ) have been removed from the catalogue . in most cases , we take the brightest galaxy in the group as the central galaxy ( bcg ) and all others as satellite galaxies . in addition , we also considered a case in which the most massive galaxy ( in terms of stellar mass ) in a group is considered as the central galaxy ( mcg ) .",
    "tests have shown that for most of what follows , these two definitions yield indistinguishable results . whenever the two definitions lead to significant differences , we present results for both .",
    "the conditional luminosity function ( clf ) of galaxies in dark halos , @xmath52 , which describes the average number of galaxies as a function of galaxy luminosity in a dark matter halo of a given mass , plays an important role in our understanding of how galaxies form in dark matter halos ( yang , mo & van den bosch 2003 ; van den bosch , yang & mo ; 2003 ; cooray 2006 ; vale & ostriker 2006 ; van den bosch et al .",

    "overall , these two halo masses give consistent results , except that the @xmath42-based clf of the central galaxies in low mass halos is more peaked than the @xmath44-based clf ( see the lower right - hand panel ) .",
    "the errorbars shown in each panel correspond to 1-@xmath50 scatter obtained from 200 bootstrap samples of our group catalogue .",
    "the clf for the total population ( centrals plus satellites ) matches reasonably well the schechter form down to halo masses of @xmath56 . for less massive halos , however , there is a prominent peak in the clf at the bright end due to the contribution of central galaxies , which makes the total clf deviate significantly from the schechter form .",
    "as discussed in y05c , in low - mass halos where the group characteristic luminosity ( @xmath43 ) is dominated by the central galaxy , the @xmath43-@xmath42 conversion can produce an artificial peak in the clf at the bright end .",
    "however , comparing the results obtained here with the test results shown in fig .",
    "9 of y05c indicates that the strong peak in the lower right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : clf ] can not be entirely due to the @xmath43-@xmath42 conversion .",
    "therefore , in what follows , we will model the clf for central and satellite galaxies separately .    fig .  [",
    "fig : clf_color ] shows the clfs separately for red ( dashed lines ) and blue ( dotted lines ) galaxies .",
    "note that massive halos clearly contain more red galaxies than blue galaxies ( both centrals and satellites ) , while the opposite applies to low mass halos .",
    "the overall clf shapes for red and blue galaxies , however , are remarkably similar .",
    "to quantify the clfs , we fit each of them with the following model .",
    "we write the total clf as the sum of the clfs of central and satellite galaxies : @xmath57 we assume the contribution from the central galaxies to be a lognormal : @xmath58\\,,\\ ] ] where @xmath59 is the number of central galaxies per halo .",

    "note that @xmath64 is , by definition , the expectation value for the ( 10-based ) logarithm of the luminosity of the central galaxy ; @xmath65 and that @xmath66 .",
    "for the contribution from the satellite galaxies we adopt a modified schechter function : @xmath67.\\ ] ] note that this function decreases faster at the bright end than a schechter function .",

    "we therefore adopt @xmath73 , throughout , which reduces the number of free parameters to four .",
    "for all the clfs measured above , the best fit parameters , using the model described by equation  [ eq : clf_fit ] , are shown in fig  [ fig : fit_clf ] .",
    "results are shown separately for all ( left column panels ) , red ( middle column panels ) and blue ( right column panels ) galaxies .",
    "the error - bars in the upper two rows reflect the 1-@xmath50 scatter obtained from our 200 bootstrap samples . here",
    "we also compare results obtained using samples ii and iii .",
    "note that sample ii does not include any galaxies missed due to fiber collisions , while sample iii includes all such galaxies by assigning each of them the redshift of its nearest neighbor .",
    "although this fiber collision correction works well in roughly 60 percent of all cases , the remaining 40 percent are assigned redshifts that can be very different from their true values ( zehavi et al .",

    "( 2003 ) and cooray ( 2006 ) from clustering and abundances of galaxies in the 2dfgrs and sdss , respectively .",
    "however , zheng et al . ( 2007 ) found , based on hods models for the sdss and deep2 , that the log - normal width increases from @xmath81 for massive halos with @xmath82 to @xmath51 for low mass halos with @xmath83 .",
    "this is quite different from our results , which suggest that @xmath84 _ decreases _ with decreasing halo mass . however , this is most likely an artefact of the method that we used to assign halo masses to our groups . as mentioned above , our halo masses are based on the ranking of either @xmath43 or @xmath85 , which implies that we have assumed a one - to - one relation between halo mass and these two indicators . at the low mass end , both @xmath43 and @xmath46",
    "are expected to be strongly correlated with the luminosity of corresponding central galaxies .",

    "an useful quantity to describe the difference between the central and satellite galaxies is the so - called ` luminosity - gap ' between the bcg and the brightest satellite galaxy in a given halo .",
    "this ` luminosity - gap ' holds important information regarding the formation and evolution of galaxies . for example , as discussed in donghia et al .",
    "( 2005 ) and milosavljevi et al .",
    "( 2006 ) , the luminosity - gap may be used to quantify the dynamical age of a system of galaxies : halos with @xmath235 close to unity must be relatively young , as dynamical friction causes multiple luminous galaxies in the same halo to merge on a relatively short time scale .",
    "put differently , the distribution of @xmath235 holds important information regarding the importance of galactic cannibalism for bcgs ( e.g. , tremaine & richstone 1977 ; vale & ostriker 2007 )    using our group catalogue , it is straightforward to measure @xmath235 , as well as the stellar mass equivalent , @xmath236 , as function of group mass , as long as the group has at least two members . in the case of ` isolated galaxies ' , i.e. , groups with only one member ( the central ) , however , there are two possibilities : either the galaxy is truly isolated , in that its halo contains no satellite galaxies , or the halo contains one or more satellite galaxies that are fainter than the flux limit of the survey . to bracket the extremes we proceed as follows . for isolated galaxies we either assume that the brightest satellite has zero luminosity ( case 1 ) or that its luminosity is such that its apparent magnitude limit is equal to the magnitude limit of our sample ( case 2 ) .",
    "[ fig : l1l2 ] shows the results thus obtained for both the luminosity gap ( left - hand panel ) and the stellar mass gap ( right - hand panel ) .",

    ", however , cases 1 and 2 yield very different results , indicating that the flux limit of the survey severely impedes our ability to accurately measure the gap statistics . finally we emphasize that the luminosity - gap statistics obtained from samples ii and iii separately are very similar , indicating that fiber collisions do not have a strong impact on the results presented here .    as pointed out by tremaine & richstone ( 1977 ; and references therein ) , the ` luminosity - gap ' can be used to determine whether the bcgs in galaxy groups are statistically drawn from the same distribution as the satellite galaxies or whether they are ` special ' .",
    "if the average magnitude difference between the bcgs and the brightest satellite galaxies is smaller than the standard deviation in the magnitudes of the bcgs , then they are consistent with being draw from the same distribution . to test this , the solid curve in the left - hand panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : l1l2 ] indicates the best - fit values of @xmath244 obtained from the clfs .",
    "a comparison with the median luminosity gaps suggests that the bcgs in groups , especially with @xmath245 , form a ` special ' subclass , in that their luminosities can not be considered the extreme values of the distribution of satellite luminosities . as a cautionary remark",
    ", we emphasize that because of the method used to assign halo masses to the groups , the value of @xmath68 may be underestimated , especially for low mass groups ( see discussion in section  [ sec_clfs ] ) .",
    "however , even if @xmath68 were underestimated by a factor two at the low mass end , this would not change our conclusion that bcgs are special in low mass halos .",
    "the ` luminosity - gap ' can also be described using its distribution for groups of a given mass . in the upper panels of fig .",

    "<S> we investigate various galaxy occupation statistics of dark matter halos using a large galaxy group catalogue constructed from the sloan digital sky survey data release 4 ( sdss dr4 ) with an adaptive halo - based group finder . </S>",
    "<S> the conditional luminosity function ( clf ) , which describes the luminosity distribution of galaxies in halos of a given mass , is measured separately for all , red and blue galaxies , as well as in terms of central and satellite galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> the clfs for central and satellite galaxies can be well modelled with a log - normal distribution and a modified schechter form , respectively . about 85% of the central galaxies and about 80% of the satellite galaxies in halos with masses @xmath0 are red galaxies . </S>",
    "<S> these numbers decrease to 50% and 40% , respectively , in halos with @xmath1 . for halos of a given mass </S>",
    "<S> , the distribution of the luminosities of central galaxies , @xmath2 , has a dispersion of about @xmath3 dex . </S>",
    "<S> the mean luminosity ( stellar mass ) of the central galaxies scales with halo mass as @xmath4 ( @xmath5 ) for halos with masses @xmath6 , and both relations are significantly steeper for less massive halos . </S>",
    "<S> we also measure the luminosity ( stellar mass ) gap between the first and second brightest ( most massive ) member galaxies , @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) . </S>",
    "<S> these gap statistics , especially in halos with @xmath9 , indicate that the luminosities of central galaxies are clearly distinct from those of their satellites . </S>",
    "<S> the fraction of fossil groups , defined as those groups with @xmath10 , ranges from @xmath11 for groups with @xmath12 to 18 - 60% for groups with @xmath13 . </S>",
    "<S> the number distribution of satellite galaxies in groups of a given mass follows a poisson distribution , in agreement with the occupation statistics of dark matter sub - halos . </S>",
    "<S> this provides strong support for the standard lore that satellite galaxies reside in sub - halos . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we measure the fraction of satellites , which changes from @xmath14 for galaxies with @xmath15 to @xmath16 for galaxies with @xmath17 . </S>"
