    "we say that a @xmath4-gon , or a complete @xmath4-gon , is circumscribed around a smooth conic @xmath0 if the sides of the polygon , i.e. the @xmath4 lines , are tangent to the @xmath0 .",
    "first of all let us introduce a vector bundle @xmath7 naturally associated to any set of @xmath4 lines tangent to a fixed smooth conic @xmath8 ( they were defined by schwarzenberger in @xcite ) .",
    "a set of @xmath4 lines tangent to @xmath0 corresponds by projective duality to a degree @xmath4 divisor on the dual conic @xmath9 . according to the isomorphism @xmath10 we can consider the subvariety @xmath11 defined by the equation @xmath12 ( @xmath13 are the homogeneous coordinates on @xmath14 and @xmath15 the homogeneous coordinates on @xmath16 ) and the projections @xmath17 and @xmath18 respectively on @xmath14 and @xmath16 . @xmath19 the variety @xmath20 is a double cover of @xmath14 ramified along @xmath0 . if @xmath21 then @xmath22 is a line in @xmath14 tangent to @xmath0 . if , instead of considering a point , we are considering a line bundle on @xmath16 we will find a vector bundle of rank two on @xmath14 by taking the direct image of its inverse image .",
    "moreover , following scwharzenberger , we know a very explicit resolution of this bundle . indeed , tensorizing the following exact sequence @xmath23 by @xmath24 and taking its direct image by @xmath17 we have : @xmath25 the map @xmath26 can be represented by the matrix of linear forms : @xmath27 let us show that the zero locus @xmath28 of a non zero section @xmath29 is the set of @xmath3 vertices of the @xmath4 tangent lines to @xmath0 given by the corresponding @xmath4 points on @xmath30 .",
    "we denote by @xmath31 this set of @xmath4 points on @xmath30 .",
    "since @xmath32 , the section @xmath33 corresponds to an hyperplane @xmath34 .",
    "this hyperplane meets the image @xmath35 of @xmath36 in @xmath37 ( by the veronese imbedding @xmath38 ) along @xmath4 points which correspond to the points of the divisor @xmath31 .",
    "the section @xmath33 induces a rational map @xmath39 which is not defined over the zero - scheme @xmath28 .",
    "more precisely let @xmath40 be a point in @xmath14 and @xmath41 its dual line .",
    "this dual line corresponds by the veronese morphism to a two - secant line of @xmath35 ( call it @xmath42 again ) . if @xmath42 is not a two secant line to @xmath31 there is exactly one intersection point @xmath43 which is the image of @xmath40 by @xmath44 .",
    "conversely the map @xmath44 is not well defined when @xmath45 , i.e. when @xmath42 is a two - secant line to @xmath31 , or equivalently when @xmath40 is a vertex of two tangent lines to @xmath0 along @xmath31 .",
    "we can prove now the so - called darboux theorem ( @xcite , page 248 ) .",
    "[ da ] let @xmath46 be a curve of degree @xmath47 .",
    "if there is a complete @xmath4-gon ( polygon with @xmath4 sides ) tangent to a smooth conic @xmath0 and inscribed into @xmath48 , then there are infinitely many of them .",
    "i recall here a proof already written in @xcite .",
    "a complete @xmath4-gon circumscribed around @xmath0 and inscribed into @xmath48 corresponds to a non - zero global section @xmath49 vanishing along its vertices @xmath28 : @xmath50 by the remark of the previous section ( [ prelim ] ) , the curve @xmath48 corresponds to a global section of @xmath51 .",
    "since the map @xmath52 is surjective , there exists a non - zero section @xmath53 ( i.e. another @xmath4-gon ) such that the determinant @xmath54 is the equation of @xmath48 .",
    "this proves the theorem since any linear combination of @xmath33 and @xmath55 vanish along the vertices of a complete @xmath4-gon .",
    "these curves described by darboux are called _",
    "poncelet curves_. when @xmath56 they are the so - called lurth quartics ( see @xcite ) .",
    "let us now consider @xmath4-gons that are simultaneously inscribed in a smooth conic and circumscribed around a other one . for these configurations poncelet proved ( @xcite , page 362 ) :",
    "let us consider one such @xmath4-gon .",
    "it is the union of @xmath4 lines @xmath58 with the @xmath3 vertices @xmath59 for @xmath60 and @xmath61 .",
    "there is a non - zero section @xmath29 vanishing along the vertices of these lines .",
    "we denote by @xmath28 the set of these vertices .",
    "let us tensorize the following exact sequence @xmath62 by @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath64 consists in @xmath4-points , it induces the following decomposition of @xmath7 along @xmath1 : @xmath65 according to this decomposition , we consider the following exact sequence : @xmath66 where @xmath67 is a rank two vector bundle over @xmath14 . taking the cohomology long exact sequence we verify immediately that @xmath68 .",
    "then , let us consider a pencil of sections of @xmath67 and also the pencil of sections of @xmath7 induced by it .",
    "we obtain a commutative diagram : @xmath69 the sheaf @xmath70 is supported by a curve @xmath71 of degree @xmath47 that is the determinant of a pencil of sections of @xmath7 .",
    "this curve @xmath71 is a poncelet curve .",
    "then a general point on @xmath71 is a vertex of a complete @xmath4-gon inscribed in @xmath71 and circumscribed around @xmath0 .",
    "moreover any intersection point of the @xmath4 lines forming the @xmath4-gon with @xmath71 is a vertex of this @xmath4-gon ( it is clear by bzout theorem since @xmath72 ) .",
    "let @xmath73 be the curve supporting the sheaf @xmath74 .",
    "we have of course @xmath75 .",
    "then @xmath1 is an irreducible component of a poncelet curve and by the way any general point on @xmath1 is the vertex of complete @xmath4-gon inscribed in @xmath71 .",
    "then this configuration meets the conic @xmath1 in at least ( because there are @xmath4 lines ) and at most ( because they are vertices and the decompostion of the bundle along @xmath1 is fixed ) @xmath4-points , so exactly @xmath4-points , each counting doubly .",
