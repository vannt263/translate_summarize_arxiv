    "the scheme employed to prove theorem [ thm1 ] in these notes is quite different from that in @xcite , and relies upon a characterization of _ reflectionless measures_. in this regard , one may compare the proof to that of mattila s theorem @xcite : _ suppose that @xmath0 is a finite borel measure satisfying @xmath2 for @xmath0-a.e .",

    "they proved that if @xmath0 is a @xmath4-dimensional ahlfors - david regular measure in @xmath5 , then the boundedness of the @xmath4-dimensional riesz transform in @xmath1 implies that one of the criteria for uniform rectifiability given in @xcite is satisfied .",
