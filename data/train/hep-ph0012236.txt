    "solar and atmospheric neutrino experiments have observed for a long time anomalies that are commonly interpreted as evidences in favor of neutrino oscillations with mass squared differences @xmath0 respectively ( see refs.@xcite ) .",
    "more recently , the accelerator lsnd experiment has reported the observation of @xmath1 and @xmath2 appearance  @xcite with a mass - squared difference @xmath3 the lsnd evidence in favor of neutrino oscillations has not been confirmed by other experiments , but it has not been excluded either . awaiting an independent check of the lsnd result , that will probably come soon from the miniboone experiment  @xcite , it is interesting to consider the possibility that the results of solar , atmospheric and lsnd experiments are due to neutrino oscillations . in this case , the existence of the three mass - squared differences ( [ dm2sun])([dm2lsnd ] ) with different scales implies that there are at least four massive neutrinos ( three massive neutrinos are not enough because the three @xmath4 s have different scales and do not add up to zero ) .",
    "since the mass - squared differences ( [ dm2sun])([dm2lsnd ] ) have been obtained by analyzing separately the data of each type of experiment ( solar , atmospheric and lsnd ) in terms of two - neutrino mixing , it is legitimate to ask if three different mass squared are really necessary to fit the data .",
    "the answer is `` yes '' , as explained in section  [ three ] .",
    "although the precise measurement of the invisible width of the @xmath5 boson has determined that there are only three active flavor neutrinos , @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , the possible existence of at least four massive neutrinos is not a problem , because in general flavor neutrinos are not mass eigenstates , _",
    "i.e. _ there is _ neutrino mixing _ ( see , _ e.g. _ , ref.@xcite ) .    in general ,",
    "the left - handed component @xmath9 of a flavor neutrino field is a linear combination of the left - handed components @xmath10 of neutrino fields with masses @xmath11 : @xmath12 , where @xmath13 is the unitary neutrino mixing matrix .",
    "the number of massive neutrinos is only constrained to be @xmath14 . following the old principle known as _ occam razor _ , we consider the simplest case of four massive neutrinos that allows to explain all data with neutrino oscillations  @xcite . in this case , in the flavor basis the usual three active neutrinos @xmath6",
    ", @xmath7 , @xmath8 , are associated with a sterile neutrino , @xmath15 , that is a singlet of the electroweak group .",
    "taking into account the measured hierarchy @xmath16 there are only six types of possible four - neutrino schemes , which are shown in fig.[4schemes ] .",
    "these six schemes are divided in two classes : 3 + 1 and 2 + 2 . in both classes",
    "there are two groups of neutrino masses separated by the lsnd gap , of the order of 1 ev , such that the largest mass - squared difference generates the oscillations observed in the lsnd experiment : @xmath17 ( where @xmath18 ) . in 3 + 1 schemes",
    "there is a group of three neutrino masses separated from an isolated mass by the lsnd gap . in 2 + 2 schemes",
    "there are two pairs of close masses separated by the lsnd gap .",
    "the numbering of the mass eigenvalues in fig .",
    "[ 4schemes ] is conveniently chosen in order to have always solar neutrino oscillations generated by @xmath19 . in 3 + 1 schemes",
    "atmospheric neutrino oscillations are generated by @xmath20 , whereas in 2 + 2 schemes they are generated by @xmath21 .    in 1999",
    "the 3 + 1 schemes were rather strongly disfavored by the experimental data , with respect to the 2 + 2 schemes  @xcite . in june 2000",
    "the lsnd collaboration presented the results of a new improved analysis of their data , leading to an allowed region in the @xmath22@xmath4 plane ( @xmath23 is the two - generation mixing angle ) that is larger and shifted towards lower values of @xmath22 , with respect to the 1999 allowed region .",
    "this implies that the 3 + 1 schemes are now marginally compatible with the data .",
    "therefore , in section  [ 3 + 1 ] i discuss the 3 + 1 schemes , that have been recently revived  @xcite . in section",
    "[ 2 + 2 ] i discuss the 2 + 2 schemes , that are still favored by the data .",
    "let us consider the general expression of the probability of @xmath24 transitions in vacuum valid for any number of massive neutrinos : @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the source - detector distance , @xmath27 is the neutrino energy , and @xmath28 is anyone of the mass eigenstate indices ( a phase common to all terms in the sum in eq.([prob ] ) is irrelevant )",
    ".    if all the phases @xmath29 s are very small , oscillations are not observable because the probability reduces to @xmath30 .",
    "since the lsnd experiment has the smallest average @xmath31 , of the order of @xmath32 , at least one @xmath33 , denoted by @xmath34 , must be larger than about @xmath35 in order to generate the observed @xmath1 and @xmath2 lsnd transitions , whose measured probability is of the order of @xmath36 .",
    "solar neutrino experiments observe large transitions of @xmath6 s into other states , with an average probability of about 1/2 .",
    "these transitions can not be generated by a @xmath37 because they should have been observed by the long - baseline chooz experiment  @xcite .",
    "hence , at least another @xmath33 smaller than about @xmath38 , denoted by @xmath39 , is needed for the oscillations of solar neutrinos .",
    "the necessary existence of at least a third @xmath33 for atmospheric neutrino oscillations is less obvious , but can be understood by noticing that a dependence of the transition probability from the energy @xmath27 and/or from the distance @xmath26 is observable only if at least one phase @xmath29 is of order one .",
    "indeed , all the exponentials with phase @xmath40 can be approximated to one , whereas all the exponentials with phase @xmath41 are washed out by the averages over the energy resolution of the detector and the uncertainty in the source - detector distance .",
    "since the super - kamiokande atmospheric neutrino experiment measures a variation of the oscillation probability for @xmath42 ( see ref.@xcite ) , there must be at least one @xmath33 in the range @xmath43 , which is out of the ranges allowed for @xmath39 and @xmath34 .",

    "the possibility ( [ fate ] ) is attractive because it represents a perturbation of the standard three - neutrino mixing in which a mass eigenstate is added , that mixes mainly with the new sterile neutrino @xmath15 and very weakly with the standard active neutrinos @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 . in this case",
    ", the usual phenomenology of three - neutrino mixing in solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillation experiments is practically unchanged : the atmospheric neutrino anomaly would be explained by dominant @xmath71 transitions , with possible sub - dominant @xmath72 transitions constrained by the chooz bound , and the solar neutrino problem would be explained by an approximately equal mixture of @xmath73 and @xmath74 transitions ( see , for example , ref.@xcite ) .",
