    "dynamical relaxation processes near massive black holes ( mbh ) in galactic centers affect the rates of strong stellar interactions with the mbh , such as tidal disruption , tidal dissipation , or gravitational wave ( gw ) emission ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "these relaxation processes may also be reflected by the dynamical properties of the different stellar populations there @xcite , as observed in the galactic center @xcite .",
    "of particular importance , in anticipation of the planned laser interferometer space antenna ( lisa ) gw detector , is to understand the role of relaxation in regulating the rate of gw emission events from compact remnants undergoing quasi - periodic extreme mass ratio inspiral ( emri ) into mbhs .    two - body relaxation , or non - coherent relaxation ( nr ) , is inherent to any discrete large - n system , due to the cumulative effect of uncorrelated two - body encounters .",
    "these cause the orbital energy @xmath1 and the angular momentum @xmath2 to change in a random - walk fashion ( @xmath3 ) on the typically long nr timescale @xmath4 .",
    "in contrast , when the gravitational potential has approximate symmetries that restrict orbital evolution ( e.g. fixed ellipses in a keplerian potential ; fixed orbital planes in a spherical potential ) , the perturbations on a test star are no longer random , but correlated , leading to coherent ( @xmath5 ) torquing of @xmath2 on short timescales , while the symmetries hold . over longer times , this results in resonant relaxation ( rr ) ( @xcite ;  [ ss : rr ] ) , a rapid random walk of @xmath2 on the typically short rr timescale @xmath6 .",
    "rr in a near - keplerian potential can change both the direction and magnitude of @xmath7 ( `` scalar rr '' ) , thereby driving stars to near - radial orbits that interact strongly with the mbh .",
    "rr in a near - spherical potential can only change the direction of @xmath7 ( `` vector rr '' ) .",
    "rr is particularly relevant in the potential near a mbh , where compact emri candidates originate .",
    "@xcite show that rr dominates emri source dynamics . depending on its still poorly - determined efficiency , rr can either increase the emri rate over that predicted assuming nr only , or if too efficient , it can strongly suppress the emri rate by throwing the compact remnants into infall ( plunge ) orbits ( cf fig .",
    "[ f : emri ] below ) that emit a single , non - periodic and hard to detect gw burst .",
    "a prime motivation for the systematic numerical investigation of rr efficiency presented here , are the still open questions about the implications of rr for emri rates and orbital properties .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in ",
    "[ s : theory ] we briefly review the theory of nr and rr relaxation and derive a new relation between scalar and vector rr . in ",
    "[ s : acf ] we describe our method of analyzing and quantifying the effects of rr in @xmath0-body simulations , which are described in  [ s : simulations ] .",
    "we present our results in  [ s : results ] and discuss and summarize them in  [ s : conclusions ] .",
    "the nr time for @xmath1-relaxation , @xmath8 , corresponds to the time it takes non - coherent 2-body interactions to change the stellar orbital energy by order of itself , @xmath9 ( by stellar dynamical definition convention , @xmath10 for a bound orbit ) .",
    "similarly , the nr time for @xmath2-relaxation , @xmath11 , corresponds to the time it takes the stellar orbital angular momentum to change by order of the circular angular momentum @xmath12 , where near a mbh of mass @xmath13 , @xmath14 .",
    "the @xmath1-relaxation timescale can be estimated by considering the rate @xmath15 of gravitational collisions in a system of size @xmath16 at a relative velocity @xmath17 , between a test star and @xmath0 field stars of mass @xmath18 and space density @xmath19 , at the minimal impact parameter where the small angle deflection assumption still holds , @xmath20 .",
    "the collision rate is then @xmath21 .",
    "taking into account also collisions at larger impact parameters increases the rate by the coulomb logarithm factor @xmath22 .",
    "therefore , @xmath23 . near the mbh @xmath24 , and so @xmath25 , where @xmath26 is the mass ratio .",
    "when the stars move under the influence of the central mbh ( @xmath27 ) , the relaxation time can be expressed as @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is the keplerian period . following the notation of @xcite ( rt96 ) , the nr changes in @xmath1 , @xmath2 and @xmath7 over the dimensionless time - lag @xmath30 are@xmath31 where @xmath32 and @xmath33 are dimensionless constants , whose exact values are system - dependent and",
    "can not be estimated with accuracy without detailed calculations or simulations .",
    "the corresponding nr timescales are related to these coefficients by @xmath34 , @xmath35 and @xmath36 .      when the potential has symmetries that restrict the orbital evolution , for example to fixed ellipses in the potential of a point mass , or to planar annuli in a spherical potential , the perturbations on a test star are no longer random , but correlated .",
    "this leads to a coherent changes in @xmath7 on times @xmath37 , @xmath38 , by the residual torque @xmath39 exerted by the @xmath0 randomly oriented , orbit - averaged mass distributions of the surrounding stars ( mass wires for elliptical orbits in a kepler potential , mass annuli for rosette - like orbits in a spherical potential ) .",
    "the coherence time @xmath40 is set by deviations from the true symmetry , which lead to a gradual orbital drift and to the randomization of @xmath41 .",
    "for example , the enclosed stellar mass leads to non - keplerian retrograde precession ; general relativity leads to prograde precession .",
    "ultimately , the coherent torques themselves randomize the orbits ( alternatively , this can be viewed as the result of potential fluctuations due to the finite number of stars ) . the effective coherence time is set by the shortest de - coherence ( quenching ) process in the system . the accumulated change over @xmath40 , @xmath42 , then becomes the basic step - size , or mean free path in @xmath7-space , for the long - term ( @xmath43 ) non - coherent ( @xmath3 ) relaxation of @xmath7 .",
    "since this step - size is large , rr can be much faster than nr .",
    "the rr timescale @xmath44 is then defined by @xmath45 .",
    "note that the relaxation of _",
    "@xmath1 _ is not affected by rr because the potential of the system is stationary on the coherence timescale , and so @xmath1 changes incoherently on all time scales .",
    "the torques exerted by elliptical mass wires in a kepler potential can change both the direction and magnitude of * j*. in contrast , the torques exerted by planar annuli can only change the direction of * j*.    here we consider only newtonian dynamics . the coherence timescale for scalar rr",
    "is determined by the time it takes for the orbital apsis to precess by angle @xmath46 due to the potential of the enclosed stellar mass ( `` mass precession''),@xmath47 where @xmath48 is an @xmath49 factor reflecting the approximations in this estimate .",
    "the coherence timescale for vector rr is determined by the time it takes for the coherent torques to change @xmath50 ( alternatively , this is the timescale @xmath51 to accumulate @xmath49 fluctuations in the stellar potential @xmath52 relative to the total gravitational potential @xmath53 as the stars rotate by @xmath46 on their orbits ) ,    @xmath54p\\,,\\ ] ]    where @xmath55 is an @xmath49 factor , @xmath56 and where the approximate equality is for the keplerian limit @xmath57 .",

    "accurate determination of their values requires detailed calculations or simulations .",

    "they analyzed the results both star by star and in the average and observed the coherent growth of @xmath73 and @xmath74 relative to the simulation s initial values .",
    "although the evolution of the of these quantities for any single star was very noisy and the proportionality factors had a very large scatter , rr was clearly observed , as predicted .",
    "the population averages of the scalar and vector coefficients @xmath75 and @xmath76 , are not independent quantities .",
    "rather , @xmath77 , and @xmath78 ( on timescales @xmath79 ) , where the constant @xmath80 depends on the averaging procedure . here",
    "we average @xmath81 and @xmath82 by the rms over the stellar population (  [ s : acf ] ) .",
    "we focus on the limit where @xmath83 , and assume that the change is isotropic on average , @xmath84 , ( _ @xmath85 _ ) , as is indicated by our simulations (  [ s : simulations ] ) .",
    "the rms of vector rr is @xmath86 . defining the @xmath87-axis along @xmath7 , then @xmath88 in the small change limit , and",
    "its rms is @xmath89 .",
    "therefore ( see eqs .",
    "[ e : etasl ] , [ e : etavl ] , [ e : betas ] , [ e : betav ] ) @xmath90 for all @xmath91 and @xmath92 for @xmath93 , as is indeed seen in the simulations is used to define @xmath76 , then @xmath94 . ]",
    "[ f : q1e6 ] ) .",
    "the constant ratio between the population averages of the vector and scalar coefficients is in part a geometrical effect ( 1d vs 3d changes ) and in part a reflection of the symmetries of the perturbations ( isotropic @xmath95 ) .",
    "this strict proportionality is not expected to hold when @xmath96 , for example when only very eccentric stars ( @xmath97 ) are included in the sample , or for very long time - lags .",
    "given the high computational cost of the @xmath0-body simulations , and the very large variance in the evolution of individual orbits , it is essential to extract the rr signal as efficiently and robustly as possible from the simulated data .",
    "after some experimentation , we adopted the auto - correlation analysis for detecting and measuring rr in @xmath0-body simulation snapshots .",
    "our procedure is as follows .",
    "\\(1 ) the stellar phase space coordinates are transformed to the rest - frame of the mbh , which is almost identical with the center of mass in the near - keplerian system close to the mbh .",
    "\\(2 ) the energy @xmath98 , angular momentum @xmath99 , circular angular momentum @xmath100 and keplerian period @xmath101 are calculated for the @xmath102th star @xmath103 at discrete times @xmath104 in the simulation ( `` snapshots '' ) .",
    "\\(3 ) to make full use of the data , we assign a normalized time - lag @xmath105 for each pair of times @xmath106 . for each of the _ @xmath0 _",
    "stars , we calculate the normalized energy and angular momentum differences at all lags , @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 .",
    "\\(4 ) the differences from all stars are binned into discrete @xmath91-bins according to their associated @xmath110 .",
    "the bin rms values and their standard deviations are calculated and plotted against the bin s average time - lag @xmath111 , thereby creating the auto - correlation curve .    by using all possible time - lags recorded in the simulation ,",
    "this approach makes maximal use of the entire data set and averages over the strongly fluctuating individual relaxation curves ( cf the rt96 procedure ,  [ ss : rr ] ) .",
    "however , this method is not entirely free of bin - to - bin bias .",
    "since the number of orbital periods completed by a star with a mean period @xmath112 over the simulation time @xmath113 is @xmath114 , long - period stars will not contribute to a high-@xmath91 bin , @xmath115 if @xmath116 .",
    "conversely , short - period stars will not contribute to a low-@xmath91 bin , @xmath115 , if @xmath117 , where @xmath118 is set by the minimal time difference between consecutive snapshots .",
    "in extreme cases some stars may not contribute to the relaxation curve at any @xmath115 .",
    "since long and short period stars could well have systematically different responses to rr , this introduces bias to the relaxation curve .",
    "this bias can be minimized , at the cost of losing some information , by using only the middle range of the @xmath91 -bins , or at a computational cost , by longer simulations with a higher snapshot rate .",

    "the @xmath0-body code must maintain phase coherence to a high enough accuracy to reliably simulate rr .",
    "it is thus important to verify that the numerical phase drift in the simulation is much smaller than that due to physical processes , such as mass precession .",
    "experience shows that most of the phase drift @xmath133 accumulates near periapse , where the acceleration is largest , and is therefore more pronounced in eccentric orbits .",

    "this small fractional difference and the relatively low statistics of our simulation suite may explain why we do not detect a clear @xmath153-dependence in these quantities .",
