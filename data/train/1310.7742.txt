    "in a dusty plasma , the interaction energy between neighbouring dust particles is often much larger than their thermal energy , leading to strong correlation effects between them .",
    "this leads to the dust species to exist in a strongly coupled state with a coupling parameter @xmath0 , where @xmath1 , @xmath2 are the charge , temperature of the dust grain and @xmath3 is the distance between the dust grains .",
    "the propagation of collective modes in a plasma is influenced by the strong correlation effects between dust particles and the dispersion relations can be studied using the generalized hydrodynamics model@xcite-@xcite that is appropriate for studying wave motions in the long wave length limit . for a strongly coupled dusty plasma still existing in a fluid state ,",
    "the existence of a novel transverse shear mode supported by solid - like rigidity of the medium has been predicted@xcite and also experimentally verified .",
    "molecular dynamics simulations carried out by ohta and hamaguchi@xcite have identified such shear modes in the fluid phase of yukawa systems and obtained dispersion relations that are in reasonably good agreement with theoretical estimates . in a medium with inhomogenous charge distribution",
    ", the shear modes have been found to be driven unstable@xcite through the dynamics of dust charge fluctuations@xcite .",
    "another important outcome arising out of the inhomogeneous effect is the coupling of the shear and compressional modes that can exploited to find new mechanisms for excitation of shear modes .",
    "such coupling also exists@xcite among the longitudinal and transverse dust lattice modes@xcite and arises due to equilibrium dust charge gradients and particle wake - interactions leading to a dust lattice mode instability . in a non - newtonian fluid",
    ", a coupling between inhomogeneous viscous force and viscosity gradient leads to another novel instability of the transverse shear mode@xcite .",
    "in a two dimensional complex plasma , viscoelastic vortical flows covering a wide scale of spatial and temporal scales have been observed@xcite and the driving mechanism for such vortex formation is thought to be the charge inhomogeneity across such layer .    in the present work",
    ", we attempt to study the propagation of linear transverse shear modes propagating in a strongly coupled dusty plasma having a density gradient in the plane of propagation of the waves .",
    "the plasma is considered to be incompressible so as to study the effects of density inhomogeneity on the dispersion characteristics of the shear modes in the absence of any coupling to the acoustic modes@xcite .",
    "in a dusty plasma consisting of electrons , ions and dust particles , the charged dust component can easily go into the strongly coupled regime with large values of @xmath4 because of the large charge on the dust grains and/or small values of dust temperature while the electrons and ions are in the weakly coupled regime . in",
    "the regime @xmath5 ( @xmath6 is the critical value beyond which crystallization sets in ) , the medium exhibits both viscous and elastic properties and is known as a viscoelastic medium .",
    "an intrinsic feature of viscoelastic media is to exhibit the memory of accumulated shear strain showing viscous effects on long time scales but elastic on short - time scales .",
    "the elementary concepts of viscosity and elasticity can be combined in a number of ways to obtain model equations describing viscoelastic fluids .",
    "maxwell model of viscoelasticity@xcite links the elastic part of stress to strain via an exponentially decaying memory function .",
    "a simple generalization@xcite of the navier stokes equation for an incompressible fluid taking into account maxwell s relaxation elasticity consists in replacing the normal viscosity coefficient @xmath7 by a viscoelastic operator @xmath8 leading to a generalized momentum equation of hydrodynamics given by @xmath9          = \\eta \\nabla^2 { \\bf u}_d          \\label{gme}\\ ] ] where the convective derivative @xmath10 . here",

    "the above equation takes into account the shearing elasticity of the incompressible fluid , which though negligible for small values of @xmath17 , becomes an important factor for large values of viscosity when solid like correlations begin to appear in the medium . a more general model applicable to a compressible fluid and involving both bulk and shear moduli is obtained@xcite,@xcite by considering a nonlocal viscoelastic operator . for @xmath19 , equation([gme",
    "] ) reduces to the standard navier - stokes hydrodynamic equation .",
    "the generalized hydrodynamic model is known to support propagation of undamped transverse shear modes in the kinetic limit characterized by wave frequencies @xmath20 . in order to study such modes",
    ", we take the curl of the linearized momentum equation ( [ gme ] ) considering an incompressible plasma ( @xmath21 ) , to obtain @xmath22 while deriving the above equation , electrostatic approximation has been assumed .",
    "this assumption is justified for the low frequency modes being considered here .",
    "for a two dimensional incompressible plasma , @xmath23 implies the solution for the velocity as @xmath24 , where @xmath25 is velocity potential with @xmath26 . for an inhomogeneous plasma with @xmath27",
    ", we obtain from equation([gme1 ] ) @xmath28 where @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and @xmath31 is the constant dust density .",

    "is given by @xmath38 that gives the following dispersion relation describing transverse shear modes : @xmath39 where @xmath32 describes the propagation velocity of the transverse shear mode .",
    "equation([gme2 ] ) can be solved for various equilibrium density profiles to obtain the eigen - solutions and eigenvalues . a nonlinear model for dust vortex flows using the gh equation",
    "has been shown@xcite to admit several kinds of vortex structures including the classical dipolar vortex solution .",

    "for a plasma with nonuniform density , solutions of equation([gme2 ] ) can be obtained by solving the following equation @xmath44 for appropriately chosen functional forms for the density profile @xmath45 , as well as @xmath46 , where , for a uniform plasma , @xmath47 describes the transformation to a moving frame of reference such that @xmath48 , with @xmath46 satisfying the equation @xmath49 .",
    "nontrivial solutions for @xmath46 lead to an inhomogeneous term in equation ( 5 ) that is in general difficult to solve . throughout the present work",

    "\\(a ) firstly , we consider the propagation of shear waves in one dimension with @xmath52 and density variation @xmath53 where @xmath54 is the inverse of characteristic scale length of the density inhomogeneity .",
    "the chosen density profile is similar to a gaussian profile that is observed in plasmas mostly controlled by diffusion process and has the advantage that exact solutions can be obtained for such a profile the eigen - values of equation([gme3 ] ) are obtained as @xmath55 where @xmath56 .",

    "( b)next , a two dimensional extension to case ( a ) can be obtained by considering @xmath59 , with @xmath60 .",
    "regular solutions to the inhomogeneous shear wave equation ( [ gme3 ] ) can be obtained @xcite only if the mode frequencies are discrete with @xmath61 given by @xmath62 the value of @xmath63 is determined by the sum @xmath64 with the lowest value given by @xmath65 and the subsequent values given by @xmath66 . for each such value of frequency , we get a corresponding shear mode eigenfunction . the solutions for the velocity component @xmath67 are obtained as @xmath68 where @xmath69 is a gegenbauer polynomial , @xmath70 is a normalization constant .",
