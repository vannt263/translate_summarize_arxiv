    "the existence of a dominant dark matter component in the universe has been firmly established by cosmological observations in the last few years notably by sdss  @xcite and wmap  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the amount of dm today , the relic density , has been measured with very good precision , @xmath1  @xcite . a leading candidate for cold dm",
    "is a new weakly interacting stable massive particle which naturally provides a reasonable value for the relic density .",
    "it is particulary interesting that extensions of the standard model ( sm ) whose prime goal is to solve the hierarchy problem can in many cases also provide a viable dm candidate .",
    "such particles arise naturally in many extensions of the standard model  @xcite from the minimal supersymmetric standard model  @xcite to models of extra dimensions  @xcite , little higgs models  @xcite or models with extended gauge or higgs sectors  @xcite . in these models which possess a symmetry like r - parity that guarantees the stability of the lightest odd particle",
    ", the dm candidate can be either a majorana fermion , a dirac fermion , a vector boson or a scalar .",
    "their masses range anywhere from a few gev s to a few tev s .",
    "astroparticle and collider experiments are being actively pursued to search for dm . combined studies of dm signals in these different types of experiments should provide the necessary ingredients to unravel the nature of dm .",
    "these involve searches for dm either directly through detection of elastic scattering of the dm with the nuclei in a large detector or indirectly trough detection of products of dm annihilation ( photons , positrons , neutrinos or antiprotons ) in the galaxy or in the sun .",
    "furthermore colliders are searching for dm as well as for other new particles predicted in extensions of the standard model .",
    "sophisticated tools have been developed to perform computations of dm observables within r - parity conserving supersymmetric models , four are publicly available :  @xcite , darksusy  @xcite , isatools  @xcite and superiso  @xcite . all",
    "include precise computations of the relic density as well as various constraints on the model from precision observables or the flavour sector .",
    "in addition the first three compute the direct and indirect detection rates while   and ` isatools ` provide collider observables .",
    "has the added important feature that it can be easily generalised to other extensions of the standard model  @xcite .",
    "this is because micromegas is structured around calchep  @xcite a generic program which once given a model file containing the list of particles , their masses and the associated feynman rules describing their interactions , computes any cross - section in the model .",
    "the standard   routines can then be used to compute the relic density as well as other dm observables .",
    "a relic density calculation entails solving the evolution equation for the abundance of dm , @xmath2 , defined as the number density divided by the entropy density ,  @xcite ) @xmath3 where @xmath4 is an effective number of degree of freedom , @xmath5 is the planck mass and @xmath6 the thermal equilibrium abundance .",
    "@xmath7 is the relativistic thermally averaged annihilation cross - section .",
    "the dependence on the specific particle physics model enters only in this cross - section which includes all annihilation and coannihilation channels , @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of degree of freedom , @xmath10 the total cross - section for annihilation of a pair of odd particles with masses @xmath11 , @xmath12 into some standard model particles @xmath13 , and @xmath14 is the momentum ( total energy ) of the incoming particles in their center - of - mass frame .    integrating eq .",
    "[ dydt ] from @xmath15 to @xmath16 leads to the present day abundance @xmath17 needed in the estimation of the relic density , @xmath18 where @xmath19 is the entropy density at present time and @xmath20 the normalized hubble constant .    to compute the relic density ,   solves the equation for the abundance eq .",
    "[ dydt ] , numerically without any approximation .",
    "the computation of all annihilation and coannihilation cross - sections are done exactly at tree - level . for this",
    "we rely on calchep  @xcite . in the thermally averaged cross - section , eq .",
    "[ sigmav ] , coannihilation channels are compiled and added only when necessary , that is when the mass difference with the lop does not exceed a value determined by the user .",
    "was first developed for the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) . in this model the large number of annihilation channels made automation desirable . for this reason",
    "was based on calchep  @xcite .",
    "the generalisation to other particle physics models was then straigthforward and only requires specifying the new model file into calchep  @xcite . in order",
    "that the program finds the list of processes that need to be computed for the thermally averaged annihilation cross - section , relevant for the relic density calculation , one needs to specify the analogous of r - parity and assign a parity odd or even to every particle in the model .",
    "the standard model particles have an even parity .",
    "the lightest odd particle will then be identified with the dm candidate .",
    "automatically generates all processes of the type @xmath21 where @xmath22 designates all r - parity odd particle and x , y all r - parity even particles .   then looks for s - channel poles as well as for thresholds to adapt the integration routines for higher accuracies in these specific regions , and performs the relic density calculation .",
    "note that the code can also compute the relic density of a charged particle , this quantity can for example be used to extract the relic density of the gravitino dm .",
    "our approach is very general and , as long as one sticks to tree - level masses and cross - sections , necessitates minimal work from the user beyond the definition of the model file .",
    "however it has been demonstrated that for an accurate relic density calculation it is necessary in many cases to take into account higher - order corrections . in particular corrections to the mass of either the lop or of any particle that can appear in s - channel",
    "are important , for example the corrections to higgs masses in the mssm or its extensions .",
    "the large qcd corrections to the higgs width must also be taken into account when annihilation occurs near a higgs resonance . in general",
    "one expects that these loop corrections can be implemented via an effective lagrangian . in practice",
    "then it might be necessary for the user to implement additional routines or interface other programs to take these effects into account .",
    "this was done explicitly for the nmssm  @xcite , the cpvmssm  @xcite and the mssm with dirac gaugino masses  @xcite .",
    "another advantage of our approach based on a generic program like calchep is that one can compute in addition any cross - section or decay width in the new model considered . in particular ,",
    "tree - level cross - sections for @xmath23 processes and decay widths of particles are available .",
    "furthermore the cross - sections times relative velocity , @xmath24 , for dm annihilation at @xmath25 and the yields for the continuum @xmath26 spectra , relevant for indirect detection of dm , are also automatically computed .",
    "the procedure to extract the elastic scattering cross section is described next .",
    "in direct detection , one measures the recoil energy deposited by the scattering of dm ( @xmath27 ) with the nuclei .",
    "generically dm - nuclei interactions can be split into spin independent ( scalar ) and spin dependent interations .",
    "the scalar interactions add coherently in the nucleus so heavy nuclei offer the best sensitivity .",
    "on the other hand , spin dependent interactions rely mainly on one unpaired nucleon and therefore dominate over scalar interactions only for light nuclei unless scalar interactions are themselves suppressed . in both cases ,",
    "the cross - section for the dm nuclei interaction is typically low , so large detectors are required .",
    "many experiments involving a variety of nuclei have been set up .",
    "the best limit for spin independent interactions was reported recently by cdms with @xmath28 pb for a dm mass around 70 gev  @xcite .",
    "this limit already probes a fraction of the parameter space of dm models .",
    "many ingredients enter the calculation of the direct detection rate and cover both astroparticle , particle and nuclear physics aspects .",
    "the detection rate depends on the @xmath27-nucleus cross section which is derived from the interaction at the quark level .",
    "the different matrix elements for @xmath29 interactions have to be converted into effective couplings of dms to protons and nucleons , this is done through coefficients that describe the quark content in the nucleons .",
    "note that the dm have small velocities , therefore the momentum transfer , is very small as compared to the masses of the dm and/or nuclei and the @xmath27-nucleon elastic cross sections can be calculated in the limit of zero momentum transfer .",
    "the distribution of the number of events over the recoil energy for spin independent interactions reads @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the dm density near the earth , @xmath32 the mass of the detector , @xmath33 the exposure time , @xmath34 is an integral over the velocity distribution and @xmath35 is the nucleus form factor which depends on the momentum transfer .",
    "the coefficients @xmath36 contain all particle physics dependence and are extracted from the matrix elements for @xmath29 scattering coupled with coefficients that describe the quark content in the nucleons .",
    "traditionally the coefficients @xmath37 of the low energy effective @xmath29 lagrangian are evaluated symbolically using fiertz identities .",
    "instead in   we use an original approach that allows to handle a generic model .",
    "first we expand the @xmath29 interactions over a set of basic point - like operators , only a few operators are necessary in the @xmath38 limit .",
    "the same operators also describe the dm - nucleon interactions .",
    "for example for @xmath39 interactions of a majorana fermion with quarks or nucleons the effective lagrangian reads @xmath40   creates automatically a new model file that contains these operators as new auxiliary vertices in the model .",
    "calchep then generates and calculates symbolically all diagrams for dm - quark / anti - quark elastic scattering at zero momentum transfer .",
    "the interference terms beetween one normal vertex and one auxiliary vertex allow to evaluate numerically the @xmath41 coefficients  @xcite .",
    "note that in the file that defines the model all quarks should be defined as massive particles .",
    "vertices that depend on light quark masses , for example the couplings of higgs to light quarks can not be neglected .",
    "the dominant term for dm quark scalar interactions is proportional to quark masses , when converting to dm nucleon interactions this quark mass will get replaced by a nucleon mass .",
    "dm annihilation in the galactic halo produces pairs of standard model particles .",
    "these particle then hadronize and decay into stable particles that evolve freely in the interstellar medium .",
    "the final states with @xmath42 , @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are particularly interesting as they are the subject of indirect searches .",
    "recently many new results from indirect dm searches have been released notably by pamela and fermi  @xcite .",
    "the rate for the production of these particles can be cast into @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the annihilation cross - section times the relative velocity of incoming dm particles in the zero velocity limit .",
    "@xmath48 is the mass of the dm candidate , @xmath49 is the dm density at the location @xmath50 and @xmath51 is is the energy distribution of the particle produced in one collision .",
    "the predictions for the energy spectra depend on non perturbative qcd and imply the use of monte carlo simulations such as ` pythia ` .",
    "the annihilation rates are extracted from calchep in any model .",
    "the rate for photons observed near the center of the galaxy shows a strong dependence on the halo profile in particular on the dm density near the center , a quantity that still has large uncertainties .",
    "different halo profiles are implemented in  .",
    "in addition   provides , in the mssm , the rate for gamma rays that come from direct annihilation of dm particles .",
    "this model - dependent process is loop - induced and suppressed but is nevertheless interesting because of the dramatic signature , a monochromatic gamma - ray line  @xcite .",
    "the charged particles generated from dm annihilation propagate through the galactic halo and their energy spectrum at the earth differs from the one produced at the source .",
    "charged particles are deflected by the irregularities of the galactic magnetic field , suffer energy losses from synchroton radiation and inverse compton scattering as well as diffusive reacceleration in the disk . finally galactic convection wipes away charged particles from the disk .",
    "solar modulation can also affect the low energy part of the spectrum .",
    "the equation that describes the evolution of the energy distribution for all particles ( protons , anti - protons , positrons ) reads @xmath52 where @xmath53 is the number density of particles per unit volume and energy .",
    "@xmath54 is the production rate of primary particles per unit volume and energy , eq .",
    "[ eq : dmflux ] .",
    "@xmath55 is the energy loss rate and @xmath56 is the space diffusion coefficient , assumed homogeneous , @xmath57 where @xmath58 is the particle velocity and @xmath59 its rigidity .",
    "the propagation equation is solved within a semi - analytical two - zone model . within this approach the region of diffusion of cosmic rays",
    "is represented by a thick disk of thickness @xmath60 and radius @xmath61  kpc  @xcite .",
    "the thin galactic disk where primary cosmic rays are accelerated lies in the middle and has a thickness @xmath62  pc and radius @xmath59 .",
    "the boundary conditions are such that the number density vanishes at @xmath63 and at @xmath64 .",
    "the galactic wind is directed outward along the @xmath65 direction so the convective velocity is also vertical and of constant magnitude @xmath66 .",
    "the propagation parameters @xmath67 are constrained by the analysis of the boron to carbon ratio , a quantity sensitive to cosmic ray transport  @xcite .",
    "propagation induces large uncertainties in the prediction of the spectrum from dm annihilation , furthermore extracting a signal from dm annihilation requires a careful understanding of the background as well as of astrophysical sources .",
    "only the dm signal will be included in the first version of the indirect detection module to be released soon .",
    "is a comprehensive tool for dm studies in extensions of the sm .",
    "the implementation of new models and new features are being pursued .",
    "one objective is a more precise computation of the relic density . within the mssm  @xcite it was shown that the one - loop corrections to the annihilation cross sections could be sizeable as compared with the precision expected from planck measurements .",
