    "the discovery of the haldane gap  @xcite established an important paradigm followed by the extensive studies on gapped spin chains .",
    "in particular , recent remarkable progress in high magnetic field experiments provide various data on the closing of the gap by the applied magnetic field .",
    "they stimulate a renewed interest in corresponding theoretical studies . however , because of methodological reasons the theories on gapped spin systems still lie far behind those of the exactly solvable @xmath0 heisenberg chain  @xcite . actually at present",
    "the only clue to understand the experiments are the phenomenological effective theories  @xcite and the numerical calculations which support them .    in this paper",
    ", we study the temperature dependence of the magnetization of the @xmath1 haldane chain for wide range of magnetic field .",
    "we particularly focus on the cases where the magnetic field , @xmath2 , exceeds the gap , @xmath3 .",
    "the magnetization is one of the most fundamental quantity observed in experiments . in spite of the simplicity of the problem , it is not easy to give a systematic understanding of the magnetization in such systems .",
    "numerical approaches to the problem also had difficulties .",
    "for example , quantum monte carlo ( qmc ) method  @xcite had difficulty due to small acceptance ratio in a finite magnetic field .",
    "this was overcome very recently@xcite with new formulations such as stochastic series expansion ( sse ) .",
    "taking advantage of such developments , we revisit the problem by combining various analytical approaches with numerical results obtained with modern techniques ( qmc with sse , and density matrix renormalization group(dmrg ) ) .",
    "we clarify universal features in the temperature dependence of the magnetization in the haldane chain under an applied magnetic field .",
    "our findings are applicable to general gapped one - dimensional spin systems , as well .    the hamiltonian of the heisenberg spin chain is given by @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 is the system size .",
    "the ground state of @xmath1 haldane chain is non - magnetic ( a singlet state ) and has a finite energy gap , @xmath7 , which is estimated numerically  @xcite .",
    "the system undergoes a quantum phase transition at finite magnetic field , @xmath8 ; in the haldane gap phase @xmath9 , the magnetization exponentially vanishes toward zero temperature , which is confirmed experimentally , e.g. in ref .  .",
    "on the other hand , in the @xmath10 phase ( gapless regime ) the magnetization is finite even at @xmath11 .",
    "this regime can be described by the tomonaga - luttinger ( tl ) liquid@xcite as in the @xmath0 heisenberg chain .",
    "therefore , one might expect that its magnetization also follows that of the @xmath0 heisenberg chain , which is well - known as the bonner - fisher curve  @xcite .",
    "this is , however , not the case .",
    "we show that the magnetization curve as a function of @xmath12 in the @xmath1 gapless regime has a minimum at @xmath13 and that the value of @xmath14 depends on the magnetic field .",
    "although this behavior resembles that of the three - dimensional bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) of magnons  @xcite , the origin obviously differs between the two cases since the bec at @xmath15 never occur in the one - dimensional systems  @xcite .",
    "we prove that this phenomena can be observed in general one - dimensional spin systems ( chains and ladders ) with the rotational symmetry about the magnetic field direction ( axial symmetry ) .",
    "the magnetization of the @xmath1 gapless phase has already been studied in many articles ; the field dependence of the magnetization is presented at the several fixed values of temperature  @xcite , while the particular details of its temperature dependence is overlooked .",
    "_ discussed in the sine - gordon model  @xcite the winding numbers induced by the chemical potentials , which can be interpreted as the magnetization due to the finite magnetic field in the haldane chain .",
    "this mapping describes correctly the @xmath16 case .",

    ", the comprehensive understanding of magnetization in the entire gapless regime @xmath20 was lacking , which we clarify in the present paper .",
    "various universal features are found which also apply to other one - dimensional gapped spin systems .",

    "[ sec : dis ] , we elucidate the universal features of the temperature dependence of the magnetization , and explain the numerical results . our findings on purely one - dimensional systems are also compared with the magnon bose - einstein condensation in three dimensions .",
    "let us first remind of the temperature dependence of the magnetization of the @xmath0 heisenberg chain as a reference . at present",
    "precise numerical data are easily obtained on the basis of the bethe ansatz solution ( using the integrability of the quantum transfer matrix  @xcite ) as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : half ] for the various magnetic fields . for any value of the magnetic field , as a function of the temperature ,",
    "the magnetization monotonically increases until it hits a maximum , and then monotonically decreases down to zero in the infinite temperature limit .",
    "this behavior is qualitatively the same as in the classical spin result  @xcite .",
    "the xxz chain in the gapless regime also shows a similar behavior .",
    "the decrease at low temperature is intuitively interpreted as the growth of the antiferromagnetic short range order .",
    "next , we present the qmc results for the @xmath1 haldane chain",

    "fig : magh ] by use of generic effective theories of the gapped spin chains with short - range interactions .",
    "note that the logic given in this section are not restricted to the haldane chain .",
    "excited states above the gap from the @xmath35 ground state generally consists of a triplet massive boson state with @xmath36 which usually have repulsive short - range interactions .",
    "low - energy states of these particles may be approximated by a non - relativistic dispersion relation : @xmath37 where @xmath38 is a band curvature .",
    "if an underlying relativistic theory exists , which is not necessarily the case , @xmath39 corresponds to the relativistic `` speed of light '' . as a result , the @xmath40 magnon branch intersect with the ground state at @xmath41 , a quantum phase transition point . in the gapless regime",
    "a quasi long range order appears  @xcite , where one may integrate out the @xmath42 magnons which are the higher energy states .",
    "then , in the low density limit of the magnons , @xmath43 , the remaining @xmath40 magnons can be exactly mapped onto the free fermion theory with the dispersion eq .",
    "( [ eq : dis2 ] )  @xcite .",
    "the low but finite magnon density regime , @xmath44 , can be still approximately described by the free fermion theory since residual interactions are proportional to @xmath45 . here , the magnetization is equal to the number of the particle as @xmath46 where @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 is the fermi distribution function .",
    "the density of states follow , @xmath50 , constant , and @xmath51 in one , two , and three - dimensions , respectively . then , from eq .",
    "( [ eq : fermi ] ) , the increase of the magnetization at @xmath52 in fig  [ fig : magh ] can be easily understood by the following argument ; the fermi distribution function is symmetric with respect to the fermi point @xmath53 , namely , @xmath54 .",
    "moreover , @xmath55 for @xmath56 near @xmath11 is negligibly small , since @xmath57 .",

    "[ fig : fermi ] reproduces well the minimum of @xmath61 found in fig .",
    "[ fig : magh](a ) .    the analogous mapping between the dilute boson and the free fermion holds at @xmath62 as well . in this case",
    ", the vacuum state is the fully - polarized state and the low - lying excitations consist of @xmath63 magnon branch instead of the @xmath40 one .",
    "then , the magnetization shows a maximum at low temperature corresponding to the minimum of the magnon density , just the opposite to that at @xmath44 .",
    "the behavior found in fig .",

    "[ fig : magh ] .",
    "however , it is valid only slightly above @xmath28 and below @xmath27 . on the other hand",
    ", the tl liquid theory should be applicable for the whole gapless regime in one - dimensional systems ( @xmath67 in the present case ) , albeit only in the low energy limit . in the following ,",
    "we apply the tl liquid theory to estimate the magnetization . from the conformal field theory ,",
    "the low temperature expansion of the free energy per unit volume is given by  @xcite @xmath68 where @xmath69 is an ground state energy , @xmath70 is the excitation velocity of a fixed point theory , and @xmath71 is the central charge(@xmath72 for tl liquid ) .",
    "the magnetization is given by the derivative of the free energy with respect to the magnetic field , @xmath73 the first and the second term give the magnetization of the ground state and the leading finite temperature correction , respectively .",
    "this equation indicates that whether the magnetization near @xmath11 increases or decreases is determined by the sign of the gradient of the velocity with respect to the magnetic field , @xmath74 . for the @xmath0 heisenberg chain",
    ", we always have @xmath75 ( see fig .  9 in ref .  ) ,",
    "which is consistent with fig .",
    "[ fig : half ] .",
    "in contrast , the gapless tl liquid regime in the present case has @xmath76 at both endpoints , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , so that @xmath70 must have a maximum in between .",
    "this indeed gives the characteristic behavior observed in fig .",
    "[ fig : magh ] .",
    "let us demonstrate the validity of eq .",

    "the velocity increases rapidly just above @xmath77 , takes a maximum at around @xmath98 , and then decreases toward @xmath78 , as anticipated in the previous discussion .",
    "the reason why the gradient of @xmath70 shows a sudden change at @xmath98 and @xmath99 is still out of our scheme , while the shape of @xmath70 in the whole gapless regime suggests that it might be divided into three parts according to the change of nature in its excitation spectrum .",
    "going back to fig .",
    "[ fig : magh ] we find several cases where the @xmath100 curves are almost flat in a fairly wide temperature range , e.g. , @xmath101 .",
    "apparently , this is consistent with the fact that the velocity @xmath70 takes the maximum ( @xmath102 ) at a certain field within this range , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : dmrg](b ) . at this field ,",
    "the leading finite temperature correction starts from @xmath103 .",
    "even when @xmath2 is slightly shifted from the maximum , @xmath70 depends rather weakly on @xmath2 .",
    "thus for the range of @xmath2 around the maximum , magnetization looks almost flat in the low temperature regime .",
    "so far , we have not discussed the effects of irrelevant operators on eq .",
    "( [ eq : freeenergy ] ) . generally , lorentz invariant terms never renormalize the spin - wave velocity which corresponds to the `` speed of light '' .",
    "therefore , to examine whether the corrections due to irrelevant operators are required in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tlexpa ] ) , perturbations which break lorentz invariance should be explicitly considered . in principle",
    ", irrelevant perturbations could give larger corrections than @xmath104 , e.g. in the case of the @xmath0 heisenberg chain , the marginally irrelevant operator gives a logarithmic correction to the zero magnetic field susceptibility  @xcite .",
    "generally , under the compactification of the bosonic field @xmath105 , the vertex operator @xmath106 ( @xmath107 is a constant parameter ) and @xmath108 ( m and n are integers ) can be perturbations around the tl liquid fixed point . in the present case with @xmath109 ,",
    "the former one became less relevant in the low temperature regime , @xmath110 .",
    "this is because it usually takes a form of @xmath111 , remaining negligible in the low energy limit .",
    "then , the @xmath112-term becomes the leading perturbation , since the @xmath113 and @xmath114-terms are exactly absorbed into @xmath115 and @xmath116 is forbidden by the parity symmetry ( @xmath117 and @xmath118 ) . by a standard dimension analysis",
    ", this term again leads to a @xmath104 correction to eq .",
    "( [ eq : tlexpa ] ) . this correction should be understood as already included in eq .",
    "( [ eq : tlexpa ] ) , which thus stands valid .",
    "let us now return to the discussion to the characteristic temperature that give the magnetization minimum , @xmath14 .",
    "it can be interpreted as a crossover temperature from the tl liquid to the state with non - relativistic dispersion , @xmath119 , which is indicated by the arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig : crossover ] . at @xmath120 ,",
    "the system can be described by a tl liquid with linearized dispersions around the two fermi points ( @xmath121 ) . however , with increasing @xmath122 , the effect of band curvature becomes more important due to thermal excitations .    here",
    "we propose a new way to estimate a gap from @xmath14 .",
    "equation  ( [ eq : polylog ] ) takes the minimum under the condition , @xmath123\\big/{\\rm li}_{n=-1/2}[-{\\rm e}^x]$ ] , where @xmath124 .",
    "its solution , @xmath125 , yields @xmath126 the finite temperature measurement of magnetization at several @xmath25 in both experiments and numerical calculations thus provide a reasonable estimation of @xmath3 .",
    "since eq .",
    "( [ eq : mini ] ) consists only of universal constant we can use it without any microscopic informations of the system . as a demonstration ,",
    "we show in fig .",
    "[ fig : mini ] the comparison of our monte carlo results with eq .",
    "( [ eq : mini ] ) .",
    "the data asymptotically approaches eq .",
    "( [ eq : mini ] ) toward @xmath127 since the deviation at large @xmath2 is due to the interaction effect of the magnons .",
    "note that all the data at @xmath128 in fig .",
    "[ fig : mini ] are located below the values given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : mini ] ) .",
    "this behavior is rather universal for generic models as follows ; the excitations to the higher energy modes are enhanced by the repulsive interactions , so that , even in low temperature regime , the band curvature effect in the exact results becomes more important than that in the free case .",
    "consequently , the exact value of the crossover temperature , @xmath14 , must be suppressed by the repulsive interaction compared to the estimate  ( [ eq : mini ] ) from the free fermion theory .      in light of our results",
    ", we comment on the analysis based on the integrability of the nl@xmath18 model , as proposed in ref .  .",
    "they conclude that the spin - wave velocity monotonically increases with the increasing magnetic field , which is contradictory with the results in the present paper .",
    "the reason for this discrepancy is that they introduced the finite magnetic field after taking the low - energy limit of the zero - field model , which generally does not give a correct effective theory above the critical field . to illustrate this point , for a moment ,",
    "let us consider the @xmath0 heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain as a simple example .",
    "the zero - field effective theory in the low - energy limit is given by the tl liquid , namely the free boson field theory with the lagrangian density , @xmath129 , where @xmath105 must be periodic , @xmath130 ; r is the compactification radius  @xcite .",
    "the application of the magnetic field after taking the the low - energy limit can be represented by the term , @xmath131 this formula appears to be easily handled by `` completing the square '' as @xmath132 , where @xmath133 .",
    "apparently , there is no renormalization of the spin - wave velocity nor of @xmath134 , which is in clear contradiction to the exact bethe ansatz solution  @xcite .",
    "such fallacy is attributed to taking the low - energy limit first at zero - field , as discussed above .",
    "thus one should note that although the irrelevant perturbations on the fixed point theory @xmath135 can be usually ignored in the low - energy limit , it can not be in deriving the effective theory at a finite field .",
    "the magnetization minimum has been often discussed in terms of bec . although the three - dimensional bec observed in ref .",
    "gives similar @xmath100 curves to fig .",
    "[ fig : magh ] , it differs from the present case in several points ; the magnetization shows a singular cusp of minimum at the transition temperature , @xmath136 , ( which is however smeared in a actual systems  @xcite ) , whereas @xmath137 in our model just marks the crossover .",

    "we found the characteristic temperature dependence of magnetization of the @xmath1 haldane chain in the gapless regime at finite magnetic field , @xmath139 . in the vicinity of the endpoints of the gapless regime , @xmath44 and @xmath86",

    "therefore , @xmath141 at around @xmath142(@xmath143 ) undergoes a change from the decreasing function to the increasing function of @xmath12 as the magnetic field increases from @xmath77 to @xmath27 .",
    "we emphasize that the present discussions are universal ( at least ) for axial symmetric generic gapped one - dimensional spin systems , provided that the field - induced gapless phase can be described by a single - component tl liquid .",
    "the detailed structure of @xmath61 and @xmath70 reflecting the characteristics of each system does not violate this scheme since we have dealt with only the universal features in the low - energy limit .",
