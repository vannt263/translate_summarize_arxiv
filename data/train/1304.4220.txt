    "a solvent near its bulk critical point induces long - ranged forces between immersed mesoscopic particles which are `` universal '' , i.e. , independent of most microscopic details of the system  @xcite .",
    "apart from a few bulk properties of the solvent and from its local interactions with the surfaces of the immersed particles , these forces depend only on the _ geometry of the confinement _ of the critical fluctuations of the solvent imposed by the particle surfaces , that is on the sizes , shapes , positions , and orientations of the particles .",
    "such forces have been observed experimentally in film geometry for @xmath1he  @xcite and @xmath2he/@xmath3he mixtures  @xcite near the superfluid transition as well as for classical binary liquid mixtures near their demixing transition  @xcite and , directly , between a single spherical particle immersed in a binary liquid mixture near the critical demixing point and its confining planar wall  @xcite . due to the similarity of these forces with the casimir forces arising in quantum electrodynamics  @xcite they are called critical casimir forces .",
    "_ nonspherical _ particles near other confinements , such as a planar wall , experience orientation dependent forces giving rise to critical casimir _ torques _  @xcite .    in the following we concentrate on critical solvents belonging to the ising universality class such as demixing classical binary liquid mixtures . in these systems",
    "the particle surfaces generically prefer one of the two components of the mixture , i.e. , in ising language one of the two directions ( @xmath4 or @xmath5 ) of the order parameter is preferred .",
    "this preference is captured in terms of surface fields the strength of which under renormalization group flow attains @xmath6 , corresponding to fixed surface spins and denoted by @xmath7 boundary conditions . however , using suitable surface preparation one can suppress this preference , being left with a weakened tendency to demix near the particle surface  @xcite .",
    "these two types of surface universality classes  @xcite are called `` normal '' ( @xmath8 ) and `` ordinary '' ( o ) , respectively .",
    "simple universal behavior arises in the scaling region where the ranges of the interactions between the ordering degrees of freedom other than short - ranged ones and the lengths characterizing corrections to scaling and the crossover from less stable bulk and surface universality classes , respectively , are much smaller than the increasing correlation length of the bulk solvent upon approaching criticality , than the distances between the particles , and than the lengths characterizing the sizes and shapes of the particles . in this region of a clear separation of `` microscopic '' and `` mesoscopic '' lengths ,",
    "the forces and torques are given by universal scaling functions which , apart from the surface universality classes , only depend on ratios of the characteristic mesoscopic lengths .    here ,",
    "our main interest is in the orientation dependent interaction of nonspherical particles with boundaries of critical systems . for the interaction between a prolate uniaxial ellipsoid and a planar wall with @xmath9 or @xmath10 boundary conditions at the corresponding surfaces the complete universal scaling functions for the critical casimir forces , both for the disordered and ordered bulk phases ,",
    "have been obtained within mean field theory  @xcite . beyond mean field theory such scaling functions",
    "have been determined to a lesser degree of completeness .",
    "for _ nearby _ particles , i.e. , for closest surface to surface distances much smaller than their size and radii of curvature , the interaction can be expressed in terms of the casimir force in film geometry by using the derjaguin approximation .",
    "the scaling function of the latter is available for @xmath9 and @xmath10 surfaces in three  @xcite and two  @xcite spatial dimensions  @xcite . for",
    "a _ small _ spherical @xcite or nonspherical @xcite particle , with a size much smaller than the bulk correlation length and the distances to the surfaces of other particles or to boundaries , the interactions can be obtained from the so - called `` small particle expansion ''  @xcite .",
    "this is one of the field theoretic operator expansions for small objects the most well known of which is the product of two nearby operators first considered around 1970 by wilson , polyakov , and kadanoff  @xcite .",
    "these expansions are to a certain extent reminiscent of the multipole expansion in electrostatics .    in view of the twofold asymptotic condition ,",
    "i.e. , the particle being _ small _ on mesoscopic scales and _ large _ on the microscopic scale @xcite , it is a nontrivial issue under which circumstances the results of the `` small particle expansion '' can be observed for a given actual system . as a first step to address this issue , here we investigate whether the results of the expansion can be observed in the two - dimensional ising model on a square lattice with ( ferromagnetic ) couplings @xmath11 between nearest neighbor spins only and right at the bulk critical point .    in our monte carlo simulations",
    "we consider a lattice of finite size with the form of a strip ( or rectangle ) comprising @xmath12 rows and @xmath13 columns with an embedded particle resembling a needle .",
    "the directions along the rows and columns define , respectively , the directions @xmath14 and @xmath15 parallel and perpendicular to the strip of length @xcite @xmath13 and width @xmath12 . while in the @xmath14 direction we impose periodic boundary conditions by means of couplings @xmath16 between the first and last spin in each row , we couple all of the spins in the lowest and uppermost row by means of interactions 0 or @xmath17 to spins which are _ fixed _ in the @xmath4 direction and are located in outside neighboring rows ( see fig .",
    "[ fig_i_1 ] ) .",
    "thus in the @xmath15 direction , the strip is bounded by free surfaces or surfaces to which a magnetic field @xmath18 is applied , i.e. , by surfaces of `` ordinary '' ( @xmath19 ) or `` normal '' ( @xmath8 ) character .    ,",
    "embedded in a strip of a ferromagnetic ising model on a square lattice comprising @xmath12 rows and @xmath13 columns  @xcite of fluctuating spins ( empty circles ) and periodic boundary condition in the @xmath14 direction parallel to the rows .",
    "the two additional rows of spins fixed in the @xmath4 direction ( full circles ) allow one to induce positive or negative magnetic fields at the surfaces of the strip by coupling them in a ferro- or antiferromagnetic way to the bottom and top rows of fluctuating spins ( see the main text ) .",

    "this allows us to `` turn '' the needles abruptly about their center by 90 degrees upon rearranging the broken bonds and fixed spins , leading to broken bonds between neighboring columns and fixed spins within a single column of the lattice , respectively . in order to be able to position the centers of @xmath19 and @xmath8 needles right at the midline of the strip ( as shown in fig .",
