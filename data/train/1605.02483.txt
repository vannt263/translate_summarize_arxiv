    "the cosmic curvature is a fundamental parameter for cosmology . whether the space of our universe is open , flat , or closed is important for us to understand the evolution of our universe , and dark energy equation of state @xcite . due to the strong degeneracy between the curvature and the dark energy equation of state",
    ", it is difficult to study a non - flat @xmath4cdm model @xcite . besides , a significant detection of a non - zero curvature will affect the fundamental theory of cosmology because most observations support a flat @xmath5cdm model , including the latest planck result which gives @xmath6 @xcite . however , most of these constraints are not in a direct geometric way .",
    "therefore , determining the cosmic curvature with model - independent methods is very important .    in order to constrain the cosmic curvature in a direct geometric way",
    ", some definitions of cosmological distance should be introduced .",
    "several distance definitions , such as the proper distance @xmath7 , luminosity distance @xmath8 , angular diameter distance @xmath1 and transverse comoving distance @xmath9 are defined to investigate cosmology @xcite . under the assumption of friedmann - lematre - robertson - walker metric",
    ", the proper distance can be expressed as @xmath10 with @xmath11 , @xmath12 , or @xmath13 for curvature @xmath14 , @xmath15 , or @xmath16 , @xmath17 is the present scale factor , and @xmath12 is the comoving coordinate of the source . with the definition of hubble parameter @xmath18 , it can also be expressed as @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the redshift , @xmath21 is the hubble constant , @xmath22 is the speed of light and @xmath23 .",
    "similarly , the transverse comoving distance can be expressed as @xmath24,\\ ] ] where @xmath2 is the energy density of cosmic curvature ( @xmath25 if @xmath26 ) . with the definition of @xmath9 , @xmath8 and @xmath1",
    "can be derived through @xmath27 and @xmath28 , respectively .",
    "numerous works have been done to determine the curvature parameter @xmath2 using different methods , some of which are model - independent .",
    "@xcite proposed a model - independent method using the weak lensing and baryon acoustic oscillation ( bao ) data to constrain @xmath2 based on the distance sum rule , which was used to test the flrw metric in @xcite ( hereafter , called dsr method ) .",
    "the basic principle of dsr method is that the relation between @xmath29 and @xmath30 depends on the cosmic geometry ( see fig . 1 of @xcite ) .",
    "the value of @xmath31 can be calculated from gravitational lensing .",
    "however , the large uncertainty in gravitational lens system restricts its efficiency on constraining the curvature @xcite .",
    "another important model - independent method was proposed in @xcite , by comparing the hubble parameter @xmath0 and the derivative function of transverse comoving distance @xmath9 gained from @xmath1 , which has been used in many works @xcite ( hereafter , c07 method ) .",
    "the basis of this method is that one can determine the curvature by combining measurements of the hubble parameter @xmath0 and the transverse comoving distance @xmath32 @xmath33 ^ 2-c^2}{[h_0d_m(z)]^2},\\ ] ] where @xmath34 means the derivative with respect to redshift @xmath20 .",
    "however , in this method , one needs to determine the derivative function of transverse comoving distance @xmath9 from a fitting function , which will introduce a large uncertainty .",
    "therefore , in order to avoid the drawbacks of the two methods , we propose a new direct geometric method to test the cosmic curvature . this method is based on the comparison between proper distance @xmath7 obtained from hubble parameter measurement , and transverse comoving distance @xmath9 obtained from angular diameter distance @xmath1 measurement .",
    "the structure of this paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : method_omega_k ] , we introduce our new model - independent method to test the cosmic curvature using @xmath7 and @xmath9 . in section [ sec : result ] , we give our constraint on @xmath2 using the hubble parameter and angular diameter distance measurements . in section [ sec : simulation ] , we test the validity and efficiency of our method with monte carlo simulation . in section [ sec : comparison ] , we discuss its advantages compared with other methods . finally a summary will be given in section [ sec : summary ] .",
    "comparing the definitions of proper distance @xmath7 and transverse comoving distance @xmath9 , one can find that the difference between them only caused by the curvature of universe .",
    "this gives the basis to test the cosmic curvature using the comparison of @xmath7 and @xmath9 . from equations ( [ dp2 ] ) and ( [ dm ] ) ,",
    "@xmath2 can be derived from @xmath35 equation ( [ dpdm ] ) gives the direct relation among @xmath2 , @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "once the @xmath7 and @xmath9 are determined , @xmath2 can be calculated through this equation .",
    "if the value of redshift and @xmath2 are not large , @xmath36 is less than one . from the taylor expansion , the equation ( [ dpdm ] ) can be approximated as @xmath37 from which @xmath2 can be determined directly .",
    "figure [ fig1 ] shows the key principle of our method in the @xmath38 case . in this figure ,",
    "the arc os is the proper distance between source @xmath39 and observer @xmath40 , while the transverse comoving distance between them is @xmath41 . in this case",
    ", it is obvious that the @xmath9 of an object has an up limit @xmath17 and it is less than @xmath7 .",
    "in contrast , in an open universe ( @xmath26 ) , we have @xmath42 .",
    "@xmath43 only happens in a flat universe .",
    "therefore , the cosmic curvature can be derived by comparing @xmath9 and @xmath7 . undering the assumption of @xmath44",
    ", we can obtain @xmath45 with @xmath46 .",
    "the @xmath47 means the relative difference between @xmath7 and @xmath9 .",
    "the value of @xmath48 gives the requirement on the accuracy of measurement , which means the @xmath2 can not be constrained if the observed uncertainty is much larger than @xmath48 . besides , if the total relative error of the measurement sample of @xmath9 and @xmath7 is @xmath49 , one can expect that the tightest constrain on @xmath2 will have an error about @xmath50 .",
    "in other words , equation ( [ delta ] ) gives the constraint limit of this method .    to obtain the transverse distance @xmath9",
    ", we choose the angular diameter distance @xmath1 measurement based on bao in several previous works @xcite .",
    "these data and their references are listed in table 1 .",
    "the detailed information about these data can be found in their references .",
    "the @xmath9 can be easily derived with the direct relation between them @xmath51 .",
    "the next important issue is how to measure @xmath7 . from equation ( [ dp2 ] ) , the proper distance @xmath7 only depends on the @xmath0 function .",
    "therefore , in order to derive the proper distance @xmath7 , one can construct the @xmath0 function from hubble parameter measurements .",
    "then @xmath7 can be derived from equation ( [ dp2 ] ) .",
    "there are tens of hubble parameter measurements derived from differential ages of galaxies and the radial bao in the previous literature , which are listed in table 2 . in order to make our method model - independent , gaussian process ( gp )",
    "method is used to reconstruct the @xmath0 function .",
    "gp method is a powerful tool to reconstruct a function from data directly without any assumption of the function form and is used widely in astronomy @xcite .",
    "therefore , with gp method , we do nt need any prior cosmological model .",
    "there is a good python package for gp method called gapp developed by @xcite which was used in many works @xcite .",
    "it can reconstruct the function as long as observed data was input .",
    "more detailed information about gp method and gapp can be found in @xcite .",
    "the main route of our method is that : i ) deriving the transverse comoving distance @xmath9 from angular diameter distance @xmath1 measurements ; ii ) reconstructing @xmath0 function from hubble parameter measurements using gp method ; iii ) using equation ( [ dp2 ] ) to calculate the proper distance at a certain redshift ; iv ) using equation ( [ dpdm ] ) or ( [ omega_k ] ) to determine @xmath2 at a certain redshift .",
    "several @xmath2 can be determined at different redshifts since there are several @xmath1 measurements .",
    "one can choose the average of them as the final result through @xmath52 where @xmath53 and @xmath54 are determined @xmath2 and its uncertainty at a certain redshift .",
    "the total uncertainty can be obtained from @xmath55",
    "we collect 31 hubble parameter measurements from previous literature and list them in table 2 .",
    "these hubble parameters at different redshifts are derived using differential ages of galaxies and the radial bao method . using these observed data and gp method ,",
    "the @xmath0 function can be reconstructed , which is shown as the blue curve in figure [ fig2 ] .",
    "hereafter , this @xmath0 function is called gp-@xmath0 . for comparison",
    ", we also fit the observed data based on @xmath5cdm model which is shown as the green curve in figure [ fig2 ] . hereafter , this @xmath0 function is called fit-@xmath0 .",
    "we can find that the fit-@xmath0 is well covered by the gp-@xmath0 function and its @xmath56 confidence region . with the reconstructed gp-@xmath0 function",
    ", one can use equation ( [ dp2 ] ) to derive the proper distance at a certain redshift .",
    "the derived @xmath57 functions from gp-@xmath0 and fit-@xmath0 are shown in figure [ fig3 ] .",
    "hereafter , they are called gp-@xmath57 and fit-@xmath57 respectively . comparing the gp-@xmath0 and fit-@xmath0",
    ", one can find that the derivation between them becomes smaller than that between gp-@xmath0 and fit-@xmath0 .",
    "using equation ( [ dpdm ] ) , one can derive the @xmath2 from the @xmath7 and @xmath9 at the same redshift .",
    "figure [ fig4 ] shows the result of derived @xmath2 at different redshifts .",
    "the average @xmath2 and its error bar are derived from equations ( [ ave_omega_k ] ) and ( [ ave_sigma_omega_k ] ) .",
    "the result is listed in table 3 .",
    "the average @xmath2 constrained by these six @xmath1 data is @xmath58 .",
    "there is no significant deviation from a flat universe . from bottom panel of figure",
    "[ fig2 ] , it is obvious that the high - redshift measurement gives tighter constraint on @xmath2 than the low - redshift measurement .",
    "the reason is that the @xmath59 term in equation ( [ delta ] ) is larger at high redshift , which will decrease the error of @xmath2 through @xmath50 .",
    "in order to test the validity and efficiency of our method , we perform monte carlo simulation .",
    "the route of simulation is as follows : i ) creating mock @xmath60 and @xmath61 data sets based on a prior cosmological model ; ii ) reconstructing the gp-@xmath0 function from gp method ; iii ) using gp-@xmath0 function to derive the gp-@xmath57 function through equation ( [ dp2 ] ) ; iv ) using equations ( [ dpdm ] ) and ( [ ave_omega_k ] ) to constrain @xmath2 and its average value ; v ) simulating @xmath62 times for each prior cosmological model and give the distribution of determined average @xmath2 .    for simualtion , we choose @xmath5cdm model as the prior cosmological model .",
    "the model parameters are chosen as @xmath63 , @xmath64 and @xmath65 where @xmath66 , @xmath15 and @xmath67 for different cases . in each simulation",
    ", there are 20 mock @xmath68 and @xmath61 data sets respectively .",
    "the redshifts of these mock data are chosen equally in @xmath69 space in redshift range @xmath70 .",
    "the relative uncertainty of these mock data is @xmath71 which will be realized in future observation @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig5 ] gives an example of the simulations in the @xmath72 case .",
    "the three panels show the mock hubble parameter data with gp-@xmath0 function , mock @xmath9 data with gp-@xmath57 function and the final determined @xmath2 . from this figure",
    ", we can see that gp method can reconstruct @xmath0 function well . in this case , the final derived average @xmath2 is @xmath73 .",
    "figure [ fig6 ] shows the posterior distributions of @xmath2 for three @xmath2 cases . from this figure",
    ", one can find that our method can give a reliable and tight constraint on the prior @xmath2 .",
    "the uncertainty is @xmath74 .",
    "this result means that if there are 20 @xmath1 and @xmath0 measurements with @xmath71 uncertainty , our method can give a constraint on @xmath2 at @xmath71 level . in future",
    ", there will be more accurate measurements of @xmath1 and @xmath0 , tighter constraint on @xmath2 can be expected .",
    "in this section , we compare our method with other model - independent methods . just as introduced in the first section , there are two model - independent methods to constrain the curvature of universe proposed in previous literature @xcite , which have been used in many works @xcite .",
    "the first one is dsr method based on the distance sum rule proposed by @xcite and the other is c07 method based on the equation ( [ c07 ] ) @xcite .    the basic principle of dsr method is the distance sum rule which means that if there are two sources @xmath75 and @xmath76 at redshift @xmath77 and @xmath78 ( assuming @xmath79 ) , it has @xmath80 if our universe is flat .",
    "otherwise , @xmath81 or @xmath82 for @xmath26 or @xmath38 respectively .",
    "the distance between @xmath75 and @xmath76 can be determined by gravitational lens @xcite .",
    "compared the figure 1 of @xcite with our figure 1 , it can be found that the difference between @xmath7 and @xmath9 is larger than that between @xmath83 and @xmath84 , which means our method is more sensitive on the cosmic curvature .",
    "an accurate calculation gives the relative difference between @xmath83 and @xmath84 is @xmath85 where @xmath86 is only valid when the source @xmath75 locates at the middle of @xmath76 and observer .",
    "compared with equation ( [ delta ] ) , one can find that dsr method needs a higher accuracy of measurement than our method . besides , the systematic uncertainty of gravitation lens system parameter @xmath87 is about @xmath88 @xcite , where @xmath89 is a phenomenological coefficient that parameterizes uncertainty due to difference between the velocity dispersion of the observed stars and the underlying dark matter , and other systematic effects in strong lensing .",
    "this systematic uncertainty is hardly to remove , which restricts its efficiency on constraining the cosmic curvature .    for the c07 method",
    ", it is based on equation ( [ c07 ] ) , which needs the first derivative function of @xmath32 fitted from observational data . as is known to all",
    "that calculating the derivative function from a fitted function will increase the uncertainty significantly especially when the function form is unknown and the data is not enough . in order to check the efficiency of c07 method",
    ", we also use monte carlo simulation to test it , and the simulation is same as introduced in section [ sec : simulation ] . figure [ fig7 ] gives an example of the simulations in the @xmath72 case , which is similar with figure [ fig5 ] . instead of @xmath0 and @xmath57 functions ,",
    "we show the @xmath90 function in the top panel of figure [ fig7 ] . because the @xmath0 and @xmath57 functions are similar with those in figure [ fig5 ] . from figure",
