    "quantum computers offer the potential to solve certain classes of problems that appear to be practically unsolvable with classical computers .",
    "for example , they allow for efficient prime factorization @xcite , and for the efficient simulation of quantum systems @xcite . however , quantum computers are particularly subject to the deleterious effects of noise and decoherence .",
    "in fact , the speed - up provided by quantum computers relies on the possibility to create and manipulate coherent superpositions of quantum states , which however are extremely sensitive to the coupling with external degrees of freedom .",
    "therefore the protection from noise and errors is of fundamental importance for the realization of any quantum computer . at first sight",
    ", quantum error - correction seems to be precluded by the no cloning theorem @xcite which seems to rule out redundancy as usually employed in error correction . the discovery of quantum error - correction codes ( qecc ) @xcite that allow for fault tolerant quantum computing @xcite has therefore made the realization of practical quantum computers viable .",
    "the literature on the theory of qecc is vast and it now covers a wide range of approaches ( see for examples the recent reviews of refs .",
    "instead experimental realizations have been limited to the field of liquid - state nuclear magnetic resonance ( nmr ) @xcite , and to trapped ions @xcite .",
    "nmr experiments showed an increase in state fidelity after performing the unitary operations of an error correction protocol .",
    "however these first nmr demonstration have two drawbacks : i ) nmr techniques can not be scaled up with the number of qubits @xcite ; ii ) the ancillary qubits can not be reset in these experiments , making therefore impossible in principle to repeat the protocol with the same qubits as many times as required by a particular quantum algorithm . the trapped - ion implementation of a three - qubit qecc of ref .",
    "@xcite does not have instead these limitations , but it remains a unique example . therefore studying",
    "the feasibility of the implementation of simple qecc protocols in alternative physical realizations of quantum computation is an important step for the development of the field .    in this paper",
    "we propose a scheme for the implementation of the three - qubit repetition qecc @xcite on a cavity - qed setup .",
    "we show that one can show a significant increase of the state fidelity by implementing the scheme in state - of - the - art apparatus involving rydberg atoms and microwave cavities @xcite .",
    "quantum information is encoded within circular rydberg states and two cavities are employed to perform the encoding and decoding steps by means of standard cavity - qed techniques . in sec .",
    "ii we review the main aspects of the three - qubit repetition code ; in sec .",
    "iii its specific implementation in the cavity qed setup is described . in sec .",
    "iv the main experimental features of the scheme are described , while in sec .",

    "vi is for concluding remarks .",
    "let us assume that we have two distant stations , _ alice _ and _ bob _ , interested in sharing a message .",
    "this message can be modeled by a physical system that traveling through the communication channel is affected by unknown errors of various type @xcite .",
    "the origin of these errors is the coupling of the system with the environment ( _ decoherence _ ) , and the ability in revealing and finding a way to correct them constitutes the central task of qecc .    both classical and quantum error correction are based on the following three main stages : i ) the _ encoding _ , during which the original information is registered in a redundant way involving additional resources ( the _ ancillas _ ) ; ii ) the _ decoding _ , in which the encoding process is reversed in order to distinguish which kind of error has taken place ; iii ) the _ correction _ of the error for recovering the initial information . in the quantum case ,",
    "the simplest way to encode information is to use a qubit and consider a generic state @xmath0 + with @xmath1 .",
    "a simple and effective way of describing the degrading effect of the environment is by means of a collection of operators @xmath2 , acting on the qubit states @xmath3 , each associated with an environmental state @xmath4 . for each @xmath5 ,",
    "the pair @xmath6 describes a type of error affecting the qubit . after preparing the message",
    ", the initial state of the qubit - environment system is the factorized state @xmath7 which , after the disturbing action of the environment , becomes the entangled state @xmath8 at the receiving station bob does not have access to the environment variables and therefore the qubit state received by him is mixed and given by the trace over the environment @xmath9 + for a classical bit one can have only the flip error @xmath10 , @xmath11 ; instead the state of a qubit depends also upon the relative phase between @xmath12 and @xmath13 and therefore one has two other independent errors : the phase error @xmath14 , and also its combination with the flip error @xmath15 .",
    "these three types of errors , associated with the three pauli operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 , are all simultaneously present in a generic situation , and in order to correct for all of them the `` cheapest '' qecc requires at least four additional ancillary qubits @xcite",
    ". however , in many practical situations , an error type is much more relevant than the others and one can adopt the simpler _ three - qubit _ qecc which is designed for correcting a single type of error @xcite .",
    "the three - qubit repetition code is the quantum extension of the repetition code @xcite , in which redundancy is obtained by circumventing the limitations imposed by the _ no - cloning theorem _ by means of entanglement , i.e. , by encoding the information of the initial qubit state of eq .",
    "( [ eq : qubit ] ) into the entangled state @xmath19 where , @xmath20 with @xmath21 and @xmath22 denote the two ancillary qubits .",
    "the encoding process is performed by an entangling unitary operation @xmath23 and after that the encoded state is affected by noise and errors introduced by the interaction with the environment .",
    "the decoding stage is then implemented by simply applying the inverse of the encoding operation , @xmath24 , in order to determine which of the three qubits has been affected by the error . in fact , qecc theory assumes that the probability of having more than one error on a single qubit ( between encoding and decoding ) is negligible , i.e. , that the coupling with the environment is weak .",
    "in such a limit the error can always be detected and the initial information perfectly recovered .",
    "the final correction stage can be performed in two different ways : i ) `` automatically '' , by a further unitary operation on the three - qubit system ( a toffoli gate @xcite ) always yielding the original state of the qubit of interest ; ii ) by explicitly measuring the ancillas for detecting the error and eventually applying a feedback operation on the qubit for restoring the desired state .",
    "the first option is deterministic and therefore usually preferable , but the second option is also viable when highly efficient single qubit measurements are available and the implementation of three - qubit gates such as the toffoli gate is too difficult ( or too slow ) .",
    "this latter scenario applies to the cavity - qed setup studied here , and therefore we shall consider from now on the `` measurement and feedback '' scheme for the implementation of the final correction stage .",
    "many cavity - qed setups have now achieved the ability to perform entanglement and disentanglement operation with an high degree of accuracy @xcite . here",
    "we shall focus in cavity - qed setup in the microwave regime @xcite which employs circular rydberg atoms which represent a formidable tool for encoding quantum information due to their very long decay time ( of the order of 30 ms ) .    )",
    "i.e. , low - q microwave cavities , and two high - q microwave cavities ( @xmath25 ) . assuming that the length of the whole apparatus is @xmath26 cm , and that the atoms travel at @xmath27 m / s , the resulting total duration time of the protocol involving the four rydberg atoms is @xmath28 ms . ]    in order to implement the three - qubit qecc ( see fig .  [ fig1 ] ) one needs two spatially separated high - q microwave cavities , @xmath29 and @xmath30 , in which the encoding and decoding process will be implemented , and four atoms @xmath31 , crossing both cavities and interacting sequentially with the each cavity mode .",
    "the relevant atomic levels are three successive circular rydberg levels with increasing energy , @xmath32 .",
    "the quantum information we want to protect is encoded in the first atom @xmath33 , while the second ( @xmath34 ) and the third atom ( @xmath35 ) are the ancillas , having the role of revealing the syndrome .",
    "finally the fourth atom @xmath36 is the atom on which the information , originally encoded in the the quantum state of @xmath33 , will be restored .",
    "together with the two high - q cavities , the scheme requires also three `` ramsey '' zones ( @xmath37 for @xmath38 in fig .",
    "1 ) sandwiching the high - q cavities , where classical microwave pulses can be applied for the manipulation of the atomic states .",
    "finally one has a field - ionization atomic state detector @xcite which detects the error syndrome and activate the feedback correction loop .",
    "the cavities are assumed to be in the vacuum state at the beginning of the process ; we also assume that the three circular rydberg states can be prepared with high probability of success through the circularization process described in @xcite .",
    "the qecc scheme proceeds through four steps which are now described .",
    "+ _ first step : qubit state preparation .",
    "_ the first atom @xmath33 is prepared in level @xmath39 and then enters cavity @xmath29 , which is initially in the vacuum state .",

    "we consider perfect atom - cavity resonance , @xmath43 , so that the time evolved atom - cavity state is given by @xmath44 + the atom - cavity interaction time @xmath45 can be also adjusted by using again stark - shift tuning : in fact , the interaction can be stopped by shifting the @xmath46 transition far - off resonance . in this way",
    "one can prepare an effective generic qubit state , encoded within the joint @xmath33-@xmath29 system , @xmath47 + with @xmath48 .",
    "+ _ second step : the encoding stage_. we entangle the principal qubit with two atomic ancillas in order to obtain a state of the form given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : cqecc - enc ] ) .",
    "the two atomic ancillas @xmath49 , are first prepared in the circular state @xmath50 . in the first ramsey zone",
    "@xmath51 they undergo a @xmath52-pulse driving each ancilla to the superposition state @xmath53 + the two ancillas are entangled with the prepared qubit state when crossing @xmath29 .",
    "the stark shift field is set so that the @xmath54 transition of both ancillas is resonant with the cavity mode .",
    "they both experience a @xmath55 resonant cycle , so to realize a controlled phase accumulation on the atomic state @xmath56 resulting in @xmath57 + when both the ancillas have crossed @xmath29 , the final atoms - cavity state will be @xmath58 + where @xmath59 , with @xmath60 .",
    "+ _ third step : the noisy channel_. the three encoded atoms travel from alice to bob through the noisy channel , modeled by a second ramsey zone , @xmath61 , where a random field is applied ( for the details see section [ sec : channel ] ) .",

    "the decoding process takes place in the second cavity @xmath30 which disentangles the three atoms .",
    "let us first consider the case where there has been no error .",
    "atom @xmath33 interacts resonantly with a @xmath63-pulse with the cavity @xmath30 : the only part of the state that evolves is @xmath64 , disentangling the first atom @xmath33 from the rest , i.e. ,    @xmath65{| g_{\\mathcal{a}_{1}}\\rangle}.\\ ] ]     + this transformation transfers the encoded qubit from the cavity - atom @xmath66 given by the relation ( [ eq : state_a1-c1 ] ) to the encoded qubit that involves the two cavities @xmath67 .",
    "then the two ancillas @xmath62 pass through the second cavity , where they experience the same transformation they already experienced in @xmath29 , i.e. , a @xmath55-pulse resonant cycle .",
    "as a consequence , the two ancillas are decoupled from the encoded @xmath67 state as it must be for a decoding process , and the resulting state is an entangled state of the two cavities only , @xmath68{| -_{\\mathcal{a}_{2}},-_{\\mathcal{a}_{3}}\\rangle}.\\ ] ] + finally there is the final ( eventual ) correction stage : the ancillas are measured , and if an error is revealed the correction procedure is applied . in this step",
    "the fourth atom @xmath36 starts to play its role : it has the function to reload the information now encoded in the @xmath67 entangled state and record the stored information in the atomic state .",
    "the need for this fourth atom is in fact evident , because the only information that can be efficiently read - out by the detector is that recorded in the atomic state .",
    "atom @xmath36 is prepared in the circular state @xmath69 and through stark - shift tuning it is set far - off resonance from @xmath29 so that it crosses it without interaction .",
    "therefore it arrives in the same state @xmath69 at @xmath30 , where it undergoes a resonant @xmath63-pulse interaction identical to that of atom @xmath33 . as a consequence ,",
    "the state of the system becomes @xmath70{| -_{\\mathcal{a}_{2}},-_{\\mathcal{a}_{3}},0_{\\mathcal{c}_{2}}\\rangle}.\\ ] ] + the detection of the ancillary atoms provides the error syndrome : the two states @xmath71 signals that the three qubits have not been affected by any error and therefore there is no correction to perform on the final qubit , atom @xmath36 . actually , the states of eqs .",
    "( [ eq : enc - state ] ) and ( [ eq : g4-c2 ] ) are not identical .",
    "although the amplitude probabilities are exactly the same , they differ by a relative phase @xmath63 .",
    "this is a consequence of the sequence of pulses realizing the entangling and disentangling operations , but there is a simple way to correct this problem , since it is sufficient to apply a classical @xmath55-pulse resonant with the @xmath72 transition in the @xmath73 zone .",
    "this will change the phase of the @xmath74 component of atom @xmath36 only , permitting to obtain a perfect matching of the final and of the initially encoded state .",

    "as in the previous case , the only thing we have to do is to apply a classical pulse in @xmath73 to correct the @xmath76 relative phase .      if instead an error occurs on @xmath33 in @xmath61 , the effect will be the exchange between @xmath77 .",
    "the state after the first atom has interacted with @xmath30 now becomes @xmath78 + and after the passage of @xmath36 we have @xmath79{| + _ { \\mathcal{a}_{2}},+_{\\mathcal{a}_{3}}\\rangle}.\\ ] ] + in this case we have to apply the error correction , that consists of a feedback @xmath63 pulse in the first portion of the ramsey zone @xmath73 , flipping the state of @xmath36 @xmath80 , followed by an off - resonant @xmath55 pulse , on the second portion of @xmath73 , changing the phase of the @xmath81 .",
    "the two pulses can be both performed within @xmath73 by using strong enough pulses .",
    "we finally obtain the following state ( see eq.([eq : enc - state ] ) ) after the measurement of the two ancillas , @xmath82 + that is exactly the initial atom - cavity state provided @xmath33 and @xmath36 are swapped .",
    "the original encoded state is therefore restored and quantum information has been safely transferred from alice to bob .",
    "the cavity scheme assumed in the previous section fits well with the microwave - cavity setup at ecole normale superiure in paris described , e.g. , in @xcite .",
    "let us now see in detail the properties of this setup and we show that the proposed qecc scheme can be implemented using a state - of - the - art apparatus , even when taking into account the experimental limitations due to spontaneous emission and the finite decay time of the cavities .      adopting atoms with long decay time and right velocities is of crucial importance for the realization of the protocol .",
    "circular rydberg states @xcite are excellent candidates because they correspond to large principal quantum number @xmath83 and maximum angular momentum @xmath84 .",
    "the three level cascade structure can be found choosing atomic levels with principal quantum number @xmath85 for @xmath86 respectively @xcite .",
    "the long radiative lifetime permits to have negligible effects on the atomic coherence from spontaneous emission , and the large dipole moment matrix elements , of the order of @xmath87 a.u for the @xmath88 transition , permits to have strong atom - field coupling .",

    "a quick modification of the resonance conditions is possible by modulating the electric tension at the end of the two mirrors , resulting in a rapid change of electric field inside the cavity .",
    "this induces a quadratic stark - shift of the atomic levels , that for rydberg atoms is particularly strong @xcite . in this way",

    "we have proposed a scheme for the implementation of the three - qubit qecc using a cavity qed setup . in particular",
    "we have considered a state - of - the - art apparatus in which the quantum information to protect is encoded in the state of circular rydberg atoms crossing two high - quality microwave cavities .",
    "the encoding and decoding steps of the three - qubit qecc are performed within the cavities exploiting a resonant atom - cavity interaction and the possibility to manipulate this interaction by stark shifting the atomic levels .",
    "the error syndrome and the eventual correction is performed by explicitly detecting the atomic state and via a controlled @xmath63-pulse operation . by considering the same parameter regime of the recent experiment of ref .",
    "@xcite we have shown that qecc significantly preserves the prepared atomic state against the noise due to fluctuating electric fields which randomly shift the atomic energy levels via quadratic stark effect .",
    "our analysis has taken into account all the major experimental limitations , i.e. , cavity decay and spontaneous emission , and we have seen that the performance of the qecc is not too much affected by them , as long as the decay times are much longer than the typical atom - cavity interaction times . instead , we did not take into account the non - unit efficiency of atomic detectors .",
    "in fact , as long as the detection efficiency does not depend on the atomic state , the fact the probability of missing an atom is nonzero does not affect the efficiency of the protocol , but only decreases the rate of significative events in performing the experiment .",
    "the present scheme can be extended for implementing more involved quantum error - correction codes , e.g. the five- or seven - qubit code , paying only the price of a slightly more involved sequence of operations .",
    "in fact , the main limitation for scaling - up the scheme to more qubits is represented by the spontaneous emission of the circular rydberg states , which is of the order of 30 ms and limits the number of atoms that can be prepared and manipulated .",
    "cavity decay time is less important because the cavity modes are used only for much shorter time for carrying out the operations .",
    "assuming an atomic velocity around @xmath27 m / s ( as used in our simulations ) the time duration of the while protocol is around @xmath28 ms and therefore there is enough time for scaling up to at least ten qubits . in order to scale - up to a realistic and useful quantum processor",
    "the present cavity - qed setup is less suitable .",
    "in fact , one should avoid spontaneous emission by encoding quantum information in hyperfine - split ground - state sublevels and by employing optical raman transitions between these levels .",
    "replacing microwave cavities and transitions with optical ones has also the advantage of avoiding cryogenic setups .",
    "for example , scalable cavity - qed configurations of this kind could be provided by coupled cavity arrays @xcite .",
