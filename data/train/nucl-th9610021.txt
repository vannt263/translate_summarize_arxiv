    "the @xmath1 model of the nucleus  @xcite is a relativistic quantum field theory which describes the nuclear interaction using three fields . they are neutral scalar meson , neutral vector meson and baryon fields .",
    "the scalar meson field couples to the scalar density , @xmath2 , while the vector meson field couples to the conserved baryon current , @xmath3 . in the relativistic mean - field approximation ( rmft )",
    "where the sources are large , the meson fields can be replaced by classical fields and the linearized dirac equation solved exactly . this model has had several successes , properly describing : bulk properties of nuclear matter , ground state properties of nuclei , the excitation spectrum of nuclei , low energy nucleon - nucleus scattering observables , as well as collective motion .",
    "all except the first of the preceding list incorporate spatial dependence for the meson fields and their sources .",
    "the last item , collective motion , incorporates a slow time dependence in addition to the spatial dependence .",
    "it is here proposed to use this model to calculate vector meson production during relativistic heavy - ion collisions like those to be seen at rhic .",
    "all of the above successes of the @xmath1 model have been for low and intermediate energy phenomena .",
    "therefore , some justification is necessary for use of this model in a radically different physical situation .",
    "first , using ground state wave - functions calculated from this model and empirical nucleon - nucleon scattering amplitudes one can obtain excellent agreement with experimental nucleon - nucleus scattering observables in the relativistic impulse approximation up to energies of the order 1 gev  @xcite ; second , the longitudinal response for @xmath4fe(@xmath5,@xmath6 ) at momentum transfer of @xmath7 gev has been calculated by frank  @xcite in this model and agrees well with data ; in addition , the @xmath1 model taken in rmft has been employed to describe the nuclear equation of state up to the quark - gluon phase transition  @xcite .",
    "furthermore , the presence of many quanta of the meson fields here serves to validate the classical approximation .",
    "it is not clear what the appropriate degrees of freedom actually are for the rhic - like collisions .",
    "although the ( @xmath8 ) model deals with hadrons , these results will turn out to be more general .",
    "we consider a process whereby two conserved baryon currents pass through each other , are slowed , and thus radiate energy via bremsstrahlung in the form of vector mesons . in the end ,",
    "the only requirements for this calculation are an empirical knowledge of the initial and final rapidities of the baryon currents , conservation of these currents , and a vector meson that couples to the conserved baryon currents . in the final analysis , it is irrelevant whether the baryon current is carried by nucleons or quarks during the collision , as long as the vector meson couples to the baryon current .    it should be noted that in the work of mishustin _ et .",
    "@xcite , where the @xmath1 model is employed to calculate baryon ",
    "anti - baryon production via virtual vector meson bremsstrahlung under rhic conditions , it is suggested that real @xmath9-mesons should be produced via bremsstrahlung and that this process should be relatively soft .- meson can be generated in the bremsstrahlung process when the four - momenta of quanta satisfy the mass shell constraint @xmath10 . ...",
    "these channels are characterized by lower threshold and , therefore , by smaller momentum transfers .",
    "since the corresponding coupling constants are also large , one can expect high multiplicities of mesons coherently produced in ultra - relativistic nuclear collisions . '' ]    in this work only central collisions of identical heavy nuclei are considered .",
    "therefore , the lab and equal - velocity frames are equivalent . in ref .",
    "@xcite hanson shows evidence that for central high - energy collisions ( rapidity larger than 3 ) , the nuclei are expected to be slowed by the collision , but not completely stopped .",
    "this slowing occurs over the short time of the collision .",
    "this gives rise to a large deceleration . in this model ,",
    "the decelerating sources radiate the classical meson fields .",
    "this is the same process as classical electromagnetic bremsstrahlung for an accelerated charge .",
    "due to lorentz contraction , the scalar meson radiation is greatly suppressed relative to the vector meson radiation .",
    "most of the vector meson radiation is in the form of high energy mesons whose mass is therefore neglected .",
    "an attenuation factor is included to account for the strong interaction between the vector mesons and the baryons .",
    "the attenuation factor is constructed in a lorentz invariant manner to maintain the covariance of the theory .",
    "this model contains three adjustable parameters : the deceleration time , the rapidity loss and the total cross section for the vector meson - nucleon interaction .",
    "the angular distribution of energy flux is characteristic , varying only in magnitude for variations in the cross section and deceleration time .",
    "variations in rapidity loss affect both the magnitude and width of the angular distribution ; however , the general shape is robust for parameter variations .",
    "this work indicates that the bremsstrahlung of vector mesons could contribute significantly to the total radiated energy during relativistic heavy - ion collisions .",
    "the model used here is very simple ; it depends only on the vector mesons coupling to a conserved baryon current .",
    "the fact that this model predicts an appreciable amount of radiation with a characteristic angular distribution that is robust against parameter variation suggests that it is deserving of further investigation .",
    "this radiation of mesons during relativistic heavy - ion collisions has been considered before .",
    "@xcite examined the dynamics of relativistic heavy - ion collisions using the ( @xmath8 ) model in mean field theory .",
    "they modeled the collisions within the relativistic boltzmann - uehling - uhlenbeck model using full solutions to the meson - field equations . at the energies they studied (",
    "1 - 20  gev / a ) , they found meson radiation to be negligible ( @xmath11 3 mev / nucleon ) .",
    "however , the amount of energy radiated increases as the acceleration squared , so their work does not rule out appreciable radiation at higher energies .",
    "the production of pions and photons via bremsstrahlung was investigated in refs .",
    "ivanov  @xcite calculated @xmath9-meson radiation due to filamentation instability .",
    "the behavior of the meson fields during relativistic heavy - ion collisions was explored in refs .",
    "@xcite ; however , these are at much lower bombarding energies and did not directly look at meson radiation .",
    "it is expected that at the energies available at rhic these central collisions will produce a quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the question then arises , what effect will the creation of the plasma have on this model that uses baryons and mesons ?",
    "indeed , would any sign of this hadronic process survive under these conditions ? it has been suggested that as individual quarks interact during the collision , color strings or flux tubes will form  @xcite .",
    "these flux tubes are stretched out behind the nuclei as they pass through each other ( see , for example , figure 4 of ref .",
    "the breaking of these flux tubes then provides an important contribution to the formation of the quark - gluon plasma .",
    "the meson production described in the present work comes exclusively from the forward going baryons that constitute the initial colliding nuclei .",
    "even if the mesons must pass through part of the baryon - rich quark - gluon plasma , there is theoretical evidence that meson - like modes can propagate through a quark - gluon plasma  @xcite .",
    "such a physical situation may alter the attenuation but could still leave a detectable sign of this mechanism .    this paper attempts to test the limits of the @xmath1 model in rmft for a strong time - dependence .",

    "the scalar density is invariant ; however , the vector density is enhanced by a factor of @xmath21 , defined as @xmath22 with @xmath23 the velocity . for the dynamics of the collisions investigated in this paper , this factor varies between 10 and 100 .",
    "the radiated energy is proportional to the field squared ; therefore , the vector meson radiation is at least a factor of 100 greater than the scalar meson radiation .",
    "consequently , _ the scalar field can be neglected_.    the energy - momentum tensor is , @xmath24 this form of the energy - momentum tensor works well for calculating the total energy and momentum of the system .",
    "however , it contains total divergences that will give incorrect results for the energy flux .",

    "the equation of motion for the vector meson field is @xmath34 since the baryon current is conserved , this reduces to @xmath35 .",

    "@xmath49 is the first order bessel function and @xmath50 is the heavyside step function defined as @xmath51 .",
    "if the baryon current is replaced by the electromagnetic current , the coupling constant changed to the fine structure constant , @xmath52 , and the mass , @xmath18 , goes to zero , this reduces to electromagnetic bremsstrahlung .",
    "note that as @xmath53 the second term in equation  ( [ green ] ) vanishes .",
    "it is argued in section  [ sec : massless ] that neglecting the mass of the vector meson does not alter the results appreciably , and we will take @xmath54 for the rest of this work .",
    "the above solution for @xmath55 and equation  ( [ en - mom ] ) gives a distribution of energy as a function of outgoing energy , @xmath56 , and angle of , ( compare equation ( 14.70 ) of ref .",

    "the radiation is strongly peaked in the direction of the baryon cluster s motion .",
    "thus , we concentrate now on just one of the incident nuclei . assuming the current is that of a collection of point baryons traveling with identical velocity , @xmath58 we may do the spatial integration .",
    "the baryon s position is given as @xmath59 where @xmath60 is the position of the center - of - mass and @xmath61 is the baryon s position relative to the center - of - mass .",
    "the relative position of the baryon will vary with time , for example , due to changing lorentz contraction and the empirically seen spreading of final rapidity ; however , in this simple model this motion will be neglected relative to the much more important center - of - mass motion .",
    "the baryons will this be considered as `` frozen '' relative to the baryon clusters as they pass through each other and decelerate .",
    "the baryon s position thus becomes , @xmath62 separating out the dependence on @xmath63 we may write , @xmath64 \\ , \\e^{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{i}}}\\varepsilon      ( t - \\vec{n } \\cdot \\vec{x}(t ) ) } \\ ; \\sum_j \\e^{-{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{i}}}\\varepsilon      \\vec{n } \\cdot \\vec{r}_j } \\right|^{2}.\\ ] ] taking the sum outside the square gives a coherence factor @xmath65 one must now take a statistical average over the positions of the baryons in the incident nucleus ; this average is weighted by the square of the ground state wave - function .",
    "if the exponent is large , as argued in section  [ sec : incoherence ] , the off - diagonal elements average to zero and the coherence factor is approximately @xmath66 , the number of baryons .",
    "we now wish to find the angular distribution of energy flux and the total energy radiated .",

    "the integration should be over positive energies ; however , the integrand is even in @xmath56 so we take @xmath70 the integral over all energies .",
    "the angular distribution of energy flux is @xmath71 \\right|^2 } { ( 1- \\vec{n } \\cdot    \\vec{\\beta}(t))^5}.\\ ] ] the angular integration can also be done and this gives @xmath72 note that the last two results are just the single particle result ( see equations ( 14.38 ) and ( 14.43 ) of ref .",
    "@xcite ) times the coherence factor , @xmath73 .",
    "the only quantity required to evaluate equation ( [ freq ] ) is the baryon current , @xmath74 . in the present covariant approach , this is related to the particles velocity , @xmath75 , in the lab frame by @xmath76 where 1 and 2 are the two nuclei , @xmath77 is the rest - frame baryon density and @xmath78 is the four - velocity of the nucleus . the baryon current is conserved ; @xmath79 and transforms as a four - vector , @xmath80 .    the baryon density should be determined from the ground - state nuclear wave - functions , computed in the dirac - hartree approximation , summed over the occupied orbitals .",
    "this procedure is explained in detail in ref .",
    "@xcite and implemented in ref .",
    "@xcite ; however , it is argued in sections  [ sec : formal ] and [ sec : incoherence ] of this paper that the nucleons radiate incoherently and the energy flux is insensitive to the exact baryon distribution .",
    "therefore , one can approximate the true baryon density by a constant density inside the nuclear radius , @xmath81 .",
    "the motion of the baryons will be modeled as having a smooth transition from their initial speed to their final speed .",
    "a fermi - type parameterization of the speed is used  @xcite : @xmath82 where @xmath83 is the stopping parameter . call the unit vector along the beam axis @xmath84 .",
    "therefore , the first nucleus is traveling with velocity @xmath85 and the second with @xmath86 .",
    "the initial and final speeds are fixed from experimental results and the stopping parameter is allowed to vary in this model .",
    "the beam energy per nucleon is @xmath87 .",
    "the initial rapidity is related to the beam energy by @xmath88 , and the initial speed by @xmath89 .",
    "the energy lost during the collision is characterized by the rapidity loss , @xmath90 .",
    "@xcite claim a rapidity loss of @xmath91 for central au+au collisions at rhic energies of @xmath92 gev .",
    "the same value is used for this study of pb+pb at the same energy .",
    "the stopping parameter is allowed to vary between @xmath93 and @xmath94 fm .",
    "the initial speed of the nucleons for @xmath92 gev is @xmath95 .",
    "the velocity of the nucleons relative to the center - of - mass is small compared to the velocity of the center - of - mass .",
    "this means that the collision time between nuclei will be much shorter than the interaction time between nucleons in the same nucleus .",
    "the nuclei then can be treated as static collections of nucleons with uniform longitudinal motion .",
    "this is similar to the frozen approximation used in the parton model .",
    "the baryon current can be represented as a collection of point particles : @xmath96 + \\vec{\\beta}^{(2)}(t ) \\sum_{j=1}^{a }    \\delta [ \\vec{x } - \\vec{x}_{2}(t ) - \\vec{r}_{j}]\\ ] ] where the first ( second ) term represents the first ( second ) nucleus , @xmath97 is the position of the center of mass of the @xmath98 nucleus and @xmath99 is the position of the @xmath100 baryon relative to the center of mass at @xmath101 . since the lab frame coincides with the equal - velocity frame , @xmath102 .",
    "the position is the integral of the velocity with the boundary condition that the velocity asymptote to the free particle solution at @xmath103 .",
    "the exact form used is @xmath104    using this form of the current in equation  ( [ freq ] ) gives @xmath105 [ \\beta(t ' ) \\sin \\psi(t ' ) ] \\e^{{\\ensuremath{\\mathrm{i}}}\\varepsilon ( t - t ' ) } \\\\ \\nonumber & & \\ ; \\ ; \\times \\sin    [ \\varepsilon \\phi(t ) ] \\sin [ \\varepsilon \\phi(t')]\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath106 at time @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath109 is the coherence factor defined in equation  ( [ eq : p ] ) .    if in the coherence factor , @xmath110 then the phases are all near zero . if , on the other hand , then the phases are large and nearly random . in the end ,",
    "when a statistical average over all possible configurations is taken using the ground - state wave - functions , the first case leads to @xmath111 corresponding to the nucleons radiating as one large baryon of `` baryonic charge '' @xmath66 . for the latter case",
    "the coherence factor becomes @xmath73 corresponding to each nucleon radiating independent of its neighbors .",
    "since neither of these conditions hold absolutely , the coherence factor will be some power of the atomic weight , @xmath112 where . to neglect the vector meson mass",
    ", its outgoing energy must be on the order of several gev .",
    "the inter - particle distance is on the order of 1 fm .",
    "the latter condition holds and the nucleons should radiate incoherently , @xmath113 .",
    "throughout this work the vector meson field has been treated analogously to the electromagnetic field with just a change in coupling strength .",
    "however , there is one aspect where there is a significant difference .",
    "the vector mesons interact strongly with the baryons ; therefore , there will be an attenuation of vector mesons as they pass through either the nucleus from which they are radiated or the other nucleus .",
    "the attenuated energy flux can appear as radiation through another channel or could be used to heat the nuclear material . since",
    "most of the radiation will occur early during the collision [ equation  ( [ eq : angular ] ) is dominated by the denominator which increases during the collision ] and is directed in the forward direction , this attenuation is non - negligible .",
    "this reduction is accounted for by including a multiplicative factor , @xmath114 , in the radiated power , @xmath115_{\\rm ret}.\\ ] ] forms of equations ( [ eq : angular ] ) and ( [ eq : totale ] ) involving the attenuation factor follow the development in section  [ sec : formal ] .",
    "this attenuation factor is taken as , @xmath116 where @xmath117 and @xmath118 are the distances traveled through the radiating nucleus and the second nucleus respectively , @xmath119 is the vector meson - nucleon total cross - section , and @xmath120 is the baryon density . equation  ( [ atten ] ) can be evaluated in the rest frame of the radiating nucleus making @xmath117 time - independent . to maintain the covariance of the model the attenuation factor",
    "is evaluated along the axis of motion and taken to be independent of outgoing angle . since most of the radiation is in the far forward direction , this results in only a small overestimation of the attenuation .    to evaluate equation  ( [ atten ] ) , consider the radiation coming from the nucleus traveling in the positive @xmath84 direction ( the argument is identical for the other nucleus ) .",
    "move the origin for the integration to the center of mass in nucleus rest frame .",
    "the distance traveled inside this nucleus depends only on where the radiation originates ( remember , the attenuation is assumed independent of outgoing angle ) .",
    "using cylindrical coordinates @xmath121 to take advantage of the azimuthal symmetry , we find @xmath122 where @xmath123 is the nuclear radius .",
    "since the radiation must come from inside the nucleus the following condition _ always _ holds : @xmath124 .",
    "the form of the equation for the distance through the target nucleus is more involved since the nucleus is moving . defining the distance between the two centers of mass as @xmath125",
    ", the distance traveled through the moving nucleus is @xmath126 where @xmath127 is the lorentz factor for the target moving in the rest frame of the radiating nucleus .",
    "it is related to the lorentz factor in the lab frame [ equation  ( [ lorentz ] ) ] by @xmath128",
    "throughout this paper the vector meson mass has been assumed small compared to the particles outgoing energy , and hence neglected .",
    "it is the purpose of this section to justify this assumption .",
    "equation  ( [ freq2 ] ) gives the energy distribution of the radiated mesons .",
    "if the observer is assumed far away , the angle to the observer , @xmath129 , will change little over the time of interest .",
    "the @xmath130 factor may be taken outside the time integral as a constant .",

    "this slow decrease means that most of the radiation is above the vector meson mass and that the massless assumption is acceptable . cutting the spectrum off at the meson mass @xmath137 gev ,",
    "reduces the integrated spectrum by less than @xmath138 .",
    "throughout this work , only central collisions of identical nuclei at a bombarding energy achievable at rhic of @xmath139  gev  @xcite have been considered .",
    "a short discussion is still needed concerning the value of the required coupling constant , @xmath140 .",
    "there is no solid evidence to direct a choice of the coupling constant for the type of reaction that this work describes .",
    "a value that reproduces static nuclear properties has been chosen  @xcite ; @xmath141 . using a value of @xmath142 between eight and nine , gross ,",
    "van orden and holinde  @xcite were able to reproduce free nucleon - nucleon phase shifts to several hundred mev . since the @xmath1 model is not an asymptotically - free theory , the coupling constant may even increase at higher energy and momentum transfer ; this would lead to even more radiation than is shown below .",
    "the paper by mishustin _ et .",
    "@xcite , uses a coupling constant of @xmath143 , stronger than what is used here . as long as the coupling constant",
    "is of at least order 1 , this model predicts appreciable amounts of energy radiated through this channel .",
    "this is a crude model that has incorporated several simplifying assumptions",
    ". it would be inconsistent to think of the predicted numbers here as more than a rough guide to the order of magnitude of what may actually be seen . to remove any ambiguity in the coupling constant ,",
    "the angular distributions are shown with the coupling constant divided out .",
    "figures [ fig : stopping ] , [ fig : cross ] and [ fig : rapidity ] show the angular distribution of radiated energy in the form of vector mesons . following the analysis of section  [ sec : incoherence ] ,",
    "the energy flux is calculated as the incoherent sum of @xmath144 nucleons radiating as point particles , @xmath145 the factor @xmath146 is divided out in the figures to remove any ambiguity .",
    "= 0.197 gev . ]    in each of the figures , two of the parameters are held constant while the third is varied over reasonable values .",
    "the peak of energy flux occurs around @xmath147 off the beam - axis .",
    "it is seen that variations in the stopping time , @xmath83 , and the cross - section , @xmath119 , only affect the magnitude and not the characteristic angular distribution shape .",
    "changes in the rapidity loss , @xmath148 , affect both the magnitude and shape of the distribution with larger rapidity losses in this range causing less radiation and causing the peak to be moved further off axis and broadened .",
    "it is interesting to note that the smallest rapidity loss used in this study , @xmath149 , results in the most energy being radiated .",
    "this can be explained by considering the circumstances under which most of the energy is radiated . at relativistic speeds ,",
    "the energy radiated is dominated by the factor of @xmath150 in equation  ( [ eq : angular ] ) . a smaller rapidity loss results in the nucleus spending more time traveling faster , resulting in more radiation .",
    "of course this only holds over a small region . at some point",
    "the smallness of the acceleration overcomes the smallness of the denominator and at zero rapidity lost , there is no radiation .    for the intermediate values of the parameters ( @xmath151 fm ,",
    "@xmath152 mb and @xmath153 ) and @xmath154 ( pb beams ) the total energy radiated , @xmath155 , is @xmath156 gev .",
    "the total energy available to be radiated in this collision is @xmath157 gev . reducing the stopping parameter to @xmath158 fm gives @xmath159 gev . a rapidity loss of @xmath149 and a stopping parameter of @xmath151 fm gives @xmath160 gev out of a total available energy of @xmath161 gev .",
    "on the order of 1% of the total energy loss is through this channel .",
    "in this paper a model for treating the bremsstrahlung radiation of neutral vector mesons coupled to a baryon current during central relativistic heavy - ion collisions has been developed .",
    "this model treats the nuclei as clusters of baryons frozen in relative position over the time of the collision .",
    "the clusters velocities are modeled as changing smoothly with time .",
    "lorentz contraction greatly increases the baryon density relative to the scalar density ; hence , the scalar meson radiation becomes negligible at high energies .",
    "most of the energy is radiated as highly energetic vector mesons , allowing for their mass to be neglected .",
    "the vector mesons interact strongly with the baryons and therefore , an attenuation factor is included . to maintain the covariance of the model , this attenuation factor",
    "is assumed independent of angle .",
    "the modeling of the flow of the baryon current is the only freedom in the model . by using a smooth connection between the initial rapidity of the nuclei with the experimentally measurable final rapidity , the baryon current depends on just two parameters , the rapidity loss ( obtained from the initial and final rapidities ) and a stopping parameter which is allowed to vary freely .",
    "although this model is used well outside its tested domain , in the end only the vector field coupling to the conserved baryon current is seen .",
    "the model predicts a characteristic shape for the angular distribution of radiation that is robust against parameter variations .",
    "it appears this mechanism may contribute to meson production in the next generation of relativistic heavy - ion collisions like those at rhic .",
    "this possibility would seem to be worth exploring experimentally .",

    "<S> the ( @xmath0 ) model in mean - field approximation where the meson fields are treated classically , describes much of observed nuclear structure and has been employed to describe the nuclear equation of state up to the quark - gluon phase transition . </S>",
    "<S> the acceleration of the meson sources , for example , in relativistic heavy - ion collisions , should result in bremsstrahlung - like radiation of the meson fields . </S>",
    "<S> the many mesons emitted serve to justify the use of classical meson fields . </S>",
    "<S> the slowing of the nuclei during the collision is modeled here as a smooth transition from initial to final velocity . under ultra - relativistic conditions , vector radiation dominates . </S>",
    "<S> the angular distribution of energy flux shows a characteristic shape . </S>",
    "<S> it appears that if the vector meson field couples to the conserved baryon current , independent of the baryonic degrees of freedom , this mechanism will contribute to the radiation seen in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . the possible influence of the quark - gluon plasma is also considered .    </S>",
