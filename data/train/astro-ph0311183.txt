    "partial lists of known spectroscopic binaries among pre  main sequence ( pms ) stars have been presented by @xcite , @xcite , and others , and new binaries are slowly but continuously being added .",
    "more than two dozen of the systems with known orbits are double - lined spectroscopic binaries , which provide the most information on the individual masses of the components ( compared to single - lined spectroscopic binaries ) .",
    "the young star hd  34700 has recently been reported to be a double - lined spectroscopic binary by @xcite , who also provided evidence of velocity variations .",
    "hd  34700 was originally identified as a young object from its strong infrared excess as observed by iras @xcite , a characteristic usually interpreted in terms of a circumstellar disk in other similar  vega - excess \" stars .",
    "it is located in orion , although it is not clear whether it is associated with any of the star - forming complexes in the general vicinity .",
    "the optical , infrared , and millimeter - wave properties of hd  34700 have been modeled extensively by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "they inferred that the disk has inner and outer radii of roughly 2550  au and 550  au , respectively , depending on the model , and that the circumstellar material is composed mostly of relatively small dust grains ( size @xmath8 m ) .",
    "sub - millimeter observations have led to the detection of @xmath9co and @xmath10co emission , from which a total mass of @xmath61  m@xmath11 in dust particles has been derived @xcite .",
    "other estimates have varied between 0.2  m@xmath11 and 3.7  m@xmath11 @xcite , depending also on the assumed distance .",
    "molecular hydrogen in the disk has been searched for , but not seen @xcite .",
    "low - level optical linear polarization has been detected by @xcite and @xcite , consistent with a non - spherically symmetric distribution of dust ( a disk ) .",

    "as in other young objects , the  @xmath46708 absorption line is quite prominent in hd  34700 , and the h@xmath5 line is seen in emission with highly variable profiles @xcite . it is also a strong x - ray source .",
    "the spectral type of the star has been listed as g0 @xcite , or more recently as ge @xcite .",
    "given the interest in the object and the evidence that it may be a spectroscopic binary , the main motivation for this paper is to present high - resolution spectroscopic observations that indeed confirm its double - lined nature . from these observations",
    "we derive an accurate double - lined orbital solution .",
    "we discuss also the available indicators of youth .",
    "hd  34700 ( also hip  24855 , sao  112630 , iras  05170 + 0535 , @xmath12 , @xmath13 , j2000 , @xmath14 ) was originally placed on our observing program at the harvard - smithsonian center for astrophysics ( cfa ) in 1996 as part of a project to monitor the radial velocities of several dozen nearby stars believed to be young from a variety of spectroscopic and photometric indicators ( infrared excess , h@xmath5 emission , strong  @xmath46708 absorption , etc . ) .",
    "observations were obtained mostly with an echelle spectrograph on the 1.5-m wyeth reflector at the oak ridge observatory ( harvard , massachusetts ) , and occasionally also with a nearly identical instrument on the 1.5-m tillinghast reflector at the f.  l.  whipple observatory ( mt .  hopkins , arizona ) . a single echelle order centered at 5187",
    "  was recorded using intensified photon - counting reticon detectors , giving a spectral window of 45   .",
    "the resolving power of these observations is @xmath15 .",
    "the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratios range mostly from about 20 to 30 per resolution element of 8.5  , with the exception of our first exploratory exposure .",
    "that observation in march of 1996 clearly revealed the double - lined nature of the system from the double peaks in the cross - correlation function , despite being a very weak spectrum with a s / n ratio of only 7 .",
    "the relative strengths of the peaks were similar , indicating stars of nearly equal luminosity .",
    "once we realized this , exposure times were increased accordingly .",
    "subsequent observations confirmed the double peaks , and we continued to monitor the star for another four years , obtaining a total of 35 spectra .",
    "radial velocities were derived using todcor @xcite , a two - dimensional cross - correlation algorithm well suited to our relatively low s / n spectra .",
    "todcor uses two templates , one for each component of the binary , and combines one - dimensional correlation functions into a two - dimensional function that avoids the common blending problems of the standard procedures .",
    "the one - dimensional correlation functions were computed using the iraf task xcsao @xcite .",
    "the templates were selected from a large library of synthetic spectra based on model atmospheres by r.  l.kurucz , computed for us by jon morse ( see also * ? ? ? * ; * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "these calculated spectra are available for a wide range of effective temperatures ( @xmath16 ) , projected rotational velocities ( @xmath3 ) , surface gravities ( @xmath17 ) and metallicities .",
    "experience has shown that radial velocities are largely insensitive to the surface gravity and metallicity adopted for the templates .",
    "consequently , the optimum template for each star was determined from grids of cross - correlations over broad ranges in temperature and rotational velocity ( since these are the parameters that affect the radial velocities the most ) , for an adopted surface gravity of @xmath18 ( based on the system s probable pre  main sequence status ) and solar composition .",
    "the values obtained are @xmath19  k and @xmath20  for the primary star , and @xmath21  k and @xmath22  for the secondary , with estimated uncertainties of @xmath6150  k and 1  , respectively .",
    "these temperatures are consistent with the reported spectral type g0 .",
    "we see no evidence in our spectra of the phenomenon of veiling , which is common in many other young stars and was reported by @xcite to be present in hd  34700",
    ". however , veiling can be variable .",
    "table  [ tab : rvs ] lists the radial velocities for both components , referred to the heliocentric frame .",
    "typical uncertainties are given below .",
    "the stability of the zero - point of our velocity system was monitored by means of exposures of the dusk and dawn sky , and small systematic run - to - run corrections were applied in the manner described by @xcite .",
    "the accuracy of the cfa velocity system , which is within about 0.14  of the reference frame defined by minor planets in the solar system , is documented in the previous citation and also by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "following @xcite , we have also determined the light ratio between the secondary and the primary of hd  34700 at the mean wavelength of our spectroscopic observations ( 5187   ) , which is close to the @xmath23 band : @xmath24 .",
    "@xcite measured the equivalent widths of 105 relatively unblended lines in both components in one of their high resolution spectra , over the wavelength range 42606770  .",
    "the average ratio they found between the lines of the secondary and those of the primary is @xmath25 .",
    "since the stars are of very similar temperature , the line - strength ratio should be close to the light ratio between the stars .",
    "the @xcite value is somewhat higher than our own .",
    "we adopt in the following the straight average , @xmath26 .",
    "a double - lined orbital solution was easily obtained from our radial velocities , showing a period of 23.5 days and a significant eccentricity .",
    "this orbit is shown graphically in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] , and the elements are listed in table  [ tab : elem ] , where the symbols have their usual meaning .",
    "rms residuals for the primary and secondary are 1.70  and 1.34  , respectively .",
    "the slightly larger errors for the primary are explained by its higher value of @xmath27 .",
    "velocity residuals from our observations are listed in table  [ tab : rvs ] .",
    "the heliocentric center - of - mass velocity we derive is @xmath28  .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the radial velocity for the co material in the circumstellar disk measured by @xcite , which is @xmath2921  ( with a fwhm of 4.6  for the @xmath302 transition of co from which the velocity was measured ) .",
    "we note also that this radial velocity is not far from typical values in the orion star - forming region , which are about @xmath2925  ( although with a spread of several ; see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) .    in reporting double lines for hd  34700",
    ", @xcite also presented their radial velocity measurements for both components based on the three high - resolution spectra they obtained .",
    "those measurements are in fair agreement with our orbit , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : orbit ] smaller ) .",
    "if the smaller errors are adopted , then the agreement with our orbit for two of their velocities is considerably worse . ] .",
    "as described in  [ sec : intro ] , there are fairly compelling indications that hd  34700 is a young object from a number of independent studies based on a wide variety of observational techniques . @xcite considered the age to be @xmath610  myr or less , although based only on circumstantial evidence .",
    "the fundamental difficulty is that the distance to hd  34700 is essentially unknown , and therefore it can not be placed on the h - r diagram and compared to model isochrones in order to estimate the age .",
    "the star was measured by the hipparcos mission @xcite , but the published parallax is rather uncertain ( @xmath31  mas ) , and corresponds to a formal distance of 1160  pc .",
    "assumptions on the distance to hd  34700 in the literature have ranged from 55  pc @xcite to 90  pc @xcite , derived by adopting absolute magnitudes and intrinsic colors from the spectral type , and accounting roughly for extinction .",
    "@xcite adopted a lower limit of 180  pc , and @xcite relied on the hipparcos determination .",
    "based on the light ratio of @xmath26 (  [ sec : orbit ] ) and the apparent system magnitude of @xmath14 @xcite , we infer individual magnitudes of @xmath32 and @xmath33 assuming there is no extinction .",
    "we may then use theoretical isochrones such as those by @xcite ( see also * ? ? ?",
    "* ) along with our effective temperatures to compute the distance to each star assuming they are located on the zero - age main sequence ( zams ) , and adopting the solar value for the metallicity .",
    "this exercise results in distances of 122  pc and 125  pc for the primary and secondary , respectively .",
    "if the system were any closer , the stars would fall below the zams in the h - r diagram .",
    "an extinction value of @xmath34 changes these minimum distances slightly to 111  pc and 114  pc .",
    "thus we conclude that the distance to hd  34700 is unlikely to be less than about 100  pc , and therefore that the smaller values adopted to infer properties of the system in most of the previous studies ( which did not account for the binarity of the object , since it was not known at the time ) are probably unrealistic .",
    "a parallax such as that corresponding to 100  pc ( 10  mas ) is large enough that hipparcos would most likely have been able to measure it accurately .",
    "a distance of 250  pc ( @xmath35  mas ) , on the other hand , is only about 2@xmath36 from the nominal value reported in the catalog , and could have been mismeasured . at this distance",
    "the age inferred from the above models would be about 9  myr for both stars , in the absence of extinction .",
    "hd  34700 is located in orion ( @xmath68  northwest of the belt ) , though it is not particularly near any of the more conspicuous star - forming regions in that area .",
    "perhaps the closest connection that can be found is the similarity between its center - of - mass velocity and the typical radial velocities of other young stars in orion , mentioned earlier .",
    "nevertheless , if we assume the star s distance to be the same as the main star - forming complexes , or @xmath6460  pc , the age inferred from the brightness would be as young as 3  myr according to the model isochrones used above .    despite the quite extensive studies of hd  34700 over the past 15 years ,",
    "it is rather surprising that a measurement of the lithium abundance one of the key indicators of youth has not been made until very recently .",
    "@xcite measured more than 100 spectral lines for both components of the binary , including  @xmath46708 .",
    "the results were not mentioned explicitly in the text of their paper , but were reported in their table  2 ( available only in electronic form ) .",
    "the li equivalent width for the primary ( redward component in their spectra , according to our fig .",
    "[ sec : orbit ] ) is 0.0881   , and that for the secondary is 0.0790   .",
    "examination of their figure  2 suggests , however , that the li line for the blueward component ( secondary ) may be blended with the  @xmath46705.1 line of the redward component , in which case their li equivalent width may be overestimated for the secondary .",
    "we adopt the measurements at face value .",
    "correction for binarity using @xmath26 leads to final values of 0.17    for both components .",
    "equivalent widths such as these are not large compared to typical values in t  tauri stars , but hd  34700 is considerably hotter than most t  tauri stars .",
    "lithium depletion is a strong function of temperature , and possibly also of rotational velocity .",
    "comparison with diagrams of li equivalent width vs.  temperature such as those by @xcite ( their fig .",
    "3 ) , @xcite ( fig .",
    "2 ) , or @xcite ( fig .  1 ) , and others , indicate that the stars in hd  34700 lie essentially on the upper envelope of the pleiades distribution ( age @xmath6120  myr ) , and that the li strength is not quite as strong as in stars in the younger cluster ic  2602 ( age @xmath635  myr ) , which have equivalent widths of up to about 0.25  at these temperatures .",
    "we note , however , that if veiling were significant , as discussed by @xcite , the measured equivalent widths for hd  34700 could be underestimated because the lines may be filled in by featureless continuum radiation .",
    "therefore , the age of roughly 100  myr or so is only an upper limit .",
    "nevertheless , on the basis of the li strength alone it is quite possible that the age is several tens of myr instead of a few myr , and therefore that it is not as young as some of the other evidence presented above would seem to suggest .",
    "as proposed by @xcite , hd  34700 could be a young g star near the end of the t  tauri phase . from fig .  5 in @xcite and using the effective temperatures we determined for each star",
    ", we estimate the abundance of li as @xmath37(li ) @xmath38 3.13.2 on a scale where @xmath37(h ) @xmath39 .",
    "hd  34700 shows h@xmath5 in emission , and the line profile changes significantly on very short timescales ( @xmath61 day ) , as illustrated by @xcite .",
    "the equivalent width they measured is only 0.6   , which places it in the weak - line t  tauri class as opposed to the classical t  tauri group emission ( @xmath60.2   ) can be derived from fig .  2 of @xcite .",
    "profile variations in other lines have also been reported by @xcite .",
    "such changes are not uncommon in young stars .",
    "the object is also a strong x - ray source , with a ratio of x - ray to optical flux of @xmath40 .",
    "it is listed in the rosat all - sky survey bright source catalogue @xcite under the designation 1rxs  j051945.3@xmath29053509 , and its x - ray properties ( flux , hardness ratios , etc . )",
    "are consistent with those of other young stars ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the projected rotational velocity measurements we reported earlier ( 28  and 22  for the primary and secondary , respectively ;  [ sec : obs ] ) are quite close to those given by @xcite ( 25  and 23  ) , although very different from the @xmath3 of @xmath41  determined by @xcite .",
    "the latter value is based on two high - resolution spectra ( @xmath42 , slightly higher than the resolution of our own observations ) taken at similar orbital phases of 0.67 and 0.72 ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : orbit ] ) . by chance one of our exposures was obtained on the same night as the first of the mora et al .",
    "spectra . fig .",
    "[ fig : badvsini ] shows that the lines in that spectrum are severely blended due in part to their intrinsic broadening , which explains the large @xmath3 measurement by @xcite .",
    "the velocity separation at this phase is @xmath640  . at other phases the lines",
    "are clearly separated , as seen in the figure .",
    "the @xmath3 values for the components of hd  34700 are relatively large , and one may ask whether they could be the result of tidal locking of the rotation with the orbital motion of the binary , which often goes together with orbital circularization in closer systems . the significant eccentricity of the orbit and relatively long period of 23.5 days seem to argue against this , although as a rule orbital circularization occurs on much longer timescales than rotational synchronization ( see , e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "if the rotation period @xmath43 of each star were the same as the orbital period , the measured @xmath3 values and the relation @xmath44 lead to values for the projected radii of @xmath45  r@xmath46 and @xmath47  r@xmath46 . these seem much too large for pms stars of this temperature .",
    "even if the rotational period corresponded to the orbital motion at periastron (  pseudo - synchronization \" ) , eq.(42 ) of @xcite predicts a correction factor for @xmath43 of 0.72 at the measured eccentricity of hd  34700 .",
    "the projected radii would then be @xmath48  r@xmath46 and @xmath49  r@xmath46 , still too large in absolute terms by the time the increase due to the projection factor is accounted for . for comparison , at the distance of orion ( and an age of 3  myr ) the same theoretical isochrones used above predict sizes for the stars of about 4.4  r@xmath46 .",
    "thus , the components in this system are spinning much more rapidly than synchronization would imply ( at least twice as fast ) .",
    "this may perhaps be considered one more indication of youth , since main sequence stars of this spectral type do not usually rotate at more than a few  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "based on the pms models by @xcite and assuming that hd  34700 is at a representative distance of 200  pc , we estimate that the absolute masses of the components are roughly 1.11.2  m@xmath46 , similar to what is expected for main sequence stars of the same spectral type .",
    "the minimum masses from our orbital solution ( table  [ tab : elem ] ) , in turn , imply an inclination angle for the orbit of about 50 .",
    "the semimajor axis is then 0.21  au , which is well within the inner radius of the circumstellar disk as modeled by @xcite and @xcite . at the same distance of 200  pc",
    "the angular semimajor axis would be 1  mas , difficult to resolve with current interferometers , although the eccentricity of the orbit would make the actual separation some 25% larger at certain phases .",
    "if the system is at the distance of orion , the masses inferred from the evolutionary tracks are about twice as large ( and the orbital inclination angle @xmath639 ) , the linear semimajor axis only slightly larger than before ( 0.26  au ) , and the angular semimajor axis would be about 0.6  mas .",
    "detecting the motion of the _ photocenter _ of the pair is far beyond the capabilities of the hipparcos mission ( initially we had considered the unmodeled photocentric motion as a possible explanation for the large error in the parallax ) . from the mass ratio and light ratio determined here , we estimate the semimajor axis of the photocenter to be only 2.3% of the angular semimajor axis of the relative orbit .",
    "this is mostly because the stars are of similar brightness , so their center of light does not move much . at the distance of orion",
    ", the 14  @xmath50as signal would be challenging to measure even for nasa s space interferometry mission .",
    "finally , we note that the hipparcos epoch photometry ( @xmath51 band ) shows no sign of photometric variability at the few milli - magnitude level over the duration of the satellite s 3-year mission , which is somewhat unexpected if the star is very young , but perhaps not so much so if it is already near the zams .",
    "similar evidence in the @xmath52 bands was presented by @xcite .",
    "we have confirmed the young star hd  34700 to be a double - lined spectroscopic binary , and presented an accurate orbital solution with a period of 23.4877  days and a significant eccentricity ( @xmath53 ) .",
    "the components are of very nearly equal mass , temperature , and luminosity .",
    "the measured projected rotational velocities indicate super - synchronous rotation in both stars .",
    "\\(f ) rapid rotation of the components ( 28  and 22  , @xmath610 times faster than main - sequence stars of similar spectral type ) in an orbit that is wide enough that the stars are not tidally synchronized .",
    "it is difficult to estimate a precise age for the system due to the lack of an accurate parallax .",
    "if it is at the distance of orion , theoretical isochrones indicate it is only a few myr old",
    ". however , it could be closer and therefore be approaching the zams , in which case the age could be several tens of myr .",
    "the  @xmath46708 absorption is not quite as strong as seen in other very young stars , but the li measurements for hd  34700 may perhaps be affected by veiling .      this research has made use of the simbad database , operated at cds , strasbourg , france , and of nasa s astrophysics data system abstract service .",
