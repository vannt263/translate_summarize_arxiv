    "over the past decade it has become clear that radio sources emanating from super - massive black - holes in the centres of galaxies are - rather than merely a by - product of galaxy evolution - key players in the formation and evolution of galaxies throughout the universe .",
    "it is now fairly well established that the properties of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are intimately linked with the properties of their host galaxies . while empirical evidence has established the co - evolution of massive black holes and their host galaxies at various redshifts ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , see also @xcite ) ,",
    "numerical simulations demonstrate that agn - induced outflows are important feedback processes for clearing the circum - nuclear regions and halting the growth of the super - massive black - holes , regulating the correlations found between the black - hole mass and the host galaxy s bulge properties and preventing the formation of too many massive galaxies in the early universe ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite )",
    ".    an important phase of agn feedback is when synchrotron jets emanating from the central black - hole region start propagating into the host galaxy s inter - stellar medium ( ism ) . at high redshifts , radio sources",
    "are observed to be aligned with optical continuum from warm gas and stars ( @xcite , @xcite ) and the gas in these regions is characterised by highly disturbed kinematics ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this indicates that radio sources vigorously interact with the host galaxy s ism , entrain and expel gas and induce or quench star formation ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "also , the impact of supersonic jets onto the ism / igm can create cocoons of ( shocked ) gas and synchrotron emission with ` hot - spot ' morphologies , while entrainment of gas by slower jets can lead to bright radio sources with edge - darkened lobes ( see e.g. reviews by * ? ? ?",

    "this may occur because the spatial resolution of our observations is coarser than the underlying radio continuum structure , hence the hi  absorption is less affected by beam - dilution than hi  emission and could trace the more inner regions of the hi  disc .",
    "] this also means that the eastern radio jet is most likely the ` far ' side of the radio source ( where the radio continuum is behind the absorbing gas in the disc ) , while the western jet is the ` near ' side .",
    "the third feature is a narrow absorption against the western jet , which is blueshifted by @xmath1750 km  s@xmath3  with respect to v@xmath22 .",
    "[ fig : hidisc ] _",
    "( middle ) _ shows that also this hi  component is most likely part of the large - scale , edge - on hi  disc that embeds the small radio source , although it can not be ruled out that this blueshifted hi  absorption represents an outflow of neutral gas driven by the propagating radio jets .",
    "figure [ fig : absorption ] also shows indications of a narrow and much weaker hi  absorption component against the eastern radio jet in ngc  3801 , around v@xmath173550 km  s@xmath3 .",
    "higher resolution hi  absorption observations are essential for studying the nature of the various absorption features in more detail . for this , we refer to ongoing work by @xcite .",
    "figure [ fig : hienvironment ] shows the hi  environment of ngc  3801 , with five other galaxies detected in hi  emission .",
    "table [ tab : companions ] summarises the hi  properties of these systems .",
    "the bulk of the hi  in these companion galaxies is distributed in disc - like structures .",
    "we also find two ` clouds ' of hi  gas that are not associated with an optical counterpart in the sdss image of fig .",
    "[ fig : hienvironment ] .",
    "one of them , cloud a , has a velocity that coincides with that of the eastern part of the hi  disc of ngc  3801 , as well as companion 3 , and is located 83 kpc south of ngc  3801 ( note that the velocity of cloud a is significantly offset from that of the much nearer companion 4 ; see fig .",

    "cloud b coincides in both velocity and location with the hi - rich companion 6 ( ngc  3806 ) and is most likely gas that is either stripped off , or being accreted onto , the hi  disc of ngc  3806 .",
    "if these clouds of hi  gas are tidal in origin , and given that the total hi  mass of both clouds ( @xmath23 m@xmath24 ) is similar to that of ngc  3801 s close companion ngc  3802 , this indicates that past as well as ongoing interactions could have a profound influence on the evolution of this group of galaxies .",
    "[ tab : absorption ]    .hi  absorption properties [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      based on its peculiar optical morphology and co content in the inner few kpc , it has been suggested that ngc  3801 could have been involved in a gas - rich galaxy - galaxy merger ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "our hi  results are in agreement with such a scenario , given that the formation of a large - scale hi  disc can be the natural outcome of a galaxy merger over significant time - scales ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "simulations of merging galaxies by @xcite show that gaseous and stellar discs in the progenitor galaxies can be tidally disrupted , depending on the orbital parameters of the merging galaxies ( in particular direct encounters can create large gaseous tidal - tails ) .",
    "@xcite shows that part of this expelled material can be re - accreted back onto the newly formed host galaxy and settle into a large - scale gas disc on time - scales of one to several gyr .",
    "the bulk of the hi  gas in the disc of ngc  3801 shows regular rotation , which means that the gas must have had enough time to settle into the observed disc - like structure . as a rough estimate of the merger time - scale",
    ", we assume that this process must have lasted at least one orbital period , or @xmath25 yr .",
    "the age of the radio source is significantly less than this ( @xmath26 yr ; * ? ? ?",
    "while there is no evidence for a direct causal connection between the possible merger event and the triggering of the radio source , there would have been a significant time - delay between the start of the merger and the onset of the current episode of the radio - agn activity .",
    "similar time - delays between merger ( and associated starburst episode ) and radio - agn activity have been observed in other nearby radio galaxies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "we note , however , that our hi  results alone do not provide conclusive evidence that the large - scale hi  disc in ngc  3801 was formed as a result of a major merger .",
    "minor mergers or interactions with satellite galaxies ( similar to the ongoing interaction between ngc  3801 and ngc  3802 ) may also have played a role in both shaping the hi  disc as well as triggering nuclear activity in ngc  3801 .",
    "given that the bulk of the hi  gas that we find in our data cube is associated with companion galaxies that are all within @xmath27 km  s@xmath3  from the central velocity of ngc  3801 , it is possible that the hi  gas in the disc of ngc  3801 was delivered by former gas - rich companions over the course of several gyr ( similar to what is discussed by @xcite for the large hi  disc in radio galaxy ngc1167 ) .",
    "another possibility is that accretion of cold gas played a major role in the formation of the hi  disc .",
    "simulations by @xcite show that extended rings of gas in polar - ring galaxies may form naturally through the accretion of cold gas falling in along large filamentary structures , while @xcite argue that it is more likely for polar - ring galaxies to acquire their gaseous discs through tidal accretion from a gas - rich donor galaxy rather than a violent merger .",
    "a similar mechanism may have formed the large - scale hi  disc in ngc  3801 .      as mentioned above , the alignment of the small radio source in ngc  3801 with the large - scale outer hi  disc makes ngc  3801 an ideal nearby radio galaxy for studying the early stage of radio - source evolution and its interaction with the surrounding cold ism .",
    "@xcite find evidence for shocked heated shells of hot gas associated with the radio source in ngc  3801 , caused by supersonic , over - pressured radio jets .",
    "their findings indicate that the radio source in ngc  3801 is heavily interacting with the surrounding ism . in proceedings based on high - resolution vla hi  observations , @xcite report the presence of a broad , faint , blueshifted absorption and an hi  clump associated with the shocked shell around the eastern lobe , possibly reflecting a gas outflow .",
    "our lower resolution hi  data do not show clear evidence for a broad , blueshifted absorption , but such a faint hi  absorption feature could be filled in with hi  emission within the relatively large beam of our observations . we do detect an apparent blueshifted narrow absorption component against the western radio lobe , but as discussed in sect .",
    "[ sec : absorption ] , this most likely represents hi  gas as part of the large - scale hi  disc .",
    "similar to ngc  3801 , there are other known radio galaxies in which the radio source propagates into an outer hi  disc .",
    "this includes coma  a , where the radio lobes ionise part of the disc @xcite and ic  5063 , where the radio jets produce fast outflows of hi  gas @xcite .",
    "particularly interesting is also the similarity with the disc - dominated radio galaxy b2  0722 + 30 , which hosts a small fr - i  radio source ( similar to ngc  3801 ) that propagates close to the plane of the disc , in the direction of a heavily interacting hi - rich galaxy pair @xcite .      in general , roughly 10@xmath28 of early - type galaxies outside clusters contain large amounts of hi  gas ( m@xmath29m@xmath24 ) , often distributed in large - scale disc- or ring - like structures @xcite . in @xcite",
    ", we showed that the overall hi  properties of nearby , non - cluster low - power radio galaxies are similar to those of radio - quiet early - type galaxies , with large - scale hi  discs detected in a significant fraction of radio - loud systems .",
    "in addition , we showed that there is a clear segregation in hi  content with radio size , in the sense that massive , large - scale hi  discs are only found in the host galaxies of compact radio sources , while none of the more extended fr - i  radio sources studied contain similar amounts of hi  gas @xcite .",
    "the radio source in ngc  3801 is @xmath6 kpc in diameter @xcite . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : himasssize ] , the hi  properties of ngc  3801 are thus similar to those of a significant fraction of nearby low - power compact radio sources .",
    "it is likely that in these systems the early evolution of the radio source is intimately linked with the surrounding cold ism , and that either confinement by the dense ism or inefficient fuelling ( through clumpiness of the cold ism and associated non - steady accretion ) keeps the radio source compact ( see discussions in * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative scenario , recently raised by @xcite in a study of the powerful compact radio source pks  1814 - 637 , suggests that the radio emission in these hi - rich compact radio sources may be boosted , at least temporarily , by the interaction of the radio jets with the rich ism , implying that intrinsically these compact sources may reflect a link to radio - agn in seyfert galaxies ( see also @xcite , where we speculate that the transition from radio - agn in seyferts to the brighter compact radio sources to classical fr - is may perhaps be linked to a transition from well - defined star - forming hi  discs to low surface brightness hi  discs to hi - poor host galaxies ) .",
    "ngc  3801 is classified as an fr - i  radio galaxy , based on its total radio power ( @xmath5whz@xmath3 ) , radio source morphology @xcite and weak emission - line spectrum @xcite .",
    "however , x - ray observations by @xcite show that ngc  3801 has supersonic , over - pressured radio jets , not commonly found in fr - i  sources @xcite .",
    "these x - ray studies also reveal a high absorbing column towards the nucleus ( possibly representing an obscuring torus ) , something that is generally not associated with fr - i  sources @xcite .",
    "@xcite suggest that these properties may more closely resemble those of high - power , high - excitation fr - ii  sources , which are believed to be post - merger systems that are fuelled by cold gas driven into the central region to form a radiatively - efficient classical accretion disc ( contrary to low - power / low - excitation fr - is , which are believed to be fuelled mainly through a quasi - spherical bondi accretion of circum - galactic hot gas directly onto the nucleus ; see e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "this scenario is in agreement with our hi  results , which show that ngc  3801 is likely a post - merger system with large amounts of cold gas . ) , but note that the accretion rate necessary to sustain agn activity could be so low that it is well beyond our observing capabilities @xcite . ]",
