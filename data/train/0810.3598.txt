    "it was recently pointed out  @xcite that the existence of a 4th generation could have great implications on the baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) . by shifting the jarlskog invariant product  @xcite for @xmath4 violation ( cpv ) of the 3 generation standard model ( sm3 ) by one generation , i.e. from 1 - 2 - 3 to 2 - 3 - 4 quarks , one gains by more than @xmath5 in effective cpv , and",
    "may be sufficient for bau",
    "! on the other hand , with renewed interest in the existence of a sequential 4th generation for cpv studies in b decays ( see the references in  @xcite ) , and with experimental discovery or refutation expected at the lhc in due time , we turn to the lepton sector .",
    "the difference between the experimental value of muon @xmath6 and the sm3 prediction has been around for some time now  @xcite , i.e. @xmath7 where @xmath8 . the difference is over 3.4@xmath9 , which has aroused a lot of interest . on the other hand , we have very stringent bounds on lepton flavor violating ( lfv ) rare decays , such as  @xcite @xmath10 at 90% c.l .",
    "these limits could be improved further in the near future . however , the calculations of @xmath11 and @xmath12 are intimately related , coming from similar diagram , fig .",

    "we find @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath3 is the lepton mixing matrix element .",
    "we depict @xmath17 versus @xmath18 in fig .",
    "we see that @xmath17 is a _",
    "well - behaved _ function and _ bounded_. from @xmath19 gev  @xcite , we see that @xmath20 needs to be 0.7 or higher to reach within @xmath21 of eq .",

    "[ mutoegam ] , however , this is clearly unrealistic . we conclude that the difference of eq .  [ difference ] can not come from the addition of a 4th neutral lepton @xmath1 .",
    "going beyond sm , we turn to 2hdm - ii ( which occurs for mssm ) , where up and down type quarks receive masses from different higgs doublets .",

    "however , in the 2hdm - i , the @xmath40 coupling relative to its sm value , @xmath41 , is given by @xmath42 .",
    "large @xmath43 will make the coupling strength @xmath44 or @xmath45 , and becomes nonperturbative , which leads us to reject this possibility .      in the 2hdm - iii , fcncs are allowed because there exist two matrices @xmath47 and @xmath48 simultaneously for each lepton type . to regulate the fcnc in face of stringent constraints",
    ", there is the ansatz suggested by cheng and sher  @xcite for the quark sector , i.e. all @xmath49 couplings have the same form @xmath50 where @xmath51 is @xmath52 .",

    "considering the positivity of eq .",
    "[ difference ] , we assume @xmath54 is very heavy and its effect can be neglected . for sake of illustration , we set @xmath55 to be the lightest neutral higgs , and assume no mixing between @xmath56 and @xmath55 , fig .",

    "[ mutoegam ] gives a very stringent constraint .",
    "note that because @xmath11 and @xmath60 come from similar structure of loop diagrams , their formulas are very closely related .",
    "after some organization , we have @xmath61 consider the case of @xmath62 in the loop , which is the leading contribution with 3 generations .",

    "the corresponding loops to @xmath69 and @xmath70 are @xmath71-@xmath72 and @xmath73-@xmath73-@xmath74 respectively . in the mass degeneracy limit for superparticles , @xmath75 , and with large @xmath43 ( to compensate the extra heaviness of @xmath76 ) @xcite , we can get a sufficient contribution to eq .",
