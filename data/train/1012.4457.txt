    "the origins of the two stable isotopes of boron , @xmath3b and @xmath2b , remain uncertain despite numerous theoretical and observational advances over the past four decades ( see the reviews by reeves 1994 ; vangioni - flam et al .",
    "2000 ; prantzos 2007 ) .",
    "as one of the rare light elements ( a group that also includes lithium and beryllium ) , boron can not be synthesized through quiescent burning in stellar interiors , where it is destroyed at temperatures that exceed @xmath4 k , nor is it produced in significant quantities by the standard model of the big bang .",
    "the spallation of interstellar nuclei by relativistic galactic cosmic rays ( gcr ) , as originally proposed by reeves et al .",
    "( 1970 ) , is known to be an effective means of producing the light elements . however , detailed models of gcr spallation ( e.g. , meneguzzi et al . 1971 , hereafter mar ; ramaty et al .",
    "1997 ) , while successful at reproducing the solar system abundance of @xmath3b ( as well as @xmath5be and , by including the @xmath6-@xmath6 fusion reactions , @xmath7li ) , fail to adequately account for @xmath2b ( and @xmath8li ) .",
    "standard gcr nucleosynthesis predicts a boron isotopic ratio of @xmath2b/@xmath3b  =  2.4 ( mar ) , in conflict with the value measured for solar system material ( 4.0 ; lodders 2003 ) .",
    "still , since the threshold energies for spallation reactions leading to @xmath2b are generally lower than those for reactions that produce @xmath3b , it is possible to account for the discrepancy by adopting a cosmic - ray spectrum enhanced at low energies ( particularly in the range 5@xmath940  mev nucleon@xmath10 ; see mar ; meneguzzi & reeves 1975 ) . the gcr energy spectrum below 1",
    "gev nucleon@xmath10 is highly uncertain due to the effects of solar modulation , meaning that there are no direct observational constraints against a large flux of low - energy cosmic rays .    in the present - day interstellar medium ( ism ) ,",
    "the dominant contribution to cosmic - ray nucleosynthesis comes from forward spallation reactions ( i.e. , energetic protons and @xmath6-particles impinging on interstellar cno nuclei ) .",
    "forward spallation is a secondary production mechanism because it depends on the metallicity of the ism ( i.e. , the cno abundances ) and on the rate of supernovae occurring in the galaxy ( supernovae being the presumed sources of gcr acceleration ) . over galactic evolutionary timescales ,",
    "the abundances of light elements synthesized via forward spallation should scale quadratically with the abundances of the metals that serve as interstellar targets .",
    "however , this fact is contrary to the well - known primary behavior exhibited by beryllium and boron in the halo .",
    "studies of metal - poor halo stars ( e.g. , gilmore et al .",
    "1992 ; duncan et al .",
    "1992 , 1997 ; garca lpez et al .",
    "1998 ; boesgaard et al .",
    "1999 ) have consistently shown that be and b abundances increase approximately linearly with metallicity .",
    "thus , many investigations ( e.g. , cass et al .",
    "1995 ; ramaty et al .",
    "1996 ; vangioni - flam et al .",
    "1996 ) have focused on scenarios involving reverse spallation reactions ( i.e. , accelerated cno nuclei being spalled from ambient interstellar h and he ) . in these models , low - energy , metal - enriched cosmic rays are accelerated in superbubbles ( parizot & drury 1999 , 2000 ; parizot 2000 ) by shocks associated with type ii supernovae ( sne ii ) or by the winds of massive wolf - rayet stars , and then interact with nearby interstellar material .",
    "since light elements produced in superbubbles result from the breakup of freshly synthesized cno nuclei , the superbubble model represents a primary mechanism that can operate throughout the lifetime of the galaxy and may be particularly important at early times .",
    "neutrino - induced spallation in sne ii ( the @xmath11-process ; woosley et al .",
    "1990 ) offers an alternative explanation for primary boron production and could ameliorate the problem in standard gcr nucleosynthesis of a low predicted @xmath2b/@xmath3b ratio .",
    "a significant amount of @xmath2b ( though virtually no @xmath3b ) is expected to be synthesized during the collapse of a massive star s core as the immense flux of neutrinos interacts with @xmath12c in the carbon - rich shell . models of core - collapse supernovae that incorporate the @xmath11-process ( see woosley & weaver 1995 , hereafter ww95 ) also predict substantial yields for @xmath8li ( produced in the helium shell ) and @xmath13f ( in the neon shell ) .",
    "timmes et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , adopting the ww95 yields for their model of galactic chemical evolution ( gce ) , conclude that a major portion of the cosmic abundances of @xmath2b and @xmath13f , and about half of the @xmath8li abundance , can be attributed to neutrino nucleosynthesis .",
    "however , these prescriptions may be difficult to accommodate if other sources [ e.g. , cosmic - ray spallation for @xmath2b and @xmath8li , big bang nucleosynthesis for @xmath8li , stellar processing in asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars for @xmath8li and @xmath13f ] must also contribute . in the spallation models of fields et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , which include a gcr , superbubble , and neutrino component , the @xmath11-process yields of ww95 had to be reduced by 60% in order to avoid the overproduction of @xmath2b .",
    "the @xmath11-process interactions chiefly involve the @xmath14- and @xmath15-neutrinos because these have higher temperatures , yet the temperatures are uncertain and the light element yields are strongly dependent on these values .",
    "yoshida et al . ( 2005 , 2008 ) constrained the @xmath14- and @xmath15-neutrino temperatures by requiring that @xmath11-process synthesis not result in @xmath2b overproduction , in accordance with gce models that include cosmic - ray spallation ( e.g. , ramaty et al .",
    "2000 ; fields et al .",
    "the constraints place the temperatures between 60% and 80% of the value adopted in ww95 , though even lower temperatures are inferred if neutrino oscillation effects are taken into account ( see yoshida et al .",
    "2006 , 2008 ) .",
    "the extent to which the various nucleosynthetic processes contribute to the enhancement in the solar system abundance of @xmath2b over that predicted by standard gcr spallation is still unclear .",
    "however , since all of the boron production mechanisms occur in , or are closely associated with , the ism , additional clues could potentially be gleaned from a careful study of interstellar boron abundances and isotopic ratios .",
    "boron was first detected in the ism by meneguzzi & york ( 1980 ) , who used the _ copernicus _ satellite to measure absorption from the b  ii  @xmath01362 resonance line toward @xmath16  ori .",
    "they obtained an interstellar abundance ( b / h = @xmath17 ) in good agreement with the then - current stellar value ( @xmath18 ; boesgaard & heacox 1978 ) , assumed to be the galactic value .",
    "later investigations with the goddard high resolution spectrograph ( ghrs ) on board the _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ; e.g. , federman et al .",
    "1993 ; jura et al .",
    "1996 ) added new sight lines to the list of detections ( all toward nearby stars ) and found that the interstellar abundances were substantially lower than both the solar and stellar values .",
    "this led jura et al .",
    "( 1996 ) to propose a scenario involving either the recent infall of metal - poor material in the vicinity of the sun or the depletion of boron onto interstellar grains .",
    "federman et al . ( 1996a ) , examining ghrs data for the line of sight to @xmath19  sco , provided the first measurement of the @xmath2b/@xmath3b ratio outside the solar system . their result",
    "( @xmath2b/@xmath3b = 3.4@xmath20 ) , along with the subsequent work of lambert et al . ( 1998 ) , showed that the solar system ratio is not anomalous but probably representative of the local galactic neighborhood .",
    "the b  ii survey by howk et al .",
    "( 2000 ) expanded the sample of interstellar boron abundances to include some of the more extended sight lines accessible to the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) of _ hst_. these authors found that the gas - phase b / o ratio decreases with increasing average hydrogen density and interpreted the trend as an indication of interstellar depletion . from the least depleted sight line , they derived a lower limit to the present - day total interstellar boron abundance of b / h @xmath21 @xmath22 .",
    "the discovery by knauth et al .",
    "( 2000 ) of newly synthesized lithium toward @xmath23 per , a member of the per ob2 association , was an important new development in the study of light element nucleosynthesis .",
    "at least one of the clouds in the @xmath23 per direction has a low @xmath8li/@xmath7li ratio ( @xmath24 ; knauth et al .",
    "2000 , 2003b ) , consistent with the ratio predicted by standard gcr spallation ( 1.5 ; mar ) and much lower than the solar system value ( 12.2 ; lodders 2003 ) .",
    "the line of sight to @xmath23 per passes very near the massive star - forming region ic  348 and measurements of interstellar oh suggest that the sight line possesses an order - of - magnitude higher cosmic - ray flux compared to other sight lines in per ob2 ( federman et al .",
    "the implication is that accelerated particles supplied by the star - forming region are interacting with ambient interstellar material in the direction of @xmath23 per , leading to an enhancement in @xmath7li relative to @xmath8li .",
    "this unexpected result prompted our stis program ( go 8622 ) aimed at measuring @xmath2b/@xmath3b ratios in per ob2 from observations of the b  ii line toward four stars : 40 per , @xmath23 per , @xmath25 per , and x per .",
    "ultimately , the acquired stis spectra lacked the signal - to - noise ( s / n ) ratio necessary to yield meaningful results on @xmath2b/@xmath3b , though the data did provide accurate b  ii column densities . therefore",
    ", we redirected our efforts to obtaining elemental boron abundances for a larger , more statistically significant sample of galactic sight lines .",
    "such a sample is needed to determine conclusively the level of boron depletion in interstellar gas .",
    "this information would then enable a more robust interpretation of the observed abundances and possibly allow the detection of intrinsic abundance variations , which , if discovered , could offer vital clues to the nucleosynthetic origin of boron and other light elements .    in this investigation , we more than quadruple the number of interstellar sight lines with significant detections of the b  ii line by taking advantage of the wealth of uv data provided by the _",

    "the remainder of this paper is organized as follows .",
    "we describe the observations and our reduction of the data in   2 .",
    "the methods used to obtain column densities ( i.e. , the integration of apparent column density profiles and the method of profile synthesis ) are detailed in   3 , where we also provide a comparison with previous studies .",
    "the profile synthesis results are utilized in   4 to determine",
    "elemental abundances (   4.1 ) and depletions (   4.2 ) and trends are sought with various measures of gas density . in   4.3 , the boron abundances are examined in detail to search for intrinsic variations superimposed on the general trend due to depletion .",

    "the b  ii resonance line at 1362.46   probes the dominant ionization stage of boron in diffuse clouds because the ionization potential of neutral boron ( 8.30  ev ) is below the lyman limit . currently , the space telescope imaging spectrograph is the only uv - sensitive instrument capable of observing b  ii at high enough spectral resolution to study interstellar absorption profiles in detail . our sample of 56 galactic sight lines ( see table  1 ) is the result of a comprehensive search of all archival stis datasets with the necessary wavelength coverage for absorption from b  ii  @xmath01362 .",

    "these data are reexamined here for consistency , enabling an important comparison between the results of two independent investigations .    along with the b  ii line , the uv spectra yield information on o  i  @xmath01355 , cu  ii  @xmath01358 , and ga  ii  @xmath01414 .",
    "the interstellar absorption profiles resulting from these transitions are useful for determining the cloud component structure to be applied to the weaker b  ii profile .",
    "since o@xmath26 , cu@xmath27 , and ga@xmath27 are each the dominant ion of their element in neutral diffuse clouds , these species should coexist with b@xmath27 along the diffuse and translucent sight lines studied here . for many directions , high resolution ground - based data on ca",

    "the ghrs sight lines are included in our abundance analysis (  4 ) , though we do not rederive b  ii column densities in these directions .",
    "the spectral types , @xmath32 magnitudes , and galactic coordinates in table  1 are from the simbad database , while , for most sight lines , the values for interstellar reddening and distance are taken from the same references that provided column densities of h  i or , if data on atomic hydrogen are lacking , h@xmath33 ( see   4.1 ) .",

    "table  1 also lists any known associations for the program stars .",
    "the full boron sample probes a diverse array of interstellar environments , spanning at least two orders of magnitude in average sight - line density and more than four orders of magnitude in molecular hydrogen fraction . over 50% of the sample stars reside in ob associations or young stellar clusters , another three stars are associated with h  ii regions , and eight are located in the galactic halo",

    "while there is a significant range in heliocentric distance in the sample , it is likely that much of the interstellar material traced by the stis and ghrs observations of these stars resides in the local ism .",
    "this can be inferred from the velocities of the dominant absorption components , which are typically near the velocity of the local standard of rest . still , many of the extended sight lines observed with stis exhibit double - peaked absorption profiles , indicating that the sight lines pass through both local gas and gas associated with either the sagittarius - carina or perseus spiral arm . figure  1 confirms that stars displaying such features in their interstellar spectra indeed lie either behind or within one of the two nearest spiral arms from the vantage point of the sun .",
    "these directions offer the unique opportunity to study variations in elemental abundances in clouds at different distances along the line of sight .",
    "the overall diversity of sight - line properties in our sample allows us to thoroughly investigate the role played by physical environment in the observed abundances of boron in diffuse clouds .",
    "stis observations employing the fuv multi - anode microchannel array ( mama ) detector and either the high - resolution ( e140h ) or medium - resolution ( e140 m ) grating in both prime and secondary modes were examined to identify sight lines with unambiguous interstellar absorption from o  i  @xmath01355 , cu  ii  @xmath01358 , and ga  ii  @xmath01414 .",

    "the b  ii line is located in order 309 of the e140h grating . when the central wavelength is set to 1271 ",
    ", this order typically falls close to the edge of the fuv mama detector . because the spectral format of stis is periodically shifted by the mode select mechanism ( msm ) to avoid charge depletion in localized regions of the mama , a given exposure with a central wavelength of 1271   may or may not include order 309 ( see kim quijano et al .",

    "this procedure contributed 22 of the initial 67 detections of interstellar b  ii . from the preliminary sample ,",
    "only those sight lines with estimated b  ii line strengths of 3  @xmath34 or greater were retained for further analysis .",
    "the final sample contains 37 such detections from e140h data and another 19 exclusively from e140 m .",
    "two sight lines ( hd  88115 and cpd@xmath959 2603 ) have data at both settings covering the b  ii transition , allowing a direct comparison between the column densities derived from high- and medium - resolution absorption profiles ( see  3.2.3 ) .",
    "all stis datasets for the final sample of interstellar sight lines were obtained from the multimission archive at stsci ( mast ) after the close - out re - calibration of stis archival data , completed in 2007 .",
    "the re - calibrated datasets benefit from an improved flux calibration and blaze - shift correction for all echelle modes .",
    "however , because the observations used to calibrate the echelle sensitivities employed non - zero offsets of the msm , some edge orders present in previous calibration observations are now missing ( see aloisi et al .",
    "these orders are not included in the updated photometric conversion table ( phottab ) , which gives the throughput as a function of spectral order , and were not extracted by the calstis pipeline during re - calibration .",
    "in particular , orders 309 and 310 , the latter of which contains the o  i and cu  ii absorption lines , are not present in re - calibrated data with a central wavelength of 1271  .",
    "these orders had to be extracted manually from the flat - fielded science files obtained from the archive .",
    "this was accomplished by re - running x1d , the one - dimensional spectral extraction portion of calstis , within the space telescope science data analysis system ( stsdas ) using an older version of the phottab reference table .",
    "the older sensitivities have higher systematic uncertainties and there is no blaze - shift correction in the table for secondary modes . as a result ,",
    "the flux calibration based on the older sensitivities can differ from the new re - calibration by as much as 5@xmath98% ( aloisi et al .",
    "however , the analysis of interstellar absorption lines depends only on the relative intensity between the line and the continuum and should be unaffected by errors in absolute flux calibration .",
    "order 311 , which also includes the o  i line due to overlap in the echelle format , was extracted in the same way as were orders 309 and 310 for consistency , allowing us to verify that there was no significant difference between the manual and pipeline extraction procedures .",
    "table  2 lists the stis datasets used in this investigation and gives exposure times and details of the optical setup for each observation . the resolving power @xmath36 adopted for a given combination of grating and aperture",
    "was derived from the co spectral synthesis fits of sheffer et al .",
    "multiple exposures of a target acquired with the same echelle grating were coadded to improve the s / n ratio in the final spectrum .",
    "typical values of s / n for this sample are in the range 40@xmath980 ( per pixel ) , with values as low as 20 for the faintest stars or those with the shortest exposure times . for the bright per  ob2 stars ,",
    "the significantly longer exposure times result in s / n ratios in the range 100@xmath9300 .",
    "when a feature appeared in adjacent orders , these orders were combined as long as the overlapping portion of the spectrum had sufficient continua on both sides of the line .",
    "this was the case for most of the o  i and ga  ii lines in data obtained with the e140h grating ( resulting in an increase in s / n of almost 50% over cu  ii and b  ii from these data ) and for all of the b  ii lines with e140 m ( yielding a 35% increase in s / n ) .",
    "it should be noted that one of the most commonly used stis spectroscopic modes with e140h is the secondary mode at 1271  .",
    "hence , many of the observations yielding o  i , cu  ii , and b  ii spectra were acquired at this setting . however , since the spectral format at 1271  does not include the orders containing the ga  ii line ( orders 297 and 298 ) , obtaining data on this species requires observations using a different spectroscopic mode , which may be lacking . of the 56 sight lines in the stis sample ,",
    "11 do not have ga  ii data for this reason .",
    "final coadded spectra were normalized to the continuum by fitting low - order polynomials to regions free of interstellar absorption within a spectral window , usually 2   wide , centered on the line of interest .",
    "occasionally , a smaller portion of the spectrum surrounding the interstellar line was used in order to avoid a strong stellar absorption feature . for one star ( hd  108610 ) ,",
    "the task of distinguishing between stellar and interstellar absorption for the purpose of normalizing the continuum was deemed unfeasible .",
    "the uv spectrum of this b3 subgiant / dwarf has many narrow absorption lines uncharacteristic of an early - type star . because hd  108610 is the primary component in a double system , the observed features are likely due to contamination by the faint , late - type secondary . as a result of the large uncertainties in continuum placement ,",
    "this sight line was removed from the analysis of boron abundances .",
    "for all other sight lines , the uv spectra were normalized concurrently , taking care to separate weak interstellar components , often seen at large negative velocities , from noise in the continuum . to this end , we compared the various uv absorption profiles for a given sight line in velocity space to check for consistency .",
    "when ground - based data were available ( see  2.3 ) , they provided an additional means of determining the likelihood that a weak feature seen in the uv was a real interstellar absorption component . if a questionable feature is not seen in ca  ii or k  i absorption , it is likely to be an artifact of noise or of instrumental origin .",

    "finally , the calibrated spectra were shifted to the reference frame of the local standard of rest ( lsr ) .    before doppler correcting data obtained with the red setting , a template for telluric absorption was divided into each of the orders containing k  i. the template was derived by fitting the telluric lines in the spectrum of the standard star and then scaling the fit to the airmass of the observation being corrected . since each star was observed close to the meridian , the airmass varied only slightly from one observation to the next .",

    "in an effort to directly evaluate the presumed similarity among the different uv absorption profiles for a given line of sight , the apparent column density as a function of velocity , @xmath45 , was computed for each species ( see savage & sembach 1991 ) .",
    "briefly , when an absorption line is not fully resolved by the spectrograph , the true intensity profile is blurred by the instrumental line spread function and may differ significantly from the observed intensity , depending on the resolution .",

    "we can write the apparent optical depth in terms of the apparent column density , expressing both as functions of velocity ,    @xmath50    where @xmath51 is the oscillator strength and @xmath0 the rest wavelength of the transition . the constant in equation ( 1 ) is valid when @xmath0 is in  and @xmath45 is in units of @xmath52 ( km s@xmath53 .",
    "the total apparent column density can then be found by solving for @xmath45 and integrating over the entire line profile ,    @xmath54    equation ( 2 ) yields a lower limit to the true column density of the material when the absorption profile contains unresolved , optically thick components .",
    "however , if the absorption is optically thin , then @xmath55 and @xmath56 can be taken as a good approximation of the true column density .    in our analysis ,",
    "each of the normalized uv absorption profiles for a particular line of sight was integrated to obtain the apparent column density as well as the integrated equivalent width .",
    "the integration was performed with the interactive data language ( idl ) procedure inttabulated , which integrates tabulated data using a five - point newton - cotes formula .",
    "the limits of integration , where the optical depth goes to zero , were fixed by the o  i profile due to the strength of this line and its typically higher s / n ratio . the apparent optical depth ( hereafter aod )",
    "calculations provided useful consistency checks on the equivalent widths and column densities derived by other means ( see  3.2.3 for a comparison between apparent column densities and column densities derived through profile synthesis )",
    ". however , the primary motivation for performing these calculations was simply to compare the resulting apparent column density profiles to test for similarity among species . in general",
    ", the shapes of the o  i , cu  ii , ga  ii , and b  ii profiles are quite similar for a given line of sight ( see figues  2@xmath94 ) , validating the assumption that these species coexist .",
    "however , it is also evident that the relative strengths of certain groups , or complexes , of components are not always preserved from species to species ( see , e.g. , the apparent column density profiles toward hd  104705 and hd  114886 in figure  3 ) .",
    "integrated ( i.e. , line - of - sight ) column densities are inadequate for the purpose of studying changes in elemental abundance ratios from one absorption complex to another .",
    "for such an analysis , it is necessary to synthesize the observed component structure .",
    "synthetic absorption profiles were constructed and then fitted to the observed profiles using the rms - minimizing code ismod ( y. sheffer , unpublished ) , which assumes a voigt profile function for each absorption component comprising the fit .",
    "the voigt components are essentially gaussians in practice , because the absorption lines studied here are too weak for the radiatively damped wings to contribute significantly to the shape of the profile . in order to duplicate the broadening that results from the finite resolving power of the spectrograph",
    ", the synthetic spectra were convolved with an instrumental profile , represented by a gaussian with a width corresponding to the resolution of the data , before being fit to the observations .",
    "the profile synthesis routine treats the velocity @xmath43 , the doppler parameter @xmath57 , and the column density @xmath58 of each component as a free parameter , though the number of free parameters can be reduced in cases where the data are of lesser quality .",
    "the velocities and column densities were computed using atomic data ( i.e. , wavelengths and oscillator strengths ) from morton ( 2003 ) , which we list in table  4 for reference .    preliminary examination of the observed profiles within iraf provided the component structure that served as the initial input to the profile fitting routine .",
    "all of the uv spectra for a particular sight line were analyzed together to derive a consistent component decomposition across species .",
    "component results for different species were deemed to be consistent with each other if the derived velocities agreed to within approximately 1/3 of a resolution element .",
    "the measured line widths were also expected to be similar from one component to the next and from one species to another ( at least for the dominant ions ) . before accepting a particular decomposition ,",
    "the residual intensity was examined to ensure that it was indistinguishable from the noise in the continuum .",
    "we stress the importance of obtaining an accurate solution for the component structure along each line of sight .",
    "the overall weakness of the b  ii absorption line means that reliable b  ii column densities can not be obtained through direct synthesis of the absorption profiles due to the effects of noise in the spectra . in this investigation , as in our previous work ( federman et al .",
    "1996a , lambert et al . 1998 ) , column densities of b  ii are derived by fitting the absorption profiles with fixed templates of interstellar component structure constructed from the other observed species .",
    "thus , obtaining consistent component results is a crucial step in the analysis .",
    "once a preliminary component decomposition was obtained for a particular line of sight , the absorption profiles of o  i , cu  ii , and ga  ii were synthesized , allowing the initial input parameters to vary freely .",
    "the same initial component structure , usually that obtained from the o  i profile , was applied to all three lines .",
    "typically , multiple iterations were required to bring the component velocities for the different species into satisfactory agreement . in some cases , it was necessary to add or remove components from the fit or to hold the relative velocities , or , in rarer circumstances , the absolute velocities , fixed .",
    "additionally , the derived @xmath57-values were expected to fall within certain limits characteristic of dominant ion species ( i.e. , @xmath59 ; see pan et al .",
    "the majority of fits , especially of the higher resolution data , naturally yielded acceptable @xmath57-values .",
    "when the @xmath57-value for a particular component fell outside the expected range , a maximum or minimum value , either estimated directly from the data or determined from high - resolution ca  ii spectra , was strictly enforced by the fit .",
    "since restrictions on line width can affect the velocity at line center , both parameters must be considered with each iteration until a satisfactory solution is found yielding realistic @xmath57-values and consistent component velocities in each species .",
    "the general philosophy was to adopt the smallest number of components producing an acceptable fit .",
    "every effort was made to retain the maximum number of free parameters in the profile synthesis fits . in cases where this was not possible ,",
    "the restrictions placed on the fits were justified by the quality of the data . as an example , consider spectra obtained with the e140 m grating at a resolution of 7.9  km  s@xmath10 .",
    "essentially all galactic sight lines have multiple absorption components that can be separated by as little as a few km  s@xmath10 or less ( e.g. , welty & hobbs 2001 ) . in lower resolution data ,",
    "the presence of such components is often revealed by asymmetries in the absorption profiles .",
    "if accurate column densities are to be obtained , it is necessary to include each component .",
    "however , if an absorption component is defined by three parameters and there are three or four components that make up the profile , it is possible in e140 m data for there to be more free parameters in the fit than there are pixels sampling the profile .",
    "when this type of situation was encountered , the techniques described above effectively reduced the number of free parameters to an appropriate level so as to avoid overfitting the data . still , the @xmath57-values obtained from medium resolution spectra are not particularly well constrained , though this likely",
    "has minimal impact on the derived column densities because the lines are relatively weak and tend to lie on the linear portion of the curve of growth .",
    "after the o  i , cu  ii , and ga  ii syntheses were complete , the derived values of @xmath44 , @xmath58 , and @xmath57 for individual components ( see table  5 ) were used to create three profile templates , one from each species .",
    "the b  ii absorption profile was then fitted with each template , holding the relative velocities , the relative component strengths , and the @xmath57-values constant .",
    "the only free parameters in the b  ii fits were the absolute velocity of the template , which was allowed to shift to account for any small velocity offsets due to misaligned spectra , and the total column density . in some instances , when either a low s / n ratio or coarse resolution prevented a reliable determination of velocity , only the total column density was permitted to vary .",
    "if a sight line displayed multiple complexes of absorption components well separated in velocity , the various templates were created for each complex and fitted to that portion of the b  ii profile , independently . for most sight lines in this category , two groups of templates were sufficient to fit the b  ii profile .",
    "however , four lines of sight were found to exhibit distinct absorption from three separate cloud complexes .",
    "three of these ( hd  93205 , hd  93222 , and cpd@xmath959 2603 ) are toward stars in the carina nebula , and the fourth ( hd  1383 ) lies behind the perseus spiral arm .",
    "the absorption profiles toward hd  93222 are perhaps the most striking , with three clearly - defined groups of components almost completely resolved from one another ( see figure  4 ) . for this sight line ,",
    "b  ii column densities can confidently be derived for each distinct group , in contrast to the situation with the other sight lines , where not all of the individual absorption complexes are strongly detected in b  ii .      the ca  ii  k and k  i profiles acquired at mcdonald observatory were synthesized with ismod in a manner similar to that in which the o  i , cu  ii , and ga  ii data were analyzed .",
    "the component structure found from direct examination of the spectra within iraf again served as the initial input to the routine .",
    "however , the same structure was not applied to both profiles as it is recognized that ca  ii will have many more components than k  i and the k  i line widths will be , on average , somewhat narrower ( e.g. , welty et al .",
    "1996 ; welty & hobbs 2001 ; pan et al .",
    "2004 , 2005 ) .",
    "multiple iterations were performed until the syntheses met all of the usual criteria .",
    "that is , the fits were expected to yield not only consistent velocities for components common to both ca  ii and k  i , but also realistic @xmath57-values appropriate for the particular species . in practice , the k  i profiles were synthesized first because the s / n was higher and the narrow components were well resolved allowing accurate velocities to be determined .",
    "these velocities were then incorporated into fitting the more blended and more optically thick ca  ii profiles . since the exposures containing the ca  ii  k line also provided data on ca  i , ch@xmath27 , ch , and cn , these species were analyzed along with k  i and ca  ii , in an effort to further constrain the line - of - sight component structure .",
    "the weaker species can provide valuable information on the strongest k  i and ca  ii components ( see pan et al .",
    "2005 for a detailed discussion ) , though the usefulness of these lines in the present data is diminished due to the low s / n in exposures taken with the blue setup .",
    "ultimately , the k  i profiles themselves provided the most robust constraints on the cloud component structure .",
    "for each of the 24 sight lines that possessed the necessary measurements on ca  ii and k  i , a `` high - resolution '' template was created to be applied to the b  ii line .",
    "individual values of @xmath44 , @xmath58 , and @xmath57 came either from profile synthesis fits to mcdonald observations ( see table  6 ) , or from published values in literature studies of comparable quality ( i.e. , welty et al .",
    "1996 ; welty & hobbs 2001 ; sonnentrucker et al . 2003 ; pan et al . 2004 ; sonnentrucker et al .",
    "in general , velocities from k  i were chosen as the template velocities due to the precision with which these values can be determined .",
    "the @xmath57-values and relative column densities of the template components , however , were taken from the corresponding components in ca  ii , as this species is expected to track more closely the ( relative ) strengths and widths of absorption lines from dominant ions ( welty et al .",
    "the number of components in each template depended on the range of velocities spanned by the uv profiles . typically , all components seen in k  i were included , though , in rare cases , a minor component on the periphery of the k  i profile was removed .",
    "more commonly , it was necessary to add ca  ii components not detected in k  i in order to fill in extra absorption at the edges of the uv profiles .",
    "the high - resolution templates from visible data were fitted to the b  ii lines exactly as were the uv templates , applying separate template fits for profiles with multiple complexes of absorption components .",
    "in addition , the o  i , cu  ii , and ga  ii lines were fitted with the same high - resolution component structure to check the validity of the method .",
    "these fits showed some variation between the shape of the templates derived from visible data and the actual profiles of the stronger uv species , but the resulting total column densities were very similar to those based on direct profile synthesis .",
    "more aesthetically pleasing fits were obtained by allowing the @xmath57-values and column densities of the high - resolution components to vary while holding the relative velocities from the template fixed . here , the total column densities were virtually indistinguishable from those based on direct synthesis ( see table  7 ) , demonstrating that unresolved component structure has very little influence on the column densities derived from the lower resolution uv spectra .",
    "a sample of profile synthesis fits to the uv and visible data for nine sight lines is presented in figures  5@xmath913 .",
    "table  7 lists the total ( line - of - sight ) column densities of o  i , cu  ii , and ga  ii obtained by direct profile synthesis (   3.2.1 ) and by applying fixed velocity templates from visible data as described above . for these species ,",
    "the column densities resulting from direct profile synthesis are adopted for further analysis since there are a larger number of sight lines lacking visible data .",
    "uncertainties in @xmath58 for individual components were derived from the fitted line widths and the rms variations in the continuum .",
    "the individual uncertainties for all of the components in a given absorption profile were then summed in quadrature to yield the error in total column density .",
    "sight lines with two row entries in table  7 have data at both grating setups ( i.e. , e140 m and e140h ) . for each of these sight lines ,",
    "the total column densities obtained by synthesizing the medium - resolution and high - resolution profiles are found to agree within their mutual 1-@xmath34 uncertainties .",
    "we adopt the medium - resolution results here , because the e140h data either do not include the b  ii line or have lower s / n in the vicinity of b  ii compared to e140 m . adopting the e140 m results for all species in these instances ensures consistency when comparing different elemental abundances along a particular line of sight .",
    "the total b  ii column densities resulting from the various profile template fits are also given in table  7 .",
    "final values of @xmath58(b  ii ) were determined by taking the unweighted mean of the available results for a given sight line , since the uncertainties associated with each result are based simply on the noise characteristics in the spectrum ( along with the line widths and number of components in the profile template ) and are not related to any goodness - of - fit parameter . in every case ,",
    "the dispersion in the various determinations of @xmath58(b  ii ) is found to be less than the uncertainties in the individual results , with the average dispersion equal to 0.02  dex .",
    "none of the templates yield systematically higher or lower column densities compared to the mean value of @xmath58(b  ii ) for a specific line of sight , giving us confidence in our overall methodology . in the final analysis , the b  ii column densities that we obtain toward eight stars [ hd  108002 , hd  111934 , hd  124314 , hd  147683 , hd  195965 , hd  198478 ( 55  cyg ) , hd  210809 , and hd  212791 ] each have a statistical significance of less than 2  @xmath34 ( i.e. , @xmath58/@xmath60 ) .",
    "when discussing elemental abundances in  4.1 , the boron column densities in these directions are given as 3-@xmath34 upper limits .",
    "another ten sight lines have only tentative detections of the b  ii line , which result in column densities that are between 2 and 2.5 times the associated uncertainties .",
    "however , 37 sight lines from the stis sample exhibit b  ii absorption at the 2.5-@xmath34 level or better , and along eight of these [ hd  1383 , hd  23180 ( @xmath23  per ) , hd  24532 ( x  per ) , hd  43818 ( 11  gem ) , hd  93222 , hd  165955 , hd  177989 , and cpd@xmath959  2603 ] the b  ii line is detected with a significance of greater than 4.5  @xmath34 .        in figure  14 , we give a comparison between the final column densities derived through profile synthesis and those obtained by integrating the apparent column density profiles (  3.1 ) .",
    "the close correspondence between the results of the two methods is evident , even though the apparent column densities have not been corrected for any optical depth effects , confirming that the majority of lines are optically thin . for o  i , cu  ii , and ga  ii",
    ", virtually no data points lie below the `` line of equality '' , as expected if the apparent column density represents a lower limit to the true column density of the material . for b  ii , however , the points are more randomly distributed since the b  ii profiles are optically thin yet dominated by noise to a larger extent than are the other uv lines .",
    "the discrepant points at low column density correspond to the same group of sight lines in each panel ( i.e. , hd  36841 , hd  93237 , and hd  187311 ) .",
    "these are the only sight lines in the stis sample where the fits employed single absorption components for all species . in each discrepant case",
    ", it is the integration of the profile that fails because there are too few pixels sampling the line ( and the pixels sample only the core of the line and not the wings ) .",
    "the reliability of the profile synthesis fits should not be affected by these difficulties .",
    "table  8 presents the mean b  ii results for sight lines where separate templates were fit to distinct cloud complexes seen in the absorption profiles .",
    "the sight lines are divided into those that probe the perseus spiral arm and those that trace the sagittarius - carina spiral feature . unless otherwise noted , the velocity given for a particular absorption complex is the column density weighted mean lsr velocity in o  i for that group of components .",
    "we list 3-@xmath34 upper limits for any complexes with derived column densities below the 2-@xmath34 level . for hd  13268 and hd  13745 , the complexes at @xmath44  =  @xmath936 and @xmath942  km  s@xmath10 , respectively , which are seen in the other observed species and are presumably associated with gas in the perseus arm , could not be discerned in the b  ii profiles .",
    "thus , no fits were attempted for these features .",
    "similarly , the nominal fits to the absorption complexes at @xmath44  =  @xmath924 and @xmath938 km  s@xmath10 toward hd  116781 and hde  303308 , respectively , yielded column densities that were smaller than the uncertainties . in these latter two cases , it was clear that the fits did not go deep enough to match the observed flux level , a result of excessive noise in the spectra . in order to correct the total b  ii column densities along each of these sight lines , a constant @xmath58(b  ii)/@xmath58(o  i )",
    "ratio was assumed for the entire profile , consistent with the noise at the expected positions of the `` missing '' components .",
    "two sight lines in table  8 ( hd  1383 and cpd@xmath959  2603 ) have strong b  ii components without significant detections of o  i at similar velocities .",
    "the component at @xmath44  =  @xmath946 km  s@xmath10 toward cpd@xmath959  2603 traces the near side of the globally expanding h  ii region associated with the carina nebula ( see walborn et al .",
    "1998 , 2002 ) .",
    "the @xmath923 km  s@xmath10 component toward hd  1383 probably also arises in an h  ii region along the line of sight , considering that the strength of the component in the uv absorption profiles examined here decreases with the ionization potential of the species .    in the context of galactic differential rotation ,",
    "interstellar absorption detected near @xmath44  =  0  km  s@xmath10 can reliably be ascribed to the local ism in most cases ( excluding sight lines in the direction of the galactic center or anticenter ) , whereas absorption components with higher absolute velocities typically originate in more distant gas .",
    "each of the sight lines in table  8 tracing the sagittarius - carina spiral arm has an absorption complex near @xmath44  =  @xmath930 km s@xmath10 .",
    "the velocity of the feature is seen to increase roughly monotonically with increasing galactic longitude , from @xmath61 km  s@xmath10 at @xmath62 to @xmath918 km  s@xmath10 at @xmath63 .",
    "such systematic variation confirms that we are observing a coherent structure and is consistent with parcels of gas moving on circular orbits within a spiral arm .",
    "since each sight line also exhibits absorption near 0  km  s@xmath10 , it is possible to compare the elemental b / o ratios  log  @xmath58(b  ii )  @xmath9  log  @xmath58(o",

    "the mean value of log ( b / o ) for the detected sagittarius - carina arm components is @xmath64 , while the average for local gas along the same lines of sight is @xmath65 .",
    "we therefore find suggestive evidence that the b / o ratio is higher ( by @xmath66 dex ) in the inner sagittarius - carina spiral arm than it is in the vicinity of the sun , though the scatter in the measurements , particularly for the spiral arm components , precludes a definitive interpretation of the results .",
    "if confirmed , however , an elevated b / o ratio in the inner galaxy would seem to indicate that boron is currently produced as a secondary element .",
    "the abundances of secondary elements increase relative to those of primary ones with decreasing galactocentric radius due to the enhanced rates of star formation and stellar nucleosynthesis in the inner disk . a secondary behavior for boron",
    "would then cast doubt on the efficiency of the @xmath11-process as this is a primary production mechanism .    considering the implications of this finding",
    ", it would be useful to compare the mean b / o ratios given above with a similar mean for gas in the perseus spiral arm , since this structure contains clouds at larger galactocentric radii .",
    "absorption from the perseus arm is found near @xmath44  =  @xmath940 km",
    "s@xmath10 along each of the sight lines in table  8 sampling this structure .",
    "unfortunately , the data yield only upper limits on the b  ii column densities for these absorption complexes .",
    "there are , of course , other effects that can lead to variations in b / o among different absorption complexes along a given line of sight , such as differential ionization and grain destruction .",
    "in fact , howk et al . ( 2000 ) interpreted the uv absorption profiles toward hd  104705 as showing increased boron depletion in cold clouds ( the narrow complex near @xmath44  =  0  km  s@xmath10 ) relative to warmer diffuse gas ( the complex centered at @xmath44  =  @xmath925  km  s@xmath10 ) .",
    "however , it is unclear how such an effect would lead to a systematic increase in the b / o ratio for components associated with the sagittarius - carina spiral arm",

    "the connection between @xmath79 and depletion was interpreted by jenkins et al .",
    "( 1986 ) within the framework of the spitzer ( 1985 ) model of an idealized neutral ism .",
    "according to this model , three different types of neutral atomic gas ( i.e. , warm low - density gas , cold diffuse clouds , and cold dense clouds ) may contribute to the depletion seen along a given interstellar sight line .",
    "the warm and cold phases will each exhibit a characteristic level of depletion , where the specific levels will vary for different elements . for most elements ,",
    "the cold phase will be associated with a stronger depletion signature .",
    "thus , the overall level of depletion will depend on the exact mixture of warm and cold neutral material along the line of sight , which , in this framework , is parameterized by the average sight - line density of hydrogen .",
    "the typical behavior can be seen in figure  15 , where we plot the gas - phase elemental abundances of o , b , ga , and cu against @xmath79 .",
    "the panels for the different elements are shown from top to bottom in order of increasing condensation temperature , @xmath83 , defined as the temperature at which 50% of the element has condensed from the gas phase ( see table  13 for the adopted values from lodders 2003 ) .",
    "two effects are readily discernible in the figure .",
    "first , a pattern of density - dependent depletion is evident in the case of each element .",
    "the abundances are seen to vary between the warm - gas value ( represented by the solid line in each panel ) at low @xmath79 and the cold - cloud value ( the dashed line ) at the highest @xmath79 .",
    "the trend is more clearly delineated when the observational data are binned by average density ( figure  16 ) .",
    "second , the depletion in the lowest density gas is found to increase with @xmath83 , consistent with the idea that the atoms are condensing onto interstellar grains .",
    "our analysis of these effects differs from previous investigations ( i.e. , jenkins et al . 1986 ; cartledge et al .",
    "2004 , 2006 ) in that we do not assume a functional form for the dependence of sight - line depletion on @xmath79 .",
    "the mean abundances , and hence depletions , in the warm and cold phases ( table  13 ) were determined for each element by averaging all of the line - of - sight abundances within the appropriate density regimes .",
    "no weights were applied in averaging , since the errors in individual abundance measurements are based on the s / n values in the spectra and are not related to how closely a given measurement represents the `` true '' abundance for that density regime .",
    "this allows for the possibility that certain sight lines will exhibit enhanced abundances .",
    "the warm - gas values include all sight lines with @xmath79  @xmath84  0.14  @xmath85 ( log  @xmath79  @xmath84  @xmath90.85 ) , while the cold - cloud averages are obtained from sight lines with @xmath79  @xmath86  1.4  @xmath85 ( log  @xmath79  @xmath86  0.15 ) .",
    "although these threshold densities were somewhat subjectively determined , we note that our value for the warm gas threshold is identical to the `` smoothed '' density of warm gas adopted by spitzer ( 1985 ) .",
    "the high density threshold was essentially set so as to include the per  ob2 stars in the averages for cold clouds ( with the exception of @xmath23  per , which has a slightly lower value of @xmath79 ) .",
    "these stars have the lowest interstellar boron abundances in the stis sample , and sight lines toward per  ob2 are known to harbor relatively dense gas .",
    "altering these critical densities within acceptable limits would modify the derived mean abundances by less than 0.03 dex . in calculating the various mean values , we used all available sight lines with stis or ghrs abundance measurements for the elements of interest",
    ". thus , the means for oxygen , gallium , and copper include abundances taken from the literature ( hobbs et al .",

    "the depletion levels are based on the recommended solar abundances from lodders ( 2003 ) .",
    "quoted errors in mean abundance are 1-@xmath34 standard deviations for each group .",
    "our results on oxygen and copper depletions can be directly compared with those obtained by cartledge et al .",

    "they report the scatter in their o and cu abundances ( with respect to the function they fit to the data ) as being 0.09 and 0.13 dex , respectively .",
    "thus , while cartledge et al .",
    "find slightly more depletion in each case , their results are consistent , considering the uncertainties , with the results of our more simplified approach ( table  13 ) . in figure  16",
    ", we demonstrate that the general trend of decreasing gas - phase elemental abundance with increasing average sight - line density can be elucidated without adopting an arbitrary fitting function .",
    "this figure was created by calculating mean abundances in successive density bins , thereby removing the bulk of the scatter due to observational uncertainties ( as well as any intrinsic abundance variations ) and revealing the underlying trend . in each panel of figure  16",
    ", the binned data are found to exhibit a smooth transition between the warm - gas and cold - cloud levels , except , perhaps , in the case of gallium .",
    "the mean gallium abundances appear to flatten out at intermediate densities , although the difference here may simply reflect the small sample size and the fact that the data are somewhat irregularly distributed with respect to @xmath79 .",
    "in contrast , the trend for the mean boron abundance shows very little scatter , despite the sample size being the smallest in this case",
    ". this particular plot will be useful for determining the degree to which any individual sight line possesses an elevated abundance of boron , as the individual abundance will need to be compared to the mean appropriate for the specific value of @xmath79 associated with the line of sight .        in figure  17",
    ", we present a comparison of the trends seen in the b / h and b / o ratios when the data are plotted against various measures of gas density . on the left - hand side of the figure , in particular ,",
    "the b / h and b / o ratios are both plotted against @xmath79 .",
    "again , since we are attempting to identify sight lines that show evidence of recent boron production , we will need to ensure that an elevated b / h ( or b / o ) ratio is not caused by a spurious hydrogen ( or oxygen ) measurement .",
    "there is minimal variation between the two trends , however , since the o / h ratios are relatively constant with line - of - sight density .",
    "naturally , the distinction between the warm and cold - phase depletion levels is less pronounced in b / o than it is in b / h due to the slight enhancement in oxygen depletion at high densities .",
    "the scatter in the b / o versus @xmath79 relation is also marginally higher ( by 0.02 dex ) than the relation in b / h , although this likely results from the fact that b / h and @xmath79 are not completely independent parameters , given that both depend on @xmath74(h ) . when b / o is plotted instead of b / h , a small amount of additional scatter is contributed by the measurement uncertainties ( and/or intrinsic variations ) in the o  i column densities .",
    "the other readily available measure of gas density is the molecular hydrogen fraction , @xmath51(h@xmath33 ) , which should reflect the local conditions in the absorbing clouds more directly than @xmath79 , yet has typically been found to yield a poorer correlation with various gas - phase elemental abundances .",
    "this must partly be related to the fact that the fractional abundance of h@xmath33 is not solely determined by the local density , but is also influenced by factors such as the intensity of the ambient uv radiation field , which is responsible for dissociating the h@xmath33 molecule . by this reasoning , the molecular fraction will perform poorly as an indicator of density , and thus of depletion , if the interstellar material lies in close proximity to a strong source ( or strong sources ) of uv radiation , like the hot stars of an ob association , unless the h@xmath33 column density is large enough for the molecule to be self shielded .",
    "the upper right panel of figure  17 gives the plot of gas - phase boron abundance versus @xmath51(h@xmath33 ) , where the overall increase in scatter over the relation with @xmath79 is apparent .",
    "still , the molecular fraction does reasonably well at predicting whether a particular sight line will exhibit enhanced depletion .",
    "for instance , the most molecule - poor sight line in the stis sample ( hd 165955 ) has a boron abundance that is remarkably consistent with the warm gas average , indicating that the b / h ratio remains fairly constant over three orders of magnitude in @xmath51(h@xmath33 ) .",
    "this is followed by a sharp decline in b / h for values of log @xmath51(h@xmath33 ) greater than @xmath91.0 . as would be expected , the sight lines with the lowest gas - phase boron abundances are also the most molecule rich .",
    "these are the sight lines to stars in per  ob2 ( 40  per , @xmath23  per , @xmath25  per , and x  per ) , cep  ob2 ( hd  207308 and hd  207538 ) , and sco  ob2 ( @xmath25  oph ) , which are all regions shaped by the formation and evolution of massive stars .",
    "detailed abundance measurements in such environments have the potential to offer unique insight into the mechanisms responsible for boron production . unfortunately , any boron enhancements in these directions will be difficult to discern due to the heavy depletion in the relatively dense gas .    since interstellar grains are presumed to provide the surface upon which the atoms from the gas are depleted",
    ", one would expect to see a connection between enhanced depletion and high dust content . to seek such a correlation , we converted each of the values of @xmath88(@xmath89 ) in table  1 into a reddening `` density '' by multiplying by the mean ratio of total hydrogen column density to color excess , @xmath90(h)/@xmath91  @xmath52  mag@xmath10 ( bohlin et al .",
    "1978 ) , and dividing by the distance @xmath80 .",
    "the resulting parameter , which we denote as @xmath92 , is essentially just the reddening normalized by the pathlength and scaled to have units similar to @xmath79 .",
    "the trend of b / o versus reddening density ( lower right panel of figure  17 ) bears a marked resemblance to that of b / o versus line - of - sight hydrogen density ( lower left panel ) , undoubtedly a result of the known close correspondence between @xmath88(@xmath89 ) and @xmath74(h ) ( see bohlin et al . 1978 ) .",
    "other investigations that have explored possible correlations between depletion and some normalized reddening parameter ( e.g. , cartledge et al .",
    "2006 , jensen & snow 2007a , 2007b ) have yielded similar findings .",
    "the advantage in our case is that the plot of b / o versus @xmath92 includes all of the sight lines in the boron sample , including those that lack determinations of total hydrogen column density , with two exceptions .",
    "it is difficult to estimate a @xmath89 color excess for the stars hd  203338 and @xmath6  sco  b , since both have rather poorly - determined photometric parameters ( the former has a composite spectral type and the latter is a faint companion to the red supergiant star antares ) . for another star ( hd  212791 ) , the values of @xmath88(@xmath89 ) and @xmath74(h )",
    "were found to lie significantly outside the mean relation .",
    "the reddening in this direction ( 0.05 mag ) implies a total hydrogen column density of log  @xmath74(h ) = 20.46 , whereas the observed value is larger by 0.76 dex ( a factor of six ) .",
    "since hd  212791 is a known be - type star , the interstellar reddening value is almost certainly the cause of the discrepancy . a more appropriate value , based on the observed @xmath74(h ) ,",
    "would be 0.29 mag , although this revised value is not adopted in the derivation of @xmath92 .",
    "the boron measurement in this direction is only an upper limit , so the discrepant hydrogen and reddening parameters will have little impact on the interpretation of the trends in figure  17 .",
    "the b / o ratios for two sight lines in the plot versus reddening density are substantially elevated above the mean appropriate for warm neutral gas .",
    "the anomalous ratios are found in the directions of hd  156110 and hd  187311 , both of which are high galactic latitude halo stars , at distances of 420  pc above and 3500  pc below the galactic plane , respectively .",
    "these two stars are also the least reddened in the boron sample .",
    "if low reddening implies low dust content , it might be tempting to assume that these sight lines probe essentially undepleted gas .",
    "indeed , the gas - phase b / o ratios in these directions are consistent with the solar value . however , since halo sight lines often trace regions of high ionization ( e.g. , spitzer & fitzpatrick 1992 ) , the elevated b  ii / o  i ratios may instead indicate that the absorption from dominant ions along these lines of sight actually arises in partially ionized regions of space .",
    "it is possible to test this idea by searching for ions that , at their next lower ionization stage , have an ip between that of o  i and b  ii , such as fe  iii or al  iii .",
    "while no al  iii data exist for either of the sight lines in question , the fe  iii  @xmath01122 line is available from _ fuse _ spectra .",
    "interestingly , the fe  iii line does appear to be stronger , relative to the nearby fe  ii  @xmath01121 line , toward hd  156110 and hd  187311 than it is toward hd  121968 , another high galactic latitude halo star with low reddening but without an usually high interstellar b  ii / o  i ratio .",
    "some combination of increased ionization and reduced depletion must be responsible for the elevated b / o ratios seen along the rarefied paths to hd  156110 and hd  187311 , as these are not regions expected to have boron abundances enhanced by nucleosynthetic processes .",
    "an ideal approach to determining the relative contribution of each spallation channel to boron nucleosynthesis would be to obtain precise interstellar @xmath2b/@xmath3b ratios in a diverse selection of galactic environments , representing both the ambient ism as well as regions where type ii supernovae have occurred ( e.g. , in supernova remnants or in superbubbles ) .",
    "since supernovae are presumably the sources responsible for the acceleration of galactic cosmic rays and are also sites of the @xmath11-process , enhancements in one or both of the boron isotopes are anticipated in their environs . if neutrino spallation contributes significantly to @xmath2b production , then the @xmath2b/@xmath3b ratio in the ejecta of a core - collapse supernova should vastly exceed the ambient value .",
    "the @xmath11-process yields from a 25  @xmath93 progenitor of solar metallicity , for example , result in a ratio of @xmath2b/@xmath3b = 587 ( model s25a ; ww95 ) .",
    "of course , this @xmath2b - rich material will be diluted somewhat when the ejecta mixes with the surrounding interstellar gas , although an enhancement should still be discernible . in the case of cosmic - ray spallation ,",
    "the relative isotopic enhancement will depend on the energy spectrum of the accelerated particles .",
    "a @xmath2b/@xmath3b ratio near the meteoritic value ( or slightly higher ) is predicted if supernovae can efficiently accelerate particles at low energies ( e.g. , meneguzzi & reeves 1975 ; parizot & reeves 2001 ) .",
    "otherwise , the pure gcr spallation value ( i.e. , @xmath2b/@xmath3b = 2.4 ; mar ) would be expected .",
    "while the present sample of interstellar sight lines is diverse enough for such an investigation , the component structure toward most of the stis targets is too complicated ( and the stis data have insufficient s / n ) to allow any meaningful determinations of @xmath2b/@xmath3b .",
    "nevertheless , since any recent boron production ( in the vicinity of sne ii , for instance ) should manifest itself as a local enhancement in the total boron abundance , the large database of abundances presented here can still potentially yield clues to boron nucleosynthesis . in this section ,",
    "the interstellar boron abundances are examined in detail to isolate any intrinsic variations superimposed on the general trend due to depletion .    as a first cut in identifying sight lines with enhanced boron abundances , we consider the upper envelopes of the distributions of b / h and b / o with @xmath79 . requiring an enhancement ( i.e. , a significant increase over the mean ) in both abundance parameters , in order to exclude cases where an anomalously low oxygen or hydrogen measurement appears as a boron enhancement , results in the following list of sight lines ( in order of increasing @xmath79 ) : hd  165955 , hd  93222 , hd  1383 , hd  114886 , hd  208947 , hd  148937 , hd  43818 , hd  203374 , and hd  99872 . for both hd  1383 and hd  99872",
    ", however , the apparent enhancement in boron is more likely a result of differential ionization rather than an indication of recent nucleosynthesis . considering that the profile synthesis for hd  1383 required fitting a b  ii component not detected in o  i",

    "the ga / h and cu / h ratios are elevated along with b / h , but the o / h ratio is normal for a sight line at high @xmath79 .",
    "this strongly suggests that the line of sight to hd  99872 traces partially - ionized gas , in which both neutral hydrogen and neutral oxygen have been preferentially destroyed , but cu@xmath27 , ga@xmath27 , and b@xmath27 remain due to their larger ionization potentials .",
    "it might also be appropriate to reject hd  165955 as exhibiting a boron enhancement , since the very low value of @xmath51(h@xmath33 ) along this line of sight would group it among the low - depletion sight lines and both b / h and b / o are consistent with the warm - gas averages .",
    "( the discrepancy is that the value of @xmath79 for hd  165955 implies a higher degree of depletion , making the b / h and b / o ratios appear to be elevated . )    the remaining six sight lines with suggestively enhanced interstellar boron abundances constitute a sample that warrants further investigation .",

    "however , the equivalent width can be reduced by almost 40% with an alternate continuum fit , somewhat outside the 1-@xmath34 error .",
    "if such reductions were adopted , an enhanced boron abundance would still be inferred for hd  148937 , though an enhancement toward hd  114886 would no longer seem likely .",

    "the average uncertainty in log(b / h ) for the boron sample is 0.13 dex , whereas the average dispersion in these abundances for a particular value of @xmath79 is 0.17 dex ( see figure 16 ) , implying that some degree of intrinsic variability is present .",
    "a portion of the excess scatter may be related to the @xmath79 parameter itself , since a variety of actual physical conditions can result in a single value of @xmath79 , owing to differences in how the gas is distributed along the line of sight . moreover ,",

    "1990 ; timmes et al .",
    "1995 ) , yet is not made in substantial quantities by cosmic rays .",
    "the supernova yields from model s25a in ww95 , which include @xmath11-process contributions , result in an elemental abundance ratio of f / b  =  42 , similar to the solar system ratio of 48 ( lodders 2003 ) . since a much larger value",
    "would be anticipated without the @xmath11-process , the f / b ratio becomes an important diagnostic of neutrino - induced spallation .",
    "fluorine abundances in diffuse clouds are obtained from the f  i line at 954   , which is accessible from _ fuse _ spectra . however , absorption from h@xmath33 is also present near 954   and must be modeled and then removed if accurate fluorine abundances are to be determined .",
    "federman et al .",
    "( 2005 ) set an upper limit on the column density of h@xmath33 that would allow a reliable measurement of the f  i line [ log  @xmath58(h@xmath33 )  @xmath121  20.5 ] .",
    "unfortunately , nearly half of the sight lines in the boron sample for which @xmath58(h@xmath33 ) has been determined have h@xmath33 column densities at or above this limit , making a general study of interstellar fluorine impossible for this sample .",
    "nevertheless , literature results from secure detections of f  i are available for three of our sight lines .",
    "the f  i column densities toward hd  177989 [ log  @xmath58(f  i )  =  13.49@xmath128 ; snow et al .",
    "2007 ] , hd  209339 [ log  @xmath58(f  i )  =  13.46@xmath129 ; federman et al . 2005 ] , and @xmath19  sco [ log  @xmath58(f  i )  =  13.22@xmath130 ; snow & york 1981 ; corrected using the morton 2003 @xmath51-value ] yield respective f / b ratios of @xmath131 , @xmath132 , and @xmath133 .",
    "all of these ratios are larger than that predicted by neutrino spallation , although the uncertainties are not inconsiderable and boron is expected to be more heavily depleted than fluorine ( which has @xmath83  =  734  k ; lodders 2003 ) .",
    "the depletion corrections will vary for these three sight lines because each lies in a different density regime : hd  177989 ( in the low halo ) is one of the low - depletion sight lines tracing mostly warm gas , the sight line to @xmath19  sco presumably samples colder gas that should be characterized by relatively high depletion , and the gas toward hd  209339 should exhibit an intermediate degree of depletion between the warm - gas and cold - cloud levels .",
    "still , the relative depletion corrections between fluorine and boron should be roughly the same for the different regimes . in the snow et al .",
    "( 2007 ) sample , fluorine is essentially undepleted along lines of sight with the lowest values of @xmath79 , while boron exhibits a depletion of @xmath90.4  dex in low - density , warm gas ( see table  13 ) . if this difference in depletion persists for sight lines in the higher - density regimes , then",
    "each of the f / b ratios should be reduced by 60% ( i.e. , f / b  =  @xmath134 , @xmath135 , and @xmath136 toward hd  177989 , hd  209339 , and @xmath19  sco , respectively ) .",
    "thus , even with a plausible correction for depletion , the ratios are higher than that expected from neutrino spallation .",
    "the result for the line of sight to hd  209339 , which has the largest f / b ratio of the three , is particularly significant because this star , as a member of cep ob2 , is known to have formed in an expanding shell of gas created by sne  ii ( patel et al .",
    "1998 ) . yet",
    "no evidence is found that the @xmath11-process has operated in the clouds in this direction .",
    "we do find evidence for an enhanced boron abundance toward hd  203374 , a nearby member of the association .",
    "however , while this enhancement could be attributed to neutrino production , it might instead reflect the recent acceleration of cosmic rays from the surrounding star - forming regions associated with the cepheus bubble .",
    "unfortunately , the column density of h@xmath33 toward hd  203374 [ log  @xmath58(h@xmath33 )  =  20.70 ] will make any detection of f  i extremely difficult for this sight line , meaning that the f / b ratio will not be available to differentiate the two scenarios .    in the absence of convincing evidence for the @xmath11-process in cep ob2 and with the possible detection of elevated b",
    "/ o ratios in the sagittarius - carina spiral arm , a picture of light element nucleosynthesis begins to emerge .",
    "the stellar abundance results demonstrate that a mixture of primary and secondary processes are needed to explain the observed trends of boron and beryllium versus oxygen . for beryllium ,",
    "the most metal - poor stars suggest a purely primary mechanism dominated light element production in the early galaxy ( rich & boesgaard 2009 ) .",
    "this mechanism almost certainly was the acceleration of cno nuclei by sne  ii because be is not produced by the @xmath11-process .",
    "if this mechanism operated at early times , it likely is still at work today , though gcr spallation now dominates light element nucleosynthesis , giving rise to the observed slope of 1.5 in the logarithmic boron versus oxygen relation .",
    "the remaining problem is the @xmath2b/@xmath3b ratio in the local solar neighborhood .",
    "the ratios measured in interstellar clouds ( federman et al . 1996a ; lambert et al .",
    "1998 ) and those determined for early b stars ( see proffitt et al .",
    "1999 ) are all consistent with the meteoritic value of 4.0 .",
    "while not much is known about the ratio beyond the solar neighborhood , because all of the existing measurements were made within 250  pc of the sun , a satisfactory explanation of the meteoritic ratio has not yet emerged .",
    "if the @xmath11-process contribution to @xmath2b synthesis is minimal , because a secondary process is required in the current epoch , the only remaining mechanism is an increased flux of low - energy galactic cosmic rays , as originally proposed by mar .",
    "interestingly , some support for this mechanism comes from recent observations of h@xmath109 , which is a sensitive probe of the cosmic - ray ionization rate of molecular hydrogen ( indriolo et al .",
    "2007 , 2009 ) . in order to match the ionization rate inferred from their observations of h@xmath109 , indriolo et al .",
    "( 2009 ) had to adopt a cosmic - ray energy spectrum enhanced at low energies , a natural consequence of which is the preferrential synthesis of @xmath2b over @xmath3b due to the lower thresholds for reactions leading to the former nuclide .",
    "the physical motivation for a low - energy cosmic - ray component comes from the recognition that some particles will be accelerated by weak shocks associated with star - forming regions , ob associations , and even the astrospheres of low mass stars ( scherer et al .",
    "2008 ) , which are ubiquitous throughout the galaxy .",
    "archival stis spectra sampling diffuse interstellar gas along over 50 galactic sight lines were analyzed to obtain column densities of b  ii , and , in the process , o  i , cu  ii , and ga  ii . before synthesizing the b  ii absorption profile along a given line of sight ,",
    "a consistent component decomposition was derived in the stronger uv lines .",
    "the component structure for many of these sight lines is confirmed through the analysis of high resolution ca  ii and k  i profiles .",
    "both uv and visible data were used to construct profile templates that were fit to the b  ii line , yielding the total column density along the line of sight . for sight lines with multiple complexes of absorption components , separate templates were fit to each complex , independently .",
    "this procedure allowed the detection of a slight increase in the boron - to - oxygen ratio in the inner sagittarius - carina spiral arm , a result which may indicate that boron production in the current epoch is dominated by a secondary process .",
    "elemental abundances in the gas phase were determined for each of the uv species and were compared with line - of - sight measures of gas density to quantify the effects of depletion onto interstellar grains .",
    "the depletion in each element was found to increase with the average density of hydrogen , which characterizes the overall concentration of cold clouds relative to warm gas along the line of sight .",
    "mean abundances were determined for the warm and cold phases of the diffuse ism and the level of depletion in warm gas was shown to increase with the condensation temperature of the element .",
    "the gas - phase abundance of boron in the warm diffuse ism was found to be b / h = @xmath1 , which translates into a depletion of 60% relative to the meteoritic boron abundance .",
    "knowledge of the trend of decreasing elemental abundance with increasing gas density allowed the identification of sight lines showing enhanced boron abundances .",
    "many of these sight lines ( e.g. , hd  93222 , hd  114886 , hd  208947 , hd  148937 , hd  43818 , and hd  203374 ) are near regions of massive star formation , and therefore ( at least some of them ) may be probing the recent production of @xmath2b , resulting from spallation reactions induced by either cosmic rays or neutrinos . further detailed analysis is needed to determine conclusively the degree of ionization and depletion in the gas in these directions .",
    "observations of other light elements will also be required to disentagle the relative contributions from the two spallation channels , if recent nucleosynthesis can be confirmed .",
    "as with the majority of sight lines in our survey , the complicated component structure in most of the directions showing boron enhancements will not permit any meaningful determinations of the @xmath2b/@xmath3b ratio .",
    "additional measurements on interstellar fluorine may help to clarify the situation if abundances can be obtained for a larger number of sight lines from the boron sample .",
    "the elemental f / b ratio is expected to be an important tracer of neutrino spallation , a process for which direct observational evidence is still lacking . from a limited sample ,",
    "we find no indication that the @xmath11-process has operated in the cepheus bubble ( as probed by the line of sight to hd  209339 ) , though this region is known to have been shaped by core - collapse supernovae in the recent past .",
    "future searches for observational signatures of light element production in the galaxy should focus on specific regions where active nucleosynthesis is likely to be occurring . among the more promising candidates are the interstellar clouds in the vicinity of the interacting supernova remnant ic  443 and those near the massive star - forming region ic  348",
    ". observations of li  i along lines of sight through the supernova remnant are currently being analyzed and similar data exist on li  i toward members of ic 348 .",
    "complementary observations of b  ii toward stars in both of these regions should now be acquired so that a more complete picture of light element synthesis can be obtained .",
    "such observations have recently become feasible with the installation of the cosmic origins spectrograph ( cos ) on _ hst_. in conjunction with future studies in the galactic ism , it will be important to expand the investigation of interstellar boron to the large and small magellanic clouds .",
    "interstellar lithium has very recently been detected in the small magellanic cloud ( howk 2010 ) and boron could likely be discovered there with cos or even stis , now that it has been refurbished .",
    "the magellanic clouds present a unique opportunity to study light element nucleosynthesis in metal - poor environments with regions of active star formation , providing suitable analogs of our own galaxy at earlier times",
    ". a similarly important discovery will be the eventual detection of beryllium in interstellar space , as the sole stable isotope of beryllium ( @xmath5be ) can be produced only through cosmic - ray spallation . while existing searches for be  ii",
    "have mainly focused on bright interstellar targets like @xmath25  per , @xmath25  oph , and @xmath19  sco ( see hbrard et al .",
    "1997 ) , beryllium will be more heavily depleted in these directions if it follows a trend similar to that found for boron .",
    "absorption from be  ii should be sought in more diffuse directions where less depletion is expected , though even in favorable conditions the equivalent widths will likely be less than @xmath137 m . still , with sufficiently long exposure times",
    ", a detection should be possible considering the capabilities of modern large aperture telescopes .",
    "the near future promises considerable advancements in the field of cosmochemistry .",
    "for instance , actual measurements of the flux of low - energy cosmic rays , needed for accurate predictions of light element synthesis via cosmic - ray spallation , are on the horizon .",
    "the _ voyager 1 _ and _ 2 _ spacecraft , which recently crossed the solar wind termination shock , may be able to measure the flux of cosmic rays at energies below 1 gev nucleon@xmath10 when they reach the heliopause in the coming decades . these measurements could help answer exciting new questions about whether anomalous cosmic rays accelerated in astrospheres throughout the galaxy contribute significantly to the gcr flux at low energies , an outcome with direct implications for light element nucleosynthesis .",
    "the comprehensive survey of interstellar boron presented here , when combined with future studies of light element abundances and isotopic ratios , an improved treatment of interstellar depletion , and a direct determination of the flux of low - energy cosmic rays , will ultimately lead to a deeper understanding of the mechanisms responsible for the production of the light elements .",

    "<S> we present a comprehensive survey of boron abundances in diffuse interstellar clouds from observations made with the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) of the _ hubble space telescope_. our sample of 56 galactic sight lines is the result of a complete search of archival stis data for the b  ii @xmath01362 resonance line , with each detection confirmed by the presence of absorption from o  i  @xmath01355 , cu  ii  @xmath01358 , and ga  ii  @xmath01414 ( when available ) at the same velocity . five previous measurements of interstellar b  ii from goddard high resolution spectrograph observations are incorporated in our analysis , yielding a combined sample that more than quadruples the number of sight lines with significant boron detections . </S>",
    "<S> our survey also constitutes the first extensive analysis of interstellar gallium from stis spectra and expands on previously published results for oxygen and copper . </S>",
    "<S> the observations probe both high and low - density diffuse environments , allowing the density - dependent effects of interstellar depletion to be clearly identified in the gas - phase abundance data for each element . in the case of boron , </S>",
    "<S> the increase in relative depletion with line - of - sight density amounts to an abundance difference of 0.8  dex between the warm and cold phases of the diffuse interstellar medium . </S>",
    "<S> the abundance of boron in warm , low - density gas is found to be b / h  =  @xmath1 , which represents a depletion of 60% relative to the meteoritic boron abundance . beyond the effects of depletion , our survey reveals sight lines with enhanced boron abundances that potentially trace the recent production of @xmath2b , resulting from spallation reactions involving either cosmic rays or neutrinos . </S>",
    "<S> future observations will help to disentangle the relative contributions from the two spallation channels for @xmath2b synthesis . </S>"
