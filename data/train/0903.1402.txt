    "the inverse problem for the multidimensional schrdinger operator @xmath6 for the first time is investigated by eskin , g. , ralston , j. , trubowitz , e. in the papers [ 2,3 ] . in [ 2 ] it is proved the following result :    _ assume that the lattice _ @xmath0 _ of _ @xmath60 _ is such that , for _",

    "in the paper [ 11 ] we constructed a set @xmath86  of trigonometric polynomials of the form @xmath87 where @xmath88 is a subset of the lattice @xmath89 satisfying the following conditions :    @xmath90 for @xmath91 and    @xmath92 for @xmath93 where@xmath94 and @xmath95 , @xmath96 , @xmath97 are large prime numbers satisfying @xmath98 .",

    "thus , in the papers [ 2 - 4 ] and in our papers ( in [ 11 ] and in this paper ) the different aspects of the inverse problem are investigated by absolutely different methods .",
    "it follows from ( 3 ) and from the conditions on ( 9 ) that the intersection of the set of potentials investigated in [ 11 ] and in this paper is empty set . in this paper and in [ 11 ]",
    "we determine constructively the potential @xmath41 of the three - dimensional schrdinger operator @xmath6 from the spectral invariants that were determined constructively in [ 10 ] from the given band functions . as a result , we determine constructively the potential from the given band functions .",
    "actually , we do not only show how to construct a periodic potential @xmath41 with the desired properties but even present an algorithm for the construction .",
    "moreover , in this paper we investigate the stability of the algorithm and prove some uniqueness theorems which were not done in [ 11 ] .    to describe the brief scheme of this paper , we begin by recalling the definition of some well - known concepts and the invariants obtained in [ 10 ] that will be used here .",

    "we prove that every element @xmath101 of @xmath107 is a visible element of @xmath14 and the directional potential ( 11 ) of ( 3 ) has the form @xmath108 let @xmath101 be a visible element of @xmath109 @xmath110 be the sublattice @xmath111 of @xmath0 in the hyperplane @xmath112 and@xmath113 be the lattice dual to @xmath114 let @xmath115 be a visible element of @xmath116 and @xmath117 be the plane containing @xmath101 , @xmath115 and the origin . define a function @xmath118 by @xmath119 in the paper [ 10 ] we constructively determined the following spectral invariants @xmath120@xmath121 from the asymptotic formulas for the band functions of @xmath6 obtained in [ 8,9 ] , where @xmath106 is the directional potential ( 11 ) .",
    "moreover , in [ 10 ] we constructively determined the invariant @xmath122 when @xmath106 has the form ( 12 ) . since all the directional potential of",
    "( 3 ) have the form ( 12 ) ( see proposition 1 ) , we have the invariants ( 15)-(17 ) for all @xmath123    in section 2 we describe the invariants ( 15)-(17 ) for ( 3 ) .    in section 3 fixing the inversion and translations ( 2 ) , we give an algorithm for the unique determination of the potential @xmath41 of the three - dimensional schrdinger operator @xmath6 from the invariants ( 15)-(17 ) .",
    "since the invariants ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) do not exist in the case @xmath124 we do not use the investigations of the inverse problem for the one dimensional schrdinger operator @xmath44 .",
    "for this reason , we do not discuss a great number of papers about the inverse problem of the hill operator .    in section 4 we study the stability of the algorithm with respect to errors both in the invariants ( 15)-(17 ) and in the bloch eigenvalues .",
    "note that we determine constructively the potential from the band functions in two steps . at the first step we determined the invariants from the band functions in the paper [ 10 ] .",
    "at the second step , which is given in section 3 , we find the potential from the invariants . in section 4",
    "we consider the stability of the problems studied in the both steps .",
    "first , using the asymptotic formulas obtained in [ 10 ] , we write down explicitly the asymptotic expression of the invariants ( 15)-(17 ) in terms of the band functions and consider the stability of the invariants with respect to the errors in the bloch eigenvalues ( theorem 5 ) .",
    "then we prove the stability of the algorithm given in section 3 with respect to the errors in the invariants ( theorem 6 ) .",
    "in section 5 we prove some uniqueness theorems .",
    "first , we prove a theorem about hill operator @xmath125 when @xmath126 is a trigonometric polynomial ( see theorem 7 ) .",
    "then we construct a set @xmath127 of all periodic functions @xmath32 whose directional potentials ( see ( 10 ) , ( 11 ) ) @xmath106 for all @xmath128 are arbitrary  continuously differentiable functions , where @xmath97 is the set of all visible elements of @xmath14 , @xmath38 is a basis of @xmath14 satisfying ( 6 ) , and the directional potentials @xmath129 @xmath130 , @xmath131 satisfy some conditions . at the end",
    "we prove that if @xmath41 is of the form ( 3 ) , @xmath132 and the band functions of @xmath6 and @xmath133 coincide , then @xmath80 is equal to @xmath41 modulo inversion and translations ( 2 ) ( see theorem 8) .",
    "to describe the invariant ( 15 ) let us prove the following proposition .",
    "every element @xmath101 of the set @xmath134 defined in ( 5 ) , is a visible element of @xmath14 and the corresponding directional potential ( 11 ) has the form ( 12 ) .",
    "let @xmath101 be element of @xmath135 by the definition of @xmath107@xmath136 if @xmath101 is not a visible element of @xmath109 then there exists a visible element @xmath137 of @xmath14 such that @xmath138 for some integer @xmath139 this with ( 18 ) implies that @xmath140 since @xmath141 and @xmath38 is a basis of @xmath14 we have @xmath142 where @xmath143 are integers . combining this with ( 19 ) and taking into account the linearly independence of the vectors @xmath144 , we get @xmath145 this is impossible , since @xmath146 , at least one of the numbers @xmath147 @xmath148 is not zero ( see ( 18 ) ) , @xmath149 and the numbers @xmath143 are integers .",
    "this contradiction shows that any element @xmath101 of @xmath107 is a visible element of @xmath103 therefore , it follows from the definition of @xmath107 ( see ( 5 ) ) that the line @xmath150 contains only two elements @xmath101 and @xmath151 of the set @xmath135 this means that the directional potential ( 11 ) has the form ( 12 )    by proposition 1 the invariant ( 15 ) for the potential ( 3 ) has the form @xmath152 that is , we determine the absolute value of @xmath153 for all @xmath123    to investigate the invariants ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) , we use the conditions in ( 6 ) .",

    "any lattice @xmath14 has a basis @xmath38 satisfying ( 6 ) .",

    "define @xmath158 by@xmath159 where @xmath160 are integers .",
    "since @xmath161 @xmath162 @xmath163 the triple @xmath158 is also basis of @xmath103 in ( 6 ) replacing @xmath38 by @xmath158 , we obtain  @xmath164 inequalities with respect to @xmath165 and @xmath166 .",
    "since @xmath165 and @xmath166 are arbitrary integers one can readily see that there exists @xmath165 and @xmath166 for which these inequalities hold . for example , let @xmath167 where @xmath168 is a large positive number , that is , @xmath169 .",
    "then it follows from ( 22 ) that @xmath170 that is , the first and second inequalities in ( 6 ) hold . besides",
    ", by ( 22 ) , we have @xmath171 where  @xmath172 means that there exist positive constants @xmath173 and @xmath174 such that    @xmath175 , for @xmath176 . the third inequality of ( 6 ) holds due to ( 23 ) . by ( 23 ) the term @xmath177 in the fourth inequality of ( 6 ) can not be canceled by the other terms of this inequality .",
    "thus , we proved that any lattice @xmath14 has a basis @xmath158 satisfying ( 6 ) .",
    "note that , for the given lattice , one can easily find the basis satisfying ( 6 ) .",
    "for example , in the case ( 21 ) , one can readily see that the basis @xmath156 satisfies ( 6 ) if @xmath178 and the basis @xmath157 satisfies ( 6 ) if @xmath179 thus at least one of the bases @xmath156 and @xmath157 satisfies ( 6 )    now to describe the invariants ( 16 ) and ( 17 ) for ( 3 ) let us introduce some notations . if @xmath180 , then the plane @xmath117 coincides with the plane @xmath181 .",
