    "the synchronization of complex dynamical systems is one of the most intriguing problems and has roots in physics , biology , and engineering @xcite .",
    "the problem of synchronization in a network of interacting nodes was first brought to attention by wiener @xcite and later pursued by winfree , who modeled biological oscillators as phase oscillators , neglecting the amplitude @xcite@xcite .",
    "following winfree s pioneering work , there has been considerable effort to study the structural and dynamical effects of the network and its nodes on the state of synchrony .",
    "one important problem encountered in these studies is the possibility of separating the global ( network ) and local ( node ) characteristics to allow a general assessment on stability of the synchronous state . in the seminal work by pecora and carroll @xcite ,",
    "this issue was addressed by introducing the concept of master stability equation .",
    "this equation provides a condition on stability of the network , known as master stability condition ( msc ) .",
    "the msc also leads to useful bounds on structural properties of the network such as eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix of the network @xcite@xcite . following this important result ,",
    "most of the focus has been directed toward interpreting the bounds on eigenvalues of the laplacian matrix of the network implied by the msc as bounds on the degrees of nodes in the network . in @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "the effect of heterogeneity and _ smallness _ of the network on synchronization stability have been investigated and it has been shown that if the network is more homogeneous the stability of synchrony is easier to achieve .",
    "though most efforts have focused on the unweighted and undirected graphs , @xcite and @xcite have investigated the master stability equation in directed and weighted structures , respectively .",
    "since the synchronization manifold can be considered as a fixed point of a reduced ( induced ) space , the vast majority of the existing literature on the synchronization in the networks considers the largest traversal lyapunov exponent as a measure of stability of the synchronization .",
    "of course , as noted in @xcite , the negativity of lyapunov exponents is not a necessary nor a sufficient condition on the stability of manifold itself and it does not stop the manifold from bubbling and bursting @xcite@xcite .    in this paper , we use an alternative master stability equation derived from lyapunov direct method to obtain a condition on the stability of the whole network , based on the eigenvalues of symmetric part of local and coupling dynamics . since this condition encompasses the lyapunov spectrum , it is a sufficient condition on the stability @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we generalize the conventional setup where the linkage matrices are diagonal ( often with binary components ) to the case of an arbitrary linkage matrix , allowing multi - state and cross - state linkages , possibly with different strengths , which is now receiving more attention @xcite@xcite .",
    "we then use the derived msc to calculate a lower bound on the probability of stability for large erds - rnyi networks .",
    "we relate the condition of stability to dynamical characteristics of individual nodes and their coupling and structural properties of the erds - rnyi networks , namely , network size and randomness parameter .",
    "consider a network of @xmath0 identical nodes with identical coupling dynamics @xmath1 where @xmath2 denotes the state vector of node @xmath3 , and @xmath4 and @xmath5 denote the node and coupling dynamics , respectively .",
    "@xmath6 $ ] is the laplacian matrix of the network .",
    "since @xmath7 has zero row - sum , this network has a synchronization state , @xmath8 , which is the solution of local state equation , @xmath9 , and @xmath10 .",
    "this equation also defines the synchronization manifold . to maintain the synchrony throughout the network ,",
    "all @xmath11 should converge to a synchronous state , @xmath8 .",
    "this means that all the modes traverse to the synchronization manifold should be damped out @xcite .",
    "denote the deviation of the state of each node from the synchronous state by @xmath12 .",
    "if @xmath13 are small , ( [ eq : singmast ] ) can be linearized around @xmath8 as @xmath14 where @xmath15 and @xmath16 are jacobian matrices of @xmath17 and @xmath18 around @xmath8 , respectively .",
    "note that in general , @xmath19 is time dependent and so are the jacobians . here , for brevity of the presentation , we have dropped the explicit dependence of @xmath15 and @xmath16 on @xmath19 ( and therefore on time ) from our notation . combining ( [ eq : celleq ] ) for all _ i _",
    ", we obtain the unified dynamical equation of the whole network as @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the identity matrix of size @xmath0 , @xmath22 denotes the kronecker product , and @xmath23^t$ ] is the error vector with respect to @xmath24 , where @xmath25_{n\\times 1}$ ] .",
    "superscript @xmath26 denotes the transpose operator .    in the rest of the paper ,",
    "we assume that the network is undirected , and therefore its laplacian matrix is symmetric , i.e. , @xmath27 for all @xmath28 .",
    "the network synchronization is exponentially stable around @xmath8 , if @xmath29 is exponentially stable .",
    "due to zero row sum property of @xmath7 , its smallest eigenvalue , @xmath30 , is zero @xcite .",
    "the mode for @xmath31 in represents the variation parallel to manifold and hence should be omitted in the study of stability for traversal exponents @xcite .",
    "furthermore , multiplicity of zero in the set of network eigenvalues is one , if and only if the the graph is connected @xcite .",
    "the remaining modes in ( [ eq : neteq ] ) are traverse to the synchronization manifold and they decay exponentially if and only if the corresponding modes of the system governed by @xmath29 are exponentially stable .",
    "now , considering the system , the norm of @xmath32 can be bounded by ( @xcite thms . 1 and 2 )",
    "@xmath33 for all @xmath34 and some @xmath35 . here",
    "@xmath36 denotes the largest eigenvalue of the argument .",
    "we note that if @xmath37 for all @xmath38 , the exponent approaches negative infinity as @xmath39 approaches infinity and the system is stable .",
    "thus , a sufficient condition on stability is @xmath40 here @xmath41 denotes negative definiteness of a matrix .",
    "this condition guaranties damping of traverse modes and can be used as stability criteria in the study of dynamical systems @xcite .    since @xmath29 can be written in block jordan form , the equivalent sufficient condition on asymptotic stability for yields @xmath42 for @xmath43 .",
    "hence , @xmath29 is exponentially stable if and only if @xmath44 is stable for all @xmath45 , where @xmath46 is the @xmath3th largest eigenvalue of @xmath7 ( see appendix for propf ) .",
    "the condition in ( [ eq : msc2 ] ) requires the largest eigenvalue of symmetric part of @xmath44 to be strictly negative , and not approaching zero from below .",
    "here we have used the assumption that  is symmetric .",
    "thus , @xmath47 are real and non - negative is replaced with @xmath48 , where superscripts @xmath49 and @xmath50 denote hermitian and complex conjugate operators , respectively . ] . in the case of complex @xmath51",
    ", hermitian operator replaces the transpose operator .",
    "now we can use weyl s inequalities to further explore ( [ eq : msc2 ] ) .",
    "the weyl inequalities provide upper and lower bounds on the eigenvalues of sum of hermitian matrices .",
    "assume that @xmath52 and @xmath53 are @xmath54 hermitian matrices , and @xmath55 , then weyl s inequalities state that ( @xcite thm .",
    "1.3 ) @xmath56 and @xmath57 where @xmath58 denotes the @xmath59th largest eigenvalue of the argument . utilizing ( [ eq : honeycomb2 ] ) with @xmath60 and ( [ eq : honeycomb1 ] ) with @xmath61 yields @xmath62 and @xmath63 for @xmath64 .",
    "now , since @xmath65 and @xmath66 are hermitian , we can use ( [ eq : honeycomb21 ] ) and ( [ eq : honeycomb11 ] ) to bound @xmath67 from both sides : @xmath68 and @xmath69 for @xmath64 .    to obtain a sufficient condition on stability we now force the upper bound in ( [ eq : bon1 ] ) , to be negative @xmath70 for @xmath71 and some @xmath35 . since @xmath72 maybe positive or negative , the second term in ( [ eq : ub ] ) reduces to @xmath73 .",
    "thus , a sufficient condition on stability is @xmath74 for some @xmath35 , where @xmath75 .",
    "we can also derive a necessary condition for by forcing the lower bound in ( [ eq : bon2 ] ) to be negative , or @xmath76 let @xmath59 be the index of smallest positive eigenvalue of @xmath77",
    ". then ( [ eq : instab cond1 ] ) reduces to @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80    in the case that @xmath81 , if @xmath82 then the condition is not satisfied , and if @xmath83 , the corresponding condition can be eliminated .",
    "we note that , ( [ eq : instabcond1 ] ) is a necessary condition on , which itself is a sufficient condition on stability .",
    "therefore ( [ eq : instabcond1 ] ) does not reveal anything about the stability of the network .",
    "however , since ( [ eq : stabcond1 ] ) and ( [ eq : instabcond1 ] ) sandwich , ( [ eq : instabcond1 ] ) provides some information regarding how close and ( [ eq : stabcond1 ] ) are .",
    "having developed the bounds on condition , namely and , we now proceed to relate them to the degree properties of the network .",
    "to do this , we employ following inequalities known for symmetric laplacian matrices @xcite @xmath84 and @xmath85 where @xmath86 and @xmath87 denote the maximum and minimum node degrees , respectively . using these , and ( [ eq : stabcond1 ] )",
    ", the stability condition can be also expressed as @xmath88 where @xmath89 and@xmath90 similarly , necessary conditions for become @xmath91 where @xmath92 and , @xmath93 from ( 12 ) one can draw the conclusion that in the network with low algebraic connectivity , @xmath94 , synchronization is difficult to achieve .",
    "this behavior is caused by the fact that the coupling is not strong enough to push / pull the oscillators to synchronous state . and from we can see the other case of non - synchronization behavior occurs when ( some ) nodes have too many connections ( condition on @xmath95 ) .",
    "this phenomenon is known as synchronization quenching , where the coupling is so strong that eliminates the self - drive of ( some of ) the oscillators and consequently , the network can not achieve synchrony @xcite .",
    "in the following , we investigate probability of stability of erds - rnyi networks @xcite . for large erds - rnyi networks with randomness parameter @xmath96 ,",
    "we can use ( [ eq : stabcond1 ] ) and ( [ eq : instabcond1 ] ) to calculate the lower and upper bounds on the probability of being satisfied .",
    "we recall that provides a lower bound on the probability of stability , whereas describes the closeness of this lower bound and the probability of .",
    "since eigenvalues of any large randomly generated symmetric matrix follows the wigner s semi - circular distribution @xcite , we can approximate the distribution of eigenvalues of laplacian for an erds - rnyi network . by definition @xmath97 where  is the adjacency matrix of the network , and",
    "@xmath98 is the degree sequence of the nodes .",
    "also in large erds - rnyi network , we can approximate @xmath99 by @xmath100 , the average degree of the network @xcite .",
    "hence , @xmath101 .",
    "thus the eigenvalues of  have ( approximately ) the following distribution @xcite @xmath102 where @xmath103 the order statistics @xmath94 and @xmath95 have densities @xmath104^{n-2}p_{\\mu}(x),\\nonumber\\ ] ] and @xmath105^{n-2}p_{\\mu}(x),\\nonumber\\ ] ] where @xmath106 now , we can evaluate the probability of occurrence of each conditions given in and .",
    "the lower bound on the probability of stability attained from wigner s approximation for is @xmath107^{n-1 } & \\lambda_n(\\bh+\\bh^t)>0\\\\ \\left[p_\\mu\\left(\\mu^{\\dag}\\right)\\right]^{n-1 } & \\lambda_n(\\bh+\\bh^t)<0\\end{array}\\right.\\label{eq : wsuf}\\ ] ] similarly , an upper bound on the probability of being satisfied can be derived by applying wigner s approximation to ( [ eq : instabcond1 ] ) @xmath108^{n-1}+p_\\mu^{n-1}(\\mu_{1}^{\\ddag } ) -[p_\\mu(\\mu_{1}^{\\ddag})-p_\\mu(\\mu_{n-1}^{\\ddag})]^{n-1 } \\right).\\label{eq : wnec}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    since these probabilities have relatively sharp roll - offs as a function of @xmath0 ( see numerical results ) , we can use randomness values , @xmath109 , which yield @xmath110 and @xmath111 , to study the synchrony trends as network parameters change . from ( [ eq : wsuf ] ) and ( [ eq : wnec ] ) , we have @xmath112 , \\nonumber\\ ] ] and @xmath113 . \\nonumber\\ ] ] thus , the value of randomness , _ p _ , required to have stable synchronous state decreases as @xmath114 .",
    "for a numerical example , we consider a network of rssler oscillators ( with parameters @xmath115 , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 ) @xcite coupled through all of their states .",
    "this set of parameters results in a coherent chaotic oscillation , since @xmath118 @xcite .",

    "n _ , and with coupling strength @xmath127 .",
    "as it can be seen , probabilities of ( [ eq : stabcond1 ] ) and ( [ eq : instabcond1 ] ) are close to that of ( [ eq : msc2 ] ) .",
    "moreover , we observe that the approximated probabilities provided by the wigner s distribution of eigenvalues of the network are also reasonably close .    as fig . [",
    "fig : pnp ] shows for positive definite @xmath128 in a large network if the average degree , @xmath129 , is above some _ threshold _",
    ", @xmath130 , ( in this example approximately @xmath131 ) the network becomes stable .",

    "[ fig : pnc ] shows that the stability of the network grows as the network size and coupling factor increase .",
    "of course this is due to our choice of coupling dynamics which is positive definite and by increasing coupling strength , it provides stronger negative feedback to stabilize the network .",
    "in conclusion , considering an alternative master stability condition , we have derived a sufficient condition of stability which is a function of the eigenvalues of network structure and symmetric parts of linearized local and coupling dynamics .",
    "our condition relates the largest eigenvalues of the symmetric coupling and the symmetric local dynamics to stability conditions of the networks . for erds - rnyi network",
    "we have calculated a lower bound on the probability of stability .",
    "then we have proceeded to calculated associated threshold value of randomness where the system starts to become stable as @xmath96 increases beyond this threshold .",
    "the reason for this phenomenon is that below the certain threshold , all or some of the nodes can not achieve sufficient information exchange . as a result , those nodes can not synchronize themselves with the rest of the network .",
