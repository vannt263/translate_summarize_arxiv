    "all @xmath1110 extrasolar planets discovered within 50 parsecs have been found from precision doppler surveys over the past decade .",
    "it is these nearest stars with planets that are of the greatest interest for immediate follow up by hst astrometry ( benedict et al .",
    "2002 ) and spectroscopy ( charbonneau et al . 2002 ) .",
    "next generation follow up missions include precision astrometry with the space interferometry mission , and direct imaging of jovian and terrestrial planets with giant ground  based telescopes such as tmt ( celt ) , gsmt , giant magellan , and owl , and space  based telescopes such as tpf and darwin",
    ".    precision doppler surveys are most sensitive to planets orbiting sun  like stars older than 2 gyr that have no stellar companions within 3 arc  seconds",
    ". stars of spectral type earlier than late f rotate rapidly and have few absorption lines . stars younger than 2 gyr have photospheric magnetic fields and spots , which cause an intrinsic velocity `` jitter '' that correlates with chromospheric activity ( wright et al .",
    "stars with close companions can not be cleanly separated on a spectrometer entrance slit . coincidentally",
    "single stars that are older than 2 gyr represent the ideal targets for habitable terrestrial planet searches , and by extension searches for extraterrestrial intelligence ( seti ) ( turnbull & tarter 2003 ) .",
    "there are roughly 2,000 fgkm stars within 50 parsecs that meet these criteria .    over the past 5 years",
    "the number of stars being monitored by our precision doppler programs has increased from @xmath1500 to nearly all 2,000 primary targets within 50 pc .",
    "we are carrying out northern hemisphere surveys with the lick 3m telescope ( fischer et al .",
    "2003 ) and keck 10m telescope ( vogt et al .",
    "2002 ) , and southern surveys with the aat 3.9m ( tinney et al . 2003 ) and the magellan 6.5m telescopes .",
    "these programs have yielded 75 of the 110 published extrasolar planets ( butler et al .",
    "2002 ) .    in 2002",
    "the guaranteed allocation to our aat planet search program was increased from 20 to 32 nights per year . in response",
    "two changes were made .",
    "sixty new stars were added , and observations with s / n @xmath2200 were demanded for all stars . in this paper",
    "we report two new planets from this survey , a planet around hd 154857 including evidence of a second more distant companion , and a second planet around hd 160691 .",
    "high resolution spectra , r @xmath1 50000 , are taken with the ucles echelle spectrometer ( diego et al .",
    "1990 ) on the 3.9m anglo  australian telescope .",
    "these spectra span the wavelength range from 48208550  . an iodine absorption cell ( marcy & butler 1992 ) provides wavelength calibration from 5000 to 6100  .",
    "the spectrometer psf is derived from the detailed shapes of the embedded iodine lines ( valenti et al .",

    "houk & cowley ( 1975 ) classify hd 154857 ( hip 84069 , sao 244491 ) as a g5 dwarf , consistent with its color , @xmath3 @xmath4 @xmath5 .",
    "the hipparcos derived distance , 68.5 pc ( esa 1997 ; perryman et al . 1996 ) , yields an absolute v magnitude , @xmath6 = 3.07 , @xmath12 magnitudes above the main sequence , suggesting that the star is evolved .",
    "high metallicity alone is unlikely to produce such a large displacement from the main sequence .",

    "the linear trend of -14 per year is presumably due to an additional companion with a period much longer than 2 years and a semiamplitude greater than 14 .",
    "astrometry from hipparcos reveals no wobble at the level of 1 mas ( esa 1997 ) .",
    "this places no useful constraint on the outer companion as its orbital period is longer than the hipparcos mission duration of 3 years , allowing any astrometric wobble to be absorbed in the solution for proper motion .      the bright star catalog ( hoffleit & jaschek 1982 ) assigns a spectral type of g3 iv - v to hd 160691 ( hr 6585 , hip 86796 , gl 691 , mu ara ) , in reasonable agreement with numerous other determinations ( see simbad ) that typically yield g5 v. the hipparcos distance of hd 160691 is 15.3 pc , yielding an absolute magnitude of @xmath6 @xmath4 @xmath16 .",

    "figure 4 shows a double keplerian fit to the data .",
    "the periods of these two keplerian models are 1.76 and 8.17 years , with orbital eccentricities of 0.20 and 0.57 , semiamplitudes of 38 and 51 , minimum ( @xmath15 ) masses of 1.67 and 3.10 m@xmath0 , and semimajor axes of 1.50 and 4.16 au respectively .",
    "this double keplerian model represents a significant improvement over the single keplerian model with a linear trend , with residuals yielding rms = 4.66 and @xmath14 = 1.60 .",
    "nonetheless , other fits , with somewhat different periods and eccentricities may have only slightly worse values of rms scatter and @xmath14 .",
    "multi - keplerian best fits can occasionally yield solutions which are not dynamically stable ( gozdziewski , konacki & maciejewski , 2003 ) .",
    "sophisticated dynamical analyses of this system , such as those which impose the assumption of orbital stability , employ jacobi coordinates ( e.g. lee & peale , 2003 ; gozdziewski , konacki & maciejewski , 2003 ) , and which use genetic algorithms to derive superior inital guesses are warrented , but beyond the scope of the present paper .",
    "table 3 shows the orbital parameters for these two planets as well as the those of the companion to hd 154857 .",
    "figure 5 shows each of the keplerian orbits separately .",
    "while the period of the inner planet is tightly constrained with more than 3 full orbits observed , the outer planet is somewhat under constrained with observations spanning only 70% of the full period .",
    "hipparcos astrometry reveals no wobble above standard errors of @xmath11 mas . the outer companion would cause a wobble easily absorbed into the solution for proper motion .",
    "based on these fits , the maximum angular separation of the outer planet , hd 160691c , from the star is expected to be @xmath23 = 0.43 arcsec .",
    "this planet is detectable by future imaging systems that achieve resolution ( @xmath24 ) of less than 0.4 arcsec and that carefully suppresses the wings of the psf due to mirror roughness , including proposed space  based programs such as eclipse ( easley & trauger 2003 ) , and ground based efforts at vlt and gemini .",
    "future astrometry with precision of better than 1 mas , such as that offered by the hubble space telescope and its fine guidance sensor ( benedict et al .",
    "2002 ) or by sim , can also detect hd 160691c , however a duration of @xmath1 8 yr would be required .",
    "multiple planet systems are revealed considerably more slowly than single  planets . for `` hierarchical '' systems with widely separated planets ,",
    "the inner planet usually induces the largest doppler wobble in the host star , making it typically detectable first , as occurred with 55 cancri ( marcy et al .",
    "2002 ) and @xmath25 and ( butler et al .",
    "1999 ; butler et al .",
    "1997 ) . for cases where the periods of both planets are short , the most massive planet may be revealed first , as with gl 876 ( marcy et al .",
    "detectability stems from both the amplitude of the doppler signal and the number of cycles that have transpired during the string of observations .",
    "both of the systems reported in this paper are of the first type , with the inner planet detected first . for the case of hd 154857 ,",
    "the presumed outer companion is detected only as a linear trend at this time .",
    "similarly , the existence of the second companions to hd 160691 and to 55 cancri were first reported as a linear trends ( e.g. , jones et al . 2002 ) .",
    "based on the results of jones et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , bois et al .",
    "( 2003 ) carried out a study of the dynamic stability of the hd 160691 system .",
    "they concluded that the two planets must be in a 2:1 mean motion resonance , and that the outer companion should be in a highly eccentric ( e @xmath2 0.52 ) orbit . with the identical data set , gozdziewski et al .",
    "( 2003 ) conclude that this system can not be in a 2:1 mean motion resonance , and that if the semimajor axis of the outer companion is smaller than 5.2 au the system should be in a low - order mean motion resonance ( `` 3:1 , 7:2 , 4:1 , 5:1 , or to their vicinity '' ) , and that the eccentricity of the outer companion should be less than 0.5 .    with data covering only @xmath170% of the orbit ,",
    "the orbital parameters of the outer companion to hd 160691 have relatively large uncertainties .",
    "nonetheless the lower limit of the period of hd 160691c is 8 yr , ruling out a 2:1 mean motion resonance with the inner planet ( @xmath26=1.76 yr ) .",
    "similarly , mean  motion resonances of 3:1 and 4:1 seem ruled out .",
    "a 5:1 mean motion resonance remains plausible as is one of 9:2 ratio .",
    "the orbital eccentricity of the outer planet , however , remains poorly constrained .",
    "both of these systems highlight the importance of long term monitoring and of doppler measurement precision . neither the second planet to hd 160691 nor the linear trend to hd 154857 would be detectable with measurement uncertainties greater than 7 .",
    "the outer planet around hd 160691 is one of only a few known extrasolar planets that is separated from its host star at apastron by over 0.4 arcsec , making it a prime target for future efforts designed to directly image extrasolar planets .",
