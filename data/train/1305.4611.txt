    "the exclusive vector meson photoproduction , @xmath2 , has being investigated both experimentally and theoretically in recent years as it allows to test perturbative quantum chromodynamics .",
    "the quarkonium masses , @xmath3 , give a perturbative scale for the problem even in the photoproduction limit , @xmath4 .",
    "an important feature of these processes at the high energy regime is the possibility to investigate the pomeron exchange . for this energy domain hadrons and photons",
    "can be considered as color dipoles in the mixed light cone representation @xcite , where their transverse size can be considered frozen during the interaction .",
    "therefore , the scattering process is characterized by the color dipole cross section describing the interaction of those color dipoles with the nucleon target .",
    "dipole sizes of transverse size @xmath5 are probed by the @xmath6 vector meson production amplitude @xcite whereas the diffractive production of the @xmath7 radially excited vector mesons present the so - called node effect @xcite .",
    "a strong cancellation of dipole size contributions to the production amplitude from the region above and below the node position in the @xmath7 radial wavefunction @xcite takes place and gives origin to a large suppression of the photoproduction @xmath7 states compared to the @xmath6 states .    in the present work we focus on the exclusive photoproduction of @xmath0 and the radially excited @xmath1 mesons off nucleon in proton - proton collisions .",
    "an important motivation is the recent measurement by the lhcb collaboration of the cross section at @xmath8 tev of the exclusive dimuon final states , including the @xmath1 state @xcite .",
    "those measurements were performed at forward rapidities @xmath9 , which corresponds to sufficiently bjorken-@xmath10 variable down to @xmath11 .",
    "the theoretical framework considered in the current investigation is the light - cone dipole formalism , where the @xmath12 fluctuation ( color dipole ) of the incoming quasi - real photon interacts with the nucleon target via the dipole cross section and the result is projected in the wavefunction of the observed hadron . at high energies , a transition of the regime described by the linear dynamics of emissions chain to a new regime where the physical process of recombination of partons becomes important is expected .",
    "such energy regime is characterized by the limitation on the maximum phase - space parton density that can be reached in the hadron wavefunction : the parton saturation phenomenon .",
    "the transition is set by saturation scale @xmath13 . for recent reviews on these subjects we quote refs .",
    "@xcite . therefore",
    ", the theoretical investigation of @xmath14 and @xmath1 mesons can shed light on the experimental constraints for the dipole - proton cross section and on the phenomenological models based on parton saturation ideas . along these lines , recently in ref .",
    "@xcite we have investigated the photoproduction of radially excited vector mesons off nuclei in heavy ion relativistic collisions . there , the exclusive photoproduction of @xmath15 off nuclei was analyzed , evaluating the coherent and the incoherent contributions to that process .",
    "the approach gives a reasonable description of alice collaboration data for @xcite @xmath0 production at 2.76 tev in pbpb collisions and predictions are provided for the @xmath1 state .",
    "the aim of this work is twofold .",
    "first , we show predictions for the photoproduction of @xmath14 and its excited state in proton - proton collisions at the lhc within the same phenomenological formalism .",
    "this fact is completely new as most part of predictions in literature concern only to the psi(1s ) state .",
    "second , we investigate the sensitivity of recent lhcb data to the small - x dynamics encoded in our phenomenological model for the dipole cross section .",
    "as already mentioned the @xmath15 wavefunction presents nodes compared to the 1s state .",
    "this fact turns out the production amplitude sensitive to large dipole size configurations and therefore it is scanning the transition region between the color transparency behavior , @xmath16 , to the soft non - perturbative region . in the saturation models",
    "such a transition is driven by the saturation scale and this is an clear advantage of phenomenological model considered here .",
    "the analysis presentation is organized as follows . in the next section we present a brief review of the diffractive photoproduction of vector mesons in proton - proton collisions . in section [ resultados ]",
    "we present the predictions for the @xmath14 and @xmath15 photoproduction cross sections at forward rapidities .",
    "we compare the theoretical results to the recent lhcb collaboration measurements of exclusive @xmath0 and @xmath15 production @xcite .",
    "in addition , we compare the current results to related approaches available in the literature and discuss the main theoretical uncertainties . finally , in section [ conc ] we summarize our main results and conclusions .",
    "the exclusive vector meson photoproduction is described by the photon - pomeron process , @xmath17 .",
    "the corresponding production cross section at photon level is denoted by @xmath18 .",
