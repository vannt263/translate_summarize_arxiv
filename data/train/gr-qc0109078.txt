    "neutron stars are believed to form from the core collapse of massive stars and the accretion induced collapse of massive white dwarfs .",
    "if the stellar core or white dwarf is rotating , conservation of angular momentum implies that the resulting neutron star must rotate very rapidly .",
    "it has been suggested  @xcite that such a rapidly rotating star may develop a non - axisymmetric dynamical instability , emitting a substantial amount of gravitational radiation which might be detectable by gravitational wave observatories such as ligo , virgo , geo and tama .",
    "rotational instabilities arise from non - axisymmetric perturbations having angular dependence @xmath4 , where @xmath5 is the azimuthal angle .",
    "the @xmath0 mode is called the bar mode , which is usually the strongest mode for stars undergoing instabilities .",
    "there are two types of instabilities .",
    "dynamical _ instability is driven by hydrodynamics and gravity , and it develops on a dynamical timescale , i.e.  the timescale for a sound wave to travel across the star . a _ secular _",
    "instability , on the other hand , is driven by viscosity or gravitational radiation reaction , and its growth time is determined by the relevant dissipative timescale .",
    "these secular timescales are usually much longer than the dynamical timescale of the system .    in this paper , we focus on the dynamical instabilities resulting from the new - born neutron stars formed from accretion induced collapse ( aic ) of white dwarfs .",
    "these instabilities occur only for rapidly rotating stars . a useful parameter to characterize the rotation of a star is @xmath6 , where @xmath7 and @xmath8 are the rotational kinetic energy and gravitational potential energy respectively .",
    "it is well - known that there is a critical value @xmath9 so that a star will be dynamically unstable if its @xmath10 . for a uniform density and rigidly rotating star , the maclaurin spheroid , the critical value is determined to be @xmath11  @xcite .",
    "numerous numerical simulations using newtonian gravity show that @xmath9 remains roughly the same for differentially rotating polytropes having the same specific angular momentum distribution as the maclaurin spheroids  @xcite .",
    "however , @xmath9 can take values between 0.14 to 0.27 for other angular momentum distributions  @xcite ( the lower limit @xmath12 is observed only for a star having a toroidal density distribution , i.e.  the maximum density occurs off the center  @xcite ) .",
    "numerical simulations using full general relativity and post - newtonian approximations suggest that relativistic corrections to newtonian gravity cause @xmath9 to decrease slightly  @xcite .",
    "most of the stability analyses to date have been carried out by assuming that the star rotates with an _ ad hoc _ rotation law or using simplified equations of state .",
    "the results of these analyses might not be applicable to the new - born neutron stars resulting from aic .",
    "recently , fryer , holz and hughes  @xcite carried out an aic simulation using a realistic rotation law and a realistic equation of state .",
    "their pre - collapse white dwarf has an angular momentum @xmath13 . after the collapse ,",
    "the neutron star has @xmath1 less than 0.06 , which is too small for the star to be dynamically unstable .",
    "however , they point out that if the pre - collapse white dwarf spins faster , the resulting neutron star could have high enough @xmath1 to trigger a dynamical instability .",
    "they also point out that a pre - collapse white dwarf could easily be spun up to rapid rotation by accretion .",
    "the spin of an accreting white dwarf before collapse depends on its initial mass , its magnetic field strength and the accretion rate , etc .",
    "@xcite .",
    "liu and lindblom  @xcite ( hereafter paper  i ) in a recent paper construct equilibrium models of new - born neutron stars resulting from aic based on conservation of specific angular momentum .",
    "their results show that if the pre - collapse white dwarfs are rapidly rotating , the resulting neutron stars could have @xmath1 as large as 0.26 , which is slightly smaller than the critical value @xmath9 for maclaurin spheroids . however , the specific angular momentum distributions of those neutron stars are very different from that of maclaurin spheroids .",
    "so there is no reason to believe that the traditional value @xmath14 can be applied to those models .",
    "the purpose of this paper is first to determine the critical value @xmath9 for the new - born neutron stars resulting from aic , and then estimate the signal to noise ratio and detectability of the gravitational waves emitted as a result of the instability .",
    "we do not intend to provide an accurate number for the signal to noise ratio , which requires a detailed non - linear evolution of the dynamical instability .",
    "instead , we use newtonian gravitation theory to compute the structure of new - born neutron stars .",
    "then we evolve the linearized newtonian hydrodynamical equations to study the star s stability and determine the critical value @xmath9 .",
    "relativistic effects are expected to give a correction of order @xmath15 , which is about 8% for the rapidly rotating neutron stars studied in this paper . here",
    "@xmath16 is a typical sound speed inside the star and @xmath17 is the speed of light .",

    "in this section , we describe briefly how we construct new - born neutron star models from the pre - collapse white dwarfs .",
    "a more detailed description is given in paper  i.      we consider two types of pre - collapse white dwarfs : those made of carbon - oxygen ( c - o ) and those made of oxygen - neon - magnesium ( o - ne - mg ) .",
    "the collapse of a massive c - o white dwarf is triggered by the explosive carbon burning near the center of the star  @xcite .",
    "the central density of the pre - collapse c - o white dwarf must be in the range @xmath18 in order for the collapse to result in a neutron star , rather than exploding as a type  ia supernova  @xcite .",
    "the collapse of a massive o - ne - mg white dwarf , on the other hand , is triggered by electron captures by @xmath19 and @xmath20 when the central density reaches @xmath21  @xcite .",
    "we construct three sequences of pre - collapse white dwarfs , with models in each sequence having different amounts of rotation .",
    "sequences i and ii correspond to c - o white dwarfs with central densities @xmath22 and @xmath23 respectively .",
    "sequence iii is for o - ne - mg white dwarfs with @xmath24 .",
    "all white dwarfs are assumed to rotate rigidly , because the timescale for a magnetic field to suppress differential rotation is much shorter than the accretion timescale ( see sec .",
    "[ sec : dis ] ) .",
    "the pre - collapse white dwarfs constructed in this section are described by the equation of state ( eos ) of a zero - temperature ideal degenerate electron gas with electrostatic corrections derived by salpeter  @xcite . at high density ,",
    "the pressure is dominated by the ideal degenerate fermi gas with electron fraction @xmath25 that is suitable for both c - o and o - ne - mg white dwarfs .",
    "electrostatic corrections , which depend on the white dwarf composition through the atomic number @xmath26 , contribute only a few percent to the eos for the high density white dwarfs considered here .",
    "equilibrium models are computed by hachisu s self - consistent field method  @xcite , which is an iteration scheme based on the integrated euler equation for hydrostatic equilibrium : @xmath27 where @xmath28 is the rotational angular frequency of the star ; @xmath29 is a constant ; @xmath30 is the radius from the rotation axis ; @xmath31 is the specific enthalpy , which is related to the density @xmath32 and pressure @xmath33 by @xmath34 the gravitational potential @xmath35 satisfies the poisson equation @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the self - consistent field method determines the structure of the star for fixed values of two adjustable parameters . in ref .",
    "@xcite , the maximum density and axis ratio ( the ratio of polar to equatorial radii ) are the chosen parameters . however , it is more convenient to choose the central density @xmath38 and equatorial radius @xmath39 as the two parameters for the models studied here .",

    "@xmath28 is the rotational angular frequency ; @xmath40 is the maximum rotational angular frequency of the white dwarf in the sequence without mass - shedding ; @xmath39 , @xmath41 , @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath1 are respectively the equatorial radius , polar radius , mass , angular momentum and the ratio of rotational kinetic to gravitational potential energies . [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     the eigenfunctions of the most unstable bar mode for the other unstable equilibrium neutron stars are similar to those displayed above .",
    "table  [ tab : omega ] summarizes the oscillation frequencies [ @xmath44 and e - folding time @xmath45 of the unstable models we have studied .",
    "the table also shows the ratio of the rotational frequency of the pre - collapse white dwarfs to the maximum frequency @xmath40 of the white dwarf in the sequence .",
    "we find that the oscillation frequencies are almost the same ( @xmath46 ) for all the cases .",
    "we do not observe any instability in our simulations for stars with @xmath47 .",
    "hence we conclude that @xmath9 is somewhere between 0.241 and 0.251 , and the pre - collapse white dwarf has to have @xmath48 in order for the collapsed star to develop a dynamical instability .",
    "in this section , we estimate the strength of the gravitational radiation emitted by neutron stars undergoing a dynamical instability .",
    "we also estimate the signal to noise ratio and discuss the detectability of these sources .",
    "the rms amplitude of a gravitational wave strain , @xmath49 , depends on the orientation of the source and its location on the detector s sky .",
    "when averaged over these angles , its value is given by  @xcite @xmath50 where @xmath51 and @xmath52 are the rms amplitudes of the plus and cross polarizations of the wave respectively , and @xmath53 denotes an average over the orientation of the source and its location on the detector s sky .",

    "when a neutron star develops a dynamical instability and the bar mode ( @xmath0 ) is the only unstable mode , the values of @xmath31 , @xmath69 and @xmath70 will be dominated by the term involving @xmath71 . since the unstable bar mode has even parity under reflection about the equatorial plane , @xmath72 and the next leading term will involve @xmath73 and @xmath74 .",
    "these terms are expected to be smaller than the @xmath71 term by a factor of @xmath75 for @xmath69 and @xmath70 , and a factor of @xmath15 for @xmath31 . in our models , @xmath76 , so the contribution of higher order mass and current multipole moments are small and will be neglected .    strictly speaking ,",
    "the above analysis only applies when the amplitudes of the perturbations are small . when the amplitudes are large , however , the fluid motion does not separate neatly into decoupled fourier components , so all @xmath60 and @xmath61 will contribute . however , it is expected that the @xmath71 term will still be the most important term .",
    "since the detailed non - linear evolution of the dynamical instability is not known , the aim of this section is to provide an order of magnitude estimate of the gravitational radiation from these sources .",
    "hence we shall only consider the effect of the mass quadrupole moment and assume @xmath71 can be approximated by the bar - mode eigenfunctions computed in sec .",

    "they find that the mode saturates when the density perturbation is comparable to the equilibrium density , and the mode pattern persists , giving a long - lived gravitational wave signal . here",
    "we assume that this is the case , and that the mode dies out only after a substantial amount of angular momentum is removed from the system by gravitational radiation .",

    "the event rate of the core collapse of massive stars is much higher than that of the aic .",
