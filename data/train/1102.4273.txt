    "recent years have seen the tremendous development in our understanding of @xmath13 correspondence .",
    "important inflection point is proposal by j. schwarz @xcite that underlying @xmath14 can be written as chern - simons matter ( csm ) theories without the usual kinetic term for the gauge fields , especially for higher supersymmetric theories with @xmath15 .",
    "once that proposal is realized in specific examples , the understanding of @xmath13 correspondence has grown by leaps and bounds .",
    "after the realization that the bagger - lambert - gustavsson theory @xcite can be written as the usual @xmath16 chern - simons matter theory @xcite , there appeared a paper by gaiotto and witten @xcite where the attempt is made to write down @xmath17 chern - simons matter theory with matter hypermultiplets .",
    "the attempt was generalized in @xcite which includes twisted hypermultiplets as well , thereby writing down the general classes of @xmath17 chern - simons matter theories .",
    "the special case of such construction is the famous @xmath18 theory , known as abjm theory @xcite , describing coincident m2 branes on @xmath19 where @xmath20 is the chern - simons level for two gauge groups of abjm theory .",
    "since then , various tests and checks are made for @xmath21 correspondence with the most emphasis on abjm theory .",
    "the first check is the matching of the moduli space@xcite or chiral operators .",
    "also the partition function on @xmath22 of abjm theory is worked out to confirm the famous @xmath23 behavior of the membrane degrees of freedom@xcite .",
    "similar behvior is also observed for other @xmath17 theories in @xcite .",
    "there is a huge development on the integrability of the special sectors of ads4/cft3 correpondence .",
    "see @xcite and subsequent reviews .",
    "one of the most sophisticated test so far comes from the computation and comparison of the field theory / gravity index .",
    "for abjm theory , such computation was first worked out for large @xmath24 limit in @xcite and was generalized for arbitrary @xmath24 in @xcite and especially for @xmath25 .",
    "the computation was generalized to @xmath17 theories in @xcite .",
    "the problem of the states arising in the gravity index from the twisted sector was resolved by @xcite and again the field theory index perfectly matches with that of the gravity .",
    "the index computation with the lower supersymmetric theories poses several problems .",
    "first of all , given the gravity background of the type @xmath26 where @xmath27 denotes a suitable sasaki - einstein 7-manifold , it s not clear in general what kind of field theory we have to compare with .",
    "there are plethora of examples which lead to the same moduli space in field theory .",
    "one might think that such theories are related to each other via dualities a la seiberg .",
    "this could be true of some related theories but there are also counterexamples . in @xcite",
    ", it was shown that two theories , abjm theory and @xmath28 variant of the dual abjm model lead to the differnt indices even though they have the identical moduli space @xmath29 with chern - simons level @xmath25 .",
    "going down to @xmath30 theories we have far more theories having identical chiral rings . on the other hand in @xcite , it was shown that the partition function of the theories , which are thought be related by seiberg - like dualities , is the same .",
    "thus the situation is far more subtle .",
    "secondly , if we consider general @xmath30 theories , new subtleties arise since the conformal dimension and the corresponding @xmath31-charge of the fields , related by superconformal symmetry , can take nonconventional values in ir . until recently , it s not clear how to tackle this problem . in @xcite , jafferis proposes that the partition function on @xmath22 for a suitable superconformal field theory as a function of trial @xmath31 charges is extremized on the actual value of the r - charges of the underlying fields .",
    "along with this proposal , he writes down field theory action on @xmath22 with arbitrary @xmath31 charge of the underlying fields with the symmetry @xmath32 .",
    "see also @xcite .",
    "similar calculation was applied to an index computation in @xcite .",
    "certainly it s worthwhile to apply these proposals in a specific example and to see if this gives rise to the desired check for a given ads4/cft3 dual pair .    with the subtleties mentioned above",
    ", the goal of the paper is to work out index for the gravity / field theory pair with @xmath30 or @xmath28 susy .",
    "the first case study is done for the proposed theory for m2 branes on @xmath33 , which has @xmath28 supersymmetry .",
    "the proposed csm theory is given by abjm theory with flavors @xcite .",
    "see also @xcite for generalizations .",
    "since abjm theory has the gauge group @xmath34 one can have @xmath35 flavors for the first factor and @xmath36 flavors for the 2nd factor . in order to have moduli space @xmath33 we have the relation @xmath37 where @xmath20 are the chern - simons level for the gauge groups . in the type iia picture",
    "this theory is dual to type iia string theory on @xmath38 with d6-branes . at @xmath39 , the ` single d6-brane '",
    "is geometrized to @xmath4 .",
    "happily , we find the perfect matching of field theory / gravity index .",
    "furthemore , the index captures nicely the picture of @xmath40 with d6 branes at general @xmath24 so that additional contributions to the index can be ascribed to the string modes between different d6 branes . in terms of the index computation",
    ", @xmath28 field theory has less subtleties since we have firm control of f - terms and d - terms .",
    "this case study can be contrasted with the another case study of @xmath30 theory .    the next case studies concern on specific @xmath30 theories .",
    "as we mentioned , given an m - theory background on @xmath41 , there s no known algorithm to tell you which csm theories we have to consider . at this stage ,",
    "one should rely on trial and errors so that we will scan through the various theories which give rise to the desired moduli space .    for the case of @xmath42",
    ", there are many models suggested to describe m2-branes probing this background .",
    "we find that the best behaved model to be dual to the gravity on @xmath43 is the one obtained by adding four fundamental flavors to the @xmath6 chern - simons theory @xcite . @xcite .",
    "] during the comparison of the gauge theory and gravity indices , we realized that the gravity spectrum on @xmath44 obtained in @xcite has been cross - checked in a very limited subsector in the literature . among all the short @xmath45 multiplets listed in @xcite , we find that the large @xmath46 field theory index agrees with the gravity index only after getting rid of a few towers of multiplets ( which have not been cross - checked in the literature , as far as we are aware of ) . to conclusively check the validity of this model , one might have to carefully re - examine the results of @xcite .",
    "one may also recall the model constructed in @xcite for @xmath1 .",
    "we only made a preliminary study of the index of this model , which has as many complications as our next example @xmath2 has .",
    "a thorough study has not been made for the models of @xcite , but it could be that a study similar to our section 4 may reveal a similar structure .",
    "at least , we have checked that the index for the latter model disagrees with @xcite if we keep all multiplets claimed there .",
    "we also find that in the former model of @xcite , the trial r - charge does not appear in the large @xmath46 low energy spectrum ( as far as the index can see ) .",
    "for the case of @xmath2 models proposed in @xcite , we find two clearly distinguished contributions to the index .",
    "the first part , coming from a set of saddle points of the localization calculation , does not depend on the trial r - charge and completely reproduces the gravity index on @xmath47 .",
    "the second part , coming from the remaining saddle points , does depend on the trial r - charge and does not seem to correspond to any states on the gravity side .",
    "this may suggest that this model could not be correctly describing the desired gravity dual . however , see section 4 for the possible subtleties of the calculation and also for the possibility to construct a variant model to cure this discrepancy .",
    "the content of the paper is as follows ; after the introduction , in section 2 , we work out the index for field theory / gravity pair for @xmath33 and find perfect matching . in section 3 and 4 ,",
    "we carry out similar computation for @xmath1 and @xmath2 , respectively . in conclusion",
    "we enumerate the various future directions .    as this work",
    "is completed , we received the paper by imamura et al @xcite , where similar topic is covered . however",
    "the comparison with gravity side is lacking in their paper .",
    "the field theory dual proposed for m - theory on @xmath49 is given by the @xmath50 chern - simons theory coupled to two bifundamental hypermultiplets and @xmath35 , @xmath51 fundamental hypermultiplets in the first and second gauge group , respectively .",
    "as we shall review shortly below , the division of @xmath24 fundamental hypermultiplets into @xmath35 and @xmath36 has to do with the presence of two types of d6-branes wrapping @xmath52 in the gravity dual @xcite , with different @xmath53 valued wilson lines on the worldvolume .",

    "the gravity dual interpretation of this phenomena would be the absence of open string modes between d0-d6 branes of type iia theory on @xmath38 .",
    "also , apart from the last zero point energy factor @xmath93 , the integral is exactly the same as the @xmath94 of @xmath6 chern - simons index at large @xmath46 .",
    "the comparison of @xmath94 for the @xmath6 chern - simons theory and gravity on @xmath95 is studied in detail in @xcite .",
    "so all analytic and numerical results there could be used in our context to show the agreement of the index of this section . in the next subsection",
    ", we shall prove that the the agreement of the gauge - gravity large @xmath46 indices for the @xmath6 theory directly implies the agreement of the large @xmath46 index of our system for @xmath39 ..    from the absence of these fundamental degrees of freedom , the integrand in @xmath88 is invariant under the common shift of the holonomies @xmath73 , implying that it acquires contribution only from monopoles satisfying @xmath96 this decoupling of the diagonal @xmath60 in @xmath97 was an exact property in the @xmath6 chern - simons - matter theory , while here it is true only in the large @xmath46 limit .",
    "the complete kaluza - klein spectrum on @xmath98 was obtained in @xcite . to calculate the index , it suffices to consider the fields in the short multiplets .. this is obtained by decomposing @xmath99 representations into the representations of the conformal group , where each conformal representation comes from a 4 dimensional field .",

    "this shows the agreement in the neutral sector .    to study the sector with positive @xmath130 , one generally has to rely on numerical analysis like @xcite , as we do not know how to calculate holonomy integral ( [ formula for i ] ) analytically .",

    ", the fluxes should satisfy @xmath345 also , the magnetic charge @xmath346 for the first gauge group @xmath324 is to be identified with the cartan of the @xmath150 flavor symmetry at @xmath39 , which is explicit in the gravity side .",
    "we call this the @xmath56 ` baryon - like ' symmetry , again not to be confused withe the real baryon symmetry for wrapped m5-branes .    as our first goal is to study gravitons with @xmath250 numbers of magnetic flux",
    ", we consider the condition for the energy to remain @xmath250 .",
    "firstly , from the phase @xmath254 , it happens that there can appear @xmath347 number of phase variables in the exponent even with @xmath250 number of fluxes .",
    "this would cause gauge invariant operators to carry @xmath243 energy after integration . for",
    "this not to happen , one finds that @xmath348 has to be imposed , where the summations are over all nonzero fluxes in each gauge group .",
    "of course this is compatible with the flux restriction we imposed above .",
    "let us next investigate the possible @xmath243 contribution to @xmath71 . denoting by @xmath349 the number of zero magnetic fluxes in each gauge group",
    ", one finds @xmath350 when the condition ( [ o(1)-energy ] ) is met , the @xmath243 contribution always vanishes from @xmath315 .",
    "firstly , the expression ( [ i0-m32 ] ) for @xmath257 from field theory completely agrees with the gravity index @xmath351 coming from @xmath56 neutral particles , similar to the @xmath6 models and also the models studied in the previous sections .",
    "actually , when the large @xmath46 index is factorized into @xmath352 acquiring contribution from @xmath56 neutal sector , positive monopoles and negative monopoles , respectively , this agreement @xmath353 has to be the case .",
    "but as we shall see more concretely with examples , the index @xmath79 does not generally factorize to @xmath354 for separate saddle points ( i.e. monopole fluxes ) .",
    "below , we shall explain how such a factorization can appear _",
    "after _ summing over the saddle points .",
    "let us first phrase our claim , and then illustrate by many examples . for a given saddle point , we decompose nonzero magnetic charges @xmath321 into positive and negative ones , and call them @xmath355 , @xmath356 , respectively .",
    "we will set @xmath317 for the trial r - charge , which we shall motivate shortly with examples , so that the only independent parameter left is @xmath241 . define @xmath357 to be the sums of all positive / negative fluxes . defining @xmath358 to be the sum over all indices whose saddle points",
    "have given values of @xmath359 , @xmath360 , this quantity can be written as @xmath361 where @xmath362 refers to the index summed over the sectors whose energies do not depend on @xmath241 , and @xmath363 that does depend on @xmath241 . in both parts , being integers from the plethystic exponential structure .",
    "] we find that @xmath364 i.e. @xmath362 factorizes into two contribution which are identical to the multi - graviton index @xmath365 with @xmath56 charge @xmath359 coming from positively charged particles , and the index @xmath366 with charge @xmath367 coming from negatively charge particles .",
    "if , for some reason , one has to discard all the seemingly existing saddle points contributing to @xmath363 , then one finds from ( [ m32-factorize ] ) that the following factorization is allowed .",
    "labeling the index with its @xmath56 charge @xmath368 with the chemical potential @xmath152 , the above factorization implies @xmath369 @xmath94 and @xmath370 separately agrees with the gravity index coming from particles with positive / negative charges .    before proceeding , let us explain what could be the meaning of discarding / keeping @xmath363 .",
    "we have two possibilities in mind .",
    "firstly , quite naturally , if we seriously keep this contribution , this could simply be reflecting the fact that the proposed field theory is not the correct one for m - theory on @xmath47 , as the index captures extra branches of states other than those seen in the gravity .",
    "this looks a bit similar to the phenomenon observed in the so - called ` dual abjm ' model @xcite that extra branches of moduli spaces develop @xcite , although appearing here in a much more nontrivial way of showing two sectors in the index .",
    "as we shall explain in more detail below , the fluxes contributing to @xmath362 and @xmath363 have clear distinctions in their properties .",
    "so even though this model itself does not seem to be showing the correct gravity spectrum , it still sounds quite amazing that the known gravity contribution is so well organized as above .",
    "so we could hope that a small modification of the existing model could provide a much better index structure .",
    "one the other hand , let us also emphasize a potential subtlety of the localization calculation in quantum field theories which may justify discarding @xmath363 as unphysical .",
    "localization refers to a property of an integral with fermionic , or nilpotent , symmetry @xmath371 which makes the integral to acquire contribution only around the fixed points of the symmetry . in particular , a practical way of carrying out such integrals is to add to the integrand @xmath371-exact measures with free parameters , using which one can perform a gaussian evaluation of the exact result . the location of the fixed points of the symmetry in the integration domain could change during this deformation .",
    "this change of the fixed point profiles does not change the result _ as long as the saddle points do not disappear or appear _ during the deformation .",
    "this can happen if the integration domain is noncompact .",
    "a classic example of this sort appears in the calculation of the partition function of 2 dimensional topological yang - mills theory @xcite .",
    "the localization calculation of the index , or the path integral for the partition function of chern - simons - matter theory on @xmath303 in principle has the same issue when we introduce the yang - mills like deformation of @xcite .",
    "it is not easy to determine a priori which saddle points are to be kept and which to be discarded . in the case of @xmath6 theory ,",
    "originally some saddle points which appeared in the deformed theory of @xcite were not clearly understood in the qft without deformation .",
    "many of these saddle points were constructed later from the undeformed theory @xcite , justifying in the honest sense the prescription of @xcite .    in the present case of @xmath2 , the observation summarized above",
    "suggest that all saddle points which contain the undetermined trial r - charge parameter @xmath241 might have to be discarded as being unphysical ones .",
    "also , the possibility of discarding @xmath363 is not simply discarding all unwanted terms in the index , as the ambiguity mentioned above only allows one to keep or discard the whole contribution from a saddle point , not allowing to keep some term while discarding others . it should be interesting to see if this is the case or not for this model , using the qft on @xmath309 written down in @xcite with and without deformations",
    "now let us present examples which shows that our claims ( [ m32-decompose ] ) , ( [ m32-factorize ] ) are true in various sectors .",
    "the sector with @xmath372 is for smallest positive @xmath56 charge .",
    "inserting @xmath373 and @xmath374 , the field theory index is @xmath375 the result turns out to be extremely simple : @xmath376 . note that in this simple result , even the constant infinite series factor @xmath377 is canceled out , implying that there should be a large amount of cancelation between bosonic and fermionic operators .",
    "let us explain the first few terms to illustrate how to understand this number , and how the higher order cancelation is happening .",
    "we should suitably excite the fields to obtain the phase @xmath378 .",
    "there are two possible ways of obtaining it at the lowest energy @xmath379 .",
    "this is either by exciting scalars @xmath380 carrying @xmath381 phase which yields @xmath382 , or by exciting @xmath383 as @xmath384 with @xmath385 , yielding @xmath386 in total and explains the above result .",
    "one may further wonder what happens at higher orders .",
    "one can easily find that the phase can also be provided as @xmath387 by @xmath388}\\psi_{ak}$ ] with the index @xmath389 , and by @xmath390 with @xmath391 .",
    "so at this order , one obtains @xmath392 , where the second factor cancels the overall factor @xmath377 , consistent with our general computation .",
    "we should identify @xmath376 with suitable gravity states , which will give us a hint about the values of the r - charge @xmath313 , @xmath241 .",
    "obviously , there is a cancelation @xmath393 between bosonic and fermionic modes .",
    "as for the bosonic modes @xmath394 , it is easy to guess what are the true bps operators , as they are chiral rings .",
    "one simply symmetrizes all three @xmath106 indices , obtaining @xmath395 .",
    "so this should be part of the hypermultiplet with @xmath116 and su(3 ) representation @xmath396 .",
    "thus , we find @xmath397 , i.e. @xmath398 .",
    "this in turn implies that only one out of @xmath201 operators @xmath399 survive to be bps .",
    "it is easy to find what they are in the gravity dual .",
    "they are the fermions in the massless vector multiplet for @xmath150 symmetry , as the operator carries nonzero @xmath56 to be the @xmath150 cartan .",
    "therefore , only the @xmath106 singlet survives to be bps .",
    "in fact , summing over an infinite tower of all single gravity particles with @xmath56 charge @xmath200 , one obtains @xmath400 as shown in the previous subsection , agreeing with @xmath401 calculated above . more generally , with all chemical potentials @xmath148 kept",
    ", we have also checked that the integral ( [ ( 1)(1)(1 ) ] ) again completely reproduces the gravity index @xmath402 of ( [ gravity - m32 ] ) .",
    "to get a more nontrivial test of our claim , we investigate the sector with charge @xmath268 with @xmath403 and @xmath404 .",
    "we shall compare the index with the charge @xmath268 gravity index made of positively charge particles only .",
    "up to @xmath405 and for any trial r - charge @xmath241 , we find @xmath406 at @xmath407 , the first two contributions are the expected ones .",
    "the first is the single particle contribution with @xmath56 charge @xmath268 , from hypermultiplets scalars in @xmath408 and vector multiplet fermion in @xmath396 : @xmath409 .",
    "the second is simply the 2-particle states of the @xmath201 charge @xmath200 particles : @xmath410 . at higher orders ,",
    "the sum of the above indices is @xmath411 .    from the results summarized in the previous subsection , the single particle gravity index at charge @xmath268 and 2 particle index of charge @xmath200 particles",
    "are given by @xmath412 again after a vast cancelation of the infinite tower of graviton states , similar to the charge @xmath200 single particle index .",
    "although the expression is too messy to be recorded here , we report that we have also checked the agreement after keeping the @xmath106 chemical potentials @xmath148 .",
    "therefore , the positive flux part of the index agrees with the charge @xmath268 field theory index restricted to the positive fluxes up to @xmath413 , and we claim this happens to all orders .    to study more nontrivial sectors , we study the sector with @xmath56 charge @xmath200 with @xmath403 , @xmath414 . to classify the fluxes in this sector ,",
    "we denote by @xmath415 , @xmath416 , @xmath417 the sum over positive / negative fluxes in a gauge group .",
    "the conditions for decoupling overall @xmath60 and @xmath250 energy are @xmath418 these fluxes are again classified by a non - negative integer @xmath419 , with @xmath420 , @xmath421 . as the sector labeled by @xmath419 starts at the order @xmath422 , we study the saddle points with @xmath423 which corrects the @xmath424 sector ( positive flux only ) that we considered above .",
    "possible values of flux sums are @xmath425 the fluxes in the first case and the correspondinc indices are as follows : @xmath426 @xmath427 @xmath428 the @xmath429 fluxes in the second case are @xmath430 note the explicit appearance of the trial r - charge @xmath241 . at generic @xmath241 ,",
    "this does not cancel with any other term in the field theory index : for instance , the first term @xmath431 on the first line , which is larger than @xmath432 , can not combine with other terms listed above and below . in particular , for the field theory index to match with the gravity index including these sectors , @xmath241 has to be half an integer as the gravity spectrum of @xmath433 is all even .",
    "the fluxes in the last case are obtained by flipping the second and third fluxes .",
    "we find that , up to the order that we wish to check , these sectors all give zero contributions ( which might mean that they are identically zero ) : @xmath434 we want to compute the full index up to @xmath413 and show that this factorizes into the product of ` positive - flux part ' @xmath435 and ` negative - flux part ' @xmath436 after summing over all the saddle points with @xmath437 , @xmath438 . summing over @xmath439 saddle points with @xmath423 , one obtains @xmath440 where @xmath362 is the expression on the second line while @xmath363 is the expression on the last line containing the trial r - charge @xmath241 .",
    "the first parenthesis of the second line is from the first six saddle points with factorized indices , the second term from the next three with unfactorized indices , and the last line is from the next @xmath429 saddle points whose leading energy levels depend on the undetermined trial r - charge @xmath241 .",
    "it is easy to find that the first two contributions show a nontrivial cancelation and yield @xmath441 , and this agrees with the graviton index consisting of positive charged particles with net charge @xmath268 and negatively charged particles with charge @xmath305 , @xmath442 on the other hand , the @xmath363 contribution does not appear to correspond to anything in the gravity dual .",
    "especially , considering the allowed range @xmath443 from @xmath444 , the first term is or lower order than @xmath445 .",
    "as we have explained , if these saddle points are artifacts of our localization calculations introduced by unphysical saddle points ` flowing in from infinite ' @xcite , the remaining index completely agrees with the gravity index .",
    "this however requires a careful study , similar to @xcite .    at this stage ,",
    "let us comment that we empirically find from the the above saddle points a rule for the indices which do not contain @xmath241 .",
    "namely , in the first eight saddle points , if one decomposes the positive and negative fluxes into two , each of them separately satisfies the flux condition ( [ overall - decouple ] ) for the fluxes .",
    "note that this restriction turns out to pick up the factorizable saddle points only .",
    "we initiated the index computation of chern - simons matter theories with @xmath446 theories .",
    "we find the perfect matchings between the field theory index and the gravity index for @xmath28 theory , which describes m2 brane probing @xmath33 theory . on the other hand we find the several subtleties for @xmath30 models even with the impressive matching with the gravity index .",
    "for @xmath1 model , which is realized as flavored abjm model , the field theory index gives the definite prediction for the gravity index , which begs the reexamination of the kk spectrum of @xmath1 in the gravity side available in the literature .    for @xmath2 model ,",
    "the presence of odd number ( @xmath300 ) fermions in each bi - fundamental sector seems to pose a potential issue on whether this theory is consistent or not . at least in the context of dealing with qft on @xmath303 and partition function there",
    ", we find that appropriately restricting the magnetic charges of gauge fields in the overall @xmath60 s of @xmath294 s on @xmath447 makes the resulting partition function well - defined .",
    "this is basically due to shifting of chern - simons level for @xmath60 factors ( among others ) out of @xmath294 due to fermion determinant .",
    "it would be interesting to work out the structure of the potential mixed chern - simons terms .",
    "the comparison with the known gravity index is amazingly impressive but we face handling with the new saddle points .",
    "it could be important to understand this problem to understand better ads4/cft3 correspondence for vast classes of @xmath30 theories .",
    "even though we do not report our computation of the index for @xmath1 model suggested at @xcite , they are suffering from the same problems as our @xmath2 model has , i.e. , potential anomaly issues due to chiral fermions and new saddle points .",
    "now these problems are not appearing in the @xmath1 model @xcite we considered , we hope to construct new @xmath2 model free from such subtleties , yet giving the impressive matching with the gravity index , which our current @xmath2 model exhibits .",
    "we hope to report our progress in this direction in near future . however , we emphasize that final verdict on the current @xmath2 model has not been made yet .",
