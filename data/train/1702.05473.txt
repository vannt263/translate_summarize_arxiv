    "this viewpoint has the advantage that the one - dimensional case corresponds to a golomb ruler @xcite , and was subsequently studied in  @xcite . however , the associated generalization of a permutation to more than two dimensions is problematic when the number of dimensions is odd , and the classical constructions of costas arrays due to gilbert - welch and golomb ( see theorems  [ thm : gilbertwelch ] and  [ thm : golomb ] ) do not seem to generalize in a natural way .",

    "we may exclude reflections of @xmath39 when forming @xmath53 , because a reflection of a projection of a costas cube can be realized as a rotation of the cube .",
    "the size of @xmath53 is therefore at most  24 , although it can be smaller .",
    "for example , we find that as @xmath39 ranges over the order 6 costas cubes ( as determined by the method of section  [ sec : determination ] ) , the size of the set @xmath53 takes each value in @xmath55 .",
    "in particular , the set @xmath53 for the order 6 costas cube @xmath36 given by @xmath56\\ ] ] has size 4 : its elements comprise a single equivalence class of costas arrays whose corresponding permutations are @xmath57 , @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 .",
