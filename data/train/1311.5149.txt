    "in the early 80 s the experimental results of neutrino interaction with the matter attracted a lot of interest in attempts to determine the structure of neutral current interactions .",
    "for instance the production of a single @xmath0 in the reaction @xmath1 , became very interesting since detectors sometimes register only one of the decay photons , and this constituted a source of background to neutrino - electron scattering and for @xmath2 oscillation searches . by 1978 the aachen - padova collaboration @xcite measured the @xmath3 scattering and found an excess of showers .",
    "a few years later the reaction @xmath4 , the coherent emission of a photon in a neutrino - nucleus collision , was proposed in order to examine the extent to which the `` excess '' of showers seen in the aachen - padova experiment could be understood by this mechanism and by using the pcac ( partially conserved axial current ) hypothesis @xcite .",
    "studying the results of the aachen - padova experiment it was concluded that coherent photons could not account for the excess of events in the very forward direction ( @xmath5 ) @xcite . inspired by the idea of coherent emission of a photon and the pcac hypothesis , the coherent single @xmath0 production in neutrino reactions",
    "was introduced @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "the observation of coherent @xmath0 production in neutrinos was first reported in 1983 by the aachen - padova experiment @xcite .",
    "subsequent observations of the @xmath0 production were reported by the gargamelle collaboration @xcite followed by the charm collaboration @xcite .",
    "the bebc wa59 collaboration reported the @xmath7 production by antineutirnos @xcite , during the same month the skat collaboration observed for the frist time in one experiment all three states of the isospin triplet of the axial part of the weak charged and neutral currents @xcite .",
    "additional observations of coherent @xmath0 production where found in @xcite and @xcite and the latest measurement was reported by sciboone collaboration @xcite .",
    "coherent @xmath8 pion production where observed in @xcite and @xcite . however two recent measurements on the charged current case @xcite and @xcite with low energy neutrino beams , have not found evidence .",
    "the question arises if the effect is absent for the charged current reactions or it is suppressed by the kinematic , especially effects from the muon mass .",
    "in section [ sec : coh ] we present three pcac models pointing out advantages and shortcomings of the implementations for three pcac methods . in section",
    "[ sec : angular ] we use the formalism of references @xcite and @xcite in order to calculate angular distributions of the pions relative to the neutrino direction .",
    "we show the ability of models based on pcac to determine angular distributions of the produced pion relative to the neutrino direction for various value of @xmath9 the dependence in the polar angle @xmath10 and the azimuthal @xmath11 relative to the direction of the neutrino , peaks at small values of these variables .",
    "finally in section [ sec : summary ] we present our conclusions and give the cross section @xmath12 comparing two pcac models and averaging over the neutrino spectrum of the minerva experiment .",
    "the process of coherent pion production by neutrinos implies that the nucleus does not break up or alter its quantum numbers during the process .",
    "@xmath13 it follows from this that the momentum transfer to the nucleus can not be too large , otherwise a struck nucleon will be knocked out . because of this the coherent interactions are essentially diffractive , characterized by an exponentially falling momentum transfer to the nucleus distribution and a forward outgoing pion .",
    "the coherent cross section also depends on the atomic mass number of the nucleus .",
    "as we mentioned in section i the aachen - padova collaboration observed an excess of events localized in very forward directions of the neutrino interactions , so that coherent pion production by neutrinos becomes a natural candidate for explaining such interactions and at the same time providing a test for pcac hypothesis . in this section",
    "we present some of the coherent models based on pcac and their implications .",
    "another class of models introduces a microscopic picture for the production of the pions through diagrams in the delta resonances region , typically @xmath14(1232 ) @xcite and also includes background terms .",
    "they account for nuclear medium effects with a multiplicative factor , the fourier transform of the local density for protons and neutrons .",
    "there are various versions of these models with local approximation @xcite and without local approximation @xcite . in either case",
    "the models are valid at low energies @xmath15 2.0 gev . a review of the rein - sehgal @xcite , its use at low energies and a comparison with a microscopical calculation can be found in @xcite .",
    "the rein - sehgal model @xcite is often used as input model for monte carlo event generators like genie @xcite .",
    "the authors estimate the coherent cross section for neutral current using adler s pcac theorem @xcite and extended in the non - forward directions @xmath16 by adding a propagator term with an axial mass @xmath17 .",
    "the rein - sehgal triple differential cross section for the reaction ( [ cccoh ] ) is given by @xmath18 where @xmath19 , @xmath20 , @xmath21 is the momentum transfer - squared to the nucleus defined as @xmath22 , @xmath23 is the pion - nucleon cross section , @xmath24 denotes the nucleon mass , @xmath25 is the number of nucleons within the nucleus , @xmath26 defined as the ratio of the real to imaginary part of the forward pion - nucleon scattering amplitude @xmath27 , @xmath28 , @xmath29 with @xmath30 the nuclear radius and @xmath31 given by @xmath32 later on the authors in @xcite made an attempt to reconcile their model with the data from @xcite by taking into account the mass of the muon as a simple multiplicative correction factor @xmath33 where @xmath34 with the range @xmath35 where @xmath36 lies between @xmath37 and @xmath38 . thus the new result is given by @xmath39 which according to the authors in @xcite gives a 25@xmath40 suppression of the cross section caused by a destructive interference of the axial vector and pseudoscalar amplitudes .",
    "there is an updated version of the original rein - sehgal model and its extension to charged current reactions made by berger and sehgal @xcite , where instead of using models for pion nucleus scattering as used in @xcite , the available data on pion - carbon scattering are implemented in the numerical analysis .",

    "another contribution of the authors in @xcite is to replace the original phenomenological expression of the differential pion nucleus scattering with the ansatz    @xmath47    with energy dependent coefficients @xmath48 , @xmath49 which are listed in table i of reference @xcite . even though these authors claim to include muon mass effects the product @xmath50 in eq .",
    "( [ bs_eq ] ) neglects the mass of the muon .",
    "another model especially suited for charged current coherent scattering has been developed by kartavtsev , paschos and gounaris @xcite and extended by paschos and schalla @xcite .",
    "as in the previous model @xmath51 scattering data are used .",
    "this model incorporates the pion - nucleus cross section into the neutrino scattering and uses the lepton mass exactly .",
    "@xmath52 with @xmath53 the magnitude of the ckm matrix elements , @xmath54 being the elastic pion - nucleus cross section and @xmath55 .",
    "the authors parametrized the elastic pion nucleus cross section also with eq .",
    "( [ bs_anatz ] ) , fitting the parameters @xmath56 and @xmath57 to the @xmath58 elastic scattering data .",

    "( [ bs_eq ] ) and is proportional to it when we neglect the lepton mass .",
    "taking the divergence of the spin averaged matrix element and invoking pcac hypothesis , the authors write the matrix element of the axial current as the sum of the pion pole and remaining contribution and estimated the matrix element .",
    "the corresponding neutral current cross section is @xmath63 in this formula the muon mass in @xmath64 must to be set zero .",
    "the three approaches start from the same physical motivation and rely on the principe of applying pcac .",
    "they arrive at results which differ because they implement different methods .",
    "the differences occur at low neutrino energies and disappear for energies higher than 3.0 gev .",
    "it is important to find out for charged current reactions whether coherent scattering occurs and at which level .",
    "we calculate the angular distribution of the pion relative to the neutrino direction , which can be used to separate the signal from the incoherent background .",
    "the angular dependence of the process is very characteristic and it should be helpful for separating the signal from the background .",
    "we define a right - handed coordinate system with the neutrino direction along the z - axis fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram]a . the weak current lies on the x - z plane and makes an angle @xmath65 relative to the direction of the neutrino .",
    "thus the x - z plane will be called the lepton plane , since the muon also lies on this plane .",
    "the coordinates of the @xmath66 relative to the neutrino direction is defined by the polar angle @xmath10 and the azimuthal @xmath11 ; and relative to @xmath67 are defined by @xmath68 and @xmath69 respectively .",
    "the vector @xmath66 and its projections to @xmath70 and @xmath67 define a tetrahedron , shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram]b with two right angles . in this coordinate system @xmath71 and",
    "@xmath72 the momentum transfer squared between the neutrino and the muon @xmath73 and in the limit @xmath74 is approximated by @xmath75    the geometry of the tetrahedron fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram]b gives useful relations .",
    "for instance , the angle @xmath69 is related to the others by @xmath76 and the three vectors @xmath77 and @xmath66 satisfy the addition theorem @xmath78 similarly , the momentum transfer to the nucleus is given by @xmath79 the original cross section in eq .",
    "( [ ps_eq5 ] ) is isotropic on the rotation around the vector @xmath67 . to convert the variables of the pion around the neutrino direction , we calculate the jacobian @xmath80 with @xmath81 given in the appendix .",
    "the two cross section are related @xmath82 they lead to the result @xmath83    among the terms in the curly brackets the largest contribution comes from the term @xmath62 ( helicity zero contribution ) .",
    "this is clear by looking at the numerical values of the three density - matrix elements which we calculated and present in table [ table ] in the appendix .    as a first presentation of numerical results",
    "we consider the case when the pion lies on the leptonic plane , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath84 , for this case the jacobian is given by @xmath85        the simple geometry gives the relation @xmath86 which permits a simple change of variables from @xmath65 to @xmath68 .",
    "for the pion - carbon cross section we use the functional form eq .",
    "( [ bs_anatz ] ) and the numerical values for @xmath56 and @xmath57 are taken from the table i in ref .",
    "@xcite . for values of @xmath87 1.046 gev",
    "the pion - carbon cross section was extrapolated as constant _ i.e. _ using the last numerical value given by @xcite . keeping the leading term @xmath62 we have @xmath88 we carried out the integration numerically imposing at every step the @xmath89 condition @xmath90 , that was introduced by the authors in @xcite .",
    "this condition is important and must be used in all models .",
    "we consider the following physical situation ; we keep the energy and angles of the pion , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath10 and @xmath11 , fixed and sum over the directions of the current .",
    "this is equivalent to the integration over the angle @xmath65 with the appropriate limits .",
    "we obtained angular distributions for neutrino energies e=1 , 3 , 5 , 10 gev and values of @xmath91 = 0.260 , 0.400 , 0.864 gev for @xmath11 = 0 .",
    "we present the results in fig .",
    "[ fig : triple_phi0 ] .",
    "we notice that the cross section is concentrated at small values of @xmath10 ; in fact for @xmath92 there are hardly any events .",
    "the sharp dependence on @xmath10 reflects the sharp peak of the pion - carbon cross section .",
    "this is also the characteristic peaking observed in the early experiments reviewed in the introduction . for fixed @xmath93 the distribution in @xmath10 becomes sharper as @xmath91 increases .",
    "we want to point out that the sharp decrease of @xmath94 within the integrand depends on the value of @xmath57 and influences the normalization and not so much the shape of the curves .",
    "the cross section we present in figures [ fig : triple_phi0 ] , [ fig : triple_phi ] have absolute normalizations which change when we change the input pion - carbon data .",
    "the @xmath11 dependence is also very peaked at small values of @xmath11 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : triple_phi ] we show curves for three values of @xmath95 and @xmath96 it is evident that most of the pions are produced in the lepton plane in the opposite side from the muon relative to the neutrino .",
    "this is what was expected because the pions in this configuration are closer to the vector @xmath67 and making the @xmath97 variable small .",
    "it is interesting to compare our results with experimental data , however the lack of data makes it difficult . in ref .",
    "@xcite fig .",
    "8a gives an azimuthal distribution , for @xmath98 gev@xmath99 but their variable @xmath11 is different from our definition because they define it relative to the direction of @xmath67 . in our definition @xmath11",
    "is relative to the neutrino direction . besides the different definitions a quantitative comparison is still possible because their case for @xmath100 corresponds to the configuration where the pion is between the neutrino and the current , which is also our configuration for @xmath11= 0 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : diagram ] ) . independently of the differences",
    "both cases peak at @xmath84 which is encouraging .",
    "another experiment , sciboone @xcite , presented a @xmath101 distribution for @xmath102 where the data shows a peak around @xmath103 .",
    "the main background for coherent scattering consists of events where the nucleus breaks up with a pion and a proton or neutron knocked out but still remaining undetected .",
    "the scattering in this case takes place on single nucleons and the kinematics for the reaction are different .",
    "in addition both vector and axial currents contribute as well as their interference term .",
    "the @xmath21 dependence of the new process is again exponential but with a much smaller value for @xmath57 .",
    "the net effect is a @xmath10 dependence that extents to larger values of the angle .",
    "coherent pion production by neutrinos was studied for cc and nc reactions with special attention to conditions that must be satisfied at lower energies . in this work we summarized formulas and then extended them by calculating angular distributions in the polar angle @xmath10 and azimuthal angle @xmath11 .",
    "the physical configurations we considered correspond to the selection of a specific energy @xmath91 and specific direction of the pion relative to the neutrino direction ( specified by fixed values of @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) ; then we integrated over the direction of the momentum @xmath67 ( momentum of the weak current ) keeping the energy @xmath104 equal to the @xmath91 as required for coherent scattering .",
    "we found a very sharp peak in the variable @xmath10 and also peaking in @xmath11 where small values of @xmath11 are preferred .",
    "in addition we computed the differential cross section @xmath12 by integrating over @xmath91 up to 3.0 gev using again data from ref .",
    "@xcite and for values of @xmath105 gev the pion - carbon cross section was extrapolated using the last numerical values in table 1 of @xcite .",
    "the results for the charged and neutral currents are shown with solid curves in fig .",

[",
    "fig : triple_phi ] ) for this reason the change in @xmath12 is very small .",
    "we also computed the same cross section for the model @xcite as it is implemented in the neutrino event generator genie @xcite by integrating over @xmath91 up to 3.0 gev and averaged over the minerva flux .",
    "the results are shown as dotted curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : ds_dcos ] . in both cases , cc and nc ,",
    "our results prefer small angles .",
    "we note that the integrated rein - seghal cross section in fig .",
    "[ fig : ds_dcos ] for cc is 61@xmath40 larger than our cross section and has a long tail ; for the nc case the rein - seghal is 48@xmath40 larger . as we mentioned earlier ,",
    "the sciboone experiment gave only an upper bound for cc coherent scattering ; in addition to that it also reported event distributions for various angles .",
    "for @xmath108 there is an excess of events above the estimated background concentrated at small values of @xmath11 ( see fig . 6 in @xcite ) .",
    "in addition to that our results are consistent within two standard deviations with the bounds reported by sciboone experiment @xcite .    on the experimental frontier the minerva experiment , with a fully active detector , is searching for coherent scattering @xcite , and is expected that it will bridge the gap between the recent measurements at low energy and early measurements at higher energies on a wide range of nuclear targets .",
    "liquid argon tpcs ( time projection chambers ) should be able to observe nuclear stubs and eliminate most incoherent backgrounds from coherent pion production searches , as was done in bubble chamber experiments . at the end",
    "we can expect multiple experiments searching for coherent scattering with multiple detection techniques and many nuclei as targets .",
