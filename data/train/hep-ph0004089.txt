    "recently there have been intensive studies to test the deviations from the standard model ( sm ) at present and future colliders .",
    "the investigation of three gauge boson couplings plays an important role to manifest the non abelian gauge symmetry in standard electroweak theory .",
    "the precision measurement of the triple vector boson vertices will be the crucial test of the structure of the sm .",
    "it is known that present collider measurements at lep2@xcite and tevatron@xcite can not probe anomalous triple gauge boson self couplings to precision better than o(@xmath5 ) .",
    "further analyses of @xmath6 vertex has been given by several papers for ep collider hera @xcite , projected future colliders lhc@xcite and linear electron - positron collider ( lc)@xcite . after lc is constructed @xmath7 , @xmath8 , linac - ring type @xmath9 and @xmath10 modes should be discussed and may work as complementary to basic colliders .",
    "the linear collider design at desy @xcite is the only one that can be converted into an ep @xcite collider .",
    "@xmath10 collider mode is an additional advantage of this linac - ring type ep collider @xcite where real gamma beam is obtained by the compton backscattering of laser photons off linear electron beam .",
    "estimations show that the luminosity for @xmath0p collision turns out to be of the same order as the one for ep collision due to the fact that @xmath11 where @xmath12 and @xmath13 are transverse sizes of proton and photon bunches at collision point .",
    "since most of the photons are produced at high energy region in the compton backscattering the cross sections are about one order of magnitude larger than parental ep collider for photoproduction processes . according to present project at desy 500 gev electrons from linear electron beam",
    "are allowed to collide 820 gev protons from hera ring@xcite .",
    "parameters of this lc+herap and its @xmath0p option are shown in table [ tab1 ] @xcite .",
    "therefore such kind of high energy @xmath0p colliders will possibly give additional information to linac - ring type ep colliders for a variety of processes@xcite .",
    "in this paper we examine the potential of future lc+herap based @xmath0p collider to probe anomalous ww@xmath0 coupling and compare the results with those from its basic ep collider and other projected future colliders .",
