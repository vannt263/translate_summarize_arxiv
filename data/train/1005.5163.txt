    "pulsar timing arrays ( ptas ) @xcite are a practical means of observing gravitational waves ( gws ) associated with supermassive ( @xmath0 ) black holes , or more generally gws in the nanohertz to microhertz regime arising from any source @xcite .",
    "a pta is a collection of low timing noise pulsars timed to high accuracy .",
    "in such a timing array , gws may signal their presence through correlated disturbances in measured pulse arrival times . over the last decade ,",
    "assessments of expected gw source strengths have remained steady @xcite while the number of pulsars that can be timed to high precision has increased , and instrumentation , observing technique , and timing precision of known pulsars have all improved @xcite .",
    "detection of gws via pulsar timing is now within striking distance .",
    "properly made strategic choices for observing and/or improving the timing precision of current array pulsars , and searching for new pulsars , can hasten the arrival of the day when the first detection is made and the field of gw astronomy is properly inaugurated .",
    "strategic optimization depends upon your strategy .",
    "do you want to detect single sources , or a stochastic background ?",
    "do you want to maximize the number of sources detected , or maximize the signal - to - noise ratio ( snr ) of the sources that you do detect ?",
    "here we investigate the sensitivity of a pta to a single source of gws and investigate optimization strategies that maximize the number of sources detected .",
    "we describe the results of a preliminary investigation into strategies for deploying limited observing time among current array pulsars , and for searching for new pulsars to augment the current array .",
    "our results apply to the search for single sources of gws@xcite , not to stochastic background searches @xcite .    after an introduction of the pta single - source sensitivity calculation and nanograv",
    "characteristics in  2 , we discuss in  3 the consequences of adding pulsars to the array .",
    "further , discussed in  4 , is the preliminary study of pulsar timing allocation time . finally , in  5",
    ", we discuss the implications that rise from this study and suggest future research .",
    "anticipated gw sources in the nhz-@xmath1hz band include nearby supermassive black hole binary and triplet systems @xcite .",
    "more speculative sources include a primordial stochastic background and bursts from cosmic string cusps and kinks @xcite .",
    "all these sources are expected to be isotropically distributed on the sky .",
    "correspondingly we choose to estimate the sensitivity of ptas as the spatial volume within which a fiducial source would give an snr greater than a fixed threshold .",
    "such a measure can be made independent of the threshold ( but not the fiducial source ) by referring the calculated volume to a reference volume calculated for a reference array . in this way",
    "we define the relative overall sensitivity @xmath2 of a pta as :    @xmath3    where @xmath4 is the distance out to which the pta is sensitive to a source propagating in direction @xmath5 relative to the reference pta denoted with a subscript @xmath6 .",
    "the limit @xmath7 is the number of directions along which sensitivity is being measured and can be chosen by the user according to the desired resolution of the resulting sensitivity map . in the maps we constructed in this paper we used healpix to construct pixels representing equal surface area , and @xmath8 .",
    "the distance to a fiducial gw source in a fixed direction is inversely proportional to its amplitude snr @xmath9 as observed in a pta .",
    "correspondingly , we may use the amplitude snr of a fiducial source ( assuming we have measured the optimal snr ) as a surrogate for the distance of the source @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the distance to the source when its anticipated snr is @xmath9 , its propagation direction is @xmath12 , and @xmath13 is the amplitude snr of the fiducial source at distance @xmath14 .",
    "timing noise for typical pta pulsars is typically white on timescales less than 510 years and red on longer timescales @xcite .",
    "the white contribution to the timing noise is characterized by its root mean square ( rms ) residual @xmath15 . for our approximate analysis here",
    "we ignore the red timing noise contribution and assume , for each pta pulsar , white timing noise characterized by @xmath15 for pulsar @xmath16 , and that a single @xmath15 characterizes the entire observation .    with this timing noise approximation the contribution from pulsar @xmath16 to the pta power snr in direction",
    "@xmath12 is @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the anticipated gw contribution to the residuals in pulsar @xmath16 from a gw source propagating in direction @xmath12 at time @xmath19 .",
    "the anticipated power snr @xmath20 of the whole array to sources propagating in direction @xmath12 is the sum over the pulsars @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the number of pulsars .",
    "armed with this equation , we set off to find @xmath18 .",
    "the timing residuals @xmath23 associated with tt - gauge gw metric perturbation @xmath24 may be written as @xmath25 where @xmath26 is a unit vector pointing to pulsar @xmath16 , @xmath27 is the distance to that pulsar , and @xmath12 is the direction of propagation of the gw .",
    "@xmath28 are given by @xmath29 where @xmath30 denotes the transpose of @xmath31 , and @xmath32 and @xmath33 are the two independent gravitational wave polarization basis tensors , @xmath34 functions @xmath35 and @xmath36 are integrals of @xmath37 and @xmath38 as follows @xcite : @xmath39 note that we are using geometrized units where @xmath40 .",
    "we have essentially broken up @xmath41 into terms that depend on geometry ( @xmath42 s ) and terms that depend on time ( @xmath43 s ) .",
    "following @xcite we assume that a function @xmath44 exists for which @xmath45 we can then do the integral as follows : @xmath46 the first term is the so - called ` earth term ' , and the second the ` pulsar term'@xcite .",
    "the pulsar term is delayed from the earth term by @xmath47 which amounts to hundreds to thousands of years in most cases . for the moment , assume that we are dealing with burst sources whose length is shorter than our observation time ( years ) for which we only observe the earth term , and that we can thereby ignore the pulsar term .",
    "later we will show that the result we derive here holds for continuous sources , when the pulsar term must be included , as well .",
    "@xmath48 depends on time , so what we desire is the time averaged snr , @xmath49 , i.e. the time average of equation [ eq : rho2 ] .",
    "we square equation [ eq : tauj ] and average over time and all possible polarizations @xmath37 and @xmath38 .",
    "the cross - term @xmath50 vanishes when we average over all polarizations . also by averaging over all polarizations",
    "we find @xmath51 .",
    "finally , exploiting time translation symmetry we can write @xmath52 where @xmath53 is a constant independent of the pulsar line - of - sight @xmath26 or the propagation direction of the gws @xmath12 .    combining equations [ eq : r0 ] , [ eq : rho2 ] , [ eq : f+ ] , [ eq : fx ] and [ eq : rho2barj ] we have our principal result @xmath54 the steps between equations 14 and 15 can be done for any @xmath12 , but the result in equation 15 can be seen more readily by assuming the gw is traveling in the @xmath55 direction which gives @xmath56 @xmath57 and assuming an arbitrary pulsar direction @xmath58 $ ] .",
    "the numerator in the sum in equation 14 becomes ( after some algebra and trigonometry ) @xmath59 .",
    "for an arbitrary gw direction , @xmath12 , the numerator generalizes to @xmath60 .",
    "in other words , the quantity that matters is the projection of the pulsar direction vector onto the direction of propagation of the gw .    equation 16 will allow us to compare various ptas independently of the details of the input source ( @xmath61 and @xmath62 as shown in equation [ eq : tauj ] ) and then putting this into equation [ eq : distance ] : @xmath63 where @xmath64 refers to the reference pta , and , as in equation [ eq : distance ] , the @xmath7 is the resolution of the calculation , i.e. the number of pixels in the map of @xmath65 .",
    "@xmath2 is what we are calling the ` volume sensitivity ' and represents the ratio of the volumes to which two different ptas are sensitive .    a related quantity which we will utilize later , @xmath66 , represents the comparison of the sensitivity of two arrays as a function of the gw propagation direction @xmath12 , @xmath67 note that rather than plotting @xmath68 as a function of gw propagation direction @xmath12 we will plot @xmath69 where @xmath70 is the direction of the gw source in the sky , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the quantity @xmath73 lends itself to interpretation as the pta _ antenna pattern : _",
    "i.e. , it is proportional to the signal power absorbed by the detector from a source propagating in the direction @xmath12 , measured relative to the source direction for which the greatest power is absorbed . as with @xmath68 , @xmath74 .",
    "figure 1 shows `` source - averaged '' antenna pattern @xmath75 for the nanograv pta , whose member pulsars and their rms timing residuals at the time of writing are provided in table 1 .",
    "we have also made available a web - based tool for computing sensitivity maps for an arbitrary array of pulsars at this url .",
    "as evident from figure  [ fig : nano ] the sensitivity of the nanograv pta is heavily biased to the region between 12 and 24 hours right ascension , yet fairly symmetric about the equatorial plane .",
    "not surprisingly this region represents both the highest concentration of pulsars and also the location of the lowest noise pulsars .    rather than average over all possible gws propagating in direction",
    "@xmath12 we can restrict attention to any particularly interesting class of sources .",
    "consider , for example , the radiation from a circular binary consisting of two supermassive black holes . for systems like these",
    "the radiation is approximately periodic over any reasonable observational timescale @xcite and @xmath76,\\ ] ] where @xmath77 is the gw angular frequency . even in the best of circumstances pulsar distances",
    "are known to no better than 10% @xcite , in which case the phase @xmath78 is uncertain by many times @xmath79 for @xmath77 of interest . if we average @xmath41 over the typical uncertainty in distance we find the contribution owing to the term involving @xmath27 , the pulsar term , vanishes and we are left with @xmath80 which , averaged over time , tends to 0.5 , a constant .",
    "_ as long as the uncertainty in pulsar distance is greater than the light travel time over the duration of the observation these same considerations will hold for any source that a pta can detect : _",
    "i.e. , averaged over the uncertainty in pulsar distances the pulsar term contribution to @xmath81 will vanish and we can again ignore the second term on the right - hand side of equation [ earth_and_pulsar_terms ] as we did to obtain the result shown in equations 16 . note that in the case of @xmath82 the earth and the pulsar terms exactly cancel and the sensitivity @xmath83 as is shown in equation [ principal_result ] .",
    "adding a new pulsar to an existing array increases the array s overall sensitivity .",
    "equation [ eq : nu ] shows how the array s sensitivity increases as a function of a new pulsar s sky location and timing residual noise rms .",
    "while we do not have the freedom to choose where we will find the next good millisecond pulsar , we do have the freedom to choose where we will look . with this in mind",
    "we consider how the sensitivity of the nanograv pta would be increased by the addition of a single pulsar whose timing residual noise of 200 ns rms is equal to the current array s median .",
    "figure  [ fig : addwherecomp ] shows the sensitivity @xmath2 as calculated using equation [ eq : nu ] as a function of the location of an addition to the nanograv pta of a single pulsar with 200 ns timing noise rms . as is confirmed by the figure , an additional pulsar will improve the pta sensitivity regardless of its location on the sky , but the improvement represents less than a 6% increase in sensitivity volume ( the volume of space from which we can detect sources ) in all cases .",
    "however , some pulsar locations will improve it more than others .",
    "an additional pulsar in the region in which the pta is already most sensitive improves the sensitivity volume the greatest .",
    "this seems appropriate considering that the volume of sensitivity goes as @xmath84 .",
    "so , if a distance that is already large is doubled , the volume increase will be a larger factor than if a small distance were doubled . however , the volume sensitivity varied by only 6% as we moved the additional pulsar all over the sky , so it may be wisest to search where one is most likely to find pulsars , such as in the galactic plane .",
    "one aspect which has not been addressed in this manuscript is the coherence of the gw signal between pulsars , i.e. the fact that pulsars in similar directions in the sky will show higher correlation between their gw signals than those in different parts of the sky ( see eq .",
    "[ earth_and_pulsar_terms ] ) .",
    "in addition , in order to confirm that the detected signal is a gw and not , for example , an error in earth s ephemerides , or a terrestrial clock , we will need pulsars in different parts of the sky to confirm that the spatial signature of the detected signal is quadrupolar in nature and not dipolar ( ephemerides error ) or monopolar ( clock error ) .",
    "further study which includes these considerations is necessary to determine the optimum strategy .",
    "the nanograv pta at the time of writing involves 19 pulsars whose timing residuals range from 54 ns to 2.2 @xmath1s . monitoring each pulsar",
    "requires some fraction of the available observing time , which is a valuable resource . how should the available observing time be distributed among the different pulsars to optimize the nanograv pta s sensitivity ? to explore this question we divide the nanograv pta pulsars into  low - noise \" ( timing residual noise less than 200 ns ) andhigh - noise \" ( timing residual noise greater than 200 ns ) groups , and evaluate the array sensitivity when we increase the fraction of observing time spent on low - noise pulsars at the expense of high - noise pulsars , and vice versa .    for a typical timing array pulsar the rms timing residual noise , @xmath85 ,",
    "is inversely proportional to the square - root of the time spent observing the pulsar , i.e. , @xmath86 @xcite .",
    "the current nanograv timing program spends an approximately equal amount of time on each pulsar in the array .",
    "we consider two alternatives : spending twice as much observing time on pulsars in the high - noise group as on pulsars in the low - noise group , and the opposite case of twice as much observing time on pulsars in the low - noise group as on pulsars in the high - noise group .",
    "this translates to the observing time of one group being multiplied by @xmath87 while the observing time of the other group is multiplied by @xmath88 .",
    "this , as rms and @xmath19 are related above , results in an decrease in rms of the first group by @xmath89 and an increase in rms of the second group by @xmath90 .",
    "( in both cases the time spent observing the single pulsar with timing residual noise of exactly 200 ns is left fixed . )",
    "figure  [ fig : improvewhat ] shows the change in volume sensitivity enacted by these adjustments as a function of gw propagation direction , @xmath70 .",
    "what we plot is @xmath69 where the reference array in the denominator ( see equation [ eq : nuk ] ) consists of the nanograv pulsars shown in table [ table : pulsarlist ] .",
    "the array used in the numerator is one in which the adjustments described above have been assumed .",

    "the key to understanding this result is in noting that snr @xmath9 , residual response @xmath93 and rms @xmath85 are related to each other approximately as follows @xmath94 and @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the amplitude of the residual at earth when the source is at distance @xmath97 .",
    "therefore @xmath98 or for a fixed snr @xmath9 required for detection , the distance out to which we could detect a source , @xmath4 , is inversely proportional to the rms @xmath85 @xmath99 the argument then is similar to that which we made in  3 , that volume sensitivity goes as @xmath84 so halving an already small rms @xmath85 increases the volume sensitivity by a much larger factor than halving a larger rms @xmath85 . 0.5 in    we can use the same formalism to determine the value of adding more pulsars to the array and can use it to ascertain the value of the international pulsar timing array ( ipta ) a collaboration formed of nanograv , the ppta and the the european pulsar timing array ( epta ) . in table",
    "[ table : pulsarlist ] below the nanograv pulsars we have shown the parkes pulsar timing array pulsars , not including those overlapping with nanograv , as published in the status paper by @xcite .",
    "if solely psr j0437 - 4715 is added to the nanograv array , the volume sensitivity increases by 7% .",
    "if all the ppta pulsars listed are added to the nanograv array , the volume sensitivity increases by 10% .",
    "if instead we imagine an improved situation in which the ppta pulsars listed are added with 200ns rms , with the exception of psr j0437 - 4715 which we add at its actual rms of 100 ns , the volume sensitivity is increased by 35% , ie 35% more volume of space is sampled for the same gw source type . at the time of writing the european pulsar timing array ( epta ) pulsars for which rmss are available@xcite are already included in this list .",
    "their typical rmss are slightly higher than the values shown here , but there are several reasons to expect that within a year the epta rmss will be markedly reduced and that the pulsars will contribute significantly to this list .",
    "first , the large european array of pulsars ( leap ) project which expects first light in late 2010 will create a ",
    "tied - array \" mode for the 5 european 100-m class dishes into a single instrument , rivaling the sensitivity of arecibo , but with larger sky coverage .",
    "furthermore , the data reported on by @xcite represent new instrumentation at all 5 telescopes , so one can expect significant improvement with characterization and optimization of those instruments .",
    "given the goal to directly detect gws , the optimization of pulsar timing arrays should be well understood .",
    "figure  [ fig : addwherecomp ] suggests that for the sake of gw detection we may not need to  fill in \" regions of the sky currently devoid of pta pulsars , but that rather a clustering of good pulsars in one region yields the gratest number of detectable gw sources .",
    "the figure shows the sensitivity ( volumetric ) gain produced by adding a new pulsar to the array as a function of the location of the added pulsar .",
    "the current pulsars in the array are clustered around 18h right ascension and 0 declination ( as shown by green diamonds on the figure ) and in fact the greatest improvement in the volume to which the array is sensitive is produced by adding a new pulsar near that already existing cluster of pulsars , although the range of improvement is modest in all cases ( from improving it not at all to improving it by 6% ) . here",
    "we suggest that if the goal is to maximize the volume of space to which we are sensitive to gw sources the location with highest concentration of pulsars is slightly favored over other locations , but does not make a significant difference .",
    "so perhaps efforts to `` fill in the gaps '' in the spatial arrangements of ptas are unfounded . however , any new pulsar , regardless of its location , is beneficial to the scientific community . continuing research is needed on this particular area to optimize pulsar searches for pta goals .",
    "our initial findings indicate that the sensitivity to burst and continuous gws can be significantly improved by observing longer the pulsars for which we already have good timing values . in other words",
    ", it is found that the intuitive thing to do , observing longer the pulsars that we do not have good timing values for , significantly decreases our sensitivity to gws by almost 50% ( figure  [ fig : improvewhat ] ) .",
    "this suggestion taken to an extreme yields the ridiculous result that it is best to spend all observing time on a signal pulsar .",
    "the sensitivity plot in this case would be the familiar beam pattern of a single pulsar , but if somehow gws could be detected with a single pulsar , spending all our time on this one best pulsar , assuming the rms reduces as the square - root of observing time , would in fact maximize the volume of space to which we are sensitive .",
    "we discussed in  [ add_a_pulsar ] that this strategy neglects issues with confirming the detection as distinct from clock , ephemerides , and other errors , so more work must be done to optimize observing strategies , but this work clearly indicates that convention may not be the best means to a discovery .",
    "in particular , as the pta is being optimized , what should the observing strategy be ? is the answer different depending on whether our aim is to detect single sources or a stochastic background .",
    "presented here is a crucial first step toward answering these questions .",
    "this research was carried out at both franklin and marshall college and pennsylvania state university .",
    "we wish to express gratitude for the use of facilities at each .",
    "we also wish to thank matt kinsey for his matlab interface to healpix , and hannah williams and diego menendez for their assistance in developing a web interface to the sensitivity calculations for an arbitrary pta .",
