    "in two preceding papers@xcite we have considered the critical statics and relaxational dynamics of @xmath0 physical systems near the multicritical point where the two phase transition lines of the system corresponding to @xmath6-symmetry and @xmath7-symmetry meet .",
    "the space of the order parameter ( op ) dimensions @xmath8 and @xmath9 decomposes in regions where the multicritical behavior is described by different fixed points ( fps ) - the @xmath10- isotropic fp , the biconical fp , the decoupling fp - and a region where no stable fp is found ( run away region ) ( see fig 1 in ref.@xcite ) . in the resummed two loop order field",
    "theoretic treatment it was found that for integer values of @xmath8 and @xmath9 the biconical fp is stable only for a system with @xmath4 , @xmath5 , and its symmetric counterpart . for specific initial conditions of the nonuniversal parameters of the system also the @xmath10- isotropic fp ( heisenberg fp )",
    "might be reached .",
    "such a system is physically represented by an antiferromagnet in an external magnetic field .",
    "the two cases mentioned above correspond to tetracritical and bicritical multicritical points correspondingly .",
    "if no fp is reached the multicritical point might be of first order , i.e. a triple point .",
    "the dynamics of the antiferromagnet in a magnetic field is quite complicated and the equations of motion have been formulated for the slow densities by dohm and janssen@xcite .",
    "these eqs . contain reversible and irreversible coupling terms between the ops ( the components of the staggered magnetization parallel and perpendicular to the magnetic field ) and one conserved density ( the parallel component of the magnetization ) .",
    "in fact there is a second conserved density ( cd ) - the energy density - which in general should be taken into account but it will not be included here since in two loop order the specific heat exponent at the biconical fp turned out to be negative @xcite for the case @xmath4 and @xmath5 . concerning the new static results@xcite a simplified dynamical model@xcite has been reconsidered@xcite consisting of two relaxational equations for the two op .",
    "the timescale ratio @xmath11 between the two relaxation rates @xmath12 and @xmath13 introduces a very small dynamical transient since the dynamical fp lies very near to the stability boundary separating strong and weak dynamical scaling .",
    "the strong dynamical scaling fp is governed by @xmath14 finite and different from zero whereas the weak dynamical scaling fp by @xmath15 correspondingly .",
    "a further step to the complete model is to include the diffusive dynamics of the slow cd leading to a model c like extension . in this extended model",
    "a new timescale ratio appears defined by the ratio of one of the op - relaxation rate to the kinetic coefficient @xmath16 of the conserved density @xmath17 .",
    "this model has been studied in one loop order in refs @xcite taking into account only a part of dynamical two loop order terms and one loop statics . here",
    "we present a complete two loop order calculations .",
    "the inclusion of further densities beside the op makes it necessary to extend the static functional of the usual @xmath18-theory , although the op alone would be sufficient to describe the static critical behavior .",
    "such an extended static functional for isotropic systems ( @xmath19 symmetry ) with short range interaction has the form @xcite @xmath20 here the order parameter @xmath21 is assumed to be a @xmath22-component real vector , the symbol @xmath23 denotes the scalar product . the secondary density @xmath24 is considered as a scalar quantity and @xmath25 is the conjugated field to @xmath26 . it is chosen to have a vanishing average value @xmath27 . within statics ,",
    "the above functional is equivalent to the ginzburg - landau - wilson(glw)-functional @xmath28 where @xmath29 is proportional to the temperature distance to the critical point and @xmath30 is the fourth order coupling in which perturbation expansion is usually performed .",
    "the glw - functional ( [ hglw ] ) is obtained by integrating out the cd , which appears only in gaussian order in ( [ hmodc ] ) , in the corresponding partition function .",
    "the parameters @xmath31 , @xmath32 and @xmath33 in ( [ hmodc ] ) and , @xmath29 and @xmath30 in ( [ hglw ] ) are related by @xmath34 the extended static functional appears in the driving force of the equations of motion for the op @xmath35 and the cd @xmath26 .",
    "the ratio of the kinetic coefficient @xmath36 in the relaxation equation for the op and the kinetic coefficient @xmath37 in the diffusive equation for the cd defines the dynamical parameter @xmath38 whose fp value governs the dynamical scaling of the model .",
    "it is worthwhile to summarize some results for model c at a usual critical point , where the cd can be identified with an energy like density and the value of specific heat exponent @xmath39 ( in any case ) governs the relevance of the asymmetric static coupling @xmath33 between the op and the cd .",
    "namely , this coupling is irrelevant in the rg sense - it vanishes at the fp - if the specific heat exponent is negative , i.e. the specific heat of the system does not diverge at the critical point .",
    "if the specific heat diverges then there remain two possibilities for the dynamical fp : either the fp value of the time scale ratio @xmath38 between the timescale of the op and the cd is different from zero and finite , or its fp value is zero or infinite . in the first case",
    "strong dynamical scaling with one timescale for the op and the cd is realized with one dynamical scaling exponent @xmath40 ( @xmath3 the exponent of the correlation length ) . in the second case weak dynamical scaling",
    "is present and the time scale of the op is different from the timescale of the cd , both represented by a corresponding dynamical critical exponent .",
    "this region of the weak dynamical scaling fp is tiny ( see e.g fig . 1 in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "one should note that at the usual critical point an asymmetric coupling to the op as given in eq .",
    "( [ hmodc ] ) is always energy - like independent of its physical origin .",
    "that means the divergence of the cd susceptibility is always described by the specific heat exponent @xmath39 .    in the case of a multicritical point treated here",
    "the situation is more complicated since there are two ops and a cd might couple to both of these ops .",
    "as has been shown in paper i after a proper rotation ( eq .",
    "( 64 ) ) in the op space temperature and magnetic like field directions can be identified . in consequence at the multicritical point one has to discriminate the case of energy and magnetization conservation .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ multc ]",
    "we extend model c of the @xmath19 symmetrical critical system to the case of a @xmath0 symmetrical multicritical point as considered in papers i and ii .",
    "the renormalization is performed in section [ renorm ] and the field theoretic functions are calculated in section [ zeta ] . then we discuss the possible fp and their stability in section [ fixp ] .",
    "effective dynamical critical behavior is considered in section [ flows ] followed in section [ out ] by a short summary of the results and an outlook on further work to be done .",
    "in order to describe the multicritical behavior the @xmath22-dimensional space of the order parameter components is split into two subspaces with dimensions @xmath9 and @xmath8 with the property @xmath41 .",
    "the order parameter separates into @xmath42 where @xmath43 is the @xmath9-dimensional order parameter of the @xmath9-subspace , and @xmath44 is the @xmath8-dimensional order parameter of the @xmath8-subspace . introducing this separation into the glw - functional ( [ hglw ] ) one obtains @xmath45 which represents a multicritical ginzburg - landau - wilson model .",
    "the properties of this functional concerning the renormalization , regions of stable fps , and corresponding type of multicritical behavior has been extensively discussed in paper i ( see @xcite for earlier references ) .",
    "the separation ( [ phisplit ] ) has now to be performed in ( [ hmodc ] ) .",
    "the resulting functional is @xmath46 integrating the contributions of the secondary density in the corresponding partition function , ( [ hbicritc ] ) reduces to the static functional ( [ hbicrit ] ) .",
    "relations analogous to ( [ rurel ] ) between the parameters of the two static functionals arise .",
    "they read @xmath47 because the partition function calculated from ( [ hbicritc ] ) is reducible to a partition function based on ( [ hbicrit ] ) by integration , the correlation functions , or vertex functions respectively , of the secondary density @xmath26 are exactly related to correlation functions of the order parameter .",
    "this leads to several relations which are important for the renormalization .",
    "in particular , the average value of @xmath26 and the two - point correlation function are defined as @xmath48 with @xmath49 as the normalization constant and @xmath50 as a suitable integral measure . performing the integration over @xmath26 in ( [ mavdef ] ) and using eqs.([rupperprel])-([utimesrel ] )",
    ", the average value of @xmath26 reads @xmath51 where @xmath52 denotes quadratic insertions of the order parameter .",
    "their average values on the right hand side of ( [ mav ] ) , @xmath53 are now calculated with the static functional ( [ hbicrit ] ) and @xmath54 . in order to obtain @xmath27 the conjugated external field",
    "is chosen to @xmath55 quite analogous by integrating @xmath26 in ( [ mcorrdef ] ) one obtains the following relation for the two - point correlation function of the secondary density @xmath56 in ( [ mmcorr ] ) where we have introduced the column matrix @xmath57 the superscript @xmath58 indicates a transposed vector or matrix , while the subscript @xmath59 on the average at the left hand side of ( [ mmcorr ] ) denotes the cummulant @xmath60 .",
    "the matrix @xmath61 of two - point vertex functions is related to correlations of @xmath62-insertions .",
    "the vertex functions generally have been introduced in paper i ( section iii renormalization ) , and especially the matrix ( [ ga020 ] ) ( renormalized counterpart ) in eq.(83 ) therein .",
    "a third important relation can be obtained by differentiating the average value ( [ mavdef ] ) by @xmath25 at fixed parameter @xmath63 . in @xmath64",
    "the shift of the critical temperature has been taken into account ( for more details see appendix a in paper i ) . as a result one obtains @xmath65 due to relation ( [ hext ] ) the external field is function of @xmath66 .",
    "the @xmath67-derivative in ( [ dmdh ] ) can be rewritten as @xmath66-derivatives .",
    "finally one obtains @xmath68 where we have defined @xmath69 all static vertex functions , for the order parameter as well as for the secondary density , may be calculated with ( [ hbicritc ] ) in perturbation expansion as functions of the correlation lengths @xmath70 , the set of quartic couplings @xmath71 , the set of asymmetric couplings @xmath72 , and the wave vector modulus @xmath73 . the parameters in the order parameter vertex functions @xmath74 ( for the notation see appendix a in paper i ) via relations ( [ rupperprel ] ) - ( [ utimesrel ] ) combine the corresponding parameters of the multicritical glw - model ( [ hbicrit ] ) .",
    "thus all order parameter vertex functions calculated with ( [ hbicritc ] ) have the property @xmath75 meaning that they are identical to corresponding functions of the multicritical glw - model ( [ hbicrit ] ) .",
    "for this reason no distinction between the correlation lengthes entering the left and right hand side of ( [ vertexeq ] ) is necessary .",
    "the correlation lengths are defined from the two - point order parameter vertex functions at the left side with ( [ hbicritc ] ) , and on the right side with ( [ hbicrit ] ) ( see eqs.(a7 ) and ( a8 ) in paper i ) .",
    "vertex functions of the secondary density can be expressed as functions of @xmath76 instead of @xmath77 by using ( [ rupperprel])-([utimesrel ] ) . especially the two - point function @xmath78 , which will be of interest in the following , can be written as @xmath79      the dynamical equations of model a in paper ii have now to be extended by appending a diffusion equation for the secondary density .",
    "one obtains @xmath80 in addition to the two kinetic coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 of the order parameter in the corresponding subspaces , a kinetic coefficient @xmath37 of diffusive type for the conserved secondary density is now present .",
    "the stochastic forces @xmath83 , @xmath84 and @xmath85 fulfill einstein relations @xmath86 with indices @xmath87 and @xmath88 corresponding to the two subspaces .",
    "the dynamical two - point vertex function of the secondary density has a general structure quite analogous to the corresponding functions of the order parameter ( see eqs.(6 ) and ( 7 ) in paper ii ) .",
    "one can write @xmath89 where @xmath90 is the static two - point function discussed in the previous subsection and @xmath91 is a genuine dynamical function@xcite .",
    "@xmath92 is the auxiliary density corresponding to @xmath17 . for shortness",
    "we have dropped the couplings and kinetic coefficients in the argument lists of ( [ gmmstruc ] ) .",
    "as a consequence of the discussion at the end of subsection [ func ] all vertex functions will be expanded in powers of the quartic couplings @xmath76 of the multicritical glw - model and the asymmetric couplings @xmath93 . the renormalization scheme introduced in section iii in paper i remains valid and will be used in the following .",
    "the corresponding definitions and relations can be found therein and will not be repeated here . in particular , we implement the minimal subtraction rg scheme@xcite directly at @xmath94 to the two loop order . in the current extended model additional renormalizations for the secondary density @xmath26 and the asymmetric couplings @xmath93 have to be considered .",
    "the renormalized counterparts of the secondary density and the asymmetric couplings are introduced as @xmath95 where @xmath96 is the usual reference wave vector modulus and @xmath97 . the geometrical factor @xmath98 and the diagonal matrix @xmath99 has been defined in eq.(8 ) and eq.(17 ) of paper i. with ( [ mren ] ) and ( [ gammaren ] ) at hand , the renormalization for the cd - cd two - point vertex @xmath100 function readily follows @xmath101 the additional @xmath102-factor @xmath103 and the matrix @xmath104 are related to the known renormalization factors of the multicritical glw - model as a consequence of the reducibility of the extended model to the multicritical glw - model .    from the condition that ( [ dmdhend ] ) is also valid for the renormalized counterparts of the appearing quantities the relation @xmath105 follows . for the second equality relation",
    "( 18 ) of paper i has been used .",
    "the @xmath102-factors of the asymmetric couplings are determined by the renormalizations of the secondary density and the @xmath62-insertions in the multicritical glw - model .",
    "relation ( [ mmcorr ] ) establishes a connection between the correlation functions of the cd and the @xmath62-insertions in the multicritical glw - model .",
    "this relation should be invariant under renormalization .",
    "thus the renormalization of the secondary density is related by @xmath106 to the additive renormalization @xmath107 of the correlation function of the @xmath62-insertions ( [ ga020 ] ) in the multicritical glw - model introduced in eq.(15 ) in paper i.      the general form of the renormalization of the auxiliary densities @xmath108 , @xmath109 , and the kinetic coefficients @xmath81 and @xmath82 has been presented within model a in subsection iii a in paper ii .",
    "it remains valid and will be used in the following .",
    "of course new contributions occur to the dynamical renormalization factors especially of the kinetic coefficients @xmath110 due to the asymmetric coupling @xmath111 .    within model",
    "c additional renormalizations only are necessary for the auxiliary density @xmath112 and the kinetic coefficient @xmath37 .",
    "thus we introduce @xmath113 in the case of conserved densities the dynamical function @xmath91 in ( [ gmmstruc ] ) does not contain new dimensional singularities . therefore the corresponding auxiliary density @xmath112 needs no independent renormalization .",
    "the @xmath102-factor @xmath114 is determined by the relation @xmath115 due to the absence of mode coupling terms the renormalization of the kinetic coefficient @xmath16 is completely determined by the static renormalization and @xmath116 is @xmath117",
    "as already mentioned in the preceding section the renormalization of the glw - functional remains valid .",
    "this validates also all @xmath118- and @xmath119-functions introduced in section iv in paper i. we do not repeat them here , although they will be used in the following .",
    "apart from the three @xmath119-functions @xmath120 , @xmath121 and @xmath122 , and the two @xmath118-matrices @xmath123 and @xmath124 appearing in the multicritical glw - model ( see section iv in paper i ) , an additional @xmath118-function @xmath125 and a column matrix of @xmath119-functions for the asymmetric coupling ( [ gammavec ] ) have to be introduced .",

    "this allows to trace back nonasymptotic effects in dynamical quantities to the slow transients in statics or those appearing in dynamics .    in order to calculate the numerical values of the effective exponents , we substitute into eq .",
    "( [ effexps ] ) the resummed coordinates of the static fp @xmath398 and the values of timescale ratios @xmath399 along the rg flow .",
    "choosing the fp values of the static couplings fixes the asymptotic values of the effective dynamical exponents since they are expressed by the static asymptotic exponents for the strong dynamical scaling fp .",
    "the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_eff_exp1 ] correspond to the case @xmath4 , @xmath5 .",
    "we evaluate the timescale ratios along the previously obtained flows 1 - 4 in fig .",
    "[ flow02 ] .",
    "the effective exponents for the different initial conditions are shown by numbered solid lines , as one can observe from this figure , the exponents calculated along several flows do not coincide for the values of the flow parameter shown . however one sees the merging of the different values for @xmath400 to their asymptotic value @xmath401 given by the static value corresponding to the cd ( the constant line in fig .",
    "[ fig_eff_exp1 ] ) .",
    "more remarkable is the difference between the effective exponents for the parallel and perpendicular components of the op .",
    "this difference can be traced back to the fact that @xmath143 did not reach its very large fp value due to the slow dynamical transient . only for flow parameter values larger than @xmath402",
    "the effective exponent attains its asymptotic value @xmath403 as it should be ( see the insert of fig .",
    "[ fig_eff_exp1 ] where the smallest value is @xmath404 for the flow 1 ) .",
    "furthermore , we see that the exponent @xmath400 flows towards its asymptotic value @xmath405 .",
    "in fact , exponent @xmath406 attains the asymptotic value @xmath407 as well , but for much smaller values of the flow parameter .",
    "in the insert of fig . [ fig_eff_exp1 ]",
    "we show this exponent for all flows within larger range of @xmath408 .    for certain initial values of the _",
    "static _ parameters it is possible that the unstable heisenberg fp is reached ( see fig . 3 in paper i the flow number 1 , which lies on the surface separating the attraction region of the biconical fp from the flow away solutions .",
    "in such a case the effective exponents reach faster the asymptotic value of the dynamical exponent @xmath409 since the dynamical transient exponent @xmath410 is lager by a factor of @xmath411 ( for the values of b see caption to tab .",
    "[ tab3 ] ) .",
    "the effect of coupling the conserved magnetization parallel to the external magnetic field to the two ops ( the components of the alternating magnetization parallel and perpendicular to the external magnetic field ) leads to strong scaling dynamical behavior .",
    "this means that the timescales of all dynamical quantities scale with the same dynamical critical exponent @xmath412 .",
    "however this scaling behavior might be hidden by nonasymtotic effects dominating the physical accessible region when approaching the multicritical point due to a very small dynamical transient .",
    "this applies in the physical interesting case @xmath4 and @xmath5 where one of the timescales is almost zero and the other one almost infinite . in consequence",
    "the magnetic transport coefficients might show different effective behavior with temperature when approaching the multicritical point .",
    "the dynamical amplitude ratios might be far from their asymptotic values and show nonuniversal behavior .    for a complete description in the whole @xmath8-@xmath9-space",
    "the model presented here has to be extended in two ways .",
    "first for the physical case @xmath4 and @xmath5 one has to introduce reversible terms in the equations of motions .",
    "second one has to allow for an asymmetric coupling to a energy like cd in addition to the magnetization .",
