    "multiferroics are attractive multifunctional materials where magnetism and ferroelectricity coexist and are generally coupled .",
    "in particular , orthorhombic rare - earth manganites @xmath3mno@xmath4 represent an important class of `` improper ferroelectrics '' @xcite where electric dipoles are induced by a frustrated magnetic ordering . within this family of compounds , tbmno@xmath4 and dymno@xmath4 , in their noncollinear magnetic phases ,",
    "have been experimentally shown to behave as multiferroics showing a weak polarization ( @xmath5 ) and a spin - flop ferroelectric transition.@xcite moreover , it has been recently predicted that relatively strong ferroelectricity occurs in the e - type antiferromagnetic ( afm ) phase of @xmath3mno@xmath4 through a model study where the double - exchange interaction between mn-@xmath6 orbitals is proposed as a driving force for polar atomic displacements.@xcite in that case , the electric polarization @xmath7 is not related to dzyaloshinskii - moriya interaction , which is expected to generate much lower @xmath7.@xcite following the model study , our previously reported ab - initio calculations @xcite have confirmed that afm - e homno@xmath4 indeed shows a high ferroelectric polarization ( @xmath8 ) ; it was shown there that the afm - e spin ordering , which breaks the space - inversion symmetry , is such that ferroelectric dipoles arise even without atomic displacements.@xcite from the experimental point of view , ferroelectricity was detected in policrystalline ortho - homno@xmath1,@xcite the magnitude of polarization being however much smaller than what is theoretically predicted and showing a strong dependence on the magnetic field below the ordering temperature of the ho , suggesting their involvement in the development of @xmath7 .",
    "the reason behind the disagreement between theory @xcite and experiments @xcite is still under debate .    the microscopic origin of the multiferroism in ortho-@xmath3mno@xmath4 is tightly linked to the lattice degree of freedom : a small ionic radius of the @xmath3 atom holds a key role in affecting _",

    "since these aspects are all mutually combined , first we will discuss the case of afm - e homno@xmath1 , and we will explain , from a microscopic quantum - mechanical point of view , the origin of the magnetically - induced ferroelectric polarization in terms of the spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom .",
    "the analysis based on wannier functions represents a novel development with respect to our previous study on homno@xmath4.@xcite moreover , in the second part of the paper , we will discuss about structure , magnetism , orbital ordering , hopping integrals and ferroelectricity - as well as the links between them - along the manganites series , with the main aim of identifying chemical trends as a function of the @xmath3 ion .",
    "the unit cell in orthorhombic @xmath3mno@xmath4 shows strong distortions with respect to the ideal cubic perovskite . whereas the @xmath12 setting is used in some other references , the standard @xmath13 orientation is adopted in this paper , _",
    "i.e. _ we choose @xmath14 as the longest axis .",
    "although the hexagonal non - perovskite phase is more stable than the orhorhombic phase in @xmath3mno@xmath4 for @xmath3 smaller than tb , the transition to the metastable orthorhombic phase can be obtained by high - pressure synthesis.@xcite we have considered five kinds of afm configurations : afm - a , c , g in 20 atoms / unit cell and afm - e and afm - e * in 40 atoms / unit cell .",
    "we recall that , according to the standard wollan - koehler notation@xcite , the afm - a shows fm ( afm ) intraplanar ( interplanar ) coupling ; the afm - c shows fm ( afm ) interplanar ( intraplanar ) coupling ; the afm - g shows afm in both intra- and interplanar coupling .",
    "the afm - e shows in - plane fm zig - zag chains antiferromagnetically coupled to the neighboring chains ; the interplanar coupling is also afm ( for the afm - e spin arrangements in the mno@xmath15 plane , we refer to the following fig .",
    "[ fig : afm ] ) .",
    "we denote by afm - e * the spin - configuration showing the same in - plane spin arrangement as afm - e , but with an interplanar fm coupling .",
    "note that the afm - a spin arrangement shows the space - inversion as symmetry operation , at variance with the afm - e spin - configuration which shows non centrosymmetric @xmath16 symmetry .",
    "as far as the electronic structure is concerned ( especially for the density of states projected on the mn atom as well as orbital - ordering , see below ) , it is useful to define - in addition to the  global \" @xmath17 orthorhombic frame - a  local \" frame , specific to each jahn - teller - like distorted mno@xmath18 octahedron , obtained by choosing @xmath19 along the middle , short and long mn - o axis , respectively . in this local frame ,",
    "the orbital ordered mn-@xmath20 state , which is often expressed as @xmath21 , is described as @xmath22 ( denoted as @xmath23 hereafter for simplicity ) .",
    "the simulations were performed by using density - functional theory ( dft ) and the perdew - becke - erzenhof ( pbe ) version of the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) to the exchange - correlation potential.@xcite the calculations were done with two program codes according to different purposes .",
    "the expensive calculations for the structural optimization of the atomic structure and berry phase for the afm - a and afm - e phases were done with `` vienna @xmath24 @xmath25 simulation package ( vasp ) program code'',@xcite where projector - augmented - wave ( paw ) pseudo - potential is used .",
    "the plane wave cutoff is set to 500 ev in energy .",
    "we used 8 special k - points ( divided as @xmath26 ) in 1/8 irreducible brillouin zone ( ibz ) for the a - afm phase and 4 special k - points ( divided as @xmath27 in 1/4 ibz for the e - afm phase according to the monkhorst - pack scheme .",
    "the berry phase was calculated by integrating over six k - point strings parallel to the c axis , each string containing 6 k - points",
    ".    calculations requiring a higher precision ( _ i.e. _ as for the total energy differences for the stability of different spin - configuration ) and the construction of maximally - localized wannier functions ( wfs ) @xcite were done with the fleur code@xcite which is based on the full - potential linearized augmented planewave ( flapw ) formalism.@xcite muffin - tin radii were set to 2.5 , 2.0 and 1.5 a.u . for @xmath3 ,",
    "mn and o atoms , respectively , where the wavefunction cutoff was chosen as 3.8 a.u.@xmath28 .",
    "the potential was converged with 24 special * k*-points and density of states was calculated with 192 * k*-points within the tetrahedron method . for afm - e and afm - e@xmath29 phase ,",
    "12 * k*-points were used according to the doubled unit cell .",
    "the wannier function calculation , whose procedure was recently implemented in the fleur code @xcite , was done with 512 * k*-points ( divided as @xmath30 ) . @xmath3-@xmath31 and @xmath32 states were treated as local orbitals .    the localized @xmath3-@xmath33 electrons were assumed as core electrons : `` frozen core '' within the vasp code and `` open core '' within the fleur code , @xcite where the spin moment is maximized due to hund s rule .",
    "irrespective of these approaches , the @xmath33 states lie deep in energy ( a few ev below the fermi energy ) and they are almost completely undispersed , so that they do not affect other valence states .",
    "let us start our discussion by focusing on the case of afm - e homno@xmath1 , which was previously found by some of us to show a large polarization along the in - plane @xmath34-axis due to non - centrosymmetric collinear spin - arrangement.@xcite in this work , we perform a careful analysis in terms of wannier functions which explains the microscopic mechanism at the basis of the final ferroelectricity .",
    "the structural parameters used in our calculations are summarized in a later section , together with the parameters in other @xmath3mno@xmath4 compounds ( cfr table [ struc.a ] below ) .",
    "the magnetically - induced spontaneous polarization was calculated by using _ i _ ) the point charge model ( pcm ) where each ion has been given its nominal charge ( ho:+3 , mn:3 + , o:2- ) ; _ ii _ ) the berry phase ( bp ) method implemented in the vasp code and _ iii _ ) the wannier function ( wf ) method implemented in the fleur code.@xcite we recall that , in the first approach only the positions of the anions and cations are considered , whereas in the two latter@xcite quantum - mechanical treatments , the self - consistent electronic structure is fully taken into account .    to calculate the polarization within bp , an adiabatic path from afm - a to afm - e phase is assumed , in such a way that the direction of mn spins are progressively rotated from an in - plane fm to a zig - zag - like arrangement.@xcite the ionic contribution from core electrons and protons are added to bp calculated for the fully occupied valence states . in fig.[fig : afm ] and table [ tab : disp_atom ] we show the displacements of the atoms in the non - centrosymmetric afm - e spin - configuration with respect to the centrosymmetric afm - a structure .",
    "these quantities will be needed in the discussion reported below .    by using wfs",
    ", one can decompose the total polarization into contributions coming from each set of orbitals . for clarity , we show in fig.[fig : band ] the afm - e homno@xmath1 insulating bandstructure where the relevant states are highlighted : mn-@xmath35 , mn-@xmath2 and o-@xmath36 orbitals .",
    "we have projected these three groups of occupied eigenstates into real - space basis separately and  maximally - localized \" them to obtain the corresponding wfs .",
    "the contribution from deeper occupied valence states ( such as o-@xmath37 and @xmath3-@xmath31 , -@xmath32 states ) is neglected in the wf approach . here , the total polarization is the sum of the displacements of the centers of each wf from the position of the corresponding ion plus pcm contribution . for the details of the construction and interpretation of wfs ,",
    "see ref ..    according to the different approaches , our estimated values for the polarization in afm - e homno@xmath1 are @xmath38 = -6.14 @xmath39c/@xmath40 , @xmath41 = -5.61 @xmath39c/@xmath40 and @xmath42 = -2.09 @xmath39c/@xmath40 along @xmath43 axis .",
    "the values of @xmath7 along @xmath44 and @xmath45 axis are both negligible in each approach .",
    "the large difference of the values of @xmath41 ( @xmath38 ) from @xmath46 is remarkable .",
    "the difference between polarization @xmath41 ( @xmath38 ) and @xmath42 is referred to as the _ _ anomalous contribution__@xcite and it is analyzed by means of wannier functions .",
    "table [ tab : disp_wf ] shows the orbital - decomposed polarization obtained by the displacement of the center of wf ( wfc ) with respect to ionic positions for each set of bands . by definition ,",
    "the sum of the wfc displacements gives the difference between @xmath47 and @xmath46 , which can be regarded as the difference between the dynamical charge @xmath48 and static ( nominal ) charge @xmath43 .",
    "in other words , it quantifies the effects of going from a more ionic charge distribution to more covalent bonding state . by means of the wf analysis ,",
    "not only one can obtain relevant information on which orbital causes the anomalous contribution , but also a real - space picture of the polar orbital states .",
    ".[tab : disp_atom ] atomic displacements from centrosymmetric afm - a phase in ferroelectric afm - e homno@xmath4 (  ) . o(1)@xmath49 and o(2)@xmath49 ( o(3)@xmath50 and o(4)@xmath50 ) are connected by @xmath51 symmetry operation .",
    "the used notation of atoms is shown in fig.2 . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     similarly to the case of homno@xmath1 , we have calculated the polarization according to the pcm , bp and wf approaches . as shown in fig.[fig : berry ] , the polarization calculated by bp and wf are consistent within less than 10 % : this difference ( in addition to possible numerical uncertainties deriving from the use of a different basis set and potential treatments in vasp and fleur codes for bp and wf approaches , respectively ) comes from o-@xmath37 , @xmath3-@xmath31 , @xmath3-@xmath32 contributions and shows that these latter contributions , as expected , are small compared to mn-@xmath6 and o-@xmath36 contributions .",
    "what is truly remarkable is that the polarization ( both from bp and wf ) shows a rapid increase upon decreasing of @xmath52 ( @xmath53 approaches 12 @xmath54 in an hypothetical afm - e lamno@xmath1 ) , whereas @xmath46 is to a large extent constant .",
    "this latter trend is consistent with the constant behavior of @xmath55 shown in fig.[fig : opt_e.ls_ang ] and with what previously discussed in refs .",
    "@xcite . moreover , the difference between p@xmath56/p@xmath57 and p@xmath58 ( which represents a purely electronic contribution ) is much bigger than the contribution coming from atomic displacementsin the entire series .",
    "this confirms the different nature of the magnetic origin of ferroelectricity in manganites with respect to standard  proper \" ferroelectrics .",
    "our results further suggest that orbital ordering is necessary for the rising of the polarization ; however , being constant along the series , is not responsible for the _ trend _ of fe polarization , which , on the other hand , shows dramatic changes as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "consistently with what previously discussed for homno@xmath1 where @xmath59 is suggested to play a important role , the dramatic increase in the _ asymmetric _",
    "@xmath0 hopping is responsible for enhancing @xmath7 in less distorted manganites ( cfr tab .",
    "[ tab : wfc ] where we report the different contribution of mn-@xmath0 , mn-@xmath2 and o-@xmath36 to the total @xmath41 ) .",
    "we show that , for every @xmath3 , the mn-@xmath0 and o-@xmath36 contributions show an opposite sign with respect to the mn-@xmath2 term with regular trends along the series . indeed , remembering that the hopping integral @xmath59 depends on the bond length and bond angle , one expects smaller @xmath60 and larger @xmath52 to enhance @xmath59 between @xmath35 orbitals , whereas smaller @xmath61 to enhance @xmath59 between @xmath2 orbitals ; this is confirmed by looking carefully at table.[tab : wfc ] and fig.[fig : opt_e.ls_ang ] and their implications for the values of p ( cfr .",
    "[ fig : berry ] ) .",
    "ferroelectricity , recently proposed for the collinear afm - e magnetic phase in orthorhombic homno@xmath1 , is here explained microscopically from first - principles via a careful wannier function analysis .",
    "we show that the _ asymmetric _ electron hopping of orbitally - polarized mn-@xmath0 states is the key ingredient for the rising of polarization . at variance with proper ferroelectrics , in homno@xmath1 the purely electronic contribution ( due to wannier function centers which are largely displaced with respect to ions ) dominates the polarization , with respect to the contribution to @xmath7 coming from ionic movements . however , the net polarization along the @xmath34 axis is the result of a delicate balance of different contributions , such as , for example , the opposite signs of the mn @xmath0 and @xmath2 contributions to @xmath7 .",
    "in addition , extensive _ ab ",
    "calculations have been performed for the @xmath3mno@xmath1 systems , focusing on the link between ferroelectricity and the spin , orbital and lattice degrees of freedom in the aim of identifying chemical trends along the series . in summary ,",
    "the results are summarized as : _ i _ )",
    "ferromagnetic @xmath62 increases with the mn - o - mn angle @xmath52 , whereas antiferromagnetic @xmath63 is rather constant with @xmath52 ; _ ii _ ) @xmath64 increases with @xmath52 and decreases with @xmath60 , whereas @xmath65 decreases with @xmath61 and partially cancels @xmath64 .",
    "_ iii _ ) orbital ordering , a needed ingredient in the rising of @xmath7 , is however saturated along the series and does not influence the trend of polarization as a function of @xmath3 .",
    "therefore , the main message is that one can expect high ferroelectric polarization with large @xmath52 and small @xmath60 in the afm - e phase ; however , such large @xmath52 would simultaneously increase the ferromagnetic @xmath62 , therefore stabilizing the centrosymmetric afm - a spin configuration instead of the polar afm - e phase .",
    "the problem is then _ how _ to increase @xmath7 , still keeping the afm - e phase as stable spin - state ( _ i.e. _ via strain , pressure , alloying , etc ) : we hope that our findings will be helpful to answer this question .",
