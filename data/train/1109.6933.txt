    "the atlas experiment@xcite is one of two general purpose collider detectors for the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern .",
    "the atlas detector consists of an inner detector employing silicon pixel , strip , and transition radiation tracking detectors , all in a solenoidal magnetic field of 2 tesla ; electromagnetic and hadronic calorimeters using liquid argon and scintillator tile detectors ; and a muon spectrometer .",
    "the muon spectrometer consists of a large air - core barrel and endcap toroid magnets with a @xmath1 between 2 - 6 @xmath2 , and four types of trigger and precision tracking detectors , described below .",
    "the muon spectrometer is designed to measure the transverse momentum ( @xmath3 ) of muons with @xmath4 gev with a resolution of 4% up to @xmath3 of 100 gev and increasing to 10% @ 1 tev .",
    "the atlas muon spectrometer consists of monitored drift tubes ( mdts ) for precision tracking in the spectrometer bending plane , resistive plate chambers ( rpcs ) and thin gap chambers ( tgcs ) for triggering in barrel and endcap , respectively , and cathode strip chambers ( cscs ) for precision measurements in the high - rate endcap inner layer where mdts would have occupancy problems .",
    "the magnet system consists of 3 sets of air - core toroids , each with 8 coils , 1 for the barrel , and 1 for each endcap .",
    "the barrel toroids coils are each 25 m @xmath5 7 m and the endcap coils are 9 m @xmath5 4 m .",
    "the magnetic field provides an approximately 1 t field at the center of each coils , but is non - uniform , especially in the barrel - endcap transition region . for track reconstruction ,",
    "the field is mapped using a computer model of the field which is normalized to measurements from 1850 hall sensors mounted on spectrometer chambers .",
    "alignment measurements of the spectrometer are also critical for momentum determination and are accomplished with an optical alignment system of 12k sensors .",
    "measurements from these sensors allow a 3-dimensional reconstruction of chamber positions accurate to better than 50 @xmath0 m .",
    "in addition , the optical alignment system is complemented by alignment done with tracks .",

    ", the sagitta of a 1 tev muon will be about 500 @xmath0 m .",
    "the trigger chambers are placed on opposite sides of the middle mdt layer .",
    "the trigger chambers provide a trigger based on muon momentum in addition to identifying the bunch crossing time of the muon .",

    "gev / c multiple scattering is the dominant contributor to the resolution . above 100 gev / c calibration and alignment of the spectrometer",

    "atlas muon reconstruction is done using momentum measurements from both the inner detector spectrometer and the muon spectrometer .",
    "the two spectrometers nicely complement each other as inner detector measurements are better below 100 gev / c above which the muon spectrometer resolution is superior .",
    "high @xmath3 measurements with the muon spectrometer require very accurate mdt and alignment calibrations which will become particularly important in a few years when lhc reaches 7 tev energy per beam and higher luminosities .",
    "this paper shows a mix of results from 2010 and 2011 using the most up - to - date plots whenever possible .",
    "not all plots are available for 2011 so in some cases 2010 plots are used .",
    "there are three calibrations required for the mdts : timing offsets ( @xmath7 ) ; time - space ( @xmath8 ) functions ; and drift tube resolution functions@xcite . in order to obtain high quality calibrations for the mdts a special high statistics calibration data stream",
    "is extracted second - level trigger processors and sent for processing at three calibration centers at michigan , rome , and munich .",
    "this calibration stream provides 10 - 100x the rate of single muon tracks compared to regular atlas data . with this stream",
    "it is possible to do daily calibrations of the monitored drift tubes as well as detailed data quality monitoring .",
    "a timing offset represents the minimum measured drift time .",
    "i.e. the time of a muon passing at the wire of the drift tube .",
    "this time is not zero due to cables and other delays in the data acquisition system .",

    "figure [ fig : drifttime ] shows statistical error on @xmath7 fits as a function of number hits in the time spectrum .",
    "we require at least 10000 hits for the fits yielding a typical error of 0.5 ns .",

    "the resolution is determined from the tracking residuals width with the fit errors subtracted .",
    "we see that the resolution is close to the 80 @xmath0 m for large radii .",
    "near the wire the resolution degrades to faster drift speed and fewer drift electrons .",
    "this plot was made with 2010 data .",
    "we expect improvements in the future by applying some addition timing corrections such as a hit - level magnetic field correction and by using tube - level @xmath7s .",
    "the alignment system system is designed to track chamber positions with a 40 @xmath0 m precision .",
