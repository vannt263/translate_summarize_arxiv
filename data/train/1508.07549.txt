    "proof of lemma 4 * + in order to clarify the dependence in the carleman estimate on @xmath264 and @xmath389 , for arbitrary @xmath261 , we prove the lemma directly and the proof is similar for example to section 3 in yamamoto [ 21 ] , where a carleman estimate is proved for a parabolic equation .    by the usual density argument , it suffices to prove for @xmath390 .",
    "we set @xmath391 and @xmath392 we have @xmath393 we set @xmath394 we note that @xmath395 here and henceforth by @xmath396 , etc . , we denote generic constants which are independent of @xmath397 but dependent on @xmath398 , and these constants may change line by line .",
    "moreover we always assume that @xmath399 .",
    "hence we use the following inequality : @xmath400 if @xmath401 .    in view of @xmath402",
    ", we have @xmath403 taking into consideration the orders of @xmath404 , we split @xmath405 as follows : @xmath406 since @xmath407 , we obtain @xmath408 now we estimate @xmath409 @xmath410 by the integration by parts and @xmath411 on @xmath312 , we have @xmath412 since @xmath413 we have @xmath414 therefore @xmath415 moreover we have @xmath416 @xmath417 and @xmath418 @xmath419 therefore ( 6 ) - ( 9 ) yield @xmath420 @xmath421 for the proof of the lemma , we have to estimate @xmath422 , but the first and the second terms on the right - hand side have different signs .",
    "thus we need another estimate . that is , multiplying ( 3 ) with @xmath423 and integrating over @xmath134",
    ", we obtain @xmath424 @xmath425 hence , by integration by parts , we obtain @xmath426 here we have @xmath427 consequently @xmath428 next @xmath429 @xmath430 by ( 2 ) , we see @xmath431 since @xmath432 it follows from ( 11 ) - ( 14 ) that @xmath433 therefore @xmath434 @xmath435 thus we consider ( 10 ) @xmath436 @xmath437 ( 15 ) : @xmath438 @xmath439 since @xmath440 for all @xmath66 and @xmath270 , we have @xmath441 @xmath442 and @xmath443 we choose sufficiently large @xmath297 such that @xmath444 in ( 18 ) . for any given @xmath298 , we choose @xmath445 such that @xmath446 in ( 17 ) and ( 19 ) .",
    "then @xmath447 for all @xmath298 and @xmath301 , and noting @xmath448 for all @xmath261 , we can absorb the second and the third terms on the right - hand side of ( 16 ) into the left - hand side to obtain @xmath449 we re - write by means of @xmath450 . replacing @xmath451",
    ", we have @xmath452 and @xmath453 substituting them into ( 20 ) , we complete the proof of lemma 4 ."
