    "psr j0205 + 6449 in supernova remnant ( snr ) 3c58 is a young energetic pulsar detected at x , @xmath1-ray , and radio wavelengths @xcite .",
    "it has a spin period @xmath765 ms and the third highest spin down energy flux , @xmath8 erg s@xmath9 kpc@xmath10 ( where @xmath11 is the pulsar distance ) , after the crab and vela pulsars .",
    "3c58 was thought to be young , associated with supernova sn 1181 , @xcite , and consequently should share many of the characteristics of the crab nebula , including the presence of a young pulsar .",
    "yet its pulsar , psr j0205 + 6449 , defied detection for over twenty years .",
    "it was only about ten years ago that it was discovered as an x - ray pulsar by _",
    "( murray et al .  2002 ) , while its identification as a radio pulsar came soon after ( camilo et al .",
    "was also detected in the hard x - rays ( kuiper et al .",
    "2010 ) by the _ high energy x - ray timing experiment _",
    "( _ hexte _ ) aboard the rossi x - ray timing explorer ( _ rxte _ ) and was also one of the first to be identified as a @xmath1-ray pulsar by _ fermi _ ( abdo et al .",
    "psr j0205 + 6449 is clearly located within a pulsar wind nebula ( pwn ) , detected both in the x - rays ( slane et al .  2002 ; 2004 ) ,",
    "optical , and near - infrared ( slane et al .   2008 ) .    from the x - ray determined hydrogen column density ( marelli et al .  2011",
    "; marelli 2012 ) , and using the relation , we can estimate an @xmath12 - 2.5 , similar to the crab pulsar .",
    "the distance to , however , is possibly larger than the crab .",
    "hi radio observations gives a distance to 3c58 of 3.2 kpc , lower but still consistent with the value of @xmath13 kpc obtained from the pulsar dispersion measure of @xmath14 @xmath15 pc @xcite and the electron distribution model of @xcite .",
    "if the crab and 3c58 snrs were of the same age , we might also expect similarities between their pulsars .",
    "however , psr j0205 + 6449 was found to be considerably weaker than the crab pulsar ; its x - ray emission is 1000 times lower than the crab and its radio emission is 120 times lower . in @xmath1-rays , psr j0205 + 6449",
    "s luminosity is about 10% of the crab pulsar s but its efficiency , for an assumed 3.2 kpc distance , is about 0.20.3% compared to the crab s",
    "0.1% @xcite consistent with psr j0205 + 6449 being an older pulsar .",
    "some of this discrepancy can be attributed to the mounting evidence that the characteristic age of the pulsar ( given by @xmath16 @xmath17 5400 years ) is near to its true age @xcite , with the age estimates for the 3c58 snr ranging between 3000 and 5100 years , thus breaking the association between supernova sn1181 and /3c58 .",
    "recently , however , a re - analysis of the existing hi radio observations ( kothes 2010 ) suggests a distance as small as 2 kpc for 3c 58 and an age as low as @xmath0 1000 years , reopening the debate on its association with sn1181 .    the multi - wavelength properties , age , and energetics of  combine to make it a likely candidate for optical emission studies .",
    "if we assume that the pulsar s optical luminosity scales with the light cylinder magnetic field @xmath18 @xcite , then we estimate that it should have a visual magnitude in the range 2325 , depending on interstellar absorption and effects of beaming geometry .",
    "the first deep observations of 3c58 showed evidence of an optical nebulosity at the same location as the x - ray counterpart to psr j0205 + 6449 but could not resolve the pulsar optical counterpart .",
    "the motivation behind this work was to identify a candidate optical counterpart to psr j0205 + 6449 using observations taken under the 2009 international time programme at the la palma observatory ( pi : a. shearer ) , combined with observations recently obtained with the 10.4 m gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) as well as archival gemini and _ hubble space telescope _",
    "( _ hst _ ) images . table 1 reports the summary of the   observations with the different facilities .",
    "we first observed the  field with the 2.5 m uk isaac newton telescope ( int ) at the la palma observatory ( roque de los muchachos , canary islands , spain ) on 2009 august 3 .",
    "we used the wide field camera ( wfc ) , a mosaic of 4 thinned eev ccds , with an unbinned pixel size of 033 and with a field  of  view of @xmath19 , including the @xmath0 1gap between the chips .",
    "we only observed through the harris r - band filter ( @xmath20 ; @xmath21 ) for a total integration time of 7320 seconds , with an average airmass of 1.35 and a seeing of 13 .",
    "observations were performed in grey time , with the moon at an angular distance of @xmath22 but mostly below the horizon at the moment of the observations .",
    "the integration was split in shorter dithered exposures to remove cosmic ray hits and compensate for the gaps between the ccd chips .",
    "on 2009 august 20 and 21 , we re - observed the   field with the 3.5 m italian telescopio nazionale galileo ( tng ) , also at the la palma observatory .",
    "we used the dolores ( device optimized for the low resolution ) camera , a single chip e2v ccd with a field  of - view of @xmath23 and a pixel size of 0252 .",
    "we observed through the standard johnson v ( @xmath24 ; @xmath25 ) and r ( @xmath26 ; @xmath27 ) filters for total integration times of 6060 and 4830 seconds , respectively . in both cases ,",
    "the average airmass was around 1.5 and the seeing @xmath28 .",
    "observations were performed in dark time .",
    "for both the int and tng images , we applied standard data reduction ( bias subtraction and flat - fielding ) using the tools in the iraf packages mscred and ccdred .",
    "the dithered exposures were then aligned , stacked , and filtered for cosmic - rays so as to produce mosaic images .",
    "we obtained additional observations of the  field with the gtc at the la palma observatory on 2011 september 1 and 2011 november 20 as part of the spanish time programme ( pi : n. rea ) .",
    "we observed  with the optical system for imaging and low resolution integrated spectroscopy ( osiris ) .",
    "the instrument is equipped with a two - chip e2v ccd detector with a nominal field  of  view of @xmath29 , which is actually decreased to @xmath30 due to the vignetting of one of the two chips .",
    "the unbinned pixel size of the ccd is 0125 .",
    "we took a sequence of dithered exposures in the sdss r ( @xmath31 ; @xmath32 ) and i ( @xmath33 ; @xmath34 ) bands on the first and second night , respectively , with exposure time of 140 seconds to minimise the saturation of bright stars in the field and correct for the fringing .",
    "the pulsar was positioned at the nominal aim point in chip 2 .",
    "observations were performed with an average airmass of 1.25 for both the r and i bands .",
    "seeing conditions were @xmath35 and @xmath3610 for the first and second night , respectively .",
    "in both nights , observations were performed in dark time and under clear conditions . for the i-band observations ,",
    "no valid sky - flats were taken for the night of november 20 , therefore we used closest  in  time sky - flats taken on november 17 .",
    "as done for the int and tng data , we reduced the data using standard tools in the iraf package ccdred .",
    "we then stacked and averaged the single dithered exposures using the task drizzle that also performs the cosmic - ray filtering .",
    ".observation log for the psr j0205 + 6449 observations [ cols=\"<,^,^,>,^ \" , ]     [ comp1 ]      we computed the ratio between the x - ray and optical fluxes of  from the available _ chandra _ and gemini measurements",
    ". the spectral fit of marelli ( 2012 ) , based on a pl plus bb model , gives an unabsorbed x - ray flux @xmath37 erg cm@xmath10 s@xmath9 in the 0.310 kev energy range for the pl component only , whereas the total x - ray flux is @xmath39 erg cm@xmath10 s@xmath9 .",
    "hereafter , we assume the total x - ray flux as a reference . on the basis of the gemini g detection , and using the same extinction correction as above",
    ", we computed the unabsorbed flux of the pulsar in the g band would be @xmath40 erg cm@xmath10 s@xmath9 . by assuming a distance of 3.2 kpc , the unabsorbed fluxes give g-band and x - ray luminosities of @xmath41 erg s@xmath9 and @xmath42 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "this gives an optical  to  x - ray luminosity ratio @xmath43 .",
    "similarly , we computed the unabsorbed optical  to@xmath1-ray luminosity ratio . as a reference",
    ", we assumed the @xmath1-ray flux above 100 mev measured by _",
    "fermi _ , @xmath44 erg cm@xmath10 s@xmath9 ( abdo et al .",
    "for the assumed distance of 3.2 kpc the @xmath1-ray luminosity of   is @xmath45 erg s@xmath9 .",
    "this gives a luminosity ratio @xmath46 .",
    "the computed optical , x - ray , and @xmath1-ray luminosities of , together with their ratios , are listed in table 3 , where they are compared with the corresponding values measured for the other @xmath1-ray pulsars identified in the optical . as a reference , for all pulsars we assumed the same pulsar distances as used in abdo et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , the unabsorbed x - ray fluxes in the 0.310 kev energy range listed in marelli ( 2012 ) , and the @xmath1-ray fluxes above 100 mev listed in abdo et al .",
    "we computed the optical luminosities according to the observed v - band magnitudes and extinction @xmath47 ( mignani 2011 ) .",
    "as seen ,   would be the @xmath1-ray pulsar with the second highest optical luminosity after the crab pulsar , as expected from its low spin - down age ( @xmath48 5400 year ) .",
    "the optical  to  x - ray and optical ",
    "to@xmath1-ray luminosity ratios of  would be consistent with those measured for other young pulsars ( @xmath49 kyr ) , with the crab pulsar being that with the highest ratios .",
    "however , the luminosity ratios for  would be larger than those of the slightly older vela pulsar ( @xmath50 kyr ) , owing to the fact that the latter is about two orders of magnitude fainter in the optical .",
    "we also computed the ratio between the derived optical luminosity @xmath51 erg s@xmath9 of  and its rotational energy loss @xmath52 erg s@xmath9 . assuming a 3.2 kpc distance",
    ", we obtained @xmath53 .",
    "again , in table [ comp1 ] this value is compared with those of the other @xmath1-ray pulsars identified in the optical domain .",
    "interestingly enough , the optical efficiency for , defined as @xmath54 , would be lower than for the other young pulsars ( crab and psr b1509@xmath658 ) but higher than the vela pulsar , confirming a trend for a decrease in the optical emission efficiency of young pulsars as a function of the spin - down age .",
    "the existence of such a trend has been already proposed ( e.g. zharikov et al .  2006 ) , but , so far , the assumption only relied on the computed lower emission efficiency of the vela pulsar with respect to the other young pulsars crab , psr b1509@xmath658 , and psr b0540@xmath669 , with the latter ( @xmath55 ) not listed in table 3 because it has not been yet detected in @xmath1-rays .",
    "thus , it has been unclear whether the optical emission efficiency of vela - like pulsars was indeed intrinsically lower than the crab - like ones , or vela stood out as a peculiar case .",
    "the probable optical identification of the @xmath05400 year - old , which is ideally half way between the two classes , now represents an important piece of evidence in favour of this interpretation .",
    "the upper limits on the optical luminosities of vela - like @xmath1-ray pulsars , such as psr b1706@xmath644 , psr j1357@xmath66429 , psr j1028@xmath65819 , psr j0007 + 7303 ( mignani et al .  1999 ; 2011 ; 2012b ; 2013 ) and psr j1048@xmath65832 ( razzano et al .  2013 ) , are consistent with this trend . of course",
    ", the optical identification of some of these pulsars will eventually give the long sought proof .",
    "such a trend can be interpreted as the result of the secular decrease of the pulsar non - thermal optical luminosity , an effect predicted by pacini & salvati ( 1983 ) as a result of the pulsar spin down .",
    "we note that the optical emission ( non - thermal ) efficiency tends to increase again for the middle - aged pulsars ( psr b0656 + 14 and geminga ) .",
    "we performed multi - band optical observations of  with a variety of ground - based facilities , including the 8 m gemini and 10.4 m gtc telescopes , and the _ hst_. we detected a possible candidate counterpart to the pulsar , with an i-band magnitude of 25.5 ( 5.5@xmath3 detection ) , based upon its positional coincidence with the recently measured _",
    "chandra _ and radio coordinates ( bietenholz et al .",
    "thus ,  would possibly be the fourteenth pulsar with either an identified or proposed optical counterpart ( mignani 2011 ) , and the eighth of the @xmath1-ray pulsars detected by _ fermi_.",
    "the pulsar s spectrum would be consistent with a pl with photon index @xmath4 , similar to the x - ray one ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "the multi - wavelength sed of  show that the optical fluxes would lie below and above the extrapolations in the optical domain of the x and @xmath1-ray pl , respectively , indicating a break in the optical / x - ray region , after that in the x/@xmath1-ray .",
    "the optical luminosity , @xmath56 erg s@xmath9 , would imply an emission efficiency @xmath57 , higher than the two times older vela pulsar , confirming a trend for a decrease of the optical emission efficiency with the spin - down age in young pulsars . due to the presence of a bright pwn ,",
    "deeper high spatial resolution observations with the _ hst _ are better suited to resolve the presence of a point source , confirm the optical identification of , and better study its spectrum . moreover , monitoring for changes in the flux of the candidate counterpart on a few month / year time scale would allow one to rule out the possibility that it is an emission knot in the pwn .",
    "based on observations made with the gran telescopio canarias ( gtc ) , installed in the spanish observatorio del roque de los muchachos of the instituto de astrofsica de canarias , in the island of la palma . the research leading to these results has received funding from the european commission seventh framework programme ( fp7/2007 - 2013 ) under grant agreement n. 267251 .",
