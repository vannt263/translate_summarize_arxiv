    "it has been noticed that extra dimension can provide an elegant mechanism to generate hierarchical yukawa couplings @xcite . the quark and lepton fields can be quasi - localized in extra dimension in a natural manner , and then their 4-dimensional ( 4d ) yukawa couplings are determined by the wavefunction overlap factor @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a combination of mass parameters in higher dimensional theory and @xmath4 is the length of extra dimension .",
    "this allows that hierarchical yukawa couplings are obtained from fundamental mass parameters having the same order of magnitude .",
    "extra dimension has been known to be useful also for constructing a natural model of gauge unification @xcite .",
    "supersymmetric 4d grand unified theories ( guts ) successfully accomodate gauge coupling unification , however suffer from some difficulties such as the doublet - triplet splitting problem and the proton decay problem .",
    "these problems can be elegantly solved in gut on orbifold with gauge symmetry broken by boundary conditions @xcite .",
    "it is straightforward to implement the idea of dynamical quasi - localization in orbifold gut to get hierarchical yukawa couplings as well as successful gauge unification @xcite .    in any gut ,",
    "heavy particle threshold effects at gut symmetry breaking scale should be taken into account for a precision analysis of low energy gauge couplings @xmath5 . in conventional 4d gut ,",
    "those threshold corrections to @xmath6 are generically of the order of @xmath7 and thus _ not _ so important , _ unless _ the model contains a large number of superheavy particles which become massive as a consequence of gut symmetry breaking or some of superheavy masses are hierarchically different from each other @xcite .",
    "as was pointed out a long time ago , higher dimensional field theory and/or string theory contain ( infinitely ) many kaluza - klein ( kk ) or stringy modes , so can have a sizable threshold correction @xcite . therefore it is essential to include stringy and/or kk threshold correction in the precision analysis of low energy couplings in string and/or higher dimensional field theories . in this paper , we wish to examine the kk threshold corrections in generic 5d orbifold field theories in which hierarchical 4d yukawa couplings are generated through quasi - localization .",
    "as we will see , the kk threshold corrections to @xmath6 in such models are generically of the order of @xmath8 , so can significantly affect gauge coupling unification .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we discuss the kk spectrum and zero mode wave functions of generic scalar and spinor fields in 5d theory compactified on @xmath9 . in sec .",
    "iii , we discuss the 4d yukawa couplings of those quasi - localized scalar and fermion zero modes . in sec .",
    "iv , we compute kk threshold corrections in generic 5d theories on @xmath10 . in sec .",
    "v , we use these results to derive the kk correction to the _ predicted _ value of the low energy qcd coupling constant in 5d gut on orbifold .",
    "we then construct a class of supersymmetric 5d orbifold guts which generate hierarchical yukawa couplings through dynamical quasi - localization while keeping successful gauge coupling unification .",
    "vi is the conclusion .",
    "in this section , we analyze the kk wave functions and spectrums of scalar and spinor fields in 5d theory compactified on @xmath9 .",
    "our major concern is the dynamical quasi - localization of zero mode wavefunctions which would result in hierarchical 4d yukawa couplings .",
    "we also consider the full kk spectrums which will be relevant for the discussion of kk threshold corrections to low energy gauge couplings . throughout this paper",
    ", we will use the convention for @xmath11 which is given by the following transformation of the fifth spacetime coordinate @xmath12 : z_2 : y -y , z_2 : y+r -y+r .",
    "so the fundamental domain of @xmath13 corresponds to @xmath14 .",
    "let us first consider a 5d complex scalar field with an action : -d^5x , [ scalaraction ] and the orbifold boundary conditions : & & ^zz^(-y)=z^zz^(y ) , + & & ^zz^(-y+r)=z^^zz^ ( y+r ) , where @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",

    "the kk spectrums of @xmath30 are given by & & ( m^++_0)^2=m^2_++-^2_++ , + & & ( m^++_n)^2=m^2_+++ , for @xmath37 being a positive integer .",

    "so any massless brane fermion can be considered as a bulk fermion in the large kink mass limit .",
    "to discuss flavor hierarchy arising from quasi - localization , let us consider a generic 5d theory containing arbitrary number of scalar and fermion fields : s&=&-d^5x  [ d_m_id^m^*_i + (m_i^2_ij+2_ij(y)- 2^_ij(y - r))_i^*_j .",

    ", we also assume that yukawa couplings in 5d theory exist only at the fixed points , which is assured by 5d susy in supersymmetric theories",

    "the physical interpretation of this result is simple . if @xmath117 , the corresponding zero modes are quasi - localized at @xmath31 , so the yukawa couplings are exponentially suppressed as they originate from @xmath33 . on the other hand , for @xmath118",

    "if the fundamental theory at @xmath98 is weakly coupled , simple dimensional analysis would suggest that the dimensionless @xmath119 are of order unity or less .",

    "<S> dynamical quasi - localization of matter fields in extra dimension is an elegant mechanism to generate hierarchical 4-dimensional yukawa couplings . </S>",
    "<S> we point out that a bulk matter field whose zero mode is quasi - localized can give a large kaluza - klein threshold correction to low energy gauge couplings , which is generically of the order of @xmath0 , so it can significantly affect gauge coupling unification . </S>",
    "<S> we compute such threshold corrections in generic 5-dimensional theories compactified on @xmath1 , and apply the result to grand unified theories on orbifold generating small yukawa couplings through quasi - localization . </S>"
