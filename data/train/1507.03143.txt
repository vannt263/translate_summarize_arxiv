    "recently it has been reported the detection of intense radio emission ( the highest ever detected in an active red - dwarf ) coinciding with the time of the first and the second flares reported in this paper @xcite . because the two components of the system are separated by 3.6au ( @xmath22 ) the two stars are not magnetically interacting .",
    "therefore the intense radio emission has been interpreted as a consequence of the processes occurring in one of the stars ( we will be referring to this as hereafter ) . for this star to rotate so rapidly",
    "a tertiary close companion ( i.e. apart from the distant known companion ) is expected to exist , but recent studies @xcite indicate that this might not be the case and that the youth of the system is the cause .",

    "the light - curve was fitted well with a spot of approximately 3.5 degrees in projected radius with a temperature of 1.3 times the surrounding photosphere .",

    "initial reports of the optical light - curve indicated significant enhancement in brightness at the position of the transient and a subsequent fading of 0.92mag / hour for the first hour of observation after the peak ( 23:30 - 00:30 ut ) , followed by a decay rate of 0.34mag / hour for the rest 2.5 hours of observation @xcite .",
    "the magic telescopes started observations of the transient event at 21:08:54 ut , about 30s after the alert was received , and kept collecting data for the next 3.3h .",
    "a preliminary analysis gave an integral flux upper limit of @xmath30 at @xmath31 with a confidence limit of 95% , corresponding to 5.3% of the crab nebula flux in this energy range , assuming a crab - like spectral index @xcite .",
    "several more smaller flares were observed with uvot and xrt @xcite after the initial trigger .",
    "they decreased in peak brightness as the overall brightness decreased .",
    "when the _ swift _ x - ray telescope ( xrt ) started observing at @xmath32 , the soft x - ray 0.3 - 10kev rate of dg  cvn was @xmath33@xmath11 and then decayed moderately , reaching a count rate of @xmath34@xmath11 by @xmath35s after the trigger .",
    "the soft x - ray emission had declined to a level of 4 - 15@xmath11 , but at @xmath36 was observed to have had a second , smaller flare that peaked at @xmath37 in the xrt detector .",
    "we will refer to this as the second flare hereafter .",
    "the `` pi of the sky '' ( pi ) experiment is designed to monitor a large fraction of the sky with a high time resolution ( 10s ) and self - triggering capabilities @xcite .",

    "as can be seen , the optical flash only lasted about 60s , with the source brightening by over 4mag , to @xmath41 at maximum ( occurring at @xmath42s ) , and ending before the maximum of the hard x - ray emission which triggered the bat alert ( @xmath10 ) .",

    "_ bootes _ ( acronym of the _ burst observer and optical transient exploring system _ ) is a world - wide network of robotic telescopes . it was originally designed from a spanish - czech collaboration that started in 1998 @xcite . the telescopes are located in spain ( _ bootes_1 , _ bootes_2 and _ bootes_ir ) , new zealand ( _ bootes_3 ) and china ( _ bootes_4 ) . currently , one optical spectrograph is built and working in the _ bootes _ network , i.e. _ colores _ at _ bootes_2 .",

    "it works in the wavelength range of ( @xmath44)@xmath45 and has a spectral resolution of ( @xmath46)@xmath45 . the primary scientific target of the spectrograph is prompt grb follow - up , particularly for the estimation of redshift , but it is also used to study optical transients .",
    "_ colores _ is a multi - mode instrument that can switch from imaging a field to spectroscopy by rotating wheel - mounted grisms , slits and filters within an otherwise fixed optical system . _",
    "bootes_2/_colores _ started observing at @xmath3min and started to take spectra later at @xmath47d ( i.e. @xmath48h ) after @xmath10 , following the evolution of the source for several months .",
    "in this paper we report only on the observations when the source showed emission balmer lines ( i.e. when it was `` active '' ) .",
    "see tab .  1 and 2 and fig .  3 for a log of the observations and the evolution of the spectra during the period of activity from the source ( @xmath49d )",

    "we used three grisms with three different spectral resolutions , i.e. r1000r , r2500r and r2000b .",
    "the blue spectra , r2000b , cover the ( 3950 - 5700)@xmath45 energy range and intense balmer emission lines can be seen ( @xmath53,@xmath54,@xmath55 and @xmath56 ) at ( 4861,4341,4102,3970)@xmath45 , respectively .    in the _ osiris _ red spectra",

    "they are very similar to the spectra obtained with _ bootes-2_/colores , with the most noticeable features being the presence of molecular absorption bands and the intense @xmath57 emission line , at @xmath58 , typical for the spectra emitted by `` active '' late - spectral type stars .",
    "we also obtained a medium - high spectral resolution spectrum with the _ spectral camera with optical reducer for photometric and interferometric observations _",

    "( sao ) on may 8@xmath59 , 2014 .",
    "less intense balmer emission lines can be seen .",
    "this indicates that the source still maintained a ( low ) level of activity at this time .",
    "we observed with the _ calar alto fiber - fed echelle spectrograph _ ( cafe ) , located at the focal plane of the calar alto ( caha )  ( 2.2 m ) telescope , on 20140615 ( see tab .  2 ) .",
    "this is a high ( @xmath60 ) resolution spectrograph working in the @xmath61 ) wavelength range .",
    "the spectral resolution is @xmath62 .",
    "the high - resolution spectrum of during 20140615 , at the 2.2 m caha ( @xmath14cafe ) , contains plenty of absorption lines ( mainly tio bands ) , with few emission lines .",
    "the only instances of significantly broad ( absorption ) lines are cited in the following .",
    "balmer lines are not seen either in absorption or in emission . indeed , the spectrum is typical of a cold late - type ( `` non - active '' at that time ) star .",
    "there are prominent broad absorption lines at @xmath63 , that dominate the spectrum in this energy range .",
    "they correspond to vo molecular transitions .",
    "these molecular transitions appear only for late - type m dwarf stars ( m7 or later ; @xcite ) .",
    "therefore the red - dwarf might be smaller than previously considered .",
    "nevertheless , a proper spectral classification of the emitting star on the basis of the observed high - resolution spectral features is out of the scope of this paper .",
    "we observe at @xmath64 the fe i doublet in absorption .",
    "the presence of this doublet is indicative of a late spectral type star in a `` non - active '' state at that time .",
    "this absorption doublet line disappears when the star turns activity on , due to the chromospheric heating produced during the stellar flares @xcite .",

    "the delay of the initial peak of the x - ray emission ( _ swift_/bat in the 15 - 25kev energy range ) with respect to the peak in the optical is clearly seen in fig .  1 .",
    "we ascribe these observations to the so - called neupert effect @xcite , observed before ( apart from the sun ) in uv  ceti and proxima centauri @xcite with radio and x - ray observations of normal stellar flares . from the sun and",
    "these stars it was seen that the x - ray light curve is observed to follow approximately the time integral of the v - band emission ( radio emission in the case of the sun ) .",
    "the interpretation is given in the framework of the _ chromospheric evaporation _",
    "@xcite , i.e. high - energy electrons travel along magnetic fields , where the high - pitch angle population emits prompt gyrosynchrotron emission and the low - pitch angle population impacts in the chromosphere to produce prompt radio / v band emission .",
    "the hot thermal plasma ( soft x - rays ) evolves as a consequence of the accumulated energy deposition , hence the integral relation .",
    "the novelty in our case is that this relationship is observed to happen in the hard x - ray emission as well , contrary to previous expectations .    in the _ chromospheric evaporation _",
    "the soft x - ray emission is a signature of the thermal emission from the heated plasma .",
    "this plasma is heated after the impact by the accelerated particles , that are responsible for the early optical / radio - emission .",
    "therefore , the detection of hard x - ray emission following the integral of the impulsive optical emission is something unexpected .",
    "this indicates that , contrary to what has been previously understood , either the plasma heats - up to @xmath65kev or that the particles emit radiation following a non - thermal kinetic distribution .      in the following we report on the optical spectroscopic observations performed with _",
    "bootes_2/_colores _ from the beginning of the second flare ( approx . )",
    "the optical spectrum from is characterized by a strong and variable red continuum with broad molecular tio , cai , mgi , nai absorption lines / bands superimposed .",
    "there are also intense balmer emission lines .",
    "we notice that the intensities of the lines reported in this paper are not absolute fluxes , but relative values with respect to the continuum . to calculate the relative intensities reported in this work , local continuum segments were taken at @xmath66 for each @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 emission balmer line , respectively .",
    "we label the continuum calculated from these segments `` pseudocontinuum '' , since it is not the true continuum , because it is very much affected by absorption band features in the spectrum ( not constant a priori ) .",
    "we considered these balmer emission lines to be excellent indicators of the spectral variability compared to the @xmath57 line .",
    "we did this in order to avoid possible effects due to ( minimal ) saturation , because the @xmath57 line was very bright .",
    "the `` relative '' intensity of these lines ( with respect to the continuum ) is variable with time , showing a constant `` plateau '' during the early phase of the burst ( @xmath67d ) , with the exception of a `` depression '' ( i.e. broad minimum at @xmath68ks ) that coincides both in time and duration with the second flare event ( fig .  4 ) .",
    "after the `` plateau '' , the ( relative ) intensity of the balmer lines progressively decreased with time until @xmath69d .",
    "eventually they remained minimally oscillating around a mean value close to unity ( i.e. the continuum flux level ) .",
    "the long term evolution of the spectrum can be roughly characterized by the decrease of the intensity of the balmer emission lines . at the early stage of the burst ( @xmath70d )",
    "these lines are prominent and clearly visible in the spectrum .",
    "these lines show that the star is chromospherically `` active '' at the moment they are present . eventually ( @xmath71d )",
    ", these lines disappear and the spectrum becomes emission - featureless .",
    "this is the typical spectrum of a `` non - active '' cold red - dwarf star .",
    "but apart from the intense balmer emission lines and broad molecular bands there are further weaker absorption and emission lines .",
    "we based our identification of these lines on the similarities with those shown in the spectra from cold red - dwarf stars @xcite .",
    "we find a number of spectral line features , at @xmath72 .",
    "the first and the second are emission - like and the third shows an emission@xmath14absorption - line feature . after looking in more detail into the time evolution of the @xmath73 emission - like line we realized that this feature is close to the boundary of the tio absorption band .",
    "the feature at @xmath74 looks like a weak emission that is only sometimes present .",
    "the @xmath75 feature is often seen in absorption but sometimes it looks like a combination of absorption line and emission on its blue wing .",
    "these two lines correspond to tio ( @xmath76 ) and mgh+tio ( @xmath77 ) absorption bands , when compared with the higher resolution osiris r2000b spectra taken during the 3rd day of _ bootes_2 observations .",
    "nevertheless , still marginal residual emission at @xmath77 is seen in the osiris r2000b ( we will discuss this feature hereafter ) . also time evolution of the caoh depression ( at @xmath78 )",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "the presence of the caoh depression is a way to distinguish normal m stars from me ( emission ) stars @xcite .",
    "the caoh depression was weaker in the early phase of the burst ( @xmath79d ) and then it increased in the late phase ( @xmath80d ) .",
    "a wider broad dip minimum in the strength of the caoh similar to that seen for balmer lines at @xmath81d is also observed for caoh .    in fig .",
    "4 we show that both @xmath53 line and the caoh absorption band decrease in relative strength at the time of the second flare . the time evolution of the balmer lines and the caoh absorption line are correlated during the early phase of the burst @xmath82d .",
    "close to the end of the burst , the balmer emission lines become marginal and the caoh absorption band maximal .",
    "we will discuss hereafter that both caoh and balmer lines features are good tracers of the behaviour of the continuum from the source . in fig .",
    "4 , we show that the line at @xmath73 ( tio ) is the least time variable feature .",
    "we have checked whether this feature could be a good indicator for the local continuum taken around @xmath53 and found similar values to those obtained when using the local pseudo - continuum .",
    "this makes us confident on our choice of the local continua when calculating line ( relative ) intensities .",
    "there are also transient emission features in our spectra at @xmath83 .",
    "these lines are compatible with blue - shifted mg  i , he  d3 and he  ii ( at @xmath84 , respectively ) .",
    "they are blue - shifted by @xmath85 ( @xmath86 in the case of he  ii ) , i.e. the same amount of shift as the @xmath57 line ( as shown hereafter ) , thus indicate chromospheric origin like the balmer emission lines .",
    "indeed , these lines have been seen during solar total eclipses @xcite , supporting their chromospheric origin .",
    "also , the @xmath87 line appears in emission in very strong solar flares ( @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "apart from this , these transient lines are absent during most of our spectral observations .",
    "namely , these lines show an increase of their intensity during @xmath88ks , coinciding with the time of the second flare event ( see fig .  3 ) .",
    "during the rest of the time the @xmath77 feature becomes purely a mgh+tio absorption feature .",

    "we notice that the previously reported age ( @xmath101myr ; @xcite ) is not wrong and agrees with our estimation only if we consider that it is the age of the system after achieving the zams ( which usually takes a time of @xmath33myr of gravitational contraction from the original stellar cloud ) .      in this paper",
    "we have studied the spectral evolution of during an episode of important optical and hard x - ray activity . during this period",
    "at least two flares have been detected to occur quasi - simultaneously in both energy bands .",
    "we have explained the origin of the ( few tens of seconds ) hard x - ray delay with respect to the optical emission ( fig .",
    "1 ) by the neupert effect , which was observed before ( apart from the sun ) in uv ceti and proxima centauri during normal soft x - ray flares .",
    "the novelty of our study is that we observe this effect , but for the hard x - ray emission .",
    "the x - ray luminosities during the peaks of emission are @xmath102 .",
    "although the flare x - ray luminosities are certainly high similar values ( @xmath103 ) have been detected for a dozen of cases in main - sequence red - dwarf stars .",
    "recently these values have been superseded by an intense episode of activity from the red - dwarf binary system sz  psc @xcite .",
    "also the duration of the flaring episode is no exception , with similar values reported for the ( 9day ) flare of cf  tuc observed by @xcite and the previous super - flare from ev  lac @xcite .",
    "such episodes of increased x - ray / optical activity have never been observed in the sun so far .",
    "however , the same physics underlying the giant x - ray / optical solar flares serves to explain the superflares observed in active - like stars ( as ; @xcite ) .",
    "nevertheless , since the most powerful solar flares have been of only about @xmath104 @xcite the scale - up of solar flares models would require enormous starspots ( up to 48 degrees in latitude / longitude extent ) to match stellar superflares , thus much bigger than any sunspots in the last 4 centuries of solar observations .",
    "therefore @xcite conjecture that one condition for sun - like stars to produce superflares is to host a dynamo that is much stronger than that of the sun .",
    "it is also worth to mention that some recent studies @xcite point out to both the ( possible ) few instances and the possibility of solar - type stars undergoing superflares with luminosities as high as @xmath105 under certain conditions , by using data from the _ kepler _ satellite @xcite .    in",
    "our work optical spectral observations began one hour after the onset of the burst , thus allowing a detailed study of the spectral properties of during the evolution of the second flare .",
    "balmer emission lines are prominent during the whole period of activity of the star .",
    "the optical spectra are similar to the spectra emitted by `` active '' late - spectral type stars .",
    "a significant decrease in the ( relative to the continuum ) intensity of the balmer lines is observed during the second flare ( fig .  2 ) .",
    "balmer lines represent the formation and evolution of the optically thin medium above the stellar photosphere ( i.e. the chromosphere ) .",
    "on the other hand , the variable strengths of the caoh and tio features represent the variations of the photosphere of itself ( where the absorption lines and the continuum emission are thought to come from ) .",
    "the balmer and caoh depressions are due to an increase of the continuum emission as well .",
    "the presence of absorption bands is due to the molecules present in the photosphere of . as the continuum level increases the ( relative to the continuum ) strength of the balmer lines and the caoh absorption band decreases , as observed during the second flare .",
    "therefore , the decrease of intensity of these spectral features is not real , but an artifact of an increase of the surrounding continuum .",
    "it is in the chromosphere where the balmer and the rest of emission lines originate .",
    "the chromosphere is more tenuous and hotter than the photosphere .",
    "therefore only emission lines from light elements can be seen , except in the coronal transition region , where the high temperatures can ionize fe .",
    "an increase in the intensity of the mg  i(@xmath106 ) , he  d3(@xmath87 ) ( and he  ii ; @xmath107 ) emission lines have been detected during the second flare of .",
    "this indicates a correlation between the photospheric and the chromospheric activity . in other words ,",
    "a change in the properties of the continuum is related to properties of the chromosphere of the red - dwarf star",
    ". we will discuss in the following on the most likely origin of this change .    the super - flare observed from during april 2014",
    "may correspond to an episodic high - intensity flare event from a red - dwarf star .",
    "this flare event is originated from one or more active regions on the star . if there is only one active region giving rise to the observed flaring activity this star would be spinning very rapidly , with a period of a few hours ( @xmath108h ) , thus giving rise to the optical phenomenology observed .",
    "photometric studies of performed earlier have revealed a periodicity of @xmath25d @xcite .",
    "indeed , @xcite claimed that a hot spot model fit their single - band data best .",
    "this period is very close to the elapsed time between the first and the second flares , which might argue in favour of one hot spot being the responsible for both flares .",
    "nevertheless , the presence of a second active region ( responsible for the second flare ) can not be discarded .",
    "indeed , many active stars have active regions separated by 180 degrees in longitude .",
    "this would `` double '' the rotational period of the star .",
    "also , given that rapidly rotating stars often have large polar spots , the lack of a dimming of the second flare due to rotational modulation might also be due to the fact that the associated active region(s ) responsible for the optical flare might be also circumpolar .",
    "further spectroscopic and photometric observations of would help in order to identify which is ( are ) the active component(s ) , their inclination and the actual rotation of the star .",
    "the use of spatially resolved measurements and multi - band photometric data would help us to understand the exact origin of the variability .",
