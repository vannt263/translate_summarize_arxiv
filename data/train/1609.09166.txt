    "let us start with the experimental proposal .",
    "we consider a single trapped ion pumped by two pairs of orthogonal lasers in a configuration similar to the one we used to introduce the cross - cavity quantum rabi model @xcite , @xmath8 \\hat{\\sigma}_{j } \\bigg\\}.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the ion is described by the transition energy @xmath9 and the pauli matrices , @xmath10 with @xmath11 fulfilling the @xmath12 commutation relation , @xmath13 = 2i \\epsilon_{ijk } \\sigma_{k}$ ] .",

    "working in the lamb - dicke regime , @xmath19 , with one of each pair of driving fields tuned to the first blue- and the first red - sideband transitions plus a small detuning , @xmath20 with @xmath21 , we set the pump fields small detunings to be equal , @xmath22 , the phases to the values @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 , and tune the driving field strengths to deliver just one effective coupling strength , @xmath26 .",

    "it is well - known that it can be written as a hamiltonian model where the ion is coupled under jaynes - cumings and anti - jaynes - cummings dynamics to each of the fields with identical effective coupling strength @xcite , @xmath30 , \\label{eq : hjcajc }      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after using schwinger two - boson representation of @xmath12 to effect a rotation @xmath31 with @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "this new effective hamiltonian conserves the scaled difference between population inversions from the two @xmath12 representations , @xmath34 where the effective population inversion in the two - boson representation of @xmath12 is given by @xmath35 and we have added the constant to make it always integer , @xmath36 .",
    "note that this operator is composed by the excitation number from the jaynes - cummings and anti - jaynes - cummings models @xcite . in the laboratory frame , this operator , @xmath37 is related to the population inversion of just the qubit and the mixing rate of the vibrational modes , @xmath38 , and , of course , it is a conserved variable , @xmath39=0 $ ] with @xmath40 . at this point",
    ", we can make a stop and realize that the eigenstates of the vibrational state mixing rate are inherently entangled in the laboratory frame due to the @xmath41 rotation .",
    "in order to isolate the field dynamics , we can move into a frame defined by the population inversion difference @xmath42 rotating at the qubit frequency @xmath43 , implement a rotation of @xmath44 around @xmath45 , and , then , diagonalize the resulting hamiltonian in the qubit basis using the fulton - gouterman approach @xcite , @xmath46 where the fulton - gouterman transform is the following , @xmath47 with the two fields parity defined as @xmath48 , such that the effective field hamiltonians , @xmath49 \\hat{a}_{j}^{\\dagger } \\hat{a}_{j }   - \\frac{(-1)^{j}}{\\sqrt{2 } } g \\times \\nonumber \\\\ & &    \\times \\left\\ {   \\hat{a}_{j } \\left [ 1 \\pm ( -1)^{j } \\hat{\\pi}_{12 } \\right ] + \\left [ 1 \\pm ( -1)^{j}\\hat{\\pi}_{12 } \\right ] \\hat{a}_{j}^{\\dagger } \\right\\ } ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] describe two boson fields interacting through a nonlinear coupling that depends on the total parity . in summary , the mapping from the laboratory to the fulton - gouterman frame is provided by the unitary transformation , @xmath50 the conserved operator in the fulton - gouterman frame becomes a different scaled difference of population inversions of the two @xmath12 representations , @xmath51 where the operators associated to the excited and ground state diagonal components are diagonal themselves , @xmath52 such that , obviously , these pure field operators commute with their respective accompanying field hamiltonian , @xmath53=0 $ ] .",
    "thus , we can set ourselves to partition the whole hilbert space into subspaces that keep the average of these operators constant .",
    "starting from the vacuum state and verifying the action of the effective field hamiltonians , it is possible to partition the corresponding hilbert spaces as @xmath54 where the subspaces are span by what we will identify later on as parabose fock states of even order @xmath55 , @xmath56 with @xmath57 , and the following integer function , @xmath58 as expected , these subspaces conserve the difference in the population inversion , @xmath59 and cover it twice , once in the collection of subspaces @xmath60 and once in the set of @xmath61 subspaces .",
    "we can readily identify these subspaces in the laboratory frame as the eigenstates of schwinger two - boson operator @xmath62 for each and every representation defined by the total number of bosons in the vibrational modes .",
    "in these subspaces the effective field hamiltonians are driven nonlinear oscillators , @xmath63 where the auxiliary constants are given in the following , @xmath64e^{i\\pi n}-\\omega_{0}.      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and we have defined the creation and annihilation operators , @xmath65 given in terms of a nonlinear deformation function , @xmath66 and the standard boson operators for each subspace .",
    "we can calculate the actions of the nonlinear operators on the fock states of each subspace , @xmath67 and , most important at this point , the action of this particular combination on the vacuum state of each subspace , @xmath68 suggest that each subspace corresponds to a paraparticle hilbert space of even order @xmath69 @xcite .",
    "note that our quantum simulation will never provide ordinary bosons as they have odd order @xmath7 .",
    "it is straightforward to check that we have an even order parabose algebra in our hands , @xmath70 = 1 + ( 2n + 1 ) \\hat{\\pi}_{n } , \\nonumber \\\\      & \\left\\ { \\hat{a}_{n } , \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_{n } \\right\\ } = 2 \\hat{n}_{n } + 2(n + 1 ) , \\nonumber   \\\\      & \\left[\\hat{n}_{n } , \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_{n } \\right ] = \\hat{a}^{\\dagger}_{n } , \\quad   \\left[\\hat{n}_{n } , \\hat{a}_{n } \\right ] = - \\hat{a}_{n } ,      \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this helps us realize that the auxiliary field hamiltonians , @xmath71 are nothing else than displaced parabose oscillators plus an additional diagonal term that depends only on the parity , @xmath72",
    "note that in the case of @xmath73 , that is small driving field detunings @xmath74 , we recover a driven parabose oscillator of even order @xmath69 , @xmath75 we will now study this model in order to provide a particular example and create some intuition . in the standard boson case , which is not covered by our quantum simulation , it is straightforward to identify two extremal cases , one for free evolution , @xmath76 , where an initial fock state will only gather a phase proportional to the propagation time ; in our simulation this regime does not make sense because it implies the absence of driving fields . and the other for pure driving , @xmath77 , where an initial fock state will become a displaced number state due to the continuous pumping ; this can be explored for parabosons with our quantum simulation .",
    "another interesting regime for standard bosons occurs where the coupling is small with respect to the field frequency , @xmath78 , here an initial fock state will show coherent oscillations and also can be explored with our quantum simulation .",
    "these behaviors for standard bosons are easily visualized in the so - called glauber - fock oscillator from photonic waveguide arrays @xcite . in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1 ] we show that a similar type of dynamics occur in the driven parabose oscillator for the lowest order @xmath79 , that is @xmath80 .",
    "for example , let us consider as initial state , in the laboratory frame , the vacuum state of the subspace @xmath81 , that is , the ion in the ground state with vibrational modes cooled down to the lowest mechanical state , @xmath82 note that this state is an eigenstate of pure jaynes - cummings dynamics .",
    "this initial state shows coherent oscillation of the mean paraboson number in the small coupling regime with @xmath83 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](a ) .",
    "this coherent oscillation double the amplitude and have a slightly larger frequency than those obtained in the standard boson glauber - fock oscillator for exactly the same parameters .",
    "the mean paraboson number oscillation in the quantum simulation frame translate to oscillation of the population inversion in the laboratory frame , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](b ) , because the latter is related to the parity of the parabose state , @xmath84 for pure driving , @xmath77 , the initial parabose vacuum state becomes a gilmore - perelomov parabose coherent state , @xmath85 with coherent parameter equal to the scaled time , @xmath86 , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](c ) . in the laboratory frame",
    "we can write the @xmath79 parabose coherent state as a non - separable state , for the sake of space we will write it one step before the laboratory frame , @xmath87 where we have used the notation @xmath88 for the confluent hypergeometric function .",
    "it is possible to confirm numerically that these states have balanced even and odd parity components for large coherent parameters .",
    "this can also be seen in the laboratory frame through the population inversion , fig .",
    "[ fig : fig1](d ) .    , and",
    "corresponding population inversion in the laboratory frame , @xmath89 , for a starting @xmath90 parabose vacuum state under weak coupling , ( a)-(b ) @xmath91 , and pure pumping , ( c)-(d ) @xmath92 , dynamics . ]    in trapped ion experiments , the reconstruction of vibrational states from population inversion measurements is feasible .",
    "thus , a viable measurement scenario would stop the evolution of the simulation , turn off the interactions , and recover phase space information from each of the vibrational modes at a time following standard methods @xcite . this would allow to unmask the properties of parabose states , like the peculiar quadrature squeezing for a gilmore - perelomov parabose coherent state of order @xmath79 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : fig2 ] using husimi q - function of the first vibrational mode in the laboratory frame .",
    "we will cover the properties of gilmore - perelomov parabose coherent states in detail somewhere else .     under purely pumped dynamics , @xmath77 , and an initial state given by the parabose vacuum state of order @xmath79 .",
    "in summary , we have proposed a trapped ion configuration where the interaction of the ion internal degree of freedom with two orthogonal center of mass motion degrees of freedom can be reduced to that of an even order parabose oscillator .",
    "we have discussed in detail both the experimental proposal and the analytic approach that diagonalizes the system for the internal degree of freedom and , then , partitions the hilbert space for the vibrational degrees of freedom delivering hilbert subspaces corresponding to even order parabosons . as a particular example , we have focused on a pumped parabose oscillator and demonstrated that it can produce coherent oscillations of the mean paraboson number and gilmore - perelomov parabose coherent states that can be reconstructed in the laboratory frame through population inversion measurements .",
