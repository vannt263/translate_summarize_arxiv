    "the v1186 sco light curve exhibits many interesting features .",
    "the first notable feature was a sluggish rise to visual maximum .",
    "after discovery , v1186 sco required 6 days to reach its maximum at v = 9.6 .",
    "very few novae have exhibited such long pre - maximum behavior which is generally only found in very slow novae .",
    "another intriguing feature of the v1186 sco light curve is the strength of the second maximum that occurred about 9 days later after the first .",
    "this second maximum was extremely bright , only @xmath2 0.2 mag fainter than the primary maximum .",
    "if not for the @xmath2 1 mag decline twelve days after discovery , the early light curve evolution might be better described as a plateau , similar to that observed in v723  cas . while secondary maxima are not unusual in slower nova they do not usually approach that of the primary maximum ( see * ? ? ? * for numerous examples of nova light curves ) .",
    "for example , pw  vul displayed multiple secondary peaks in its light curve but they were all more than a magnitude fainter than at maximum .",
    "after the second peak in the v1186 sco light curve , the v magnitude showed a rapid decline passing its t@xmath0 point ( the time to decline 2 magnitudes from maximum ) in 20 days .",
    "subsequently , the v1186 sco light curve had two smaller peaks during its decline .",
    "these later peaks make it difficult to establish the t@xmath6 time ( the time to decline 3 magnitudes from maximum ) since the brightness fluctuated around v = 12.6 .",
    "v1186 sco first reached v = 12.6 after 45 days but then brightened and subsequently did not become fainter than v = 12.6 until 70 days after maximum . which decline value is representative of this nova ? the choice has significant consequences on speed - class classification @xcite , wd progenitor identification , and any physical parameters based on the derived decline times .",
    "after 100 days the v band light curve stabilized at about 13.5 magnitudes as the fading continuum was offset by emerging line emission , particularly from [ ] ( 5007 ) . according to duerbeck s study of about 100 galactic novae @xcite , the light curve of v1186 sco is classified as type bb ( `` decline with major fluctuations , _ e.g. , _ double or multiple maxima '' ) .",

    "the emergence of this line is typically taken as a sign that the outburst occurred on the surface of an onemg wd @xcite although @xcite and @xcite and others have argued that strong continuum emission from condensing dust in the ejecta may mask the presence of [ ] lines , especially if observations are obtained at low spectral resolution .",

    "in contrast , the forbidden lines , for instance [ ] 2.089@xmath1 m , display nearly symmetric profiles ( fig .",
    "[ profiles ] ) .",
    "the shell thus appears , as in many novae observed with sufficient spectral resolution , to be quite fragmented with density concentrations isolated in velocity ( and therefore in space ) within the ejecta . in this case , rather than representing an abundance inhomogeneity or an effect of the optical depth , the profiles can best be explained as local knots of emission at higher than quenching density . while the density variation is likely small ( a factor of 20 to 50% ) , this will need to be properly included in any further analysis for the abundance mixing within the ejecta .",
    "fitting the _ cloudy _  model spectral energy distribution to the dereddened e2 spectra also provides an estimate on the distance .",
    "however , before this can be done the observed e2 spectra must be placed on a common flux point since they were obtained at times when the visual light curve was nt constant .",
    "the visual light curve shows that when the _ spitzer _ spectra were obtained , v1186 sco was about 0.7 magnitude brighter than when the optical spectrum was taken .",
    "therefore the relative fluxes of the _ spitzer _ spectra were reduced by a factor of 1.85 .",
    "no relative flux adjustments were applied to the nir spectrum since there are no light curve measurements at that time .",
    "[ model - spec ] shows the model spectral energy distribution which fits the scaled and dereddened multiwavelength data assuming a distance of 5.5 kpc .",
    "this distance determination is farily robust as the model fits the emission line ratios and the continuum which are both sensitive to the reddening .",
    "if the luminosity of the wd was not constant during the e2 epoch but rather oscillating during the early outburst ( _ e.g. _ the super soft source x - ray luminosities of @xcite and @xcite ) then the derived distance is a lower limit . as a check",
    "we apply our _ cloudy _",
    "luminosity to a different epoch , namely visual maximum . with v@xmath41 = 9.6 , an e(b - v )",
    "= 0.45 , and assuming a bolometric correction of 0 at maximum gives a distance of 5.4 kpc , consisitent with our previous value . with the uncertainty in the reddening , which is likely the largest source of uncertainty ,",
    "we adopt a distance of 5.5@xmath130.5 kpc and a m@xmath26 of @xmath42 mag for v1186 sco .",
    "we also attempted to find better fitting _ cloudy _",
    "models to the e2 spectra with larger e(b - v ) values as indicated by the @xcite reddening map . increasing e(b - v ) to 0.6",
    "the @xmath35 of the best fit model was much higher , @xmath275 , and the fit of the model continuum to the data was significantly worse , particularly at shorter wavelengths . assuming the pw vul m@xmath26 of @xmath43 , the distance at this reddening is 7.7 kpc . however , to match the dereddened spectra to the best fit model at 7.7 kpc also requires invoking a covering factor of 0.6 which was not required in the low e(b - v ) model .",
    "_ cloudy _",
    "models fits to spectra dereddened greater than this become progressively worse and indicate that our adopted e(b - v ) is likely correct .",
    "the oxygen and nitrogen enhancements predicted by the photionization analysis are expected from a thermonuclear runaway in the accretion plus wd material mixture on a co white dwarf .",
    "carbon may also be enhanced but the best lines to determine this are in the uv .",
    "the slight enhancement of neon is probably due to the small amount of @xmath44ne in the wd which is produced by helium burning while still a giant .",
    "nucleosynthesis models that incorporate some @xmath44ne in the co wd composition will produce ejecta with slightly enhanced neon abundances .",
    "the presence of the other heavy elements likely reflects that of the secondary star since these elements are only created under the extremely high temperature thermonuclear runaways found on very massive wds .",
    "v1186 sco was the first co - type nova to reveal the strong [ ] line common in onemg novae using moderate resolution spectroscopic techniques , but other co novae may have have also shown this line if observed early enough in their evolution prior to the condensation of optically thick dust shells .",
    "@xcite reported that [ ] line was weak in the day 396 spectrum of v705 cas and may have been present as early as day 251 .",
    "the [ ] line was also observed in v1425 aql 650 days after outburst when the nova was still in a high ionization state @xcite .",
    "_ spitzer _ observations of future early co novae spectra will provide additional estimates of the amount of neon enhancement .",
    "these results may even provide observational clues as to the nature of the mixing mechanism and the compositions of co wds .",
    "the absolute v band magnitude determined from the photoionization analysis is very faint at -5.5@xmath130.5 .",
    "this is consistent with the results of @xcite who found that @xmath45m@xmath46@xmath47 for historic galactic novae of the b - d light curve class .",
    "our results imply that v1186 sco is one of the faintest galactic nova ever discovered .",
    "in addition , the faint absolute magnitude of v1186 sco shows that the results of mmrd relationships are suspect for novae with irregular light curves .",
    "v1186 sco was observed with _ spitzer _ during two epochs during its first year of outburst as part of a cycle 1 too program for classical novae . * its general properties",
    "are summarized in table  [ tab : v86props ] . *",
    "the _ spitzer _ spectra were combined with ground based optical and nir spectra obtained during the same epochs .",
    "the spectra are typical of a slowly evolving co - type nova and unambiguously reveal the detection of [ ] ( 12.81 @xmath1 m ) in this class of outburst , a highly uncommon event .",
    "the reddening toward v1186 sco , estimated using the intrinsic ( b - v ) colors and theoretical hydrogen and line ratios , converged at e(b - v ) = 0.45@xmath130.1 .",
    "the well sampled v band light curve displayed a slow decline but with many secondary peaks that call into question many of the properties derived via t@xmath48 and t@xmath49 times such as the absolute brightness at maximum .",
    "the distance derived from the mmrd relationship put v1186 sco on the other side of the galactic center indicating that the mmrd accuracy is suspect for slow novae with irregular light curves .",
    "photoionization modeling of the data indicates a relatively low mass ejection event consisting of material enhanced in helium , nitrogen , oxygen and some neon .",
    "however , the sulfur , argon and iron abundances must be substantially subsolar to explain their lack of prominent lines in the observed spectra .",
    "the enhanced oxygen and nitrogen , the erratic light curve , and the low velocity expansion velocities are all consistent with the presence of a co white dwarf in the system .",
    "the amount of neon enhancement ( 1.3@xmath130.6 ne / ne@xmath3 ) is not nearly as high as expected from an outburst on a onemg wd . rather the neon is likely intrinsic to the wd and mixed with the accreted material during the thermonuclear runaway .",
    "the distance derived from the best fit photoionization model provides a more consistent distance of 5.5@xmath130.5 kpc and a very faint m@xmath26 of -5.5@xmath130.5 mags .",
