    "this two - step process is generally accepted for small assemblies , but it is not clear whether , in large clusters , the external shell may also exhibit orientational melting @xcite or not @xcite .",
    "several factors are likely to influence the stability of 2d coulomb clusters .",
    "first , rotational barriers are strongly dependent on the structure , which in turn depends on the size .",
    "more stable structures are obtained when the core is based on a triangular lattice , thus resembling most observed wigner crystals .",
    "more importantly , the very different nature of orientational and radial melting has led to some confusion about how suitable observables should be defined to probe these processes separately @xcite . in their study of binary 2d clusters ,",

    "@xcite chose an order parameter based on the polar angles of the particles in order to quantify the extent of orientational motion in langevin molecular dynamics simulations .",

    ", we expect them to be sensitive to orientational melting .    in this paper",
    ", we revisit the dynamics and thermodynamics of 2d coulomb clusters by focusing on dynamical measures such as @xmath3 or the diffusion coefficient , @xmath4 , and by performing extensive monte carlo simulations employing the parallel tempering strategy @xcite .",
    "we also consider the interplay between the dynamics and the energy landscape of these clusters by constructing disconnectivity graphs @xcite .",
    "finally , we investigate how the thermodynamic behaviour evolves with size .",
    "this article is organised as follows .",
    "after briefly presenting our methods , we choose some specific examples to illustrate the difficulties associated with an unambiguous definition of the melting point in these clusters , and we then discuss the large size variations .",
    "we finally summarise and conclude in section iv .",
    "2d wigner clusters are characterised by the following classical potential energy : @xmath5 in this equation , @xmath6 or 2 are the charges carried by the particles , @xmath7 is the distance between particles @xmath8 and @xmath9 , and @xmath10 is the distance from particle @xmath8 to the cluster centre - of - mass .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 will usually be @xmath12 ( coulomb case ) , but we also specifically studied the case @xmath13 ( dipolar interaction ) for which some results will be selected below .",
    "the range of the electrostatic potential , @xmath14 , was set to 0 ( pure coulomb ) or to a finite value ( shielded coulomb ) . finally , and for comparison with the work reported in ref .   on binary clusters ,",
    "we have taken @xmath15 .",
    "it should be noted that , in the absence of the exponential term , the physics of the system is independent of @xmath16 : under the transformation @xmath17 , the energy can be cast in a form that does not depend on @xmath16 . in the following presentation ,",
    "unit masses and charges are used and all properties are explicitly given in dimensionless reduced units .",
    "the global minima of the clusters were investigated using the monte carlo plus minimization algorithm , also known as basin - hopping @xcite .",
    "the 2d clusters can generally be described as multishell systems , and we will use the @xmath18 notation for a homogeneous cluster having @xmath19 particles in its @xmath20 shell .",
    "binary clusters will be referred to as @xmath21 , where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the respective numbers of singly- and doubly - charged particles . due to the relatively long range of the potential @xcite ,",
    "global optimisation is relatively straightforward for coulomb systems .    beyond the stable isomers",
    ", we also investigated higher - index stationary points on the energy landscape . locating the saddle points with hessian index one",
    "enabled us to construct disconnectivity graphs @xcite , in order to relate the observed dynamical and thermodynamical behaviour to the potential energy surface for these clusters .",
    "we refer the reader to ref .   for further details of how stationary points are located and disconnectivity graphs are generated .",
    "the dynamics has also been studied by solving hamilton s equations of motion at constant energy .",
    "the coupled equations were integrated by the 4-step runge - kutta method , which keeps the energy constant to at least seven digits .",
    "for the first trajectory , the initial positions of the particles were obtained from the global minimum structure and a random set of momenta were chosen .",
    "the momenta were then scaled to set the linear and angular momentum to zero and the vibrational temperature to around @xmath24 .",
    "the time step was taken to be 0.0025 .",
    "the first @xmath25 steps were used to equilibrate the system and discarded , then @xmath26 steps were used for each simulation .",
    "further trajectories start with the configuration obtained from the previous run , with velocities scaled approximately to give a new temperature increased by a factor 1.25 .",
    "again , the equilibration steps were discarded .    for each trajectory the average kinetic temperature , root - mean - square ( rms ) bond length fluctuation index @xmath27 , the maximal lyapunov exponent , @xmath3 ,",
    "( mle ) and diffusion coefficient , @xmath4 , were calculated .",
    "@xmath27 is commonly used to detect melting in bulk or finite ( 3d ) atomic systems , as it is expected to jump from a low value to around 0.10.15 .",
    "both the diffusion coefficient and the lyapunov exponent were calculated from shorter parts of the entire trajectory .",
    "@xmath4 was obtained from the slope of the mean square atomic displacement .",
    "this measure describes the breathing and inter - shell exchanges ( isomerizations ) , but does not identify even qualitative changes in the rotational structure . for homogeneous systems",
    "it is very difficult to define measures of the angular motion .",
    "since the total angular momentum is zero , one can only measure angular velocity and momenta for separate shells ; however , the shell definitions lose their significance once isomerizations start taking place . in addition , the angular properties become ill - defined for clusters having a central particle .",
    "the calculation of the mle was motivated by several studies indicating possible relations between phase changes and this dynamical indicator .",
    "the mle measures the sensitive dependence on initial conditions and is defined from the exponential separation of two trajectories that start infinitesimally close together in the phase space .",
    "a tangent space approach was used in the numerical calculations @xcite .",
    "however , we should mention that semi - analytical theories have also been proposed to quantify the mle from the statistical properties of the potential energy surface @xcite .",
    "the equilibrium thermodynamics of the 2d clusters was also studied by means of parallel tempering monte carlo ( mc ) simulations .",
    "parallel tempering is a particularly efficient method to accelerate convergence in systems whose natural dynamics is affected by broken ergodicity . most often such problems are related to multiple funnels @xcite or ` glassy ' energy landscapes .",
    "the mc simulations were performed in the canonical ensemble , with temperatures in the range @xmath28 .",
    "about 80 runs were carried out in this range , with the temperatures nearly equally spaced on a logarithmic scale . @xmath25",
    "mc cycles were used for equilibration , followed by @xmath26 mc cycles for the actual calculations .",
    "the mc calculations were principally used to compute the thermal properties , such as the heat capacity , @xmath29 .    in",
    "both mc and md simulations the relation between the energy and the temperature is quasi linear .",
    "the snapshots obtained from experiments on colloidal particles @xcite or dust plasmas @xcite , as well as the various molecular dynamics ( md ) simulations , exhibit three types of characteristic motion . at low energy or temperature , or for dust plasmas under high pressures ,",
    "only small amplitude motion is observed , in which the particles oscillate around their mean positions . as the energy increases",
    ", these oscillations gain enough momentum to achieve complete rotations in their respective shells .",
    "the directions of these rotations are random , and they may change in time . however , in order to preserve the total angular momentum , different shells must rotate in opposite directions . eventually , actual isomerizations between shells may take place , as previously examined in 3d systems @xcite . in one case",
    ", it has also been reported that isomerizations may occur before the full rotational motion is achieved @xcite .",
    "we expect this observation to be due to rather infrequent sampling of the experimental trajectories @xcite .",
    "it is clear that the angular and the radial motion of particles make different contributions to all the measures aforementioned .    in order to study the mechanism of phase transitions in 2d clusters , we have carried out simulations of homogeneous clusters systems in the size range @xmath30 .",
    "we selected several sizes displaying different but typical characteristics . in fig .",
    "[ fig : homogeneous ] , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath27 and @xmath29 are plotted with respect to the average temperature for sizes 17 , 21 , 22 and 30 .",
    "the global minima for these clusters are found to be ( 1,6,10 ) , ( 1,7,13 ) , ( 2,8,12 ) and ( 5,10,15 ) , respectively , in agreement with ref .  .",
    "the mle starts becoming nonzero at very low temperatures , around @xmath31 . in this regime ,",
    "the dynamics are more irregular for @xmath32 and 21 .",
    "similarly , the lindemann index and the diffusion coefficients are also higher for @xmath32 and 21 in the low @xmath33 regime .",
    "both these clusters exhibit an intermediate phase over a broad temperature range ( note the logarithmic temperature scale ) . on the other hand ,",
    "the 30-particle cluster exhibits a single phase transition .",
    "while the three dynamical indicators agree with one another , the heat capacities provide rather little information in comparison .",
    "the general behaviour observed for all sizes is that of harmonic oscillators at very low temperatures @xmath34 or for free , independent particles at high temperatures",
    "( @xmath35 again due to confinement ) . in the intermediate temperature range",
    ", a strong decrease is seen near @xmath36 for all sizes , following an order - disorder peak below @xmath37 .",
    "the curves for a specific cluster are built on the basis of this generic behaviour , which reminds us of the caloric curves computed for lennard - jones polymers @xcite .",
    "for some sizes , such as @xmath38 or 30 , extra bumps or shoulders occur as a consequence of isomerizations . in general",
    ", the strong increase of @xmath3 , @xmath4 or @xmath27 at @xmath39 correlates with a peak in the specific heat .",
    "however , the phenomena responsible for the peculiar dynamical features for the 17- and 21-particle clusters do not have any thermal signature .",
    "the premelting heat capacity peak seen for @xmath38 at @xmath40 does not have any counterpart in the dynamical indices either .",
    "these data can be interpreted using the disconnectivity graphs shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : trees ] . in this figure , saddles connecting two permutations of the same isomers have been included to account for the rotational barriers .",
    "such saddles are manifested by the presence of copies of the corresponding minima on the graph .",
    "the energy barriers , which link the global minimum to itself through an internal rotation , are much lower for @xmath32 ( @xmath41 ) and @xmath38 ( @xmath42 , this is nearly a case of free rotation ) than for larger clusters , where they are closer to @xmath43 .",
    "such degenerate rearrangements @xcite do not play a major role in thermal equilibrium , but can have important dynamical consequences .",
    "this is precisely what we observe in fig .",
    "[ fig : homogeneous ] .",
    "the barriers for rearrangements are much higher in energy than those involved in the rotational motion , but in some cases other stable isomers lie relatively close to the global minimum . for @xmath38 and @xmath44 ,",
    "such isomerizations are indeed seen and correlate with bumps in the canonical heat capacity .",
    "> from the previous results it is clear that one can not draw general conclusions by looking at dynamical indicators alone , or at observables aimed at characterising thermal equilibrium .",
    "we have also looked at two specific cluster sizes , for which the results of the pure coulomb case have been compared to other interaction forms .",
    "the 31-particle cluster was studied with both @xmath45 and @xmath0 interactions , the latter expression being more relevant to colloidal particles , such as the ones involved in the experimental setup of ref .  .",
    "the 42-particle cluster has recently been the focus of an experimental report on dust plasmas @xcite . in this situation ,",
    "a screened coulomb or yukawa form @xmath1 is more appropriate than the bare coulomb law .",
    "here we chose @xmath46 , but the results presented hereafter in fig .",
    "[ fig:3142 ] are not significantly different for other values in the range @xmath47 .",
    "we first discuss the 31-particle clusters , which display different behaviour depending on the form of the interaction .",
    "while the coulomb potential leads to a ( 5,11,15 ) 3-shell global minimum , the shorter range dipolar interaction favours a ( 1,5,10,15 ) ground state . because this structure has a central particle , the vibrational motion is more constrained , and the harmonic entropy of ( 5,11,15 ) is actually larger .",
    "this competition between energy and entropy leads to a structural transition , which is seen in the heat capacity of fig .",
    "[ fig:3142](a ) as a significant peak near @xmath48 , while the melting peak is located at @xmath49 .",
    "the coulomb cluster behaves very differently , with a single @xmath29 peak at @xmath48 .",
    "scrutiny of the lindemann index indicates that this cluster undergoes free internal rotation at very low temperatures @xmath50 , before fully melting at @xmath48 . in the case of the dipolar interaction , only a single , but very sharp , increase is seen , at temperatures even higher than the melting peak , @xmath51 . this surprising result has been checked and confirmed by extensive sampling .",
    "after regular quenching of the md trajectories in this temperature range , we found that the sharp increase of @xmath27 was correlated with a sudden isomerization to the ( 5,11,15 ) second - lowest minimum , which is also involved in the preliminary structural transition .",
    "the lowest energy transition state from the global minimum was found to be significantly higher than the energy of the second isomer .",
    "in such a situation , md simulations suffer from broken ergodicity , since they can not sample the available phase space until sufficient energy is added . in cluster",
    "physics , a well - studied example of broken ergodicity is provided by the 38-atom lennard - jones cluster @xcite .",
    "the present sharp jump of the lindemann index should not be interpreted as the onset of melting , but rather as a signature of isomerization .",
    "42-particle clusters were investigated with the aim of finding some thermodynamic confirmation that melting proceeds in multiple steps .",
    "unfortunately , neither the specific heats of fig .",
    "[ fig:3142](b ) nor the lindemann indices of fig .",
    "[ fig:3142](d ) show any multiple - stage behaviour that could be related to the experimental observation @xcite .",
    "we thus conclude that the dust plasma system studied by melzer and coworkers can not be simply modelled as if it were made of a single layer .",
    "comparing the general curves for the coulomb , dipolar and yukawa potentials also provides useful information about the factors influencing the melting point .",
    "yukawa systems exhibit a significant shift of their melting temperature toward lower @xmath33 . since the yukawa potential is an attenuated form of the pure coulomb form , this is the expected trend . at large distances ,",
    "the dipolar interaction is also much smaller than the coulomb interaction .",
    "however , the melting temperature of coulomb clusters is about one order of magnitude _ smaller _ than for the dipolar cluster .",
    "hence the long - range part of the potential plays opposite roles in the dipolar and yukawa forms .",
    "this result suggests that the location of the melting peak is mainly driven by the short - range repulsive part of the potential .",
    "we now turn to small , binary coulomb clusters , such as those recently investigated by drocco and coworkers @xcite .",
    "@xmath22 particles with charge 1 and @xmath23 particles with charge 2 are stabilised in a parabolic trap with @xmath15 .",
    "the structures again consist of concentric shells where the singly charged particles form the inner shells in order to minimize repulsion .",
    "used langevin md simulations for mixed clusters containing @xmath5234 singly charged and @xmath53 , 6 and 7 doubly charged particles , and they also determined the melting points .",
    "these authors concluded that the melting behaviour of these binary trapped particles strongly depends on whether the numbers of particles in the inner and outer shells are commensurate .",
    "they also found that the highest melting points were obtained for @xmath54 , where the corresponding structures all have a single particle at the centre .",
    "we have performed md simulations for these heterogeneous systems under similar conditions to those of the homogeneous clusters . in fig .",
    "[ fig : binary ] , @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath27 and the specific heat @xmath29 are plotted for \\{4,5 } , \\{5,5 } , \\{6,5 } and \\{7,5 } , selected as further typical examples , highlighting differences in the stability and dynamics .",
    "the onset of chaos occurs at temperatures close to those seen in the homogeneous systems .",
    "\\{6,5 } is the most stable cluster , in the sense that it has the highest melting point in ref .  , while \\{5,5 } is the most irregular .",
    "both the diffusion and lindemann indices show the same qualitative trends , namely that the melting points , as measured by the strong increase in @xmath27 , follow the order @xmath55 .    as for homogeneous clusters , the variation of the heat capacities",
    "does not exactly match the dynamical indices . here",
    "the generic shape again starts at a constant value at low temperature , which corresponds to harmonic behaviour .",
    "the high temperature gas phase is still characterised by the same constant value . in the intermediate temperature range , two main peaks are associated with the melting of successive subclusters made of singly charged , then doubly charged particles .",
    "nearly one order of magnitude separates the two associated melting temperatures .",
    "this interpretation was further confirmed by calculating the heat capacity of the ternary \\{7,6,6 } cluster made of 7 singly charged particles , 6 doubly and 6 triply charged particles . for this cluster ,",
    "three clear features are observed in @xmath29 , and only above @xmath36 do the triply charged particles mix with the rest of the cluster .    on top of this generic behaviour , a specific isomerization shoulder is seen for the heat capacity of the \\{7,5 } cluster in fig .",
    "[ fig : binary](d ) , at the same temperature @xmath56 where the three dynamical parameters increase significantly .",
    "again , the free rotation of some internal shells revealed by @xmath3 , @xmath4 and @xmath27 at low temperature has no thermal signature .",
    "the disconnectivity graphs for these clusters are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : treesb ] . as is particularly obvious from the graphs for \\{5,5 } and \\{6,5 } , commensurate",
    "structure between the singly- and doubly - charged shells is not the only factor needed to explain the complicated behaviour exhibited by these finite wigner crystals .",
    "the extremely low barriers for the \\{4,5 } and \\{5,5 } clusters permit facile rotation , which is correlated with the rapid increase of all dynamical indicators at low temperatures .",
    "the \\{6,5 } cluster is especially resistant to isomerization because an extra , central particle hinders the radial motion of the particles in the other shells . only for the \\{7,5 } cluster",
    "is the isomerization energy low enough to give rise to an extra peak in the heat capacity .",
    "this case , and the case of the single - isomer \\{6,5 } cluster , further show that the multiple - peak structure of the heat capacity is not a consequence of isomerizations . therefore the general , two - peak shape of the heat capacity is not related to isomerization , but is intrinsic to the potential itself and the presence of two types of particles organised in shells .",
    "the variation of the melting temperature with cluster size is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : tmeltb ] for the three \\{@xmath57,4 } , \\{@xmath57,5 } and \\{@xmath57,6 } binary series , with @xmath58 . here",
    "the melting temperature was defined according to the lindemann criterion , as the temperature where @xmath27 sharply increases above 0.1 .",
    "the variation of the computed melting point is qualitatively similar to that reported by drocco and coworkers @xcite . in particular , the high values for \\{4,4 } , \\{5,5 } , \\{6,5 } and \\{7,6 } are reproduced .",
    "however , our results quantitatively differ from those of drocco _ et al . _ by a factor of at least 10 . our data , obtained with exactly the same hamiltonian as in ref .  ,",
    "are in agreement with the computed melting points for the homogeneous clusters , which are comparable with previous results for the same systems @xcite .",
    "even though the present temperatures result from time averages in our md simulations , their range matches the canonical temperature of our mc runs .",
    "hence we believe that the data of fig .  [",
    "fig : tmeltb ] are reliable , and that the differences from the results obtained by drocco and coworkers are the consequence of an unreported alternative choice of @xmath16 in the hamiltonian used in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "lastly , we discuss the behaviour of larger clusters and how melting evolves toward bulk . in fig .",
    "[ fig : large](a ) we show the heat capacities calculated from mc simulations for the cluster sizes @xmath59 , 200 , and 500 .",
    "the general trend is that the main peak near @xmath60 becomes narrower and sharper , suggesting that melting is a first - order process rounded by finite size effects @xcite .",
    "however , the main heat capacity peak remains quite broad , so a more detailed study should probably be performed on even larger sizes , including a proper finite - size scaling analysis .",
    "in addition , extra features in the heat capacity are present at low temperatures , even for the largest 500-particle cluster .",
    "regular quenching confirms that these premelting effects are due to isomerizations involving different arrangements of the inner shells . at large sizes , even though the global shape of the cluster is roughly circular , the radial ordering into shells is replaced by a triangular close - packed lattice , possibly with several defects @xcite .",
    "rotation of the various shells then becomes hindered , and the dynamics is reduced to more usual consecutive isomerizations .",
    "[ fig : large](a ) supports the idea that a single , first - order phase transition should occur in the bulk limit , if it could be defined .",
    "since that there is no unified theory of 2d melting @xcite , we should probably be cautious in extrapolating the heat capacities computed from monte carlo simulations . if we choose the peak of the heat capacity as the signature of melting , the melting point thus defined shows very pronounced variations with the cluster radius @xmath61 , as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : large](b ) .    the data for all sizes in the range @xmath62 and for larger clusters @xmath63 70 , 80 , 90 , 100 , 120 , 140 , 160 , 180 , 200 , 250 , 300 , 350 , 400 , 450 , 500 ) are included in this graph .",
    "the strong size dependence for small systems is similar to that observed for the binary systems .",
    "however , in the range 50500 the variation of the melting point seems less drastic than in the smaller size range , even though numerous sizes are obviously missing from the reported data .",
    "the bulk limit for the melting point is obtained to be 0.039 .",
    "this observation should not obscure the possibility that even large sizes can exhibit a multiple stage melting .",
    "for example , significant premelting peaks have been reported in large atomic clusters @xcite .",
    "the results obtained for @xmath64 show a similar feature . even though some premelting peaks are present in the caloric curves of large clusters , a major peak seems to dominate above about 100 ions .",
    "this result may suggest that the transition between the finite size regime and bulk @xcite takes place near this size .",
    "in this work , we have investigated some dynamic and thermodynamic properties of finite 2d charged particles confined by a parabolic trap .",
    "our extensive data on homogeneous and heterogeneous clusters were obtained from md and mc simulations .",
    "these data were interpreted by visualising the energy landscape through disconnectivity graphs .",
    "previous experimental and numerical findings suggest that there are three types of motion for a particle : it can oscillate , rotate in a relatively regular orbit , or make jumps between shells , possibly causing isomerizations .",
    "these various phenomena were also observed in the present work , but we found evidence that additional ` premelting ' events due to structural transitions may also occur .",
    "the various stages of melting create ambiguities in defining the melting point , especially in small clusters .",
    "firstly , rotational motion is facile when very small energy barriers separate the global energy minimum from itself , as is apparent from the disconnectivity graphs for the 17- and 21-particle homogeneous clusters , or the \\{4,5 } binary cluster .",
    "internal rotation may give rise to significant jumps in the rms bond length fluctuation , sometimes above 0.1 .",
    "radial melting is then seen as yet another increase in @xmath27 or other dynamical indicators at higher energy .",
    "therefore , the lindemann criterion ( @xmath65 ) is not fully reliable for detecting melting .",
    "secondly , rotational melting has no thermodynamic consequence since only a single isomer is involved .",
    "the thermodynamics is sensitive to the presence of different isomers , and also to the intrinsic shape of the potential felt by the particles .",
    "irrespective of the isomers , the heat capacity has a natural drop over a rather broad temperature range , which marks the continuous transition toward the gas phase .",
    "hence , even a single cluster isomer can have heat capacities with complex temperature dependence , as exemplified by the small \\{4,5 } binary clusters .",
    "thirdly , several isomers can give rise to preliminary peaks in the heat capacity , which may sometimes obscure the features associated with full radial melting .",
    "we found such a case for the 31-particle cluster interacting through dipolar forces , but very large clusters can also exhibit particularly strong premelting peaks . the structural transition occurring in the 31-particle cluster",
    "has the same origins as the fcc - icosahedral transition in the 3d 38-atom lennard - jones cluster @xcite : the second morphology has a much larger entropy than the global minimum .",
    "this phenomenon has important consequences for the constant energy dynamical behaviour , as this transition is not seen until sufficient energy to surmount the isomerization barrier is present .",
    "thus there is a finite energy range where md simulations starting from the ground state structure are non - ergodic , which is reflected by a strong shift in the estimated melting temperature .",
    "most of our results illustrate how a simple and unique picture of melting is hampered by finite size effects .",
    "both the dynamical parameters and the thermodynamical curves contribute to explaining related but different aspects of melting in these 2d clusters .",
    "in particular , our work does not support a single parameter as a universal measure for the melting point that could be used unambiguously for all clusters .",
    "nevertheless , the landscape approach @xcite that has been followed here was found to provide useful insight for interpreting and understanding the various numerical data .",
    "the data gathered here for a broad range of sizes would seem to prevent a general classification on the phenomenology of melting to be made .",
    "for example , the choice of molecular dynamics or monte carlo method , and the microcanonical or canonical ensemble , can change the observed behavior significantly , particularly at small sizes where the differences between the two statistical ensembles are the largest .",
    "for instance , some structural transitions might not appear with conventional md methods , due to the disconnected character of phase space at low total energies .",
    "however , three main categories of behavior can be inferred from our results . especially in small clusters , a two - step orientational - then - radial melting has been observed , with clear dynamical signatures , but only a weak thermodynamical signature .",
    "clusters exhibiting structural transitions , on the other hand , may not involve any rotational melting but display a strong change in their caloric curve .",
    "finally , a more conventional single - step melting is sometimes seen , as expected in larger clusters , and also for smaller magic sizes .",
    "our calculations indicate that significant finite size effects remain in the thermodynamics of the largest clusters considered .",
    "however , above a few hundred ions , melting seems to be essentially a one - step process .",
    "this result is consistent with the expectation that the dynamics becomes more and more dominated by localised processes , due to the less favourable rotational motion .",
    "this observation seems to justify the use of the lindemann index or other dynamical parameters for larger systems .",
    "additionally , the main heat capacity peak becomes larger , and its maximum value coincides with the onset of disorder in the dynamical indicators .",
    "even though premelting features may remain noticeable , we expect the onset of radial melting to become closer and closer to orientational melting , and eventually similar to a bulk first - order melting process .",
    "we are grateful for a collaborative research grant given by cnrs and tubitak ."
