    "density functional theory has become a popular computational method in quantum chemistry , because of its ability to handle large molecules accurately but relatively inexpensively@xcite .",
    "this success is based on the availability of reliable accurate approximate functionals , and there is a constant need for still further accuracy . the goal of atomization energy errors being reliably less than 1 kcal / mol has not yet been achieved .",
    "an important step forward in this search for accuracy came when becke mixed a fraction of exact exchange with a generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) , and reduced errors by a factor of two or three@xcite .",
    "such hybrid functionals , e.g. , b3lyp , are now in common use , but their underlying justification comes from the adiabatic decomposition of density functional theory .",
    "initially , the mixing parameters used were determined empirically .",
    "later , it was shown that these parameters could be derived non - empirically@xcite , and that a single universal mixing coefficient ( 25% ) could be rationalized based on the performance of mp theory for molecules@xcite .",
    "most recently , new functionals have been proposed which use this adiabatic decomposition in much detail@xcite .",
    "the adiabatic decomposition of an electronic system is very simple conceptually .",
    "imagine multiplying the electron - electron repulsion by a coupling constant @xmath0 .",
    "now imagine varying @xmath0 , while keeping the electron density @xmath1 fixed .",
    "this differs from traditional perturbative methods , e.g. , mller - plesset @xcite , because the external potential must be altered at each @xmath0 to keep the density fixed . at @xmath2",
    ", we have the physical , interacting electronic system .",
    "but as @xmath0 is reduced to zero , keeping the density fixed , the electrons become those of the non - interacting , kohn - sham system , and the potential morphs into the kohn - sham potential .",
    "all kohn - sham dft calculations are actually performed on this non - interacting system , and the physical ground - state energy deduced from it .",
    "the adiabatic connection provides a continuous connection between the interacting system and its kohn - sham analog .",
    "the only part of the total energy which must be approximated in such a kohn - sham calculation is the exchange - correlation energy , @xmath3 $ ] , as a functional of the ( spin ) density .",
    "a further value of the coupling constant is that , through the hellmann - feynman theorem , this energy can be written as an intergal over the purely potential contribution@xcite : e= _ 0 ^ 1 d u ( ) ,   u()=|v|  - u , [ acm ] where @xmath4 is the coulomb interaction between electrons , @xmath5 is the wavefunction at coupling constant @xmath0 , and @xmath6 is the hartree electrostatic energy .",
    "this integral is the adiabatic connection formula .",
    "hybrid functionals are based on the fact that this integrand , when applied to the exchange - correlation contribution to a bond dissociation energy , is often _ not _ well - approximated by gga s , due to their lack of static correlation@xcite .",
    "this can be partially corrected for most molecules by mixing in a fraction of exact exchange .",

    "however , this is , in principle , a very demanding task . for each value of @xmath0",
    ", one must solve the interacting electronic problem many times in order to find the external potential which reproduces the @xmath2 density .",

    "joubert and srivastava@xcite have used hylleras - type wavefunctions to calculate these curves for the he isoelectronic series .",
    "all these methods require solving the interacting electronic problem with a potential that differs from the original external potential , e.g. , @xmath7 for atoms .",
    "this typically makes them difficult to transfer to other systems , radically different from the original one , in which other codes and approximations are being used . in this paper",
    ", we show how to construct the adiabatic connection formula for any atom accurately by doing calculations simply for different values of @xmath8 , so that no modification need be made to an existing wavefunction code . a standard calculation is simply run for several different nuclear charges , running from the physical value up to @xmath9 .",
    "the main focus of this paper is to demonstrate the accuracy of the method .",
    "the solid line in figure 1 is an essentially exact curve for @xmath10 for hooke s atom ( two electrons in a harmonic potential ) , for a spring constant of @xmath11 ( atomic units ) , calculated from a series of exact calculations for force constants greater than 1/4 , but never requiring any calculation with a different external potential .",
    "the method can be immediately applied to accurate calculations for larger atoms , and is currently being explored for molecules .",
    "the paper is divided into several sections . in the next section",
    ", we outline the basic theory behind our calculations . following that",
    ", we present results , both using the exact functional , and within a gga , for both hooke s atom and the he atom .",
    "hooke s atom consists of two electrons attached by springs to a center , but interacting via a coulomb repulsion .",
    "we summarize our findings in the last section .",
    "atomic units ( @xmath12 ) are used throughout , and only spin - unpolarized systems are discussed .",
    "for convenience , we begin with a review of the adiabatic connection formalism . we define @xmath13 $ ] to be that wavefunction which has density @xmath1 and minimizes f [ ] = | t + | .",
    "[ fl ] then the kinetic - correlation energy at @xmath0 is t= | t |  - t[tlc ] where @xmath14 $ ] is the non - interacting kohn - sham kinetic energy of density @xmath15 .",

[ excl ] for @xmath2 , the system becomes the true interacting quantum - mechanical system , and energies without superscripts refer to @xmath2 , e.g. , @xmath16 .",
    "all quantities at coupling constants different from one are simply related to their full coupling strength counterparts , but evaluated on a scaled density@xcite .",
    "the most important examples are the wavefunction :  [ ] = _ , [ psil ] and the exchange - correlation energy e [ ] = ^2 e , [ excscal ] [ fund ] where @xmath17 , and @xmath18 @xmath19 . thus knowledge of how a quantity varies as the density is scaled implies knowledge of its coupling constant dependence .",
    "quantities evaluated on the kohn - sham wavefunction vary in a simple way , such as the non - interacting kinetic energy @xmath20 : t [ ] = t ,  or  t= ^2 t , [ tsscal ] the hartree electrostatic energy , u[]=u [ ] ,  or  u[]= u [ ] , [ uscal ] and the exchange energy e [ ] = e ,  or  e = e .",

    "[ ecfromucg ] combining eqs .",

    "we emphasize that all these relations follow from the well - known eqs .",
    "( [ fund ] ) and ( [ tcfromec ] ) .",
    "we begin this section by noting how , when some parameter in an external potential is altered , the density changes scale , but often does not change shape very much . for example , for the two - electron ion , going from z=2 to z=4 will roughly multiply the density by 8 , and reduce its length scale by a factor of 2 .",
    "we use this fact to very accurately approximate scaling the density .",
    "then , through the relations derived above , we can convert this into the coupling - constant dependence .",
    "let @xmath1 be the density of the system we are interested in .",
    "suppose we alter some parameter in the external potential , and solve the interacting problem , finding some density @xmath34 .",

    "[ ldef ] we can then consider @xmath36 \\approx e\\c[\\n\\g]$ ] , @xmath37 \\approx t\\c[\\n\\g]$ ] , etc . , which we call the bare estimates .",
    "as we shall show in the results section , these energies usually yield quite accurate approximations to the exact quantities . however , since we are not working with the true scaled density , these energies do not satisfy the relations involving scaling derivatives above , such as eq .",
    "( [ ecfromtcg ] ) .    to make a better estimate",
    ", we note that , in the case of the correlation energy , we can calculate the leading correction to @xmath27 $ ] , using the correlation potential .",
