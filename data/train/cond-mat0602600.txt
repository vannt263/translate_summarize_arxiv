    "by regarding a hard - sphere gas as an ideal gas confined in a container with a multi - core boundary , i.e. , a container filled with small excluded spheres ( fig .",
    "1 ) , we calculate the grand potential for two- and three - dimensional interacting gases using the method developed for calculating the boundary effect on an ideal gas . the value of studying hard - sphere gases is : ( 1 ) often a complete knowledge of the detailed interaction potential is not necessary for a satisfactory description of the system , because a particle that is spread out in space sees only an averaged effect of the potential @xcite . (",
    "2 ) experimental progress has been made in recent years in bose - einstein condensation in dilute atomic gases @xcite ; the hard - sphere interaction model is often used as an efficient tool for studying bose - einstein condensation , both for dilute atomic gases and liquid helium @xcite , after lee and yang studied pioneered the study of interacting bosons @xcite . ( 3 ) the hard - sphere gas , as a simplified model , is of great value for investigating the more general theory of interacting gases and can be extended to some more general cases . as a valuable idealized model ,",
    "the hard - sphere gas has been studied by various theories , such as the method of pseudopotentials @xcite , cluster expansions @xcite , and second quantization @xcite .",
    "the hard - sphere gas is a simplified model of the interacting gas , which replaces the interparticle interaction by the boundary condition the wavefunction @xmath1 on the boundary ; such a boundary in the 3n - dimensional configuration space is equivalent to a tree - like hypersurface @xcite . in a quantum hard - sphere gas , there are two interplayed effects : the effect of the statistics and the effect of the hard - sphere interaction .",
    "the interplay of the effects of statistics and the interparticle interaction often causes difficulties , e.g. , it makes the quantum cluster expansion considerably involved @xcite : to find the @xmath2-th virial coefficient for @xmath3 , one has to solve a quantum many - body problem .",
    "there are various approaches to hard - sphere gases .",
    "the scheme proposed by lee and yang , the binary collision method , is to separate out the effect of the statistics @xcite ; it allows one first takes care of the statistical aspect of the problem and then tackles the dynamical aspect of it @xcite , and the @xmath2-th virial coefficient can be obtained by solving two - body problems . in the method of pseudopotentials the boundary condition is approximately replaced by a non - hermitian pseudopotential @xcite , i.e. , the boundary condition is converted to a `` potential '' approximately .    in this paper , by replacing a hard - sphere gas by an ideal quantum gas with a multi - core boundary ( fig .",
    "1 ) , and using the method developed for calculating the boundary effects , we converted the problem of a quantum hard - sphere gas ( fig .",
    "1a ) into a problem of an ideal quantum gas confined in a container filled with small excluded spheres ( cores ) randomly distributed ( fig .",
    "1b ) . in this approach , roughly speaking , the exchange effect and the effect of classical interaction ( in this case",
    ", the hard - sphere interaction ) are treated separately : the exchange effect on the imperfect gas is embodied in the exchange effect on the ideal gas ; the effect of hard - sphere interaction is embodied in the boundary effect . the number of the cores is chosen to equal the total number of particles ; the radius of the cores is chosen to equal the diameter of the hard sphere @xmath4 ( the scattering length of the hard sphere ) since the area of a core felt by a gas molecule during the scattering process is @xmath5 .",
    "1 . regarding a hard - sphere gas as an ideal quantum gas in a multi - core container . ( a ) a hard - sphere gas in which the diameter of the gas molecule is @xmath4 .",
    "( b ) an ideal quantum gas confined in a container with a multi - core boundary .",
    "the diameter of the core is @xmath6 .",
    "then , the task that to calculate an interacting gas is converted to a task that to calculate the boundary effect on an ideal quantum gas . in preceding papers we developed some methods for calculating boundary effects @xcite :",
    "one @xcite , which is based on the mathematical work given by kac @xcite , is for two - dimensional cases ; the other @xcite is for three - dimensional cases .",
    "however , to apply these methods to the present problem , in which the boundary is more complex , we need to extend them to more general cases @xcite : the grand potentials for ideal quantum gases in three- and two- dimensional confined space can be expressed as @xmath7 where @xmath8 denotes the dimension ; @xmath9 is the thermal wavelength , @xmath10 the number of internal degrees of freedom and for spins @xmath11 , and the function @xmath12 equals the  bose - einstein integral @xmath13 or the fermi - dirac integral @xmath14 in boson or fermion case respectively .",
    "@xmath15 and @xmath16 are the _ valuations _ of the containers @xcite ( @xmath15 for outer boundaries and @xmath16 for inner boundaries ) : in three dimensions for a sphere @xmath17 is the volume , @xmath18 half the surface area , and @xmath19 twice the diameter ; in two dimensions , for a disk @xmath20 is the area , and @xmath19 half the perimeter . however , this result is only valid for spinless distinguishable particles .",
    "to take the effects of spin and indistinguishability into account , we need to improve this result one step further .",
    "the hard - sphere interaction is embodied in the boundary terms ; the cross - section for collisions between gas molecules is regarded as the surface area of the boundary cores . for distinguishable hard - sphere particles ,",
    "the cross - section is @xmath5 ; however , for indistinguishable ones , the cross - section is @xmath21 , i.e. , the contribution from the indistinguishable hard - sphere interaction is twice the contribution from distinguishable ones .",
    "moreover , for the case of particles with spin @xmath0 , if we include only the @xmath22-wave contribution , there are weights @xmath23 for bosons and @xmath24 for fermions respectively for the unpolarized scattering of identical particles @xcite .",
    "thus the grand potential of an ideal quantum gas confined in the container illustrated in fig .",
    "1b can be written in the following form : @xmath25   , \\label{1}%\\ ] ] where @xmath26 for bosons and @xmath27 for fermions , @xmath4 is the diameter of the hard sphere and @xmath28 is the total number of particles in the system .",
    "note that the boundary , of course , includes all cores .",
    "strictly speaking , see fig .",
    "1 , the volume of the system is the volume of the cubical container @xmath29 minus the total volume of all cores ; however , in view of the fact that for a dilute system the former is much larger than the latter and the contribution from the volume of the cores is only of the order @xmath30 , we approximately use @xmath29 as the volume of the system . in the second term the factor @xmath31 is half the total surface area of all cores  the second valuation , which is much larger than the magnitude of @xmath32 in a macroscopic system ; in the third term the factor @xmath33 is twice the diameter of a core so @xmath34 is the third valuation of the boundary ( notice that @xmath35 ) . the factors @xmath36 and",
