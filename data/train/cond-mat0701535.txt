    "quantum hall systems continue to provide remarkable laboratories for studying the rich dynamics which is possible for strongly - correlated electron systems in two spatial dimensions .",
    "the now - classic studies of the many hall plateaux found within systems for which only the first landau level is occupied @xcite , were later supplemented by the discovery of new and remarkable phenomena in systems involving higher landau levels @xcite , and the discovery of evidence for new superfluid phases in bilayer systems , involving two or more quantum hall layers which are spaced sufficiently closely to allow inter - layer coherence and correlations @xcite .    although the microscopic picture of the electron physics in these systems is well understood in terms of the laughlin wave - function @xcite  at least for those systems for which only the first landau level is occupied  it is also useful to have a purely long - wavelength description of the effective degrees of freedom which are relevant ( in the renormalization - group  rg  sense ) for the low - energy transport measurements . as is well - known from the study of superconductors ( for which the bcs theory can be understood as the relevant effective description for energies near the superconducting gap @xcite ) , such a long - distance description complements the microscopic picture by identifying the domain of validity of the low - energy predictions and so thereby allowing a better understanding of the robustness of various low - energy phenomena .    for homogeneous quantum hall systems",
    "the large number of available ground states ( compared , for example to a bcs superconductor ) complicates the low - energy description of the theory , and the detailed form of the effective theory applicable at mk temperatures is not yet fully understood .",
    "it has been suggested by a number of authors@xcite that there is a large discrete group , @xmath0 , that maps between these ground states  using complex conductivities , @xmath1 , the map is @xmath2 where @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 are integers constrained by @xmath7 and @xmath5 is even .",
    "this symmetry commutes with the scaling flow in a sense that will be explained below .",
    "indeed , much of the data concerning the transitions between plateaux follows very robustly simply from the existence of this symmetry @xcite .",
    "( we call this a ` symmetry ' even though it relates distinct phases of the system , rather than commuting with the hamiltonian describing low - energy fluctuations within any one phase .",
    "we use this name because the group _ is _ a symmetry of the scaling flow . ) on the theoretical side this symmetry was first proposed on both phenomenological @xcite and then on more microscopic grounds @xcite , before being derived as a consequence of particle - vortex duality for the relevant charge carriers @xcite and then on very general grounds for two - dimensional conformal field theories @xcite .",
    "the increasing generality of the assumptions which enter into these derivations helps to explain the surprisingly broad domain of validity of the observations , which apply well beyond the immediate vicinity of the critical points to which they were originally expected to be restricted .",
    "indeed the more recent derivations show these symmetries even go beyond the domain of linear response @xcite , in agreement with observations @xcite .",
    "as yet , there has not been an exhaustive study of the implications of this emergent discrete symmetry for the physics of spin - degenerate landau levels @xcite or of bilayer systems .",
    "it is the purpose of this paper to do so , and we find that the symmetry has a number of observational implications , including the following .",
    "@xmath8 _ the symmetry : _ in the single - layer case there are two classes of emergent symmetry , depending on whether or not the charge carriers are related by symmetry transformations to bosons or to fermions @xcite . the corresponding symmetry for the bilayer system is determined by which of these symmetries applies to the individual layers in the limit where they are independent .",
    "given that all known spin - split monolayer qhe systems appear to be described by the fermionic symmetry , @xmath0 , we concentrate for the most part in this paper on the generalization of the purely fermionic symmetry . by combining the symmetries of each separate layer with the symmetry of layer interchange",
    "we are led to a particular discrete subgroup @xmath9 .",
    "a similar analysis of the group which is appropriate to systems built from ` bosonic ' layers is straightforward , and is also presented in the event that such layers should be experimentally realized .",
    "@xmath8 _ low - temperature fixed points : _ since the symmetry commutes with the flow , it makes universal predictions for the kinds of fixed points which are possible at low temperatures . unlike the monolayer case , there can not be a one - to - one relation between the experimental variables  temperature , @xmath10 , magnetic field , @xmath11 , inter - layer separation , @xmath6 , and charge carrier density , @xmath12  and the six conductivities which are possible for composite systems built from bilayers ( in principle there could be a one - to - one correspondence for identical bilayers , with only four independent conductivities , but we are not aware of any experimental data that systematically explores the full parameter range )",
    ". not all phases can be explored for a given bilayer sample as @xmath10 , @xmath11 and @xmath6 are varied , and a consequence of this observation is that the possible attractive fixed points which are allowed by the symmetries can depend on other microscopic factors , such as the relative importance of tunnelling and inter - layer or intra - layer coulomb energies .",
    "we identify three classes of flow which are consistent with the bilayer symmetry , and identify the universal low - energy fixed points which each predicts .",
    "these include all of the known phases which have been observed for these systems , with one describing widely - separated mono - layers , and the other two corresponding to correlated bilayers in two situations distinguished by the relative size of the tunnelling and inter - layer coulomb energies .",
    "@xmath8 _ semicircles : _ in the single - layer case , when particle - hole symmetry is present , knowledge of the temperature flow implied the system moved on semi - circular trajectories within the conductivity plane when magnetic fields are varied at low temperatures .",
    "this conclusion has generalizations to the three categories of flows described above .",
    "in particular , for samples exhibiting particle - hole symmetry , semicircular transitions are again predicted for specific combinations of conductivities in the cases of widely - separated layers and for bilayers with large tunnelling energies .",
    "@xmath8 _ selection rules : _ we show how the experimentally - successful selection rule , @xmath13 , for monolayer transitions between plateaux characterized by hall conductivities @xmath14 and @xmath15 ( in units of @xmath16 ) , generalizes to bilayer systems . for bilayers precisely the same selection rule holds ( for particular combinations of conductivities ) for all three categories of flow mentioned above .",
    "@xmath8 _ unresolved layers : _ it is often the case that the separate conductivities are not measured independently for bilayer systems , and we show in this case how the above predictions reduce to the case where only the total conductivity is measured .",
    "this allows the predictions of the symmetry to be applied more directly to single - layer systems for which it is the electron spins ( or other labels ) which distinguish the two layers. the predictions in this case include the existence of even - denominator states and the selection rule becomes @xmath17 , where @xmath18 or 2 , depending on which of the three categories of flow is under consideration . for systems with particle - hole symmetry there should be semicircular transitions between these states .",
    "in this section we briefly describe the properties of the emergent symmetry in the bosonic and fermionic cases , starting first with a restatement of what is known for a single conducting fluid ( as appropriate to a spin - split landau level in a monolayer sample ) and then generalizing to the case of two fluids ( as would apply to a spin - degenerate layer or a bilayer consisting of two spin - split quantum hall systems ) .",
    "it is the case of a spin - split single landau level which has been longest studied , and we follow here the description of ref .",
    "@xcite . in this reference",
    "it is argued that there are two operations which commute with the scaling flow in the low - energy limit of any system in two spatial dimensions for which the quasi - particle charge carriers relevant to transport measurements are weakly - coupled particles or vortices .",
    "these two generators do not commute with one another and their repeated application generates a large discrete group which resides within @xmath19 .    in two dimensions particle statistics",
    "is described by an angle , @xmath20 , which represents the phase , @xmath21 , which the particles acquire if they are adiabatically moved around one another .",
    "the first of the symmetry operations which must commute with the flow is simply the addition of @xmath22 statistics flux to the relevant charge - carrying quasi - particles , since this does not change at all the accumulated phase .",
    "the second symmetry generator arises when the quasi - particles relevant for transport in some of the system s phases are weakly - coupled vortices rather than charges . in this case",
    "the similar kinematics of charges and vortices in 2 dimensions implies the flow commutes with the operation of particle - vortex interchange .    ref .",
    "@xcite shows that these two operations have a very simple action on the electromagnetic response of the 2d system , which for conductors and semi - conductors acts on the complex conductivities @xmath23 as a fractional linear transformation : @xmath24 where the integers @xmath3 , @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 satisfy @xmath25 .",
    "because this is invariant under a change of sign for the constants @xmath3 through @xmath6 , this defines the group @xmath26 .",
    "it is convenient to express the transformations of this type in terms of two standard ones : @xmath27 which satisfy the identity @xmath28 .",
    "for instance , the implications for the conductivities of the addition of @xmath22 statistics flux to the charge carriers can be written in terms of these generators as the combination @xmath29 , or @xmath30 , with @xmath31 this transformation was first derived by jain and collaborators @xcite , although only in the context of @xmath32 and not on the full uper - half complex plane .",
    "the modular group has fixed points , in the sense that there are a special set of points @xmath33 for which there exists an element @xmath34 of the modular group that leaves @xmath33 invariant , @xmath35 .",
    "quantum hall plateaux are examples of such fixed points lying on the real axis , @xmath36 , with @xmath37 a rational number ( the requirement that @xmath38 be odd for semiconductors restricts the modular group to a subgroup as described in section ii.a.2 below ) .",
    "it is the specific values taken by the integers @xmath3 through @xmath6 for the particle - vortex interchange which differs in the bosonic and fermionic cases , so we consider each of these cases separately after first discussing the implications of this symmetry for the scaling flow .",
    "the requirement that the scaling flow of the quantum hall effect commute with this infinite discrete group@xcite strongly restricts the general form of the flow in quantum hall systems .",
    "the statement that the symmetry commutes with the flow means that the scaling function , the logarithmic derivative of the conductivity along a flow line @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the logarithm of the scale , is the same regardless of whether the modular group is applied before or after taking the derivative , _ i.e _ @xmath41 this proves to be a very strong restriction and has the consequence that fixed points of the modular symmetry must necessarily be fixed points of the scaling flow , _",
    "i.e. _ if @xmath33 is such that there exists an element @xmath42 which leaves @xmath33 invariant , @xmath35 , then @xmath33 is necessarily a fixed point of the scaling flow and @xmath43.@xcite    the original scaling arguments of khmelnitskii@xcite and pruisken@xcite were obtained from rg techniques , using an effective sample size l. in general the conductivity would be expected to be a function of a number of parameters , such as the magnetic field , the temperature , the charge carrier density , the impurity density and the size .",
    "if the charge carrier and impurity densities are fixed then we have @xmath44 , but simple scaling says that @xmath45 is dimensionless ( in units with @xmath46 ) so it only depends on two independent arguments and can be written as @xmath47 for some pair of exponents @xmath48 and @xmath49 , or alternatively as @xmath50 for a different pair @xmath51 and @xmath52 .",
    "one expects a different flow depending on whether the effective sample size @xmath53 is varied , @xmath54 , or the temperature @xmath10 is varied , @xmath55 . if @xmath11 is held fixed then @xmath56 and @xmath57 .",
    "anticipating the discussion of fermions and considering figure 1 below , where an example of the flow dictated by modular symmetry is shown , we note that the topology of the flow does not require full knowledge of the functional form of @xmath58 .",
    "if figure 1 is taken to represent @xmath59 one can multiply @xmath59 by any function of @xmath53 which is non - vanishing away from the critical points and the topology of the figure does not change . alternatively , if figure 1 represents @xmath60 one can multiply @xmath60 by any function of @xmath10 which is non - vanishing away from the critical points and the topology of the figure does not change .",
    "these two alternative views are quite compatible , indeed figure 1 could represent both @xmath59 and @xmath60 , if their ratio is a non - vanishing real function of @xmath10 and @xmath53 , and this is perhaps not unreasonable from a field theoretical point of view in @xmath61 dimensions .",
    "@xmath53 can be taken to be the size of the system , e.g. the spatial extent of the system at low @xmath10 , while in field theory @xmath62 would be the temporal extent of the system , so the distinction between the two functions is that of temporal versus spatial variations .",
    "indeed there is experimental evidence that @xmath63 with @xmath64.@xcite    the experiments of murzin et al@xcite are in remarkable agreement with figure 1 below and indicate that it is reasonable to consider the flows obtained from modular symmetry for semi - conductors as arising from @xmath60 . in the following",
    "we shall take the pragmatic attitude , given the experimental data , that the flows represent @xmath60 .",
    "if the charge carriers for one of the system s phases are fermions ( or related to fermions by a symmetry transformation ) , then the implications for the conductivities of interchanging a particle with a vortex is @xmath65 with @xmath66 the group generated by iterating this transition with that of eq .",
    "consists of all @xmath26 transformations for which @xmath5 is even , which defines the subgroup @xmath67 .",
    "this group is generated by the two generators @xmath10 and @xmath29 .    when supplemented with a symmetry interchanging particles and holes ( _ i.e. _ @xmath68 ) completely determines a particular class of semicircular flow lines @xcite .",
    "combining this with a boundary condition at high temperatures ( or vanishing magnetic field , _ etc . _ ) to fix the overall direction of flow leads to the desired observational consequences .",
    "for instance , assuming the flow direction at large @xmath69 ( or at @xmath70 ) corresponds to that of a semiconducting monolayer sample leads to the temperature flow shown in figure 1 ( which is a more detailed version of figure 1 in the first reference of  @xcite ) , where the arrows indicate the direction of decreasing temperature and different flow lines correspond to different values of @xmath11 .",
    "as the temperature is lowered the flow from above is forced onto semicircles of unit diameter spanning the integers on the real line and , at low enough temperatures , these semcircles are followed when @xmath11 is varied to force transitions between integer hall plateaux .",
    "this pattern is repeated in a self - similar pattern for transitions between rational fractions .",
    "there are completely attractive fixed points on the real line at rational fractions @xmath71 with @xmath38 odd ( these are images of @xmath72 under the group action ) and completely repulsive fixed points at even denominators , @xmath71 with @xmath38 even ( these are images of @xmath73 )",
    ". there are saddle points , attractive in one direction and repulsive in another , at @xmath74 and its images  these represent critical points on the transition between two hall plateaux as the magnetic field is varied .    in the mathematical limit of perfect modular symmetry",
    "there is a fractal structure just above the real line , but in any real sample there is obviously a maximum value for the denominator of the filling fraction  there can be no truly infinite fractals in nature  though purer samples with higher mobilities can achieve higher denominators .    among the consequences of this flow",
    "are the following universal properties    * the flow as temperatures go to zero is towards the attractive fixed points , the complete list of which is @xmath75 with @xmath38 odd .",
    "* the plateaux , @xmath76 and @xmath77 , which may be connected by a semicircle must satisfy the selection rule @xmath78 . *",
    "if particle - hole interchange is also a symmetry , in the sense of creating a hole when a particle is removed from a full landau level ( @xmath79 ) , then at low temperatures the flow between plateaux obtained as magnetic fields are varied traverses a semicircle in the complex conductivity plane , with the semicircle centered on the real axis @xcite .",
    "this includes also vertical lines , which may be regarded as infinitely large semicircles , leading to the curves shown in figure 1 .",
    "these describe very well the observed transitions which are seen in the spin - split single - layer quantum hall systems in semiconducting hetero - junctions .      on the other hand ,",
    "if the charge carriers for one of the system s phases should be bosons ( or related to them by a symmetry transformation ) , then the group generated by iterating particle - vortex interchange with @xmath22 statistics flux addition consists of all those @xmath26 transformations for which both @xmath4 and @xmath5 are even , or for which both are odd .",
    "this defines the subgroup @xmath80 , which is generated by the two generators @xmath81 and @xmath29 ( or equivalently @xmath81 and @xmath82 ) .",
    "this symmetry was first suggested in connection with the quantum hall effect in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the requirement that the flow commute with this group dictates its observational consequences @xcite .",
    "these include the last two consequences listed above for fermionic systems , but the first consequence is instead changed to    * the flow as temperatures go to zero is towards the attractive fixed points , the complete list of which is @xmath75 , where @xmath83 and @xmath38 are relatively prime and the product @xmath84 must be even .",
    "notice in this case that the selection rule m2 requires transitions to be between plateaux for which @xmath85 and those for which @xmath86 .    because the fixed points differ between the cases of bosons and fermions , the precise properties of the semicircles predicted in the bosonic and fermionic cases differ in detail .",
    "pictures of the allowed semicircles in both cases are given in ref .",
    "@xcite . unlike for the fermionic case ,",
    "experimental systems exhibiting these predictions were not known , although the recent observations of quantum hall phenomena in graphene may provide the first example.@xcite      for quantum hall bilayers there are more conductivities which are accessible to observations , since there are ohmic and hall conductivities for each layer separately , @xmath87 and @xmath88 , as well as the inter - layer conductivities , @xmath89 . here the labels ` 1 ' and ` 2 ' distinguish the two layers , and each of the @xmath90 are complex numbers , whose real part gives the corresponding hall conductivity and whose imaginary part gives the ohmic conductivity .",
    "our interest is to generalize the discrete symmetry of the single - layer case to the bilayer context , and it is convenient for this purpose to group these complex conductivities into a complex matrix @xmath91 in this case we know that the flow must commute with the action of the discrete symmetry when it is applied to each layer separately .",
    "if the layers are identical we may also demand that the flow commute with the symmetry corresponding to the interchange of the two layers .",
    "this leads us to expect there to be a total of 5 independent symmetry generators in the bilayer case .    in terms of the matrix @xmath92",
    "these transformations form a subgroup of the discrete group @xmath93 where the @xmath94 matrices @xmath95 , @xmath11 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 have integer entries . denoting the transpose by the superscript ` @xmath98 '",
    ", these matrices must satisfy the conditions @xmath99 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 . the four matrices @xmath102 and @xmath97 , with this constraint , represent an element @xmath103 of the group @xmath104 .",
    "a mathematical property of this transformation that is important for the physics of the quantum hall effect in bilayers is that , when the imaginary part of @xmath92 is positive ( _ i.e. _ its eigenvalues are positive ) then ( [ sp4z ] ) preserves this property .",
    "since the precise subgroup defined by the particle - vortex symmetry for each layer depends on whether the pseudo - particle charge carriers are related by the symmetry to bosons or fermions , the same is also true for the bilayer case .",
    "we must ask for the explicit form for the matrices @xmath95 through @xmath97 separately for the case of bosonic and fermionic systems .      for bilayers built from two fermionic layers",
    "the 5 symmetry generators can be taken to be given by the following transformations , which express the symmetry @xmath67 acting separately on each layer , together with interlayer interchange , @xmath105 . collecting the matrices",
    "@xmath95 through @xmath97 into a @xmath106 matrix @xmath107 the 5 generators are @xmath108 here @xmath109 denotes the usual @xmath110 pauli matrices , with @xmath111 most of the remainder of this paper is devoted to the exploration of the observational consequences of this symmetry .      before exploring the consequences the fermionic bilayer symmetry , we pause briefly to record the symmetry which would apply to bilayers built from two bosonic layers . in this case",
    "the 5 symmetry generators can instead be found by replacing the generators @xmath112 and @xmath113 by the following two generators @xmath114 for simplicity we here do not further explore the consequences of this group .      in order to explore the consequences of the fermionic bilayer symmetry , @xmath115 ,",
    "it is useful to specialize to the experimentally relevant case where both of the layers are identical . in this case",
    "we may write the intra - layer conductivities as @xmath116 , and the inter - layer conductivities as @xmath117 , and so @xmath118 where @xmath119 denotes the @xmath94 unit matrix . with this choice",
    "the generator @xmath105 acts trivially on @xmath92 .    in this case",
    "the implications of the remaining four generators of @xmath115 are more conveniently identified by following its action on the following combinations @xmath120 , in terms of which we have @xmath121 where @xmath122 denote the projection matrices @xmath123 .",
    "physically , the conductivities @xmath124 describe correlations of the currents @xmath125 , where @xmath126 denotes the electrical current passing through layer ` @xmath127 ' .",
    "the action of @xmath115 on these variables is most simply expressed by also focussing on the matrices @xmath95 through @xmath97 which can also be written in terms of @xmath122 : @xmath128 , and so on .",
    "the integers @xmath129 , @xmath130 , @xmath131 and @xmath132 obtained in this way must satisfy @xmath133 separately for @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "similarly , the matrix @xmath96 obtained in this way is even provided the constants @xmath131 are also even .",
    "using these matrices it is clear that the action of @xmath115 on @xmath92 decomposes into a separate @xmath0 action on each of @xmath124  denoted @xmath136  with @xmath137 it is also clear that these two copies of @xmath67 commute with one another .",
    "the advantage of writing things this way is that it allows the results of ref .",
    "@xcite to be taken over in whole cloth , since this action is mathematically identical to the action of the fermionic symmetry on a monolayer . in particular , we see that writing the symmetry in this way implies that as the temperature is varied , the topology of the flow is given as in ref .",
    "there are then potentially two qualitatively different flow patterns , which differ only in the direction of the flow along the lines drawn in figure 1 .",
    "when the flow with decreasing temperature is in the same direction as is shown in figure 1 then an initially large ohmic conductivity falls with temperature , as is the case for the semiconducting monolayer systems .",
    "continuity implies that this direction of flow also holds in the limit of bilayers which consist of two monolayers which are sufficiently far apart from one another .",
    "this need no longer be true if a transition should occur to a qualitatively different ground state at a critical separation , such as happens once inter - layer correlations become important .",
    "the curves followed when magnetic field , @xmath11 , ( or carrier density , @xmath138 ) are varied at low temperatures can also be inferred from temperature - flow diagrams like figure 1 . for these purposes",
    "notice that different vertical lines correspond to different initial magnetic fields , and ( given the direction of flow given in figure 1 ) if these start from the top of the figure ( as is true for comparatively low - mobility samples ) then they are attracted to integer plateaux ( such as those at @xmath139 and @xmath140 in figure 1 ) as @xmath141 . by comparing the position for differing magnetic fields at a common low temperature",
    "once can see that the trajectories followed as @xmath11 is varied for fixed @xmath10 near zero lie along the separatrix defined by the semi - circle connecting @xmath139 to @xmath140 in figure 1.@xcite in this case the existence of the symmetry implies the following generalizations of the monolayer predictions to bilayer systems .",
    "* the flow as temperatures go to zero is towards the attractive fixed points , the complete list of which is @xmath142 with @xmath143 odd .",
    "* the plateaux , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , which may be related by such a semicircle must satisfy the selection rule @xmath146 separately for @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "* at low temperatures ( if particle - hole interchange is a symmetry ) the flow between plateaux obtained as the magnetic field are varied traverses a semicircle in the complex @xmath147 and a semi - circle the complex @xmath148 plane , with the semicircles centered on the real axis in each case .",
    "this last prediction assumes the two plateaux in question lie in the same in super - universality class  an exception to this semicircle rule arises if the varying magnetic field triggers a change in the category of the super - universality class of the transitions ( as we discuss in more detail below ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "bilayers states have been seen which exhibit properties more usually associated with superconductors rather than semiconductors and for these states an initially large conductivity would be expected to get larger as the temperatures drops , rather than lower as in a semiconductor . for these states",
    "the flow for decreasing temperature is again along the lines of figure 1 , but with the direction of the flow lines reversed from those drawn in the figure .",
    "the existence of such a flow is consistent with the symmetry , and can not be excluded on continuity grounds if the bilayer system in question is separated from the limit of well - separated layers by a discontinuous transition .",
    "indeed , we shall argue below that real bilayer systems do exhibit low - temperature fixed points of this new form , including examples @xcite for which @xmath149 and others @xcite for which the resistivity matrix is given by @xmath150 these states , which arise for small inter - layer tunnelling energies , are believed to involve a superfluid condensation of the current corresponding to opposite - charge flow in the two layers , and so is necessarily separated from the limit of widely - separated layers by a phase transition .",
    "we return to a more detailed discussion of the phenomenology of these new flows below .",
    "for any such a phase having reversed flow direction , repeating the arguments of ref .",
    "@xcite leads instead to the following predictions    * the flow as temperatures go to zero is towards the attractive fixed points , the complete list of which is @xmath142 with @xmath151 odd and @xmath143 even .",
    "* the plateaux , @xmath144 and @xmath145 , which may be related by such a trajectory must satisfy the selection rule @xmath152 separately for @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "* at low temperatures , if particle - hole interchange is a symmetry , the flow between plateaux obtained as the magnetic field is varied traverses a semicircle in the complex @xmath147 and a semi - circle in the complex @xmath148 plane .",
    "as discussed above , both of the latter two predictions require there to be no discontinuous transition as @xmath11 is varied which could change the category of super - universality class of symmetries that is relevant .",
    "we see in this way the possibility of two different categories of transitions amongst bilayer systems ( and two more if @xmath80 should also be a relevant group ) , with each being governed by a qualitatively different kind of flow . in both cases",
    "the trajectories of the conductivities has the shape given by fig .  1 , but the two categories differ in the direction of this flow as the temperature falls .",
    "the above predictions apply to the transitions between phases , provided that the phases involved both belong to the same category .      more often than not experiments do not separately distinguish the currents and voltages in any one layer , and quote only a partial measurement corresponding to the total current and voltage across both layers .",
    "this is the case both for _ bona fide _ bilayer systems as well as for spin - degenerate monolayers for which it is electron spin which plays the role of layer number .",
    "because these types of measurements are so common , we pause here to state what the above symmetry statements become in this important special case .    if the layers ( or spins ) are not distinguished observationally , then all that is measured is the total conductivity , @xmath153 , which is related to the inter- and intra - layer conductivities by @xmath154 . in the case of identical layers",
    "this simplifies to @xmath155    since we have seen that the bilayer symmetry generates a @xmath67 action of @xmath147 onto itself , we see that it also must generate an action on @xmath153 .",
    "interestingly , because of the factor of 2 in the relationship between @xmath153 and @xmath147 , the action generated on @xmath153 is _ not _ simply @xmath67 . instead , it is the transformation @xmath156 with @xmath4 even , which defines the group @xmath157 . this can be seen because @xmath158 is generated by @xmath82 and @xmath159 and @xmath160 and @xmath161",
    "are clearly equivalent to @xmath162 and @xmath163 when @xmath164 .",
    "we see that the total conductivity , @xmath153 , of unresolved bilayer systems enjoys a @xmath158 symmetry , which has slightly different consequences than does @xmath67 .",
    "there are again two cases , depending on the overall direction of the flow as the temperature decreases .",
    "in particular , if the flow lines are the same as for a semiconducting monolayer , predictions @xmath165 for @xmath147 imply the following for @xmath153 :    * the flow as temperatures go to zero is towards the attractive fixed points , the complete list of which is @xmath166 with @xmath83 even and @xmath38 odd .",

    "we see that , when particle - hole symmetry is present , the condition that the flow commute with the bilayer symmetry predicts a generalized semicircle law for the trajectories which the conductivities take at low temperatures as @xmath11 is varied . however , since changes in @xmath11 can also drive transitions between the different categories of phases of the bilayer systems , it is important to keep in mind that the semicircular trajectories need not follow if the system undergoes a transition from one category of phases to another . in order to understand the implications of the above predictions for real systems we must therefore keep track of how the phase of the system changes as the magnetic field , @xmath11 , ( or magnetic length , @xmath177 ) varies .",
    "physically , we expect that the kinds of phases which are possible for a given system depends on the relative strength of a typical inter - layer tunnelling matrix energy , @xmath178 , compared with the inter- and intra - plane coulomb correlation energies : @xmath179 and @xmath180 . in terms of these quantities",
    "we expect the following three regimes , which are schematically pictured as a ` phase diagram ' in figure 2 and discussed experimentally in@xcite,@xcite :    * when @xmath178 dominates both @xmath180 and @xmath179 then inter - layer tunnelling is large and the number of electrons in each layer is not separately conserved . in this case",
    "the fermi level can fall between the energies of the states whose wave - functions are symmetric and antisymmetric under inter - layer interchange , leading to what is effectively a single - layer system , denoted `` single monolayer '' in figure 2 . if @xmath67 is the relevant group then the older predictions , @xmath181 or @xmath182 , given above which apply .",
    "this would be expected to be the case at small @xmath11 . *",
    "if @xmath180 is sufficiently dominant over @xmath179 and @xmath178 then we expect the system to behave as two independent layers , denoted independent layers  in the figure . in this case",
    "we expect the direction of the temperature flow to be the same as for each monolayers separately , and if @xmath67 is the relevant group then it is the predictions @xmath165 , above , which apply .",
    "( if the conductivities in each layer are not distinguished , then it is instead the predictions @xmath183 which would be relevant . ) * when @xmath179 and @xmath180 are both more important than @xmath178 , then inter - layer coulomb correlations play a role and we expect new bilayer plateaux to appear , denoted correlated layers  in figure 2 .",
    "this includes the situation of bose - einstein condensation among the exciton states which form from pairs of electrons and holes in different layers . in this situation",
    "the existence of the superfluid state leads us to expect the temperature flow to be opposite to that of the decoupled monolayers , because conductivity decreases in a semi - conductor as the temperature is lowered and increases in a superconductor .",
    "this leads to the expectation that predictions @xmath184 are the relevant ones .",
    "0.4 cm 0.4 cm    so far this entire discussion applies just as well to spin - degenerate single - layer qhe systems as it does to spin - split bilayers , provided that we identify @xmath178 as the zeeman - splitting matrix element which is responsible for the non - coulomb part of the energy difference between the differing spin states .",
    "because the energies @xmath178 , @xmath180 and @xmath179 all depend differently on the magnetic field strength , any particular sample traverses a trajectory in the phase diagram of figure 2 as @xmath11 is varied .",
    "it is here that we must distinguish between bilayer and spin - degenerate monolayer systems , because they differ in the @xmath11-dependence which is likely for these energy scales .",

    "_ bilayer systems : _    for bilayers @xmath178 is not expected to depend strongly on @xmath11 , but it does depend strongly on the inter - layer distance @xmath6 , falling to zero exponentially quickly as the layers are separated . the way in which the phase structure can depend on magnetic field was examined in @xcite and figure 3 is a sketch of figure 1 from that reference . that analysis indicates that , at large @xmath11 , the ratio of the two length scales @xmath6 and the magnetic length @xmath185 determines whether or not the system behaves as two independent monolayers or as a correlated bi - layer , as shown in figure 3 below . as the magnetic field increases , at constant charge carrier density",
    ", the importance of the intra - layer coulomb energy ( @xmath186 ) relative to @xmath178 increases until intra - layer coulomb interactions destroy the correlated state and the system behaves as independent bi - layers , provided @xmath187 .",
    "we see from these considerations that for semiconducting bilayers at small magnetic fields @xmath178 should always dominate over coulomb energies , implying a description in terms of a single monolayer , for which the predictions @xmath181 would be expected to hold . as @xmath11 increases",
    "the coulomb correlation energies become more important and , if @xmath179 becomes important enough , a transition to the correlated bilayer regime can occur ( for which predictions like @xmath169 can apply ) , depending on the detailed properties of the sample in question . eventually for large enough @xmath11",
    "we expect @xmath180 to dominate , leading to the behaviour of independent bilayers , for which we expect @xmath165 to be relevant .",
    "as we shall see , this sequence of pictures seems to provide a good description of the kinds of phases which are seen in real quantum hall bilayers , although more detailed measurements to confirm or refute this picture would be most welcome .",
    "_ spin - degenerate monolayers : _",
    "a similar discussion can be made for spin systems , with two provisos : ( @xmath127 ) that the conductivities of the two spins of electron are not separately measured ; and ( @xmath188 ) that some of the relevant energy scales depend differently on @xmath11 than they do for bilayer systems .    for spin systems",
    "the quantities @xmath179 and @xmath180 measure the spin - dependent matrix elements of the coulomb interaction in a single plane , and so for the purposes of the qualitative estimates in this section we take both to be proportional to @xmath189 . for spin systems we also take the matrix element @xmath178 to be due to the zeeman interaction , and so @xmath190 .",
    "figure 4 gives a sketch of the relative size of these energies as functions of @xmath11 . in the case",
    "sketched the small-@xmath11 regime is dominated by the coulomb energies , assuming a sample with high enough mobility that quantum hall plateaux are visible at all . assuming @xmath67 is the relevant group , this leads to the predictions @xmath183 ( or @xmath184 ) , depending on the relative importance of @xmath180 and @xmath179 .",
    "is the relevant group  as appears to be the case for graphene  the analogs of @xmath183 are required for this group @xcite . ] for larger @xmath11 the energy @xmath178 eventually dominates to the extent that our simple @xmath11 parameterization continues to hold , leading to a monolayer behaviour , with predictions @xmath181 .",
    "we now explore how the above observations can be used to make nontrivial predictions for real quantum hall systems .",
    "what makes this tricky is the fact that when @xmath11 is varied , real systems can cross over between the different kinds of categories of phases ( as described above ) for which different symmetry predictions apply .",
    "such transitions are problematic because we only know that the predictions hold for transitions amongst plateaux within any one of these categories , and not for transitions in between different categories .    in order to see how the above arguments may be used in practice",
    ", we now examine their implications in more detail for several bilayer systems for which experimental results are available in the literature .",
    "our strategy for doing so relies on the fact that for each category described above there are three different nontrivial predictions : ( @xmath127 ) those governing the kinds of plateaux allowed ( _ e.g. _ @xmath191 , @xmath192 , @xmath193 or @xmath194 ) ; ( @xmath188 ) those governing the selection rules which express the plateaux that may be obtained from any given one by varying @xmath11 ( _ e.g. _ @xmath195 , @xmath196 , @xmath197 or @xmath198 ) ; and ( @xmath199 ) those describing the shape of the trajectories which the conductivities take as @xmath11 is varied between these plateaux ( _ e.g. _ @xmath200 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 and @xmath203 ) .",
    "our strategy is to use the kinds of plateaux to identify the category of phases which are present for each value of @xmath11 .",
    "once these categories are identified in this way we may then test the existence of the symmetry by asking whether the other two predictions hold for transitions within each category .",
    "most of the bilayer systems which have been studied experimentally fall into our ` single layer ' category , for which only the total conductivity , @xmath153 , is measured .",
    "for the purposes of this section we take the example of refs .",
    "@xcite , which together provided the first evidence for new kinds of hall plateaux in these systems having @xmath204 .",
    "both of these references provide explicit traces of the total ohmic and hall resistances at low temperatures as functions of magnetic field . a representative trace as given in ref .",
    "@xcite is reproduced here as figure 5 .    at weak fields a series of integer plateaux",
    "are seen with @xmath205 culminating in the first fractional state at @xmath206 .",
    "this is what is expected when tunnelling dominates , including the appearance of the fractional state once the coulomb interaction becomes large enough to compete with the others . throughout this region",
    "we expect predictions @xmath181 to apply , including the selection rule @xmath207 ( which can be seen from fig .  5 ) .",
    "the success of the picture can be tested on samples with particle - hole symmetry due to the prediction @xmath208 of a semicircle law for these transitions , for which measurements would be most welcome .    although all of the plateaux visible in fig .",
    "5 have odd denominators , they can not all be explained by the regime for which @xmath178 dominates .",
    "instead a transition occurs to the independent - bilayer category , for which predictions @xmath183 apply .",
    "the plateaux in fig .",
    "5 with @xmath209 do indeed have even numerators , but this in itself is not sufficient to distinguish between @xmath210 and @xmath192 . that the transition to @xmath211 occurs is instead seen in fig .  5 from the change to the selection rule @xmath212 for the plateaux above @xmath213 , indicating that @xmath196 applies rather than @xmath214 .",
    "for particle - hole symmetric samples @xmath201 the prediction of a semicircle law again applies , but one which links plateaux obeying the new selection rule ( @xmath196 ) rather than the old one ( @xmath214 ) .",
    "of all the visible plateaux the selection rule @xmath215 only fails for the transition from @xmath216 to @xmath217 , but there also appears to be considerable structure between these two plateaux ( including the incipient state at @xmath218  more about which below ) which indicates unresolved intervening physics .",
    "figure 6 displays the plateaux found for the same sample but with a smaller carrier density , @xmath12 ( obtained by applying a different bias voltage ) . as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite , this lower carrier density implies a lower effective inter - layer separation , @xmath6 , leading to nontrivial interlayer coulomb correlations .",
    "for such a regime the predictions @xmath184 would apply , implying that the observed plateaux should have @xmath167 with @xmath83 odd , as well as the re - emergence of the selection rule @xmath219 .",
    "this picture appears to be borne out by fig .  6 , which differs from fig .  5 mainly in the appearance of the new state at @xmath220 .",
    "such a state agrees with the prediction @xmath194 but would be forbidden for the independent - bilayer states which surround it , since these must all have @xmath167 with @xmath83 even .",
    "plateau is due to inter - layer correlations comes from its fragility to tilting the applied magnetic field @xcite . ] and it is further supported by the re - appearance of the selection rule @xmath221 for the transitions @xmath222 and @xmath223 ( or the @xmath224 state indicated in figure 6 , though there is no well developed plateau for that state ) , as dictated by prediction @xmath198 .",
    "a gold - plated signal would be the observation of the trajectory taken in the complex @xmath153 plane during these transitions , since this should be described by the semicircle trajectories predicted by @xmath203 in samples exhibiting particle - hole symmetry .    for still smaller",
    "@xmath6 the behaviour of the sample continues to evolve .",
    "this may be seen from the resistance traces given in figure 7 , which differ considerably from those of figs . 5 and 6 .",
    "this figure agrees in many ways with what would be expected from the trajectory of fig .  3 , including a phase of interlayer coulomb correlations , although there are also a few troubling aspects to this description , as we now describe .",
    "as discussed earlier , we qualitatively expect that shrinking @xmath6 causes @xmath178 to grow , and this should increase the value of the field , @xmath225 , at which the transition occurs from @xmath178-domination to domination by @xmath180 .",
    "we also expect the regime of independent bilayers to become narrower , and perhaps disappear , depending on how quickly @xmath178 grows compared with @xmath179 .    whether these are borne out by fig .",
    "7 depends on the regime with which each of the plateaux is associated . indeed all of the observed plateaux in fig .  7 , except for the one at @xmath226 , occur at fractions with odd denominators and so could be due to a tunnelling - dominated monolayer ( @xmath181 ) .",
    "on the other hand , both plateaux @xmath227 and @xmath228 have even numerators and so could instead be interpreted as being due to the independent - bilayer category of phases ( @xmath183 ) .",
    "these two options can be distinguished using the selection rule ( @xmath214 or @xmath196 ) , and since fig .",
    "7 indicates this to be @xmath229  apart from the @xmath230 transition , see below  it is the monolayer option which appears to be most appropriate . under this interpretation",
    "there would be a direct transition between @xmath231 and @xmath204 from the monolayer regime ( @xmath181 ) to the regime of inter - layer coulomb correlations ( @xmath184 ) .",
    "if this picture is right then monolayer - type semicircle trajectories ( @xmath208 ) are predicted for all of the transitions in particle - hole symmetric samples , at least up to @xmath232 .",
    "the @xmath230 transition is the only exception to the selection rule @xmath229 , and the interpretation of this transition is problematic within the present framework .",
    "however this could indicate the existence of a poorly - resolved state in between these two plateaux , similar to the way the incipient @xmath218 state causes a funny selection rule between the @xmath233 and @xmath224 states in fig .",
    "a more baroque interpretation takes the @xmath230 transition to mark the point where the transition is made into the independent - bilayer regime ( @xmath183 ) , in which case fig .",
    "7 would require a further transition to the correlated bilayer regime ( @xmath184 ) for the @xmath218 state , followed by a re - entrant independent - bilayer state at @xmath231 .",
    "such a picture would however also require a second transition to the correlated regime to account for the @xmath204 state and we shall not pursue this possibility further here .",
    "this analysis shows how the fact that there are three kinds of predictions may be used both to reconstruct the regime which is relevant , and to test the implications of the underlying @xmath67 symmetry of each quantum hall layer .",
    "the previous discussion involved only measurements of the total conductivity , @xmath153 , but more can be said if both @xmath45 and @xmath234 are separately known .",
    "we now describe the implications of the symmetry for one such a measurement .    ref .",
    "@xcite examines a crossover between two different plateaux ",
    "one with total filling factor @xmath235 and the other with @xmath236  and explicitly give enough information to determine separately all of the complex components of the resistivity tensor , @xmath49 and @xmath237 as follows .",
    "figure 9 reproduces the four resistance traces , @xmath95 , @xmath11 , @xmath96 and @xmath97 , given in ref .",
    "@xcite , where the sign of trace @xmath96 is reversed .",
    "traces @xmath11 and @xmath96 directly give the inter - layer resistivities , @xmath238 while @xmath95 and @xmath97 represent intra - layer resistivities , @xmath239    the extraction of the intra - layer ohmic resistivity , @xmath240 , from the data is a little less direct .",
    "denoting the @xmath241 complex resistivity tensor by @xmath242 then the eigenvalues of @xmath243 , @xmath244 are related to the corresponding eigenvalues of @xmath92 by @xmath245 trace @xmath95 of fig .",
    "8 then measures the ohmic resistance corresponding to the total conductivity @xmath246 consequently @xmath247 , and so trace @xmath95 gives @xmath248 , or @xmath249    given these resistivities , we see that the two plateaux observed in @xcite occur for @xmath250 which respectively correspond to @xmath251 and @xmath252 , and so @xmath253 and @xmath254 .",
    "notice that @xmath255 is not invertible .    according to our proposal ,",
    "the action of @xmath104 on the bilayer system should manifest itself as @xmath67 acting separately on @xmath147 and @xmath148 , with implications @xmath165 or @xmath169 , depending on the category of flows between phases in which the system lies . for @xmath144 prediction",
    "@xmath191 means in particular that @xmath143 is odd while @xmath193 implies @xmath151 is odd while @xmath143 is even .",
    "we see from this that @xmath256 corresponds to condition @xmath191 while @xmath257 corresponds to @xmath193 , and so the transition observed in ref .",
    "@xcite is _ between _ the two different categories of bilayer flows .",
    "because the transition is not purely within one category or another we have no right to expect either of the sets of predictions @xmath165 or @xmath169 to apply .",
    "interestingly enough prediction @xmath195 does still seem to apply , since both @xmath258 and @xmath259 satisfy the selection rule @xmath207 if we interpret @xmath260 .",
    "we have seen that the emergence of modular symmetries in two - dimensional semiconductors has striking observational consequences both for bilayer and spin - degenerate quantum hall systems , just as it did in the better - established case of monolayer semiconducting heterostructures .",
    "these consequences include predictions for the pattern of allowed hall plateaux ; predictions for selection rules restricting which plateaux can be obtained from which by varying magnetic fields and charge densities at low temperatures ; and , for samples with particle - hole symmetry , semicircle laws for the trajectories taken through the conductivity plane during these transitions .",
    "experimental verification of these predictions would provide support for the picture that such modular symmetries are to be expected on very general grounds for two - dimensional systems .",
