    "there is no observational evidence for the exact nature of ch stars in gcs .",
    "the chemical differences between ch stars that are intrinsic asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars and those in binary systems are detailed by @xcite .    only three ch stars were found in gcs so far : two in @xmath0 cen , rgo55 and gro70 @xcite , and a probable one in ngc 6402 @xcite .",
    "the two ch stars in @xmath0 cen can not be in the horizontal - branch phase @xcite .",
    "both gcs are of low - metallicity , and presumably belong to the galactic halo .",
    "searches for ch stars in other clusters have been unsuccessful @xcite .",
    "we report on the serendipitous discovery of a ch star in a globular cluster , and analyse its spectra to establish its properties and find clues as to its exact spectral type .",

    "the star was discovered during an observing run on 10 june 2010 , at the 1.93 m telescope of observatoire de haute - provence ( ohp ) aimed at obtaining integrated spectra of galactic globular clusters with the carelec spectrograph @xcite and the grating 300 lines / mm .",

    "two lick standard stars ( hr5933 and hr7030 ) from the list of @xcite , and an n - type cs ( apm 2229 + 1902 ) from the list of @xcite were observed on the same night .",
    "the signal - to - noise per resolution element at 5000  is s / n@xmath1129 .    in order to reach a better s / n in the blue and",
    "to benefit from a higher spectral resolution , additional long - slit spectra were obtained with the southern african large telescope ( salt ) @xcite on 12 and 20 april 2012 .",
    "we used the robert stobie spectrograph @xcite to make two 600 s. exposures with the grating gr900 and two 900 s. ones with gr2300 .",

    "finally the one - dimensional lower - resolution salt spectrum was flux calibrated using the corresponding ohp spectrum and summed with it .",

    "the lines of atomic hydrogen and baii are seen distinctly , which is not the case in c - r stars .",
    "the intensity of the cn band in our star is larger than in the case of hd 5223 and v ari .",
    "the c@xmath29 molecular bands near 4737 , 5165 , 5635 , 6052 are deeper than in hd 5223 .",
    "this indicates a lower temperature for our star and/or a higher c / o ratio @xcite .",
    "ch stars are classified into two types which follow distinct evolutionary paths based on their @xmath36 ratios ( e.g * ? ? ?",
    "late - type ch stars with @xmath37 are intrinsic asymptotic branch ( agb ) stars that produce the s - process elements internally .",
    "early - type ch stars with low values @xmath38 obtain the s - process elements via binary mass transfer .",
    "this is why the @xmath39 ratio is an important probe of stellar evolution .",
    "the band heads for @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 ( at 4737 , 4744  and 4752 , respectively ) are resolved even at medium resolution . in the following",
    "we will estimate @xmath39 and other parameters as accurately as possible using model atmospheres .      to estimate the effective temperature , surface gravity , c / o and @xmath36 for the ch star in ngc 6426 we used the hydrostatic dust - free models for carbon - rich giants of @xcite extended towards higher @xmath28 , @xmath43 , and c / o to fit the observational data .",

    "* edition ) .",
    "the model stellar mass roughly corresponds to the mass of stars at the main - sequence turnover point of ngc 6426 @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , it is not possible to derive more accurate values of the mass and chemical abundance of the star , given the resolution of our spectra .    the synthetic spectra computed with the coma code based on comarcs model atmospheres ( see * ?",
    "* ) were degraded by convolution with a gaussian function to fit the resolution of our data .",
    "the resulting synthetic colors were compared with the observed ones , providing additional arguments for a proper evaluation of the stellar parameters .    to obtain a good fit of the observational data with the model ( both photometric and spectroscopic ) we had to change not only the abundance of carbon , but also those of n and o , because only increasing c at a given @xmath28 , @xmath43 did not allow us to fit the cn bands .",
    "a moderate increase of o with dredge up or mass transfer is expected for carbon stars ( e.g * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . finally , we derived the following model parameters : @xmath47k , @xmath48 , c / o@xmath49 , [ n / fe]@xmath50 dex , [ o / fe]@xmath51 dex which corresponds to an absolute magnitude @xmath52 and the following synthetic colors : @xmath53 , @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 .",

    "although our aim was not to estimate the abundances of different chemical elements on these spectra , the depth and shapes of the main molecular bands are fairly well adjusted .",
    "we did not vary the isotopic ratio @xmath36 , since there is no significant difference between the shape and depth of the c@xmath29 bands in the model and those in the spectrum in the range 4737 - 4752  .",
    "[ saltspectrum ] shows the comparison between the higher resolution spectrum of the ch star and the best fit model .",
    "the increased n abundance allows the strong cn features to be better matched .",
    "the derived luminosity , @xmath28 , @xmath43 and the high isotopic ratio @xmath36 indicate that this is probably a _ genuine _ agb star .",

    "we now examine the alternative possibility that the ch star is a binary star rather than a genuine agb star .",

    "[ fig_gamma ] we show the total encounter rate @xmath61 versus the encounter rate @xmath62 for single binaries @xcite for globular clusters in the halo ( defined as having @xmath63 < - 0.80 $ ] dex ) .",
    "the parameters were calculated using the core radii @xmath64 and central luminosity densities @xmath65 from ( * ? ? ?",
    "* edition ) and the mass - to - light ratios from @xcite .",
    "we assumed that the m / l of ngc 6426 , not available in the catalogs , is @xmath111.9 , which is the most probable value for galactic gcs at low metallicities . the uncertainty on this m / l is small ( of the order of 10% ) .",
    "we also assumed that all binaries have the same semi - major axis @xmath66 , which is a more drastic simplification .",
    "the clusters are aligned along a relation of almost unit slope between the two encounter rates .",
    "the three gcs with known ch stars fall roughly in the middle of the relation .",
    "if all four ch stars are binaries , this suggests that no binaries can form when the total encounter rate is low , and that they are more rapidly disrupted than replenished if the encounter rate for single binaries is high .",
    "the number of known ch stars in clusters is admittedly too small to allow for any statistical inference on the probability of our ch star to be a binary .",
    "the three gcs have similar @xmath59 , but the parameter @xmath67 is lower in ngc 6426 than in the two other clusters , thus making our star perhaps less likely to be a binary star .",
    "but , as pointed out by @xcite , @xmath67 depends on the mass segregation , on the fraction of binaries and on their period distribution .",
    "furthermore , both @xmath67 and @xmath59 depend linearly on the semi - major axis , for which we assumed a universal value , but which can vary between a few and at least 200 @xmath68 , so that presently a better way to determine the binary status of our star would be to monitor its radial velocity .",
    "we have discovered a carbon star of ch type in ngc 6426 and derived its main physical and chemical parameters : @xmath69  mag , @xmath70  k , @xmath71 , [ fe / h]@xmath72  dex , c / o@xmath73 , n / o@xmath74 dex , @xmath75 . the data and the estimated encounter rates in the parent gc indicate that the object is likely an _ intrinsic _ low - metallicity carbon - rich agb star , but additional extensive high - resolution observational and theoretical studies are needed to reveal the role of a possible presently invisible companion on its evolution .",
