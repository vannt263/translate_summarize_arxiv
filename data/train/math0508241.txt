    "[ s : intro ] the approximation of multivariate functions from scattered data is an important theme in numerical mathematics .",
    "one of the methods to attack this problem is quasi - interpolation .",
    "one takes values @xmath0 of a function @xmath1 on a set of nodes @xmath2 and constructs an approximant of @xmath1 by linear combinations @xmath3 where @xmath4 is a set of basis functions . using quasi - interpolation",
    "there is no need to solve large algebraic systems .",
    "the approximation properties of quasi - interpolants in the case that @xmath5 are the nodes of a uniform grid are well - understood .",
    "for example , the quasi - interpolant @xmath6 can be studied via the theory of principal shift - invariant spaces , which has been developed in several articles by de boor , devore and ron ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite , @xcite ) . here",
    "@xmath7 is supposed to be a compactly supported or rapidly decaying function .",
    "based on the strang - fix condition for @xmath7 , which is equivalent to polynomial reproduction , convergence and approximation orders for several classes of basis functions were obtained ( see also schaback / wu @xcite , jetter / zhou @xcite ) . scattered data quasi - interpolation by functions , which reproduce polynomials , has been studied by buhmann , dyn , levin in @xcite and dyn , ron in @xcite ( see also @xcite for further references ) .    in order to extend the quasi - interpolation to general classes of approximating functions , another concept of approximation procedures , called _ approximate approximations _ , was proposed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "these procedures have the common feature , that they are accurate without being convergent in a rigorous sense .",
    "consider , for example , the quasi - interpolant on the uniform grid @xmath8 where @xmath9 is sufficiently smooth and of rapid decay , @xmath10 and @xmath11 are two positive parameters .",
    "it was shown that if @xmath12 has a zero of order @xmath13 at the origin ( @xmath14 denotes the fourier transform of @xmath9 ) , then @xmath15 approximates @xmath1 pointwise @xmath16 with a constant @xmath17 not depending on @xmath1 , @xmath10 , and @xmath11 , and @xmath18 can be made arbitrarily small if @xmath11 is sufficiently large ( see @xcite , @xcite ) . in general , there is no convergence of the _ approximate quasi - interpolant _",
    "@xmath19 to @xmath20 as @xmath21 .",
    "however , one can fix @xmath11 such that up to any prescribed accuracy @xmath22 approximates @xmath1 with order @xmath23 .",
    "the lack of convergence as @xmath21 , which is even not perceptible in numerical computations for appropriately chosen @xmath11 , is compensated by a greater flexibility in the choice of approximating functions @xmath9 . in applications",
    ", this flexibility enables one to obtain simple and accurate formulae for values of various integral and pseudo - differential operators of mathematical physics ( see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and the review paper @xcite ) and to develop explicit semi - analytic time - marching algorithms for initial boundary value problems for linear and non linear evolution equations ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the approximate quasi - interpolation approach was extended to nonuniform grids up to now in two directions .",
    "the case that the set of nodes is a smooth image of a uniform grid have been studied in @xcite .",
    "it was shown that formulae similar to ( [ 1.1 ] ) preserve the basic properties of approximate quasi - interpolation . a similar result for quasi - interpolation on piecewise",
    "uniform grids was obtained in @xcite .",
    "it is the purpose of the present paper to generalize the method of approximate quasi - interpolation to functions with values given on a rather general grid .",
    "we start with a simple quasi - interpolant for a set of nodes close to a uniform grid of size @xmath10 in the sense , that for some positive constant @xmath24 and any @xmath25 there exists at least one node @xmath5 with @xmath26 . then under some additional assumption on the nodes we construct a quasi - interpolant with gridded centers",
    "@xmath27 here @xmath28 are linear functionals of the data at a finite number of nodes around @xmath5 .",
    "it can be shown that estimate remains true for @xmath29 under the same assumptions on the function @xmath9 .    in order to treat more general distributions of the nodes @xmath5 we modify the approximating functions .",
    "more precisely , we consider approximations of the form @xmath30 with some polynomials @xmath31 .",
    "we show that one can achieve the approximation of @xmath1 with arbitrary order @xmath13 up to a small saturation error , as long as an `` approximate partition of unity '' @xmath32 with other polynomials @xmath33 exists .",
    "here we mean that for any @xmath34 one can find polynomials such that @xmath35 then one can choose the polynomials @xmath31 in such that @xmath36 this estimate is valid as long as @xmath37 and @xmath9 is sufficiently smooth and of rapid decay , but is not subjected to additional requirements as the strang - fix condition .",
    "moreover , we propose a method to construct the polynomials such that the series @xmath38 approximates the constant function @xmath39 up to an arbitrary prescribed accuracy .",
    "this method does not require solving a large system of linear equations . instead , in order to obtain the local representation of the partition of unity",
    ", one has to solve a small number of approximation problems , which are reduced to linear systems of moderate size .    by",
    "a suitable choice of @xmath9 it is possible to obtain explicit semi - analytic or other efficient approximation formulae for multi - dimensional integral and pseudo - differential operators which are based on the quasi - interpolant .",
    "so the cubature of those integrals , which is one of the applications of the approximate quasi - interpolation on uniform grids , can be carried over to the case when the integral operators are applied to functions given at scattered nodes .",
    "we give a simple example of formula ( [ e : nonuniform ] ) .",
    "let @xmath40 be a sequence of points on @xmath41 such that @xmath42 .",
    "consider a sequence of functions @xmath43 on @xmath41 supported by a fixed neighborhood of the origin .",
    "suppose that the sequence @xmath44 forms an approximate partition of unity on @xmath41 , @xmath45 one can easily see that the quasi - interpolant @xmath46 satisfies @xmath47 where the constant @xmath48 depends on the functions @xmath43 .",

    "s : due ] we show that an approximate partition of unity can be obtained from a given system of rapidly decaying approximating functions if these functions are multiplied by polynomials . using the approximate partition of unity , one can construct approximate quasi - interpolants of high order approximation rate up to some prescribed saturation error .",
