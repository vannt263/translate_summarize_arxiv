    "sadowsky @xcite and later wunderlich @xcite were the first to propose models for determining the equilibrium configurations of elastic mbius bands , idealizing them as a developable surfaces .",
    "in particular , linear isotropic plate theory is employed in @xcite where an integration across the width yields an energy density per unit length , reminiscent of rod theory .",
    "obtaining numerical solutions for the latter is challenging and was only taken up recently , cf .",
    "@xcite , @xcite .",
    "the interpretation of the model derived in @xcite in light of classical kirchhoff rod theory was made precise in the recent work @xcite . in an earlier work @xcite ,",
    "kirchhoff rod theory was employed to obtain certain smooth shapes of mbius strips , in which one cross - sectional moment of inertia of the rod is much larger than the other .    in both @xcite and @xcite ,",
    "@xcite the equilibrium equations are solved numerically on the half - domain with appropriate boundary conditions ; assuming flip symmetry , the full solution is generated by rotation through @xmath0 radians about the symmetry axis .",
    "that is , the entire closed - loop configuration has a single rotational symmetry ( by @xmath0 radians ) about some fixed axis .",
    "the same approach was employed to obtain configurations of twisted isotropic rods in @xcite . there",
    "the two ends of a straight isotropic rod are twisted through any relative angle and then seamlessly joined , as compared to the mbius band , where the relative angle is necessarily @xmath0 radians .",
    "in @xcite it is shown that all equilibrium configurations possess flip symmetry , i.e. , the above solution procedure can be used without loss of generality .",
    "that argument relies crucially on cross - sectional isotropy . in particular , we know of no such result here for strips , i.e. , other non - symmetrical solutions could exist .    given that",
    ", we address a more modest but nonetheless important question here , viz . , we assess the local stability of the flip - symmetric solution .",
    "stable or not , this does not rule out the possibility of non - symmetrical solutions .",
    "we consider the two distinct models employed in @xcite and @xcite , viz . , the kirchhoff rod model and the wunderlich model , respectively .",
    "the former serves as a  warm - up \" for the latter .",
    "also the kirchhoff model is a reasonable one for bands made of compliant materials like rubber . in order to test stability",
    ", we must first obtain reliable symmetric equilibria for the full closed loop , which is a challenging task .",
    "this is particularly true for the developable - surface model , due to the inherent singularity associated with the ruled - surface parametrization employed in @xcite .",
    "for various reasons , discussed below , we do not employ the formulations of @xcite and @xcite , @xcite .",
    "accordingly , the paper is taken up presenting our systematic formulations for both the numerical computation of symmetric equilibria and the assessment of their stability . while the latter is certainly new ,",
    "the former constitutes the first systematic approach to computing _ unconstrained _ equilibria of complete strips for the developable - surface model of wunderlich .",
    "the outline of this work is as follows . in section 2",
    "we summarize the well - known field equations for hyperelastic , inextensible , unshearable cosserat rods , ultimately adopting the constitutive assumption normally attributed to kirchhoff . in section 3",
    "we summarize our formulation , as first presented in @xcite , and compute solutions for the half rod with appropriate boundary conditions engendering flip symmetry .",
    "we avoid the use of euler angles and their associated singularities as in @xcite and @xcite ; the kinematical description of the finite rotation field here is singularity - free via quaternions . as shown in @xcite , the exploitation of a  conserved \" quantity delivers a complete formulation within the context of a linear space . as in @xcite",
    "we use the ratio of the cross - sectional area moments of inertia as a continuation parameter starting from the well - known flat , circular equilibrium configuration . in anticipation of our stability results",
    ", we then extend all solution fields kinematic and kinetic to the entire closed - loop configuration . in section 4",
    "we briefly present our results for flip - symmetric equilibria .    in a conservative problem such as the one at hand ,",
    "it s enough to check the positivity of the ( reduced ) stiffness matrix at an equilibrium to deduce that the total potential energy is a local minimum there , i.e. , the configuration is locally stable .",
    "unfortunately in the case of two - point boundary value problems , such information is not a direct by - product of the code auto .",
    "however , the real difficulty here stems from pointwise constraints like inextensibility and unshearability , present in the problem at hand . in section 5",
    "we employ the methodology of @xcite to overcome this .",
    "we first identify the discrete , numerical solution for the closed loop with a finite - element mesh , and then consider its linearization about the equilibrium configuration .",
    "this yields a stiffness matrix in the presence of constraints .",
    "a qr - factorization of the constraint matrix enables the determination of the symmetric projected stiffness matrix , defined on the orthogonal complement of the subspace spanned by the constraints .",
    "we then compute the smallest eigenvalues of the projected stiffness matrix . in this way",
    "we numerically verify the stability of all closed - loop solutions found .    in section 6",
    "we take up the wunderlich model , with the same goals in mind as above .",
    "as first noted in @xcite , but more clearly illuminated in @xcite , the resulting field equations are those of a cosserat rod in the presence of an additional  state variable \" of a purely geometric nature .",
    "in particular , the governing equation associated with the latter possesses a singularity wherever the curvature of the centerline curve vanishes @xcite . as observed in @xcite ,",
    "such a condition necessarily occurs at one end of the half - rod on the symmetry axis .",
    "this renders the numerical determination of complete flip - symmetric configurations and their stability assessment much more difficult . in @xcite ,",
    "a small external curvature is imposed at one end of the half - band in order to overcome the singularity that is otherwise present at that location .",
    "this is equivalent to the presence of a small externally applied moment at that end .",
    "consequently , _ this method does not yield an unconstrained equilibrium configuration _ : when the half configuration is rotated about the symmetry axis through an angle of @xmath0 , the small applied moment is doubled in magnitude and acts externally on the complete band , as shown in figure [ fig : dipole ] . in the structural mechanics literature",
    "this is often referred to as anti - symmetry , cf .",
    "@xcite . in any case , if the boundary supports for this half - rod are removed , the full band does not satisfy global moment balance . here",
    "we take a different approach to obtain unconstrained equilibria for the full strip .",
    "we use the same rod formulation described above but now add an internal  elliptic regularization \" associated with the state variable , characterized by a small parameter , to the potential energy derived in @xcite .",
    "the resulting euler - lagrange equation for the state variable is now singularly perturbed but not singular , and the extension of the solution to a complete configuration does not give rise to an unbalanced external moment . with this in hand ,",
    "we carry out the same strategy described above for the kirchhoff rod , but accompanied by taking the regularizing parameter as small as possible in the continuation scheme .",
    "another point of departure from the strategy used in the kirchhoff model is that a known configuration to initiate continuation here is not at all obvious . in section 7",
    "we start from a circularly bent , untwisted half strip of fixed width ; this requires the application of an end moment at the hinged end .",
    "we then execute a two - parameter continuation first relaxing the end moment and then aligning the hinge at the appropriate @xmath1 orientation .",
    "hereafter , the width and small regularizing parameter are employed as continuation parameters to obtain half - band configurations . in section 8",
    "we present our results for flip - symmetric closed - loop configurations . in section 9",
    "we take up the assessment of their stability .",
    "we first extend the development in @xcite to the more complicated problem at hand . then after a careful extension of all computed fields on the half strip to the full closed loop , the computational procedure for obtaining the projected stiffness matrix is the same as above .",
    "again , we find that all computed flip - symmetric configurations correspond to local energy minima .",
    "let @xmath2 denote a fixed , right - handed , orthonormal basis for @xmath3 , the translate space for 3-dimensional euclidean point space .",
    "we start by defining the special cosserat rod with centerline coordinate @xmath4 $ ] in a straight , stress - free reference configuration .",
    "the position of the rod is defined by the vector - valued function @xmath5\\rightarrow\\mathbb{r}^3 $ ] with the reference configuration s centerline given by @xmath6 .",
    "the cross - sections of the rod in the reference configuration are parallel to the plane @xmath7 .",
    "let @xmath8 denote the rotation of the cross - sectional plane parallel to @xmath7 at @xmath9 in the undeformed rod .",
    "we define an orthonormal basis field @xmath10 via @xmath11 the configuration of the rod is uniquely determined by the functions @xmath12 and @xmath8 .",
    "the director basis field , @xmath10 is attached to the centroid of the rod s cross section and defines the orientation of the rod s cross sections .",

    "with the exceptions of placing an over - bar above each quantity , the differential equations in ( [ eq : neq])-([eq : rprime ] ) are unchanged by this normalization .",
