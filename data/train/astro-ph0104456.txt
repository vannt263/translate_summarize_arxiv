    "recently cayrel et al . ( 2001 ) reported discovery of u along with a strong overabundance of the heavy @xmath1-process elements os and ir in the ultra - metal - poor ( ump , with [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 ) halo star cs 31082 - 001 .",
    "this star ( hereafter the u - star ) has [ fe / h ]  @xmath6 and is similar in certain characteristics to another ump halo star cs 22892 - 052 which has [ fe / h ]  @xmath7 and also exhibits a large enhancement of heavy @xmath1-elements relative to fe .",
    "the possible use of @xmath8u as a cosmochronometer was emphasized by cayrel et al .",
    "their data on the u - star also have important implications for stellar sites of the @xmath1-process and for nucleosynthetic yields of an @xmath1-process event . in this letter",
    "we argue that the observed abundances of os , ir , th , and u in the u - star are the result of the most frequent type ii supernova ( snii ) events and that the abundances of other @xmath1-elements can be predicted by a three - component model for abundances in metal - poor stars [ qian & wasserburg 2001 ( qw ) ] .",
    "we also argue that the @xmath1-abundances in the u - star most likely reflect the contamination of its surface by the ejecta from the snii explosion of a previous massive binary companion .",
    "if the binary survived the explosion , the u - star should now have a compact companion , most likely a stellar - mass black hole .",
    "these inferences could be directly tested by further observations of the u - star .",
    "we also show that the u - th age of halo stars provides an estimate for the `` local '' onset of @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis which only sets a lower bound on the age of the universe .",
    "the approach here follows that used by qw to develop the three - component model for abundances in metal - poor stars based on the abundances of the radioactive nuclei @xmath9i and @xmath10hf in the early solar system .",
    "these abundances require two distinct types of snii if the @xmath1-process is associated with such events .",
    "the two types are the @xmath2 and @xmath11 events ( wasserburg , busso , & gallino 1996 ; qian , vogel , & wasserburg 1998 ; qian & wasserburg 2000 ) .",
    "the @xmath2 events occur at a `` high '' frequency of @xmath12 in a standard reference mass of interstellar medium ( ism , mostly hydrogen ) and are the major source of `` heavy '' @xmath1-nuclei ( with mass number @xmath3 ) .",
    "the @xmath11 events occur at a `` low '' frequency of @xmath13 and are the major source of `` light '' @xmath1-nuclei ( with @xmath14 ) .",
    "it was predicted that ump stars would exhibit peculiar variations in abundances relative to the solar @xmath1-pattern reflecting early contributions from the high - frequency @xmath2 events ( wasserburg et al .",
    "evidence in support of this has been found by sneden et al .",
    "( 2000 ) who showed that abundances of heavy @xmath1-elements from ba ( @xmath15 ) and above in cs 22892 - 052 closely follow the solar @xmath1-pattern , whereas the light @xmath1-elements around ag ( @xmath16 ) are somewhat deficient .    data on ba and eu ( @xmath17 ) for ump stars ( mcwilliam et al .",
    "1995 ; mcwilliam 1998 ) show that there is a wide range in ba / h and eu / h for a fixed value of [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 .",
    "this suggests that the @xmath2 events responsible for heavy @xmath1-nuclei produce very little fe [ wasserburg & qian 2000a ( wq ) ] .",
    "it was proposed that the ( snii ) @xmath2 events are associated with black hole formation ( qian et al .",
    "this is in accord with the scenario of brown & bethe ( 1994 ) and could explain the lack of fe production in these events . the large dispersion in ba / h and eu / h at [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 was attributed by wq to the rapid occurrence of high - frequency @xmath2 events . at [ fe / h ]",
    "@xmath18 an increasingly clear correlation between abundances of heavy @xmath1-elements and fe is observed ( e.g. , burris et al . 2000 ) .",
    "this correlation would naturally be established as products from both @xmath2 events and low - frequency fe - producing @xmath11 events were mixed in the ism .",
    "the fe abundance resulting from an @xmath11 event is [ fe / h]@xmath19 ( wq ) .",
    "in addition to @xmath2 and @xmath11 events , an initial or prompt ( @xmath20 ) inventory of elements is assumed to explain abundances of fe and other associated elements in stars with [ fe / h ]  @xmath21 .",
    "the @xmath20-inventory was attributed to production by the first very massive ( @xmath22 ) stars prior to formation of normal stars ( @xmath23@xmath24 ) and onset of regular snii associated with the @xmath1-process .",
    "it was argued that formation of normal stars could not occur until a `` metallicity '' corresponding to [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 was achieved in the ism ( wq ) .",
    "the @xmath20-inventory was considered to represent the earliest stages of chemical evolution that need not be specifically associated with our galaxy .",
    "data on ba at @xmath25}<-3 $ ] ( mcwilliam et al . 1995 ;",
    "mcwilliam 1998 ; norris , ryan , & beers 2001 ) indicate that the @xmath20-inventory of heavy @xmath1-elements is negligible .",
    "as [ fe / h ] for ump stars reflect only the @xmath20-inventory of fe ( [ fe / h]@xmath26 ) and no @xmath11-contributions , we consider that abundances of heavy @xmath1-elements from ba and above in these stars only resulted from @xmath2 events .",
    "observations by sneden et al .",
    "( 1996 , 2000 ) and westin et al .",
    "( 2000 ) show that abundances of these elements in ump stars very closely follow the solar @xmath1-pattern .",
    "thus their @xmath2-yields can be directly calculated from the solar @xmath1-abundances . over the galactic history of @xmath27  gyr before solar system formation @xmath28 @xmath2 events contributed to the solar abundances .",
    "the @xmath2-yield of e.g. , os ( @xmath29 ) is then @xmath30 where @xmath31 for an element e and @xmath32 ( kppeler , beer , & wisshak 1989 ; arlandini et al .",
    "1999 ) for the solar @xmath1-inventory of os .",
    "@xmath2-yields of heavy @xmath1-elements from ba and above are given in table 1 .    by comparing the observed abundances of sr , y , and zr with those of the heavy @xmath1-elements in the ump stars cs 22892 - 052 ( sneden et al .",
    "2000 ) and hd 115444 ( westin et al . 2000 ) , qw found that the sr , y , and zr abundances in these two stars received significant to dominant contributions from a common source , the @xmath20-inventory .",
    "the @xmath33 values for the @xmath20-inventory of sr , y , and zr and the corresponding @xmath2-yields ( represented by @xmath34 ) calculated by qw are given in table 1 .",
    "the observed os abundance of @xmath35 in cs 22892 - 052 ( sneden et al . 2000 ) indicates that this star received contributions from @xmath36 @xmath2 events .",
    "a slightly different value for @xmath37 is obtained by using the observed eu abundance as in qw .",
    "the @xmath2-contributions to the sr , y , and zr abundances in cs 22892 - 052 are larger than the @xmath20-inventory .",
    "we assume that the observed abundances in cs 22892 - 052 for the light @xmath1-elements",
    "nb , ru , rh , pd , ag , and cd ( @xmath38116 ) are dominated by the @xmath2-contributions .",
    "their @xmath2-yields are given in table 1 .",
    "@xmath2-yields of @xmath1-elements and the @xmath20-inventory of sr , y , and zr are shown in figure 1 .",
    "as the u - star is a ump star with no @xmath11-contributions , @xmath11-yields calculated by qw are not given . in ",
    "2 we discuss abundances of stable elements in the u - star based on the above three - component model .",
    "the abundances of @xmath39th and @xmath8u in this star and implications for cosmochronology are discussed in  3 .",
    "data for the u - star clearly show an extremely large enhancement of heavy @xmath1-elements without any increase in [ fe / h ] from the prompt value [ fe / h]@xmath26 .",
    "the observed os abundance of @xmath40 is higher than those in cs 22892 - 052 , hd 115444 ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath41 ) , and hd 122563 ( [ fe / h ]  @xmath42 ; sneden et al .",
    "1998 ) by 0.54 , 1.04 , and @xmath43 dex , respectively .",
    "thus observations of the u - star clearly confirm the existence of a type of @xmath1-process event that produces heavy @xmath1-nuclei but no fe .",
    "this is in support of the hypothesis of the above three - component model that there must be two types of snii sources for @xmath1-nuclei , one of which does not produce fe .    using @xmath44 we obtain from the observed os abundance in the u - star that it had received contributions from @xmath45 @xmath2 events .",
    "the abundances of all other stable @xmath1-elements can be calculated from @xmath37 and the @xmath2-yields and the @xmath20-inventory in table 1 .",
    "these calculated abundances are given in table 1 and shown in figure 1 .",
    "while sr , y , and zr have substantial contributions from the @xmath20-inventory , these are small compared with the contributions from @xmath46 @xmath2 events for cs 22892 - 052 or those from @xmath47 @xmath2 events for the u - star .",
    "figure 1 also shows the solar @xmath1-pattern translated to fit the observed os abundance in the u - star .",
    "the calculated abundances for the u - star show that it should be deficient in the light @xmath1-elements from sr to below ba ( particularly y ) relative to the solar @xmath1-pattern .",
    "assuming the validity of the model , we consider the abundances predicted here for the u - star to be quantitative and reasonably reliable subject to uncertainties in the observational data from which the @xmath2-yields and the @xmath20-inventory are derived .",
    "absolute abundances relative to hydrogen in this star will provide a direct and rigorous test of the approach laid out here .",
    "we were informed by the referee that these are under active study ( hill et al . 2001 ) .",
    "the essential conclusion from our results is that abundances in the u - star should reflect the relative yield pattern of an @xmath2 event in addition to simply exhibiting high @xmath1-process enrichments .",
    "the high numbers of @xmath2 events for cs 22892 - 052 and the u - star require discussion .",
    "these two ump stars have essentially the same [ fe / h ] as the prompt value [ fe / h]@xmath26 .",
    "so they can not have received contributions from any fe - producing @xmath11 events . from the frequencies of @xmath2 and @xmath11 events in an average ism , the average fraction of @xmath2 events among all snii is @xmath48 .",
    "the probability for a standard reference mass of ism to have a number @xmath37 of @xmath2 events in a series is @xmath49 .",
    "the number @xmath36 for cs 22892 - 052 corresponds to a small probability of @xmath50 and the number @xmath51 for the u - star to an extremely low probability of @xmath52 .",
    "it follows that the observed high enrichment of @xmath1-elements in the u - star and possibly also cs 22892 - 052 can not be plausibly associated with many @xmath2 events randomly contaminating the ism but requires a special source .",
    "it takes @xmath28 @xmath2 events over @xmath27  gyr to produce the solar @xmath1-process ratio ( os / h)@xmath53 in a standard reference mass of ism . for the present galactic snii rate of @xmath54 corresponding to a total gas mass of @xmath55 ,",
    "the standard reference mass is @xmath56 .",
    "this is in accord with the typical mass of ism swept by an snii remnant ( e.g. , thornton et al .",
    "1998 ) . to explain the observed os abundance in the u - star by a special @xmath2 event contaminating",
    "the ism would require either extremely large fluctuations in the @xmath1-process production by an @xmath2 event or wide variations in the amount of ism that dilutes the @xmath1-process ejecta .",
    "it follows that the abundances in the u - star do not represent a sample of the ism with enormous enhancement in @xmath1-elements .",
    "we propose that the u - star was once a binary companion to a massive ( @xmath57@xmath24 ) star .",
    "the massive star exploded as an snii @xmath2 event and contaminated the u - star , providing a high enhancement in its surface abundances of @xmath1-elements .",
    "if the @xmath1-process material received from the snii is mixed with @xmath58 of hydrogen in the surface layer of the u - star , then only a fraction @xmath59 of the @xmath1-process ejecta from an @xmath2 event is needed to give the observed enhancement of @xmath1-elements in this star .",
    "if the proposed binary survived the snii explosion , the u - star should now have a compact companion , most likely a stellar - mass black hole .",
    "we were informed that the u - star has a rather high proper motion for its distance .",
    "long - term observations of its radial velocity should provide a definitive test of whether it is in a binary .",
    "we note that a large overabundance of o , mg , si , and s associated with snii explosions has been observed in the binary companion to a possible black hole ( israelian et al .",
    "1999 ) .",
    "we have ignored the possibility that neutron star mergers ( nsms ) could be responsible for the heavy @xmath1-elements .",
    "if nsms were the source for such elements in the sun , the average enrichment resulting from an nsm would be @xmath60 times that for an snii @xmath2 event ( qian 2000 ) .",
    "to explain the observed os abundance in the u - star and the range of os abundances in other ump stars [ a scatter in @xmath61 of @xmath43  dex ] by nsms would then require grossly variable amounts of ism to mix with the ejecta .",
    "as nsms play essentially no role in fe enrichment , the large scatter in abundances of heavy @xmath1-elements should persist at [ fe / h ]  @xmath62 if nsms were the sources for these elements ( qian 2000 ) .",
    "however , the extensive data of burris et al .",
    "( 2000 ) on the heavy @xmath1-element eu show that the scatter in @xmath63 is @xmath64 dex at [ fe / h ]  @xmath65 and decreases at higher [ fe / h ] .",
    "thus we do not consider that nsms are the sources for the heavy @xmath1-elements , nor can they explain the observed @xmath1-abundances in the u - star .",
    "abundances of @xmath39th and @xmath8u in the u - star have been used to determine the age of this star ( cayrel et al .",
    "if the @xmath39th and @xmath8u observed in a star are the result of a single snii @xmath2 event , the age equation for the star is @xmath66,\\ ] ] where @xmath67 is the relative yield of @xmath8u to @xmath39th for the @xmath2 event , @xmath68  gyr and @xmath69  gyr are the lifetimes of the two nuclei , and @xmath70 is the time interval between the event and observation . as emphasized by cowan et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and goriely & clerbaux ( 1999 ) , the calculated age depends critically on the relative yields that are very difficult to determine from _ ab initio _ @xmath1-process models .",
    "the solar inventory of @xmath1-nuclei at the time of solar system formation ( ssf ; 4.55 gyr before the present time ) is the result of previous galactic nucleosynthesis . assuming that the rate of snii production per hydrogen atom in the ism is constant",
    ", we have @xmath71,\\ ] ] where @xmath72 is the total time of uniform @xmath1-process production prior to ssf .",
    "the ratio @xmath73 ( anders & grevesse 1989 ) has an uncertainty of @xmath74 .",
    "the term in square brackets in equation ( [ sun ] ) ranges from 1 ( for @xmath75 ) to 0.318 ( @xmath76 ) .",
    "thus there is only an extremely restricted range in @xmath67 for a wide range in @xmath72 .",
    "the relationship between timescales and long - lived and short - lived @xmath1-nuclei has been discussed extensively by schramm & wasserburg ( 1970 ) .",
    "an estimate of @xmath67 was first made by burbidge et al .",
    "( 1957 ) and later by fowler & hoyle ( 1960 ) based on the number of progenitors for @xmath39th and @xmath8u .",
    "the estimated value of @xmath77 with guesstimated errors has not been substantially improved upon over the past 40 years ( cf .",
    "cowan et al .",
    "1999 ; goriely & clerbaux 1999 ) . for these values of @xmath67",
    "we obtain @xmath78  gyr which corresponds to a time of @xmath79  gyr since the onset of galactic @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis . the age of @xmath80  gyr for the u - star obtained by cayrel et al .",
    "( 2001 ) is for a single event .",
    "the value @xmath81 corresponds to an age of @xmath82  gyr for this star .",
    "the estimated ages of the u - star , the values of @xmath72 calculated from the solar system data for uniform @xmath1-process production rates , and the timescale calculated by fowler & hoyle ( 1960 ) for an exponential model are in general accord .",
    "the values of @xmath72 are also consistent with the uniform production period assumed above to calculate the number of snii @xmath2 events contributing to the solar inventory .",

    "gyr we obtain @xmath86 .",
    "a value of @xmath87 is similarly obtained .",
    "these yields are consistent with the observed th and u abundances in the u - star for an age of 14.5  gyr ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "a deeper question is the relationship of ages obtained from @xmath1-process chronometers to the age of the universe .",
    "it has been argued above that onset of @xmath1-process nucleosynthesis was represented by rapid occurrence of @xmath2 events at [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 .",
    "these events were preceded by nucleosynthesis in the first very massive stars that significantly produced only elements up to zr .",
    "the timescale over which aggregation of matter proceeded until a metallicity corresponding to [ fe / h ]  @xmath5 was achieved to permit formation of normal stars is not established .",
    "in addition , assembly , disassembly , and reassembly of baryonic matter at various stages in earlier epochs of the universe possibly leave a large time interval prior to onset of snii . from consideration of [ fe / h ] in",
    "damped ly@xmath88 systems , it has been argued that there is a long interval ( @xmath895  gyr ) between big bang and onset of normal star formation in protogalaxies ( wasserburg & qian 2000b ) .",
    "thus the ages obtained from @xmath1-process chronometers are substantially less than the age of the universe .",
