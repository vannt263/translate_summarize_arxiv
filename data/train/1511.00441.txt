    "identifying the most influential spreaders is an important step in promoting the adoption of new ideas , products and innovations , and preventing the epidemic disease from being pervasive .",
    "centrality measures are used to rank the importance of node in a network , such as degree  @xcite , closeness centrality  @xcite , betweenness centrality  @xcite , pagerank centrality  @xcite , leaderrank centrality  @xcite eigenvector centrality  @xcite , dynamic - sensitive centrality  @xcite and coreness centrality  @xcite .",
    "it contains the idea that there is a relationship between the topological position of a node in the network and its influence and capacity in a spreading dynamics . among them , degree is the simplest way and is most widely used , but it is based only on the local connections of a node .",
    "subsequent research pointed out that the coreness of node as identified by the @xmath0-shell decomposition  @xcite is a more accurate way in ranking node influence  @xcite , which has a low computational complexity of @xmath1  @xcite , where @xmath2 is the network size and @xmath3 is the number of edges .",
    "in addition , the @xmath4 index has a good robustness , which means that the relative ranking of the @xmath4 value for the same node remains unchanged when the network structure is incomplete , missing even up to 50% of the edges  @xcite .",
    "it is pointed out that the importance of a node is not determined solely by its direct connections , but also depends on the connection of its neighbors  @xcite .",
    "research results show that ranking measures by considering the neighborhood of a node are more accurate in identifying the spreading influence of nodes  @xcite .",
    "for example , by considering the number of neighbors within 4-step from the node , a local centrality measure is proposed which outperforms the node centrality of degree and betweenness  @xcite .",
    "the sum of the coreness of the nearest neighbors of a node is a better indicator of node spreading influence than the coreness  @xcite . in a ranking algorithm of iterative resource allocating , by considering the centrality of neighbors in a resource allocating process ,",
    "the final resource a node obtained is used to ranking the spreading capability of the node , which shows a great improvement over degree , closeness , and betweenness  @xcite .",
    "in addition , there are works based on counting the number of possible infection paths  @xcite in the neighborhood to determine node influence .",
    "intuitively , the larger neighborhood is taken into consideration , the more accurate we can predict the spreading outcome of a node .",
    "however , in the research of spreading phenomena in social networks , such as the spread of smoking , alcohol consumption , happiness , health screening , it is discovered that on average there is a significant relationship in behaviors between a node and its direct neighbors ( 1-step neighbor ) , and up to the neighbors neighbors neighbors ( 3-step neighbor ) , which is called the three degree of separation  @xcite .",
    "this implies a influence range from the spreading origin to the affected population .",
    "in addition , it is a challenging task to collect the complete network information in some real - world networks  @xcite , due to the large amount and the temporal and spatial change of the data , such as twitter and facebook .",
    "analyzing a large neighborhood seems unfeasible in such networks .",
    "given the effect of neighborhood , in this paper we first propose a neighborhood centrality based on the centrality of a node and its neighbors within multiple steps .",
    "specifically , we study the performance of the neighborhood centrality when 1 - 4 steps of neighbors are considered .",
    "we find that in general the neighborhood centrality outperforms the centrality of the node .",
    "furthermore , in most of the studied networks , considering the neighborhood within 2-step will result in a good neighborhood centrality .",
    "when the considered steps is greater than 2 , the improvement of ranking accuracy is not obvious and even negative .",
    "this means a saturation effect of the neighborhood on a node . discovering the saturation effect is meaningful in that when we consider the effect of neighborhood , taking the 2-step neighborhood into account will balance the cost and effect .",
    "in this part , we first introduce the centrality measures of degree and coreness , which are used as the benchmark centrality .",
    "then we propose the neighborhood centrality based on the degree or coreness of a node and its neighbors .",
    "finally we describe the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) model used in the spreading process , and give a brief description of the data sets used in the study .",
    "the degree centrality of a node @xmath5 is defined as @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is a node in the network @xmath8 , and @xmath9 if there is a link between node @xmath5 and node @xmath7 , otherwise @xmath10 .",
    "degree is the simplest centrality measure in quantifying node importance .",
    "the larger the degree , the more 1-step neighbors the node is able to influence directly .",
    "the coreness centrality of a node is obtained in the @xmath0-shell decomposition process .",
    "the @xmath0-shell decomposition method is used to decompose the network into hierarchically ordered shells from the core to the periphery .",
    "initially , nodes with degree @xmath11 are removed from the network together with their links . after removing all nodes with @xmath11 , there may appear some nodes with only one link left .",
    "we continue to remove these nodes until there is no node with one link left in the network .",
    "the removed nodes are assigned with an index @xmath12 .",
    "next , nodes with degree @xmath13 are removed in a similar way and assigned with an index @xmath14 .",
    "the pruning process continues removing higher shells until all nodes are removed . as a result",
    ", each node is assigned with a @xmath15 value , which is called the coreness of a node .",
    "the coreness reflects the location importance of a node in the network .",
    "a large @xmath15 means a core position in the network , while a small @xmath15 defines the periphery a network .",
    "coreness centrality is considered to be a better measure than degree to identify the influential spreaders in a network  @xcite .",
    "we propose a new centrality measure that encodes the centrality of a node and its neighborhood .",
    "we consider that the importance of a node depends not only on its direct neighbors ( 1-step neighbors ) , but also on its 2-step and even more steps of neighbors .",
    "a 2-step neighbor of a node is a direct neighbor of 1-step neighbor .",
    "similarly , a n - step neighbor is a direct neighbor of ( n-1)-step neighbor .",
    "the more steps , the larger range of neighborhood is taken into consideration",
    ". meanwhile , the weight of the neighbor s influence may be different . intuitively , when an infection starts at a seed node , the probability of a neighbor being infected decreases with the increase of its distance from the spreading origin . that is the larger distance , the smaller effect the spreading origin may have on the neighbor .",
    "based on these assumptions , we define the neighborhood centrality of node @xmath5 encoding the centrality of @xmath5 and its n - step neighbor as @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the benchmark centrality , @xmath18 is the step of neighbors taken into consideration , @xmath19 is an adjustable parameter that ranges in @xmath20 $ ] , and @xmath21 is the set of nearest neighbor of node @xmath5 . in the last item of the equation",
    ", @xmath22 is the direct neighbor of a node @xmath23 which is the @xmath24-step neighbor of the considered node @xmath5 , while the slashed node @xmath25 is the direct neighbor of node @xmath23 but is the @xmath26-step neighbor of @xmath5 .",
    "here we use degree and coreness as the benchmark centrality , and consider a neighborhood of up to 4-step .",
    "this equation means that the neighborhood centrality encodes the centrality of a node and its neighbors .",
    "in addition , the neighbors effect decreases with the increase of its distance from the origin node . in this work",
    ", we first set @xmath27 in equation ( 1 ) and then discuss its impact on the performance of neighborhood centrality when @xmath19 varies .",
    "we use the susceptible - infected - recovered ( sir ) spreading model  @xcite to simulate the spreading processes on networks and record the spreading efficiency for each node .",
    "we then compare the performance of the neighborhood centrality with degree and coreness in ranking the spreading efficiency of nodes and identifying influential spreaders . in the sir model",
    ", a node has three possible states : @xmath28 ( susceptible ) , @xmath29 ( infected ) and @xmath30 ( recovered ) .",
    "initially , a single node is infected and all others are susceptible .",
    "the infection spreads from the seed node to other nodes in the network through edges . at each time step ,",
    "infected nodes contact all its neighbors , and then recover ( change to @xmath30 state ) with probability @xmath31 . for simplicity we set @xmath32 . recovered nodes will not be infected any more and remain the state of recovered until the spreading stops .",
    "susceptible individuals become infected with probability @xmath33 when they are contacted by an infected neighbor .",
    "the spreading process stops when there is no infected node in the network .",
    "the proportion of recovered nodes when spreading stops is considered as the spreading efficiency , or spreading capability , of the origin node . while the final infected population may vary when the infection probability @xmath33 varies , authors of ref .",
    "@xcite pointed out that the relative ranking of the nodes spreading efficiency remains invariant under a wide range of infection probabilities . in our simulations , we chose an infection probability @xmath34 , where the @xmath35 is the epidemic threshold of the network determined by the heterogenous mean - field method  @xcite . under this infection probability ,",
    "the final infected population is above 0 and reach a finite but small fraction of the network size , in the range of @xmath36-@xmath37  @xcite for most nodes as spreading origins .",
    "we realize the spreading process for @xmath38 times and use the average spreading efficiency of a node as its spreading efficiency @xmath39 .",
