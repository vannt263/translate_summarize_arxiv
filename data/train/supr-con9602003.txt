    "typical results for @xmath40 _ vs. _ @xmath16 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , for both @xmath41 and @xmath42 .",
    "the low field portion is further shown in detail in the inset , which reveals essentially no change until a critical field @xmath24 is reached , above which @xmath43 increases rapidly .",
    "this critical field @xmath24 represents the field at which flux first enters the sample and is governed by both the meissner state of the superconductor and an effective geometric barrier at the surface .",
    "we are justified in calling it the lower critical field as demagnetization corrections are negligible in the case where @xmath44 .",
    "note that the presence of surface barriers would lead to hysteresis in the field dependence of @xmath45 at the onset of flux entry . in our data ,",
    "the observed hysteresis is minimal and is within the experimental resolution .",
    "it is also to be noted that surface barrier effects would scale the field values but do not affect the temperature dependence .",
    "0.45    notice that unlike magnetization measurements , where @xmath24 is deduced from deviations from linearity in the @xmath46 curve , the signature in our data at @xmath24 is very sharp .",
    "this is because the experiment effectively measures the flux density @xmath47 ( as will become evident later ) .",
    "hence , the signature at @xmath24 is a change from zero , and not a change of slope as in @xmath46 data .",
    "0.45    the @xmath2 dependence of @xmath48 for @xmath13 is shown in fig .",
    "this essentially has a linear behaviour from @xmath49 to @xmath50 , well represented by @xmath51 , where @xmath52 .",
    "this is unlike that seen in conventional low @xmath49 superconductors and even differs from the behavior of @xmath53 .",
    "however this anomalous behavior finds support in measurements on a related quantity , the superfluid density , measured via the condensate contribution to the complex conductivity , @xmath54 , which we have measured elsewhere @xcite using a @xmath55 @xmath56 cavity .",
    "there , @xmath54 was shown to have an anomalous temperature dependence well represented by @xmath57 ( also shown in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "now @xmath58 , and since @xmath59 $ ] , there is a good correlation between the linear temperature dependence of the @xmath24 and @xmath60 measurements .",
    "( note that for clean type - ii superconductors , @xmath61 varies as @xmath62 and thus @xmath63 is expected to have a weak @xmath2 dependence@xcite ) .",
    "above @xmath24 , @xmath64 increases strongly in the @xmath65 case , due to the increasing @xmath66 in the sample .",
    "a similar increase also occurs in the @xmath67 data , although here the effective @xmath68 due to demagnetization .",
    "this field dependence @xmath69 for @xmath70 arises from two effects of the magnetic field on the superconductor :  depairing of condensed electrons ( which dominates when the rf current @xmath71 ) and dynamic vortex response ( which dominates when @xmath72 ) .",
    "this is followed by a sharp increase starting and terminating at field values which we call @xmath6 and @xmath73 respectively . above @xmath7 ,",
    "@xmath19 increases almost linearly with @xmath16 , which is consistent with the normal state showing a strong positive magnetoresistance .",
    "there is an additional field @xmath8 just above @xmath7 which can be identified as the point where the @xmath74 and @xmath42 curves meet as seen in fig . 1 .",
    "we have observed a similarly rich structure in the transition region of the @xmath75 and @xmath76 compounds @xcite .",
    "the presence of multiple structure in the transition region , although interesting in its own right , makes the identification of a single upper critical field @xmath77 somewhat ambiguous .",
    "this difficulty is also compounded by the linear-@xmath16 magnetoresistance in the normal state .",
    "all three field scales ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) agree quantitatively with the @xmath77 values reported in the literature@xcite .",
    "while the exact origin of this structure is not yet precisely known , its presence in all the borocarbide superconductors we have studied seems to suggest an intrinsic phenomenon and is not likely to be due to spurious chemical phases , as will be presented in a forthcoming publication @xcite .    in this paper , we focus on the general nature of the depairing and vortex contributions to the rf penetration depth . to test the validity of the standard coffey - clem model for the depairing and vortex response in this system , an effective upper critical field @xmath77",
    "coinciding with @xmath7 is assumed for subsequent analysis .",
    "it is to be pointed out that our choice of @xmath7 as the effective upper critical field is not arbitrary and is based on other factors like the validity of the bardeen - stephen approximation @xcite which relates the upper critical field to the flux flow resistivity .",
    "a discussion on flux viscosity presented later in the paper will clarify this issue further .",
    "we now turn to an understanding of the field dependence of @xmath78 .",
    "the principal causes for this field dependence are the depairing effect of @xmath47 on the condensate and the dynamic response of the vortices to the lorentz force induced by the rf current .",
    "these contributions have been treated self - consistently by coffey and clem , leading to the following expression for the complex penetration depth which includes the full angular dependence : @xcite @xmath79 ^{1/2 }   \\label{eq : cc}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 and @xmath81 are the condensate penetration depth and the normal - fluid skin depth in the superconducting state , and @xmath82 and @xmath83 are the vortex pinning force constant and viscosity respectively .",
    "the field - dependence of the condensate background is represented by @xmath84 and @xmath85 $ ] , where for instance @xmath86\\left [ 1-(b / b_{c2})\\right ] $ ] in a two - fluid model . for @xmath41 ,",
    "the rf currents in the @xmath17 plane are parallel to the vortices and hence the lorentz force is zero for those vortices at the sample faces .",
    "( a schematic representation of the relative orientations of @xmath87 and the rf current , @xmath88 , with respect to @xmath16 is shown as an inset in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "thus the vortex response is mostly absent in the @xmath41 case , except for a small contribution of order @xmath89 from the edges , where @xmath90 and @xmath91 are the sample thickness and width respectively .",
    "this can be incorporated phenomenologically in terms of an aspect ratio @xmath92 ^{-1}$ ] which mixes the vortex contribution ( @xmath67 ) to the force - free ( @xmath41 ) term as @xmath93 .",
    "the angular dependence provides a nice way of separating out the depairing and the vortex contributions to the penetration depth .",
    "0.45    in fig .",
    "[ fig : norm ] we present the same data as in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] normalized with respect to @xmath94 . motivated by the observation that the field dependence of @xmath95 follows that of @xmath96 we have used @xmath97 for this normalization .",
    "theoretical calculations based on eq .  [ eq : cc ] , taking into account the small aspect ratio as discussed earlier and also assuming negligible pinning ( i.e. @xmath98 @xmath99 ) , are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : norm ] along with the data . for the vortex contribution , at fixed frequency",
    "@xmath100 the response is pinning dominated if @xmath101 and viscosity dominated if @xmath102 , where @xmath103 .",
    "it is quite striking that pinning is negligible even at @xmath15 , which would effectively imply that flux is in free flow as soon as vortices enter the sample above @xmath24 .",
    "this is in contrast to the estimated @xmath104 values of @xmath105 in @xmath106@xcite and @xmath107 in low @xmath49 materials @xcite . for @xmath41 , the low field variation of @xmath43",
    "is adequately reproduced by the calculation , confirming the presence of a finite vortex contribution consistent with the aspect ratio independently determined from the sample dimensions .",
    "the @xmath67 data shows a dip at a field below the effective @xmath108 .",
    "this can result from sudden changes in pinning or scattering which are parametrized by the terms @xmath98 and @xmath109 in eq .",
    "[ eq : cc ] . a rise in @xmath98 at a threshold field",
    "can be associated with the `` peak effect '' commonly seen in type - ii superconductors with weak pinning .",
    "the signature of the peak effect is a peak in critical current density and would show up as a dip in the rf susceptibility , which is what we are effectively measuring in the @xmath67 case .",
    "there is a general consensus that the peak effect arises due to enhanced pinning as a result of a rapidly decreasing rigidity of the vortex lattice just below @xmath110@xcite .",
    "however , there is still some controversy over whether it is a softening of the tilt modulus ( @xmath111 ) or shear modulus ( @xmath112 ) that leads to this decrease in rigidity @xcite .",
    "an alternate possibility is that this dip feature is due to an anomalous field dependence of @xmath109 arising as a result of unusual quasiparticle scattering in the superconducting state .",
    "since the effect is much stronger in the vortex response rather than the depairing , this is an indication that the scattering due to bound quasiparticle states in the normal vortex cores could also be responsible for the observed dip in the @xmath67 data below the effective @xmath77 .",
    "when the vortex term dominates as at @xmath67 , the @xmath113 data can be used to extract the pinning forces and viscosity as we have done elsewhere in both single crystals and films of @xmath114@xcite .",
    "a bardeen - stephen estimate of the viscosity can be made using @xmath115 , which yields @xmath116 for @xmath13 , compared to values of @xmath117 for @xmath56 .",
    "0.45    the data in fig .",
    "[ fig : norm ] can also be presented as the normalized flux flow resistivity @xmath118 which is presented as a function of @xmath16 for @xmath119 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ve ] .",
    "the flux flow resistivity approaches the normal state almost linearly with a slope @xmath120 @xmath121 consistent with the observations of gittleman and rosenblum in conventional superconductors@xcite .",
    "overall the response appears to be well described by eq .",
    "[ eq : cc ] assuming @xmath122 and @xmath123 , consistent with magnetization experiments which have also shown evidence for extremely weak pinning@xcite .",
    "the differences between the observed response and theoretical bardeen - stephen response ( indicated by the solid line in fig .",
    "[ fig : ve ] ) can be attributed to an underestimate of @xmath124 in the superconducting state as well as some variation of @xmath82 .",
    "if the dip observed in the @xmath67 data is associated with a change in pinning , we can estimate the change in @xmath98 in the peak region from the relative depth of the dip since @xmath125 .",
    "a plot of @xmath126 extracted in this form is shown in the inset to fig .",
    "[ fig : ve ] .",
    "0.45    the full angular dependence of @xmath43 for @xmath127 is shown in fig .  [",
    "fig : ang ] along with the fit generated using eq .",
    "[ eq : cc ] .",
    "the inset shows @xmath128 plotted against @xmath129 for the same data . a similar plot for a poly - crystalline @xmath56 sample of comparable dimensions is also shown in the panel .",
    "the excellent agreement between the experimental data and the coffey - clem expression of eq .",
    "[ eq : cc ] is obvious from the good fit and also the linear dependence of @xmath128 with @xmath129 .",
    "the slopes are vastly different for @xmath13 and @xmath56 as the response is pinning dominated in @xmath56 whereas pinning is almost irrelevant in @xmath13 at @xmath15 .",
    "the coffey - clem calculation as presented in eq .",
    "[ eq : cc ] assumes an isotropic @xmath77 case and from the good fit with the @xmath13 data one can infer that the effective @xmath77 is generally isotropic in this system@xcite , although a slight deviation of the data from the model at low angles might indicate the presence of some degree of anisotropy in these layered systems .",
    "elsewhere we have observed unusual angular dependence and anisotropy effects in @xmath130 related to magnetic order and details about this will be given in a separate publication .",
    "the magnitude and @xmath2 dependence of the three features in the vicinity of @xmath108 for @xmath13 ( @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath8 ) are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ht ] are in good agreement with those determined by magnetization measurements @xcite and the overall temperature dependence is fit reasonably well by a @xmath131 form .",
    "two aspects make the observed onset field @xmath6 extremely interesting : @xmath6 is located at about the same field where the dip is seen in the @xmath132 data and occurs further from the effective upper critical field than would otherwise be expected .",
    "the theoretical calculation fails to reproduce the finite slope of the transition , which would imply an unusual field dependence of @xmath133 .",
    "looking at it in a different way , the simple variation of the superfluid density ( @xmath134 ) as ( @xmath135 ) within the framework of a two - fluid model breaks down and one has to assume a stronger reduction in the superfluid density as @xmath136 . note that earlier studies on @xmath13@xcite using a superconducting @xmath56 cavity at @xmath55 also indicated disagreement with bcs or two - fluid models in the @xmath2 dependence of the surface resistance and penetration depth , as displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] in terms of @xmath137 .",
    "this may indicate the existence of scattering of unknown origin in the superconducting state .",
    "we believe the origin of @xmath138 could result from this anomalous scattering or vortex lattice softening / melting or a combination of both these effects . whatever the cause , the underlying dependence of @xmath139 in the vicinity of @xmath6 is masked to some extent by the mixing of vortex and depairing terms in the @xmath140 data .    in conclusion , the rf measurements presented here reveal a rich variety of electrodynamic response in the superconducting state of the non - magnetic borocarbide superconductor @xmath13 .",
    "in particular , @xmath141 and @xmath24 both have anomalous non bcs @xmath2 dependences .",
    "the experiments have very high sensitivity which enable observation of subtle effects on the superconducting order parameter and the vortex lattice due to the applied field .",
    "a unique way of studying the vortex response and field - induced depairing individually by variation of @xmath18 is presented .",
    "the angular dependence of @xmath142 is well described by the coffey - clem theory with an isotropic @xmath77 .",
    "a dip is observed in the vortex response which can be related to a change in pinning ( and thus to the `` peak effect '' ) or alternatively to anomalous scattering in the mixed state .",
    "pinning is found to be extremely weak , and consequently , the crossover frequency is expected to be orders of magnitude lower than that of most conventional and high-@xmath49 superconductors .",
    "structure is observed in the depairing transition from the superconducting to normal state , which is also found to have an anomalous @xmath16 dependence .",
    "thus although @xmath13 is in many ways a conventional high-@xmath143 type - ii superconductor , the high frequency measurements appear to indicate many unconventional properties of the meissner and mixed states .",
