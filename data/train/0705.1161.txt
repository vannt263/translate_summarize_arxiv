    "the inverse document frequency ( idf ) @xcite has been `` incorporated in ( probably ) all information retrieval systems '' ( @xcite , pg .",
    "attempts to theoretically explain its empirical successes abound ( @xcite , _ inter alia _ ) .",
    "our focus here is on explanations based on robertson and sprck jones s _ probabilistic - model _",
    "( rsj - pm ) paradigm of information retrieval @xcite , not because of any prejudice against other paradigms , but because a certain rsj - pm - based justification of the idf in the absence of relevance information has been promulgated by several influential authors @xcite .",
    "rsj - pm - based accounts use either an assumption due to croft and harper @xcite that is mathematically convenient but not plausible in real settings , or a complex assumption due to robertson and walker @xcite .",
    "we show that the idf can be derived within the rsj - pmframework via a new assumption that directly instantiates a highly intuitive notion , and that , while conceptually simple , solves an estimation problem deemed intractable by robertson and walker @xcite .",
    "in the ( binary - independence version of the ) rsj - pm , the @xmath0 term is assigned weight @xmath1 where @xmath2 , @xmath3 , @xmath4 is an indicator variable for the presence of the @xmath0 term , and @xmath5 is a relevance random variable .",
    "croft and harper @xcite proposed the use of two assumptions to estimate @xmath6 and @xmath7 in the absence of relevance information . * * , which is unobjectionable , simply states that most of the documents in the corpus are not relevant to the query .",
    "this allows us to set @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the number of documents in the corpus that contain the @xmath0 term , and @xmath10 is the number of documents in the corpus .",
    "the second assumption , * * , is that all query terms share the same probability @xmath11 of occurring in a relevant document . under",
    ", one sets @xmath12 , and thus ( [ eq : rsj ] ) becomes @xmath13 where @xmath14 is constant ( and is 0 if @xmath15 ) .",
    "quantity ( [ eq : chmatch ] ) is essentially the idf .",
    "is an ingenious device for pushing the derivation above through .",
    "however , intuition suggests that the occurrence probability of query terms in relevant documents should be at least somewhat correlated with their occurrence probability in arbitrary documents within the corpus , and hence not constant .",
    "for example , a very frequent term can be expected to occur in a noticeably large fraction of any particular subset of the corpus , including the relevant documents .",
    "contrariwise , a query term might be relatively infrequent overall due to having a more commonly used synonym ; such a term would still occur relatively infrequently even within the set of ( truly ) relevant documents . increasing with @xmath9 . ]",
    "robertson and walker ( rw ) @xcite also object to , on the grounds that for query terms with very large document frequencies , weight ( [ eq : chmatch ] ) can be negative .",
    "this anomaly , they show , arises precisely because @xmath16 is constant .",
    "they then propose the following alternative : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the croft - harper constant , but reinterpreted as the estimate for @xmath6 just when @xmath19 .",
    "one can check that @xmath20 $ ] slopes up hyperbolically in @xmath9 . applying @xmath21 and @xmath22 to the term - weight scheme ( [ eq : rsj ] ) yields @xmath23 ( which is positive as long as @xmath24 ) .",
    "the estimate @xmath21 increases monotonically in @xmath9 , which is a desirable property , as we have argued above .",
    "however , its exact functional form does not seem particularly intuitive .",

    "there are two main principles that motivate our new estimate .",
    "first , as already stated , any estimate of @xmath6 should be positively correlated with @xmath9 .",
    "the second and key insight is that _ query terms should have a higher occurrence probability within relevant documents than within the document collection as a whole_. thus , if the @xmath0 term appears in the query , we should `` lift '' its estimated occurrence probability in relevant documents above @xmath25 , which is its estimated occurrence probability in general documents .",
    "this leads us to the following intuitive estimate , which is reminiscent of `` add - one smoothing '' used in language modeling ( more on this below ) : @xmath26 here the @xmath27 in the numerator in the denominator ensures that @xmath28 . ]",
    "is a `` lift '' or `` boost '' constant.s offline , that is , before the query is seen . ]",
    "plugging @xmath29 and @xmath22 into ( [ eq : rsj ] ) yields the term weight    @xmath30    which varies inversely in @xmath9 , as desired .    furthermore , as hinted at above , selecting @xmath31 s value is equivalent to selecting @xmath29 s value for query terms whose document frequency is 0 .",
    "that is , @xmath32 is directly analogous to @xmath11 in rw s derivation . indeed , choosing @xmath33 is just like choosing @xmath34 , which is commonly done in presentations of the croft - harper derivation in order to eliminate the leading constant @xmath35 in ( [ eq : chmatch ] ) ; doing so in our case yields the following term weight , which is the `` usual '' form of the idf ( @xcite , pg .",
    "184 ) : @xmath36 finally , note that @xmath29 is linear in @xmath9 ; we have thus contradicted the assertion quoted above that developing a `` straight - line '' model is `` intractable '' @xcite .",
    "an interesting direction for future work is to consider lift @xmath37 that depend on @xmath9 .",
    "it can be shown that different choices of @xmath37 allow one to model _ non - linear _ dependencies of @xmath6 on @xmath9 that occur in real data , such as the approximately logarithmic dependence observed in trec corpora by greiff .",
    "importantly , seemingly similar choices of @xmath37 yield strikingly different term - weighting schemes ; it would be interesting to empirically compare these new schemes against the classic idf .",
