    "mounting evidence has lent strong support for the origin of long - duration gamma - ray bursts ( grbs ) in the death of massive stars ( see woosley & bloom 2006 for a review ; but also see fynbo et al.2006a , gal - yam et al .",

    "2006 for recent discoveries ) .",
    "specifically , a direct association between grbs and type ib / c supernovae ( sne ) is established for grbs 980425 , 030329 , and 031203 ( patat et al .",
    "2001 ; hjorth et al .  2003 ; stanek et al .  2003 ; malesani et al .",
    "these sne of type ic show no hydrogen or strong siii transitions in their spectra , and have never been seen in elliptical galaxies ( filippenko 1997 ) . while it is conceivable that all long - duration grbs occur contemporaneously with a type ic sn",
    ", their low event rate indicates that only a small fraction ( @xmath4% ) of type ic sne are accompanied by a grb phase ( van putten 2004 ; podsiadlowski et al .",
    "2004 ; soderberg et al .",
    "2006 ) . for stars to lose their hydrogen envelope prior to the core collapse and form a grb , current theoretical models have homed in on progenitors with initial stellar mass of @xmath5 , fast rotation speed , and low metallicity @xmath6 ( woosley & heger 2007 ) .",
    "these grbs are therefore expected to originate preferentially in metal - poor environment and/or underluminous galaxies .",
    "observations of five nearby ( @xmath7 ) host galaxies indeed show that the host galaxies tend to be underluminous and that two of these galaxies also have an integrated hii - region abundance below what is expected from a nominal luminosity - metallicity relation of field galaxies ( e.g.  prochaska et al .",
    "2004 ; modjaz et al .",
    "2006 ) . at the same time , chemical abundance studies of high - redshift ( @xmath8 ) hosts have been carried out based on absorption lines identified in early - time afterglow spectra ( e.g.  fynbo et al .  2006b ; savaglio 2006 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2007 ) , where the emission lines of an hii region become too faint to be detected .",
    "abundance measurements of the cold interstellar medium ( ism ) based on absorption - line studies , despite representing only a small volume along a pencil beam from the afterglow , are less subject to uncertainties in the ionization fraction or temperature of the gas , and therefore offer a more accurate assessment of the metallicity .",
    "comprehensive studies of afterglow absorption - line spectra have also allowed us to resolve gas at @xmath9 pc from the progenitor stars , providing direct constraints on the ism properties of the progenitor environment ( e.g.  prochaska , chen , & bloom 2006 ; chen et al .  2007 ; vreeswijk et al .",
    "2007 ) .    however , our understanding of the progenitor environment is far from clear .",
    "for example , roughly 50% of grb afterglows are located behind a large column of neutral gas with @xmath10 ( jakobsson et al .  2006 ) but no trace of molecular gas to very low limits @xmath11{\\lesssim}10^{-6}$ ] ( tumlinson et al .",
    "2007 ) . using a sample of 16 afterglow spectra ,",
    "prochaska et al .  (",
    "2007 ) showed that grb hosts have sub - solar chemical abundances and an @xmath1-element enhancement relative to fe in the ism , but also that a non - negligible fraction exhibit @xmath12% solar abundances .",
    "in addition , these authors also showed that even with a large neutral gas column , there can be little dust extinction along the sightlines in the host ism toward the afterglows ( see also starling et al .",
    "the lack of h@xmath13 can , in principle , be explained by a high destruction rate due to the enhanced photo - ionization radiation field in the star - forming cloud that hosts the grb progenitor and by a low formation rate inferred from the observed low metallicity .",
    "but at high enough gas density ( @xmath14 @xmath15 ) , self - shielding is expected to be effective and will promote h@xmath13 survival ( e.g.  tumlinson et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "super star clusters provide an interesting local analogue for understanding the formation of grbs for two main reasons .",
    "first , wolf - rayet stars , a popular candidate for grb progenitors ( e.g.woosely & bloom 2006 ) , are often found in young star clusters ( see crowther 2006 for references ) .",
    "second , star clusters contain a large number of massive stars in a small volume and are expected to have on average a higher rate of stellar collision and mass transfer between individual stars for nurturing the formation of a grb .",
    "various authors have proposed that dense stellar environments facilitate stellar coalescence for forming blackholes that power the grbs ( e.g.hansen & murali 1998 ; efremov 2001 ) .",
    "in addition , grbs have been considered as a possible source for powering giant hi supperbubble shells found in nearby galaxies ( efremov , elmegreen , & hodge 1998 ; loeb & perna 1998 ) a direct comparison between absorption - line properties in the ism surrounding super star clusters and those identified in grb host galaxies may therefore provide important calibrations for interpreting afterglow absorption - line observations .    to gain further insights for interpreting the afterglow absorption - line spectra of high - redshift grbs ,",
    "we have searched for ultraviolet echelle spectra of nearby super star clusters in the hubble space telescope ( hst ) data archive .",
    "ngc1705 - 1 , a super star cluster sitting at the center of a blue compact dwarf galaxy ngc1705 at redshift @xmath16 , is the only star cluster with high quality echelle spectra from the space telescope imaging spectrograph ( stis ) .",

    "it has a total luminosity of @xmath17 and an hii region abundance of @xmath18 35% solar ( e.g.  lee & skillman 2004 ) .",
    "a comparison between the on - going star formation rate and @xmath19-band luminosity indicates a formation time scale that is much shorter than normal irregular galaxies and comparable to what is known for grb host galaxies at high redshift ( e.g.  christensen , hjorth , & gorosabel 2004 ) .",
    "the spectra of the super star cluster were originally taken for studying the physical conditions of the galactic winds driven by starburst outflows ( see e.g.  vzquez et al .",
    "here we re - visit this data set and present new column density measurements of various low - ionization species . we compare the ism properties of the dense star cluster with those of high - redshift grb host galaxies .    this paper is organized as the following . in section 2 , we review known ism properties integrated over the entire galaxy ngc1705 and ism properties that are local to the super star cluster ngc1705 - 1 . in section 3 , we present our absorption - line measurements of the cold gas along the line of sight toward ngc1705 - 1 . in section 4 ,",

    "one of the most notable features in the ism of ngc1705 is the multiple super bubble shells , indicating gas outflow driven by the last episode of starburst roughly @xmath22 years ago that also formed most of the stars ( @xmath23 ) seen today in ngc1705 - 1 ( meurer et al .",
    "the galaxy also exhibits very little intrinsic reddening ( calzetti et al .",
    "1994 ) and shows no sign of molecular gas to very sensitive levels ( greve et al .  1996",
    "; hoopes et al .  2004 ) .",
    "moderate - to - high resolution uv spectra of ngc1705 - 1 from different space facilities are published in the literature . while most of the absorption lines identified in the spectra are of ism origin ( york et al .",
    "1990 ) , detailed stellar population analysis based on a few stellar photospheric lines have placed strong constraints on the age , metallicity , and imf of the cluster ( vzquez et al .",
    "the ism absorption lines exhibit two strong components with respective blue - shifted velocity of @xmath24 and @xmath25 ( heckman et al .",
    "2001 ; vzquez et al .",
    "the low velocity component is believed to trace the cold , neutral ism , while the high - velocity component is interpreted to originate in a gas outflow .",
    "abundance measurements based on low ions such as n@xmath26 , s@xmath3 and fe@xmath3 support the scenario that the cold neutral ism has been enriched primarily by type ii sne that occurred in the star cluster roughly @xmath22 yr ago ( sahu & blades 1997 ; sahu 1998 ) .",
    "in addition , the observed kinematic profile and the absorption strength of the ovi doublet are consistent with the expectations of superwinds undergoing radiative cooling ( heckman et al .",

    "the zero relative velocity ( @xmath34 ) corresponds to the systematic redshift of ngc1705 @xmath20 , measured in hi 21 cm ( meurer et al .",
    "1992 ) and in stellar photospheric transitions ( vzquez et al .",
    "the spectra include absorption features from the milky way and a foreground high - velocity cloud ( sahu & blades 1997 ) which occasionally blend with features from ngc1705 .",
    "these ` contaminating ' features have been identified and are indicated with dotted lines in the panels . in addition , stellar photospheric features are apparent in transitions such as civ and siiv , as a broad , shallow component extending from @xmath35  through @xmath36 .    the low- and high - ionization species in the ism of ngc1705 exhibit distinct kinematic signatures .",
    "the low - ion resonance lines , ( which excludes excited c@xmath3 transition , cii * 1335 ) , show two narrow components at @xmath37 and @xmath38 , while the high - ionization elements are broad and show velocity centroids systematically blue - shifted to @xmath39 .",
    "these high ions share the same kinematic feature as the ovi absorption doublet discussed in heckman et al .",

    "the best - fit model profile combining absorption from the milky way and ngc1705 is presented as the red curve in figure 3 .",
    "the total hi gas column density observed along the sightline toward ngc1705 - 1 is only about 10% of what is observed in hi 21 cm emission ( meurer et al .",

    "the large ratio of @xmath51=+0.5 \\pm 0.2 $ ] indicates a an @xmath1-element enhancement , which is qualitatively consistent with a chemical enrichment history dominated by type ii supernovae and little / no reddening observed for the ism of ngc1705 ( calzetti et al.1994 ) . although dust depletion can be substantial even when reddening is negligible ( e.g.  savaglio 2006 ; prochaska et al .",
    "2007 ) , the significant underabundance of nitrogen , @xmath52=-2.1 \\pm 0.1 $ ] , from heckman et al .  ( 2001 ) indicates that more evolved , intermediate - mass stars have not formed to produce abundant nitrogen and is consistent with a chemical enrichment history dominated by type ii supernovae ( e.g.  henry et al .",
    "2000 ) .",
    "in contrast with the grb host environment observed at high redshift , we do not observe excited ions ( e.g.  strong cii * 1335 transition ) for the neutral gas in the ism toward ngc1705 - 1 .",
    "instead , the observed cii * 1335 transition is blueshifted by @xmath53 from the neutral species ( see discussion in the following section ) .",
    "the lack of excited c@xmath3 in the neutral gas implies a warm neutral medium and/or low dust content ( wolfe , prochaska , & gawiser 2003 ) .      as noted earlier , high - ionization transitions such as civ 1548 , 1550 , siiii 1206 , siiv 1393 , 1402 , and alii 1854 , 1862",
    "are observed to be blue - shifted at @xmath25  in the stis echelle spectra ( figure 2 ) .",

    "this is similar to what is observed in the ism toward hd192639 ( sonnentrucker et al .",

    "the broad line widths seen in unsaturated lines such as cii * 1335 and aliii 1854 are suggestive of a collisional ionization origin .",
    "adopting the observed siii and siv transitions that share the same kinematic features with the ovi absorber ( heckman et al .",
    "2001 ) , we find @xmath54 and constrain the gas temperature at @xmath55 k under a collisional ionization equilibrium . further constraints for the gas temperature can be obtained by comparing the line width of cii * 1335 and aliii 1854 .",
    "we measure a doppler parameter of @xmath56  for c@xmath3 and @xmath57  for al@xmath58 from the stis spectra . assuming that these ions originate at the same location , we further infer a gas temperature of @xmath59 k and a turbulent velocity of @xmath60 .    under a collisional excitation scenario",
    ", we can also constrain the density of ionized gas based on the relative strengths between resonance absorption and absorption from excited states .",

    "we perform a multiple - component voigt profie analysis and measure @xmath62 and @xmath63  for the high - velocity component . the lack of siii * yields @xmath64 , leading to an electron density @xmath65 @xmath15 for @xmath66 k.",
    "recent observations of grb host environments have yielded two main results . first , the ism of long - duration grbs appear to be essentially devoid of molecular gas , despite exhibiting strong neutral - hydrogen absorption columns .",
    "second , these grbs occur preferentially in metal - poor , low - metallicity , low - luminosity , actively star forming galaxies .",
    "together these suggest that global properties of the hosts are particularly well - suited for the creation of the massive star progenitors thought to give rise to grbs .",
    "if true , the study of local analogues of the sorts of environments amenable to grb progenitor birth should help in understanding the nature of distant grb birthsites .",
    "ngc1705 is a well known starburst galaxy in the nearby universe , with special interest because of the clear presence of substantial o@xmath67 in a starburst - driven outflow .",
    "we have re - visited and presented new measurements of the ism properties along the line of sight toward the super star cluster , ngc1705 - 1 , using archived by unanalyzed stis echelle spectra .",
    "the study is motivated by the hypothesis that massive young star clusters offer a birthsite for the progenitor stars of high - redshift grbs , because of the dense stellar environment ( e.g.  hansen & murali 1998 ; efremov 2001 ) .",
    "the available stis uv echelle spectra of the cluster show numerous ionic transitions with a complex velocity structure , and allow us to use the same set of metal absorption lines for a direct comparison between known properties of the ism near the progenitors of high - redshift grbs and the ism properties around ngc1705 - 1 . here",
    "we discuss the insights we gain from the uv echelle spectra of nearby super star clusters for interpreting the afterglow absorption - line studies of distant grb hosts .",
    "the complex velocity structure displayed in the absorption - line profiles of different ionization species indicate a multi - phase ism near the super star cluster ngc1705 - 1 .",
    "based on fuse observations of the starburst , heckman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) presented a comprehensive study of the thermal state of the ism .",
    "these authors identified ( 1 ) a neutral medium as demonstrated by hi , oi , siii , and feii absorption , ( 2 ) a warm photoionized phase as demonstrated by the h@xmath1 emission nebula ( meurer et al .",
    "1992 ; marlowe et al .",
    "1995 ) and nii and siii absorption , and ( 3 ) coronal gas as demonstrated by the ovi absorption doublet .",
    "these results are well supported by our analysis of the stis echelle observations .",
    "given the small velocity offset of the neutral gas ( @xmath68 ) with respect to the nebular lines , heckman et al .",
    "propose that the neutral gaseous clouds represent neutral ism that has been engulfed by the expanding superbubble . under this scenario ,",
    "the distance of the neutral gas must be @xmath69 pc , the observed size of the superbubble , and the gas density is required to be @xmath70 for effective self - shieding from the ionizing radiation of the star cluster .",
    "together these constrain the cloud to be @xmath71 pc for producing the observed hi column density .",
    "given the large observed column density of o@xmath72 at @xmath73 , heckman et al",
    ".  also concluded that the coronal gas can not originate from behind the shocks induced by the expanding superbubble , but rather blowout gas ( super winds ) that are undergoing radiative cooling between photo - ionized fragments of the shells . in this picture , the ism around ngc1705 - 1 has been heated by both the expansion of super bubbles and the uv radiation of the central star cluster .",
    "the stis echelle observations allow us to constrain the gas temperature at @xmath74 k and a bulk motion of of @xmath75 .",
    "the primary objectives of the present study are ( 1 ) to explore an alternative scenario in which young super star clusters provide a likely birthsite for long - duration grbs , and ( 2 ) to examine whether available uv echelle spectra of a nearby super star clusters offer additional insights for interpreting afterglow absorption - line studies of high - redshift bursts . our current understanding of the host ism around high - redshift bursts can be summarized as the following .    first , prochaska , chen , & bloom ( 2006 ) argued that the large neutral gas column observed along an afterglow sightline is located at @xmath76 pc from the grb progenitor star , in order for mg@xmath26 to survive the intense uv radiation field .",
    "the associated heavy ions such as c@xmath3 , si@xmath3 , and fe@xmath3 in the neutral gas clouds would be subsequently excited by the afterglow uv photons for producing the observed absorption features from their excited states ( confirmed by vreeswijk et al.2007 for grb060418 ) .",
    "the neutral gas clouds in the ism model of ngc1705 - 1 from heckman et al .",
    "( 2001 ) offers a natural candidate for the presence of dense neutral clouds in the vicinity of a grb progenitor at high redshift that was centered on ngc1705 - 1 , in contrast to the @xmath77 aperture available for the fuse observations .",
    "the agreement between our respective @xmath45 and @xmath78 measurements , therefore , confirms that the neutral gas close to the super star cluster dominates the absorption column observed in fuse . ] .",
    "note that the observed @xmath45 along the sightline toward ngc1705 - 1 is more similar to strong lyman limit systems of @xmath79 observed in the hosts of grbs021004 , 050908 , and 060526 ( jakobsson et al .",
    "higher column density absorbers would imply either a smaller cloud size or higher neutral gas density .",
    "nonetheless , should a grb occur in ngc1705 - 1 , the neutral gas at @xmath80 pc would still remain neutral under the afterglow radiation field , but would be excited to produce the commonly observed transitions from excited ions .",
    "in addition , the ism of ngc1705 exhibits little / no trace of molecular gas , neither co nor h@xmath13 , despite the recent starburst episode @xmath81 myr ago and on - going star formation @xmath82 yr@xmath83 .",
    "ngc1705 resembles the small magellanic cloud both in size and in the total metal content , but has on average a substantially smaller molecular fraction : @xmath84 for ngc1705 - 1 ( table 1 ) versus @xmath85 near star - forming regions in smc ( tumlinson et al.2002 ) .",
    "the super star cluster ngc1705 - 1 near the center of ngc1705 is among the brightest star clusters in the local universe ( meurer et al .",
    "1995 ) , containing massive stars of @xmath86 and @xmath71 myr old .",
    "the lack of molecules in the ism around ngc1705 - 1 is reminiscent of what is observed in the high column density clouds surrounding grb progenitors ( hatsukade et al .  2007 ; tumlinson et al .",
    "the low molecular fraction and dust extinction for moderately enriched ism and high gas density appear to be remarkably similar , implying that the lack of molecules and dust may be due to the enhanced uv radiation from massive stars in the star - forming region that hosts the grb progenitor ( e.g.  hoopes et al .",
    "2004 ; tumlinson et al .  2007 ) .",
    "we further note that similar to what is observed in the afterglow spectra of high - redshift grbs , low - ionization species in ngc1705 - 1 are more confined in a narrow veolicty interval whereas high - ionization transitions exhibit larger velocity spread .",
    "the apparent offset in the velocity profiles of low - ionization ( such as feii ) and high - ionization transitions ( such as civ and siiv ) observed toward ngc1705 - 1 ( figure 2 ) is now understood as due to starburst driven outflows , based on extensive imaging and spectroscopy studies .",
    "it suggests that important clues for possible starburst nature in grb host galaxies may already be learned based on afterlow spectra alone . the is particularly valuable because the host galaxies of distant grbs are faint and challenging to be found in emission .",
    "of the six grb host studied in chen et al .",

    "the table shows that the two sources occupy a comparable parameter space .",
    "in particular , absorption - line studies of grb host galaxies show that the host ism of high - redshift grbs exhibits clear @xmath1-element enhancement with little dust extinction / depletion along the sightlines toward the afterglows .",
    "the similarity in the ism properties shows that this scenario for long - duration grbs to originate in massive star clusters is at least viable .",
    "the relatively low nitrogen abundance also signifies the young age of the progenitor star clusters , because nitrogen is produced primarily in intermediate - mass agb stars ( e.g.  prochaska et al .",
    "ngc1705 - 1 is unique among known super star clusters locally , because of its young age and massive stellar content .",
