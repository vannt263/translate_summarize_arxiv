    "one of the key questions in astrophysics is understanding the formation and early evolution of high - mass stars .",
    "they play a major role in shaping the interstellar medium due to their strong stellar winds and uv radiation fields .",
    "observations show that high - mass stars preferentially form in clusters ; therefore , if we wish to understand the formation of high - mass stars , we need to understand the clustered mode of star formation @xcite .    the actual formation of massive stars happens deeply embedded in molecular clouds behind thousands of magnitudes of visual extinction and is only observable at far - infrared to radio wavelengths , providing indirect information about the stars themselves .",
    "as soon as massive stars begin to emit uv photons and start to develop a stellar wind , the surrounding molecular cloud evaporates and the stars become visible at shorter wavelengths .    for the direct detection and the study of the recently formed massive stars ,",
    "the near - infrared is the most suitable regime .",
    "the emission of warm dust , the dominant source of emission at mid - infrared wavelengths , is much fainter in the near - infrared and the actual photospheres of the high - mass stars can be probed .",
    "the success of this approach is demonstrated by several near - infrared imaging studies ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* kaper et al . in prep . ) .",
    "these imaging studies reveal the stellar content hidden in those star - forming regions , but also show the limitations , as these studies are limited to regions with a@xmath3 less than @xmath4 30 mag .",
    "near - infrared spectroscopy , however , results in a much less ambiguous identification and classification of the massive star content ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "these studies demonstrate the diagnostic power of near - infrared spectroscopy in characterizing the young , massive , stellar population .",
    "previous near - ir spectroscopic studies only considered a limited number of stars per cluster .",
    "this incomplete spectroscopic sampling of the stellar population , as well as the complexity of the fields , prevents any systematic investigation of the stellar content in the context of their environment . a systematic study on how the stellar content depends on the cluster properties like total luminosity , evolutionary phase as well as their environment requires a full spectroscopic census of the high - mass stellar content .",
    "we started a program to obtain a full near - infrared spectroscopic census of the stellar content of a sample of high - mass star - forming regions by means of integral field spectroscopy using sinfoni at the vlt .",
    "integral field spectroscopy provides a spectrum of every spatial element in the field of view .",
    "this yields not only a spectrum of all the stars in the observed area , but also emission line images of hii  regions , photon dominated regions ( pdrs ) , and outflows . supporting _",
    "irac and mips imaging reveal the more deeply embedded objects and enable the classification of young stellar objects via their colors .",
    "this paper is the first in a series of studies presenting our integral field data set of 10 high - mass star - forming regions . as subject of this first study we chose the region rcw34 , associated with the vela molecular ridge .",
    "the region consists of a well developed hii  region interacting with a dense molecular cloud to the north .",
    "the interaction between the hii  region and the molecular cloud suggests that a triggered star formation scenario could be applicable to rcw 34 .",
    "three different mechanisms are discussed in the literature , all resulting from the presence of an expanding hii  region inside a molecular cloud @xcite .",
    "the first mechanism relies on the presence of pre - existing molecular clumps .",
    "the high pressure of the hii  region can result in the collapse of those clumps and the creation of cometary globules forming a bright rim .",
    "the second mechanism also produces such globules and bright rims , however the clumps are not pre - existing but created by sweeping up gas by the hii  region . the cores become unstable on short time scales and are slowly eroded away by the hii  region .",
    "the third mechanism is the `` collect and collapse '' mechanism @xcite .",
    "similar to the second mechanism , the hii  region sweeps up neutral gas ; however , in this scenario the neutral layer becomes unstable on longer timescales and very massive cores are formed . when these massive cores collapse they form new star clusters .",
    "we will determine the properties ( spectral - type , mass , age ) of the high- and intermediate mass stellar population of rcw34 by means of near - infrared integral field spectroscopy and _ spitzer_/irac images .",
    "the cluster environment is characterized via hii , hei , and h@xmath1 emission lines .",
    "the three triggering mechanisms are tested on the observed properties of rcw 34 and it turns out that an unusual mode of triggering might be at work here .",
    "the hii  region rcw 34 @xcite ( iras 08546 - 4254 or gum 29 @xcite ) is located in the vela molecular ridge ( vmr ) cloud c @xcite .",
    "the region is an optically visible hii  region of about 2@xmath5 2  in extent and slightly offset from the main dense cores defining the vmr cloud c detected by co observations @xcite .",
    "due to a similar velocity ( v@xmath6 = 6 km  s@xmath7 ) , @xcite argue that rcw34 is likely part of the c - cloud .",
    "a similar velocity has been measured from the cs line ( v@xmath6 = 5.5 km  s@xmath7 , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , confirming the association with cloud c , which would place the region at a distance somewhere between 1 and 2 kpc .",
    "herbst ( 1975 ) and @xcite allowed that the exciting star of rcw 34 might be more distant , but favored an association with the vela - r2 r - association at a distance of 870 pc .",
    "optical spectroscopy by heydari - malayeri ( 1988 ) implies that the central source vdbh 25a @xcite is of spectral type o8.5v . this suggests a distance of 2.9 kpc , supporting the idea rcw 34 is more distant than vela - r2 . in",
    "4.1 we use near - infrared spectroscopy of the cluster ob stars to derive a distance in rough agreement with heydari - malayeri ( 1988 ) .",
    "heydari - malayeri also detected a north - south velocity gradient in the ionized gas , which he suggested to be evidence that rcw 34 is an hii region undergoing a champagne flow .",
    "this is supported by deharveng et al .",
    "( 2005 ) who conclude , based on msx and near - infrared observations , that the region is not the result of the collect and collapse triggered star formation scenario .",
    "several signs of active star formation are present in rcw 34 .",
    "two water masers have been reported @xcite as well as a class ii methanol maser @xcite .",
    "associated with the water masers , cs emission has been found @xcite with an estimated mass of 1320 m@xmath8 .",
    "@xcite reported the detection of 1.2 mm continuum emission towards rcw34 .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows ; section 2 outlines the data reduction of the sinfoni and _ spitzer_/irac data sets used in this paper . in section 3 , the interaction between the hii  region and the cluster surroundings is studied using the irac data as well as the sinfoni emission line maps .",
    "section 4 focuses on the stellar spectra obtained in the sinfoni field ; spectral types , luminosity class as well as extinctions are derived , and in section 5 the stellar content is discussed and an age estimate is obtained for the nir cluster in rcw 34 . in section 6",
    "we discuss the complete region and combine all the different properties to derive a possible formation scenario for rcw 34 , and section 7 summarizes the main conclusions of the paper .",
    "near - infrared @xmath9- and @xmath10-band observations were performed using the integral field instrument sinfoni @xcite on ut4 ( yepun ) of the vlt at eso , paranal , chile .",
    "the observations of rcw 34 were performed in service mode between february 4 and 9 , 2007 .",
    "the non - ao mode of sinfoni , used in combination with the setting providing the widest field of view ( 8@xmath58 ) , delivers a spatial resolution of 0.25  per slitlet .",
    "the typical seeing during the observations was 0.7  in @xmath10 .",
    "the h+k grating was used , covering these bands with a resolution of r=1500 in a single exposure .",
    "we observed rcw 34 with a detector integration time ( dit ) of 30s per pointing to guarantee a good s / n ( @xmath4 70 ) for the early b - type stars within this cluster .",
    "rcw 34 is much larger than the field of view of sinfoni , the near - infrared extent of the hii  region is 104@xmath5 60  on the sky .",
    "the observations were centered on the central o8.5 v star ( vdbh 25a ) at coordinates : @xmath11(2000)= 08@xmath1256@xmath13 28@xmath14.1 , @xmath15(2000 ) = -43@xmath160555.6 .",
    "we observed this area with sinfoni using a raster pattern , covering every location in the cluster at least twice .",
    "the offset in the east - west direction was 4  ( i.e.  half the fov of the detector ) and the offset in the north - south direction was 6.75 .",
    "a sky frame was taken every 3 minutes using the same dit as the science observations .",
    "the sky positions were chosen based on existing nir imaging in order to avoid contamination . immediately after every science observation , a telluric standard of b spectral type was observed , matching as close as possible the airmass of the object .",
    "this star is used for the removal of the telluric absorption lines as well as for flux calibration .",
    "the stars chosen as telluric standards were hip 048652 , hip 045117 , hip 052202 and hip 040629 , one for each of the observing blocks .",
    "the sinfoni data were reduced using the spred ( version 1.37 ) software developed by the mpe sinfoni consortium @xcite .",
    "this software was used to apply all the basic steps of the data reduction like flat - field correction , dark removal , distortion correction , wavelength calibration and correction of bad pixels .",
    "special care was taken to remove bad pixels from the calibration frames .",
    "the construction of the final calibration data was done in three iterations by first constructing a preliminary calibration set used to detect and remove the bad pixels using the 3d information .",
    "the cleaned raw files are used to construct a new calibration set and the procedure is repeated .",
    "the bad pixels on the science data are removed using the same 3d interpolation method .",
    "however , due to severe cross talk between the pixels , the surrounding pixels are affected at lower intensity and are not properly removed by the algorithm",
    ". therefore we apply an additional bad pixel removal later in the reduction process . the cleaned science and sky frames",
    "are reconstructed into 3d cubes using the calibration data . also the dark frames are subtracted and the cubes are corrected for atmospheric diffraction .",
    "we applied the procedure described by @xcite to remove oh line residuals .    in the reduced cubes we discovered a drift of the stellar position versus wavelength",
    "the shift is strongest in @xmath10 ( up to 2 pixels ) and resulted in an elongation of the stars in the collapsed image .",
    "we measured the position of the telluric standard star versus wavelength using a 2d gaussian and fitted a spline to the change of position in both spatial directions .",
    "this spline fit was used to correct the science cubes .",
    "the residual measured on some bright stars in the science frames was within 0.5 pixels , which is acceptable for our purposes .",
    "the last step in the reduction process is flux calibration and removal of the telluric absorption lines .",
    "this is done using the extracted spectrum of a b type standard star , using an aperture radius of 6 pixels ( 0.75 ) . after the extraction",
    ", the correction for the telluric absorption lines in the science spectra is done in two steps : first , the telluric standard star is corrected using a high signal - to - noise atmospheric template spectrum .",
    "this high s / n spectrum is not taken at the same airmass and atmospheric conditions as our science spectra , but provides a first rudimentary correction in order to reduce the absorption contamination of the telluric standard star .",
    "second , the brackett and hei  lines are fitted with a lorentzian profile .",
    "the line - fits are subtracted from the original telluric standard star spectrum , leaving an atmosphere transmission spectrum.the flux calibration of the spectra uses the 2mass @xcite magnitude of the standard stars . as we only use normalized spectra for the point sources and flux ratios for the emission line spectra , the uncertainty in the flux calibration due to atmospheric variations is not critical .",
    "the correction of the atmospheric absorption lines and the flux calibration are performed on the 3d cubes ; the spectrum of every spatial pixel is divided by the spectrum of the telluric standard star and flux calibrated .",
    "finally , the individual 3d cubes of one observing block ( between 50 and 60 cubes ) were combined into one large 3d cube . for rcw 34 ,",
    "four of those large cubes are needed to cover the near ir emission of the cluster .    before extracting the point source spectra from the science cubes",
    ", an attempt was made to remove the extended background emission from the data .",
    "this background emission is primarily nebular emission from the hii region and the pdr ( brackett lines , hei , h@xmath1 ) .",
    "a median filter with a kernel of 5 pixels is used to remove the extended nebular component in the cubes .",
    "we applied this median filter 3 times to remove any high frequency variations present which could be due to stars .",
    "this median filtering has only a small effect on the stellar continuum ; the contribution in the total flux is less than 1 % .",
    "the point sources were extracted using a circular aperture with a radius of 6 pixels , analogous to that of the standard star .",
    "several maps centered on emission lines as well as continuum maps are created from the combined sinfoni data cubes .",
    "the maps are made by summing 4 to 7 slices of the data cube in the wavelength direction .",
    "the images in the spectral lines are corrected for continuum emission from the stars by interpolating each pixel of the adjacent continuum images ( bluewards and redwards of the line , respectively ) .",
    "this results in a clean subtraction for most of the stars .",
    "however , for the brightest stars in the maps , residuals remain present .",
    "an interpolation of the line emission a bit further away from the stars successfully restored these residuals .",
    "we created velocity maps of the strongest emission lines , br@xmath17  and h@xmath1 , for every ( spatial ) pixel in the data cube .",
    "the central velocity of the br@xmath17  and h@xmath1 emission line is derived from a gaussian fit to the line profile . to obtain better accuracy in the wavelength calibration",
    "we performed the same fitting procedure to a nearby oh skyline .",
    "finally , the velocities were converted to the local standard of rest .",
    "the errors were calculated by quadratically summing the fitting errors on the nebular line and the oh line and are on the order of 10 - 15 km  s@xmath7 .",
    "additional data obtained with irac @xcite on board of the _ spitzer _ satellite have been retrieved from the _ spitzer _ archive ( pid : 40791 , pi : majewski ) .",
    "the data were obtained on january 31 , 2008 in a mapping mode , covering a large part of the outer galaxy .",
    "we selected the frames covering the area around the cluster as well as an adjacent control field .",
    "each frame has an exposure time of 1.2 seconds and every position is covered twice .",
    "the raw frames were processed using the standard pipeline version s17.02 to produce the basic calibration data set .",
    "this data set was processed further using mopex version 16.2.1 @xcite .",
    "as the irac data are undersampled , aperture photometry is preferred above psf - fitting photometry .",
    "source detection and photometry were performed using the daophot package under iraf .",
    "point sources with a peak level of more than 5 times the rms of the background were detected .",
    "aperture photometry was applied with an aperture of 3 pixels ( 3.7 ) and a sky annulus between 3 ( 3.7 ) and 7 ( 8.5 ) pixels .",
    "these small values were chosen due to the variable extended emission .",
    "the appropriate aperture corrections and zeropoints were adopted ( tables 5.1 and 5.7 of the irac data handbook ) to obtain the magnitudes of the objects .",
    "nir imaging ( bik 2004 ; deharveng et al . 2005 ) shows an hii  region extending about @xmath18 around the central star vdbh 25a . the irac images ( fig .",

    "most of these objects are located near the bright arc in the north , but also some objects are associated with the fainter extended emission in the southern part of the bubble . although no obvious cluster is visible inside the bubble , the class ii objects located inside the bubble suggest a recent star formation event .",
    "this might have been responsible for the creation of the bubble @xcite .",
    "the location of the younger protostars in the outer regions of the bubble indicates the presence of a more recent generation of stars near the edge of the bubble .",

    "the region is dominated by the two bright stars in the center of the field ( one of them is vdbh 25a at the location asterisk symbol ) and a relatively sparse cluster of about 130 stars down to @xmath10=17 mag , surrounding the central region .",

    "comparison of the location of the pms stars with these evolutionary tracks yields an approximate mass varying from @xmath4 3 m@xmath8 for the brightest stars to 1.5 m@xmath8 .",
    "over - plotted in the right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : hrd ] are the pms isochrones ( solid lines ) between 0.1 and 10 myr .",
    "the location of the g- and k stars is consistent with a range of ages .",
    "the brightest object ( # 6 ) lies between the 0.3 and 0.5 myr isochrones ; however , the majority of the objects span the 1 - 3 myr isochrones , with the more massive objects closer to the 1 myr isochrone . for the less massive objects ,",
    "the spread in age is larger , most likely due to higher uncertainties in the spectral type determination .",
    "the location of the pms stars suggests an age of 2 @xmath2 1 myr .",
    "comparison of the location of the pms stars in the hrd with those of the herbig aebe stars @xcite shows that the pms stars are younger than the herbig aebe stars and will evolve from their present g- and k spectral type to late b , a or early f spectral type when they become main sequence stars .",
    "this also explains the fact that no a or f stars are spectroscopically detected , as they are still in the pms phase at cooler temperatures .    even though the pms stars are younger than the herbig aebe stars , they have , in contrast to the herbig stars ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , no k - band excess . this could be the result of a different disk structure , but also caused by the fact that the pms stars are emitting most of their energy in the near - infrared wavelength regime , where the seds of herbig aebe stars peak in the optical , thereby outshining the contribution of the circumstellar disk .",
    "the extinction measurements show that the sources north of the hii  region are more deeply embedded in the molecular cloud .",
    "a younger age for this region is suggested by the presence of several protostars as well as outflows and a dense molecular cloud , which would suggest a younger age for the pms object in this area as well .",
    "the pms stars north of the hii  region ( # 6 , # 8 , # 16 , # 24 ) all have the brightest absolute magnitude in their temperature bin with source # 6 as an extreme example .",
    "their position in the hrd could suggest that they are the youngest of the stars of given spectral type .",
    "however , their high - extinction leads to a selection effect ( only the brightest sources are detected ) . fainter sources would fall below the limit where sinfoni spectra could be classified",
    "so , if there were an age difference , the current data would not be able to quantify this .",
    "deeper spectroscopic observations to find more of the high - extintion pms stars north of the hii  region would be required to make any definitive statements .",
    "as the sinfoni observations show , large extinction variations are present in rcw 34 .",
    "the high extinction towards the north means that we miss sources that are too deeply embedded to be visible in the k - band . in our irac catalogue",
    ", we found 2 sources with no near - infrared counterpart ( # 28 and # 29 in table [ tab : master ] ) .",
    "both sources have irac colors of deeply embedded protostars ( class 0/i ) .",
    "source # 28 is located in the north - east corner of the sinfoni field , only 3  away from one of the outflows detected in the h@xmath1 line emission ( outflow c , sect .",
    "the other embedded source ( # 29 ) is located very close to source # 1 , but is not related .",
    "@xcite and @xcite detected # 29 as a mid - infrared excess towards vdbh 25a .",
    "the irac images show , however , that it is a separate source .",
    "the sed of # 29 is difficult to determine ; at 3.6   the contribution of the o8.5v star is still present , and at 5.8 and 8.0  this object is the brightest source at mir wavelengths . to determine a better sed , high - resolution and deeper mid - infrared observations are needed to discriminate between the emission from the protostar and the arc in the north .",
    "additionally , as discussed above , the irac counterpart of source # 14 could be another embedded protostar not seen at nir wavelengths .    outside the sinfoni field , several",
    "other protostars are located .",
    "some of these objects seem to have a @xmath10-band counterpart in the sofi image of @xcite , suggesting that the objects in our sinfoni field are even more embedded than those located a bit further away from the arc .",
    "irac imaging reveals a large bubble surrounded by extended 8  emission . inside this bubble",
    "is a cluster of intermediate and low - mass class ii objects .",
    "typical ages for class ii objects are of the order of a few myrs @xcite , not distinguishable from the age of the stars in the hii  region .",
    "the class 0/i stars , identified mainly close to the bright arc at the northern edge of the hii  region , might be significantly younger .",
    "@xcite suggest an age of @xmath44 years for class i sources ; however , @xcite present evidence that the low - mass class i objects in taurus have a similar age as the class ii sources .",
    "the location of the class 0/i sources coincides with methanol masers , cs emission , high extinction and outflows , and therefore are most likely younger than the objects inside the bubble and the hii  region .",
    "comparing the 2mass @xmath10-band magnitudes of the class ii stars in the bubble with the @xmath10-band magnitudes of the pms stars in the hii  region shows that 13 out of 17 class ii objects are about a magnitude brighter .",
    "the other four are of similar magnitude .",
    "additionally , in a ( @xmath45 ) vs. ( @xmath46 ) color - color plot , most of the class ii sources have a near - infrared excess and cover the same region in the color - color diagram as the herbig ae stars @xcite .    the difference in @xmath10-band magnitude",
    "could be explained with the presence of a @xmath10-band excess , suggesting that the class ii sources are more similar to the herbig ae stars and are therefore more evolved than the pms stars .",
    "an optical spectroscopic classification is needed to confirm this .",
    "the location of the central star of the hii region , near the northern edge of the bubble suggests that this source might not have created the bubble .",
    "also the h@xmath11 @xcite as well as the br@xmath17  emission peaks at the location of the o star . in the rest of the bubble",
    "only faint h@xmath11 emission is present , indicating the absence of massive stars inside the bubble .",
    "apart from the class ii sources detected in the bubble , one source in the center ( fig .",
    "[ fig : spitzer_objects ] ) is detected without infrared excess .",
    "the magnitude at 3.6  ( 10.0 @xmath2 0.02 mag ) is compatible with a b0v star at the distance of rcw 34 .",
    "however , the optical photometry of the source taken from the usno catalogue @xcite , is not compatible with a ( reddened ) early type star .",
    "therefore we conclude that this star an unrelated , foreground object .",
    "this raises the question whether other mechanisms could be responsible for the bubble .",
    "the scenario that the bubble would be created by a supernova seems unlikely .",
    "as the stars in the bubble are only a few myrs old , the supernova needs to come from an early type o star . assuming a normal imf , the other o stars still would have to be visible .",
    "massive stars affect their environment by ionizing photons and stellar winds . estimating the mechanical luminosity ( e@xmath47 = 1/2 mv@xmath48 ) needed to blow a bubble with a radius of 2.5 pc inside a medium with a typical molecular cloud density ( 10@xmath49 @xmath50 ) , expanding at 10 km / s would be on the order of 10@xmath51 erg / s . as a comparison ,",
    "the wind luminosity of a mid - b star is around 10@xmath52 erg / s @xcite .    assuming @xmath410@xmath53 ionizing photons s@xmath7 , typical for a mid - b star and a density of 10@xmath49 @xmath50 , the strmgren radius is 0.014 pc .",
    "this is a factor 100 lower than the observed radius of the bubble ( 2.5 pc ) . assuming",
    "that the 20 observed class ii stars all emit the same number of ionizing photons and assuming a density of 100 @xmath50 , the strmgren radius would be comparable to that of the measured bubble size . additionally , the hii  will expand into the molecular material due to the higher pressure , making this the most plausible scenario .",
    "another possibility is that the ob star which created the bubble has been expelled from the center of the cluster due to a binary interaction , similar to what is suggested for the origin of bn in orion @xcite .",
    "the central star of the hii  region could be one of the stars from the disrupted binary , with the other star moving in the opposite direction . with the current data we can not exclude this scenario , detailed velocity measurements of the star in the hii region",
    "could give more insights into this scenario .",
    "the interaction region between the hii  region and the molecular cloud north of it raise the suggestion that some form of triggered star formation plays a role here .",
    "after having derived several properties of the hii  region , the molecular cloud and the adjacent bubble we can now attempt to reconstruct the way this region has formed .",
    "rcw 34 is composed of a large bubble in which intermediate- and low - mass pms stars have formed with no evidence for a central ionizing source .",
    "the ionizing source and its surrounding hii  region , however , are located at the edge of the bubble , very close to the molecular cloud .",
    "the hii  region and the molecular cloud are separated by an ionization front and a pdr traced by h@xmath1 emission and 5.8 and 8.0  emission .",
    "the age of the stars inside the bubble ( several myr ) is not known with sufficient accuracy to detect an age difference with the stars inside the hii  region ( 2 @xmath2 1 myrs ) .",
    "the age of the objects forming inside the molecular cloud , however , is most likely younger , as several tracers of active star formation have been detected .    inside the hii  region ,",
    "a north - south velocity gradient has been detected from h@xmath11 spectroscopy , resembling that of s88b , a proto - typical champagne flow @xcite .",
    "the detection of the champagne flow , as well as the presence of the ionization front and pdr in the north , suggest that the hii  region is formed at the edge of the molecular cloud . due to the lower - density in the bubble",
    ", the hii region can expand into the bubble creating the observed velocity gradient .",
    "we already can exclude one of the triggered star - formation scenarios .",
    "the collect and collapse scenario , where the star - forming clumps are formed by swept - up material is very likely not the scenario that plays a role here .",
    "firstly , only at the northern edge of the bubble is a molecular clump present , while more clumps around the bubble are expected @xcite .",
    "secondly , it is very unlikely that the energy output of a cluster of only intermediate mass stars would be enough to sweep up a dense molecular clump of more than 1000 m@xmath0 as detected in cs emission .",
    "also unlikely is that the formation of the hii  region and the o star caused both the bubble and the star formation in the molecular cloud .",
    "the difference in evolutionary stage ( class ii stars in the bubble and class 0/i stars in the molecular cloud ) is difficult to explain by the triggering due to the hii  region alone .",
    "the location of the bubble , hii  region and molecular cloud suggest a sequence of events .",
    "first , the cluster of stars formed which created the bubble .",
    "after that , the hii region formed at the border of the bubble and the larger molecular cloud ; the latter currently forming stars .",
    "the location of the hii  region with respect to the molecular cloud as well as the presence of the pdr shows that the o star is influencing the molecular cloud and probably also inducing the current star formation .",
    "the question remains whether the formation of the bubble triggered the other star - formation events .",
    "a mechanism whereby the energy output of the stars inside the bubble would be pushing a pre - existing core to collapse could be at work here .",
    "if a molecular core present at the edge of the molecular cloud were in equilibrium , a small push from the bubble could have made the core collapse and enable the formation of the ob stars .",
    "another alternative would be that the triggering mechanism is external and that a wave of star formation is propagating through the molecular cloud resulting in the formation of the different sites of star formation .    to determine which scenario is the correct one , a better age determination of the class ii sources by means of optical or near - infrared spectroscopy would be needed .",
    "a triggering scenario would result in an age difference between the stars in the bubble and the hii  region .",
    "in this paper we have presented sinfoni integral field spectroscopy of the hii  region rcw 34 as well as _",
    "spitzer_/irac imaging of the surrounding area .",
    "the results can be summarized as follows .",
    "rcw 34 consists of 3 separate regions , a large bubble outlined by _",
    "spitzer_/irac emission with an hii  region at the northern edge of the bubble and a dense molecular cloud just north of the hii  region .",
    "irac photometry of the sources inside the bubble reveals a cluster of intermediate class ii sources and shows that no ob star is located near the center of the bubble .",
    "the class 0/i objects are mostly detected towards the dense molecular cloud in the north , suggesting active star formation present in the molecular cloud .",
    "sinfoni spectroscopy of the hii  region reveals an extinction gradient from north ( a@xmath22 = 15.9 mag ) to south ( a@xmath22 = 1.5 mag ) , supportive of the champagne flow hypothesis measured in the h@xmath11 velocity profile .",
    "the region between the hii  region and the molecular cloud is identified as a pdr , where the h@xmath1 emission originates from uv fluorescence . additionally , two outflows are identified based on their h@xmath1 emission .",
    "sinfoni spectroscopy identifies the 3 brightest stars as ionizing sources of the hii  region .",
    "the main ionizing source , # 1 , is of spectral type o8.5v while the two other stars are b0.5v and b3v stars .",
    "this results in a revised distance estimate of 2.5 @xmath2 0.2 kpc for rcw34 .",
    "additionally , we detected 21 g and k stars of which two stars are foreground objects and 19 objects are pms cluster members . with a mass between 2 and 3 m@xmath8 , these objects are still contracting to the main sequence and are the precursors of the a and f stars . combining the location of those objects in a hrd with pms evolutionary models results in an age estimate of 2 @xmath2 1 myr for rcw 34 .    \\4 . in this scenario ,",
    "the cluster stars created the bubble , which then collapsed a pre - existing dense core at the edge of the molecular cloud .",
    "the resulting hii  region would encounter the density gradient at the edge of the cloud , and thus develop as a champagne flow . whether the bubble was the original trigger , or",
    "if there was some other , external trigger , can not be answered with the current data ; a detailed spectroscopic study of the bubble stars will be required .",
    "this study shows that the interaction between the young massive stars and the surrounding molecular cloud could not only lead to the destruction of the cloud , but also to the formation of a younger generation of stars . in the majority of our regions",
    "we have identified multiple generations of star formation .",
    "several papers are in preparation to discuss the remainder of the sample of 10 clusters observed with sinfoni ( e.g. wang et al , in prep , vasyunina et al . in prep . ) and more final conclusions will be presented as a final paper discussing the survey .",
