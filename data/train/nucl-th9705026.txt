    "the kn interaction for incoming momenta up to 1 gev / c is fairly weak , with typical total cross reaction values of 10 - 15 mb .",
    "it is expected then @xcite that k - nuclear interactions be well described , in terms of the free - space kn @xmath5 matrix and the nuclear density @xmath14 , by the first - order optical potential @xmath15 .",
    "however , k@xmath2 nucleus total cross section values @xcite and reaction cross section values @xcite derived from attenuation cross sections measured in transmission experiments , as well as elastic @xcite and inelastic differential cross sections @xcite and quasifree spectra @xcite , all point to a substantial departure of the order of 10 - 20% from the predictions of a simple @xmath16 potential , even when many conventional nuclear medium effects are incorporated @xcite .",
    "several nonconventional medium effects have also been proposed to remedy the failure of the first - order optical potential approach , such as nucleon swelling @xcite , or density dependent vector meson masses @xcite , or polarizing the nuclear medium by @xmath17n excitations @xcite , or meson exchange currents @xcite , but as we shall discuss in the concluding section , none of these models provides a satisfactory solution to the discrepancy .",
    "it was pointed out by friedman et al .",
    "@xcite that values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 derived from transmission measurements are not model independent . indeed a knowledge of the coulomb - nuclear interference contribution at small angles is required in order to extrapolate these measurements to zero degrees , where the total and reaction cross sections are determined .",
    "traditionally , an optical potential is assumed for the purpose of extrapolation , even though it is not guaranteed that a particularly chosen @xmath11 yields by calculation the same values of @xmath10 and @xmath9 which eventually are derived by using it throughout the extrapolation of the data . in this sense , most existing derivations of total cross sections in the literature",
    "do not satisfy the basic requirement of _ self consistency_. the question of self consistency , posed for @xmath11 , is whether or not optical potentials which are constructed empirically to fit @xmath10 and @xmath9 values derived from transmission experiments lead to the same values , within errors , when used in reanalyzing these same experiments .",
    "friedman , gal and mare @xcite have recently discussed this issue , showing that self consistency for k@xmath2 nucleus cross sections can be achieved by using a density dependent optical potential @xmath18 with i m @xmath6 depending linearly on the average density in excess of a threshold value .    in this paper",
    "we report @xmath9 and @xmath10 values for k@xmath2 interactions with @xmath3 , c , si and ca , as derived self consistently from the attenuation cross sections measured in transmission experiments @xcite at the ags , at 488 , 531 , 656 and 714 mev / c .",

    "following ref .",
    "@xcite , the interaction of k@xmath2 with nuclei is described in the present work by the klein gordon equation    @xmath19 \\psi = 0~~ ~~(\\hbar = c = 1)\\ ] ]    where @xmath20 and @xmath21 are the wave number and reduced energy respectively in the c.m .",
    "system , @xmath22 in terms of the c.m .",
    "energies for the projectile and target particles , respectively .",
    "@xmath23 is the coulomb potential due to the charge distribution of the nucleus , and @xmath24 .",
    "the simplest possible @xmath25 form for the optical potential is    @xmath26    where @xmath27 is a kinematical factor resulting from the transformation of amplitudes between the kn and the k@xmath2 nucleus c.m .",
    "systems and @xmath28 is the value of the kn scattering amplitude in the forward direction . @xmath29",
    "is the free nucleon mass , @xmath30 is the mass of the target nucleus , @xmath31 is the total projectile - nucleon energy in their c.m .",
    "system and the nuclear density distribution @xmath32 is normalized to @xmath33 , the number of nucleons in the target nucleus .",
    "it is instructive to note that , in the eikonal approximation , the probability attenuation produced by the potential ( 2 ) for the propagation law implied by using the wave equation ( [ equ : kg1 ] ) ( for @xmath34 ) is given by    @xmath35    where @xmath36 is the kn total cross section .",
    "eq.([equ : eik ] ) corresponds to a semiclassical picture of the k@xmath2 projectile propagating forward with a mean free path @xmath37 in a medium of density @xmath14 , thus justifying the use of the wave equation ( [ equ : kg1 ] ) with @xmath38 of eq.([equ : potl ] ) .",
    "other relativistic wave equations were tested for comparison in refs .",
    "@xcite and yielded cross section values practically the same within few percents as those presented here .",
    "as for our final conclusions , details do slightly change using other wave equations , but the overall picture remains unchanged .    a convenient ` macroscopic ' ( mac ) parameterization of nuclear densities is in terms of a 2- or 3- parameter fermi function or , for light nuclei , in terms of a modified harmonic oscillator density .",
    "experimental information on nuclear charge densities is often presented using these functions @xcite , and the proton densities may then be obtained by properly unfolding the finite size of the proton",
    ". such densities are adequate around the nuclear surface where the root - mean - square ( r.m.s . )",
    "radius is determined . however",
    ", such distributions can not be valid far outside the nucleus because they do not possess the correct exponential fall - off , as determined by the binding energy of the least bound particles .",
    "in that region it is more appropriate to use single - particle ( sp ) densities or densities obtained from a more realistic hartree - fock ( hf ) calculation .",
    "a convenient way for generating ` microscopic ' or sp nuclear densities is to fill the appropriate single particle levels in a woods - saxon potential ( separately for protons and neutrons ) .",
    "the radius parameter of the potential is then adjusted so that the resulting proton density distribution reproduces the r.m.s .",
    "radius of the charge distribution ( after folding in the finite size of the proton ) whilst at the same time the depth of the potential is adjusted so that the binding energy of the least bound particle is set to the corresponding separation energy , thus ensuring the correct fall - off of the density at large radii . using this method , which is obviously a simplification ,",
    "rather realistic density distributions are obtained , particularly outside the nuclear surface .",
    "the two models , namely the mac and the sp models , will be used here",
    ".    fits to the data may be made by adjusting a complex parameter @xmath39 which is related to an effective forward scattering amplitude @xmath40 as follows :    @xmath41    in ref .",
    "@xcite it was shown that very good _ self consistent _ fits to the data could be obtained if the imaginary part of @xmath39 was made density dependent according to the empirical expression :    @xmath42 \\quad,\\ ] ]    where the average nuclear density is defined as follows :    @xmath43    values of @xmath44 can be obtained from hf calculations or from the simpler sp calculations described above .",
    "results for the four nuclei of the present work are given in table [ tab : rhobar ] , where the uncertainties for c , si and ca are about 1% .",
    "it was found that the values    @xmath45    provide excellent self consistent fits at all four momenta for which transmission measurements on @xmath3 , c , si and ca were made at the ags @xcite . attempting to avoid the use of a threshold density @xmath46 in eq.([equ : teff ] ) by using powers of the average or local density @xmath32 failed to produce fits to the data .",
    "note that the value of the threshold density ( eq.([equ : beta ] ) ) is considerably larger than the average density of @xmath13li , while comfortably smaller than @xmath44 of the other target nuclei .",
    "this reflects the failure to reconcile the @xmath13li data with the data for the denser nuclei , unless the specific density dependence given by eq.([equ : teff ] ) is assumed .",
    "this density dependence , for the parameters of eq.([equ : beta ] ) , amounts to 20 - 30% enhancement , depending on the nucleus .",
    "results of the self consistent fits are given in table [ tab : fits1 ] , essentially taken from ref .",
    "@xcite . listed",
    "are values of the fitted kn effective forward scattering amplitude @xmath40 which are determined exclusively by fitting to the @xmath13li data .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .",
    "@xcite that in the present incoming momentum range , and for a kn interaction strength as weak as here encountered , using an optical potential to describe scattering off as light a nucleus as @xmath13li incurs errors of no larger than 2% . with respect to the free - space kn scattering amplitude @xmath47 ,",
    "the values listed for i m  @xmath40 show enhancement of 5 - 15% with increasing momentum , in quantitative agreement with the estimates of meson exchange currents effects @xcite .",
    "the values listed for re  @xmath40 show a considerably larger departure .",
    "the kn in - medium @xmath39 is substantially less repulsive than the free - space @xmath5 .",
    "it was pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite that such a trend might be expected partly due to the proximity of the k@xmath48n and k@xmath49 channels , but no quantitative estimates of this effect have been made .",
    "as explained above and in ref .",
    "@xcite , we have succeeded in obtaining self consistency in the analysis of transmission experiments by rescaling the imaginary part of the optical potential with the _ average _ nuclear density above a threshold value . no explanation could be given to this empirical result , but we note that with such a rescaling , which was found to be independent of beam momentum , we are able to obtain reaction and total cross sections which are consistent with the optical potential used to extract these quantities from the results of transmission measurements .",
    "table [ tab : res ] summarizes the reaction and total cross sections at the four beam momenta .",
    "the uncertainties are the same as quoted in the earlier publication @xcite , and they reflect statistical errors only .",
    "systematic uncertainties are associated mostly with the optical model input which is inherent in the analysis @xcite .",
    "these were estimated to be as large as 5 - 10% .",
    "indeed it can be seen that the results in table [ tab : res ] differ from those of ref .",
    "@xcite by about 5% , always exceeding the previous values .",
    "the modification of the conventional optical potential , which made possible the self consistent analysis and consequently led to the reasonably good fits to the data , was the introduction of rescaling of the imaginary potential with the factor @xmath50 .",
    "in addition to this peculiar behaviour of the imaginary potential it is seen from table [ tab : fits1 ] that systematic trends can be obtained from the real part of the best fit potentials .",
    "more specifically , the real part of the optical potential is found to be less repulsive than what is expected from the @xmath25 model .",
    "the loss of repulsion seems to grow with increasing momentum , and at the two highest momenta the real part of the potential is essentially consistent with zero . to study further the real part of the optical potential",
    "we introduce a phenomenological density dependence ( dd ) also into the real potential such that the real part of @xmath39 is made to depend on the nuclear density as follows :    @xmath51^\\alpha.\\ ] ]    this form of a potential was found to be quite successful in studies of dd effects in kaonic atoms @xcite and in @xmath52 atoms @xcite .",
    "it must be emphasized that this is a purely phenomenological form and that no significance is attached to e.g. the exponent @xmath53 .",
    "however , when @xmath40 is constrained to have the corresponding value @xmath28 for the free - space kn interaction and when @xmath540 , then the low density limit @xcite is respected by the real potential . using such a dd potential for the real part and using the same form , eq.([equ : teff ] ) , for the imaginary potential ( varying only i m @xmath40 ) , we performed @xmath55 fits , separately at each energy , to the reaction and total cross sections of table [ tab : res ] . in the left hand side of table [",
    "tab : fits2 ] are given the parameters of the real potential from unconstrained fits , where re @xmath40 , i m @xmath40 , re @xmath56 and @xmath53 were varied .",
    "fits of similar quality could be obtained for a wide range of values for @xmath53 and the results shown here are for @xmath57 .",
    "the errors quoted are obtained from the @xmath55 fit procedure and in this case there are strong correlations between re @xmath40 and re @xmath56 .",
    "some decrease in the values of @xmath55 compared to the corresponding values in table [ tab : fits1 ] is evident . in the right hand side of table [",
    "tab : fits2 ] are given the results of constrained fits , as explained above .",
    "this time the value of @xmath53 , which again was held fixed during the fits , was 0.5 as it gave slightly better results . in this case",
    "there are no correlation effects and the errors of re @xmath56 apply to the sum of re @xmath28 and re @xmath56 .",
    "this sum can be compared directly to the values of the density independent parameter re @xmath40 of table [ tab : fits1 ] .",
    "it is seen that the two sets of numbers agree remarkably well , thus supporting the preliminary conclusions from table [ tab : fits1 ] regarding the real part of the potential .",
    "comparing the results of the two kinds of fits in table [ tab : fits2 ] , there is a distinct difference regarding the behaviour of the real potential at large radii . whereas the constrained fit is dominated by the free - space kn interaction at large radii and consequently is repulsive at all four momenta of the present study , the unconstrained fit leads nominally to an attractive potential at large radii for 656 and 714 mev / c .",
    "a way of bypassing the problem of correlations between errors is to apply a ` notch test ' method @xcite to estimate the uncertainties in the real potential as a function of position .",
    "figure [ fig : int ] shows the real part of the optical potential for 714 mev / c k@xmath2 on carbon as obtained from the unconstrained fits , together with the errors from the notch test .",
    "obviously more data is needed in order to study the real potential .",
    "differential cross sections for the elastic scattering of k@xmath2 by @xmath13li and c are available at the highest momentum covered by the transmission measurements @xcite and it is therefore possible to include them in the optical model fits . the adequacy of the optical potential eq.([equ : potl ] ) was tested by comparing angular distributions calculated for this potential with angular distributions calculated for an equivalent potential @xcite containing an explicit p - wave term in the kn interaction .",
    "preliminary fits showed that if only differential cross sections are used , then reasonably good fits are possible but , however , the calculated reaction and total cross sections are smaller than the measured values by 30 to 50% . we have therefore used an extended input data set that included the differential cross sections for @xmath13li and c together with the eight integral cross sections for @xmath13li , c , si and ca at 714 mev / c .",
    "as with the fits to only the integral cross sections , in these combined fits we have tried three different potentials : ( i ) a @xmath58 potential ; ( ii ) an unconstrained dd potential ; ( iii ) a constrained dd potential . in all cases the imaginary part included the rescaling discussed above .",
    "the normalization of the differential data was allowed to vary too , within the quoted range of @xmath715% @xcite .",
    "the first two potentials produced good fits to the integral cross sections but only the unconstrained dd potential led , at the same time , also to a reasonably good fit to the differential data . the third potential , namely , the constrained dd potential that respects the low density limit , failed badly to reproduce simultaneously both types of data and also required an unacceptably large renormalization of the differential cross sections . in order to check the sensitivity of the results to the particular nuclear densities used in the optical potentials ,",
    "the whole procedure was followed with both mac and sp densities , as described above .",
    "the conclusions regarding the quality of the various fits remained unchanged .",
    "examples of the resulting real potentials for c are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : intdiff ] . the continuous curves are for the unconstrained dd potential and the dashed curves are for the @xmath58 potential .",
    "examples for the uncertainties , as obtained from the notch test mentioned above , are plotted for the unconstrained dd potential based on the mac densities .",
    "these should represent also the uncertainties in the other potentials which are included in the figure . also shown",
    "are the potentials obtained when the mac densities are replaced by the sp densities and it is seen that although there are differences in details , the overall picture is the same for the two models .",
    "if , in the constrained fits , the parameter @xmath53 is allowed to become negative , then better quality fits are obtained but the low density limit is no longer respected .",
    "the attractive pocket near the nuclear surface , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : intdiff ] , persists . comparing this figure with fig .",
    "[ fig : int ] it is seen that the real potential is a little better determined when the differential cross sections are included in the analysis .",
    "it is therefore concluded that the empirical potentials fail to respect the low density limit , at least within the present parameterization .",
    "it is doubtful whether a more elaborate phenomenological real potential can be meaningfully derived from the present data .",
    "the relativistic mean field ( rmf ) theory , treating nucleons as dirac particles interacting via ( large ) scalar and vector fields , proved to be a valuable tool to describe nuclear structure and dynamics @xcite .",
    "extensions of the nuclear rmf theory to include hyperons are reviewed in ref .",
    "in particular , the rmf approach has been applied to constructing the optical potential for elastic scattering of @xmath59 and @xmath60 hyperons on nuclei @xcite .",
    "therefore , the application of the rmf theory to k@xmath2  nucleus scattering seems to be a natural extension and , also , an interesting alternative to the phenomenological dd analysis .",
    "furthermore , fitting the rmf potentials to k@xmath2  nucleus scattering data has the potential of providing information on the coupling of kaons to the meson fields involved , which is relevant for studying the behaviour of kaons in nuclear matter , particularly in connection to kaon condensation , and also for determining the equation of state of strange baryonic matter present in neutron stars @xcite .    in the rmf calculations reported below we used the common lagrangian density in the nucleonic sector @xcite , with the linear parameterization of horowitz and serot @xcite . for completeness",
    ", we also utilized the nonlinear model of sharma et al .",
    "kaons were incorporated into the rmf model by using kaon - nucleon interactions motivated by one boson exchange models .",
    "the simplest relevant form of the kaon - meson lagrangian reads : @xmath61 describing the interactions of kaons ( @xmath62 ) with the scalar ( @xmath36 ) and vector ( @xmath63 and @xmath14 ) fields . as was pointed out by schaffner and mishustin @xcite",
    ", this simple form has to be extended by the additional term @xmath64 in order to satisfy in the medium the ward identity requiring coupling of the vector field to a conserved current . for isospin saturated nuclei ,",
    "the equation of motion for the kaons reduces to : @xmath65 \\psi = 0 \\;\\;\\ ; , \\ ] ] where @xmath66 denotes the time component of the isoscalar vector field @xmath63 .",
    "it should be noted that the last ( quadratic ) term corresponding to @xmath67 of eq.([equ : lv2 ] ) was omitted in the analysis of section [ sec : realpot ] .",
    "we have checked the effects of the quadratic term ( @xmath68 ) , as well as a possible extension by a term proportional to @xmath69 , and found these to be negligible .",
    "it is also possible to formulate the rmf calculations by reducing the second - order kg equation ( [ equ : emk ] ) into a kemmer - duffin - petiau set of first - order coupled equations , as was done in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the equation of motion can be expressed in the form of the kg equation ( eq.([equ : kg1 ] ) ) with the real part of the potential given by : @xmath70 where @xmath71 and @xmath72 .",
    "for the coupling constants @xmath73 and @xmath74 we used the constituent quark model values @xcite , namely @xmath75 in order to account for recoil effects we employed , following ref.@xcite , the recoil corrections given by cooper and jennings @xcite , namely , we multiplied the scalar and vector potentials by the factors @xmath76 finally we introduced extra scaling coefficients for the scalar ( @xmath77 ) and vector ( @xmath78 ) potentials to be obtained from fits to the data . using these scaling factors we aimed at tracing the energy dependence of the kaon couplings . after multiplying the s and v potentials in eq.([equ : vop1 ] ) by @xmath79 and @xmath80 , and by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , we arrive at the expression for the real part of the optical potential @xmath11 to be used as a real potential in eq.([equ : kg1 ] ) : @xmath81 the imaginary part of @xmath11 was again modified by letting i m @xmath82 ) depend linearly on the average density in excess of a threshold value ( see eq.([equ : teff ] ) ) , with the same values of parameters @xmath83 and @xmath46 as in the case of the phenomenological potentials of section ii .",
    "the fits of the rmf potentials were made by gridding on values of @xmath78 and varying the coefficient @xmath77 together with i m  @xmath40 .",
    "this procedure was chosen because of the strong correlation between @xmath77 and @xmath78 .",
    "searches stopped once reasonably low values of @xmath55 ( in our case @xmath84 ) were obtained .",
    "the results for the linear rmf parameterization @xcite obtained from fits to the integral cross sections are summarized in table [ tab : rmffits ] .",
    "it is seen that the scaling coefficients @xmath77 and @xmath78 decrease with increasing momentum , thus reducing significantly the contributions of both the scalar and vector potentials .",
    "consequently , the resulting real part of @xmath11 is essentially consistent with zero at the highest momenta .",
    "practically identical results ( within the indicated errors ) were obtained for the nonlinear rmf parameterization .",
    "when the differential cross sections are also included ( only at 714 mev / c ) , then the rmf best fits are significantly poorer than those obtained with the unconstrained dd potentials .",
    "the resulting rmf real potential does not have any attractive region , in contrast to the dd real potential .",
    "the fits based on the rmf approach thus confirm the empirical results concerning the real potential and in particular the loss of repulsion with increasing momentum .",
    "note that this is opposite to the trend of dirac - phenomenological nucleon optical potentials which become less attractive , even repulsive , with increasing energy @xcite .",
    "in the present work we have derived _ self consistently _ integral cross sections for k@xmath2-nucleus interactions from transmission experiments @xcite , updating the procedure of ref.@xcite .",
    "these reaction and total cross sections provide 32 data points for the study of medium effects in k@xmath2 nuclear interactions .",
    "it had been realized for the total cross sections data subset @xcite , and quite recently also for the reaction cross sections data subset @xcite , that the values of these integral cross sections , for the relatively dense c , si and ca nuclei , exceed substantially the predictions of the first - order optical potential @xmath85 , by up to about 25% .",

    "whereas a moderate increase of @xmath89 ( cf . the values of i m @xmath40 listed in table [ tab : fits1 ] vs. the values i m @xmath28 listed there in parentheses ) was found to satisfactorily reproduce the integral cross sections for @xmath13li , no simple extension in terms of powers of the density @xmath14 , or of the average density @xmath91 , could be found to reproduce simultaneously the integral data for the other , considerably denser nuclei .",
    "the only way found to reproduce self consistently all the integral cross sections was by introducing the density dependence of eq .",

    "it is interesting to note that for k@xmath99 nucleus scattering where the vector potential has the opposite sign , so that both @xmath100 and @xmath101 are then attractive , we would predict an attractive potential depth of about 10 mev . indeed",

    "a brief discussion of several theoretical works is in order .",
    "siegel et al .",
    "@xcite suggested that nucleon  swelling \" in the medium primarily affects the dominant @xmath108 kn phase shift by increasing it in the nuclear medium . in the momentum range 500 - 700",

    "@xcite is capable of producing the increment necessary for i m @xmath28 in order to fit the integral cross sections as function of energy , but it suggests no significant change in re @xmath28 . finally , the most recent work by caillon and labarsouque @xcite , who consider medium effects for the mesons exchanged between the k@xmath2 and the bound nucleons , produces _ both _ modifications required in order to fit the data , namely increasing i m @xmath28 and re @xmath28 simultaneously to an extent which is comparable at 700 mev / c with the values of @xmath40 shown in our table [ tab : fits1 ] .",

    "we point out two features which make it even harder for theory to explain the integral cross sections data : ( i ) the self consistent values of @xmath9 published here are always larger , by about 5% than the previous values @xcite used in some of the theoretical works ; ( ii ) there exist now @xmath10 data , published here , which indicate a similar problem for theory as the @xmath9 data do .",
    "this appears to suggest that the theoretically missing part of the cross section belongs to some in - medium major reaction channels mistreated by the @xmath25 optical model approach and its conventional , relatively minor modifications ; or that at present theory misses some nonconventional in - medium effects that would strongly invalidate the @xmath25 starting point .",
    "new inelastic data for @xmath13li and c at 635 and 715 mev / c are being reported @xcite .",
    "these inelastic excitations also require to be enhanced theoretically in order to fit the new data . even though the corresponding transition densities peak at the nuclear surface where @xmath110",
    ", one can not simply argue that these inelastic processes need not be strongly renormalized by the medium effect specified here ; ours is a _ global _ , not a local prescription , since it involves @xmath91 ; not @xmath14 . of course",
    ", more work is needed to decide whether or not these inelastic cross sections shed new light on the problem of medium effects in k@xmath2 nucleus interactions .",
