    "the interest in the topic of form factors of light nuclei is threefold :    \\1 . the wave functions of light nuclei @xmath1 can be calculated today with exact methods @xcite starting from the nucleon - nucleon interaction known from n - n scattering .",
    "electromagnetic form factors at large momentum transfer @xmath2 allow for the most quantitative test of these wave functions including their short - range properties .",
    "modern experiments provide both charge- and matter isotope shifts for many stable and unstable nuclei",
    ". the radii ( rms - radii , zemach moments ) measurable via electron scattering can provide the reference to convert shifts to absolute radii .",
    "\\3 . for the proton",
    "there is presently a major discrepancy ( @xmath3 ) between the rms - radii determined from electron scattering @xcite and electronic hydrogen @xcite versus muonic hydrogen @xcite .",
    "similar comparison for light nuclei should provide additional insight .    in this paper",
    "we briefly describe the determination of the most precise electromagnetic form factors .",
    "given the recent focus on radii , we will place particular emphasis on the determination of the various moments ; for the comparison of the form factors with modern theory we refer the reader to two review papers @xcite .",
    "of particular importance for the determination of the rms - radius @xmath4 of the nuclear charge density @xmath5  which non - relativistically is simply the fourier transform of the monopole charge form factor @xmath6  is the question concerning the range of momentum transfers @xmath2 that is relevant for the extraction of radii .",
    "while the answer `` low @xmath2 '' is the standard one , the question is rarely addressed in a quantitative fashion , with the consequence that improper weight is given to particular sets of data and new experiments aiming at a determination of r are carried out at uninteresting @xmath2 s .",
    "using a standard `` notch - test '' , we have studied this question in detail . in fig.1",
    "we show the result for the particular case of the proton . only the data @xmath7 are really sensitive to the rms - radius . at lower @xmath2 , the finite - size effect in the form factor",
    "@xmath8 is too small as compared to the uncertainties of the data , at @xmath9 the higher moments such as @xmath10 dominate . note that for nuclei , which all have rms - radii larger than the one of the proton , the maximum sensitivity occurs at correspondingly lower @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ where @xmath11 is of similar size .",
    "the first zemach moment @xcite @xmath12 , which depends on both the magnetic and the charge form factor , is needed to predict hfs in atoms .",
    "the third zemach moment @xcite @xmath13 is needed to relate the lambshift in muonic atoms to the rms - radius . for both moments ,",
    "the range of sensitivity is quite similar to the one for the rms - radius @xcite .     and @xmath14 for the proton .",
    "plotted is the change of the moment for a 1% change of the world data in a narrow region @xmath15 around a given value of @xmath2 . ]    a second  and rather recent  insight needs to be considered @xcite .",
    "the standard procedure of extrapolating @xmath16 to @xmath17 , where the rms - radius can be obtained from the slope @xmath18 , is unreliable .",
    "this extrapolation requires a parameterization of @xmath16 which is fitted to the data .",
    "simply taking a convenient form of @xmath16 can lead to the situation that the corresponding @xmath5 has an unphysical behavior at large radii @xmath19 , _",
    "e.g. _ can be large or not approach zero as we expect from our physics understanding of bound systems .",
    "such a behavior at large @xmath19 can correspond to unreasonable moments given the large weight of large @xmath19 in the moment - determining integrals . in @xmath2-space",
    "this behavior amounts to an unphysical curvature of @xmath16 which affects the ( implicit ) extrapolation from the @xmath2-region sensitive to r ( see above ) to @xmath17 where @xmath4 is extracted .",
    "the only way to avoid this problem is to make sure that the large-@xmath19 density behaves in a way that is consistent with our understanding of the physics of densities . at large @xmath19",
    ", the density of any composite system behaves like a whittaker function governed by the separation energy of the lightest charged constituent @xcite .",
    "this whittaker function ( with corrections of minor numerical impact ) can easily be calculated and used to constrain the large-@xmath19 shape of @xmath5 ; typically , this constraint can be used in the region where @xmath20 has fallen to less than 1% of its central value . imposing this constraint during a fit of the ( e , e )",
    "data is practical if parameterizations are chosen that have analytical fourier transforms so that data ( in @xmath2-space ) and constraint ( in @xmath19-space ) can be simultaneously fitted .",
    "the need for constraining the large-@xmath19 behavior becomes even more apparent once one considers the integral @xmath21 which determines @xmath4 in the limit @xmath22 . in order to get 98% of @xmath4 for _ e.g. _ the deuteron",
    ", one has to integrate out to @xmath23 !",
    "it is immediately obvious that electron scattering can not in a significant way determine the finite size contribution to the form factor at the correspondingly low @xmath2 of @xmath24 ; accordingly , a determination of @xmath4 to percent - type accuracy would be illusionary .",
    "the usual  solution  for this problem , the use of parameterized form factors , introduces an arbitrariness ( model dependence ) that can be avoided only by introducing the physics constraint as discussed above .",
    "the determination of form factors for the i=1 nucleus deuteron is complicated by the need to separate the three formfactors @xmath25 , @xmath26 and @xmath27 . charge",
    "( c+q ) and magnetic ( m ) contributions can be separated via forward- and backward - angle data at the same @xmath2 .",
    "charge monopole ( c ) and quadrupole ( q ) contributions can be separated if tensor polarization observables , @xmath28 in particular , are available . for the deuteron",
    "the data base is quite extensive , with some 450 data points in the @xmath2-region @xmath29 .",
    "a fit with the very flexible sum - of - gaussians ( sog ) parameterization @xcite of the data ( after correction for coulomb distortion @xcite ) supplemented by the large-@xmath19 tail constraint yields the form factors with error bars @xmath30 that account for both the random and the systematic errors of the data .",
    "the detailed comparison of the resulting form factors with modern theory has been discussed in @xcite .",
    "the charge rms - radius resulting from this fit is given in table 1 and compared to the _ preliminary _ value from muonic deuterium , measured by the crema collaboration @xcite , and the radius that can be derived from the accurate knowledge of the triplet n - p scattering length @xcite .",
    "we find excellent agreement within the error bar of @xmath31 of the electron scattering result .",
    "this agreement is particularly relevant with regard to the `` proton radius puzzle '' as for the proton the discrepancy between ( e , e ) and @xmath32h amounts to a significantly larger @xmath3 .",
    ".deuteron charge rms - radii .",
    "the @xmath33-value is preliminary due to potential incompleteness of the nuclear polarization correction .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < \" , ]     the reference point for all the helium radii is @xmath34he . for this nucleus",
    "the data from electron scattering is the most precise , see fig.3 . in addition , we know for this nucleus not only the _ shape _ of the large - radius density , but also the absolute value .",
    "the extensive set of proton-@xmath34he elastic scattering data has been analyzed using forward dispersion relations fdr @xcite ; the residuum of the singularity closest to the physical region , due to exchange scattering at @xmath35 , yields the asymptotic norm of the proton wave function to @xmath3610% .",
    "this knowledge helps to extract a very precise charge radius of @xmath37 @xcite .",
    "he at low @xmath2 .",
    "the data are from refs . @xcite . ]",
    "this @xmath34he charge rms - radius actually is the most precise radius for any nucleus determined by electron scattering .",
    "it therefore is particularly interesting to compare this radius to the one being determined from muonic helium @xcite .",
    "the final value from this experiment is not yet available , but it is known to be well within the error bar of @xmath38 of the radius from electron scattering .",
    "this agreement of better than @xmath39 is highly significant given the @xmath40 discrepancy between ( e , e ) and @xmath32x for the proton .",
    "this speaks strongly against a potential difference between the ",
    "interaction of electrons and muons , an idea that had been speculated about in order to explain the proton radius puzzle .",
    "for lithium electron scattering data are available for a=6,7 , the latter being less accurate and less extensive ; moreover they contain both contributions from the unresolved scattering to the first excited state of @xmath41li and a large contribution from quadrupole scattering .",
    "@xmath42li is therefore the natural reference nucleus .",
    "the @xmath42li charge form factor and rms - radius has been determined as discussed above @xcite ; the data set comprises 86 points in the range @xmath43 .",
    "a potential complication arises due to the partial @xmath44 cluster structure and the low deuteron removal energy . for this case ,",
    "the asymptotic behavior may be more complex .",
    "for the shape of the tail we have therefore used the one from the gfmc - calculation of pieper _ et al._@xcite .",
    "as this calculation corresponds to an exact solution of the schrdinger equation and reproduces the experimental binding energy , the large - r shape can be trusted . the resulting charge rms - radius amounts to @xmath45 .",
    "the comparatively large uncertainty results from the limitations in the ( e , e ) data .",
    "the charge form factor for @xmath42li agrees very well with the gfmc calculation @xcite while for the m1 form factor , which also has been measured up to @xmath46 , a small disagreement is observed at the highest @xmath2 s .",
    "isotope shifts of the charge rms - radii have been measured by nrtershuser _",
    "et al . _",
    "( for references see @xcite ) for mass number up to a=11 .",

    "these shifts have been measured at cern using laser spectroscopy with the li - nuclei stored in traps .",
    "fig.4 shows the resulting radii , together with a series of theoretical calculations discussed in detail in @xcite .",
    "the unusual behavior of the radii is related to the fact that @xmath42li and @xmath41li show pronounced effects of cluster structure while @xmath50li and @xmath49li are closer to a mean - field description .",

    "the data are from refs . @xcite . ]",
    "the matter radii of the li - isotopes have been measured at gsi @xcite .",
    "experimentally these quantities are accessible ( although with lesser precision ) by scattering of lithium nuclei , produced by fragmentation with energies of the order @xmath51/nucleon , from hydrogen ; cross sections in this energy range can be interpreted using glauber theory .",
    "the resulting data show a more or less constant matter radius throughout the series a=69 , with a 30% increase for a=11 resulting from the extremely low two - neutron separation energy of only 370@xmath52 .",
    "magnetic scattering for most nuclei is dominated by the properties of valence neutrons or protons , thus providing an observable governed by different physics .",
    "in general , magnetic form factors also receive larger contributions from meson exchange currents which , depending on the research goal , is a benefit or a complication .",
    "we have in the discussion given above placed little emphasis on these magnetic form factors .",
    "magnetic form factors are more difficult to determine as they require experiments at very large scattering angle . as a consequence ,",
    "the data base is more limited .",
    "a review paper on magnetic form factors has been published in @xcite .",
    "magnetic rms - radii are particularly difficult to determine as at low @xmath2 the contributions from charge scattering dominate the electron scattering cross sections .",
    "charge scattering can be suppressed by measurements at 180@xmath53 scattering angle ; since a number of years , however , no such 180@xmath53 facilities are available anymore .",
    "precise rms - radii from electron scattering are of interest for comparison with radii obtained from modern _ ab initio _ calculations and measurements from muonic x - ray data ; they also serve as an anchor point for the many isotope shifts now measurable for unstable nuclei . in this paper , we have used the _ world _",
    "data on electron scattering to determine accurate radii and zemach moments for @xmath0 .",
    "the uncertainties of the radii derived from ( e , e ) are between 0.5 - 1.5% .",
    "for the special case of @xmath34he , where the highest accuracy of @xmath540.25% is reached , we find good agreement with the radius from muonic helium , contrary to the case of the proton @xcite where a 4% discrepancy remains ."
