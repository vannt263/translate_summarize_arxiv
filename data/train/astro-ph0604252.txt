    "although there is a decrease in the global specific sfr with decreasing redshift , the evolution in the integrated specific sfr in massive galaxies is accelerated .",
    "the implication is that _ at @xmath0@xmath41.5 , massive galaxies are rapidly forming their stars , whereas by @xmath0@xmath81.5 the specific sfrs of massive galaxies drops rapidly , and lower  mass galaxies dominate the cosmic sfr density _ .",

    "many authors are also finding agn candidates based on rest  frame near  ir colors , where the agn is presumably heavily obscured by gas and dust so that it is missed in deep ( @xmath41  msec ) x  ray surveys ( e.g. , donley et al.2005 , stern et al .",

    "rays , up to 25% of the drg population host agn ( see also papovich et al .",
    "2006 ) .",
    "if agn contribute to the observed 24  emission in galaxies at @xmath0@xmath11.53 , then they can affect the inferred ir luminosities .",
    "for example , using an ir template for mrk  231 instead of a star  forming galaxy with @xmath13@xmath4@xmath28  would reduce the ir luminosity for @xmath0@xmath11.53 galaxies by a factor of @xmath125 . to limit this effect on the evolution of the integrated specific sfrs , the error box in figure  3 shows how the result changes if for galaxies with putative agn we set the sfr to zero .",
    "the high agn occurrence in drgs suggests that massive galaxies at @xmath0@xmath11.53 simultaneously form stars and grow supermassive black holes .",
    "however , even when agn are present it is unclear whether star ",
    "formation or the agn activity domninates the bolometric ir luminosity .",
    "although @xmath180% of sub  mm galaxies have x  ray detections ( alexander et al .",
    "2005 ) , the ir to x  ray luminosity ratios are up to an order of magnitude higher than what is expected for agn alone .",
    "this suggests that both star  formation and agn contribute to the bolometric emission .",

    "( 2003 ) find that the galaxy nucleus has a low  to [ nii ] flux ratio consistent with ionization from an agn .",
    "however ,  is spatially resolved in their spectrum and the [ nii ] line strength drops off in the off  nucleus spectrum .",
    "this implies extended star ",
    "formation beyond the nucleus , which presumably contributes to the inferred ir luminosity .",

    "in contrast , massive galaxies at @xmath0@xmath10.30.75 have specific sfrs less than the global average , and more than 10@xmath9 lower than that at @xmath0@xmath11.53 .",

    "the high agn occurrence at @xmath0@xmath1 1.53 provides evidence that massive galaxies are simultaneously forming stars and growing supermassive black holes .",
    "this may provide the impetus for the present  day black - hole  bulge - mass relation and/or provide the feedback necessary to squelch star ",
