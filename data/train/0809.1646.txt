    "detecting extraterrestrial sources of high energy ( @xmath8tev ) neutrinos is a longstanding goal of astrophysics .",
    "neutrinos are neither deflected by magnetic fields nor significantly attenuated by matter and radiation en route to earth , thus neutrino astronomy offers an undistorted view deep into the high energy universe .",
    "particularly , neutrinos offer an opportunity to probe the sources of high energy cosmic rays , which remain unknown .",
    "potential cosmic ray sources include galactic microquasars and supernova remnants as well as extragalactic sources such as active galactic nuclei and gamma ray bursts .",
    "these objects are thought to accelerate protons and nuclei in shock fronts via the fermi mechanism @xcite , resulting in power law energy spectra @xmath9 , with @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath122 .",
    "a fraction of the energized particles interact with local matter and radiation , producing pions . the neutral pions decay into high energy photons , and the charged pions ultimately produce neutrinos with a flavor ratio @xmath13:@xmath6:@xmath7 @xmath111:2:0 , mixing to approximately 1:1:1 at earth because of vacuum flavor oscillations .",
    "observations of tev gamma rays @xcite hint at possible cosmic ray source locations but currently can not separate neutral pion decay spectra from inverse compton emission .",
    "the auger collaboration has reported a correlation of arrival directions of the highest energy cosmic rays with active galactic nuclei @xcite ; however , a similar correlation has not been observed by hires @xcite .",
    "identification of a high energy neutrino point source would provide an unambiguous signature of energetic hadrons and cosmic ray acceleration .",
    "neutrino flux predictions exist for many potential sources @xcite , but no high energy neutrino point source has yet been identified @xcite .",
    "the search for high energy neutrino point sources is a major objective of the antarctic muon and neutrino detector array ( amanda ) .",
    "high energy leptons are produced in the earth by charged - current neutrino interactions . in transparent matter ,",
    "a cone of cherenkov photons propagates from the lepton track according to the optical properties of the medium .",
    "amanda - ii is an optical cherenkov detector consisting of 677 optical modules arranged in 19 strings frozen @xmath111500 m to @xmath112000 m deep in the ice sheet at the geographic south pole .",
    "approximately 540 modules in the core of the array showing stable performance are used in this search .",
    "each module contains a 20 cm diameter photomultiplier tube ( pmt ) optically coupled to an outer glass high - pressure sphere .",
    "pmt pulses are propagated to surface electronics , and , when the trigger threshold of 24 discriminator crossings (  hits \" ) within 2.5 @xmath14s is satisfied , the pulse leading edge times are recorded .",
    "the leading edge times along with known detector geometry and optical properties of south pole ice @xcite allow reconstruction of tracks passing through the detector @xcite .",
    "high energy electrons produce short electromagnetic cascades with little directional information of the primary neutrino .",
    "muons produced in the ice and bedrock , on the other hand , propagate up to several kilometers to the detector and their tracks are reconstructed with  1.5@xmath152.5@xmath15 median accuracy depending on energy and zenith angle .",
    "tau leptons decay rapidly and produce tracks too short for reconstruction below @xmath11pev energies .",
    "tau decay , however , contributes high energy muons with a branching ratio of 17.7% @xcite , and these muon tracks can be reconstructed .",
    "we thus search for upward propagating muons produced in the earth by @xmath6 ( @xmath16 ) and @xmath7 ( @xmath17 ) fluxes following roughly an @xmath0 energy spectrum .",
    "while downward neutrino induced muons also trigger the detector , such events are difficult to distinguish from downward muons produced by cosmic ray air showers .",
    "located at the south pole , amanda - ii is thus most sensitive to neutrino fluxes from the northern sky .",
    "air showers also produce neutrinos , and this atmospheric neutrino flux @xcite is the main background for our search .    here",
    "we present the results of a search for astrophysical point sources of high energy neutrinos using 3.8 years of data recorded by amanda - ii during 2000 - 2006 , extending the previous five - year analysis @xcite with data from the final two years of standalone operation and improving our sensitivity by a factor of @xmath112 .",
    "we report flux limits for a catalog of 26 selected source candidates along with results of a search for neutrino sources over the entire northern sky .",
    "additionally , we report results from a search for neutrino emission from gamma ray sources identified by milagro @xcite and a search for event angular correlations . in all cases ,",
    "we observe no indications of an astrophysical neutrino point source .",
    "as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig : zall ] , amanda - ii records @xmath18 events per year from downward propagating muons produced by cosmic ray air showers , @xmath19 events per year from atmospheric neutrinos , and @xmath20 high quality events per year from astrophysical @xmath0 neutrino fluxes given current limits @xcite .",
    "we attempt to isolate these neutrino events from the downward muon background in a computationally efficient manner .",
    "we exclude data taken during periods of detector instability and significant maintenance , which include the austral summer ( november 1 through february 15 ) . after accounting for deadtime in data acquisition electronics , nominally @xmath1115% of uptime",
    ", we have accumulated 1387 days ( 3.8 years ) of livetime with 1.29@xmath21 events during seven years of operation ( table [ tab : esel ] ) .",
    ".[tab : esel ] amanda livetime and event totals . [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     we then apply the search to declinations @xmath22 on a 0.25@xmath23 0.25@xmath15 grid . the region above declination @xmath24 is left to a dedicated search for wimp annihilation at the center of the earth @xcite . for each grid point , we similarly compute a flux limit and significance ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] ) .",
    "we find a maximum pre - trial significance of @xmath25 = 7.4@xmath210@xmath26 at @xmath27 = 54@xmath15 , @xmath10 = 11.4h .",
    "we account for the trial factor associated with the all sky search by comparing the maximum pre - trial significance to the distribution of maximum pre - trial significances obtained from sky maps randomized in right ascension .",
    "we find 95% of sky maps randomized in right ascension have a maximum significance of at least @xmath25 = 7.4@xmath210@xmath26 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : sig ] ) . sensitivity and flux limits are summarized in fig .",
    "[ fig : limits ] .    in the northern sky ,",
    "the galactic tev gamma ray sources observed by milagro @xcite are promising candidates for observation with neutrino telescopes @xcite .",
    "we improve our ability to detect a weak signal from this class of objects by @xmath28 by combining @xmath29 sources of similar strength , with less improvement if one source is much stronger than average .",
    "we include five of eight sources and source candidates observed by milagro with significance above 5@xmath30 before considering trial factors , including four regions near cygnus and one near the equator .",
    "we add a hot spot near @xmath27 = 1@xmath15 , @xmath10 = 19h @xcite , which may be associated with a large neutrino flux if confirmed as a source @xcite .",
    "we exclude the three regions with pulsar - wind nebula counterparts , c3 , c4 , and the crab nebula , which are considered weaker candidates for significant hadron acceleration @xcite .",
    "we adapt a method developed by hires @xcite to perform our maximum likelihood search simultaneously for all six source locations , resulting in the slightly modified likelihood function @xmath31 where @xmath32 is the signal probability density of the @xmath33 event evaluated for the @xmath34 source .",
    "significance is again computed by comparing the obtained test statistic value to the distribution obtained from data randomized in right ascension .",
    "we observe a small excess with a chance probability of 20% .",
    "the 90% confidence level upper limit obtained on the mean @xmath6 flux per source is 9.7 @xmath2 10@xmath35 tev @xmath4 s@xmath5 .    finally , we search for groups of neutrino sources and extended regions of neutrino emission by scanning for correlations of events at all angular distances up to 8@xmath15 .",
    "we perform the search over a range of energy thresholds , using the number of modules hit as an energy parameter . for each threshold in angular distance and number of modules",
    "hit , we count the number of event pairs in the data and compare with the distribution of pairs from data randomized in right ascension to compute significance .",
    "the highest obtained significance is @xmath25 = 0.1 with a threshold of 146 modules hit and 2.8@xmath15 angular separation , where we observe two event pairs .",
    "the probability of observing this maximum significance by chance is 99% .",
    "since four separate analyses are performed on the data , the probability of obtaining at least one significant result is increased .",
    "the most significant result obtained has a chance probability of 20% , and the binomial probability of obtaining this chance fluctuation in at least one of the four analyses is 59% and not significant .",
    "we have analyzed 3.8 years of amanda - ii data and found no evidence of high energy neutrino point sources .",
    "we place the most stringent limits to date on astrophysical point source fluxes .",
    "icecube @xcite is a next - generation neutrino telescope at the south pole scheduled for completion in 2011 with eighty 60-module strings instrumenting @xmath111 km@xmath36 of ice .",
    "analysis of data recorded during 2007 - 2008 with the first 22 strings has improved the amanda - ii sensitivity by a factor of 2 .",
    "currently 59 strings are operating , and with continued construction icecube will achieve an angular resolution of better than one degree and an order of magnitude improvement over the amanda - ii sensitivity within a few years .",
