    "a quantum system whose dynamics is of interest is often part of , or coupled to , a second system whose dynamics is irrelevant .",
    "examples include the internal quantum dynamics of a molecule in solution , a qubit imbedded in a solid , the translational motion of a single particle in a gas , the dynamics of one part of a molecule , etc .",
    "the overall dynamics of the total system is given by the hamiltonian @xmath4 where @xmath5 and @xmath6 describe , respectively , the free evolution of the system of interest ( that we henceforth refer to as the `` system '' ) and the extraneous degrees of freedom ( termed the `` bath '' ) , and @xmath7 accounts for their interaction .",
    "ideally , the system dynamics is obtained by solving the schrdinger equation for the full hamiltonian , @xmath8 , and then averaging over the bath degrees of freedom . however , more often than not , this route is intractable .",
    "hence , it is common to replace the full dynamics associated with eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) by an approximate master equation @xcite for the system density matrix , @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "this type of equation provides a description of the two effects induced by the bath on the system : population changes and coherence loss .",
    "recently , the degree of quantum coherence of a system has become increasingly important .",
    "for example , both the coherent control of molecular processes @xcite and quantum manipulations in quantum computing , quantum information and quantum cryptography @xcite , rely upon the ability to keep the coherence of a system as well as to counter the decohering effects induced by the environment .",
    "one long  standing approach to reintroduce coherence in a system that is interacting with a bath is to irradiate the system with a coherent electromagnetic field .    in this paper",
    "we provide new insights into the coherence and decoherence in a paradigmatic two  level system interacting with a decohering environment and a resonant continuous  wave ( cw ) electromagnetic field .",
    "the model that we focus upon is the standard bloch equation @xcite wherein the bath is markovian , i.e. , the coherence that is transferred to the bath is lost from the system forever .",
    "using an alternate to the standard solution to this analytic problem @xcite , we show that useful new insights emerge into the way in which the thermal bath and the external electromagnetic field interact to produce and sustain coherence in the system .",
    "specifically , we emphasize that ( a ) despite the markovian nature of the bath , coherence at long times can be retained ; ( b ) the long  time asymptotic degree of coherence in the system is intertwined with the asymptotic difference in level populations ; ( c ) the traditional population  relaxation and decoherence times , @xmath0 and @xmath1 , lose their meaning when the system is in the presence of an external field , and are replaced by a more general overall timescale ; ( d ) increasing the field strength , quantified by the rabi frequency , @xmath2 , increases the rate of decoherence rather than reducing it , as one might expect ; and ( e ) maximum asymptotic coherence is reached when the system parameters satisfy @xmath3 .",

    "for example , skinner and coworkers have shown @xcite , using a non  markovian model of a two  level system linearly and off  diagonally coupled to a harmonic quantum  mechanical bath , that @xmath1 can actually be greater than @xmath27 , with @xmath28 in the weak coupling limit . in the case of the standard bloch equation @xcite , however",

    "become highly oscillatory functions of time with decreasing amplitude about @xmath101 , and the decay rate exactly corresponds to @xmath99 .",

    "consider first the case where @xmath117 . here",
    ", the field is unable to beat out , at long time , the thermalizing effects of the bath , thus leading to zero asymptotic coherence .",
    "this happens even if the field is cw and is on for all time .",
    "the coherence dynamics on the way to the asymptotic result is of interest . as an indication of the non  intuitive nature of the associated relaxation timescales ,",

    "[ fig:1](a ) and ( b ) .",
    "a grey scale is used to indicate the magnitude of @xmath51 and @xmath50 as a function of @xmath118 and @xmath2 for an initial state comprised of population in @xmath102 . a number of interesting features can be observed .",
    "first , as noted above , the decay rate increases with increasing @xmath2 , even beyond the case of @xmath119 .",
    "further , the onset of oscillatory falloff above this value is clearly visible .",
    "the ( overall ) falloff timescale , given by @xmath120 , is in this case @xmath121 , making evident the inseparability of the meaning of @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( i.e. , one can not observe two clearly separated decay timescales in @xmath50 ) .    the alternative perspective in figs .",
    "[ fig:2](a ) and ( b ) , where @xmath51 and @xmath50 are shown as a function of @xmath122 and time for fixed @xmath123 and @xmath124 is also enlightening . in this case , the rate of decay of @xmath51 and @xmath50 are seen to fall off increasingly rapidly as @xmath1 becomes _ larger _ , until @xmath125 , ( here corresponding to log@xmath126 ) . at this point , with increasing @xmath1 , the rate of falloff slows down and oscillates ( these oscillations are better appreciated in the case of @xmath51 ) .",
    "the effect becomes increasingly exaggerated with larger @xmath0 , as is evident from fig .",
    "[ fig:3 ] , that shows log @xmath51 for @xmath127 . clearly , regarding @xmath1 as the timescale for loss of coherence makes little sense in this context .",
    "related insights , here into the reinterpretation of @xmath0 , are provided by considering , for example , populations @xmath128 , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig:4 ] . focusing on figs .",
    "[ fig:4](a ) and ( b ) , we see that in the case where the field is weak ( the solid curve for @xmath129 ) the rate of population relaxation does indeed decrease with increasing @xmath0 .",
    "however , the value of @xmath0 loses this qualitative meaning when the field strength is increased , as is evident by comparing the dashed curves and dotted curves , corresponding to stronger fields , in each of panels ( a ) and ( b ) .",
    "that is , despite the fact that @xmath0 differs in these two panels by a factor of 4000 , the populations relax at qualitatively similar rates .",
    "further , note that the increasing field strength tends to be associated with an increase in rate of the population relaxation .",
    "similarly , fig .",
    "[ fig:4](c ) shows that the rate of population relaxation depends on @xmath1 as well as @xmath0 .",
    "notice that here , effectively , the fastest relaxation is achieved for @xmath130 , i.e. , @xmath89 [ as one can also see in fig .",
    "[ fig:2](b ) ] .",
    "clearly , the presence of the field imposes less meaning to the traditional values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "additional significant effects arise when the temperature is not infinite and the asymptotic population difference , @xmath41 , is nonzero .",
    "consider , for example , the extreme case were @xmath131 , shown in figs .",
    "[ fig:5](a ) and ( b ) , for @xmath51 and @xmath50 , respectively .",
    "specifically , a comparison with figs .",
    "[ fig:1](a ) and ( b ) shows large qualitative differences at all but the highest @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , two effects are evident .",
    "first , the nonzero asymptotic value of @xmath51 , due to the nonzero @xmath41 , is clear .",
    "second , significantly , both @xmath51 and @xmath50 are seen to show regions of @xmath2 where the function decays to the incoherent limit ( zero in the case of @xmath51 ; one  half in the case of @xmath50 ) , but then reestablishes coherence to reach a long time value that contains coherence .",
    "this is clear , for example , in the case of @xmath51 for @xmath2 between approximately 2.1 and 5.4 .",
    "similar results are seen for @xmath50 for a range of @xmath2 between 2.4 and 5.7 .",
    "hence , it would be misleading to suggest that decay to the incoherent limit implies no reestablishment of coherence .",
    "for example , for @xmath132 , the system undergoes a coherence revival for a time interval @xmath133 , and for @xmath134 the revival takes place at @xmath135 and the coherence remains permanently .",
    "both of the above effects weaken with decreasing @xmath41 .",
    "finally , fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] stresses the fact that the maximum amount of asymptotic coherence depends on the three parameters defining the system evolution .",
    "thus , given @xmath0 and @xmath1 , the value of the frequency for which one has maximum asymptotic coherence is @xmath136 [ see fig .  [ fig:6](b ) ] , which leads to @xmath137 .",
    "in particular , for the values used in fig .",
    "[ fig:6 ] , @xmath138 .",
    "aspects of the ubiquitous optical bloch equations have been examined with a particular focus on the coherence of the system . the qualitative view that populations relax with rates of @xmath139 , and coherences relax with rates @xmath140",
