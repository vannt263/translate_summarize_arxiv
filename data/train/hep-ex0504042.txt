    "the origin of cp - symmetry violation ( where c is a charge conjugation and p is a spatial inversion ) is of a great interest since its discovery in the decay of neutral k - mesons about 40 years ago .",
    "cp violation leads in turn to the violation of the time reversal symmetry ( t ) through the cpt invariance ( cpt - theorem ) .",
    "existence of nonzero neutron edm requires violation of both p and t invariance .",
    "different theories of cp violation give widely varying predictions for a neutron edm ( see for instance @xcite ) . therefore , the new experimental limits on the edm value would be of great importance for understanding the nature of the cp violation as well as of the universe baryon asymmetry , which are beyond the standard model .",
    "the most precision method of the edm measurement now is the magnetic resonance one @xcite e@xmath6 cm at the 90% confidence level @xcite . ] using the ultracold neutrons ( ucn method ) .",
    "here we shall discuss another possible way for the neutron edm search , using laue diffraction of the cold neutrons in the noncentrosymmetric crystal @xcite .",
    "earlier @xcite we have shown that the neutron , moving through a noncentrosymmetric crystal , may be influenced with a strong interplanar electric field .",
    "its value depends on direction and value of a neutron wave vector , reaching a maximum ( up to @xmath0 v / cm ) , when the bragg condition for some system of crystallographic planes is satisfied .",
    "these fields result in new polarization phenomena observable in neutron diffraction and optics . in particular , the schwinger interaction of the neutron magnetic moment with such fields leads to spin dependence of the neutron pendellsung picture @xcite .",
    "the pendellsung phase shift accompanying the spin flip was measured first in ref .",
    "@xcite , and so the interplanar electric field was determined in the experiment on dynamical laue diffraction of polarized neutrons for the ( 110)-plane of the @xmath4-quartz crystal .",
    "experimental value of the field was obtained to be equal @xmath7  v / cm and had coincided with the theoretical one .",
    "the interplanar electric fields are more than four orders of magnitude higher than those used in the ucn methods @xcite of the neutron edm search .",
    "so it was a natural idea @xcite ( arisen anew after shull and nathans @xcite ) to use these crystal fields for searching the neutron edm ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , the value of the crystal field turned out to be still insufficient to reach the sensitivity of the ucn method , but it was shown @xcite that use of laue diffraction for edm measurements with the bragg angles close to @xmath8 would essentially increase the time , the neutron spends in crystal under the strong electric field .",
    "two variants of the method , using the laue diffraction of polarized neutrons in the crystals without a centre of symmetry , were proposed for this purpose .",
    "one of them is the double crystal variant @xcite based on a spin dependence of the pendellsung picture phase and the second is the polarization method @xcite using the depolarization effect for neutrons diffracting in the noncentrosymmetric crystals .",
    "it was shown @xcite that the sensitivity of the method to measure the neutron edm may be increased more than by an order of magnitude by a choice of bragg angles close to @xmath1 , so it may exceed ( with the higher luminosity taken into account ) the sensitivity of the ucn method @xcite .",
    "that is possible for laue diffraction scheme only .",
    "but only the experimental study of these effects can answer the question on actual sensitivity of the method to measure the neutron edm .",
    "a hypothetical idea to use the interplanar electric fields ( if they did exist ) for the neutron edm search was discussed in the review @xcite .",
    "but such crystal properties were not known at that time .    the importance to consider the crystal noncentrosymmetricity",
    "was previously pointed out in ref .",
    "authors @xcite were the first who paid attention to an existence of the interference between the electric and nuclear structure amplitudes for neutrons diffracted by noncentrosymmetric crystal and proposed to study the schwinger interaction using such crystals .    in the work @xcite the effect of neutron spin rotation due to such interference",
    "has been discussed . similar , but more detailed theory of neutron optical activity and dichroism for diffraction in noncentrosymmetric crystals has been developed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "it has been shown @xcite that the spin rotation effect in a non - absorbing crystal can take place only for bragg scheme of diffraction .",
    "the deviation from the bragg condition by about the bragg width is necessary in this case to observe the effect for the transmitted beam . that reduces the effect , because it is proportional to @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the parameter of angular deviation ( measured in the units of bragg halfwidth ) from the bragg direction , see  @xcite .",
    "the nuclear absorption is necessary to have a spin rotation effect in the case of laue diffraction @xcite .",
    "the possibility of a search for neutron edm by measuring a spin rotation angle was analyzed for the bragg diffraction scheme @xcite and for the laue scheme @xcite .",
    "we have shown @xcite that for some system of crystallographic planes in noncentrosymmetric crystals the positions of the electric potential maxima can be shifted relative to those of a nuclear potential . hence , the diffracted neutrons will move in the crystal under a strong ( @xmath11  v / cm ) interplanar electric field ( because of the neutron concentration on the nuclear potential maxima or between them ) .",
    "such a concept turned out to be very fruitful for further consideration and understanding the different phenomena , concerning the neutron diffraction and the optics in noncentrosymmetric crystals @xcite .",
    "for example it allowed to predict and to give a simple description of such new effects as the spin dependence of the pendulum phase , the depolarization of the diffracting neutron beams , the independence of the effects due to the schwinger interaction on the neutron wavelength and bragg angle for given crystallographic planes etc . @xcite .",
    "we should note also , that the bragg reflection of neutrons from the neutron - absorbing centrosymmetric crystal of cds was used earlier @xcite for edm search .",
    "but the sensitivity of this method is much lower than that of ucn - method , because the depth of neutron penetration into the crystal , which determines a time the neutron stay in crystal , was very small ( about 7@xmath12  cm ) .",
    "now a new variant of the method is proposed and developed , using the multiple reflections from the silicon centrosymmetric crystal @xcite .    in the work",
    "@xcite it was reported that the effect of the neutron spin rotation has been observed due to the spin - orbit ( schwinger ) interaction , using the bragg scheme of the diffraction in the noncentrosymmetric crystal with a small deviation of a neutron momentum direction ( by about a few bragg width ) from the bragg one , because the effect disappears for the exact bragg direction in this case . however , the experimental value of the spin rotation angle @xcite turned out to be a few times less than the theoretical one .",
    "authors were in difficulty to explain the origin of such discrepancy , but it was very likely due to imperfection of the used crystal .    here",
    "we consider neutron - optic effects for neutrons , moving through a noncentrosymmetric crystal with the energies and the directions far from the bragg ones , when the deviation from the exact bragg condition reaches @xmath13 bragg widths .",
    "the theoretical estimations have shown @xcite , that for the polar noncentrosymmetric crystal ( @xmath14 , for instance ) the value of a resultant electric field , acting on a neutron , can reach @xmath15 v / cm for wide range ( about four orders exceeding the bragg width ) of the neutron directions and wavelengths .",
    "such a field is a result of superposition of the fields from a few different crystallographic planes .",
    "therefore , the spin rotation effects may be not too small in neutron optics in comparison with the diffraction case .",
    "the observation of such effects may be of interest for development of new methods for searching the neutron edm .",
    "it also may be useful for experimental searching the t - odd part of the nuclear interaction , using neutrons with energy close to the p - resonance one @xcite , because it is hardly possible to observe dynamical diffraction in a large crystal for neutrons with the energy @xmath16  ev because of too high requirements to a crystal quality .",
    "the phenomenon can be used also for measurements of the interplanar electric fields affecting the neutrons in the crystals without centre of symmetry .",
    "a new specific spin neutronography arises in this case for crystallographic planes with nonzero electric fields .",
    "as it follows from the dynamical diffraction theory , a movement of a neutron through the crystal in a direction close to the bragg one for some system of crystallographic planes can be described by two kinds of bloch waves @xmath17 and @xmath18 ( see for example , @xcite ) , formed as a result of neutron interaction with the periodic nuclear potential @xcite @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is a reciprocal lattice vector describing the system of crystallographic planes , @xmath21 , @xmath22 is an interplanar spacing , @xmath23 is the average nuclear potential of the crystal ,    @xmath24    @xmath25    where @xmath26 , @xmath27 , @xmath28 ; @xmath29 .",
