    "charmonium spectroscopy has become a challenging topic in hadron physics and qcd , because of the recent findings of possible new charmonium states ( for recent experimental and theoretical reviews and discussions , see e.g. @xcite and references therein ) . among others , for the puzzling state x(3872 ) , possible assignments of e.g. the @xmath8 and @xmath9 charmonium states and the charm - molecule",
    "have been suggested ( see , e.g.@xcite for a comprehensive review ) , and it will be helpful to search for those states in other experiments and to clarify these assignments ; the measured mass splitting between @xmath10 and @xmath11 is about 50 mev , which is smaller than some theoretical predictions , and it is certainly useful to search for the @xmath12 to see what will be the mass splitting between the @xmath13 , which could be the observed @xmath14 , and the @xmath12 .",
    "this may be particularly interesting since according to some potential model calculations the @xmath12 could lie above 4040  mev ( see , e.g. in @xcite the mass of @xmath12 is predicted to be 4060  mev ) . and the @xmath13 mass could actually be lowered by coupling to the nearby @xmath15 decay channels ( note that the energy level spacing between @xmath16 and @xmath17 is smaller than that between @xmath18 and @xmath16 , which is in contradiction with potential model calculations unless the coupled channel effects are considered or the assignments for @xmath16 and @xmath18 are incorrect",
    ". the mass spectrum of excited charmonium states will certainly provide important information on interquark forces and color confinement .",
    "in addition , studies of the decay and production of these states will also be very important in understanding the underlying theory of strong interaction perturbative and nonperturbative qcd in view of many outstanding puzzles in charmonium physics .",
    "@xmath2 meson decays have proven to be very useful processes to find new charmonium states . aside from the @xmath2 meson decay , @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath1 gev",
    "could also be a very useful process in finding the excited charmonium states , since the recent belle experiments @xcite have found unusually strong signals for the double charmonuim production from the @xmath0 continuum , e.g. , @xmath19 , @xmath20 and @xmath21 , @xmath22 .",
    "theoretically , the calculated cross sections for these processes based on the leading order non - relativistic qcd(nrqcd ) ( or more generally perturbative qcd ( pqcd ) ) are about an order of magnitude smaller than the experiments @xcite .",
    "this is a big issue in charmonium physics and nrqcd , and it still remains to be further clarified though many considerations are suggested to understand the large production rates in both exclusive and inclusive charmonium production via double charm pairs in @xmath0 annihilation @xcite ( the theoretical predictions for the inclusive @xmath23 production cross section with the color - singlet @xcite as well as color - octet@xcite contributions are also much smaller than the belle data ) . despite of these disagreements , however , we find that the calculated relative rates of the double charmonium production processes are roughly compatible with the belle data ( e.g. the production cross sections of @xmath24 , @xmath11 , and @xmath25 associated with @xmath26 and @xmath10 are much larger than that of @xmath27 and @xmath28 ) .",
    "so , we may use the same method as in our previous work to calculate the production rates for the excited charmonium states in @xmath0 annihilation into double charmonia , but mainly pay attention to the relative rates for these production processes .",
    "we hope the calculation will make sense in predicting the relative production rates for those excited charmonium states , and can be tested by experiments",
    ". this will be useful not only in the search for those excited charmonium states , but also in understanding the production mechanism itself .",
    "if the predicted relative production rates turn out to be consistent with experiments , it is likely that the nrqcd factorization treatment for these processes probably still makes sense and only an overall enhancement factor is needed and should be clarified in further theoretical considerations ( including qcd radiative corrections , relativistic corrections , and other nonperturbative qcd effects ) . in the last section",
    "we will have a discussion on recent developments in this regard . in the following",
    ", we will calculate the leading order production cross sections for various excited charmonium states in @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath1 gev in the same way as in @xcite .",
    "following the nrqcd factorization formalism@xcite , the scattering amplitude of double charmonia production can be described as @xmath29 where @xmath30  , @xmath31  ,   @xmath32  ,  @xmath33  ,   @xmath34 and @xmath35 are respectively the color - su(3 ) , spin - su(2 ) , and angular momentum clebsch - gordon coefficients for @xmath36 pairs projecting out appropriate bound states .",
    "@xmath37 is the scattering amplitude for double @xmath36 production and @xmath38 is the derivative of the amplitude with respect to the relative momentum between the quark and anti - quark in the bound state .",
    "the coefficients @xmath39 and @xmath40 can be related to the radial wave function of the bound states or its derivative with respect to the relative spacing as @xmath41 we introduce the spin projection operators @xmath42 as@xcite @xmath43 expanding @xmath44 in terms of the relative momentum @xmath45 , we get the projection operators and their derivatives , which will be used in our calculation , as follows @xmath46    @xmath47    @xmath48    @xmath49.\\ ] ]    we then get the following expressions and numerical results for various processes of double charmonium production in @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath1 gev . in the calculation of the short distance coefficients ,",
    "the quark and anti - quark are all on mass shell , and the meson masses are taken to be @xmath50 .",
    "the input parameters are @xmath51 ( corresponding to @xmath52 and @xmath53=338  mev ) , and the wave functions at the origin are taken from a potential model calculation ( see the qcd ( bt(buchmller - tye ) ) model in ref.@xcite ) : @xmath54 , @xmath55 , @xmath56 , @xmath57 , @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "in the two s - wave ( ns and ms ) case , the cross section for @xmath61 is given by @xmath62 where @xmath63 is the scattering angle between @xmath64 and @xmath65 , @xmath66 is as follows @xmath67 here the mandelstam variables are defined as @xmath68 @xmath69 @xmath70    the cross sections for the double s - wave charmonium production are listed as follows    @xmath71)=5.5[3.6 , 3.1]~\\rm{fb},\\ ] ]    @xmath72)=3.6[2.3 , 2.0]~\\rm{fb},\\ ] ]    where the values in the brackets are the cross sections respectively for @xmath11 and @xmath12 with recoiling @xmath73 mesons .      in the one spin - triplet s - wave ( ns ) and one spin - triplet p - wave ( mp ) case",

(",
    "1922 ) , we see that the cross sections for the excited @xmath87 states @xmath88 are somewhat larger than that for the corresponding @xmath89 states @xmath90 in the nonrelativistic limit .",
    "this numerical result is due to the fact that we have chosen the first derivative of the wave function at the origin for the @xmath87 states to be larger than that for the @xmath89 states , and actually the former could be slightly smaller than the latter , depending on the potentials that are used ( see the values in the qcd ( bt ) model and other models in ref.@xcite ) .",
    "furthermore , another important effect comes from the relativistic corrections , which may lower the cross sections for the @xmath88 states .",
    "e.g. , if we take the charm quark mass to be @xmath91 for the 2p states , then the cross sections will be substantially lower . despite of these uncertainties , we expect that the cross sections for the @xmath87 states should be comparable to that for the @xmath89 states .      to search for the spin singlet p - wave charmonium @xmath7 is certainly interesting .",
    "recently , cleo has found evidence for @xmath7 in the @xmath93 decay followed by @xmath94 with a mass of @xmath95 and hyperfine splitting of about 1.0 mev measured in both the @xmath24 exclusive and inclusive analysis@xcite .",

    "in this paper , we make predictions for various double charmonia production processes in @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath1 gev with @xmath2 factories , based on a complete leading order calculation including both qcd and qed contributions . in particular , we aim at searching for excited charmonium states in these processes . from the obtained results we make the following observations :    the calculated relative production rates for @xmath173 , @xmath174 are roughly compatible with the new belle measurements @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , assuming the decay branching ratios into charged tracks are comparable for @xmath175 and @xmath176 .",
    "the calculated relative production rates for @xmath177 and @xmath178 are large , and these two states may be observable in the mass range @xmath179  gev and @xmath180  gev respectively ( see , e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "both of them are above the ozi ( okubo - zweig - iizuka ) allowed thresholds , but unlike the @xmath181 , the @xmath12 can not decay to @xmath182 pair , which may distinguish between these two states experimentally .",
    "the calculated relative production rate for @xmath183 is not zero .",
    "this differs from the result given in @xcite , but agrees with @xcite .",
    "hence the @xmath7 might be observable via this channel with high statistics in the future . aside from this process",
    ", @xmath184 is also very hopeful in finding the @xmath7 meson , since the @xmath27 has a large branching ratio ( larger than 30% ) decaying into @xmath185 , and the @xmath26 can be easily detected by the @xmath186 signal .",
    "moreover , the calculated cross section for @xmath187 is about 1.0  fb , not very small and much larger than that for @xmath188 and @xmath189 production rates .",
    "we show the differential cross sections ( the angular distribution functions ) for different double charmonium production processes in table i ( not including qed contribution ) and table ii ( including both qcd and qed contributions ) , and the corresponding graphs in fig .  1 - 7 , and fig .  8",
    ". as a whole",
    ", our results agree with those in @xcite and @xcite ( also agree with our previous result for @xmath190@xcite ) , if using the same parameters . for the qed part , in @xcite",
    "only two dominant diagrams are taken into account , while in this paper all diagrams are considered , but the numerical contributions of the remaining four diagrams are small . however , there still exists a difference in the result for the @xmath191 production . as for numerical results , since we use a larger value of the strong coupling constant @xmath192 ( corresponding to @xmath193 and @xmath194=338  mev ) than that in @xcite , our predicted cross sections are in general larger than that in @xcite .",
    "moreover , we use the charmonium wave functions and their derivatives at the origin ( including the ground state and excited states ) from the bt potential model calculation@xcite but not from the experimental values of leptonic decay widths , etc .",
    ", as in @xcite , and this may further enlarge our predicted cross sections .",
    "these parameters may not be the best choice , but , at present , since we do not have enough available data for higher excited charmonium states , using the potential model calculation may still be a reasonable and tentative choice .",
    "we view these as theoretical uncertainties in our approach for the leading order calculations .",
    "as emphasized above , this paper aims at searching for excited charmonium states in @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath1 gev with @xmath2 factories .",
    "after the main part of the results were presented in @xcite ( with a more complete leading order calculation including both qcd and qed contributions for various double charmonium production processes being added in its present form ) , a number of new experimental and theoretical results have appeared recently .",
    "the double charmonium production in @xmath0 annihilation at b factories has been confirmed by the babar collaboration ( see ref.@xcite ) with comparable cross sections to that observed by belle .",
    "theoretically , the large gap between experiment and theory could be largely narrowed by the next to leading order qcd radiative corrections  @xcite and relativistic corrections ( see , refs.@xcite and references therein ) in the framework of nonrelativistic qcd , and other possible approaches ( see , e.g.@xcite ) .",
    "belle has observed the x(3940 ) , a new charmonium state or charmonium - like state , in @xmath195 with @xmath196@xcite . while its main decay mode is @xmath197 , no signal is found for @xmath198 .",
    "this rules out the possibility of x(3940 ) being the @xmath181 state .",
    "furthermore , the x(3940 ) is unlikely to be the @xmath199 state , since no signal for the @xmath200 is found .",
    "this is in line with our calculation , which shows that the cross section for @xmath201 is much smaller than @xmath202 .",
    "finally , the x(3940 ) could be the @xmath12 state . according to our calculation ( see eq.(13 ) ) , the production cross sections for @xmath203 are respectively 5.5 ,  3.6  , 3.1  fb , and the relative rates are roughly consistent with the signal yields @xmath204 events for @xmath205@xcite .",
    "this might be viewed as a support to interpreting the x(3940 ) as the @xmath12 .",
    "however , the remaining problem is how to understand its low mass of x(3940 ) if it is the @xmath12 , which is lower than potential model predictions by 50 - 120  mev . but this could be explained by the coupled channel effects that the coupling of @xmath12 to the @xmath206 and @xmath207 charmed meson pair ( in s - wave ) will lower the mass of @xmath12@xcite .",
    "belle has not observed the x(3872 ) in @xmath208 .",
    "this implies that the x(3872 ) is unlikely to be a conventional @xmath209 or @xmath210 charmonium , since in our calculation they may have relatively large rates to be observed in double charmonium production . on the other hand",
    ", a @xmath211 or @xmath212 charmonium could be possible for x(3872 ) , since they have relatively small production rates .",
    "of course , the nature of x(3872 ) needs clarifying by other more relevant experiments ( see , e.g. @xcite ) , aside from the @xmath0 annihilation processes .",
    "belle has very recently observed a new state , the x(4160 ) , in the process of double charm production @xmath213 followed by @xmath214@xcite .",
    "possible interpretations for the x(4160 ) are discussed in@xcite with emphasized possible assignments of @xmath215 charmonium states and related problems .    in conclusion , we find that the double charmonium production processes in @xmath0 annihilation at @xmath2 factories are very useful tools in searching for excited charmonium states or charmonium - like states . the leading order nrqcd calculation might hopefully provide a useful guide for the relative production rates , but not the absolute rates themselves . a systematical study for the qcd radiative corrections and relativistic corrections for different processes",
    "are apparently needed . on the other hand , studies of charmonium spectroscopy including charmonium masses ,",
    "decays , and coupled channel effects , and the new type charmonium - like states are also very desirable .",
