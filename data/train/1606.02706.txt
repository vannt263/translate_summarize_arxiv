    "wolf - rayet ( wr ) galaxies are a subset of emission - line and galaxies whose integrated optical spectra exhibit broad emission line features ( @xmath14686 , @xmath15808 , etc . :",
    "allen et al .",
    "1976 ; osterbrock & cohen 1982 ; conti 1991 ) , originating in the stellar winds of wr stars .",
    "the line strengths of the wr features indicate a substantial population ( @xmath2 - @xmath3 ) of wr stars in these galaxies ( e.g. , kunth & sargent 1981 ; kunth & schild 1986 ) . the most massive o - type stars ( m @xmath4 25 m@xmath5 for solar metallicity ) become wr stars after 2 to 5 myr from their birth , spending only a short time ( t@xmath6 0.5 myr ) in this phase ( meynet & maeder 2005 ) , before ending through supernova explosions .",
    "the wr stars are short - lived massive stars , therefore , their presence in a large number is a strong indicator of a young ( @xmath710 myr ) ongoing star - burst in a galaxy ( e.g. , schaerer et al .",
    "the wr galaxies , therefore , offer an unique opportunity to study the onset of star formation as well as the conditions , which may be responsible for triggering star - formation in galaxies ( schaerer & vacca 1998 ) . wr galaxies are quite rare in the nearby universe as the wr phase is a very short - lived stage .",
    "the first identification of the wr features in a galaxy was in the blue compact dwarf galaxy he 2 - 10 ( allen et al .",
    "conti ( 1991 ) compiled a wr galaxy catalogue having 37 objects .",
    "later , schaerer et al . ( 1999 ) made a catalogue of 139 wr galaxies .",
    "the most recent catalogue of wr galaxies is compiled by brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2008 ) using the @xmath8 data .",
    "it lists 570 wr galaxies and a further 1115 suspected wr galaxies .",
    "gil de paz et al .",
    "( 2003 ) presented @xmath9 , @xmath10 and images of a total of 114 nearby blue compact dwarf ( bcd ) galaxies , many of those were identified as wr galaxies with high star formation rates .",
    "the star - formation is considered a fundamental parameter for evolution of galaxies . the star - formation in a galaxy",
    "is measured in terms of star formation rate ( sfr ) .",
    "the sfr is estimated from the number of lyman continuum photons ( @xmath11 ) , which are emitted mainly by the young massive stars .",
    "the @xmath11 can be measured from the continuum flux in far ultraviolet ( fuv ) or blue wave - bands ( e.g. , gallagher et al .",
    "1984 ; bell & kennicutt 2001 ; salim et al .",
    "2007 ; murphy et al . 2011 ) , far - infrared ( fir , e.g. , kennicutt et al . 1987 ; misiriotis et al . 2004 ; calzetti et al . 2010 ) wave - bands or radio wave - bands ( e.g. , condon 1992 ; cram et al .",
    "1998 ; garn et al . 2009 ; murphy et al . 2011 ) .",
    "the optical line emissions such as @xmath16563 and [ ] @xmath13727 ( e.g. , kennicutt & kent 1983 ; gallego et al .",
    "1995 ; young et al . 1996 ; moustakas et al .",
    "2006 ; prabhu 2012 ) from ionized gas also provide an estimate for sfr in galaxies .",
    "the emission directly provides an estimate of the ionizing flux from the young massive stars , and is amongst the strongest optical emission lines in star forming galaxies .",
    "the emission flux is less sensitive to dust extinction and metallicity compared to the [ ] line . other indicators such as x - ray continuum ( e.g. , ranalli et al .",
    "2003 ; mineo et al .",
    "2011 ) and mid - infrared pah ( polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon ) emission ( e.g. , roussel 2001 ; calzetti et al . 2007 ; calzetti 2011 ) can also be used to get an estimate for sfr in galaxies .",
    "these sfr indicators often predict different values of sfr due to various uncertainties arising from extinction correction , stellar evolution models , magnetic field strengths , diffusion and re - processing time scales of stellar continuum photons in galaxies ( calzetti 2013 ) .",
    "the fuv continuum emission from the young and massive stars can be sensitive to star formation events over the time scales of a few tens of myr .",
    "the diffuse synchrotron radio emission tracing its origin in loss of energy from relativistic cosmic electrons accelerated in supernovae events and diffused out to kilo - parsec scales is sensitive to star formation events typically during the last 100 myr .",
    "the emission line , on the other hand , provides information on the most recent ( @xmath1210  myr ) star formation in galaxies ( kennicutt 1998a ; murphy et al .",
    "2011 ) . in case of star formation taking place in highly dust - obscured regions , accuracy of extinction correction becomes very important in getting sfr estimates from the fuv and optical bands .",
    "although , the radio emission is not affected by dust , uncertainties on strength of magnetic field and contamination due to active galactic nuclei ( agn ) may make radio flux a relatively less reliable estimator for the sfr in galaxies .",
    "investigations on correlations between different sfr tracers are important to understand various physical processes in the interstellar medium ( ism )",
    ". such correlations also help in constraining sfrs in galaxies . due to very recent star formation episode in wr galaxies",
    ", the star formation age may have subtle effects on the observable fluxes at different wavebands , and hence on sfr correlations .",
    "such effects have not been studied very well over a large range of sfr values in wr galaxies . in a study of 20 wr galaxies , lpez - snchez ( 2010 ) found that sfr derived from the photometry of wr galaxies yield statistically significant correlations with other tracers such as fuv , fir , x - ray and radio continuum .",
    "the star formation trigger in wr galaxies is also important to understand .",
    "several studies on normal star - forming galaxies indicate that gravitational tidal interactions and mergers of galaxies play a major role in galaxy evolution and triggering star formation in galaxies ( larson & tinsely 1978 ; koribalski 1996 ; kennicutt 1998b ; nikolic et al . 2004 ;",
    "joseph & wright 1985 ; solomon & sage 1988 ; sanders & mirabel 1996 ; genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; omar & dwarakanath 2005 ) .",
    "the hierarchical growth models of galaxies support the formation of larger structures like giant spiral and massive elliptical galaxies through mergers and accretion of smaller structures like dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , shlosman 2013 ; amorisco et al .",
    "2014 ; deason et al .",
    "2014 ) , implying that tidal interactions should be fairly common .",
    "a causal link between star formation and mergers or interactions has been seen in several blue compact dwarf galaxies ( e.g. , bravo - alfaro et al .",
    "2004 ; bekki 2008 ; lpez - snchez et al . 2012",
    "; ashley 2014 ) .",
    "the tidal interactions between galaxies can be traced in several ways .",
    "the morphological features such as tidal tails and plumes detected in the -line images or in the optical images are a clear sign of interaction .",
    "such tidal features are more easily detectable in the -line compared to the optical images ( lpez - snchez 2010 ; lpez - snchez et al .",
    "2012 ; lelli et al .",
    "2014 ; mcquinn et al .",
    "the mergers can be detected in the optical bands through identification of multiple nuclei and arcs like features .",
    "significant differences in the chemical composition of different star - forming regions within the same galaxy is also a sign of interaction ( e.g. , lpez - snchez et al .",
    "2004a,2004b,2006 ; lpez - snchez & esteban 2009 ; lpez - snchez 2010 ) .",
    "due to interaction induced star formation , the nuclei or arcs can be easily detected in the line imaging .",
    "a misalignment between the disk and the stellar disk can also be an indicator of interaction as seen in the wr dwarf galaxy mrk  996 ( jaiswal & omar 2013 ) .",
    "the interaction features in galaxies can also be traced by studying kinematics of the ionized gas or neutral gas ( e.g. , lpez - snchez et al . 2004a,2004b,2006 ; lpez - snchez & esteban 2009 ; lpez - snchez 2010 ) .",
    "despite the importance of studying interactions in wr galaxies , very few detailed studies of wr galaxies have been carried out .",
    "mndez & esteban ( 2000 ) performed deep optical imaging and spectroscopy on a sample of wr galaxies , and found that the star - bursts triggered in low mass wr galaxies could be due to interactions with dwarf galaxies .",
    "lpez - snchez & esteban ( 2008 , 2009 , 2010a , 2010b ) and lpez - snchez ( 2010 ) found that majority of galaxies in a sample of 20 wr galaxies were clearly interacting or merging with low luminosity dwarfs objects or intergalactic clouds .",
    "it is suggested by these authors that interacting or merging nature of wr galaxies can be detected only when both deep , high - resolution images and spectroscopy data are available , because the interaction features are often faint .",
    "karthick et al .",
    "( 2014 ) recently studied properties of star - forming regions in a sample of seven wr galaxies through their broad - band and narrow - band photometry along with low - resolution optical spectroscopy .",
    "they constrained the age of the most recent star - formation events as 3 - 6 myr .",
    "four galaxies in their sample also show clear interaction features .",
    "there are only a few other studies where tidal interactions were inferred in individual wr galaxies ( e.g. , esteban & mndez 1999 ; mndez & esteban 1999 ; mndez et al .",
    "1999a , 1999b ; jaiswal & omar 2013 ) .",
    "there is clearly a need to expand these studies to a larger number of wr galaxies .",
    "the and @xmath13-band images of 25 wr galaxies are presented here .",
    "a total of 23 out of 25 wr galaxies in the present sample were selected from sdss , which provides broad - band photometry and spectroscopic data in the visible range of the electromagnetic spectrum ( see , abazajian et al . 2009 and the references therein ) .",
    "since the sdss spectrum has been obtained using a fiber slit of @xmath14 diameter and galaxy sizes of wr galaxies are several arc - min in our sample , total sfr can not be reliably derived from the sdss spectroscopic data alone .",
    "the narrow - band photometry maps full extent of galaxies , and therefore , provides total sfr .",
    "the flux calculated from the photometric observations needs to be corrected for contaminations by other emission lines in the filter passbands apart from the galactic and internal extinction corrections .",
    "these corrections need a knowledge of the physical conditions in the ism , and hence require spectroscopic data .",
    "the corrections to the flux were estimated in this paper primarily using the sdss spectroscopic data .",
    "we have combined our sample of 25 wr galaxies with the database on 20 wr galaxies from lpez - snchez ( 2010 ) making the total sample size up to 45 galaxies .",
    "the h@xmath15-derived sfr estimates are compared with those estimated from the fuv , fir and radio continuum luminosities from the archival data .",
    "the radio - fir correlation is also constructed using the archival data from _ iras ( infrared astronomical satellite ) _ at fir wavelengths , and the _ first ( faint images of the radio sky at twenty - cm ) _ and the _ nvss ( nrao vla sky survey ) _ images at 1.4  ghz taken with the very large array ( vla ) .",
    "the and sdss images were used to investigate interaction features in wr galaxies .",
    "the wr features are found in nearly all morphological types of galaxies , ranging from low - mass dwarf galaxies and irregular galaxies to massive spirals , luminous mergers , infrared luminous galaxies and seyfert galaxies ( ho et al .",
    "1995 ; heckman & leitherer 1997 ; zhang et al . 2007 ) .",
    "we used the catalogs of wr galaxies prepared by schaerer et al .",
    "( 1999 ) and brinchmann et al .",
    "( 2008 ) to construct a sample .",
    "we selected galaxies up to @xmath1225 mpc distance ( with @xmath16 ) , so that galaxies can be observed with the filters available on the telescopes used .",
    "we further restricted our sample with the declination @xmath17 , so that galaxies can be observed for sufficient integration time from the telescopes .",
    "we finally selected a total of 25 galaxies to carry out this study .",
    "the selected galaxies are brighter than 17 mag in the sdss @xmath13-band , except ngc  2799 and um  3111 whose sdss @xmath13 magnitudes are 18.6 and 17.8 respectively .",

    "the pass - band transmittance curves for the filters used are shown in figure  [ filters ] . the total integration time was divided into @xmath1225 frames of durations between 5 and 10 minutes .",
    "the total integration time in the band was typically between 100 and 200 minutes while that in the @xmath13 band was typically between 10 and 30 minutes .",
    "at least one standard spectrophotometric star selected from oke ( 1990 ) was observed a few times at different airmass values every night .",
    "the standard star was used to obtain the photometric calibration and the atmospheric extinction parameters .",
    "we also carried out spectroscopic observations of two galaxies , namely kug  1013 + 381 and i  sz  59 , in our sample using the 2-meter himalayan chandra telescope ( hct ) , hanle which is operated by the indian institute of astrophysics ( iia ) , bangalore , india .",
    "the details of the spectroscopy observations will be presented elsewhere . here , the results from these spectroscopy observations are used to apply the internal reddening corrections to the flux for these two galaxies .",
    "the ccd images were cleaned following the standard procedures of bias subtraction and flat - fielding using the ccdproc task of iraf ( image reduction and analysis facility ) software developed by _ national optical astronomy observatory ( noao)_. the dark currents in the ccds used are negligible and hence no dark subtraction was applied .",
    "the cosmic rays were removed interactively using the iraf tasks cosmicrays and credit within the crutil package .",
    "the observed frames for a galaxy were aligned using the iraf tasks geomap and geotran . as the image frames were taken at different values of airmass",
    ", the images were corrected for the atmospheric extinction before combining the aligned frames .",
    "the noise weighted mean of these frames was estimated to get the combined frame for a particular filter .",
    "the weighting factor multiplied to each frame was @xmath40 , where @xmath37 is the background sky rms for the frame .      the emission - line flux measured by the narrow - band filter includes both the line flux and the continuum flux .",
    "this continuum emission is dominated by stars in the galaxy .",
    "it is therefore necessary to subtract the continuum in order to estimate the emission - line flux .",
    "the underlying continuum in the filter was subtracted using the standard procedure given by waller ( 1990 ) and spector et al .",
    "( 2012 ) . in this method , the underlying continuum emission is estimated from the nearest wide - band such as @xmath13-band filter , which is significantly wider compared to the narrow band .",
    "the main assumption here is that the galaxy continuum flux per unit wavelength does not differ much across the narrow - band and the wide - band filters .",
    "the continuum emission in the wide - band filter is scaled to that in the narrow - band filter by using a scaling factor , called the wide to narrow continuum ratio ( wncr ) , defined as the ratio of the continuum count rate in the wide - band filter to the continuum count rate in the narrow - band filter .",
    "the count rates are determined using unsaturated , non - variable , isolated field stars in the wide and narrow band images . here , it is important that the field stars should not have any strong emission or absorption line within the wide - band and narrow - band filters .",
    "the average wncr for each set of the and @xmath13-band filters is given in table  [ cal ] .",
    "the wncr value is used to scale down the @xmath13-band image so that the counts per second of field stars in the @xmath13-band and the h@xmath15-band are almost identical .",
    "the continuum subtracted images were obtained by subtracting the scaled @xmath13-band images from the h@xmath15-band images .",
    "after continuum subtraction , all field stars should normally be completely removed from the image . however , in practice , some residual emission may be seen at the locations of bright stars due to imperfections in the assumptions made and some variations in the seeing conditions during the observations .",
    "our observations in the and @xmath13-bands were always taken during the same night , which minimized effects due to extreme variations in inter - night seeing and in most of the cases , the continuum subtraction process worked very well . only in a few frames ,",
    "some residual continuum emission was visible at locations of very bright stars in the frame .",
    "the typical error in the estimates of wncr values is 5% .",
    "the images were registered for the equatorial coordinates in the j2000 epoch using the _ two micron all sky survey _ ( 2mass ) or sdss @xmath13-band images of the same region . in this process ,",
    "the world coordinate system ( wcs ) solutions are calculated using the pixel coordinates of a set of stars in the target frame and the wcs coordinates of the same stars in the reference frame using the iraf task ccmap . on applying the wcs solutions on the target frames ,",
    "the astrometric uncertainty is found to be less than @xmath36 .",
    "the same astrometric calibration was applied to the continuum subtracted image .",
    "these and @xmath13-band images were made in publishable format using igi ( interactive graphics interpreter ) package of stsdas in iraf .      in order to obtain integrated flux , the polygon aperture photometry was performed on the continuum subtracted images using the iraf task polyphot .",
    "the size of the aperture was selected such that it included all the star - forming regions as well as diffuse emission from the galaxy .",
    "we have not attempted here to measure flux for individual star forming regions and diffuse emission separately .",
    "the average sky background value per pixel was measured close to the galaxy .",
    "the flux was calibrated using observations of spectrophotometric standard stars taken at different values of airmass .",
    "the atmospheric extinction was estimated from the observations of these standard stars . the flux ( counts  s@xmath25 ) of the standard star was estimated using the daophot package in iraf .",
    "the expected flux ( erg  s@xmath25@xmath41 ) of the standard star was calculated by integrating the product of the calibrated spectrum of standard star and the filter transmission curve with respect to the wavelength .",
    "the instrumental response was obtained by dividing the expected flux ( erg  s@xmath25@xmath41 ) of the standard star with its observed flux ( counts  s@xmath25 ) at zero airmass .",
    "the instrumental responses for the combinations of telescopes and filters are given in table  [ cal ] .",
    "the calibrated flux for a galaxy was estimated by multiplying its observed flux with the instrumental response .",
    "the flux needs to be further corrected for an attenuation in the filter transmission due to the shift in the emitted wavelength of the emission line at the redshift of the galaxy .",
    "the narrow - band filters normally have maximum transmission at the rest frame wavelength of the emission .",
    "the narrow - band filter response curve is also dependent on the focal ratio of the telescope and requires a correction .",
    "the effect of the telescope focal ratio is important only for the 1.3-meter dfot , since the filters are placed here in the fast ( f/4 ) converging beam .",
    "both of these corrections were estimated in jaiswal & omar ( 2013 ) and were applied here .",
    "the calibrated flux was corrected for line contaminations in the filter passbands , the galactic extinction and the internal extinction .",
    "the narrowband ( h@xmath15 ) filters contain significant flux from [ ]  @xmath426548,6584 lines .",
    "the wide - band ( @xmath13 ) filter , in addition , will contain significant flux from [ ]  @xmath16300 , [ ]  @xmath16548 , [ ]  @xmath16584 , [ ]  @xmath16717 and [ ]  @xmath16731 emission lines apart from the @xmath16563 line .",
    "it should be noted that the line is a contaminating line in the @xmath13 band for estimating continuum flux .",
    "the line flux should be corrected for these line contaminations .",
    "the fluxes of the emission lines contaminating the filter passbands were estimated from the sdss spectroscopic data .",
    "it is assumed here that the line ratios are constant everywhere in the galaxy .",
    "the galactic ( foreground ) extinction correction was determined using @xmath43 values based on schlafly & finkbeiner ( 2011 ) recalibration of the schlegel , finkbeiner & davis ( 1998 ) extinction map .",
    "these values were taken directly from ned .",
    "assuming an intrinsic case - b recombination ratio of 2.86 ( osterbrock 1989 ) for h@xmath15/h@xmath44 ratio , valid for an ionized gas with an electron temperature of 10@xmath45k and an electron density of 100  @xmath46 ) , and the cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) extinction curve with @xmath47 , the internal reddening of the ionized gas can be expressed in terms of the observed h@xmath15/h@xmath44 flux ratio ( corrected for the galactic extinction ) as :    @xmath48    the values of @xmath43 and @xmath49 for each galaxy are listed in table  [ archive ] .",
    "the @xmath50 values can be changed into the extinction coefficients at the wavelength using the cardelli , clayton & mathis ( 1989 ) extinction curve with @xmath47 as : @xmath51 .",
    "the h@xmath15 and h@xmath44 fluxes for several galaxies are taken from the mpa - jhu ( max - planck - institute for astrophysics and johns hopkins university ) emission line analysis database for the sdss data release-7 ( dr7 ) , which were already corrected for the foreground extinction using odonnell ( 1994 ) extinction law .",
    "therefore , the @xmath50 value calculated using these line fluxes will only provide the internal extinction without a contribution from foreground extinction due to the milky - way .",
    "therefore , we applied the foreground reddening corrections separately for those galaxies , for which mpa - jhu databases were used .",
    "the ratio for the galaxies mrk  475 , ugca  116 and ugca  130 were taken from the literature .",

    "the accuracy of flux estimates from the narrow - band imaging depends on the accurate removal of the underlying continuum .",
    "the error in wncr gives main contribution to the total error ( spector et al .",
    "we used @xmath52 foreground stars to calculate the wncr value .",
    "the residual flux at the locations of bright field stars after subtraction of the scaled continuum is similar to error in wncr ( below 5% ) , the errors in continuum subtraction for galaxies can be fixed at this value . in some cases ( um  311 , ngc  941 , ngc  1087 and ugca  130 ) , flat - fielding was not perfect and a large - scale residual gradient was seen in the cleaned images . however , we always estimated local sky background around galaxies , in order to minimize effects of improper flat - fielding on flux estimates .",
    "these effects are expected to be insignificant compared to other errors . in addition to the wncr error , there will be some additional sources of observational errors arising from uncertainties in the estimates of instrumental response , narrow - band filter transmission curve and atmospheric extinction .",
    "it is difficult to make an exact estimate for errors in the flux in individual cases .",
    "we believe that typical errors in flux corrections remain below 10% .",
    "the final errors in the flux estimates are typically between 10% and 20% .",

    "the most recent single burst dominated by wr region may often be representing the total star formation .",

    "the fir luminosity depends also on the dust content and its distribution relative to star forming regions .",
    "the calibration for fir luminosity to sfr is largely based on large galaxies where older stars also contribute significantly to the heating of dust .",
    "we speculate that in low sfr range , star - light spectral energy distribution ( sed ) plays a more deciding role for 60 @xmath28 m and 100 @xmath28 m fluxes .",
    "a total ( bolometric ) infrared luminosity may give better estimates for sfr ( calzetti 2013 ) .",

    "the non - thermal radio continuum emission is expected to last for longer duration , nearly 100 myr after the initial starburst , compared to the emission .",
    "the episodic star - bursts separated by a few tens of myr in a galaxy will further complicate a comparison between these tracers of sfr .",
    "there is a possibility that young supernovae responsible for accelerating cosmic electrons to the relativistic speeds are lacking in the very young starbursts in wr galaxies .",

    "therefore , this hint of correlation between ` r ' and sfr(fuv)/sfr(h@xmath15 ) supports our initial observation that majority of wr galaxies are lacking non - thermal radio flux .",

    "the slope for the sfr(radio ) versus sfr(fir ) is @xmath121.3 .",
    "the @xmath91 values are falling within the scatter seen for normal galaxies .",
    "however , we notice a possible trend that galaxies at low fir or low sfr end , are showing higher value of @xmath91 .",
    "these trends can again be understood as a general deficiency of non - thermal radio flux in wr galaxies as discussed in the previous section .",
    "it is worth to point out that some wr galaxies such as mrk  996 ( jaiswal & omar 2013 ) , and several galaxies in lpez - snchez ( 2010 ) sample show n / o enrichment .",
    "the n / o enrichment is expected to take place in young ( wr ) star - burst regions , where nitrogen is enriching the ism through the stellar winds , however , similar oxygen enrichment expected from supernovae explosions is lacking ( kobulnicky et al . 1997 ; putilnik et al .",
    "2004 ; brinchmann et al .",
    "2008 ; lpez - snchez & esteban et al .",
    "although , magnetic field strengths in dwarf galaxies are not known very well , a few radio polarimetric observations of dwarf galaxies reveal presence of magnetic fields in these systems .",
    "( chyy et al . 2000 ; gaensler et al . 2005 ; chyy et al . 2011 ; beck & wielebinski 2013 ; drzazga et al .",
    "our analysis indicates that radio deficiency in several wr galaxies is mainly due to lack of supernovae events .",
    "the optical morphologies of wr galaxies in our sample are studied using the sdss and images .",
    "the color composite sdss images reveal presence of blue star - forming disks in spiral galaxies .",
    "most of the galaxies show very bright distinct blue regions .",
    "the fiber - based sdss spectrum were taken mainly on these bright blue regions , which showed wr features .",
    "the emission corresponding to the blue regions is detected in all the galaxies .",
    "the and optical @xmath13-band morphologies of all galaxies in the sample were visually checked for signatures of tidal interactions .",
    "lpez - snchez ( 2010 ) identified high occurrence of interaction related morphological features ( plume , tails , merger and tidal dwarf galaxies ) , kinematical disturbances , and differences in chemical compositions of regions in their sample of wr galaxies .",
    "the presence of multiple nuclei , arcs and tidal tails are generally considered as a signature of recent or ongoing tidal interaction ( e.g. , beck & kovo 1999 ; lpez - snchez et al .",
    "2004a ; matsui",
    "et al . 2012 ; adamo et al . 2012 ) .",
    "a summary of the prominent morphological features seen in wr galaxies in our sample is provided in table  [ morphology ] .",
    "the interaction probability in this table is inferred based on various morphological features .",
    "galaxies showing or optical tidal tails and distinct multiple nuclei with a disturbed optical envelope are termed as highly probable .",
    "galaxies showing lopsidedness or asymmetric light distribution along with any other feature such as probable multiple nuclei or arcs are termed as moderately probable .",
    "galaxies without any significant disturbed optical morphology are labeled with low interaction probability .",
    "it should be noted that several galaxies termed as having low probability show some interaction features such as bar , mild lopsidedness , or nuclear star formation .",
    "however , in absence of any strong tidal feature , we preferred to label these objects with low interaction probability .    in our sample , we find that 5 galaxies show prominent tidal tails or cometary shapes , 7 galaxies have bars , and 7 galaxies have two or three bright dominating regions suspected as multiple nuclei .",
    "the star formation dominated in the nuclear region is seen in 8 galaxies .",
    "in addition , two galaxies show presence of extra - planner regions .",
    "one galaxy has misaligned bar with respect to the optical bar .",
    "a large number of 16 galaxies show lopsidedness ( stellar light distribution or star formation ) or irregular morphologies in our sample .",
    "three galaxies show lopsided or disturbed radio continuum emission .",
    "two galaxies are known to have disturbed morphologies .",
    "it is not clear if multiple bright dominating regions are just different regions or multiple nuclei of different galaxies such as other low mass dwarf galaxies in a merger stage .",
    "kinematical and chemical abundance measurements will be useful to distinguish these two scenarios .",
    "the lopsidedness in galaxies has been studied previously in other galaxies , and is believed to be caused by tidal interactions ( e.g. , jog 1997 ; zaritsky & rix 1997 ; angiras et al . 2006 ) .",
    "the stellar bars can also result from recent tidal interaction events ( e.g. , barnes & hernquist 1991 ; miwa & noguchi 1998 ) .",
    "the dwarf systems in our sample often show intense nuclear star - burst consistent with previous results ( e.g. , strickland & stevens 1999 ; adamo et al .",
    "it has been seen in n - body simulations ( e.g. , hernquist & mihos 1995 ) that tidal interaction and mergers between galaxies can channel gas towards the center of galaxy as a result of loss of angular momentum .",
    "this gas can give rise to nuclear starburst in galaxies ( mihos & hernquist 1994 ) . the optical morphological features seen in our study are also highly suggestive of prevalence of tidal interactions and mergers in the wr galaxies .",
    "a total of 16 galaxies are inferred here to be tidally interacting .",
    "these results are consistent with the results based on previous studies on wr galaxies , where tidal interactions were inferred in several wr galaxies ( mndez & esteban 1999 ; lpez - snchez & esteban 2008 ; jaiswal & omar 2013 ; karthick et al .",
    "all these results suggest that about two - third of wr galaxies show signatures of tidal interactions or mergers",
    ". it will be valuable to study environment of the wr galaxies , in terms of local density and velocity dispersion of galaxies in the surrounding region to probe tidal interactions .",
    "the gmrt ( giant meterwave radio telescope ) -line observations have been completed in 20 galaxies from our sample .",
    "these observations will help in understanding tidal interactions in these galaxies to greater depths .",
    "twenty - five wolf - rayet galaxies were imaged in the emission - line and @xmath13-band using 1.3-meter and 2-meter optical telescopes .",
    "these galaxies were selected from the sdss with the distance cutoff at @xmath1225 mpc .",
    "majority of the selected galaxies in our sample are of small - size ( @xmath94 kpc ) or dwarf galaxies .",
    "the sensitivity obtained in our observations is typically @xmath95 .",
    "the integrated fluxes were corrected for internal and galactic extinction , and also for the line contaminations in the and @xmath13 passbands .",
    "the star formation rates were derived for all the galaxies using h@xmath15 , fuv , fir and radio luminosities . the archival data in the fuv , fir and 1.4 ghz radio bands were taken from galex , iras and vla surveys ( first and nvss ) .",
    "we combined our sample with the sample of 20 wr galaxies studied by lpez - snchez ( 2010 ) .",
    "these two samples are complimentary to each other in the sense that our sample is dominated by galaxies with sfr @xmath81 while majority of galaxies in the lpez - snchez ( 2010 ) sample has higher sfr values .",
    "the sfrs estimated from the luminosities in different wavebands were compared with the based sfr .",
    "the based sfr are found well correlated with other sfrs .",
    "we noticed , in general , that scatter in the correlations is higher towards the low sfr range .",
    "all the slopes in correlation with the sfr deviate from the unity .",
    "the highest deviation is seen with radio sfrs and the smallest deviation is with fuv based sfrs .",
    "these deviations and scatter are expected to be resulting mainly from uncertainties in the calibration constants for sfr - luminosity relations , star formation histories , age of the most recent star - burst , and assumptions about various physical processes in the ism .",
    "these results are consistent , in general , with other similar studies .",
    "the radio - fir correlation further reveals that majority of wr galaxies towards low sfr range are radio deficient , most likely due to lack of supernovae events in the young star - bursts in the wr galaxies .",
    "this result is also supported by n / o enrichment seen in several wr galaxies .",
    "the optical morphologies reveal presence of active star formation , wide - spread in the disks of spiral galaxies in our sample .",
    "all wr galaxies are dominated by a distinct region of very blue star forming region , coincident with the wr features detected in sdss .",
    "several small - size and dwarf galaxies in our sample show multiple emission region .",
    "it is not obvious if these multiple regions are just regions or nuclei of separate dwarf galaxies in the merger state .",
    "several galaxies in our sample show tidal features and lopsidedness in their stellar light distribution .",
    "bars and nuclear star - bursts are also seen in a few galaxies .",
    "the morphologies of a total of 16 galaxies are inferred here to be suggestive of tidally interacting . in general , our study reveals tidal interactions as the prime reason for star formation trigger in wr galaxies , consistent with previous studies on wr galaxies ( mndez & esteban 2000 ; lpez - snchez & esteban 2008 ; lpez - snchez 2010 ) .",
    "overall about two - thirds of wr galaxies in different samples show some signatures of tidal interactions or mergers .",
    "further studies using the data presented in this paper are being carried out , in order to understand various sfr tracers in more details with an emphasis to effects of very young star - burst in wr galaxies .",
    "the -line observations on 20 wr galaxies have been completed and will be used to understand tidal interaction process in greater details .",
    "studies using long - slit optical spectroscopy are also planned to estimate chemical abundances in different emitting regions in order to reveal details of tidal interactions in these galaxies .",

    "a brief overview of methods used to convert luminosities at different wavelengths to sfr is provided here .",
    "the ultraviolet ( uv ) radiation is emitted by the most massive stars with their surface temperatures in the range of @xmath96  k. the radiation shortward of the lyman continuum ( @xmath97 ) is almost completely absorbed by the surrounding interstellar medium ( ism ) .",
    "however , the radiation longward of this limit ( @xmath98 ) can escape the ism and provides an estimate for the total uv radiation from the massive stars .",
    "the fuv ( 1344 - 1786  @xmath54 ) band continuum emission can therefore be used to measure sfr in galaxies ( e.g. , salim et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "the fuv flux density is estimated here from the galex data .",
    "this flux density is corrected for foreground and internal extinctions .",
    "the galex fuv luminosity is converted to sfr using the relation given by kennicutt ( 1998a ) :        the absorbed fuv radiation shortward of the lyman continuum limit ionizes the ism , which in turn emits nebular emission lines .",
    "the strengths of nebular emission lines are directly proportional to the impinging fuv flux .",
    "the nebular lines therefore can provide an indirect measurement of the fuv flux from the most massive stars and hence in turn an estimate for the sfr . the line ( @xmath100 ) , being the strongest among the nebular emission lines from regions , is widely used to trace recent star formation in galaxies ( e.g. , kennicutt 1998a ) .",
    "the sfr@xmath101 is estimated here from the luminosity using the relation given kennicutt ( 1998b ) :        the fuv radiation also heats the dust in the ism .",
    "the dust emits thermal radiation in the far infrared bands ( @xmath103 m : devereux & young 1990 ; devereux & hameed 1997 ) .",
    "the fir emission therefore also indirectly traces the star formation rates in galaxies .",
    "the iras data provides the @xmath104 m and @xmath105 m flux densities , which can be converted into total fir luminosity using the relations described in yun et al .",
    "( 2001 ) :        where @xmath108 is the distance in mpc and @xmath109 and @xmath110 are flux densities at @xmath111 and @xmath112 , respectively in units of jy .",
    "the sfr@xmath113 can be then estimated using the relation given by kennicutt ( 1998b ) :        the most massive stars ( @xmath115 ) end their life in supernovae explosions within about 30 myr of their formation .",
    "these powerful explosions accelerate cosmic electrons to relativistic speeds .",
    "these electrons in presence of galactic magnetic field emit synchrotron ( non - thermal ) radiation .",
    "this radiation follows a power law in frequency where spectral power at low frequencies is higher than that at higher frequencies .",
    "the nvss and first are the two very sensitive radio surveys carried out at 1.4  ghz using the vla .",
    "most of the understanding on radio emission from nearby galaxies is due to these radio surveys .",
    "the 1.4 ghz radio emission from normal star forming galaxies is dominated by the synchrotron emission .",
    "the free - free thermal emission from star forming regions also contributes at a level of @xmath1210% to the total radio emission at 1.4 ghz . in absence of any contamination to the radio flux from active galactic nuclei ( agn ) , the radio flux can be used to estimate the rate of star formation in galaxies .",
    "a comprehensive review on the radio emission from galaxies can be found in condon ( 1992 ) .",
    "the radio synchrotron emission traces star formation over longer duration @xmath12100 myr , i.e. , typical lifetimes of relativistic cosmic electrons in galaxies .",
