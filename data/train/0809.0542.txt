    "one of the most amazing phenomena in quantum many - particle systems is the formation of quantum condensates . at present , the formation of condensates is of particular interest in strongly coupled fermion systems in which the crossover from bardeen - cooper - schrieffer ( bcs ) pairing to bose - einstein condensation ( bec ) may be investigated . among very different quantum systems such as the electron - hole - exciton system in excited semiconductors , atoms in traps at extremely low temperatures , etc .",
    ", nuclear matter is especially well suited for the study of correlation effects in a quantum liquid .    neutron matter , nuclear matter , but also finite nuclei are superfluid .",
    "however , at low density , nuclear matter will not cluster into pairs , i.e. deuterons but rather into @xmath0 -particles which are much more stable .",
    "also heavier clusters , starting with carbon , may be of importance but are presently not considered for condensation phenomena . therefore , one may ask the question whether there exists quartetting , i.e. @xmath0-particle condensation , in nuclei , analogous to nuclear pairing . the only nucleus which in its ground state has a pronounced @xmath0 -cluster structure is @xmath7be . in section 4",
    "we will show a figure of @xmath7be in the laboratory frame and in the intrinsic deformed frame .",
    "we will see that @xmath7be is formed out of two @xmath0-particles roughly 4 fm apart , only mildly interpenetrating one another .",
    "actually @xmath7be is slightly unstable and the two @xmath0 s only hold together via the coulomb barrier . because of the large distance of the two @xmath0-particles , the 0@xmath8 ground state of @xmath7be has , in the laboratory frame , a spherical density distribution whose average is very low : about 1/3 of ordinary saturation density @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath7be is , therefore , a very large object with an rms radius of about 3.7 fm to be compared with the nuclear systematics of @xmath10 = 2.44 fm .",
    "definitely @xmath7be is a rather unusual and , in its kind , unique nucleus .",
    "one may ask the question what happens when one brings a third @xmath0-particle alongside of @xmath7be . we know",
    "the answer : the 3-@xmath0 system collapses to the ground state of @xmath2c which is much denser than @xmath7be and can not accommodate with its small radius of 2.4 fm three more or less free @xmath0-particles barely touching one another .",
    "one nevertheless may ask the question whether the dilute three @xmath0 configuration @xmath7be-@xmath0 , or rather @xmath0-@xmath0-@xmath0 , may not form an isomeric or excited state of @xmath2c .",
    "that such a state indeed exists will be one of the main subjects of our considerations .",
    "once one accepts the idea of the existence of an @xmath0-gas state in @xmath2c , there is no reason why equivalent states at low density should not also exist in heavier @xmath3-nuclei , like @xmath4o , @xmath5ne , etc .",
    "the possible existence of a loosely bound 4@xmath0 state in @xmath4o will be another topic of our presentation . in a mean field picture ,",
    "i.e. all @xmath0 s being ideal bosons ( in this context remember that the first excited state of an @xmath0-particle is at @xmath11 20 mev , by factors higher than in all other nuclei ) , all @xmath0 s will occupy the lowest @xmath12-state , i.e. they will condense .",
    "this forms , of course , not a macroscopic condensate but it can be understood in the same sense as we know that nuclei are superfluid because of the presence of a finite number of cooper pairs . on the other hand , for example during the cooling process of compact stars @xcite , where one predicts the presence of @xmath0-particles @xcite , a real macroscopic phase of condensed @xmath0 s may be formed . in the present contribution we will mainly concentrate on nuclear systems but we also can think about the possibility of quartetting in other fermi - systems .",
    "one should , however , keep in mind that a pre - requisite for its existence is , as in nuclear physics , that there are four different types of fermions .",
    "for example to form quartets with cold atoms one could try to trap fermions in four different magnetic substates , a task which eventually seems possible @xcite . also theoretical works in this direction",
    "have appeared in the mean while @xcite .",
    "the fact that the @xmath0-particle condensates in nuclei do not form the ground state , may give raise to questions . in this respect",
    ", one should note that bose condensates of cold atoms in traps also are not in their ground state which is a solid .",
    "it is a question of time scales .",

    "we will investigate how the binding energy of various nuclear clusters change with density . in section 3",
    "we study the critical temperature of @xmath0-particle condensation in infinite matter via an in - medium four - nucleon equation ( thouless criterion ) and in section 4 we treat @xmath0-particle condensation in finite nuclei . in section 5",

    "the onset of pair condensation is achieved when the binding energy @xmath20 coincides with @xmath21 .",

    "the effective wave equation has been solved using separable potentials for @xmath18 by integration .",
    "for @xmath28 we can use a _ faddeev approach _",

    "[ shifts ] we show the shift of the binding energy of the light clusters ( @xmath29 and @xmath0 ) in symmetric nuclear matter as a function of density for temperature @xmath30 = 10 mev .    it is found that the cluster binding energy decreases with increasing density . finally , at the _ mott density _ @xmath31 the bound state is dissolved .",
    "the clusters are not present at higher densities , merging into the nucleonic medium . for a given cluster type characterized by @xmath32",
    ", we can also introduce the mott momentum @xmath33 in terms of the ambient temperature @xmath30 and nucleon density @xmath34 , such that the bound states exist only for @xmath35 .",
    "we do not present an example here , but it is intuitively clear that a cluster with high c.o.m .",
    "momentum with respect to the medium is less affected by the pauli principle than a cluster at rest .",
    "in general , it is necessary to take into account of _ all bosonic clusters _ to gain a complete picture of the onset of superfluidity . as is well known , the deuteron is weakly bound as compared to other nuclei .",
    "higher @xmath13-clusters can arise that are more stable . in this section",
    ", we will consider the formation of @xmath0-particles , which are of special importance because of their large binding energy per nucleon ( @xmath36 mev ) .",
    "we will not include tritons or helions , which are fermions and not so tightly bound .",
    "moreover , we will not consider nuclei in the iron region , which have even larger binding energy per nucleon than the @xmath0-particle and thus constitute , in principle , the dominant component at low temperatures and densities .",
    "however , the latter are complex structures of many particles and are strongly affected by the medium as the density increases for given temperature , so that they are assumed not to be of relevance in the density region considered here .",
    "the in - medium wave equation for the four - nucleon problem has been solved using the faddeev - yakubovski technique , with the inclusion of pauli blocking .",
    "the binding energy of an @xmath0-like cluster with zero c.o.m .",
    "momentum vanishes at around @xmath37 , where @xmath38 nucleons / fm@xmath24 denotes the saturation density of isospin - symmetric nuclear matter , see fig .",
    "[ shifts ] .",
    "thus , the four - body bound states make no significant contribution to the composition of the system above this density . given the medium - modified bound - state energy @xmath40",
    ", the bound - state contribution to the eos is @xmath41^{-1}\\,.\\ ] ] we will not include the contribution of the excited states or that of scattering states . because of the large specific binding energy of the @xmath0 particle , low - density nuclear matter is predominantly composed of @xmath0 particles .",
    "this observation underlies the concept of @xmath0 matter and its relevance to diverse nuclear phenomena .    as exemplified by eq .",
    "( [ ewe ] ) , the effect of the medium on the properties of an @xmath0 particle in mean - field approximation ( i.e. , for an uncorrelated medium ) is produced by the hartree - fock self - energy shift and pauli blocking .",
    "the shift of the @xmath0-like bound state has been calculated using perturbation theory @xcite as well as by solution of the faddeev - yakubovski equation @xcite .",
    "it is found that the bound states of clusters @xmath42 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 with @xmath45 are already dissolved at a mott density @xmath46 , see fig .",
    "[ shifts ] .",
    "since bose condensation only is of relevance for @xmath42 and @xmath0 , and the fraction of @xmath42 , @xmath43 and @xmath44 becomes low compared with that of @xmath0 with increasing density , we can neglect the contribution of them to an equation of state .",
    "consequently , if we further neglect the contribution of the four - particle scattering phase shifts in the different channels , we can now construct an equation of state @xmath47 such that @xmath0-particles determine the behavior of symmetric nuclear matter at densities below @xmath48 and temperatures below the binding energy per nucleon of the @xmath0-particle .",
    "the formation of deuteron clusters alone gives an incorrect description because the deuteron binding energy is small , and the abundance of @xmath42-clusters is small compared with that of @xmath0-clusters . in the low density region of the phase diagram",
    ", @xmath0-matter emerges as an adequate model for describing the nuclear - matter equation of state .    with increasing density , the medium modifications  especially pauli blocking  will lead to a deviation of the critical temperature @xmath49 from that of an ideal bose gas of @xmath0-particles ( the analogous situation holds for deuteron clusters , i.e. , in the isospin - singlet channel ) .",
    "symmetric nuclear matter is characterized by the equality of the proton and neutron chemical potentials , i.e. , @xmath50 . then an extended thouless condition based on the relation for the four - body t - matrix ( in principle equivalent to eq .",

    "an approximate solution has been obtained by a variational approach , in which the wave function is taken as gaussian incorporating the correct solution for the two - particle problem @xcite .",
    "the results are presented in figs .",
    "[ fig : trans_mu ] and [ fig : trans_dens ] . an important consequence of those is that at the lowest temperatures , bose - einstein condensation occurs for @xmath0 particles rather than for deuterons . as the density increases within the low - temperature regime , the chemical potential @xmath51 first reaches @xmath53 mev , where the @xmath0 s bose - condense .",
    "by contrast , bose condensation of deuterons would not occur until @xmath51 rises to @xmath54 mev .",
    "the _ `` quartetting '' _ transition temperature sharply drops as the rising density approaches the critical mott value at which the four - body bound states disappear . at that point ,",
    "pair formation in the isospin - singlet deuteron - like channel comes into play , and a deuteron condensate will exist below the critical temperature for bcs pairing up to densities above the nuclear - matter saturation density @xmath9 , as described in the previous section . the critical density at which the @xmath0 condensate disappears is estimated to be @xmath55 .",
    "therefore , @xmath0-particle condensation primarily only exists in the bose - einstein - condensed ( bec ) phase and there does not seem to exist a phase where the quartets acquire a large extension as cooper pairs do in the weak coupling regime . however , the variational approach of ref .",
    "@xcite on which this conclusion is based represents only a first attempt at the description of the transition from quartetting to pairing .",
    "the detailed nature of this fascinating transition remains to be clarified .",
    "many different questions arise in relation to the possible physical occurrence and experimental manifestations of quartetting : can we observe the hypothetical `` @xmath0 condensate '' in nature ?",
    "what about thermodynamic stability ?",
    "what happens with quartetting in asymmetric nuclear matter ?",
    "are more complex quantum condensates possible ?",
    "what is their relevance for finite nuclei ? as discussed below , the special type of microscopic quantum correlation associated with quartetting may be important in nuclei , its role in these finite inhomogeneous systems being similar to that of pairing .",
    "let us discuss the possibility of quartetting in nuclei .",
    "the only nucleus having a pronounced @xmath0-cluster structure in its ground state is @xmath7be . in fig .",
    "[ profiles](a ) , we show the result of an exact calculation of the density distribution of @xmath7be in the laboratory frame . in fig .",
    "[ profiles](b ) we show , for comparison , the result of the same calculation in the intrinsic , deformed frame .",
    "we see a pronounced two @xmath0-cluster structure where the two @xmath0 s are @xmath11 4 fm apart , giving rise to a very low average density @xmath56 as seen in fig .",
    "[ profiles](a ) . as already discussed in the introduction ,",
    "@xmath7be is a rather unusual and unique nucleus .",
    "one may be intrigued by the question , already raised earlier , whether loosely bound @xmath0-particle configurations may not also exist in heavier @xmath3-nuclei , at least in excited states , naturally close to the @xmath3 disintegration threshold . since @xmath0-particles are rather inert bosons ( first excited state at @xmath11 20 mev ) , these @xmath0-particles then would all condense in the lowest @xmath57-wavefunction , very much in the same way as do bosonic atoms in magneto - optical traps @xcite . this question and",
    "exploring related issues of quartetting in finite nuclei will consume most of the rest of the present study .",
    "in fact , we will be able to offer strong arguments that the @xmath58 state of @xmath2c at 7.654 mev is a state of @xmath0-condensate nature .",
    "later , also indications for the existence of an analogous state in @xmath4o will be discussed .",
    "first , it should be understood that the @xmath58 state in @xmath2c is in fact hadronically unstable ( as @xmath7be ) , being situated about 300 kev above the three @xmath0-break up threshold .",
    "this state is stabilized only by the coulomb barrier .",
    "it has a width of @xmath59 ev and a corresponding lifetime of @xmath60 s. as well known , this state is of paramount astrophysical ( and biological ! ) importance due to its role in the creation of @xmath2c in stellar nucleosynthesis .",
    "its existence was predicted in 1953 by the astrophysicist fred hoyle @xcite .",
    "his prediction was confirmed experimentally a few years later by willy fowler and coworkers at caltech @xcite .",
    "it is also well known that this _",
    "hoyle state _",
    ", as it is now called , is a notoriously difficult state for any nuclear theory to explain .",
    "for example , the most modern no - core shell - model calculations predict the @xmath58 state in @xmath2c to lie at around 17 mev above the ground state  more than twice the actual value @xcite .",
    "this fact alone tells us that the hoyle state must have a very unusual structure .",
    "it is easy to understand that , should it indeed have the proposed loosely bound three @xmath0-particle structure , a shell - model type of calculation would have great difficulties in reproducing its properties .",
    "an important development bearing on this issue took place some thirty years ago .",
    "two japanese physicists , m. kamimura @xcite and k. uegaki @xcite , along with their collaborators , almost simultaneously reproduced the hoyle state from a microscopic theory .",
    "they employed a twelve - nucleon wave function together with a hamiltonian containing an effective nucleon - nucleon interaction . at that time , their work did not attract the attention it deserved ; the true importance of their achievement has been appreciated only recently .",
    "the two groups started from practically the same ansatz for the @xmath2c wave function , which has the following three @xmath0-cluster structure : @xmath61\\,.\\ ] ] in this expression , the operator @xmath62 imposes antisymmetry in the nucleonic degrees of freedom and @xmath63 , with @xmath64 for the three @xmath0 s , is an intrinsic @xmath0-particle wave function of prescribed gaussian form , @xmath65/{8b^2}\\right\\}\\ , ,   \\label{alphawf}\\ ] ] where the size parameter @xmath66 is adjusted to fit the rms of the free @xmath0-particle , and @xmath67 is a yet - to - be determined three - body wave function for the c.o.m.motion of the three @xmath0 s , their corresponding jacobi coordinates being denoted by @xmath68 and @xmath69 .",
    "the unknown function @xmath70 was determined via calculations based on the generator coordinate method @xcite ( gcm ) and the resonating group method @xcite ( rgm ) calculations using the volkov i and volkov ii nucleon - nucleon forces , which fit @xmath0-@xmath0 phase shifts .",
    "the precise solution of this complicated three body problem , carried out three decades ago , was truly a pioneering achievement , with results fulfilling expectations .",
    "the position of the hoyle state , as well as other properties including the inelastic form factor and transition probability , successfully reproduced the experimental data .",
    "other states of @xmath2c below and around the energy of the hoyle state were also successfully described .",
    "moreover , it was already recognized that the three @xmath0 s in the hoyle state form sort of a gas - like state .",
    "in fact , this feature had previously been noted by h.  horiuchi @xcite prior to the appearance of refs .",
    "@xcite , based on results from the orthogonality condition model ( ocm ) @xcite .",
    "all three japanese research groups concluded from their studies that the linear - chain state of three @xmath0-particles , postulated by morinaga many years earlier @xcite as an interpretation of the hoyle state , had to be rejected .",
    "although the evidence for interpreting the hoyle state in terms of an @xmath0 gas was stressed in the cited papers from the late 1970 s , two important aspects of the situation were missed at that time .",
    "first , because the three @xmath0 s move in identical @xmath57-wave orbits , one is dealing with an @xmath0-condensate state , albeit not in the macroscopic sense , and that this may be a quite general phenomenon , also in heavier self - conjugate nuclei .",
    "the second important point is that the complicated three - body wave function @xmath71 for the c.o.m .",
    "motion of the three @xmath0 s can be replaced by a structurally and conceptually very simple microscopic three-@xmath0 wave function of the condensate type , which has practically 100 percent overlap with the previously constructed ones @xcite @xcite ( see also ref .",
    "we now describe this condensate wave function .",
    "we start by examining the bcs wave function of ordinary fermion pairing , obtained by projecting the familiar bcs ground - state ansatz onto an @xmath72-particle subspace of fock space . in the position representation",
    ", this wave function is @xmath73\\ , , \\label{eq:1}\\ ] ] where @xmath74 is the cooper - pair wave function ( including spin and isospin ) , which is to be determined variationally through the familiar bcs equations .",
    "the condensate character of the bcs ansatz is borne out by the fact that within the antisymmetrizer @xmath75 , one has a product of @xmath76 times the same pair wave function @xmath77 , with one such function for each distinct pair in the reference partition of @xmath78 . formally , it is now a simple matter to generalize ( [ eq:1 ] ) to quartet or @xmath0-particle condensation .",
    "we write @xmath79\\ , , \\label{eq:2}\\ ] ] where @xmath80 is the wave function common to all condensed @xmath0-particles . of course , finding the variational solution for this function is , in general , extraordinarily more complicated than finding the cooper pair - wave function @xmath77 of eq .",
    "( [ eq:1 ] ) .",
    "even so , in the present case that the @xmath0-particle is the four - body cluster involved , and for applications to relatively light nuclei , the complexity of the problem can be reduced dramatically .",
    "this possibility stems from the fact , already known to the authors of refs .",
    "@xcite , that , due to the bec - character of @xmath0-particle condensation ( see above ) , an excellent variational ansatz for the intrinsic wave function of the @xmath0-particle is provided [ as in eq .",

    "in addition  and here resides the essential point of our wave function  even the c.o.m .",
    "motion of the system of @xmath0-particles can be described very well by a gaussian wave function with , this time , a size parameter @xmath81 to account for the motion over the nuclear space .",

    ", one sees enhanced occupation ( 2.38 ) of the @xmath57 orbit and reduced occupation ( 0.29 , 0.16 , respectively ) of the @xmath96 and @xmath187 orbits .",
    "this corresponds to an enhancement of about 70% compared with equipartition .    to get a more extended analysis ,",
    "ocm calculations have been performed @xcite for studying the density dependence of the @xmath57-orbit occupancy in the hoyle state on the different densities @xmath217 , in which the rms radius ( @xmath172 ) of @xmath2c is taken as a parameter and @xmath218=2.56 fm .",
    "a pauli - principle respected ocm basis @xmath219 with a size parameter @xmath220 is used , in which the value of @xmath220 is chosen to reproduce a given rms radius @xmath172 of @xmath2c , and the @xmath0 density matrix @xmath221 with respect to @xmath219 is diagonalized to obtain the @xmath57-orbit occupancy in the @xmath6 wave function .",
    "the results are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : cond_fraction_3alpha ] .",
    "the @xmath57-orbit occupancy is @xmath222  % around @xmath223 , while it decreases with increasing @xmath224 and amounts to about @xmath225 % in the saturation density region .",
    "figure  [ fig:13a - d ] shows the radial behaviours of the @xmath57-orbit with given densities .",
    "a smooth transition of the @xmath57-orbit is observed , with decreasing @xmath224 , from a two - node @xmath57-wave nature @xmath226 in fig .",
    "[ fig:13a - d](a ) to the zero - node @xmath57-wave one @xmath227 in fig .",
    "[ fig:13a - d](d ) @xcite .",
    "the feature of the decrease of the enhanced occupation of the @xmath57 orbit is in striking correspondence with the density dependence of the condensate fraction calculated for nuclear matter ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : cond_fraction ] ) .",
    "orbit in the @xmath2c@xmath228 state with ( a ) @xmath229 fm @xmath230 , ( b ) @xmath231 fm @xmath232 , ( c ) @xmath233 fm @xmath234 , and ( d ) @xmath235 fm @xmath236 , where @xmath172 denotes the nuclear radius of the @xmath2c@xmath228 state . ]    a more accurate and reliable variational description of @xmath0 matter can be realized within the hypernetted - chain ( hnc ) approach to evaluation of correlated integrals ; this approach @xcite largely overcomes the limitations of the cluster - expansion treatment , including the need for an explicit normalization constraint .",
    "such an improved approach is certainly required near the saturation density of nuclear matter , where it predicts only a small condensate fraction @xcite .",
    "of course , at high densities the simple ali - bodmer interaction @xcite ceases to be valid , and it becomes crucial to include the effects of pauli blocking .",
    "once again , this conclusion reinforces the point that we can expect signatures of an @xmath0 condensate only for dilute nuclei near the threshold of @xmath188 decay , but no signatures from configurations with saturated density .",
    "we have investigated the role that pairing and multiparticle correlations may play in nuclear matter existing in dense astrophysical objects and in finite nuclei . a complete and quantitative description of nuclear matter must allow for the presence of clusters of nucleons , bound or metastable , possibly forming a quantum condensate . in particular , quartetting correlations , responsible for the emergence of @xmath0-like clusters , are identified as uniquely important in determining the behavior of nuclear matter in the limiting regime of low density and low temperature .",
    "we have calculated the transition temperature for the onset of quantum condensates made up of @xmath0-like and deuteron - like bosonic clusters , and considered in considerable detail the intriguing example of bose - einstein condensation of @xmath0 particles .",
    "it turns out that contrary to pairing , quartet condensation primarily exists in the bec phase at low density . in which way quartet condensation",
    "is lost by increasing the density is still an open question .",
    "however , it is clear that there can not exist a condensate of quartets with a long coherence length for arbitrarily small attraction as this is the case for pairing in the bcs phase .",
    "it is inevitable that under increasing density or pressure , the bound @xmath0 , @xmath42 , or other nuclidic clusters present at low density experience significant modification due to the background medium ( and eventually merge with it ) .",
    "we have shown how self - energy corrections and pauli blocking alter the properties of cluster states , and we have formulated a cluster mean - field approximation to provide an initial description of this process .",
    "one result of special interest is the suppression of the @xmath0-like condensate , which is dominant at lower densities , as the density reaches and exceeds the mott value , allowing the pairing transition to occur . even at lower densities",
    "@xmath0-particle condensation may be influenced by neutron excess , i.e. in the case of asymmetric nuclear matter .",
    "the study of @xmath0-particle condensation as a function of asymmetry remains a task for the future .",
    "a truly remarkable manifestation of @xmath0-particle condensation seems to be present in finite nuclei .",
    "indeed , the so - called hoyle state ( @xmath58 ) in @xmath2c at 7.654 mev is very likely a dilute gas of three @xmath0-particles , held together only by the coulomb barrier .",
    "this view is encouraged by the fact that we can explain all the experimental data in terms of a conceptually simple wave function of the quartet - condensate type . within the same model",
    ", we also systematically predict such states in heavier @xmath100 nuclei , and the search is on for their experimental identification . in a recent study with ocm ( orthogonality condition model ) we predicted the 6-th @xmath6 state of @xmath4o to be a strong candidate for a loosely bound four @xmath0-particle state  @xcite .",
    "the results of that study are presented and discussed here .",
    "the condensate feature of the hoyle state in @xmath2c and hoyle - like state in @xmath4o is born out by the calculation of the bosonic occupation numbers in diagonalising the bosonic density matrix .",
    "it is shown that the occupation of the @xmath12 state of the @xmath0-particles is over 70% for the hoyle state in @xmath2c and over 60% for the hoyle - like state in @xmath4o .",
    "it is quite natural that such loosely bound @xmath0-particle states should exist up to some maximum number of @xmath0 particles .",
    "we estimate that the phenomenon will terminate at about eight to ten @xmath0 s as the confining coulomb barrier fades away . however , there is the possibility that larger condensates could be stabilized by addition of a few neutrons .",
    "indeed , consider @xmath237be , which , contrary to @xmath238be , is bound by @xmath11 1.5 mev , still showing a pronounced two @xmath0-structure similar to the one of fig .",
    "[ profiles ] ( b ) .",
    "one could imagine ten @xmath0 s or more , stabilised by two or four extra neutrons in a low density phase .",
    "however , even without being stabilised , if a compressed hot nuclear blob as e.g. produced in a central heavy ion collision expands and cools , it may turn on its way out , at a certain low density , into an expanding @xmath0 condensed state where all @xmath0 s are in relative @xmath57-waves .",
    "this would be an analogous situation to an expanding bose condensate of atoms , once the trapping potential has been switched off .",
    "forthcoming analysis of dedicated experiments with high resolution multiparticle detectors like chimera at lns , catania , will tell whether such scenarios can be realised @xcite .",
    "other possibilities of loose @xmath0-gas states may exist on top of particularly stable cores , like @xmath4o or @xmath239ca . indeed in adding @xmath0 s to e.g. @xmath239ca",
    ", one will reach the @xmath0-particle drip line .",
    "compound states of heavy @xmath240 nuclei of this kind may be produced in heavy ion reactions and an enhanced @xmath0-decay rate may reveal the existence of an @xmath0-particle condensate .",
    "ideas of this type are presently promoted by von oertzen @xcite , and also m. brenner @xcite , and a. ogloblin @xcite .",
    "however , coincidence measurements of multiple @xmath0 s of decaying lighter nuclei like @xmath4o may also be very useful @xcite @xcite to detect at least one additional @xmath0-condensate state beyond the only one that has been identified so far , namely the @xmath58-state in @xmath2c",
    ".    in finite nuclei @xmath0-particle condensation has to be understood in the same sense as we say nuclei are superfluid inspite of the presence of only a limited number of cooper pairs .",
    "however , in compact stars , formed by supernova explosions , macroscopic condensates of @xmath0-particles may be present .",
    "in the study of reference @xcite , @xmath0-particle phases are predicted for temperatures which can easily be below the critical temperatures obtained by our calculation displayed in figs .",
    "[ fig : trans_mu ] and [ fig : trans_dens ] . for the study of such macroscopic condensates",
    ", the use of the gross - pitaevskii equation for interacting ideal bosons can be useful @xcite but may be hampered by our poor knowledge of the density dependence of the effective @xmath0-@xmath0 interaction .",
    "a genuine microscopic approach for @xmath0-particle condensation in infinite matter is demanded , since our wave function , eqs .",
    "( [ eq:2 ] ) and ( [ eq:3 ] ) , only can handle a limited number of @xmath0 s due to the necessary explicit antisymmetrisation .",
    "a preliminary route to this aim is outlined in this presentation .",
    "another issue which may be raised in the context of @xmath0-particle condensation is the question , also discussed in condensed matter physics @xcite , whether @xmath0 s condense as singles or as doubles , i.e. as @xmath238be ?",
    "in microscopic studies of @xmath2c one , indeed , can see that in the @xmath58-state two of the three @xmath0 s are slightly more closer to one another than to the third one @xcite . without coulomb repulsion @xmath7be",
    "may be bound by 2 - 3 mev , however , the coulomb repulsion makes it very slightly unbound .",
    "the question is definitely very interesting and deserves future investigation .",
    "however , quantitatively , if at all , @xmath0-@xmath0 correlations constitute certainly only a slight modification over the present formulation of @xmath0-condensation .",
    "one may even ask whether these @xmath238be - like correlations are not an artifact of the calculation because in the rgm calculation of @xcite @xmath238be - like correlations are definitely allowed , however , as already mentioned , our pure @xmath0-particle condensate wave function turned out to have almost 100 percent overlap with the one of the rgm calculation .    as already outlined earlier , nuclear systems exhibit especially strong cluster and few body effects .",
    "this stems primarily from the fact that there are four different fermions with in addition more or less equal attraction among one another .",
    "however , this situation is not necessarily unique . in the past",
    "there have been speculations that in semi - conductors bi - excitons may condense rather than excitons  @xcite",
    ". a very promising field in this respect may be the possibility to trap in magneto - optical devices fermionic atoms in four different magnetic sub - states @xcite .",
    "if in addition the interaction between all four fermions could be triggered , eventually with the help of feshbach resonances , so that they are all attractive , then investigation of quartetting could become a domain of research as rich as is presently the investigation of pairing .",
    "clearly , the study of quartet condensation only is at its beginning and perspectives are rich and manyfold .    in conclusion",
    ", we see that the idea of @xmath0-particle condensation in nuclei has already triggered many new ideas and calculations , in spite of the fact that , so far , a compelling case for such a state has only been made in @xmath2c .",
    "even so , the possible existence of a completely new nuclear phase in which @xmath0-particles play the role of quasi - elementary constituents is surely fascinating .",
    "hopefully , many more @xmath0-particle states of nuclei will be detected in the near future , bringing deeper insights into the role of clustering and quantum condensates in systems of strongly interacting fermions .",
