    "the investigation of the one - band hubbard model is an actual problem already for more than a half century . in recent decades ,",
    "the two dimensional ( 2d ) case closely related to the problem of high temperature superconductivity has been intensively studied .",
    "the ground state of the model in the half  filled case for the bipartite lattices is a nel antiferromagnetic ( afm ) insulator .",
    "the types of instability of the antiferromagnetic state in the presence of doping or the finite integral of the electron transfer between the second neighbors are still not incompletely revealed . according to the classical work @xcite , when one charge carrier is added , the ground state on the bipartite lattice is the saturated ferromagnetic ( fm ) one .",
    "this statement can be also considered as a reasonable hypothesis in the case of finite doping  @xcite .",
    "scenarios of possible doping  induced magnetic ordering include the phase separation ( ps ) of different types : to the ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases  @xcite or the phase of the superconducting electron liquid and the nel antiferromagnetic phase  @xcite .",
    "an alternative scenario is the formation of the spiral ( incommensurate ) magnetic state .",
    "it was considered within different approaches : the analysis of the momentum dependence of the generalized static magnetic susceptibility for the bare spectrum  @xcite , the hartree  fock approximation ( hfa ) , small and moderate @xmath3 values being treated , where @xmath2 is the parameter of the coulomb repulsion and @xmath4 is the bandwidth  @xcite , and the @xmath5 model ( large @xmath3 values )  @xcite .",
    "the experimental observation of antiferromagnetic or spiral magnetic structures makes the classical problem of theoretical description of different type magnetic order formation very actual .",
    "spiral structures are observed in both two and three dimensional compounds : in iron based high temperature superconductors  @xcite in afm chromium and fcc @xmath6iron . in doped",
    "cuprates the spiral states are found as the dynamic magnetic order  @xcite . besides that",
    ", considerably enhanced incommensurate magnetic fluctuations are observed in strontium ruthenates at low temperatures  @xcite ( see discussion in refs .",
    "a detailed study of the magnetic phase diagram of the 2d hubbard model taking into account the electron transfer only between the nearest neighbors @xmath0 within hfa shows that the spiral magnetic states occur in a wide range of parameters , especially at moderate values @xmath7",
    "it was shown in  @xcite that inclusion of the electron transfer between second neighbors ( @xmath8 ) in the hamiltonian changes considerably the ground state magnetic phase diagram .",
    "in addition to the spiral structures , the formation of so called stripes was predicted  @xcite .",
    "however , this conclusion is somewhat devaluated by disregarding the intersite coulomb interaction , which can considerably increase the energy of the stripes as inhomogeneous structures .",
    "a convenient approach to study the formation of the magnetic order with account of correlations is the slave boson approximation ( sba ) by kotliar and ruckenstein  @xcite . in the saddle point approximation",
    ", this method is qualitatively similar to the gutzwiller approximation  @xcite .",
    "the effect of electron correlations on stability of the spiral magnetic states was considered in  @xcite using sba .",
    "the phase diagram of the hubbard model was built in the the nearest - neighbor approximation ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "later , the generalized static magnetic susceptibility was studied within the same method  @xcite .",
    "this makes it possible to determine the criterion of the instability of the paramagnetic state with respect to a second  order transition into the incommensurate magnetic state ( this generalizes the criterion obtained within the random phase approximation  @xcite to the strongly correlated states ) . as a result ,",
    "a considerable tendency to ferromagnetic ordering at hole doping and large @xmath10 values was found .",
    "however , the phase transitions between the magnetically ordered states can not be studied within this approach .",
    "although the description of thermodynamics is a difficult problem , in the ground state the approaches discussed can be used also for three  dimensional ( 3d ) lattices ( e.g. , transition metal compounds ) . in the present paper",
    "we apply both non - correlated mean - field ( hartree  fock ) approximation and the slave boson approximation to 2d and 3d @xmath0@xmath1 hubbard model .",
    "we consider the hubbard model @xmath11 where the matrix elements of the electronic transfer are @xmath12 for the nearest neighbors and @xmath1 for the next  nearest neighbors , @xmath13 are electronic creation and annihilation operators correspondingly .",
    "local spin space rotation matching different site magnetization vectors by the angle @xmath14 ( where @xmath15 is a spiral wave vector , @xmath16 is a site position ) is applied for the consideration of magnetic spirals .",
    "this transforms spiral magnetic state into the effective ferromagnetic one , but the hopping term in the hamiltonian becomes non  diagonal with respect to spin index .",
    "the hartree  fock treatment of many  particle coulomb interaction term replaces it by the one  electron interaction term with some effective field @xmath17 which however mixes the contributions of singly occupied states and doubles on the equal footing ( @xmath18 is an average electronic density at site @xmath19 and spin projection @xmath20 ) .",
    "this is not correctly physically , especially at large @xmath2 .",
    "a simple way to take into account correlation effects ( energetically unfavorability of doubly occupied site states ) is the introducing of the slave boson operators @xmath21 , describing the transitions between site states originating from the electronic system dynamics on an alternative language but _ simultaneously _ with the conventional slater determinant based formalism ( related with one  electron operators ) .",
    "conceptually this is close to the hubbard @xmath22operator formalism@xcite , where however the site transition @xmath22operators are introduced _ instead of _ the original one  electron operators .",
    "the extension of the original hubbard hamiltonian ( [ eq : original_h ] ) has the form where the coulomb interaction term is diagonal with respect to the boson operators : @xmath23 where @xmath24_{\\sigma\\sigma'}t_{ij}$ ] , and @xmath25 @xmath26 the eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_ext ] ) is equivalent to ( [ eq : original_h ] ) if the unphysical site states ( which have no equivalents for the original electronic system ) are excluded .",
    "the range of definition of @xmath27 is restricted by the following constraints : @xmath28 @xmath29    the presence of the constraints can be taken into account within the functional integral formalism through the lagrange multipliers ( on - site electron energy shift @xmath30 for eq .",
    "( [ eq : lmb_constraint ] ) and local bosonic `` chemical potential '' @xmath31 for eq .",
    "( [ eq : eta_constraint ] ) ) introduced into the action . up to now the transformation considered is exact , but further exact functional treatment of both bosonic and fermionic fields is hardly possible . a reasonable physical picture at large @xmath32 ( different from the hartree  fock s )",
    "can be obtained within the saddle ",
    "point approximation for bosonic fields and lagrange multipliers : for the action @xmath33 generated by eq .",
    "( [ eq : h_ext ] ) we replace the bosonic fields by their extremal _ real _ values which are assumed to be site and time  independent : @xmath34 .",
    "the fermionic part of the action can be produced by the hamiltonian which has the form @xmath35 which eigenvalues ( antiferromagnetic subbands ) yield the renormalization of the electronic spectrum : @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 , @xmath39 is a bare electronic spectrum .    on the thermodynamic level the impact of the on  site states on the electronic states manifests itself in two types of bare spectrum renormalization : narrowing of the bare spectrum ( like in the hubbard ",
    "i approximation@xcite ) , which is specified by factor @xmath40 and the additional energy shift @xmath41 ( like in the hartree  fock approximation where @xmath42 @xmath43 is the electronic density and @xmath44 is the site magnetization ) . both @xmath45 and @xmath41 are essentially spin  dependent which allows to investigate the formation of magnetic states . however , in the slave boson formalism",
    ", in contrast with hfa , the one  electron energy shift @xmath41 can not be expressed in terms of @xmath46 and @xmath47 only and should be specified separately , see eq .",
    "( [ eq : lmb_eq ] ) . to write sba equations , it is convenient to introduce an analogue of the harris  lange shift  @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath49 is the fermi function and the derivative @xmath50 corresponds to formal derivative of eq .",

    "( [ eq : main_p ] ) should be replaced by the equation @xmath54 .",
    "note that @xmath55 implies the vanishing of @xmath41 and these replacements ( especially at large @xmath32 ) violate the eq .",
    "( [ eq : main_p ] ) , which indicates insufficiency of hfa .",
    "the condition @xmath56 is equivalent ( by the schwarz inequality ) to @xmath57 , which means that electronic motion is insensitive to the character of site states , even in the sense of averaging single and double site occupancies ( @xmath58 ) .    the saddle point expression for the thermodynamic potential of the spiral state(per site ) @xmath59 has a form @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the standard potential for the non  interacting electron system in the field @xmath41 , with narrowed ( by factor @xmath45 ) spectrum @xmath62    the resulting wave vector is determined by the minimization of @xmath63 over various spiral states ( spiral wave vector @xmath64 ) .",
    "the minimization of @xmath59 with respect to @xmath15 was performed numerically while @xmath65 was running in the most relevant region of its parameter space ; the step of changing its components is @xmath66 ( here and hereafter the lattice parameter @xmath67 is taken to be unity ) .",
    "since @xmath63 in the ground state actually depends on the chemical potential @xmath68 as a parameter , we can determine the dependence of the magnetic structure on @xmath68 by a procedure taking into account the possibility of the phase separation  @xcite .",
    "we calculated the phase diagrams of the ground state at different @xmath10 values within the hartree ",
    "fock approximation in  @xcite ; for @xmath9 we present these results in fig .",

    "analogous phase diagram obtained within sba is shown in fig . [",
    "fig : square_t=0]b  @xcite .",
    "note that for both these approaches the phase transitions between the different magnetic states are generally first - order transitions that leads to considerable regions of phase separation.the account of ps considerably distinguishes the phase diagram obtained within sba from that presented in  @xcite , where ps was disregarded .",
    "the separation regions between the antiferromagnetic phase and the spiral magnetic states ( parallel , @xmath69 and diagonal , @xmath70 ) are especially wide . therefore , the regions of the pure spiral states are narrowed .",
    "in particular , this refers to the diagonal phase , the existence of which becomes possible only at @xmath71 .",
    "the phase transition between the paramagnetic and spiral magnetic states is of a second order .     at @xmath72 within ( a ) hfa  @xcite and ( b ) sba .",
    "the phase diagram for the case @xmath73 due to the electron  hole symmetry ( @xmath74 ) coincides with the given one .",
    "the spiral phases are denoted according to the form of their wave vector .",
    "filling shows the regions of the phase separation .",
    "bold lines denote the second order phase transitions .",
    "solid lines correspond to the boundaries between the regions of the homogeneous phase and the phase separation .",
    "dashed lines show the regions of the separation of different phases .",
    "@xmath75 , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    one can see that the electron correlations lead to a noticeable suppression of the magnetically ordered states in comparison with hfa : the corresponding concentration intervals in the phase diagram decrease strongly , and the variety of the spiral states disappears .",
    "besides that , in the slave boson approximation there occurs a wide region of paramagnetic state .",
    "the ferromagnetic state covering a considerable part of the diagram within hfa is shifted to the region of large values @xmath76 .",
    "this behavior reproduces the result obtained in  @xcite and is in a good agreement with the variational study of the stability of the saturated ferromagnetic phase  @xcite .",
    "the region of the separation of the antiferromagnetic and spiral phases is narrowed by about a factor of 2 .    according to our calculations , even unrestricted increase of @xmath2",
    "does not make the magnetically ordered states stable far from half filling : at @xmath77 , there are no spiral magnetic solutions to equations of the slave boson method at @xmath78 and @xmath79.at the same time , the saturated ferromagnetic solution becomes more favorable than the spiral ones at @xmath80 .",
    "thus , the spiral magnetic state at large @xmath2 values far from half filling replaces the saturated ferromagnetic one .",
    "in contrast to  @xcite , the unsaturated ferromagnetic solutions exist within our approach , but they are always energy unfavorable in comparison with the saturated ferromagnetic or spiral magnetic states .    up to the end of this section we present our results for the square lattice for nonzero value of @xmath1 for which the particle  hole symmetry breaks down : the difference of hole",
    " doped ( @xmath72 ) and electron  doped ( @xmath81 ) systems properties is of a great interest@xcite .",

    "@xmath83 , for the case @xmath72 the diagonal phase shifts to the region of much smaller @xmath32 values and the parallel phase becomes more extended over the concentration parameter .",
    "the physical origin is the shift of the density value @xmath84 corresponding to the coincidence of the fermi level in the paramagnetic phase and the van hove singularity level ( for @xmath82 @xmath85 ) with respect to half filling ( @xmath86 ) : at @xmath8 these points give their own tendencies to the corresponding magnetic ordering .",
    "we see that in the hole ",
    "doped half of the phase diagram the correlation effects lead only to a quantitative renormalization of the phase boundaries .     within hfa  @xcite .",

    "such a suppression of magnetism is explained by the fact that here all the singular features come from the point @xmath86 .",
    "far from half filling , any spiral magnetism is impossible and the saturated ferromagnetism is unfavorable in comparison with the paramagnetic phase at any large @xmath2 value , when correlations are taken into account .",
    "thus , the electron  hole asymmetry is enhanced considerably in comparison with hfa .     within sba ,",
    "scaledwidth=50.0% ]    these results can be used for qualitatively explaining of the magnetic properties of layered high  temperature superconducting perovskites , for which the fitting of the angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy spectra to the bare model one yields @xmath87 .",
    "the results are in agreement@xcite with the experimental data on the magnetic structure of the hole  doped compound la@xmath88sr@xmath89cuo@xmath90 , which has a close value of the @xmath10 parameter  @xcite .",
    "at the same time , for the high temperature superconducting compound nd@xmath91ce@xmath92cuo@xmath90 , in which the charge carriers are electrons , the homogeneous commensurate antiferromagnetic ordering is stable up to @xmath93  @xcite in agreement with our results for @xmath73 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : square_t=0.2_sb ] ) .",
    "now we present the results for three  dimensional lattices : simple cubic ( sc ) and body centered cubic ( bcc ) lattices .",
    "first we consider the ground state magnetic phase diagram for sc lattice with @xmath83 .",
    "the physical picture is very similar to that for the square lattice ( see fig . [",
    "fig : cubic_t=0 ] for comparison of the results of hfa ( a ) and sba ( b ) approaches ) :",
    "the density value @xmath94 corresponding to both van hove singularity and perfect antiferromagnetic nesting peculiarity retains its crucial role .",
    "the spiral @xmath95 magnetic phase for the square lattice is replaced by the spiral with @xmath96 .",
    "note that finiteness of the density of states at the fermi level corresponding to @xmath94 in the paramagnetic phase ( which makes the tendency to ferromagnetic ordering weaker within the stoner theory ) does not actually affect the phase diagram since this tendency is in any case much weaker than the antiferromagnetic instability tendency present in the vicinity of half  filling .",
    "we consider the results of sba in the case of non ",
    "zero @xmath1 ( see fig . [",

    "one can see that in the vicinity of @xmath97 and rather small @xmath98 the competition of diagonal ( @xmath99 ) and ferromagnetic phases is present to the right of @xmath100 ( this has a direct analogy in the square lattice case ) . on the other hand , there is ps into the paramagnetic and ferromagnetic phases to the left of point @xmath84 ; this does not occur in the two  dimensional case .",
    "however , the ferromagnetic region is rather narrow and survives ( as well as the diagonal phase ) in the vicinity of @xmath84 ; this feature is different from the square lattice . as well as in the 2d case , we found hole  particle strong asymmetry",
    ": for @xmath72 the variety of magnetic phases appears at not too large @xmath32 .",
    "for instance , at a realistic value @xmath101 we found afm phase in the vicinity of half  filling , which is replaced by the phase with @xmath102 ( and a small fracture of @xmath103 phase ) as the density becomes lower .",
    "then one observes a wide non  magnetic region , and at low density the system enters the region of ferromagnetic and diagonal phase competition . for @xmath81 the magnetism is strongly suppressed ( as well as in 2d case ) .     at @xmath72 within ( a ) hfa and ( b ) sba .",
    "the notations are analogous to that in fig .",

    "@xmath106 , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    in fig .",
    "[ fig : bcc_t=0 ] we present the results for the bcc lattice hubbard model in the case @xmath83 .",
    "one can see that correlation effects strongly but only quantitatively renormalize the boundary phase lines in a rather wide vicinity of half  filling , but well away from half  filling they fully destroy magnetic ordering . the van hove singularity corresponding to @xmath107 results in this case in an especially wide ps and magnetic phase regions ; the dominating magnetic order is diagonal one ( @xmath99 ) .",
    "this is a manifestation of especially strong van hove singularity at the band centre for the bcc lattice .",
    "at @xmath72 within ( a ) hfa and ( b ) sba . at second order transitions the wave vector @xmath104 reaches continuously the brillouin zone boundary ( @xmath105 or @xmath108 ) ; @xmath109 , scaledwidth=50.0% ]    we present the results for bcc lattice with @xmath110 obtained within hfa ( fig .",

    "[ fig : bcc_t=0.3_sb ] ) .",
    "it is evident that the results are considerably different from square and sc lattices . for electron doping the correlation effects results in the fact that up to large @xmath32 pure antiferromagnetic ordering in the vicinity of half  filling occurs , which is changed by paramagnetic phase for @xmath111 .",
    "the variety of magnetic phases which exist far away from half  filling in hfa vanishes . for hole doping at rather large @xmath112 there occur ferromagnetic phase and @xmath113 phase which can be considered as a modulated ferromagnetic phase . at smaller @xmath32",
    "the diagonal @xmath114 phase becomes favorable in a wide region .",
    "in hfa there exists ps into ferromagnetic and afm phases in the vicinity of half  filling .",
    "it is interesting that in this case correlations practically do not renormalize critical values of @xmath2 .",

    "the correlations effects considered can be important , e.g.  for metal  insulator ( mott ) transitions . within the hartree  fock approximation including spiral states the latter problem was treated in  @xcite .",
    "the slave boson approximation enables one to take into account correlations in terms of a few parameters renormalizing the electron spectrum .",
    "such an approach is more simple and transparent in comparison with dynamical mean  field theory ( dmft ) which employs local approximation for the self  energy , so that spectrum renormalization is difficult for the interpretation .",
    "we see that correlation effects lead to strong suppression of the regions of the existence of the magnetic phases . at the same time , the first - order transitions and the noticeable regions of the phase separation between the magnetically ordered states are retained .",

    "fock results , so that at small @xmath10 they do not modify the sequences of the magnetic states with increasing @xmath2 .",
    "the increase in the @xmath10 parameter leads to a redistribution of the electron density of states closer to the band bottom and to the van hove singularity , which is important for formation of magnetism .",
