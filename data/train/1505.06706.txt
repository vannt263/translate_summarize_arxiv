    "the yukawa pair potential , which is also referred to as the screened coulomb potential , has the form    @xmath0    here @xmath1 is the particle charge in the gaussian unit system and @xmath2 the so - called screening length .",
    "although debye - hckel theory was devised for describing the behavior of dilute ionic solutions , the yukawa potential has proven useful also in the description of charge carriers that are much larger than those of the surrounding medium .",
    "this is the case for instance in suspensions of charge - stabilized colloids or in dusty plasmas , compare , e.g. the dlvo theory  @xcite in which the interaction between the surfaces of two colloids is described by a potential of the yukawa form .",
    "the colloid particles are often modeled with a potential that adds a hard - core repulsion , but the low - temperature part of the phase diagram of this `` hard - core '' yukawa potential can be mapped onto the phase diagram of the yukawa pair potential  @xcite .    besides electrons and ions , dusty plasmas contain small solid particles that are charged . in dusty plasmas",
    "the distance between the solid particles is usually large compared to the size of the particles , and their interaction can therefore be modeled using the ( point ) yukawa potential of eq .",

    "is sometimes used to capture phenomena like plasma production and loss balance  @xcite .",
    "the physics of dusty plasmas is not only of interest for industrial applications where such plasmas are formed , but also in astrophysics for the understanding of stellar materials and planet formation  @xcite .    in 1986",
    "it was found that colloids in suspension can form crystal lattices  @xcite and it was predicted that this should also be possible in dusty plasmas  @xcite .",

    "the case @xmath7 corresponds to the potential energy from the individual pair interactions being much larger than the thermal energy ; this favors crystallization , depending on the value of @xmath8 , see below . in the opposite limit , @xmath9 , the system approaches an ideal gas .",

    "this is an approximation to the isomorph theory that applies when fairly small changes in density are considered , as in most experiments  @xcite . because both the excess entropy , @xmath33 ( @xmath34 being the entropy of the ideal gas at same temperature and density ) , and the reduced - unit dynamics are invariant along isomorphs , the isomorph theory also predicts that r liquids obey rosenfeld s excess entropy scaling , which states that the reduced transport coefficients are functions of @xmath35  @xcite .",

    "for instance , the collective position of the system s particles , @xmath42 , is expressed in reduced units as    @xmath43    where the tilde here and henceforth denotes a reduced quantity .",

    "the functions @xmath48 and @xmath49 both have units of energy .",
    "the physics of eq .",
    "( [ eq : hidden_scale_invariance ] ) is that upon changing the density of a system , the potential - energy surface to a good approximation merely undergoes a linear , affine rescaling . we proceed to show how eq .",
    "( [ eq : hidden_scale_invariance ] ) is used to derive the most important properties of r systems , their strong virial energy correlations and the existence of isomorphs . before doing so",
    "we note that the isomorph theory was recently generalized by defining a roskilde - simple system by the property that the order of potential energies is maintained for uniform scaling of configurations , i.e. , by the condition @xmath50  @xcite .",

    "the two state points @xmath74 and @xmath75 are by definition _",

    "not all quantities are invariant even in reduced units , for instance the free energy and its volume derivatives like pressure or compressibility .",
    "because the temperature is proportional to @xmath48 along an isomorph with the same proportionality constant , isomorphs are described by    @xmath76    since moreover the excess entropy per particle @xmath77 is constant on an isomorph ( because the boltzmann probabilities of scaled configurations are ) , the temperature of an r system , i.e. , one with isomorphs , separates as follows  @xcite    @xmath78    it can be shown that this separation property is mathematically equivalent to the thermal average of eq .",

    "the reduced diffusion coefficients are virtually constant over the range simulated by this method . the results for the isomorph estimated from the pair potential with @xmath149 collapse with those of the isomorph from the direct isomorph check .",
    "interestingly , the range where the diffusion coefficients are almost invariant coincides with the range where agreement between the estimated and the fluctuation @xmath20 is best .",
    "we also note that although @xmath135 leads to a worse prediction for @xmath20 , it gives a more invariant diffusion coefficient when the whole phase diagram is considered .",
    "we attribute this to some cancellation of errors , rather than reflecting that @xmath135 gives a more precise value of the relevant interparticle distance .",

    "[ fig : y_im8_structure](a ) ) and @xmath166 ( fig .",
    "[ fig : y_im8_structure ] ) .    whereas the 10% density change applied in fig .",
    "[ fig : smallstep ] resulted in invariance of the structure , the large density changes applied here ( a factor of 10 and @xmath166 respectively ) _ do _ lead to systematic changes in the structure along the proposed isomorph , especially in the region of the first peak of @xmath164 .",
    "this is not unexpected , because the increase in the steepness of the potential with decreasing density ( see fig .  [ fig : y_im_rgamma ] ) makes close encounters between particles less probable .",
    "this results in a steeper initial slope of @xmath164 and thus a higher first peak if the total number of nearest neighbors is unchanged  @xcite .",
    "taking into account that the direct - isomorph - check isomorph `` only '' involves densities variations covering a single decade , we note that the deviation from isomorphic invariance is smallest for the state points obtained using @xmath135 .    not only the height of the peak , but also its position changes somewhat along the prospective isomorphs .",
    "this is an effect of the large change in the effective steepness of the potential ( i.e. , relative to @xmath167 ) .",
    "the yukawa potential has for instance both a bcc and an fcc solid phase with the triple point at @xmath168  @xcite .",
    "these two crystal structures have different reduced nearest - neighbor distances , and it is not surprising that some of these structural differences continue to exist in the liquid state .",
    "the change of the nearest - neighbor distance with density , however , indicates that a single value for @xmath121 is not enough for accurately tracing out the isomorph .",
    "we have shown that the yukawa system is roskilde simple .",
    "this was shown from the strong correlations between equilibrium virial and potential - energy fluctuations and by the fact that the yukawa system has isomorphs in its phase diagram .",
    "an isomorph is a curve of constant excess entropy , but the curve can also be estimated directly from the pair potential .",
    "we have verified that the dynamics are invariant on the isomorphs as predicted by the theory .",
    "the structure of the fluid as characterized by the radial distribution function was found to be invariant to a lesser degree , in part because the position of the first peak shifts slightly .",
    "our estimate of the isomorph shape from the pair potential uses the nearest - neighbor distance .",
    "consequently , eq .  ( [ eq : y_gamma_rho_isomorph ] ) with a constant @xmath121 can _ not _ give an exact description of the density dependence of @xmath20 along an isomorph . in view of the invariant dynamics shown in fig .  [ fig : im23_dynamics](a ) and ( b ) , however , eq .  ( [ eq : y_hrho ] ) with @xmath135 must be said to give a rather good description of the isomorph shape .    in summary",
    ", we have shown that the isomorph theory provides a simple and general framework for understanding previous findings for the yukawa system .",
    "thus our results explain the previously identified expression of the melting line of yukawa systems  @xcite , which here follows from the fact that the melting line is an isomorph  @xcite .",
