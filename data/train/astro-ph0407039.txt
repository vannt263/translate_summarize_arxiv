    "be stars are defined as ` non - supergiant b - type stars whose spectra have , or had at one time , one or more balmer lines in emission ' @xcite .",
    "the pioneering research on be stars by struve proposed a rotational model with emission lines from equatorial disks @xcite , but be star disks remain enigmatic despite many decades of detailed observations and research @xcite .",
    "the main physics problems they pose are how the material in them ( a ) is delivered from the star ; ( b ) becomes so dense ; ( c ) acquires such high angular momentum .",
    "the answer to ( a ) undoubtedly lies in stellar radiation pressure .",
    "the first qualitative answer to ( b ) was the wind compressed disk ( wcd ) model of @xcite . in this , the angular momentum of rotating wind flow returns the matter to the equator where north and south streams collide and create a shock compressed disk .",
    "there are several snags with this model .",
    "firstly , it does not produce high enough densities .",
    "secondly , the disk formed has mainly radial flows rather than the quasi - keplerian azimuthal flows observed .",
    "thirdly , non - radial line - driving forces @xcite may cause polar rather than equatorial flow to dominate .    a phenomenological solution to these problems",
    "was proposed and quantified parametrically in the magnetically torqued disk ( mtd ) model of @xcite .",
    "this invokes a dipole - like field which steers the wind flow toward the equator and torques up its angular momentum on the way .",
    "the field torques up the wind flow to keplerian speeds or higher and confines the radial flow redirecting it to be poloidal and creating a shock compressed equatorial disk .",
    "the isothermal disk grows in thickness ( but not in density ) over comparatively long timescales ( @xmath6 years ) which are roughly consistent with long time - scale variability of some be stars @xcite , allowing a quasi - steady treatment .",
    "there is growing observational evidence of reasonably strong fields ( hundreds of gauss ) in hot stars  e.g. , @xmath7  orionis with @xmath8  g @xcite , @xmath9  cephei with @xmath10  g @xcite , @xmath11  orionis  c with @xmath12  g @xcite , though some of these are very oblique and/or slow rotating and the mtd model not directly applicable in its basic form .    in the mtd treatment the stellar wind mass flux and wind speed",
    "were taken to be uniform over the stellar surface .",
    "for the case of a rotating star , essential to creating a disk , this assumption is invalid .",
    "rotation results in equatorial gravity darkening which reduces the wind mass flux and speed there , as described by @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we evaluate the effects of this on the mtd model .",
    "we do so by generalising the basic quasi - steady parametric approach of mtd , but discussing in section 5 issues concerning the properties of that description in relation to other theoretical and observational work on the problem .",
    "the mtd paper was really the first to model the combined effects of field and rotation but several earlier papers had discussed disk formation by magnetic channeling @xcite , while work subsequent to mtd has variously challenged it @xcite , and supported it @xcite .",
    "insofar as there remains a degree of disagreement in the literature over whether the model works for be stars , our detailed results should be treated with some caution , though the general trends of the effect of gravity darkening should be sound .",
    "@xcite showed that the mass flux from a stellar surface satisfies @xmath13 while the terminal speed satisfies @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the local effective gravity .    on a rotating sphere with stellar radius @xmath16 and angular velocity @xmath17 , at colatitude @xmath18 ,",
    "the nett gravity is @xmath19 where @xmath20 as in mtd . strictly speaking",
    ", we should also include the effect of continuum scattering radiation pressure at least , which results in @xmath21 , where @xmath22 is the ratio of the stellar luminosity to the eddington luminosity @xcite .",
    "it follows that the mass flux at @xmath18 becomes @xmath23 where @xmath24 is a constant , and the terminal speed for matter from @xmath18 is @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the value of @xmath27 at @xmath28 .    here",
    "we will assume the wind velocity obeys @xmath29 , but with @xmath30 where @xmath9 is assumed not to depend on @xmath18 .",
    "this basically requires that wind acceleration occurs quite near the star and that the field lines are roughly radial there .",
    "we want to express @xmath24 in terms of the total mass loss rate @xmath2 @xmath31    so by equation ( [ mf1 ] ) , @xmath32 to relate this mass flux at @xmath18 on the stellar surface to that normal to the equatorial plane at distance @xmath33 , we follow @xcite in parametrizing the decline of magnetic field , @xmath34 , with equatorial plane distance according to @xmath35 where @xmath36 is taken as uniform over , and normal to , the stellar surface , and @xmath37 is a constant with a dipole field @xmath38 .",
    "flux conservation then requires that a cross - sectional area @xmath39 of a flux tube arriving at the equator is related to its area @xmath40 at the star by @xmath41 or @xmath42 however , @xmath43 and @xmath44 so that the relation between @xmath18 and @xmath45 is given by integrating @xmath46 , to yield @xmath47 requiring that @xmath48 for @xmath49 implies @xmath50 so that @xmath51 for the particular case @xmath38 ( the dipole case ) mainly discussed by @xcite , and which we focus on henceforth , this yields @xmath52 we can now obtain the mass flux @xmath53 at @xmath45 near the equatorial plane by using @xmath54 and using equations ( [ mf2 ] ) , ( [ area ] ) and ( [ cos ] ) , namely @xmath55\\},\\ ] ] while by equations ( [ vinfty ] ) , ( [ vwind ] ) and ( [ cos ] ) , the wind speed there is @xmath56\\}^{1/2},\\ ] ] and the arriving wind ram pressure @xmath57 is @xmath58\\}^{3/2}}{1 - 2s_o^2/3}. \\label { ramp}\\ ] ] the high density @xmath59 of cool , shock - compressed , disk ( wcd ) in the equatorial plane is then given as in the wcd model ( and in mtd ) by the isothermal disk ( sound speed @xmath60 ) pressure balance expression @xmath61 or by equation ( [ ramp ] ) @xmath62\\}^{3/2}}{1 - 2s_o^2/3}.               \\label { rhod}\\ ] ] here @xmath63 which is equivalent to @xmath64 in the mtd model .",
    "based on equation ( [ rhod ] ) , we can write the disk density allowing for rotational gravity darkening , compared to that neglecting it ( e.g. , mtd ) as @xmath65^{3/2}}{1 - 2s_o^2/3 }        \\label { psix}\\ ] ] with the property @xmath66 which is @xmath67 for all @xmath0 , and tends to 0 as @xmath4 .",
    "this is because the equatorial wind flow falls with increasing @xmath0 , reducing the inner disk compression . on the other hand , if we ( formally  see comments below in section 3 ) apply equation ( [ psix ] ) as @xmath68 we would get for the disk behavior @xmath69 this is always @xmath70 because the polar wind supply of mass to large , equatorial distances @xmath45 , is increased ( for fixed @xmath2 ) for large @xmath0 .",
    "also , as @xmath71 ( critical rotation ) we find @xmath72 which is @xmath70 at @xmath73 . in figs .",
    "[ rhodf ] and [ psif ] , we show @xmath74 and @xmath75 versus @xmath45 for various @xmath0 .",
    "[ rhodf ] shows the disk density to peak in the range @xmath76 for all @xmath0 , then to decrease rapidly with @xmath45 for all @xmath0 .",
    "we have seen that @xmath59 decreases and moves its maximum somewhat to larger @xmath45 values as @xmath0 increases .",
    "however , we need also to consider the extent of the disk , i.e. , the lower and upper boundaries of equation ( [ rhod ] ) in @xmath45 as limited by the magnetic field strength .",
    "while enhancement of @xmath77 locally enhances the local contribution per unit volume ( @xmath78 ) to the disk emission measure , it makes the material there harder to torque so that the extent of the disk is modified .",
    "in particular , for example , equation ( [ psiinfty ] ) is not valid in practice since the rapid decline in @xmath79 , as @xmath45 goes up , limits the torquing to a finite distance .    to estimate the effect of including rotational gravity darkening on observable disk properties , we need to assess the effect on the inner and outer disk boundaries .",
    "here we do so using a somewhat simpler treatment than that in mtd , namely what mtd termed the ` switch approximation ' . in this",
    ", the disk is taken to be rigidly torqued by the magnetic field ( i.e. , @xmath80 , where @xmath81 ) out to the distance where the magnetic energy density @xmath82 falls below the rotational kinetic energy density @xmath83 .",
    "we have then , by equation ( [ magnetic ] ) , @xmath84 and by equation ( [ rhod ] ) @xmath85\\}^{3/2}}{1 - 2s_o^2/3}.\\ ] ] so the outer disk boundary @xmath86 is given by setting @xmath87 .",
    "thus @xmath88 is the solution @xmath45 to @xmath89\\}^{3/2}}{1 - 2s_o^2/3}=\\frac { \\gamma^2}{s_o^2 } ,       \\label { xouter}\\ ] ] where @xmath90 is a measure of field energy compared to the disk gravitational energy .",
    "the inner disk boundary in the present approximation is simply the keplerian rotation distance ( c.f . , mtd ) @xmath91",
    "in figs .  [ xxf ] and [ thetaf ] , we show @xmath92 and @xmath93 versus @xmath0 for various @xmath94 values , and the corresponding colatitudes , on the stellar surface , of @xmath95 and @xmath88 in terms of equation ( [ cos ] ) . it turns out that these boundaries do not change greatly with @xmath0 once @xmath0 is larger than 0.2  0.3 , but change a lot with @xmath94 , and that the mass flux reaching the disk comes from a rather small range of colatitudes ( e.g. for @xmath96 , @xmath97 with @xmath98  see fig .  [ thetaf ] ) .",
    "mass flow from the pole ( small @xmath18 ) leaves the star as part of the wind while equatorial flow ( large @xmath18 ) does not achieve keplarian speed .    according to equation ( [ gamma ] ) ,",
    "@xmath94 is determined by the magnetic and gravitational fields . in order to make mass flux channeling and torquing possible",
    ", @xmath94 has to be substantially greater than unity . in terms of observations ,",
    "the magnetic fields of be stars are no larger than hundreds of gauss .",
    "hence , @xmath94 should probably be in the range of @xmath99 for be stars to meet this requirement . in figs .",
    "[ xxf ] and [ thetaf ] , we also see that for smaller @xmath94 , a larger @xmath0 is necessary for a disk ( clearly , the outer radius of the disk must be larger than the inner radius ) .",
    "these two figures also show that the gravity darkening has a small effect on the outer radius of the disk , which is within @xmath100 for appropriate @xmath94 and @xmath0 .",
    "similar outer boundaries have been derived for some stars using different disk models by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the detection of disks by polarization , infrared emission , and emission line strength is related to their mass and their emission measure which are proportional to @xmath101 and @xmath102 , respectively , where @xmath103 is the disk volume .",

    "[ partif ] and [ emf ] , we show the results of equations ( [ number ] ) and ( [ emissionmeasure ] ) for @xmath133 and @xmath134 together with those obtained when gravity darkening is ignored ( using same switch approximation ) . for the latter ,",

    "[ polf ] for the polarization which depends mainly on the disk electron scattering mass .",
    "the more the total number of particles in the disk , the stronger the polarization .",
    "if gravity darkening were neglected , one would get a large @xmath127 so a small @xmath141 , for a given observed polarization value @xmath124 ( equation [ pol ] ) .",
    "this would imply a smaller @xmath142 since @xmath143 , which implies an underestimation of the mass loss rate @xmath2 ( equation [ rhoo ] ) , if we ignore gravity darkening .",
    "the previous treatment is for fixed @xmath144 . in order to see the influence of the velocity law on the results , we tried various @xmath9 values for a given @xmath94 .",
    "[ xxbetaf ] shows that wind velocity law has minor effects on the disk boundaries and so does gravity darkening .",
    "[ partibetaf ] , [ embetaf ] and [ polbetaf ] show that slower winds ( i.e. , bigger @xmath9 values ) will lead to much smaller total number of particles , emission measure and polarization of the disk , as well as gravity darkening significantly decreases these disk properties . from the plots we see that , for small @xmath145 , the total number of particles , emission measure and polarization peaks shift slightly to larger rotation rate ( @xmath146 ) , while a statistical study of observation data indicates the most common @xmath147 @xcite which , in our interpretation , would favor small @xmath9 , i.e. , fairly fast acceleration of winds from the stellar surface . if individual disk detectability peaks for @xmath148 and actual detection peak for @xmath149 , either there is a bias / selection effect in operation @xcite , or there in an upward trend in the frequency distribution of @xmath0 values .",
    "it was noted in section 1 that the mtd model is phenomenological and parametric , and not a full solution to the physics equations .",
    "it is aimed , like all such models , at describing the main features of a system accurately enough to reproduce the essential physics but simple enough to facilitate ready incorporation of additional effects ( such as gravity darkening ) and comparisons with data .",
    "it is of course important to evaluate how well the mtd model describes the reality when compared with more complete solutions .",
    "a full and detailed comparison is beyond the scope of this paper but we summarise here the present status as we see it of the relation of mtd to recent analytic and numerical work on closely related problems .",
    "one of the earliest studies of the problem which found disk formation was that in a ` magnetospheric ' context was by @xcite .",
    "@xcite carried out numerical simulations of magnetised stellar winds with rather weak fields and found disk ` stagnation zones ' in the equatorial plane .",
    "@xcite studied non - rotating winds in dipole fields and found persistent equatorial disk structures around agb stars though with a steady throughput of mass leaking through the disk .",
    "@xcite conducted a detailed analytic study of the mtd situation and found that persistent disks are formed for quite small fields though he obtained somewhat tighter constraints than mtd on the relevant regimes of magnetic field and spin rate . in the mhd simulations of isothermal flow driven outward from a non - rotating star with dipole magnetic fields",
    ", @xcite found that the effect of magnetic fields in channeling stellar winds depends on the overall ratio of magnetic to flow kinetic energy density , ( as did mtd ) and obtained disk results with rather low fields .",
    "in contrast to all of these , in the @xcite conference paper , based on the same code as @xcite , the interpretation shifts somewhat and seems more negative about disk persistence .",
    "@xcite added rotation to their earlier work and concluded that no stable disk could form , with matter either falling back or bursting out after a modest number of flow times .",
    "in fact , the mhd code they used is incapable of handling the larger fields which mtd argued were required and which are recently in fact observed ( several hundred gauss ) in some be stars , so their numerical results are not that relevant . furthermore , given that observed fields are strong enough so that the wind is bound to be steered and torqued to the equatorial regions , if the behaviour of that matter were highly unstable as ud - doula and owocki s simulation results , we should observe very frequent be star disk disruption , which we do not .",
    "in fact we see no reason why material should fall back , given that it is centrifugally supported , until the dipole structure fills up .",
    "this takes a very large number of flow times ( many years ) - hence the the quasi - steady formulation in mtd . in the case of weak fields and low rotation ,",
    "fall back and burst out of matter is not altogether surprising , but it is not clear why the @xcite simulation results conflict with those of others . for stronger fields using order of magnitude scaling estimates , they found that disks , essentially like mtd can form and have gone on to develop scenarios for strong fields closely akin to mtd under the names magnetically rigid disk and magnetically confined wind shocked disk .",
    "they were , however , dismissive of the relevance of this to be - stars .",
    "this was not on the grounds of the physics of mtd but over the issue of whether a semi - rigid disk near co - rotation can be reconciled with observations of be - stars , specifically spectrum line shapes and the long term v / r variations .",
    "the work of @xcite suggests that the former is not a serious problem .",
    "the issue of the v / r variations was emphasised in the original mtd paper which recognised that , if mtd is the correct description of be disk formation , a close examination is required of how the v / r variations could arise . at first sight",
    "it would seem that the conventional interpretation in terms of spiral density waves ( induced by the non  spherical potential ) in a keplerian disk would not work if the field controlled the disk and another interpretation would have to be found but it depends on the rate of viscous diffusive redistribution of disk matter toward keplerian @xcite . until further testing is carried out we are therefore of the view that the mtd model remains a good basic scheme for further modelling work .",
    "we also note that , when mtd is applied across the range of hot star spectral types , it offers a remarkably good explanation of the narrow spectral range where disks are in fact detected .",
    "no other model offers any explanation of this observation .",
    "we have discussed the phenomenological magnetically torqued disk ( mtd ) model of @xcite for hot ( particularly be ) star disk formation in relation to other work on magnetically steered wind creation of disk like structures , concluding that , for moderate fields comparable to those observed , the description is physically realistic but that further work is needed to see if its disk velocity structure can be reconciled with observations including line profiles and v / r variations .",
    "we have recognised that the basic model did not recognise the effect of spin induced gravity darkening on the latitudinal distribution of wind flow and consequently on disk density structure .",
    "we have included this effect and found that , although increasing @xmath0 from zero favors disk formation , at high @xmath0 the polar shift in mass flux results in decreasing disk detectability by emission or polarization . the fact that detectability ( say above half of the height of the peak values of emission and polarization in figs .",
    "[ emf ] , [ polf ] , [ embetaf ] , and [ polbetaf ] ) covers quite broad rotation range in @xmath0 , namely @xmath150 , is generally in good agreement with the fact that be star rotation rates are typically estimated to occur most frequently near 0.7 ( e.g. , @xcite , and references therein ; @xcite ) , which tends to favour fast acceleration velocity laws .",
    "overall this means that in the mtd model , the most easily observable disks are , contrary to naive expectation , not expected from the fastest rotators , but from moderate ones , as observed , though we note the @xcite comments on the effect of gravity darkening in inferring underestimated line width rotation rates .",
    "clearly the whole mtd scenario needs further work to test it thoroughly , including reconciliation of the phenomenology , numerical mhd , and analytic mhd theoretical treatments and work on further diagnostics such as x - ray emission from the mtd deceleration shocks of be stars for comparison with @xmath151 and other x - ray datasets .",
