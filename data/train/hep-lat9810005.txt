    "the fundamental theory of the strong interactions , quantum chromodynamics ( qcd ) , is a nonperturbative field - theory in which the self - coupling of the gauge field leads to a nontrivial vacuum structure .",
    "the complexity of the qcd vacuum is manifest in nonvanishing vacuum expectation values of quark and gluon operator products having vacuum quantum numbers .",
    "the only known way to directly calculate the properties of qcd is through the formulation of a lattice gauge theory where the fields are described on a discrete space - time lattice .",
    "the lattice formulation of qcd is well established @xcite .",
    "recent advances in lattice action improvement on anisotropic lattices are greatly facilitating the reduction of systematic uncertainties associated with the finite lattice volume and the finite lattice spacing .",
    "however , direct simulation of qcd for light current quark masses , near the chiral limit , remains computationally intensive .",
    "as such , the present approach of calculating the properties of qcd using quark masses away from the chiral regime and extrapolating to the physical world is likely to persist for the foreseeable future .",
    "the difficulty associated with this approach is illustrated by the rapid rise of the pseudoscalar mass for small increases in the quark mass away from the chiral limit as governed by @xmath3 where @xmath4 denotes a light quark .",
    "typical quark masses considered in lattice simulations place @xmath5 mev , a value significantly larger than the physical pion mass , @xmath6 mev . a mass the order of 500 mev is sufficient to largely suppress the pion cloud contribution to hadronic observables , whereas near the chiral limit",
    ", the pion cloud can make a significant contribution to them@xcite .",
    "hence it is imperative to extrapolate any observable simulated on the lattice to the physical world using a function motivated by the physics of the pion cloud .",
    "since the pion cloud contributions are small in lattice simulations , one has to look beyond the lattice simulation results at present .",
    "historically , lattice results were often linearly extrapolated with respect to @xmath7 to the chiral limit , particularly in exploratory calculations .",
    "more recently the focus has turned to chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath0pt ) , which provides predictions for the leading nonanalytic quark - mass dependence of observables in terms of phenomenological parameters .",
    "application of @xmath0pt to the extrapolation of lattice simulation data is now standard for hadron masses and decay constants @xcite .",
    "however , earlier attempts @xcite to apply @xmath0pt predictions for the quark - mass dependence of baryon magnetic moments failed , as the higher order terms of the chiral expansion quickly dominate the truncated expansion as one moves away from the chiral limit . to one meson loop , @xmath0pt expresses the nucleon magnetic moments as @xcite @xmath8 where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are fitted phenomenologically and @xmath11 and @xmath12 are predicted by @xmath0pt .",
    "the @xmath13 term quickly dominates as @xmath14 moves away from the chiral limit making contact with the lattice results untenable .",
    "lattice qcd results for baryon magnetic moments @xcite remain predominantly based on linear quark mass ( or @xmath7 ) extrapolations of the moments expressed in natural magnetons .",
    "this approach systematically underestimates the measured moments by 10 to 20% .",
    "finite lattice volume and spacing errors are expected to be some source of systematic error .",
    "however , @xmath0pt clearly indicates the linear extrapolation of the simulation results is also suspect . as such , it is imperative to find a method which can bridge the void between the realm of @xmath0pt and lattice simulations .",
    "we report such a method , which provides predictions for the quark mass ( or @xmath7 ) dependence of nucleon magnetic moments well beyond the chiral limit .",
    "in particular , we use the cloudy bag model ( cbm ) , which involves a relativistic quark model ( the mit bag ) coupled to the pion field in such a way as to restore chiral symmetry @xcite .",
    "the corresponding pion loop corrections to physical observables reproduce the leading non - analytic behavior of @xmath0pt .",
    "however , the loop which gives rise to the leading non - analytic behavior involves two pion propagators .",
    "because the loop is regulated by a form factor , related to the finite size of the hadron , its contribution is suppressed like @xmath15 as @xmath14 becomes large .",
    "this feature makes it possible to address the larger quark masses simulated in lattice qcd in a convergent way .    with some tuning of the bag radius , the form factor at the @xmath16 vertex and the current quark mass , within the framework of the cbm",
    ", we find that it is possible to reproduce the lattice qcd simulations of nucleon magnetic moments and smoothly extrapolate to the experimentally measured values .",
    "we then propose a simple phenomenological relation designed to reproduce the leading nonanalytic structure of @xmath0pt and provide the dirac - moment mass dependence in the heavy quark - mass regime .",
    "finally , we illustrate how such a relation can be used in future lattice qcd calculations .",
    "these results may also be useful in clarifying issues surrounding the higher order terms of the chiral expansion of @xmath0pt .",
    "we consider two independent lattice simulations of the nucleon electromagnetic form factors .",
    "both calculations employ three - point function based techniques @xcite utilizing the conserved vector current such that no renormalization is required in relating the lattice results to the continuum . ref .",
    "@xcite utilizes twenty - eight quenched gauge configurations on a @xmath17 periodic lattice at @xmath18 , corresponding to a lattice spacing of 0.128(10 ) fm .",
    "moments are obtained from the form factors at 0.16 gev@xmath19 by assuming equivalent @xmath20 dependencies for the electric and magnetic form factors . ref .",
    "@xcite utilizes twelve quenched gauge configurations on a @xmath21 periodic lattice at @xmath22 .",
    "the nucleon mass @xcite corresponds to a lattice spacing of 0.091(3 ) fm .",
    "moments are obtained from dipole fits to the form factors .",
    "uncertainties are statistical in origin and are estimated by a single elimination jackknife @xcite . despite having different lattice volumes and lattice spacings ,",
    "the results from the two calculations agree well within errors .",
    "however , experience suggests that the lattice spacings and volumes used in these investigations may give rise to scaling violations and finite size effects the order of 15 to 20% from the infinite volume continuum limit .",
    "ideally , one would like to perform the analysis of chiral corrections , using results from full qcd , as opposed to quenched qcd .",
    "unfortunately , such results are not yet available .",
    "instead we will utilize these results under the standard approach of correcting the lattice scale by fixing the lattice spacing using the nucleon mass . in the absence of any known way to correct for the nonperturbative effects of quenching",
    ", we will assume that these lattice results are a reasonable representation of full qcd .",
    "since the quark masses simulated on the lattice are somewhat heavy , the dominant contributions from quark loops neglected in the quenched approximation are largely perturbative and accounted for in the renormalization of the lattice spacing .",
    "as we shall see , the errors due to quenching are likely the same order of magnitude as the statistical uncertainties .",
