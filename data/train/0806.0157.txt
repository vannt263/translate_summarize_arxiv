    "random matrices of infinite dimensions represent a very rich and interesting subject of studies that relates various branches of mathematical physics , analysis , combinatorics and many others .",
    "the spectral theory of large random matrices started half a century ago by is still a source of interesting and challenging problems .",
    "an important part of these problems concerns the universality conjecture for the local spectral properties of ensembles of large real symmetric ( or hermitian ) matrices ( see e.g. the monograph @xcite ) .",
    "one of the examples of such ensembles is given by the wigner ensemble of @xmath1 real symmetric random matrices of the form @xmath8 where @xmath9 are jointly independent random variables such that the following conditions are verified @xmath10 where @xmath11 denotes the mathematical expectation .",
    "e. wigner proved that the moments of @xmath12 converge in the limit @xmath13 @xmath14 under conditions that all moments of all @xmath15 exist and the probability distribution of random variables @xmath15 is symmetric @xcite .    to study the moments ( 1.3 ) , e. wigner has interpreted the trace of the product @xmath16 as the weighted sum over all possible sequences @xmath17 @xcite .",
    "the set of these sequences can be separated into classes of equivalence that in the case of even @xmath18 can be labelled by simple non - negative walks of @xmath19 steps @xmath20 that start and end at zero .",
    "these walks are known as the dyck paths and the catalan number @xmath21 standing in ( 1.3 ) represents the number of all dyck paths with @xmath19 steps . obviously , @xmath22 due to the symmetric distribution of random variables @xmath15 and it is sufficient to consider the even moments @xmath23 only .",
    "the method proposed by e. wigner has been used as the starting point in the studies of the asymptotic behavior of variables @xmath24 in the limit when @xmath25 goes to infinity at the same time as @xmath26 does @xcite .",
    "in particular , it was shown in the beginning of 80-s that the estimate @xmath27 is true when @xmath28 as @xmath13 provided random variables @xmath29 are bounded with probability 1 and their probability distribution is symmetric @xcite .",
    "the method of @xcite uses certain encoding of the paths @xmath30 additionally to the dyck paths representation .",
    "more precisely , the graph theory approach has been developed in @xcite , where , in particular , the dyck paths @xmath20 are considered as the canonical runs over the plane rooted trees @xmath31 of @xmath32 vertices .",
    "regarding the problem of estimates of high moments of large random matrices , it is important to determine the maximally possible rate of @xmath33 such that ( 1.5 ) is still valid . here",
    "a breakthrough step was made in paper @xcite , where ( 1.5 ) was shown to be true for all @xmath34 , @xmath13 in the case when the moments of random variables @xmath15 are of the sub - gaussian form and the probability distribution of @xmath15 is symmetric .",
    "also the central limit theorem for the random variable @xmath35 was proved in this limit .",
    "it was shown that the limiting expressions for the corresponding correlation functions do not depend on the particular values of the moments of @xmath15 .",
    "this was a first step toward the proof of the universality conjecture for the wigner ensembles .",
    "it should be stressed that in these studies the estimate ( 1.5 ) represents a key result that is crucial for the proof of the central limit theorem .",
    "the proof of @xcite is based on the wigner s approach added by an important notion of the self - intersection of the sequence @xmath30 ; in @xcite these sequences are called the paths of @xmath19 steps . in certain sense ,",
    "the self - intersections of the path from the class @xmath20 correspond to gluing of the vertices of the corresponding tree @xmath36 .",
    "then the self - intersection degree of a vertex can be determined as a number of arrivals to this vertex by the edges of this tree . in @xcite ,",
    "the set of all paths has been separated into the classes of equivalence according to the number of vertices of self - intersections and the self - intersection degrees of these vertices .",
    "this gives the tools to control the number of paths in the limit @xmath37 .",
    "this method was modified in the subsequent paper @xcite to prove that ( 1.5 ) is valid in the limit . here",
    "the family of self - intersections has been further classified and the notion of the open vertex of two - fold self - intersection has been considered for the first time . the next in turn step has been made in @xcite to show that an estimate of the form ( 1.5 ) is true in the limit @xmath38 under the same conditions on the probability distribution of @xmath15 as in @xcite .",
    "the technique of @xcite was further developed in paper @xcite , where the case of arbitrary distributed random variables @xmath15 with symmetric law of polynomial decay was considered .",
    "it was indicated in @xcite that certain estimate of @xcite was not established in the full extent and a way was proposed to complete the proof .",
    "however , the way proposed in @xcite is partly correct and the proof of corresponding estimate suffers in its own turn from a serious gap .",
    "let us briefly explain the problem .",
    "following @xcite , it was assumed in @xcite that for the paths with typical @xmath20 the presence of vertices with large number of steps `` out '' is possible only when there is a sufficiently large number of steps `` in '' ; here the steps `` in '' and `` out '' are meant to be the steps that correspond to the ascending steps of @xmath20",
    ". however , this is not the case .",
    "the walk can arrive at a given vertex @xmath4 by the steps that correspond to the descend parts of the dyck path @xmath20 and bring to @xmath4 the edges that do not belong the ascending steps `` in '' .",
    "we call these edges the imported ones and refer to the corresponding arriving steps as to the imported cells . at the end of this paper",
    ", we present examples of paths with a number of imported cells and edges .",
    "we see that the description of the family of paths @xmath39 of ( 1.4 ) should be improved .",
    "this is the main subject of the present work .",
    "we will see that the studies require a number of generalizations of the notions introduced in @xcite .",
    "in particular , the notion of the open vertex of two - fold self - intersection should be generalized for the case of self - intersections of any degree .",
    "also the further analysis of the open instants of self - intersections leads us to the notion of the instant of broken tree structure .",
    "it plays even more important role with respect to the estimates of the moments @xmath24 than that played by the open vertices of self - intersections .",
    "clearly , these new circumstances require essential modifications of the technique proposed by @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we repeat some of the definitions of notions introduced @xcite and @xcite and formulate generalizations of them we need",
    ". then we present our main result about the primary and imported cells .",
    "namely , we prove that the number of imported cells at given vertex @xmath4 is determined by the self - intersection degree of @xmath4 and by the total number of broken tree instants of the path .",
    "we show that the number of the instants of broken tree structure is bounded by the number of open arrival instants and this finally gives us a tool to control the number of paths that have vertices of large degree .",
    "the descriptive part given by section 2 is followed by section 3 , where the principles of construction of the set of walks and corresponding estimates are described .",
    "here we mainly follow the lines of @xcite with necessary modifications and specifications . in section 4",
    "we prove estimates of the form ( 1.5 ) of the averaged traces @xmath40 .",
    "our main result concern the case when the matrix entries are given by bounded random variables @xmath15 .",
    "the reason for this restriction is two - fold .",
    "first , this helps us not to overload the paper and to present clearer the key points of the technique used . from another side",
    ", the description of classes of paths and walks in terms of vertices of self - intersections does not fit very well the problem of counting the number of multiple edges in the graphs of these paths and walks . as a result ,",
    "the technique described can be applied to wider classes of random variables @xmath15 while the optimal conditions are far to be reached . at the end of the paper",
    "we prove one of the possible results in this direction , where we require that a finite number of moments exist , @xmath41 , @xmath42 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we consider several examples of the walks with primary and imported cells and show why the estimates of @xcite do not work in the corresponding cases .",
    "as we mentioned above , it is natural to consider ( 1.4 ) as the sum of weights @xmath43 where the sequence @xmath44 can be regarded a trajectory of @xmath19 steps @xmath45 and @xmath46 denotes the set of all such trajectories ; the weight @xmath47 is given by the average of the product of corresponding random variables @xmath15 . here and below we omit subscripts in @xmath33 when they are not necessary . in papers",
    "@xcite the sequences @xmath30 are referred as to the _ paths _ , so we keep this terminology in the present paper .    in the present section",
    "we study the paths @xmath30 and their graphs and describe partitions of the set @xmath48 into the classes of equivalence according to the self - intersection properties of @xmath30 . to do this",
    ", we give necessary definitions based on those of @xcite and consider their generalizations .",
    "then we prove our main technical result about the paths with primary and imported cells .      in ( 2.2 ) , it is convenient to consider the subscripts of @xmath49 as the instants of the discrete time . introducing variable @xmath50",
    ", we write that @xmath51 .",
    "we will also say that the couple @xmath52 with @xmath53 represents the step number @xmath54 of the path @xmath30 .",
    "we determine the set of vertices visited by the path @xmath30 up to the instant @xmath54 @xmath55 and denote by @xmath56 its cardinality .    regarding a particular path @xmath30 , one can introduce corresponding _ closed walk _",
    "@xmath57 , @xmath58 that is given by a sequence of @xmath19 labels ( say , numbers from @xmath59 or letters ) .",
    "also we can determine the _ minimal closed walk _",
    "@xmath60 constructed from @xmath30 by the following recurrence rules : 1 ) at the origin of time , @xmath61 ; 2 ) if @xmath62 , then @xmath63 ;    0.45 cm if there exists such @xmath64 that @xmath65 , then @xmath66 .",
    "ne can interpret @xmath67 as a path of @xmath19 steps , where the number of each new label is given by the number of different labels used before increased by one .",
    "the following sequences @xmath68 give an example of the closed path @xmath30 with @xmath69 and of the corresponding minimal walk @xmath70 .",
    "the set of all possible paths @xmath71 can be separated into the classes of equivalence @xmath72 labelled by the minimal walks @xmath73 .",
    "we say that @xmath30 and @xmath74 are equivalent , @xmath75 when @xmath76 . in what follows",
    ", we consider the minimal walks only , so we omit the subscript @xmath77 in @xmath73 and write simply that @xmath78 .    regarding a minimal closed walk of @xmath19 steps @xmath2 , one can consider the _ graph of the walk _",
    "@xmath79 with the set of vertices @xmath80 and the set of oriented edges @xmath81 ; sometimes we will write that @xmath82 .",
    "it is natural to accept equality @xmath83 .",
    "we denote the vertices @xmath3 with the help of the greek letters @xmath84 . given a walk @xmath2",
    ", one can reconstruct the paths from @xmath85 by assigning to the vertices of @xmath3 different values from the set @xmath86 .",
    "this procedure will be considered in more details in section 3 .",
    "let us determine @xmath81 .",
    "the edge @xmath87 is present in @xmath81 if and only if there exists an instant @xmath54 , @xmath88 such that @xmath89 and @xmath90 . in this case",
    "we will write that @xmath91 . if @xmath92 is the instant of the first arrival to @xmath4 , we say that the vertex @xmath4 and the edge @xmath93 are created at the instant @xmath92 .",
    "in general , the graph @xmath3 is a _ multigraph _ because the couple @xmath94 can be connected by several edges of @xmath81 ; these could be oriented as @xmath93 or @xmath95 .",
    "we will denote by @xmath96 corresponding non - oriented edges .",
    "we can easily pass to the graph @xmath97 , where the set of non - oriented edges @xmath98 contains the couples @xmath99 such that @xmath100 and @xmath101 are joined by elements of @xmath102 . in this case",
    "we denote the corresponding element of @xmath98 by @xmath103 $ ] .    obviously , @xmath104 .",
    "we will say that the number of non - oriented edges @xmath105 determines the number of times that the walk @xmath2 passes the edge @xmath106 $ ] .",

    "as we have seen from ( 2.1 ) , the paths and the walks we consider are closed by definition , that is @xmath112 .",
    "there is another important restriction for the paths and walks we consider .",
    "it follows from the fact that the probability distribution of @xmath15 is symmetric : v@xmath113 the weight @xmath47 is non - zero if and only if each edge from @xmath114 is passed by @xmath2 an even number of times .",
    "v    in this case we will say that the path @xmath30 and the corresponding walk @xmath115 are _",
    "even_. we see that our studies concern the even closed paths and even closed walks only .",
    "then @xmath116 is always a multigraph and the following equality holds @xmath117    it should be noted that the requirement ( 2.3 ) concerns the case when random matrices @xmath12 are real symmetric . in the case of hermitian matrices corresponding condition is more restrictive and requires that each edge is passed an even number of times in the way that the numbers of `` there '' and `` back '' steps are equal .",
    "we will call such walks as the double - even walks .",
    "it is easy to see that all definitions and statements of the present section do not change when switching from the even to the double - even walks . in the present paper",
    ", we do not consider the case of hermitian matrices in details .",
    "we denote by @xmath118 the set of all possible minimal even closed walks of @xmath19 steps .",
    "the next subsections are devoted to the further classification of its elements .",
    "given @xmath119 , we say that the instant of time @xmath54 with @xmath120 is _ marked _ if the walk has passed the edge @xmath121 $ ] with @xmath122 an odd number of times during the time interval @xmath123 $ ] , @xmath124 ; @xmath125        in this case we will also say that the step @xmath52 and the corresponding oriented edge @xmath126 are marked .",
    "other instants of time are referred to as the _ non - marked _ ones .    on figure 1",
    "we present an example of a minimal walk where the marked instants and corresponding edges are given in boldface .",
    "given a vertex @xmath4 of the graph @xmath116 , we determine the set of all marked steps @xmath127 such that @xmath128 .",
    "the set of corresponding edges of the form @xmath129 is called the _ exit cluster _ of @xmath4 ; we denote it by @xmath130 .",
    "the cardinality @xmath131 is called the exit degree of @xmath4 .",
    "if @xmath132 , then we will say that the exit cluster of @xmath4 is empty .",
    "each even closed walk @xmath2 generates a binary sequence @xmath133 of @xmath19 elements @xmath134 and @xmath135 that correspond to non - marked and marked instants , respectively .",
    "it is clear that @xmath20 represents path of @xmath19 steps known as the dyck path @xcite .",
    "we denote by @xmath136 the set of all dyck paths of @xmath19 steps .    given @xmath137 , let us denote by @xmath138 the marked instants of time such that @xmath139 .",
    "we call @xmath140 the _ marked arrival instants _ at @xmath4 .",
    "the _ non - marked arrival instants _ at @xmath4 are defined in obvious manner .",
    "we will also say that the step @xmath141 and the corresponding edge @xmath142 are the _ arrival step _ at @xmath4 and the _ arrival edge _ at @xmath4 , respectively . if @xmath143 , then the corresponding vertex is called the vertex of simple self - intersection @xcite .",
    "if @xmath144 , then we say that @xmath4 is the vertex of @xmath145-fold self - intersection and that the self - intersection degree of @xmath146 is equal to @xmath145 ; we denote the self - intersection degree of @xmath147 by @xmath148 .",
    "as it is mentioned in @xcite , one has to consider the origin of time @xmath149 as the marked instant of time .",
    "this is needed to include the walks of the form @xmath150 with @xmath151 and only one marked arrival @xmath152 into the family of walks with self - intersections .",
    "let us note that such `` hidden '' marked instants of time can differ from @xmath149 and can be numerous .",
    "for example , this happens each time when the walk returns at its origin with all of the existing edges closed .",
    "summing up , we accept that @xmath153 for any @xmath154 .",
    "0.3 cm    the following definition generalizes the notion of the open vertex of ( simple ) self - intersection introduced in @xcite and used in @xcite and @xcite .",

    "the instant @xmath54 can be also called the open instant of self - intersection .",
    "correspondingly , one can define the @xmath54-open vertex @xmath4 of self - intersection of the walk @xmath2 .",
    "definition 2.1 remains valid in the case when @xmath163 coincides with @xmath164 , more precisely in the case when there exists another marked instant @xmath165 such that @xmath166 and the graph @xmath3 has a loop at the vertex @xmath146 .",
    "definition 2.1 is also valid in the case when @xmath167 .",
    "both of the definitions of the open vertex of self - intersection @xcite and the open arrival instant are based on the following property : the walk , when arrived at @xmath4 at such a marked instant , has more than one possibility to continue its way with the non - marked step . in the opposite case , when the only one continuation with the non - marked step is possible , we say that the arrival instant is closed .",
    "a vertex of a walk can change the property to be closed or open several times during the run of the walk . on figure 1",
    "we present an example of the walk where two instants of self - intersection are open ( these are @xmath168 and @xmath169 ) and one instant of self - intersection @xmath170 is closed .",
    "regarding the simple self - intersections only , we see that the coincides with the definition of the open vertex of simple self - intersection formulated first in @xcite and then used in @xcite .",
    "however , the definition of the open vertex of simple self - intersection presented in @xcite slightly differs from that of @xcite . in @xcite , the vertex @xmath4 of the simple self - intersection at the marked instant @xmath54",
    "is called the open one when the edge @xmath93 of the first arrival to @xmath4 is not used again up to the instant @xmath54 , while in @xcite only returns in the direction @xmath95 are prohibited .",
    "looking at the figure 1 , we see that @xmath171 is the open vertex of the self - intersection at the instant @xmath169 according to the definition of @xcite , and is not the open vertex according to the definition of @xcite",
    ". however , as we will see later , this slight divergence in definitions does not alter much the estimates one obtains ( see subsection 3.4 ) .      given a walk @xmath2 ,",
    "let us consider the following procedure of reduction that we denote by @xmath172 : find an instant of time @xmath173 such that the step @xmath52 is marked and @xmath174 ; if it exists , consider a new walk @xmath175 determined by a sequence @xmath176 performing this procedure once more , we get @xmath177 .",

    "@xmath261      in the previous subsections we have described the construction of all walks with the same @xmath20 that have closed and open instants of simple and triple self - intersections .",
    "this is important for the estimate of number of walks because the instants of the open self - intersections leave a certain freedom for the walk to continue its run at the non - marked instants of time .",
    "this run can differ from the canonical run of the walk according to the tree structure dictated by the corresponding @xmath20 .",
    "so , the open self - intersection represent a potential possibility to choose the canonical run or the non - canonical run at the non - marked instants of time .",
    "the arrival instants followed by the non - canonical continuation are the bts - instants considered in section 2 .",
    "the bts - instants are important when counting the number of imported cells at one or another vertex of the walk .",

    "below we present one of the possible examples .",
    "regarding the walk @xmath865 with @xmath866 steps depicted on figure 4 , we see that the marked instants are given by the instants of time @xmath867 and the vertex @xmath4 is the vertex of the self - intersection degree 1 .",

    "regarding the walks @xmath885 with arbitrarily large @xmath889 , we see that the expression @xmath890 of goes out of the control in the limit of large @xmath25 because it can not be suppressed by the factor of the form @xmath891 with @xmath892 , @xmath887 .    from another hand ,",
    "the trees @xmath893 are such that for any value of @xmath889 there is no vertices in @xmath893 with the exit degree greater than @xmath894 .",
    "this situation is possible because the groups of three edges are imported at @xmath4 from different parts of the tree @xmath699 ; freely expressed , these edges grow in @xmath895 from imported cells .",
    "as we have seen in section 2 , the presence of the imported cells is possible due to the presence of bts - instants in the walk .",
