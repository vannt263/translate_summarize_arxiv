    "an _ euler elastica _ or _",
    "elastic curve _ is the solution to the variational problem of minimizing the bending energy , the integral of the curvature squared @xmath0 , among curves of a given length with fixed endpoints and with the tangents prescribed at the endpoints .",
    "all solutions to this problem were described by euler @xcite in 1744 , and the curves can be parameterized in terms of elliptic functions .    the energy minimizing property qualifies the elastica as a mathematical model for the shape assumed by a thin inextensible rod when constraints are place only at the endpoints .",
    "this shape appears naturally in certain manufacturing scenarios : for example in a construction made from thin , flexible strips of wood or similar , the shape of each strip , between the fixed points , is an elastica . in another application",
    ", a thin metal blade can be heated and used to cut polystyrene for architectural formwork , the blade changing its shape during the motion .",
    "this permits the construction of curved geometries potentially much more cheaply than with the alternative of numerically controlled milling ; this article is part of a larger project dedicated to the development of this so - called _ robotic hot - blade cutting _ technology @xcite . here ,",
    "too , the shape of the blade is an elastica .",
    "the present standard representation for curves and surfaces in computer - aided design ( cad ) systems is _ rational _ splines , that is , piecewise rational functions . in architecture",
    "there is typically a second step after the initial conceptual design , whereby the cad model is adapted slightly for practical realization with respect to the chosen manufacturing process , and this is called _",
    "rationalization_. the problem of rationalizing a standard cad design for a construction method involving elastic curves entails the approximation of a rational or polynomial spline curve by an elastica , and it is this problem that motivates us here .",
    "it is worth noting that the term `` spline '' , in pre - cad years , referred to a thin strip of wood used to draw curves that interpolate a given set of points smoothly . between the interpolation points ,",
    "these strips assumed the shapes of elastica , or rather _ planar _ elastica , because the strips were laid on a flat surface .",
    "thus , for the type of rationalization referred to above , one could say that the task is , somewhat ironically , to approximate a digital spline with an analogue spline .    with this in mind , we consider here the problem of approximating an arbitrary curve by a planar elastica .",
    "+ * precursors : * quite distinctly from the applications mentioned above , elastic curves are a good candidate for the choice of functions used in geometric modeling because their curvature minimizing property makes them optimally faired .",
    "the idea of using them as mathematical splines  here meaning piecewise smooth functions  has been discussed by many authors : for example the references @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite and @xcite constitute a representative , though not an exhaustive , list .",
    "these works are concerned either with the problem of how to compute the elastic curve satisfying various constraints respecting placement of endpoints , end - tangents , lengths etc . , or with such problems as the existence of an elastic curve interpolating a given set of points .",
    "as a testament to the importance of these curves , one finds that many aspects of the theory are re - derived independently several times .    for our purpose , however , the main point is that previous work on elastica and their applications in spline theory does not consider the problem of approximating an arbitrary curve by an elastica . +",
    "* outline of this article : * we first make use of the analytic solutions , which were derived in 1880 by l.  saalschtz @xcite , to give a representation of the space of elastic curve segments . the space depends real analytically on seven control parameters , and one can therefore , in principle , use gradient driven optimization software to achieve an approximation .",
    "the challenge is that the result of this non - convex nonlinear optimization depends very much on the initial guess , as illustrated in figure  [ fig : init_guesses ] .",
    "= 0.25    the optimization approach can only deliver a useable approximation algorithm if a means of choosing a good _ initial _ elastic curve is found .",
    "our solution is to use the fact that the curvature function for an arc - length parameterized elastica is _ affine _ in a certain direction .",
    "we first show , in section [ sec : elastic - parameters ] , how to use this fact to recover the seven control parameters  in a numerically stable manner  from a given elastic curve segment .",
    "we can then ( section [ sec : approximating ] ) apply essentially the same procedure to an _ arbitrary _ @xmath1 plane curve to obtain a canonical elastic curve segment that , with respect to the global geometric characteristics selected for in the procedure , is close to the given curve .",
    "the canonical initial guess can then be taken as input for an optimization package to compute a good approximating elastic curve for a given curve , provided a good solution exists .",
    "we illustrate the results of the overall algorithm on a sample of bzier curves  some of which are close to elastica and some of which are not  with endpoints free ( figure [ fig : opt1 ] ) and fixed ( figure [ fig : opt2 ] ) .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] , we discuss applications of this method to the problem of approximating curves by _ piecewise _ elastic spline curves and ongoing work on applications in manufacturing .",
    "here is a brief sketch of the equations defining planar elastica .",
    "more details , background and references can be found in @xcite .",
    "let @xmath2\\to{{\\mathbb r}}^2 $ ] be a plane curve segment parameterized by arclength .",
    "let @xmath3 denote the _ tangent angle _ , defined by the equation @xmath4 .",
    "then a curve segment of length @xmath5 starting at @xmath6 and ending at @xmath7 satisfies @xmath8 and @xmath9 .",
    "let @xmath10 denote the curvature @xmath11 .",
    "an _ elastica _ is a minimizer , among curves with the same endpoints and end tangents , of the _ bending energy _",
    "suppose @xmath13 is an elastica from @xmath6 to @xmath7 with angle function @xmath14 , and consider the perturbed curve @xmath15 with angle function @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a differentiable function with @xmath18 . applying the method of lagrange multipliers to the bending energy , we set : @xmath19 and we require that @xmath20 since @xmath17 was arbitrary , it follows that @xmath14 satisfies the euler - lagrange equation @xmath21",
    "setting @xmath22 , with @xmath23 , this becomes @xmath24 .",
    "note that @xmath25 if and only if @xmath10 is constant , i.e.  the curve @xmath13 is either a straight line segment or a piece of a circle .",
    "if @xmath26 , set @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the rotation by angle @xmath29 . then @xmath30 is also an elastica with tangent angle @xmath31 satisfying the normalized pendulum equation @xmath32 . in summary :    up to a scaling and rotation of the ambient space , all arclength parameterized elastica @xmath33 \\to { { \\mathbb r}}^2 $ ] , with non - constant curvature @xmath10 , can be expressed as : @xmath34 , where @xmath35      we now want to define some suitable control parameters to describe an arbitrary elastic curve segment .",
    "essentially , the parameters need to specify which solution to is involved , the start and endpoints on the solution curve in question , and a rotation and scaling .",
    "the elastic curves can be expressed in closed form via the elliptic functions ( see appendix  [ sec : app_elliptic ] ) .",
    "the formulas can be found in love @xcite .",
    "there are two classes of elastica : curves with inflection points ( i.e. points where @xmath36 ) and curves without inflections .",
    "the solution to starting at @xmath37 with initial angle @xmath38 and @xmath39 is @xmath40 where @xmath41 . for @xmath42",
    "we get inflectional elastica ; for @xmath43 , we use the _ extended _ elliptic functions defined in appendix  [ sec : app_elliptic ] to obtain elastic curves without inflections .",
    "we reserve the name @xmath44 for these basic elastica .",
    "figure [ fig : elas_pic ] shows elastic curves for different values of @xmath45 .",
    "all elastica are obtained by scaling and rotating these curves .",
    "the periodicity of the curves is given by : @xmath46 where @xmath47 the quarter - period defined in appendix  [ sec : app_elliptic ] .    .",
    "the curves are scaled to a uniform  height \" . ]      to parameterize an arbitrary segment of an elastica , we can choose a segment of a basic elastica by choosing @xmath45 , a starting point @xmath48 and an endpoint @xmath49 , where @xmath50 .",
    "it will be convenient to remove the dependence on @xmath48 and @xmath5 from the domain and include them in the parameterization .",
    "we parameterize the elastica segments on the unit interval , setting @xmath51 , with @xmath52 $ ] .",
    "the new curve parameter @xmath53 is not unit speed .",
    "finally , any elastica segment can be obtained by introducing a scaling factor @xmath54 , a rotation by an angle @xmath55 $ ] and translation by a vector @xmath6 .",

    ", the elastica with opposite orientation can be obtained by a rotation by @xmath60 . in this case",
    "we may therefore assume @xmath61 without loss of generality .",
    "for elastica _ without _ inflections , however , a segment with @xmath59 can not be described as a segment with @xmath61 .",
    "one can instead reverse the direction of the parameterization for that case , and so all cases can be handled with the assumption @xmath61 .    for any elastic curve @xmath13 of the above type ,",
    "the curve @xmath62 is unit speed .",
    "letting @xmath14 and @xmath63 denote the angle functions of @xmath44 and @xmath64 , respectively , we have @xmath65 , and thus @xmath66 so the angle function for @xmath64 satisfies with @xmath67    we will also use the fact that the curvature for the elastica @xmath68 is @xmath69",
    "we first describe a way to calculate numerically the control parameters of a given planar elastic curve segment . in the next section",
    "the same recipe will be applied to an arbitrary planar curve to obtain a canonical first guess for an approximating elastic curve .",
    "the main idea is to exploit the fact that the curvature of an elastica is an affine function of the distance along a special direction .",
    "let @xmath70\\to{{\\mathbb r}}^2 $ ] be an elastic curve parameterized by arclength .",
    "as for any planar curve , we can write the tangent and the normal as @xmath71 , @xmath72 , and we have the frenet - serret equations @xmath73 the tangent angle @xmath74 must satisfy the euler - lagrange equation for some lagrangian multipliers @xmath75 to be found .    let @xmath76 denote the projection of @xmath77 onto the line spanned by @xmath78 , i.e. , @xmath79 where @xmath80 . setting @xmath81 in , we find that the vector @xmath82 points in the downward direction in figure [ fig : elas_pic ] .",
    "it follows that @xmath76 is bounded and periodic in @xmath83 .",
    "moreover , we can write the euler - lagrange equation as @xmath84 , so we have @xmath85 which is to say that the curvature is an affine function of @xmath76 .    in order to find @xmath86 , @xmath87 and @xmath88 in a numerically stable manner ,",
    "we solve the above equation in the least squares sense , i.e. , we consider the quadratic minimization problem @xmath89 which leads to the following linear system @xmath90    let @xmath91 denote the angle between the tangent vector @xmath92 and the @xmath76-axis ( see figure  [ fig : phi - theta ] ) .",
    "we have @xmath93 and hence @xmath94 or equivalently @xmath95    = .7 , @xmath74 , the @xmath76-axis and the angle @xmath91.,title=\"fig : \" ]    we solve this equation with respect to @xmath96 in the least squares sense and obtain @xmath97 where @xmath98 is the length of the curve @xmath77 .",

    "moreover , the inflectional elastica has points where @xmath117 ( which happens twice per period ) , but no points where @xmath118 ( see figure  [ fig : theta - u ] ) .",
    "hence @xmath76 runs through all of the interval where @xmath115 is less that @xmath110 ; in other words , @xmath119 and @xmath120 are exactly the endpoints of the above interval .",

    "we have @xmath132 and since @xmath133 we get @xmath134 so @xmath135 if we consider the unbounded complete elastica , then @xmath76 oscillates between @xmath119 and @xmath120 and we can divide the elastica into segments where @xmath76 is monotone , each with length equal to a half period @xmath136 .    we first consider the case of an elastica with inflection points ( i.e. @xmath137 ) . here",
