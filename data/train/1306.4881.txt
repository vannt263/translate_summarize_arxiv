    "axisymmetric spreading of an insoluble surfactant on a thin layer of incompressible fluid has been the subject of numerous experimental and mathematical studies @xcite . motivated by the biomedical application of aerosol medications delivered to the thin fluid lining the lung , gaver and grotberg derived a mathematical model , based on lubrication theory , that couples the height profile of the fluid surface @xmath2 to the local surfactant concentration @xmath3 .",
    "this model captures the driving force associated with the marangoni surface stress induced by spatial variations in surfactant concentration , which in turn depends on an equation of state that specifies the dependence of surface tension @xmath4 on @xmath5 .",
    "while the model was developed for monolayer applications of surfactant , it has come to be applied both above @xcite and near @xcite the critical monolayer concentration @xmath6 , the concentration above which a single layer of surfactant molecules can no longer form .",
    "similar models have been used to study thin films in bronchial systems @xcite , ocular systems including blinking dynamics @xcite , bulk solute transport @xcite , drying of latex paint @xcite , ink - jet printing @xcite , and secondary oil recovery @xcite .",
    "numerical simulations have been used to confirm several predictions of the model @xcite based on analysis of self - similar solutions .",
    "the simulations have also yielded detailed information about the spatiotemporal evolution of the free surface height and surfactant concentration profiles .",
    "one key observation is that the motion of the leading edge of the surfactant - covered region sets its spreading rate .",
    "the decrease in concentration at the leading edge induces a surface stress ( marangoni stress ) , which drives a capillary ridge ( local maximum ) in the fluid free surface that propagates along with the leading edge . in spite of these advances in understanding",
    ", experimental confirmation of the model has been more difficult to obtain due to the difficulty of measuring the surfactant concentration and its dynamics .",
    "consequently , attention has primarily focused on the evolution of the surface height profile @xcite , with the location of the leading edge @xmath7 of the surfactant layer inferred from other dynamics @xcite . within the near - monolayer regimes",
    "for which the model was developed , two experiments have observed @xmath8 spreading behavior on millimetric glycerin films , for both oleic acid @xcite and fluorescently - tagged phosphocholine ( nbd - pc ) @xcite . in experiments with initial concentrations @xmath9 of surfactant exceeding @xmath6 , spreading behavior consistent with the predicted @xmath10",
    "were observed by dussaud et al . for oleic acid on a sub - millimetric water - glycerin mixture , and by fallest et al . for nbd - pc on millimeter - thick glycerin .",
    "the latter experiments were able to simultaneously measure both the capillary ridge and the spatiotemporal dynamics of @xmath3 , to be analyzed in more detail below .",
    "sec . ]    in order to verify the model prediction for the time - dependent distribution of surfactant concentration , we explore stricter tests of the model than have been performed previously . using data from fallest et al .",
    "( for which @xmath5 is well above @xmath6 ) , we make a detailed comparison between the model predictions and the measured surface height profiles @xmath2 ( from a laser line ) and measured surfactant concentration profiles @xmath3 ( from azimuthal averages of fluorescent intensity at each point @xmath11 ) .",
    "figure  [ f : exp - image ] provides a schematic of the apparatus and a sample image .",
    "the well - specified physical parameters additionally allow us to evaluate the accuracy of the characteristic timescale predicted for the spreading rate , rather than just the exponent . while we find approximate agreement in the spreading exponent and the coincidence of the surfactant leading edge with the capillary ridge , we also find two significant inconsistencies .",
    "first , there is a mismatch between the characteristic timescale between model and experiment .",
    "second , the spatial distribution of the surfactant differs markedly from what is predicted in simulations . to account for the extent to which these discrepancies might be due to amounts of surfactant well beyond the monolayer regime , we perform new experiments , modified to allow for the detection of monolayer concentrations of surfactant ( @xmath12 ) . in these experiments ,",
    "we observe a distribution of surfactant which differs from the model predictions .",
    "in addition , we find that there is no spreading capillary ridge , and that the spreading exponent for the leading edge of the surfactant is less than @xmath1 .",
    "this value is well below predictions of the theory .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  [ s : experiment ] , we provide details about the experimental setup and the materials used . in  [",
    "s : model ] , we review the gaver - grotberg model @xcite , including a discussion of the choice of equation of state relating surfactant concentration to surface tension , and outline the finite difference method used for numerical simulation . in  [ s : highgamma ] , we describe comparisons between numerical simulations and experimental results at initial concentrations well above @xmath6 .",
    "as described above , we find partial agreement but also two inconsistencies when comparing experimental observations to numerical simulations . in an attempt to address the latter problem , in ",
    "[ s : hybrid ] we describe a hybrid model that takes the experimentally - measured @xmath3 and uses that quantity ( instead of the model for surfactant evolution ) to generate the evolution of the surface height profile .",
    "we find that this provides reasonable agreement with the experimental data for @xmath2 .",
    "in particular , the timescale in the simulations is set by the experimental surfactant distribution , and the height profile dynamics therefore evolve according to the experimentally - observed timescale . in ",
    "[ s : lowgamma ] , we report new experiments with @xmath12 and find significant disagreement with the model predictions , as summarized above .",
    "we conclude in  [ s : discussion ] with a discussion of the results and their significance .",
    "in our experiments , we simultaneously record the surface height profile @xmath2 of the underlying glycerin fluid layer , as well as the local fluorescence intensity , which corresponds to the local concentration @xmath13 of insoluble lipids ( surfactant ) spreading on the surface . the basic apparatus , described in and shown in figure  [ f : exp - image ] , consists of an aluminum well , a black light for exciting the nbd fluorophores , an oblique red laser line to illuminate the profile of the fluid surface , and a digital camera positioned directly above the experiment to capture the laser line and fluorescence ; this apparatus is used for the data presented in  [ s : highgamma ] .",
    "new experiments , presented in  [ s : lowgamma ] , are optimized to permit visualization of monolayer concentrations of surfactant .",
    "the bottom of the aluminum well is covered with a plasma - cleaned silicon wafer for improved reflectivity , and the fluorescent excitation is provided by 467  nm ( blue ) leds which coincide with the 464  nm absorption peak of the nbd fluorophore .",
    "a green laser line illuminates the profile of the fluid surface , so that both it and the fluorescently - emitted light pass through a band - pass filter centered at the emission peak ( 531  nm ) .",
    "these improvements to the optics permit us to collect images of the spreading dynamics at a framerate of 3  hz and an integration time of @xmath14  second , using an andor luca r camera optimized for fluorescence measurements .",
    "the signal - to - noise ratio now sets a lower limit of @xmath15 for the detection of surfactant .    for all experiments , we deposit 1-palmitoyl-2-\\{12-[(7-nitro-2 - 1 , 3-benzoxadiazol-4-yl)amino]lauroyl } -sn - glycero-3-phosphocholine ( abbreviated nbd - pc , from avanti polar lipids ) within a retaining ring which is lifted to begin the spreading process .",
    "this lipid molecule has one 12-carbon chain and one 16-carbon chain ; the nbd fluorophore is attached to the 12-carbon chain .",
    "experiments are conducted on a layer of 99.5% anhydrous glycerin , at an initial depth of @xmath16  mm , and held at room temperature ( @xmath17 @xmath18c ) .",
    "the lipids are initially deposited while dissolved in chloroform , which is allowed to evaporate for at least @xmath19  min before the retaining ring is lifted by a motor at @xmath20  mm / min .",

    "although a small amount of surfactant remains on the ring after it has been lifted , we nonetheless use the nominal concentration @xmath21 to describe the different initial conditions in table [ t : initcond ] .",
    "the experiments presented in  [ s : highgamma ] all begin from ic6 , with @xmath21 above the critical monolayer concentration @xmath6 .",

    "figure  [ f : idist ] shows sample images of the surfactant distribution alone , for a representative @xmath28 case and a @xmath29 case . in each image ,",
    "a sharp interface between the surfactant - covered and bare glycerin is readily visible ; the location @xmath7 of this interface is determined by identifying the annulus of maximum fluorescence intensity gradient . while the surfactant distribution is uniform for @xmath30 , several heterogeneities are present when @xmath31 .",
    "first , the central region contains a greater concentration of surfactant than the regions closer to the leading edge , an effect that we will explore in more detail below .",
    "second , there are filamentary patches of high concentration which also propagate out from the central region , becoming more dilute during the spreading dynamics .",
    "we also note that the outer edge of surfactant in both cases has corrugations ; in the figure , white circles are imposed to emphasize that the edges are not quite circular .",

    "the surface height profile simulated using this hybrid model exhibits an evolution and shape that is comparable to the experiment .",
    "we conclude that the equation modeling surfactant molecule motion through passive transport by the surface fluid is fundamentally flawed , and is missing some physical or chemical properties that would generate the surfactant distributions observed in the experiment .",

    "in contrast , the experimental data in the @xmath144 regime ( panels a - e ) show an initial ridge ( due to the meniscus at the ring ) collapsing rapidly in place , and no discernible ridge propagating outwards .      ) , scaled by the ring radius @xmath24 .",
    "the dashed lines corresponding to @xmath0 and @xmath145 spreading behavior are shown for comparison . ]",
    "given the significant differences between the observed and modeled @xmath2 and @xmath3 , it is unsurprising that we observe the spreading dynamics to be quite different as well . in figure",
    "[ f : rvst ] , we plot the position of the leading edge @xmath7 as a function of time , for experiments in both the monolayer regime of ic1-ic4 and for higher initial concentrations ( ic5-ic6 ) . for @xmath30 ( ic1-ic4 )",
    "the dynamics all follow a form @xmath146 , with @xmath147 . remarkably , this is reminiscent of tanner s law for fluid spreading on a solid @xcite . for slightly larger values of @xmath21 ( ic5 ) ,",
    "we observe faster surfactant spreading dynamics initially , but @xmath146 with @xmath148 at later times .",
    "this slow - spreading regime was not reached in the runs with much larger values of @xmath21 ( ic6 ) , for which @xmath149 remains close to @xmath150 , as predicted in @xcite .",
    "the decrease in @xmath149 for low surfactant concentrations suggests a transition in the dynamics which is not covered by the model equations .",
    "the differing prefactors for the various runs is probably a result of variations in @xmath21 due to some lipid molecules remaining on the ring after it lifts off , an effect that is more significant at lower concentrations .",
    "current mathematical models that describe the dynamics of the free surface of a thin fluid layer subject to forces induced by variations in surface tension contain two key assumptions : ( 1 ) lubrication theory is valid , and ( 2 ) surfactant molecules are primarily passively - transported by the fluid motion along the surface , along with negligible molecular diffusion .",
    "however , the dependence of surface forces on local variations in surfactant concentration is not completely settled , especially for larger concentrations . due to the coupling between the motion of the underlying fluid and the spreading of surfactant molecules ,",
    "it is crucial to compare results from simulations and experiments for both fluid motion ( through surface deformations ) and the dynamics of surfactant distribution .    in this paper",
    ", we compare model predictions to experiments that include the simultaneous visualization of the fluid height profile and the distribution of surfactant , both above and below the critical monolayer concentration @xmath6 . in both cases ,",
    "we find serious inconsistencies between the model and the experiments .",
    "the aspect ratio for the experiments is @xmath151 , which justifies the use of the lubrication approximation ; we have not verified the magnitude of the vertical velocity profile . at all initial concentrations , both above and below @xmath6 , the spatial distribution of surfactants does not follow the smooth , monotonically - decreasing profiles predicted by the model . at low surfactant concentrations ( @xmath30 , for which the models were originally developed ) , the distribution is highly - uniform with a sharp interface at the leading edge .",
    "second , spreading occurs much more slowly than is predicted by the model . for all experiments with @xmath30 ,",
    "the spreading dynamics of the leading edge approximately follow a power law @xmath152 , with @xmath153 .",
    "this is significantly smaller than the @xmath154 predicted by the natural scaling in the model .",
    "interestingly , this exponent is also markedly different from the exponent of @xmath155 to @xmath156 observed by gaver and grotberg for oleic acid and by bull et al .",
    "@xcite for nbd - pc . in the former case ,",
    "the measurement technique relies on the model for interpretation of experimental results , while in the later the @xmath157  mm fluid layer thickness may be large enough that deviations from the lubrication approximation are significant . for @xmath158 , even though @xmath159 , there is a mismatch by a factor of two between the timescales predicted in the model and observed in experiment .",
    "these inconsistencies are not resolved by changing assumptions concerning the initial distribution of surfactant . moreover , if a measured @xmath3 is incorporated directly into the lubrication model , then the timescale issue is no longer present , as the spreading ridge is simply driven by the spreading surfactant .",
    "one untested assumption is the functional form of the equations of state which have been considered to date .",
    "the lack of spreading ( @xmath153 for very low concentrations ) might indicate that the assumed @xmath45 equation of state is inadequate .",
    "if there were a value of @xmath5 below which there were no longer a significant surface tension gradient , a lack of spreading would be expected .",
    "in fact , in static surface - pressure measurements of diolein , oleyl alcohol , and lecithin on water , such an effect has been observed @xcite .",
    "future work to make similar measurements for nbc - pc , potentially locating a second transition point , may clarify the reason for the reduction in spreading .",
    "another possibility is that the passive transport model for surfactant distribution on the free surface is missing one or more effects that influence on the dynamics of insoluble surfactant spreading on thin liquid films .",
