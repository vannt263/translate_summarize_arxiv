    "one of the most striking features of quark - lepton spectrum is its cloning property : @xmath0 and @xmath1 families seem to be just heavy copies of electron family .",
    "actually we have two questions to be answered : what is an origin of family formation and how many generations do exist .",
    "recent lep data @xcite strongly suggests three quark - lepton generations .",
    "although calabi - yau compactifications of the heterotic string model can lead to three generations @xcite , there are many such calabi - yau manifolds , and additional assumptions are needed to argue why the number three is preferred @xcite .    there is another well - known example of particle cloning ( doubling of states ) : the existence of antiparticles .",
    "algebraically the charge conjugation operator defines an ( outer ) automorphism of underlying symmetry group @xcite and reflects the symmetry of the corresponding dynkin diagram .",
    "we can thought that the observed triplication of states can have the same origin .",
    "the most symmetric dynkin diagram is associated with so(8 ) group .",
    "so it is the richest in automorphisms and if so(8 ) plays some dynamical role we can hope that its greatly symmetrical internal structure naturally lead to the desired multiplication of states in elementary particle spectrum .",
    "what follows is an elaboration of this idea .",
    "although the relevant mathematical properties of so(8 ) are known for a long time @xcite , they have not been discussed in context of the generation problem , to my knowledge .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the structure of a simple lie algebra is uniquely defined by the length and angle relations among simple roots .",
    "this information is compactly represented by the dynkin diagram .",
    "on such a diagram each simple root is depicted by a small circle , which is made black , if the root is a short one .",
    "each pair of vertexes on the dynkin diagram is connected by lines , number of which equals to @xmath2 , @xmath3 being the angle between corresponding simple roots .    the main classification theorem for simple lie algebras states that there exists only four infinite series and five exceptional algebras @xcite .",
    "among them @xmath4 , the lie algebra of the so(8 ) group , really has the most symmetric dynkin diagram    actually only the symmetry with regard to the cyclic permutations of the @xmath5 @xmath6 simple roots ( which we call triality symmetry ) is new , because the symmetry with regard to the interchange @xmath7 ( last two simple roots ) is shared by other @xmath8 lie algebras also .",
    "due to this triality symmetry , @xmath9 and @xmath10 basic irreps ( @xmath11 being the highest weight in the dynkin coordinates @xcite ) all have the same dimensionality 8 - the remarkable fact valid only for the @xmath4 lie algebra .",
    "the corresponding highest weights are connected by above mentioned triality symmetry . for other orthogonal groups (",
    "10  0 ) is a vector representation , ( 00  01 ) - a first kind spinor and ( 00  10 ) - a second kind spinor .",
    "so there is no intrinsic difference between ( complex ) vectors and spinors in the eight - dimensional space @xcite , which object is vector and which ones are spinors depends simply on how we have enumerated symmetric simple roots and so is a mere convention .",
    "it is tempting to use this peculiarity of the so(8 ) group to justify observed triplication of quark - lepton degrees of freedom .",
    "this possible connection between generations and so(8 ) can be formulated most naturally in terms of octonions .",
    "eight - dimensional vectors and spinors can be realized through octonions @xcite , which can be viewed as a generalization of the complex numbers : instead of one imaginary unit we have seven imaginary units @xmath12 , in the octonionic algebra .",
    "the multiplication table between them can be found in @xcite .",
    "the octonion algebra is an alternative algebra ( but not associative ) .",
    "this means that the associator @xmath13 is a skew symmetric function of the x , y , z octonions .",
    "the conjugate octonion @xmath14 and the scalar product of octonions are defined as @xmath15    let us consider eight linear operators @xmath16 , @xmath17 , acting in the 16-dimensional bioctonionic space : @xmath18    using the alternativity property of octonions , it can be tested that these operators generate a clifford algebra @xmath19 ( note , that , because of nonassociativity , the operator product is not equivalent to the product of the corresponding octonionic matrices ) .",
    "the eight - dimensional vectors and spinors can be constructed in the standard way from this clifford algebra @xcite .",
    "namely , the infinitesimal rotation in the ( k , l)-plane by an angle @xmath20 is represented by the operator @xmath21 and the transformation law for the ( bi)spinor @xmath22 is @xmath23 .    for @xmath24 given by eq.2 the upper and lower octonionic components of @xmath25 transform independently under the 8-dimensional rotations : @xmath26 & & q^{\\prime}_2=q_2+\\frac{1}{2}\\,\\theta \\ , \\bar e_k\\cdot(e_l \\cdot q_2 ) \\equiv",
    "q_1+\\theta c_{kl}(q_2 )   \\label{eq3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while a vector transformation law can be represented in the form @xmath27    one more manifestation of the equality between 8-dimensional vectors and spinors is the fact @xcite that each spinor transformation from eq.3 can be represented as a sum of four vector rotations @xmath28 where @xmath29 are defined through the condition @xmath30 , and @xmath31    an algebraic expression of the equality between vectors and spinors in the eight - dimensional space is the following equation , valid for any two @xmath32 octonions @xcite : @xmath33 where @xmath34 , k being the ( octonionic ) conjugation operator @xmath35 .",
    "eq.7 remains valid under any cyclic permutations of @xmath36 .",
    "note that @xmath37 where @xmath1 is an automorphism of the @xmath4 lie algebra .",
    "we can call it the triality automorphism , because it performs a cyclic interchange between vector and spinors : @xmath38 operators realize the ( 1000 ) vector representation , @xmath39 - a first kind spinor ( 0001 ) , and @xmath40 - a second kind spinor ( 0010 ) .",
    "in general , vector and spinors transform differently under 8-dimensional rotations , because @xmath41 .",
    "but it follows from eq.6 that @xmath42 and @xmath43 are invariant with regard to the triality automorphism , and so under such rotations 8-dimensional vector and both kinds of spinors transform in the same way .",
    "these transformations are automorphisms of the octonion algebra , because their generators act as derivations , as the principle of triality ( eq.7 ) shows .",
    "we can construct 14 linearly independent derivations of the octonion algebra , because the method described above gives two independent rotations per one imaginary octonionic unit @xmath44 .",
    "it is well known @xcite that the derivations of the octonion algebra form @xmath45 exceptional lie algebra .",
    "it was suggested @xcite that the subgroup of this @xmath45 , which leaves the seventh imaginary unit invariant , can be identified with the colour su(3 ) group .",
    "if we define the split octonionic units @xcite @xmath46 & & u_k=\\frac{1}{2}(e_k+ie_{k+3 } ) \\hskip20 mm u_{k}^*=\\frac{1}{2}(e_k - ie_{k+3 } ) \\label{eq9}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 , then with regard to this su(3 ) @xmath48 transforms as triplet , @xmath49 - as antitriplet and @xmath50 , @xmath51 are singlets @xcite . therefore , all one - flavour quark - lepton degrees of freedom can be represented as one octonionic ( super)field @xmath52 here @xmath53 are lepton and ( three coloured ) quark fields and @xmath54 - their charge conjugates .",
    "note that it does nt matter what an octonion , first kind spinor , second kind spinor or vector we have in eq.10 , because they all transform identically under su(3 ) .",
    "so so(8 ) can be considered as a natural @xmath55 quark - lepton unification group .",
    "we can call it also a generalized colour group in the pati - salam sense , remembering their idea about the lepton number as the fourth colour @xcite .",
    "then the triality property of the so(8 ) gives a natural reason why the number of flavours should be triplicated .",
    "unfortunately , so(8 ) is not large enough to be used as a grand unification group : there is no room for weak interactions in it .",
    "this is not surprising , because weak interactions connect two different flavours and we are considering so(8 ) as a one - flavour unification group .",
    "the following observation points out the way how so(8 ) can be extended to include the weak interactions . because @xmath56 and @xmath57 for @xmath58 , the so(8 ) ( hermitian ) generators for the ( bi)spinor transformation eq.3 can be represented as @xmath59 and @xmath60 .",
    "the last equation suggests to consider @xmath61 generators , where @xmath62 and summation to the modulus 10 is assumed , i.e. 7 + 3=0 .",
    "so we have two new operators @xmath63 and @xmath64 which mix the upper and lower ( bi)spinor octonionic components .",
    "besides , if we consider these operators as rotations , then we have to add two extra dimensions and it is expected that so(8 ) will be enlarged to so(10 ) in this way and two different so(8 ) spinors ( two different flavours ) will join in one so(10 ) spinor ( family formation ) .    indeed ,",
    "the following generators @xmath65 & & m_{a,7+k}=-i \\sigma_k f_{a0 } \\hskip5 mm m_{7+k , a}=-m_{a,7+k } \\hskip5pt , \\label{eq11 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath58 and @xmath66 , really satisfy the so(10 ) commutation relations @xmath67=-i(\\delta_{\\nu \\tau } m_{\\mu \\rho }   + \\delta_{\\mu \\rho } m_{\\nu \\tau } - \\delta_{\\mu \\tau }    m_{\\nu \\rho } - \\delta_{\\nu \\rho } m_{\\mu \\tau } ) \\hskip3pt   .",
    "\\label{eq12 } \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    it is clear from eq.12 , that @xmath68 @xmath69 and @xmath70 @xmath71 subsets of generators are closed under commutation and commute to each other .",
    "they correspond to @xmath72 and su(4 ) subgroups of so(10 ) .",
    "the generators of the @xmath72 can be represented as @xmath73 so multiplication by @xmath50 or @xmath51 split octonion units plays the role of projection operator on the left and right weak isospin , respectively .",
    "the su(4 ) generators can be also expressed via split octonionic units : @xmath74 in the last two equations @xmath75 is a cyclic permutation of ( 1,2,3 ) and it is assumed that , for example , @xmath76 .    under su(4 ) @xmath77 , @xmath78 , transforms as a @xmath79 fundamental representation and @xmath80 - as its conjugate @xmath81 .",
    "so su(4 ) unifies @xmath50 colour singlet and @xmath82 colour triplet in one single object , and therefore plays the role of the pati - salam group @xcite .",
    "note that all one - family ( left - handed ) quark - lepton degrees of freedom are unified in one bioctonionic ( super)field ( 16-dimensional so(10 ) spinor ) @xcite @xmath83    the fact that we should take the weyl ( left - handed ) spinors instead of dirac ( that the weak interactions are flavour chiral ) indicates close interplay between space - time ( space inversion ) and internal symmetries @xcite .",
    "thus our construction leads to so(10 ) as a natural @xmath84 unification group . but",
    "doing so , we have broken the triality symmetry : only the spinoric octonions take part in family formation and the vectoric octonion is singled out .",
    "can we in some way restore equivalence between vector and spinor octonions ?",
    "first of all we need to realize vector octonion in terms of the so(10 ) representation and this can be done by means of @xmath85 octonionic hermitian matrices , which together with the symmetric product @xmath86 form the @xmath87 jordan algebra @xcite .",
    "so(10 ) appears as a ( reduced ) structure group of this jordan algebra @xcite and 10-dimensional complex vector space generated by the @xmath87 basic elements ( the complexification of @xmath87 ) , gives ( 10000 ) irreducible representation of its @xmath88 lie algebra .",
    "thus , now we have at hand the realization of spinoric octonions as a 16-dimensional so(10 ) spinor @xmath89 and vectoric octonion as a 10-dimensional so(10 ) vector @xmath90 $ ] . how to unify them ?",
    "the familiar unitary symmetry example how to unify an isodublet and an isotriplet in the @xmath91 complex hermitian matrix can give a hint and so let us consider @xmath923 octonion hermitian matrices .",
    "together with the symmetric product , @xmath91 octonion hermitian matrices form the @xmath94 exceptional jordan algebra @xcite . a general element from it has a form @xmath95 and",
    "can be uniquely represented as @xmath96 .",
    "this is the peirce decomposition @xcite of @xmath94 relative to the mutually orthogonal idempotents @xmath97 .",
    "a reduced structure group of @xmath94 is @xmath93 exceptional lie group @xcite .",
    "its lie algebra consists of the following transformations :    \\1 ) 24 linearly independent @xmath98 generators , which are defined as @xmath99 $ ] , where @xmath100 is a @xmath91 octonion anti - hermitian matrix with zero diagonal elements .",
    "\\2 ) @xmath101 triality triplets ( eq.7 and eq.8),which annihilate @xmath97 idempotents and in the @xmath102 peirce components act according to @xmath103 because a triality triplet is uniquely defined by its first element : @xmath104 and @xmath105 , this gives extra 28 linearly independent generators .",
    "together with @xmath98 type operators , they form 52-dimensional @xmath106 exceptional lie algebra @xcite .",
    "\\3 ) @xmath107 linear transformations of @xmath94 , defined as @xmath108 , where t is any element from @xmath94 with zero trace .",
    "the way how @xmath93 exceptional lie algebra was constructed shows the close relationship between @xmath88 and @xmath93 : the latter is connected to the exceptional jordan algebra @xmath94 and the former - to the @xmath87 jordan algebra @xcite .",
    "but @xmath94 has three @xmath87 ( jordan ) subalgebras , consisting correspondingly from elements @xmath109 therefore @xmath93 has three equivalent @xmath88 subalgebras .",
    "let @xmath110 be that @xmath88 subalgebra of @xmath93 which acts in the @xmath87 jordan algebra , formed from the @xmath111 elements .",
    "it consists from @xmath112 , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , @xmath115 operators and their ( complex ) linear combinations .",
    "therefore the intersection of these @xmath110 subalgebras is @xmath4 formed from the @xmath101 triality triplets , and their unification gives the whole @xmath93 algebra .",
    "the triality automorphism for @xmath4 can be continued on @xmath93 :    it can be verified @xcite that eq.16 actually gives an @xmath93 automorphism .",
    "this @xmath1 automorphism causes a cyclic permutation of the @xmath110 subalgebras    so @xmath93 exceptional lie group is very closely related to triality .",
    "firstly , it unifies the spinoric and vectoric octonions in one 27-dimensional irreducible representation ( algebraically they unify in the @xmath94 exceptional jordan algebra ) .",
    "secondly , its internal structure also reveals a very interesting triality picture :    the equality between so(8 ) spinors and vectors now results in the equality of three so(10 ) subgroups ( in the existence of the triality automorphism @xmath1 , which interchanges these subgroups ) .    to form a quark - lepton family",
    ", we have to select one of these so(10 ) subgroups . but a priori there is no reason to prefer any of them .",
    "the simplest possibility to have family formation which respects this equality between various so(10 ) subgroups ( @xmath93 triality symmetry ) is to take three copies of @xmath94 and arrange matters in such a way that in the first @xmath94 the first so(10 ) subgroup acts as a family formating group , in the second @xmath94 - the second so(10 ) and in the third one - the third so(10 ) :    more formally , we have @xmath116+@xmath116 + @xmath116 reducible representation of @xmath93 , such that when we go from one irreducible subspace to another , representation matrices are rotated by the triality automorphism @xmath1 .",
    "if we take seriously that octonions play some underlying dynamical role in particle physics and so(8 ) appears as a one - flavour unification group , then the triality property of so(8 ) gives a natural reason for the existence of three quark - lepton generations .",
    "family formation from two flavours due to weak interactions can be connected naturally enough to so(10 ) group , but with the triality symmetry violated .",
    "an attempt to restore this symmetry leads to the exceptional group @xmath93 and three quark - lepton families .",
