    "the  processing system was developed with the aim of creating a `` final archive '' of  data to be made available to the astronomical community as a legacy after the end of the project .",
    "this archive would include all the spectra re - processed with improved algorithms and up - to - date calibrations .",
    "the  processing system is fully described by nichols and linsky ( 1996 ) and nichols ( 1998 ) .",
    "technical details are given in the  manual ( garhart et al .",
    "the introduction of new techniques to perform the geometric and photometric corrections led to a substantial improvement in the signal - to - noise ratio of the final spectra .",
    "further improvements in the quality of the high resolution data arise from the new method to determine the image background and from the improved ripple correction and absolute calibration ( cassatella et al .",
    "1999 , hereinafter paper ii ) .",
    "the background subtraction has always been one of the more critical issues in the processing of  high resolution spectra , particularly at the shortest wavelengths , where orders crowd and an accurate estimate of the background is essential for a correct flux extraction .",
    "this problem has been overcome in  through the derivation of a bi - dimensional background ( see smith 1999 for a description of the method ) .",
    "the goal of the  processing system was to correct the deficiencies found during the scientific evaluation of the data processed with  for the   final archive , and to provide the output data to the users in a simple way requiring a minimum knowledge of the operational and instrumental characteristics of  ( wamsteker et al .",
    "the modifications introduced in the processing of low resolution data have been described by rodrguez - pascual et al .",
    "( 1999 , paper i ) . as for high resolution data ,",
    "the  system provides two output products derived from the  mxhi ( i.e. high resolution extracted spectra ) files : the `` concatenated '' spectrum , where the spectral orders are merged eliminating the overlap regions , and the `` rebinned '' spectrum , which is the concatenated spectrum resampled to the low resolution wavelength step .",
    "both concatenated and rebinned spectra include an error vector calibrated in absolute flux units .",
    "the inconsistency between the high resolution short and long wavelength scales in  has been corrected for in the  concatenated spectra .

    "km  s@xmath0 has been applied to the wavelength scale of swp high resolution spectra .",
    "the wavelength scale of lwp / lwr small aperture spectra has been corrected by + 13.7 km  s@xmath0 . with these corrections ,",
    "the  velocity scale is consistent with the optical determinations .",
    "in this paper we have discussed the overall quality of high resolution spectra processed with the  system .",
    "the stability of the wavelength scale ( @xmath2 5 km  s@xmath0 ) is within the limits imposed by the acquisition and tracking accuracy .",
    "no appreciable distortions in the wavelength scale over the full spectral range or during the spacecraft lifetime have been found .",
    "a discrepancy of 9 km  s@xmath0 has been found in the velocities derived from the two components of the mg  ii doublet at 2800   in the lwp camera .",
    "the correct velocity is provided by the k line measured on spectral order 83 .",
    "no such discrepancy has been found in lwr spectra .",
    "the wavelength scales of  short and long cameras present an inconsistency , which is well above the repeatability errors quoted above .",
    "measurements of narrow interstellar lines have shown that swp velocities are systematically more negative by -17.7 km  s@xmath0 , on average .",
    "a similar discrepancy has been detected in long wavelength small aperture spectra , whose velocities are more negative than those from long wavelength large aperture spectra by -13.7 km  s@xmath0 .    the determination of the inter  order background has greatly improved with respect to the the  system , especially at the shortest wavelengths , as shown by the absence of negative fluxes in the cores of saturated absorption lines and by the greater accuracy of equivalent width measurements .    the  system derives two spectra from each original  mxhi file . in the first one , the `` concatenated '' spectrum ,",
    "the spectral orders are merged together and the overlap regions are suppressed according to an algorithm which computes suitable cut wavelengths which maximize the signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "this spectrum contains an error vector calibrated into absolute flux units , which is not available in  data .",
    "since the  high resolution spectra are obtained from  mxhi files , all previous considerations about the stability of the wavelength scale , the stability and accuracy of the flux scale and the validity of the background extraction are applicable to them .",
    "the second output product is the `` rebinned '' spectrum , which is the `` concatenated '' spectrum after resampling at the low resolution wavelength step .    to correct for the discrepancies found in the  high resolution wavelength scale , a velocity correction of + 17.7 km  s@xmath0 for swp spectra and of + 13.5 km  s@xmath0 for lwp / lwr",
    "small aperture spectra has been applied to the `` concatenated '' spectra . with this correction ,",
    "the overall  velocity scale is self  consistent , and agrees to within 8 km  s@xmath0 with the optical velocity scale ."
