    "for a vectorlike gauge theory in euclidean metric the introduction of a quark chemical potential breaks the @xmath7-hermiticity of the dirac operator : @xmath8 this implies that eigenvalues of @xmath9 are no longer pure imaginary and hence not related to each other by complex conjugation , in turn implying @xmath10 therefore the functional measure is no longer positive definite . in principle",
    "the determinant can be factorised into a modulus @xmath11 and a phase @xmath12 , and the phase included with the observable @xmath13 in monte carlo simulations via @xmath14 unfortunately fairly general arguments suggest that @xmath15 , where @xmath16 is the system volume . acquiring sufficient statistics therefore becomes exponentially difficult as the thermodynamic limit is approached .",
    "this is known as the _ sign problem _ , and has plagued the study of @xmath6 since its inception .",
    "however , we should not be so surprised , since generic problems in the quantum theory of @xmath17 objects require @xmath18 different complexions or wavefunctions to be examined .",
    "perhaps a more productive way of phrasing the question would be _ why is vacuum",
    "qcd so easy ? _    given this difficulty there are two routes forward .",
    "firstly , one can perform a qcd simulation at @xmath19 and attempt to analytically continue the results to @xmath6 .",
    "this can be done either by calculating terms in a taylor expansion about @xmath19 , exemplified , for instance , by the calculation of baryon number susceptibility @xmath20 @xcite , or by directly reweighting configurations , as in the ` glasgow method ' developed by ian barbour and collaborators @xcite . in the former case",
    "the prospects are limited by a finite radius of convergence , dictated by the presence of a critical point in the @xmath1 plane . in the latter case",
    "the effectiveness is limited by the requirement of maintaining a reasonable overlap between the trial and true ensembles , which once again becomes exponentially hard in the thermodynamic limit @xcite .",
    "both methods have their best chance of succeeding at @xmath21 ; at @xmath22 the behaviour is horribly non - analytic , since the ground state does not change as @xmath0 increases out to the onset of nuclear matter at @xmath23mev .",
    "as we shall see , the overlap problem is also considerably more tractable at @xmath21 .",
    "the second approach is to throw up our hands and use a real measure @xmath24 .",
    "physically this has the effect of introducing conjugate quarks @xmath25 which have positive baryon charge but transform in the conjugate representation of the gauge group @xcite , leading to the possibility of gauge invariant @xmath26 bound states . in real qcd",
    "this is a disaster since the lightest such state is degenerate with the pion , being in effect a ` goldstone baryon ' .",
    "as @xmath0 is raised the onset of nuclear matter would thus be expected at @xmath27 rather than the constituent quark scale @xmath28 .",
    "there are models , however , such as two color qcd @xcite and qcd with non - zero isospin chemical potential @xmath29 @xcite , where @xmath30 goldstone baryons are a feature , not a problem @xcite .",
    "another class amenable to this approach are njl - like models , where @xmath26 states do nt couple to the goldstone mode @xcite and hence remain at the constituent scale , so the use of a real measure does nt damage the physics .",
    "the common feature of all these models is that the diquark condensate which potentially forms at large @xmath0 is gauge singlet , and hence describes a superfluid , as opposed to superconducting , ground state .",
    "fodor and katz @xcite have made spectacular progress in reweighting at @xmath21 .",
    "the basic formula is @xmath31=\\int\\!du \\exp(-s_{bos}[u;\\alpha_0])\\mbox{det}m[u;\\alpha_0]\\times\\nonumber\\\\ \\left\\{\\exp(-\\delta s_{bos}[u;\\alpha,\\alpha_0]){{\\mbox{det}m[u;\\alpha]}\\over { \\mbox{det}m[u;\\alpha_0]}}\\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the parameter set @xmath32 but importance sampling is performed using a different set @xmath33 , with @xmath0 chosen either zero or pure imaginary to keep the determinant real .",
    "usually reweighting is only effective if @xmath34 is small enough to maintain a good overlap between trial and true ensembles .",
    "fodor and katz insight is that along the crossover / coexistence line between hadronic and quark - gluon plasma phases the true ensemble can not alter very much , since it must contain contributions from both phases ; hence the overlap between ensembles along the line remains high .",
    "they therefore generalise the glasgow method by reweighting with both @xmath35 in order to stay on this line .",
    "in practice @xmath36 is identified via the real part of the lowest lee - yang zero @xmath37 , which approaches the real axis as @xmath16 increases .",
    "now , the nature of the transition between hadronic and qgp phases can be determined by the volume scaling of @xmath38 : @xmath39    the results for @xmath40 flavor qcd with @xmath41 , @xmath42 on volumes up to @xmath43 are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ly ] .",
    "the physical scale is set using separate simulations at @xmath44 and @xmath45 , which yield a critical temperature @xmath46mev .",
    "the main prediction is for the critical endpoint of the first order line , at @xmath47 the result for @xmath48 is unexpectedly large , and might undermine proposals to observe it directly at rhic @xcite .",
    "however , the endpoint is expected to move to the left as the chiral limit is approached , so one should consider ( [ eq : endpoint ] ) more as a proof of principle at this stage .",
    "what should be stressed is that currently the results are limited by cpu resources rather than overlap problems as @xmath49 ; it is certainly possible , therefore , that lattice methods can ultimately obtain an accurate determination of @xmath50 .",
    "there have also been developments in taylor expansion methods , which can deliver information on a wider range of observables .",
    "gavai and gupta have reexamined quark number susceptibilities in quenched qcd @xcite , in particular finding that @xmath51 increases markedly across the transition to qgp , and approaches @xmath52 for @xmath53 , though all three depart significantly from ideal - gas values .",
    "these quantities are testable in ion collisions via eg .",
    "event - by - event fluctuations in charged particle yields and strangeness enhancement .",
    "qcd - taro have looked at the response of hadron masses to a change of both baryon and isospin chemical potentials @xcite .",
    "they find @xmath54 , and with a much larger value in the qgp phase , indicative that the pion is no longer a goldstone mode at high @xmath2 ; by contrast @xmath55 and is much larger in the hadronic phase , consistent with pion condensation in cold dense isospin - asymmetric matter @xcite .",
    "finally ejiri has determined the curvature of the critical line @xmath56 by measuring the shift in the peaks for @xmath57 and polyakov loop susceptibities @xcite .",
    "for quark mass @xmath58 on @xmath59 he obtains a value @xmath60 ; assuming a critical temperature @xmath61mev and a @xmath62-function given by its one - loop value , this yields a value @xmath63 , not too far from ( [ eq : endpoint ] ) .",
    "for gauge group su(2 ) , the fermion determinant is trivially real since all matter representations are either real , or pseudoreal ( in which case @xmath64 ) .",
    "moreover , if we specialise to the case of @xmath17 staggered fermions in the fundamental representation , the usual @xmath65 global symmetry at @xmath66 is enhanced , via @xmath67 to @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 . for adjoint quarks the same relation holds with the @xmath71 factors replaced by 1 .",
    "now , at @xmath19 we expect this global symmetry to be spontaneously broken by a chiral condensate @xmath72 . for fundamental quarks the breaking pattern",
    "is @xmath73 yielding @xmath74 goldstones ; for adjoint the pattern is @xmath75 with @xmath76 goldstones @xcite .",
    "this differs in detail from the corresponding patterns for continuum fermions @xcite .",
    "the important point is that besides the usual mesonic @xmath77 states , in general some of the goldstones must be @xmath30 baryons , as anticipated in sec .",
    "[ sec : mu ] .",
    "it is also possible to identify diquark condensates for both * 2 * and * 3 * representations : @xmath78 where in the * 3 * case the antisymmetric @xmath79 acts on flavor .",
    "these are related to @xmath80 by a @xmath81 rotation and are gauge invariant . since , however , ( [ eq : qq ] ) is not invariant under the original u(1)@xmath82 , baryon charge is no longer a good quantum number .",
    "it is possible to treat tcqcd analytically by ignoring all excitations except the goldstones , and writing down an effective action in the spirit of chiral perturbation theory ( @xmath83pt ) , in which the physical parameters are @xmath80 and @xmath84 at @xmath19 .",
    "remarkably , the @xmath0-dependent terms in the chiral lagrangian are completely determined in terms of these two parameters by the global symmetries @xcite . at leading order in @xmath83pt a second order onset phase transition",
    "is predicted at the rescaled chemical potential @xmath85 : @xmath86 where the baryon charge density @xmath87 and the 0 subscript denotes values at @xmath19 .",
    "the high-@xmath0 phase is a superfluid which forms as a result of a bose - einstein condensation of weakly interacting diquark bosons .",
    "let us briefly discuss the measurement of @xmath88 . in a finite volume",
    "the technicalities are identical to those involved in measuring the chiral condensate .",
    "a diquark source term @xmath89 is introduced and the action rewritten in a gorkov basis @xcite : @xmath90 whence @xmath91=\\int{\\cal d}u\\mbox{pf}(2{\\cal a}[u , j,\\bar\\jmath ] ) e^{-s_{bos}[u]}. \\label{eq : pf}\\ ] ] the condensate is then defined by @xmath92 of course , since @xmath93 is not a physical parameter one wants the @xmath94 limit , but any favourite method for probing @xmath95 can be used , such as direct inversion of @xmath96 followed by extrapolating @xmath94 @xcite , using a banks - casher relation on the eigenvalue density of @xmath97 @xcite , or by calculating the probability distribution function of @xmath88 @xcite .    since the pioneering work of nakamura @xcite ,",
    "there have been several studies of tcqcd with @xmath6 using a variety of algorithms and actions @xcite .",
    "i will briefly discuss some highlights .",
    "[ fig : azcoiti ] shows strong coupling results @xcite for @xmath80 , @xmath98 and @xmath99 vs. @xmath0 together with @xmath83pt predictions ( [ eq : chipt ] ) , showing acceptable agreement until saturation artifacts creep in for @xmath100 .",
    "[ fig : unipbp ] shows @xmath101 vs. rescaled chemical potential for three different bare quark masses in tcqcd with adjoint quarks @xcite , together with the prediction ( [ eq : chipt ] ) . in this case",
    "@xmath83pt appears to work well up to @xmath102 over a decade of quark mass .",
    "since @xmath4 breaks a global symmetry , we anticipate a diquark goldstone boson for @xmath103 whose mass should vanish as @xmath94 @xcite .",
    "physically this results in long - ranged interactions between vortex excitations in a rotating superfluid , and in propagating waves of temperature variation known as _ second sound_. simulations with @xmath104 slow dramatically in this regime due to the profusion of small eigenvalues of @xmath105 @xcite .",
    "[ fig : goldstone ] shows the results of simulating the pfaffian weight ( [ eq : pf ] ) with @xmath106 on a much larger system @xcite , which enable the identification of a massless mode in the zero source limit .",
    "-25pt    finally , studies of the high density regime at @xmath21 have shown a strong first - order transition restoring the normal qgp state @xmath107 @xcite .",
    "although the tcqcd measure is obviously real , we have not discussed its positivity .",
    "in fact , it is possible to prove it positive for all cases except an odd number of adjoint staggered quarks .",
    "for @xmath108 adjoint flavor , however , the sign problem returns @xcite .",
    "additionally in this case , the goldstone count does not include any baryons , and the superfluid condensate @xmath109 in ( [ eq : qq ] ) is forbidden by the pauli exclusion principle .",
    "both facts invalidate the use of @xmath83pt .",
    "indeed , the simplest local diquark operator that can be written is gauge - variant ; @xmath110\\in { \\bf3}\\;\\ ; \\mbox{of   su}(2),\\ ] ] leading to the possibility of color superconductivity _  la _ georgi - glashow in the high density phase .",
    "simulations using the two - step multibosonic algorithm have been performed which reweight the ensemble taking the sign into account @xcite .",
    "once @xmath103 the sign starts to fluctuate , and by @xmath111 at @xmath112 @xmath113 has fallen to 0.30(4 ) on @xmath114 @xcite . remarkably , once the observables are also reweighted , all signals for the onset transition disappear , as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : tsmb ] .",
    "this is in accord with the expectation that there is now a separation between the lightest baryon mass and the goldstone scale , and demonstrates that sgn(det ) plays a decisive role in determining the ground state .",
    "[ fig : tsmb ] is probably the most expensive simulation of nothing happening to date .",

    "our current interest is the model in 2 + 1 dimensions , since apart from the obvious computational saving there is an interacting continuum limit at @xmath120 , @xmath121 @xcite . for @xmath6 ,",
    "there is a strong first - order chiral symmetry - restoring transition at @xmath122 @xcite , which is completely separate from the goldstone scale @xcite , but appears to coincide @xcite with an onset transition separating the vacuum from a regime with @xmath123 , suggestive of a two - dimensional fermi surface with @xmath124 in the chirally - restored phase .",
    "this is natural since the lightest baryons in the model are fermions .",
    "an obvious question is whether u(1)@xmath82 is spontaneously broken for @xmath125 by a superfluid condensate @xmath126 ( note that we have surreptitiously slipped back into the notation of staggered fermions ; the continuum translation is given in @xcite ) .",
    "superfluid condensation in this model would occur via a bcs instability at the fermi surface , as in @xmath127he .",
    "to investigate this we have performed pfaffian simulations with diquark source term @xcite @xmath128 measuring both condensate @xmath129 and associated susceptibilities @xmath130 .",

    "the high density data ( @xmath135 for our choice of coupling ) suggest a power - law equation of state @xmath136 with @xmath137 falling in the range 0.2 - 0.3 for the values of @xmath0 examined .",
    "this is reinforced by the susceptibility ratio @xmath138 plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : r ] ; using ( [ eq : ward ] ) and ( [ eq : powerlaw ] ) it is easy to show that @xmath139 should take the constant value @xmath140 .",

    "[ fig : lnln],[fig : r ] is strongly reminiscent of the low temperature @xmath142 @xmath143 model , which exists in a critical state for a range of @xmath2 with continuously varying exponents @xmath144 , @xmath145 , which we can define analogously ( the arrow denotes a @xmath142 vector ) : @xmath146 we therefore conjecture that njl@xmath147 in its large-@xmath0 phase describes a @xmath142 critical system .",
    "the condensate is washed out by long - wavelength fluctuations as @xmath94 , but long range phase coherence is maintained via ( [ eq : xy ] ) .",

    "the superfluid current is related to the phase @xmath149 of @xmath150 via @xmath151 there is a beautiful topological argument @xcite that the only way to change the circulation @xmath152 around a periodic volume is to create a vortex  anti - vortex pair and translate one of them around the universe in the perpendicular direction until they reannihilate , thereby increasing @xmath153 by a quantum @xmath154 . since",
    ", however , the energy required increases logarithmically with pair separation , the circulation is metastable , thereby demonstrating superfluidity .",

    ", we need to analyse non - zero momenta @xmath158 ; indeed the mass gap extracted from the decay of @xmath159 in euclidean time initially _ decreases _ as @xmath160 , corresponding to vacating holes in the fermi sea , before rising for @xmath161 indicating particle excitations . the resulting _ quasiparticle dispersion relation _",
    "@xmath162 is shown in fig .",

    "this is characteristic of a relativistic fermi liquid with a repulsive interaction between quasiparticles with parallel momenta @xcite .",
    "most importantly , there is no evidence for a bcs gap @xmath165 ; certainly @xmath166 can be excluded .",
    "the origin of the new universality class may therefore be attributed to the presence of massless fermions at the fermi surface .",
    "the overall conclusion is that njl@xmath147 describes a relativistic thin film gapless superfluid .",
    "all the systems we have been able to study at high density ( ie . those with a real measure )",
    "exhibit superfluidity .",
    "what are the prospects for studying the breaking of a local symmetry ?",
    "we have already seen that the only variant of tcqcd with a potentially superconducting solution , namely @xmath108 adjoint staggered flavor , is afflicted with a sign problem .",
    "the most promising microscopic model of high-@xmath167 superconductors , namely the hubbard model with on - site repulsion away from half - filling , also has an intractable sign problem in precisely the regime of interest @xcite .",
    "a more familiar example in a particle physics context is technicolor , in which condensation of quark pairs from different representations of a gauge group force its dynamical breakdown ; since this requires chiral fermions , in complex represenations , a sign problem of some sort seems inevitable .",
    "an exotic @xmath168 example is `` @xmath169-qed ''",
    "this exhibits planar superconductivity by generating an electromagnetic photon mass by mixing with a second `` statistical '' photon @xmath170 via a mixed chern - simons interaction generated by fermion loops ; for a non - zero cs coupling dynamical mass generation through a gauge - invariant condensate @xmath171 is required . in euclidean space",
    ", however , the cs term is pure imaginary and the resulting effective action complex ; this also follows from the bare action since in this case the coupling @xmath172 implies @xmath173 , in turn implying @xmath174 .",
    "finally , of course , there is qcd itself .",
    "the following conjecture suggests itself : any system which exhibits the spontaneous breaking of a local symmetry by a pairing mechanism has a sign problem when formulated in terms of local gauge covariant degrees of freedom .",
    "significant progress  both technical and psychological  has been made in qcd(@xmath0 ) , resulting in the first non - trivial lgt prediction in the @xmath1 plane .",
    "for once we have been lucky ; the high-@xmath2 low-@xmath0 region where simulations can probe is precisely the regime of direct relevance to rhic phenomenology .",
    "i anticipate much activity in this area in the coming year . at @xmath22",
    "a quantitative description of nuclear or quark matter regrettably seems as elusive as ever ",
    "however there are at least two model systems where lgt simulations can now be said to be doing condensed matter physics _ ab initio _ , ie . with matter formed from the fundamental quanta of the theory .",
    "two color qcd , a confining theory with no fermi surface , describes the condensation of tightly - bound bosons , and thus resembles superfluid @xmath148he .",
    "the njl model , a theory without confinement but possessing a fermi surface , displays unexpectedly interesting behaviour in @xmath168 and certainly has the potential to exhibit a fully - fledged bcs mechanism in @xmath175 , providing a relativistic analogue of superfluid @xmath127he .",
    "simulations of njl@xmath176 will furnish non - trivial tests of model calculations of color superconductivity @xcite .",
    "ultimately , though , a microscopic description of the superconducting state may actually _ require _ a sign problem .",
