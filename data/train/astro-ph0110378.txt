    "all @xmath470 known extrasolar planets have been discovered by the precision doppler technique over the last six years ( marcy , cochran , mayor 2000 ) . these include four published multiple planet systems ( butler et al .",

    "precision doppler surveys are biased toward finding massive companions in small orbits , as these two characteristics enhance the doppler amplitude and allow many orbits to be observed quickly . at the current epoch , all of the confirmed extrasolar planets orbit within 4 au of their host stars .",
    "this is primarily due to the time baseline of the active surveys , but also because the doppler amplitude of an orbiting companion decreases with increasing orbital radii .",
    "a 1 m@xmath1  planet in a 0.05 au orbit induces a maximum doppler amplitude of 127 on its star , but at 3 au this is reduced to 16 . while doppler surveys with precision of 10 to 20 can easily detect 1 m@xmath1  planets at 0.05 au , they are hard pressed to detect similar planets at 3 au .    due to their larger mass ,",
    "brown dwarf companions are much easier to detect than planets .",

    "1997 , esa 1997 ) .",

    "stars with known stellar companions within 2 arcsec are removed from the observing list as it is operationally difficult to get an uncontaminated spectrum of a star with a nearby companion .",

    "thus , the measured change in the velocity of the star from 1987 to 2 dec 1997 was + 2.7 . in comparison ,",
    "our orbital solution predicts a change of + 2.4 during that 10year period , in good agreement within errors .    with a semimajor axis a = 11.6 au , the companion orbits about 0.6 arcseconds from the primary .",
    "for a minimum mass companion ( @xmath15= 1 ) , the primary would be about 5.5 v magnitudes brighter than the companion .",
    "the value of @xmath15is likely greater than 0.5 , as smaller values would yield a companion with an expected difference in v magnitude of 3 or less , which would be detectable in our keck spectra .",
    "this binary thus makes an interesting ao target .",
    "a total of 1,200 stars are currently being surveyed by the keck , lick , and anglo ",
    "australian precision velocity surveys .",
    "all three of these programs use the iodine cell technique , and all three have demonstrated long term precision of 3 ( butler & marcy 1997 ; vogt et al . 2000 ; butler et al . 2001 ) .",
    "these three surveys have no selection bias against stars with brown dwarf companions .    a total of 48 substellar candidates ( @xmath0@xmath3 80 m@xmath1 ) have been uncovered from these surveys , of which 44 are planet candidates with plausible masses below the deuterium burning limit ( @xmath0@xmath3 @xmath37 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "all of these companions have either been published or are currently submitted to referee journals , including 3 new companions from the aat survey ( tinney et al .",
    "2002 ; jones et al . 2002 ) .",
    "two of the four brown dwarf candidates from these surveys , hd 169822 and hd 164427 ( tinney et al .",
    "2001 ) , have been revealed by hipparcos astrometry to be m dwarfs .",

    "1996 ) .    the mass function of the 46 surviving substellar candidates from the keck , lick , and anglo ",
    "australian surveys is shown in figure 13 .",
    "all but 3 of these companions orbit within 3 au .",
    "the mass function is flat and sparsely populated above 10 m@xmath1 , and then begins rising abruptly below 10 m@xmath1 .    within 3",
    "au these surveys are complete for companions having @xmath0@xmath38 10 m@xmath1 .",
    "incompleteness is greatest for the smallest mass bin , @xmath0@xmath3 1 m@xmath1 .",
    "companions with @xmath0@xmath3 1 m@xmath5  are only detectable if they orbit within 1 au .",
    "these selection effects strongly favor the detection of companions with @xmath0@xmath38 10 m@xmath1  at the expense of companions with @xmath0@xmath3 1 m@xmath1 . in spite of this , 15 companions having @xmath0@xmath3 1 m@xmath1",
    "have been detected , while only two have been found with @xmath0@xmath38 10 m@xmath1 .",
    "the abrupt and discontinuous jump in the mass function below 10 m@xmath1  empirically sets the threshold between planets and brown dwarfs at @xmath410 m@xmath1 .",
    "coincidentally the deuterium - burning limit resides near this limit at 12 m@xmath1",
    ".    the two companions with the largest mass in figure 13 are hd 168443c ( @xmath0= 17 m@xmath1 ) and hd 184860 ( @xmath0= 32 m@xmath1 ) .",
    "as described in the previous section , hipparcos can not put an upper limit on the mass of the companion to hd 184860 because of a nearby stellar companion . a moderate inclination of 23 degrees would be be sufficient to push this brown dwarf candidate into the m dwarf mass range . for the case of hd 168443c ,",
    "hipparcos astrometry is able to put an upper limit on the mass of the companion of 42 m@xmath1  ( marcy et al .",
    "brown dwarf companions orbiting within 3 au of main sequence stars are rare , with at most about 1 such companion per 500 stars .",
    "in contrast , planetary mass companions are common .",
    "relatively few planets have been found orbiting metal poor stars ( butler et al . 2000 , santos et al .",
    "planets orbiting stars of less than solar metallicity ( [ fe / h ] @xmath3 @xmath30 ) are indicated in figure 13 by the cross hatched area .",
    "they constitute about 12% of the planets found in the keck , lick , and anglo - australian surveys ( even though two  thirds of the field stars have metallicity less than solar ) .",
    "if planets are common around metal poor stars , these planets must either have smaller masses or larger orbital radii than the planets found to date .",
