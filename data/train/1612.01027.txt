    "the resolved stellar mass method is truly powerful , since it can solve not only for the mass , but for other physical parameters of the sps models , based solely on photometry . resolved maps of stellar mass",

    "we must also mention that in this research we use sps models that assume a constant metallicity along the sfh .",

    "* ) resulting from an evolving metallicity along a coherent sfh within an individual galaxy are probably different from the cmlr established for the general galaxy population .",
    "furthermore , biases in mass determinations from cmlr can be even more significant at high redshifts than for local studies  ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "the absolute maximum in this case occurs around @xmath41 , and marks the angular offset between the spiral arms in the @xmath14-band and the dust lanes in the @xmath23 image .",
    "this means that if we rotate the spiral arms in the @xmath14-band by @xmath42 , clockwise , they will match the spatial location of the dust lanes .    as is well known , disk galaxies , when studied at different wavelengths , often show significant differences  ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "equivalently , @xmath195 is not affected by @xmath229 .    regarding the choice of the imf , our default is  @xcite .",
    "stellar masses can be @xmath232 times larger with the  @xcite imf , and @xmath233 times larger with the  @xcite imf .",
    "we also have quantified that using only a constant @xmath2 ( i.e. , skipping iteration number 3 ) yields masses per pixel @xmath234 higher on average , and up to @xmath235 larger in localized regions .",
    "stellar mass is an intrinsic property of galaxies , independent of inclination to the line of sight .",
    "stellar mass determinations from broad - band colors , however , are independent of inclination only as surface brightness at different wavelengths is independent of it .",
    "@xcite study the effects of inclination on mass estimates , by comparing a statistically significant sample of edge - on ( @xmath236 ) and face - on ( @xmath237 ) sdss galaxies .",
    "they find no statistical difference for masses derived from @xmath9-band photometry by  @xcite but , on the other hand , point out the very important corrections with inclination that are necessary for the @xmath238-band  @xcite .",
    "we remind the reader that all our calculations are based on the _ effective _ @xmath2 .",
    "extinction effects may introduce biases with inclination . in subsequent publications",
    "we will address this issue in more detail .",
    "[ conclu ]    we have demonstrated quantitatively that resolved maps of stellar mass obtained by the maximum likelihood estimate  ( as in zcr ) yield biased spatial structures .",
    "the bias consists in a filamentary morphology , and a spatial coincidence between dust lanes and purported stellar mass surface density .",
    "the bias is due to a limited @xmath2 accuracy ( @xmath239 dex ) arising from uncertainties inherent to observations , and to degeneracies between templates of similar colors in the sps libraries .",
    "similar observed colors will yield the mode @xmath2 . here , we have succeeded in mitigating the bias with the bsp algorithm we have developed .",
    "we have applied the new algorithm to m  51 and a pilot sample of 90 spirals .",
    "bsp effectively identifies and isolates the old stellar population , and the output mass - maps bear more resemblance to nir structures .",
    "the results also indicate that total resolved mass estimates obtained by adding up the pixel - by - pixel contributions are on average @xmath240 lower with bsp than with the zcr@xmath93 approach .",
    "hence , unresolved stellar mass estimates for our pilot sample underestimate the mass by @xmath241 when compared to the resolved zcr@xmath93 results , but only by @xmath183 vis -  - vis bsp .",
    "the fact that the same sps libraries can produce , or not , filamentary structures where the mass is supposedly organized indicates that such structures are merely an artifact of the method , and not real massive features present in disk galaxies .",
    "an additional advantage of using a _ spatial structure prior _ for mass estimates is its independence of sps model parameters ( e.g. , sfh , metallicity , dust , age , etc . ) or ingredients ( e.g. , tp - agb phase , or imf ) .",
    "galaxy masses determined from sps models should be compared to results of independent studies , e.g. , the disk mass survey  ( dms , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "systematic uncertainties may be constrained through these comparisons  ( see also * ? ? ?",

    "<S> to unresolved studies , resolved methods yield , on average , higher fractions of stellar mass for galaxies . in this work </S>",
    "<S> we improve the current method in order to mitigate a bias related to the resolved spatial distribution derived for the mass . </S>",
    "<S> the bias consists in an apparent filamentary mass distribution , and a spatial coincidence between mass structures and dust lanes near spiral arms . </S>",
    "<S> the improved method is based on iterative bayesian marginalization , through a new algorithm we have named bayesian successive priors ( bsp ) . </S>",
    "<S> we have applied bsp to m  51 , and to a pilot sample of 90 spiral galaxies from the ohio state university bright spiral galaxy survey . by comparing quantitatively both methods , we find that the average fraction of stellar mass missed by unresolved studies is only half than previously thought . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast with the previous method , the output bsp mass - maps bear a better resemblance to near infrared images . </S>"
