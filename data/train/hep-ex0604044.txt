    "<S> we present measurements of the inclusive branching fractions for the decays @xmath0 and @xmath1 , using 281 pb@xmath2 of data collected on the @xmath3 resonance with the cleo - c detector . </S>",
    "<S> we find @xmath4 and @xmath5 . </S>",
    "<S> using the known @xmath6 meson lifetimes , we obtain the ratio @xmath7 , confirming isospin invariance at the level of 3% . </S>",
    "<S> the positron momentum spectra from @xmath8 and @xmath9 have consistent shapes .    </S>",
    "<S> the study of inclusive @xmath6 semileptonic decays is important for several reasons . </S>",
    "<S> first , by comparing the inclusive branching fractions of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 mesons with the sum of the measured exclusive branching fractions , one can determine whether there are unobserved semileptonic decay modes . </S>",
    "<S> previous data suggest that the lightest vector and pseudoscalar resonances saturate the hadronic spectra @xcite </S>",
    "<S> . this may be due to the relatively low momentum of the daughter @xmath10 quark , that favors the formation of s - wave hadrons . </S>",
    "<S> alternatively , this may be an indication that heavy quark effective theory may still be valid at the charm quark mass scale @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in addition , since accurate experimental determinations of the @xmath9 and @xmath8 lifetimes are available @xcite , measurements of semileptonic branching fractions determine the corresponding semileptonic widths , @xmath11 and @xmath12 . </S>",
    "<S> these widths are expected to be equal , modulo small corrections introduced by electromagnetic effects . </S>",
    "<S> weak annihilation diagrams can produce more dramatic effects on the cabibbo suppressed partial widths @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> as these contributions may also influence the extraction of @xmath13 from inclusive @xmath14 meson semileptonic decays , it is important to understand them well . finally , better knowledge of the inclusive positron spectra can be used to improved modeling of the `` cascade '' decays @xmath15 and thus is important in several measurements of @xmath16 decays .    </S>",
    "<S> the use of ratios of semileptonic branching fractions as a probe of relative lifetimes of the @xmath6 mesons was suggested by pais and treiman @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> indeed the early measurements of the ratio of the @xmath8 and @xmath9 semileptonic branching fractions gave the first surprising evidence for the lifetime difference between these two charmed mesons @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> later , the first measurement of the individual charged and neutral @xmath6 inclusive semileptonic branching fractions was performed by mark iii @xcite , with an overall relative error of about 12 - 16% on the individual branching fractions , and 19% on their ratio . the inclusive decay @xmath17 was subsequently studied by argus @xcite and cleo @xcite , using the angular correlation between the @xmath18 emitted in a @xmath19 decay and the @xmath20 emitted in the subsequent @xmath21 decay . </S>",
    "<S> the more precise cleo result has a 5% relative error , dominated by systematic uncertainties . </S>",
    "<S> our measurements exploit a clean @xmath22 sample at threshold , and thus achieves significantly smaller systematic errors , through low backgrounds and well understood efficiencies .    </S>",
    "<S> we use a 281 pb@xmath2 data sample , collected at the @xmath23 center - of - mass energy ( @xmath24 3.73 gev ) , with the cleo - c detector @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this detector includes a tracking system composed of a six - layer low - mass drift chamber and a 47-layer central drift chamber , measuring charged particle momentum and direction , a state of the art csi(tl ) electromagnetic calorimeter , and a ring imaging cherenkov ( rich ) hadron identification system . </S>",
    "<S> all these components are critical to an efficient and highly selective electron and positron identification algorithm . </S>",
    "<S> the charged particle momentum resolution is approximately 0.6% at 1 gev . </S>",
    "<S> the csi(tl ) calorimeter measures the electron and photon energies with a resolution of 2.2% at @xmath25 gev and 5% at @xmath26=100 mev , which , combined with the excellent tracking system , provides one of the @xmath27 identification variables , @xmath28 , where @xmath26 is the energy measured in the calorimeter and @xmath29 is the momentum measured in the tracking system . </S>",
    "<S> the tracking system provides charged particle discrimination too , through the measurement of the specific ionization @xmath30 . </S>",
    "<S> charged particles are also identified over most of their momentum range in the rich detector @xcite . in particular , </S>",
    "<S> rich identification plays a crucial role at momenta where the specific ionization bands of two particle species cross each other and @xmath30 does not provide any discrimination power .    </S>",
    "<S> we use a tagging technique similar to the one pioneered by the mark iii collaboration @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> details on the tagging selection procedure are given in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> we select events containing either the decay @xmath31 or the decay @xmath32 . </S>",
    "<S> we use only these modes , because they have very low background . note that charge conjugate modes are implied throughout this paper . in this analysis </S>",
    "<S> we exploit the flavor information provided by the tagging @xmath6 : the @xmath33 charge sign provides a flavor tag , whereas the charge of the tag daughter @xmath34 is used for @xmath35 flavor assignment .    </S>",
    "<S> we analyze all the recorded events at the @xmath3 and retain the events that contain at least one candidate @xmath36 or @xmath37 . </S>",
    "<S> two kinematic variables are used to select these candidates : the beam - constrained mass , @xmath38 , and the energy difference @xmath39 , where @xmath40 , where @xmath41 represents the beam energy and @xmath42 represent the 4-vectors of the candidate daughters . for @xmath35 tags , </S>",
    "<S> the measured standard deviations ( @xmath43 ) in @xmath39 and @xmath44 are @xmath45 mev and @xmath46 mev , while for @xmath47 tags , @xmath48 mev and @xmath49 mev . </S>",
    "<S> we select events that are within 3 @xmath43 of the expected @xmath39 ( 0 gev ) and @xmath50 ( @xmath51 ) for the channels considered . in order to determine the total number of tags , we count the events within the selected @xmath39-@xmath44 intervals </S>",
    "<S> ; then we subtract the combinatoric background inferred from two @xmath52 sideband regions on both sides of the @xmath53 signal peak , with a @xmath54 gap from the signal interval . </S>",
    "<S> the yields in the signal region are @xmath55 and @xmath56 . </S>",
    "<S> the corresponding yields in the sideband region are @xmath57 and @xmath58 . </S>",
    "<S> we correct the sideband yields with scale factors accounting for the relative area of the background in the signal and sideband intervals ( 1.047 for @xmath35 and 1.23 for @xmath33 ) . </S>",
    "<S> the scaling factors are inferred from the background component of the @xmath50 fits . </S>",
    "<S> we obtain @xmath59 tagged events , and @xmath60 tagged events . as we are interested in counting the number of signal events , and not in measuring a production rate , the errors only reflect the uncertainty in the background subtraction . note </S>",
    "<S> that the estimated background is only 1.7% of the signal for @xmath35 and 3.9% for @xmath33 .    for each event selected , we study all the charged tracks not used in the tagging mode . </S>",
    "<S> we select the ones that are well - measured , and whose helical trajectories approach the event origin within a distance of 5 mm in the projection transverse to the beam and 5 cm in the projection along the beam axis </S>",
    "<S> . each track must include at least 50% of the hits expected for its momentum . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , it must be within the rich fiducial volume ( @xmath61 ) , where @xmath62 is the angle with respect to the beams . </S>",
    "<S> finally , we require the charged track momentum @xmath63 to be greater than or equal to 0.2 gev , as the particle species separation becomes increasingly difficult at low momenta .    </S>",
    "<S> candidate positrons ( and electrons ) are selected on the basis of a likelihood ratio constructed from three inputs : the ratio between the energy deposited in the calorimeter and the momentum measured in the tracking system , the specific ionization @xmath30 measured in the drift chamber , and rich information @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> our particle identification selection criteria have an average efficiency of 0.95 in the momentum region 0.3 - 1.0 gev , and 0.71 in the region 0.2 - 0.3 gev .    </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath20 sample contains a small fraction of hadrons that pass our selection criteria . as the probability that a @xmath64 is identified as an @xmath27 at a given momentum is different from the corresponding @xmath34 to @xmath27 misidentification probability , we need to know the @xmath34 and @xmath64 yields separately to subtract this background . </S>",
    "<S> we select @xmath64 and @xmath34 samples using a particle identification variable ( pid ) that combines rich and @xmath30 information , if the rich identification variable @xcite is available and @xmath65 ; alternatively pid relies on @xmath30 only . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath64 sample contains also a @xmath66 component , as our pid variable is not very selective ; however , as our goal is only to unfold the true @xmath27 spectrum , we do not need to correct for this effect .    </S>",
    "<S> we separate @xmath27 , @xmath64 , and @xmath34 into `` right - sign '' and `` wrong - sign '' samples according to their charge correlation to the flavor tag . </S>",
    "<S> right - sign assignment is based on the expected @xmath27 charge on the basis of the flavor of the decaying @xmath6 . </S>",
    "<S> the true @xmath27 populations in the right - sign and wrong - sign samples are obtained through an unfolding procedure , using the matrix : @xmath67 here @xmath68 , @xmath69 , @xmath70 represent the raw measured spectra in the corresponding particle species , and the coefficient @xmath71 accounts for the fact that the efficiencies for @xmath64 and @xmath66 selection are not necessarily identical , especially at low momenta . </S>",
    "<S> the quantities @xmath72 , @xmath73 , and @xmath74 represent the true @xmath27 , @xmath64 and @xmath34 spectra : the present paper focuses on the extraction of @xmath72 . as the @xmath64 to @xmath27 misidentification probability is quite small , the effect of a small @xmath66 component in the measured @xmath64 population @xmath69 is negligible . </S>",
    "<S> the efficiencies @xmath75 account for track finding , track selection criteria , and particle identification losses . </S>",
    "<S> the tracking efficiencies are obtained from a monte carlo simulation of @xmath22 events in the cleo - c detector . </S>",
    "<S> the generator incorporates all the known @xmath6 decay properties , includes initial state radiation ( isr ) , and final state radiation ( fsr ) effects , the latter are modeled with the program photos @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the particle identification efficiencies are determined from data . </S>",
    "<S> we study the @xmath34 selection efficiencies using a sample of @xmath76 decays , and @xmath64 selection efficiencies using @xmath77 and @xmath78 decays . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath20 identification efficiency is extracted from a radiative bhabha sample . a correction for the difference between the @xmath22 event environment and the simpler radiative bhabha environment ( </S>",
    "<S> two charged tracks and one shower ) is derived using a monte carlo sample where a real electron track stripped from a radiative bhabha event is merged with tracks from a simulated hadronic environment . </S>",
    "<S> the off - diagonal elements are products of tracking efficiencies and particle misidentification probabilities , where @xmath79 is defined as the probability that particle @xmath16 is identified as particle @xmath80 . </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath79 parameters are determined using @xmath27 samples from radiative bhabhas , and @xmath34 and @xmath64 from @xmath81 and @xmath78 . the @xmath27 spectrum from radiative bhabhas </S>",
    "<S> is divided in 50 mev momentum bins to determine the corresponding misidentification probabilities , whereas the @xmath34 and @xmath64 populations are subdivided into 100 mev momentum bins to reduce the statistical uncertainty . </S>",
    "<S> the hadron to @xmath20 misidentification probabilities are of the order of 0.1% over most of the momentum range and below 1% even in the regions where @xmath30 separation is less effective .    </S>",
    "<S> there are background sources that are charge symmetric , mostly produced by @xmath82 dalitz decays and @xmath83 conversions . </S>",
    "<S> we subtract the wrong sign unfolded yields from the corresponding right sign yields to account for them , motivated by monte carlo studies that confirm the accuracy of this method .    in order to subtract the combinatoric background , we repeat the unfolding procedure determining the true @xmath20 yields from measured @xmath20 , @xmath84 , and @xmath85 samples where the tags are selected from @xmath39 sidebands . </S>",
    "<S> the decays @xmath86 and @xmath87 have very little background : the @xmath35 sidebands give a combinatoric background estimate that is 0.2% of the signal yield and the @xmath33 sidebands give a combinatoric background estimate that is 1.8% of the signal yield . </S>",
    "<S> table [ tab : cleantags ] shows the results of the intermediate steps involved in the determination of the net @xmath20 yields . </S>",
    "<S> efficiency corrections increase unfolded @xmath20 yields with respect to uncorrected @xmath20 yields , while the subtraction of the contribution from misidentified hadrons reduces them . </S>",
    "<S> the former effect is dominant for the right - sign positron sample , while it is comparable in size to the background subtraction in the wrong - sign sample . </S>",
    "<S> the final yields , identified as `` corrected net @xmath20 '' include acceptance corrections related to the ( @xmath88 ) cut , and doubly - cabibbo suppressed ( dcsd ) effects in @xmath9 decays . </S>",
    "<S> as we are using the charge of the tagging @xmath33 , rather than its @xmath34 daughter charge , this correction is not needed in the charged mode .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.5 cm    .[tab : cleantags ] positron unfolding procedure and corrections . </S>",
    "<S> the errors reported in the intermediate yields reflect only statistical uncertainties . [ </S>",
    "<S> cols=\"<,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     finally , we can compare these widths with the sum of the semileptonic decay widths for the pseudoscalar and vector hadronic final states recently published by cleo @xcite : @xmath89% and @xmath90% : the measured exclusive modes are consistent with saturating the inclusive widths , although there is some room left for higher multiplicity modes . </S>",
    "<S> the composition of the inclusive hadronic spectra is dominated by the low lying resonances in the @xmath91 and @xmath92 , in striking contrast with @xmath14 semileptonic decays , where a sizeable component of the inclusive branching fraction is still unaccounted for @xcite .    in conclusion </S>",
    "<S> , we report improved measurements of the absolute branching fractions for the inclusive semileptonic decays @xmath93 and @xmath94 . using the measured @xmath6 meson lifetimes , </S>",
    "<S> the ratio @xmath95 is extracted , and it is consistent with isospin invariance . </S>",
    "<S> the shapes of the spectra are consistent with one another within error . </S>"
