    "the doorway states for one - nucleon transfer reactions are eigenstates of nucleon in the static field of nucleus which is the convolution of the free - space nucleon - nucleon forces with the nucleon density distributions in nucleus @xcite .",
    "they are model - independent quantities because ( a )  the free - space @xmath0 forces are independent of nuclear medium effects and ( b )  the nucleon density distributions are deduced from the electron ",
    "nucleus @xcite and proton ",
    "nucleus @xcite elastic scattering data .",
    "the corresponding eigenvalue problem is that of nucleon in central field which can be solved with any desired accuracy . for these reasons",
    "the doorway states can be used as a very trustworthy test for current nuclear models .",
    "let us discuss some results of ref.@xcite from this point of view .",
    "the nuclear relativity within the walecka @xcite model is confirmed to be actually existing phenomenon .",
    "the dominant contribution to the isovector part of the static field arises from the many - particle @xmath0 forces because the @xmath1 meson ( vector  isovector ) and @xmath2 meson ( scalar  isovector ) fields arising from the two - particle forces nearly cancel each other . at the same time",
    "the isovector nuclear potential is exclusively of the @xmath1 meson origin within the quantum hadrodynamics @xcite .",
    "the reason for this wrong qhd result is the neglect of the @xmath2 meson field in spite of the fact that both the @xmath1 and @xmath2 meson exchanges are taken into account in the two - particle @xmath0 forces @xcite .    \\3 .",
    "the contributions from the two - particle , three - particle and four - particle forces to the isoscalar part of the static field are found to be @xmath3mev , @xmath4mev , @xmath5mev .",
    "this is in conflict with such leading principles of the effective field theory as the naive dimensional analysis and the naturalness @xcite .",
    "indeed , the values of the forces which are estimated according to the above principles are @xcite @xmath6 ( @xmath7 is the mass of nucleon ) and therefore the expected relation between @xmath8 , @xmath9 and @xmath10 is @xmath11 .",
    "in fact it is @xmath12 thus suggesting that there is something wrong with the naturalness .",
    "discussion of this point is continued in the next section .",
    "as discussed in ref.@xcite the isoscalar part of the static field may contain contributions from higher ( five - particle , six - particle , etc . ) many - particle forces .",
    "they could be taken into account by increasing the number of terms in the power series expansion @xmath13 for the static field @xcite",
    "( @xmath14 is the nucleon density distribution ) thus introducing an indeterminate number of additional adjustable parameters .",
    "instead we use the fact that ultimately the underlying reason for many - particle forces is the nonlinearity of strong interaction .",
    "we introduce an auxiliary scalar - isoscalar field @xmath15 with the lagrangian density @xmath16 thus obeying the following equation : @xmath17 @xmath18 is the nuclear scalar density . as discussed in ref.@xcite the many - particle forces of all ranks",
    "are taken into account in this way .",
    "the field @xmath15 contains the `` two - particle '' component @xmath19 obeying the equation @xmath20 this component must be eliminated because the `` two - particle '' contribution to the static field is determined by the free - space two - particle forces @xcite .",
    "so the many - particle contribution to the scalar ",
    "isoscalar field is @xmath21    let us analyse this expression disregarding for a moment the laplace terms of eqs .",
    "( 5 ) and ( 6 ) which are responsible for the finite range of the forces , although these terms are included in the actual calculations . but",
    "as demonstrated in ref.@xcite they are of little importance thus not affecting the results of the below analysis .",
    "as demonstrated in ref.@xcite the radial dependence of @xmath22 has the form which is schematically shown in fig.1 . as seen from the figure it is negative at @xmath23 , positive at @xmath24 with a maximum @xmath25 in this region , and vanishing at @xmath26 . without the laplace terms",
    "@xmath27 so @xmath28 but as follows from ( 6 ) and ( 7 ) @xmath29 and therefore @xmath30 where @xmath31 .",
    "let us introduce the dimensionless quantities @xmath32 and @xmath33 , @xmath34 in these units @xmath35 the maximum @xmath25 occurs at @xmath36 , so @xmath37 the parameter @xmath38 is negative since @xmath39 , see the figure .",
    "the parameter @xmath40 is negative too provided the coupling constant @xmath41 is positive .",
    "actually the sign of @xmath41 is insignificant since the physical field is @xmath42 thus being expressed through @xmath43 .",
    "the potential energy of the scalar field is also of the form ( 4 ) within the relativistic mean - field approach @xcite , the parameters @xmath40 and @xmath38 being negative too . in this way the sign of the rmf parameters is confirmed .",
    "it should be mentioned that the values of the rmf parameters are determined from the experimental data which include the important correlation effects ( binding energies , density distributions , low - energy spectra etc . ) , and therefore they are model - dependent ( the model - independent treatment of the correlations does not exist ) . in contrast , our parameters are determined from the doorway state energies thus being model - independent .    in terms of the @xmath44 and @xmath45 quantities the contribution to the scalar ",
    "isoscalar field from the many - particle forces is @xmath46 the second term in the rhs of ( 15 ) arises from the symmetry energy .",
    "the quantities @xmath32 and @xmath33 obey the equations @xmath47      the nda prescription @xcite for the scalar field potential energy is @xcite @xmath49 where @xmath50 mev . according to the concept of naturalness all the coefficients @xmath51",
    "must be of order of unity .",
    "comparison between ( 20 ) and ( 4 ) together with ( 14 ) and ( 16 ) gives @xmath52 as follows from the values ( 19 ) of the parameters @xmath53 , @xmath54 , the concept of naturalness thus being not confirmed .    as demonstrated by the calculations for the few - nucleon systems",
    "the effect of many - particle forces is relatively small @xcite .",
    "this result is confirmed but the underlying physical reason is different from that provided by the effective field theory . according to the latter it is decrease of the strength with increasing rank of the force , see eq.(1 ) .",
    "as follows from above this scenario does not hold : the actual reason is the cancellation of the contributions from many - particle forces of different ranks ( the physics is believed to be the same for complex nuclei and few - nucleon systems ) ."
