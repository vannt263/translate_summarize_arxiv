    ", we propose a novel encoding scheme for various algebraic codes ; this scheme is considered to be the natural generalization of the well - known encoding for rs codes .",
    "we first establish a simple but non - systematic encoding that employs two - dimensional ( 2-d ) inverse discrete fourier transforms ( idft ) and that generalizes the encoding for rs codes by using one - dimensional idft ( that is , the mattson ",
    "solomon polynomial ) .",
    "since the syndromes correspond to the discrete fourier transform ( dft ) , we also obtain a concise decoding via berlekamp  massey  sakata ( bms ) algorithm .",
    "next , we establish systematic encoding in the sense of the separation of given information and generated redundant in a resulting code - word . this second method of encoding employs a grbner basis and its 2-d linear feedback shift - register and corresponds to the euclidean division by the generator polynomial in the case of rs codes .",
    "both the methods often employ the enlargement of the finite - field arrays to the entire plane by the elements of grbner bases , typically , the defining equation of the algebraic curves . as a more essential idea of our encoding and decoding scheme , we can mention the following duality for substitution @xmath0 then , the rational points having any zero are exceptional ; however , they can be treated similarly to the case of lengthened rs codes as shown in section [ treatment ] .",

    "[ fourier encoding](g ) , the information @xmath104 ( and its extension @xmath105 ) is obtained by ( e ) minus ( f ) .",

    "if we perform idft for the negative @xmath125 of the extended array , the redundant part can be obtained since the resulting values on @xmath108 are zero by theorem [ lemma of fourier ] and their dft ( i.e. , syndrome ) agrees with @xmath126 . if we perform idft for the subtraction @xmath127 ( fig .",
    "[ systematic](j ) ) , i.e. , we compute @xmath128 then @xmath129 is a code - word in @xmath32 since @xmath130 for @xmath30 .",

    "[ systematic](k ) , and in fact we have @xmath131 for @xmath132 since the idft of @xmath133 vanishes at @xmath108 by theorem [ lemma of fourier ] .",
    "while the error - value estimation was performed by using the idft of ( n ) in @xcite , it is efficiently incorporated into our procedure . in the encoding of section [ encoding 2-d ] , each procedure of encoding and decoding contains either the dft or idft .",
    "although in this section , each step of encoding and decoding requires both the dft and idft , we can use only one dft calculator for all transforms in practical circuits for the encoder and decoder .",
    "recall that the systematic matrix - encoding described in section [ codes on algebraic curves ] requires multiplications of the @xmath41 matrix ; our method requires the calculators of the 2-d feedback shift - registers and memory - elements for at most @xmath134 coefficients , which correspond to the @xmath45 coefficients of the generator polynomial for rs codes .",
    "our encoding and decoding scheme is widely applied to various algebraic codes such as 2-d cyclic codes and hyperbolic cascaded rs ( hcrs ) codes ; for these codes , the encodings in sections 3 and 4 are similarly performed except for the total order in the bms algorithm . here",
    ", we deal with the systematic encoding of hcrs codes .    in this section",
    "let @xmath135 .",
    "a hcrs code @xcite over @xmath4 is defined as @xmath136 where @xmath137 .",

    "[ hcrs ] , @xmath140 over @xmath59 is demonstrated for four - error correction .",
    "the non - systematic encoding is equal to the idft of ( p ) . to encode systematically ,",
    "we first compute a grbner basis of an ideal @xmath141 , where @xmath142/(x^{q-1}-1,y^{q-1}-1,)$ ] , with respect to a total order @xmath143 @xmath144 the elements of the basis that is needed for the extension in the systematic encoding are shown below .",
    "@xmath145 then , the values after dft on @xmath16 in ( q ) are extended by the recurrence formula similar to .",
    "thus , the idft of ( r ) , where ( r ) equals ( q ) minus the extended array , is a systematic code - word ( s ) .    to decode a received word ( t ) from the channel ,",
    "we perform , for syndrome values on @xmath16 in ( u ) , the bms algorithm with respect to the total order ( @xmath146 ) @xcite . in the case of our example , the error - locator polynomials are expressed as follows . @xmath147",
    "the recurrence similar to by the above basis extends the syndrome values on @xmath16 to the entire plane , as fig .",
    "[ hcrs](v ) . finally , the idft of @xmath148 in fig .",
    "[ hcrs ] provides the correct transmitted word fig .",
    "[ hcrs](w ) .",
    "recall the encoding for rs codes by euclidean division : @xmath149 where @xmath150 is an information polynomial with @xmath151 for @xmath152 ; @xmath153 , the generator polynomial ; @xmath154 , the remainder of the division with quotient @xmath155 .",
    "then , it is apparent that @xmath43 from @xmath156 is a code - word of the rs code @xmath157 with @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "this method is _ systematic _ , i.e. , @xmath160 for @xmath161 .",
    "if we have received a polynomial @xmath162 containing an error polynomial @xmath163 in the channel , the values of syndromes @xmath164 can be computed as @xmath165 by substituting the roots of @xmath166 into @xmath167 .",
    "we notice that @xmath168 can be also considered to be the dft of @xmath169 .",
    "thus , we obtain another encoding method ( _ non - systematic _ ) by the idft @xmath170 .",
    "then , @xmath171 is another code - word of @xmath32 since @xmath172    it is possible to systematically encode by using an alternative procedure . from , we obtain @xmath173 for @xmath152 .",
    "moreover , we define array @xmath174 inductively by @xmath175 where @xmath176 . then , it follows that @xmath177 with @xmath178 not only for @xmath179 but also for @xmath161 .",
    "thus , the idft @xmath180 for @xmath174 is observed to agree with @xmath181 of @xmath154 by using fourier inversion formula ; @xmath182 again indicates the encoding , and moreover we obtain two ways of calculating @xmath154 , i.e. , a commutative diagram .",
    "thus , we obtain two encoding methods for rs codes , which we have generalized .",
    "we generate @xmath183 for @xmath73 recursively from @xmath184 as in the encoding at section [ encoding 2-d ] and [ systematic encoding ] , which is stated here more precisely .",
    "it may be assumed that we have the support @xmath185 and that each grbner basis consists of @xmath186 elements @xmath187 , where @xmath188 with @xmath189 and @xmath190 .",
    "then the recurrence for @xmath191 is defined as follows : @xmath192 the resulting values do not depend on the order of the generation because of the property of grbner bases .",
    "with regard to the systematic encoding in section 4 , we can treat locations including zero in a manner similar to the case of non - zero locations .",
    "there are three @xmath59-rational points @xmath193 , @xmath194 , and @xmath195 for our example of hermitian codes , which are denoted by the shaded boxes in the top row of fig .",
    "[ zero](x ) .",
    "although we can not compute the dft for three information symbols at these locations , we note that if an error @xmath196 has occurred on , e.g. , @xmath193 , then the syndrome values are all @xmath57 except for @xmath197 at @xmath198 since they are computed by the substitution of @xmath193 into @xmath199 .",
    "we also note that the idft of @xmath200 equals an @xmath201 all-@xmath197 array .",
    "thus the analogue of dft is obtained for information 7 at @xmath193 as only 7 at @xmath198 .",
    "similarly , the analogue is obtained for information 5 at @xmath194 as only @xmath202 $ ] in the first row of @xmath63 , which also equals the one - dimensional ( 1-d ) dft for @xmath203 $ ] ; for information 2 at @xmath195 , the analogue is obtained as @xmath204 $ ] at the top , which is also the 1-d dft for @xmath205 $ ] .",
    "hence , we obtain the analogue of dft for the array ( x ) as the array ( y ) by summing and obtain the redundant part of the code - word ( aa ) by the idft of the extended array ( z ) .",
    "notice that the idft of @xmath206 such as in section 4 provides the sum of the parts of the code - word on @xmath63 and the idft of the analogue arrays of dft , i.e. , all-@xmath207 array , all-@xmath208 array except @xmath209^{t}$ ] in the third column , which is the idft of @xmath210 , and all-@xmath208 except @xmath211^{t}$ ] in the seventh column .",
