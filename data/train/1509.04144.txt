    "measurement - device - independent quantum key distribution mdi - qkd @xcite promises to be a remarkably effective solution for the practical implementation of the next generation of qkd infrastructures , in which privacy should be granted over a quantum network . in mdi - qkd",
    "the authorized users of the network , alice and bob , exploit a swapping - like protocol where secret correlations are established by the measurement of a third untrusted party , the relay @xcite .",
    "this performs a bell measurement but , in order to achieve security , it is not required to pass a bell test . by contrast , in full device independent qkd @xcite , the privacy of the shared key depends on passing a bell test , which is still an operation performed with very poor success rates @xcite .",
    "the power of the mdi approach relies indeed on its practicality : one can achieve high - rate side - channel - free unconditionally secure network communication .    in recent years the study of qkd protocols based on quantum continuous variables ( cvs ) @xcite has attracted increasingly attention because of several appealing properties of cv systems : protocols use bright coherent states , and exploit standard telecommunication technologies ; in particular coherent detection techniques , already developed for classical optical communication @xcite . in addition , cv - qkd is interesting for the relatively simple implementation of protocols at different frequencies @xcite .",
    "finally , exploiting cv point - to - point protocol with state - of - the - art classical reconciliation and error correction schemes @xcite allowed the _ in field _",
    "implementation cv - qkd over a distance of @xmath0 km @xcite .    in recent works",
    "@xcite we proposed a cv - mdi - qkd protocol , which we have also successfully tested in a proof - of - principle experiment @xcite .",
    "in particular , we proved that our scheme is capable of remarkably high key - rates per use of the communication channel , over the length of metropolitan range distances .",
    "this performance is orders of magnitude higher than comparably practical implementations based on discrete variable @xcite .",
    "we therefore believe that cv - qkd will play a crucial role in future implementation of metropolitan quantum cryptography . at this scale , in fact",
    ", both high density of untrusted nodes and high rates should be considered nonnegotiable properties , if we want a quantum network able of competing with present classical infrastructure .    in this work",
    "we provide additional evidences supporting the security analysis of cv - mdi - qkd given in refs .",
    "we show , by simple arguments , that the security analysis restricted to one - mode gaussian ( entangling - cloner ) attacks can only account for a subclass of all possible eavesdroppings .",
    "in particular we provide a counterexample in order to explicitly prove that , if we model eve s attack assuming a restricted strategy , based on independent entangling cloners , one can not generate all the possible covariance matrices shared between alice and bob .",
    "our analysis confirms that a complete security analysis of cv - mdi - qkd can not indeed avoid to consider two - mode gaussian attacks , as originally done in refs .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the structure of the paper is the following . in section  [ protocol - description ]",
    "we present the protocol .",
    "section  [ general - consideration ] gives general consideration about the security analysis , marking the difference between theoretical and experimental analyses .",
    "section  [ counter - example ]  provides a simple counter example to the ( wrong ) assumption that an attack by independent entangling cloners would be complete . finally , sec .",
    "[ conclusions ] is for our conclusions .",
    "we start with a brief description of the protocol  @xcite . at one side",
    ", alice prepares a mode @xmath1 in a coherent state @xmath2 whose amplitude @xmath3 is modulated by a gaussian distribution with zero mean and large variance . at the other side ,",
    "bob prepares his mode @xmath4 in another coherent state @xmath5 whose amplitude @xmath6 is modulated by the same gaussian distribution as alice .",
    "modes @xmath1 and @xmath4 are then sent to an intermediate relay where a cv bell detection is performed .",
    "the classical outcomes are combined in a complex variable @xmath7 , which is communicated to alice and bob via a public channel . as a result ,",
    "knowledge of @xmath7 enables each party to infer the variable of the other party by simple postprocessing ( see fig .",
    "[ pmscheme ] ) .        in general",
    ", the relay is assumed to be untrusted  @xcite , i.e. , operated by eve , and also the links with the relay are subject to eavesdropping .",
    "the protocol is assumed to be performed many times , so that the honest parties collect a large amount of classical data ( we consider asymptotic security here ) .",
    "using several tools , including de finetti arguments and the extremality of gaussian states ( see ref .",
    "@xcite  for more details ) , one can reduce the security analysis to considering a two - mode gaussian attack against the two links with the relay ( performing a proper cv bell detection ) . this type of attack can be constructed by suitably combining two canonical forms  @xcite into a correlated - noise gaussian environment .",
    "the most relevant canonical forms are clearly the lossy channels .    in this scenario , the two modes @xmath1 and @xmath4",
    "are mixed with two ancillary modes , @xmath8 and @xmath9 , by two beam splitters with transmissivities @xmath10 and @xmath11 , respectively .",
    "these ancillary modes belong to a reservoir of ancillas ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 plus an extra set @xmath12 ) in a pure gaussian state .",
    "the reduced state @xmath13 is a correlated thermal state with zero mean and covariance matrix ( cm ) in the normal form@xmath14{cc}% \\omega_{a}\\mathbf{i } & \\mathbf{g}\\\\ \\mathbf{g } & \\omega_{b}\\mathbf{i}% \\end{array } \\right )   , ~\\mathbf{g}:=\\left ( \\begin{array } [ c]{cc}% g & 0\\\\ 0 & g^{\\prime}% \\end{array } \\right )   , \\label{evecm_e1e2}%\\ ] ] where @xmath15 are the variances of the thermal noise affecting each link , while @xmath16 and @xmath17 are correlation parameters , satisfying suitable physical constraints  @xcite . after interaction ,",
    "eve s ancillas are stored in a quantum memory , measured at the end of the protocol ( see fig .  [ pmscheme2 ] ) .        in order to deal with the joint attack ,",
    "alice and bob must retrieve the joint statistics of the variables @xmath3 , @xmath6 , and @xmath7 . for this purpose",
    ", they publicly compare a small part of their data and reconstruct the probability distribution @xmath18 .",
    "the empirical values of the transmissivities @xmath10 and @xmath11 are accessible to the parties from the first - order moments of @xmath18 . knowing these values is essential in order to apply the correct post - processing and re - scaling of the output data . then , from the second - order moments of @xmath18 , alice and bob can extract the cm @xmath19 that they would share in an equivalent entanglement - based representation of the protocol  @xcite and conditioned to the outcome @xmath7  of the bell detection at the relay ( see ref .",
    "@xcite  for more details ) . from this shared post - relay cm",
    ", they can derive the secret - key rate of the protocol .",
    "it is important to note that , once the shared cm  @xmath19 is reconstructed by alice and bob , the secret - key rate can be ( numerically ) computed no matter what the actual eavesdropping strategy was .",
    "in fact , it is sufficient to consider the purification of the state @xmath20 into an environment which is assumed to be fully controlled by eve .",
    "this is a pretty standard method in cv - qkd .",
    "however , while this approach is valid for experimental demonstrations , it is generally not sufficient for deriving analytic expressions of the key rate @xmath21 , just because there are too many free parameters in the cm . having simple analytic expressions is crucial in order to theoretically compare the performances of different qkd protocols .",
    "the next theoretical step is therefore the reduction of the free parameters to a minimum set which is accessible to the parties and that allows us to write a closed formula for @xmath21 ( or a lower - bound to @xmath21 ) .",
    "it is typical to derive a single quantifier of the noise , the so - called ` excess noise ' @xmath22 , to be associated to the observed values of the transmissivities @xmath10 and @xmath11 .",
    "such a reduction is the non - trivial part of the theoretical analysis since it requires a minimization of the rate with respect to all degrees of freedom of eve , once that the triplet @xmath10 , @xmath11 , and @xmath22 has been fixed .",
    "one important pre - requisite for such a reduction is the correct modelling of the most general attack that eve can perform against the protocol .",
    "the entire space of the attacks  must be covered in this analysis . as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , cv - mdi - qkd requires the explicit consideration of all two - mode gaussian attacks , not just one - mode gaussian attacks , where @xmath23 .",
    "the latter class is in fact restricted and can only lead to partial security proofs .",
    "here we easily show that one - mode gaussian attacks represent a restricted class and , therefore , any security proof of cv - mdi - qkd based on these attacks can only be partial .",
    "furthermore , since they form a restricted class , it does not make sense to claim their optimality .    for the sake of simplicity",
    ", consider the symmetric configuration  @xcite , where alice s and bob s channels are identical lossy channels , with the same transmissivity @xmath24 .",
    "extension to asymmetric configurations is just a matter of technicalities . after the action of the relay ,",

    "( [ xpara ] ) .",
    "the fact that the parameters @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 get scrambled in @xmath29 and @xmath32 has led some authors  @xcite to claim that one - mode attacks ( @xmath23 ) with suitable values of the thermal noise ( @xmath30 and @xmath31 ) could simulate any two - mode attack with arbitrary @xmath30 , @xmath31 , @xmath16 , and @xmath17 .",
