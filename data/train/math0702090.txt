    "the robinson - schensted correspondence is perhaps the most important algorithm in algebraic combinatorics .",
    "it exhibits a bijection between permutations and pairs of standard young tableaux of the same shape .",
    "stanley investigated the class of differential posets  @xcite ( also studied in  @xcite ) and fomin studied the more general notion of a dual graded graph  @xcite to formalize local conditions which guarantee the existence of a robinson - schensted style algorithm .    in this article , we construct a family of dual graded graphs @xmath0 associated to each kac - moody algebra @xmath1 .",
    "these graded graphs have as vertex set the weyl group @xmath2 of @xmath1 .",
    "the pair @xmath3 depends on a pair @xmath4 where @xmath5 is a dominant integral weight and @xmath6 is a `` positive integral '' element of the center @xmath7 . in every case @xmath8",
    "is obtained by labeling the left weak order of @xmath2 and @xmath9 is obtained by labeling the strong bruhat order of @xmath2 .",
    "these labelings are motivated by the schubert calculus for homogeneous spaces associated to the kac - moody group @xmath10 with lie algebra @xmath1 . for @xmath11 ,",
    "let @xmath12 denote the cohomology schubert classes of the flag manifold of @xmath10 .",
    "if @xmath13 is the @xmath14-th fundamental weight , then an edge @xmath15 in @xmath16 is labeled with the coefficient of @xmath17 in the product @xmath18 , also called a chevalley coefficient .",
    "when @xmath1 is of affine type and @xmath19 is the canonical central element , the analogous statement holds ( proposition  [ p : homology ] ) for @xmath20 with the homology schubert classes @xmath21 of the affine grassmannian corresponding to @xmath1 replacing the cohomology classes .",
    "thus the combinatorics of these graphs encode computations in schubert calculus , and the duality of the graded graphs @xmath0 is a combinatorial skeleton of the duality between cohomology and homology of homogeneous spaces of @xmath10 .    in the case of the affine grassmannian ,",
    "the dual graded graph structure arises from the pair of dual graded hopf algebras given by @xmath22 and @xmath23 : one may define the down operator by the action of the homology class @xmath24 on the schubert basis of @xmath23 and the up operator by multiplication by @xmath25 for any fixed simple reflection @xmath26 .",
    "it is a general phenomenon that pairs of dual graded combinatorial hopf algebras yield dual graded graphs ; we shall pursue this in a separate publication @xcite .",
    "chains in the graded graphs @xmath0 , which we call strong and weak tableaux , are natural generalizations of standard young tableaux . to go one speculative step further ,",
    "we believe that the generating functions of an appropriate semistandard notion of strong and weak tableaux would give polynomials which _ represent _ certain homology and cohomology schubert classes , in particular for homogeneous spaces corresponding to maximal parabolics , generalizing schur functions , schur @xmath27-functions and the like . while this statement is vague in general , it can be made much more precise when @xmath1 is of affine type , and has already been achieved in one case .    in the case that @xmath1 is of the affine type @xmath28 our construction recovers the dual graded graphs that were implicitly studied in our joint work with lapointe and morse  @xcite .",
    "the weak and strong tableaux in  @xcite are semistandard generalizations of the corresponding objects here . in  @xcite , an affine insertion algorithm was explicitly constructed for semistandard weak and strong tableaux , and due to @xcite it is known that the corresponding generating functions do indeed represent schubert classes of the affine grassmannian of type @xmath29 . in the limit @xmath30 of the @xmath28 case , our construction reproduces young s lattice , which is the self - dual graded graph that gives rise to the robinson - schensted algorithm .",
    "having constructed the kac - moody dual graded graphs we study two further aspects of these graphs in detail .",
    "the first aspect is motivated by the relation between the robinson - schensted insertion and sagan - worley shifted insertion . using lusztig s construction @xcite which associates to each symmetrizable generalized cartan matrix @xmath29 , a symmetric generalized cartan matrix @xmath31 equipped with an admissible automorphism @xmath32 , we show that any dual graded graph of the form @xmath33 for @xmath34 can be realized in terms of one of the form @xmath35 for @xmath36 . in particular , for any affine algebra ,",
    "any of the dual graded graphs @xmath0 can be realized using a dual graded graph for a simply - laced affine algebra .",
    "in particular we obtain a schensted bijection for type @xmath37 , using the insertion algorithm of @xcite for type @xmath38 .",
    "as @xmath39 goes to infinity , the type @xmath37 insertion converges to sagan - worley insertion @xcite . as a related result ,",
    "we define a notion of mixed insertion for dual graded graphs equipped with a pair of automorphisms .",
    "this generalizes haiman s variants of schensted insertion known as left - right , mixed , and doubly - dual insertion @xcite .",
    "the second aspect we investigate are the induced subgraphs of the pair @xmath0 which are distributive lattices when considered as posets .",
    "these are precisely the conditions under which one may describe our strong and weak tableaux by  filling cells with numbers \" as in a usual standard young tableau . here",
    "we draw on work of proctor @xcite @xcite and stembridge @xcite , which classifies the parabolic quotients of weyl groups of simple lie algebras whose left weak orders ( or equivalently bruhat orders ) are distributive lattices .",
    "we sharpen these results slightly to show that in these cases , the distributivity is compatible with the edge labels of the graphs @xmath0 ; see section  [ sec : dist ] .",
    "these distributive parabolic quotients have also appeared recently in the geometric work of thomas and yong  @xcite .",
    "they show that in these cases one may use the _ jeu - de - taquin _ to calculate schubert structure constants of the cohomology of ( co)minuscule flag varieties .",
    "we do not recover this result , but we note that their notion of standard tableau , fits into our framework as strong ( or weak ) tableaux for the distributive parabolic quotients , with the edge labels forgotten .",
