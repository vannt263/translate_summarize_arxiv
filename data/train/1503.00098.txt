    "selecting symmetries and conserved quantities allows , in general , to reduce dynamics . as a consequence ,",
    "exact solutions for physical systems can be achieved . in particular , the so called _ noether symmetry approach _ is a method to solve exactly dynamics in many cosmological models @xcite . in other words ,",
    "the existence of a noether symmetry for the point - lagrangians coming from a given field theory , allows to find out first integrals for the equations of motion .",
    "it has been adopted for several classes of alternative theories of gravity @xcite leading to the full solution of dynamics @xcite .    besides the noether theorem , other approaches , based on symmetries , can be adopted in order to reduce dymanics and obtain exact solutions .",
    "for example , the hojman conservation theorem @xcite can provide a further method to find exact solutions . as shown in @xcite , the hojman approach does not require , a priori , the need for lagrangians and hamiltonian functions .",
    "the symmetry vectors and the corresponding conserved quantities can be obtained by using directly the equations of motion . specifically , unlike the noether approach , a point - lagrangian from which derive the equations of motion is not requested .",
    "the intersting fact is that these two approaches may give rise to different conserved quantities that , eventually , can coincide .",
    "for example , in the case of minimally coupled scalar - tensor gravity models , the noether symmetry exists only for exponential potential @xmath1 @xcite ; while the hojman symmetry exists for a wide range of potentials @xcite . in general , the hojman conserved quantities theorem can be different with respect to the noether ones .",
    "taking advantage of this fact and adopting conformal transformations , it is possible to study several classes of non - minimally coupled models as we will do in this paper . in summary , applying the hojman theorem to a minimally coupled models and finding out exact solutions , by conformal transformations , we obtain exact solutions for non - minimally coupled scalar - tensor models .",
