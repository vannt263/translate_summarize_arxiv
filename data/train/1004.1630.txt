    "in recent years , a considerable progress has been achieved in the field of quantum manipulation with nano - circuits based on the josephson effect  @xcite .",
    "this progress has been initially inspired by the ideas of quantum information processing  @xcite , which require the physical realization of qubits as an elementary quantum information unit .",
    "the degree of control achieved in josephson - based qubits is so high that these systems have become a test - bed for the ideas of quantum mechanics such as quantum noise detection  @xcite , quantum measurements  @xcite , and realization of circuit - quantum electrodynamics ( qed )  @xcite .",
    "very recently , the experimental realization of a single josephson - atom laser has been reported  @xcite .    in the experiment of ref .",
    ", a cooper pair box ( cpb ) is coupled to a superconducting waveguide resonator .",
    "the cpb is used as a three - level artificial atom .",
    "while the lowest two levels constitute a qubit , population inversion is achieved with the josephson quasiparticle ( jqp ) cycle  @xcite involving the third level .",
    "the lasing condition can be determined from the steady state photon number , pointing out that a too strong pumping suppresses the lasing action  @xcite .",
    "experimentally , evidence for lasing action was found through measurements of the output power spectrum of the resonator .",
    "an additional driving was applied on the cavity to induce phase locking , thereby enhancing the lasing effect .",
    "the results are consistent with theoretical work on a two - level atom coupled to a resonator  @xcite .",
    "studies concerning the coupling between a superconducting qutrit and a resonator have been also carried out  @xcite . however , currently no quantitative results are available for the dynamics of a three - level josephson atom coupled to a resonator .    in this paper we present a theoretical analysis of the lasing effect observed in the experiment  @xcite , using a quantum - mechanical approach .",
    "we first obtain the complete time evolution of the system , including transient effects upon switching on the pumping .",
    "we obtain estimates for the characteristic time scales of the corresponding dynamics .",
    "then , we study the output spectrum of the cavity field , with and without an additional driving applied to the cavity .",
    "we show that the latter requires a full quantum treatment and can not be obtained from a semiclassical approximation .",
    "our results are in good agreement with the experimental findings . the possibility to induce off - resonance lasing , observed in the experiment with a second hot spot ,",
    "is also considered by adding a two level fluctuator in the circuit . since",
    "our model is system - independent it can be applied to the study of other circuit - qed implementations , such as the currently much - studied transmon  @xcite .",

    "it is composed of the three - level artificial atom @xmath0 , with an energy difference @xmath1 between the ground state and the first excited state , and the cavity with a mode frequency @xmath2 .",
    "these two subsystems are coupled coherently according to the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian @xmath3 where @xmath4 , @xmath5 and @xmath6 ( @xmath7 ) is the canonical bosonic annihilation ( creation ) operator of a photon in the cavity .",
    "the dynamics of the third level @xmath8 is described with a lindbladian , as presented below .",
    "this hamiltonian is obtained after applying the rotating wave approximation ( rwa ) , valid when the coupling strength is small compared to the typical frequency of the isolated subsystems , which will be the case in the following .",
    "the legitimacy of the rwa is also established through numerical simulations .",

    "the reverse processes occur at the rates , respectively , @xmath14 and @xmath15 . finally , the cavity has a damping rate @xmath16 , conferring to the photons a lifetime @xmath17 . as a consequence , the time evolution of the total density matrix @xmath18 has two contributions : the evolution due to the coherent coupling between the artificial atom and the cavity according to hamiltonian   and the evolution due to the incoherent processes and controlled by the lindbladian @xmath19 with @xmath20 for the damping of the cavity .",
    "these expressions are obtained in the born - markov approximation , supposing a weak coupling between the system and the environment .",

    "we also include the possibility to drive the cavity with the additional pumping @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the detuning from the cavity frequency .",
    "the amplitude can be expressed in terms of the photon number @xmath26 created by the driving  @xcite @xmath27 .",

    "we express time in units of the inverse pumping rate @xmath50 .",
    "we see that the transient time , i.e. , the time needed to reach the steady state , is on the order of 4000 pumping cycles ( a microsecond for the experiment ) . at very short time",
    "scales , the three - level atom shows a significant population imbalance ; this accompanies a fast increase in the photon number in the cavity . in the steady state",
    "more than one hundred photons are present in the cavity , in agreement with the experimental estimates .",

    "the experimental spectrum in the @xmath53 plane shows an additional peak centered at @xmath54 .",
    "such a second peak is absent in our simulations , which is consistent with the fact that the coupling strength @xmath55 is below the threshold for two - photon masing .",
    "indeed , even when including the counter - rotating terms of the master equation that are neglected in the rwa and can lead to multi - photon processes , lasing effect occurs only at the resonance .",
    "moreover , if the observed peak were due to two - photon processes , it should have been located at @xmath56 .",
    "a possible source of additional resonances is the coupling to a two - level system ( tls ) .",
    "we will consider two kinds of coupling , first a resonant coupling with the lasing transition of the cpb and second a dispersive coupling with both the cpb and the cavity . to understand if it is possible to observe off - resonant lasing effect with a simple tls we focus on the steady state photon number .",
    "the josephson junction of the cpb can be a source of fluctuators , resulting from the tunneling of a charge between two sites in the insulating layer  @xcite .",
    "the tls is then composed of two states , ground state @xmath57 and excited state @xmath58 , separated by an energy @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is the energy difference between the two sites and @xmath61 is the tunneling strength .",

    "the tunneling charge position couples to the cooper pair number , with an energy @xmath66 , forming a four level system @xmath67 .",
    "this system is furthermore coupled to the single electron state @xmath8 with the incoherent pumping and to the cavity states through the jaynes - cummings hamiltonian  . while varying the gate voltage , different transitions of the four level system can become resonant with the cavity and induce lasing .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian turns out to comprise both a transverse and a longitudinal coupling , as well as frequency shifts , @xmath68 where @xmath69 , @xmath70 , @xmath71 , and @xmath72 .",
    "the energy spectrum of the four level system @xmath73 is given by @xmath74 and @xmath75 , where @xmath76 .",

    "a lasing effect thus occurs if the transition 2 - 0 , 3 - 1 , 1 - 0 , or 3 - 2 is in resonance with the cavity and the corresponding coupling strength is large enough .",

    "the cavity can then be indirectly excited when the transition @xmath84 approaches the resonance with the tls , @xmath92 . in this dispersive regime , we consider only the transverse coupling  @xcite , @xmath93(\\varsigma_++\\varsigma_- ) ,     \\label{htls }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath94 is the transverse coupling strength between the tls and the josephson atom / cavity .",

    "the effect of the tls on the photon number is small even for strong couplings ( see fig .",

    "it consists of factorizing the operators pertaining to the three - level atom and to the cavity .",

    "off - resonance at @xmath101 , where the semi - classical spectrum exhibits the second peak , the difference oscillates at @xmath117 , giving rise to a non - negligible contribution in the fourier transform .",
    "these comparisons reveal that the semi - classical treatment is not correct in the region close to the resonance where the correlations between the atom and the cavity can not be neglected .",
    "the resulting double peak structure thus appears to be an artifact of the factorization  @xcite .",
