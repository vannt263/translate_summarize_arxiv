    "the intriguing physical properties and the potential technological applications of @xmath18mno@xmath4 pseudocubic manganites ( where @xmath19 is a rare - earth metal : la , pr , nd , dy ; and @xmath20 is an alkaline earth : sr , ca , ba , pb ) have led to a resurgence of interest in these and related materials . in particular , the phase diagram of these compounds is complex , and many variables such as pressure , applied magnetic field , doping concentration _ x _ , and @xmath20-site average ionic radius can determine a wide range of ground states in the system  @xcite .",
    "in many of these systems a metal - insulator transition ( mi ) and colossal magnetoresistance occur near the curie temperature t@xmath21 , when the system undergoes a paramagnetic ( pm ) to ferromagnetic ( fm ) transition . to explain the pm to fm phase transition and the changes in transport mechanisms",
    ", zener proposed the so - called `` double exchange ( de ) '' model  @xcite . in the framework of the de model ,",
    "two carriers hop simultaneously , one from a mn@xmath22 ion to an adjacent o@xmath23 site and the other from the o@xmath23 to a neighboring mn@xmath7 .",
    "however , numerous experimental results suggest that other considerations influence the phase transitions , among them the electron - phonon interaction arising from jahn - teller ( jt ) distortions  @xcite , the orbital degree of freedom  @xcite , the electron - electron correlations and the coupling between spin and orbital structure  @xcite .",
    "the jt lattice distortion in particular is thought to be larger in the pm phase ( above t@xmath21 ) , but to decrease  @xcite significantly after the transition to the fm phase .",
    "thus , the mno@xmath17 octahedra are highly distorted for t@xmath24t@xmath21 but the magnitude of this distortion decreases as t approaches t@xmath21 .",
    "the idea is that a mi transition can occur more easily if the octahedra are undistorted and the mn",
    "mn angles tends to 180@xmath25  @xcite ; this effect can also be obtained by changing the average dimension of the atom at the @xmath20 and/or @xmath26 site .",
    "studies of @xmath18mno@xmath4 with @xmath27 close to 30% have shown the existence of a relationship between t@xmath21 and the distortion of the perovskite structure as measured by the tolerance factor , _ t _ , or the mean size of cations at the a site @xmath28  @xcite . more precisely , it has been shown that in perovskite series with a fixed @xmath29 value , the t@xmath21 depends on the disorder at the @xmath20 site  @xcite ; this disorder is quantified in terms of the variance of the @xmath20 cationic radii distribution , @xmath30 .",
    "there is substantially less information in literature regarding the substitution in the b cationic sublattice .",
    "some attention has been paid to the substitutions on the charge ordered ground state ( i.e. , 50% mn@xmath7 )  @xcite , but there are few results concerning mn - substitution having the optimum content of mn@xmath7 ( ca .",
    "there is not yet enough data to correlate the dependence of t@xmath21 with any structural variable involving @xmath26-site substitution  @xcite .",
    "the size of the substitutional defects is a key factor influencing transition temperatures  @xcite ; the structural disorder produces a strong local stress in mno@xmath17 octahedra ( resulting in a rotation ) , modifying the mn ",
    "mn angles and thus changing lattice and electronic properties .",
    "thus both vibrational and electronic properties of mixed valence manganites with defect in the @xmath26 cation sublattice are influenced by structural disorder introduced by local internal pressure associated to the substitutional defects . in this paper",
    "we present a raman scattering investigation on the manganese perovskites la@xmath0sr@xmath31mn@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 as a function of @xmath26-site cu doping .",
    "the copper - free end member of the series , la@xmath32sr@xmath33mno@xmath4 ( lsmo ) , has been extensively studied with a great variety of techniques ; for spectroscopic spectra , see for example optical conductivity measurements  @xcite , and raman scattering  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , reflectivity , raman and/or ellipsometric studies have not been yet performed on la@xmath0sr@xmath31mn@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 . in this paper",
    "we report a raman study of a series containing a fixed ratio mn@xmath7/(mn@xmath7+mn@xmath22 ) = 0.3 .",
    "substitution in specific sites in the lattice affects the vibrational modes through changes to the mass , the bonding strength and the bonding configuration , so that raman spectroscopy and infrared ( reflectance and ellipsometry techniques ) are ideal tools for studying the role of @xmath26-site substitution in manganites .",
    "moreover , raman spectroscopy is a useful probe for those materials in which lattice , as well as electron dynamics , strongly interacts by means of electron - phonon interaction . with this in mind",
    "we have measured raman spectra of polycrystalline la@xmath0sr@xmath31mn@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 samples , searching for effects due to the changes in both electron - phonon coupling and free carrier screening in the metallic phase . as an ease to interpretation the values of @xmath34",
    "are selected to keep constant the ratio mn@xmath7/(mn@xmath7+mn@xmath22 ) = 0.3 through the series .",
    "details on the preparation of the studied samples , together with x - ray diffraction and magnetization measurements are described elsewhere  @xcite , while values of @xmath34 and cu content , t@xmath21 temperature , tolerance factor , and rhombohedral angle are given in table i. raman spectra were collected at room temperature with back - scattering geometry of the incident laser light from surfaces polished down to 1 @xmath35 m with diamond paste .",
    "the samples were excited with the 514.5 nm line of a ar ion laser and the scattered light analyzed using a triple monochromator system ( dilor xy800 ) with a ln@xmath36 cooled charge - coupled device ( ccd ) detector .",
    "the power was kept below 15 mw focused in a spot diameter of 0.1 mm@xmath37 , in order to avoid heating the samples .",
    "spectra were collected with parallel ( @xmath10 ) and crossed ( @xmath11 ) polarizations of the incident ( _ @xmath12 _ ) and scattered ( _ @xmath13 _ ) light . in figs . 1 and 2 , respectively , the raman spectra collected in the parallel - polarized and cross - polarized configurations are shown .",
    "as in the case of previously published spectra for la@xmath32sr@xmath33mno@xmath4  @xcite , and many related materials  @xcite , the most striking features are two anomalously broad lines centered near 500 and 670 @xmath9 .",
    "in addition to these very broad structures , there are narrower lines at 190 - 220 and 430 @xmath9 .",
    "it should be noticed that the shoulder at around 600 @xmath9 disappears for @xmath38 . in the cross polarized configuration , the first peak at about 200 @xmath9 completely disappears .",
    "the raman spectra showed in fig .",
    "1 were fitted in the 130 - 900 @xmath9 region frequency with the following expression for the raman intensity  @xcite : @xmath39 where the first term represents the electronic contribution to the spectrum , consisting of `` collision - dominated '' low - frequency response associated with diffusive hopping of the carriers .",
    "the second term represents the `` odd lorentzian '' shape of a phonon mode ( @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 are the peak frequency , linewidth , and amplitude , respectively ) .",
    "the error on the frequency resulting from the fit analysis is always smaller than the resolution of the spectrometer ( 1.5 @xmath9 when the aperture of the slit is 200 @xmath35 m ) .",
    "therefore , we assume that the error is 1.5 @xmath9 for all the frequencies",
    ". we found four peaks at 180 - 215 , 430 , 530 , and 670 @xmath9 .",
    "note that a high frequency oscillator ( near 1100 @xmath9 ) is necessary to achieve a good fit .",
    "it should be pointed out that this high frequency contribution ( hfc ) is also found in raman experiments on la@xmath43ca@xmath44mno@xmath4  @xcite , and it has been suggested that the hfc should be associated with the photoionization of small polarons .",
    "but we argue that this is a very clear evidence that the feature up there is second order phonon scattering .",
    "in fact , the hfc structure is also present in sr doped manganites , and all other pseudocubic and double layer manganites  @xcite and we believe that such features are weak second - order raman scattering effects ( density of state ) , mirroring the bands seen in the region 400 - 800 @xmath9 .",
    "the frequencies of the experimental peaks are plotted in fig .",
    "3 , wherein it is evident that the narrow lower peak shows a substantial shift as function of cu concentration .",
    "our samples exhibit rhombohedral crystal structure  @xcite , space group @xmath45 . according to site group analysis ,",
    "30 vibrational modes are predicted : @xmath46 where the @xmath47 modes are raman active , the @xmath48 are infrared active , and the @xmath49 are silent modes . following the procedure described in ref .",
    "@xcite , the la ( or sr ) ions participate in four phonon modes ( @xmath50 ) , the mn ( or cu ) ions take part in four phonon modes ( @xmath51 ) , while the oxygen ions contribute in twelve modes ( @xmath52 . as a consequence , it is found that the @xmath53 modes only involve the motion of the oxygen ions in the @xmath54 sites , while the @xmath55 arise both from oxygen site and la ( sr ) site vibrations .",
    "following granado _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , we assign the lowest frequency peak at 190 - 220 @xmath9 ( m1 ) to an @xmath53 mode , and the peak at 430 @xmath9 ( m2 ) to a @xmath55 symmetry .",
    "the assignment of the m1 peak to an @xmath53 mode is confirmed by the fact that this mode is absent in cross polarized configuration , as it is expected under these conditions ( we remind the selection rules for this mode : @xmath56 , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) . concerning the peaks at 530 @xmath9 ( m3 ) and 670 @xmath9 ( m4 ) , granado _ et al .",
    "_ suggest that the m3 and m4 peaks should be due to scattering induced by orthorhombic distortions which may be present on the surface . on the other hand",
    "these modes are very broad in all manganites , which is an evidence that they are full - band modes , rendered raman active by disordered jahn - teller distortions  @xcite .",
    "the m1 mode corresponds to a rotation of the octahedra around the hexagonal _ c - axis _",
    "@xcite , which is closely related with the @xmath57 mode in the orthorhombic ( _ pnma _ ) structure  @xcite ( an _ in - phase rotation _ of the mno@xmath17 octahedra around the _ b - axis)_. concerning the frequency shift of the @xmath53 mode , this does not simply involve the motion of the la ( sr ) ions : in fact , in such a case the frequency should decrease as the heavier la ions are substituted for sr ( see the values for _ y _ in table i ) : actually , what is seen is exactly the opposite behavior .",
    "it is worth noting that , according with the site group analysis previously discussed , the @xmath53 mode involves only the motion of the oxygen ions in the @xmath54 sites .",
    "therefore it is reasonable to relate the changes on the @xmath53 mode frequency to the modifications of the oxygen octahedra .",
    "moreover , the introduction of substitutional defect in the @xmath26-site ( like cu ) has a strong effect in the structural changes of the lattice .",
    "since cu substitution induces a strong local stress , it can be expected that mno@xmath17 octahedra rotate , and the mn - o bond lengths decrease under this compression .",
    "also the sr substitution may introduce structural disorder , but it should be noticed that , since the sr and la ions have similar radii , the strength of the distortion induced by those ions is less important . in conclusion ,",
    "we believe that the observed frequency shift with doping is determined by the distortions introduced by the large substitutional cu ions , involving the motion of the oxygen cages and an effective rotation of the octahedra . in order to be more quantitatively ,",
    "let us discuss the tolerance factor ( _ t _ ) , which is defined as : @xmath58 where _ d _ denotes the interatomic distance simply calculated as the sum of ionic medium radii ; @xmath28 is the average ionic radius of @xmath20-site ions ( la@xmath22 and sr@xmath22 ) and @xmath59 is the average radius of the @xmath26-site ions ( mn and cu ) .",
    "the tolerance factors is @xmath60 for spherical ions packed in the ideal perovskite structure ( mn  o  mn angle equal to 180@xmath25 , and no - tilt of the octahedra ) and becomes smaller as @xmath61 is increased by cu substitution and the lattice becomes more distorted ; this means that the mn  o ",
    "mn angle deviates from 180@xmath25 , which leads to a reduction of the de mechanism .",
    "the correlation between the frequency shift of the a@xmath14 mode and the tolerance factor ( calculated using the shannon radii @xcite ) is shown in fig .",
    "4 . within the errors",
    ", it can be concluded that the scaling of the a@xmath14 mode with the tolerance factor is linear .",
    "it is important to notice that the changes in the tolerance factor have been induced by both a- and b - site substitution ; in literature , there is substantial previous raman data on the manganites as a function of a - site substitution : an interesting work by amelitchev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite showed that the band shift of the a@xmath14 mode is a linear function of the tolerance factor for a fixed value of _ x _ ( like 0.3 or 0.45 ) . in their work ,",
    "the tolerance factor is changed by introducing different cations ( la , nd , sr , ca , pr , sm , eu , gd ) in the a sublattice of the perovskite structure . in order to compare the effect of a - site and both a- and b - site substitutions , we have added in fig.4 their results for r@xmath32a@xmath33mno@xmath4 ( r = la@xmath2pr@xmath3 , a = ca , sr , sr@xmath62ca@xmath62 ) , r@xmath63sr@xmath64mno@xmath4 ( r = nd@xmath62sm@xmath62 , sm , eu , gd ) , and r@xmath65sr@xmath66mno@xmath4 ( r = nd , nd@xmath62sm@xmath62 , sm , eu , gd ) .",
    "the solid lines are a linear fitting of r@xmath32a@xmath33mno@xmath4 ( @xmath67 = 2975 - 2995@xmath68 t ) and r@xmath65sr@xmath66mno@xmath4 ( @xmath67 = 3088 - 3092@xmath68 t ) @xcite .",
    "our data are in good agreement with the r@xmath32a@xmath33mno@xmath4 series ; in our case , @xmath67 = 2853 - 2864@xmath68 t , and linear extrapolations to higher t suggest that the mode should soften to zero at t = 0.996 ( t = 0.993 and t = 1.001 for r@xmath32a@xmath33mno@xmath4 and r@xmath65a@xmath66mno@xmath4 ) . in facts ,",
    "the linear scaling of the a@xmath14 mode with tolerance factor is independent of the means by which the tolerance factor is changed , as long as the mn@xmath22/mn@xmath7 ratio is kept at a fixed value .",
    "moreover , it is worth noting that the frequency of the @xmath53 mode can also be correlated with the rhombohedral angle @xmath16 , whose deviation from 60@xmath25 defines a measure of the rhombohedral distortion with respect to the ideal cubic structure .",
    "the values for @xmath16 have been obtained from x - ray diffraction data , and are reported in table i. the linear relationship between the frequency shift of the @xmath53 mode and @xmath16 is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "it can be concluded that the band shift is a linear function of the tolerance factor and the rhombohedral angle @xmath16 , that is , the @xmath53 mode follows the structural changes of the oxygen cages .",
    "our experimental studies of the raman spectra of la@xmath0sr@xmath31mn@xmath2cu@xmath3o@xmath4 reveal that two strong peaks appear at 190 - 220 and 430 @xmath9 , together with two broad structures centered at near 500 and 670 @xmath9 .",
    "it is found that the lowest peak ( assigned as an @xmath53 mode ) shifts linearly , with the increase of cu concentration , toward higher frequencies as _ x _ increase . within an analysis in terms of tolerance factor and of rhombohedral angle ( @xmath16 ) of the @xmath45 structure",
    ", it is proved that the shift is determined by the structural disorder introduced by substitutional cu ions in the @xmath26-site , e.g. , the shift follows the changes of the mno@xmath17 octahedra in the system .",
    "finally , it should be pointed out that the structural distortions can be influenced by the size of the b - site ion . according to the shannon radii ( r@xmath69 ) , the cu ionic radius ( r@xmath70 = 0.730 ) is relatively large compared to the mn radius ( r@xmath71 = 0.645 , r@xmath72 = 0.530 ) ; in contrast , ions such cr@xmath22 , co@xmath22 , ga@xmath22 ( r@xmath73 = 0.615 , @xmath74 = 0.610 , @xmath75 = 0.620 ) are similar to the mn mean ionic radius ( @xmath76 = 0.611 , calculated for a mean oxidation state of 3 ) .",
    "therefore , raman measurements on ( la , sr)mno@xmath4 systems with smaller b - site substitutional defect ( such as cr@xmath22 , co@xmath22 , ga@xmath22 ) are highly desirable : according to our interpretation , in this case the phonon frequency shift should be less pronounced .",
