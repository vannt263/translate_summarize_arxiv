    "the rich transport behavior in complex systems is an important research topic in statistical physics @xcite .",
    "consider the mean square of a physical quantity ( such as position ) as a function of time @xmath0 for an ensemble of particles .",
    "for normal diffusion , this mean quantity is proportional to @xmath0 ; whereas for anomalous diffusion , the mean quantity goes like @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) , with subdiffusion referring to cases of @xmath3 and superdiffusion referring to cases of @xmath4 . in the classical domain , known examples of anomalous diffusion include brownian motion and heat conduction . in the quantum domain ,",
    "wavepacket spreading in a periodic potential leads to ballistic transport in the mean square position ( @xmath5 ) .",
    "by contrast , wavepacket spreading in a quasi - periodic potential often induces subdiffusion or superdiffusion @xcite .",
    "the special class of diffusion with @xmath6 , which may be termed as `` superballistic transport '' , is however not as well - studied as other cases of anomalous transport behavior . in the classical domain ,",
    "superballistic transport was observed for brownian particles  @xcite . in the quantum case ,",
    "a time - dependent random potential was demonstrated to cause superballistic transport using paraxial optical setting  @xcite .",
    "more related to this work , earlier superballistic transport was found in the dynamics of wavepacket spreading in a tight - binding lattice junction  @xcite .",
    "remarkably , such type of quantum superballistic transport was recently experimentally realized by use of optical wave packets in a designed hybrid photonic lattice setup  @xcite .",
    "the main objective of this work is to use a relatively simple model system to better understand the difference and connection between quantum and classical superballistic transport in purely hamiltonian systems . to our knowledge",
    ", the model studied in this work represents the only dynamical model that can possess superballistic transport in both quantum and classical hamiltonian dynamics .",
    "this will shed more light on various mechanisms of superballistic transport as well as on the general issue of quantum dynamics in classically chaotic systems .",
    "further studies regarding the subtle correspondence between quantum and classical superballistic transport can be also motivated .",
    "specifically , we consider a relativistic variant  @xcite of the well - known kicked - rotor ( kr ) model  @xcite and reveal the quantum and classical superballistic transport dynamics in the momentum space .",
    "such a system can be also regarded as a periodically driven dirac system , and it should be of some experimental interest due to recent advances in the quantum simulation of dirac - like particles . in the massless case",
    "in which the kinetic energy of a relativistic particle is a linear function of momentum , the relativistic kr variant was known as the `` maryland model '' , first investigated by grempel _ et .",
    "@xcite , berry  @xcite and simon  @xcite to analytically understand the issue of anderson localization . for a dirac particle with a nonzero mass",
    ", the bare dispersion relation now lies between linear and quadratic : for low momentum values the dispersion is almost quadratic and for very high momentum values the dispersion approaches a linear function . in effect",
    ", this realizes a situation , now in the momentum space , in which two ( momentum ) sublattices with different dispersion relations ( and hence different nature of on - site potential ) are connected as a junction  @xcite . as shown later , this indeed induces superballistic transport in both the classical and quantum dynamics .",
    "interestingly , the detailed mechanism in the former is still markedly different from that in the latter . in particular , in the classical case , it is necessary to break the global kam curves in the classical phase space because the superballistic transport roots in an unusually complicated escape from a phase space regime of random motion to a simple ballistic structure .",
    "by contrast , in the quantum case , breaking global kam curves are not essential for quantum superballistic transport to occur thanks to quantum tunneling through the kam curves .",
    "this paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , we introduce our model and discuss its relation with the well - known maryland model . in sec .",
    "iii we study quantum superballistic dynamics , followed by a parallel study of classical superballistic transport and the associated classical phase space structure in sec .",

    "consider a one - dimensional relativistic quantum kr @xcite : @xmath7 where all the variables are scaled and hence in dimensionless units . here",
    "@xmath8 and @xmath9 are pauli matrices , @xmath10 represents the speed of light , @xmath11 represents the static mass energy , @xmath12 represents the strength of a delta - kicking field that is @xmath13-periodic in the coordinate @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is an integer ) and unity - periodic in time , @xmath16 , where @xmath17 is a dimensionless effective planck constant .    in the case of a vanishing @xmath11",
    ", the hamiltonian   can be decoupled into two independent hamiltonians , each associated with one eigen - spinor of @xmath8 .",
    "they are nothing but the so - called maryland model  @xcite : @xmath18 early studies on this massless relativistic kr  @xcite investigated the consequences of rational or irrational values of @xmath19 .",
    "indeed , by mapping the maryland model onto a one - dimensional anderson model , it becomes clear that @xmath20 with an irrational @xmath19 should display anderson localization in the momentum space  @xcite , whereas @xmath20 with a rational @xmath21 ( @xmath22 and @xmath23 integers ) should show ballistic transport , so long as the parameter @xmath15 in the kicking potential is an integer multiple of @xmath23  @xcite .",
    "this condition is called a resonance condition .",
    "when this resonance condition is not fulfilled , i.e. , @xmath24 , it can be shown that the time - evolving wavefunction of the system ( with rational @xmath19 ) repeats itself after every @xmath23 kicking periods , so neither anderson localization nor ballistic transport occurs .",
    "roughly speaking , what is known in the standard quantum kr @xcite applies also here , concerning the importance of the arithmetic nature of @xmath19 for the dynamics of the maryland model , as well as the ballistic transport due to quantum resonances therein .",
    "though in this work we will focus on cases with a nonzero @xmath11 , the above - mentioned results for the maryland model do guide us when it comes to choose interesting parameter regimes . for example , we shall pay special attention to whether or not @xmath19 is a rational value , and if the kicking potential is resonant or not .",
    "as it turns out , the quantum dynamics is most interesting in cases with rational @xmath19 and under the resonance condition .",
    "since our model is a periodically driven system , we write down its floquet operator in the @xmath14-representation , i.e. , the propagator associated with one - period time evolution : @xmath25 without loss of generality we set @xmath26 throughout , keeping in mind that if @xmath27 , we may just absorb it into other parameters @xmath11 and @xmath12 . due to this choice",
    ", with periodic boundary conditions in @xmath14 , momentum can only take integer values .",
    "the above expression of the floquet operator is a product of two exponentials .",
    "the second factor @xmath28 $ ] comes from the kicking field , giving rise to the hopping between different momentum states ( different sites in the momentum space ) , whereas the first factor @xmath29 $ ] is responsible for generating momentum - dependent on - site phases .",
    "in particular , the state at a site @xmath30 can be decomposed into local spin - up and spin - down components , each component acquiring a phase factor @xmath31 : @xmath32.\\ ] ]    clearly then , it is the periodic and alternative on - site phase accumulation @xmath31 and the hopping @xmath33 $ ] that determine the quantum dynamics .",
    "this motivates us to also consider a slightly different floquet operator @xmath34 : @xmath35 for this spinless floquet operator , the two spin components are decoupled .",
    "nevertheless , it still contains the same local phase accumulation given by @xmath31 and the same hopping term as in our original model described by @xmath36 .",
    "as seen later , it does possess the essential properties of @xmath36 and as such our physical analysis can be reduced .",
    "more importantly , the system @xmath34 does not have the spin degree of freedom , so its classical limit can be constructed with ease , with the classical hamiltonian given by @xmath37 indeed , the so - called classical relativistic kr map studied in the literature  @xcite was based on such a spinless classical hamiltonian . in the following , we study the quantum dynamics using both @xmath36 and @xmath34 , and the classical dynamics based on @xmath38 .",
    "the dynamics of a quantum relativistic kr was previously studied in ref .",
    "@xcite for relatively short time scales . by extending to a longer time scale and choosing the right parameter regime ,",
    "quantum superballistic transport is found for driven systems described by @xmath36 as well as its spinless version @xmath34 . to justify our choices of the system parameters we first examine cases with an irrational value of @xmath19 .      in the maryland model",
    ", an irrational @xmath19 leads to localization in the momentum space .",
    "so it is interesting to first investigate how a nonzero mass @xmath11 changes this picture .",
    "when @xmath19 is irrational , the previously defined phase factor @xmath31 in eq .",
    "is in general a pseudo - random function of the momentum site .",
    "this is different from the maryland model , in which @xmath39 and the corresponding @xmath31 would then reduce to a quasi - periodic function of momentum sites . in the light of the mapping from a kr system to the anderson localization model @xcite , this seems to indicate that a non - zero @xmath11 favors dynamical localization in the momentum space .",
    "note also that , for very large values of @xmath30 , the relative importance of the @xmath11 term in @xmath31 will diminish , and then effectively a maryland model will be recovered and dynamical localization is still guaranteed  @xcite .",
    "thus , in the entire momentum space , a non - zero @xmath11 is expected to strengthen the dynamical localization , thus also wiping out any possibility of anomalous diffusion or superballistic transport .",
    "results of our numerical simulations presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_irra ] support our above view .",
    "for both the full floquet operator @xmath36 and its spinless version @xmath34 , it is seen from fig .  [ fig : m_irra ] that the momentum spread @xmath40 decreases as @xmath11 increases , i.e. , a larger @xmath11 enhances dynamical localization .     as a function of number of kicks ( time @xmath0 ) .",

    "( results of @xmath36 and @xmath34 with @xmath39 are identical . )",
    "@xmath40 is seen to be strongly localized in all the examined examples .",
    "here and in all other figures , all plotted quantities are in dimensionless units . ]    with the same set of system parameters , the mean momentum spread under the evolution of the floquet operator @xmath36 is similar to that under the evolution of its spinless version @xmath34 .",
    "this confirms that the common on - site phase accumulation function @xmath31 has captured the main features of dynamical localization .",
    "it is also interesting to comment on the differences between these two cases .",
    "that is , @xmath40 associated with @xmath36 is always larger than that associated with @xmath34 .",
    "as such , the spin degree of freedom is seen to slightly weaken dynamical localization .",
    "this is somewhat expected .",
    "indeed , the spin degree of freedom introduces two channels for the dynamics and a multi - channel anderson model does increase the localization length  @xcite .",
    "we note in passing that the spin degree of freedom can even cause anderson transition in two - dimensional disordered systems  @xcite . certainly , as @xmath11 increases , this spin effect should decrease because it becomes more costly in energy for the two spin channels to interact .    finally , we mention the benchmark result in fig .  [",
    "fig : m_irra ] for the @xmath39 case that represents the maryland model .",
    "the perfect revival of @xmath40 was predicted by berry  @xcite . using our system parameters depicted in the caption of fig .",
    "[ fig : m_irra ] , berry s result gives @xmath46 and our simulation agrees with this .",
    "as we already discussed in the previous subsection , for large momentum values , the effect of a nonzero mass term @xmath11 will diminish and effectively the maryland model will re - emerge .",
    "so if we were not to choose an on - resonance potential , then in regimes of large momentum quantum revivals should occur for rational @xmath19 , which is not of interest here .",
    "in addition , we also observed that for an off - resonance kicking potential and for rational @xmath19 , a non - zero @xmath11 further suppresses the already bounded momentum spread . with these understandings ,",
    "it is clear that we should step into the interesting situation where @xmath21 is rational and the kicking potential @xmath47 is on resonance , i.e , @xmath48 . for convenience",
    "we choose @xmath49 .",
    "reference  @xcite computationally investigated exactly the same situation , but it was argued therein that the phase factor @xmath31 as a pseudo - random function of momentum should suffice to localize the momentum spread . as we show below , both qualitatively and quantitatively , this claim is correct only for low momentum values , and overall a much richer transport behavior can be found .",
    "let us start with the maryland model for which @xmath39 .",
    "then the momentum space is translational invariant with period @xmath23 . as such , states will in general spread ballistically (",
    "the off - resonance case is an exception ) . in our case ,",
    "@xmath50 and within each period , the on - site phase @xmath31 acquired by the system becomes a quasi - random function of @xmath30 , thus dynamical anderson localization or suppression of momentum spread is expected .",
    "however , as momentum increases , the nonzero @xmath51 term in @xmath52\\right)$ ] becomes less important as compared with @xmath53 .",
    "for very large momentum , the @xmath51 term represents a very weak perturbation and hence the dynamics should resemble that of the maryland model .",
    "the above qualitative analysis makes it clear that the overall dynamics depends on many factors . on a sublattice representing low momentum values from @xmath54 to @xmath55 ,",
    "dynamical localization takes place and the system is effectively in a disordered regime . on a sublattice representing higher momentum values ,",
    "ballistic transport is expected and the system is effectively in a periodic regime . whether or not a state is localized or delocalized now depends on where it is initially located , and on the size of the disordered regime as compared with the localization length .",
    "for example , if an initial state is localized at the center of the disordered regime and if the localization length is much shorter than the disordered region , then the system may be trapped there for an extremely long time . on the other hand ,",
    "if the initial state is already located close to the high - momentum sublattice ( closeness is with respect to the localization length ) , then as the kicking field induces population transfer between the disordered sublattice and the periodic sublattice , the system will be quickly delocalized . in this sense ,",
    "our model , through its natural dispersion relation , realizes a lattice junction analogous to that considered in refs .",
    "certainly , in our model here there is no sharp transition between the two qualitatively different sublattices , but the critical momentum value is expected to scale with @xmath56 .",

    "representative results from our numerical experiments are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_ra_log ] .",
    "there it is seen that as @xmath11 increases , an initial state localized at the center of the disordered sublattice will be trapped for a longer period .",
    "this is consistent with our understanding that an increasing @xmath11 leads to a longer disordered sublattice as well as a shorter localization length .",
    "other numerical results ( not shown ) show that the values of @xmath19 , the kicking strength @xmath12 , and the potential parameter @xmath15 can all affect the duration during which an initial state is trapped in the disordered regime .",
    "two of the computational examples shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_ra_log ] also display quantum superballistic transport , i.e. @xmath63 with @xmath6 , where @xmath0 is the number of kicks .",
    "this can now be explained using the idea from ref .",
    "in particular , assuming that the length of the disordered momentum sublattice is larger than the corresponding localization length , then the disordered regime serves as a source to provide slow probability leakage into a periodic regime at an almost constant rate .",
    "then we have @xmath66 here @xmath67 is the probability leaking rate from the disordered sublattice to the periodic sublattice , @xmath68 represents the contribution from the disordered regime , which is almost constant and can be neglected .",
    "@xmath69 represents the probability of the initial state already placed in the periodic regime , which is 0 due to our choice of the initial state located at the center of the disordered regime .",
    "@xmath70 characterizes the ballistic transport coefficient , which depends on many system parameters .",
    "if we approximate @xmath67 by a constant @xmath71 , then from eq .",
    "we approximately have @xmath72    as reflected by the two cases shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_ra_log ] , namely , the case of @xmath60 for the full floquet operator @xmath36 and the case of @xmath59 for the spinless floquet operator @xmath34 defined in eq .",

    "these two superballistic exponents are very close to @xmath65 , in agreement with the above theory .",
    "for the same two cases , we have set @xmath75 and record the probabilities inside @xmath76 $ ] as a function of time .",
    "this probability indeed decreases linearly with time .",
    "this further confirms the physical mechanism behind the quantum superballistic transport seen here .",
    "the case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_ra_log ] with @xmath57 displays ballistic transport as the case of @xmath39 .",
    "this is so because for a small value of @xmath11 the initial state quickly experiences ballistic transport on the clean sublattice . for the intermediate case @xmath58",
    ", the momentum spread does not show any clear power - law dependence . in this transitional case ,",
    "the localization length and the size of disordered lattice are comparable and hence the leakage from the disordered sublattice to the periodic sublattice occurs no longer at an almost constant rate .",
    "we stress that the shown cases represent but a few examples .",
    "many similar results of quantum superballistic transport are obtained for both the full floquet operator @xmath36 involving two spin channels and for the spinless floquet operator @xmath34 .    though the quantum superballistic transport here is explained in the same manner as in ref .",
    "@xcite , we stress that the effective two - sublattice configuration is not artificially designed . rather , it emerges as a natural consequence of the relativistic dispersion relation with a nonzero mass .",
    "in this subsection we will study the classical relativistic kr described by the hamiltonian in eq .  .",
    "to that end , it is necessary to examine the phase space structure , which can be generated from the relativistic standard map  @xcite . in particular , the states right after the @xmath77-th and @xmath78-st kick are connected by the map @xmath79    in the quantum case , either an irrational @xmath19 or a non - resonant kicking potential causes localization . considering quantum - classical correspondence ,",

    "however , as expected , after the same number of iterations , regimes with low momentum values can generate a complete phase invariant curve faster , and regimes with high momentum values may still have holes to be filled in . as to panel ( c ) where the product of @xmath89 is close to an integer ,",

    "in fact , sometimes @xmath108 can be even larger than three or even four .",
    "some examples are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10 ] . in one case ,",
    "the superballistic transport exponent is found to be as large as @xmath109 , for a time window from @xmath110 to @xmath111 . on the one hand",
    "this confirms that the classical dynamics may display superballistic transport , on the other hand it is necessary to better understand the underlying mechanism . by exploring many parameter choices",
    ", it is found that breaking the global kam curves with an increasing ratio @xmath112 is a necessary condition .",
    "this is already a clear difference from quantum superballistic transport .",
    "for example , for the results shown in fig .  2 , @xmath113 , @xmath45 , @xmath59 , quantum superballistic transport occurs already for @xmath44 , but in the classical case shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10 ] , superballistic transport is observed only when @xmath12 exceeds 1.4 .",
    "thus , in the quantum case , a global kam invariant curve does not forbid the population leakage from the classically chaotic regime to the ballistic regime , an indication of quantum tunneling .",
    "vs time ( the number of kicks ) .",
    "the initial conditions are sampled from a gaussian distribution described by eq .   with @xmath114 and @xmath115 , so that the initial phase space distribution is analogous to the quantum initial state used in fig .",
    "[ fig : m_ra_log ] .",
    "here @xmath113 , @xmath45 , @xmath59 , and from top to bottom , @xmath116 , and @xmath117 .",
    "note that with other system parameters being the same , quantum superballistic transport already occurs for @xmath44 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : m_ra_log ] ) . here",
    "the classical superballistic transport emerges until @xmath12 reaches 1.4 . ]",
    "to further understand the numerical results , we find it necessary to also account for normal diffusion as the trajectories seek to land on ballistic trajectories from the chaotic sea .",
    "the associated normal diffusion rate is assumed to be @xmath118 .",
    "we further assume that the leakage rate from the chaotic sea to the ballistic structure is given by @xmath67 . then analogous to eq .",
    "( [ psquare ] ) , we expect to have @xmath119 where @xmath120 , with @xmath121 being the fraction of trajectories confined in some local stable islands in regime i and @xmath122 being their average momentum spread ; @xmath123 , with @xmath124 representing the fraction of trajectories undergoing normal diffusion , with @xmath118 being the associated diffusion constant ; @xmath125 is the faction of trajectories initially placed on ballistic structures , with @xmath70 being the diffusion coefficient",
    ". note that , unlike in the quantum case , at this point we do not first assume a constant probability leakage rate because , as seen below , the leakage involves different behavior at different time windows , and so @xmath67 can be rather complicated .",
    "indeed , as seen from fig .",
    "[ fig : phasesinglepoint ] , once the global kam curves are destroyed , the escape from a ( transient ) chaotic sea to a ballistic structure is extremely complicated : the boundary between them is hard to identify and different initial conditions sampled from an initial gaussian ensemble may need drastically different times to reach a ballistic structure .",
    "the coexistence of normal diffusion , ballistic transport , and the potentially complicated leakage rate @xmath67 makes the time dependence of @xmath126 even more interesting than the quantum case .",
    "let us roughly define a regime @xmath127 $ ] in the phase space , where trajectories are not doing ballistic motion . in connection with our observations made from fig .",
    "[ fig : phasesinglepoint ] , we choose @xmath128 .",
    "let @xmath129 be the occupation probability of this regime and @xmath130 be the occupation probability on ballistic structures .",
    "then @xmath131 .",
    "@xmath129 is plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10probleak_combine ] on either linear or logarithmic scales , for different time windows , for the value @xmath132 already studied in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10 ] . the right inset of fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10probleak_combine ] indicates that initially most trajectories are trapped in the regime @xmath127 $ ] , until @xmath133 .",
    "then @xmath129 starts to decrease more appreciably , with a time dependence not easy to fit [ see the first part of the curve in panel ( c ) ] .",
    "after @xmath134 kicks however , the relation between @xmath129 and @xmath0 becomes much more evident , i.e. @xmath135 , which indicates an exponential decay .",
    "the emergence of an exponential decay suggests that the ensemble has reached a certain steady configuration , as the escape probability now becomes proportional to the occupation probability itself .",
    "as also shown by the bottom inset and by the main figure of fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10probleak_combine ] , the coefficient @xmath71 slightly changes with time .",
    "expanding such an exponential decay to the first order , this escape would amount to an almost constant leakage rate of jumping onto phase space ballistic structures . as a result",
    ", one would naively expect , like our analysis in the quantum part , a superballistic transport case with @xmath65 .",
    "this prediction is certainly oversimplified as compared with our actual results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10 ] .     vs time , where @xmath136 defined in the text represents the occupation probability in a non - ballistic regime . for the two insets ( a ) and ( b )",
    ", @xmath129 vs time is plotted for two early stages , where it can be seen that initially most trajectories are trapped in the initial non - ballistic regime for @xmath137 .",
    "then @xmath129 starts to decrease appreciably in a nonlinear fashion .",
    "the inset ( c ) shows that the time dependence of @xmath138 is highly nonlinear before @xmath139 .",
    "however , after @xmath140 , @xmath138 and @xmath0 display a linear relation .",
    "the system parameters are the same as the case of @xmath132 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10 ] . ]    to better digest the results shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10 ] , we again focus on the case @xmath132 in connection with the time dependence of @xmath129 in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10probleak_combine ] . in the very",
    "beginning , @xmath129 remains almost a constant until @xmath141 kicks , so for this time period @xmath67 is essentially zero .",
    "therefore initially only the first three terms in eq .",
    "are non - zero , suggesting that the diffusion exponent of @xmath40 should be less than two .",
    "this explains the actual numerical result during the early stage .",
    "the plotted curve in fig .  [ fig : ksm10 ] at early times also has an increasing slope .",
    "this can be explained as follows . during the early stage , we have @xmath142 . when @xmath143 , the @xmath144 term starts to dominate",
    "so @xmath40 is close to normal diffusion .",
    "similarly , when @xmath145 , the @xmath146 term exceeds the first two , so we have a behavior close to ballistic transport for a quite long period until @xmath134 . on the other hand , from fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10probleak_combine ] , it is observed that since as early as @xmath133 , @xmath67 is already non - zero .",
    "so the leakage to the ballistic regime is building up long before an exponential leakage is observed at @xmath147 .",
    "this early - stage leakage to the ballistic regime starts to affect the time dependence of @xmath40 only until @xmath148 .",
    "we conjecture that this is the reason why in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10 ] a simple relation @xmath149 is not observed .",
    "in addition , the lack of such a simple superballistic behavior with @xmath65 is also consistent with the apparent nonlinear time dependence shown in panel ( c ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10probleak_combine ] before @xmath139 .",
    "$ ] vs @xmath150 , an analysis motivated by a reset of the start time at @xmath139 ( see the text for the details ) .",
    "the result here mainly displays a normal diffusion stage and a superballistic transport stage with an exponent close to @xmath65 .",
    "the computational example presented here is the same one in fig .",
    "[ fig : ksm10probleak_combine ] with @xmath132 .",
    "the dashes lines represent power - law fitting . ]    to confirm our qualitative analysis above , we now redefine the start time as the point when an exponential decay of @xmath129 can be clearly identified . again using the computational example shown in fig .",

    "almost all trajectories from the initial ensemble will end up on ballistic structures and then purely ballistic transport will take over .    returning to an early study  @xcite of the classical relativistic kr under the resonance condition",
    ", we have to disagree with some of their statements ; from our results we conclude that classical superballistic transport was not observed there because the investigation time scale there was too short .",
    "in this work , we show that both quantum and classical superballistic transport can occur in a simple periodically driven system , namely , a relativistic kicked - rotor system with a nonzero mass term . to our knowledge , this appealing scenario has not been discussed before . compared with previous lattice - junction models for quantum superballistic transport ,",
    "the superballistic transport in our model occurs in momentum space as a consequence of a natural divide imposed by the relativistic dispersion : regions with low momentum effectively have a quadratic ( bare ) dispersion relation ( hence effectively a quasi - random on - site potential ) and regions of high momentum effectively have a linear ( bare ) dispersion relation ( hence effectively a quasiperiodic potential ) .",
    "remarkably , though found in the same dynamical system , the quantum superballistic and classical superballistic transport we have analyzed are observed in much different parameter regimes .",
    "indeed , in the quantum case , the mechanism lies in the leakage of the quantum state from a regime of dynamical localization to a regime of ballistic transport .",
    "this leakage can occur even when the underlying classical limit has global kam invariant curves separating the two regimes . in the classical case ,",
    "it is necessary to break the global kam curves first to allow for leakage from a chaotic sea to ballistic trajectories . as a side result",
    ", we find that this kind of leakage in the classical dynamics is unexpectedly complicated and further studies can be motivated . for example , strictly speaking , the random patterns shown in the panel ( b ) of fig .",
    "[ fig : phasesinglepoint ] do not represent chaos ( chaos is defined as a positive lyapunov exponent in the asymptotic long - time limit , but this trajectory will eventually become ballistic and hence has a zero lyapunov exponent ) .",
    "the detailed characteristics of this type of irregular trajectory eventually becoming a regular ballistic one deserve more attention .",
    "the issue of quantum - classical correspondence concerning this type of trajectories is also of considerable interest for future studies .",
    "the classical relativistic kicked rotor model may be realized by considering relativistic electrons moving in the field generated by a special electrostatic wavepacket  @xcite . on the quantum side , a spinless version of the relativistic kicked rotor",
    "may be also realized by considering a kicked tight - binding lattice whose on - site potential can be determined by the relativistic dispersion relation  @xcite .",
    "however , due to the large time scales involved , a direct observation of our numerical results reported here is unlikely . as such it should be interesting enough to explore the system more to identify other signatures of superballistic transport at shorter time scales .",
