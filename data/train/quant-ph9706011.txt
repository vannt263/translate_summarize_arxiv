    "in both classical and quantum physics isolated systems can display unpredictable behavior , but the reasons for the unpredictability are quite different . in classical ( hamiltonian )",
    "mechanics unpredictability is a consequence of chaotic dynamics , or exponential sensitivity to initial conditions , which makes it impossible to predict the phase - space trajectory of a system to a certain accuracy from initial data given to the same accuracy .",
    "this unpredictability , which comes from not knowing the system s initial conditions precisely , is measured by the kolmogorov - sinai ( ks ) entropy , which is the rate at which initial data must be supplied in order to continue predicting the coarse - grained phase - space trajectory @xcite . in quantum mechanics",
    "there is no sensitivity to initial conditions in predicting the evolution of a state vector , because the unitary evolution of quantum mechanics preserves the inner product between state vectors .",
    "the absence of sensitivity to initial conditions seems to suggest that there is no quantum chaos . yet",
    "quantum mechanics has an even more fundamental kind of unpredictability , which has nothing to do with dynamics : even if a system s state vector is known precisely , the results of measurements are generally unpredictable .    to compare the unpredictability of classical and quantum dynamics , we first remove the usual sources of unpredictability from consideration and then introduce a new source of unpredictability that is the same in both classical and quantum dynamics .",
    "the first step is to focus in classical physics on the evolution of phase - space distributions , governed by the liouville equation , instead of on phase - space trajectories , and to focus in quantum physics on the evolution of state vectors , governed by the schrdinger equation .",
    "the liouville equation preserves the overlap between distributions , so there is no sensitivity to initial conditions in predicting the evolution of a phase - space distribution . by shifting attention from phase - space trajectories to distributions ,",
    "we remove lack of knowledge of initial conditions as a source of unpredictability .",
    "moreover , by considering only schrdinger evolution of state vectors , i.e. , evolution uninterrupted by measurements , we eliminate the intrinsic randomness of quantum measurements as a source of unpredictability .",
    "the conclusion that there is no chaos in quantum evolution is now seen to be too facile . were things so simple , one would have to conclude that there is no chaos in classical liouville evolution either @xcite . having taken both classical and quantum unpredictability out of the picture , we introduce a new source of unpredictability to investigate chaos in the dynamics .",
    "we do this by adding to the system hamiltonian , either classical or quantum mechanical , a stochastic perturbation .",
    "we measure the unpredictability introduced by the perturbation in terms of the increase of system entropy . by gathering information about the history of the perturbation",
    ", one can make the increase of system entropy smaller . to characterize the resistance of the system to predictability",
    ", we compare the information gathered about the perturbation with the entropy reduction that this information purchases .",
    "we say that a system is _ hypersensitive to perturbation _",
    "@xcite if the perturbation information is much larger than the associated system - entropy reduction , and we regard hypersensitivity to perturbation as the signature of chaos in liouville or schrdinger evolution ( see sec .",
    "[ sechyp ] ) .",
    "for classical systems we have shown that systems with chaotic dynamics display an _ exponential _ hypersensitivity to perturbation @xcite , in which the ratio of perturbation information to entropy reduction grows exponentially in time , with the exponential rate of growth given by the ks entropy .",
    "thus , for classical systems , we have established that exponential hypersensitivity to perturbation characterizes chaos in liouville evolution in a way that is exactly equivalent to the standard characterization of chaos in terms of the unpredictability of phase - space trajectories ( see sec .",
    "[ secclassical ] ) .    for a variety of quantum systems",
    "we have used numerical simulations to investigate hypersensitivity to perturbation @xcite .",
    "the simulations suggest that hypersensitivity to perturbation provides a characterization of chaos in quantum dynamics : quantum systems whose classical dynamics is chaotic display a quantum hypersensitivity to perturbation , which comes about because the perturbation generates state vectors that are nearly randomly distributed in the system hilbert space , whereas quantum systems whose classical dynamics is not chaotic do not display hypersensitivity to perturbation ( see sec .",
    "[ secquantum ] ) .",
    "hypersensitivity to perturbation , in either classical or quantum mechanics , is defined in terms of information and entropy .",
    "the entropy @xmath0 of an isolated physical system ( gibbs entropy for a classical system , von neumann entropy for a quantum system ) does not change under hamiltonian time evolution .",
    "if the time evolution of the system is perturbed through interaction with an incompletely known environment , however , averaging over the perturbation typically leads to an entropy increase @xmath1 . throughout this paper , we make the simplifying assumption that the interaction with the environment is equivalent to a stochastic perturbation of the hamiltonian , a restriction we hope to be able to remove in the future .",
    "conditions under which this assumption is valid are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the increase of the system entropy can be limited to an amount @xmath2 , the _ tolerable entropy increase _ , by obtaining , from the environment , information about the perturbation .",
    "we denote by @xmath3 the minimum information about the perturbation needed , on the average , to keep the system entropy below the tolerable level @xmath2 . a formal definition of the quantities @xmath1 , @xmath2 , and @xmath3 can be found in  @xcite for the classical case and in  @xcite for the quantum case .",
    "entropy and information acquire physical content in the presence of a heat reservoir at temperature @xmath4 .",
    "if all energy in the form of heat is ultimately exchanged with the heat reservoir , then each bit of entropy , i.e. , each bit of _ missing information _ about the system state , reduces by the amount @xmath5 the energy that can be extracted from the system in the form of useful work .",
    "the connection between _ acquired _ information and work is provided by landauer s principle @xcite , according to which not only each bit of missing information , but also each bit of acquired information , has a free - energy cost of @xmath5 .",
    "this cost , the _",
    "landauer erasure cost _",
    ", is paid when the acquired information is erased .",
    "acquired information can be quantified by algorithmic information @xcite .",
    "we now define that a system is hypersensitive to perturbation if the information @xmath3 required to reduce the system entropy from @xmath6 to @xmath2 is large compared to the entropy reduction @xmath7 , i.e. , @xmath8 the information @xmath3 purchases a reduction @xmath9 in system entropy , which is equivalent to an increase in the useful work that can be extracted from the system ; hypersensitivity to perturbation means that the landauer erasure cost of the information is much larger than the increase in available work .",
    "hypersensitivity to perturbation means that the inequality  ( [ eqhyp ] ) holds for almost all values of @xmath2 .",
    "the inequality  ( [ eqhyp ] ) tends always to hold , however , for sufficiently small values of @xmath10 .",
    "the reason is that for these small values of @xmath2 , one is gathering enough information from the perturbing environment to track a particular system state whose entropy is nearly equal to the initial system entropy . in other words ,",
    "one is essentially tracking a particular realization of the perturbation among all possible realizations .",
    "thus , for small values of @xmath2 , the information @xmath3 becomes a property of the perturbation ; it is the information needed to specify a particular realization of the perturbation .",
    "the important regime for assessing hypersensitivity to perturbation is where @xmath2 is fairly close to @xmath6 , and it is in this regime that one can hope that @xmath3 reveals something about the system dynamics , rather than properties of the perturbation .",
    "in this section we do not aim for rigor ; many statements in this section are without formal proof .",
    "instead , our objective here is to extract the important ideas from the rigorous analysis given in  @xcite and to use them to develop a heuristic physical picture of why chaotic systems display exponential hypersensitivity to perturbation . for a simple illustration and a system where exact solutions exist ,",
    "see  @xcite .",
    "this section is an abbreviated version of the discussion section of  @xcite .",
    "consider a classical hamiltonian system whose dynamics unfolds on a @xmath11-dimensional phase space , and suppose that the system is perturbed by a stochastic hamiltonian whose effect can be described as diffusion on phase space .",
    "suppose that the system is globally chaotic with ks entropy  @xmath12 .",
    "for such a system a phase - space density is stretched and folded by the chaotic dynamics , developing exponentially fine structure as the dynamics proceeds .",
    "a simple picture is that the phase - space density stretches exponentially in half the phase - space dimensions and contracts exponentially in the other half of the dimensions .",
    "the perturbation is characterized by a perturbation strength and by correlation cells .",
    "we can take the perturbation strength to be the typical distance ( e.g. , euclidean distance with respect to some fixed set of canonical cordinates ) that a phase - space point diffuses under the perturbation during an @xmath13-folding time , @xmath14 , in a typical contracting dimension .",
    "the perturbation becomes effective ( in a sense defined precisely in ref .",
    "@xcite ) when the phase - space density has roughly the same size in the contracting dimensions as the perturbation strength .",
    "once the perturbation becomes effective , the effects of the diffusive perturbation and of the further exponential contraction roughly balance one another , leaving the _ average _ phase - space density with a constant size in the contracting dimensions .",
    "the correlation cells are phase - space cells over which the effects of the perturbation are well correlated and between which the effects of the perturbation are essentially uncorrelated .",
    "we assume that all the correlation cells have approximately the same phase - space volume .",
    "we can get a rough idea of the effect of the perturbation by regarding the correlation cells as receiving independent perturbations .",
    "moreover , the diffusive effects of the perturbation during an @xmath13-folding time @xmath14 are compressed exponentially during the next such @xmath13-folding time ; this means that once the perturbation becomes effective , the main effects of the perturbation at a particular time are due to the diffusion during the immediately preceding @xmath13-folding time .",
    "since a chaotic system can not be shielded forever from the effects of the perturbation , we can choose the initial time @xmath15 to be the time at which the perturbation is just becoming effective .",
    "we suppose that at @xmath15 the unperturbed density is spread over @xmath16 correlation cells , @xmath17 being the time when the unperturbed density occupies a single correlation cell .",
    "the essence of the ks entropy is that for large times @xmath18 the unperturbed density spreads over @xmath19 correlation cells , in each of which it occupies roughly the same phase - space volume .",
    "the exponential increase of @xmath20 continues until the unperturbed density is spread over essentially all the correlation cells .",
    "we can regard the unperturbed density as being made up of _ subdensities _ , one in each occupied correlation cell and all having roughly the same phase - space volume .",
    "after @xmath15 , when the perturbation becomes effective , the _ average _ density continues to spread exponentially in the expanding dimensions .",
    "as noted above , this spreading is not balanced by contraction in the other dimensions , so the phase - space volume occupied by the average density grows as @xmath21 , leading to an entropy increase @xmath22 just as the unperturbed density can be broken up into subdensities , so the average density can be broken up into _ average subdensities _",
    ", one in each occupied correlation cell .",
    "each average subdensity occupies a phase - space volume that is @xmath21 times as big as the volume occupied by an unperturbed subdensity .",
    "the unperturbed density is embedded within the phase - space volume occupied by the average density and itself occupies a volume that is smaller by a factor of @xmath23 .",
    "we can picture a _ perturbed _",
    "density crudely by imagining that in each occupied correlation cell the unperturbed subdensity is moved rigidly to some new position within the volume occupied by the _",
    "average _ subdensity ; the result is a _",
    "perturbed subdensity_. a _ perturbed density _ is made up of perturbed subdensities , one in each occupied correlation cell .",
    "all of the possible perturbed densities are produced by the perturbation with roughly the same probability .",
    "suppose now that we wish to hold the entropy increase to a tolerable amount @xmath2 .",
    "we must first describe what it means to specify the phase - space density at a level of resolution set by a tolerable entropy increase @xmath2 .",
    "an approximate description can be obtained in the following way .",
    "take an occupied correlation cell , and divide the volume occupied by the average subdensity in that cell into @xmath24 nonoverlapping volumes , all of the same size .",
    "aggregate all the perturbed subdensities that lie predominantly within a particular one of these nonoverlapping volumes to produce a _",
    "coarse - grained subdensity_. there are @xmath25 coarse - grained subdensities within each occupied correlation cell , each having a phase - space volume that is bigger than the volume occupied by a perturbed subdensity by a factor of @xmath26 a _ coarse - grained density _ is made up by choosing a coarse - grained subdensity in each occupied correlation cell .",
    "a coarse - grained density occupies a phase - space volume that is bigger than the volume occupied by the unperturbed density by the factor @xmath27 of eq .",
    "( [ cgvolume ] ) and hence represents an entropy increase @xmath28 thus to specify the phase - space density at a level of resolution set by @xmath29 means roughly to specify a coarse - grained density . the further entropy increase on averaging over the perturbation",
    "is given by @xmath30    what about the information @xmath3 required to hold the entropy increase to @xmath2 ?",
    "since there are @xmath31 coarse - grained subdensities in an occupied correlation cell , each produced with roughly the same probability by the perturbation , it takes approximately @xmath32 bits to specify a particular coarse - grained subdensity . to describe a coarse - grained density",
    ", one must specify a coarse - grained subdensity in each of the @xmath20 occupied correlation cells .",
    "thus the information required to specify a coarse - grained density  and , hence , the information required to hold the entropy increase to @xmath2is given by @xmath33 corresponding to there being a total of @xmath34 coarse - grained densities .",
    "the entropy increase  ( [ furtherincrease ] ) comes from counting the number of _ nonoverlapping _ coarse - grained densities that are required to fill the volume occupied by the average density , that number being @xmath31 .",
    "in contrast , the information @xmath3 comes from counting the exponentially greater number of ways of forming _ overlapping _ coarse - grained densities by choosing one of the @xmath35 nonoverlapping coarse - grained subdensities in each of the @xmath20 correlation cells .",
    "the picture developed in this section , summarized neatly in eq .",
    "( [ picsum ] ) , requires that @xmath2 be big enough that a coarse - grained subdensity is much larger than a perturbed subdensity , so that we can talk meaningfully about the perturbed subdensities that lie predominantly _ within _ a coarse - grained subdensity . if @xmath2 becomes too small , eq .  ( [ picsum ] ) breaks down , and the information @xmath36 , rather than reflecting a property of the chaotic dynamics as in eq .",
    "( [ picsum ] ) , becomes essentially a property of the perturbation , reflecting a counting of the number of possible realizations of the perturbation .",
    "the boundary between the two kinds of behavior of @xmath3 is set roughly by the number @xmath37 of contracting phase - space dimensions . when @xmath38 , the characteristic scale of a coarse - grained subdensity in the contracting dimensions is a factor of @xmath39 larger than the characteristic size of a perturbed subdensity in the contracting dimensions . in this regime",
    "the picture developed in this section is at least approximately valid , because a coarse - grained subdensity can accommodate several perturbed subdensities in each contracting dimension .",
    "the information @xmath3 quantifies the effects of the perturbation on scales as big as or bigger than the finest scale set by the system dynamics .",
    "these effects , as quantified in @xmath3 , tell us directly about the size of the exponentially fine structure created by the system dynamics . thus @xmath3 becomes a property of the system dynamics , rather than a property of the perturbation .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath40 , we are required to keep track of the phase - space density on a very fine scale in the contracting dimensions , a scale smaller than the characteristic size of a perturbed subdensity in the contracting dimensions .",
    "subdensities are considered to be distinct , even though they overlap substantially , provided that they differ by more than this very fine scale in the contracting dimensions .",
    "the information @xmath36 is the logarithm of the number of realizations of the perturbation which differ by more than this very fine scale in at least one correlation cell .",
    "the information becomes a property of the perturbation because it reports on the effects of the perturbation on scales finer than the finest scale set by the system dynamics ",
    ", scales that are , at the time of interest , irrelevant to the system dynamics .    we are now prepared to put in final form the exponential hypersensitivity to perturbation of systems with a positive ks entropy : @xmath41 once the chaotic dynamics renders the perturbation effective , this exponential hypersensitivity to perturbation is essentially independent of the form and strength of the perturbation .",
    "its essence is that within each correlation cell there is a roughly even trade - off between entropy reduction and information , but for the entire phase - space density the trade - off is exponentially unfavorable because the density occupies an exponentially increasing number of correlation cells , in each of which it is perturbed independently .    what about systems with regular , or integrable dynamics ?",
    "though we expect no universal behavior for regular systems , we can get an idea of the possibilities from the heuristic description developed in this section .",
    "hypersensitivity to perturbation requires , first , that the phase - space density develop structure on the scale of the strength of the perturbation , so that the perturbation becomes effective , and , second , that after the perturbation becomes effective , the phase - space density spread over many correlation cells .    for many regular systems there will be no hypersensitivity simply because the phase - space density does not develop fine enough structure .",
    "regular dynamics can give rise to nonlinear shearing , however , in which case the density can develop structure on the scale of the strength of the perturbation and can spread over many correlation cells . in this situation , one expects the picture developed in this section to apply at least approximately : to hold the entropy increase to @xmath2 requires giving @xmath42 bits per occupied correlation cell ; @xmath3 is related to @xmath2 by eq .",
    "( [ picsum ] ) , with @xmath20 being the number of correlation cells occupied at time @xmath18 .",
    "thus regular systems can display hypersensitivity to perturbation if @xmath20 becomes large ( although this behavior could be eliminated by choosing correlation cells that are aligned with the nonlinear shearing produced by the system dynamics ) , but they can not display _ exponential _ hypersensitivity to perturbation because the growth of @xmath20 is slower than exponential .    a more direct way of stating this conclusion is to reiterate what we have explained in this section and shown in ref .",
    "@xcite : exponential hypersensitivity to perturbation is equivalent to the spreading of phase - space densities over an exponentially increasing number of phase - space cells ; such exponential spreading holds for chaotic , but not for regular systems and is quantified by a positive value of the kolmogorov - sinai entropy .",
    "the simplifying restriction on the interaction with the environment made in sec .",
    "[ sechyp ] means , for the quantum case , that the interaction with the environment is equivalent to a stochastic unitary time evolution .",
    "given this assumption , we can proceed as follows . at a given time",

    "[ sechyp ] . given @xmath2 ,",
    "we want to partition the list of vectors @xmath49 into groups so as to minimize the information @xmath62 without violating the condition @xmath63 .",
    "to minimize @xmath62 , it is clearly favorable to make the groups as large as possible .",
    "furthermore , to reduce the contribution to @xmath64 of a group containing a given number of vectors , it is favorable to choose vectors that are as close together as possible in hilbert space . here",
    "the distance between two vectors @xmath65 and @xmath66 can be quantified in terms of the hilbert - space angle @xcite @xmath67 consequently , to find a nearly optimal grouping , we choose an arbitrary _ resolution angle _ @xmath68 ( @xmath69 ) and group together vectors that are less than an angle @xmath68 apart .",
    "more precisely , groups are formed in the following way . starting with the first vector , @xmath65 , in the list @xmath49 , the first group is formed of @xmath65 and all vectors in @xmath49 that are within an angle @xmath68 of @xmath65 .",
    "the same procedure is repeated with the remaining vectors to form the second group , then the third group , continuing until no ungrouped vectors are left .",
    "this grouping of vectors corresponds to a partial averaging over the perturbations . to describe a vector at resolution level @xmath68 amounts to averaging over those details of the perturbation that do not change the final vector by more than an angle @xmath68 .    for each resolution angle @xmath68 , the grouping procedure described above defines an average conditional entropy @xmath70 and an average information @xmath71 .",
