    "several @xmath3 resonances were established recently , far too many to be accommodated in the ground state scalar nonet @xcite . below 1600 mev , four isospin",
    "zero resonances are required to describe the isoscalar @xmath4 s - wave : the very broad ( @xmath5 600 mev ) @xmath6 ( or @xmath7 ) , the narrow @xmath8 at the @xmath9 threshold , the broad ( @xmath5 400 mev ) @xmath10 , and the comparatively narrow ( 109 @xmath11 7 mev ) @xmath0 .",
    "the latter , first observed in @xmath12 annihilation at rest , was reported in many other reactions and is among the best established unstable mesons .",
    "for example , it is observed to decay into @xmath4 @xcite , @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite in @xmath12 annihilation at rest , and in @xmath16 central collisions at 450 gev , into @xmath4 and @xmath9 @xcite , @xmath13 @xcite , @xmath14 @xcite and @xmath15 @xcite .",
    "it also reported in an analysis of the @xmath17 dalitz plot @xcite and in the @xmath15 mass distribution in @xmath18 radiative decays @xcite .",
    "it was , however , not observed so far in @xmath19 collisions @xcite .",
    "the small branching ratios for @xmath9 decay - compared to @xmath20 - of @xmath10 and @xmath0 point to both states being compatible with @xmath21 structures , while only one can be accommodated in a su(3 ) nonet . in an earlier work",
    "@xcite we suggested that three isoscalar mesons in the 1500 mev mass region , a @xmath22 state , an @xmath2 and the ground state scalar glueball predicted by lattice gauge theories @xcite mix to produce @xmath10 , @xmath0 and the at that time still to be identified third scalar state . in this scenario ,",
    "a large ( @xmath23 ) gluonic component was suggested in the @xmath0 wavefunction , while @xmath10 remained largely @xmath22 , and the missing state mainly @xmath2 .",
    "this was inferred ( i ) from the apparent absence of @xmath9 signal in earlier bubble chamber exposures suggesting a cancellation between amplitudes , ( ii ) from the narrow width of @xmath0 compared to the other known scalars , and ( iii ) from the observation of an isovector @xmath24 in this mass region . in this model the ground state ( @xmath25 ) scalar",
    "nonet was therefore made of @xmath24 , @xmath10 , an @xmath2 state around 1700 mev ( both with small glue components ) , and @xmath26 , while @xmath0 was mainly glue .",
    "on the other hand , the @xmath8 and @xmath27 could be @xmath9 molecules or four - quark states @xcite , or together with @xmath6 , meson - meson resonances @xcite .",
    "alternative mixing schemes also imbedding quarkonia @xmath10 and @xmath0 have been proposed @xcite .",
    "the @xmath9 decay mode of @xmath0 was observed meanwhile @xcite and is somewhat stronger than the upper limit from bubble chamber experiments , but still much weaker than the @xmath4 mode .",
    "this indicates that @xmath0 , if interpreted as a @xmath28 state , can have only a small @xmath2 component .",
    "also , the missing @xmath2 scalar has now been observed : the longstanding controversy on the spin of the @xmath29 ( @xmath30 = 0 or 2 ) was lifted in favour of @xmath31 @xcite .",
    "the early amplitude analysis of former central production data assumed the spin 2 @xmath32 around 1500 mev , but no @xmath0 .",
    "an updated analysis along the lines of ref .",
    "@xcite , but using instead of crystal barrel data more recent results from central collisions , leads to 83 % @xmath2 in @xmath1 and 60 % @xmath22 in @xmath10 , while @xmath0 contains the largest fraction of glue ( 48 % ) @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this letter is to discuss the impact of these and other new data on the quark structures of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . in particular",
    ", we will show that for @xmath0 the @xmath9 and @xmath19 data do not appear to be consistent with a dominantly quarkonium state , while the @xmath9 data suggest a large @xmath2 component in the @xmath1 wavefunction .",
    "the branching ratios for @xmath0 decay into @xmath4 , @xmath9 and @xmath13 have been measured by several groups : crystal barrel quotes from a coupled channel analysis of the @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 data in @xmath12 annihilation at rest @xcite and from the @xmath36 channel @xcite : @xmath37 while wa102 reports in @xmath16 central collisions @xcite @xmath38 the @xmath39 ratio was also measured by crystal barrel with 900 mev / c antiprotons @xcite : 0.080 @xmath11 0.033 . the preliminary results for @xmath40 from the obelix collaboration is 0.24 @xmath11 0.02 @xcite . for @xmath40",
    "the agreement between experiments is not particularly good .",
    "however , branching ratios are sensitive to interference effects and are not defined unambiguously .",
    "the apparent discrepancy should therefore not be overemphasized .",
    "the disagreement is perhaps due to the nearby @xmath24 which absorbs a significant fraction of the @xmath9 rate in crystal barrel data , but is not required by the wa102 data , and reported at the lower mass of 1300 mev for the obelix data . in any case , all data indicate that the coupling of @xmath0 to @xmath9 is small compared to @xmath4 .    to quantify this result we recall the formulae to compute the partial width of a scalar ( or tensor ) meson decaying into two pseudoscalar mesons @xmath41 and @xmath42 @xcite @xmath43 with @xmath44 @xmath45 0.5 gev / c , where @xmath46 is the breakup momentum and @xmath47 the relative angular momentum ( 0 or 2 ) .",

    "\\gamma^2(\\eta\\eta ) & = &   \\left [ \\cos\\alpha \\left(\\cos^2\\phi - \\sqrt{2 } \\tan\\alpha\\sin^2\\phi\\right ) \\right ] ^2 \\ . \\label{f3}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] here @xmath50 = 54.7@xmath51 and @xmath52 = 54.7@xmath53 .",
    "the angle @xmath54 is the octet - singlet mixing angle in the nonet of the decaying meson and @xmath55 the mixing angle in the pseudoscalar nonet .",
    "we shall use the value @xmath55 =  ( 17.3 @xmath11 1.8)@xmath56 measured from @xmath12 annihilation rates into two pseudoscalar mesons @xcite .",
    "the wavefunction of the isoscalar @xmath28 meson , say @xmath57 , ist then given by @xmath58    hence for @xmath50 = 0 the meson is pure @xmath59 and for @xmath50 = 90@xmath56 pure @xmath2 ( ideal mixing ) .",
    "these prescriptions provide a very good description e.g. of the measured tensor meson decays @xcite , leading to a tensor mixing angle @xmath54 @xmath45 27@xmath56 , in accord with the linear and quadratic mass formulae .",
    "note that , as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , possible su(3 ) breaking effects are small , and are accordingly neglected in our formulae ( [ f3 ] ) ( hence the parameter @xmath60 in the appendix a of ref .",
    "@xcite is set to unity ) .",
    "let us calculate the measured ratios @xmath61 and @xmath62 using eqn .",
    "( [ gammas ] ) .",
    "we obtain @xmath63 for crystal barrel and wa102 , respectively , while @xmath64 note that for a pure @xmath22 state @xmath65 is expected to be 1/3 .",
    "figure [ etakkpipi ] shows the predicted dependence of the ratios @xmath66 and @xmath65 on the angle @xmath50 for isoscalar mesons and the experimental results for @xmath0 .",
    "we find that @xmath67 ( or 180@xmath56 ) .",
    "the @xmath14 decay rate from crystal barrel is also consistent with @xmath68 @xcite .",
    "if interpreted as a @xmath28 state the meson @xmath0 is therefore clearly dominantly @xmath59 .",
    "two comments are in order here .",
    "first , this conclusion is not sensitive to a reasonable departure ( @xmath69 ) of the su(3 ) breaking @xmath60 from unity .",
    "second , assuming instead a pseudoscalar mixing angle @xmath55 = 10@xmath56 , as suggested by the quadratic mass formula for the @xmath70 nonet @xcite , leads to a very poor agreement of the measured @xmath66 and @xmath65 with su(3 ) for any angle @xmath50 . in this case , it is difficult to reconcile @xmath0 with a @xmath28 state .",
    "so far , only one experiment , wa102 , measured the corresponding ratios of partial widths for the @xmath1 meson and reported @xcite @xmath71 leading to the ratios @xmath72 and @xmath73 , which are also shown in fig .",
    "[ etakkpipi ] .",
    "the data are consistent with a state dominantly @xmath2 ( @xmath5 86% for @xmath74 ) .",
    "furthermore , a pure ( ideally mixed ) @xmath2 meson should not be produced in @xmath12 annihilation due to the ozi rule and , indeed , crystal barrel does not observe @xmath1 in @xmath12 annihilation at 900 mev / c , while @xmath0 is produced copiously @xcite .",
    "the l3 and aleph collaborations at lep have reported new results in @xmath19 collisions around the @xmath75 pole and at higher energies @xcite .",
    "the @xmath76 is seen by aleph in the @xmath77 mass spectrum , but neither @xmath0 nor @xmath1 are observed and 95% confidence level upper limits of 310 ev , respectively 550 ev are given for the formation and decay of these states into @xmath78 . according to crystal barrel , @xmath15 decays account for more than half of the decay rate of @xmath0 .",
    "the @xmath78 decay branching ratio was measured : a compilation from early data @xcite gives 0.193 @xmath11 0.050 , in agreement with a more recent 0.226 @xmath11 0.079 from an extensive analysis of @xmath12 annihilation into @xmath79 @xcite . using the latter and combining with aleph we therefore obtain for the upper limit @xmath80 at the 95 % confidence level .",
    "the l3 collaboration measuring @xmath81 observes the @xmath76 and the @xmath82 , the @xmath83 , and a dominantly spin 2 signal around 1750 mev , which is assigned to the @xmath29 ( with , however , @xmath84 ) .",
    "the measured partial width is @xmath85 however , roughly 25 % of the signal is due to @xmath31 . assuming this signal to come from the @xmath1 one obtains @xcite @xmath86 a spin 0 signal at 1500 mev is totally excluded by the l3 data , but the corresponding , presumably very small , upper limit for @xmath0 is not given .",
    "we shall argue below that the spin 2 component could instead be due to the ( isovector ) radial excitation @xmath87 and that the spin 0 component is consistent with a mainly @xmath2 @xmath1 .    the two - photon width of the isoscalar meson @xmath57 ( eqn .",
    "( [ psi ] ) ) with mass @xmath88 is given within su(3 ) by @xmath89 which vanishes for @xmath50 = 74@xmath56 , and where @xmath90 is a nonet constant ( for the isoscalar partner @xmath91 in the nonet replace @xmath50 by @xmath50 + 90@xmath56 ) .",
    "this formula is quite reliable as it reproduces the measured two - photon widths of the @xmath92 mesons @xmath76 and @xmath32 and those of the @xmath70 isoscalars @xmath93 and @xmath94 ( the latter albeit with 10% su(3 ) violating corrections ) . to gain confidence in the formula ,",
    "let us examine the predicted ratio @xmath95 @xmath96 as a function of @xmath50 .",
    "this is shown in fig .",
    "[ f2poverf2 ] and compared to the measured ratio of 0.0328 @xmath11 0.0062 @xcite .",
    "this ratio is extremely sensitive to the tensor mixing angle and one obtains the accurate value @xmath54 = ( 27.3 @xmath11 0.8 ) @xmath56 , in excellent agreement with the mass formulae .",
    "also , we find from eqn .",
    "( [ twogam ] ) and the two - photon partial width @xmath97 = 9 @xmath90 @xmath98 for the isovector meson @xmath99 the well - known ratios of partial widths which read apart from @xmath98 factors @xmath100 and which hold in the case of ideal mixing .",
    "thus , as will become crucial in the following discussion , a pure @xmath2 isoscalar has a two - photon width an order of magnitude smaller than its @xmath59 partner .",
    "the constant @xmath90 for the tensor nonet can be calculated from e.g. the two - photon width of @xmath32 @xcite : @xmath90 = 4.9 @xmath101 mev@xmath102 which , in turn , leads to a predicted two - photon partial width of 1.0 kev for the @xmath82 , in excellent agreement with the measured value @xcite .",
    "let us now deal with scalar mesons . in a non - relativistic calculation",
    "the two - photon width is given by @xcite @xmath103 with obvious notations . here",
    "the factor @xmath104 stands for spin multiplicities .",
    "how reliable is this relation ?",
    "it can be checked with recent data on the charmonium states @xmath105 and @xmath106 : the ratio of @xmath106 to @xmath105 two - photon widths is measured to be 6.7 @xmath11 2.1 while eqn .",
    "( [ zerototwo ] ) predicts the somewhat smaller value of 3.3 .",
    "relativistic calculations lead to a smaller value of scalar two - photon widths with @xmath107 @xcite . assuming that @xmath10 is the mainly @xmath59 scalar ,",
    "one then predicts with formula ( [ zerototwo ] ) a two - photon width of 5.7 kev , in good agreement with analyses of @xmath108 @xcite .",
    "we shall therefore assume that for @xmath109 in the range 2 @xmath110 formula ( [ zerototwo ] ) provides a reliable estimate of scalar two - photon widths .",
    "figure [ f0width ] then shows the two - photon width expected for a @xmath3 isoscalar at 1500 mev as a function of @xmath50 , calculated from eqns .",
    "( [ twogam ] ) and ( [ zerototwo ] ) , together with the 95% confidence level upper limit ( [ ulimit ] ) from aleph . assuming a @xmath28 structure",
    ", the lack of @xmath0 production in @xmath19 implies that this state must be mainly @xmath2 ( 50 @xmath111 ) .",
    "this is , however , in clear contradiction with the @xmath59 dominance discussed in the previous section and therefore suggests that @xmath0 is of a different nature .",
    "little can be said about @xmath1 from the aleph data , since its decay branching ratio into @xmath78 is not known . assuming @xmath50 @xmath5 112 @xmath56 from the previous section , we find from fig .",
    "[ f0width ] and the aleph two - photon upper limit of 550 ev a @xmath78 branching ratio of at most 5 to 10 % , hence small , as expected for a mainly @xmath2 state .",
    "let us now turn to the l3 data @xcite and to the signal observed around 1750 mev .",
    "since decay branching ratios into @xmath9 are not known , only qualitative statements can be made .",
    "assuming that the spin two component is due to the @xmath87 reported by l3 in @xmath112 @xcite and by crystal barrel in @xmath113 @xcite one would obtain from the partial width ( [ a2 ] ) and with , say , a 5% decay branching ratio into @xmath9 , a two - photon width of @xmath45 1 kev .",
    "these numbers are comparable to those for the ground state @xmath82 .",
    "as far as the spin zero signal is concerned , the upper limit ( [ f0 ] ) can be accommodated by a nearly pure @xmath2 with a large @xmath9 decay branching ratio ( see fig . [ f0width ] ) .",
    "as we have argued , the measured @xmath4 , @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath9 decay rates of @xmath0 in @xmath12 annihilation and central production are consistent with those expected for a @xmath22 state . on the other hand , @xmath0 is not produced in @xmath19 collisions , with an upper limit at the level expected for a mainly @xmath2 state .",
    "this contradiction suggests that @xmath0 is not a @xmath28 state .",
    "a four - quark state is unlikely since its two - photon width is not significantly smaller than for a @xmath28 state .",
    "for example , a partial width of @xmath45 0.6 kev is predicted in ref .",
    "@xcite for the prominent candidate @xmath27 , while formula ( [ zerototwo ] ) gives 0.8 kev for a @xmath28 state ( using 1 kev for the @xmath82 and @xmath114 ) .",
    "the natural explanation is that @xmath0 is a gluonium state , since the production of glue in @xmath19 collisions is suppressed .",
    "its mass also lies in the correct range , lattice gauge calculations predicting the ground state scalar glueball to be at 1611 @xmath11 30 @xmath11 160 mev @xcite .",
    "the @xmath1 appears to be dominantly @xmath2 from @xmath4 , @xmath13 and @xmath9 data in central collisions .",
    "this is consistent with its absence in @xmath12 annihilation where scalars are copiously produced and no mechanism is known preventing the production of @xmath22 scalars .",
    "we note that , surprisingly for an @xmath2 state , no signal for @xmath1 was reported earlier in @xmath115 interactions @xcite .",
    "however , the assumption in the analysis was that its spin was two .",
    "the @xmath2 dominance is consistent with ( but not required by ) @xmath19 data , since only few decay branching ratios have been measured for this state .",
    "in particular , the absolute two - body decay rates are not known and are urgently needed from future experiments .",
    "if one now assumes @xmath24 , @xmath10 , @xmath1 and @xmath26 , one obtains from the linear mass formula @xmath116}{3m[f_0(1370)]+m(a_0)-4m(k_0^*)}\\ ] ] the @xmath3 mixing angle @xmath117 + 54.7@xmath118 for a low mass ( 1300 mev ) @xmath119 or @xmath120 for a high mass ( 1470 mev ) @xmath119 @xcite .",
    "we have assumed for @xmath10 a mass of 1360 mev @xcite .",
    "the mixing angle is also sensitive to the mass of this state which is not well known @xcite .",
    "it is interesting to note that these values of @xmath50 are in the correct range , see the data on the @xmath1 in fig .",
    "[ etakkpipi ] above .",
    "the glueball is the @xmath0 in our model",
    ". this may be too simple minded , since the two @xmath28 isoscalars are likely to mix with the nearby glueball .",
    "nonetheless these results strongly favour the scenario where @xmath0 is largely glue and @xmath1 dominantly @xmath2 @xcite , and disfavour @xmath1 being the glueball @xcite .",
    "more quantitative statements will have to await more accurate @xmath19 data and theoretical guidance on the production rate of glueballs in electromagnetic processes .",
