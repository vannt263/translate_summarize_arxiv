    "although much effort has been made since the local ultraluminous iras galaxies ( uligs ) were discovered , the dominant energy output mechanism and the evolutionary connection between circum - nuclear starbursts and active galactic nuclei ( agns ) are still a matter of debate ( kim , veilleux , & sanders 1998 ; veilleux , kim , & sanders 1999a ; veilleux , sanders , & kim 1997 , 1999b ; goldader et al . 1995 ; murphy et al . 2001 ; genzel et al .",
    "1998 ; lutz et al . 1998 ; rigopoulou et al . 1999 ; tran et al . 2001 ) . from recent high resolution multi - wavelength observations ,",
    "it is now widely accepted that the vast majority of uligs are strongly interacting or merging galaxies ( e.g. , clements et al .",
    "1996 ; murphy et al . 1996 ; veilleux , kim , & sanders 2002 ) .",
    "the agn phenomenon appears at the final merging stage and the fraction of objects with agn spectral characteristics is about 30% while the fraction of type 1 agns is less than 10% ( e.g. , clements et al .",
    "1996 ; kim , veilleux , & sanders 1998 ; wu et al . 1998",
    "; zheng et al . 1999 ; canalizo & stockton 2001 ; cui et al . 2001 ) . however , the percentage of agns increases with infrared luminosity , reaching 3050% for @xmath0",
    "( veilleux , kim , & sanders 1999a ) .",
    "zheng et al . ( 2002 ) carefully investigated the optical spectroscopic properties of infrared - selected type 1 agns consisting of 25 objects with infrared luminosities @xmath1 .",
    "( following zheng et al . 2002 , we refer to them as ir qsos . )",
    "they found that the majority of ir qsos have relatively narrow permitted emission lines compared with optically - selected palomar green quasars ( pg qsos ) , which are from the palomar bright quasar survey catalogue ( schmidt & green 1983 ) with redshift less than 0.5 ( boroson & green 1992 , hereafter bg92 ) .",
    "furthermore , more than 70% of ir qsos are moderately or extremely strong emitters .",
    "canalizo & stockton ( 2001 ) proposed that such ir qsos are at a transitional stage between uligs and optically - selected qsos as their host galaxies are undergoing interacting or major merging accompanied by massive starbursts .",
    "in fact , all the optical spectroscopic properties of ir qsos show that they are located at one extreme end of eigenvector 1 ( or the first principal component ) defined by bg92 in their principal component analysis .",
    "as pointed out by grupe ( 2004 ) , eigenvector 1 correlates well with the eddington luminosity ratio @xmath2/@xmath3 .",
    "this ratio is thought to be indicative of the ` age ' of an agn  agns with a higher eddington luminosity ratio are at the onset of an agn phase .",
    "important clues can therefore be gathered by studying young forming qsos with massive starbursts in order to understand the physics of merging galaxies and the agn phenomenon . moreover",
    ", the co - existence of starbursts and agns provides important information about the buildup of the stellar populations in galaxies and the growth of central black holes .    as mentioned above , the fraction of objects with agn spectral characteristics is about 30% among uligs .",
    "high resolution x - ray observations by chandra and xmm - newton confirmed the existence of central agns in some uligs through the detection of @xmath4 lines , for example in ngc6240 , mrk273 , mrk231 and iras19254 - 7545 ( xia et al .",
    "2002 ; komossa et al .",
    "2003 ; franceschini et al .",
    "2003 ) . however , even for agns among uligs , the dominant energy output is probably massive starbursts , instead of a central agn engine .",
    "for example , using the co kinematic data of ir qso mrk231 , downes & solomon ( 1998 ) concluded that the central agn provides only one third of the total luminosity , with the rest contributed by starbursts .",
    "massive starbursts may dominate the energy output not only for some local ir qsos but also for high redshift massive starburst galaxies and some optically - selected qsos .",
    "a recent deep scuba survey uncovered a large population of uligs at @xmath5 ( wang et al .",
    "2004 and references therein ) . based on ultra - deep x - ray observations and deep optical spectroscopic data , alexander et al .",
    "( 2004 ) argued that about 40% of bright scuba sources host agns .",
    "however , only @xmath6 of the bolometric luminosity is contributed by agns .",
    "recently , carilli et al . (",
    "2004 ) reported that 30% of optically - selected qsos at high redshift are hyper - luminous far - infrared galaxies with @xmath7 and with dust masses @xmath8 .",
    "these qsos follow the radio to far - infrared correlation for star - forming galaxies ( carilli et al .",
    "therefore , the main energy source for the scuba detected agns and some high redshift optical qsos may also be starbursts . as the comoving luminosity density of infrared light contributed by luminous infrared galaxies at @xmath9 is more than 40 times larger than that in the local universe ( elbaz et al .",
    "2002 ) , it is important to investigate the properties of these objects in order to understand the star formation history of the universe and the number counts of agns at high redshift ( alexander et al .",
    "lessons we learn on how to determine the dominant energy output mechanism for local ir qsos will provide clues to understanding the nature of agns at higher redshifts and the processes involved in galaxy formation and evolution .    in this paper , we perform statistical analyses for ir qsos and compare their properties with those of pg qsos and narrow - line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in  2 , we describe how the ir qso , pg qso and nls1 samples are compiled . in  3 , we discuss the data reduction and how we estimate different physical parameters .",
    "the statistical correlations are studied in  4 .",
    "finally , in  5 , we summarize and discuss our results . throughout this paper",
    "we adopt a cosmology with a matter density parameter @xmath10 , a cosmological constant @xmath11 and a hubble constant of @xmath12 .",
    "one aim of our study is to understand the connection of star formation and accretion process to the central black hole . for this purpose , we use an infrared - selected type 1 agn sample as the star formation and agn activity are coeval in these objects . for comparison",
    ", we also compile an optically - selected qso sample and a nls1 sample , for which the infrared information is available .",
    "the details of these three samples are given below :    1 .",
    "the infrared - selected type 1 agn ( ir qso ) sample is primarily from zheng et al .",
    "this sample was compiled from the uligs in the qdot redshift survey ( lawrence et al .",
    "1999 ) , the 1@xmath13jy ulig survey ( kim & sanders 1998 ) , and an ir qso sample obtained by a cross - correlation study of the iras point - source catalog with the rosat all - sky survey catalog .",
    "all the ir qsos selected by zheng et al .",
    "are uligs with mid - infrared to far - infrared properties from iras observations .",
    "these galaxies include most of the transition qsos defined by canalizo & stockton ( 2001 ) .",
    "furthermore , they have also been carefully investigated by zheng et al . with optical spectra ; they concluded that these objects are in transition from uligs to classical qsos or from mergers to elliptical galaxies through a qso phase .",
    "we added three ir qsos to the sample obtained from the cross - correlation of the largest iras redshift survey ( pscz ) and the rosat archive by xia et al .",
    "( 2001 ) . in total",
    ", we have 28 objects , all of which are in the northern sky ( @xmath14 ) and they constitute about one third of all the ir qsos identified using pscz , hence it should be a representative sample of ir qsos .",
    "the optically - selected qso sample comprises 57 pg qsos from the bg92 sample . for 51 of these",
    ", their infrared information were taken from haas et al .",
    "we added six additional objects obtained by a cross - correlation of 87 pg qsos in bg92 and the iras faint source catalog .",
    "a nls1 sample was taken from wang & lu ( 2001 ) with available iras flux densities from the ned database .",
    "this sample is a heterogeneous sample compiled and observed spectroscopically by veron - cetty et al .",
    "the sample consists of 39 objects , two of which overlap with the ir qso sample and eight overlap with the pg qso sample .",
    "in addition , the @xmath15 estimation is not available for one of them ( ms15198@xmath160633 ) , so we excluded this object from the nls1 sample , leaving a total of 28 objects .",
    "one complication we already alluded to is that there are overlapping objects among the three samples . for later statistical analyses , we re -",
    "group them as follows : ( 1 ) the overlapping objects between the ir qso and pg qso samples are classified in the ir qso sample .",
    "furthermore , three pg qsos ( pg0050@xmath17124 , pg1543@xmath17489 and pg1700@xmath17518 ) are re - classified as ir qsos following canalizo & stockton ( 2001 ) who defined these as in transition from uligs to classical qsos .",
    "( 2 ) the original pg qso sample was selected optically , regardless of the fwhm of h@xmath18 emission line .",
    "in fact , some of the pg qsos have fwhm of h@xmath18 less than 2000kms@xmath19 , satisfying the criteria of nls1s .",
    "we will therefore put these objects into the nls1 sample .",
    "after this exercise , the numbers of objects in the ir qso , pg qso and nls1 samples are 31 , 41 and 38 , respectively .    one criterion of our sample selection is that the objects must have infrared flux or luminosity information . as the infrared information is not as readily available as the optical information , all the three samples used here are somewhat incomplete .",
    "however , they are representative of ir qsos , optically - selected classical qsos and nls1s in the local universe . furthermore ,",
    "as discussed in  1 , there are optical spectroscopic similarities between ir qsos and nls1s and possible evolutionary connections between ir qsos and optically - selected qsos ( sanders et al . 1988a ) .",
    "therefore , these three samples , while incomplete , will allow us to explore the physical relations among these three classes of objects .",
    "in this section , we briefly discuss the data reduction and describe how we determine the physical parameters of agns , including their black hole masses , infrared and optical luminosities , h@xmath18 luminosities , star formation rates and accretion rates .",
    "all the parameters are listed in table 1 .",
    "the method used to estimate a black hole mass is based on the assumption that the motion of the gas moving around the black hole is dominated by the gravitational force and the broad emission line region ( blr ) gas is virialized ( see peterson & wandel 1999 , 2000 for evidence ) .",
    "hence the central black hole mass can be estimated using the blr radius and velocity of the blr gas , i.e. , @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gravitational constant .",
    "the size of the blr ( @xmath22 ) can be estimated from the empirical relationship between the size and the monochromatic continuum luminosity at 5100 .",
    "this relation was first found by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) for a sample of 17 seyfert 1 galaxies and 17 pg qsos in a cosmology with @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "the relation was refitted in our adopted cosmology by mclure & jarvis ( 2002 ) @xmath26^{(0.61\\pm0.10 ) } \\mbox{lt - days}.\\ ] ] the velocity @xmath27 can be estimated from the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) of the h@xmath18 broad emission line @xmath28 , by assuming that the blr gas is in isotropic motions .",
    "therefore , two measurements are needed to determine the black hole mass : the luminosity at 5100  and the fwhm of h@xmath18 .",
    "we obtained the fwhm of h@xmath18 from zheng et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for 25 out of the 28 ir qsos .",
    "for the remaining three ir qsos ( irasf01348@xmath173254 , iras03335@xmath174729 and irasf04505@xmath162958 ) , we observed them and reduced the spectra in the same manner as described by zheng et al .",
    "notice that the fwhm of h@xmath18 was estimated in the same way as in bg92 .",
    "the continuum flux densities at 5100  were measured directly from our spectra .",
    "the uncertainties of the black hole mass were estimated by error propagation using the uncertainties of the flux density and the fwhm of h@xmath18 measurements given by zheng et al .",
    "the mean error of the black hole mass is 0.13dex .",
    "this is a lower limit as the uncertainties of fwhm of h@xmath18 given by zheng et al .",
    "are probably under - estimated ( cf .",
    "shemmer et al .",
    "2004 ) and there exists other sources of systematic errors ( see wang & lu 2001 for more detailed discussions ) . generally , the black hole mass derived in this way is accurate within a factor of 2@xmath163 ( e.g. , wang & lu 2001 ; marziani et al .",
    "2003 , and references therein ; shemmer et al .",
    "2004 ) .    for the 57 pg qsos in our sample ,",
    "the fwhm of h@xmath18 measurements were from bg92 .",
    "the continuum flux densities at 5100  were taken from the spectrophotometry by neugebauer et al .",
    "specifically , the flux densities at 5100  were estimated by a linear interpolation over the neighboring frequency range .",
    "for the 28 nls1s , we used the blr sizes listed by wang & lu ( 2001 ) to calculate the monochromatic luminosity at 5100   using the @xmath29 relation given by kaspi et al .",
    "( 2000 ) , then used eq .",
    "( [ eq : rblr ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : mbh ] ) to derive the black hole masses from the h@xmath18 fwhm and monochromatic luminosity at 5100 . in this process",
    ", we carefully accounted for the difference in the adopted cosmology ( wang & lu 2001 used a cosmology with @xmath30 , @xmath31 and @xmath25 ) .",
    "for all the sample objects except the 51 pg qsos , we calculated their infrared luminosities following sanders & mirabel ( 1996 ) based on the flux densities from the iras faint source catalog : @xmath32 where @xmath33 is the luminosity distance , and @xmath34 is defined as @xmath35 with @xmath36 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 being the iras flux densities at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100@xmath40 in units of jy .",
    "notice that three ir qsos ( iras06269@xmath160543 , iras11598@xmath160112 and iras03335@xmath174729 ) were not in the iras faint source catalog , so we obtained their flux densities from the iras point source catalog .",
    "the typical uncertainty of infrared luminosities is about 0.06 dex .",

( 2003 ) .",

    "the average difference of the infrared luminosities measured from the iras faint source catalog and table 2 of haas et al .",

    "monochromatic luminosities ( @xmath45 ) at @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 were also calculated .",
    "the flux densities in the four bands of the 51 pg qsos were derived from table 1 of haas et al .",

    "for most objects observed by both iras and iso , the difference of the flux densities at @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 is within 30% .",
    "however , the difference of flux densities at @xmath49 is larger than 30% for half of the objects .",
    "this could be due to the large iras beam of about 3@xmath50 which may enclose cirrus contaminations in the flux determinations ( haas et al .",
    "the difference of flux densities at @xmath46 , @xmath47 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 are 0.072dex , 0.021dex , 0.002dex and 0.225dex , respectively .",
    "however , the larger errors at @xmath49 should not statistically affect our results that are mainly based on the flux densities at @xmath48 .",
    "note that no k - correction is applied to any of the monochromatic or integrated infrared luminosities .",
    "we estimated the k - correction by assuming our objects follow the spectral energy distribution of either luminous infrared agns or infrared starburst galaxies from xu et al .",
    "we calculated the k - correction from @xmath51 to @xmath52 and found that the largest k - correction occurs for a starburst galaxy at @xmath52 . even in this case , the k - correction is smaller than 0.25dex for the monochromatic luminosity at @xmath47 .",
    "as all our sample objects have redshifts smaller than 0.5 and many of them have spectral energy distributions similar to agns , the k - correction is much smaller than 0.25dex .",
    "hence our results are not affected significantly by k - corrections .",

    "the median values of the eddington ratio are about 1.7 for ir qsos and 1.3 for nls1s , respectively .",
    "more than half of the ir qsos and nls1s have @xmath77 , implying that the accretion in these systems may not be spherically symmetric ( collin et al .",
    "2002 ; wang 2003 ) . on the other hand , most pg qsos have eddington ratios smaller than one with a median value of about 0.2 , much smaller than those of ir qsos and nls1s . as mentioned earlier , ir qsos and nls1s have similar optical spectroscopic properties , and they lie at one extreme end of the first principal component defined by bg92 ( zheng et al . 2002 ) .",
    "this component has been suggested to correlate with @xmath76 ( e.g. , bg92 ; shemmer & netzer 2002 ) .",
    "therefore the spectroscopic similarities between ir qsos and nls1s may be due to the fact that both classes of objects have a high eddington ratio .",

    "the median black hole masses are @xmath78 , @xmath79 and @xmath80 for ir qsos , pg qsos and nls1s , respectively .",
    "in addition , the distribution of black hole mass of ir qsos is broader than those of pg qsos and nls1s , which can be explained if the black hole masses of ir qsos are still increasing and have not yet reached a stable value .",

    "statistically , ir qsos have lower @xmath84 values and hence lower dust temperature compared with optically - selected qsos and nls1s . as the dust heated by agns tends to have higher temperatures , this suggests that starbursts are important for heating the dust in ir qsos .",

    "( [ eq : sfrmdot ] ) and ( [ eq : sfrm ] ) provide important clues about how the star formation rate and the growth of black holes are connected in violent merging galaxies .",
    "we return to this important point in the discussion (  5.1 ) .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the statistical properties of ir qsos , pg qsos and nls1s from the optical to the infrared .",
    "our results reveal that these three classes of objects have distinct properties in the infrared .",
    "starbursts play a main role in the infrared excess , especially the far - infrared excess , in ir qsos .",
    "our study also reveals a correlation between the star formation rate and the accretion rate onto central black holes during galaxy merging and massive starbursts .",
    "this implies that the accretion - driven growth of central black holes is correlated with the formation of young stellar population .",
    "this has important implications for the origin of the tight correlation between the stellar mass of the hot component of galaxies with the central black hole masses . in the following we discuss these issues in more detail .      in the last few years , it has become increasingly clear that the star formation and agn activity must be correlated as there are tight correlations between the black hole mass , galactic velocity dispersion ( e.g. ferrarese & merritt 2000 ) and the mass or luminosity of the hot stellar component of the host galaxy ( e.g. kormendy & gebhardt 2001 ; magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ; laor 1998 ) .",
    "it is unclear how the correlations arise .    by studying a large sample of narrow emission line galaxies from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) , heckman et al .",
    "( 2004 ; see also kauffmann & heckman 2004 ) found that the host galaxies of bright agns have a much younger mean stellar age and quite a large fraction of these host galaxies have experienced recent starbursts .",
    "more importantly , they found that the volume averaged ratio of the star formation rate to the black hole accretion rate is about 1000 for bulge - dominated galaxies .",
    "this value is in agreement with the ratio of the bulge mass to the black hole mass empirically derived ( marconi & hunt 2003 ) .",
    "notice that their results are based on 23000 narrow emission - line galaxies which excludes type 1 agns . in their study ,",
    "the black hole mass covers more than two orders of magnitude .",
    "our study , on the other hand , is based on only a few tens of infrared - selected type 1 agns .",
    "but these objects are experiencing both massive starbursts and rapid black hole growth due to accretions at the same time , and so we probe the same correlation but in more extreme environments .    at this transitional stage from massive starburst to classical qso , the average ratio of star formation rate to black hole accretion rate @xmath90 is also a few hundred as shown in eq .",
    "( [ eq : sfrmdot ] ) . comparing fig .",
    "[ ir.sbsfrmdot.mbh.eps ] with figure 11 in kauffmann & heckman ( 2004 ) , both the slope and zero - points of the fitted lines are similar .",
    "it is intriguing that @xmath91 is not constant , but declines with the black hole mass ; the same trend was found in kauffmann & heckman ( 2004 ) .    on the other hand ,",
    "as we emphasized in  4.2 , the infrared emission , even the far - infrared emission , for optically - selected qsos and nls1s are not from the star formation , but mainly from dust heated by central agns . for these objects",
    ", the accretion process is still powering the agn s emission , but there is no longer substantial star formation .",
    "the picture we obtained here is consistent with the recent simulation result by springel et al .",
    "( 2004 ) that the starburst and agn activity are coeval , but the time durations are different as a result of the detailed form of the response of the gas to the feedback processes .    the number density of uligs and classical qsos are comparable in the local universe ( sanders et al .",
    "1988a , 1988b ; canalizo & stockton 2001 ) .",
    "the fraction of ir qsos is less than 10% of uligs , hence the number density of ir qsos in the local universe is at most 10% of classical qsos .",
    "if the number density of objects is simply related to the time scale of different phases , then the time scale for ir qsos will be roughly 10% of that of classical qsos ( about a few times @xmath92 years , e.g. , marconi et al .",
    "the ir qso phase may therefore last only a few times @xmath93 years .",
    "the co - moving number density of uligs is likely much higher at higher redshift .",
    "for example , elbaz et al .",
    "( 2002 ) found that the comoving number density of uligs is several tens times higher at @xmath9 than that in the local universe .",
    "correspondingly , the co - moving number density of ir qsos can be higher by the same factor , i.e. , the co - existing massive starbursts and rapid accretions onto black holes may be much more common at higher redshift .",
    "an investigation into the evolution of the co - moving number density of ir qsos with redshift will provide valuable information for the formation of spheroidals and agns .      based on an analysis for 64 pg qsos from the infrared to the x - ray , haas et al .",
    "( 2003 ) concluded that the central agn is the dominant energy source for all emissions of pg qsos .",
    "even for the far - infrared emission , the central agn is still the main source of heating on the dust tori .",
    "if the dust torus is clumpy , then the central agn emission can travel through the gaps farther out and provide the observed far - infrared emission reradiated from cooler outer regions .",
    "therefore for pg qsos , starbursts play a minor role . in this paper",
    ", we showed that nls1s and pg qsos also satisfy the same correlations and central agns may be the dominant sources from the optical to the far - infrared , even for some pg qsos with @xmath94 .",
    "the ir qsos , pg qsos and nls1s follow the same correlation between the h@xmath18 luminosity and the optical continuum luminosity ( see fig .  [ lhblirlop.eps]a and table 2 ) .",
    "this implies that for all sample objects , regardless of whether they are optically - selected or infrared - selected , their optical luminosity measures the central agn s power . in all the other correlations ,",
    "the ir qsos are significantly different from the pg qsos and nls1s , which is a direct result of the far - infrared excess in ir qsos .",
    "we showed that this infrared excess is from starbursts , as can be most clearly seen from the larger values of @xmath70 and smaller values of @xmath81 ( see fig .",
    "[ alpha.lirlbol.eps ] ) . for most ir qsos starbursts",
    "play a significant , even dominating , role in their energy output .",
    "we conclude that the infrared excess can serve as an efficient criterion to disentangle the relative energy contributions of agns and starbursts .",
    "the optical spectra of ir qsos and nls1s are quite similar , both of which have strong or extremely strong optical  emission and weak [ ] @xmath954959,5007  emission .",
    "they are located at one extreme end of the eigenvector 1 of bg92 .",
    "it is widely accepted that the eigenvector 1 is closely correlated with the eddington ratio ( @xmath75 ) ; a large eddington ratio is interpreted as the agn being at the early stage of an agn phase , i.e. , having a young ` age ' ( grupe 2004 ) . as both ir qsos and nls1s",
    "have high eddington ratios ( see left panels of fig .  [ his2panel2.eps ] ) , it follows that both classes of objects are young agns in their early stage of evolution .",
    "however , in all the analyses performed in section 4 , nls1s and pg qsos have similar correlations .",
    "the differences between them are their black hole masses and the eddington ratios . on the other hand , ir qsos and nls1s are different except that both have high eddington ratios .",
    "the difference between ir qsos and nls1s is also underlined by their host galaxies .",
    "it appears that the host galaxies of ir qsos are merging galaxies while the host galaxies of nls1s are barred spirals ( crenshaw et al .",
    "more importantly , ir qsos are undergoing massive starbursts which produce the infrared excess in these objects .",
    "the co - existing massive starbursts and high black hole accretion rate in ir qsos will lead to the rapid growth of black holes and ir qsos will rapidly evolve to classical qsos hosted by elliptical galaxies .",
    "while nls1s have high eddington accretion ratios , the accretion rates @xmath59 are in fact much smaller than those of ir qsos ( see fig .",
    "[ l4band.lop.eps]c ) , therefore , the final black hole for these objects will be smaller , and their evolution destination may be seyfert 1s , rather than qsos .",
    "this is also consistent with the bulge and black hole mass relation  the bulge mass of spiral galaxies is smaller than those in elliptical galaxies , and so nls1s will end as seyfert 1 s with smaller black holes and hosted by spiral galaxies .",
    "our analyses provide hints about the physical connections between different classes of agns",
    ". it will be important in the future to quantify how agns evolve in the multiple - dimensional space of accretion rate , black hole mass , host galaxies etc .",

    "<S> we study the properties of infrared - selected qsos ( ir qsos ) , optically - selected qsos ( pg qsos ) and narrow line seyfert 1 galaxies ( nls1s ) . </S>",
    "<S> we compare their properties from the infrared to the optical and examine various correlations among the black hole mass , accretion rate , star formation rate and optical and infrared luminosities . </S>",
    "<S> we find that the infrared excess in ir qsos is mostly in the far infrared , and their infrared spectral indices suggest that the excess emission is from low temperature dust heated by starbursts rather than agns . </S>",
    "<S> the infrared excess is therefore a useful criterion to separate the relative contributions of starbursts and agns . </S>",
    "<S> we further find a tight correlation between the star formation rate and the accretion rate of central agns for ir qsos . </S>",
    "<S> the ratio of the star formation rate and the accretion rate is about several hundred for ir qsos , but decreases with the central black hole mass . </S>",
    "<S> this shows that the tight correlation between the stellar mass and the central black hole mass is preserved in massive starbursts during violent mergers . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest that the higher eddington ratios of nls1s and ir qsos imply that they are in the early stage of evolution toward classical seyfert 1 s and qsos , respectively . </S>"
