    "the basic problem of a two - level system coupled to an oscillatory perturbation arose in the early on in quantum mechanics in association with studies of spin dynamics in a magnetic field @xcite .",
    "the closely related problem of a two - level coupled to a simple harmonic oscillator has been of interest for more than 30 years , at least since the work of cohen - tannoudji et al @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for this problem can be written as    @xmath0    where we can write the spin operators @xmath1 in terms of the pauli matrices as    @xmath2    this model has been of interest recently in problems in which atoms interact with strong electromagnetic fields .",
    "we have become interested in this problem since it can exhibit coherent energy coupling between systems with characteristic energies that are very different . the multiphoton regime",
    "in which @xmath3 in this regard is of interest to us .",
    "additionally , our focus has been on the large @xmath4 limit .",
    "it is well known that the dipolar interaction between photons and atoms causes the frequency of the atom to get shifted .",
    "the associated shift has been termed the bloch - siegert shift in the literature @xcite .",
    "a general analytic expression for the @xmath5th resonance has been known for some time @xcite .",
    "measurements of this shift have been reported recently up to @xmath6 @xcite .",
    "various theoretical methods have been used to understand these results @xcite .",
    "we have recently found a unitary transformation that separates the problem into three parts , each of which is relatively complicated . in the multiphoton regime",
    "we view the largest of these as an `` unperturbed '' dressed hamiltonian , which we have found give energy eigenvalues that are close to those of the original problem away from the level anticrossings . in the present work ,",
    "our attention is drawn to this aspect of the problem . using this approach , we are able to develop a reasonably good estimate of the bloch - siegert shift using a simple variational approximation , one which we can compare with results obtained using other methods .",
    "as mentioned above , we have found it helpful to work in a rotated frame . instead of considering the hamiltonian in equation  ( [ eq : basichamiltonian ] )",
    ", we consider the unitary equivalent hamiltonian    @xmath7    where @xmath8 is    @xmath9    the operator @xmath8 depends explicitly on @xmath10 .",
    "this rotation can be carried out explicitly , leading to a complicated expression .",
    "it is useful to write the rotated hamiltonian in the form    @xmath11    where we have defined @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 according to    @xmath15    @xmath16 ^ 2   } \\right ] ( \\hat{a}-\\hat{a}^\\dagger ) + ( \\hat{a}-\\hat{a}^\\dagger ) \\left [ { \\displaystyle {   u",
    "\\over \\delta e }   \\over 1 +    \\left [ \\displaystyle { 2 u   ( \\hat{a}+\\hat{a}^\\dagger ) \\over \\delta e } \\right ] ^2   } \\right ] \\right \\rbrace \\left ( { 2\\hat{s}_y \\over \\hbar } \\right ) \\ ] ]    @xmath17 ^ 2   }   \\right \\rbrace^2\\ ] ]    even though this rotated hamiltonian is much more complicated than the one we started out with , we have found that it has useful properties that are of interest .",
    "for example , from numerical calculations and also from the wkb approximation , we have found that the `` unperturbed '' part of the hamiltonian @xmath12 is a good approximation to the initial hamiltonian @xmath18 away from level anticrossings .",
    "the `` perturbation '' @xmath13 contains the part of the hamiltonian that is most responsible for level splitting at the anti - crossing ( as we will discuss elsewhere ) .",
    "finally , the remaining term @xmath14 gives rise to a minor correction to @xmath12 .",
    "to illustrate the usefulness of this rotation , we focus on one issue in particular : the development of an interesting approximation for the energy eigenvalues . for this , we need focus only on @xmath12 .",
    "consider the time - independent schrdinger equation for the `` unperturbed '' part of the rotated problem    @xmath19    because @xmath12 is somewhat complicated , it is not straightforward to develop exact analytic solutions .",
    "we have used numerical solutions to develop some understanding of the eigenfunctions and associated eigenvalues . from these numerical studies ,",
    "it has become clear that there exists a useful analytic approximation .",
    "we adopt an approximate solution of the form    @xmath20    where @xmath21 is a pure sho eigenstate , and @xmath22 is a spin function . the variational estimate for the energy eigenvalue in this approximation",
    "is    @xmath23    this approximate energy can be evaluated explicitly to give    @xmath24    this result is interesting in that it leads directly to a simple interpretation of the system in terms of a dressed two - level system and unperturbed oscillator , which is reasonably good away from the level anticrossings . moreover , the dressed two - level system energy is involved in the calculation of the bloch - siegert shift in the literature .",
    "let us write the variational energy as    @xmath25    where we define @xmath26 according to    @xmath27    and @xmath28 as    @xmath29    this approximation is very good , as can be seen in figure  [ fig32x1 ] where the approximation is plotted along with the exact numerical results .",
    "the bloch - siegert resonance condition can be written in terms of @xmath28 as    @xmath30    = 4.00 in = 2.50 in    [ t ]    it is possible to develop a simpler approximation for this approximate dressed energy based on the wkb approximation .",
    "we may write    @xmath31    with @xmath32 .",
    "results from this approximation can also not be distinguished from the exact results if plotted as done previously in figure 1 .",
    "as the results available in the literature of interest here are given for small @xmath26 , we require a power series expansion of equation ( [ approximation ] ) :    @xmath33\\ ] ]    to compare to the exact expression obtained by ahmad and bullough@xcite , we write the resonance condition using their notation as    @xmath34\\ ] ]    we translate this into our notation to obtain    @xmath35\\ ] ]    keeping in mind the resonance condition [ equation ( [ eq : resonancecondition ] ) ] , this is consistent with    @xmath36\\ ] ]    where    @xmath37    @xmath38 we can now see that in the large @xmath39 limit , equation  ( [ eq : ahmadbullough ] ) reduces to our result .",
    "it should also be noted that the deviations for finite @xmath39 are @xmath40 .",
    "another approximate multiphoton result is given by ostrovsky and horsdal - pedersen@xcite .",
    "this result ( written in their notation ) for the bloch - siegert shift is    @xmath41    this result is equivalent to our result [ equation ( [ eq : seriesexpansion ] ) ] to fourth order in @xmath26 .",
    "the unitary equivalent hamiltonian provides a simple way to understand the bloch - siegert shift .",
    "we have found in our work that the unperturbed part of the rotated hamiltonian ( @xmath12 ) produces a reasonably accurate estimate of the dressed two - level system energy in the large @xmath4 limit away from the level anticrossings . in the discussion presented here",
    ", we have shown that a simple variational estimate for the energy associated with @xmath12 in the rotated frame produces good results away from the level anticrossings over a wide range of the dimensionless coupling strength @xmath26 .",
    "the approximation is found to be in agreement with previous work in the limit that @xmath26 is small .",
