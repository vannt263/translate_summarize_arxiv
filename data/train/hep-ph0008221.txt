    "in the last few years , evaluations of the crystal barrel @xmath4-annihilation data set provided a lot of new meson resonances in the mass region @xmath5 mev @xcite .",
    "the experiment was performed with the crystal barrel detector at lear where antiproton - proton annihilation into @xmath6 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 , @xmath9 , @xmath10 and @xmath11 has been studied up to an incident beam momentum of @xmath12 gev/@xmath13 .    from a theoretical point of view ,",
    "higher excitation resonances in the meson mass spectrum are of great interest because they reflect the underlying confinement structure at the quark level . however , from first qcd principles especially the spinorial dirac structure of the confinement is largely unknown .",
    "therefore a phenomenological study of different dirac structures in a fully relativistic framework seems worthwhile . from earlier works",
    "@xcite it is known that a linearly rising confinement potential with a dirac structure of the form @xmath14 provides a very good description of the regge trajectories up to total angular momentum @xmath15 .",
    "however , the suitability of a confinement parameterization should not only be linked to the bulk of experimental ground state masses in each channel but also to their corresponding radial excitations .",
    "for that , a multitude of well established higher resonances has to be known .",
    "unfortunately this is not the case so far , although especially during the last two years the situation has improved .",
    "for instance , while the particle data group 98 ( pdg 98 @xcite ) did not list any radial excitations for the isovector states @xmath16 , @xmath17",
    ", @xmath18 and @xmath19 , in their latest issue ( pdg 00 @xcite ) they state three new such resonances : the vector meson @xmath20 observed by the authors in @xcite ( a similar resonance , the @xmath21 , is stated in @xcite ) , and two tensor mesons , the @xmath22 @xcite and the @xmath23 @xcite . furthermore a lot of resonances have been found in the last few years , which do not appear in the latest pdg - listing .",
    "for example : @xmath24 @xcite , @xmath25 @xcite , @xmath26 @xcite , @xmath27 @xcite , @xmath28 @xcite , @xmath29 @xcite , @xmath30 @xcite , @xmath31 @xcite , @xmath32 @xcite , @xmath33 @xcite .",
    "we compare these new experimental resonance positions with the eigenvalue spectrum calculated with the dirac structure @xmath34 ( model @xmath35 ) on the one hand and the structure @xmath36 ( model @xmath37 ) on the other hand . whereas the first structure produces excitation masses which overestimate the corresponding experimental masses up to 400 mev , the second structure yields a remarkably good agreement with the newly observed resonances . here , deviations are in general less than 100 mev . furthermore , in model @xmath37 the squared masses of the resonances",
    "show , in contrast to model @xmath35 , a linear dependence on their radial excitation number , @xmath38 , very similar to the behaviour of many experimental resonances recently observed by a. v. anisovich , v. v. anisovich and a. v. sarantsev @xcite .",
    "it turned out that the comparatively strong coupling of positive and negative energy components of the salpeter amplitudes in model @xmath37 is responsible for this desired lowering of the excited meson masses .",
    "we will illustrate this effect by carrying out the nonrelativistic reduction of the full salpeter equation for both models .",
    "whereas even in this limit the above mentioned coupling does not vanish for model @xmath37 , this reduction provides the usual schrdinger equation for model @xmath35 , _",
    "i.e. _ the complete decoupling of positive and negative energy components",
    ". indeed , model @xmath35 reduces in this limit to a particular version of the nonrelativistic quark model ( nrqm ) that provides a satisfactory description of both meson and baryon ground state masses @xcite . of course ,",
    "due to the absence of the negative energy components , the nrqm in @xcite fails for higher resonances as does the often cited model of godfrey and isgur @xcite .",
    "the relativistic salpeter framework presented here contains _ a priori _ all small desired spin - orbit terms in order to describe the small mass splittings between states that can be attributed to the same orbital angular momentum multiplets .",
    "examples are @xmath39 and @xmath40 , @xmath41 and @xmath42 and @xmath43 and @xmath44 .",
    "one should emphasize that the low positions of the @xmath45 and @xmath46 can not be explained by these intrinsic spin - orbit terms alone . in order to describe these splittings",
    "an additional residual interaction has to be adopted .",
    "we will use an instanton induced effective quark interaction discovered by t hooft @xcite , which also accounts for the correct vector - pseudoscalar and @xmath47-@xmath48-@xmath49-@xmath50 mass splitting . whereas in the nonrelativistic model @xcite",
    "this interaction only acts for pseudoscalar mesons , in the fully relativistic salpeter model @xcite it also acts in the scalar sector and provides a possible interpretation of the still unknown scalar ground state nonet @xcite .",
    "however , as we will see this interpretation strongly depends on details of the confinement force , in particular on whether the used dirac structure induces additional spin - orbit forces or not .",
    "in fact , as the dirac structure @xmath51 generates such additional spin - orbit terms , model @xmath37 provides a completely different result for the scalar mass spectrum compared to the earlier computations in model @xmath35 which produced an almost flavour singlet @xmath52-state at approximately 1 gev and the flavour octet states @xmath52 , @xmath53 , @xmath54 in a mass region around 1.4 gev ( see @xcite ) : in model @xmath37 , the calculated scalar ground state masses ( and also their radial excitations ) are roughly 200300 mev lighter .",
    "moreover , they show a remarkable agreement with a lot of k - matrix - poles deduced by v. v. anisovich and coworkers @xcite from experiment .",
    "this paper is organized as follows : in section ii we briefly comment on the bethe - salpeter equation for a quark - antiquark bound state and display the approximations ( instantaneous approximation , free quark propagators ) that lead to the salpeter equation , which constitutes the basic equation of our model .",
    "section iii is devoted to an extensive discussion of the effects of the model interactions adopted on the description of the experimental mass spectrum : in part a , focusing on the confinement force alone , we compare the resulting bound state masses of model @xmath35 and model @xmath37 to the complete @xmath55 mass spectrum and especially to the recently observed higher resonances quoted above . the nonrelativistic reduction of both models is presented in part b of section iii , where we also define the positive and negative energy components of the salpeter amplitude . a brief discussion concerning spin - orbit effects in both models is given in part c. in the last part of section iii , we focus on the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons by adding the residual t hooft interaction which only acts for mesons with vanishing total angular momentum .",
    "there we will also comment on a set of k - matrix poles found by v. v. anisovich and coworkers @xcite by comparing to our results .",
    "finally we give a summary and conclusion in section iv .",
    "in quantum field theory a quark - antiquark bound state with four - momentum @xmath56 and mass @xmath57 , @xmath58 , is described by the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation for two fermions @xcite . in momentum space , this equation reads : @xmath59 s_2^f(-\\frac{p}{2}+p ) , \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath60 is the relative four - momentum between the quark and the antiquark , @xmath47 denotes the infinite sum of their irreducible interactions and the corresponding full feynman propagators are labeled by @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively . the bs amplitude @xmath63 is defined in coordinate space as the time - ordered product of the quark and the antiquark field operator between the bound state @xmath64 and the vacuum : @xmath65 where @xmath66 and @xmath67 are multi - indices for the dirac , flavour and colour degrees of freedom .",
    "since in general the interaction kernel @xmath47 and the full quark propagators @xmath68 are unknown quantities we make two ( formally covariant ) approximations :    * the propagators are assumed to be of the free form @xmath69 with effective constituent quark masses @xmath70 that we use as free parameters in our model . * it is assumed that the interaction kernel only depends on the components of @xmath60 and @xmath71 perpendicular to @xmath56 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath72 with @xmath73 ( instantaneous approximation ) .    integrating in the bound state rest frame over the time component @xmath74 and introducing the equal - time ( or salpeter ) amplitude",
    "@xmath75 we end up with the salpeter equation  @xcite , which constitutes the basic equation of our model : @xmath76     \\gamma ^0\\lambda _ 2^+ ( -\\vec p)\\nonumber \\\\    & & -\\ : \\lambda_1^+(\\vec p ) \\gamma",

    "( [ eq : se ] ) with an adequate potential ansatz ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the global structure of the experimental mass spectrum reflects a linearly rising confinement force which not only produces the regge trajectories @xmath80 but also the energy mass gaps between the radial excitation states .",
    "furthermore , the confinement force should be flavour symmetric because one finds for every isovector state an energetically degenerate isoscalar partner in the experimental mass spectrum .",
    "the best known example is of course @xmath81 and @xmath82 , but also @xmath83 and @xmath84 and many other pairs , up to @xmath85 and @xmath86 .",
    "the pseudoscalar mesons @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 exhibit a mass splitting which is of course not compatible with this rule ; therefore one has to introduce a flavour dependent residual interaction in order to get an appropriate description for these mesons .",
    "we will use the instanton induced effective quark interaction discovered by t hooft @xcite which in the present formulation acts for mesons with vanishing total angular momentum ( @xmath87 ) only . in part",
    "a of this section , we will focus on the confinement force alone and compare the resulting bound state masses of model @xmath35 and model @xmath37 to the corresponding experimental resonances with @xmath55 . presenting the nonrelativistic reduction of both models in part b and discussing spin - orbit effects in part c",
    ", the residual t hooft interaction will be added in part d in order to cover the pseudoscalar and scalar mesons .      in this subsection , we will discuss two different versions for the confinement force .",
    "these two models differ by their dirac structures @xmath88 whereas the coordinate space dependence is chosen to be linear in both parameterizations : @xmath89 here @xmath90 is the fourier transform of the linearly rising potential @xmath91 ; the confinement offset @xmath92 and its slope @xmath93 are free parameters of our model .",
    "so , for given dirac structure and constituent quark masses in a physically reasonable range ( @xmath94 mev , @xmath95 mev ) the calculation of the complete @xmath55 mass spectrum only depends on these two parameters . in order to fix them",
    ", we perform a fit to the experimental regge trajectories and , after some fine tuning of the quark masses , we end up with the parameters of model @xmath35 and model @xmath37 shown in table [ tab : parameters ] .",
    "this combination of a scalar and a timelike vector dirac structure has already been used in earlier works @xcite where a very good description of the regge trajectories @xmath80 was achieved .",
    "the complete ( @xmath55 ) spectrum up to @xmath15 with all its radial excitations up to 2.5 gev is shown in figs .",
    "( [ fig : spect0])([fig : spect05 ] ) where none of the new experimental resonances mentioned in the introduction were used in the fit but only the masses listed by the particle data group @xcite .",
    "consequently a quantitative statement concerning the quality of the higher excitation calculations is not possible on the basis of these data alone .",
    "especially , the higher radial excitations of the isovector states @xmath97 , @xmath98 or of their isoscalar partners @xmath99 , @xmath100 are not contained in @xcite .",
    "fortunately , the situation has changed illustrated by the data shown in table [ tab1 ] and table [ tab2 ] .",
    "here we have listed several new resonances which all have been found during the last few years by various groups and collaborations @xcite .",
    "a comparison of the newly observed resonances with our calculations shows that the dirac structure @xmath14 ( model @xmath35 ) produces masses that are roughly 150 - 350 mev too high compared to the experimental values . the relativized quark model of godfrey and isgur @xcite provides a similar tendency although their deviations are smaller . however",
    ", this does not exclude a quarkonium interpretation of these states around 1700 mev and 2100 mev . starting with the @xmath20 @xcite or @xmath21 @xcite as the well established 2p @xmath101 state",
    ", a @xmath3 classification is much more natural than other conceivable interpretations of these resonances : then the mass centroid of the 2p multiplets is around 1700 mev and the multiplet partners of the @xmath98 are expected nearby in mass provided that splittings due to spin - orbit and tensor forces are small even for orbital angular momentum @xmath102 ( p - wave ) and @xmath103 ( f - wave ) .",
    "indeed , the crystal barrel collaboration observed a new state , the @xmath22 , in the reaction @xmath104",
    "@xmath105 @xmath106 at 1.94 gev/@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "a similar resonance has been reported in @xcite where the authors performed a combined k - matrix analysis of the gams , crystal barrel and bnl data .",
    "in addition there is also experimental evidence for the next higher multiplet : the authors in @xcite studied the process @xmath107 in the mass range 1960 - 2410 mev and they observed a 1@xmath108 and a 2@xmath108 resonance around 2100 mev which can be identified with the @xmath25 and the @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "they also found evidence for a @xmath109 resonance at 2340 mev , ( @xmath26 ) , a @xmath110 resonance at 2260 mev , ( @xmath28 ) , and two 3@xmath108 resonances at 2070 mev and 2310 mev , ( @xmath111 and @xmath112 ) .",
    "however , as already mentioned , neither model @xmath35 nor the model of godfrey and isgur produces masses around 1700 mev and/or 2100 mev which fit to the above quantum numbers . in more detail ,",
    "model @xmath35 predicts the first radial excitation of the ( pure p - wave ) @xmath98 at 1876 mev and the second radial excitation at 2374 mev . for the first radial excitation of the @xmath113 , the model provides the dominantly f - wave state at 1879 mev _ below _ the dominantly p - wave state at 1931 mev",
    ". in the isoscalar sector",
    "( see table [ tab2 ] ) , the classification of calculated and experimental resonances is more difficult due to the doubling of states by the additional @xmath114 pair .",
    "however , the approximate flavour symmetry of the inter - quark forces suggests to expect the first nonstrange radial excitation masses of the @xmath100 and the @xmath115 also around 1700 mev and the corresponding second radial excitations around 2100 mev .",
    "the third nonstrange radial excitation of the @xmath100 should appear in a mass range of about 2300 - 2400 mev and the first nonstrange radial excitation of the @xmath116 around 2300 mev .",
    "moreover the isoscalar ground state partner of the @xmath117 should appear around 2000 mev and its first radial excitation partner around 2300 mev .",
    "in fact , the authors in @xcite found evidence for resonances with these quantum numbers .",
    "they studied the process @xmath118 for beam momenta of 600 - 1940 mev/@xmath13 , corresponding to center of mass energies 1960 - 2410 mev , and found a 1@xmath108 resonance at 2340 mev , the @xmath32 and a 4@xmath108 resonance at 2320 mev , the @xmath33 .",
    "the masses of the isoscalar partners of the @xmath117 were stated at 2000 mev , ( @xmath119 ) , and at 2280 mev , ( @xmath120 ) . as in the isovector sector , we fix the mass centroid of the 2p @xmath101 multiplet around 1700 mev assuming that the @xmath31 is the isoscalar partner of the @xmath21 . although the @xmath31 was below the accessible mass range in @xcite , the assumption above is supported by the mass degeneracy of the observed @xmath32 with its isovector partner @xmath26 .",
    "now , due to the flavour independence of the confinement interaction used in our model , the calculated isoscalars are ideally mixed and the nonstrange part of the spectrum is degenerate in mass with the corresponding isovector spectrum .",
    "therefore , also the isoscalar masses calculated in model @xmath35 are too high compared to the experimental values . + in order to fix the centroid of the 2p @xmath121 multiplet , we consider the following well established splittings of @xmath122 and @xmath114 isoscalar ground states listed by the particle data group @xcite : [ @xmath82 , @xmath123 , [ @xmath83 , @xmath124 , [ @xmath125 , @xmath126 , [ @xmath127 , @xmath128 .",
    "these mass splittings of approximately 200 - 300 mev leads to an expected centroid of the 2p @xmath114 multiplet at roughly 1950 - 2050 mev provided that the 2p @xmath101 multiplet appears around 1700 mev as discussed above .",
    "furthermore the particle data group @xcite states two isoscalar 2@xmath108 resonances , the @xmath129 and @xmath130 , which fit to this energy region such that an arrangement of one of these states into the 2p @xmath121 multiplet seems to be natural .",
    "however , the mass calculations in model @xmath35 for the strange part of the isoscalar 2@xmath108 sector provide a dominantly f - wave @xmath115 at 2148 mev and a dominantly p - wave @xmath115 at 2165 mev as can be seen in fig .",
    "( [ fig : spect0 ] ) .",
    "moreover , the model produces the first strange radial excitation state of the @xmath100 at 2129 mev .",
    "so , the strange part of the isoscalar excitation spectrum comes out too high in model @xmath35 just like the nonstrange excitation spectrum discussed above .",
    "in view of these facts , a quarkonium interpretation for the higher mass resonances seems still plausible but obviously can only be achieved with a new confinement force .      from first principles",
    "qcd hardly gives any clue on the dirac structure of confinement .",
    "consequently a phenomenological study of different dirac structures is needed .",
    "the force with @xmath14 has been found by purely phenomenological arguments . here the aim was to reproduce the global structure of the meson mass spectrum , especially the well established regge trajectories .",
    "now we focus on some symmetry properties of the strong interaction .",
    "for example the spontaneous breakdown of the approximate chiral symmetry of light flavour qcd leads to an effective theory , the well known chiral perturbation theory , which interprets the eight lightest pseudoscalar mesons as goldstone bosons and fixes their interactions by symmetry requirements ( apart from phenomenological coupling constants ) .",
    "furthermore it is believed that , due to the absence of a ninth light pseudoscalar meson , the axial @xmath132-symmetry is explicitly broken by instantons . as we implement this by using the instanton induced t hooft interaction ( see part d of this section ) it is interesting to assume a confinement force with axial @xmath132-_invariance _ in the present framework .",
    "we choose the structure @xmath133 due to the @xmath1-invariance , this structure obviously leads to parity doublets in the calculated meson spectrum if one neglects the quark mass terms in the salpeter equation ( see fig .",
    "( [ fig : m0klsp4diff ] ) ) . + the above fierz invariant combination of a scalar , pseudoscalar and vector part was also investigated by bhm _",
    "( see @xcite ) as well as by gross and milana ( see @xcite ) but , unlike the investigations presented here , without any connection to the complete experimental meson spectrum .    as figs .",
    "( [ fig : spect0])([fig : spect05 ] ) show , this dirac structure yields ground state regge trajectories @xmath80 that are as good as the corresponding results achieved with the scalar timelike vector force discussed above .",
    "however , both models differ essentially in their results for the higher mass resonances : in contrast to model @xmath35 , the calculated higher excitation masses in model @xmath37 agree remarkably well with the newly observed resonances ( see tables [ tab1 ] and [ tab2 ] ) . here , deviations are in general less than 100 mev . for instance , the first radial excitation of the @xmath98 appears at 1718 mev ( see table [ tab1 ] ) , which means a lowering of about 160 mev compared to the corresponding mass calculated in model @xmath35 ( 1876 mev ) .",
    "the second radial @xmath98-excitation appears at 2099 mev , so it is even 275 mev lighter than the corresponding mass in model @xmath35 ( 2374 mev ) , thus showing excellent agreement with the observed resonance @xmath25 @xcite . for the third radial @xmath98-excitation model @xmath37",
    "provides 2412 mev compared to 2791 mev in model @xmath35 and 2340 @xmath134 40 mev the corresponding value from experiment @xcite . as can be seen in table [ tab1 ] , not only the @xmath98-excitation masses are lowered in model @xmath37 but",
    "also all other higher isovector resonances listed there .",
    "due to the flavour independence of the confinement force , the same effect occurs in the complete nonstrange and strange isoscalar spectrum ( see table [ tab2 ] ) .    in connection with this general lowering of excitation masses in model @xmath37",
    ", we can confirm a recent observation found by a. v. anisovich , v. v. anisovich and a. v. sarantsev @xcite concerning the systematics of @xmath3 states with respect to their radial excitation number .",
    "the authors found that for given quantum numbers many mesons fit to linear trajectories as @xmath135 with @xmath136 the mass of the ground state meson ( @xmath137 ) , @xmath138 numerating the radial excitations and @xmath139 the trajectory slope parameter whose value is suggested to be in the region @xmath140 gev@xmath141 .",
    "( [ fig : mvsn1 ] ) and ( [ fig : mvsn3 ] ) show several resonance positions taken from @xcite and our corresponding calculations of model @xmath35 and model @xmath37 .",
    "as expected from the discussion of table [ tab1 ] and table [ tab2 ] , the trajectory slope @xmath139 as given in @xcite is much too flat to parameterize the calculations of model @xmath35 whereas the model @xmath37 calculations fit for many mesons to the formula in eq .",

    "( [ fig : mvsn1 ] ) ) a somewhat larger slope , namely @xmath144 gev@xmath141 and @xmath145 gev@xmath141 . then the experimental resonances @xmath146 and @xmath147 and the @xmath148 would fit much better to their corresponding trajectories . consequently , due to the higher slopes , the parameterization in eq .",
    "( [ eq : m2vsn ] ) would lead to higher mass predictions , namely @xmath149 , @xmath150 and @xmath151 , @xmath152 instead of @xmath153 , @xmath154 and @xmath155 , @xmath156 as stated in @xcite .",
    "the higher masses then would correspond to the model @xmath37 calculations @xmath157 , @xmath158 and @xmath159 , @xmath160 . + a universal trajectory fit to our mass calculations provides an average slope of @xmath161 gev@xmath141 which is roughly 14@xmath162 larger than the value @xmath140 gev@xmath141 suggested in @xcite .",
    "however , this deviation should not be overinterpreted because there is no obvious reason to demand an approximately unique slope for all trajectories . ]    in summary , the calculated excitation masses of model @xmath37 are in general roughly 150 - 350 mev lighter than the corresponding masses of model @xmath35 , hence in a much better agreement with the newly discovered experimental resonances .",
    "as we will show below , this significant mass lowering is related to the strong coupling between positive and negative energy components of the salpeter amplitude in model @xmath37 .      in this subsection",
    ", we will show that the negative energy salpeter components play an essential role for the description of higher excitation states in the meson mass spectrum .",
    "it is known from earlier works ( see _ e.g. _ @xcite ) that these components are very important in calculations of electroweak observables , especially for deeply bound states .",
    "there it has been shown that a fully relativistic treatment in the salpeter framework improves the description of many observables ( for example : pseudoscalar decay constants , two photon decay widths ) by orders of magnitude . in order to define the negative energy components of the salpeter amplitude @xmath79 , we look at the nonrelativistic reduction of the salpeter equation . this reduction of eq .",

    "one should emphasize that the above approximate decoupling for weakly bound state solutions is a consequence of the salpeter equation itself and independently from the special form of the potential operator @xmath191 in dirac space . with usual constituent quark masses of 300400 mev",
    ", one therefore can expect to find different dirac structures which all produce for example the @xmath192-meson mass around 700800 mev with the _ same _ potential parameters .",
    "however , for deeply bound states ( @xmath193 ) on the one hand and higher excitation states ( @xmath194 ) on the other hand , neglecting the negative energy components @xmath186 is no longer justified .",

    "so , one of the scalar isoscalar bare states in the mass region 1200 - 1600 mev is superfluous for the @xmath3 classification and may be connected to the lightest scalar glueball .",
    "the k - matrix solutions lead to positions of the amplitude poles in the complex mass plane whose real part may be compared to average mass values taken from the particle data group @xcite ( [ position of the real part in mev , pdg 00 @xcite ] ) : @xmath313 , [ 1415\\pm 25 , k^*_0(1430 ) ] , [ 1015\\pm 15 , f_0(980 ) ] , [ 1300\\pm 20 , f_0(1370^{+130}_{-170 } ) ] , [ 1499\\pm 8 , f_0(1500 ) ] , [ 1530^{+90}_{-250 } , f_0(1370^{+130}_{-170 } ) ] , [ 1565\\pm 30 , a_0(1450 ) ] , [ 1780\\pm 30 , f_0(1710 ) ] , [ 1820\\pm 40 , k^*_0(1950)]$ ] . ] : @xmath314    summarizing , the present fully relativistic confining quark model with t hooft s instanton induced force as residual interaction allows to generate scalar @xmath3 states , whose masses and flavour mixings essentially depend on the confinement dirac structure : the @xmath1-violating structure @xmath0 fixes the basic mass centroid of the ground state nonet at roughly 1.3 gev , which the t hooft interaction then splits into an almost pure flavour singlet @xmath52-state at roughly 1 gev and the flavour octet states @xmath52 , @xmath54 , @xmath53 in the mass region around 1.4 gev ( see @xcite for a detailed interpretation of these states ) . + in contrast , the @xmath1-invariant dirac structure @xmath2 produces the basic mass centroid of the scalar ground state nonet at about 1.0 - 1.1 gev . here",
    "the t hooft interaction lowers the dominantly flavour singlet @xmath52-state to roughly 700 mev and pushes the dominantly flavour octet @xmath52-state to approximately 1.3 gev .",
    "the lightest @xmath54-state appears at 1057 mev and its decay properties are compatible with a @xmath3 interpretation of the @xmath45 .",
    "the lightest scalar kaon appears roughly 200 mev lower than the corresponding pdg - resonance @xmath261 @xcite .",
    "however , as the model presented here does not take into account any effects of decay - channel couplings on the meson masses , we followed a suggestion of v. v. anisovich and coworkers @xcite , not to identify our calculations with the real observed resonances but with the k - matrix poles deduced from appropriate data sets .",
    "this assignment then not only fits to the calculated members of the ground state scalar nonet but also to their first radial excitation states in confinement model @xmath37 .",
    "within the framework of a relativistic quark model based on the instantaneous bethe - salpeter equation , we have studied two different dirac structures for a linearly rising confinement potential with respect to the complete meson spectrum .",
    "it was shown that an @xmath1-invariant structure of the form @xmath2 ( model @xmath37 ) provides an excellent description of the experimentally well established regge trajectories just as the scalar time - like vector combination @xmath0 ( model @xmath35 ) which has been used in earlier works . however , since the corresponding radial excitation spectra were found to be very different in both models we extended the comparison with the experimental data to a multitude of new resonances in the mass region 10002400 mev observed in the crystal barrel @xmath315-annihilation data during the last few years .",
    "whereas the model calculations done with the structure @xmath0 overestimate these new data by roughly 150350 mev , the combination @xmath2 produces masses in remarkably good agreement with the newly observed resonances . here",
    "the deviation is in general less than 100 mev .",
    "furthermore , the squared masses of the excited states in model @xmath37 show for given quantum numbers , in contrast to model @xmath35 , a linear dependence on their radial excitation number , @xmath38 , very similar to the behaviour of many experimental resonances recently observed by a. v. anisovich , v. v. anisovich and a. v. sarantsev @xcite .",
    "we thus can now relate this observation to the quark - antiquark confinement dynamics in the framework of a constituent quark model .",
    "we found that the lowering of radial excited states in model @xmath37 is a direct consequence of the strong coupling between positive and negative salpeter energy components due to the @xmath316- and @xmath317-part in the structure @xmath2 .",
    "this effect was illustrated by carrying out the nonrelativistic reduction of both dirac structures and it turned out that the salpeter equation in model @xmath35 reduces to the usual schrdinger equation whereas in model @xmath37 the negative energy components do not vanish even in this limit . by virtue of these observations",
    "one can conclude that any quark model should account for the correct treatment of relativistic effects not only in the calculations of deeply bound state masses ( @xmath193 ) but also in the case of higher radial excitation states ( @xmath194 ) .",
    "therefore the mass spectra calculations performed in the fully relativistic salpeter framework as presented in this paper , may be more realistic than the numerous so - called relativized quark model calculations that do not incorporate the negative energy components of the constituents in an unrestricted manner .",
    "a further feature of the fully relativistic salpeter framework affects the scalar sector : using the @xmath1-breaking instanton induced t hooft interaction in order to compute the pseudoscalar mass splittings , the fully relativistic framework automatically generates flavour mixings also in the scalar sector caused by the same interaction .",
    "therefore the present model allows to compute realistic scalar @xmath3 states , in contrast to its nonrelativistic reduction , where the t hooft interaction acts for the pseudoscalar mesons only .",
    "it turned out that the masses and flavour mixings of the scalar mesons essentially depend on the confinement dirac structure : in model @xmath35 the structure @xmath0 fixes the basic mass centroid of the scalar ground state nonet at roughly 1.3 gev , which the t hooft interaction then splits into an almost @xmath255 singlet at roughly 1 gev and an almost @xmath255 octet at about 1.4 gev .",
    "in contrast , the @xmath1-invariant dirac structure @xmath2 in model @xmath37 produces the basic mass centroid at about 1.01.1 gev . here",
    "the t hooft interaction lowers the dominantly flavour singlet @xmath52-state to roughly 700 mev and pushes the dominantly flavour octet @xmath52-state to approximately 1.3 gev .",
    "the lightest @xmath54-state appears at roughly 1 gev and its decay properties are not in contradiction with a @xmath3 interpretation of the @xmath45 .",
    "the lightest scalar kaon appears roughly 200 mev lower than the corresponding experimental resonance in this sector .",
    "however , as the model presented here does not take into account any effects of decay channel couplings on the meson masses , we followed a suggestion of v. v. anisovich and coworkers , not to identify our calculations with the observed resonance positions but with their k - matrix poles ( bare states ) deduced from appropriate data sets .",
    "this assignment then not only fits to the calculated members of the scalar ground state nonet but also to their first radial excitation states in confinement model @xmath37 .",
    "however , up to now such a k - matrix analysis has not been performed for all quantum numbers",
    ". therefore the bare states are unknown in many meson sectors , such that an overall comparison with our masses is not possible so far .",
    "moreover , from our point of view significantly different mass shifts between bare states and real resonances would be unpleasant in many sectors due to the fact that our model calculations agree well with the global structure of the experimental mass spectrum .",
    "a k - matrix analysis in all meson sectors would be very desirable to clarify this matter .",
