    "<S> if the baryon asymmetry of the universe is produced by leptogenesis , cp violation is required in the lepton sector . in the seesaw extension of the standard model with three hierarchical right - handed neutrinos </S>",
    "<S> , we show that the baryon asymmetry is _ insensitive _ to the pmns phases : thermal leptogenesis can work for any value of the observable phases . </S>",
    "<S> this result was well - known when there are no flavour effects in leptogenesis ; we show that it remains true when flavour effects are included .    ,    _ </S>",
    "<S> introduction : _ cp violation is required to produce the puzzling excess of matter ( baryons ) over anti - matter ( anti - baryons ) observed in the universe@xcite . if this baryon asymmetry of the universe ( bau ) was made via leptogenesis @xcite , then cp violation in the lepton sector is needed . </S>",
    "<S> so any observation thereof , for instance in neutrino oscillations , would support leptogenesis by demonstrating that cp is not a symmetry of the leptons . </S>",
    "<S> it is interesting to explore whether a stronger statement can be made about this tantalising link between low - energy observable cp violation and the bau .    in this paper , we wish to address a phenomenological question : `` is the baryon asymmetry _ sensitive _ to the phases of the lepton mixing matrix ( pmns matrix ) ? '' . </S>",
    "<S> electroweak precision data was said to be sensitive to the top mass , meaning that a preferred range for @xmath0 could be extracted from the data . here , we wish to ask a similar question , assuming the baryon asymmetry is generated , via leptogenesis , from the decay of the lightest `` right - handed '' ( rh ) neutrino : given the measured value of the baryon asymmetry , can an allowed range for the pmns phases be obtained ?    </S>",
    "<S> it was shown in @xcite that the bau produced by thermal leptogenesis in the type 1 seesaw , without `` flavour effects '' , is insensitive to pmns phases . </S>",
    "<S> that is , the pmns phases can be zero while leptogenesis works , and the cp asymmetry of leptogenesis can vanish for arbitrary values of the pmns phases . </S>",
    "<S> in fact , the `` unflavoured '' asymmetry is controlled by phases from the rh sector only , and it would vanish were this sector cp conserving . </S>",
    "<S> however , it was recently realised that lepton flavour matters in leptogenesis@xcite : in the relevant temperature range @xmath1 gev , the final baryon asymmetry depends separately on the lepton asymmetry in @xmath2s , and on the lepton asymmetry in muons and electrons . </S>",
    "<S> so in this paper , we revisit the question addressed in @xcite , but with the inclusion of flavour effects . </S>",
    "<S> our analysis differs from recent discussions @xcite ( 2rhn model ) , @xcite ( cp as a symmetry of the @xmath3 sector ) , @xcite ( sequential @xmath3 dominance ) in that we wish to do a bottom - up analysis of the three generation seesaw . </S>",
    "<S> ideally , we wish to express the baryon asymmetry in terms of observables , such as the light neutrino masses and pmns matrix , and free parameters . </S>",
    "<S> then , by inspection , one could determine whether fixing the baryon asymmetry constrained the pmns phases .    </S>",
    "<S> _ notation and review : _ we consider a seesaw model @xcite , where three heavy ( @xmath4 gev ) majorana neutrinos @xmath5 are added to the standard model . </S>",
    "<S> the lagrangian at the @xmath5 mass scale is = ^j * y_e*_ij h_d ^i + ^j * * _ ij h_u ^i + ^j n^ck + h.c . </S>",
    "<S> [ lag ] where the flavour index order on the yukawa matrices @xmath6 is left - right , and @xmath7 .    </S>",
    "<S> there are 6 phases among the 21 parameters of this lagrangian . </S>",
    "<S> we can work in the mass eigenstate basis of the charged leptons and the @xmath5 , and write the neutrino yukawa matrix as = v_l^d_v_r  , where @xmath8 is real and diagonal , and @xmath9 are unitary matrices , each containing three phases . </S>",
    "<S> so at the high scale , one can distinguish cp violation in the left - handed doublet sector ( phases that appear in @xmath10 ) and in the right - handed singlet sector ( phases in @xmath11 ) . </S>",
    "<S> leptogenesis can work when there are phases in either or both sectors .    at energies accessible to experiment , well below the @xmath5 mass scale , </S>",
    "<S> the light ( lh ) neutrinos acquire an effective majorana mass matrix:_{\\alpha \\beta } \\nu^\\alpha \\nu^\\beta + h.c$ ] ] [ kappa ] [ m ] = m^-1 ^tv^2 = u d_m u^t where @xmath12 gev is the higgs vev , @xmath13 is diagonal with real eigenvalues , and @xmath14 is the pmns matrix . </S>",
    "<S> there are nine parameters in @xmath15 $ ] , which is `` in principle '' experimentally accessible . </S>",
    "<S> two mass differences and two angles of @xmath14 are measured , leaving the mass scale , one angle and three phases of @xmath14 unknown .    from the above </S>",
    "<S> we can write d_m & = & u^v_l^d_v_r d_m^-1v_r^t d_v_l^ * u^ * v^2 </S>",
    "<S> so we see that the pmns matrix will generically have phases if @xmath10 and/or @xmath11 are complex . </S>",
    "<S> like leptogenesis , it receives contributions from cp violation in the lh and rh sectors . </S>",
    "<S> thus it seems `` probable '' , or even `` natural '' , that there is some relation between the cp violation of leptogenesis and of the pmns matrix . </S>",
    "<S> however , the notion of relation or dependence is nebulous @xcite , so we address the more clear and simple question of whether the baryon asymmetry is _ sensitive _ to pmns phases . by this </S>",
    "<S> we mean : if the total baryon asymmetry is fixed , and we assume to know all the neutrino masses and mixing angles , can we predict ranges for the pmns phases ?    we suppose that the baryon asymmetry is made via leptogenesis , in the decay of the lightest singlet @xmath16 , with @xmath17 gev . </S>",
    "<S> flavour effects are relevant in this temperature range @xcite , . </S>",
    "<S> is slower than the interactions of the @xmath2 yukawa @xcite ] @xmath16 decays to leptons @xmath18 , an amount @xmath19 more than to anti - leptons @xmath20 , and this lepton asymmetry is transformed to a baryon asymmetry by sm processes ( sphalerons ) . </S>",
    "<S> we will further suppose that the partial decay rates of @xmath16 to each flavour are faster than the expansion rate of the universe @xmath21 . </S>",
    "<S> this implies that @xmath16 decays are close to equilibrium , and there is a significant washout of the lepton asymmetry due to @xmath16 interactions ( strong washout regime ) ; we discuss later why this assumption does not affect our conclusions .    </S>",
    "<S> flavour effects are relevant in leptogenesis@xcite because the final asymmetry cares which leptons @xmath22 are distinguishable . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath16 interacts only via its yukawa coupling , which controls its production and destruction . </S>",
    "<S> the washout of the asymmetry , by decays , inverse decays and scatterings of @xmath16 , is therefore crucial for leptogenesis to work , because otherwise the opposite sign asymmetry generated at early times during @xmath16 production would cancel the asymmetry produced as they disappear . to obtain the washout rates ( for instance , for @xmath23 ) , one must know the initial state particles , that is , which leptons are distinguishable .    at @xmath24 , </S>",
    "<S> when the asymmetry is generated , sm interactions can be categorised as much faster than @xmath21 , of order @xmath21 , or much slower . </S>",
    "<S> interactions that are slower than @xmath21 can be neglected . </S>",
    "<S> @xmath25 is the age of the universe and the timescale of leptogenesis , so the faster interactions should be resummed for instance into thermal masses . in the temperature range @xmath26 gev , interactions of the @xmath2 yukawa </S>",
    "<S> are faster than @xmath21 , so the @xmath27 doublet is distinguishable ( has a different `` thermal mass '' ) from the other two lepton doublets . </S>",
    "<S> the decay of @xmath16 therefore produces asymmetries in @xmath28 , and in @xmath29 , where @xmath30 ( `` other '' ) is the projection in @xmath31 and @xmath32 space , of the direction into which @xmath16 decays@xcite : @xmath33 . following @xcite , </S>",
    "<S> we approximate these asymmetries to evolve independently . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the baryon to entropy ratio can be written as the sum over flavour of the flavoured cp asymmetries @xmath19 times a flavour - dependent washout parameter @xmath34 which is obtained by solving the relevant flavoured boltzmann equations @xcite : y_b ( _ _ + _ o o _ o ) [ yb ] where @xmath35 counts entropy , and the 12/37 is the fraction of a @xmath36 asymmetry which , in the presence of sphalerons , is stored in baryons .    in the limit of hierarchical rh neutrinos , the cp asymmetry in the decay @xmath37 can be written as _ & & - \\ { [ ] _ 1 [ m^ ] _ 1 } [ epsaa ] where @xmath38 is defined in eqn ( [ kappa ] ) .    in the case of `` strong washout '' for all flavours , which corresponds to @xmath39 for @xmath40 , </S>",
    "<S> the washout factor is approximately @xcite _ 1.3 ( ) ^1.16 [ etaa ] where there is no sum on @xmath41 , @xmath42 ev , and @xmath43 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ( rescaled ) @xmath16 decay rate is = _ _ = _ v^2    _ an equation : _ combining equations ( [ yb ] ) , ( [ epsaa ] ) , and ( [ etaa ] ) , we obtain @xmath44 , where ( @xmath41 not summed ) & = & _ \\ { _ m _ _ } and the yukawa couplings of @xmath16 have been written as a phase factor times a magnitude : @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> so the baryon asymmetry can be approximated as y_b & & y_b^bd ( + . + & & + . ) </S>",
    "<S> [ belle ] the prefactor of the parentheses @xmath46 is the upper bound on the baryon asymmetry , that would be obtained in the strong washout case by neglecting flavour effects . </S>",
    "<S> recall that this equation is only valid in strong washout for all flavours .    </S>",
    "<S> this equation reproduces the observation @xcite , that : _ ( </S>",
    "<S> i ) _ for equal asymmetries and equal decay rates of all distinguishable flavours , flavour effects increase the upper bound on the baryon asymmetry by @xmath47 . _ ( ii ) _ more interestingly , having stronger washout in one flavour , can increase the baryon asymmetry [ via the term in brackets ] . </S>",
    "<S> so models in which the yukawa coupling @xmath48 is significantly different from @xmath49 , can have an enhanced baryon asymmetry ( with cooperation from the phases ) .    </S>",
    "<S> finally , this equation is attractive step towards writing the baryon asymmetry as a real function of real parameters ( @xmath50 , depending on @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , times a phase factor @xcite . in this case </S>",
    "<S> , the phase factor is a sum of three terms , depending on the phases of the @xmath16 yukawa couplings , light neutrino mass matrix elements normalised by the heaviest mass , and a ( real ) ratio of yukawas .    _ </S>",
    "<S> cp violation : _ in this section , we would like to use eqn ( [ belle ] ) to show that the baryon asymmetry is insensitive to the pmns phases . </S>",
    "<S> the parameters of the lepton sector can be divided into `` measurables '' , which are the neutrino and charged lepton masses , and the three angles and three phases of the pmns matrix @xmath14 . </S>",
    "<S> the remaining 9 parameters are unmeasurable . </S>",
    "<S> we want to show that for any value of the pmns phases , there is at least one point in the parameter space of the unmeasurables where a large enough baryon asymmetry is obtained . </S>",
    "<S> the approximations leading to eqn ( [ belle ] ) are only valid in a subset of the unmeasurable parameter space , but if we can find points in this subspace , we are done . </S>",
    "<S> we first show analytically that such points exist , then we do a parameter space scan to confirm that leptogenesis can work for any value of the pmns phases .    </S>",
    "<S> if the phases of the @xmath53 were independent of the pmns phases , and a big enough @xmath54 could be obtained for some value of the pmns phases , then our claim is true by inspection : for any other values , the phases of the @xmath53 could be chosen to reproduce the same @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is in general some relation between the phases of @xmath38 and those of @xmath53 , so we proceed by looking for an area of parameter space where the phases of the @xmath53 can be freely varied without affecting the `` measurables '' . </S>",
    "<S> then we check that a large enough baryon asymmetry can be obtained .    </S>",
    "<S> such an area of parameter space can be found using the @xmath55 matrix parametrisation of casas - ibarra @xcite , where the complex orthogonal matrix @xmath55 is defined such that @xmath56 . taking a simple @xmath55 of the form r = and parametrising @xmath57 , where @xmath58 is a ckm - like unitary matrix with one `` dirac '' phase @xmath59 appearing with @xmath60 , and @xmath61 , gives & = & u_1 + u_3 + & = & u_1 + u_3 + & = & u_e 1 + u_e 3 where we took hierarchical neutrino masses . </S>",
    "<S> we neglect @xmath62 because its absolute value is small . with this choice of the unknown @xmath55 , </S>",
    "<S> the phases of the @xmath53 are effectively independent of the pmns phases . </S>",
    "<S> so for any choice of pmns phases that would appear on the @xmath38 of eqn ( [ belle ] ) , the phases of the yukawa couplings can be chosen independently , to ensure enough cp violation for leptogenesis .    </S>",
    "<S> we now check that a large enough baryon asymmetry can be obtained in this area of parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> the parentheses of eqn ( [ belle ] ) can be written explicitly as \\ { ( m _ + m _ + 2 m _ ) } writing @xmath63 , the final baryon asymmetry can be estimated from eqn ( [ belle ] ) as - ( ) which can equal the observed @xmath64 @xcite for @xmath65 few @xmath66 gev , and judicious choices of @xmath67 and @xmath68 .    </S>",
    "<S> a similar argument can be made if the light neutrino mass spectrum is inverse hierarchical .    </S>",
    "<S> the scatter plots of figure [ fig1 ] show that a large enough baryon asymmetry can be obtained for any value of the pmns phases .    </S>",
    "<S> the plots are obtained by fixing @xmath69 gev , and the measured neutrino parameters to their central values . to mimic the possibility that @xmath70 and @xmath71 could be determined @xmath72 , @xmath70-@xmath71 space is divided into 50 squares . in each square </S>",
    "<S> , the programme randomly generates values for : @xmath73 , @xmath74 , the smallest neutrino mass @xmath75 , and the three complex angles of the @xmath55 matrix . </S>",
    "<S> it estimates the baryon asymmetry from the analytic approximations of @xcite , and puts a cross if it is big enough . </S>",
    "<S> the programme is a proto - monte - carlo - markov - chain , preferring to explore parameter space where the baryon asymmetry is large enough .    </S>",
    "<S> parametrising with the @xmath55 matrix imposes a particular measure ( prior ) on parameter space . </S>",
    "<S> this could mean we only explore a class of models . </S>",
    "<S> this is ok because the aim is only to show that , for any pmns phases , a large enough asymmetry _ can _ be found .    </S>",
    "<S> _ discussion : _ the relevant question , in discussing the `` relation '' between cp violation in the pmns matrix and in leptogenesis , is whether the baryon asymmetry is _ sensitive _ to the pmns phases . </S>",
    "<S> the answer was `` no '' for unflavoured leptogenesis in the standard model seesaw@xcite . </S>",
    "<S> this was not surprising ; the seesaw contains more phases than the pmns matrix , and many unmeasurable real parameters which can be ajusted to obtain a big enough asymmetry . in this paper </S>",
    "<S> , we argue that the answer does not change with the inclusion of flavour effects in leptogenesis : for any value of the pmns phases , it is possible to find a point in the space of unmeasurable seesaw parameters , such that leptogenesis works . </S>",
    "<S> this `` flavoured '' asymmetry can be written as a function of pmns phases , and unmeasurables as entered the unflavoured calculation . </S>",
    "<S> these can still be ajusted to get a big enough asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> in view of this discouraging conclusion , it is maybe worth to emphasize that cp violation from both the left - handed and right - handed neutrino sectors , contributes both to the pmns matrix and the baryon asymmetry . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the answer to this question in an msugra framework , with additional information from lepton flavour violating observables@xcite , is still work in progress .    in the demonstration </S>",
    "<S> that the baryon asymmetry ( produced via thermal leptogenesis ) is insensitive to pmns phases , we found an interesting approximation for the `` phase of leptogenesis '' ( see eqn ( [ belle ] ) ) , when all lepton flavours are in strong washout . </S>"
