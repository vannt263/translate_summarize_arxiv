    "the interest toward spin systems , and more in particular toward spin dynamics in semiconductor structures , has remarkably increased in the last few years also in connection with new emerging areas of physics such as quantum information and computation . in this framework",
    "it becomes a relevant subject to analyze the entanglement behavior in spin systems in order to assess the performance of applications for example in quantum information processing .",
    "quite recently it has been shown that entanglement in two qubits system can experience sudden death and sudden birth .",
    "this phenomenon @xcite,@xcite deserve a great attention also in applicative contexts from quantum optical to condensed matter systems and has been observed in laboratory in experiments with entangled photon pairs @xcite and atomic ensembles @xcite . in this paper",
    "we demonstrate the possibility of realizing such a behavior in a system of two uncoupled spins in a common environment .",
    "let s consider a bipartite system constituted by two spins @xmath0 and @xmath1 , hereafter called central spins , that interact , with the same coupling constants @xmath2 , with a system of @xmath3 uncoupled spins .",
    "the hamiltonian model that describes such a physical situation is @xmath4 with @xmath5 where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are spin operators acting on the hilbert space of the central system and @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the collective operators describing the others @xmath3 spins . in solid state physics , for example",
    ", this model can effectively describe many physical systems such as quantum dots @xcite , two - dimensional electron gases @xcite and optical lattices @xcite .",
    "the time - dependent schrdinger equation has been already solved for an arbitrary initial condition @xcite , @xcite . in what follows",
    "we analyze the dynamics of the entanglement in the central system when the surrounding spins are prepared in specific initial conditions .",
    "suppose that the @xmath3 uncoupled spins around the central system are prepared in a linear superposition , with binomial weight , of eigenstates @xmath10 of @xmath11 and @xmath12 with @xmath13 .",
    "the two central spins @xmath0 and @xmath1 are instead prepared in the state @xmath14 that is a maximally entangled state .",
    "the initial condition we are considering can be thus written as @xmath15 where @xmath16^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\qquad p\\in[0,1].\\ ] ] at a time instant @xmath17 we can write @xcite @xmath18 with @xmath19 where @xmath20 . exploiting eqs.([psit])-([ab ] ) it is possible to prove that at any time instant @xmath17 the reduced density matrix of the central system in the two - spin standard basis @xmath21 , has the following quite simple structure @xmath22 where @xmath23 to estimate the entanglement in the central system we adopt the well - known concurrence function c @xcite that in our case can be simply expressed as @xmath24\\equiv\\max\\left[0,\\ \\sum_{j=0}^{n/2}(b_0^{j})^2\\left(1 - 2(\\delta s_z(t))^2\\right)\\right],\\ ] ] where @xmath25 . the presence of entanglement in the two central spins thus is strictly related to the behavior of observable of clear physical meaning .",
    "it is interesting to underline that for @xmath26 and @xmath27 , it s possible to find the following closed form of @xmath28 @xmath29.\\ ] ]     in function of @xmath30 for @xmath31 with @xmath32    fig.@xmath33 displays the behavior of the exact concurrence function @xmath28 as given by eq.([exact ] ) ( continous line ) and its approximation , eq.([approximation ] ) , ( dot line ) .",
    "as expected the agreement is excellent at least for @xmath26 .",
    "moreover the figure puts into light an interesting behavior in the time evolution of the entanglement present in the central spins .",
    "starting , indeed , by construction from @xmath34 , the concurrence function evolves showing collapses and revivals phenomena . on the other hand ,",
    "it is possible to prove that during the plateau of @xmath28 ( that is when @xmath28 maintains the zero value ) the two spins are in a separable state described by the following density matrix @xmath35 that describes a system characterized by an equal probability of finding all the states @xmath36 . after the plateau of the entanglement the concurrence function suddenly grows up reaching values near to @xmath33 .",
    "this behavior periodically appears .",
    "the collapses and revivals of @xmath28 shown in fig.@xmath33 recalls those we have in the dynamical behavior of the two - photon jaynes - cummings model @xcite,@xcite described by the following hamiltonian model @xmath37 where @xmath38 is the annihilation operator of the single cavity mode .",
    "the analogy between our spin star system and the two - photon j - c model can be better brought to light following the suggestion of ref@xcite , that is putting @xmath39 exploiting indeed such a correspondence the interaction hamiltonian ( [ interaction ] ) assumes the form @xmath40      in this section we analyze a different initial condition for the @xmath3 spins around the central system that is the well know _ atomic coherent state _",
    ", introduced in @xmath41 by arecchi in analogy with the coherent states of the radiation @xcite .",
    "the central system is instead once again in the state @xmath42 .",
    "a coherent state of @xmath3 spins is a linear superposition of states @xmath43 obtained fixing @xmath44 and varying @xmath45 .",
    "in particular , putting @xmath46 , the initial state of the global system is the following @xmath47 where @xmath48^{\\frac{1}{2}},\\qquad p\\in[0,1].\\ ] ] starting from @xmath49 at time instant @xmath17 we have @xcite @xmath50 with @xmath51 @xmath52 where @xmath53 in this case the concurrence function becomes @xmath54.\\ ] ] the dynamical evolution of @xmath28 against @xmath30 is shown in fig.@xmath55 .     in function of @xmath30 for @xmath31 with @xmath56",
    "we observe that in this case the situation is quite different from the situation previously examined : the entanglement initially present in the central system sudden dies after some oscillations and , after a period of time in which it is absent , lives again .",
    "however in this case the concurrence function does not reach values near @xmath33 assuming values less than @xmath57 .",
    "once again it s possible to make a parallel between the j - c model and the spin star system exploiting the holstein - primakoff transformations @xcite @xmath58 that are valid in a subspace with @xmath44 fixed .",
    "operating such a transformation the interaction hamiltonian ( [ interaction ] ) becomes @xmath59,\\ ] ] that in the limit of a large number @xmath3 of spins in the environment , that is @xmath60 , reduces to an hamiltonian of the j - c type .",
    "summarizing in this paper we have focused our attention on a system constituted by two uncoupled spins embedded in a common environment composed by @xmath3 spins .",
    "we have proved the possibility of realizing periodic sudden death and birth of the entanglement in the two not interacting spins appropriately choosing the initial condition of the environment . generally speaking sudden death and sudden birth of the entanglement",
    "provides an interesting resource for creation on demand of entanglement between two qubits .",
