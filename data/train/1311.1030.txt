    "braneworld models involving large extra dimensions @xcite have been very useful in addressing several open questions in high energy physics ( see @xcite for reviews ) .",
    "most of the braneworlds are realized as time - independent field configurations .",
    "however , there have appeared several braneworld models that assumed time - dependent metrics and fields @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we study the non - stationary 6d braneworld generated by standing gravitational waves coupled to a phantom - like bulk scalar field .",
    "the model is generalization of 5d standing waves scenario of @xcite .",
    "the metric we use is special case of the general solution found in @xcite and slightly differs from those of the 6d models @xcite .",
    "we consider 6d space - time , having the signature @xmath0 , with a non - self interacting phantom - like scalar field coupled to gravity .",
    "the action of the model is : @xmath1 where @xmath2 is the fundamental scale , which relates to the 6d newton constant , @xmath3 .",
    "capital latin indexes numerate the coordinates of 6d space - time and we use the units where @xmath4 .",
    "variation of the action ( [ action ] ) with respect to @xmath5 leads to the 6d einstein equations : @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the energy momentum tensor of the scalar field . using ( [ scalart ] ) the einstein equations ( [ einstein1 ] ) can be rewritten in the form : @xmath8    to solve the equations ( [ einstein2 ] ) we take the metric _ ansatz _ : @xmath9 where @xmath10 , @xmath11 are some functions , and suppose that phantom - like scalar field depends only on the time and on the modulus of one extra dimension coordinate @xmath12 . by the metric ( [ ansatz ] )",
    "we want to describe geometry of the brane placed at the origin of the large extra dimension , @xmath12 , when @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 denote coordinates along the brane .",
    "the sixth coordinate @xmath16 can be assumed to be compact , curled up to the unobservable sizes for the present energies .",
    "advantage of our 6d _ ansatz _ ( [ ansatz ] ) is that it looks symmetric in the brane coordinates @xmath13 , @xmath14 and @xmath15 , while in 5d model @xcite the brane 3-plain is non - symmetrically warped .",
    "also ( [ ansatz ] ) is simpler than the metric of the models @xcite , since it contains only one singular point , @xmath17 , where the brane is placed to smooth the singularity .",
    "the system of einstein equations ( [ einstein2 ] ) for the _ ansatz _ ( [ ansatz ] ) takes the form : @xmath18 where overdots and primes mean derivatives with respect to @xmath19 and @xmath20 , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the metric field , @xmath21 , is proportional to the bulk phantom field , @xmath22 , and separate the variables : @xmath23 the system ( [ system_1 ] ) reduces to : @xmath24 solution of the first equation of ( [ system_2 ] ) with the boundary condition : @xmath25 ( leading to the minkowski metric at @xmath26 ) is ; @xmath27 where @xmath28 is some constant . using ( [ s_sol ] ) the second equation of ( [ system_2 ] )",
    "takes the form : @xmath29 solution to this equation leading to the minkowski metric at @xmath26 is : @xmath30\\right ) ~,\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is a constant .",

    "when the frequency of standing gravitational waves , @xmath34 , is much larger than frequencies associated with the energies of the particles on the brane , @xmath35 we can perform time averaging of oscillating exponents in the equations of matter fields . using the known formula for averages : @xmath36 where @xmath37 is modified bessel function of zero order , we can find the time average of our _ ansatz _ ( [ ansatz ] ) : @xmath38\\right ) ) \\left ( dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2 \\right ) - \\nonumber \\\\ & - & dr^2 -i_0(-3c\\sin \\left ( a\\omega \\ln[1+|r|/a]\\right ) ) d\\theta^2\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]",
    "let us consider the localization problem for the massless scalar field , @xmath39 , defined by the 6d action : @xmath40 the corresponding klein - gordon equation is : @xmath41 we look for the solution of this equation in the form : @xmath42 let us consider the @xmath43-wave solution ( @xmath44 ) and nothing depends on the extra dimension angle @xmath16 .",

    "so normalizable zero modes of our scalar field , @xmath39 , on the brane will be exists if the action ( [ action_last ] ) is integrable over @xmath12 , i.e. the functions @xmath46 , @xmath47 and @xmath48 are integrable .    on the background ( [ ansatz_solv ] ) the differential operator in the klein - gordon equation ( [ scalfieldeqn ] ) , after time averaging ,",
    "gets the form : @xmath49 applying this operator for the @xmath43-wave part of the scalar field wavefunction ( [ fsi ] ) we find : @xmath50 ' + \\left[\\frac{1}{(1 + r / a)}e^{2 } -\\left(1+\\frac{r}{a}\\right)\\left\\langle e^{u}\\right\\rangle",

    "it is easy to find that the equation ( [ eq - phi ] ) has the plane wave solution : @xmath60 where @xmath61 and @xmath62 are constants .",
    "fare from the brane , @xmath63 , the equation ( [ sr_like ] ) reduces to : @xmath64 so at the infinity @xmath22 behaves as @xmath65 where @xmath66 are another integration constants .",
    "so if we assume that @xmath67 the function @xmath22 will be sharply decreasing function from the location of the brane , i.e. scalar field @xmath39 will be localized on the brane .",
    "we have demonstrate pure gravitational localization of scalar zero mode particles on the brane using approximate solutions ( [ sol-0 ] ) and ( [ sol - infty ] ) .",

    "we display all @xmath12-depended factors in ( [ action_last ] ) which are multiplied by @xmath12 .",

    "in this letter we have demonstrated the pure gravitational localization of scala field zero modes within the 6d model of the standing wave braneworld @xcite .",
    "the model represents a single ( 1 + 3)-brane in six dimensional space - time with one large ( infinite ) and one small ( compact ) space - like extra dimensions .",
    "the trapping is provided by the rapid oscillations of gravitational ; and ghost - like scalar fields in the bulk .",
