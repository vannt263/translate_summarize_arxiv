    "the likelihood of giant planet formation via direct gravitational instability of circumstellar disks around solar - type stars has been the subject of intense research in the past years . despite much effort in this field ,",

    "circumstellar disks are _ not _ isolated in the early embedded phase of star formation ( hereafter , epsf ) . in this stage , they are subject to intense mass loading from a natal cloud core , which can significantly alter the disk s ability to fragment .",
    "a self - consistent handling of this process in numerical simulations is not easy and requires a much larger spatial scale ( than just that of the disk ) . a spatial resolution of less than 1  au is usually needed for planetary - mass fragments to form and _",
    "survive_. global numerical hydrodynamics simulations of the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of molecular clouds have demonstrated that forming stars are indeed surrounded by accreting gravitationally unstable disks ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "yet , these simulations resolve only massive disks , which , if fragmented , produce brown dwarfs or low - mass stellar companions rather than giant planets .",
    "moreover , such numerical simulations are very computationally intensive and are unable to explore a wide parameter space and long evolution times .",
    "on the other hand , semi - analytic models and simplified numerical simulations of the gravitational collapse of dense cloud cores can explore a wide range of initial conditions and can give us a valuable insight into the required conditions for disk fragmentation . using the thin - disk approximation , we were able to self - consistently follow the process of cloud core collapse and star / disk formation for at least several myr after the formation of a central stellar object @xcite .",
    "these studies have shown that circumstellar disks may be gravitationally unstable and susceptible to fragmentation if the rate of gas deposition onto the disk from the cloud core is greater than that from the disk onto the star , disk viscosity is not too high , and the natal cloud cores are characterized by sufficiently large rotation rates .",
    "more sophisticated numerical hydrodynamics simulations , though with an approximate treatment of gas infall onto the disk , and semi - analytic studies have confirmed the susceptibility of non - isolated disks to fragmentation , particularly at large radii ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the feasibility of disk fragmentation and giant planet formation is only one part of the problem .",
    "the other part is the likelihood of survival of giant planets formed via disk fragmentation .",
    "rapid radial migration due to gravitational interaction of a giant planet with a natal gas disk @xcite has traditionally been one of the stumbling blocks for the theory of giant planet formation and many mechanisms have been proposed to stop this migration in the late evolution phase ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "? * ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the early epsf , this problem may be even more severe due to the fact that disks are more massive and profoundly non - axisymmetric .",
    "indeed , our previous numerical studies have shown that fragments forming in the epsf are quickly driven into the inner regions and probably onto the protostar due to exchange of angular momentum with spiral arms @xcite .",
    "we have speculated that only those fragments that form in the late epsf , when gravitational instability starts to gradually decline with time , may have a chance to survive . in this paper , we present confirmation that the fragments formed in the epsf can survive through this extreme phase and form giant protoplanets ( hereafter , gpps ) on large , relatively stable orbits .",
    "this finding is made possible by the employment of expanded computational resources , by improvements in the numerical model , and by the use of a wider parameter space in comparison to previous works .",
    "our numerical model is explained in detail in @xcite and is briefly summarized below .",
    "we make use of the thin - disk approximation to compute the gravitational collapse of rotating , gravitationally unstable cloud cores .",
    "we start our numerical integration in the pre - stellar phase , which is characterized by a collapsing _ starless _ cloud core with a typical radius of @xmath0  au , continue into the epsf , which sees the formation of a star / disk / envelope system , and terminate our simulations in the late t tauri phase .",
    "the mass accretion rate onto the disk , @xmath1 , is not a free parameter but is self - consistently determined by the dynamics of the gas in the envelope .",
    "we introduce a `` sink cell '' at @xmath2  au and impose a free inflow inner boundary condition .",
    "ninety per cent of the gas that crosses the inner boundary is assumed to land onto the central star plus the inner axisymmetric disk at @xmath3  au .",
    "the other 10% of the accreted gas is assumed to be carried away with protostellar jets .",
    "the basic equations of mass and momentum transport in the thin - disk approximation are @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the mass surface density , @xmath6 is the vertically integrated gas pressure , @xmath7 is the vertical scale height , @xmath8 is the velocity in the disk plane , @xmath9 is the gravitational acceleration in the disk plane , and @xmath10 is the gradient along the planar coordinates of the disk .",
    "the gravitational acceleration @xmath11 includes the gravity of a central point object ( when formed ) , the gravity of the inner inactive disk ( @xmath3  au ) , and the self - gravity of a circumstellar disk and envelope . for the kinematic viscosity @xmath12 that enters the viscous stress tensor @xmath13",
    ", we use the usual @xmath14-prescription , with a spatially and temporally uniform @xmath15 .",
    "the latter choice is based on our recent work @xcite , i.e. , @xmath14 is small enough to not eliminate the burst mode and large enough to drive significant accretion in the late stages of disk evolution .",
    "equations  ( [ cont ] ) and ( [ mom ] ) are closed with a barotropic equation that makes a smooth transition from isothermal to adiabatic evolution at @xmath16 @xcite . for the ratio of specific heats we use @xmath17=1.4 .",
    "the @xmath17=5/3 case was explored in @xcite .",
    "the value of @xmath18 is calculated during the numerical simulations as @xmath19 , where the critical volume number density @xmath20 is set to @xmath21  @xmath22 @xcite and the mean molecular weight @xmath23 .",
    "the scale height @xmath7 is calculated using the assumption of vertical hydrostatic equilibrium .",
    "we note that @xmath7 is an increasing function of radius , which makes @xmath18 increase with radius as well . in practice",
    ", this means that the inner disk regions are significantly warmer than the outer regions , since the optically thick regime in the inner regions is achieved at lower @xmath5 .",
    "this in turn impedes the development of gravitational instability and fragmentation in the inner disk , in agreement with more sophisticated numerical simulations and theoretical predictions that directly solve for the energy balance equation ( see e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "the use of a spatially varying @xmath18 is an important improvement of the numerical model as compared to our previous works .",
    "equations  ( [ cont ] ) and ( [ mom ] ) are solved in polar coordinates @xmath24 on a numerical grid with @xmath25 or @xmath26 ( depending on the model ) grid zones using the method of finite - differences .",
    "the radial points are logarithmically spaced .    initially",
    ", cloud cores have surface densities @xmath5 and angular velocities @xmath27 typical for a collapsing , axisymmetric , magnetically supercritical core @xcite , with @xmath28 at large radii .",
    "cloud cores are initially isothermal and they are characterized by a specific ratio of the rotational to gravitational energy @xmath29 .",
    "we have considered the evolution of 82 cloud cores with masses @xmath30 , energy ratios @xmath31 , and initial gas temperatures @xmath32",
    "k. the initial column density is flattened near the center and achieves an asymptotic large - radius profile @xmath33 , where @xmath34 . in our previous papers ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , we took @xmath35 , but here let it vary in the range @xmath36=28 , so that models can be more gravitationally unstable .",
    "the formation of giant planets via disk fragmentation can only take place if the the ratio of the local cooling time @xmath37 to the local dynamical time @xmath38 is smaller than a few ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . our preliminary results with disk cooling , viscous and shock heating , and stellar irradiation included in the code",
    "indicate that this condition is satisfied in the epsf , at least in the disk s outer regions @xcite .",
    "another requirement for disk fragmentation is the toomre criterion @xmath39 , which states that the gas surface density @xmath5 should be sufficiently high for a disk to fragment .",
    "too high a @xmath5 , however , may prevent fragmentation due to increased opacity and cooling time @xcite .",
    "in other words , there exists minimum and maximum values of @xmath5 between which the instability and fragmentation are expected to occur . in numerical simulations that form disks self - consistently ( such as our own ) , @xmath5 naturally increases from low toward higher values during the disk formation phase and the disk may pass through the unstable regime .",
    "the critical density for fragmentation can in principle be achieved if the rate of mass deposition onto the disk @xmath1 is greater than the mass flux in the disk @xmath40 so that @xmath5 quickly increases with time @xcite and this phase of intense infall ( i.e. , the epsf ) lasts for many dynamical times ( so that the gpps have enough time to form ) . simple analytical estimates for a viscous disk indicate that @xmath41 for @xmath42 @xcite , which implies that the outer disk regions are expected to fragment for values of @xmath43 .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite also show that @xmath1 is on average several times greater than @xmath40 in the epsf .",
    "observations provide conflicting estimates as to the duration of the embedded phase @xmath44 , ranging from a  few  @xmath45  yr to a  few  @xmath46  yr @xcite . from simple analytical grounds",
    "it follows that @xmath44 should be linearly proportional to the initial cloud core mass @xmath47 and inverse proportional to @xmath48 and @xmath36 .",
    "in addition , such effects as rotation and magnetic fields may steepen the relationship , particularly for cloud cores of solar mass and greater .",
    "the numerically obtained values for @xmath49 , @xmath50=10  k , and @xmath36=2 range from 0.03  myr for @xmath51 to 0.5  myr for @xmath52 @xcite .",
    "these values may decrease by as much as 34 for @xmath50=20  k or @xmath36=8 .",
    "nevertheless , cloud cores in the aforementioned mass range are expected to have @xmath44 that are considerably longer than typical orbital times of 3603200  yr for radial distances of 50100  au and stellar masses of 0.11  @xmath53 .",
    "another important initial parameter that determines the disk propensity to fragment is the amount of rotation in the natal cloud core .",
    "indeed , cloud cores with greater rotation rates would make larger disks since the centrifugal radius is proportional to the square of the specific angular momentum , which would increase disk tendency to fragment ( recall that fragmentation tends to occur at large radii ) .",
    "this has been confirmed by numerical and semi - analytic simulations of disk formation @xcite .",
    "the above analysis indicates that disks formed from sufficiently massive cloud cores with sufficiently high angular momenta are expected to fragment in the embedded phase , particularly in the outer regions .",
    "this conclusion has been corroborated by numerical simulations that form disks self - consistently @xcite or impose some prescribed rate of mass infall onto the disk @xcite .",
    "it is therefore not so much the feasibility of fragmentation as the likelihood of survival of the forming fragments that we focus in the present study .      in agreement with section  [ fragment ] , we have found that the disk propensity to fragment increases along the sequence of increasing @xmath47 and @xmath54 . this tendency is reflected in both the greater numbers and higher masses of the fragments , which form via fragmentation of dense spiral arms .",
    "the final masses of fragments that form in our simulations lie in a wide range starting from a few jupiter masses and ending with low- and intermediate - mass brown dwarfs . for disk fragmentation to take place ,",
    "the minimum cloud core mass should be @xmath55 for @xmath56 and @xmath36=2 .",
    "for @xmath57 and @xmath35 , the corresponding @xmath58 is approximately 0.2  @xmath53 .",
    "these minimum masses decrease by about 30% for higher perturbation amplitudes @xmath59 due to an associated increase in @xmath1 , which promotes disk fragmentation . on the other hand ,",
    "our preliminary results suggest that @xmath58 may increase somewhat if a more accurate treatment of the thermal physics is considered .",
    "not all fragments evolve ultimately to gpps , most have either migrated through the inner boundary or dispersed in the outer regions ( possibly due to insufficient resolution ) .",
    "only 6 out of the 82 models have formed gpps with final masses in the @xmath60 range on relatively stable orbits at 25200  au . in two models we saw two gpps forming simultaneously , but in both cases",
    "the outer one had dispersed just after 1.0  myr of evolution , either due to insufficient numerical resolution or tidal disruption by the inner gpp because of proximity to the 4:1 resonance .",
    "these numbers should not be treated as representative , since we expect the number of survived gpps to increase in simulations with a higher numerical resolution .    among 47 models with @xmath61 only two models with high density perturbation amplitude @xmath59 ( as opposed to standard @xmath36=2 ) have revealed planet formation .",
    "the most likely reason why low-@xmath54 and low-@xmath36 models fail to form gpps is that their disks are too small and the fragments are forming too close to the star , which lowers their chances to survive .",
    "in addition , these models have lower disk - to - star mass ratios than their high-@xmath54 and high-@xmath36 counterparts , which results in the formation of lower - mass fragments .",
    "such fragments need more time to open the gap and slow down the fast inward migration in the embedded phase .",
    "figure  [ fig1 ] presents the gas surface density maps ( in g  @xmath62 ) in model  1 ( @xmath63 , @xmath64 , @xmath36=2 ) at six evolution times after the formation of the disk .",
    "the rotation is counterclockwise ( note that we zoom in at the bottom row ) .",
    "several fragments condense in the outer parts of the spiral arms as early as 0.09  myr after the disk formation , but none of them have survived by the end of the embedded phase at @xmath65  myr when about 7580% of the envelope has been accreted by the disk .",
    "they are all driven into the sink cell via a very efficient exchange of angular momentum with the spiral arms , possibly leading to multiple fu orionis bursts @xcite or forming giant planets on very close orbits .",
    "the byproduct of these bursts is disk expansion due to the conservation of angular momentum .",
    "when the mass loading from the envelope diminishes and the burst phase ends , this expansion is followed by transient disk contraction , during which gas surface density increases and several more fragments form in the disk s outermost regions ( @xmath66  myr ) .",
    "these fragments quickly migrate in the inner 100  au and , by @xmath67  myr , only one fragment survives , which later opens a gap and evolves into a well defined gpp possessing its own _ counterrotating _ minidisk .",
    "such counterrotating minidisks are seen around many fragments .",
    "we believe that this effect is caused by the gravitational capture of some of the neighboring material , which receives a counterrotating twist around the forming fragment due to differential rotation of the natal spiral arm .",
    "figure  [ fig2 ] shows the gpp s radial position @xmath68 ( top ) , mass ( middle ) , and hill s radius ( bottom ) , as a function of time in model  1 .",
    "since we do not use sink particles for gpps , these values should be treated as approximate . upon its formation at @xmath69",
    "au , the gpp migrates quickly in the inner 40  au and back ( this time more slowly ) to @xmath70  au .",
    "the outward migration is then followed by a gradual inward migration until the gpp finally settles at @xmath71  au .",
    "the mass of the gpp is estimated by integrating the azimuthally - averaged gas surface density profile around a local maximum at the planet location . the middle panel of fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] shows the _ upper _ limits on the total mass of the inner gpp plus its mini - disk ( dashed line ) and the mass @xmath72 of the inner gpp ( solid line ) .",
    "the latter value is uncertain to within a factor of unity .",
    "the total ( planet plus disk ) mass is always in the giant planet regime , while @xmath72 is around @xmath73 .",
    "the bottom panel shows the hill radius @xmath74 of the gpp ( solid line ) and the azimuthally - averaged vertical scale height at the planet position @xmath75 ( dashed line ) .",
    "it is seen that a condition for gap opening , @xmath76 , is satisfied .",
    "how stable are the orbits of gpps in our modeling ?",
    "figure  [ fig3 ] presents the radial position of gpps vs. time in model  2 ( solid line , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath35 ) and model  3 ( dashed line , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , @xmath59 ) .",
    "initially , model  2 demonstrates a similar migration pattern to that of model  1 .",
    "however , the gpp in model  2 does not seem to settle at a stable orbit but slowly migrates inward .",
    "whether or not this migration would stop at later times is unclear . on the contrary ,",
    "the gpp in model  3 appears to stabilize at a rather large radial distance of 190  au .",
    "these examples indicate that gpps may have various migration histories , which depend probably on particular physical conditions in the disk and the natal cloud core .",
    "the net planet masses are @xmath81 in model 2 and @xmath82 in model  3 .",
    "we have studied the long - term evolution of disks that are formed by the self - consistent collapse of prestellar cores .",
    "our model yields gas giant formation starting from initial conditions of the early stages of star formation .",
    "the initial cores are more gravitationally unstable and have greater angular momenta than similar models studied in the past , and a large number of models have been run with relatively high resolution .",
    "an early burst mode of evolution is characterized by the formation of clumps which are then driven into the inner disk .",
    "however , in a small subset of models , massive fragments are formed on wide orbits and settle into stable orbits of radius @xmath83 au .",
    "an interesting feature is that minidisks around these fragments can be _ counterrotating _ with respect to the disk .",
    "sometimes , the final orbit can be much larger or alternatively there can be a slowly continuing inward migration .",
    "we believe that our results can explain the purported observations of giant planets on wide orbits . by extrapolation",
    ", they may also represent the first stages of the eventual formation of a low mass brown dwarf companion .",
