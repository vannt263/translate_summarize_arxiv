    "in many clusters of galaxies , the radiative cooling time at the cluster s center is much shorter than the cluster s age  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , high - spectral - resolution x - ray observations show that very little plasma actually cools to low temperatures @xcite .",
    "this finding , some times referred to as the `` cooling - flow problem , '' strongly suggests that plasma heating approximately balances radiative cooling in cluster cores .    although a number of different heat sources have been considered in the literature , there is growing interest in the role of central active galactic nuclei ( agns ) .",
    "the importance of agn heating or `` agn feedback '' is suggested by the observation that almost all clusters with strongly cooling cores possess active central radio sources @xcite and by the correlation between the x - ray luminosity from within a cluster s cooling radius and the mechanical luminosity of a cluster s central agn @xcite .",
    "one of the main unsolved problems regarding agn feedback , however , is to understand how agn power is transferred to the diffuse ambient plasma .",
    "a number of mechanisms have been investigated , including compton heating @xcite , shocks @xcite , magnetohydrodynamic wave - mediated plasma heating by cosmic rays @xcite , and cosmic - ray bubbles produced by the central agn @xcite , which can heat intracluster plasma by generating turbulence @xcite and sound waves @xcite and by doing @xmath5 work @xcite .",
    "another way in which central agns may heat the intracluster medium ( icm ) is by accelerating cosmic rays that mix with the intracluster plasma and cause the icm to become convectively unstable .",
    "a steady - state , spherically symmetric model based on this idea was developed by @xcite and subsequently refined by @xcite and @xcite . in this model , a central supermassive black hole accretes hot intracluster plasma at the bondi rate , and",
    "converts a small fraction of the accreted rest - mass energy into cosmic rays that are accelerated by shocks within some distance  @xmath6 of the center of the cluster .",
    "the resulting cosmic - ray pressure gradient leads to convection ( see @xcite and @xcite ) , which in turn heats the thermal plasma in the cluster core by advecting internal energy inwards and allowing the cosmic rays to do  @xmath5 work on the thermal plasma .",
    "the model also includes thermal conduction and cosmic - ray diffusion ( viscous dissipation turns out to be smaller than the other forms of convective heating at all radii ) and assumes a steady state in which the net heating rate balances radiative cooling throughout the cluster .",
    "the model uses mixing - length theory to describe convection and its effects on the icm and predicts a self - consistent profile for the rms amplitude of the turbulent velocity . by adjusting a single parameter in the model ( @xmath6 ) ,",
    "@xcite were able to achieve a good match to the observed density and temperature profiles in a sample of eight clusters .",
    "in several of the clusters in this sample , compact cooling flows arise within the central few kpc of the clusters because the rate of radiative cooling peaks much more sharply near the cluster center than either the convective or conductive heating rates . at even smaller radii in these clusters ,",
    "the cooling flow makes a transition to a bondi flow , in a manner similar to that described by @xcite .",
    "the size of the central cooling flow plays a role in regulating the mass accretion rate within the central bondi flow , as described by @xcite .    in this paper , we explore the connection between this agn - driven - convection model and the observed properties of the iron abundance profiles of cooling - core clusters . while observations of non - cooling - flow clusters show a nearly constant abundance profile , cooling - core clusters show very peaked iron distributions @xcite .",
    "observations of the relative abundances of oxygen , silicon and iron suggest that the production of iron in these abundance excesses is dominated by snia ( and possibly winds ) from the central brightest cluster galaxy ( bcg ) @xcite .",
    "if cooling cores are preserved over a timescale longer than @xmath7  gyr @xcite , then the observed amounts of excess iron ( of order @xmath8  m@xmath9 ) within the cluster core are compatible with the amounts produced within the bcg by snia @xcite and stellar winds @xcite . however , the shape of these abundance profiles is still a mystery .",
    "the distribution of iron is much broader than the distribution of the stars that produce the metals , which indicates some additional processes are needed to transport the metals out of the bcg into the surrounding  icm @xcite .",
    "recently , @xcite developed an analytical model of metal injection by snia and diffusion by turbulent gas motions .",
    "they suggested that the dissipation of the same stochastic gas motions would produce the heating required to solve the cooling - flow problem . using this model , @xcite found that diffusion coefficients of order @xmath10 are required to match the abundance profiles of cooling - core clusters , while spatial scales @xmath11  kpc and velocities of the order of few @xmath12  km.s@xmath13 are needed to compensate the gas cooling .",
    "although these studies offered an explanation for the observed abundance profiles as well as a solution to the cooling - flow problem , they did not explain how the rms amplitude of the turbulent velocity , @xmath14 , is determined , or how the dependence of  @xmath14 on the radial coordinate  @xmath15 is determined . on the other hand , the agn - driven - convection model of @xcite provides a physics - based theoretical framework for calculating  @xmath16 .",
    "in this paper , we combine this model for intracluster turbulence with the model of metal injection of @xcite in order to understand the production and transport of metals in the icm .",
    "we describe these models further in sections  [ sec : model_inj ] and  [ sec : model_diff ] . in sections  [ sec : clusters ] and",
    "[ sec : results1 ] we apply these models to a sample of eight clusters .",
    "we discuss the possible implications of our results for the variability of the agn power during a cluster s lifetime in section  [ sec : results2 ] , and summarize our conclusions in section  [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "from the relative abundance of o , si and fe , @xcite have shown that snia dominate the iron enrichment in these abundance peaks .",
    "after removing the contribution from snii thought to originate from the early formation of the bcg as well as the background abundance from other galaxies , the remaining central iron excess originates mainly from snia and stellar winds of the central bcg .",
    "following the work of @xcite , we estimate the contribution of snia as , @xmath17 with @xmath18 the present supernova rate in snu ( supernov per century and per @xmath19 ) , @xmath20 the iron yield per snia , @xmath21 the blue luminosity density , t the cosmic time , @xmath22 the current age of the universe and @xmath23 the exponent which describes how the supernov rate increased in the past .",
    "the wind contribution is taken from @xcite , @xmath24 with @xmath25 the mean iron mass fraction in the stellar winds of an evolved population , @xmath26 the present star mass loss rate of a @xmath27 old population and , @xmath28 specifying the time evolution of the star mass loss rate .",
    "the hidden parameter here is @xmath29 , which is the age of the bcg .",
    "eq.[eqsnia ] and eq.[eqwinds ] are indeed only valid from @xmath30 to @xmath31 .",
    "before the formation of the galaxy , the production of metals is of course assumed to be null .",
    "we assume a @xcite profile typical of elliptical galaxies , @xmath32 where @xmath33 and @xmath34 is the effective radius containing half of the projected luminosity .",
    "we constrain the parameters @xmath18 , @xmath23 and @xmath29 so that the total observed amount of iron @xmath35 equals to the total amount of iron from the model inside the radius corresponding to the last bin of the abundance observations ( located at a radius @xmath36 ) . using this normalization procedure",
    "makes the resulting abundance profile quite insensitive to the particular values of our poorly known parameters because the only important ingredient for our purpose is the light profile .",
    "for example , varying @xmath23 between @xmath37 and @xmath38 changes the final abundance by only a few percent ( with the diffusion coefficients suggested by @xcite ) .",
    "@xcite suggest a value of @xmath23 between @xmath39 and @xmath38 , we pick a value of @xmath40 ( that is the time dependence snia iron injection and wind iron injection are the same ) .",
    "in this way , we factorize the time dependence and adopt a new simple expression ,    @xmath41    with @xmath28 and @xmath42 an effective supernov rate which includes the wind contribution .",
    "this effective supernov rate will be determined directly from the observed mass of iron and is no longer a free parameter .",
    "the advantage of using eq.[eqinj ] is that our problem of metal production and transport depend now linearly on @xmath42 .",
    "we therefore do nt need to run our solver for the transport equation multiple times to get the right @xmath18 . instead",
    ", we run our solver once and then adjust the value of @xmath43 afterwards ( thereby multiplying the abundance profile by a constant ) to match the total observed iron mass .",
    "the last parameter is the age of the bcg , which affects our results to some degree since an older galaxy allows more time for iron production and diffusion .",
    "a typical galaxy age is given by the stellar population of the bcg of order @xmath44  gyr @xcite .",
    "we adopt a fixed age in this range for all our clusters of @xmath45gyr .",
    "the metal enrichment model is now entirely determined by the observational data @xmath46 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "we assume that there is steady - state convection in the icm as described by the agn - driven convection model of @xcite .",
    "metals in the icm are then advected as a passive scalar by the turbulent flow .",
    "the advection equation for the transport of metals is given by , @xmath47 with @xmath48 the gas mass density , @xmath49 the mass fraction of iron , and @xmath50 the velocity field given by the agn - driven convection model .",
    "using mixing length theory and assuming spherical symmetry and a statistical steady state , we average equation  ( [ eq : psd ] ) to obtain the equation @xmath51\\label{eqdiff},\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath52 indicates an ensemble average , @xmath53 is the mass accretion rate which is independent of the radius and is equal to the bondi rate near the center ( at @xmath54  kpc ) , @xmath55 is the above metal production rate from eq.[eqinj ] , @xmath56 is the gas density , @xmath57 is the mass fraction of iron , @xmath58 is the diffusion coefficient , @xmath59 is the mixing length , and @xmath60 is the radial component of the turbulent velocity from the mixing - length - theory - based agn - driven convection model , as calculated by @xcite .",
    "the factors 0.5 and 0.4 are choosen to be consistent with the value used by @xcite for the different energy fluxes .",
    "the factor of  @xmath61 in equation  ( [ eq : defd ] ) is much larger than the numerical coefficient in equation  8 of @xcite , which reads @xmath62 .",
    "however , in this last equation , @xmath63 is the rms value of the full velocity vector , not just its radial component .",
    "similarly , @xmath64 is the full correlation length of the turbulence , whereas the mixing length  @xmath65 is just the radial component of the typical displacement of a fluid element before it is mixed into the surrounding fluid .",
    "( the quantity  @xmath66 accounts for the possible reduction in  @xmath67 if the motions are oscillatory and only weakly turbulent . ) if one sets @xmath68 and @xmath69 , then @xmath70 in equation  ( [ eq : defd ] ) , which is similar to equation  8 of @xcite .",
    "it should also be noted that if we were to choose a smaller numerical constant in equation  ( [ eq : defd ] ) and throughout the mixing - length model of @xcite , the resulting turbulent velocities in the model would become larger so that the energy fluxes and convective heating were still able to compensate for radiative cooling .",
    "the resulting value of  @xmath71 would not be greatly altered , since it is closely tied to the rate of convective heating , which is fixed in the agn - convection model by the requirement that heating balance cooling in steady state .",
    "the evolution of the abundance depends on two terms .",
    "the first term is related to the accretion rate @xmath53 and corresponds to an inward advection of the abundance profile at a speed @xmath72 . if we were to assume a large accretion rate as in the cooling - flow model ( e.g. , @xmath73",
    "m@xmath74yr@xmath13 ) the accretion of low - abundance gas from larger radius would destroy the central abundance excess @xcite .",
    "however , in the agn - driven convection model , @xmath75 , and the effect of inflow is small except within the central few  kpc , where the @xmath76  dependence of @xmath77 causes @xmath78 to become  large .",
    "the second term corresponds to diffusion resulting from the random turbulent velocity field .",
    "this term dominates and smoothes the abundance profile on a scale @xmath79^{0.5}~\\textrm{kpc}$ ] , which is comparable to the typical half - mass radius of the central iron excesses .",
    "we have solved eq.[eqdiff ] taking a null initial abundance and assuming a null second derivative of the iron abundance profile for the boundary conditions .",
    "the discretization of the advection part does nt require any artificial diffusion since the physical diffusion dominates for our case .",
    "we have run our code to compute the iron abundance profile of 8 cooling - core clusters .",
    "our sample consists of 8 cooling - core clusters for which we have the turbulent velocity profile from the agn - driven convection model @xcite : virgo , abell 262 , sersic 159 - 03 , abell 4059 , hydra a , abell 496 , abell 1795 and perseus .",
    "the redshifts of these clusters are taken from @xcite .",
    "the properties of these clusters and their brightest cluster galaxies ( bcgs ) are summarized in table [ data ] and table [ data2 ] .",
    "we use the current @xmath80cdm cosmology ( @xmath81  km.s@xmath13.mpc@xmath13 , @xmath82 and @xmath83 ) .",
    "the photometric properties we are interested in are the total luminosity @xmath46 , and the effective radius @xmath34 , which contains half of the projected flux .",
    "we get the name of the brightest cluster galaxies ( bcg ) in each cluster from @xcite and the ned database , and then compute the total blue luminosity using the hyperleda database @xcite proceeding as follows .",
    "we take the apparent corrected blue magnitude of the bcgs , compute the luminosity distance , and the associated distance modulus from our redshift and the @xmath80cdm cosmology .",
    "we finally compute the blue absolute magnitude , and the blue luminosity assuming @xmath84 .",
    "finding the effective radius is more challenging .",
    "we use three different sources : @xcite ( perseus , abell 1795 , and virgo ) , @xcite ( abell 262 and abell 496 ) and hyperleda ( hydra a , sersic 159 - 03 , and abell 4059 ) . in these references an r@xmath85 law @xcite",
    "is adjusted to the observed profile from which the best fit effective radius ( or the effective surface brightness in hyperleda ) is deduced .",
    "we also convert to our cosmology using the ratio of angular diameter distance for our cosmology and redshift to the angular diameter distance for the authors cosmology and redshifts .",
    "the results for @xmath34 and @xmath86 are shown in table [ data ] .",
    "we note that we neglect the cores observed on small scales @xcite , the deviation from the r@xmath85 law @xcite on intermediate scale , the large envelopes observed on large scales @xcite and the ellipticity of the profiles .",
    "we do not hide here that the uncertainties on @xmath34 and @xmath87 are important .",
    "fortunately , the result on the shape does nt depend on @xmath87 ( due to our renormalization procedure ) and has only a little dependency on @xmath34 for most of the clusters because the diffusion scale is larger than @xmath34 .",
    "we take the eight clusters in our sample to have the density profiles and ( as discussed above ) turbulent - velocity profiles obtained from the agn - driven convection model of @xcite .",
    "the model density profiles are very similar to the observations of @xcite , as shown in figure  1 of @xcite .",
    "we note that the agn - driven - convection - model solutions were obtained by varying the size of the cosmic - ray acceleration region in the model in order to achieve a best - fit to the observed density and temperature profiles of the eight clusters in our sample .",
    "the model solutions were therefore not fine - tuned to solve the independent problem we are investigating now ; the shapes of the abundance profiles . from the turbulent radial velocity profile @xmath60",
    ", we deduce the diffusion coefficient of eq.[eqdiff ] , @xmath88 .",
    "the profiles of the diffusion coefficients are presented in fig.[dofr ] .",
    "the diffusion coefficients peak around a radius @xmath89 where the diffusion reaches its maximum @xmath90 .",
    "we divide the clusters into 4 levels of diffusion .",
    "virgo and abell 496 have the smallest diffusion coefficients , with @xmath91 .",
    "they are the `` very weak feedback clusters '' .",
    "abell 4059 and abell 262 have small diffusion coefficients ( @xmath92 ) and are called `` weak - feedback clusters '' .",
    "perseus and abell 1795 have intermediate diffusion coefficients ( @xmath93 ) and are called `` moderate feedback clusters '' . finally , hydra a and sersic 159 - 03 have large diffusion coefficients ( @xmath94 ) and are the `` strong - feedback clusters '' .",
    "we summarize the value of @xmath90 and @xmath89 in table [ data2 ] .",
    "we find the observed abundance profiles in the literature ( helped in this way by the bax cluster database @xcite ) .",
    "all the data points come either from chandra or xmm observations .",
    "we converted all the radii to  kpc using the angular diameter distance from @xmath95 cosmology .",
    "finally , we converted all the different solar abundances to the value published by @xcite ( where the solar abundance relative to h is @xmath96 in number ) .",
    "the references used are the following : virgo @xcite , abell 262 @xcite , sersic 159 - 03 @xcite , abell 4059 @xcite , hydra a @xcite , abell 496 @xcite , abell 1795 @xcite , and perseus @xcite .",
    "we include all the observational points with two exceptions .",
    "we neglect the abundance hole observed within the central several kpc in perseus ( 3 points at @xmath97  kpc ) , abell 262 ( 3 points are @xmath97  kpc ) and virgo ( 1 point @xmath98  kpc ) . in the case of perseus",
    ", @xcite mentions that the profile may be affected by the bright compact source in this region .",
    "we also removed the data points that suddenly drop to very low values at large  @xmath15 ( the last point in the case of sersic 159 - 03 and two last points in the case of abell 262 ) .",
    "we also note that we used the deprojected profiles for clusters perseus , virgo , abell 496 and abell 4059 and projected profiles for clusters hydra a , sersic 159 - 03 , abell 262 and abell 1795 because deprojected profiles were not available .",
    "we do not expect this to have a large effect on our conclusions , because for the cases for which we have both projected and deprojected profiles , the two types of profile are similar , with the main difference being that the deprojected profile is more noisy .",
    "the resulting abundance profiles are shown in fig.[abundance ] .",
    "this figure shows that the ranges of values for the abundance profiles are relatively similar .",
    "we note that the normalization of the abundance profile of sersic 159 - 03 is lower than the others .",
    "this lower normalization may be related to the soft x - ray excess , which is most likely of non - thermal origin @xcite and may contribute to the continuum . for @xmath99",
    "kpc a central abundance peak is observed for all eight clusters while at larger radii ( @xmath100  kpc ) , the profiles flatten and reach an asymptotic value of @xmath101 .",
    "this similar shape for all the clusters may indicate a common mechanism for creating the abundance profiles and allows us to decompose the profiles in two parts : a flat contribution and a central excess .",
    "we note that three out of the four highest peaks ( virgo , abell 4059 and abell 262 ) correspond to the clusters with less diffusion ( see fig.[dofr ] in our model ) .    following the work of @xcite",
    ", we subtract a constant value @xmath102 from the observed abundance profiles .",
    "@xmath102 corresponds to the contribution of iron from the background galaxies as well from snii .",
    "our goal is to isolate the central iron excess or more precisely the iron contribution from the bcg itself . indeed , @xcite measured the abundance profiles at large radii for 17 clusters .",
    "they showed that the abundance profiles of all non - cooling - core clusters are consistent with being constant with radius at a value of order 0.2 - 0.4 . on the other hand ,",
    "cooling - core clusters present a peak near the center and an asymptotic value at large radii at the same value of order 0.2 - 0.4 .",
    "moreover , an analysis of the elemental abundance patern in m87 @xcite and sersic 159 - 03 @xcite has shown that snia dominate the metal enrichment in the central region and that their contribution decreases with radius .",
    "these observations support the idea of a background value from snii in galaxies throughout the cluster .    to estimate these background values @xmath102 , we take the average values of the last three points in the vicinity of 100  kpc",
    ". then , to avoid negative abundances , we remove the points were @xmath103 . since the observations of virgo do not reach @xmath12  kpc and seems to be below the other curves at intermediate radii , we choose a typical value @xmath104 .",
    "the last observational points are located at a distance @xmath36 from the center .",
    "the values of @xmath102 and @xmath36 are shown in table [ data2 ] .    from the density profile and the abundance profile , we deduce the",
    "total observed mass of iron in the central excess @xmath35 ( see table [ data ] ) .",
    "this mass is the mass of iron inside @xmath36 . in our model",
    ", we always choose @xmath42 so that the mass of iron inside @xmath36 is also equal to @xmath35 .",
    "we also characterize the width of the abundance profile by computing @xmath105 , the radius which contains half the total observed mass of iron in the central excess ( inside @xmath36 ) .",
    "using the model described in sections  [ sec : model_inj ] and  [ sec : model_diff ] and the parameters from section [ sample ] , we compute numerically the iron abundance profiles for the eight clusters in our sample and compare to observations . for the sake of comparison , we first compute the abundance profile without any diffusion or inflow velocity .",
    "the result is shown as a dashed line in fig.[result1 ] and fig.[result2 ] .",
    "clearly , such profiles are too steep near the center and do not match the observations ( diamonds ) .",
    "these profiles basically show that the observed distributions of iron do not follow the distributions of stars within the bcg galaxies .",
    "this is because the effective radii of the luminosity distribution @xmath34 ( table [ data ] ) are smaller than the observed half iron mass radii @xmath105 ( table [ data2 ] ) ."
