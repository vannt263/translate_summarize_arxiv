    "brillouin scattering originates from the interaction of light with thermal acoustic modes in matter @xcite .",
    "it is often used for the measurements of the velocity and attenuation of these modes in solids and in liquids . in an isotropic medium with a refractive index @xmath0 ,",
    "the interaction of a monochromatic light beam of angular frequency @xmath1 with one acoustic mode of velocity @xmath2 produces a doublet shifted from @xmath1 by @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the velocity of light in vacuum and @xmath5 is the scattering angle .",
    "the fullwidth at half maximum of the brillouin line is related to the attenuation @xmath6 of the mode by @xmath7 .",
    "the common values for the frequency shift @xmath8 range from 1 to 50 ghz , with linewidths @xmath9 usually between 1 mhz and 1 ghz .",
    "thus a resolving power @xmath10 larger than 10@xmath11 is required for the measurement of frequency shifts , while the investigation of linewidths often imposes @xmath12 . in those ranges , fabry - perot ( fp ) interferometers",
    "must be used . in the most common instruments ,",
    "called spectrometers , the light is collected on a single - channel detector , either a photomultiplier or an avalanche photo - diode , and the spectrum is explored by scanning the optical thickness of the fp @xcite .",
    "the use of the spectrometers in brillouin scattering was proposed by cecchi @xcite and chiao and stoicheff @xcite .",
    "the brillouin scattering cross - section is weak , so that the luminosity of the resolving instrument must be high , a requirement which must be taken into account in designing the fp interferometer .",
    "the advent of very sensitive area detectors offers a new possibility . in such instruments ,",
    "the fp is not scanned but the fixed ring pattern is analyzed @xcite .",
    "this requires in particular the use of larger aperture angles on the fp .",
    "another spectroscopic challenge is the contrast of the resolving system .",
    "the above orders of magnitude show that the weak brillouin doublet at the frequency @xmath13 has to be studied in the tail of the elastic scattering at frequency @xmath1 .",
    "the intensity of the latter , often arising from unavoidable parasitic light , is usually several orders of magnitude larger than that of the brillouin line .",
    "the contrast of a single - pass fp with reasonable values of the reflection coefficient of the coatings is limited to around 10@xmath14 , which often implies the use of a multi - pass configuration @xcite .",
    "a specific problem in brillouin scattering originates from the aperture of the scattered beam . from the above expression",
    ", it is seen that @xmath15 depends on the scattering angle @xmath5 , meaning that the light scattered in each elementary solid angle changes in frequency . when the light emitted by the whole aperture angle is collected on a single detector",
    ", this produces an artificial broadening , and thus an uncertainty on the measurement of both @xmath15 and @xmath16 .",
    "this problem is particularly important for the measurement of small linewidths or when small scattering volumes and thus large apertures are used , such as in confined media ( _ e.g. _ optical fibers or thin films ) or in micro - brillouin set - ups . in this paper",
    ", we present a new optical arrangement which provides an efficient solution to this problem .",
    "in the following , the instrument using an area detector is called a spectrograph . a typical optical arrangement used in brillouin scattering for such instruments",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]a . in this configuration",
    "the scattering volume is imaged on the sensitive surface of the detector . in this case",
    "the light scattered in the whole aperture angle by an elementary volume of the sample is collected on one channel of the detector , leading to the artificial broadening described above . in our arrangement ,",
    "shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , the light scattered in a given direction by the whole scattering volume , _",
    "i.e. _ a parallel beam defined by polar coordinates ( @xmath17 ) is focused on one channel of the detector .",
    "therefore , this single channel receives brillouin scattering emitted with a single scattering angle @xmath5 .",
    "of course , @xmath5 now changes from one channel to the other one , but the integration over the variation of @xmath5 in the scattering aperture is avoided .",
    "the variation of @xmath5 between channels can easily be taken into account in the data treatment . in order to ensure the quality of the analysis , the etendue in which the scattered light is collected must be defined precisely . in the arrangement shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1]b , the sample is placed at the focus of the first lens .",
    "a diaphragm d@xmath18 at the second focus of this lens limits the solid angle emitted by each scattering volume . by this arrangement ,",
    "each point in the scattering volume scatters in the same solid angle .",
    "the diaphragm d@xmath18 is imaged on the area detector . on the other hand ,",
    "the scattering volume is imaged on the surface used of the fp , limited by a diaphragm d@xmath19 . the diaphragms d@xmath18 and d@xmath19 define the scattering etendue .",
    "it is also important for the data treatment to know precisely the polar coordinates ( @xmath17 ) of the light collected on each individual detector .",
    "this imposes to minimize geometrical aberrations .",
    "( color online ) a ) typical optical arrangement used in brillouin spectrometers .",
    "the scattering volume is imaged on the detector .",
    "b ) optical arrangement proposed in our brillouin spectrograph .",
    "the light scattered in a given direction by the whole scattering volume is focused on one channel of the detector.,width=264 ]    it has been shown that , in high resolution brillouin scattering measurements , a confocal fp @xcite must be used @xcite . however , with the high contrast needed for most experiments , the confocal fp which can not be used practically in multi - pass must be combined with a plane fp in a tandem configuration . for simplicity , we concentrate here to a first spectrograph configuration using a multi - pass plane fp . in fact , it has been shown that for high contrast , the multi - pass configuration has a much higher luminosity than an increase of the reflection coefficient in a single - pass fp @xcite .    with standard 2-inches mirrors in a multi - pass configuration ,",
    "the surface used in each pass is limited practically to a circle of 10 mm diameter . on the other hand ,",
    "if we want to cover for instance a spectral domain of 10 ghz by the angular dispersion of the fp , a half - aperture angle of nearly 6 mrad must be allowed .",
    "the corresponding etendue is @xmath20 m@xmath21 , which must be collected from the scattering volume .",
    "when this etendue is imaged with that scattered by the sample , it must be kept in mind that the flux collected at constant etendue of the spectrograph increases linearly with the magnification @xmath22 of the whole optical collection system , thus encouraging the use of high @xmath22 .",
    "if we take for example @xmath23 , the diameter of the scattering surface is @xmath24 mm and the half scattering angle is 0.3 rad . with such large apertures ,",
    "the first collecting lens in the optical arrangement will not be working in the gauss approximation .",
    "we must also consider that when the plane fp is used with large incidence angles , the so - called `` walk - off '' effect must be taken into account @xcite : each double reflection of an optical ray with an angle @xmath25 inside the fp of thickness @xmath26 induces a lateral shift equal to @xmath27 .",
    "for large values of @xmath25 , the number of multiple reflections allowed can be limited by the geometry of the fp arrangement .",
    "practically , the transmission function is no longer an airy profile , but a function somehow broader which must be calculated for each value of @xmath25 in the data treatment .",
    "schematic representation of the brillouin spectrograph .",
    "l : lens ; mm : mobile mirror ; m : mirror ; sh : shutter ; d : diaphragm ; nf : neutral filter ; tcc : truncated corner cube ; cc : corner cube ; if : interference filter.,width=321 ]    a schematic representation of our device is shown in fig . [ fig2 ] .",
    "the source is a single - frequency argon - ion laser .",
    "we use the line at 514.5 nm . in the experiments described below",
    ", the power was equal to 200 mw .",
    "the beam is focused on the sample in order to reduce the diameter of the incident beam to the appropriate value .",
    "two possible scattering geometries , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , are shown .",
    "we choose for the collecting system a magnification @xmath30 .",
    "this is realized practically by two telescopic arrangements .",
    "the sample is located at the focus of the first lens l@xmath31 .",
    "the first telescopic system comprises the lenses l@xmath31 , a gradium lens with a focal length @xmath32 = 125 mm and l@xmath33 , with @xmath34 = 500 mm .",
    "the value of @xmath32 must be large enough to allow the use of standard sample environments .",
    "the second telescopic system is made of lenses l@xmath35 , a second gradium lens ( @xmath36 = 40 mm ) , and l@xmath37 ( @xmath38 = 500 mm ) . the focuses of l@xmath33 and l@xmath35 coincide on the diaphragm d@xmath31 . in practice ,",
    "d@xmath18 and d@xmath31 define the scattering etendue .",
    "all the lenses in the instrument are plane - convex .",
    "finally , the area detector is located at the focus of the lens l@xmath39 . in this way , both the ring figure of the fp and the diaphragm d@xmath18 are imaged on the detector surface . in order to minimize the divergence of the beam across the 4-pass fp",
    ", the image of d@xmath31 is placed between the second and the third pass .",
    "the area detector is an andor dv434 ccd with 1024@xmath401024 pixels cooled by a 4-stage peltier refrigerator at a temperature of -70@xmath41c .",
    "the dark count is about 6e@xmath42/pixel / hour .",
    "the total area is around 13 @xmath40 13 mm@xmath21 . in order to cover reasonably this area",
    "we take @xmath43 = 1000 mm .",
    "we have chosen to use a 4-pass fp in order to have a contrast large enough .",
    "on the other hand , we want to be able to adapt the resolving power by changing the distance @xmath26 between plates .",
    "these two constraints forbid the use of a solid etalon or of a fixed spacer between plates .",
    "the appropriate configuration in this case is that proposed by sandercock @xcite . in this system ,",
    "the scan is realized by displacement of one of the plates without loss of parallelism .",
    "the orientation of one of the plates can be adjusted to optimize this parallelism .",
    "the drawback of such a system is that it must be continuously adjusted , which impose to realize multiple storing periods separated by an optimization procedure .",
    "the most important point is that the thickness of the fp must be kept constant during the whole recording of the spectrum . to that purpose ,",
    "we use an auxiliary frequency - modulated beam in which a line shifted by electro - optic modulation at a frequency @xmath44 near @xmath45 is produced @xcite .",
    "this `` regulation '' beam is also shown in fig .",
    "a set of mobile mirrors , mm@xmath18 , mm@xmath31 and mm@xmath33 directs the incident beam in the electro - optic cell , a resonant cavity containing a linbo@xmath33 crystal excited by an electromagnetic microwave generator . the modulated light is then directed to the fp in normal incidence , and finally to a photomultiplier .",
    "the feedback system optimizes the transmission of the modulated light at frequency @xmath46 or @xmath47 , by acting on the thickness @xmath26 and on the orientation of one of the plates .",
    "the frequency of this modulated light is transmitted in normal incidence by the fp , defining a frequency origin for the ring pattern .",
    "thus the choice of the value of the difference @xmath48 will fix the radius of the ring on the area detector to the appropriate value .",
    "the ring pattern is then calibrated in frequency when the distance between l@xmath39 and the area detector is known .",
    "presently , we are working on another regulation system in which the photomultiplier is replaced by an area detector . in this case",
    "we choose @xmath49 , and the adjustment is monitored by the radius and the intensity of the ring on this auxiliary area detector .",
    "the principle of the data treatment consists in considering each parallel beam characterized by @xmath50 emitted by the whole scattering volume .",
    "the central frequency @xmath51 of the brillouin line is calculated from the sound velocity @xmath2 , taken as a free parameter in the fitting procedure .",
    "the linewidth @xmath16 of the brillouin profile is the second fitting parameter . in practice",
    ", @xmath51 changes by about 10 % over the whole detected brillouin annulus , and thus the frequency dependence of @xmath16 can be neglected in regard of the resolution of the instrument . in our 4-pass arrangement",
    ", this parallel beam reaches the diaphragm d@xmath19 located between the second and the third passes under angles ( @xmath25 , @xmath52 ) which must be calculated .",
    "those angles define the transmission of the 4-pass fp for each frequency @xmath53 . at this stage ,",
    "the walk - off effect , depending not only on ( @xmath25 , @xmath52 ) but also on the coordinates ( @xmath54 ) at which each elementary beam reaches d@xmath19 , can be taken into account . integrating over @xmath53 , the intensity received by a given pixel of the area detector is obtained .",
    "( color online ) calculated incident angle @xmath25 on the fp interferometer as a function of the angle @xmath55 of a beam emitted by the scattering volume ( circles ) .",

    "we have tested the relation between the angle @xmath55 at the scattering volume assumed to be a point on the optical axis , and the angle @xmath25 for the same ray impinging the fp interferometer .",
    "of course , for a perfect optical system in the gauss approximation , @xmath57 .",
    "the calculated @xmath25 _ vs _ @xmath55 is plotted in fig .",

    "the departure , reaching only 0.4 % at the largest angles , can be taken into account in the data treatment .",
    "( color online ) number of reflected beams in the fp interferometer _ vs _ incident angle @xmath25 for two thicknesses @xmath26 .",
    "the dashed line at @xmath58 sets the minimum number of interfering beams to maintain both the finesse and the transmission.,width=321 ]    another important check is the influence of the walk - off on the transmission of each elementary beam . as an example",
    ", we have calculated the number of reflected beams as a function of @xmath25 for the beam emitted by the geometrical center of the scattering volume , reaching a fp interferometer limited by a diaphragm of 10 mm diameter .",
    "the results are plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] for two different thicknesses , 2 and 10 mm .",
    "it shows that the number of reflected beams is large enough to keep the 1-pass finesse @xmath59 of the fp over the whole aperture for @xmath26 = 2 mm , and up to angles @xmath60 3 mrad for @xmath26 = 10 mm . in practice ,",
    "the effect of the walk - off can be fully calculated , taking into account the geometry of the 4-pass fp interferometer .",

    "the profile deduced from the analysis of this ring has a full - width at half - maximum ( fwhm ) equal to about 750 @xmath61 10 mhz , which corresponds to a finesse @xmath62 100 .",
    "this is in excellent agreement with the value calculated for a 4-pass fp with a reflectivity @xmath63 = 0.94 and a flatness of @xmath64 .",
    "the finesse obtained with a spectrograph using an area detector is higher than that of the same fp in a scanning configuration , as the broadening of the transmission function by the aperture supported by the pinhole is avoided .    to demonstrate the efficiency of the spectrograph , we have performed experiments in the right - angle configuration , rather than in backscattering , as it is well - known that the parasitic effect due to the angular aperture of the scattered beam is minimum in the latter .",

    "the measured values are @xmath74 ghz and @xmath75 ghz which compare very well with values reported in a recent study of the dynamic structure factor of glycerol in the backscattering geometry using a sandercock - type fp - interferometer @xcite .",
    "using an original optical arrangement , we have realized a brillouin spectrograph in which the broadening by finite aperture is fully eliminated .",
    "this instrument was successfully used with the scattered beam having an aperture as large as 0.3 rad . the 4-pass configuration for the plane fp provides contrast high enough that weak signals such as transverse brillouin lines are clearly measured without parasitic elastic scattering background .",
    "the finesse is found equal to 100 as expected .",
    "the luminosity of the spectrograph is very high , as already emphasized by several authors using area detectors @xcite .",
    "as all spectral intervals are recorded simultaneously rather than scanned , the power received on the detector is roughly multiplied by a factor equal to the finesse .",
    "this instrument will allow new developments in applications of brillouin scattering which were difficult up to now .",
    "the accuracy of frequency measurements in experiments were large collecting apertures must be used , such as micro - brillouin and investigations of small scattering volumes , will be greatly enhanced . both the increased accuracy and the short exposure times",
