    "since @xmath80 is outerplanar , it is easy to check that  @xmath78 is planar .    if @xmath423 and @xmath91 is an @xmath278-path in @xmath78 but @xmath424 , then @xmath425 .",
    "thus the length of @xmath91 is at least 4 .",

    "notice that one can construct the graph @xmath80 of figure  [ five ] ( and the graphs @xmath429 for @xmath325 ) by using operations similar to those of used in the hajs construction  @xcite .",

    ", we see that one of the apex vertices has been identified , while those that correspond to @xmath443 have been joined by an edge .",
    "however , the operation of deletion , used in the hajs construction , is not used in our construction .",
    "this is mainly because we want to obtain a graph with chromatic number strictly larger than that of the parts it is formed of .",
    "in this paper we give bounds on the chromatic number of exact distance graphs for some classes of graphs . in general ,",
    "the difference between the best lower and upper bounds are still quite large , so we ca nt really claim we have an insight of what the correct best possible bounds are .",
    "a second feature of our upper bounds is that they are expressed in terms of generalised colouring numbers , and hence are increasing with the distance .",

    "this feature was noticed earlier for planar graphs .",
    "the following problem , which is attributed to van den heuvel and naserasr , appears in  @xcite ( see also  @xcite ) .      of course , the same question can be asked for graph classes with bounded tree - width and graphs that exclude a complete minor .",

    "note that this also means that @xmath174 is unbounded for those graphs , since , as remarked earlier , @xmath452 for any graph  @xmath6 .",
    "the one , trivial , example for which we can answer these questions is for graphs  @xmath6 without @xmath439-minor .",

    "there are constructions that show that this constant must grow with  @xmath1 , even if @xmath54 is the class of outerplanar graphs .",
