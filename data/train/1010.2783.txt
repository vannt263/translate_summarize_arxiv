    "recently with the constant augmentation in the number of internet users as well as the growth in the complexity of such networks , new security problems have appeared in the scene and there is a lack of adequate security methods for facing attacks under this new setting .",
    "these new environments are for instance the p2p networks , sensor networks , social nets or wireless networks , where information is to be stored , generated and retrieved .",
    "so under this new environments it can be very important to study and model how the information is spread or how to keep the spreading of a virus under control in such a way that the information still being useful under these vulnerable circumstances .",
    "in @xcite it is studied the problem of information survival threshold in sensor and p2p networks , modeling the problem as a non - linear dynamical system and using fixed point stability theorems , and obtain a closed form solution that depends on an additional parameter , the largest eigenvalue of the dynamical system matrix . in the sensor networks for instance",
    ", the nodes can loss their communications links and the nodes can stop working because of system failure produced by a virus infection and quarantine process or a system maintenance procedure . under such conditions they try to answer the following question :    * problem : * _ under what conditions a datum can survive in a sensor network ? _ given that the nodes as well as the links can fail with some probability the obvious model can be a markov chain , but such a model can grow in complexity very quickly because the number of possible states becomes @xmath0 where @xmath1 is the number of states . to avoid this mathematical problem ,",
    "one alternative is to model the system as a non - linear dynamical system .",
    "recently they have appeared in the conferences and journal articles some very interesting and relevant research articles about the virus spread behaviour in a p2p network or in scale free nets such as the web . in @xcite",
    "the authors study the communication mechanisms for gossip based protocols .",
    "another very recent and interesting work on how to distribute antidotes for controlling the epidemics spread is presented in @xcite . in this research",
    "the authors analyse the problem under the approach of contact processes @xcite on a finite graph and obtain very interesting and rigorous results . concerning the properties that arise in the random graphs , such as the existence of a _ giant component _ , _ percolation _ phenomena , node degree distribution and _ small world _",
    "phenomena , and that are the base of many recent works on virus spread on networks , we can mention @xcite as well as @xcite @xcite @xcite and @xcite . concerning the subject on mathematical modeling of epidemic spreading",
    "we should mention the outstanding work done by romualdo pastor - satorras and alessandro vespignani in @xcite . in the present work we will take as source of inspiration @xcite . in @xcite",
    "the authors implement some experiments on several real sensor and p2p networks ( from intel , mit , gnutella , and others ) to show the accuracy of their method . in this work",
    "it is claimed that their method is not only applicable to sensor nets but it is also applicable to many more settings where a piece of information may be replicated across faulty links and faulty nodes .",
    "the authors establish a survivability condition that produce a bound in the design of distributed systems , allowing to :    * estimate the most economic retransmission rates for a datum to survive in a sensor network . *",
    "decide which nodes can be removed while still remaining above the survivability threshold in a sensor network . *",
    "virus _ as _ datum _ to extinction for anti - virus protection , by deciding how often to quarantine nodes and how long they should be kept down . * propagate and maintain information ( news , rumors , etc . )",
    "so , this work is closely related with the areas of gossip based protocols , epidemiology and computer security .",
    "gossip - based protocols on networks , whose related graphs have dynamic presence of nodes , that keep some level of state consistency have been proposed in @xcite .",
    "the basic underlying idea of the gossip protocols is that at each time step each node @xmath2 chose to communicate with a node @xmath3 generally following a random rule , exchanging information during a period of time , spreading it in the system in the same way as the virus are spread .",
    "a fundamental issue in this kind of protocols is how the underlying gossip low level mechanism affects the ability to design efficient high level gossip protocol algorithms . in @xcite",
    "the authors show a fundamental limitation on the power of the commonly used uniform gossip mechanism for solving nearest - resource location problems .",
    "they show as well that very efficient protocols for this problem can be designed using a non - uniform spatial gossip mechanism .",
    "the gossip - based distributed protocol algorithms obtained in @xcite for complex problems for a set of nodes in euclidean space are implemented by constructing an approximated minimum spanning tree .      with the increasing importance and presence of sensor as well as p2p networks ,",
    "networks have a high level of congestion and because of that the theory concerning information survivability becomes very important .",
    "one source of inspiration for mathematical modeling problems of information survivability in this kind of networks is the _",
    "epidemiology_.    the _ epidemiology _ community has developed several stochastic models for studying the spread and die - out of diseases in a population .",
    "the two most relevant ones are the sir and sis models .",
    "both are stochastic models of the spread of disease through a population , where the _ susceptible _ nodes can get _ infected _ on contact with _ infected _ neighbors .",
    "the _ infected _ hosts eventually die ( in the sir model ) or recover and become _ susceptible _ again ( in the sis model ) .",
    "the point of view adopted in @xcite was the sis model .",
    "under this model a node is _ susceptible _ to a data item when it is online and under normal operation .",
    "when the nodes start to fail , they become _ immune _ during their failure , and later they become _ susceptible _ again when they are back online . some results obtained in @xcite",
    "are very useful to analyze the survival of a infection in a population , based on the graph theory results similar to the ones mentioned in @xcite . in computer security one of the important issues that have been studied under sis and sir infection spreading mathematical models are the virus propagation as well as worms on internet , from where , the exponential spread of them and the _ epidemic thresholds _ can be estimated @xcite,@xcite , @xcite .",

    "the main contribution of @xcite is an accurate approximation , using a non - linear dynamical system of only @xmath1 variables .",

    "thus :    @xmath36    @xmath37      in @xcite , experimental results have been obtained under fast extinction conditions that accurately correspond to what their model predicts .",
    "the authors claim that the accuracy of their model predictions are due to the _ mixing properties _ of real networks . for the sake of completeness we will state the main results in @xcite and to show how some of them are obtained because our own results will be obtained by applying the same procedures .

    "the state probabilities become stable , then @xmath64 and @xmath65 . then simplifying the notation by dropping the subindex and the time parameter we can state the following equations system : @xmath66    after algebraic simplification",

    "however , it is interesting to analyse the ergodicity behaviour of the markov chains associated inside each node .",
    "we have done this by the calculation of the corresponding z - transform of the associated matrix and performing the following steps :    * we obtain the transition matrix @xmath74 @xmath75 *   we calculate the z - transform of the matrix @xmath76 , that is @xmath77 * the inverse matrix @xmath78 of @xmath79 is obtained * the inverse z - transform is applied to @xmath78 , obtaining + @xmath80 + this equation can be written as a sum of two matrices @xcite , @xmath38 that corresponds to the steady behavior and @xmath81 that represents the transient behavior of the markov chain , that is + @xmath82 , + where @xmath83 and @xmath84 are constants .",
    "based on this procedure we obtained the ergodicity condition , that is , @xmath85 what assures the convergence to a steady state no matter what the initial state was .",
    "+ all the calculations were made using mathematica and the ergodicity condition expression obtained is given by + @xmath86 + it s worthy to notice that the ergodicity of the markov chain depends on the values of the transition probabilities involved .",
    "we should also mention that the calculations of this analysis are an additional source of difficulty .",
    "the more states the markov chain have , the more complex become the algebraic manipulation and z - transforms .",
    "so , it is not a surprise that the markovian analysis was avoided in @xcite and the choice was the dynamical systems approach .",
    "the model described in subsection [ virus2 ] and that constitutes the core of the results obtained in @xcite has as main purpose to estimate the threshold condition under which the propagation of a virus in a p2p network decays exponentially .",
    "this last question implies that for keeping the network below the threshold just mentioned , the protocols have to disconnect temporarily some nodes , fix the problem and reboot them .",
    "this method is very efficient for stopping the propagation of the virus . in this way",
    "the number of virus carriers decays exponentially .",
    "let us assume that at the same time we need to propagate an alarm signal warning about the presence of a worm virus or an antidote @xcite in a p2p network .",
    "then in these cases we need that the network operates over the estimated threshold .",
    "so we are in a situation where the threshold conditions are antagonist and that can happen in a real world setting . under such circumstances",
    "the question is _ how to keep a datum and at the same time avoid the virus spreading?_. our hypothesis is that it will depend on the proportion of virus messages versus warning messages .",
    "for this reason we will propose a new model that will take into account this situation .",
    "the previous and the new additional symbols are listed in table 2 .",

    "let the vector @xmath114 be the concatenation of the previous vectors and let @xmath115 be the vector @xmath116 evaluated at the fixed point .",
    "then , the entire system can be described by @xmath117 where @xmath118    now , following @xcite , let us define the the jacobian matrix of the system , @xmath119 as @xmath120_{ij}=\\frac{\\partial f_i(\\vec{\\mathbf{v}}(t-1))}{\\partial \\vec{\\mathbf{v}}(t-1 ) } .\\ ] ]    in order to explore the asymptotic stability of fixed points and according to @xcite we will have to take into account the value of the function @xmath119 in these points in our case , we obtain the @xmath121 jacobian matrix    @xmath122\\ ] ]    where each block @xmath123 is a @xmath39 matrix whose elements are given by    @xmath124    and the others are    @xmath125    @xmath63    @xmath126    @xmath127    @xmath128    once we have calculated the jacobian matrix of the system we can extend the results of * lemma 2*. that is , if the largest eigenvalue ( in magnitude ) is less than one then it is assured that the system is asymptotically stable in the fixed point @xmath129 and the dynamical system will exponentially tend to the fixed point whatever was the initial state .",
    "those interested in the detailed proof of this * lemma 2 * can consult the appendix of @xcite .",
    "until now , we have theoretically described the behaviour of the net .     vs time ( simulation epochs ) in chakrabarti model under the threshold .",

    "values for @xmath136 and @xmath131     vs time ( simulation epochs ) in our model above the threshold .",
    "values for @xmath136 and @xmath131    using the dynamical systems approach we have been able to predict the conditions ( a threshold ) under which fast extinction is reached by using a limited set of parameters that assures the we will converge to a fixed point .    in order to complete the study of our model and compare its performance with the chakrabarti model , we have made different simulations corresponding to the cases in which we are under , on and above the threshold values established in the previous section .    for this end",
    ", we have randomly generated the adjacency matrix corresponding to a thirty node graph .",
    "we have taken , for the sake of comparison , the same set of parameters that appears in section 4 of @xcite , that is , @xmath137 and @xmath138 .",
    "additionally , we used the different values of @xmath139 and @xmath140 proposed in @xcite corresponding to p2p gnutella data sets .",
    "we have fixed @xmath141 and @xmath142 and we have started with six infected nodes that we choose randomly . the number of time steps have been fixed in our simulation to one and three hundred .    in figures [ chakraunder ] and [ ourunder ] it is shown that if the settings of the parameters values fulfil the fast extinction condition then the same result is obtained in both models .",
    "we can have a diverse set of parameters values as long as we are under the threshold condition for achieving fast extinction .    in figures [ chakraon ] and [ ouron ]",
    "we show that if the set of parameters are combined in such a way that they give exactly the threshold value the fast extinction is achieved again in both models but in this case the fast extinction is slower than in the first case .",
    "when the parameters values are combined in such a way that we are beyond the threshold value then fast extinction is no longer accomplished and the number of carriers grow very fast and eventually the whole set of nodes could become infected .",
    "this behaviour is shown in figures [ chakraabove ] and [ ourabove ] . in this case",
    "it can be observed a slight difference between both models behaviour due to the presence of the parameter @xmath143 .",
    "as we have exposed in the sections corresponding to our proposal , if under our model @xmath144 , our _ fix point and fast extinction condition _ are consistent with those obtained in @xcite . in the other side , if under our model @xmath145 , then the _ fix point and fast extinction condition _ mentioned in the appendix section of @xcite are not longer valid . in this last case the dynamical system becomes nonlinear , and the degree of non - linearity will depend on the topology of the network . in this new setting our @xmath146 parameter",
    "start to play a rle in the virus as well as antidote spreading on the network . in the future we will study this problem .",
    "if we take as starting point this scenario it can be interesting to ask if the system falls in a chaotic regime and if this is the case then how the stability of the network can be re - established . if we want to achieve this state of the system we can recall the synchronization and chaos tools developed in the research field of automatic control .",
    "this is one of the subjects that we will try to explore in the future ."
