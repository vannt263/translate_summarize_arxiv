    "collective spin dynamics in dilute magnetic semiconductors ( dms ) has recently drawn lots of attention.@xcite this field provides an insight into the origins of carrier - induced ferromagnetism in semiconductors @xcite and particular features in the spin excitation spectrum @xcite due to the presence of two spin sub - systems that are dynamically coupled by coulomb - exchange interaction : that of the itinerant carrier and that of the localized magnetic impurities .",
    "the transverse spin excitation spectrum has been theoretically found to be composed of three types of excitations .",
    "these are : two collective spin waves corresponding to itinerant and localized spins precessing in phase or out of phase to each other , and single - particle ( or stoner - like ) excitations of the itinerant carriers.@xcite .",
    "if the dms is in the ferromagnetic state , the in - phase spin wave ( ipw ) becomes the goldstone - like mode with an acoustic type dispersion responsible for long - range spin order in the ground state .",
    "the out of phase spin wave ( opw ) develops an optical branch , with a zone - center energy determined by the strength of coulomb - exchange interaction between carriers and the spins of magnetic impurities .",
    "experimental evidence of the entire spectrum in a ferromagnetic dms like gamnas is not available .",
    "what has been reported so far are features related to the zone - center ipw , dominated by the mn spin precession , its dynamics.@xcite and its ferromagnetic resonance.@xcite we find no experimental data available for the out of phase mode .",
    "indeed , ferromagnetism in gamnas systems requires a high mn concentration , which destroys the periodicity of the crystal potential and smooths out all optical resonances .",
    "more insight into the dms spin excitation spectrum has been gained in cdmnte doped quantum wells ( qw ) , which constitute a clean test - bed system , appropriate to capture general properties of the collective spin dynamics in dms materials .",
    "evidence for carrier - induced ferromagnetism has been found in cdmnte quantum wells doped with holes@xcite . when doped with electrons , due to the very low curie temperature",
    ", only the paramagnetic phase is available to most experiments .",
    "the opw mode dispersion and single - particle excitations have been probed by raman measurements in the paramagnetic state @xcite .",
    "the mixed nature of the ipw and opw waves has been evidenced in the frequency@xcite and time domain@xcite .",
    "neithertheless , there is a lack of a full theoretical description of the spin excitation spectrum in cdmnte qw .",
    "indeed , so far two approaches were followed to describe the spin excitations : in the first one@xcite , the @xmath0-exchange dynamical coupling between mn and electron spins was considered , but the coulomb interaction between electrons was dropped out . in the second@xcite , the reverse point of view was adopted : spin resolved coulomb interaction between electrons was taken into account , but only the static mean - field @xmath1 contribution from the mn was kept to form a highly spin - polarized two dimensional electron gas ( sp2deg ) .",
    "this work fills the gap between the two theoretical approaches , by solving the spin dynamical equations in presence of both the @xmath0-exchange dynamical coupling between mn and electron spins and the coulomb interaction between electrons .",
    "starting from the full dms hamiltonian , the approach combines exact commutation rules and standard generalized random phase approximation ( rpa ) .",
    "we also include the intrinsic damping of the pure electron spin waves due to the delocalized character of the electrons@xcite .",
    "we show that the introduction of coulomb  electron - electron interaction induces strong qualitative changes in the spectrum compared to the approach of ref.@xcite and that inclusion of the intrinsic damping diminishes the strength of the coupling between the two spin subsystems for non - zero wavevectors .",
    "generalization of this model to hole systems might be considered : then one should take into account the fact that the hole spin states are not isotropic .",
    "the paper is divided as follows : in sec .",
    "ii , we detail the hamiltonian of the system and rewrite it in terms of collective variables , in sec .",
    "iii , we use transverse spin dynamics equations to derive spin response functions , and in the last section , we study the spectrum of spin mixed electron - mn modes .",
    "we consider a qw of width @xmath2 containing @xmath3 unpaired@xcite mn spins per unit volume .",
    "the first subband is populated by @xmath4 electrons per unit surface .",
