    "r coronae borealis ( rcb ) stars are hydrogen - deficient carbon ( hdc ) stars that exhibit spectacular ( @xmath1 up to @xmath28 mag ) , aperiodic declines in brightness ( for a review on rcb stars see @xcite ) .",
    "the fading occurs rapidly ( @xmath21 to few weeks ) as new dust is formed in the circumstellar environment , and the recovery is slow , sometimes taking several years , as the new dust is dispersed and removed from the line of sight . at maximum light rcb stars are bright supergiants , which in combination with the large - amplitude photometric variability should make them easy to discover . yet , to date there are only @xmath256 known rcb stars in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "the rarity of these stars suggests that they reflect a very brief phase of stellar evolution , or a bias in rcb star search methods , or both .",
    "the lack of hydrogen and overabundance of carbon in rcb atmospheres implies that rcb stars are in a late stage of stellar evolution , but no consensus has yet emerged regarding their true physical nature .",
    "there are two leading theories for explaining the observed properties of rcb stars : the double degenerate ( dd ) scenario and the final helium shell flash ( ff ) scenario ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the dd scenario posits that rcb stars are the stellar remnant of a carbon  oxygen white dwarf ( wd ) and helium wd merger . in the ff scenario , a thin layer of he in the interior of",
    "the star begins runaway burning , which leads to the rapid expansion of the photosphere shortly before the star becomes a planetary nebula .",
    "there are observational properties of rcb stars that both theories have difficulty explaining @xcite , and conflicting observational evidence supporting aspects of both ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "if , as some of the recent observations suggest , the dd scenario proves correct , then a complete census of galactic rcb stars should be able to calibrate population synthesis models of wd binary systems ( e.g. , @xcite ) , which may improve our understanding of these systems as the progenitors of type ia supernovae . in any event ,",
    "the enigmatic nature of these rare objects , and the opportunity to elucidate the astrophysics of an important late stage of stellar evolution , motivates us to search for additional benchmark exemplars of the class .",
    "based on the detection of rcb stars in the large magellanic cloud ( lmc ) , it is argued in @xcite that there should be @xmath23200 rcb stars in the galaxy . with the actual number of known rcb stars in the milky way roughly two orders of magnitude below this estimate",
    ", this suggests that either thousands of rcb stars remain undetected or the differing star formation environments / histories in the lmc and the milky way result in highly different rcb populations .",
    "an observational bias that preferentially selects warm rcb stars likely contributes to the discrepancy between the predicted and known number of these stars in the galaxy @xcite .",
    "indeed , recent discoveries of rcb stars in the galactic bulge and magellanic clouds ( mcs ) have uncovered more cool , @xmath35000 k , rather than warm , @xmath37000 k , rcb stars @xcite .",
    "the observed correlation between color and @xmath4 , with bluer rcb stars in the mcs being more luminous @xcite , clearly shows that any magnitude - limited survey will have an observational bias towards discovering the intrinsically rarer warm rcb stars",
    ".    there may also be a large population of rcb stars that have colder photospheres than the cool rcb stars : there is one known galactic rcb star , dy persei @xcite , that has @xmath33500 k @xcite .",
    "recent observations of the mcs have identified several dy persei - like stars ( dypers ) while searching for rcb stars @xcite , while @xcite discovered the second known dyper in the milky way using observations of the galactic bulge .",
    "in addition to cooler photospheres , dypers have other properties that differ from rcb stars , which has led to some degree of ambiguity regarding the connection between these two classes ( see e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "dypers and rcb stars both show an overabundance of carbon in their atmospheres and unpredictable , large - amplitude declines in their light curves .",
    "several properties differ between the two , however , for instance , dypers : ( i ) have symmetric declines in their light curves , ( ii ) clearly show @xmath5c in their spectra , ( iii ) are on average @xmath210 times fainter than rcb stars , and ( iv ) may have significant h in their atmospheres .",
    "a detailed examination of the differences in the mid - infrared excesses of rcb stars and dypers in the mcs led to the conclusion in @xcite that dypers are most likely normal carbon stars that experience ejection events rather than an extension of the rcb phenomenon to lower temperature stars .",
    "furthermore , using ogle - iii observations , it is shown in @xcite that several carbon - rich asymptotic giant branch stars ( agbs ) , which have been classified as mira or semi - regular periodic variables on the basis of their light curves , show evidence for dyper - like declines in their light curves .",
    "this leads to the conclusion in @xcite that dypers are heavily enshrouded carbon - rich agb stars that are an extension of typical variables rather than a separate class of variable stars .",
    "nevertheless , all studies of dypers to date have cited a need for more observations , in particular high resolution spectra to conduct detailed abundance analyses , to confirm or deny the possibility that dypers are the low temperature analogs to rcb stars .    over the past decade",
    "the decrease in the cost of large ccds , coupled with a dramatic increase in computer processing power and storage capabilities , has enabled several wide - field , time - domain surveys .",
    "these surveys will continue to produce larger data sets before culminating near the end of the decade with the large synoptic survey telescope ( lsst ; @xcite ) .",
    "this explosion of observations should enable the discovery of the thousands of `` missing '' galactic rcb stars , should they in fact exist .",
    "these new discoveries do not come without a cost , however , as the data rates of astronomical surveys are now becoming enormous . while it was once feasible for humans to visually examine the light curves of all the newly discovered variable stars , as the total number of photometric variables grows to 10@xmath610@xmath7 visual inspection by expert astronomers",
    "becomes intractable .",
    "advanced software solutions , such as machine - learning ( ml ) algorithms , are required to analyze the vast amounts of data produced by current and upcoming time - domain surveys . in an ml approach to classification ,",
    "data from sources of known science class are employed to train statistical algorithms to automatically learn the distinguishing characteristics of each class .",
    "these algorithms generate an optimal predictive model that can determine the class ( or posterior class probability ) of a new source given its observed data .",
    "@xcite presented an end - to - end ml framework for multi - class variable star classification , in which they describe algorithms for feature generation from single - band light curves and outline a methodology for non - parametric , multi - class statistical classification .",
    "in this paper we present the results of a search for new rcb stars and dypers in the galaxy using version 2.3 of the ml catalog presented in @xcite . in ",
    "2 we describe the candidate selection procedure , while  3 describes the new and archival observations of the candidates .",
    "our analysis of the photometric and spectroscopic data is contained in  4 .",
    "the individual stars are examined in further detail in  5 , while we discuss the results in  6 .",
    "our conclusions are presented in  7 .",
    "candidate selection of possible rcb stars was performed using version 2.3 of the machine - learned acvs classification catalog ( http://www.bigmacc.info/[macc ] ; @xcite ) of variable sources cataloged from all - sky automated survey ( asas ; @xcite ) .",
    "full details of the classification procedure can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "briefly , we employ a random forest ( rf ) classifier , which has been shown to provide the most robust results for variable star classification ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , to provide probabilistic classifications for all of the 50,124 sources in asas catalog of variable stars ( acvs ; @xcite ) .",
    "the classification procedure proceeds as follows : for each source in the acvs 71 features are computed , 66 from the asas light curves ( e.g. , period , amplitude , skew , etc . ; for the full list of features we refer the reader to @xcite and references therein ) and 5 color features from optical and near - infrared ( nir ) catalogs .",
    "a training set , upon which the rf classifications will be based , is constructed using light curves from 28 separate science classes , most of which are defined using well studied stars with high precision light curves from the _ hipparcos _ and ogle surveys ( @xcite ) , as well as some visually classified sources from acvs for a few of the classes that are not well represented in _ hipparcos _",
    "the same 71 features are calculated for all the sources in the training set , and the rf classifier uses the separation of the 28 science classes in the multi - dimensional feature space to assign probabilistic classifications to each source in the acvs . in the end ,",
    "the probability of belonging to each individual science class is provided for each acvs source and a post - rf procedure is used to calibrate these probabilities ( meaning that a source with @xmath8 has a @xmath250% chance of actually being a mira ) .",
    "when searching for rcb stars in time - domain survey data , rf classification provides a number of advantages relative to the more commonly used method of placing hard cuts on a limited set of a few features .",
    "many studies have focused on light curves with large amplitude variations and a lack of periodic signal ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "a few recent studies have noted that additional cuts on nir and mid - infrared colors can improve selection efficiency @xcite .",
    "while these surveys have all proven successful , the use of hard cuts may eliminate actual rcb stars from their candidate lists .",
    "hard cuts are not necessary , however , when using a multi - feature rf classifier , which is capable ( in principle ) of capturing most of the photometric behavior of rcb stars ( including the large - amplitude , aperiodic fades from maximum light as well as the periodic variations that occur near maximum light ) .",
    "another general disadvantage in the use of hard cuts for candidate selection of rare sources is that the hard cuts are typically defined by known members of the class of objects for which the search is being conducted .",
    "any biases present in the discovery of the known members of a particular class will then be encoded into the absolute ( i.e. , hard cuts ) classification schema .",
    "this can exclude subclasses of sources that differ slightly from the defining members of a class .",
    "furthermore , new discoveries will be unable to refine the selection criteria since , by construction , they will fall within the same portion of feature space as previously known examples .",
    "the rf classifier produces an estimate of the posterior probability that a source is an rcb star given its light curve and colors .",
    "this allows us to construct a relative ranking of the rcb likelihood for all the sources in acvs . instead of making cuts in feature space , we can search down the ordered list of candidates . in this sense",
    "the rf classifier identifies the sources that are closest to the rcb training set relative to the other classes .",
    "the rf classifier finds the class boundaries in a completely data - driven way , allowing for the optimal use of known objects to search for new candidates in multi - dimensional feature spaces .",
    "this helps to mitigate against biases present in the training set , as classifications are performed using the location of an individual source in the multidimensional feature phase - space volume relative to defined classes in the training set .",
    "the macc rcb training set was constructed using high - confidence positional matches between acvs sources and known rcb stars identified in simbad and the literature . in total",
    "there are 18 cataloged rcb stars that are included in the acvs , which we summarize in table  [ tab : training_set ] .",
    "the light curves of the known rcb stars were visually examined for the defining characteristic of the class : sudden , aperiodic drops in brightness followed by a gradual recovery to pre - decline flux levels .",
    "all of the known rcb stars but one , asas 054503@xmath96424.4 , showed evidence for such behavior .",
    "asas 054503@xmath96424.4 is one of the brightest rcb stars in the lmc ( @xmath10 mag ) , which during quiescence is barely above the asas detection threshold . the light curve for asas 054503@xmath96424.4",
    "does not show a convincing decline from maximum light , and as such we do not include it in the training set .",
    "in addition to the 18 rcb stars in acvs , 7 additional rcb stars are detected in asas with the characteristic variability of the class .",
    "these sources all have clearly variable asas light curves ; their exclusion from the acvs means there is some bias in the construction of that catalog . in order to keep this bias self - consistent the training set for",
    "the macc only included sources from @xcite and supplements from acvs ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we note that a future paper to classify all @xmath212 million sources detected by asas will include all asas rcb stars in its training set ( richards et al .",
    ", in prep ) .",
    "therefore the training set includes 17 rcb stars , which is limited by the coverage and depth of asas , the selection criteria of the acvs , and the paucity of known rcb stars in the galaxy .",
    "there are no known dypers in acvs : only two are known in the galaxy and the dypers in the mcs are fainter than the asas detection limits .",
    "nevertheless , the similarity in the photometric behavior of rcb stars and dypers allows us to use the rcb training set to search for both types of star .",
    "as more galactic rcb stars and dypers are discovered , we will be able to supplement the training set and improve the ability of future iterations of the rf classifier ( see  6.2 ) .",

    "two sources in the training set , sv sge and es aql , are not listed near the top of @xmath13 ranking during cv . for es aql",

    "[ sec : ml ] , one of the major strengths of ml classification is that new discoveries may be fed back into the machinery in order to improve future iterations of the classifier . in an attempt to recover more rcb stars and dypers in the acvs that were missed in our initial search of the macc , we created an augmented rcb training set by adding the eight new rcb stars and dypers identified in this paper to the 17 sources already included in the training set .",
    "this augmented training set should increase the likelihood of discovering new candidates , particularly dypers , of which there were no examples in the original training set .    using the augmented training set we re - ran the rf classifier from @xcite on all the acvs light curves to search for any additional good candidates .",
    "we focus our new search on candidates with a significant change in @xmath13 , which were not examined in the initial search of the macc . in particular , we visually examine the light curves of all sources with @xmath54 , @xmath55 , and @xmath56 . there are a total of 96 sources that meet these criteria , which were not included in the 472 visually inspected sources from the original macc . of these 96 , we conservatively select six as candidate rcb stars or dypers .",
    "one is a highly likely rcb star with multiple declines and asymmetric recoveries , three show evidence for a single decline which is only partially sampled , and two are known carbon stars that are likely semi - regular periodic variables .",
    "we list the candidates in table  [ tab : new_cands ] with brief comments on each and show their light curves in figure  [ fig : aug_lc ] .          restricting our search for bright rcb stars to only those sources in the acvs",
    "has biased the results of our search . as was mentioned in ",
    "[ sec : training_set ] , there are seven known rcb stars that show clear variability in their asas light curves yet were not selected for inclusion in the acvs .",
    "this suggests that several large - amplitude asas variables are missing from the acvs , presumably including a few unknown rcb stars .",
    "this bias can easily be corrected by searching all of asas for rcb stars , however , such a search would include significant new challenges as there are @xmath212 million sources in asas .",
    "in addition , our existing classification framework is not designed to deal with a catalog where the overwhelming majority of sources are not in fact variable .",
    "nevertheless , both of these challenges must be addressed prior to the lsst era .",
    "we have developed frameworks that can ingest millions of light curves and are currently experimenting with methods to deal with non - variable sources , the results of which will be presented in a catalog with classifications for all @xmath212 million sources in asas ( richards et al . , in prep ) .",
    "furthermore , it has been shown that the use of mid - infrared colors is a powerful discriminant when trying to select rcb stars @xcite .",
    "while our use of nir colors is important for selecting rcb stars ( see e.g. , @xcite ) , adding the mid - infrared measurements from the all - sky _ wise _ survey will dramatically improve our purity when selecting rcb candidates as several of the mira and semi - regular variables that served as interlopers in the current search (   [ sec : macc_cands ] ) would be eliminated with the use of mid - infrared colors .",
    "we have used the 71-feature random forest machine - learning acvs classification catalog from @xcite to identify likely dypers and rcb stars in the acvs catalog .",
    "the rf classifier provides several advantages over previous methods to search time - domain survey data for rcb stars and dypers .",
    "previously successful searches for rcb stars have developed a methodology focused on large amplitude variables that do not show strong evidence for periodicity ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while the rf classifier is capable of capturing the large variations and irregular declines observed in rcb stars , the use of many features allows complex behavior , such as the shape of the decline and recovery , to be captured as well .",
    "another advantage of rf classification is that it does not require hard cuts on any individual light curve feature , which can exclude real rcb stars from the final candidate selection .",
    "there are a total of 472 stars with @xmath57 0.1 in version 2.3 of the macc , 15 of which were selected as good rcb or dyper candidates after visual inspection and existing spectroscopic information .",
    "following spectroscopic observations eight of the good candidates were identified as bona fide rcb stars or dypers .",
    "four of these , asas 170541@xmath112650.1 ( gv oph ) , asas",
    "162229@xmath114835.7 ( io nor ) , asas 165444@xmath114925.9 , and asas 203005@xmath116208.0 were confirmed as new rcb stars on the basis of ( i ) their light curves showing irregular , sharp declines of large amplitude ( @xmath1 @xmath58 1 mag ) , ( ii ) carbon rich spectra showing a lack of evidence for h and @xmath5c , and ( iii ) the mid - infrared excess observed in their seds .",
    "four of the candidates , asas 191909@xmath111554.4 ( v1942 sgr ) , asas 065113 + 0222.1 , asas 162232@xmath115349.2 , and asas 182658 + 0109.0 appear to be galactic dypers on the basis of ( i ) shallow , symmetric declines in their light curves occurring at irregular intervals , ( ii ) carbon rich spectra resembling carbon n stars showing @xmath5c and weak or no h , and ( iii ) seds that show a single peak , but which are too broad to be explained via a single temperature blackbody . with the exception of asas 170541@xmath112650.1 ,",
    "all of the new candidates show evidence for periodic variability near maximum light . we incorporate the newly confirmed rcb stars and dypers into the training set to identify six new candidates as likely rcb stars .",
    "our effort has increased the number of known galactic dypers from two to six . while the sample size is small , it appears that dypers have pulsations with period @xmath59 days at maximum light , which is longer than the typical timescale for pulsation in rcb stars ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "each of the new rcb stars and dypers is bright , @xmath60 12 mag , which will enable high - resolution spectroscopy for future studies of the detailed abundances of these stars .",
    "this is particularly important in the case of the four new dypers , as dy per itself is the only member of the class which has been observed at high resolution to confirm the lack of h absorption in the spectrum @xcite .",
    "if these stars are shown to be h deficient , it would be strong evidence that dypers are the cool ( @xmath33500 k ) analogs to rcb stars .",
    "we view the results presented herein as one culmination of a broader effort to extract novel science from the time - domain survey data deluge .",
    "earlier work focused on determining the most suitable ml frameworks for classification and subsequent classification efficiency ( see @xcite for review ) . while production of ml - based catalogs ( e.g. , acvs ; @xcite ) have been the norm for over a decade , we know of no concerted effort to validate the predictions of those catalogs .",
    "now having a probabilistic catalog of variable sources @xcite to work with , we can select our demographic priors on classes of interest and also decide just how many false - positives we are willing to tolerate in the name of improved efficiency . in the case of the construction of a new set of very common stars ( e.g. , rr lyrae catalog ) , we might be willing to tolerate a reduced discovery efficiency to preserve a high level of purity .",
    "management of the available resources to follow - up the statements made in a probabilistic catalog becomes the next challenge .",
    "we were obviously most interested in finding new exemplars of two rare classes and thus tolerated a high impurity . in the discovery and characterization of several bright rcb stars and dypers ,",
    "the payoff of the efficient use of follow - up resources enabled by probabilistic classification is evident .",
    "the classification taxonomy of variable stars clearly conflates phenomenology ( e.g. , `` periodic '' ) within a physical understanding ( `` pulsating '' ) of the origin of what is observed . and while phenomenologically based mining around an envelope of class prototypes can turn up new class members , we have shown that the diversity of rcb stars and dypers demands an expanded approach to discovery .",
    "we speculate that the richness and connections of the feature set in the ml search may be also capturing some of the phenomenological manifestations of the underlying physics , however nuanced , that we can not ( yet ) express .",
