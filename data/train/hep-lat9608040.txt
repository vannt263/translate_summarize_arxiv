    "the direct computation of full fledged hadronic matrix elements containing flavour - singlet operators @xmath8 , such as the @xmath2-n @xmath3-term , @xmath9 , or the singlet axial vector current forward matrix element between nucleon states , has posed serious problems to lattice gauge theory . as a result",
    "there is up to now only faint evidence for sea quark effects from full qcd lattice computations of such matrix elements@xcite .",
    "the practical bottleneck is given by the computation of disconnected diagrams , i.e. ubiquitous insertions of @xmath10 into quark loops disconnected from the valence quark graph , to say the nucleon propagator , @xmath11 , in the vacuum background field . technically , the disconnected insertion @xmath12 $ ] must be calculated configurationwise , i.e. in correlation with the hadronic propagator .",
    "but the cost to compute all quark loops @xmath13 individually grows with volume which renders a direct evaluation of @xmath14 prohibitively expensive@xcite .    in the framework of quenched qcd",
    ", two groups @xcite , have recently tackled the problem by applying two different variants of the noisy estimator technique proposed some time ago for computing the chiral condensate @xmath15@xcite .",
    "the trick is to induce the extensive character of the quark - loop insertion by inverting the dirac operator @xmath16 on a source extending over the _",
    "entire ( spatial ) volume_. this estimator technique is biassed in form of non - closed , i.e. bilocal and therefore non - gauge - invariant contributions that need be controlled .",
    "the kentucky group@xcite pioneered the use of a stochastic volume source with @xmath1-noise ( setz ) to get rid of the ` bilocal crossterms ' , @xmath17 . on their _ small sample _ of 50 configurations at @xmath18",
    ", they used about 300 such noise sources per configuration , at the expense of a substantial overhead in their computatinal cost .",
    "the authors of ref.@xcite , on the other hand , utilize a homogeneous volume source ( vst ) and appeal to the gauge fluctuations to suppress the non - loop bias contributions via the elitzur theorem .",
    "this approach however adds a substantial amount of noise to the data and may therefore require a _ very high statistics ensemble _ average to yield a reasonable signal",
    ".    in exploratory quenched applications , where chromofield configurations can be created at low cost , both approaches have led to rather encouraging results on signal quality@xcite .",
    "but in the context of a full qcd sea - quark computation , computer time prevents us at present from doing very high statistics sampling of gauge fields .",
    "so the question is whether effects from disconnected diagrams are accessible at all in small / medium size sampling of full qcd .",
    "this motivates us to look more deeply into the systematics of the stochastic estimator technique ( set ) on actual full qcd configurations with wilson fermions . to be specific",
    ", we will proceed by studying the quality ( size and fluctuations ) of the signal from disconnected contributions to the scalar density .",
    "the strategy in applying estimator techniques should be such that  with minimal overhead  both systematic bias ( from remaining nonlocal pollution ) and fluctuations of the signal should become negligible compared to the statistical accuracy attainable from the size of the field sample .",
    "on the basis of the current statistics from our hybrid monte carlo production@xcite we will find that it is realistic to exploit the stochastic estimator technique for the study of quark loop effects in full qcd .",
    "in order to determine the disconnected part of @xmath9 one needs to calculate the expectation value @xmath19 , where @xmath11 denotes the ( momentum zero ) proton correlation function and @xmath16 is the fermion matrix",
    ".    with vst one calculates @xmath20 on each gauge configuration @xmath21 by solving @xmath22 where @xmath23 is a volume source vector with components @xmath24 .",
    "the average over the gauge configurations @xmath25 can be separated into local and non local contributions @xmath26 as the latter are not gauge invariant they vanish ( only ) in the large @xmath27 limit : @xmath28    in the stochastic estimator technique , one uses ( complex ) random source vectors with the property @xmath29 and computes the quantity @xmath30 repeatedly ( @xmath31 times ) on each configuration .",
    "it appears natural to choose @xmath32 according to a gaussian distribution ( setg ) @xcite .",

    "this dangerous bias is removed from the beginning , if one samples the components of the random vector @xmath32 according to a @xmath1 distribution . in this case , the relation @xmath36 holds for any single estimate @xmath37 , and @xmath38 vanishes on each gauge configuration .    for the remaining nonlocal bias , @xmath39 ,",
    "setz combines two additive suppression mechanisms : ( a ) the gauge fluctuations cancel them as non gauge invariant objects on a sufficiently large sample of gauge fields , even for @xmath40 ; ( b ) the @xmath1-noise kills them in the large @xmath31 limit , even on a single gauge configuration .    in order to understand the efficiency of the competing methods for rendering good signals in more detail , we consider the variance @xmath41 of @xmath42 in each case .",
    "asymptotically one finds @xmath43 @xmath44 is the variance calculated with the exact value of @xmath45 on each configuration , and @xmath46 and @xmath47 are the variances due to the distribution of @xmath48 and @xmath49 within the process of stochastic estimation .",
    "the cornered brackets stand for the average over gauge configurations .",

    "show how the signals will be blurred by the fluctuations of the estimates @xmath51 .",
    "note that the terms in the large curly brackets of eq.[sigma_full ] are all gauge invariant .",
    "hence they survive even in the limit of an infinite sample of gauge configurations unless suppressed otherwise : there is a way to fight them within setz and setg according to a @xmath52 suppression for setz and setg . in case of setg cov contains a gauge invariant part due to @xmath53 , which can be removed only in the limit @xmath54 .",
    "all other terms in cov vanish for @xmath55 , as they are not gauge invariant . ] , but there is no way to influence them at all within vst .",
    "+ so far the discussion is qualitative only , as we do not know the relative size of these additional terms in eq.[sigma_full ] .",
    "furthermore , the calculation of @xmath9 requires the investigation of the ratio @xmath56 rather than @xmath57 itself .",
    "this can entail cancellations due to additional correlations between numerator and denominator .",
    "last not least we have to keep in mind that these considerations are only valid in the asymptotic limits of the gauge and estimator samples . in the next section",
    "we will therefore present a _",
    "numerical _ study of the situation , under actual working conditions of full qcd .",
    "our present analysis of @xmath58 is based on 157 configurations from our ongoing hybrid monte carlo run@xcite with two degenerate flavours of dynamical wilson fermions .",
    "here we work with @xmath59 , which amounts to a ratio @xmath7 , and to a quark mass of @xmath60 .",
    "\\1 . to set the stage , we consider first the implications of the stochastic estimator technique on the chiral condensate , @xmath61 and compare the performance of gaussian and @xmath1-noises in full qcd . in fig.[noises_error ] we show  on a given configuration ",
    "the standard error resulting from the two methods as a function of the number of estimates , @xmath31 .",
    "= 12.0 cm    -0.3 cm    clearly setz is superior ( by about a factor two ) in obtaining a good signal for @xmath15 ; we note that this is similar to the related quenched situation@xcite . for this reason we pursue setz in the following .",
    "an obvious way to economize is to properly adjust the accuracy in solving@xcite eq.[linear ] .",
    "we therefore compute in the next step the chiral condensate in its dependence on the inversion accuracy @xmath62 .",
    "= 12.0 cm    -0.3 cm    fig.[residue ] shows the convergence behaviour , @xmath63 .",
    "the two horizontal lines in the plot refer to the @xmath64 margin from the stochastic noise with @xmath65 estimators , on a single field configuration .",
    "it can be seen that below @xmath66 , @xmath67 is safely inside this margin .",
    "it is therefore sufficient to operate with the convergence condition @xmath66 .",
    "the next question relates to the size of the sample of gauge configurations required to observe a signal of the scalar density matrix element @xmath68 .",

    "is extracted from @xmath70 to start we choose a large number of stochastic sources , @xmath65 as proposed for quenched simulations in ref.@xcite , in order to avoid bias from the nonlocal pollutions to the trace . in fig.[sample_size ] we show how the linear rise in @xmath71 evolves more and more clearly as the sampling is increased from 50 to 100 and 157 gauge configurations .    -0.3 cm",
    "-0.3 cm    the linear fits to this data yield the values 5.89(2.37 ) , 3.44(1.45 ) and 2.51(0.77 ) for the slope .",
    "we conclude that it appears mandatory to work on samples of at least 100 configurations . under this condition",
    "we ( a ) retrieve a reasonable signal and ( b ) find the statistical errors on the data points to follow the expected behaviour @xmath72 .",
    "-0.3 cm    for comparison we show in fig.[sample_size_wall ] @xmath71 calculated with vst on 50 , 100 and 157 gauge configurations .",
    "note that the signal to noise ratio is much worse in this case .",
    "for the slope we find 7.13(4.01 ) , 5.40(2.8 ) and 3.50(2.20 ) , consistent with setz , although with much larger statistical errors .",
    "-0.3 cm    \\4 .",
    "given the signal on our present sample of 157 configurations we can now ask the question whether and how far we can actually relax in the number of stochastic estimates , @xmath31 , without deteriorating its quality .",
    "the starting point is the observation that the fluctuations from set _ add _ to the inherent fluctuations from the gauge field sample ( see eq.[sigma_full ] ) . for economics",
    "@xmath31 should be chosen just large enough to suppress this undesired effect .",
    "fig.[n_e_effects ] shows the response of @xmath45 and of @xmath73 as well as the variances @xmath74 and @xmath75 with respect to changes in @xmath52 .",
    "we find that the mean values are not affected by the variation of @xmath31 within the statistical accuracy .",
    "the variances however display a significant decrease over @xmath76 , which ends in a somewhat noisy plateau .",
    "obviously it does not pay to increase @xmath31 beyond a value of @xmath77 . for comparison",
    "we quote also the results obtained with vst on the identical sample of gauge configurations : @xmath78 , @xmath79 , @xmath80 , and @xmath81 . based on the variance we find setz to outperform vst substantially . in terms of statistics",
    "we recover a gain of a factor 2.5 to 3 from using setz instead of vst , in the present application .",
    "the full @xmath82-dependence of @xmath83 is displayed in fig.[full_t ] , showing again that 10 estimates within setz are sufficient to produce a reasonable signal on our sample of 157 configurations , while the signal is nil with one estimate only .",
    "on the other hand 300 estimates are definitely ( and fortunately ! ) unnecessary .",
    "we have presented a full qcd study on the stochastic estimator technique applied to the disconnected diagrams of the scalar density .",
    "we found that it is indeed possible to achieve clean signals from only @xmath84 @xmath1-noise sources with a weak convergence requirement , @xmath66 on the iterative solver to @xmath85 .",
    "this saves a factor 30 in computer time compared to previous applications of this technique in the quenched applications .    with as few as 157 dynamical field configurations",
    "we obtain a reliable signal on @xmath86 .",
    "this opens the door to perform a detailed analysis of the @xmath2-n @xmath3 term as well as the axial vector matrix elements in the proper setting , _",
    "i.e. _ without recourse to the quenched approximation . work along this line is in progress .",
    "it is obvious that in full qcd simulations the use of appropriately optimized @xmath1-noise techniques will be of utmost importance when it comes to the estimate of more complex quantitites in flavour - singlet channels , where the underlying correlators contain _ two _ disconnected fermion loops .",
    "exploratory quenched applications of vst to compute the @xmath87-mass and the annihilation diagrams in @xmath88-scattering in the isospin zero channel at threshold have attained good signals@xcite .",
    "this makes us hope that medium size sampling will lead in full qcd to reliable signals as well , once optimized estimator techniques will be applied to grasp the loops .    * acknowledgements .",
