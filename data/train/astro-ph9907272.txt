    "we present the results of our search for variable stars in the rich intermediate - age open galactic cluster ngc 7789 , located at @xmath2 .",
    "the cluster has been the subject of only one previous search for variable stars , conducted by jahn et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , which resulted in the discovery of 15 variables in the central part of the cluster .",
    "the first extensive photometry of ngc 7789 was presented by burbridge & sandage ( 1958 ) , providing magnitude and color determinations for nearly 700 stars within some @xmath3 of the cluster center .",
    "recent estimates place the age of the cluster at about 1.6 gyr ( gim et al . 1998 ) . a determination of the distance modulus by jahn et al .",
    "( 1995 ) based on the lower limit of the red - giant clump on the color - magnitude diagram yields @xmath4 .    in section 2 we provide general information on the location of the monitored fields and the observations .",
    "section 3 describes the reduction procedure applied to the collected data . in section 4",
    "the method used for selecting candidate variables is discussed briefly .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams are shown in section 5 .",
    "we present the catalog of variables in section 6 . in section 7",
    "we apply an absolute brightness calibration for contact binary systems to try to assess their cluster membership .",
    "a brief discussion of the results is presented in section 8 .",
    "the data for this project was obtained with the kitt peak national observatory 0.9 m telescope equipped with a tektronix @xmath5 ccd ( t2ka camera ) on five consecutive nights , from october 17 to 21 , 1992 .",
    "the field of view was about @xmath6 arcmin@xmath7 with the scale of @xmath8 .",
    "two fields were monitored , one centered on the ngc7789 open galactic cluster(@xmath9 , @xmath10 ) .",
    "the other field , intended for comparison , was offset , for the most part , in right ascension and had a small overlap with the cluster field ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) .",
    "useful data was collected during five to six hours each night , except for the night of october 19 , when only a few good frames were obtained , giving a total of 22.5 hours of monitoring . for the cluster field we obtained @xmath13 and @xmath14 exposures in @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 exposures in @xmath18 . for the comparison field we collected @xmath19 and @xmath20 exposures in @xmath15 , @xmath21 and one @xmath22 exposure in @xmath18 .",
    "the preliminary processing of the ccd frames was done with the standard routines in the iraf - ccdproc package . due to imperfect mirror alignment stars on some parts of the frame had severely elongated point spread functions ( psf ) . in order not to deteriorate the quality of the photometry over the good parts of the frame the leftmost",
    "500 columns were masked out with the imreplace routine .",
    "photometry was extracted using the _ daophot / allstar _ package ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "a psf varying quadratically with the position on the frame was used . due to the large pixel scale ,",
    "resulting in marginal sampling of stellar profiles , the psf was modeled with a gaussian function .",
    "stars were identified using the find subroutine and aperture photometry was done on them with the phot subroutine .",
    "around 150 bright isolated stars were initially chosen by _",
    "daophot _ for the construction of the psf . of those the stars with profile errors greater than twice the average were rejected and the psf was recomputed .",
    "this procedure was repeated until no such stars were left on the list .",
    "the psf was then further refined on frames with all but the psf stars subtracted from them .",
    "this procedure was applied twice .",
    "the psf obtained in the above method was then used by _ allstar _ in profile photometry .",
    "the frames intended as templates for our databases were taken as the average of three frames with the best seeing . a similar reduction procedure was applied as for single frames . after having obtained",
    "the profile photometry find was run again on the subtracted frame with a threshold of 10 - 15 sigma .",
    "detections at a distance of less than one half fwhm from stars identified previously were rejected , as were the stars for which phot could not determine a magnitude . upon closer examination",
    "the latter proved to be spurious peaks caused by the subtraction of the imperfect psf , especially on the edges of the frames , where the psf was deformed .",
    "allstar was run again on the expanded list , which resulted in the rejection of some more objects , and then once more , to refine the positions of stars .",
    "for many of the bright stars which were saturated on the template useful photometry could be obtained on most of the other images with inferior seeing .",
    "the brightest stars from a short exposure were selected and added to the template list .",
    "great care was taken to remove false detections in the profiles of saturated stars from the final list .",
    "the final template star list was then transformed to the @xmath23 coordinate system of each of the frames and used as input to _",
    "allstar _ in the fixed - position mode .",
    "the output profile photometry was transformed to the common instrumental system of the template image and then combined into a database .",
    "the databases were created for the @xmath24 exposures in the @xmath15 filter only in each of the two fields .",
    "equatorial coordinates were determined for all objects found on the @xmath15 filter templates .",
    "the transformation from rectangular to equatorial coordinates was derived using 4045 and 3402 reference stars from the usno - a2 catalog ( monet et al .",
    "1996 ) for the cluster and the comparison field respectively . in both cases",
    "the average difference between the catalog and the computed coordinates was less than @xmath25 in right ascension and @xmath26 in declination .",
    "we have followed the procedure for selecting variables given in kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , where it is described in detail . here , only a brief summary will be presented .",
    "the reduction procedure described in the previous section produces databases of calibrated @xmath15 magnitudes and their standard errors .",
    "the @xmath15 databases for the cluster and the comparison fields contained 10705 and 8143 stars , with up to 68 and 54 measurements , respectively .",
    "measurements flagged as `` bad '' ( with unusually large _ daophot _ errors , compared to other stars ) and measurements with errors exceeding the average error , for a given star , by more than @xmath27 were removed . for further analysis we used only those stars that had at least @xmath28 measurements .",
    "there are 10153 and 7664 such stars in the @xmath15 databases of the cluster and comparison fields , respectively .",
    "our next goal was to select a sample of variable stars from the total sample defined above .",
    "there are many ways to proceed , and we largely followed the approach of stetson ( 1996 ) , also described in kaluzny et al.(1998 ) . for each star we computed the stetson s variability index @xmath29 and stars with values exceeding some minimum value",
    "@xmath30 were considered candidate variables .",
    "the definition of @xmath29 is rooted in the assumption that on each visit to the program field at least one pair of observations is obtained , and only when both observations have a residual from the mean of the same sign does the pair contribute positively to the variability index .",
    "the definition of stetson s variability index includes the standard errors of individual observations .",
    "if , for some reason , these errors were over- or underestimated , we would either miss real variables , or select spurious variables as real ones . using the procedure described in kaluzny et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , we scaled the _ daophot _",
    "errors to better represent the `` true '' photometric errors .",
    "we then selected the candidate variable stars by computing the value of @xmath29 for the stars in our @xmath15 database .",
    "we used a cutoff of @xmath31 to select 277 and 284 candidate variable stars in the cluster and the comparison fields , respectively .",
    "the light curves of all variable candidates were examined , as were the images of the stars themselves on the ccd frames , to weed out false detections in the wings of bright stars , bad pixels , etc .",
    "after the rejection of spurious variables and stars with noisy / chaotic light curves we were left with 31 variables in the cluster field and 14 in the comparison field .",
    "the periodicities for all candidate variables were analyzed using a variant of the lafler - kinman ( 1965 ) string - length technique proposed by stetson ( 1996 ) .",
    "the periods were then refined using the analysis of variance method , as described by schwarzenberg - czerny ( 1989 ) .",
    "to construct the color - magnitude diagrams we used the @xmath15 photometry from the templates . to extend the cmd to lower magnitudes we added bright stars from our best quality short exposures .",
    "the @xmath18 filter photometry for the cluster field was obtained from an image constructed from three long exposures with the best seeing , just as it was done for the @xmath15 templates .",
    "bright stars selected from a short @xmath18 exposure were appended to the photometry list . in case of the comparison field only two long exposures in the @xmath18 filter",
    "were available , taken far apart in time and under different seeing conditions .",
    "the photometry lists from the two images were merged , with the better of the two measurements retained for each star present on both lists . by better we mean the magnitude determination with a smaller standard error , as computed by _",
    "allstar_.    for the variable stars we have determined their @xmath15 magnitudes and @xmath32 colors following a different procedure . in case of the eclipsing binaries we used the magnitude outside of the eclipses , @xmath33 to position them on the cmd .",
    "for the pulsating stars we determined their average magnitude @xmath34 .",
    "the variables for which we did not derive a period were plotted with the maximum magnitude @xmath33 they attained during our observing run .    to determine the colors of the variables the @xmath18 magnitudes from the 600 sec .",
    "exposures were used .",
    "the @xmath15 magnitudes were interpolated from two @xmath15 exposures , one taken before and one after , to the beginning of the b exposure .",
    "the average @xmath32 colors were computed from four color determinations in the cluster field and two in the comparison field .",
    "the scatter of the color determinations for most variables brighter than 17th mag .",
    "was about 0.02 mag .",
    "some of the eclipsing variables displayed a wider range of color variations , up to 0.2 mag . , but that seems to be an intrinsic property of those systems , most likely caused by the different colors of the components of the detached systems or gravitational darkening in the semi - detached and contact pairs .",
    "the transformation of the instrumental magnitudes to the standard system was derived from observations of the landolt fields ( landolt 1992 ) .",
    "the following relations were adopted : @xmath35 the zero points were determined from the unpublished photometry obtained by the second author on the kpno 2.1 m telescope in 1992 .",
    "the color - magnitude diagrams for the field centered on the cluster and the comparison field are shown in figures  [ fig : cmd ] and [ fig : cmdc ] , respectively .",
    "the diagram for the cluster field ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmd ] ) shows a well defined main sequence that can be traced down to @xmath36 mag , and a substantial number of blue straggler candidates at its extention to lower magnitudes , as well as an extended red giant branch and a reasonably well - defined red clump .",
    "there is no obvious indication of a post main sequence gap .",
    "the comparison field cmd ( fig .",
    "[ fig : cmdc ] ) consists mainly of field stars , although the cluster main sequence is still discernible .",
    "we were able to trace it out easily to a distance of @xmath37 from the cluster center .",
    "the depth of the cmds is biased by the @xmath18 band photometry .",
    "figures [ fig : v_s ] and [ fig : vc_s ] show the average standard @xmath15 magnitude errors plotted as a function of @xmath15 .",
    "the color - magnitude diagram for the variable stars is presented in figure  [ fig : cmdvar ] .",
    "each type of variables is denoted by a different symbol : eclipsing binares by squares , pulsating variables by circles and miscellaneous by triangles .",
    "stars within a radius of 500 pixels ( @xmath38 ) from the cluster center are plotted in the background .",
    "solid symbols indicate cluster members confirmed by proper motion measurements ( mcnamara & solomon 1981 ) .",
    "the brightest and bluest variable , v9097 , is a known non - member with @xmath39 probability of belonging to the cluster .",
    "variables located close ( at less than about @xmath40 ) to the center of the cluster show a tendency to group on and above the main sequence .",
    "in this section we present the light curves of the 45 variables found in the cluster and the comparison fields .",
    "the following convention was adopted for the naming of variable stars : letter v for `` variable '' and the number of the star in the @xmath15 filter database . for variables found in the comparison field",
    "a c is appended to the variable name .",
    "tables [ tab : ecl ] , [ tab : pul ] , [ tab : oth ] list the variables sorted by three categories : eclipsing binaries , pulsating variables and other variables for which we could not obtain a period determination . the light curves of the variables are shown in figures  [ fig : ecl ] , [ fig : pul ] and [ fig : oth ] .",
    "the @xmath41 finding charts are provided in figure [ fig : map ] .",
    "we have identified 35 eclipsing binaries in both fields , 26 in the cluster field and nine in the comparison field , 26 of them newly discovered .",
    "in addition , two of the eclipsing binaries from the cluster field were also identified in the comparison field . in table",
    "[ tab : ecl ] we present the parameters for the eclipsing binaries , sorted by period : name , j2000.0 coordinates , period , @xmath33 magnitude of the system outside of the eclipse and the average @xmath32 color .",
    "their phased light curves are shown in figure  [ fig : ecl ] .",
    "most of the eclipsing binaries have periods shorter than one day and exhibit w uma type light curves .",
    "the light curves of two variables , v4276 and v6698 , show variations similar to those of rs canum venaticorum stars .",
    "another variable , v2130 , a contact binary , also displays strong assymetry of the light outside of the eclipses : the system achieves maximum brightness between the primary and the secondary eclipse .",
    "more observations would be needed to see if and how the light curves evolve with time , to gain insight into the true nature of these systems .    the cataclysmic variable candidate v9 , found by jahn et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , identified by us as v3283 , displays brightness variations outside of the eclipses with an amplitude of 0.03 - 0.05 mag . on timescales of 1 - 2 hours ,",
    "very much like those described in that paper .",
    "two of our eclipsing binaries have their membership probabilities determined from proper motion analysis by mcnamara & solomon .",
    "one of them , v3785 is a cluster member with probability @xmath42 while the other , v9097 , is not ( @xmath43 ) .",
    "we extracted from our database the light curve for variable v6 found by jahn et al .",
    "we noticed traces of sinusoidal variability when phased with the published period , but our light curve was too noisy to obtain an independent period determination .",
    "we therefore decided not to include this variable into our catalog .",
    "it should be noted that our classification should not be regarded as final . in some cases it was difficult to determine whether a variable is an eclipsing binary or a pulsating variable with half the period .",
    "one example is v820c , which exhibits maxima that may seem too sharp for an eclipsing binary , but was still classified as such because of a slight asymmetry of the minima and and its location on the cmd .",
    "information as to the cluster membership would be helpful in many cases .",
    "more observations would be needed for some objects , to obtain a better light curve and refine the color determination .    .eclipsing binaries in ngc 7789 + [ cols=\"<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     [ tab : oth ]",
    "in an attempt to asess the cluster membership of the contact binaries we have applied the absolute magnitude calibration established by rucinski & duerbeck ( 1997 ) to calculate their @xmath44 . the adopted calibration expresses @xmath44 as a function of the period and the unreddened color @xmath45 : @xmath46 we assumed a uniform value of reddening @xmath47 mag . across the face of the cluster . the weighted mean deviation for the stars used to derive the calibration was @xmath48 mag .",
    "the calibration has not been applied to v10231 , tentatively classified as a contact binary , due to a period outside of the validity range for the calibration .",
    "the apparent distance modulus was calculated for each system as the difference between its @xmath33 and @xmath49 magnitudes .",
    "figure [ fig : mv ] shows the period versus apparent distance modulus diagram for the contact binaries found in both the cluster and the comparison field . the variable v5106 with an apparent distance modulus of 13.147 mag .",
    "is not shown in the plot , due to an outlying period .",
    "five systems , v10461 , v3983 , v2130 , v3255 and v4947c seem to be cluster members , with computed distance moduli within about @xmath50 of the cluster s distance modulus .",
    "there seem to be no other variables within 0.7 mag . in front of or behind the cluster .",
    "only two variables , v314c and v820c are foreground systems , while the rest of the w - uma type systems are located behind the cluster .",
    "our search for variable stars in the open cluster ngc 7789 has resulted in the discovery of 45 variables : 35 eclipsing binaries , five pulsating variables and five miscellaneous variables for which we could not determine a period from our short span observations . among those we have found four interesting candidates for in - depth photometric and spectroscopic",
    "studies : two rs cvn eclipsing binaries , v4276 and v6698 , one possible cataclysmic variable , v3283 , and one system of an unclear nature , v2130 .    only about twice as many variables were found in the field centered on the cluster as in the comparison field ( 31 as opposed to 14 ) .",
    "this implies that objects not associated physically with the cluster may have a significant share in the total number of variables found in the cluster field , as well as in other globular and open clusters observed on a dense background / foreground of disk stars .",
