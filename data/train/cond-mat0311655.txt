    "organic semiconductor materials are now widely used in optoelectronics devices such as field - effect transistors,@xcite light - emitting diodes,@xcite and photovoltaic diodes.@xcite intramolecular functionality ( @xmath0-conjugation ) can be tailored with synthetic methodologies,@xcite but control of intermolecular properties , which are equally important in determining electronic properties ( _ e.g. _ charge transport ) , is more elusive .",
    "perhaps the most compelling advantage of many organic semiconductors such as conjugated polymers over molecular and inorganic semiconductors is solution processability , making fabrication of elegantly simple device structures possible with techniques such as ink - jet printing.@xcite a natural strategy to achieve three - dimensional control of intermolecular interactions is to exploit molecular self assembly in solution prior to the casting process by means of supramolecular chemistry.@xcite with this approach , molecular building blocks are self - assembled to form well - defined , complex architectures through secondary forces , such as electrophilic / electrophobic interactions .",
    "these interactions need to be strong enough to lead to spontaneous self - organization but weak enough so that the process is reversible .",
    "supramolecular assemblies possess polymeric characteristics and are therefore often referred to as `` supramolecular polymers '' .",
    "their macroscopic properties can be tuned such that high carrier mobilities , for example , can be achieved.@xcite    recently , this approach has been applied very successfully to oligo(_p_-phenylenevinylene ) derivatives with chiral side - chains and functionalised with ureido-_s_-triazine , a hydrogen - bonding end - group.@xcite it has been shown that these monofunctionalized oligo(_p_-phenylenevinylene ) ( mopv ) self - organize in chiral stacks in apolar solvents below a transition temperature . here , the secondary interactions used for the supramolecular assembly are quadruple hydrogen bonds , @xmath0-@xmath0 stacking and solvophobic effects .",
    "resonance energy transfer is fundamental to describe exciton dynamics in conjugated structures .",
    "it has been shown that intermolecular energy transfer is the dominant mechanism in polymer films while intramolecular energy transfer determines exciton dynamics in dilute polymer solutions.@xcite a quantitative study of intermolecular energy transfer in polymer films is complicated by the intrinsic positional and energy disorder of such systems .",
    "mopv , on the other hand , is a model system to study energy transfer dynamics as it is possible to investigate the effect of intermolecular interactions by comparing optical properties of mopv in the dissolved phase and the supramolecular assemblies . in supramolecular assemblies ,",
    "the conjugated segments are closely packed in a fashion similar to conjugated segments in polymeric films but in a well - defined manner . in a previous paper",
    ", we have investigated exciton dynamics in mopv at low excitation fluence with time - resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy and we found them to be very similar to those of polymeric films.@xcite fast exciton diffusion on chiral supramolecular assemblies was shown to lead to exciton trapping and luminescence depolarization .",
    "it has been documented that at sufficiently high excitation fluence , exciton dynamics are dominated by bimolecular annihilation processes . this exciton - exciton interaction has been studied in several polymeric systems@xcite ( see gadermaier  _ et al._@xcite for a recent review on ultrafast studies of exciton dynamics in polymeric semiconductors ) .",
    "two models have been proposed for the mechanisms of exciton - exciton annihilation and have been applied to various polymeric systems .",
    "the first model assumes the rate - limiting process to be the diffusion and encounter of excitons , with the rate constant being time - independent.@xcite in the second model , the rate - limiting process is considered to be a long - range resonance - energy - transfer between the excitons .",
    "the proposed form of the rate constant varies but usually has an explicit time dependence due to the process being non - markovian.@xcite these two mechanisms are in competition , and the key parameter that determines the importance of the non - markovian mechanism is the spectral overlap of the 1@xmath5b@xmath4 absorption and emission spectra.@xcite the excited - state absorption spectrum is generally broad and its position is similar in polyphenylene and polyphenylenevinylene materials , but the pl spectral position is more sensitive to chemical composition . as a result ,",
    "exciton bimolecular interactions in green and red - emitting materials tend to be dominated by long - range resonance effects , while in blue - emitting materials collisional processes tend to dominate bimolecular annihilation dynamics .    in this paper",
    "we describe a comprehensive study of exciton bimolecular annihilation in mopv supramolecular assemblies in dilute solution . applying femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy",
    ", we show that excitation with pulse fluences above @xmath6@xmath7j/@xmath8 results in bimolecular annihilation dynamics that dominate on picosecond timescales .",
    "this is in analogy to solid films of polymeric semiconductors .",
    "long - range exciton bimolecular interactions determine the annihilation dynamics as has been reported for related alkoxy - substituted polyphenylenevinylene films .",
    "these results demonstrate that the electronic properties of solution - self - assembled supramolecular architectures are similar to those of disordered polymeric semiconductors .",

    "the synthesis of mopv4 ( see figure  [ fig : mopv4 ] for the molecular structure ) has been described elsewhere.@xcite the material was dissolved in anhydrous dodecane at a concentration of @xmath10 m .",
    "measurements were carried in a temperature - controlled absorption cuvette with 1 mm path length .",
    "the femtosecond transient absorption apparatus consisted of a laser system based on the design of backus  _ et al._@xcite briefly , 15-fs pulses were produced by a mode - locked ti : sapphire oscillator ( kmlabs ts pumped by 4.5w , 532 nm output from a spectra - physics millennia v laser ) .",

    "the resulting pulses had a pulse width of 100fs , a pulse energy of 400@xmath7j and were centered at a wavelength of 800 nm ( 1.55ev photon energy ) .",
    "the sample was excited with 3.1ev pump pulses produced by frequency doubling the laser fundamental in a 0.5-mm pathlength @xmath11-bbo crystal .",
    "the pump power was varied with calibrated neutral density filters and the beam was mechanically chopped at 500hz .",
    "the transient absorption of the sample was probed with a single - filament white - light continuum ( approximately from 1.2ev to 3.0ev ) produced by focusing a fraction of the fundamental into a sapphire window .",
    "probe pulses were delayed with respect to pump pulses with a computer - controlled optical delay .",
    "all the beams were linearly polarized with parallel polarization .",
    "the pump and the probe beams were focused on the sample cell to respectively @xmath12@xmath7 m and 100@xmath7 m spots ( with an angle between beams of approximatively 20@xmath1 ) . the probe beam and a reference beam ( not transmitted through the sample ) were dispersed in a 0.25-m spectrometer and detected with a pair of si photodiodes .",

    "the luminescence was detected with a microchannel plate photomultiplier ( hamamatsu ) coupled to a spectrometer and tcspc electronics ( edinburgh instruments lifespec - ps and vtc900 pci card ) .",
    "a decay curve was taken at 2.21ev photon energy , and the decay time was extracted from a mono - exponential fit to the data .",

    "the material investigated here is an oligophenynevinylene consisting of four phenyl rings , monofunctionalized with a ureido-_s_-triazine ( mopv4 ) to dimerise by hydrogen bonding ( see figure  [ fig : mopv4 ] ) .",
    "the absorption spectrum of mopv4 is shown in figure  [ fig : plabs ] together with the photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum at 14@xmath1c and 65@xmath1c for excitation using femtosecond pulses with photon energy just above the peak of the @xmath0-@xmath14 band .",
    "a red shift is observed upon cooling the solution , which has been previously attributed to the formation of supramolecular assemblies.@xcite small - angle neutron scattering experiments showed that the average stack length is around 160 nm with a radius around 6nm.@xcite the stack configuration is not known precisely but according to preliminary quantum - chemical calculations , the oligomer separation is approximatively 35  and the angle of rotation between two neighboring oligomer is close to 12@xmath1.@xcite the intermolecular coupling in the stacks modifies the excitonic characteristics and leads to the appearance of a red shoulder in the pl spectrum . above a certain transition temperature , which depends on the mopv4 concentration , the thermodynamic equilibrium shifts from supramolecular assembly to a dissolved phase.@xcite within a relatively narrow range ( @xmath15c ) about the transition temperature , the positional disorder in the stack increases and the average assembly length decreases . at the mopv4 concentration used here ,",
    "the transition temperature is around @xmath16c .",
    "however , the two pl spectra show that at 65@xmath1c , the red shoulder has already decreased significantly suggesting that the intermolecular coupling is much smaller at 65@xmath1c .",

    "the two arrows point to the excitation fluence of the data used for the stretched exponential fits ( see figure [ fig : palowp ] ) . ]",
    "figure  [ fig : plpow ] shows the excitation - fluence dependence of the time- and wavelength - integrated pl intensity of mopv4 at 14@xmath1c and 65@xmath1c .",
    "the dependence is linear with excitation fluence but a sub - linear trend appears at higher fluence .",
    "the transition between the two regimes is temperature - dependent . at lower solution temperatures , the pl intensity saturates at",
    "significantly lower fluence . moreover , the deviation from linearity at high excitation fluence is stronger at 14@xmath1c .",
    "such behavior is indicative of a time - integrated exciton population which develops linearly with low pump fluence and sub - linearly with high fluence .",
    "this indicates that exciton - exciton annihilation occurs on the supramolecular assemblies at high fluence . at low fluence , on the other hand , we are able to probe a regime where exciton - exciton annihilation dynamics are negligible .",
    "various opv derivatives have been previously studied using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy,@xcite and three distinct spectral signatures were identified .",

    "the se and the 1.46-ev pa were assigned to 1@xmath17b@xmath18-exciton dynamics while the 1.77-ev pa signal was assigned to polaron absorption . in the following discussion",
    "we will limit ourselves to the study of the 1@xmath17b@xmath18-exciton dynamics , as the pa signal due to polaron absorption is strongly fluence dependent due to two - step exciton dissociation by resonant sequential excitation.@xcite     absorption transients at a probe photon energy of 1.46ev and solution temperature of 14@xmath1c ( 21@xmath7j@xmath19 pump fluence , black circles ) and 65@xmath1c ( 25@xmath7j@xmath19 pump fluence , open squares ) with fits to the expression ( @xmath20 . the solid line is fit to the data at 14@xmath1c ( @xmath21ps , @xmath22 and @xmath23=1600ps ) and the broken line is the fit to the data at 65@xmath1c ( @xmath21ps , @xmath24 and @xmath23=1600ps ) . ]",

    "exciton diffusion on the supramolecular stacks is fast enough to allow for exciton - exciton interactions at sufficiently high density . at 65@xmath1c , localization of excitons becomes dominant as the disorder is increased.@xcite furthermore , just below the transition temperature , the average stack length is shorter as the equilibrium shifts towards the dissolved phase@xcite so that the exciton density required for exciton - exciton interaction is higher .    in order to obtain a more quantitative description of exciton bimolecular annihilation dynamics in mopv4 nanostructures ,",
    "we have constructed a mesoscopic model that reproduces our experimental results and allows us to unravel the mechanism governing the annihilation process .",
    "the model is based on a rate equation for the exciton population , @xmath27 , given by    @xmath28    the first term is the exciton generation rate , which has the form    @xmath29    where @xmath30 is the excitation pulse energy , @xmath31 is the unsaturated absorbtion coefficient , @xmath32 is the excitation wavelength , @xmath33 is the gaussian radius of the excitation beam , @xmath34 is the number of excitons created between @xmath35 and @xmath36 ( with @xmath35 the zero - time ) , @xmath37 is the initial density of ground states and @xmath38 is the width of the excitation pulse . to calculate @xmath34",

    "collisional bimolecular annihilation processes are described by the third term , where @xmath11 is the diffusion - limited exciton bimolecular annihilation rate constant .",
    "the general form includes a time - dependence but this term may be neglected if the typical diffusion length on experimental time - scales is larger than the extent of the exciton.@xcite in conjugated systems , this is usually the case ; however , this assumption will be discussed further in section  [ discu ] .",
    "on the other hand , the long - range time - dependent bimolecular annihilation term , with rate constant @xmath40 , includes explicit time - dependence .",
    "this time - dependence was introduced following resonance energy transfer studies and accounts for the dispersive nature of the transfer process resulting from the distribution of transfer rates in a random ensemble of donors and acceptors , which leads to a non - markovian depletion of acceptors near the donors .",
    "the exact time dependence , characterized by the time exponent @xmath41 , varies with the spatial distribution of acceptors and depends on dimensionality.@xcite however , other factors such as disorder may also lead to a power - law dependence of the transfer rate ( this point will be discussed further in section  [ discu ] ) and we have therefore considered @xmath41 in this term as a fitting variable .    the final term in equation  [ eq : model ] represents the ultrafast dynamics related to exciton diffusion in supramolecular assemblies .",
    "we have reported previously dispersive diffusion dynamics of excitons in mopv4 and we will therefore not consider these issues in detail here.@xcite to take into account effects of diffusion to non - radiative traps , we have added a term in our rate equation so that at low excitation fluence , the solution converges towards the low excitation fluence data . to determine this term , we fit the pa signal measured at the lowest excitation fluence ( within the linear intensity regime , see figure  [ fig : palowp ] ) with a stretched exponential taking into account the natural decay ( @xmath42 ) , where @xmath43 is the stretched - exponential time constant and @xmath44 is the exponent in the stretched exponential . in equation",
    "[ eq : model ] , @xmath45 is the amplitude of the contribution of this dispersive process .",
    "this method follows theoretical@xcite and experimental@xcite studies of exciton diffusion to traps were a stretched exponential behavior was obtained .",
    "the stretched exponential fit to the 65@xmath1c pa data is very close to an exponential function but the time dependence of the pa data at 14@xmath1c is close to an exponential of the square root of time .",
    "this indicates that diffusion to traps and polarization decay influence the pa signal dynamics at 14@xmath1c but is less important at 65@xmath1c , as established by our previous studies of exciton dynamics on mopv4 at low fluence.@xcite    the experimental geometry is taken into account in the photophysical model by dividing the volume located at the intersection of the probe and the pump beams into small sub - volumes with homogeneous excitation fluence where the rate equation can be solved .",
    "the measured quantities are then calculated by summing the exciton densities in a mesoscopic approach . to calculate the se and pa signals",
    ", the fraction of probe photons transmitted through the sample needs to be evaluated .",
    "this fraction is related to the exciton density and to the se and pa cross - sections by @xmath46 where @xmath47 is the photon density , @xmath48 is the cross - section for se or for pa and @xmath49 is the sample depth .",
    "as we are only interested in the sample transmission , the initial probe photon population is arbitrary .",
    "the average exciton density at a particular sample depth is determined in a similar manner as the total exciton density on the entire volume but the multiplication factors needed are the surface fractions excited with each of the particular excitation fluence of the set , at the particular sample depth .    the parameter @xmath23 is obtained separately from tcspc measurements , @xmath37 from the knowledge of the mopv4 concentration , @xmath31 and therefore @xmath48 ( defined as @xmath50 ) from uv - vis absorption measurements , and @xmath43 and @xmath44 from the stretched - exponential fitting of the low fluence pa signal . to determine the remaining parameters ( @xmath11 , @xmath40 and @xmath41 , @xmath45 , @xmath51 and @xmath52 ) , the pa and se signals at all excitation fluence ,",

    "a branching between exciton localization and direct bimolecular annihilation is likely at early time . at later times ,",
    "bimolecular annihilation of localized excitons is likely .",
    "this picture is analogous to related studies of resonance energy transfer dynamics in blends containing small concentrations of mopv4 in similar oligomers with shorter conjugation length.@xcite    a more accurate description of the bimolecular annihilation dynamics would require comparing the time - dependent average exciton density accessed with our measurement and a configurationally averaged microscopic description of the transfer processes using a monte - carlo or a master equation approach .",
    "implementation of these schemes requires a significant number of assumptions , including detailed understanding of the structural and geometrical disorder .",
    "this information is beyond the scope of the present study .    on the other hand",
    ", a detailed description should be based on a quantum - chemical , non - markovian model where the exciton - exciton coupling and electron - phonon coupling are explicitly taken into account .",
    "opv systems have been shown to belong to the intermediate coupling regime where the relaxation energy accompanying optical excitation , the nearest neighbor exciton - exciton coupling , and the frequency of the most strongly coupled intramolecular vibration are comparable.@xcite in mopv4 supramolecular stacks , the intermolecular exciton - exciton coupling are comparable to typical intramolecular exciton - exciton coupling found in polymeric systems.@xcite for such an intermediate case between polymeric systems and molecular aggregates that undergo coherent excitation transfer ( supertransfer ) , the description of exciton - exciton interaction would need to go beyond a frster description of energy transfer.@xcite    we are currently exploring both the microscopic semi - classical and the quantum chemical approaches .",
    "however , the work presented here demonstrates unambiguously that the exciton dynamics in supramolecular nanostructures in solution are similar to those observed in polymeric semiconductors , but control of intermolecular electronic interactions is higher such that high exciton bimolecular annihilation rates are measured .",
    "we have shown that exciton dynamics in supramolecular assemblies of mopv4 are very similar to the dynamics observed in conjugated polymer films .",
    "supramolecular chemistry is a very promising route to construct well - defined semiconductor architectures with polymeric properties through controlled reversible assembly .",
    "we have applied femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy as a means to explore exciton dynamics in a supramolecular nanostructure constructed with a hydrogen - bonded oligophenylenevinylene derivative .",
    "a simple rate - equation model was applied successfully to separate exciton bimolecular annihilation phenomena from unimolecular processes occurring at low fluence.@xcite we have shown that exciton - exciton annihilation does take place on the supramolecular assemblies and dominates the exciton dynamics at high fluence . the mechanism for bimolecular annihilation is non - markovian ; explicit time dependence is necessary to reproduce the experimental data with the model .",
    "the rate constant for bimolecular annihilation is higher than in comparable organic systems and can not be rationalized with simple models used in previous studies .",
    "we consider that the electronic properties of this system fall in the intermediate electronic coupling regime , where intermolecular electronic coupling is comparable to the intramolecular reorganization energy , providing an opportunity to apply semiclassical and quantum - chemical methodologies to explore electronic dynamics in this promising regime of supramolecular electronics .",
