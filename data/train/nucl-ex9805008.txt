    "the mgo tablets were put into a thin al foil to ensure that no powder is lost during the measurements .",
    "the mass of the tablets had to be determined very carefully because the mgo powder is very hygroscopic .",

    "now the energy width depends sensitively on the thickness of the lithium layer which was about 2.6 @xmath61 m in our experiment .",
    "the thicknesses of the different thin lithium targets were determined by two independent methods : first during the evaporation of the metallic lithium layer and second from the width of the time - of - flight spectra ( see below ) .",
    "both methods give the same results within an uncertainty of about 10% .",
    "for the activation runs beam currents in the order of 80 to 100 @xmath61a were used .",
    "because of the electric power of the proton beam of about @xmath63 the copper backing of the thin lithium layer was water - cooled , and the temperature of the copper backing remained below 85@xmath64c during the whole experiment .",
    "the neutron energy spectra were controlled by time - of - flight ( tof ) measurements using the pulsed beam which is available from the van - de - graaff accelerator .",

    "an almost pure single - particle structure can not be expected but there still exist broad resonances with a relatively strong single - particle component .",
    "this leads to an overestimation of the width because the simple two - body potential model assumes full single - particle structure for potential resonances . as a consequence ,",
    "the potential model is not able any more to predict the properties of such resonances with high accuracy ; only if the spectroscopic factor of such a resonance is known , the width can be calculated using the relation @xmath160 where @xmath161 is the width calculated from the potential model .",
    "furthermore , the strength of the theoretical single - particle resonance is fragmented into several states which can be identified experimentally .",
    "this can already be seen from the fact that the two bound @xmath3-wave states which dominate the thermal capture cross section of @xmath0mg(n,@xmath7)@xmath8 mg have sf in the order of about 0.2 to 0.4 .",
    "it has to be pointed out that the so - called `` non - resonant '' energy region can be calculated by the simple potential model * only * if the potential is carefully adjusted because the potential model * always * contains potential resonances , and as one can see from figs .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] and [ fig : phase ] , there is no clear definition for `` resonant '' or `` non - resonant ''",
    ". a wrong adjustment may lead to ( @xmath56 ) an overestimation of the capture cross section if the potential contains a single - particle resonance which does not exist in the experiment , and ( @xmath59 ) an underestimation of the capture cross section if the adjustment neglects strong ( and broad ) single - particle resonances .",
    "the success of many previous calculations using the dc model , which seems to be in contradiction to the above statements , can be explained by two facts : ( @xmath56 ) in several cases the influence of potential resonances is small in the energy region which was analyzed in the calculation ( this is especially the case when the main contribution for the dc transition comes from regions far outside the nucleus , see e.g.  refs .",
    "@xcite or @xcite ) , ( @xmath59 ) even wrong dc calculations can be corrected using adjustable spectroscopic factors ( uncertainties in the order of a factor of 2 are realistic , see sect .",
    "[ subsec : sf ] ! ) .",
    "> from this point of view the rough agreement of the calculated dc cross section with the experimental results is already somewhat surprising because the range of the capture cross section ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : lambda ] ) covers five orders of magnitude when the potential strength changes by only @xmath162 from about 0.95 ( determined from the @xmath2-wave scattering ) down to 0.8 and up to 1.1 .",
    "such a dramatic behavior of the so - called `` non - resonant '' direct capture can appear in any dc calculation .",
    "to the best of our knowledge , these facts were not completely discussed in all the previous papers dealing with dc . in conclusion , we point out that the calculation of the dc has to be done with great care for each nucleus because otherwise deviations between the predicted and the experimental capture cross section not only by a factor of two , but even by orders of magnitude can appear , and both overestimations and underestimations of the experimental cross sections are possible !      as pointed out by lane and mughabghab @xcite , the capture amplitude has to be derived from the full optical potential , i.e.  real and imaginary part ( see also eq .",
    "[ eq : ac ] ) .",
    "however , in the case of @xmath0mg(n,@xmath7)@xmath8 mg the imaginary part of the optical potential can be neglected for the following reasons .",
    "the only open inelastic channel is neutron capture . then the capture cross section @xmath43 is directly related to the reflexion coefficient @xmath163 by : @xmath164 using the real folding potential with @xmath165 ( from sect .",
    "[ subsec : sf ] ) , an imaginary saxon - woods potential with depth @xmath166 , reduced radius @xmath167 ( @xmath168 ) , diffuseness @xmath169 , and the experimentally determined values of @xmath43 , one obtains a depth of the imaginary part in the order of @xmath170 for the optical @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave potential .",
    "this very weak imaginary part does not significantly influence the calculated dc cross section .    a significant reduction of the dc cross section is only obtained when",
    "@xmath166 is increased by more than three orders of magnitude .",
    "this means that the calculations of the dc cross section in fig .",
    "[ fig : lambda ] are practically not influenced by the imaginary part of the potential .",
    "only potential resonances with very huge capture cross sections ( with @xmath171 ) will be damped slightly by the imaginary part of the potential .",
    "the astrophysical reaction rate @xmath172 can easily be derived from the maxwellian averaged capture cross section @xmath9 .",
    "the maxwellian averaged cross section of the reaction @xmath0mg(n,@xmath7)@xmath8 mg was calculated from the following three ingredients .",
    "first , the thermal @xmath2-wave capture taken from ref .",
    "@xcite was extrapolated to the thermonuclear energy region using the well - known @xmath11 law .",
    "this @xmath11 behavior is reproduced by the dc calculations .",
    "therefore , the uncertainty of the @xmath2-wave contribution is below 5% .",
    "second , the @xmath3-wave capture cross section which dominates at thermonuclear energies is roughly proportional to the velocity @xmath147 : @xmath173 the constant @xmath174 was determined from the experimental data : @xmath175 . because only three experimental cross section data are not influenced by resonances , and because one has to subtract the @xmath2-wave contribution from the experimental capture cross section , we estimate an uncertainty of less than 20% for the @xmath3-wave contribution .",
    "note that the the @xmath3-wave contribution of the dc for the data point at @xmath94 was also taken from eq .",
    "[ eq : pcontrib ] , and the @xmath2- and @xmath3-wave contribution were subtracted to determine the resonance strength of the @xmath1 resonance ( see sect .",
    "[ subsec : results ] ) .",
    "third , the resonance contributions were reduced by a factor of 2.8 compared to ref .",
    "@xcite ( see discussion in sect .",
    "[ subsec : results ] ) .",
    "this factor was only determined for the @xmath1 resonance , and the uncertainty of the * sum * of the resonant contributions is roughly a factor of 2 .",
    "finally , this leads to a maxwellian averaged capture cross section @xmath12 as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : max ] . at low energies ( @xmath176 ) @xmath2-wave capture is dominating , and from about @xmath177 the @xmath3-wave capture exceeds the @xmath2-wave contribution .",
    "the resonances become dominant at higher energies ( @xmath178 ) . by accident ,",
    "our result is relatively close to that of ref .",
    "@xcite : the sum of our measured @xmath3-wave capture and the by a factor of 2.8 reduced resonant contributions is somewhat larger at @xmath179 than the calculation of ref .",
    "@xcite which neglected the @xmath3-wave contribution , and at higher energies ( @xmath180 ) the result of ref .",
    "@xcite is higher than our new result due to the overestimation of the resonance strengths in that work .",
    "there are three main results of this work : ( @xmath56 ) the dc cross section of the reaction @xmath0mg(n,@xmath7)@xmath8 mg was measured for the first time between the known resonances at @xmath75 and @xmath1 @xcite , ( @xmath59 ) the properties of potential resonances are discussed in detail for the @xmath3-wave capture of @xmath0mg(n,@xmath7)@xmath8 mg , and ( @xmath62 ) the resonance strength of the @xmath1 resonance was determined to be @xmath97 by a careful analysis of the neutron energy spectrum @xmath67 .",
    "this last result is in clear contradiction to the results of ref .  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , in ref .  @xcite the experimental information on the capture measurements is very limited , but it is stated in that work that the enriched @xmath0mg- and @xmath4mg - samples were analyzed in the same way .",
    "this fact makes the experimental results of ref .",
    "@xcite for the capture reaction @xmath4mg(n,@xmath7)@xmath0 mg at least questionable .",
    "a strongly reduced @xmath4mg(n,@xmath7)@xmath0 mg reaction rate might have influence on the @xmath2-process nucleosynthesis because of the role of @xmath4 mg as neutron poison . in this paper",
    "we do not want to speculate about astrophysical consequences of such a reduced reaction rate ; instead , we think that primarily a new measurement of the resonance properties of @xmath4 mg is necessary to obtain reliable reaction rates . unfortunately , the reaction @xmath4mg(n,@xmath7)@xmath0 mg can not be analyzed using our activation technique because the residual nucleus @xmath0 mg is stable .",
