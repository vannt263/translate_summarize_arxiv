    "the star formation history of elliptical galaxies still remains , at many levels , a mystery .",
    "the fundamental uncertainty afflicting attempts to determine the ages of such ( presumably ) old stellar populations lies in the unfortunate fact - of - life that age and metallicity have almost identical effects upon broad - band colours and on most line indices ( oconnell 1976 ) .",
    "this age - metallicity _ degeneracy ( sometimes referred to as worthey s ( 1994 ) `` 3/2-rule '' , their broad - band colours and ( most ) line indices will be nearly identical . ] ) has led many (  oconnell 1976 ; worthey 1994 ; rose 1994 ) to search for individual absorption features which may be sensitive to either age _ or metallicity , but not both . _ _",
    "unfortunately , line indices have not proven to be the panacea once hoped for . as worthey ( 1994 )",
    "has shown ( see his table 6 ) , the vast majority of low - resolution lines defined by the lick ids survey (  worthey   1994 ) lie uncomfortably close to the 3/2-rule degeneracy `` zone '' . an encouraging result to come out of the worthey ( 1994 ) ids study , however , was the identification of one particularly useful , and strong , indicator , apparently free of any strong age influence .",
    "fe4668 , whose bandpass spans @xmath3 , tracks not only fe , but contains a strong contribution from c@xmath4 , ti , cr , and mg , and as worthey , trager & faber ( 1996 ) note , is the best current candidate tracer for the mean metallicity `` z '' , almost exclusively sensitive to this alone .",
    "on the other hand , identifying a matching `` pure '' age discriminator has proven more difficult . h@xmath5 and h@xmath6 have long been popular indices , in this regard (  oconnell 1976 ) , but as stressed by gonzlez ( 1993 ) , both lines can be easily distorted ( even filled in ) by emission from ionized gas , _ severely compromising their usage .",
    "higher - order balmer emission lines (  h@xmath7 and h@xmath2 ) are admittedly weaker , yet free of such `` emission '' complications , and appear to provide a very sensitive age diagnostic . rose ( 1994 ) recognized this latter fact , and designed a set of higher - resolution line indices in order to take advantage of these age discriminating `` powers '' .",
    "the rose system employs a 3.74  window over which the line indices are measured ; in contrast , the lick ids system ( typically ) uses an @xmath840  window .",
    "one index in particular , h@xmath0 ( centred at 4340.5 ) , was strongly sensitive to age alone .",
    "_    the near - orthogonal behaviour , in the age - metallicity plane , of the h@xmath0 and fe4668 line indices , was demonstrated by jones & worthey ( 1995 ; figure 2 ) , and suggests a viable mechanism for breaking the aforementioned age - metallicity degeneracy .",
    "an extension of this lick+rose index comparison was undertaken by jones ( 1995,1996ab ) , but now concentrating solely upon pairs of high resolution rose indices  jones examined the h@xmath0cai@xmath9 age - metallicity diagnostic diagram .",
    "jones & worthey ( 1995 ) stress several caveats regarding their proposed optimal age - dating technique .",
    "first , while the parameter - space coverage (  t@xmath10 , @xmath11 , and [ fe / h ] ) of their stellar library , upon which the model sequences are ultimately based , is good , it is not complete .",
    "specifically , there is an admitted lack of metal - poor stars , especially hot horizontal branch stars , which could contribute to the balmer line absorption .",
    "because of this , jones & worthey emphasize that their sequences are not directly applicable to systems with metallicities outside @xmath12}\\le + 0.6 $ ] .",
    "second , in order to apply this technique accurately to integrated spectra of spheroidal systems , very high signal - to - noise ratios ( @xmath13 ) , at moderately high spectral resolutions ( @xmath14 ) , are a necessity .    to this end , jones & worthey ( 1995 ) present such a spectrum for m32 , and find an age of @xmath15 gyr , in agreement with oconnell ( 1980 ) and rose ( 1994 ) .",
    "while this result is a necessary proof of the technique , it is not a sufficient one , as it effectively compares two population _ synthesis methods , both of which are _ indirectly determining an age estimate .",
    "optimally , any testing of a new , and potentially exciting , technique should be completely `` independent '' , at some level .",
    "unfortunately , there are simply no independently age - dated ellipticals known . on the other hand ,",
    "there does exist another family of systems which are ideally suited to such a study  the metal - rich globular clusters of the milky way .",
    "_ metal - rich globular clusters are the only practical systems with which to independently assess the reliability of the h@xmath0fe4668 age - dating technique .",
    "this comes about because accurate ages have already been determined for at least four clusters in the metal - rich regime to which the jones & worthey technique is applicable (  richer  1996 ) . with its high metallicity ( @xmath16 ) and colour - magnitude diagram ( cmd)-derived age of @xmath1 gyr ( richer  1996 ) ,",
    "the southern globular cluster , 47  tuc , is an ideal laboratory within which to test this new age - dating technique .",
    "_ _ _    existing high - resolution integrated spectra of 47  tuc in the literature include those of smith ( 1979 ) and rose ( 1994 ) . in both cases",
    "though , the observations were restricted to @xmath17 , meaning the metallicity - discriminant fe4668 line index could not be measured .    in section [ observations ] , we briefly describe our new observations of 47  tuc , which now provide simultaneous coverage of both the age - sensitive feature h@xmath0 , and the metallicity - sensitive features cai@xmath9 and",
    "fe4668 . such data will allow us to test how accurately the spectroscopic age of this simple stellar population agrees with its accurately determined cmd age .",
    "the results of our analysis are discussed in section [ discussion ] , and summarised in section [ summary ] .",
    "two high signal - to - noise ( @xmath18 ) integrated spectra of 47  tuc were acquired during the nights of october 20 and 21 , 1996 , using the coud spectrograph , with the 32@xmath19 schmidt camera ( grating e ; 1@xmath20 order ) , on the 74@xmath19 telescope at mount stromlo observatory , was employed .",
    "the @xmath21 long slit was scanned back and forth ( e - w ) across the slit , to limits of @xmath22 from the cluster center ( total coverage in excess of 2.5 core radii , ensuring stochastic fluctuations due to finite sampling were minimized ) , for @xmath23 minutes per exposure .",
    "the 24 @xmath24 m pixels of the tek 2k@xmath252k ccd translated to 0.48 per pixel   983 of spectral coverage , which for a central wavelength setting of @xmath26 , allowed simultaneous determination of ca i@xmath9 , h@xmath0 , and fe4668 indices .",
    "companion blank - sky exposures ( again , of @xmath23 minutes duration , taken @xmath27 to the north of the cluster core ) were acquired subsequent to each 47  tuc exposure .",
    "the relative strength of the sky versus cluster signal was negligible . for calibration purposes , 13 stars ( spanning a range in metallicity and spectral type ) in common with jones coud feed spectral library ( see section 2.4 of leitherer  1996 and jones 1996b ) and",
    "the lick / ids library ( worthey  1994 ) were observed , as were two spectrophotometric standards .",
    "standard iraf tasks were employed for the flat - fielding , flux , and wavelength calibration .",
    "observations taken throughout the run of bright , metal - poor halo giants imply that sky subtraction has not introduced any unforeseen spectral artifacts .",
    "because the central one - dimensional velocity dispersion of 47  tuc is only @xmath28kms@xmath29 ( meylan & mayor 1986 ) , no correction for internal dispersion was applied to the spectra ; as trager  ( 1998 ; figure 3 ) demonstrate , such a correction , for globular clusters , is negligible .    before measuring the h@xmath0 and cai@xmath9 line indices , our observed standards and target 47  tuc spectra",
    "were first smoothed with a @xmath30kms@xmath29 gaussian , and re - binned to 0.623 / pixel , in both cases to parallel jones ( 1996b ) .",
    "the h@xmath0 and cai@xmath9 equivalent widths are measured as detailed in section 3 of jones & worthey ( 1995 ) . flanking blue and red pseudo - continuum peaks , usually associated with the immediately - adjacent blue and red shoulders of the relevant absorption line ,",
    "were identified ; the equivalent widths were then measured relative to the continuum formed by connecting the two pseudo - continuum peaks . for h@xmath0 ,",
    "the blue pseudo - continuum was associated with the local maximum between 4329 and 4336 , while the red pseudo - continuum was associated with the maximum in the 4346@xmath314350 window ; for cai@xmath9 , the correspondings windows were 4218@xmath314222 and , either 4230@xmath314232 ( early spectral types ) or 4242@xmath314246 ( later spectral types ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fig1 ] shows the pair of integrated 47  tuc spectra in the region of both the h@xmath0 and cai@xmath9 indices ; the associated flanking pseudo - continua are similarly noted .",
    "the equivalent width was then derived via a simple simpson s rule algorithm , summing the area associated with the seven 0.623 pixels centred on the minimum of the high resolution absorption feature  gaussian - fitting to the line profiles was not employed in our analysis , again , in order to maintain consistency with jones ( 1996b ) .",
    "the derived equivalent widths of figure [ fig : fig1 ] are consistent , from night - to - night , at the @xmath32% level .",
    "for the fe4668 measurement , the 13 standards and 47  tuc spectra were smoothed with a @xmath33kms@xmath29 gaussian , to match the lick ids resolution .",
    "adjacent blue and red continua were determined from the mean flux in the 4611.50@xmath314630.25 and 4742.75@xmath314756.500 windows , respectively . using the continuum defined by the line connecting the mean of these two windows ,",
    "the equivalent width was then derived by integrating the absorption feature over the 4634.00@xmath314720.25 window .",
    "the adopted windows are marginally different from those defined by worthey  ( 1994 ; table 1 ) , but reflect those adopted in the 1997 edition of the lick / ids stellar catalog ( trager  1998 ) .",
    "comparison of the equivalent widths derived from our 13 standards with those tabulated in the coud feed spectral library ( h@xmath0 and cai@xmath9 ) and lick / ids library ( fe4668 ) revealed the two systems were on the scale , and no further corrections were needed to bring the systems into agreement ",
    "both groups were measuring identical equivalent widths for the same standards  and therefore , our measured 47  tuc equivalent widths could be used _ as is in comparing against the model age - metallicity diagnostic diagrams of jones & worthey ( 1995 ) and jones ( 1996a ) .",
    "evidence to this effect is presented in figure [ fig : fig2 ] , in which our standard star cai@xmath9 equivalent widths ( x - axis ) are plotted against those from jones ( 1996b ) coud feed spectral library ( y - axis ) - the mean offset ( in the sense of jones@xmath31present study ) is only @xmath34 , a factor of @xmath83@xmath25 smaller than the typical uncertainty associated with pseudo - continua placement and night - to - night variations ( recall figure [ fig : fig1 ] ) .",
    "identical conclusions hold for the other line indices in our study .",
    "our measured ( and adopted ) 47  tuc equivalent widths are therefore @xmath35 ( h@xmath0 ) , @xmath36 ( cai@xmath9 ) , and @xmath37 ( fe4668 ) , where the uncertainties reflect those due to pseudo - continuum placement , and , to a lesser degree , the scatter derived from repeat measurements of the set of standards . _",
    "following the prescription outlined by jones & worthey ( 1995 ) and jones ( 1996b ) , the worthey ( 1994 ) population synthesis models were used to predict h@xmath0 , cai@xmath9 , and fe4668 line index strengths , as a function of age and metallicity [ fe / h ] , for a grid of single burst stellar populations .",
    "twenty - four realizations , spanning ages @xmath38gyr and metallicities [ fe / h]=@xmath39 , were made ; the full set of 24 models were then incorporated into the h@xmath40cai@xmath9 age - metallicity diagnostic grid shown in figure [ fig : fig3 ] . while not perfectly orthogonal , this pair of high resolution rose - style indices do provide adequate separation of age and metallicity , with a minimum of degeneracy .",
    "the four filled symbols represent the same set of low luminosity ellipticals shown in the earlier analysis of jones ( 1996a ) , but now smoothed to the same @xmath30kms@xmath29 resolution adopted by jones ( 1996b ) and the present study . as discussed previously ( jones 1996a ) , these four galaxies represent a ( luminosity - weighted ) solar metallicity age sequence spanning the range @xmath41gyr .",
    "the open starred symbol represents our new 47  tuc data point ; unlike the case for the galaxies shown in figure [ fig : fig3 ] , 47  tuc has an independent age - element enhanced stellar models , have recently revised the age of 47  tuc from the canonical ( scaled - solar abundance ) richer ( 1996 ) value of @xmath1gyr , to the lower value of @xmath42gyr . on the surface",
    "this only worsens the spectroscopic versus cmd age discrepancy of figure [ fig : fig3 ] , although the comparison is perhaps not a fair one , since worthey s ( 1994 ) synthesis models are ( necessarily ) tied to models and stellar data which are likewise of scaled - solar abundances .",
    "similarly , the post - hipparcos globular cluster distance scale appears to favor a 2 - 3gyr reduction in the mean age of the oldest globulars ( chanoyer  1998 ) ; again , this only strengthens our conclusion regarding the spectroscopic age of 47  tuc , although to be fair , as before , we retain the richer  ( 1996 ) result as the most representative one against which to compare our results . ]",
    "( @xmath1gyr ) and metallicity ( [ fe / h]@xmath16 ) determination , derived from isochrone fitting to the cmd ( richer  1996 ; salaris & weiss 1998 )",
    ". it should be immediately clear that the spectroscopic age of 47  tuc , as determined by the age - sensitive h@xmath0 line index is inconsistent with its cmd age , at the @xmath84@xmath43 level , being @xmath80.2 lower than expected for this 14gyr old simple stellar population .",
    "this @xmath80.2 h@xmath2 discrepancy was previously noted by rose ( 1994 ; section 5.1 ) , although not in the context of age - dating its integrated spectrum . on the other hand , it is somewhat re - assuring that the metallicity inferred from figure [ fig : fig3 ] (  [ fe / h]@xmath44 - 0.5 ) is consistent with that derived from the cmd ( richer  1996 ) .",
    "figure [ fig : fig4 ] shows the h@xmath0fe4668 age - metallicity diagnostic diagram as presented by jones & worthey ( 1995 ; figure 2 ) ; the same nineteen models used in their analysis are incorporated in our grid .",
    "the only ( subtle ) difference between figure [ fig : fig4 ] , and that of jones & worthey , is that , in the latter , the spectra were smoothed to @xmath45kms@xmath29 ( to match the resolution of their m32 spectrum ) , while in the present study , recall that a @xmath30kms@xmath29 gaussian was employed ( to match the spectra and models of jones 1996b ) .",
    "again , the model sequences of figure [ fig : fig4 ] clearly demonstrate the near perfect orthogonal nature of the h@xmath0 and fe4668 line indices in the age - metallicity plane .    as in figure",
    "[ fig : fig3 ] , the filled square represents the jones & worthey ( 1995 ) observation of m32 , while the open starred symbol shows our new 47  tuc data point . as was the case for the pair of rose - style high resolution line indices ( figure [ fig : fig3 ] ) , in the h@xmath0 versus fe4668 , the anomalously low h@xmath0 in the integrated spectrum of 47  tuc results in a spectroscopic age ( @xmath4620gyr ) which is clearly discrepant with cmd age ( @xmath1gyr ) .",
    "is there some way in which to reconcile the spectroscopic versus cmd age discrepancy ? as discussed by rose ( 1994 ) , virtually every line index in the integrated spectrum of 47  tuc appears perfectly well - behaved , except the anomalously strong cn bands and anomalously weak h@xmath2 .",
    "jones ( 1996b ) speculated that perhaps the h@xmath2 `` problem '' was being caused by ch contamination in the h@xmath2 line ; because the central regions of 47  tuc (  the region over which our integrated spectrum was obtained ) is replete with cn - strong giants ( norris & freeman 1979 ; da costa 1997 ) , and there exists the well - known cn - ch anticorrelation for cn - strong giants ( norris , freeman & da costa 1984 ) , a scenario was envisaged whereby h@xmath2 might be weaker in cn - strong ( ch - weak ) stars .",
    "jones ( 1996b ) , though , was able to show , using a sample of 11 cn - strong and cn - weak giant and horizontal branch stars from m71 ( a cluster similar to 47  tuc ) , that this initial hypothesis was not supported by the data .",
    "the most obvious speculative source of the discrepancy is that some unidentified source of h@xmath2 _ emission is acting to `` fill in '' the h@xmath2 _ absorption feature .",
    "hesser & shawl ( 1977 ) provide an upper limit to the emission flux at h@xmath5 of f(h@xmath5)@xmath47erg@xmath48s@xmath29 . here",
    "we have used their most restrictive dataset -  @xmath49s@xmath29 ( from their 22/08/75 observations ) , coupled with the definition f(h@xmath5)@xmath50erg@xmath48s@xmath29 , from smith , hesser & shawl ( 1976 ) .",
    "now , the core of 47  tuc , with m@xmath51 ( and ignoring reddening ) , corresponds to a flux of @xmath52erg@xmath48s@xmath29@xmath29 .",
    "so , the hesser & shawl upper limit of @xmath53erg@xmath48s@xmath29 corresponds to @xmath54  of equivalent width at h@xmath5 .",
    "several simplifying assumptions must be made to go from h@xmath5 to h@xmath2 - specifically , under case b conditions and a temperature of @xmath55k , radiative recombination leads to an intrinsic ratio l(h@xmath5)/l(h@xmath2)@xmath56 , which gets reduced by a factor 1.7 , reflecting the ratio of continuum flux at h@xmath5 to that at h@xmath2 ( employing the worthey 1994 models ) .",
    "in other words , h@xmath2 is a factor of @xmath57 weaker than h@xmath5 ; recalling the constraint at h@xmath5 of @xmath58 , this corresponds to @xmath59  of equivalent width at h@xmath2 . _",
    "_    from figures [ fig : fig3 ] and [ fig : fig4 ] , we can see that the h@xmath2 `` discrepancy '' amounts to @xmath60 , in that we _ a priori expected an equivalent width of @xmath61 , to match the known cmd age of 47  tuc , as opposed to the @xmath62  observed .",
    "recalling that the inferred upper limit to emission fill - in at h@xmath2 ( from the previous paragraph ) was @xmath63 , we can see that the requisite @xmath64  of emission needed to reconcile the cmd and spectroscopic ages is not entirely excluded by the hesser & shawl ( 1977 ) observations , although little room is left to maneuver should new h@xmath5 emission observations push this limit even lower . _",
    "the situation regarding the anomalously low h@xmath2 index in 47  tuc remains as it was at the time of the rose ( 1994 ) and jones ( 1996b ) studies -  47  tuc appears normal in virtually every line index , except h@xmath2 , and to date no satisfactory explanation has been put forth .",
    "emission fill - in has not been entirely excluded , but the constraints are tight , as shown above . should such emission prove to be the ultimate resolution of the discrepancy though , it will beg the question as to exactly which mechanism is responsible , and why it differs from the local calibrating stars used to derive the model sequences of figures [ fig : fig3 ] and [ fig : fig4 ] .",
    "from the outset , our goal was a simple one - to provide an independent test of the jones & worthey ( 1995 ) h@xmath0 fe4668 diagnostic ( and the jones 1996a h@xmath0cai@xmath0 diagnostic ) as a tool for breaking the long - standing age - metallicity degeneracy plaguing integrated spectra of stellar populations . such a test can only be done ( properly ) upon systems with independently - derived ages and metallicities ; local metal - rich globular clusters with accurate , deep , cmds , provide an ideal test - bed .",
    "our new high @xmath65 , high resolution , integrated spectrum of 47  tuc shows anomalously low h@xmath2 absorption , which when tied to the diagnostic models of jones & worthey ( 1995 ) , shows , for the first time , that the inferred spectroscopic age is well in excess of 20gyr .",
    "this is clearly at odds with the cmd age of @xmath1gyr .",
    "no suitable explanation as to the source of this discrepancy has been found , despite the best efforts of rose ( 1994 ) and jones ( 1996b ) .",
    "emission , amounting to @xmath60of equivalent width at h@xmath2 , is required to reconcile the discrepancy .",
    "such emission is not excluded by the hesser & shawl ( 1977 ) observations of 47  tuc ( which set an upper limit of @xmath66  at h@xmath2 ) , but if it is the responsible mechanism , must be lurking just marginally below the limit set by these early fabry - perot observations . clearly , a deeper re - visit is called for .    it is true that the jones & worthey ( 1995 ) h@xmath0fe4668 age - metallicity diagnostic will remain an invaluable tool for age - dating integrated spectra of early - type systems , but perhaps the most important conclusion to take from our simple test of the technique is that it is not infallible .",
    "clearly , it will be imperative to extend our analysis to a larger sample of metal - rich globulars , galactic open clusters , and star clusters in the magellanic clouds  such an analysis will demonstrate whether 47  tuc is a pathological case or the inconsistent spectroscopic age derived here is indicative of an endemic , and currently underappreciated , flaw in the technique .",
    "we wish to thank guy worthey , jim rose , and ken freeman for their helpful advice .",
    "a special word of thanks is aimed at the referee , who went above and beyond the call of duty in aiding us in the interpretation of the hesser & shawl ( 1977 ) observations .",
