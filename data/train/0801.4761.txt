    "astronomical observations can probe the material ejected by supernova ( sn ) explosions during two transient phases with very different time scales . the initial optical transient ( the sn itself ) lasts for several months , and the ejecta structure can be studied through the emission and absorption lines produced as the photosphere recedes into the exploded star .",
    "after the sn fades away , the ejected material starts to interact with its surroundings , and the supernova remnant ( snr ) phase begins . in this phase , the ejecta structure",
    "is revealed by the x - ray emission of the material heated by the reverse shock on timescales of hundreds or thousands of years .",
    "both approaches are valid in principle , but up to now the disparity of the timescales involved has made it impossible to verify their mutual consistency by applying them to the same object .",

    "in a recent paper , @xcite ( henceforth r07 ) examined the light echo associated with snr 0509@xmath067.5 , and established that this object originated in a type ia explosion , in agreement with the longstanding claims based on x - ray observations ( * ? ? ?",

    "furthermore , the quality of the light echo was such that it allowed for a meaningful comparison with the spectra of a variety of type ia sne . based on these comparisons ,",
    "r07 concluded that the parent event of snr 0509@xmath067.5  belonged to the group of overluminous , highly energetic type ia sne whose prototype is sn 1991 t @xcite .",

    "this paper is organized as follows . in   [ sec : ddt ] , we begin with a brief overview of delayed detonation models . in   [ sec : dynamics ] , we use these explosion models , together with the forward shock radius and velocity to constrain the dynamics of snr 0509@xmath067.5 . in   [ sec : observations ] , we review the _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations of 0509@xmath067.5 , and we calculate the values for the most relevant line centroids and line flux ratios . in   [ sec : modeling ] we describe the hd+nei models , and we evaluate them against both the dynamic and spectral constraints posed by the observations of 0509@xmath067.5 .",
    "finally , we discuss our results and present our conclusions in ",
    "[ sec : disc - concl ] .",
    "since they were first introduced by @xcite , delayed detonations ( ddts ) have become the most successful models for type ia sne . in this kind of explosion ,",
    "the burning front starts propagating as a subsonic flame ( deflagration ) in the central regions of a c+o white dwarf ( wd ) close to the chandrasekhar mass , and then a transition to a supersonic regime ( detonation ) is artificially induced , usually at a prescribed density @xmath5 .",
    "the resulting ejecta structure is characterized by an approximately exponential density profile , with a composition dominated by fe - peak nuclei in the center , surrounded by a shell rich in intermediate mass elements ( imes : si , s , ar , ca , etc . ) , and a thinner outer region dominated by o. minor traces of c might remain at large radii , but most of the wd is burnt in the explosion .",
    "spherically symmetric ddt models are able to explain the fundamental properties of type ia sne , including light curve shapes @xcite , optical and ir spectral evolution @xcite , and spectropolarimetric observations @xcite .    .",
    "each model is labeled in the plot , indicating the corresponding value of @xmath5 in units of @xmath6 .",
    "[ fig-1 ] ]    the deflagration - to - detonation transition density @xmath5 is the most important parameter in ddt explosions .",
    "models with higher values of @xmath5 are more energetic , and synthesize more fe - peak elements , less imes , and less o than models with low values of @xmath5 . since type ia",
    "light curves are powered by the radioactive decay of @xmath4ni , more energetic models lead to more luminous sne @xcite .",
    "the luminosity of type ia sne is also tightly correlated to the light curve width @xcite , although the physical processes connecting this parameter and the mass of @xmath4ni synthesized in the explosion are not as simple as was initially thought ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in any case",
    ", the relationship between type ia sn luminosity ( or light curve width ) and the chemical structure of sn ejecta has now been firmly established by @xcite , and is consistent with the predictions of one - dimensional ddt models .",
    "the fundamental properties of the grid of ddt models that we will use in the present work are plotted in figure [ fig-1 ] , which can be compared to the ` zorro ' diagram in @xcite .",

    "the total masses of @xmath4ni synthesized in the models are @xmath8 ( ddta ) , @xmath9 ( ddtc ) , @xmath10 ( ddte ) , @xmath11 ( ddtg ) .",
    "to put these values in context , the estimated @xmath4ni masses in the 20 objects considered ` normal ' by @xcite range between @xmath12 ( for sn 1991 t ) and @xmath13 ( for sn 1991 m ) . a theoretical upper limit to the mass of radioactive ni that can be obtained from the thermonuclear burning of a chandrasekhar c+o wd is set by the prompt detonation model det in @xcite , which yields @xmath14 of @xmath4ni with @xmath15 erg .",
    "the dynamics of 0509@xmath067.5  are constrained by two pieces of observational evidence .",
    "the first is the angular radius measured by _",

    "* ) , which translates into a linear radius of @xmath17 cm ( @xmath18 pc ) at the known distance to the lmc ( 50 kpc , * ? ? ?",
    "this measurement can be considered very accurate , because the errors on both angular radius and distance are extremely small ( at the few percent level ) .",
    "the second observable is the forward shock ( fs ) velocity inferred by modeling the broad component of the ly@xmath19 emission line , @xmath20 @xcite .",
    "being a less direct measurement , the fs velocity is more subject to uncertainty than the fs radius , so this value should be considered with some measure of caution ( see discussion in   5.1 of * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . to reproduce the dynamics of 0509@xmath067.5 ,",
    "we have used a one - dimensional hydrodynamic code to simulate the interaction between the ejecta density profiles from the ddt explosion models in our grid and a uniform ambient medium ( am ; for more details on the models and a justification of the uniform am hypothesis , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . a successful snr model must be able to match both fs radius and velocity for a reasonable combination of age @xmath21 and am density @xmath22 .",
    "the comparison between hydrodynamic models and observations , however , is not completely straightforward , because our simulations do not include the effect of cosmic ray ( cr ) acceleration .",
    "this physical process can strongly modify the dynamics of the snr , slowing down the fs and reducing the gap between fs and contact discontinuity ( cd ) by an amount that depends on the acceleration efficiency @xcite .",
    "indeed , wh04 found evidence for a significant nonthermal component in the x - ray spectrum of 0509@xmath067.5  and argued that cr acceleration was taking place at the fs .",
    "although the presence of nonthermal emission does not necessarily imply that the dynamics are cr - modified , we consider this to be a likely possibility .",
    "it is important to note that cr acceleration at the fs does not have an impact on the dynamics of the shocked ejecta , and in particular , it does not affect the position of the cd ( at least to first order , see fig . 2 in * ? ? ?",
    "this means that the cr - modified snr radius must lie between the fs radius @xmath23 and the cd radius @xmath24 in hydrodynamic models without cr acceleration . for one - dimensional models",
    ", it is necessary to allow for the fact that rayleigh - taylor instabilities at the cd increase the projected radius by @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "likewise , the cr - modified fs velocity must lie between the fs velocity @xmath26 and the cd velocity @xmath27 .",
    "we have summarized these constraints in figure [ fig-2 ] for the most and least energetic models in our ddt grid , ddta and ddtg .",
    "the ddt models require that the snr age be between 250 and 610 yr to reproduce the fs dynamics , in very good agreement with the completely independent @xmath28 yr estimate from the light echoes ( r05 ) .",
    "the allowed values of @xmath22 lie between @xmath29 and @xmath30 , with more energetic models demanding higher am densities .",

    "the net exposure time was 47.9 ks , and the image was taken on the back - illuminated s3 chip .",
    "the authors found that the x - ray spectrum is dominated by line emission from the sn ejecta , with a small continuum contribution , probably nonthermal emission from the fs .",

    "this might be due to the simplicity of the plane shock models used by wh04 , but the poor statistics of the fe k@xmath32 blend in the _ chandra _  acis - s data set also make it difficult to constrain the properties of shocked fe in 0509@xmath067.5 .    for the present work , we have recalibrated the _",

    "two examples are presented in figure [ fig-7 ] , where the o k@xmath32/si k@xmath32 flux ratio and the centroid of the si k@xmath32 blend are compared with the observed values across the ( @xmath22 , @xmath21 ) parameter space for model ddta . at ages below 400 yr , most of the o is in the he - like ionization stage for the @xmath22 values imposed by the fs radius .",
    "this makes the o k@xmath32 emission too strong , with o k@xmath32/si k@xmath32 ratios in excess of 5 times the observed value .",
    "above 400 yr , the o k@xmath32/si k@xmath32 ratio is in the allowed region , but then the he - like ion of si becomes dominant in the plasma , pushing the centroid toward higher energies that are incompatible with the value measured by _",
    "chandra _  and _ xmm - newton_. these comparisons are less favorable for the other ddt models , because their higher o content and lower @xmath7 tend to increase the disagreement between the dynamical and spectral constraints .",
    "one last constraint on the age of 0509@xmath067.5  comes from the lack of recorded historical evidence for a recent sn in the lmc .",
    "a normal to bright type ia sn at a distance of 50 kpc would remain visible for several months , with an apparent visual magnitude around @xmath01.0 at maximum light ( the average extinction towards the lmc is 0.3 mag , * ? ? ?",
    ". such an event would be hard to miss by even the most inattentive observers .",
    "european exploration of the southern hemisphere was well under way 400 years ago , led by skilled navigators who relied heavily on astronomy and monitored the night sky whenever possible .",
    "pieter dirkszoon keyser and frederik de houtman mapped the southern sky ( including mensa and doradus , which encompass the lmc ) from java between 1595 and 1597 , noting the positions of all the stars brighter than 5@xmath117 magnitude . in this island , the dutch colony of batavia ( present day jakarta , at @xmath118 s latitude ) and the english colony of bantam became permanent around 1600 . in south america , several spanish settlements were thriving decades before that , including lima ( founded 1535 , @xmath119 s ) and buenos aires ( permanent since 1580 , @xmath120 s ) , from which the lmc is circumpolar . even allowing for some incompleteness in the historical records , a spectacular astronomical event like a bright lmc supernova should have left some kind of trace if it happened at any time later than the beginning of the 17@xmath117 century .",
    "taken together , the light echoes from the sn , the dynamic and spectral properties of the snr , and the historical considerations , suggest an age very close to @xmath121 yr for the birth event of 0509@xmath067.5 .",
    "the uncertainty around this value is hard to quantify , but deviations larger than a few decades seem unlikely , specially towards younger ages .",
    "we have seen that one - dimensional ddt models can reproduce the fundamental properties of the ejecta emission in 0509@xmath067.5with remarkable accuracy .",
    "it is outside the scope of this paper to perform an exhaustive exploration of other type ia explosion paradigms like @xcite did for the tycho snr , but for the sake of completeness we discuss here some results obtained using other models . in figure [ fig-8 ]",
    "we present the line flux ratios at @xmath111 yr predicted by a sub - chandrasekhar explosion ( model sch from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) and a well - mixed 3d deflagration ( model b30_3d_768 from * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in each case",
    ", we have overlaid the dynamical constraints on @xmath22 obtained with the procedure explained in   [ sec : dynamics ] .",
    "the sub - chandrasekhar model clearly shows that the overlap between spectral and dynamical constraints found in the energetic ddt models is not trivial , and indeed does not happen for the ejecta structure of this edge - lit wd detonation .",
    "the well - mixed 3d deflagration model has more severe problems : the presence of fe and o everywhere in the ejecta leads to a systematic overprediction of the o k@xmath32/si k@xmath32 and fe l / si k@xmath32 flux ratios at all values of @xmath22 .",
    "form models sch ( top panels ) and b30_3d_768 ( bottom panels ) at @xmath111 yr . all labels and plots are as in figure [ fig-5 ] .",
    "[ fig-8 ] ]      in the previous sections we have taken the approach of focusing on a few parameters that can be both reliably extracted from the observations _ and _ confidently modeled with the existing spectral codes .",
    "this is a more meaningful and robust way of comparing synthetic spectra generated with hd+nei models to data than the conventional method of @xmath78 fitting across the entire x - ray band ( for discussions , see * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . nevertheless , it is always instructive to study the performance of the spectral models from a more global point of view . in figure",
    "[ fig-9 ] , we plot the synthetic spectra of the ddt models at @xmath111 yr for the best value of @xmath22 within the dynamical constraints , together with the _ xmm - newton _  epic - pn data set . in each model ,",
    "the value of @xmath19 has been chosen to give the best approximation to the fe k@xmath32/si k@xmath32 flux ratio : @xmath122 for model ddta and @xmath123 for models ddtc , ddte , and ddtg .",
    "no spectral fitting of any kind has been done . instead",
    ", the ejecta models have been normalized to match the si k@xmath32 line and then a power law with the parameters determined in   [ sub : spectral - fits ] ( @xmath124 , @xmath125 ) has been added for the continuum .",
    "absorption has been set to the fiducial @xmath46 in all cases . by foregoing any spectral fitting",
    ", we can more easily compare the properties of the ejecta models to the data and to each other .",
    "the performance of our model of choice , ddta ( @xmath114 , @xmath122 ) is very good at all energies , albeit with some problems in localized areas .",
    "the flux in the fe l complex is somewhat low , and the shape shows deviations from the observed spectrum",
    ". these discrepancies might be due mostly to the limitations in the atomic data discussed in ",
    "[ sub : methods ] .",
    "other problems are probably related to the explosion model , such as the deficit in the mg k@xmath32 flux and the low centroid of the ca k@xmath32 blend yr , @xmath126 , @xmath127 ) and the x - ray emission from the tycho snr .",
    "this suggests that the mg content in our ddt models might be underestimated , and the distribution of ca in the ejecta might be biased towards low densities . ] .",
    "the degradation of the synthetic spectra along the sequence of ddt models with decreasing @xmath7 ( or @xmath5 ) is plain to see in figure [ fig-9 ] , specially in the behavior of the fe and o emission .",
    "normalization distances can be calculated for each model , yielding 36 kpc ( ddta ) , 51 kpc ( ddtc ) , 23 kpc ( ddte ) , and 29 kpc ( ddtg ) .",
    "given the coarseness of our @xmath22 grid , values within @xmath128 of the distance to the lmc can be considered satisfactory .",
    "a more accurate study of the normalization distances can not be justified without the inclusion of multidimensional effects in the hd+nei simulations ( see   8.1 in * ? ? ?",
    "we conclude this section with a brief mention of the continuum emission .",
    "detailed modeling of this component of the x - ray spectrum is outside the scope of the present work , but our hd+nei calculations can help clarify the issue of its origin raised by wh04 . at high energies ( @xmath129 kev ) , the flux of the thermal am emission in our hd+nei models ( for @xmath114 and @xmath111 yr at a distance of 50 kpc ) is a factor 6 below the power law models listed in table [ tab-1 ] .",
    "this is a strong indication that the origin of the continuum emission in 0509@xmath067.5  is indeed nonthermal .",
    "the light echo observations of r05 and r07 have turned 0509@xmath067.5  into a unique object : the only x - ray bright snr whose type ia origin is confirmed and whose explosion energy can be estimated based on spectroscopic information from its parent supernova .",
    "motivated by these groundbreaking observations , we have re - examined the dynamics and x - ray spectrum of 0509@xmath067.5 , applying the hd+nei modeling techniques introduced in @xcite and @xcite to _ chandra _  and _ xmm - newton _  observations .",
    "we have based our analysis on a grid of one - dimensional ddt explosions , taking advantage of the relationship between ejecta structure and @xmath7 in these models to place the birth event of 0509@xmath067.5  in the sequence of dim to bright type ia sne .",
    "our conclusions are in excellent agreement with the light echo results of r07 : snr 0509@xmath067.5  was originated by a bright , highly energetic type ia event of the subtype often referred to as sn 1991t - like .",
    "we thus present , for the first time , a scenario where the dynamics and x - ray spectrum of a type ia snr form a consistent picture with the spectroscopy of its parent supernova .",
    "our preferred type ia explosion model , ddta , has a kinetic energy of @xmath130 erg , and synthesizes @xmath131 of fe , @xmath132 of si , @xmath133 of s , @xmath134 of o , and @xmath135 of other elements ( mostly ar and ca ) .",
    "the peak bolometric luminosity of this model is @xmath136 , and the amount of @xmath4ni in the ejecta before nuclear decays is @xmath8 .",
    "these values compare very well with the estimates for sn 1991 t : @xmath137 @xcite ; @xmath138 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* uvoir method ) , @xmath139 ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* b - band lightcurve method ) .",
    "the ejecta density and chemical composition profiles in model ddta ( @xmath140 , @xmath122 ) can reproduce very well both the dynamics ( fs radius and velocity ) and the fundamental properties of the x - ray spectrum ( o , si , s , and fe emission ) of 0509@xmath067.5  at an age of 400 yr .",
    "several dynamical , spectral , and historical arguments indicate that the snr age can not be very different from this value , which also coincides with the completely independent estimate derived by r05 from the geometry of the light echo .    these results , together with our previous work on the tycho snr @xcite , constitute firm evidence that the phenomenological one - dimensional ddt models , which have proved so successful in explaining the light curves and spectra of type ia sne , are equally capable of reproducing the fundamental properties of the x - ray emission from young type ia snrs .",
    "in particular , it is possible to use hd+nei simulations based on these ddt models to estimate the kinetic energy ( and ultimately the brightness ) of a type ia sn explosion from the x - ray spectrum of its snr .",
    "hundreds of years after the sn explosion , the memory of the cataclysmic event persists in the x - rays from its snr , opening a window onto ages past .",
    "this enables us to explore the relationship between individual dim / bright type ia sne and their immediate surroundings ( presence or absence of stellar formation , local metallicities , etc . ) with much greater detail than is available to extragalactic studies ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in the context of snr research ,",
    "having a good estimate for @xmath7 can help to build better models for the impact of cr acceleration on the snr dynamics .",
    "hd+nei simulations have clearly become a powerful and flexible tool to study the relationship between snrs and their parent sne . for interested readers ,",
    "the synthetic x - ray spectra from our models are available from the authors upon request .",
    "we conclude with a reminder that much is left to do in the study of type ia sne and their snrs in general , and of 0509@xmath067.5 in particular .",
    "ongoing direct measurements of the ejecta and fs expansion using grating observations and proper motion studies should improve our knowledge of the dynamics of this snr in the near future .",
    "further work on the x - ray emission should take the asymmetries of the object into account , in particular the enhanced fe knots found by wh04 .",
    "the one - dimensional models presented here can only sample the average or bulk properties of the shocked ejecta .",
    "observational evidence for moderate asymmetries @xcite and clumping @xcite in the ejecta of type ia sne is widespread , and snr studies offer a unique opportunity to study these effects .",
    "this might provide crucial constraints for the multi - dimensional simulations of physically - motivated ddt explosions currently under way @xcite    the authors would like to thank armin rest , tom matheson , jos l. prieto , and the rest of the supermacho team for their stimulating work on the light echoes from 0509@xmath067.5  and for discussing several details of their results in advance of publication .",
