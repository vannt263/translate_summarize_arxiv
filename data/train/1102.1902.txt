    "the muskat problem @xcite models the evolution of an interface between two fluids of different characteristics in porous media by means of darcy s law : @xmath0 where @xmath1 , @xmath2 is the incompressible velocity ( i.e. @xmath3 ) , @xmath4 is the pressure , @xmath5 is the dynamic viscosity , @xmath6 is the permeability of the isotropic medium , @xmath7 is the liquid density , and @xmath8 is the acceleration due to gravity .",
    "more precisely , the interface separates the domains @xmath9 and @xmath10 defined by @xmath11 and @xmath12 are constants .",
    "this physical situation is also related to the evolution of two fluids of different characteristics in a hele - shaw cell @xcite , due to the fact that the laws which model both phenomena are mathematically analogous @xcite .",
    "this paper is concerned with the case @xmath13 which provides weak solutions of the following transport equation @xmath14 where initially the scalar @xmath15 is given by @xmath16    let the free boundary be parametrized by @xmath17 where @xmath18 is @xmath19-periodic in the space parameter @xmath20 or , an open contour vanishing at infinity @xmath21 with initial data @xmath22 . from darcy s law",
    ", we find that the vorticity is concentrated on the free boundary @xmath23 , and is given by a dirac distribution as follows : @xmath24 with @xmath25 representing the vorticity strength i.e. @xmath26 is a measure defined by @xmath27 with @xmath28 a test function .",
    "then @xmath29 evolves with an incompressible velocity field coming from the biot - savart law : @xmath30    as @xmath31 approaches a point @xmath29 on the contour the velocity @xmath32 agrees , modulo tangential terms , with the birkhoff - rott integral : @xmath33    this yields an appropriate contour dynamics system : @xmath34 where the term c represents the change of parametrization and does not modify the geometric evolution of the curve @xcite .",
    "the well - posedness is not guaranteed in general , in fact such a result turns out to be false for some initial data .",
    "rayleigh @xcite and saffman - taylor @xcite gave a condition that must be satisfied for the linearized model in order to have a solution locally in time , namely that the normal component of the pressure gradient jump at the interface has to have a distinguished sign .",
    "this is known as the rayleigh - taylor condition : @xmath35 where @xmath36 denotes the limit gradient of the pressure obtained approaching the boundary in the normal direction inside @xmath37 .",
    "we call @xmath38 the rayleigh - taylor of the solution @xmath39 .    understanding the problem as weak solutions of ( [ darcy]-[trasporte ] ) plus the incompressibility of the velocity , we find that the continuity of the pressure ( @xmath40 ) follows as a mathematical consequence , making unnecessary to impose it as a physical assumption ( for more details see @xcite and @xcite ) . for the surface tension case",
    ", there is a jump discontinuity of the pressure across the interface which is modeled to be equal to the local curvature times the surface tension coefficient : @xmath41 this is known as the laplace - young condition , which makes the initial value problem more regular .",
    "then there are no instabilities @xcite but fingering phenomena arise @xcite .    by means of darcy s law , we can find the following formula for the difference of the gradients of the pressure in the normal direction and the strength of the vorticity : @xmath42 @xmath43 above @xmath8 is taken equal to 1 for the sake of simplicity .    then , if we choose an appropriate term c in equation ( [ fullpm ] ) ( see section [ csle ] below ) , the dynamics of the interface satisfies @xmath44    a wise choice of parametrization of the curve is to have @xmath45 ( for more details see @xcite ) .",
    "this yields the denser fluid below the less dense fluid if @xmath46 and therefore the rayleigh - taylor condition holds as long as the interface is a graph .",
    "this fact has been used in @xcite to show local existence in the stable case ( @xmath47 ) , together with ill - posedness in the unstable situation ( @xmath48 ) . local existence for the general case ( @xmath49 )",
    "is shown in @xcite , which was also treated in @xcite .",
    "> from it is easy to find the evolution equation for the graph : @xmath50 the above equation can be linearized around the flat solution to find the following nonlocal partial differential equation @xmath51 where the operator @xmath52 is the square root of the laplacian .",
    "this linearization shows the parabolic character of the system .    furthermore the stable system gives a maximum principle @xmath53 @xcite",
    "; decay rates are obtained for the periodic case : @xmath54 and also for the case on the real line ( flat at infinity ) : @xmath55 there are several results on global existence for small initial data ( small compared to @xmath56 in several norms more regular than lipschitz @xcite ) taking advantage of the parabolic character of the equation for small initial data . in @xcite",
    "it is shown in the stable case that global existence for solutions holds if the first derivative of the initial data is smaller than an explicitly computable constant greater than @xmath57 . furthermore ,",
    "if @xmath58 and @xmath59 , then there exists a global - in - time solution that satisfies @xmath60\\times{\\mathbb{r}})\\cap l^\\infty([0,t];w^{1,\\infty}({\\mathbb{r}})),\\ ] ] for each @xmath61 .",
    "in particular @xmath62 is lipschitz continuous .",
    "moreover , equation yields an @xmath63 decay : @xmath64 which does not imply , for large initial data , a gain of derivatives in the system ( see @xcite ) .",
    "we will see below that the solutions to the muskat problem with initial data in @xmath65 become real analytic immediately despite the weakness of the above decay formula .",
    "the main result we present here is :    [ oneone ] there exists a nonempty open set of initial data in @xmath65 with rayleigh - taylor strictly positive @xmath66 such that in finite time the rayleigh - taylor @xmath67 of the solution of is strictly negative for all @xmath20 in a nonempty open interval .",
    "the geometry of this family of initial data is far from trivial : numerical simulations performed in @xcite show that there exist initial data with large steepness for which a regularizing effect appears .",
    "in fact , as will be explained in section  [ csle ] , the first evidence of a change of sign in the rayleigh - taylor has been experimentally found in a model with two interfaces .",
    "we proceed as follows :    first , in section 3 , we assume initial conditions at time @xmath68 that satisfy the rayleigh - taylor ( @xmath69 ) and the arc - chord condition , and for which the boundary @xmath70 initially belongs to @xmath65 . let @xmath71 be the constant in the arc - chord condition , let @xmath72 be an upper bound for the @xmath65 norm of the initial data and let @xmath73 be a lower bound for @xmath74",
    ". then there exists @xmath75 , with @xmath76 depending only on @xmath77 , such that the muskat problem has a solution for time @xmath78 $ ] , satisfying also the arc - chord and rayleigh - taylor conditions .",
    "moreover , for @xmath79 , the solution @xmath80 is real analytic in a strip @xmath81 , where @xmath82 depends only on @xmath77 .",
    "our goal in section 4 is to show that the region of analyticity does not collapse to the real axis as long as the rayleigh - taylor is greater than or equal to 0 .",
    "this allows us to reach a regime for which the boundary @xmath70 develops a vertical tangent .",
    "section 5 is devoted to showing the existence of a large class of analytic curves for which there exists a point where the tangent vector is vertical and the velocities indicate that the curves are going to turn over and reach the unstable regime for a small time .",
    "plugging these initial data into a cauchy - kowalewski theorem indicates that the analytic curves turn over .",
    "therefore the unstable regime is reached .",
    "finally , in section 6 , a perturbative argument allows us to conclude that we can find curves in @xmath65 close enough to the special class of analytic curves described in section 5 , which satisfy the arc - chord and rayleigh - taylor conditions .",
    "then we can show the existence of the curves passing the critical time and actually turning over .",
    "therefore the unstable regime is reached for an entire @xmath83neighborhood of initial data .    in a forthcoming paper ( see @xcite ) we will exhibit a particular initial datum for which we will show that once the curve reaches the unstable regime the strip of analyticity collapses in finite time and the solution breaks down . in section 8 we provide a very brief sketch of our proof of breakdown of smoothness for the muskat equation .",
    "these results were announced in @xcite .",
    "the same approach can be done for the water waves problem , which shows that , starting with some initial data given by @xmath84 , in finite time the interface reaches a regime in which it is no longer a graph . therefore there exists a time @xmath85 where the solution of the free boundary problem parametrized by @xmath86 satisfies @xmath87 ( see section [ ww ] ) .",
    "this scenario is known in the literature as wave breaking @xcite and there are numerical simulations showing this phenomenon @xcite .",
    "we conjecture that a result analogous to theorem [ oneone ] holds , in which surface tension is included .",
    "we may simply use the same initial data as in theorem [ oneone ] , and take the coefficient of surface tension to be very small .",
    "the solutions are presumably changed only slightly by the surface tension ( although we do not have a proof of this plausible assertion ) .",
    "consequently , we believe that muskat solutions with small surface tension can turn over .",
    "a similar remark applies to water waves ( see theorem [ waterwaves ] ) .",
    "there exist initial data for which water waves with surface tension turn over .",
    "a rigorous proof may be easily supplied , since local existence ( backwards and forward in time ) is known for water waves with surface tension ( see @xcite ) .",
    "here we present the evolution equation in terms of the free boundary which is going to be used throughout the paper , and the numerical experiment that motivated the theorem .      by darcy s law :    @xmath88 and biot - savart yields @xmath89 for the first coordinate above one finds @xmath90 @xmath91 using the identity @xmath92 therefore @xmath93 here we point out that in the biot - savart law the perpendicular direction appears , but after the above integration by parts , we only see the tangential direction .    adding the tangential term @xmath94 we find that the contour equation is given by @xmath95 for the @xmath19 periodic interface the equation becomes @xmath96 in order to see ( [ ecp ] ) we take @xmath97 ; it is easy to rewrite as follows ; @xmath98 the classical identity @xmath99 allows us to conclude that @xmath100 where @xmath101 .",
    "analogously , using the equality @xmath102 @xmath103 and adding the appropriate tangential term , we obtain equation .      our investigations started with the idea that interesting new phenomena may arise if we study three fluids , separated by two interfaces .",
    "careful numerical studies indicated that one of the interfaces may turn over . in attempting to prove analytically the turnover indicated by the numerics",
    ", we discovered that a turnover can occur also for a single interface , i.e. , for the muskat problem .",
    "this section describes one of our numerical experiments .",
    "proceeding as in the preceding section , one can derive the equations modeling the evolution of two interfaces separating three fluids with different densities @xmath104 ( @xmath105 ) .",
    "more precisely , assume that both interfaces can be parametrized by graphs @xmath106 and @xmath107 , with @xmath62 lying above @xmath108 .",

    "this graphic clearly indicates that the velocity field is forcing the interface to turn over .        the numerical approximation of addresses as a main difficulty the absolute lack of knowledge about the behavior of the solutions to .",
    "indeed , the goal of our experiments is precisely the search for some singular behavior .",
    "the nonlocal terms make the computations expensive and special care has to be taken in order to evaluate the integrands in a neighborhood of @xmath132 . for this , we used taylor expansions locally and computed exactly the principal value .",
    "in this situation , adaptivity is strongly indicated , both in space and time , since a good indicator of a singular behavior will be given either by a sudden accumulation of spatial nodes or a sudden reduction of the time steps .    in order to attain the highest resolution in the integration of and compute the solutions shown in figure  [ fig : sol ] , cubic spline interpolation of the curves @xmath133 and @xmath134 with periodic boundary conditions was used .",
    "this provides a @xmath135 interpolant of each interface at every time and allows , in particular , the evaluation of the convolution terms at any @xmath136 $ ] .",
    "then , adaptive quadrature can be applied to approximate the integrals and evaluate the derivative at any time . in the experiments",
    "reported , adaptive lobatto quadrature was used , by means of the matlab routine quadl . for the time integration , the embedded runge ",
    "kutta formula due to dormand and prince , dopri5(4 ) , was implemented , since the problem was not found to be particularly stiff , see for instance @xcite .",
    "the time stepping was combined with a spatial node redistribution after every successful step . for the redistribution of the spatial nodes an algorithm following @xcite was implemented , with some modifications taking into account that both interfaces are graphs . for several tolerance requirements and different choices of the parameters involved in the full adaptive routine",
    ", the integration always failed at a certain critical time , suggesting the explosion of the derivative at a certain point of the lower interface and the lack of validity of , once this curve stops being a graph .",
    "the phenomenon described above and the explicit representations of the maximum of the solutions derived in @xcite , motivated the search for special initial data which allowed us to understand that this behavior also arises in the one - interface case .",
    "here we show the main estimates that provide local - existence and instant analyticity for a single curve that satisfies initially the arc - chord and rayleigh - taylor conditions .",
