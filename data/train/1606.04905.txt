    "the radio galaxy fornax  a , well known for its radio lobes spanning @xmath6 , with a lobe - to - lobe separation of @xmath7 ( see * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , is one of the closest and brightest radio galaxies , located at a distance of only @xmath8mpc @xcite .",
    "hosted by the elliptical galaxy ngc1316 , the radio source contains a low - ionization nuclear emission - line region nucleus , which has been imaged to arcsecond - scale resolution and features a flat spectrum ( @xmath9 ; @xmath10 ) core with dual - opposing `` s''-shaped jets that are detected out to @xmath11kpc from the core @xcite .",
    "the radio lobes are characterized by a complex polarized filamentary structure with no observable hotspots @xcite .",
    "fornax  a was the first radio galaxy reported to emit diffuse , non - thermal x - ray emission from within its radio lobes from observations with rosat @xcite and asca @xcite , which were later confirmed through dedicated observations of the east lobe with _ xmm - newton _ @xcite and the west lobe with _ suzaku _ @xcite .",
    "the non - thermal x - rays have been widely attributed to inverse compton ( ic ) emission of relativistic electrons scattering on cosmic microwave background ( cmb ) photons , with the same population of relativistic electrons producing both synchrotron and ic emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "to date , similar leptonic ic / cmb emission has been detected in x - rays from tens of extended lobes in radio galaxies and quasars . in general ,",
    "such detections imply that the ratio of relativistic electron pressure to magnetic field pressure within the lobes is @xmath12@xmath13 @xcite .",
    "more recently , @xcite reported a detection of thermal emission from the western lobe of fornax  a using combined _ suzaku _ and _ xmm - newton _ data .",
    "thermal emission in the lobes of a radio galaxy is typically not seen , although evidence for this has also been reported in the giant lobes of the nearby radio galaxy centaurus a @xcite .",
    "motivated by the observed ( and presumed ic / cmb ) x - ray emission from the lobes of fornax  a , @xcite predicted that the high - energy tail of the ic / cmb would be detected by the large area telescope ( lat ; * ? ? ? * ) at @xmath4mev .",
    "following this , @xcite predicted that the lobes would also be detected in @xmath0 rays at higher energies by the lat due to ic upscattering of the infrared and optical extragalactic background light ( ebl ) photons , analogous to the cmb photons upscattered to x - ray energies .",
    "the association of fornax  a with the -lat second year catalog ( hereafter 2fgl ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) source 2fglj0322.4@xmath143717 thus raised an important question regarding the origin of the @xmath0-ray source , which at the time had no evidence presented for significant extension .",
    "in particular , a distinction between emission arising from the lobes and possible contamination from the central core region could not be established from the @xmath0-ray data alone , although x - ray and radio observations @xcite suggested that the contribution from the core was likely to be minimal .    in a recent study by @xcite , the spectrum of the fornax  a lobes was modeled in multiple wavelengths using both leptonic and hadronic production scenarios without knowledge of @xmath0-ray spatial extent or @xmath0-ray contamination from the galaxy core .",
    "they concluded the most likely source of @xmath0-ray production is hadronic processes within filamentary structures of the lobes .",
    "our study follows the successful @xmath0-ray detection of the extended lobes from centaurus  a @xcite , and lat studies of the lobes of ngc  6251 @xcite and centaurus  b @xcite .",
    "gamma - ray upper limits using h.e.s.s . and",
    "-lat observations have been used to constrain the hadronic cosmic - ray population within the radio lobes of hydra  a @xcite .",
    "fornax  a is not associated with a @xmath0-ray source in the most recent , third -lat catalog based on four years of lat data @xcite .",
    "however , the centroid of the source 3fgl  j0322.5@xmath143721 is offset by @xmath15 from the core of fornax  a. this offset is greater than the 95% position uncertainty of the 3fgl source . in the following we discuss possible reasons for this offset , detail a significant @xmath0-ray detection of extended emission from fornax  a using @xmath1 years of -lat data , and present modeling under leptonic and hadronic scenarios .",
    "detecting extended emission from fornax  a with the lat is challenging because the 68% containment point - spread function ( psf ) radius is @xmath16 at @xmath17gev , which is larger than the fornax  a lobe - to - lobe separation .",
    "the lat psf is energy dependent going from @xmath18 at 100mev to @xmath19 at 100gev with 68% confidence[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "unlike all studies mentioned in section  [ section - intro ] , we used @xmath1 years ( from 2008 august 4 to 2014 september 4 ) of pass  8 lat data .",
    "compared to previous iterations of the lat event - level analysis , pass  8 provides greater acceptance and a psf @xcite , as well as event type partitions according to psf[multiblock footnote omitted ] , which we used in this analysis .",
    "all of these factors allowed for a firm detection of extension of fornax  a. we selected from all - sky survey data at energies from 0.1 to 300gev extracted from a region of interest ( roi ) with @xmath20 radius centered at the j2000.0 radio position of fornax  a ( r.a.@xmath21 , decl.@xmath22 , * ? ? ?",

    "fermi _ science tools ` v10r01p00 ` and instrument response functions ( irfs ) ` p8r2_source_v6 ` were used for this analysis[multiblock footnote omitted ] .    to model the lat data",
    ", we included all sources from the 3fgl within @xmath20 of the radio core position of fornax  a. the diffuse background was modeled using preliminary versions of galactic diffuse and isotropic spectral templates recommended by the -lat collaboration , of which the finalized versions have been released to the public[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "several tests were performed , and we determined that the results presented here with the preliminary diffuse models are compatible with those obtained with the finalized models .",
    "we used the same spectral models as in the 3fgl catalog for all background sources , and the normalization and spectral shape parameters of all point sources were left free during optimization . for the diffuse models ,",
    "only the normalization parameters were left free .",
    "we initially modeled fornax  a as a point source located at the position of the radio core , removing 3fgl j0322.5@xmath143721 from the model since it is offset from the radio core by @xmath15 .",
    "we optimized the localization using the ` gtfindsrc ` tool provided in the science tools in unbinned mode .",
    "the best - fit localization is r.a.@xmath25 , decl.@xmath26 with a 95% confidence error circle radius of @xmath27 , slightly southeast of the position of the fornax  a core and consistent with the reported 3fgl localization .",
    "figure  [ fig : residuals ] shows the best - fit localization ( point b ) and the core ( point a ) as well as the 2fgl and 3fgl error contours plotted on top of the relative residual counts map .",
    "optimizing the model with the single point source at point b , we detect @xmath0-ray emission at a test statistic ( ts ) is defined as twice the difference between the logarithmic likelihood of the null hypothesis @xmath28 and the alternative hypothesis being tested @xmath29 @xcite : @xmath30 . ]",
    "the spectrum was modeled as a single power law with a resulting maximum - likelihood photon index @xmath31 and a full band energy flux of @xmath32erg @xmath33 s@xmath34 ( see table  [ tab : ts ] ) .",
    "systematic errors are due to the systematic uncertainty in the lat effective area[multiblock footnote omitted ] .",
    "these fluxes and indices are consistent with those reported in the catalogs for sources 2fglj0322.4@xmath143717 and 3fgl j0322.5@xmath143721 .      in the following ,",
    "we describe several tests performed to determine the morphology of the observed @xmath0-ray emission from the direction of fornax  a , as summarized in tables  [ tab : loglike ]  &  [ tab : ts ] .",
    "all tests on extension and morphology made full use of the additional spatial information brought about by the new pass  8 psf event type partitions .",
    "the broadband flux and spectrum optimizations in addition to these tests were performed using all psf types in composite likelihood .          to determine if the @xmath0-ray emission is extended beyond that of a point source we modeled fornax  a as a flat circular disk of various sizes ( @xmath35 to @xmath36 in steps of @xmath35 ) by producing several disk templates centered at the best - fit location of the lat source described in section  [ section - lat ] ( point b in figure  [ fig : residuals ] ) .",
    "the uniform disk is the simplest spatial model , and the use of a gaussian profile has typically been shown to produce comparatively little difference in the overall likelihood and best - fit spectral parameters @xcite . using ` gtlike ` in binned mode ( with bin size @xmath37 )",
    ", we determined the overall likelihood @xmath38 as a function of the disk radius @xmath39 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : disks ] , @xmath38 is peaked at @xmath40 , which is roughly compatible with the extent of the lobes as observed in radio ( @xmath41ghz at @xmath42 resolution , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . by comparing the likelihood of the peak radius with the near - zero radius of @xmath43 ( effectively a point source )",
    ", we found that the @xmath0-ray emission is spatial extended with @xmath44 confidence ( @xmath45 = 17.3 , 1 degree of freedom , * ? ? ? * ) .",
    "see tables  [ tab : loglike ] and [ tab : ts ] for more information .      with the aim of making no prior assumptions about the morphology of the @xmath0-ray emission in this region , we used the roi fit with our position - optimized point source as described in section  [ section - lat ] and removed that point source from the model , thereby leaving only the background sources . using this background model",
    ", we created a map of residual counts above 1 gev in the roi by subtracting the model s predicted counts from the observed counts in each bin .",
    "apart from the emission near fornax  a , the map of residuals is flat in significance and the distribution of significance values for the bins is gaussian , indicating there are no significant systematic deviations from the roi model .",
    "the map of residual counts shown in figure  [ fig : residuals ] is cropped to a @xmath46 region centered around the fornax  a core .",
    "the shape of the residuals suggests a non - circular morphology that resembles the known extended radio morphology .",
    "the contours of radio emission from a vla @xmath41ghz image at @xmath42 resolution @xcite , with the radio core subtracted , are overlaid in figure  [ fig : residuals ] .",
    "we also tested a model which included two separate point sources whose initial locations were chosen by eye based upon the residual counts .",
    "the locations of these two point sources were then optimized using ` gtfindsrc ` .",
    "the best - fit location of the western point source ( labeled d in figure  [ fig : residuals ] ) matches well the western lobe s centroid while the eastern point ( labeled e in figure  [ fig : residuals ] ) is offset from the centroid of the eastern lobe .",
    "the double point - source model is preferred over the single point - source model at a confidence level of @xmath47 .",
    "table [ tab : loglike ] details these results and table [ tab : ts ] lists the fit parameters .",
    "note that the spectral index is statistically compatible with the single point - source model and for both point sources in the double point - source model .      assuming that the same electron energy distribution determined from the radio emission scatters optical ebl photons to produce @xmath0 rays , then a reasonable guess for the @xmath0-ray morphology should be the observed radio structure .",
    "the lobes of fornax  a were found to emit non - thermal ic scattered x - rays , with excellent spatial coincidence to the radio structure produced by synchrotron - emitting relativistic electrons @xcite .",
    "diffuse hard x - ray emission associated with the east lobe has been confirmed with _",
    "xmm - newton _",
    "@xcite , implying the magnetic field is reasonably uniform , further supporting the expectation that the @xmath0 rays should match the radio morphology . under these circumstances , as was observed in centaurus a @xcite , the relativistic electrons will trace the @xmath0-ray emission @xcite .",
    "these assumptions could be incorrect ; however , for the purpose of constraining the ebl with the @xmath0-ray flux , using the radio structure is the best choice for the spatial distribution .",
    "physically , fornax  a images from the wilkinson microwave anisotropy probe ( _ wmap _ ) might be a better choice of template for the @xmath0-ray emission because the synchrotron radiation within @xmath48@xmath49ghz should be originating from the same band of relativistic electrons that ic scatter into @xmath50@xmath51gev @xmath0 rays .",
    "we revisit this topic later in the section .",
    "we created a spatial template of the lobe emission using vla @xmath41ghz radio data @xcite , which offers a more - than - adequate spatial resolution of @xmath42 .",
    "both the central core of fornax  a and various radio point sources inside the lobe structure were manually removed from the spatial template , the former by reduction to zero and the latter by interpolation of the adjacent lobe - dominated flux .",
    "the central core was reduced to zero because the lobes do not overlap with the central core @xcite .",
    "we found this template in addition to a point - source model of the core is preferred over just the point source at the core with a confidence of @xmath52 ( @xmath45 = 19.8 , 2 degrees of freedom ) .",
    "however , this combined model is preferred over the lobes template alone by only @xmath53 .",
    "moreover , in the combined point - source - and - lobes template fit only 14% of the energy flux is assigned to the core point source .",
    "see tables  [ tab : loglike ] and [ tab : ts ] for more information .",
    "we consider this as evidence that the @xmath0-ray emission from the core of fornax  a is insignificant .",
    "minimal @xmath0-ray flux from the central core is expected , as it is assumed to be synchrotron self - compton , and the radio flux from the core has been reported to be relatively weak compared to the luminous galaxy lobes @xcite .    in order to test the uniqueness of the radio template morphology and its rotational symmetry , we rotated the template around the central core in increments of @xmath54 and computed the likelihood at each one .",
    "the results from this test are shown in figure  [ fig : rotation ] and indicate that the template in its original orientation is preferred .",
    "in particular , we see the original orientation is a better model than the one rotated @xmath55 clockwise with @xmath56 confidence ( @xmath45=12.9 , 1 degree of freedom ) and @xmath55 counterclockwise with @xmath57 confidence ( @xmath45=18.9 , 1 degree of freedom ) .",
    "the maximum likelihood rotation was @xmath58 additionally , our plot of @xmath59 over template rotation angle shows a sinusoidal profile with a similar peak in likelihood around @xmath60 as around @xmath61 .",
    "this degeneracy indicates that the data are not constraining enough to statistically differentiate the lobes .",
    "modeling the lobes as separate point sources ( see section  [ section - blind ] ) results in the measurement of similar fluxes and spectral shapes for the two regions , but this is at odds with radio observations of the lobes . according to the @xmath41ghz vla observation @xcite",
    ", the west lobe has about twice the total flux than the east .",
    "in fact , the two point - source @xmath0-ray analysis indicated the east lobe may be slightly brighter ( but is within the statistical errors ) .",
    "this disagreement may be a symptom of our use of @xmath41ghz vla data instead of the very similar but more physically motivated @xmath48@xmath49ghz _ wmap _ data as a spatial template for the @xmath0-rays .",
    "indeed , the flux ratio of west to east is @xmath62 in the _ wmap _ @xmath63 and @xmath64ghz maps @xcite , closer to the @xmath0-ray result .",
    "however , fornax  a is at the resolving power of the lat in this analysis and the psf is broad enough ( @xmath16 radius at @xmath17gev ) that fine scale changes would be smoothed out and indistinguishable from the original , and small changes in the flux ratio between the lobes should leave the average flux nearly the same .",
    "this is highlighted by the similarity in overall likelihood we observe between @xmath61 and @xmath60 rotations of the @xmath41ghz vla template , where the rotation of @xmath60 is identical to a flux ratio of @xmath3 .",
    "in addition , even when using the spatial morphology of a single point source , the flux is nearly consistent with the radio template flux ( see section  [ section - lat ] ) .    with the aim of testing the region for the possibility of a contaminating background @xmath0-ray source , we added a point source to the lobes template model and optimized its position using ` gtfindsrc ` .",

    "for each time interval , the emission associated with fornax  a was fit to a single point source ( positioned at the best - fit location b in figure  [ fig : residuals ] ) , as we expected any potential variable emission to be associated with a point source at the core and not the lobes .",

    "this result was enabled thanks to the improvements brought about by the new pass  8 event reconstruction , rather than the marginal increase in exposure time ( i.e. , 6 years of data in our study instead of 5 years in theirs ) .",
    "we model the @xmath0-ray emission following @xcite , in which the relativistic electrons in the lobes of the radio galaxy are ic scattered off of cmb and ebl photons . for a given electron energy distribution ( eed ) of the lobes , the resulting ic emission will consist of a lower - energy component due to cmb photons , as well as two components at higher energy due to the cosmic infrared and optical backgrounds ( cib and cob , respectively ) .",
    "while the ebl energy density is only a few percent that of the cmb , the resulting ic spectrum due to cib and cob photons will be shifted in frequency by @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the maximum lorentz factor of the eed .",

    "note that because fornax  a is an extended source in other wavelengths as well , care must be taken in defining the spatial structure in all wavelengths in order to draw meaningful comparisons .",
    "this model makes use of currently available _ total _ lobe fluxes .",
    "_ wmap _ and planck fluxes reported by @xcite were obtained using resolution - dependent apertures that did not fully enclose the extent of the synchrotron lobe emission .",
    "we assumed a lobe magnetic field strength of 1.65@xmath118 g , constrained to the x - ray flux data point , and we include photon contributions from the host galaxy following @xcite .",
    "the extracted spectral data points do not appear to match the predicted model shape based on ic / ebl emission alone .",
    "fully accounting for the -lat observed fluxes under the ic / ebl hypothesis alone would imply an ebl level that is even higher than the stecker model @xcite , which was ruled out by @xcite .",
    "consequently , the applied leptonic model can not completely explain the observed emission .",
    "the model relies upon the assumption that all of the x - ray flux observed from the lobes is created by ic / cmb scattering to obtain the magnetic field strength .",
    "if some amount of the x - ray flux is thermal emission ( as reported by * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , our expected ic / ebl level would decrease , creating further discrepancy between model and data .",
    "as discussed in section  [ section - radio ] , a more physically motivated choice of spatial template would be the higher - frequency _ wmap _ data .",
    "however , the resulting changes in flux and spectral shape should be within the statistical errors of our current results , and therefore should not alter our result that the flux exceeds the leptonic model of the fornax  a lobes .    note",
    "that the intensity of the ic contribution from the host galaxy photons of fornax  a is comparable to that of the ebl photons in the lobes , and it actually dominates at higher energies ( @xmath119gev , see figure  [ fig : sed ] ) .",
    "this differs from the case of centaurus  a , wherein the predicted ebl photon intensity is roughly five times that of the starlight @xcite .",
    "were it true that host galaxy photons dominate in fornax  a , the expected spatial distribution of @xmath0 rays from the lobes would not be uniform , with brighter emission nearer the center and less away from the core .",
    "testing for this feature requires spatial resolution that is beyond the capabilities of the lat with current statistics .",
    "the problem of the model not fitting the @xmath0-ray spectrum in fornax  a may be solved by an additional contribution from hadronic cosmic rays interacting within the lobes , as found by @xcite .",
    "we created a model of hadronic emission ( proton - proton interactions ) assuming a total emitting volume of @xmath120@xmath121 and a uniform distribution of thermal gas with number density @xmath122@xmath123 following @xcite , and a power - law cosmic - ray spectrum with energy index  2.3 extending from @xmath124gev up to more than 10tev .",
    "modeling the @xmath0 rays as entirely hadronic in origin requires a large total cosmic - ray energy of @xmath125erg , which is twice the observed energy of @xmath126erg in the lobes of comparable radio galaxy hydra a @xcite and very high compared to an estimate of @xmath127erg in the outburst that is assumed to have created the lobes of fornax  a @xcite .",
    "we then subtracted the lowest ic / ebl model @xcite from our lat spectral points and fit the residual flux as hadronic emission , and found we could achieve a reasonable fit , shown in figure [ fig : sed ] .",
    "the resulting cosmic - ray pressure fitted from this residual flux is @xmath128dyn@xmath33 and the total energy stored in cosmic rays is @xmath129erg .",
    "this total energy is similar to that of hydra a @xcite and closer to an estimate of the total energy in the fornax  a lobes @xcite .",
    "this result agrees with analogous calculations by @xcite , in which the discrepancy is explained by suggesting the emission is primarily hadronic and localized to relatively denser sub - structures within the lobes , thereby decreasing the effective emitting volume .",
    "we report the first -lat detection of extended @xmath0-ray emission from the radio galaxy fornax  a using @xmath1 years of -lat data .",
    "we conclude that a point - source spatial model is insufficient to describe the @xmath0-ray emission , and our analysis indicates it is likely the emission originates in the lobes .",
    "we investigated the origin of the extended emission by assuming leptonic emission that arises due to ic scattering of ebl photons off of relativistic electrons in the radio lobes .",
    "this leptonic modeling underestimates the observed @xmath0-ray emission for any current ebl estimate , consistent with the recent findings by @xcite , even after accounting for the additional contribution of ic emission off of the host galaxy light .",
    "a hadronic - only model ( proton - proton interactions ) requires implausibly large total cosmic - ray energy when compared to an estimate of the fornax  a outburst assumed to have created the lobes @xcite , and this problem can be alleviated by invoking denser sub - structures in the lobes @xcite .",
    "when we assume the lowest ebl model @xcite and fit the residual @xmath0-ray flux as hadronic production , our fit yields a total cosmic - ray energy of @xmath129erg , matching well with the hydra a energy @xcite , but still at least 100 times greater than the estimated total energy in the fornax  a lobes @xcite .",
    "thus , even the combined leptonic and hadronic scenario may not be able to explain the @xmath0-ray lobe emission .",
    "given our current understanding of the content of the radio lobes and the ebl , some contribution from leptonic processes must exist .",
    "if it is true that there is a @xmath0-ray component other than leptonic in fornax  a , we should expect to observe such a component in other nearby radio galaxies as well .",
    "our spatial analysis hinted at the existence of a background @xmath0-ray source ( c in figure [ fig : residuals ] ) .",
    "we re - evaluated the sed of fornax  a including this source in the model , but we found this background source addition is only marginally preferred and can not fully make up the difference between the data and the ic / ebl model . in any case ,",
    "@xmath0-ray contamination from an unresolved background source or the fornax cluster could be present .",
    "our modeling was done using previously published multiwavelength data .",
    "further analysis in other wavelengths in the future will yield a more definitive picture of the sed .",
    "more detailed observations , such as with the hard x - ray telescope _ nustar _ , would help determine if the x - ray emission is contaminated by thermal processes @xcite , which would test our initial assumptions that the radio data traces the x - rays and @xmath0 rays , and that the x - rays could be used to constrain the lobe magnetic field .",
    "-lat analysis at even lower energies ( below 100 mev ) may provide more information about the ic / cmb component @xcite .",
    "potentially with greater statistics , the -lat could extend the lobes detection to higher energies and additionally observe the effect of the host - galaxy photons on the spatial distribution of @xmath0 rays in the fornax  a lobes .",
    "the _ fermi _ lat collaboration acknowledges generous ongoing support from a number of agencies and institutes that have supported both the development and the operation of the lat as well as scientific data analysis .",
    "these include the national aeronautics and space administration and the department of energy in the united states , the commissariat  lenergie atomique and the centre national de la recherche scientifique / institut national de physique nuclaire et de physique des particules in france , the agenzia spaziale italiana and the istituto nazionale di fisica nucleare in italy , the ministry of education , culture , sports , science and technology ( mext ) , high energy accelerator research organization ( kek ) and japan aerospace exploration agency ( jaxa ) in japan , and the k.  a.  wallenberg foundation , the swedish research council and the swedish national space board in sweden ."
