    "recently , the stability of becs in an optical lattice moving at constant velocity has been experimentally investigated and it was demonstrated that the landau and dynamical instabilities occur when the velocity of the lattice potential exceeds certain critical values  @xcite .",
    "swallow - tail energy loops have been theoretically found in the band structure of becs in a periodic potential  @xcite and attracted much interests .",

    "however , the stability of swallow - tails has not been fully investigated because a detail study of linear stability problem is still lacking .",
    "one needs to identify the unstable modes of excitations by solving the bogoliubov equations .    in this paper , in order to understand the superfluidity of becs in an optical lattice and swallow - tail energy loops , we study becs in a periodic potential by using the kronig - penney ( kp ) model .",

    "we solve the bogoliubov equations using the solution of the tunneling problem of bogoliubov excitations  @xcite , and discuss the stability of condensates with supercurrents .",
    "we will show that the landau and dynamical instabilities occur when the quasimomentum of the condensate exceeds certain critical values .",
