    "patterns are ubiquitous in nature , where their presence may imply inherent predictability . as a result",
    "there is great interest in developing methods for detecting and quantifying patterns , leading to quantitative measures of structure , similarity , information content , and predictability .",
    "here we consider recurrence plots , which offer a means to quantify the pattern within a timeseries , and also the pattern shared between two timeseries .",
    "recurrence plots are a method for visualizing recurrent patterns within a timeseries or sequence .",
    "they were first proposed in 1981 by maizel and lenk @xcite as a method of visualizing patterns in sequences of genetic nucleotides .",
    "they have since been introduced into the study of dynamical systems @xcite , where much effort has been put into building quantification schemes for the plots and for the patterns within them .",
    "there are now many quantitative recurrence plot measures available @xcite .",
    "these have been applied with success to patterns as diverse as music @xcite , climate variation @xcite , heart rate variability @xcite , webpage usage @xcite , video recognition @xcite , and the patterns in written text and computer code @xcite .    in outline",
    ", a data series @xmath3 can be considered as a set of @xmath4 scalar measurements @xmath5 from which a sequence of @xmath6 @xmath7-dimensional vectors @xmath8 can be constructed using a procedure known as time - delay embedding .",
    "the vectors are defined as @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a delay parameter and @xmath7 is known as the embedding dimension , @xcite ; these parameters are typically chosen independently of the recurrence plot technique , for example see @xcite .",
    "a recurrence plot is constructed by considering whether a given pair of these coordinates are nearby in the embedding space .",
    "typically , the maximum norm is used , @xmath11 so that the distance between two coordinates equals the maximum distance in any dimension .",
    "a recurrence plot is represented by a tensor @xmath12 whose elements correspond to the distance between each of the @xmath13 possible pairs of coordinates @xmath14 , @xmath15 @xcite : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is a step function ( @xmath18 for negative arguments , @xmath19 for positive arguments ) . for each pair of coordinates in the series",
    "whose separation is less than the threshold parameter @xmath20 , @xmath21 takes the value unity , which can be plotted as a black dot on an otherwise white graph .    a recurrence plot of independent and identically distributed ( iid ) data appears as a random scattering of black dots , while a regularly repeating signal ( such as a sine wave , e.g. see fig . 1 of @xcite )",
    "appears as a series of equally spaced , @xmath22 diagonal black lines .",
    "an irregularly repeating signal ( such as the output of a chaotic system ) typically appears as a pattern of small diagonal lines of varying length .",
    "paling of the plot away from the main diagonal indicates that the longer one observes no repeat of a particular feature , the less likely a repeat is to occur . in this case",
    "it follows that probability depends on time , and therefore that the process which generated such data is non - stationary .    in this paper",
    "we investigate the statistics of recurrence plots , and their meaning in relation to well understood statistics from nonlinear timeseries analysis .",
    "first , we examine the meaning of two of the key statistics in recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) , namely the determinism and the entropy of line length distribution @xcite , and the effect on them of the time - delay embedding procedure @xcite .",
    "iwanski and bradley @xcite found that the appearance and statistics of recurrence plots for certain low - dimensional systems are not significantly altered by a small change in the embedding dimension @xmath7 , suggesting that these statistics may be important new invariant characteristics of a system .",
    "however , unlike traditional measures where invariance relies on the embedding dimension being sufficiently high , iwanski and bradley found the same statistics for an unembedded recurrence plot as for an embedded version .",
    "this was further examined by gao and cai @xcite , who suggested that many recurrence plot statistics may rely on information from a higher embedding dimension than was used to construct the recurrence plot .",
    "however this does not completely explain why these quantities appear to be invariant with respect to the embedding dimension ; nor whether these quantities are independent of each other , or of other better known measures .",
    "this is important , since independent quantities potentially yield new information about a system . in section [ sec : transf ]",
    "we show that all embedded recurrence plots are present within the unembedded plot , accessible via a simple transformation .",
    "using this transformation , we derive in section [ sec : stat ] the effect of embedding on two rqa statistics : determinism , and entropy of line length distribution . for the case of exponential scaling of the correlation sum",
    "[ see eq.([eq : recurrencerate ] ) below ] with embedding dimension , which might be expected for certain low - dimensional systems , we derive expressions which relate these quantities to the kolmogorov entropy rate @xcite .",
    "this is important for two reasons .",
    "first , it provides a new perspective on the physical meaning of these quantities .",
    "second , it can be used to establish baseline values for independent and identically distributed ( iid ) processes , above or below which a measurement can be said to be significant .    in section [ sec : mutual ] , we examine the converse question of how well - known statistics from nonlinear timeseries analyis relate to recurrence plots .",
    "we demonstrate that a standard algorithm for computing the mutual information between two timeseries is related to counting the number of black dots common to the recurrence plots of the two timeseries in question .",
    "this suggests the definition of a new form of cross recurrence plot which , when drawn , allows contributions to the mutual information to be visualized .",
    "we apply this technique to a physical system in which issues of predictability and correlation are of practical interest .",
    "geomagnetic activity is monitored by a non - uniformly distributed circumpolar ring of magnetometers , which measure fluctuations in horizontal magnetic field strength due to enhancements in auroral activity .",
    "these measurements are compiled to form the ae geomagnetic indices @xcite , of which we consider au ( a proxy for the maximum eastward flowing polar current ) and al ( a proxy for the maximum westward flowing current ) . in common with many other  real world \" timeseries ,",
    "these timeseries show both low and high dimensional behavior , in this case well defined features on timescales of days ( storms ) which are embedded in colored noise @xcite .",
    "we now derive a transformation which generates an embedded recurrence plot from an unembedded recurrence plot .",
    "this result is central to the subsequent discussion of the effect of embedding on statistics derived from recurrence plots . a single recurrence on an umbedded @xmath23 plot is represented by a single black dot , corresponding to a pair of data points closer together than @xmath20 .",
    "if we consider fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] ( left ) to represent part of a @xmath23 recurrence plot , the example illustrated relates to points numbered 2 and 8 , i.e. @xmath24 figure [ fig : lines ] ( right ) shows a line of length two . still taking @xmath23 , the situation represented is @xmath25 consider forming coordinates in a @xmath26 , @xmath27 embedding space [ see eq .",
    "( [ eq : embed ] ) ] . if we consider fig .",
    "[ fig : lines ] ( left ) to represent a region of a @xmath26 recurrence plot , the black dot now represents @xmath28 where @xmath29 now denotes @xmath30 . using the maximum norm , eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) , this is equivalent to eq .",
    "( [ eq : line2 ] ) .",
    "therefore a single dot in @xmath26 represents a line of length two in @xmath23 .",
    "the transformation from @xmath23 to @xmath26 thus reduces the length of all diagonal lines by one dot .",
    "an isolated dot is removed entirely .",
    "formally , we represent the transformation to arbitrary dimension as @xmath31 an element on the recurrence plot with embedding dimension @xmath7 is thus related to a diagonal sequence of @xmath7 elements on the unembedded recurrence plot @xmath32 .",
    "this transformation enables the conversion of an unembedded recurrence plot into any embedded recurrence plot with any values of @xmath7 or @xmath10 .",
    "this suggests that embedding in the construction of recurrence plots is not strictly necessary , since all of the information is contained within the unembedded plot @xmath32 ; let us refer to this as the parent plot . rather than performing embedding",
    ", information can be extracted directly from this parent plot .",
    "understanding how the information is contained in the parent plot assists in consideration of how various recurrence plot statistics are affected by embedding .",
    "given the transformation derived above , we now consider two of the key statistics of recurrence plots , namely the determinism and the entropy of the diagonal line length distribution .",
    "we show that both these statistics are related to the correlation sum , and also relate them to the probability distribution of line lengths on an unembedded plot . in the case of exponential scaling of the correlation sum with embedding dimension",
    ", we show that they do not depend on the embedding dimension @xmath7 .    recurrence quantification analysis ( rqa ) provides a set of statistical measures which have been proposed to quantify patterns based on the lines and dots visible on a recurrence plot @xcite .",
    "the fraction of the plot colored black is the most fundamental statistic associated with recurrence plots .",

    "( [ eq : trans1 ] ) , the distribution of line lengths on an embedded recurrence plot is related to the distribution on an unembedded plot by @xmath39 hence any statistic formed from the embedded @xmath37 can be constructed from the unembedded @xmath40 .",

    "( [ eq : lineprob ] ) , the correlation sum can be written as @xmath41 this relationship can be reversed to give @xmath42 hence any statistics derived from @xmath43 can also be derived from the correlation sum , as we now explicitly show .",
    "first we consider the determinism @xmath35 @xcite , which was observed to be invariant to embedding dimension by iwanski and bradley @xcite .",
    "this is the ratio of black dots included in lines of length greater than unity to the total number of black dots .",
    "the determinism @xmath35 quantifies the prevalence of lines , and is believed @xcite to quantify how deterministic a system is .",
    "this can be related to the probability @xmath44 of observing a black dot in a randomly selected location , and to the probability of observing an isolated black dot .",
    "the number of black dots included in lines is equal to the total number of black dots minus the number of isolated black dots ( lines of length unity ) , so we can write @xmath45 using eq .",

    "( [ eq : determinism ] ) , we have @xmath47 thus the determinism at embedding dimension @xmath7 can be inferred from knowledge of the correlation sum at nearby embedding dimensions @xmath7 , @xmath48 and @xmath49 .",

    "it is not strictly necessary to construct recurrence plots for a variety of embedding parameters , because the key statistics that we have considered are all contained within this parent plot , and many of these are directly derivable from the distribution of diagonal line lengths .",
    "this demonstrates clearly the effect of embedding on recurrence plots .",
    "a further result is that the mutual information between two timeseries can be obtained from their recurrence plots , and is related to counting the number of shared black dots .",
    "similar comparisons of unthresholded recurrence plots yield the mutual information as a function of the threshold parameter @xmath20 .",
    "this allows time - localized contributions to the mutual information to be assessed and quantified , as we have shown for the example of geomagnetic indices .",
    "comparisons between repeated patterns in signals from nonlinear systems are particularly valuable when the systems in question are spatially extended and evolve in a nonstationary fashion .",
    "macroscopic plasmas , whether naturally occuring or created in fusion experiments , often fall into this category , which presents a substantial challenge to the techniques of statistical and time series analysis ; see , for example , the discussions in recent studies of astrophysical , solar , and fusion@xcite plasma observations .",
    "the successful application of recurrence plots and the concepts of information theory to the geomagnetic plasma timeseries studied in the present paper is , therefore , encouraging .",
