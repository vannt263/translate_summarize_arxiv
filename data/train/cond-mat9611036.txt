    "<S> low - temperature dynamics of flux lines in high temperature , type ii , superconductors in the presence of correlated disorder in the form of columnar defects is discussed . </S>",
    "<S> the effect of tilting the applied magnetic field with respect to the column s directions is considered , using the non - hermitian quantum mechanics technique evaluated by hatano and nelson @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it is shown that the critical current , as well as the vortex transport properties below this current , may be determined by `` surface excitations '' , i.e. , by the roughness of the flux line near the edges of the sample , which dominated the bulk jumps . </S>",
    "<S> phase space considerations determine the critical thickness of the sample , below which the tilt induced surface transport exceeds the bulk mechanism . </S>",
    "<S> this critical length , which depend on the tilt angle as well as the directions of the perpendicular field and the suppercurrent , diverge at the delocalization transition .    </S>",
    "<S> 0.1truecm    .5pc    flux lines response functions in cuperate high - temperature superconductors have attracted considerable interest in recent years @xcite . in order to avoid dissipation of energy as a result of flux lines motion driven by the superconducting current </S>",
    "<S> , these lines should be pinned by crystal impurities @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> it turned out @xcite that the pinning is much stronger ( especially when many vortex interaction is taken into account ) when these impurities are in form of correlated disorder ( such as twin boundaries @xcite or columnar defects @xcite ) compared to the case of point disorder , resulting from vacancies of oxygen atoms @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> however , nelson and vinokur @xcite have pointed out that the correlated defects pinning become less effective in cases where the direction of the external magnetic field is tilted with respect to the defects , which we take to be along the @xmath0 direction . at some critical tilt , for which the energy per unit length of the defect is less than the energy associated with the perpendicular field , a pinning - depinning phase transition occur and the flux lines delocalized .    </S>",
    "<S> critical bulk current and vortex dynamics below this current for flux lines in the presence of columnar defects have been considered in @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the authors , using the mapping of flux lines in @xmath1 dimensional superconductor to the world lines of bosons in a @xmath2dimensional quantum system , identified the phase space diagram of the system which contain a high temperature `` superfluid '' and low - temperature `` bose glass '' phases , as well as mott insulator at the matching field , @xmath3 , for which there is one flux line per defect . at low temperature , this matching field separates the `` dilute '' region of the bose glass phase , for which the vortex lines are pinned individually by the defects , ( i.e. , @xmath4 , the abrikosov lattice constant , is much bigger than @xmath5 , the typical distance between two columnar defects ) from the high density region , for which interactions are important in determining the localization length and transport properties of the flux lines .    in the low field region , </S>",
    "<S> the vortices are localized by the interaction with the correlated defects . </S>",
    "<S> each defect is the analog of a @xmath6 potential well which we ? ? ? </S>",
    "<S> take as a cylindrical square well such as @xmath7 for @xmath8 and @xmath9 for @xmath10 . </S>",
    "<S> the temperature of the superconductor , in turn , corresponds to the plank constant @xmath11 of the quantum boson problem . for the dilute vortex arrays , where the pinning energy is larger then the interaction energy , there are two regimes . for low temperatures ( @xmath12 , @xmath13 ) </S>",
    "<S> the localization length @xmath14 is on the radius of the defect ; i.e. , of order @xmath15 ; so that each flux line is localized by @xmath16 defect . on the other hand , for @xmath17 , the localization length of one defect grows exponentially with @xmath18 , and the flux line is then localized be several defects , forming an effective @xmath5 dimensional potential well in the corresponding boson system .    </S>",
    "<S> the response of the flux line to superconducting current in the plane perpendicular to the vortex direction @xmath19 translates itself into the response of the boson system to an applied electric field . for vortices oriented in the @xmath20 direction , the lorentz force per unit length of the vortex is given by    = _ 0 c * z *    which is the analog of a boson with charge @xmath21 interacting with the electric field @xmath22 .    above the critical current @xmath23 , </S>",
    "<S> the vortices are no more localized ant there is no superconductivity ( in the sense of dissipation free current ) anymore . </S>",
    "<S> below this critical current , the mechanism for flux flow is tunneling via thermally activated `` half loops '' ( or , in the boson dynamics , tunneling into the conduction bend ) . </S>",
    "<S> for currents smaller than @xmath24 , the half loop transverse displacement exceeds the mean distance between occupied pinning sites , and for thick sample the flux lines move via the nucleation of superkinks , the analog of the mott variable range hopping ( vrh ) in doped semiconductors @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> the depinning of the flux line as a result of external field tilt has been carefully investigated by hatano and nelson @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the hemiltonian of the corresponding boson problem is no longer harmitian ; the kinetic term of the hamiltonian @xmath25 ( @xmath26 ) is subject to imaginary gauge transformation and takes the form @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is related to the perpendicular magnetic field @xmath29 via @xmath30 . as a result , there are two solutions for each localized ( real energy spectrum ) state , corresponding to the eigenstates of the hamiltonian and its complex conjugate . these solutions , termed @xmath31 and @xmath32 , correspond to the right or left `` tilting '' of the localized solution of the untilted hamiltonian , i.e. , _ </S>",
    "<S> r , l ( * r * ) = ( ) ( * r * ) . the probability distribution to find the flux line at the point * r * at a distance @xmath33 from the surface of the sample is given by @xmath34 such that , as @xmath35 , the probability distribution of the flux line at the surface is proportional to @xmath36 where @xmath37 are the left and the right ground state , respectively . </S>",
    "<S> deep in the bulk , the distribution is given by @xmath38 , i.e. , in the localized regime , the flux line changes its shape near the surface , while remains uneffected in the bulk ( see fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 ) . </S>",
    "<S> typically , the  surface roughness associated with the tilt extends into the bulk up to characteristic distance @xmath39 , which diverges as the tilting angle approaches the critical angle , for which the flux line delocalizes and the current response become linear .    in this communication , we study the the effect of the tilt on the    flux lines response to superconducting currents in the regime where the tilting angle is smaller then critical , i.e. , in the bose glass phase where the vortex lines are localized . </S>",
    "<S> we assume that the thickness of the sample is large enough , such that it is much larger than the dimension of the optimal excitation along the @xmath40 exis , moreover , we address only the dilute limit , for which the transverse ( @xmath41 ) displacement of these excitations is less than @xmath42 , so that the interaction is taken into account by filling up the localized states in order of increasing energy up to the chemical potential @xmath43 .    </S>",
    "<S> let us consider first the critical currents . </S>",
    "<S> this current is determined by the binding free energy @xmath44 as well as the localization length @xmath45 . </S>",
    "<S> modeling the defect as a square well in the boson system , @xmath46 is related to @xmath44 by @xmath47 . </S>",
    "<S> of these two , @xmath48 is changed as the magnetic field is tilted . </S>",
    "<S> near the surface of the sample , the localization length should be @xmath49 , where @xmath50 is the angle between the lorentz force @xmath51 ( perpendicular to the supercurrent @xmath52 , which we take to be in the @xmath41 plane ) and the tilting field @xmath28 . </S>",
    "<S> the absolute value is needed for the case of @xmath53 , for which the critical current is dominated by the `` tail '' of the flux line on the other end of the sample , as shown in fig . </S>",
    "<S> 1 . thus , the critical current will take the form , j_c ( t , h , ) = c u(t ) ( ( t ) - h |()| ) _ 0 . this critical current is determined by the surface ends of the vortex , for which the effect of the tilt is maximal . </S>",
    "<S> however , the `` creep '' of the vortex in the direction of the tilting field is limited by the effect of `` image vortices '' which should be introduced in order to satisfy the boundary condition on the surface @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for very small perpendicular magnetic field , where the surface roughness extension @xmath39 is less then the london length , the tilt have no effect on the vortex pinning and there is no change in the response functions of the flux system .    for currents </S>",
    "<S> less then critical , the thermally assisted flux flow ( taff ) theory of the vortex transport gives the resistivity @xmath54 as = _ </S>",
    "<S> 0 e^f /t where @xmath55 is the energy barrier for flux line jumps . </S>",
    "<S> our basic observation is that deep in the bulk there is no influence of the tilt , so that the energy barriers for nucleating half loops or double kinks are the same . the physical reason for it is that , although the perpendicular field _ decreases _ the energy barrier for one side of the kink / loop , it _ increases _ the energy needed for the other side . </S>",
    "<S> the main effect of the tilt comes from _ surface kinks / loops _ , for which the energy barrier really decreases . </S>",
    "<S> although the resulting energy barrier @xmath55 is smaller then the bulk one , so that the `` resistivity '' associated with it is exponentially smaller , one should take into account the phase space prefactor of these two mechanisms - the number of surface kinks available is determined by the surface roughness , i.e. , by @xmath39 , while the number of bulk kinks is of order @xmath56 , where @xmath57 is the distance for which the half loop / kink extends along the relevant defect . </S>",
    "<S> thus the nature of the current response is determined by the thickness of the sample - for @xmath58 , the bulk excitations will dominate and the response is tilt independent , while for @xmath59 surface excitations become important and the voltage drop will be tilt dependent . </S>",
    "<S> as @xmath60 ( where @xmath61 is the critical field above which the flux lines delocalize ) @xmath62 diverges , so that near the depinning transition the resistivity of the system goes continuesly to zero .    </S>",
    "<S> in order to estimate the relevant quantities in the tilted case , we use the expression for the free energy of the surface excitations in the presence of the tilt . </S>",
    "<S> consider now surface excitation of the flux line with line tension @xmath63 which extends for a distance @xmath64 along the pin and has perpendicular extent @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> the free energy of such jump is given by    f = _ 1 r^2 z + u_0 z - f_l rz - hr ( )    for the `` half loop '' surface excitations . </S>",
    "<S> if the jump is due to the nucleation of superkinks , one should take into account the energy difference between different rods at distance @xmath65 . </S>",
    "<S> this , in turn , is determined by the density of states at the chemical potential @xmath66 @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> and the free energy is ,    f = _ 1 r^2 z + </S>",
    "<S> z g ( ) r^2 - f_l rz - hr ( )    the resulting saddle point free energies are f^ * = ( e_k - h |()| d ) ( j_1/j )    f^ * = ( e_k - h |()| d ) ( j_0/j)^1/3 where @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , for @xmath5 the average spacing between unoccupied pins .    </S>",
    "<S> let us estimate now the phase space for such surface excitations , i.e. , the width of the region in which the roughness takes place . </S>",
    "<S> using eq . </S>",
    "<S> ( 3 ) one finds that the crossover between the surface ( @xmath70 ) and the bulk , for which @xmath71 is the same for the tilted and the untilted situation , is determined by the quantity    y ( ) = _ m < m_l| > ( -e_m /t ) where @xmath33 is the distance from the surface . </S>",
    "<S> the transition to the surface behavior takes place when @xmath72 becomes @xmath73 independent , and thus absorbed into the normalization factor for @xmath71 . </S>",
    "<S> typically , this happens when ( 10 ) is not dominated by the @xmath33 dependent exponential factor , since then the summation over @xmath74 is determined by the delocalized states , yielding an @xmath73 independent result . </S>",
    "<S> thus , for the case of half loop tunneling , the width of the surface roughness will be @xmath75 where @xmath76 . </S>",
    "<S> this gives us the estimate    ^*_loops = _ 1 t(h_c^2 - h^2 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> for the superkinks tunneling , the energy @xmath77may be given by @xmath78 , so that the energy exponent become negligible as @xmath79 , where @xcite ,    ^ * = t^3 g ( ) ( h_c - h)^2    the phase space of the surface excitations is given by the width of the surface region divided by the `` width '' of the typical excitation @xmath80 . using the above expressions for the free energy of the kinks / loops , one finds that    z^*_surface , loops ( j , h , ) = c ( - h|()| ) j _ 0 and z^*_surface , kinks ( j , h , ) = c ( e_k - h|()| ) j _ 0 d    the resulting resistivity in thick samples will be determined by adding in parallel the @xmath81 `` surface resistors '' with @xmath82 to the system of @xmath83 `` bulk resistors '' with @xmath84 . while the surface roughness does not depend on the angle between the current and the transverse magnetic field , the width of the jump , as well as the free energy barrier , do depend on it . </S>",
    "<S> it turns out that the resistivity in the `` perpendicular '' direction ( @xmath85 ) is independent of the tilt . for other directions of the superconducting current </S>",
    "<S> , there will be a crossover length @xmath62 below which the surface loops dominate the jumps . for any tilt </S>",
    "<S> less then critical , the surface roughness is finite , so that as @xmath86 bulk excitations are clearly the preferred jumping mechanism , but as @xmath60 , the width of the surface roughness become comparable with the sample thickness for each finite sample and one sees a crossover to surface excitation dominated transport . </S>",
    "<S> the critical length is related to the parameters above as    l_c(j , h , ) = ^*(z^*_bulk z^*_surface ( f^*_bulk -f^*_surface ) + 1 ) .    </S>",
    "<S> there are two reasons for the divergence of @xmath62 as @xmath60 ; one is the divergence of @xmath39 , the other is the fact that @xmath87 , yielding infinite phase space for the surface excitations . </S>",
    "<S> however , there is a limitation on the minimal width @xmath64 of the jumps ; as @xmath88 , the london length , self interaction of the flux line lock the kink / loop , so that @xmath89 sets the minimal excitation extent along the @xmath40 axis . for the region in parameter space for which @xmath90 , the critical length will grow like @xmath91for loop transport , and as @xmath92 for kinks . on the other hand , as one approach the critical tilt , the region ( h_c - h|()| ) < j c _ 0 is entered , in which the excitations width could not shrink anymore . in that case the critical length diverges like @xmath93 for loops , and as @xmath91 for kinks . </S>"
