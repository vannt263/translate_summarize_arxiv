    "the compass experiment is a fixed target experiment at cern .",
    "its physics program is focused on the investigation of the internal structure of the nucleon using muon and hadron beams .",
    "the main experimental challenge is the need to cope with high luminosity , resulting in high beam intensities and large trigger rates .",
    "the setup of the compass spectrometer is described in @xcite .",
    "charged hadron identification is obtained using a large ring imaging cherenkov detector , the compass rich-1 @xcite .",
    "the rich detector uses @xmath0 as radiator gas inside a @xmath1  m@xmath2 wide and @xmath3  meter deep vessel .",
    "the produced cherenkov photons are reflected on a @xmath4  m@xmath2 mirror wall onto two sets of photon detectors , an upper and a lower one .    until 2004 ,",
    "the photon detectors used were @xmath5 multi - wire proportional chambers ( mwpcs ) with cesium iodide ( csi ) photo - cathodes covering an active surface of about @xmath6  m@xmath2 .",
    "limitations to the rich-1 performance at high rates were related to the photon detector nature . due to the presence of csi photocathodes",
    ", the mwpcs could not be operated at high gain , thus requiring a long integration time of about @xmath7  @xmath8s of the front - end electronics , a modified version of the gassiplex chip .",
    "this limited the performance of the photon detection in the central part of the detector in two ways : in the compass experimental environment a large flux of halo muons accounts for about 10% to 20% of the total beam flux . at high beam intensities of up to @xmath9 muons per second ,",
    "the halo muons create a considerable background of cherenkov photons .",
    "these photons create an uncorrelated background on the photon detectors , which reduces the particle identification efficiency and purity , especially for particles in the very forward direction .",
    "since also the base - line restoration of the gassiplex output takes about @xmath10s , a large dead - time is created at high trigger rates .",
    "therefore a new and fast photon detection system was developed and installed between autumn 2004 and spring 2006 in order to be able to distinguish by time information between photons from physics events and background , and to be able to run at higher trigger rates of up to @xmath11  khz .",
    "the upgrade of the compass rich-1 is two - fold : in the central part of the photon detectors ( 1/4 of the surface ) , the mwpcs have been replaced by @xmath12 multi - anode photo - multipliers ( mapmts ) @xcite with new fast readout electronics , which will be discussed in this contribution . in the outer part , the existing mwpcs have been equipped with a faster readout electronics based on the apv preamplifier with sampling adcs @xcite .",
    "the mapmts used for a fast photon detection in the central part of the photon detectors are 16-channel multi - anode photomultipliers h7600 - 03-m16 from hamamatsu @xcite . the readout system @xcite for the mapmts is based on the mad4 preamplifier - discriminator @xcite and the dead - time free f1-tdc characterized by a very good time resolution @xcite .",
    "the electronics system is mounted in a very compact setup as close as possible to the photomultipliers ( fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "this minimizes the electrical noise and takes into account the limited space in front of the rich detector .",
    "the analogue front - end board amplifies the signal from the photomultiplier , discriminates it and sends it as a differential signal to the digital board .",
    "each front - end card is equipped with @xmath13 mad4 chips with @xmath14 channels each .",
    "the mad4 chip features a charge - sensitive preamplifier with fixed gain ( @xmath15",
    "mv / fc ) , a shaper and a discriminator with digitally adjustable threshold . to match the amplitude of the mapmt signal to the input stage of the mad4 chip , a resistive voltage divider attenuates the signal by a factor of @xmath16 .",
    "the binning of the threshold setting was chosen to be @xmath7  fc / digit .",
    "the measured noise level is @xmath17  fc ( fig . [ threshold ] ) , while typical mapmt signals have amplitudes between @xmath11 and @xmath18  fc ( fig .",
    "[ signal ] ) @xcite .",
    "the signal peak at lower amplitudes originates from photoelectrons which are missing one amplification stage in the mapmt .",
    "since the signal fraction of this peak is significant , a threshold setting below this peak is essential for achieving high efficiency . a typical threshold setting of about @xmath19  fc is chosen .",
    "for this threshold , the excellent signal - to - noise ratio allows to obtain a very high efficiency , preserving a negligible level of cross - talk ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "the mad4 chip can operate at input rates up to @xmath20  mhz per channel .",
    "an upgraded version of the mad4 chip is under development , capable of input rates up to @xmath21  mhz , the cmad .",
    "mapmts.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    v operating voltage , measured with an adc.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]",
    "the digital part of the new rich-1 frontend electronics consists of the dreisam front - end board , which is equipped with eight f1-tdc chips to read out four mapmts ( fig .",
    "[ dreisam ] ) .",
    "the board was designed in a very compact way .",
    "the data are digitized on the dreisam board and are sent out via optical links to the hot - cmc board , a small mezzanine card on the catch , the common readout - driver board of the compass experiment .",
    "the f1 chips on the digital boards have a digitization bin - width of @xmath22  ps and can operate at input data rates of up to @xmath23  mhz per channel .",
    "the readout of the data can be performed at trigger rates up to @xmath11  khz .",
    "the time resolution of the complete system consisting of mapmt , mad4 board and dreisam board has been determined by illuminating the mapmt photocathode with optical pulses of width less than @xmath24  ps from a pulsed laser system .",
    "the laser intensity was attenuated by optical filters to obtain single photon signals on the mapmt .",
    "the time resolution of the complete system was determined to be @xmath25  ps .",
    "the upgraded photon detection system of the compass rich-1 has been stably operated during the beam - time in 2006 and 2007 . in fig . [ time ]",
    "the time spectrum of the detected cherenkov photons is shown .",
    "the central peak of the physics signal has a standard deviation of about @xmath20  ns . the background below the peak is created by uncorrelated cherenkov photons mainly from muon - beam halo particles .",
    "the observed width of the central peak is determined by the different geometrical path length of the photons in a cherenkov ring traveling from the mirrors to the photon detection system .",
    "this has been confirmed by a monte carlo simulation of the detector setup . by applying a suitable offline time - cut of @xmath26  ns around the signal peak , an excellent background suppression is achieved .",
    "cherenkov rings from a physics event are shown in fig .",
    "[ rings ] .",
    "a fast front - end electronics for the read - out of the mapmts of the compass rich-1 was designed and successfully installed in 2006 . the new electronics has an excellent time resolution for cherenkov photons of less than @xmath20  ns and thus allows a very good background suppression of photons originating from halo muons .",
    "its high hit capability allows a dead - time free data taking at trigger rates of up to @xmath11  khz . the upgraded detector and the new electronics entirely fulfill the expected performances and have been operated successfully since the data taking period in 2006 .",
    "with the upgraded detector , the number of detected cherenkov photons for saturated rings has increased from @xmath27 before to @xmath28 after the upgrade .",
    "the resolution of the cherenkov angle has improved from @xmath29 to @xmath30  mrad @xcite .",
