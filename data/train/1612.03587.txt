    "recent experimental studies ( scanning tunneling microscopy , stm  @xcite , raman spectroscopy  @xcite , angular resolved photoemission spectroscopy  @xcite ) revealed that , in many cases , the structure of bilayer graphene samples is far from the ideal ab stacking . instead , it is characterized by a non - zero twist angle @xmath0 between graphene layers .",
    "the electronic structure of twisted bilayer graphene ( tblg ) is very rich , demonstrating a dirac spectrum with a @xmath0-dependent fermi velocity  @xcite , low - energy van hove singularities  @xcite , complex fermi surface  @xcite , and other peculiar features  @xcite .",
    "an important characteristic of its electronic structure is the single - electron gap . for twisted bilayer samples ,",
    "the existence of the gap was demonstrated in several experiments  @xcite .",
    "this paper theoretically studies the gap ( previous efforts on this issue are discussed in the recent review paper in ref .  ) .",
    "if one is interested in the theoretical description of the tblg , a useful starting point is to consider ` commensurate ' values of @xmath0 for which the tblg lattice forms commensurate superstructures .",
    "when the size of the supercell is not too large , the electronic properties can be studied numerically  @xcite . besides computational approaches ,",
    "several semi - analytic theories for low - energy electrons were developed  @xcite .",
    "studying the commensurate angles , it is possible to calculate , for example , the dependence on @xmath0 of the fermi velocity  @xcite @xmath1 and the density of states  @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , these approaches can not be directly applied for the calculation of the gap .",
    "it was demonstrated in ref .   that the gap @xmath2 evaluated at the commensurate angles is not a smooth function of @xmath0 .",
    "instead , it varies exponentially even for small changes of the twist angle .",
    "clearly , such a large sensitivity implies that considering the commensurate angles is not sufficient for a consistent theory of how the gap is generated .    a possible way to remedy this situation",
    "was proposed in ref .  .",
    "it was pointed out that the sharp jumps of @xmath2 were associated with the fact that the size of the supercell may change drastically for very small variations of @xmath0 .",
    "therefore , the extreme sensitivity of @xmath2 to the twist angle is possible only in a perfect infinite lattice of tblg , where a superstructure with arbitrary large supercell can exist .",
    "of course , any real sample has a finite linear size @xmath3 .",
    "furthermore , a realistic electron propagation is characterized by a finite mean free path @xmath4 due to electron scattering on defects , such as impurities , `` wrinkles '' ( as an example , below we will evaluate @xmath4 for a particular case of a disordered ensemble of one - dimensional `` wrinkles '' ) , etc .",
    "the smallest among the length scales @xmath3 and @xmath4 would introduce a `` cutoff '' , which disallows the superstructures with large supercells , and makes the jumps of @xmath2 impossible  @xcite .",
    "the latter reasoning motivates us to investigate the formation of the gap in a tblg sample of finite size . for tblg clusters of various twist angles and linear sizes ,",
    "we numerically determine the matrix elements , which couple different dirac cones . by construction ,",
    "the calculated matrix elements are smooth functions of @xmath0 .",
    "since these matrix elements are small in comparison to the graphene band - width , many publications often dismiss them . yet , they are important at low energies , causing qualitative changes to the electron spectrum : in the ideal infinite tblg lattice they either open the gap , or induce a so - called `` band splitting '' . in a finite - size sample , or in a sample with finite quasiparticle scattering ,",
    "these cone - coupling matrix elements require a subtler interpretation : a gap can not be observed , unless the corresponding matrix element exceeds both the dimensional quantization gap , and quasiparticle scattering frequency . we will demonstrate that this condition is satisfied only when @xmath0 is close to a commensurate angle with small supercell size . as the detuning from the `` good '' angle increases , the gap - generating matrix elements quickly ( exponentially ) decay , and the gap is washed away by the external scattering .",

    ", the tblg has another characteristic length scale .",
    "the rotation of one graphene layer with respect to another leads to the appearance of moir patterns , manifesting in stm experiments  @xcite as alternating bright and dark regions .",
    "the moir period @xmath71 is defined as the distance between the centers of two neighboring bright ( or dark ) regions .",

    "the supercells of these structures contain @xmath73 ( if @xmath39 ) or @xmath74 ( if @xmath40 ) moir cells , and the arrangements of atoms inside these moir cells are slightly different from each other .",
    "this means , in particular , that the structures with @xmath75 can be considered as almost periodic repetitions  @xcite of structures with @xmath34 .",
    "the moir pattern and the superstructure are two complementary concepts used to describe the tblg .",
    "the moir pattern depends smoothly on the twist angle , as demonstrated by eq .",
    "( [ moirep ] ) , and can be easily detected experimentally .",
    "however , working with the moir theoretically may be challenging since the moir structure is strictly periodic for a very limited discrete set of angles . for a generic value of @xmath0 , different moir cells in the pattern may look alike , but they are not exactly identical .",
    "the superstructure , which is a periodic lattice of supercells , does not suffer from this shortcoming .",
    "unfortunately , it has its own deficiencies .",
    "namely , the superstructure is defined for commensurate angles @xmath0 only .",

    "are insensitive to sharp variations of @xmath70 versus @xmath0 , others ( for example , the gap ) are not  @xcite .",
    "consequently , fermi velocity calculations at commensurate angles are sufficient for adequate theoretical description ; yet , the situation with the gap is more delicate , as we will show below .",
    "the opening of the gap can be heuristically deduced from the discussion of sec .",
    "[ sect::geometry ] .",
    "indeed , the low - energy dispersion of the tblg is characterized by four dirac points , two from each layer . at commensurate angles",
    "the four points can be grouped into two equivalence classes , see eq .",
    "( [ eq::class1 ] ) and  ( [ eq::class2 ] ) . in other words , while in the original reciprocal space of two sheets of the single - layer graphene all four dirac points have different coordinates , after folding to the first brillouin zone of the superlattice the equivalent dirac points end up in identical locations .",
    "the electron states near equivalent points may be connected by non - zero matrix elements of the interlayer tunneling operator @xmath78 : in the presence of the superlattice such matrix elements are consistent with the quasimomentum conservation law . although the absolute values of these matrix elements are small , the kinetic energy of electrons near the dirac points is small as well . as a result ,",
    "the interlayer tunneling qualitatively affects the low - energy spectrum .    to formalize this reasoning ,",
    "a low - energy effective model is very useful . in the case of commensurate structures ,",
