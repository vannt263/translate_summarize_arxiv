    "so far , a number of numerical methods to solve faddeev three - body equations for energies above three - body breakup threshold have been developed and then applied to a system of nucleon - deuteron , which is considered as one of the most basic quantum three - body systems @xcite .",
    "these methods are classified into two groups : either to solve coupled integral equations for scattering amplitudes in momentum space or to solve coupled partial differential equations for wave functions in coordinate space .    in this paper",
    ", we will present a different approach for three - body scattering problem above the breakup threshold energy , in which we solve the faddeev integral equations for wave functions in coordinate space .",
    "this approach has been successfully applied to calculations of the three - nucleon bound states @xcite and low - energy three - nucleon scattering below the breakup threshold energy with inclusion of three - nucleon forces @xcite and the long - range coulomb interaction @xcite .",
    "integral equations for scattering problems are generally written in the form of inhomogeneous linear equations . in the previous works",
    ", we applied an iterative method called the method of continued fraction ( mcf ) to solve such equations , whose details are given in refs . @xcite and references therein .",
    "a basic procedure of the algorithm in the mcf is to operate the integral kernel to a function made in a preceding step , as are those in most iterative methods .",
    "it is thus essential to establish precise operations of integral kernels for solving the equations accurately , which is main subject of this paper .",
    "the existence of three - body breakup channels causes some difficulties in three - body calculations . in the momentum space approach , for example",
    ", the effects appear as logarithmic singularities and discontinuities by a step function in the integral kernels of the equations so that we need to perform the integration very carefully @xcite . in the differential equation approach , due to the breakup effects one needs to set boundary conditions at very long distance , the order of tens or hundreds times larger than the range of interaction potentials @xcite .",
    "since we treat the wave functions as solutions of the faddeev integral equations , the long - range behavior should appear in the integral kernel . in the present paper",
    ", we will describe how this behavior appears in our kernel , and how to treat it .",
    "basic notations and steps of the kernel operation in detail are explained in sec .",

    "we have presented a method to operate the faddeev integral kernel in coordinate space at energies where three - body breakup reactions take place .",

    "results for three - nucleon systems with realistic nucleon - nucleon interactions and three - nucleon interactions will be presented elsewhere .    since the integral kernel and hence the wave function in our formalism can be written as the sum of the elastic , three - body breakup , and closed channels , effects of each reaction mechanism can be easily drawn .",
