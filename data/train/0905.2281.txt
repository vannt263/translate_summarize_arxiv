    "it is known that the ordinary matter and fields of the standard model are not sufficient to accommodate the present phase of acceleration ( preceede by deceleration ) .",
    "consequently a modification of matter sector of the einstein gravity is essential to incorporate the recent prediction from observational cosmology .",
    "the notion of new type of matter has come up which must have negative pressure .",
    "recent astronomical data when interpreted in the context of big bang model have provided some interesting information about the composition of the universe .",
    "the analysis reveals that our universe is spatially flat and consists of 70 percent dark energy with negative pressure , remaining 30 percent dust matter ( cold dark matter plus baryons ) , and negligible radiation .",
    "it has been predicted that the dark energy may be responsible for the present acceleration of our universe .",
    "the most simple candidate for these uniformly distributed ( i.e unclustered ) dark energy is considered to be in the form of vacuum energy density or cosmological constant ( @xmath7 ) . the model with cosmological constant",
    "is entangled with ( i ) fine tuning problem ( present amount of the dark energy is so small compared with fundamental scale ) and ( ii ) coincidence problem ( dark energy density is comparable with critical density today ) .",
    "alternatively the other choices are ( i ) a light homogeneous scalar field @xmath8 , whose effective potential @xmath9 leads to an accelerated phase at a later stage of the universe ( caldwell _ et al .",

    "chaplygin gas was first introduced in aerodynamics in 1904 .",
    "recently it has been shown that chaplygin gas may be useful for describing dark energy because of its negative pressure .",
    "although it has positive energy density it carries a negative pressure for which it is referred to as exotic fluid . in the context of string theory",
    "the chaplygin gas emerges from the dynamics of a generalized d - brane in a ( d+1,1 ) spacetime .",
    "it can be described by a complex scalar field which is obtained from a generalized born - infeld action .",
    "the equation of state is given by @xmath12 where @xmath2 is a positive constant , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are pressure and density respectively .",
    "subsequently a modified form of the equation of state ( bento _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ; bilic , tupper 2001 ) of the form @xmath15 with @xmath16 which is known as generalized chaplygin gas ( gcg ) .",
    "it has two free parameter @xmath2 ( positive ) , @xmath3 . in gcg model , at low energy density , the fluid pressure is negative and constant while at high energy density it behaves almost like pressure less fluid .",
    "thus it smoothly interpolates between a non - relativistic matter phase in the past and a negative pressure dark energy regime at late times .",
    "recently a modified form of gcg has been considered in cosmology ( liu and li 2005 ) .",
    "the modified chaplygin gas ( mcg ) is more general and contains three free parameters .",
    "the idea is to interpolate states of standard fluids at high pressures and at high energy densities to a constant negative pressure at low energy densities ( debnath _ et al .",
    "in addition it covers whole aspects of gcg .",
    "this model accommodates consistent ( i ) gravitational lensing test ( silva _ et al .",
    "_ 2003 ; dev _ et al .",
    "_ 2004 ) , ( ii ) gamma - ray bursts ( bertolami and silva 2006 ) .",
    "the equation of state for this modified chaplygin gas is given by @xmath17 where @xmath2 , @xmath1 , @xmath3 are arbitrary constants with @xmath18 .",
    "as there are three free parameters , unlike gcg , we look for a suitable range of b parameter for mcg for a viable cosmological model accommodating the observational evidences .",
    "the parameters are determined by ( i ) considering a dimensionless age parameter @xmath4 ( dev _ et al .",
    "_ 2002 ) and ( ii ) @xmath5 data analysis ( wu and yu 2006 ) .",
    "we perform the following analysis :    case 1 .",
    "the age parameter ( @xmath4 ) is dimensionless and a constant irrespective of the model we are considering . for simplicity we chose its standard value to be 0.95 ( ignoring error ) . imposing this constant age parameter we determine the effective ranges of values of the free parameters in this model .",
    "as the parameters have some preferred range of values , one can ultimately constrain one of them , in particular the matter part b.    case 2 . using ( @xmath5 ) data",
    "we further verify the validity of the constraints on the parameters obtained in case 1 .",
    "we use hubble parameter vs redshift relation given in table 1 .",
