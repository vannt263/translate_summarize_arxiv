    "in the breakthrough experiment reported by k. tanaka et al .",
    "@xcite , the matter radius of the carbon isotope @xmath0c was extracted via a finite - range glauber analysis under an optical - limit approximation of the reaction cross section , for @xmath0c on a liquid hydrogen target , measured around 40 mev / nucleon .",
    "the extracted matter radius presents a huge value of 5.4@xmath50.9  fm ( for a viewpoint on @xcite , see also ref .",
    "@xcite . ) , which characterizes this nucleus as the heaviest halo nuclei discovered until now .",
    "for the two - neutron separation energy , @xmath6 , they also quote a value of 0.42@xmath50.94  mev .",
    "these experimental results , together with other well - known properties of carbon isotopes  @xcite , indicate that @xmath0c is weakly - bound , having a very large two - neutron halo with the @xmath3c as a core , such that the corresponding observables are probably dominated by the tail of the three - body wave function in an ideal @xmath4-wave three - body model , as considered in ref .  @xcite .",
    "in addition , within a @xmath7c configuration , we have the @xmath0c as a borromean halo system , considering that a neutron ( @xmath8 ) and @xmath3c is known as an unbound system .    in view of its very low - energy properties , within the @xmath9core halo - nuclei systems , the nucleus",
    "@xmath3c has been cited previously  @xcite as a good candidate to present three - body efimov states  @xcite . considering that this nucleus is more compact than the @xmath0c , with its ground state in a probable @xmath10 configuration , it is also quite natural to suggest the @xmath0c as being still more favorable to have an efimov state  @xcite , with its halo predominantly produced by a @xmath11 component .",
    "however , to infer about the possibility of existence of efimov excited states in an ideal @xmath4-wave two - neutron halo nucleus like @xmath0c  @xcite is crucial to have a measurement of the virtual state energy of @xmath1c .",
    "the characteristics of @xmath0c , roughly described in the first and second paragraphs , allow us to use a dirac@xmath12 ( zero - range ) interaction , as reviewed in refs .",
    "@xcite , acting on @xmath4-wave to study this problem . in the zero - range limit",
    "three scales emerge for describing the full long - range structure of the @xmath7c wave function : the virtual @xmath13 energy , the @xmath4-wave virtual state energy of the neutron in @xmath1c and the two - neutron separation @xmath6 .",
    "the information on the unbound @xmath14c virtual energy is unknown and @xmath6 has an uncertainty that is about twice its own value .    in this study , we calculate a region to guide the experiments to search for the @xmath0c two - neutron separation energy . by first considering that the virtual state energy of @xmath1c is varying from 0 to 100 kev , and that the bound - state energy of @xmath0c is given in an interval from 100 to 1500 kev",
    ", we calculate the mean - square distance of the halo neutron to the center - of - mass ( cm ) of the corresponding three - body system as a function of @xmath6 .",
    "then , by using the extracted one - nucleon mean - distance @xmath15 and its uncertainties as constraints , we are able to estimate a reasonable region for the search of the two - neutron separation energy in @xmath0c , as well as the corresponding region of the virtual state energy of @xmath1c ( directly related to a negative scattering length of the @xmath14c system ) .",
    "the three - body halo wave function allows us to calculate the neutron mean - square distance to the corresponding three - body cm .",
    "this model has already been applied with success to describe halo radii in ref .  @xcite and two - neutron correlation functions in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "the available quantity that can be used to define limits on the two - neutron halo @xmath0c binding is the extracted matter radius , @xmath17 fm , that was recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite . the root - mean - square distance , from the cm of the @xmath7c to one of its halo neutrons , can be estimated by using the additional information on the matter radius of the loosely bound @xmath3c , which is given in ref .",
    "@xcite ( @xmath180.05  fm ) . in view of the large difference between the radius of @xmath0c and @xmath3c , we consider it is a reasonable approximation to assume @xmath3c as the core for the present purpose , such that we still can use a three - body approach .",
    "the result of our estimation is given by the following : @xmath19}\\approx 15\\pm 4\\ ; { \\rm fm } \\ , \\label{rn}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath20 and @xmath21 , with @xmath22 .",
    "this simple approximation shows that @xmath0c is the largest known halo along the neutron dripline . by using this value",
    ", we will be able to define a region where the @xmath1c virtual energy can be found , as well as the corresponding two - neutron separation energy , @xmath6 , in @xmath0c .      in the following ,",
    "the faddeev formalism is developed by considering a renormalized zero - range three - body model for a system with a core ( @xmath23 ) , which will be the @xmath24 in the present work , and two - identical particles ( the neutrons ) .",
    "the mass of the core is given by @xmath25 , where @xmath26 defines the mass ratio and @xmath27 is the neutron mass . throughout this article",
    ", we will use units such that @xmath28 . in the renormalization procedure ,",
    "the kernel regularization is done via a subtraction method also considered in @xcite .",
    "after partial wave projection , the @xmath4-wave coupled subtracted integral equations , for two neutrons and a core , can be written in momentum space by a coupled equations for the spectator functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 , as follows : @xmath31 , \\label{chi2}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath32^{-1 } ,   \\label{tau1 } \\\\",

    "the indexes @xmath8 or @xmath23 in @xmath33 indicates the spectator particle .",
    "the momentum and energy variables are written in terms of a momentum three - body scale @xmath34 , which is used in our subtractive regularization procedure to renormalize the originally singular faddeev equations .",
    "the units considered in eqs .",
    "( [ chi1]-[g2 ] ) are such that all quantities are dimensionless . in view of that , the corresponding dimensionless energies for the three - body system are given by @xmath35 @xmath36 @xmath37 , where @xmath38 kev and @xmath39 are , respectively , the @xmath13 and the @xmath14c virtual - state energies .",
    "the mean - square distance of the neutron to the cm of the three - body system is calculated from the derivative of the fourier transform of the respective matter density with respect to the square of the momentum transfer .",
    "the fourier transform of the one - body densities defines the respective form factor , @xmath40 , as a function of the dimensionless momentum transfer @xmath41 .",
    "thus , for the mean - square distance of the neutron to the cm of @xmath0c , we have  @xcite @xmath42 where the form factor is defined as : @xmath43    the above three - body wave function , @xmath44 , in momentum space are given in terms of the spectator functions @xmath33 as : @xmath45,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath46 is the relative momentum of the pair and @xmath47 is the relative momentum of the spectator particle to the pair .",
    "the calculation of the neutron average distance to the cm of @xmath0c demands as input the @xmath6 , the energies of the virtual @xmath4-wave states of the @xmath13 and @xmath1c systems . the unbound @xmath1c virtual state is poorly known . in our model",
    "we assumed small values of this virtual state between 0 - 100 kev .",
    "the one - neutron mean distance to the cm , @xmath48 , derived from eqs .",
    "( [ ra ] ) and ( [ f3 ] ) and using the wave function ( [ psi ] ) can be written as a general function @xmath49 , dependent on the two - body energies , as : @xmath50 where the plus sign ( minus ) refers to bound ( virtual ) two - body subsystem .",
    "the value of the separation energy is given by @xmath51 .",
    "to convert all results of the calculations to the physical units we have to introduce the physical value of @xmath6 in ( [ rscal ] ) . in this case the value of the parameters @xmath52 and @xmath53 are determined as : @xmath54 from ( [ rscal ] ) and ( [ e2 ] ) , the average distance from the neutron to the cm of the system is given by @xmath55 the limit cycle  @xcite is achieved when @xmath52 and @xmath53 tends to zero and it is used to compute the radius of the shallowest @xmath56 bound state .",
    "therefore , in this limit , the dependence on @xmath57 can be dropped out : @xmath58 in practice such limit is achieved fast and the first cycle is enough for the application we are considering ( see ref .",
    "@xcite ) .    from experimental data , we have @xmath59  fm , as given by eq .",
    "( [ rn ] ) , and the singlet @xmath13 virtual state energy @xmath38  kev .",
    "therefore , in order to use the model results from ( [ rscal2 ] ) , we have to assume values for the unknown virtual state energy of @xmath1c , to be able to get some information on @xmath6 in @xmath60 . in fig.[c22fig ] , we display our results for the separation energy for different values of the @xmath4-wave neutron virtual state in @xmath61 , ranging from 0 up to 100 kev .",
    "the experimental values of @xmath62  mev @xcite and @xmath63  fm are shown in the figure .",
    "we observe that , for a given @xmath6 , the @xmath15 decreases as the absolute value of the virtual state energy increases .",
    "this can be explained as follows : as the virtual state energy increases , the interaction between the neutron and the core becomes weaker .",
    "therefore , one can fix a given three - body energy by decreasing the size of the system  @xcite . by taking into account the value of @xmath64  fm , one obtains @xmath6 below @xmath20.4 mev for a neutron in @xmath1c bound at the threshold .",
    "this result is not far from the central experimental value of 0.42  mev .",
    "we note that a small increase in the virtual state energy up to 20  kev , drops the upper limit of @xmath6 to @xmath20.3  mev .",
    "indeed , the finite - range glauber analysis under an optical - limit approximation of the reaction cross section , for @xmath0c on a liquid hydrogen target , measured around 40 mev / nucleon  @xcite , indicates that the observed large enhancement of the cross - section compared to the neighbor carbon isotopes , suggests that values of @xmath6 below 0.4  mev would be possible .    the three - body approximation that we have considered for @xmath0c , where the @xmath3c is the core ,",
    "can be justified by comparing the size of @xmath3c with the mean distance of the halo neutrons of @xmath0c and also considering that the halo neutrons in @xmath3c are bound with about 3.5 mev , one order of magnitude greater than @xmath6 in @xmath0c .",
    "thus , the halo neutrons in @xmath0c have a much larger probability to experience the long - range @xmath65 potential derived by efimov than in @xmath3c , as the corresponding wave function tail is extending far beyond the size of @xmath3c .",
    "therefore , the efimov physics should be much more evident in the properties of @xmath0c ground state than in the corresponding properties of @xmath3c .    in a microscopic 5-body description , beyond the present model ,",
    "the four neutrons out of @xmath66c , should be in a fully antisymmetric wave function due to the proposed separation of scales . as the @xmath4-wave radial wave functions corresponding to the neutrons in the halo of @xmath3c and in @xmath0c have different sizes , an antisymmetric wave function can be built .",
    "if all spectator neutron interactions are dominated by only @xmath4-waves , as in our model , the pauli exclusion principle would make the halo neutrons in @xmath0c much less bound than in @xmath3c , which indeed seems to be the case .",
    "in essence , with the above remarks , we should emphasize that our three - body model for @xmath0c is not excluding a three - body model for @xmath3c as having a two - neutron halo or an efimov state for @xmath3c very near the scattering threshold  @xcite .",
    "one possible correction to our results is due to the interaction range .",
    "range corrections in the calculation of different mean distances were performed by canham and hammer  @xcite . by taking the @xmath67li ( borromean @xmath68li system ) for comparison , where @xmath69 300 kev and the neutron average distance to the cm is around 6 fm ,",
    "the correction is a fraction of 1 fm  @xcite for a fixed @xmath6 , @xmath70li virtual state energy and @xmath71 scattering length .",
    "therefore , we also expect corrections of the same magnitude , or even smaller , considering that the core is larger but the average distance of the neutron to the cm is more than twice .",
    "we should stress that effects from the detailed core dynamics in our calculation are implicitly carried out by the three - body energy , which in our framework is an external parameter .",
    "summarizing , from the extracted matter radius of @xmath0c , by using a renormalized three - body zero - range model , we estimate the mean - square distance of a halo neutron with respect to the cm of the @xmath0c . from such estimate , we suggest a possible region for an experimental search of both @xmath6 of @xmath0c and the @xmath14c virtual state energy .",
    "the @xmath0c is approximated by a borromean three - body system composed by a point - like core of @xmath3c and two @xmath4-wave halo neutrons .",
    "the validity of our findings relates to the assumption of a large halo compared to the typical range of the nuclear interaction .",
    "we are confident that the guidance provided by this work would help the search for the @xmath0c energy from an experimental analysis .",
    "finally , based on fig . 1 of ref .",
    "@xcite , where it is calculated a region for the appearance of excited efimov states , we would like to mention that a @xmath1c with an energy close to zero can make the @xmath0c as the most promising borromean candidate to present excited efimov states , or a continuum resonance  @xcite .",
    "our thanks to the brazilian agencies fapesp and cnpq for partial financial support .",
    "we also would like to thank prof .",
