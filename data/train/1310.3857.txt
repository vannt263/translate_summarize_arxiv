    "within a model with @xmath3 invariance , the allowed parameter space for @xmath6 appearance oscillations must be contained within the parameter space allowed for @xmath1 disappearance , as can be seen from the following chain of reasoning :    1 .",
    "@xmath3 invariance requires that @xmath4 oscillations and @xmath7 oscillations must be identical .",
    "2 .   the probability for @xmath8 disappearance must be larger than the probability for @xmath7 oscillations .",
    "@xmath3 invariance requires that the probability of @xmath1 disappearance be the same as the probability for @xmath8 disappearance .",
    "thus , if the sensitive region of a @xmath9 disappearance experiment entirely covers the parameter space for a @xmath10 signal region , then either a signal must be observed with mixing angle such that @xmath11 , or all models based on oscillations that assume @xmath3 invariance must be ruled out as an explanation for the @xmath10 appearance signal .",
    "we will use this argument to show how the juno ( jiangmen underground neutrino observatory ) and kamland detectors can be used to address existing short - baseline @xmath12 appearance signals .     vs. @xmath13 boundaries where the null oscillation hypothesis can be excluded at 5@xmath5 with isodar@kamland and isodar@juno experiments",

    "finally , the purple region corresponds to the @xmath2 vs. @xmath14 allowed region at 99% cl from a combined fit to all @xmath9 appearance data@xcite .",
    "[ juno_sense ] , title=\"fig : \" ]    the world s data on @xmath4 appearance from short - baseline experiments can be combined to yield a `` global @xmath1 appearance '' allowed region , using the code from ref .",
    "three experiments contribute .",
    "the lsnd experiment observed a @xmath15 excess of @xmath1 in a @xmath16 beam that can be interpreted as @xmath10 signal at the mass splitting of @xmath17 ev@xmath18 @xcite .",
    "the complementary karmen experiment failed to observe @xmath10 oscillations @xcite , and this represents an important constraint .",
    "these studies were followed by the miniboone experiment , which employed both @xmath19 and @xmath16 beams . for this discussion , we consider only the antineutrino running , which can be directly compared to karmen and lsnd with no assumptions concerning @xmath20 violation .",
    "miniboone observed an excess of @xmath1 events @xcite .",
    "[ juno_sense ] shows the 99% confidence level ( cl ) allowed region for appearance from a joint fit to the data sets ( purple ) , where @xmath2 is plotted versus @xmath21 .    also relevant to this discussion",

    "[ juno_sense ] shows the 99% allowed region for this disappearance in terms of @xmath2 versus @xmath23 from ref .",
    "this is called the `` reactor anomaly . ''",
    "these two results are inconsistent with a three - neutrino model @xcite , but can be explained if one or more noninteracting ( `` sterile '' ) neutrinos are introduced .",
    "other data which are included in the sterile neutrino global fits include low - level signals for @xmath8 appearance from sources @xcite , constraints in @xmath8 oscillations from comparisons of karmen and lsnd cross - section measurements @xcite , and a large number of null signals from @xmath19 oscillation experiments @xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 versus @xmath23 allowed region at 99% cl for the @xmath24 disappearance parameters from a combined fit to all oscillation data is indicated by the dark gray region @xcite , which we will call the `` global fit '' 99% cl allowed region .",
    "the isodar@kamland experiment @xcite is proposed to decisively address the global fit .",
    "this experiment pairs the isodar source with the kamland detector .",
    "isodar makes use of the same cyclotron design as the injector cyclotron for dae@xmath25alus to accelerate protons to 60 mev / n .",
    "the protons impinge on a beryllium target that produces copious neutrons .",
    "the target is surrounded by a 99.99% isotopically pure @xmath26li sleeve , where neutron capture results in @xmath0li production .",
    "the @xmath0li isotopes then undergo @xmath27 decay at rest to produce an isotropic @xmath1 flux with an average energy of @xmath286.5 mev and an endpoint of @xmath2813 mev .    in a liquid scintillator detector ,",
    "events are observed through inverse beta decay ( ibd ) , @xmath29 , which is easily tagged through positron ( prompt - light ) neutron - capture coincidence .",
    "the energy of the neutrino can be reconstructed from the visible energy of the positron : @xmath30 .",
    "for kamland , the energy resolution of @xmath31 is assumed in the sensitivity calculations @xcite .",
    "the position can be reconstructed using the timing of arrival of the scintillation light at the photomultiplier tubes ( pmts ) .",
    "thus , this interaction allows for accurate reconstruction of @xmath32 . the vertex resolution for kamland",
    "is assumed to be @xmath33 @xcite ; however , the resolution is small compared to the variation of the extent of the neutrino source , which leads to an uncertainty in the neutrino flight path of 40 cm .",
    "the analysis to obtain the oscillation sensitivity follows the method of ref .",
    "@xcite assuming a 5% normalization uncertainty and a 90% detection efficiency .",
    "since l and e can be precisely measured , this analysis exploits the l / e dependence of the possible oscillation probability , @xmath34 $ ] , to estimate the @xmath35 regions where the null oscillation hypothesis can be excluded at the 5@xmath5 confidence level .    in less than one year of running this experiment , using the 1 kton kamland liquid scintillator detector ,",

    "( the higher @xmath2 region is not accessible unless isodar normalization , which is presently assumed to be 5% @xcite , can be greatly improved . )",
    "this experiment also makes strong statements concerning the sterile neutrino model for the global fit ( dark gray region ) .",
    "if no signal is observed , then the sterile neutrino model for this region is decisively ruled out .",
    "the value of running for five years or more , if an oscillation signal is observed , is that the l / e pattern can be mapped out to determine the number of sterile neutrinos involved in the oscillation @xcite .",

    "1 , after five years of running , the region with @xmath39 will be explored .",
    "thus this experiment can be used to explore a series of hypotheses .",
    "if a signal is observed , then the result may lie in the global fit allowed region , consistent with all of the allowed anomalies interpreted within a sterile neutrino model .",
    "alternatively , the signal may be inconsistent with the global fit hypotheses , but lie within the global @xmath1 appearance allowed region , indicating that the reactor anomaly is not due to oscillations , but that the lsnd and miniboone signals do arise from oscillations .",

    "the design of juno remains under discussion .",
    "for this analysis , we used the following parameters .",
    "the active target consists of an acrylic sphere of 34.5 m in diameter .",
    "the resulting fiducial volume is 20 ktons .",
    "the pmts are located at a diameter of 37.5 m. beyond this is a 1.5 m veto region .",
    "this is assumed to be surrounded by rock .",
    "the depth is expected to be similar to that of kamland , @xmath43 m.w.e .",
    "the juno detector is being carefully designed to achieve excellent energy resolution of @xmath44 .",
    "we assume that the vertex resolution is the same as for kamland .",
    "the source requires substantial iron and concrete shielding to contain the neutrons that escape the @xmath26li sleeve , which limits the proximity of isodar to any large detector . for these studies , we assume a five - year run with an isodar cyclotron source that accelerates deuterons .",
    "the deuteron option gives an enhanced rate ( @xmath45 ) of antineutrino production as compared to the proton option described in ref .",
    "@xcite and also has a smaller size . for this analysis",
    ", we assume that the center of the source is located 5.0 m from the edge of the active region of juno .",
    "this leads to @xmath46 ibd events reconstructed in the juno detector , assuming no oscillation .",
    "[ juno_sense ] shows the sensitivity curve for isodar@juno ( blue line ) , which completely covers the `` global @xmath9 appearance '' region at greater than the 5@xmath5 cl .",
    "if no oscillation signal is observed , then all present anomalies , including lsnd , will be excluded at @xmath47 as an indication of neutrino oscillations .",
    "thus , this fits the call to decisively address all of the present high @xmath2 anomalies .    on the other hand , if an oscillation signal is observed , then precision measurements of the l / e dependence will allow the oscillations to be studied and quantified as shown in fig .",

    "in this paper , we have shown that isodar@juno @xmath1 disappearance experiment has sensitivity to cover the entire short - baseline appearance allowed region at 5@xmath5 .",
    "this allows for a decisive test of the question of whether the lsnd signal arises from oscillations .",
    "we also show that isodar@kamland can address a substantial region of the allowed space .",
