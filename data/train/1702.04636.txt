    "until the mid-1970s , it was believed that black holes ( bhs ) are the super absorbent objects in the universe that nothing can come out from them . in 1974 , hawking @xcite , showed that a bh can thermally create and emit virtual particles until it snuffs out its energy .",
    "it means that if a bh does not gain mass from any other source , eventually it could shrink itself out of existence , and evaporate completely : hawking radiation ( hr ) . on the other hand",
    ", hr is an intriguing puzzle resulting from the amalgamation of general relativity and quantum mechanics .",
    "as is the case with black - body radiation , hr quanta do not carry information .",
    "thermal radiation is quantum mechanically characterized by the density matrix , not with the unitary operator of the quantum wave function . since mathematically there is no transformation between the unitary operator and the density matrix , the information encoded in the wave function",
    "is irretrievably lost , which is unacceptable in quantum mechanics : the so - called information loss paradox @xcite .",
    "the efforts for resolving this problem have been continuing even today .",
    "a reader , who wants to learn  the details and recent developments about the information loss paradox may refer to @xcite .    since the original studies of bh emission @xcite , hr is studied and verified by various methods for many different types of particles having spin-@xmath0 ( @xmath1 etc . )",
    "hr studies include the lower and higher dimensional bhs , wormholes , and black strings @xcite .",
    "recent studies @xcite have claimed that hr has been observed in the laboratory environment .",
    "those experiments about the hr were conducted by steinhauer .",
    "he used a sonic ( or the so - called analogue ) bh in an atomic bose - einstein condensate @xcite so that a state , where gas bosons are cooled to @xmath2 kelvin .",
    "thus , the sonic bh could mimic a real cosmic event horizon . at this stage , steinhauer managed to observe the particles of sound ( phonons ) at the bh s event horizon : sound waves in the bose - einstein condensate obey the hawking s theory @xcite .",
    "we should also add that many physicists are still cautious about these results .",
    "there is a need for other experiments to support the experiment of steinhauer .    in particle physics ,",
    "spin-1 particles are called vector particles .",
    "the most known massive spin-1 particles , which are described by a 3 dimensional spin vector are the weak intermediate vector bosons @xmath3 and @xmath4 , and the mesons @xmath5 @xmath6/@xmath7 @xmath8 and @xmath9 @xcite .",
    "photons are the massless spin-1 particles , which can only be directed parallel or anti - parallel to their direction of motion .",
    "free massive spin-1 fields are governed by the proca field equation , and massless spin-1 fields by the maxwell field equation .",
    "there is compelling evidence that the spin-1 fields are the potential dark matter candidates @xcite . in the recent years",
    ", hr of the spin-1 particles have gained a great interest @xcite .    in the present study",
    ", we consider the rindler modified schwarzchild bh  ( rmsbh ) @xcite , which was initially proposed by grumiller to explain the mysterious attractive constant radial force acting on the pioneer spacecrafts @xcite .",
    "the force law obtained from the rindler s acceleration term has a considerable effect on the gravity at very long distances . on the other hand , turyshev et al .",
    "@xcite perceptibly showed that the reason of the pioneer anomaly is the thermal heat loss of the satellites .",
    "nevertheless , rmsbh is still on the agenda since it supplies a basis for the theoretical explanation of the following issues : explanation of the rotation curves of spiral galaxies , gravitational redshift , and perihelion shift in planetary orbits .",
    "former studies of the rmsbh , which include the subjects of spectroscopy of area / entropy , quantum tunneling , and geodesics can be seen in @xcite . in the present study , we study the hr of the massive spin-1 particles tunneling from the rmsbh . to this end , we employ the proca equation @xcite . next , we apply the quantum tunneling method @xcite to the proca equation and obtain a set of differential equations . following @xcite , we set the determinant of coefficient matrix of the equation set to zero in order to have a non - trivial solution .",
    "thus , we get the leading order term of the classical action ( @xmath10 ) of the vector particles outgoing / ingoing from the horizon .",
    "we finally derive the tunneling rate of the spin-1 particles in the rmsbh and read the hawking temperature of the rmsbh .",
    "the phenomenon of gravitational lensing , predicted by einstein s theory of general relativity , is a side effect of light moving along the curvature of spacetime , where the light passing nearby a massive object is deflected slightly toward the mass .",
    "first time , in 1919 , it was observed by eddington and dyson during a solar eclipse @xcite . since then",
    ", the gravitational lensing is one of the important tools to be used in astronomy and astrophysics . for more details and recent contributions about the gravitational lensing",

    "we shall also study the gravitational lensing problem of the rmsbh .",
    "for this purpose , we follow the geometrical method of gibbons and werner @xcite . by this way",
    ", we explore the effect of the rindler acceleration on the deflection of light moving in the ir  region of the rmsbh .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "ii we introduce the physical features of the rmsbh geometry .",
    "section iii is devoted to the computation of the hr of the massive spin-1 particles from the rmsbh . in sec .",

    "our results are summarized and discussed in sec . v.",
    "grumiller @xcite constructed an effective model for gravity of a central object at large scales : the rmsbh geometry .",
    "rindler term in the rmsbh spacetime causes to an anomalous acceleration in geodesics of test particles .",

    "since the value of @xmath14 is approximated to @xmath22 @xcite , we shall set it to zero ( @xmath23 ) for simplicity .",
    "besides , at the ir region , the value of the rindler acceleration is estimated as @xmath24 @xcite .",
    "metric function ( 3 ) can be rewritten as @xmath25    in which @xmath26    it is clear that @xmath27 can not be interpreted as the horizon since it has a negative value .",

    "furthermore , taking cognizance of the hamilton - jacobi method which takes the advantage of the symmetry of the spacetime , one can set the leading order of the action to @xmath41 where @xmath42  and @xmath43 denote the energy and angular momentum of the vector particles , respectively .",

    "we have computed the tunneling rate ( 28 ) of the rmsbh , which is ruled by the well - known boltzmann factor .",
    "then , the temperature obtained from the resulting tunneling rate is shown to be same with the original hawking temperature ( 9 ) of the rmsbh .",
    "the hawking temperature of the rmsbh proportionally increases with the rindler acceleration , which can be best seen from fig .",
    "we have also applied the geometrical approach of the gravitational lensing theory to the rmsbh .",
    "the optical metric ( 37 ) in which the geodesics are the spatial light rays of the rmsbh has been derived to calculate the gaussian curvature in the weak deflection limit . at the ir region",
    ", it has been shown that deflection angle ( 54 ) decreases with the increasing rindler acceleration value .",
    "namely , the gravitational lensing of the rmsbh is always less than the schwarzschild bh .",
    "finally , it would be interesting to explore the gravitational lensing of a rotating rmsbh , which can be easily obtained by the newman - janis algorithm @xcite . in a rotating geometry ,",
    "images are no longer collinear with the lens center @xcite",
    ". therefore , such a problem may reveal more information compared to the present case .",
