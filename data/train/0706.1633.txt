    "colloidal systems are complex fluids composed of mesoscopic particles dispersed in a solvent of microscopic particles .",
    "the large difference in size between the dispersed ( colloidal ) and the solvent entities may allow the latter to be considered as a continuum @xcite .",
    "one way to prevent colloidal particles from aggregating is to sterically stabilize them , i.e. to coat them with a suitable polymer layer .",
    "this leads to an effective repulsive interaction , frequently considered so steep that colloidal particles have been extensively modeled as hard bodies .",
    "thus , a dispersion made of spherical colloidal particles may in a first approximation be assimilated to a system of hard spheres ( hs ) , the phase behavior of which is well known . in this respect ,",
    "systems of mono ",
    "sized polymethylmethacrylate particles provide a good example @xcite .",
    "the case of binary colloidal dispersions , where two colloidal species of different size are immersed in a molecular solvent , is less clear . here",
    "the hs model may also be used to characterize colloidal interactions .",
    "sophisticated integral  equation theories for binary hs fluid mixtures indicate that , contrary to the prediction of the percus ",
    "yevick closure @xcite , demixing between two phases of different compositions may occur , provided the diameters of the two components are sufficiently different @xcite .",
    "binary mixtures of silica particles were shown to undergo phase ",
    "separation @xcite , but its nature was not ascertained .",
    "the possibility that the phases involved were both fluid could not be excluded , but recent work has given evidence that demixing involves fluid and solid phases , and that fluid  fluid segregation in hs mixtures should be excluded @xcite .",
    "the mechanism supposed to be at the basis of these demixing phenomena is known as the _ depletion effect _ , according to which there exists an effective _ attractive _ interaction between the big particles due to their clustering leading to a larger free volume available for the small particles .",
    "it was first put forward by asakura and oosawa @xcite , and later reconsidered by vrij @xcite , to explain the phase behavior of colloid  polymer mixtures .",
    "depletion effects are invoked to explain a large variety of phenomena in mixtures and have been the subject of intense theoretical effort in recent years .",
    "the validity of the effective one  component approximation ( big colloidal particles interacting via a depletion potential ) in describing the phase behavior of the actual binary hs mixture has been checked by comparison of the phase behavior obtained from the effective potential of mean force using computer simulation , with that obtained from direct computer simulations of the mixture @xcite .",
    "these studies revealed that fluid ",
    "fluid phase separation is actually unstable with respect to a fluid  solid phase transition ; other computer simulation studies , based again on the effective one  component approach , showed no indication of any ( even metastable ) fluid  fluid demixing @xcite , suggesting that slightly different approximations for the depletion potential employed may lead to quite different phase behavior .",
    "the very shape of the depletion potential appears to be very sensitive to small variations in the direct interactions among particles .",
    "for instance , slight degrees of non  additivity in binary hs systems result in depletion potentials which are very different from those calculated for the corresponding additive binary mixtures @xcite . also , residual interactions of short range and moderate strength , such as very short  ranged _ attractive _ yukawa tails , which _ prima facie _ would appear irrelevant compared to the dominant hard ",
    "body terms , have been shown to significantly affect phase behavior @xcite , tending to make the effective interactions _ less _ attractive . moreover , the importance of carefully taking into account the colloidal ",
    "colloidal direct interactions has been stressed @xcite : the total effective potential is the sum of the direct and indirect ( depletion ) contributions , and clearly the final shape depends on very fine details of both .",
    "the above  mentioned sensitivity of ( and on ) the shape of the depletion potential undermines the rather common view that mixtures of sterically  stabilized spherical colloidal particles resemble hs mixtures , and serves as a stimulus for further investigations .",
    "in particular , a largely ignored , and probably more realistic , variation on the hard  sphere theme is to consider particles to have soft , rather than hard , repulsive cores .",
    "although quite convincing experimental evidence exists about the fact that colloidal particles coated with poly12hydroxystearic acid , one of the most frequently used coating agents , should really behave as hard spheres in many solvents @xcite , it appears of relevance to investigate depletion interactions in _ repulsive _ particles of various degrees of softness .",
    "in fact , the softness of the interaction potential was shown to have a pronounced influence on the crystal nucleation of model colloidal systems @xcite , while interactions between colloidal particles may be tuned to a certain degree , for example by varying the chemical composition and thickness of the surface layer , to such an extent that soft ",
    "core colloidal particles can be realized @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "binary fluid mixtures of model soft repulsive spherical particles have been considered .",
    "the depletion interaction between two big particles induced by the small - particle component has been evaluated using computer simulation .",
    "the depletion interaction can be obtained quite straightforwardly , using molecular dynamics ( md ) simulation , as the potential of mean force on a big sphere .",
    "systems of various densities have been analyzed and the results compared with various approximations based on a virial expansion .",
    "the most salient feature of the resulting depletion potential is that the effective attraction between soft spheres is greatly enhanced with respect to the hs case : as the softness is increased , the attraction becomes substantially larger , and the effective diameter of the big spheres is reduced .",
    "since these trends of the interaction potential tend to promote fluid  fluid separation in liquids , the interesting possibility arises that fluid ",
    "fluid demixing could be stabilized in these fluids of repulsive particles . in an effort to explore this possibility ,",
    "we have applied a perturbative scheme to evaluate the free energy , and from there the complete phase diagram , for a size ratio of small and big spheres of @xmath0 .",
    "these results already indicate that fluid  fluid demixing , which a related theoretical calculation predicts it to be absent in the case of hs mixtures , is close to being stable with respect to direct fluid  solid phase separation , suggesting that further variations of the interactions , for example by further softening the interaction potentials , might induce the stability of a liquid phase in mixtures of soft repulsive spheres .    the article is organized as follows . in sec .",

    "significant differences can be seen among the attractive depletion interactions as the softness parameter is changed : in particular , the softer the pair interactions , the longer  ranged the attractive contribution .",
    "as expected , the depletion potential in the case of the hard sphere binary mixture vanishes at a distance @xmath55 , while @xmath21 in the case of soft spheres does so at progressively larger distances .",
    "all depletion potentials follow the same trend , but the softest direct potential , corresponding to the case @xmath11 , exhibits a more attractive indirect interaction .",
    "this effect is partly counterbalanced by the fact that in this case the direct interaction potential is softer , remaining positive at larger distances than in the other cases ( in fact , direct interactions vanish at a distance @xmath56 , which increases as @xmath8 is reduced ) ; the net effect is that the energy minimum @xmath57 of the total interaction potential deepens and shifts to shorter distances as @xmath8 is increased .",

    "using this criterion , it can be seen that the potential well becomes wider as the direct interactions operating in the mixture become softer .",
    "all these trends , which occur at the level of the ao approximation , are monotonic with the degree of softness .",
    "this situation changes to a certain extent when corrections from the second  order density terms are incorporated , as illustrated in fig .",

    "as expected , the depletion potentials become more negative with density . in addition , they start to show maxima at distances @xmath62@xmath63 ; these maxima become more pronounced as density is increased .",
    "the existence of an associated repulsive barrier in the depletion potentials is a well  established fact , first shown in ref .",

    "for relatively low values of @xmath51 , the smallest value of @xmath57 is observed for @xmath64 , while @xmath57 is a monotonically decreasing function of @xmath8 . in the same density regime ,",
    "the width of the potential energy well , @xmath58 , decreases steadily with @xmath51 at a fixed value of @xmath8 ; the same monotonically decreasing behavior of @xmath58 with @xmath8 occurs even at higher densities , so that @xmath65 always .",

    ", we have shown that the density expansion of the depletion potential up to second order indicates that the predictions of the simple ao approximation , namely that the potential well associated to the total interaction shifts to longer distances and becomes less attractive with respect to the hard  sphere case as the direct interactions become softer , are different at higher fluid densities : the potential well and its depth behave nonmonotonically with the softness parameter .",
    "a full calculation , valid to all orders in density , is needed to elucidate whether these trends could give rise to enhanced attractive interactions with respect to the hard ",
    "sphere mixture when the interactions become sufficiently soft .",
    "the predictions presented in the previous section are based on a density expansion of @xmath21 .",
    "since it is not practical to improve our approximation beyond the second order in density , one has to resort to computer simulation in order to check the validity of the results of the last section .",
    "we have carried out extensive md simulations on a system of two big spheres immersed in a fluid of small spheres , calculating the depletion potential directly ; this technique allows us to obtain depletion potentials which are , in principle , exact at all densities .    in the above theoretical derivation",
    ", it has been assumed from the beginning that the two big spheres remained fixed at certain positions and that their effect on the small spheres could be taken into account by means of an external potential . in our md simulations ,",
    "two methods have been used to freeze the dynamics of the big spheres .    in the first method ,",
    "the distance , @xmath7 , between the big spheres has been maintained fixed in the course of the simulation run by using the method of constraints reviewed in ref .",
    "note that we assume the two spheres to form a dimer , with translational and rotational degrees of freedom ; it is only the dynamics associated to the relative distance between the two big spheres which is frozen .",
    "this introduces an additional contribution to the free energy per particle with respect to the case where the centers of mass of the two big spheres are fixed , coming from the volume and solid angle explored by the dimer , but averaged quantities such as the potential of mean force are not affected . in the second method we fix the centers of mass of the big spheres , which therefore act as an external potential on the small spheres . in both methods ,",
    "the force , @xmath73 , acting on these bigger particles due to the smaller particles , has been calculated according to the formula first used in ref .",

    "the angular brackets indicate an average over the configurations of the small particles generated during the simulation run .",
    "this method can not be applied in hs mixtures , which require evaluation of the surface density distribution on the big spheres ; possible inaccuracies introduced by extrapolation to contact of the density histogram obtained from the simulation are not present here .",

    "@xcite about the importance of taking into account the direct interaction between the big particles .",
    "the total effective interactions which govern the thermodynamical , structural and dynamical properties of these particle systems , is in fact the sum of two contributions which may have , as in the present case , different signs but comparable absolute values in an interval of distances close to the range of the interaction between the big spheres .",
    "thus , the final shape of the total effective pair potential is clearly very sensitive to the details of the direct and indirect contributions , both on the same footing .",
    "however , in contrast with the results in ref .",
    "@xcite , where attractive interactions were considered and depletion interactions of varying nature ( attractive or even repulsive ) were obtained , in the case of repulsive direct interactions the depletion potentials are always attractive and , at high fluid densities , greatly enhanced with respect to those obtained for hs mixtures . in the light of these results , and",
    "considering that in some cases hs mixtures exhibit a metastable fluid ",
    "fluid phase separation , one may wonder whether enhanced attractive depletion forces may change the nature of demixing phenomena in mixtures .",
    "this topic will be discussed in the next section .",
    "one last issue in the present subsection involves the dependence of the depletion potential on temperature , a dependence that certainly exists as the model particles interact via smooth , as opposed to hard , interactions .",
    "therefore , the total interaction potential will in general be a parametric function not only of density , but also of temperature , @xmath107 .",
    "7 shows the md ",
    "derived depletion and total effective potentials obtained for @xmath8=6 at densities @xmath108 and @xmath109 , and temperatures @xmath99 and @xmath110 .",
    "as expected , density has a larger , dominant effect .",
    "differences between the two depletion potentials corresponding to the same density but different temperatures are discernible only at the shortest distances , the two functions being essentially superimposed for @xmath111 . in the case @xmath108 the total interaction potentials are very close even at short distances , where the two functions are positive . when @xmath51=0.740 the difference is larger at these distances , but still small .",
    "irrespective of the value of density , the depletion potential becomes stronger as temperature is increased , which is reflected in the total effective potential having a deeper and wider attractive well ; this can be understood in view of the higher momentum interchanged between particles at higher temperatures , which involves larger kinetic pressures ( and hence larger depletion effects ) and more penetrable spheres . in this respect , although density can be considered in the present context as the more physically interesting variable , being responsible for the largest variations in the effective potentials , the modest effect of temperature seen in fig .",
    "[ effettot ] could have a large impact on the phase behavior and properties of binary mixtures of the type investigated in this work .",
    "in the previous sections we have presented results for the depletion potentials of mixtures of soft spheres at various densities of the small spheres . these potentials have been computed , either using the virial expansion or by computer simulation , under the assumption of infinite dilution of the big spheres . invoking the two ",
    "body approximation , we may assume that this is the potential felt by any two pairs of big spheres when their density is arbitrarily large .",
    "indeed , the effect of three - particle interactions on the depletion potential has been argued to be overall very small @xcite .",
    "in addition , we have made our own estimates of this effect by computing the force on a trimer of big soft spheres , in an equilateral triangular configuration , at a distance between the spheres @xmath112 , which approximately coincides with the maximum of the depletion potential , and then subtracting the pair force associated to the three bonds ; the remainder is the three - body contribution .",
    "our calculation indicates that this contribution can be neglected altogether , confirming previous expectations @xcite in hard",
    " sphere mixtures .",
    "we now consider a collection of big spheres at density @xmath113 interacting via the depletion potential calculated at a density of small spheres @xmath51 . as mentioned in the introduction , a longstanding discussion was whether or not a similar mixture of hard spheres exhibits demixing , i.e. a first  order phase transition where two phases with different concentration of big and small spheres coexist .",
    "the current understanding is that hard ",
    "sphere mixtures do exhibit demixing , but it involves a fluid phase and a crystalline phase , or two crystalline phases @xcite .",
    "since , as we have shown , soft repulsive spheres are influenced by a much stronger depletion force than in the case of hard spheres , it is pertinent to ask the following questions : ( i ) does a mixture of soft  repulsive spheres exhibit demixing ? ( ii ) is the tendency toward segregation stronger than in the hard  sphere case ? ( iii ) does demixing involve two fluid phases , rather than one or the two being crystalline ?",
    "since we only intend to explore the possible phase behaviors of the mixture , we have applied a perturbation theory to calculate the phase diagram ; an alternative , in principle exact computer simulation approach is for the moment ruled out because of its relatively high computational cost .",
    "the theory is a density  functional theory based on the weighted ",
    "density approximation where a perturbation term is added , the so  called perturbative weighted density approximation ( pwda ) .",
    "the perturbative term is evaluated using the compressibility equation to fine  tune the effective radial distribution function in the crystal phase .",
    "this procedure involves a mapping onto an effective hs fluid . even though the theory can not be trusted for liquid densities beyond the crystallisation density for hard spheres , for densities less than that the predictions of the theory should be qualitatively correct .",
    "more details on the theoretical procedure can be found in ref .",
    "@xcite .    the resulting phase diagram , in the @xmath113@xmath51 plane ,",
    "is shown in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] .",
    "the continuous lines correspond to the fluid ",
    "solid binodal lines obtained from the pwda theory using depletion potentials calculated from the second  order virial expansion , eqn . ( [ total ] ) .",
    "the dashed lines are the corresponding calculation of the spinodal lines for fluid ",
    "fluid phase separation ; note that the low - density spinodal should be given qualitatively correctly by the pwda theory ( maybe not so in the case of the high  density spinodal ) .",
    "it can be seen that fluid  fluid separation is always metastable with respect to the fluid  solid transition .",
    "pwda calculations based on depletion potentials calculated from simulation are indicated by symbols . as expected , the two results are very similar for low values of @xmath51 , where the truncated virial expansion is supposed to be accurate . at higher densities @xmath51 ,",
    "the two sets of depletion potentials give different but compatible results ( for both binodal and spinodal lines ) .",
    "for the sake of illustration we include in fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] , as dotted lines , the results for the fluid  solid binodal line from a slightly different version of perturbation theory @xcite as applied to the corresponding hs mixture using the depletion potential of roth et al .",
    "in fact , the hs fluid  fluid spinodal line predicted by this theory occurs at very high solvent densities , too high to appear in the range of fig .",
    "[ phasediagram ] ; given that the effective depletion potential is not valid in this regime @xcite , we conclude that , for the present value of size ratio , fluid ",
    "fluid phase separation in effective hs mixtures is , if anything , highly metastable with respect to direct fluid  solid phase equilibrium .",
    "in contrast , in the case of soft interactions , fluid ",
    "fluid phase separation is close to being stable with respect to fluid ",
    "solid phase separation .",
    "the predictions of perturbation theory as to the large differences between hs and soft ",
    "sphere mixtures is very significant and illustrate the effect on the phase behavior of the significantly more attractive effective interactions operating in soft - sphere mixtures than in the corresponding hs mixtures .",
    "one can speculate on possible variations of the soft repulsive bare potentials ( in the direction of making them even softer , for instance ) that could promote the stability of the fluid phase , and its associated critical point , with respect to the solid phase .",
    "actually , recent work @xcite supports the possibility that an increasingly deeper and , especially , wider attractive well could lead to the observation of a stable fluid ",
    "fluid phase separation in these binary systems . in any case ,",
    "use of an improved theory and more extensive simulations on fluids with other types of interactions and at different temperatures are needed , since the final outcome appears to be the result of a delicate free - energy balance between the fluid and the solid .",
    "further exploration of these topics are left for future work .",
    "the present results are considered pertinent to real experimental binary colloidal dispersions .",
    "it is known that many of them exhibit a fluid ",
    "fluid demixing transition and a phase behavior which is temperature dependent ( for a discussion of the effect of temperature on the properties of sterically stabilized colloidal systems see ref .",
    "@xcite ) , two facts that are not captured by assimilating the colloidal particles to hard bodies but that could be by modeling them as soft  core objects .    indeed ,",
    "the pair  potential models investigated should be relevant to sterically stabilized colloids . in these systems",
    ", the degree of softness of the direct interactions can be controlled by varying the chemical composition and/or , especially , the thickness of the coating polymer layer : we could in principle expect that an increase in thickness produces softer interactions .",
    "recently , an experimental study has been carried out on binary dispersions formed by colloids sterically stabilized with a coating polymer layer of varying chemical composition and thickness @xcite . although no stable fluid ",
    "fluid separation was observed , evidence for weakly metastable fluid ",
    "fluid demixing has been suggested for the mixture with the thickest stabilizing layer .",
    "these results have been interpreted in terms of a non  additive hard  sphere model . however , another , perhaps physically more sound , explanation of these experimental facts can be given in terms of the degree of interaction softness .",
    "an interesting sequel of the study of hennequin et al .",
    "@xcite could be an investigation of additional binary suspensions of sterically stabilized colloids with varying thicknesses of the coating polymer layer .",
    "further theoretical work along the lines presented in the previous section could also be valuable and guide possible experimental research avenues .",
    "we hope that the present results will stimulate the search for real colloidal binary mixtures where interparticle interactions can be tuned from hard to soft  sphere  like , as well as an investigation of how the phase behavior and the properties of such mixtures evolve upon changing such characteristics .",
    "indeed , charge and sterically stabilized monodisperse colloidal suspensions have recently been reported where the softness of the interactions is controlled by the concentration of the added salt @xcite . although the pair potential models investigated in this work are not appropriate for charge  stabilized colloids , as the presence of charges requires a different functional form for the model pair interactions , the observed evolution of the depletion and total effective interactions with density and degree of softness of the direct interactions should be quite general .",
    "thus , we believe it would be interesting to extend the study of ref . @xcite to bidisperse suspensions .",
