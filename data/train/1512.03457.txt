    "the ricci flow @xcite of a metric @xmath1 is described by the equation @xmath2 where @xmath3 is the ricci tensor of the metric @xmath1 .",
    "though there is an extensive literature on the mathematical properties of ricci flows @xcite there is far less material concerning numerical methods for ricci flow @xcite .    in 2005",
    "rubinstein and sinclair @xcite presented a some numerical studies of 2-dimensional ricci flow for two classes of geometries , one in which the geometry was axisymmetric , and a second more general class in which the axisymmetric condition was dropped . in both cases the surfaces were closed 2-surfaces topologically equivalent to a 2-sphere .",
    "they displayed their results for a variety of initial configurations and where possible , displayed the evolved 2-surfaces as isometric embeddings in @xmath4 .",
    "it is well known that not all 2-geometries can be realised as an isometric embedding in @xmath4 .",
    "however , for the axisymmetric case they showed that the ricci flow would preserve the existence of an embedding in @xmath4 .",
    "they also showed , for the non - axisymmetric case , that under the ricci flow it may not be possible , at later times , to embedded the surface isometricly in @xmath4 .",
    "for both classes of geometries rubinstein and sinclair were able to demonstrate the expected behaviour for late term evolution under ricci flow , namely , that in the absence of neck - pinching , the geometry evolves towards that of a 2-sphere .",
    "their numerical studies were however limited by numerical issues that caused the evolution to fail at late times .",
    "other works include a series of papers by kim and co - workers @xcite in which they used a modified ricci flow to solve the problem of finding a 2-metric that matches a prescribed gaussian curvature .",
    "miller and his co - workers @xcite have used their extensive experience in the regge calculus to explore numerical simulations of ricci flow in @xmath5 .",
    "they have also recently reported on neck pinching singularities in 3-dimensions @xcite .",
    "the works of kim and miller both employ simplicial methods to estimate the curvatures .",
    "in contrast garfinkle and isenberg @xcite used traditional finite difference methods to follow the ricci flow for a class of geometries on @xmath5 .",
    "they were particularly interested in the formation of neck pinching singularities and the development of critical behaviour in the solutions along the lines found by choptuik @xcite .",
    "the purpose of this paper is to use the axisymmetric models of rubinstein and sinclair as a basis to demonstrate a novel method for computational differential geometry .",
    "this method is based on the idea that a smooth geometry can be approximated by a finite set of overlapping cells , with each cell defined by a small set of vertices and legs , and in which each cell carries a locally smooth metric .",
    "such a structure is known as a smooth lattice and has been successfully employed in constructing numerical solutions of the einstein field equations ( see @xcite ) .",
    "since this smooth lattice method is not widely known it seems appropriate to provide a short review of the method .",
    "a smooth lattice can be considered as a generalisation of a simplicial lattice this being a manifold built from a finite collection of simplices each endowed with a flat metric .",
    "the simplicial lattice , also known as a piecewise flat lattice , is the basis of many studies in discrete differential geometry and has also been used in general relativity in a formulation known as the regge calculus ( @xcite ) .",
    "the simplicial and smooth lattices differ in one important aspect ",
    "the smooth lattice uses a locally smooth metric rather than a piecewise flat metric .",
    "the domain over which each locally smooth metric is defined is bounded by the nearby vertices and legs .",
    "each such domain is known as a computational cell and pairs of adjacent cells are allowed to have a non - trivial overlap .",
    "the picture that emerges form this is much like that of an atlas of charts that covers a manifold .",
    "each chart can be viewed as a computational cell while the overlap between pairs of cells defines the transition functions between overlapping charts .",
    "a simple example of 2-dimensional smooth lattice is shown in figure ( [ fig:2dlattice ] ) .",
    "this shows a lattice composed of the yellow legs and red vertices that forms a discrete approximation to the underlying smooth blue surface .",
    "the figure also shows two overlapping computational cells .",
    "the data that is employed in a smooth lattice is at least the set of leg lengths and possibly other geometric data such as the riemann tensor within each computational cell .",
    "note that the leg length assigned to any one leg is a property of that leg ( i.e. , if a leg is shared by a pair of cells then each cell uses the same length for that leg ) .",
    "it should also be noted that each leg is viewed as a geodesic segment of a ( possibly unknown ) smooth geometry ( the geometry for which the smooth lattice is an approximation ) . without this assumption",
    "the path joining the vertices of a leg would be ambiguous ( and cell dependent ) .",
    "this geodesic assumption imposes a soft constraint on the vertices of the lattice ",
    "they must be chosen so that the geodesic for each leg is uniquely defined . for smooth geometries",
    "this is always possibly by a suitable refinement of the lattice .",
    "using a local smooth metric allows the usual machinery of differential geometry to be applied directly to the lattice .",
    "in contrast , the piecewise constant nature of the metric on a simplicial lattice requires considerable care when applying differential operators to the lattice .",
    "for example , the curvature tensor on a simplicial lattice must be interpreted in the sense of distributions .    since each leg in a computational cell is assumed to be defined as the unique geodesic for that leg , it follows that it is always possible to construct a local set of riemann normal coordinates in each computational cell .",
    "denote these coordinates by @xmath6 .",
    "then the smooth metric , in this cell , can be written as @xmath7 where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is a typical length scale for the cell .",
    "using riemann normal coordinates allows some useful quantities to be easily computed .",
    "for example the arc - length @xmath10 of the geodesic connecting vertices @xmath11 and @xmath12 is given by @xmath13 while the unit tangent vector @xmath14 to the geodesic , at vertex @xmath11 , is given by @xmath15 in the above pair of equations @xmath16 are the riemann normal coordinates of vertex @xmath11 and @xmath17 .    both of these equations will be used later when developing one particular method to evolve the ricci flow .",
    "for their axisymmetric geometries rubinstein and sinclair choose coordinates @xmath18 in which the 2-metric is given by @xmath19 with @xmath20 and @xmath21 .",
    "smoothness of the metric at @xmath22 and @xmath23 requires @xmath24 where the dash @xmath25 denotes the derivative with respect to @xmath26 .",
    "the components of the ricci tensor are , for @xmath27 , @xmath28        r_{\\rho\\rho } & = \\frac{(m')^2}{4m^2 } - \\frac{m''}{2 m } + \\frac{m'h'}{4mh}\\\\[5pt ]        r_{\\theta\\theta } & = \\frac{(m')^2}{4mh } - \\frac{m''}{2h } + \\frac{m'h'}{4h^2 }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] while at the the poles , where @xmath22 or @xmath23 , @xmath29        r_{\\rho\\rho } & = \\frac{m''''}{4 m '' } - \\frac{h''}{2h }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    the ricci flow equation ( [ eqn : ricciflow ] ) , for this metric in these coordinates , can then be written as @xmath30        \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t } & = -\\frac{(m')^2}{2m^2 }                                         + \\frac{m''}{m } - \\frac{m'h'}{2mh }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] for @xmath27 and as @xmath31        \\frac{\\partial h}{\\partial t } & = \\frac{h''}{h } - \\frac{m''''}{2 m '' }     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] at the poles .      the basic data on a smooth lattice includes the leg - lengths , the riemann normal coordinates and the corresponding riemann curvatures all of which must be considered as functions of time under the ricci flow .",
    "the question then must be  how might each of these quantities be evolved forward in time ?",
    "consider first the evolution of the leg - lengths .",
    "the natural starting point would be the basic ricci flow equation which , in coordinate form , can be written as @xmath32 consider a typical leg defined by the vertices @xmath11 and @xmath12 .",
    "sub - divide this leg into many short segments and let a typical segment have end points @xmath33 and @xmath34 .",
    "our first step will be to form an estimate for the evolution of the segment followed by a summation over all segments to obtain an evolution equation for the leg .",
    "choose a new set of coordinates @xmath35 tied to the vertices of the segment ( i.e. , the coordinates of the vertices do not change with time ) .",
    "the squared length of the segment joining @xmath33 and @xmath34 can be estimated as @xmath36 where @xmath37 and @xmath38 is the truncation error ( in using the first term to estimate @xmath39 ) .",
    "note that if the geodesic joining @xmath11 to @xmath12 does not pass through any curvature singularites then @xmath40 will be finite along that geodesic .",
    "let @xmath41 be a unit vector tangent to the geodesic pointing from @xmath33 to @xmath34 . then from ( [ eqn : ricciflowcoord ] ) and using @xmath42 , it follows that @xmath43 which , upon summing over all segments , leads to @xmath44 the final step is to take the limit as the number of segments @xmath45 approaches infinity .",
    "the first sum on the right hand side is in the form of a riemann sum while the second term is subject to @xmath46 and thus vanishes as @xmath47 provided @xmath48 .",
    "this leads to the basic evolution equation for the leg - lengths , namely @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the arc - length along the geodesic joining @xmath11 to @xmath12 and @xmath51 is the unit - tangent to the geodesic .",
    "note that since the integrand is a pure scalar the restriction to the adapated coordinates @xmath35 is no longer required .",
    "thus equation ( [ eqn : evolvelij ] ) is valid in all frames .    in any numerical code",
    "the integral in ( [ eqn : evolvelij ] ) must of course be estimated in terms of data available on the lattice .",
    "one example would be a trapezoidal rule such as @xmath52 in which the values for @xmath53 are obtained from two cells , one based on vertex @xmath11 , the other based on vertex @xmath12 .",
    "all of the results presented in section ( [ sec : results ] ) used the above approximation .",
    "note also that for the case of a 2-metric , @xmath54 , and thus the right hand side of ( [ eqn : evolvelij ] ) can be expressed as @xmath55 .",
    "this shows clearly that if the riemann curvatures are known then the leg - lengths can be evolved .",
    "so the question now is  how are the riemann curvatures obtained ?",
    "two methods will be presented , one in which the riemann curvatures are derived from the leg - lengths and a second method in which they are evolved in consort with the leg - lengths . in both cases",
    "the riemann normal coordinates are obtained directly from the lattice data .",
    "the first method , in which the curvatures are derived from the leg - lengths , works as follows .",
    "consider a typical 2-dimensional cell consisting of a set of @xmath45 triangles sharing a common vertex .",
    "the data to be computed are the @xmath56 coordinates for the @xmath57 vertices and the one curvature component for the cell giving a total of @xmath58 unknowns .",
    "however , three of the coordinates can be freely chosen ( e.g. , locate the origin at the central vertex and align one axis with one of the legs ) reducing the number of unknowns to @xmath59 .",
    "there are also @xmath59 constraints provided by the known leg - lengths .",
    "thus the coordinates and curvatures can be found by solving the coupled system of equations given above ( [ eqn : rnclsq ] ) .",
    "one objection to this method is that it can be computationally expensive to solve this system of equations at each time step .    in the second approach ,",
    "the riemann curvatures are evolved using known evolution equations for the riemann curvatures .",
    "morgan and tian @xcite show that and the ricci tensor by @xmath60 , under ricci flow and in a local riemann normal frame , @xmath61 ( see equation 3.6 of @xcite ) .    for the case of a 2-dimensional metric , where @xmath54 , it is easy to show from ( [ eqn : ricciflowcoord ] ) and ( [ eqn : evolverij ] ) that @xmath62    a convenient lattice , for the 2-dimensional axisymmetric case , is shown in figure ( [ fig : ladder ] ) .",
    "this has a ladder like structure in which each computational cell consists of three consecutive rungs of the ladder .",
    "pairs of cells overlap over a pairs of rungs .",
    "a typical cell is shown in figure ( [ fig : basiccell ] ) where the length of the rungs are denoted by @xmath63 and the origin of the riemann normal coordinates is chosen at the centre of the rung and aligned with the @xmath64-axis pointing to the right and parallel to the rung .",
    "it is possible to explicitly solve the leg - length equations ( [ eqn : rnclsq ] ) ( see appendix [ app : limitrnc ] for full details ) but for this particular lattice there is a much quicker road to an equation linking the @xmath63 to the riemann curvature .",
    "the axisymmetry of the geometry shows that the rails of the ladder can be chosen to be geodesics that extend from the north to south poles .",
    "thus it is not surprising that a geodesic deviation equation of the form @xmath65 applies to this lattice ) ( as shown in appendix [ app : limitrnc ] ) . ] .",
    "this equation was used in the numerical simulations described below to compute @xmath66 given the @xmath63 on the lattice .",
    "the second method uses equation ( [ eqn : evolver ] ) to evolve the ricci scalar .",
    "however this requires values for @xmath67 which in the local riemann normal coordinates are given by @xmath68 at first glance it seems that a simple finite difference scheme could be used to estimate the derivatives on the right hand side .",
    "this would be incorrect as it fails to take account of the different coordinate frames being used in each cell .",
    "one way to deal with this issue is to pick one cell and extend its coordinates into the neighbouring cells .",
    "this allows coordinate transformations to be made so that data from neighbouring cells can be imported into the chosen cell . at this point",
    "the finite difference approximation can be made . for our choice of lattice",
    "this leads to ( see appendix [ app : nablarnc ] ) @xmath69 where @xmath50 is the arc - length measured from the north and south poles and where @xmath70 is the ordinary derivative with respect to @xmath50 .    in summary",
    "the evolution equations for this lattice are as follows .",
    "the leg - lengths are evolved using ( [ eqn : evolvelij ] ) while the curvatures are evolved using @xmath71",
    "rubinstein and sinclair chose a two parameter family of initial data of the form @xmath72 for @xmath20 and where @xmath73 and @xmath74 are freely chosen constants . note",
    "that this choice of initial data is clearly consistent with the smoothness condition ( [ eqn : rssmooth ] ) .",
    "the initial data for the rubinstein and sinclair model was obtained by sampling the above metric functions on a uniform initial grid , namely , at @xmath75 with @xmath76 .",
    "the same uniform grid was used to set the initial data for the smooth lattice .",
    "vertices were distributed uniformly from the north to south pole with labels ranging from @xmath77 at the north pole to @xmath45 at the south pole .",
    "the length of the leg joining vertex @xmath11 to @xmath78 ( i.e. , one segment of one rail of the ladder ) is denoted by @xmath79 while the length of the transverse leg passing through vertex @xmath11 ( i.e. , one of the rungs of the ladder ) is denoted by @xmath80 .",
    "finally , the ricci scalar at vertex @xmath11 is denoted by @xmath81 .",
    "the leg lengths @xmath80 and @xmath79 between the north pole and the equator were computed using a numerical geodesic integrator while symmetry across the equatorial plane was used to set the remaining leg lengths ( rubinstein and sinclair do likewise for their initial data ) .",
    "though the use of a numerical grid adapted to the symmetry reduces the computational complexity it does introduce its own problems at the poles .",
    "this is clear from the form of the evolution equations in which various terms are unbounded for grid points arbitrarily close to the poles .",
    "thus some care must be taken when evolving data at or close to the poles .",
    "rubinstein and sinclair used equations ( [ eqn : rsflowb ] ) at the poles .",
    "they also noted that local errors near the poles could violate the smoothness condition ( [ eqn : rssmooth ] ) .",
    "they dealt with this problem by replacing the evolved values of @xmath82 with @xmath83 with @xmath84 a smooth function with values peaked at the poles and rapidly decaying to 1 away from the poles .",
    "this function @xmath84 was specially crafted to preserve the smoothness condition ( [ eqn : rssmooth ] ) .",
    "a different approach was employed for the smooth lattice equations . in this case",
    "the symmetry of the underlying geometry was used to extend the data across the poles .",
    "for example , the rails of the lattice are readily extended across the poles as shown in figure ( [ fig : over - poles ] ) .",
    "then at the north pole , @xmath85 while @xmath86 and @xmath87 with a similar pattern applied at the south pole .",
    "this makes it easy to compute symmetric finite difference approximations for all non - singular terms in the neighbourhood of the poles .",
    "let the vertices of the extended lattice be labelled by @xmath11 with values @xmath88 where @xmath89 is a small postive integer and where the poles have @xmath90 and @xmath91 .",
    "for method 1 , the values of @xmath66 on the lattice were calculated as follows .",
    "let @xmath92 be another small postive integer .",
    "then for @xmath93 use equation ( [ eqn : rncevolver ] ) to compute @xmath66 while for the remaining values of @xmath11 use local polynomial interpolation to fill in the remaining values for @xmath66 . for method 2",
    "there are two choices available , either interpolate the time derivatives of @xmath66 befor a time step or interpolate @xmath66 after a time step .",
    "the first choice failed badly for the double dumbbell but work well for the 2-sphere and the single dumbbell . the second choice , to interpolate after a time step , worked very well for all three initial data sets .",
    "note that a fourth order runge - kutta method ( as used here ) includes four time steps .",
    "the interpolation just described was applied after each of the four time steps of the runge - kutta method .",
    "note that the rotational symmetry can be used to good effect in the interpolation . consider a smooth function @xmath94 defined in a neighbourhood of the either pole and where @xmath50 is the arc - length ( along the geodesic ) measured from the pole .",
    "suppose @xmath94 is an even function of @xmath50 ( such as for example @xmath66 and its time derivative )",
    ". then @xmath94 can be expanded as a power series @xmath95 for some set of coefficients @xmath96 let @xmath97 be the discrete value of @xmath94 at @xmath98 for @xmath99 .",
    "then @xmath100 for @xmath101 can be estimated by polynomial interpolation on the data @xmath102 .",
    "this not only ensures smoothness across the poles but also creates higher order estimates than would be obtained using the data @xmath103 .",
    "all of the results presented below were obtained using @xmath104 and @xmath105 .      in an attempt to minimise high frequency errors , rubinstein and",
    "sinclair filtered out high frequency components in the gid values for @xmath106 and @xmath107 .",
    "they observed that this reduced but did not cure the problem of numerical instabilities .",
    "no filtering of this kind was used in the smooth lattice codes .      consider an initial lattice in which the vertices are uniformly distributed ( i.e.",
    ", @xmath79 is constant over the range of @xmath11 ) . at later times the vertices",
    "will no longer be uniformly distributed with some vertices being drawn together while others will be pushed apart .",
    "this is a natural outcome of the evolution under the ricci flow .",
    "unfortunately this can introduce two problems .",
    "first , as some leg lengths shrink , the corresponding time step set by courant condition may become prohibitively small .",
    "second , the ensuing irregular structure in the lattice will lead to increasing truncation errors in the estimates of the first and second derivatives required in equations ( [ eqn : rncevolver ] ) .",
    "these problems can be reduced by periodic re - gridding of the lattice as follows .",
    "create a new lattice , with uniformly distributed @xmath79 , then use quadratic interpolation to produce new values for @xmath80 and @xmath66 on the new lattice .",
    "this simple scheme proved to be the key step in obtaining long term stable integrations .",
    "this observation was also noted by rubinstein and sinclair ( using a scheme almost identical to that used here though they refer to this as a reparametrization of the data ) .",
    "the ricci flow equations are a form of heat equation and thus when using explicit forward time integrators ( such as a fourth - order runge - kutta for the smooth lattice or the ftcs used by rubinstein and sinclair ) a courant like condition should be used to ensure stability of the numerical solution .",
    "the courant condition for a numerical heat equation is of the form @xmath108 where @xmath109 is the courant factor , @xmath110 the time step and @xmath111 a typical discretisation scale . for both smooth lattice methods",
    "it was found that choosing @xmath112 worked very well with no signs of instabilties throughout the simulation .",
    "it is interesting to note that rubinstein and sinclair chose a fixed time step of @xmath113 .",
    "this may explain the instabilities they observed later in their evolutions .      a natural question to ask is ",
    "can the 2-dimensional geometries generated by the ricci flow always be isometricly embedded in euclidian @xmath114 ? in the general case , where no symmetries apply , the answer is no .",
    "but for the case of a rotationally symmetric geometry rubinstein and sinclair showed that an embedding is always possible .",
    "they went on to show that the isometric surface in @xmath114 could be generated by rotating the curve described by @xmath115 for @xmath20 around the @xmath64-axis ( where @xmath116 are the usual cartesian coordinates covering @xmath114 ) .",
    "note that this curve passes through @xmath117 .",
    "however for aesthetic effect it is convenient to translate the curve along the @xmath64-axis so that @xmath118 . for the initial data given above ( [ eqn : initialg ] )",
    "this produces a curve that is reflection symmetric in the @xmath119-axis .",
    "a similar construction should be possible starting form the lattice variables @xmath63 and @xmath120 .",
    "one approach would be to first extract the metric functions @xmath106 and @xmath121 from the lattice data @xmath63 and @xmath120 and to the then compute the generating curve using equations ( [ eqn : rsembedxy ] ) .",
    "however , there is a simpler and more direct approach .",
    "consider two planes .",
    "the first plane @xmath122 is the @xmath123-plane while the second plane @xmath124 obtained by a small rotation of @xmath122 around the @xmath64-axis .",
    "the lattice , viewed as a ladder , is then inserted between this pair of planes with each end of the ladder tied to the @xmath64-axis .",
    "the cartesian coordinates of each vertex can be computed from the @xmath80 and @xmath79 as follows .",
    "let the @xmath125 be the coordinates of vertex @xmath11 in @xmath122 .",
    "the coordinates , @xmath126 , of the corresponding vertex in @xmath124 will be obtained by a rotation of @xmath125 by an angle @xmath127 , independent of @xmath11 , around the @xmath64-axis .",
    "thus @xmath128 start by setting @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "note that setting @xmath131 ensures that embedded surface is locally flat at the north pole . then @xmath132 and @xmath133 but the leg joining @xmath134 to @xmath135 ( i.e. , a rung of the ladder ) has length @xmath136 and thus using the euclidean metric of @xmath114 leads to @xmath137 which allows @xmath127 to be computed from @xmath136 and @xmath138 .",
    "the remaining coordinates are computed in a similar manner .",
    "suppose the coordinates for vertices @xmath139 have been computed .",
    "then the coordinates for the next vertex @xmath11 are obtained by solving the coupled pair of equations @xmath140 for @xmath125 .",
    "once all of the coordinates have been computed the curve is translated along the @xmath64-axis , to centre the curve , by the replacement @xmath141 where @xmath142 is the ( original ) @xmath64-coordinate of the vertex on the equator .",
    "results for three distinct initial datasets , two that match those of rubinstein and sinclair and a third for a unit 2-sphere , will be presented .",
    "the first dataset , which has the look of a single dumbbell , uses @xmath143 while the second dataset , a double dumbbell , has @xmath144 and the third is a unit 2-sphere with @xmath145 .",
    "the slrf codes were run until the time step had been reduced by a pre - determined factor ( 200 for the 2-sphere and 400 for the dumbells ) .",
    "the ricci - rot code ran until it detected significant numerical errors ( beyond this point the code would crash ) .",
    "the run time for the ricci - rot codes was always shorter than that for the slrf - codes .    for initial data based on a unit",
    "2-sphere it is a easy to show that the subsequent evolution continues to be a 2-sphere with a radius @xmath146 that evolves according to @xmath147 this not only shows that @xmath148 as @xmath149 but it also provides a very simple test of each of the three computer codes , the rubinstein and sinclair code ( which they named ricci - rot ) and the two smooth lattice codes ( which will be referred to as slrf - v1 and slrf - v2 corresponding to the two smooth lattice methods ) . figure ( [ fig:2sphere12 ] ) displays the the fractional error in @xmath150 , defined by @xmath151 as a function of time .",
    "it shows clearly that , for this initial data , the three codes produce very good results . the upward trend in the curves near",
    "@xmath152 is most likely a numerical artefact due to the rapidly increasing curvature ( @xmath153 at @xmath154 ) .",
    "the small noise in the curves are due to the re - gridding ( slrf - v1,v2 ) and filtering ( ricci - rot ) .",
    "figures ( [ fig:2sphere1xdbell],[fig:2xdbell ] ) display a history of the embeddings for each of the three models with each figure showing results from all three codes ( short dashes for ricci - rot , a longer dashes for slrf - v1 and a solid line for slrf - v2 ) .",
    "the ricci - rot code generally terminated much earlier than the slrf codes and this can be seen in the upper panel of figure ( [ fig:2sphere1xdbell ] ) which shows a lone dashed curve this being the final curve computed by the ricci - rot code .",
    "similar lone curves can be seen in figure ( [ fig:2xdbell ] ) .    for the 2-sphere and single dumbbell all three codes gave almost identical results ( the three curves appearing almost as a single curve ) but for the double dumbbell there is a small difference between the codes at later times .",
    "this difference is almost certainly due to discretisation errors .",
    "this claim was tested by running the codes with an increased number of grid points ( from 100 to 200 for slrf - v1,v2 and from 801 to 1201 for ricci - rot for 1601 grid points . ] ) .",
    "the results are shown in figure ( [ fig:2xdbell ] ) which shows improved agreement between all three codes .",
    "the fact that all three codes produce almost identical results should not be understated .",
    "the codes employ fundamentally different algorithms , they were written by different people and in different computer languages ( ricci - rot in c and slrf - v1,v2 in ada ) . that these codes agree as well as they do is a very strong indication that they are giving correct results .",
    "though the results presented here for the smooth lattice method are encouraging much work still remains to be done .",
    "for example , can the method be used for non - symmetric geometries in two or more dimensions ?",
    "another line of investigation would to be to compare the relative merits of the two smooth lattice methods presented here .",
    "it might be argued that in the absence of global geodesics the first method would be ruled out as the geodesic deviation equation could not be readily adapted to the lattice .",
    "however , it would still be possible to extract estimates for @xmath66 , without resort to the geodesic equation , as shown in appendix ( [ app : limitrnc ] ) . these and other questions will be explored in a later paper .",
    "the clear separation between the metric and topology on the lattice seems well suited to the study of ricci flow in 3 dimensions where complex behaviours are known to develop .",
    "in section ( [ sec : slrf ] ) it was claimed that the geodesic deviation equation ( [ eqn : geodesicdev ] ) can be obtained from the leg - length equation ( [ eqn : rnclsq ] ) provided that the rails of the ladder ( see figure ( [ fig : ladder ] ) ) are be chosen to be geodesics of the 2-geometry .",
    "the purpose of this appendix is to fill in the details of that claim .",
    "a single computational cell is shown in figure ( [ fig : basiccell ] ) .",
    "this consists of seven vertices and eight legs .",
    "the riemann normal coordinates are chosen so that the origin is located at the centre of leg @xmath155 and the @xmath64-axis is aligned to the same leg .",
    "the assumed symmetries in the 2-geometry ensures that the coordinates for each of the seven vertices can be chosen as shown in table ( [ tbl : rnccoords ] ) .",
    "height 14pt depth 7pt width 0pt # 1to 40pt@xmath156 # 1to 20pt@xmath156 # 1to 12pt@xmath156 # 1to 10pt@xmath156    .the riemann normal coordinates of the 6 of the 7 vertices in figure ( [ fig : basiccell ] ) .",
    "the remaining vertex @xmath157 has coordinates @xmath117 .",
    "[ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]     with this choice of coordinates it is a simple matter to write out in full the leg - length equations ( [ eqn : rnclsq ] ) .",
    "this leads to @xmath158        ( \\delta s_m)^2 & = l^2_{af } = \\frac{1}{4}(2x_f - l_{xo})^2                                        + y^2_f - \\frac{1}{6}(l_{xo}y_f)^2 r     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath159 and @xmath160 are defined by @xmath161 , @xmath162 and @xmath163 is the ricci scalar .",
    "this is a non - linear system of four equations for five unknowns , namely , the curvature @xmath66 and the four coordinates @xmath164 and @xmath165 .",
    "put aside , for the moment , the obvious problem that an extra equation is required to fully determine all five unknowns .",
    "then the above equations can be viewed as a set of four equations for the four unknown coordinates .",
    "consider now the progression towards the continuum limit where the computational cells will be much smaller than the length scale associated with the curvature ( e.g. , @xmath166 ) .",
    "it follows that the curvature terms in the above equations will be small compared to the leading terms and thus it should be possible to express the coordinates as a power series in @xmath66 .",
    "thus put @xmath167 similar expansions could be made for @xmath168 and @xmath169 .",
    "however , equations ( [ eqn : thelsqs ] ) contain @xmath170 and @xmath171 but not @xmath172 nor @xmath173 .",
    "thus it is simpler to use a power series for @xmath174 rather than for @xmath119 , that is @xmath175 substituting these into equations ( [ eqn : thelsqs ] ) and then following the standard procedure of expansion and equating terms leads to @xmath176 for the @xmath177 terms and @xmath178 for the @xmath179 terms .",
    "this set of equations are easily solved leading to @xmath180        96 y^2_f & = 48\\left(4(\\delta s_m)^2-(l_{xo}-l_{xm})^2\\right)\\\\                 & - \\left((l_{xo}-l_{xm})^2 - 4 (                            \\delta s_m)^2\\right)(4l^2_{ox}+l_{xm}l_{xo}-l^2_{mx})r     \\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    there remains of course the issue of the missing equation .",
    "since there are no more leg - length equations to invoke that final equation must come from some constraint to remove any remaining freedoms in the structure of the lattice .",
    "there are considerable freedoms in choosing where to locate the vertices on the 2-geometry .",
    "an obvious choice is to require that the edges that comprise the rails of the ladder form a global geodesic ( i.e. , a single geodesic that stretches form the north to south pole ) .",
    "this can be achieved by requiring the tangent vectors along the rails to be continuous from one segment to the next ( e.g. , from leg @xmath181 to leg @xmath182 ) .",
    "continuity of the tangent vector at vertex @xmath33 in figure ( [ fig : basiccell ] ) thus requires @xmath183 there are actually two equations here , one for each component of the vectors",
    ". however , the @xmath119 component yields a trivial equation in the continuum limit which leaves just the @xmath64 component as the required final equation . using equation ( [ eqn : rncgeodesictangent ] ) to construct the unit tangent vectors @xmath184 and @xmath185 and then setting @xmath186 to zero leads to the following equation @xmath187 it is not hard to see that this is a non - uniform finite difference approximation for the following differential equation @xmath188 where now @xmath189 .",
    "this equation can be reduced to the geodesic deviation equation in the case where @xmath9 is taken to be very small relative to the curvature scales .",
    "in this appendix the details of the calculations leading to equation ( [ eqn : flatlaplacian ] ) will be presented .",
    "as noted in the text ( section [ sec : slrf ] ) , a correct calculation of @xmath190 will require proper attention to the coordinate transformations required when sharing data between neighbouring frames .",
    "the calculation of @xmath67 will proceed by way of a finite difference method but not before the relevant data has been imported from the neighbouring frames .",
    "the first job then is to build these transformations .",
    "figure ( [ fig:5cells ] ) shows a set of 5 computational cells .",
    "cells @xmath191 and @xmath192 are three consecutive cells on the lattice while cells @xmath193 and @xmath194 are ghost cells created as clones of cell @xmath157 .",
    "the data in the ghost cells @xmath193 and @xmath194 are , by axisymmetry , identical to the data in cell @xmath157 .",
    "however the basis vectors of their coordinate frames are not aligned to each other .",
    "it is easy to see that there is a simple rotation that maps the basis vectors from one cell to the other .",
    "consider now a vector field @xmath195 on the 2-dimensional manifold .",
    "let @xmath196 denote the coordinate frame associated with the cell @xmath192 .",
    "let @xmath197 denote the components of @xmath195 at the point @xmath33 in the frame @xmath198 .",
    "suppose that @xmath195 is a vector that respects the axisymmetry of the 2-geometry , then @xmath199 now at the point @xmath193 the basis vectors for frame @xmath200 are a rotation of those for @xmath201 .",
    "thus @xmath202 for some angle @xmath203 .",
    "this is one step in the process of importing data into frame @xmath204 .",
    "the same argument can be applied for right hand frame @xmath205 .",
    "this leads to @xmath206 clearly no rotations are required for the frames @xmath207 , @xmath201 and @xmath208 and thus @xmath209 the components of the vector @xmath195 are now known at all five points in the one frame , @xmath204 .",
    "thus the derivatives at @xmath157 can be estimated using a finite difference method .",
    "for example @xmath210 but @xmath211 and thus @xmath212 and to leading order in the lattice scale @xmath213 thus @xmath214 where @xmath215 has been abbreviated to @xmath216 and @xmath217 to @xmath63 .",
    "since the transformations between the frames @xmath207 , @xmath201 and @xmath208 are trivial there is no need to pay any special attention to the @xmath119 derivatives .",
    "they can be computed as regular finite differences on the raw data in these frames .",
    "thus at @xmath157 and in the riemann normal frame ay @xmath157 @xmath218    suppose now that the vector field @xmath195 is the gradient of some scalar function @xmath219 .",
    "then @xmath220 and @xmath221 and since the @xmath119 coordinate measures proper distance along the lattice it follows that @xmath222 and thus @xmath223 which agrees with ( [ eqn : flatlaplacian ] ) for the particular case where @xmath224 ."
