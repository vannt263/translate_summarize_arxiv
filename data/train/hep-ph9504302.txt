    "the production of hadrons with two heavy constituent quarks of different flavours was the subject of the theoretical studies over two the last years .",
    "the calculations of the @xmath7-meson production cross - section in @xmath8 annihilation at the @xmath9 pole [ 1 - 3 ] show a principal possibility of the ground state observation of the @xmath10 system as well as its higher excitations at lep - i energies .",
    "it is much more possible to observe @xmath7-meson in experiments at the hadronic collider where we can expect [ 4 - 6 ] a large number of events at the available luminosity of the fnal collider .",
    "another aspect of interest to the processes of the heavy quark system production consists in the fact that it offers a possibility to understand the mechanism of the hadronization in the framework of the perturbative qcd with the minimal assumptions concerning wave functions of the bound states .",
    "let us enumerate the main results of the studies of the @xmath10 system production mechanisms in different reactions :    i ) : :    @xmath7-mesons production in @xmath8    annihilation at high energy @xmath11 can be    described in the framework of the fragmentation model with the simple    factorized expression @xmath12 where    @xmath13 , and    @xmath14 is the fragmentation    function of @xmath15 [ 1 - 3 ] .",
    "+    the ratio of the vector @xmath16-meson production    cross - section to that of the pseudoscalar @xmath17 is    @xmath18 instead of    the expected value @xmath19 that one can obtain    counting the quark states .",
    "+    the production of the @xmath20-level states in the    fragmentation model is about by an order of magnitude suppressed with    respect to that for @xmath21-states [ 7 ] .",
    "+    the contribution of the @xmath22-quark fragmentation into the    final cross - section is about two orders of magnitude lower comparing    with that of the @xmath23-quark .",
    "ii ) : :    the production of @xmath24-mesons in the    @xmath25 collisions is described by 20 feynmann    diagrams [ 8 - 10 ] that can be split into three gauge invariant groups    ( 6 + 6 + 8 diagrams , correspondingly ) .",
    "the first two groups describe the    process of the @xmath26 and @xmath27 pairs    production with the subsequent fragmentation into    @xmath7-meson .",
    "the contribution of the    @xmath22-quark fragmentation in @xmath25    collisions is enhanced due to the factor @xmath28 and    ca nt be neglected contrary to the case of @xmath8    annihilation .",
    "+    the contribution of the @xmath29-quark fragmentation can    be sufficiently well described by equation ( 1 ) and the accuracy of    this description increases with the growth of @xmath3 value .",
    "the contribution of the @xmath22-quark fragmentation is in a    quite drastic contradiction with factorized expression ( 1 ) . the main    contribution into @xmath24-meson production at any    @xmath3 comes from the remaining 8 diagrams of the    recombination type .",
    "this results in another value of @xmath30    different from that in @xmath8 annihilation .",
    "iii ) : :    the hadronic production of @xmath7-meson requires the    calculation of the full set of 36 feynmann diagrams of the order of    @xmath1 including fragmentation type diagrams",
    ". the    cross section of the @xmath24 can be then obtained by    the convolution of the gluon - gluon cross - section with the gluon    distribution functions in the initial hadrons .",
    "this leads to the    dominance of the region of small @xmath31 of the    sub - process @xmath32 in the    cross - section of @xmath17 production . just in the same way as    in @xmath25 collisions the recombination type    diagrams dominate in @xmath33 production of    @xmath24 [ 6 ] and , consequently",
    ", the @xmath34    value is close to 3 in the hadronic production as well .",
    "it is obvious that the experimental cuts on @xmath3 values rises up the role of large @xmath35 in the reaction @xmath36 .",
    "in such a case we should expect the increase of the fragmentation mechanism contribution and , consequently , the simplification of all calculations . the calculations at large @xmath3 values have been performed in [ 5,11 ] where the cross - sections of @xmath24-meson production for the fnal tevatron are presented .",
    "the authors of the cited papers used as the fragmentation function for @xmath37 the value obtained in @xmath8 annihilation for the @xmath21 and @xmath20 levels . then , convoluting this fragmentation function with the cross - section of the @xmath26 pair production they calculated the distribution of @xmath24-mesons as the function of @xmath3 . the leading logarithmic correction on the final state gluon radiation",
    "was also taken into account .",
    "in this paper , considering the full set of feynmann diagrams of the order of @xmath1 we will show that the fragmentation approach fails , because not all the diagrams , which ca nt be neglected at large @xmath3 , were taken into account and there was some overestimation of the real phase space",
    ".    we will give a more detailed analysis of the @xmath24 production at large @xmath3 for the energy of the fnal tevatron ( @xmath38 .",
    "it seems obvious at the naive level that the dominating mechanism of the @xmath7-mesons production at large @xmath3 should be connected with the fragmentation of heavy @xmath29-quarks .",
    "the fragmentation approach is based on the assumption that the factorization of the production on the parton @xmath39 production with large energy and its subsequent fragmentation into different @xmath17 states is valid .",
    "the differential cross section @xmath40 , for example , for @xmath41 collision will have the form @xmath42 where @xmath43 are fragmentation functions @xmath44 is @xmath45 pair production cross - section and @xmath46 is parton @xmath47 density function in the hadron @xmath48 .",
    "this approach was used in [ 5,11 ] , where the differential distributions @xmath40 for @xmath0-meson and its @xmath20-wave excitation were calculated .",
    "nevertheless , it remains unclear what is the region where we can use expressions ( 2 ) and what can be the role of other subprocesses .",
    "let us clarify these points in the framework of the same approximation ",
    "the born - level diagrams of the order of @xmath1 [ 6 ] .",
    "the total number of diagrams in the subprocess @xmath36 is 36 and only minor part of them is connected with the @xmath29-quark fragmentation .",
    "we have already showed [ 6 ] that the main contribution into @xmath0-meson production is connected with the diagrams of the recombination type , where both initial gluons dissociate into a pair of heavy quarks and two of these quarks recombine later into @xmath0-meson .",
    "we observed the dominance of such diagrams up to the energies of @xmath33-collisions of the order of 1 tev .",
    "moreover , at the energies @xmath49 gev , that give the main contribution into hadronic production of @xmath0-meson it is rather meaningless to consider the fragmentation mechanism at all , because the condition @xmath50 is not valid and the pre - asymptotic terms in the definition of @xmath51 are large .",
    "so , we can use the fragmentation approach at large values of @xmath31 only , but at large energies the fragmentation contribution is small as compared with that of the whole set of diagrams .    in fig",
    ".  1 we present the results of the exact calculation for the cross - section of the subprocess @xmath52 as a function of c.m.s .",
    "energy in comparison with that calculated in the fragmentation approach ",
    "the cross - section of the @xmath26 pair production multiplied by the probability of the fragmentation @xmath15 and @xmath53 and @xmath54 , correspondingly .",
    "one can see , that in the regions where the condition @xmath55 is valid and expressions ( 2 ) can be used the contribution of the fragmentation is not dominant .",
    "contrary , at small energies it gives overestimated values due to the fact that in the fragmentation calculation one uses two - particle phase space ( @xmath56 ) instead of true three - particle space ( @xmath57 ) in the partonic subprocess .",
    "the same conclusion can be drawn from fig .  2 , where we present the differential cross - sections @xmath40 for @xmath17- and @xmath16-mesons in comparison with the fragmentation mechanism at the energy @xmath58 gev in gluon - gluon collision .",
    "in the case of @xmath17-meson production we observe the saturation of the fragmentation at the values of @xmath59 gev , while in the case of @xmath16-meson this saturation is postponed to the very edge of the phase space ( @xmath60 gev ) .    to stress the problems with the fragmentation picture let us consider the differential cross - section @xmath40 for @xmath17- and @xmath16-mesons at the energy of gluon - gluon collision @xmath61 gev ( fig .  3 )",
    "one can see that incorrect calculation of the phase space leads to the fact that the cross - section calculated by fragmentation expressions ( 1 ) exceeds that obtained from the full set of diagrams .",
    "the conclusion one can draw from the above considerations is quite simple : at the currently reachable @xmath3 the fragmentation approach does not work and all the diagrams contributing into @xmath0 mesons should be considered .",
    "it is important to underline another point .",
    "the full and the fragmentation calculations give different predictions for the ratio of the cross - sections of @xmath17 and @xmath16 productions .",
    "the full calculation gives the value of @xmath19 , while the fragmentation model predicts another value @xmath62 .",
    "in fig .  4 we present the differential cross - section @xmath40 for @xmath17 and @xmath16-mesons calculated from @xmath33 cross - section convoluting it with structure functions of the initial protons for the energy of the fnal tevatron @xmath63 tev ) .",
    "we take the structure functions from [ 12 ] fixing virtuality at the value of @xmath64 gev , because we consider only those born diagrams contributions , which approximately correspond to those virtualities @xmath65 . the running virtuality and",
    "the strong coupling constant can be used when one considers next - order radiative corrections to this process .",
    "two curves in the same figure correspond to the contributions calculated from expression ( 2 ) using fragmentation functions @xmath66 and @xmath67 obtained at the same order of perturbative expansion .",
    "one can see that those curves do not coincide with the exact calculations in the whole interval of @xmath3 . at small values of @xmath3 one",
    "can observe excess of fragmentation predictions , while at large values of @xmath3 they are lower .",
    "taking into account the experimental cuts on the pseudo - rapidity ( @xmath68 ) one can calculate more realistic @xmath3 distribution ( fig .",
    "such a cut reduces the value of cross - section by a factor of 3 .",
    "it is interesting to note that in the @xmath3 interval considered the value @xmath69 is about 3 . taking into account all @xmath21-wave excitations",
    "the cross - section of the @xmath17-meson production @xmath70 with @xmath71 gev is about 3.3  nb that gives for run ib of tevatron with the integrated luminosity @xmath72 about @xmath73-mesons .",
    "there are two different approaches to the calculation of the hadronic production of @xmath7-mesons at present . the first one is based on the calculation of all the diagrams of the order of @xmath1 in the perturbative qcd .",
    "there are three publications with such calculations , which give different predictions for cross - sections [ 4 , 6 , 13 ] . in our previous work [ 6 ] , where we considered the hadronic @xmath7 production ,",
    "we had omitted the color factor @xmath74 in the wave function of @xmath7-meson that increased our prediction by a factor of 3 . correcting this point and using the same constants as in [ 4 ]",
    "we have obtained a good agreement at the level of the @xmath33 cross - sections .",
    "the second approach is based on the usage of the fragmentation model [ 5,11 ] , and , as we have demonstrated above , it gives incorrect description of the cross - section underestimating it at large energies of @xmath33 collisions and overestimating at small values of energies .",
    "so , it looks quite strange that the authors of [ 11 ] when using fragmentation approach and convoluting the resulting expressions with the structure functions have obtained the cross - sections , which are analogous to ours ( see fig .  5 ) .",
    "finally , we would like to note :    1 ) : :    in the case of the states with equal mass heavy quarks ( say ,    @xmath75 production ) the fragmentation approach    @xmath76 does not also describe the exact result    obtained by the calculating of all the diagrams of the order of    @xmath1 .",
    "2 ) : :    when one quark becomes light ( @xmath77 instead of    @xmath22-quark ) in the region of large @xmath3 the    recombination diagrams become dominant .    all these points",
    "we will consider in our next publications .",
