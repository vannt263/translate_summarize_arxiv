    "in this paper we propose a new method for numerically solving the system of equations describing linear elasticity .",
    "the accurate computation of stresses is of critical importance in many applications . yet",
    ", many traditional methods only yield approximations to the displacement .",
    "this means that stress approximations must be recovered afterward by numerical differentiation .",
    "there are newer methods , of the mixed and discontinuous galerkin ( dg ) category , which do give direct stress approximations",
    ". however , their stability properties , as a function of both @xmath0 ( the mesh size ) and @xmath1 ( the polynomial degree of solution approximations ) are presently unknown . in this contribution",
    ", we bring to the table , a method of the novel discontinuous petrov - galerkin ( dpg ) type , which exhibits stability independent of @xmath0 and  @xmath1 .",
    "the new method is the first @xmath2-optimal method for linear elasticity that can simultaneously approximate the stress and the displacement .",
    "we are also able to show , theoretically and practically , that the convergence of the discrete solution does not deteriorate as the poisson ratio approaches @xmath3 , i.e. , the method does not lock .    to understand how the new dpg method sidesteps the traditional difficulties ,",
    "let us review the usual difficulties in designing schemes that give direct stress approximations .",
    "mixed methods  @xcite based on the hellinger - reissner variational principle face the problem of designing an approximation space for stresses consisting of matrix functions that are pointwise symmetric . while this is not difficult in itself ,",
    "when combined with two other additional requirements , difficulties arise .",
    "the first requirement is that forces on a mesh face shared by two mesh elements must be in equilibrium .",
    "the second requirement is that the conforming stress space , together with a space for displacement approximations , form a stable pair . to put this in mathematical terms ,",
    "let @xmath4 denote the space of real @xmath5 matrices and let @xmath6 denote its subspace of symmetric matrices .",
    "the above mentioned stress properties imply that the exact stress @xmath7 on an elastic body occupying @xmath8 lies in the space @xmath9 ( here , the set of functions from @xmath10 into @xmath11 whose components are square integrable on @xmath12 is denoted by @xmath13 , for @xmath14 etc . )",
    "mixed methods must use conforming finite element subspaces of @xmath15 .",
    "although such spaces are known  @xcite , they have too many unknowns ( e.g. , their lowest order space has 162 degrees of freedom on a single tetrahedral element ) .",
    "such rich spaces seem to be necessary to satisfy both the first ( conformity ) and the second ( discrete stability ) requirement .",
    "in contrast , our new dpg methods change the game by separating the approximation and the stability issues .",
    "the dpg method uses a _",
    "weaker _ variational formulation for the same problem . in this formulation",
    ", @xmath7 is sought in the space @xmath16 , in contrast to the space @xmath15 above . since @xmath16 , has no interelement continuity constraints ,",
    "we are able to design an approximating finite element subspace trivially .",
    "furthermore , due to the nonstandard stabilization mechanism of the dpg scheme , the discrete stress space can be chosen to be a subspace of @xmath17 , i.e. , the method gives stresses that are exactly ( point - wise ) symmetric .",
    "one can equally well choose stress approximations in a subspace of @xmath15 , disregarding discrete stability considerations .",
    "the stability of the dpg method is inherited from the well - posedness of the new ultraweak formulation .",
    "of course , it is by no means trivial to prove this well - posedness ( and most of the analysis in this paper is devoted to it ) .",
    "it is provable by adopting a petrov - galerkin framework where trial and test spaces are different . for any given trial space ,",
    "we can locally obtain a test space that is guaranteed to yield stability .",
    "test spaces that guarantee stability can be obtained by following the dpg methodology introduced in  @xcite .",
    "our initial idea was as follows : if one uses dg spaces , then given any test space norm , one can _ locally _ construct test spaces that yield solutions that are the best approximations in a dual norm on the trial space .",
    "this dual norm was called the `` energy norm '' . however , we realized  @xcite that these energy norms are often complicated to work with once we move beyond one - dimensional problems .",
    "but we turned the tables in  @xcite , by showing that given a desirable norm in which one wants the dpg solutions to converge , there is a way to calculate the matching test space norm .",
    "we refer to this norm as the `` optimal norm '' on the test space ( see   [ ssec : optimal ] ) .",
    "the catch is that the optimal norm is nonlocal .",
    "its use would make the computation of a basis for the test space too expensive .",
    "hence , we have been in pursuit of norm equivalences .",
    "if one uses , in place of the optimal norm , an equivalent , but localizable test norm , then the dpg method , instead of delivering the very best approximation , delivers a quasioptimal approximation , i.e. , the discretization error is bounded by a scalar multiple of the best approximation error .",
    "this approach was applied to a one - dimensional wave propagation problem in  @xcite .",
    "a number of further theoretical tools were needed to develop an error analysis for multidimensional problems .",
    "these , in the context of the simple poisson equation , appear in  @xcite . in this paper , we further generalize these tools to the case of the elasticity problem and introduce new tools to prove locking - free estimates .    before we proceed to the details of this dpg method ,",
    "let us mention several alternative solutions to handle the difficulty of constructing approximating subspaces of  .",
    "one approach is to relax the symmetry constraint of stresses by using a lagrange multiplier .",
    "this means that @xmath7 is sought in @xmath18 ( cf .  ) , a space for which finite elements are easier to design .",
    "this avenue gave rise to mixed methods with weakly imposed symmetry  @xcite . yet",
    "another avenue is to keep the stress symmetry , but relax the @xmath19-conformity .",
    "this yielded non - conforming methods , e.g. ,  @xcite .",
    "however , none of these methods have been proved to be @xmath2-optimal .",
    "the closest attempt to an @xmath2-method is  @xcite which studies a variable degree mixed method , but does not show how the error estimates depend on  @xmath1 .",
    "in contrast , we will prove that the ( two ) dpg methods we present in this paper are @xmath2-optimal .",
    "furthermore , since the dpg method can be reinterpreted as a least squares method in a nonstandard inner product , it yields matrix systems that are symmetric and positive definite ( despite having both stress and displacement as unknowns ) .    as mentioned above , there are two new dpg formulations in this paper .",
    "the first is easy to derive and is a natural extension of our work on the poisson equation in  @xcite .",
    "the second differs from the first due to the presence of a scaled lagrange multiplier .",
    "the multiplier serves to obtain the extra stability required to prove the locking - free convergence estimates .    in the next section ,",
    "we introduce the first dpg method .",
    "we also state the main convergence result for the first method . the second method and its convergence result",
    "is presented in section  [ sec : second ] .",
    "then , in section  [ sec : relation ] , we study the relationship between these two methods , discovering when they are equivalent .",
    "the proofs of the above mentioned two convergence theorems appear in section  [ sec : anl ] . as corollaries to these convergence theorems , we obtain @xmath0 and @xmath1 convergence rates in section  [ sec : rates ] . in appendix",
    "[ sec : weakly - symm ] , we present a result on a mixed method that we crucially use in our proofs .",
    "in this section , we present the derivation of the first of our two dpg methods for linear elasticity .",
    "we also state a convergence theorem , which will be proved in a later section .",
    "linear elasticity is described by two equations .",
    "the first is the constitutive equation    [ eq : bvp ] @xmath20 these equations are imposed on a domain @xmath8 and the space dimension @xmath21 equals @xmath22 or @xmath23 .",
    "we assume that @xmath12 is a bounded open subset of @xmath24 with connected lipschitz boundary .",
    "the stress @xmath25 is a function taking values in @xmath6 and its divergence ( @xmath26 ) is taken row - wise .",
    "the strain tensor is denoted by @xmath27 where the prime ( @xmath28 ) denotes matrix transpose , and @xmath29 .",

    "the vector function @xmath32 denotes the displacement field engendered by the body force @xmath33 .",
    "we consider the simple boundary condition @xmath34    which signifies that the elastic body is clamped on the boundary @xmath35 .",

    "we now sum up the equations of   element by element to obtain    [ eq:2 ] @xmath49    here , we have additionally imposed the symmetry of the stress tensor by the last equation ( where @xmath50 is a skew - symmetric matrix valued test function on @xmath10 ) and used the following notations : @xmath51 the notation @xmath52 is used for the collection @xmath53 .",

    "since the stress variables are in @xmath458 , we expect that the best approximation error for stress should decrease at rate @xmath463 , or @xmath464 .",
    "this is in agreement with figure  [ fig : ureflshape : h ] .",
    "additionally , since displacement is in @xmath459 , one might think that its best approximation error should decrease more or less at rate @xmath465 , or @xmath466 .",
    "however in the dpg method the errors for both these variables are coupled together .",
    "so , while we observe the optimal convergence rate for the stress variable , the convergence rate for the displacement seems to be somehow limited by the convergence rate of the stress . for uniform @xmath1-refinements , because we are considering a singular solution , the convergence rate is limited by the regularity of the solution , so unlike figure  [ fig : urefsmooth : p ] , no exponential convergence is observed in figure  [ fig : ureflshape : p ] .",
    "the smooth solution problem was also implemented using the weakly symmetric mixed element given in  @xcite .",
    "this mixed method uses polynomials of degree one higher than our dpg method for the stress trial space .",
    "expectedly therefore , the stress approximations given by the mixed method were generally observed to be superior in the @xmath388 norm . for the displacement",
    "however , both methods use the same space , so it is interesting to compare the displacement errors .",
    "this is done in figure  [ fig : compare ] .",
    "the dpg method delivers lower displacement errors in the higher order case . in the lowest order case ( not shown in the figure )",
    "the mixed method performs slightly better .      in figure",
    "[ fig : lock ] we show numerical evidence of the locking - free property of the dpg method .",
    "the figure shows convergence curves for various values of poisson ratio close to the limiting value of @xmath3 .",
    "we used piecewise bilinear elements with homogeneous material data .",
    "the convergence curves in figure  [ fig : lock1 ] show hardly any difference as @xmath467 approaches @xmath3 .",
    "to be clearer , we also plot the ratio of the @xmath388 discretization error to the best approximation error ( in @xmath7 and @xmath55 combined ) in figure  [ fig : lock2 ] .",
    "we see that the ratio remains close to the optimal value of @xmath468 even as @xmath467 approaches @xmath3 .",
    "all our adaptive schemes are based on the `` greedy '' strategy described in  @xcite .",
    "this means that all elements which contribute @xmath469 of the maximum element error to the previously described error representation function are marked for refinement . for @xmath2-adaptivity",
    ", we used the strategy suggested in  @xcite ,",
    "i.e. , if an element contains the singularity , it is @xmath0-refined , otherwise it is @xmath1-refined .",
    "figure  [ fig : adapt ] shows results from both adaptivity schemes .",
    "note that a nearly optimal rate of @xmath470is observed for the @xmath0-adaptivity scheme .",
    "the @xmath2-adaptive scheme results in an optimal rate of @xmath471 . finally , figure  [ fig : mesh ] shows the @xmath2 mesh obtained after 12 iterations and figure  [ fig : sol : ux ] shows one component of the corresponding solution .",
    "the group relative @xmath388 error is reduced to @xmath472 .",
    "figure  [ fig : approx ] shows the effect of @xmath426 as seen in the @xmath0-adaptive process for the l - shaped domain problem .",
    "this measures the effect of approximating optimal test functions using the operator @xmath429 as opposed to @xmath146 , since the curves for @xmath473 are coincident , it appears that we are sufficiently approximating the optimal test functions .",
    "we consider a mixed method for linear elasticity with weakly imposed stress symmetry .",
    "the method we consider differs from a standard method  @xcite only in that it has an extra lagrange multiplier .",
    "it is well known that the mixed formulation does not lock  ( see e.g.,@xcite ) for homogeneous isotropic material parameters . in this appendix",
    ", we will provide a stability result for slightly more general materials .",
    "note however , that the main goal of this appendix is to establish stability estimates for the mixed method in the form needed for the analysis of the dpg scheme in the earlier sections .            1 .",
    "problem   is uniquely solvable and the solution component @xmath55 is in fact in  @xmath478 .",
    "2 .   there is a positive constant @xmath479 such that @xmath480 3 .",

    ",  we have @xmath494 setting @xmath495 , the lemma is proved .",
