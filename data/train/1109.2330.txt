    "in quantum cryptography unconditional security proofs are derived under the assumption that alice s and bob s apparata ( private spaces ) are completely inaccessible by an eavesdropper who , therefore , can only attack the signal systems which are transmitted through the quantum communication channel connecting the two parties . under this assumption ,",
    "secret - key rates and security thresholds are derived in both discrete and continuous variable quantum key distribution .",
    "one potential loophole in the security proofs is related to how a theoretical protocol is actually implemented experimentally .",
    "any redundant information encoded in extra degrees of freedom or extra hilbert space dimensions outside the theoretical prescription can allow for so - called side - channel attacks",
    ". by their nature , such attacks may be of classical or quantum degrees of freedom and are insidious because even quantifying their threat appears to involve understanding what have been called unknown unknowns about the vulnerability of the experimental set - up .",
    "progress has been made on eliminating side - channel attacks in the quantum communication channels between private spaces , but this leaves open potential attacks on the private spaces through their quantum communication ports .",
    "let us therefore take a step back and consider private spaces in more detail : what goes on in alice s and bob s private spaces involves a significant amount of classical information processing ; at the very least the key itself will be generated and stored as classical information .",
    "now with virtually any technology we have today classical information is stored , processed and transmitted in a highly redundant fashion ( many electrons are used to charge a capacitor to represent a bit value , or many electrons must pass through the base junction of a transistor to effect a logical switching operation , tapping on a keyboard produces sound waves and electromagnetic signals in addition to the ` legitimate ' electrical signals in the wires , etc ) . in principle",
    "any of this redundant information may leak out of the private space through a parasite  channel .",
    "an eavesdropper might therefore ignore the quantum communication channel and directly attack alice s and bob s apparata by exploiting the presence of parasite channels : this is also a side - channel attack .",
    "the implicit assumption in quantum cryptography is that we could always improve technology in such a way that alice s and bob s private spaces are not affected by the presence of parasite channels , so that the legitimate participants do indeed have access to absolutely private spaces .",
    "( for instance , alice and bob could simulate the classical information processing on a quantum computer .",
    "a hacked operating system on such a machine could be tested for by randomly running subroutines that confirm that coherence is preserved and that no information is copied out to where it can be stored or transmitted by a trojan program  see also ref .",
    "however , even if you rely on a perfect isolation technology , there remains a potential chink in this armor , which is the quantum communication port used either to transmit a quantum state out of your private space or to accept a quantum state for detection into it .",
    "if you open a communication port for quantum states to enter or leave you must explicitly deal with side channels which can be probing these links to your private space .",
    "eve can potentially send trojan systems through alice s and bob s communication ports and detect their reflection to infer both state preparation and measurement settings . as an example , in the standard bb84 protocol , eve can irradiate alice s apparatus by using optical modes at slightly different frequencies . then , from reflection , eve can infer the polarization chosen in each round of the protocol .",
    "thanks to this information , eve can measure each signal system in the correct basis .",
    "another example regards the so - called plug - and - play systems , where trojan systems can be reflected together with signal systems , as discussed in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "our paper shows how to overcome the problem of the open quantum communication ports , therefore making feasible the notion of absolutely private spaces .",
    "note that this problem is not addressed by current device - independent quantum cryptography , where such attacks on the private space ports are simply considered illegitimate as they violate the strong private space assumption .",
    "the key point of our scheme is that detectors are no longer in line  with the quantum communication port of the private space .",
    "for this reason , it is not possible for an external party to probe the port and obtain detector settings or readouts from the processing of parasite systems . in order to explain this key feature in detail",
    ", we analyze the problem of the quantum communication ports by comparing standard protocols with our scheme .    in fig .",

    "eve can retrieve information about the state preparation @xmath109 . by means of @xmath108",
    ", she can retrieve information about the measurement apparatus of bob and , therefore , about @xmath40 .        in fig .",
    "[ ex2 ] , we depict a general entanglement - based protocol , where an untrusted party ( eve ) distributes entanglement between two parties .",
    "this is done by distributing an entangled state @xmath110 , where system @xmath50 is sent to alice and system @xmath60 is sent to bob .",
    "alice and bob can perform entanglement distillation and measure the output distilled systems to derive two correlated classical variables , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , respectively . in this scenario ,",
    "eve can decide not to attack the source @xmath2 but directly the two quantum communication ports of alice and bob .",
    "eve can probe these ports by using two trojan systems @xmath44 and @xmath108 , which can retrieve information about alice s and bob s distilling and detecting apparata . as a result ,",
    "eve can infer information about @xmath39 and @xmath40 .        in fig .",
    "[ ex3 ] , we depict our protocol where an untrusted party ( eve ) represents an entanglement swapper between alice and bob .",
    "this is generally done by measuring two _ public _",
    "systems , @xmath111 and @xmath112 , received from alice and bob , processing the outcome of the measurement , and classically communicating the processed data back to alice and bob . as a result",
    "the two private systems , @xmath50 and @xmath60 , become correlated , so that alice and  bob can extract two correlated classical variables , @xmath39 and @xmath40 , by applying suitable measurements . in particular ,",
    "if alice and bob can access quantum memories , then they can extract a secret key at a rate which is at least equal to the coherent information between @xmath50 and @xmath60 .",
    "eve can attempt a side - channel attack against the two ports by sending two trojan systems @xmath44 and @xmath108 . in this case , however , the apparata which detect the two private systems @xmath50 and @xmath60 are inaccessible to eve . by exploiting reflections from the ports , eve can only retrieve information regarding the reduced states @xmath113 and @xmath114 of the two public systems @xmath111 and @xmath112 .",
    "however , these reduced states contain no useful information about the private system @xmath50 or @xmath60 or alice s or bob s detector settings or outputs .",
    "to understand better how the full isolation of the private systems might be achieved , we may consider the procedure depicted in fig .",
    "[ ports ] .",
    "it is explained for alice s private space , but steps are identical for bob .                in the first step ( a ) ,",
    "alice s port is closed and she prepares an entangled state @xmath115 where system @xmath50 is directed towards a quantum memory ( qm ) , while system @xmath111 is directed towards a delay line ( dl ) . in step ( b ) , once system @xmath50 is stored in the memory and while system @xmath111 is trapped in the delay line , a shutter is used to fully separate the delay line from the rest of alice s apparatus .",
    "note that a virtual channel between @xmath50 and @xmath111 has been created . in step ( c ) ,",
    "alice s quantum communication port is opened and system @xmath111 is transmitted to eve . during this stage , trojan systems may enter the port but no detector is in line with the port . in step ( d ) , the port is closed with the private system @xmath50 kept in the memory . the previous steps ( a)-(d )",
    "are repeated many times , so that alice collects many private systems in her quantum memory .",
    "we therefore reach step ( e ) of the figure .",
    "finally , once alice has received all the classical communications , she applies a collective quantum measurement on her quantum memory to retrieve the classical variable @xmath39 .",
    "this measurement can include or be anticipated by an entanglement distillation .",
    "in part of the derivation we adopt the enlarged hilbert space ( ehs ) representation , where stochastic classical variables are embedded in quantum systems . consider a stochastic variable @xmath55 which is encoded into an ensemble of states of some quantum system @xmath50 , i.e. , @xmath116 this ensemble may be equivalently represented by the classical - quantum ( cq ) state @xmath117 where the stochastic variable @xmath39 is embedded into the dummy quantum system @xmath118 , by using an orthonormal basis @xmath119 in the hilbert space @xmath120 of @xmath118 .",

    "<S> finally , an external untrusted party performs a suitable locc ( such as a bell - state measurement ) to create correlations necessary for shared key generation .    </S>",

    "<S> @xcite , a very strong conjecture is made explicitly for the middle eavesdropper , who is always assumed to perform a bell measurement . </S>",
    "<S> thus , in practice , the third party can not be regarded as an eavesdropper ( eve ) but more correctly as a trusted party ( charlie ) . </S>",
