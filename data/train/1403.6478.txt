    "topologically ordered phases with abelian anyons are usually considered to be the simplest examples of topological order ( to ) , however recent exciting work has shown that the theory is still far from complete .",
    "two notable developments related to our current work are : ( i ) the generation of semi - classical defects in abelian topological phases that exhibit similar features to non - abelian quasiparticles@xcite and ( ii ) the bulk - boundary correspondence for topological phases with and without symmetry protection , and the resulting stability of the gapless edge theories  @xcite . some aspects of these two lines of research can be unified by applying the concept of _ anyonic _ symmetry ( as ) . to phases support an additional as structure if the quasiparticle ( qp ) fusion and braiding are invariant under a set of anyon relabeling operations .",
    "this is a common feature in many topological states , such the kitaev toric code  @xcite which has an electromagnetic - duality , and the abelian @xmath1-fractional quantum hall ( fqh ) states  @xcite which have a bi - layer symmetry .",
    "an element of the as group might , for example , switch a particular anyon - type between the two layers in bi - layer fqh states .",
    "the as is not necessarily a symmetry of the quantum hamiltonian , but rather a symmetry of the anyon content .",
    "for example , an as could permute qp excitations with different energies . in general , a ground state in a closed system will not be invariant under an as operation , and therefore the symmetry can be regarded as being _ weakly _ broken  @xcite . however , unlike a classical symmetry - broken phase , the as may not be associated with a physical quantity , and can not be measured by a finite vacuum expectation value of any local observable .    in this work",
    "we construct a class of abelian bosonic fqh states associated with elements of the @xmath0 cartan classification of lie - algebras and show that they have as . for these systems",
    "the as can be used to create non - abelian _ twist defects _ and topologically distinct gapped edge , or interface phases .",
    "in addition we can apply our result to predict when edge theories of certain time - reversal invariant fractional quantum spin hall states ( fqsh ) made from time - reversed copies of the @xmath0 fqh states can be gapped without breaking symmetries .",
    "one remarkable result we find is an exact mapping between the well - known _ triality _ symmetry of the lie algebra @xmath2 and the as of the associated topological state .",
    "in fact , we prove that the as for these theories are exactly the symmetries of the dynkin diagrams that represent the ade lie algebras .",
    "this is not only applicable to a 2d fqh state that carries an @xmath2 edge algebra , but also the spin liquid surface state of a three dimensional bosonic symmetry protected phase  @xcite .",
    "to begin , we need to introduce the well - known @xmath3-matrix formalism for abelian to states .",
    "an abelian fqh state is described by an effective chern - simons topological field theory @xmath4 in @xmath5 dimensions , where @xmath6 is an @xmath7-component set of @xmath8 gauge fields .",
    "the topological state is characterized by the symmetric , integral - valued @xmath3-matrix  @xcite .",
    "qp excitations of the theory are labeled as @xmath7-component vectors ( @xmath9 ) in an integer ( anyon ) lattice @xmath10 vector addition corresponds to qp fusion @xmath11 .",
    "the spin @xmath12 of a qp @xmath13 is given by @xmath14 .",
    "the topological spin ( or exchange statistics ) of a qp @xmath13 is given by @xmath15 , and encircling a qp @xmath13 once around another qp @xmath16 gives the braiding phase @xmath17 , for @xmath18 .",
    "the topological spin of the quasiparticles is often stated in terms of the @xmath19 matrix , @xmath20 .",
    "we note that for completely chiral theories , ( using bulk boundary correspondence ) the spin @xmath12 is the same as the scaling dimension of the primary fields(corresponding to the quasiparticles ) of the ( 1 + 1-d ) conformatl field theory ( cft ) on the edge .",
    "the qps that occupy the sublattice @xmath21 are called _ local _ and only contribute trivial braiding phases with all other qps .",
    "intuitively they are the fundamental building blocks that are  fractionalized \" to form the topological state ; we will enforce that all local particles be bosonic by requiring the diagonal entries of @xmath3 be even .",
    "topological information encoded in the nonlocal braiding and exchange statistics of fractionalized qps is left invariant upon the addition of local particles @xmath22 .",
    "we can remove this redundancy by labeling distinct qps with elements of the anyon quotient lattice @xmath23 .",
    "qps are electromagnetically charged in the presence of the additional coupling term @xmath24 where @xmath25 is the external electromagnetic gauge field and @xmath26 is the unit charge of the fundamental local boson .",
    "we will assume a symmetric coupling @xmath27 which , for example , is the natural choice in multi - layer systems .",
    "the charge of a qp @xmath13 is @xmath28 .",
    "at zero temperature , the ground state is a bose - einstein condensate of local bosons with broken @xmath8 symmetry / number conservation .",
    "physically , the boson condensate could describe an _ anyonic superconductor _",
    "@xcite where local particles are cooper pairs of electrons or perhaps a strongly correlated cold atomic system .",
    "qps that differ by local bosons are indistinguishable and interchangeable up to the boson condensate vacuum .",
    "thus , due to the boson condensate , the qp charges @xmath29 are only defined modulo integral units of @xmath26 at zero temperature .",
    "this motivates an intuitive way to think about the anyon quotient lattice as @xmath30 , i.e. , the anyons are only defined modulo the local bosons that make up the lattice @xmath31    we are interested in abelian topological states which carry chiral kac - moody ( km ) current algebras at level 1 along their edges .",
    "these include a range of fqh states under the cartan @xmath0 classification of simply - laced lie algebras  @xcite .",
    "the set of @xmath32 and @xmath33 form infinite sequences while there are only three exceptional @xmath34 . in this article",
    ", we consider abelian topological states where the @xmath3-matrix is given by the cartan matrix of a corresponding ( simply - laced ) lie algebra ( which has rank @xmath7 ) .",
    "we will henceforth refer to these models as @xmath0 states since the lie algebras with symmetric cartan matrices that are suitable to form k - matrices are the @xmath35 and @xmath36 series from the cartan classification of lie algebras .",
    "this construction ensures the presence of a kac - moody algebra corresponding to the same lie algebra at level @xmath37 at the edge of the system , and that the modular @xmath38 matrix of the bulk topological state is the same as that of the corresponding affine lie algebra at level @xmath37.@xcite strictly speaking , the presence of a sector whose @xmath3 ( sub-)matrix is identical to the cartan matrix of the lie algebra ( i.e. we can identify a sub - matrix of the full @xmath3-matrix which is the cartan matrix of the lie algebra ) is enough to define a set of currents which obey kac - moody algebra at level @xmath37 at its edge .",
    "examples of such @xmath3-matrices are given in eqs .",
    ". however , we will not explicitly deal with such states in this manuscript .",
    "in the remainder of this section we will motivate the reasons for studying the @xmath0 fractional quantum hall states .",
    "in fact , these fractional quantum hall states are relevant to several important lines of research .",
    "the importance of the states in the @xmath25 series for the study of fqh hierarchy states has already been pointed out in a series of papers as early as ref . and the structure was further clarified by @xcite .",
    "this is particularly relevant for the hierarchy states at filling fractions @xmath39 with symmetry @xmath40 @xcite , where @xmath41 is an even positive integer .",
    "the factor of @xmath42 is exactly the symmetry of the @xmath25 series of lie algebras .    as an example , the second hierarchy state at filling fraction @xmath43 has @xmath44 with charge vector @xmath45 and symmetry @xmath46 .",
    "the third hierarchy state at filling fraction @xmath47 has symmetry @xmath48 , k matrix @xmath49 and a charge vector @xmath50 the general structure in these cases follows this basic pattern .",
    "we also note that laughlin states are _ stably _ equivalent to @xmath51 states in the @xmath25 series as was explicitly noted for the @xmath52 state in ref . .",
    "in our work we will not focus on the hierarchy states because these have an extra fermionic @xmath53 ( charge ) sector which complicates the anyonic symmetry analysis to follow .",
    "we instead present the bosonic case first and then discuss the strategy to solve the fermionic problem in future work .    beyond their relevance for hierarchy states ,",
    "the @xmath0 states have also been featured in the recent discussion of topologically ordered and symmetry protected topological states .",
    "for example , the @xmath54 state has been in focus because it is a bosonic short range entangled phase with no topological order@xcite .",
    "the @xmath2 state , which lies in the @xmath55 series , exists on the surface of a 3d bulk symmetry protected topological(spt ) phase protected by time reversal symmetry@xcite .",
    "as we will soon show , the @xmath2 state has very special properties in the context of anyonic symmetry that could be probed if such a bulk 3d topological phase were discovered .",
    "additionally , as mentioned further below , the @xmath55 series forms half of the sixteen - fold classification scheme first predicted by kitaev for 2d topologically ordered states@xcite , and further considered in recent work on interacting 2d@xcite and 3d topological phases@xcite .    from a mindset of pure convenience",
    ", the @xmath0 states also have the advantage that their anyonic symmetries can be fully classified using powerful results from the mathematics of lie algebras as we will see , whereas identifying the exact anyonic symmetry group is still an open problem for states with generic @xmath3-matrices / anyon lattices . with these motivations in mind",
    "we will now proceed to the discussion of anyonic symmetry and its consequences .",
    "throughout this article we will use two explicit examples of ade states to illustrate our results : @xmath56 and @xmath57 which are described by @xmath58,\\quad k_{so(8)}=\\left[\\begin{array}{*{20}c}2&-1&-1&-1\\\\-1&2&0&0\\\\-1&0&2&0\\\\-1&0&0&2\\end{array}\\right].\\label{kmatricesa2d4}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the @xmath59 state has 3 qps : @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 , which form the anyon quotient lattice @xmath63 with fusion @xmath64 and @xmath65 up to local bosons .",

    "the discussion henceforth will be limited to simply laced lie algebras with symmetric cartan matrices .",

    "before we carry on , we note that the the automorphisms preserve the dynkin diagrams and the cartan matrix .",

    "the anyons live in the _ weight _ space .",
    "each node of the dynkin diagram can be associated with a corresponding fundamental weight .",
    "the @xmath150-th node will have dynkin label @xmath151 with @xmath37 in the @xmath150-th entry .",
    "thus inner automorphisms act trivially in the weight space , thus preserving the weight labels(up to roots ) whereas outer automorphisms act non trivially on the weight space rotating distinct weights ( anyons ) into each other .",
    "this can help one understand the definition of inner automorphism in the context of anyons .",

    "now let us consider an example in particular : @xmath155 .",
    "we have already seen explicit realization of the automorphism group of @xmath59 in appendix [ sec : autsu3 ] .",

    "hence , the roots obey @xmath159 these roots correspond to local particles . on the other hand",
    "the weights correspond to the anyon labels @xmath160 and @xmath161 .",
    "now we explicitly examine the action of the inner and aouter automorphisms on the roots and the weights to reinforce the statements made above .    as shown in appendix [",
