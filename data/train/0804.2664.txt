    "a topological insulator is a material with a bulk electronic excitation gap generated by the spin orbit interaction , which is topologically distinct from an ordinary insulator @xcite .",
    "this distinction , characterized by a @xmath3 topological invariant , necessitates the existence of gapless electronic states on the sample boundary . in two dimensions ,",
    "the topological insulator is a quantum spin hall insulator@xcite , which is a close cousin of the integer quantum hall state .",
    "the edge states predicted for this phase have recently been observed in transport experiments on hgcdte quantum wells@xcite . in three dimensions",
    "there are four @xmath3 invariants characterizing a time reversal invariant band structure@xcite .",
    "one of these distinguishes a strong topological insulator , which is robust in the presence of disorder .",
    "the strong topological insulator is predicted to have surface states whose fermi surface encloses an odd number of dirac points and is associated with a berry s phase of @xmath7 .",
    "this defines a topological metal surface phase , which is predicted to have novel electronic properties@xcite    in ref .",
    "we predicted that the semiconducting alloy bi@xmath0 sb@xmath1 is a strong topological insulator using a general argument based on the inversion symmetry of bulk crystalline bi and sb .",
    "the surface states of bi have been studied for several years .",
    "experimentally there are several photoemission studies of bi crystals and films which have probed the surface states @xcite .",
    "there are fewer studies of bi@xmath0 sb@xmath1@xcite , but in very recent work , hsieh et al .",
    "@xcite have mapped the ( 111 ) surface states , and verified the topological structure predicted for a strong topological insulator .",
    "first principles calculations provide a clear picture of the surface state structure of bi@xcite , which captures many of the experimental features , including their spin structure@xcite . for the alloy , bi@xmath0 sb@xmath1 ,",
    "one expects the surface states to evolve smoothly from bi , at least for small @xmath8 .",
    "the alloy presents two difficulties for these calculations , though .",
    "first , since these calculations must be done on relatively thin slabs , features near the small band gap are inaccessible because finite size quantization mixes the bulk and surface states .",
    "moreover , describing the alloy would require some kind of mean field treatment of the substitutional disorder .",
    "in this paper we study the surface states of bi@xmath0 sb@xmath1 first by developing a phenomenological tight binding model which can be solved numerically and then by developing general arguments that exploit spatial symmetries and explain a number of model independent features of the surface states .",
    "our phenomenological tight binding model is based on an interpolation of a model developed by liu and allen@xcite .",
    "this model has the advantage that it can be solved in a semi infinite geometry , which allows the surface state features near the small band gap to be calculated .",
    "our aim is not to perform a quantitatively accurate calculation of the surface states , but rather to provide a concrete calculation in which robust , model independent features of the surface states can be identified and characterized . here",
    "we list our main conclusions :    \\(1 ) we find that the fermi surface of the 111 surface of bi@xmath0 sb@xmath1 consists of an electron pocket centered around the @xmath9 point and six elliptical hole pockets centered a point in between @xmath9 and the @xmath10 point .",
    "( here the bar refers to symmetry points in the 111 surface brillouin zone ) .",
    "this is similar to the surface states in bi . unlike the alloy , however , bi has bulk states at the fermi energy : hole states near @xmath9 and electron states near @xmath10 .",
    "this calculation verifies the topological structure of the surface states predicted in ref . .",
    "in that work we showed that the four @xmath3 invariants @xmath11 characterizing the valence bands of pure bi and sb are @xmath12 and @xmath2 respectively .",
    "the semiconducting alloy bi@xmath0 sb@xmath1 was argued to be in the same class as sb , which is a strong topological insulator .",
    "these invariants determine the number of surface bands crossing the fermi energy modulo 2 between each pair of time reversal invariant momenta ( trim ) in the surface brillouin zone .",
    "specifically , it predicts that for the 111 surface an odd number of fermi surface lines separate the @xmath9 point from the three equivalent @xmath10 points .",
    "this is consistent with both our calculation and with experiment@xcite .",
    "\\(2 ) we will show that for crystals with inversion symmetry there is additional topological structure in the bulk band structure , which further constrains the surface band structure . at each of the 8 trim , @xmath13 in the bulk brillioun zone",
    ", the product of the parity eigenvalues of the occupied bands defines a _ parity invariant _ @xmath14 , which is a topological invariant in the space of inversion symmetric hamiltonians .",
    "the four @xmath3 invariants , which require only time reversal symmetry are determined by these 8 signs , and determine the number of fermi surface lines separating two surface trim .",
    "they do not , however , specify which of the trim are _ inside _ of the surface fermi surface and which are _",
    "outside_. we will show that the bulk parity invariants @xmath14 provide that information .    specifically , for each surface trim we will define the _ surface fermion parity _ as the parity of the number of fermi lines that enclose that trim .",
    "this distinguishes the trim that are outside the fermi surface from those that are inside a ( single ) electron or hole pocket . for a crystal terminated on an inversion plane",
    "we will establish a theorem which relates the surface fermion parity to the bulk parity invariants .",
    "thus , for inversion symmetric crystals , the 8 bulk parity invariants provide _ more _ information about the surface states than just the four @xmath3 invariants . we will give a simple proof of this theorem in appendix a , which establishes a more direct connection between the bulk parity eigenvalues and the surface state structure than that presented in ref . .",
    "for the 111 surface of bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 our general theorem is consistent with both our surface state calculation and with experiment .",
    "we will also apply this result to make predictions about the other surfaces of bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "in addition , our theorem has implications for inversion symmetric crystals which are ordinary insulators .",
    "in particular , we will show that it has non trivial implications for the surface states of pure bi , whose valence band is in the trivial @xmath12 topological class .",
    "\\(3 ) in addition to inversion symmetry , the crystal lattices of bi and sb have a mirror symmetry .",
    "we will show that the presence of mirror symmetry leads to a further topological classification of the bulk band structure in terms of an integer , @xmath4 , which we refer to as a _ mirror chern number_. this integer is similar to the spin chern number , which occurs in the quantum spin hall effect when spin is conserved@xcite , and its parity is related to the @xmath3 invariant@xcite . the valence band of pure bi , which has the ( 0;000 ) @xmath3 class@xcite , has @xmath15 .",
    "the semiconducting alloy is a topological insulator with @xmath3 class @xmath2 .",
    "there are two possibilities for the mirror chern number @xmath16 , however , which correspond to topologically distinct phases .",
    "we will show that the sign of @xmath4 in the topological insulator phase further constrains the behavior of the surface states .",
    "the transition between the @xmath12 and @xmath2 classes in bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 occurs for small @xmath17 because pure bi is very close to a band inversion transition where the @xmath18 valence band and @xmath19 conduction band cross .",
    "the @xmath20 theory of these states has been studied extensively in the literature @xcite and has the form of a nearly massless _ three dimensional _ dirac point .",
    "we will show that the _ change _ @xmath21 in the mirror chern number at the band inversion transition is determined by a previously unexplored parameter in that theory : a sign @xmath22 which we will refer to as the _ mirror chirality_. @xmath6 is related to the sign of the @xmath23 factor , which relates the magnetic moment to the angular momentum in a particular direction .",
    "for @xmath24 the @xmath23 factor is like that of a free electron , while for @xmath25 it is anomalous .",
    "we will use this result to interpret our surface state calculation and to provide guidance for how @xmath6 can be measured .",
    "in addition to the dirac point enclosed by the surface fermi surface at @xmath9 , our tight binding surface band calculations for both pure bi and bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 predict that the 6 hole pockets also enclose dirac points which reside at points along the line between @xmath26 and @xmath10 . unlike the dirac points at the surface trim , the degeneracy at these dirac points is not protected by time reversal symmetry , but rather by mirror symmetry .",
    "this prediction is inconsistent with first principles calculations of the surface states in bi@xcite , which do not find a band crossing inside the hole pocket .",
    "since the dirac point occurs above the fermi energy arpes experiments do not directly probe this issue .",
    "nonetheless , spin resolved arpes experiments on bi provide evidence that the surface band structure is consistent with the first principles calculations@xcite .",
    "we will show that this inconsistency can be traced to the mirror chirality and the mirror chern number .",
    "the mirror chirality in the topological insulator phase of bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 can be determined from the structure of the @xmath5 perturbation theory of the energy bands in the vicinity of the @xmath27 point in pure bi .",
    "we find the liu - allen model predicts that @xmath28 .",
    "this value implies that the surface state bands in the alloy cross in such a way as to establish the presence of the dirac points in the hole pockets in agreement with our surface state calculation .",
    "in contrast , we find that an earlier , but more fundamental pseudopotential calculation by golin@xcite predicts that @xmath29 .",
    "this value predicts that the bands do not cross , and that there are no extra dirac points , which is consistent with the presently available experimental results as well as first principles calculations@xcite .",
    "the liu allen tight binding parameters were chosen to reproduce the _ energy _ of the bands computed using first principles calculations , incorporating available experimental constraints .",
    "therefore , there is no reason to expect that it gets @xmath4 right .",
    "we conclude that the inconsistency in our surface state calculation is an artifact of the liu allen tight binding model , which culd be corrected with a suitable choice of new parameters .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section",
    "ii we will review the salient features of bulk bi@xmath0 sb@xmath1 and describe our phenomenological tight binding model . in section",
    "iii we will describe our surface state calculations for bi@xmath0 sb@xmath1 . in section iv we will establish the relationship between the surface fermion parity and the bulk parity eigenvalues and use that result to analyze the surfaces of bi@xmath0 sb@xmath1 . in section v we will discuss the mirror chern number , and show it is related to the mirror chirality of the @xmath5 theory of pure bi . in section",
    "vi we will conclude with a discussion of the relevance of our results to existing and future experiments .",
    "finally , in appendix a we provide a simple proof of the theorem relating the surface fermion parity to the bulk parity eigenvalues .",
    "bismuth and antimony are group v semimetals .",
    "they have the rhombohedral a7 structure shown in fig . [ crystal](a ) , which can be viewed as a distorted simple cubic lattice in which the triangular ( 111 ) lattice planes ( which we will refer to as monolayers )",
    "are paired to form bilayers .",
    "the trivalent @xmath30 atoms tend to form strong covalent bonds directed to the three nearest neighbors within a bilayer .",
    "different bilayers are more weakly coupled .",
    "the primitive unit cell consists of two atoms in different monolayers , and each bilayer has a structure similar to a honeycomb lattice . the brillouin zone for this lattice is shown in fig .",
    "[ crystal](b ) .",
    "it contains 8 special points which are invariant under inversion and time reversal , denoted by @xmath31 , @xmath32 and 3 equivalent @xmath27 and @xmath33 points .",
    "both bi and sb have a finite direct energy gap throughout the brillouin zone , but they have a negative indirect gap . in bi the conduction band minimum at @xmath27 is below the valence band maximum at @xmath32 , which gives rise to an anisotropic hole pocket and three electron pockets with small effective masses@xcite . at @xmath27 the conduction band minimum , which has even parity @xmath18 symmetry , nearly touches the valence band maximum , with odd parity @xmath19 symmetry , forming a three dimensional dirac point with a small mass gap @xmath34 mev . in sb ,",
    "the conduction band minimum at @xmath27 has @xmath19 symmetry , and is below the valence band maximum at the lower symmetry @xmath35 point .",
    "the alloy bi@xmath0 sb@xmath1 retains the rhombohedral a7 crystal structure .",
    "the evolution of its band structure has been studied experimentally @xcite . as @xmath8",
    "is increased from zero two things happen .",
    "first , the small gap at @xmath27 closes and then reopens .",
    "the @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands switch places , and the mass of the three dimensional dirac point changes sign .",
    "second , the top of the valence band at @xmath32 descends below the bottom of the conduction band , resulting in a semimetal - semiconductor transition .",
    "for @xmath36 the alloy is a direct gap semiconductor a gap of order 30 mev at the l points .",
    "time reversal invariant band structures are classified topologically by four @xmath3 invariants @xcite . in ref .",
    "we exploited inversion symmetry to show that these four invariants can be determined by the parity @xmath37 of the occupied bands at the 8 trim @xmath13 , via the quantities @xmath38 which we will refer to as _",
    "parity invariants_. here the product includes each kramers pair ( which satisfy @xmath39 ) only once . for an inversion symmetric",
    "crystal , all 8 of the parity invariants are topological invariants in the following sense .",
    "if the crystal hamiltonian is smoothly deformed , _ preserving the inversion symmetry _ , then the only way any of the @xmath14 s can change is if the gap at @xmath13 goes to zero , so that states with opposite parity can be exchanged between the conduction and valence band .",
    "if inversion symmetry is relaxed , then the 8 invariants lose their meaning .",
    "however , in ref .",
    "we showed that provided _ time reversal symmetry _ is preserved four combinations of the @xmath14 remain robust and define the four @xmath3 invariants denoted by @xmath11 .",

    "based on this data we display @xmath14 in table [ deltatab ] , along with the predicted @xmath3 invariants for pure bi , pure antimony and the alloy .",
    "the valence band of pure bi is characterized by the trivial class @xmath12 , while antimony has the @xmath2 class .",
    "the difference is due to the inversion of the @xmath18 and @xmath19 bands , which changes the sign of @xmath42 .",

    "[ kptable ]    in the previous section we showed that provided there is only a single transition between pure bi and the topological insulator phase of bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 , the mirror chirality deduced from the pure bi band structure determines the mirror chern number in the topological insulator .",
    "this , in turn , determines the direction of propagation of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 states along the line @xmath45 .",
    "the surface state structure predicted by the tight binding model was shown in fig .",
    "[ tbsurface](c ) .",
    "the crossing of the @xmath46 band is consistent with @xmath24 .",
    "this crossing guarantees that there is a dirac point enclosed by the hole pocket .",
    "this can be probed either by inverse photoemission or by spin polarized photoemission . in the latter case",
    ", the presence of the dirac point would lead to a change in the sign of the spin on either side of the hole pocket .",
    "it will be interesting to experimentally determine this property for bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 using spin polarized arpes .    currently available spin polarized photoemission data on the 111 surface of pure bi@xcite provide an indirect probe of @xmath6 .",
    "hole pockets are observed along the line from @xmath9 to @xmath10 in both bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 and pure bi . provided we make the plausible assumption that no additional level crossings occur near the transition to the topological insulator , then the presence or absence of dirac points in the hole pockets should be the same on both sides of the transition . in ref . , the spin in either side of the hole pocket was found to point in the same direction , which indicates that in pure bi , the hole pockets do not enclose a dirac point .",
    "this conclusion was supported by first principles surface state calculations , which also find no crossing@xcite .",
    "this suggests that in the alloy , it should be the @xmath47 band which connects the conduction and valence bands , which is consistent with @xmath25 .",
    "it thus appears likely that the mirror chirality in bi has the anomalous sign , @xmath25 .",
    "this conclusion contradicts the prediction of the tight binding model , but it is supported by ( 1 ) the pseudopotential band structure of pure bi and ( 2 ) the observed and calculated surface state structure of pure bi .",
    "spin polarized arpes experiments on the topological insulator bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 could more directly determine this sign by probing the mirror chern number @xmath4 .",
    "in this paper we have analyzed the surface state structure of the topological insulator bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 . using a simple tight binding model based on liu and allen s tight binding parameterization we confirmed that the surface states have the signature of the strong topological insulator by showing that the surface fermi surface encloses an odd number of dirac points .",
    "the tight binding model also predicts that the surface is semi metallic , with an electron pocket centered on @xmath9 along with 6 hole pockets .    using general arguments based on inversion symmetry",
    ", we showed that the location of electron and hole pockets in the surface brillouin zone is constrained by a quantity which we defined as the surface fermion parity .",
    "this quantity is determined by the parity invariants of the bulk band structure , and for a given surface it determines which surface trim are enclosed by an odd number of fermi surface lines .",
    "this argument establishes a simple and direct connection between the bulk electronic structure and the surface electronic structure for crystals with inversion symmetry . using this general principle , we predicted the structure of the surface states for several different faces of bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "for the 111 face , these predictions agree both with our surface state calculations and with experiment",
    ". it will be interesting to test these predictions experimentally on other faces of bi@xmath0sb@xmath1 .",
    "finally , we showed that the mirror symmetry present in the rhombohedral a7 lattice leads to additional topological structure in the bulk energy bands .",
    "we defined an integer mirror chern number @xmath4 , whose value is nonzero in the topological insulator phase .",
    "the sign of @xmath4 determines the direction of propagation of each of the surface states along the mirror plane , and thus determines which surface states connect the conduction and valence bands .",
    "we find that the crossing of the @xmath46 band predicted by the tight binding model , which leads to a dirac point in the hole pockets , disagrees with the natural extrapolation of experiments and first principles calculations on pure bi , which find no dirac point in the hole pockets .",
    "we traced this discrepancy to a previously unexplored property of the @xmath5 band structure of pure bi , which we defined as the mirror chirality , @xmath6 .",
    "we showed that @xmath6 in pure bi determines @xmath4 in the topological insulator .",
    "moreover , we showed that the liu allen model predicts the conventional value @xmath24 , while an earlier pseudopotential calculation by golin predicts the anomalous value @xmath25 .",
    "the latter value is consistent with the available experimental data on bi , though the connection is rather indirect .",
    "a more direct test would be to directly measure the mirror chirality @xmath4 in the topological insulator by probing the surface states with spin polarized arpes",
    ".    it would be interesting to check that the value of @xmath6 predicted by more accurate first principles calculations of bi agrees with the pseudopotential prediction .",
    "since the tight binding model was designed only to get the energies of the bands right , there is no reason to expect that it would get @xmath6 right .",
    "it should be possible to come up with a new parameterization of the liu allen model which would have @xmath25 .",
    "we expect that the surface states computed within this model would have band crossings which agree with experiment and first principles calculations , though of course a quantitative description of the surface states requires an accurate description of the surface potential .",
    "an important lesson to be learned from this paper is that in addition to time reversal symmetry , spatial symmetries can play an important role in topologically constraining bulk and surface band structures .",
    "our analysis of these symmetries has not been exhaustive . a complete theory of _ topological band theory _ , which accounts for the full point group symmetry of a crystal",
    "is called for .",

    "this work was supported by nsf grant dmr-0605066 , and by acs prf grant 44776-ac10 .",
    "in this appendix we show that for an inversion and time reversal invariant crystal the surface fermion number @xmath48 discussed in section iv is an integer , whose parity is determined by the product of bulk parity invariants @xmath49 , which are products of parity eigenvalues given in eqs .",
    "[ delta ] and [ pi ] .",
    "the simple proof outlined here provides a direct connection between the topological structure of the surface states and the parity eigenvalues characterizing the bulk crystal .",
    "the bloch hamiltonian @xmath50 describes a parity and time reversal invariant one dimensional system . in the following",
    "we will suppress the dependence on @xmath51 and consider a purely one dimensional system . to determine the end charge @xmath52 we introduce the  cutting procedure \" depicted in fig .",
    "[ 1dfig](a ) .",

    "we then replace the hopping amplitudes @xmath53 for all bonds that cross the cleavage plane @xmath54 by @xmath55 , where @xmath56 is real .",
    "provided @xmath54 corresponds to an inversion plane , the one dimensional hamiltonian retains inversion and time reversal symmetry for all @xmath56 .",
    "the fully cleaved crystal corresponds to @xmath57 .    for @xmath58",
    "the system is translationally invariant , so the excess charge near @xmath54 is @xmath59 . since the insulator can have no bulk currents , the only way @xmath60 can change",
    "is if a state localized near @xmath54 crosses the fermi energy .",
    "thus @xmath61 will be the difference between the number of states that cross @xmath62 from above and from below for @xmath63 $ ] .",
    "kramers theorem requires that every state is at least twofold degenerate , so the number of states crossing @xmath62 will be an _ even _ integer .",
