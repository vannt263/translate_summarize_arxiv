    "two - dimensional ( 2d ) materials are one of the most active areas of nanomaterials research due to their potential for integration into next - generation electronic and energy conversion devices @xcite .",
    "graphene , the most widely studied 2d material , is predicted to possess massless dirac fermions , where the fermi velocity @xmath3 of the graphene substitutes for the speed of light @xcite .",
    "recently , the other 2d group - iv materials , silicene , germanene and stanene , have been realized by epitaxial growth on substrates @xcite , and attracted tremendous interest due to their extraordinary properties . unlike graphene , silicene , germanene and stanene have buckled honeycomb structure and large spin - orbital coupling ( soc ) strength , which opens a nontrivial band gap at the dirac point , resulting in significant quantum spin hall ( qsh ) effect @xcite .",
    "such properties provide opportunities for spintronic applications .",
    "furthermore , the superior mechanical flexibility of silicene compared to graphene makes it highly adaptable for flexible nanoelectronics @xcite .",
    "in addition , silicene and germanene are expected to be easily incorporated into the silicon - based microelectronics industry .",
    "apart from silicene and germanene , recent study has found that stanene can provide enhanced thermoelectricity @xcite .",
    "thermal transport plays an important role in these applications . with extremely high thermal conductivity",
    ", graphene has great potential in applications including electronic cooling @xcite ; while for application in thermoelectric ( te ) energy conversion , it is important to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity of a material while maintaining a high electrical conductivity , which often conflict with each other @xcite .",
    "silicene , germanene and stanene are expected to be topological insulators @xcite , and the te figure of merit @xmath4 can be improved by optimizing the geometry size to decrease the lattice thermal conductivity and maximize the contribution of the gapless edge states to the electron transport @xcite .",
    "thus , systematic investigation of phonon transport properties for 2d group - iv materials is needed .",
    "detailed theoretical investigations have predicted that the thermal conductivity @xmath0 of graphene and silicene are in the range of 2000 - 5000 w / mk and 20 - 30 w / mk , respectively @xcite .",
    "moreover , strain effects on lattice thermal conductivity of 2d group - iv crystals have been investigated @xcite . however , due to the violation of crystal symmetry , translational invariance and rotational invariance in 2d materials in the computational algorithms @xcite , in silicene , germanene and stanene , the flexural acoustic branch usually has a linear component @xcite , which significantly influence the phonon transport . to get a more precise estimation , in our calculations , all the invariance conditions in 2d materials such as translations , rotations , and crystal symmetry",
    "are enforced @xcite .",
    "in addition , some previous calculations even predict an instability for germanene and stanene with a small region of negative frequencies near the @xmath5 point @xcite . here",
    "we find that treating ge @xmath1 and sn @xmath2 electrons as valence electrons is required to accurately describe the lattice dynamics of germanene and stanene , which is similar to the case in inp @xcite .    in comparison to studies that focus on only one material ,",
    "the general nature of phonon transport properties in all these 2d group - iv materials is less investigated , and a comprehensive understanding is still lacking .",
    "traditionally there are four factors that determine the lattice thermal conductivity , including ( i ) average atomic mass , ( ii ) interatomic bonding , ( iii ) crystal structure , and ( iv ) anharmonicity @xcite . according to the slack s theory ,",
    "low average atomic mass and strong interatomic bonding imply a high debye temperature , which leads to a high thermal conductivity .",
    "this has been observed in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides mx@xmath6 ( m = mo , w ; x = s , se ) in our previous work @xcite .",
    "however , recent studies have found that , phonon vibrational properties such as acoustic - optical ( a - o ) gap and acoustic bunching also have significant influence on @xmath0 @xcite , leading to unexpected phonon transport properties .",
    "it has been reported that in silicene and germanene , the a - o gap enlarges with increasing buckling height @xcite .",
    "thus it is also interesting to examine that if unexpected phonon transport behavior exists in 2d group - iv materials .        in this paper",
    ", we investigate the lattice thermal conductivity @xmath0 of 2d group - iv materials using first - principles calculations and an iterative solution of the boltzmann transport equation ( bte ) for phonons @xcite .",
    "in contrast to the slack s theory , unexpected higher lattice thermal conductivity in stanene is obtained though the debye temperature of stanene is nearly two times lower than that of germanene .",
    "although it has been demonstrated recently that buckled structures usually lead to lower thermal conductivity due to the breaking of the out - of - plane symmetry @xcite , here we show that these buckled structures also result in a large a - o gap , which tends to reduce the thermal resistance . therefore to estimate accurately the thermal transport in 2d group - iv materials , detailed analysis of the scattering mechanism",
    "is required to understand the competing effects between conventional slack s theory and certain phonon vibrational properties such as the a - o gap .",
    "the size dependence of lattice thermal conductivity is investigated as well for the purpose of the design of te nanostructures .",
    "the in - plane @xmath0 is isotropic and can be calculated as a sum of contribution of all the phonon modes @xmath7 @xcite , which comprises both a phonon branch index @xmath8 and a wave vector @xmath9 , @xmath10 where @xmath11 is the crystal volume , @xmath12 is the heat capacity per mode , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the group velocity and relaxation time of mode @xmath7 along @xmath15 direction , respectively .",
    "we use the nominal layer thicknesses @xmath16 = 3.35  , 4.20  , 4.22   and 4.34   for graphene , silicene , germanene and stanene , corresponding to the van der waals radii of carbon , silicon , germanium and tin atoms , respectively @xcite . the lattice thermal conductivity can be calculated iteratively using the shengbte code @xcite .",
    "the only inputs are harmonic and anharmonic interatomic force constants ( ifcs ) , which are obtained from first - principles calculations .",

    "we choose the generalized gradient approximation ( gga ) in the perdew - burke - ernzerhof ( pbe ) parametrization for the exchange - correlation functional .",

    "the convergence of thermal conductivity with respect to @xmath9 points is tested in our calculation .",
    "a discretizationa of the brillouin zone ( bz ) into a @xmath5-centered regular grid of 200@xmath17200@xmath171 @xmath9 points is introduced . in order to enforce the conservation of energy in the three - phonon processes ,",

    "( [ kappa - eq ] ) .",
    "the phonon scattering depends on two factors @xcite : ( i ) the strength of each scattering channel , which depends on the anharmonicity of a phonon mode , and is described by the grneisen parameter ; ( ii ) the number of channels available for a phonon to get scattered , which is determined by whether there exist three phonon groups that can satisfy both energy and quasi - momentum conservations , and can be characterized by the phase space for three - phonon processes @xcite .",
    "the mode grneisen parameters @xmath21 provide information about anharmonic interactions , and larger @xmath21 implies strong anharmonicity , leading to low lattice thermal conductivity .",
    "the mode grneisen parameters of germanene and stanene are comparable with each other in fig .",
    "[ scattering](a ) . thus the reduced phonon scattering in stanene",
    "can be only attibuted to the number of scattering channels . the total phase space for three - phonon processes @xmath22 provides the number of scattering channels available for three - phonon processes of each phonon mode , and larger @xmath22 means low intrinsic lattice thermal conductivity @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ scattering](b ) , a clear decrease in @xmath22 of stanene is observed , indicating fewer scattering channels and subsequently higher lattice thermal conductivity .    to investigate the underlying scattering mechanisms",
    ", we extract the contributions of different phonon branches to @xmath23 in table  [ thermal ] .",
    "the za contribution decreases from graphene to silicene to germanene and to stanene , while the la contribution increases . for acoustic phonons ,",
    "there are two scattering processes : ( i ) scattering between three acoustic phonons ( @xmath24 ) , and ( ii ) absorption of two acoustic phonons into one optical phonon or vice versa ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "the decreaing za contribution is related to the symmetry of crystal structure . for @xmath24 processes",
    ", it has been reported that in graphene there is a symmetry selection rule due to the one - atom - thick plane , which strongly restricts anharmonic phonon - phonon scattering of the za phonons @xcite . as a result",
    ", only even numbers of za phonons can be involved in three - phonon scattering processes ( za+za@xmath26ta / la or za+ta / la@xmath26za ) . a buckled system such as silicene , germanene and stanene breaks out the out - of - plane symmetry , and",
    "the selection rule does not apply any more , which is similar to blue phosphorene @xcite .",
    "thus the contribution of za phonons to @xmath23 decreases with increasing buckling height from silicene to germanene and to stanene .",
    "the increasing contribution from la phonons can be attributed to the a - o gap . for @xmath25 processes ,",
    "the optical phonons provide important scattering channels for the acoustic phonons .",
    "however , @xmath25 scattering channels can be weakened in materials with large a - o gap @xcite . as shown in fig .",
    "[ gap - bunching ] , the acoustic width decreases from silicene to germanene and to stanene , while the a - o gap enlarges , and finally in stanene , the acoustic width becomes smaller than the a - o gap .",
    "thus all optical branches in stanene have frequencies at least twice the highest acoustic branch frequency , and the @xmath25 processes are prohibited by the conservation of energy .",
    "the scattering channels for high - frequency la phonons are suppressed , leading to large la contribution and reduced thermal resistance .    in addition , the @xmath24 scattering becomes weak in stanene when high - frequency acoustic branches are bunched together @xcite , as shown in fig .",
    "[ gap - bunching](a ) .",
    "there is another selection rule for @xmath24 processes that prohibits the lowest acoustic phonon branch emitting two or more phonons by anharmonic processes of any order @xcite , and subsequently coincident acoustic branches can not satisfy momentum and energy conservation simultaneously @xcite .",
    "thus the phonon scattering between acoustic phonons becomes weaker .",
    "now that we understand that the unexpected higher lattice thermal conductivity of stanene is because the large a - o gap freezes out all @xmath25 processes , and the acoustic bunching of weakens the @xmath24 scattering .",
    "both scattering mechanisms are related to the curvature of phonon dispersion .",
    "thus it is still worthy to investigate the vibrational origin of these differences , especially for the formation of the a - o gap . in the diatomic linear chain model where the scale of the acoustic ( optic ) phonon branch is governed by the larger ( smaller ) mass ,",
    "the formation of the a - o gap is due to the mass difference .",
    "however , in contrast to the diatomic linear chain model , only monatomic honeycomb structures are considered herein . to understand the vibrational origin of the a - o gap , we examine the corresponding projected phonon density of states ( pdos ) for the in - plane ( xy ) and out - of - plane ( z ) vibrations of all studied 2d group - iv crystals in fig .",
    "[ pdos ] .",
    "there is no a - o gap for graphene and silicene , while germanene and stanene show an obvious a - o gap .",
    "the formation of the a - o gap is attributed to the vibrational hybridization in the buckled structure . for planar graphene ,",
    "the xy modes ( ta , la , to , and lo ) are completely decoupled with the z modes ( za and zo ) , while for other 2d group - iv materials the covalent bonds become nonorthogonal to both the xy plane and z direction due to the buckled structure , which results in the hybridization between the vibrations in the xy plane and z direction @xcite .",
    "analysis of the harmonic ifcs shows that the xz and yz components of silicene , germanene and stanene are non - zero , while zero for graphene .",
    "if we set the off - diagonal components xz and yz of the ifcs to be zero , the gap will disappear due to the lack of the la - zo coupling .",
    "the la - zo coupling has two main effects on the phonon dispersion : ( i ) flattening the la branch and ( ii ) stiffening the zo branch , leading to the formation of the a - o gap ( for details , see fig .",
    "s2 in the supplemental material ) .",
    "it should be also noticed that the ta branch ( highest acoustic phonon branch at the k point ) remains the same with or without the la - zo coupling , which is similar to the to branch .    it has been demonstrated recently that buckled structures",
    "usually lead to lower thermal conductivity due to the breaking of the out - of - plane symmetry @xcite . here",
    "we show that buckled structures also result in a large a - o gap , which tends to reduce the thermal resistance .",
    "thus , when estimate the lattice thermal conductivity in a buckled system , the competing effects between the symmetry selection rule of @xmath24 scattering and the optical scattering channels for @xmath25 scattering should both be taken into account .",
    "nm and a specularity parameter @xmath27 . ]",
    "silicene , germanene and stanene are expected to realize higher te efficiency because of much lower lattice thermal conductivity compared to graphene .",
    "this will motivate a systematic examination of the width dependence of thermal conductivity in these materials .",
    "when the size goes down to nanoscale , the boundary scattering plays an important role in thermal transport . in the casimir",
    "s classical limit , the phonon mean free paths ( mfps ) in thin wires under diffuse boundary conditions yield @xcite @xmath28 where @xmath8 is the coefficient of specularity , ranging from 0 for diffusive scattering to 1 for mirrorlike reflection considering the effect of partly specular surface , and @xmath29 is the wire diameter . here",
    "we present the boundary scattering relaxation time for a characteristic length @xmath30 nm and a specularity parameter @xmath27 in fig .",
    "[ boundary ] .",
    "the longest boundary scattering relaxation times coincide with the peaks of phonon dos in fig .",
    "the peaks in phonon dos correspond to the flattened dispersions in phonon spectrum , leading to lower group velocities in fig .",
    "[ vg ] , and with the same boundary scattering limited mfp @xmath30 nm , lower group velocities mean longer relaxation time .",
    "it should be noticed that phonons with small group velocities are not effective carriers of heat @xcite .",
    "thus orders of magnitude reduction of @xmath0 is expected in nanostructured 2d group - iv materials .",
    "though casimir s diffuse boundary mfp sheds light on the thermal transport in nanoscale , it should be noticed that the matthiessen s rule @xmath31 can not be defined for 2d ribbons , because for 3d thin film the mfp is strongly dominated by the phonon scattering on the top and bottom surfaces , while this scattering mechanism does not exist in 2d systems @xcite .",

    "[ size ] presents the thermal conductivities of these nanoribbons as a function of width at 300 k along [ 100 ] direction . in 2d nanoribbons , phonons with long mfps",
    "will be strongly scattered by the boundary , and the contribution of these phonons to @xmath0 will be limited .",
    "as mentioned above , the za contribution decreases from graphene to silicene to germanene and to stanene , therefore the decrease in the za contributed @xmath0 becomes less sensitive to decreasing width . for graphene ,",
    "the large za contribution to @xmath0 comes from phonons with mfps below 1 mm , thus the lattice thermal conductivity is very sensitive to boundary scattering , and can be easily reduced in nanostructures for engineering thermal transport . for silicene , germanene and stanene , the za contribution to @xmath0 comes from phonons with mfps below 1 @xmath32 m , and the @xmath0 is much less sensitive to nanostructuring size effects .",
    "lower lattice thermal conductivity arises typically due to stronger intrinsic phonon scattering , which causes phonons to have shorter mfps @xcite .",
    "consequently , these short - mfp phonons are hard to block by boundaries of a similar size .",
    "thus , it is hard to reduce @xmath0 further in silicene , germanene and stanene nanostructures .",
    "we calculate the lattice thermal conductivity @xmath0 of 2d group - iv materials using first - principles calculations and an iterative solution of the bte for phonons .",
    "the @xmath0 decreases monotonically with decreasing debye temperature from graphene , silicene to germanene , which can be explained by conventional slack s theory .",
    "however , unconventional behavior of @xmath0 is observed in stanene .",
    "compared to germanene , a large a - o gap in stanene cancels the scattering between acoustic and optical phonons , and a bunching together of the acoustic phonon branches weakens scattering between acoustic phonons , leading to higher lattice thermal conductivity . though it has been demonstrated that in a buckled system , the thermal conductivity is reduced due to the break of the symmetry selection rule , which severely suppresses the contribution from za phonons .",
    "here we show that the buckled structures also induce the la - zo coupling , which enlarges the a - o gap and subsequently results in higher lattice thermal conductivity .",
    "thus in a buckled system , the competing effect between @xmath24 scattering and @xmath25 scattering is need to take into account .",
    "we also investigate the boundary scattering relaxation time for a characteristic length @xmath30 nm and a specularity parameter @xmath27 . in 2d nanoribbons",

    "<S> it has been argued that stanene has lowest lattice thermal conductivity among 2d group - iv materials because of largest atomic mass , weakest interatomic bonding , and enhanced za phonon scattering due to the breaking of an out - of - plane symmetry selection rule . </S>",
    "<S> however , we show that although the lattice thermal conductivity @xmath0 for graphene , silicene and germanene decreases monotonically with decreasing debye temperature , unexpected higher @xmath0 is observed in stanene . by enforcing all the invariance conditions in 2d materials and including ge @xmath1 and sn @xmath2 electrons as valence electrons for germanene and stanene respectively , the lattice dynamics in these materials are accurately described . a large acoustic - optical gap and the bunching of the acoustic phonon branches significantly reduce phonon scattering in stanene , leading to higher thermal conductivity than germanene . the vibrational origin of the acoustic - optical gap can be attributed to the buckled structure . </S>",
    "<S> interestingly , a buckled system has two competing influences on phonon transport : the breaking of the symmetry selection rule leads to reduced thermal conductivity , and the enlarging of the acoustic - optical gap results in enhanced thermal conductivity . </S>",
    "<S> the size dependence of thermal conductivity is investigated as well . in nanoribbons , </S>",
    "<S> the @xmath0 of silicene , germanene and stanene is much less sensitive to size effect due to their short intrinsic phonon mean free paths . </S>",
    "<S> this work sheds light on the nature of phonon transport in buckled 2d materials . </S>"
