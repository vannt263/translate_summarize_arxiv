    "impurity problems are ubiquitous in the theoretical description of nonequilibrium systems @xcite .",
    "they constitute small entities with a limited number of degrees of freedom that are coupled to reservoirs with continua of non - interacting degrees of freedom .",
    "one intuitive physical realization of such a model is a molecule adsorbed on a surface or contacted by electrodes @xcite .",
    "a variety of nonequilibrium scenarios may be described in terms of impurity models , for instance by preparing the impurity in an excited initial state or by coupling it to different reservoirs in different thermodynamic states .",
    "another intriguing application occurs in dynamical mean field theory @xcite , where lattice problems either in or out of equilibrium are mapped to impurity problems with an environment that is determined by a self - consistency criterion .",
    "this has been important , for instance , in understanding the metal ",
    "insulator transition in materials like transition metal oxides @xcite and has become an important paradigm in studying nonequilibrium effects in extended interacting systems , including thermalization after an interaction quench @xcite , the nonequilibrium steady state @xcite and bloch oscillations @xcite under the influence of a static electric field .",
    "thus , the theoretical description of impurity problems is a key element in understanding a wide range of phenomena , in particular nonequilibrium effects .",
    "few exact solutions are available , and a number of methods have been developed in the past decades to solve nonequilibrium impurity problems .",
    "they can be sorted into two broad categories : approximate and numerically exact methods .",
    "typically , numerically exact methods allow us to simulate some property of a model in what might be considered a numerical experiment .",
    "approximate methods , on the other hand , may miss important physics or suffer from artifacts due to the approximations involved .",
    "a combination of methods , which operate on different levels of approximation is often useful and helps to elucidate the relevant physical mechanisms @xcite .",
    "the nonequilibrium anderson impurity model has been treated by several numerically exact methodologies .",
    "some approaches require a discretization of the electrodes , for example density - matrix renormalization group @xcite , numerical renormalization group @xcite or multilayer multiconfiguration time - dependent hartree theory @xcite .",
    "these methods are useful at low temperatures and/or voltages .",
    "they are restricted by revival oscillations and a limited spectral resolution of the leads @xcite .",
    "other approaches can take advantage of the noninteracting nature of the leads and do not require discretization .",
    "this includes iterative path - integral schemes @xcite , which converge only for a limited set of parameters , and stochastic schemes @xcite , where the growth of the statistical error restricts the accessible time scales . in the presence of a short memory timescale",
    ", long time scales can be accessed by a combination of reduced dynamics techniques @xcite with a short - time numerically exact scheme ; or by the hierarchical master equation method @xcite where the numerical effort scales linearly with the simulation time .",
    "the latter , however , can only be converged if the temperature in the electrodes is not too low @xcite .",
    "the numerical effort associated with most numerically exact schemes restricts practical calculations to specific limits @xcite or limited ranges of parameters .",
    "it is important to delineate the regimes in parameter space to which each method is applicable , and in particular to find out where exact results are not available . in this work ,",
    "we elucidate the practical limitations of two numerically exact schemes : the continuous - time quantum monte carlo ( ct - qmc ) method @xcite and the hierarchical quantum master equation ( hqme ) method @xcite .",
    "we will discuss the main features of these approaches , characterizing , in particular , the associated numerical effort .",
    "we find that the range of parameters where the two methods can be applied overlaps , but also exhibits areas where only one of the methods can be applied . as we will see , hqme turns out to be the method of choice to study long - term dynamics if the temperature of the reservoirs is not too low .",
    "in contrast , ct - qmc gives access to the short- and intermediate - time dynamics over a wider range of temperatures .",
    "we demonstrate our findings using an archetypal nonequilibrium problem : transport through a single - site anderson impurity that is coupled to left and right electrodes ( see fig .  [ qdfig ] for a graphical representation ) .",
    "the most obvious physical realizations of this impurity problem are quantum dots containing a single spin - degenerate level .",
    "the first such realizations were based on quantum - confinements in patterned semiconductor heterostructures @xcite .",
    "single - molecule junctions often exhibit similar behavior @xcite , but in a setting where experimental techniques give less control over the parameters of the junction .",
    "additionally , other effects , e.g. due to vibrational degrees of freedom , are important @xcite . in these systems",
    ", transport is induced by shifting the electrochemical potentials in the leads with respect to each other such that electrons tunnel through the impurity in order to move from the lead with higher chemical potential to that with lower chemical potential . in semiconductor heterostructures",
    "this shift is achieved by charging or discharging the leads ( _ i.e. _ by filling or emptying electronic levels ; cf .",
    "[ qdfig]b ) . in single - molecule junctions ,",
    "the leads are less likely to be charged , and the shift of the electrochemical potentials is accompanied by a shift of the respective conduction bands ( cf .",
    "[ qdfig]c ) .",
    "we will show that these different ways of inducing transport strongly affect the initial dynamics of the impurity .",
    "we also present exact results for the complex magnetization dynamics of an anderson impurity in various nonequilibrium situations .",
    "typically , this quantity exhibits the slowest relaxation behavior @xcite and , as we will see , exhibits a non - linear behavior on all times scales , in particular when an asymmetric coupling to the electrodes is considered . to date ,",
    "this dynamics had only been accessible at great computational cost using state - to - the - art ct - qmc methods combined with reduced dynamics @xcite .",
    "the hqme method gives access to exact results of this long - lived correlated dynamics and allows us to perfrom a scan over a wide range of parameters .",
    "it can also be used to derive approximate results and , therefore , to study the influence of higher order processes .",
    "we are , therefore , able to elucidate the origin of the non - monotonic temperature dependence of the magnetization that was recently reported in ref .",
    "@xcite to be the result of competing broadening effects .",
    "we also find a pronounced non - linear behavior of the magnetization on intermediate ( still rather long ) time scales ( cf .",
    "_ e.g. _ , figs .",
    "[ symmb ] and [ asymmb ] ) .",
    "in passing we note that the nonequilibrium anderson impurity model and its generalizations are of great interest in the field of strongly correlated materials within the dynamical mean field theory approximation @xcite .",
    "[ cols= \" < , < , < , < , < \" , ]     the last scenario we discuss is an asymmetric coupling of the impurity to the electrodes . the corresponding magnetization is shown in fig .",
    "[ asymmb ] .",
    "it can be directly compared to the magnetization of the symmetrically coupled impurity that is depicted in fig .",
    "[ symmb ] .",
    "it can be seen that , on short time scales ( top row ) , the initial peak of the magnetization is shifted towards negative voltages .",
    "this is because the coupling to the right electrode is weaker and we start with an initially unoccupied system . the initial population of the impurity is therefore dominated by exchange processes with respect to the left electrode .",
    "the corresponding dynamics occurs on shorter time scales for negative voltages , because the chemical potential of the left electrode @xmath0 is then closer to the single - particle levels @xmath1 .",
    "another qualitative difference with respect to the symmetric case occurs on intermediate time scales . here",
    ", the magnetization is peaked at non - zero values of the bias voltage @xmath2 even when higher - order processes are taken into account .",
    "this behavior was also seen in the symmetric case but only if the hierarchy ( [ hierarcheom ] ) is truncated at the first tier , that is by disregarding higher - order processes .",
    "these processes become quenched by the weaker coupling to the right electrode , while resonant processes with respect to the left electrode are not .",
    "the situation is therefore similar to the symmetrically coupled case without higher - order processes .",
    "the magnetization of the impurity evolves to very similar steady state values , but on even longer times scales ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "minor differences occur due to the weaker hybridization with the right electrode ( _ i.e. _ a less pronounced broadening of the energy levels ) .",
    "we close this section by a discussion on the generality of our findings .",
    "we observed , for example , a very similar behavior of the magnetization dynamics for different choices of the voltage division factor ( @xmath4 for @xmath5 , data not shown ) .",
    "we also calculated the magnetization dynamics starting from different initial states .",
    "if , for example , the initial magnetization points in the direction of the magnetic field , the impurity magnetization shows a very similar behavior as compared to the one we discussed for a symmetric coupling to the electrodes .",
    "similar structures as for an asymmetric coupling to the electrodes appear , if the initial magnetization points opposite to the applied magnetic field .",
    "these signatures , however , decay on much shorter time scales due to the stronger coupling to the right electrode .",
    "in this work , we give the first direct comparison of the hierarchical quantum master equation method @xcite and the diagrammatic , continuous - time quantum monte carlo approach @xcite . to this end",
    ", we have studied the nonequilibrium transport properties of an anderson impurity that is coupled to two electrodes with different chemical potentials .",
    "this transport problem represents a well established and fairly well understood test case .",
    "we discussed the main characteristics of the two numerically exact methods ( cf .",
    "[ hqmevsctqmc ] ) .",
    "they are distinguished by the range of parameters where exact results can be obtained in practical calculations .",
    "ct - qmc gives access to the short- and intermediate - time dynamics ( @xmath6 10 units of the inverse hybridization strength ) but in general fails to describe long - time dynamics , for example in the presence of kondo correlations , because the numerical effort scales exponentially with the simulation time @xcite .",
    "in contrast , the hierarchical master equation method scales linearly with the simulation time and is , therefore , not limited in terms of the accessible time scale .",
    "it represents a hybridization expansion , which can be carried out to sufficiently high order if the temperature in the electrodes is not too low . for the present problem",
    ", we were able to obtain converged results only for temperatures above the kondo temperature .",
    "our findings provide a wealth of numerically exact benchmark data certain to be useful to future method developers .",
    "we have also elucidated interesting physical phenomena for the range of parameters , where numerically exact results have been accessible with a reasonable numerical effort .",
    "we investigated the short - time dynamics of the ( symmetrized ) current flowing through the impurity in the presence of a bias voltage , starting from a product initial state where the impurity is not populated by electrons .",
    "while a linear increase of the current level is found for situations where the conduction bands are not shifted with the applied bias voltage ( corresponding to realizations of quantum dots with semiconductor heterostructures ) , a qualitatively different behavior emerges when the electrodes are not charged when applying a bias voltage . at low temperatures , oscillations of the current level ,",
    "current ringing @xcite , due to dynamical phases appear .",
    "in addition to the current , we also studied the magnetization dynamics in the presence of a magnetic field .",
    "we confirmed the recently reported non - monotonic temperature dependence of the steady state magnetization @xcite and traced it back to competing broadening effects of the impurity levels .",
    "in addition , we found complex structures on intermediate yet long time scales ( _ i.e. _ , in the cases studied , about 10 units of the inverse hybridization strength ) in the presence of an asymmetric coupling to the electrodes ( cf .",
    "[ asymmb ] ) .",
    "our comparative study is a first step towards practical guidelines in choosing the right solver for a given impurity problem .",
    "since the presented methods can not cover the full spectrum of problems , it would be interesting to compare them to other exact schemes , including , for example , numerical renormalization group , density matrix renormalization group , multi - layer multi - configurational time - dependent hartree , or other quantum monte carlo schemes .",
    "a primary goal is to identify regions of parameter space where methods overlap and , of course , regions which can not be covered satisfactorily by any of the available methods .",
    "further activities in this direction are planned , and we would like to encourage other researchers to participate in these efforts .",

    "the convergence properties of the hqme approach strongly depend on the importance criterion that is used to truncate the hierarchy of equations of motion ( [ hierarcheom ] ) . in this appendix",
