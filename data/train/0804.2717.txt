    "over the last two decades , the study of driven diffusive systems kls , sz , vp , schutz has formed a significant branch in the general pursuit to understand non - equilibrium statistical mechanics .",
    "the underlying dynamics violates detailed balance , so that the long - time behavior is governed by a true _ non - equilibrium _ steady state ( ness ) .",
    "highly unexpected and non - trivial properties are manifested , even in one - dimensional systems with purely local dynamics .",
    "a paradigmatic model in the last class is the totally asymmetric simple exclusion process ( tasep ) krug , derrida92,dehp , s1993,derrida , schutz .",
    "characterized by open boundaries and particle transport , it displays the key physical signatures of a system driven far from equilibrium .",
    "in particular , its ness develops a complex phase diagram controlled by the interactions of the system with its environment . while an understanding of these properties is of fundamental theoretical interest , the tasep and its generalizations",
    "have also acquired fame as models for practical problems in traffic flow @xcite and biological transport @xcite .    in this paper",
    ", we study a simple variant of the basic tasep , by introducing a global constraint on the available number of particles . deferring the motivations for such a model to the next paragraphs ,",
    "let us briefly summarize the essentials .",
    "each site of a one - dimensional lattice is either empty or occupied by a single particle .",
    "following random sequential dynamics , the particles enter the lattice at one end ( e.g. , the `` left '' edge ) with a given rate @xmath0 , hop to the right with rate @xmath1 ( scaled to unity ) , subject to an excluded volume constraint , and exit at the far end with a rate @xmath2 . in the standard version of the model ,",
    "both @xmath3 and @xmath2 are constant rates , independent of the number of particles on the lattice .",
    "thus , we may regard the lattice as being coupled to a reservoir  or a pool  with an arbitrarily large number of particles . here , we consider a tasep with a _",
    "finite _ supply of particles and report our numerical and analytical findings .",
    "a fixed number of particles , @xmath4 , is shared between the lattice and the reservoir , in such a way that the entrance rate , @xmath0 , depends on the number in the pool : @xmath5 . as a result ,",
    "if more particles are found on the lattice , the number of available particles in the pool is lowered , leading to a corresponding decrease of @xmath0 . since the number of particles on the tasep lattice , @xmath6 , feeds back into @xmath0 through the constraint @xmath7 constant @xmath8 , we will refer to our model as `` a constrained tasep . '' for simplicity , we assume the reservoir to be so large that particles exiting the lattice are unaffected by @xmath5 , leaving @xmath2 unchanged . our focus here is to explore the consequences of limited resources : how will the phase diagram and the properties of the phases be affected as the total number of available particles is reduced ?    this behavior mimics the limited availability of resources required for a given physical or biological process . for example , in protein synthesis , ribosomes bind near the start sequence of a messenger rna , in order to translate the genetic information encoded on the rna into the associated protein .",
    "ribosomes are large molecular motors which are assembled out of several basic units , and numerous ribosomes can be bound to the same , or other , mrnas , so that multiple proteins are translated in parallel .",
    "when a protein is completed , the ribosome is disassembled and recycled into the cytoplasm . under conditions of rapid cell growth , ribosomes or their constituents",
    "can find themselves in short supply , so that a self - limitation of translation , mimicked via a modification of @xmath0 , can occur .",
    "in a previous study @xcite , a different aspect of ribosome recyling was considered .",
    "this work focused on the enhancement of the ribosome concentration at the initiation site , as a result of diffusion of the ribosome subunits from the termination site ( of the same mrna ) . due to the spatial proximity of initiation and termination sites , @xmath0",
    "is effectively increased . by contrast",
    ", our investigation of constrained resources leads to an effective _ reduction _ of @xmath0 .    in the context of traffic models , our problem corresponds to a generalization of the parking garage problem @xcite . here",
    ", one special site ( the `` parking garage '' , or reservoir ) is introduced into a tasep on a ring ( lattice with periodic boundary conditions ) and , for this site only , the occupancy is unlimited .",
    "particles ( `` cars '' ) jump into the garage with unit rate ( corresponding to @xmath9 ) , irrespective of its occupancy .",
    "particles exit the garage with rate @xmath0 , provided the site following the garage is empty . as we will see presently , this is a special case of our more general model .",
    "we begin with a description of our model and its observables of interest .",
    "next , we outline results from simulations and compare them to a simple theory which builds on exact analytic results for the standard tasep .",
    "we find excellent agreement for nearly all ( @xmath0,@xmath2 ) and conclude with some comments and open questions .",
    "the standard tasep is defined on a one - dimensional lattice of length @xmath10 , with sites labeled by @xmath11 , @xmath12 .",
    "each site can be empty or occupied by a single particle , reflected through a set of occupation numbers @xmath13 which take the values @xmath14 or @xmath15 .",
    "the boundaries of the lattice are open .",
    "particles hop from a reservoir onto the lattice with a rate @xmath3 . once on the lattice",
    ", particles will hop to the nearest - neighbor site on the right , provided it is empty . once a particle reaches the end of the lattice , it hops back into the reservoir with rate @xmath2 .",
    "the dynamics is random sequential , leading to fluctuations in the local occupations as well as in the total number of particles , defined via    @xmath16 the overall density is given by @xmath17 .",
    "ensemble averages are denoted by @xmath18 .",
    "three distinct phases can be identified and are displayed in an @xmath19 phase diagram ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : phase_diagram ] ) : a low density ( ld ) , a high density ( hd ) , and a maximum current ( mc ) phase . the phases are distinguished , respectively , by their average densities : @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 .",
    "the corresponding stationary currents are given by @xmath23 , @xmath24 , and @xmath25 .",
    "in all of these expressions , finite - size corrections have been neglected .",
    "because of particle - hole symmetry , all aspects of the hd and ld phases are related .",
    "the phase boundaries between the hd and mc phases and between the ld and mc phases mark continuous transitions .",
    "the line separating the hd and ld phases , @xmath26 , is a coexistence line . here , the system consists of a region with low density ( @xmath27 ) followed by one with high density ( @xmath28 ) , connected by a microscopically sharp `` shock . ''",
    "this shock diffuses freely between the ends of the system , so that the _ average _ density profile is linear .",
    "often this is referred to as the `` shock phase '' ( sp ) .",
    "the system of interest here differs from the standard tasep in one important way : the number of particles in the reservoir , @xmath5 , is finite , and we choose the on - rate @xmath0 to depend on @xmath5 as follows .",
    "so as to distinguish this varying rate from the @xmath0 of the ordinary tasep , we denote the former as the _ effective _ on - rate @xmath29 and write @xmath30 where @xmath31 is a function that satisfies three conditions : ( i ) @xmath32 , ( ii )  @xmath33 , and ( iii ) @xmath31 is monotonically increasing .",
    "the first of these conditions is self - evident ; the second simply connects our model to the standard one with unlimited resources ; the last is just common sense . in this notation , the `` parking garage '' problem @xcite",
    "is characterized by @xmath34 where @xmath35 is the heaviside step function . here , we wish to model , say , a cell with finite number of ribosomes , so that it is natural to assume that a smaller number of particles in the pool results in a lower on - rate , etc . , and that @xmath36 would be a smoother function .",
    "specifically , for the simulations shown below we choose @xmath37 where @xmath38 provides the scale for crossover to saturation .",
    "the detailed choice of @xmath38 is unimportant , but it is convenient to make it extensive in @xmath10 . for easier comparison ,",
    "we choose @xmath38 to be the average ( stationary ) density of the unconstrained tasep defined by the parameters @xmath39 : for example , if @xmath40 ( hd phase , ordinarily ) , we set @xmath38 to @xmath41 . for the sp , we arbitrarily choose @xmath42 . to summarize , the control parameters of our model are the same as the ordinary tasep ( @xmath43 ) plus the total number of particles , @xmath4 ( i.e. , @xmath44 ) .",
    "to characterize our system in steady state , we measure the average density @xmath45 , the average ( local ) density profile @xmath46 , and the average current @xmath47 . for the last quantity",
    ", we record the total number of particles entering and leaving the chain over the run ( thereby improving statistics ) and divide the average of these by the length of the run .    in our monte carlo simulations",
    ", we pick randomly from the @xmath6 particles on the lattice and one additional _ virtual _ particle .",
    "if a lattice particle is selected , we attempt to update its position as in ordinary tasep ; if the virtual particle is selected , we attempt to place a new particle on the first site of the chain .",
    "@xmath48 attempts constitute one monte carlo step ( mcs ) .",
    "initially , the chain is empty , i.e. , @xmath49 , @xmath50 .",
    "typically , the first @xmath51 ( @xmath52 for sp ) mcs are discarded , to ensure that the system has reached steady state , before data are taken .",
    "then , configurational observables are recorded every @xmath53 mcs and averaged until the run terminates .",
    "the typical length of each run is @xmath52 ( @xmath54 for sp ) mcs .",
    "longer runs are required to obtain low noise data for density profiles and currents .",
    "statistical errors were estimated through visual inspections of time series and through multiple runs , to ensure the reproducibility of the data .",
    "we simulated system sizes in the range of @xmath55 to @xmath56 , with most data taken for @xmath57 . to obtain the phase diagram",
    ", we simulated more than a dozen @xmath39 pairs . here ,",
    "we report results for four points : @xmath58 , @xmath59 , @xmath60 , and @xmath61 .",
    "since these correspond , respectively , to ld , hd , mc , and sp in a standard tasep , we will use these letters to refer to the four cases studied .",
    "in this section , we summarize our simulation results . since only the on - rate depends on the feedback , the behavior of our system is no longer governed by particle - hole symmetry . as a result ,",
    "the simplest case is the first in the above , i.e. , `` ld '' . both @xmath62 and @xmath47 increase with @xmath4 in an expected fashion .",
    "the next case , mc , is already slightly more interesting : both @xmath62 and @xmath47 increase until the effective on - rate reaches 1/2 , after which both become constant .",
    "the end result is a pronounced kink in @xmath62 .",
    "the hd case provides an even more interesting scenario : the system properties range through _ three _ regions as @xmath4 is increased .",
    "finally , the sp provides the most unexpected behavior . in the next section ,",
    "we turn to a simple theoretical description of our findings .    _ the ld case . _ here , we set @xmath63 , @xmath64 , and vary the total number of particles , @xmath4 , in the system . with @xmath36 given by eqn ( [ alpha - mcs ] ) , our simulation results for @xmath57 and @xmath65 are shown in fig .",

    "another intriguing phenomenon , not shown here explicitly , is the complex dependence of this crossover on @xmath10 .",

    "the result is that the crossover region gets longer with larger @xmath10 , producing challenges at the simulations front as well .",
    "of course , these difficulties are hardly surprising , since the complexities here are undoubtedly due to large fluctuations associated with the infrared scales .",

    "we will not present any details here , but the agreement of simulation data and analytic results for the three regimes ( hd , ld , and mc )  is equally convincing .",
    "however , the details of the crossover regime in sp are likely to be quite sensitive to functional form of @xmath36 .",
    "in this paper , we studied a tasep with open boundary conditions .",
    "in contrast to the standard model , where the particles are supplied by an infinite reservoir , the total number of available particles in our model , @xmath4 , is _ fixed_. mimicking limited resources , the available particles are shared between the reservoir and the system itself : if more particles bind to the chain , the reservoir is depleted , and vice versa .",
    "we account for this situation through an effective on - rate , @xmath29 , which depends on @xmath5 , the number of particles in the pool , and hence , on @xmath6 , the number on the chain .",
    "specifically , we mainly used eqn ( [ alpha - mcs ] ) , @xmath171 , here .",
    "as the number of available particles is reduced from infinity , the system crosses over from the asymptotic behavior of the standard tasep to different behaviors dominated by limited resources .    if the corresponding standard model ( i.e. , @xmath172 limit ) lies in the ld phase , there are no surprises in either @xmath62 , the average particle density on the chain , or @xmath47 , the average current : both are proportional to @xmath4 for @xmath173 , crossing gently over to the asymptotic values much like the @xmath174 function . for the mc phase",
    ", there is already a sublety :  both @xmath62 and @xmath47 increase monotonically and then , at a characteristic @xmath29 ( @xmath175 ) become constant .",
    "@xmath62 displays a notable kink there . for the other two cases ( hd and sp )",
    ", @xmath62 exhibits an additional , intermediate regime ( though the behavior of @xmath47 shows little hint of this regime ) . in the hd case , @xmath62 is linear in @xmath76 with _ unit _ slope ; only the intercept depends on @xmath176 . here",
    ", @xmath5 remains constant , as any increase in @xmath76 is `` absorbed '' by the chain ( through a shift in the domain wall ) .",
    "this behavior may be regarded in the same light as an equilibrium system with phase co - existence .",
    "considering , e.g. , the pressure _ vs. _ volume isotherm for a liquid - gas system below criticality , the pressure remains constant over some range , as any increase in volume is absorbed by a shift in the liquid - to - gas ratio .",
    "the most interesting and challenging case is the sp . in the intermediate regime ,",
    "a `` shoulder '' appears in @xmath153 .",
    "in addition , this structure displays a non - trivial dependence on @xmath10 .",
    "although the predictions of domain wall theory agree reasonably well with mc data , there are small ( @xmath177 ) systematic discrepancies .",
    "we also investigated histograms of particle densities , which cross over from sharply peaked gaussians for @xmath173 to a flat distribution ( between @xmath178 and @xmath179 ) for @xmath180 . in the intermediate regime , this distribution displays a much richer behavior than a truncated exponential  the result of domain wall theory .",
    "several questions remain open for further study .",
    "first , are the transitions between the three regimes in hd associated with true thermodynamic singularities ? we find that the changes in slope accompanying these `` crossovers '' become sharper with increasing chain length @xmath10 .",
    "while this speaks for a true transition , the absence of large fluctuations is somewhat surprising .",
    "clearly , a more careful analysis is required to explore these questions more fully .",
    "second , though domain wall theory is reasonably successful for @xmath181 in the sp case , we would like to find improvements of this approach , so as to account for the crossover regime better . arriving at a good understanding of @xmath102 and the large fluctuations would be desirable .",
    "progress along these lines may also help us to develop an intuitive picture for the complex @xmath10 dependence .",
    "finally , we are mindful of one of the motivations of this study , namely , finite resources in biological systems , e.g. , ribosomes ( and aa - trna s ) for modeling protein synthesis in a cell @xcite . for that application , the above tasep needs to be generalized , to include exclusion at a distance ( particles covering more than one site ) and inhomogeneous hopping rates .",
    "how these systems are affected by finite resources will pose many interesting new challenges , especially on the theoretical frontier .    _ acknowledgements . _",
