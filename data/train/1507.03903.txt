    "we do not distinguish in the notation for @xmath19 and @xmath0 between two - dimensional sets and their immersions in @xmath25 along the planes @xmath26 and @xmath27 , respectively .",
    "the plate @xmath28 is made out of a homogeneous anisotropic elastic material and its deformation is caused by volume forces .",
    "it is ideally fixed over the set @xmath29 while the rest of the plate surface , in particular @xmath30 , is traction - free .",
    "the clamped area is shaded in figure [ f1 ] .     and a small support area @xmath0 . ]    the main goal of this and consequent paper @xcite is to examine the influence of the supporting area ( [ 1.3 ] ) on the stress - strain state of the whole plate .",

    "we emphasize that clamping along the lengthy set @xmath32 plays a considerable role in technicalities of our study and the case of a traction - free lateral side will be treated in a subsequent paper where , in contrast to the present case , the number of small supporting areas and their location become of a major importance .",

    "we write the equilibrium equations as follows:@xmath55 where @xmath56 is the vector ( column ) of the volume ( mass ) forces . the three - dimensional elasticity system ( [ 1.11 ] )",
    "is supplied with the traction - free boundary condition@xmath57 where @xmath58 is the unit vector of the outward normal on the bases @xmath59 . at the clamped parts of the surfaces @xmath60",

    "the variational statement of problem ( [ 1.11])([1.14 ] ) reads : to find a vector function @xmath62 such that@xmath63 where @xmath64 is the natural scalar product in the lebesgue space @xmath65 , @xmath66 is a subspace of functions in the sobolev class @xmath67 which vanish at set ( [ 1.16 ] ) , and the last superscript @xmath68 in ( [ 1.15 ] ) means that test ( vector ) function @xmath69 has three components .    in view of the dirichlet conditions ( [ 1.13 ] ) and ( [ 1.14 ] ) the korn inequality @xcite@xmath70 is valid and the unique solvability of the variational problem ( [ 1.15 ] ) with any @xmath71 follows from the riesz representation theorem .",
    "although there exist various approaches , see @xcite and many others , to verify inequality ( [ 1.17 ] ) , we still need to clarify the dependence of the korn constant @xmath72 on the small parameter @xmath20 . to this end , we exhibit in section [ sect2 ] several variants of weighted anisotropic korn s inequalities .",
    "the kirchhoff theory of thin plates created more than 150 years ago by means of intuitive asymptotic analysis , has got a justification in miscellaneous formulations by various methods and at different level of rigor , we refer only to the mathematical monographs @xcite and intensive lists of literature therein , although setting aside a vast volume of publications with important theoretical and practical results .",
    "if an external loading is scaled to provide the elastic energy of a plate to gain order @xmath73 , the energy norm of asymptotic remainders in kirchhoff s asymptotic formulas becomes @xmath74 and this is the best error estimate available within a two - dimensional theory of plates .",
    "this limitation of the asymptotic accuracy is prescribed exclusively by boundary layer effect near the plate edge .",
    "namely , in the vicinity of the lateral side @xmath16 the standard plane - stress state in the @xmath75-directions , dominant in the midst of the plane , couples with a plane - strain state in the @xmath76-directions , where @xmath77 is the normal vector to @xmath6 .",
    "the latter is represented by special elastic fields which slowly vary along the edge , produce strains and stresses of order 1 at the lateral side @xmath16 but quickly , at the exponential rate , decay at a distance from @xmath16 .",
    "we again refer only to the mathematical papers @xcite and @xcite , where the edge boundary layer phenomenon was investigated in elasticity , and to chapters 15 and 16 of the monograph @xcite where simplest scalar and general elliptic problems were examined and basic principles to construct boundary layers are laid down .",
    "the energy norm@xmath78 of the boundary layer equals @xmath74 that just predetermines the error bound in an integral norm .",
    "however , the proximity of the plane - stress state in a weighted hlder norm is much less , cf .",
    "for example , bounds in the pointwise estimates of remainders in two - dimensional asymptotic forms of stresses get the same order in @xmath20 as the main terms and this is known in mechanics as `` edge effect '' in a thin plate .",
    "thus , the error @xmath74 of the kirchhoff model is mostly due to the intrinsic localization of the edge effect in a @xmath79-neighborhood of the lateral side @xmath16 .",
    "the two - dimensional structure of boundary layers is kept for a smooth contour @xmath6 only .",
    "plates with angulate edges were considered in @xcite where three - dimensional boundary layers with a power - law decay rate were detected .",
    "however , their energy norm ( [ 1.18 ] ) becomes @xmath80 so that they play a secondary role .",
    "as it can be easily predicted due to the sobolev embedding theorem , the dirichlet condition ( [ 1.13 ] ) leads to the sobolev condition ( [ a6 ] ) in the limit , that is the overage deflection @xmath81 of the plate vanishes at the point @xmath12 .",
    "however , the small support area ( [ 1.3 ] ) also provokes a fully three - dimensional boundary layer in the vicinity of @xmath0 and provides a perturbation of order @xmath3 in the two - dimensional model .",
    "in other words , the convergence rate @xmath82 of the rescaled three - dimensional displacements , cf .",
    "theorem [ th3.3 ] , to a solution of the limit dirichlet - sobolev problem ( [ a7 ] ) , ( [ a8 ] ) , ( [ a5 ] ) , ( [ a6 ] ) is very slow and , therefore , unsatisfactory . at the same time",
    ", the asymptotic structures derived in this paper provide the same accuracy as in the kirchhoff theory .    in @xcite ,",
    "the same effect of a crucial reduction of the asymptotic accuracy due to a small dirichlet area has been observed and discussed in detail for a scalar homogenization problem in a perforated planar domain .      to the best knowledge of the authors",
    ", this paper is the first mathematically rigorous and complete study of the boundary layer effect near a small support area and its influence on the whole stress - strain state of a plate .",
    "the necessity to examine rapid variations of elastic fields in the vicinity of the support area @xmath0 accounts for the following result obtained in the consequential paper @xcite : the convergence rate to the two - dimensional kirchhoff solution of the true three - dimensional one is extremely slow , of order @xmath3 , but involving the boundary layer reduces the error estimate bound down to @xmath2 and makes it acceptable for applications . at the same time , the whole boundary layer solution is not known explicitly and can be determined by solving a complicated elasticity problem ( [ 3.38])([3.40 ] ) in the spatial infinite ply @xmath83 , for example , numerically . in this way",
    "a simplification of asymptotic expansions and further modeling take on special significance .    as usual in the theory of elliptic problems in singularly perturbed domains ( see the monographs @xcite and others ) the alternation of boundary conditions on a small set leads to asymptotic forms engaging singular solutions of limit problems and in our case the dirichlet condition ( [ 1.13 ] ) on @xmath0 affects the limit problem in @xmath4 in two ways .",
    "first , it requires to impose the point condition @xmath84 , ( [ a6 ] ) , for the average deflection @xmath85 of the plate .",
    "second , the far - field , eligible at a distance from the support @xmath0 , contains the green matrix , cf .",
    "section [ sect3.4 ] and see @xcite , whose entries are solutions in @xmath4 with logarithmic singularities at the point @xmath86 . due to the sobolev embedding theorem @xmath87 in @xmath5 the point condition is well - posed within the hilbert theory , cf .",
    "* ch.2 ) but the green matrix does not belong to the intrinsic energy space for the kirchhoff plate @xmath4 and therefore breaks the usual variational formulation of the model .    to develop a two - dimensional model of the locally supported plate @xmath28",
    ", we will turn in @xcite to the technique of self - adjoint extensions of differential operators ( see the pioneering paper @xcite and , e.g. , the review @xcite ) .",
    "namely , we get rid of the complicated three - dimensional structure of the boundary layer and simulate its influence on the stress - strain state of the plate by a proper choice of singular solutions .",
    "in other words , we select a special self - adjoint extension in @xmath88 of the matrix @xmath89 of differential operators in the conventional kirchhoff model described in section [ sect3.2 ] , formula ( [ a13 ] ) .",
    "parameters of this extension depend only on the quantity @xmath90 and the algebraic characteristics @xmath91 of the small support area , namely the elastic logarithmic capacity matrix introduced heuristically in @xcite , a @xmath92-matrix composed by coefficients in asymptotics of solutions to the elasticity problem in @xmath93 , see section [ sect3.5 ] , and is quite similar to the logarithmic capacity in harmonic analysis , cf . @xcite and remark [ remlog ] , and polarization and capacity matrices in elasticity , cf .",
    "@xcite and @xcite .",
    "there exist numerical schemes @xcite to evaluate such characteristics .",
    "in section [ sect2 ] we derive anisotropic weighted korn inequality in the plate ( [ 1.1 ] ) clamped along the lateral surface and the small set ( [ 1.3 ] ) ( theorem [ th2.1 ] ) as well as demonstrate that weights introduced in the sobolev norms are optimal .",
    "then we modify our approach to prove theorem [ th2.3 ] which serves for a plate with a traction - free lateral surface but several small support areas .",
    "the last section is devoted to three - dimensional boundary layers emerging in the vicinity of small support areas .",
    "first of all , we outline the two - dimensional kirchhoff model of the plate @xmath28 and the sobolev point condition @xmath84 , ( [ a6 ] ) for the average deflection @xmath85 , which imitates the entire dirichlet condition ( [ 1.13 ] ) on @xmath0 .",
    "moreover , we formulate theorem [ th3.3 ] from @xcite on the convergence of the spatial true solution to the kirchhoff - sobolev solution in order to indicate the extremely slow convergence rate @xmath82 and to emphasize the constitutive influence of boundary layers described by an elasticity problem in the layer @xmath94 clamped along the set @xmath19 on its planar base @xmath95 .    to prove the existence of a unique solution in the unbounded domain @xmath93 but with a finite energy , we need a new anisotropic weighted korn inequality which , however , can be derived by means of the same tricks as in section [ sect2 ] . at the same time , a rigorous derivation of asymptotic expansions of the solution at infinity requires both , a formal procedure of dimension reduction scheduled in section [ sect3.2 ] and a specific application of the kondratiev theory @xcite , cf .",
    "this evident similarity of several approaches in our paper explains its architecture .    in section [ sect3.4 ]",
    "we strictly determine the elastic logarithmic capacity matrix which was mentioned in section [ sect1.4 ] and will be a particular object in @xcite . in theorem [ th3.7 ]",
    "we establish its general properties .",
    "here below we collect some hardy - type inequalities that will be used subsequently .",
