    ". other choices may be more convenient depending on the parameters of the model .",
    "similarly to the variational method given above , @xmath136 when @xmath137 and the even and odd sectors decouple completely when @xmath104 .",
    "this property is preserved for any choice of @xmath138 as long as the property @xmath139 is preserved .",
    "unlike the variational method , however , the approximate solution obtained by truncating to finite dimensional solution space needs _ not _ be an upper bound on the true solution and in general will not be .",
    "first , we would like to determine the parameter region where the behavior of the system is physically reasonable .",
    "in particular , the meson bound state should _ not _ be tachyonic . here",
    ", we will perform the analysis for fermions of equal mass since we expect tachyonic mesons in the flavor singlet channel _ if _ tachyonic mesons exist at all . using the variational method for the meson wavefunction in a manner similar to the previous section , @xmath140^\\gamma\\qquad\\gamma>0\\ ] ] we obtain",
    "an upper bound @xmath141 for the meson mass squared for each @xmath142 . @xmath143",
    "this immediately establishes that when @xmath144 tachyonic mesons will appear . while it is _ logically _ possible from this analysis that the region with both @xmath145 and @xmath146 may be physically consistent , it is unreasonable to expect so ; in practice , we find that tachyonic mesons appear for this case also , when we have a large enough variational space .",
    "therefore , we henceforth interest ourselves in the region @xmath147 and @xmath148 .    using the methods explained in the previous section ,",
    "we may obtain the spectrum and the meson wavefunctions .",
    "we plot the spectrum and the wave functions for some typical cases below in figures ,  and .",
    "we have added a brief note on the convergence of the numerical data as an appendix .",
    "=    as in the t  hooft model , the fermions are confined and the following regge  type behavior is observed for the highly massive mesons , similarly to the t  hooft model : @xmath149 this regge behavior is shown in .",
    "we may understand the behavior of the spectrum in the various limits of the model as follows : when we turn off the gross ",
    "neveu coupling @xmath150 , the spectrum reduces to that of the t   hooft model . as we take the gauge coupling to zero , which effectively is the limit @xmath151 , the splitting between the higher levels disappear .",
    "we have explicitly checked that the mass of the lightest meson approaches to the gross ",
    "neveu model value plotted in in this limit . for the higher levels , @xmath152 approaches @xmath153 in this gross  neveu limit .",
    "the chiral limit may be identified as the limit @xmath154 , similarly to the gross  neveu model case . in the spectrum ,",
    "mass of the meson states decrease as we approach the chiral limit and it is clear that @xmath155 for the lightest meson bound state in the limit @xmath156 . when the limit @xmath151 is taken in addition , it may be explicitly checked that the next lightest meson satisfies @xmath157 corresponding the the @xmath29 mass in the gross  neveu model .",
    "as @xmath158 becomes large , the meson masses behave linearly with the quark masses , as is expected from the naive constituent quark picture .",
    "this picture is supposedly valid for highly massive quarks .",
    "the lightest meson behaves in a qualitatively different manner from the other meson states in the theory .",
    "this is a feature of the gauged four fermi model ; such a behavior does _ not _ occur in the t  hooft model .",
    "the gross ",
    "neveu coupling affects the lightest meson state relatively more than the other meson states .",
    "this disparate behavior is a necessary consequence of the gross ",
    "neveu limit where @xmath159 of @xmath28 and the other mesons approach the corresponding value @xmath160 in the gross  neveu model and four . in the t  hooft model , @xmath159 for the lightest meson also approaches four for large @xmath158 .",
    "in this work , we have solved the meson sector of the gauged four fermi model in the large @xmath0 limit .",
    "we provided detailed prescriptions for solving the model systematically which should be useful for further work involving this class of models .",
    "we also determined the physically consistent region in the gauged four fermi model and analyzed the model there .",
    "however , it is possible that the regions with tachyons correspond to other phases of the model that is inaccessible to our current methods .",
    "both the gross  neveu model and the t   hooft model have been used extensively in the literature to understand the physical behavior of real systems , such as qcd . a model that combines",
    "the two models should be quite useful for understanding the dynamics of various field theories . in one direction ,",
    "the four fermi coupling has been used to model strong interaction dynamics involving dynamical symmetry breaking for quite some time @xcite . by interpolating between these two models ,",
    "we intend to shed more light on the relation between the physical behavior of these two theories .",
    "furthermore , when dynamical symmetry breaking scales are widely separated , in the intermediate energy range , the theory effectively becomes a gauged four fermi model .",
    "such situations can occur quite generally where the lower energy scale is the qcd scale or some technicolor scale .",
    "these types of theories are of phenomenological interest and have been studied actively , for instance , in the so called `` top quark condensation '' models @xcite .",
    "admittedly , the model we studied is a @xmath1 dimensional toy model version of such theories .",
    "historically , however , @xmath1 dimensional theories have played an important role in understanding of the corresponding higher dimensional theories and we hope this will also be true in the future .",
    "the convergence of the numerical solutions depends on the parameters @xmath161 .",
    "when @xmath162 , it is relatively easy to achieve a relative accuracy of @xmath163 in the meson mass at least using both the variational method ( dimension @xmath164 ) and multhopp s method ( dimension @xmath165 ) . for @xmath166 ,",
    "more effort is needed to achieve the same level of convergence .",
    "the difficulties in the variational method using polynomials of the momentum fraction ( section [ sec : variational ] ) arise because of the round off errors since the eigenvalues in the normalization matrix  tend to become small . analytically choosing an orthonormal basis or using some other basis appropriate for the parameter region in question might alleviate this problem . in multhopp",
    "s method ( section [ sec : multhopp ] ) , the limitations arise due to the necessary computational time when using larger space of functions .",
    "choice of @xmath167 may speed up the convergence process in some parameter regions .    in the parameter regions where the convergence is slow ,",
    "extrapolation in the data can be effective .",
    "we have found that trial functions of the type @xmath168 fits the data quite well .",
    "here @xmath122 is the extrapolated value , @xmath132 is the dimension of the space span by the basis and @xmath169 are parameters .",
    "extrapolation can sometimes be misleading so checks on the results are desirable . in our case",
    ", we compare the extrapolation values from both the variational method and multhopp s method and we confirm that they are consistent within the errors of the fit .",
    "an example of such an extrapolation is shown in .",
