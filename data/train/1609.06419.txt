    "there is a growing interest from the nanoscience and nanotechnology community of the dirac hamiltonian in condensed matter owing to the emergence of novel materials that mimic the relativistic dirac quantum mechanical behavior .",
    "the purpose of this review is to present a unified treatment of dirac hamiltonian in solids and relativistic dirac quantum mechanics from the point of view of energy - band quantum dynamics@xcite coupled with the lattice weyl transformation techniques.@xcite this unified view seems to explicitly emerge in the calculation of the magnetic susceptibility of bismuth and bi - sb alloys.@xcite large diamagnetism in solids has been attributed to interband quantum dynamics,@xcite often giving large @xmath0-factor due to pseudo - spin degrees of freedom and induced magnetic field .",
    "these are inherent in interband quantum dynamics . in most cases",
    "we are referring to two bands only which could be kramer s degenerate bands.@xcite on the other hand , the classic landau - peierls diamagnetism is purely a single - band dynamical ( orbital ) effect .",
    "more recently , fukuyama et al@xcite give a review on diamagnetism of dirac electrons in solids from a theoretical perspective of many - body green s function technique .",
    "however , no theoretical calculations were made and compared with the beautiful experiments of wherli@xcite on the diamagnetism of bi - sb alloys .    here",
    "we employ a theoretical perspective of band dynamics that has a long history even before the time of peierls,@xcite who introduced the peierls phase factor , and wannier who introduced the wannier function.@xcite this band dynamical treatment is generalized to the dirac relativistic quantum mechanics and many - body condensed matter physics.@xcite a detailed calculation@xcite of the diamagnetism of bi - sb alloys using the theory of buot and mcclure@xcite yields outstanding quantitative agreement with experimental results.@xcitewe also give a review of the calculations of the magnetic susceptibility of other systems .",
    "firstly , in this section we will give a background on relativistic dirac fermions , the beautiful dirac equation and dirac s declaration of anti - matter and discovery of positrons .",
    "we focus on its impact in motivating the development of modern physics , in particular condensed matter physics leading to a plethora of quasiparticle excitations with exotic properties .",
    "because of this , condensed matter physics has become a low - energy proving ground on some of theoretical concepts in quantum field theory , high - energy elementary particle physics , and cosmology , where the dirac equation has been extended and consistently deformed in ways exposing novel excitations / quasiparticles in physical systems .    in the space - time domain of condensed matter physics ,",
    "it is interesting that the relativistic dirac - like equation was first recognized in the @xmath1  band theory of bismuth and bi - sb alloys.@xcite this scientific historical event is like a repeat of what has happened in ordinary space - time with the quantum theory of relativistic electrons published  in 1928 by dirac@xcite in the form of what is now known as the dirac equation with _ four - component _ fields .",
    "the following year , weyl@xcite showed that for massless fermions , a simpler equation would suffice , involving _ two - component _ fields as opposed to the four - component fields of dirac equation .",
    "these massless fermions is now known as the weyl spin @xmath2 fermions .",
    "about nine years later , in 1937 , majorana@xcite was searching for a real version of the dirac equation which is still lorentz invariant .",
    "thus , by imposing reality constraint of the dirac equation , other solutions were obtained by majorana still describing spin @xmath2 fermions , whose outstanding unique property is that they are their own anti - particles . by virtue of the fact that the complex field of the dirac fermions is replaced by real fields",
    ", one refers to dirac fermions as consisting of two majorana fermions .",
    "thus , majorana fermions are often referred to as half - femions .",
    "developments in physics in the early @xmath3th century is not only confined to relativistic fermions but also to relativistic bosons which act as force - fields between particles .",
    "these particle - particle interactions are usually mediated by massless bosons such as photons , gluons , and gravitons .",
    "however , relativistic massive bosons , the so - called proca particles , mediate the weak interactions between elementary particles .",
    "these are , for example , the @xmath4 and @xmath5 spin-@xmath6 heavy vector bosons .",
    "twenty five years later after majorana , skyrme@xcite proposed a topological soliton in quantum field theory which is now referred to as skyrmion . then in 1978 , callan et al@xcite proposed another topological objects known as merons . in magnetic systems , skyrmions , merons and bimerons",
    "are closely related .",
    "thus , whereas weyl demonstrated the existence of massless relativistic spin-@xmath2 fermions , proca@xcite demonstrated in 1936 the existence of massive relativistic spin-@xmath6 bosons . in crystals ,",
    "phonons are generally classified as the nambu - goldstone modes , but in the interaction between cooper pairs in bcs superconductivity theory no massless phonons are present , only massive plasmalike excitations.@xcitein gauge - field theory of standard model , the proca action is the gauge - fixed version of the stueckelberg action which is a special case of higgs mechanism through which the boson acquires mass .",
    "weyl fermions are irreducible representations of the proper lorentz group , they are considered as building blocks of any kind of fermion field .",
    "weyl fermions are either right chiral or left chiral but can not have both components",
    ". a general fermion field can be described by two weyl fields , one left - chiral and one right - chiral .",
    "it is worth mentioning that helicity and chirality coincide for massless fermions . by combining massless weyl - fermion fields of different chiralities",
    ", one has not really generated a mass but has created a group - theoretical framework where mass can be allowed in the dirac lagrangian since the mass term must contain two different chiralities .",
    "thus , a _ massive _ fermion must have a left - chiral as well as a right - chiral component .",
    "surprisingly the above chain of scientific events in ordinary space - time have been followed , although much later experimentally , by corresponding events in the space - time domain of condensed matter systems .",
    "although , as early as 1937 , herring@xcite have already theoretically predicted the possibility of weyl points in band theory of solid state physics . in more recent years nielsen and",
    "ninomiya@xcite have suggested that excess of particles with a particular chirality were associated with weyl fermions and could be observable in solids .",
    "as mentioned before , the explicit form of dirac hamiltonian first appeared in bismuth and bi - sb alloys in a paper by wolff in 1964 upon blount s suggestion.@xcite actually cohen@xcite gave the same form of the hamiltonian of bismuth four years earlier in 1960 , but did not cast into the form of dirac hamiltonian .",
    "then , with the discovery of graphene @xcite in 2004 , massless dirac fermions were identified in the energy - band structure at the @xmath7-points of the brillouin zone .",
    "the following years are marked with understanding of materials with band structures that are `` topologically '' protected , typically of materials with strong spin - orbit coupling .",
    "this understanding have taken roots much earlier from works on quantum hall effect ( qhe ) and quantum spin hall effect ( qshe ) .",
    "the term topological refers to a concept whereby there is a ` holographic ' quasiparticle - state structure often localized at boundaries , domain walls or defects , which is topologically protected by the properties of the bulk .",
    "this maybe viewed as a sort of _ entanglement _ of the excitation - state with the bulk structure and therefore a _ highly - nonlocal _ property of excitation - state immune to local perturbation.@xcite    the pertinent measure of this entanglement is the subject of exploding research activities on the so - called _ topological entanglement entropy_. @xcite indeed , a _ holographic interpretation _ of topological entanglement entopy was given.@xcite this is also known in the literature simply as generalized _ bulk - boundary correspondence_. these years are replete with findings of topological insulators and topological superconductors , based on the realization that band theory must take into account concepts such as chern numbers and berry phases , familiar in quantum field theory of elementary particles , quantum - hall effect , peierls phase of a plaquette , aharonov - bohm effect , and in born - oppenheimer approximations .",
    "indeed , theorists are now engaged in the exciting fields of topological field theory ( tft ) and topological band theory ( tbt ) .",
    "this attests to the merging of elementary particle physics , cosmology , and condensed matter physics .",
    "topological superconductors are simply the analogue of topological insulators . whereas , topological insulators ( ti ) have a bulk band - gap with odd number of _ relativistic dirac fermions _ and gapless modes on the surface , topological superconductors ( tsc ) are certain type of full superconducting gap tsc in the bulk , but due to the inherent particle - hole symmetry , have gapless modes of chargeless _",
    "majorana ` edge ' states _ , also associated with _ andreev bound state _ ( abs)@xcite on its boundaries , interfaces ( e.g. interface between topological insulators and superconductors ) , and defects , supported by the bulk topological invariants .",
    "the emergence of topological insulators and superconductors also brought to light two types of quasiparticles properties , namely , ( a ) local or ` trivial ' quasiparticles , and ( b ) nonlocal , ` nontrivial ' or topological quasiparticles , often termed as _",
    "topological charge_. the second type are robust states , these can not be created or removed by any local operators .",
    "the topological charge is also called the topological quantum number and is sometimes called the winding number of the solution .",
    "the topological quantum numbers are topological invariants associated with topological defects or soliton - type solutions of some set of differential equations modeling a physical system .    for example , the first @xmath8d topological insulator was predicted for bi@xmath9-sb@xmath10 system with @xmath11 , where the theoretical band structure calculation predicts the @xmath8d topological insulator phase in bi@xmath12sb@xmath13.@xcite these developments are followed around mid - year of @xmath14 with the experimental discovery of weyl fermions which were identified in the so - called weyl semimetals .",
    "specifically , the historic angle - resolved photoemission spectroscopy ( arpes ) experiments performed on ta - as has revealed weyl fermions in the bulk.@xcite likewise , similar experiments on photonic crystal have identified weyl points ( not weyl fermions ) inside the photonic crystal.@xciteweyl points differ from dirac points since the former has two - component wavefunction whereas the later generally has four component wavefunction , e.g. in graphene the @xmath15 points in the brillouin zone end ows the two chiralities for a dirac hamiltonian for graphene .",
    "the excitement about the experimental discovery of weyl semimetals has to do with its great potential for ultrafast devices .",
    "the absence of backscattering for weyl fermions is related to the so - called klein paradox in quantum electrodynamcis due to conservation of chirality .",
    "because of this , weyl fermions can not be localized by random potential scattering in the form of anderson localization@xcite common to massive electrons . moreover , with the eficient electron - hole pairs screening of impurities , mobilities of weyl fermions are expected to be more than order of magnitude higher than the best si transistors . in passing , we could say that the crossing of the bands of different symmetry properties in bi@xmath16-sb@xmath10 alloys @xcite for antimony concentration of @xmath17 might also serves as a weyl semimetal , ignoring questions of topological stability .

    "since particles and antiparticles have opposite conserved charges , a majorana fermion with its own antiparticle is a necessarily uncharged fermion . in his original paper , majorana fermions",
    "can have arbitrary spin , so with spin zero it is still a fermion since the majorana annihilation and creation operators still obey the anticommutation rule .",

    "another form of @xmath21 with equal spin projection , say a triplet or effectively spinless since spin degree of freedom does not have to be accounted for , is also a majorana field operator , @xmath22 .",
    "this particular @xmath23-form arises by imposing the majorana condition @xcite on the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation of superconductivity .",
    "a conventional quasiparticle in superconductor is a broken cooper pair , an excitation called a bogoliubov quasiparticle and can have spin @xmath2 .",
    "it is simply a linear combination of creation and annihilation operators , namely , @xmath24 and @xmath25 , where @xmath26 and @xmath27 are the components of the wavefunction of the bogoliubov - de gennes ( bdg ) equation .",
    "the requirement of bogoliubov canonical transformation is that @xmath28 = \\big ( a_{\\alpha}a_{-\\alpha}^{\\dagger } +   a_{-\\alpha}^{\\dagger } a_{\\alpha}\\big)$ ] , therefore we must have @xmath29 and @xmath30 . the particle created by the operator",

    "thus , whereas charge prevents majorana from emerging in a metal , on the other hand _ distinct _ creation and annihilation operators through superposition of electrons and holes with opposite spins is preventing majorana quasiparticles in conventional @xmath32-wave superconductors .",
    "if majorana fermion is to appear in the solid state it must therefore be in the form of _ still to be experimetally demonstrated _ nontrivial emergent majorana excitations in real materials .",
    "the attention is focused on topological superconductors .    after a theoretical demonstration of the existence of majoranas at the ends of a @xmath33-wave pairing kitaev - chain , several theoretical demonstrations for the existence of zero - mode majorana bound states ( mbs ) follow . in kitaev",
    "s prediction , inducing some types of superconductivity , known as the proximity effect , would cause the formation of majoranas .",
    "these emergent particles are stable ( majorana degenerate bound states ) and do not annihilate each other ( unless the chain or wire is too short ) because they are spatially separated .",
    "thus , @xmath33-superconductors provide a natural hunting ground for majoranas",
    ".    the search for majorana has also pave the way for the _ novel physics of zero modes _ of the extended dirac equation with inhomogeneous mass term that varies with position ( corresponding to the momentum - dependent pairing potential in bdg equation ) , yielding a _ kink - soliton _ solution in @xmath6-d , a _ vortex _ solution in @xmath34-d , and a _ magnetic monopole _ in @xmath8-d .",

    "it is worth emphasizing that condensed matter physics has become the low - energy playground for discovering various quasiparticles and exotic topological excitations , which were mostly first proposed in quantum field theory of elementary particles , namely , dirac fermions , weyl fermions , proca particles , vortices , skyrmions , merons , bimerons and other topologically - protected quasiparticles obeying non - abelian and anyon statistical properties .",

    "the higher - dimensional @xmath23-matrices generalize the @xmath50-dimensional @xmath23-matrices of dirac to arbitrary dimensions .",

    "a possible choice of the weyl basis is @xmath67 in the _ weyl representation _ , the dirac equations reads@xmath68 it is worthwhile to point out that eq.([diracweyl ] ) is interesting and bears resemblance to the eigenvalue equation for graphene if the @xmath69 chirality degree of freedom of the zero - mode dispersions from the two inequivalent @xmath15 points in the brillouin zone ( bz ) is taken into account .",
    "the isospin degree of freedom arises from the degeneracy of these inequivalent @xmath15 points at the bz corners .",
    "thus , the @xmath15 points dirac electrons in graphene fits the weyl representation of relativitic dirac equations .",
    "it is the isospin degree of freedom that gives each @xmath7 point in bz a definite chirality .",
    "this has several exotic physical consequences as will be discussed in a separate paper by the authors .",
    "thus , in accounting for the @xmath15 points of the brillouin zone of graphene its hamiltonian exactly resembles the relativistic dirac hamiltonian in the weyl representation with zero mass .",
    "note that if @xmath70 , we only need to solve one of the @xmath71 matrix equations , yielding massless weyl fermions with definite chirality ( note also that chirality and helicity are both good quantum labels for massless fermions ) .",
    "this is clarified in what follows .    in matrix form",
    "we have , @xmath72 the eigenvalues are , @xmath73 here , @xmath74 and @xmath75 are the eigenstates of the chirality operator @xmath59 .",
    "the weyl basis has the advantage that its chiral projections take a simple form , @xmath76 hence , in weyl chirality @xmath23-basis , we have @xmath77 thus chirality and helicity are a good quantum numbers for weyl massless fermions .",
    "the majorana representation of dirac equation can occur in @xmath33-wave superconductors .",
    "in the the majorana @xmath23-basis , all of the dirac matrices are imaginary and spinors @xmath78 are real .",
    "we have @xmath79 the gamma matrices are imaginary to obtain the particle - physics metric @xmath51 , i.e. , @xmath80 in which squared masses are positive .    the majorana relativistic equation is thus given by @xmath81 using the relation @xmath82",
    ", we obtain after multiplying by @xmath57 , @xmath83 which reduces to @xmath84 where @xmath85 is imaginary , @xmath86 is real , and @xmath87 is imaginary .",

    "however , in general @xmath96 .",
    "thus , to have a real majorana equation in @xmath33-wave superconductor , we can expect the following form for the self - adjoint majorana hamiltonian in superconductor,@xcite@xmath97 where we have factored out the constant @xmath19 or equated to unity .",
    "this can be substituted by a constant group velocity , @xmath98 , for zero - gap or ` massless ' states .",
    "there is a formal analogy between the dirac relativistic equation , bcs theory of superconductivity and bdg equation .",
    "we shall see later that their hamiltonians have resemblance with the hamiltonian of bi and bi - sb alloys .",
    "we can intuitively understand how the phonon - mediated electron - electron scattering in metals results in attractive interaction , i.e. , by exchange of bosons leading to cooper pairing .",
    "the instantenous emission and absorption of highly - energetic phonons by interacting pair of electrons near the fermi surface with opposite initial momentum , @xmath99 and @xmath100 , and with final momentum states of the cooper pair in the form @xmath101 where @xmath102 is the phonon wavevector will endow _ opposite impulses _ to the pair . on the average , this becomes an attractive - binding force between them , resulting in a zero - total - momentum bcs bound state . in general , this attractive interaction dominates in highly - dense - electron metal system with efficient coulomb - potential screening .",
    "this condition yields nonzero mean - field average ( ` pairing ' ) for @xmath103 and its complex conjugate @xmath104 .",
    "in bcs theory , not only the momentum will have opposite sign but pairs must have opposite spin as well to maximize interaction , because the exchange interaction between parallel spins will reduce the attractive phonon - mediated interaction .",
    "thus , the inital momentum of phonon - mediated interaction between pair of electron is of the set @xmath105 .",
    "this may also be interpreted as conservation of helicity for the pair .",
    "there are of course other boson - mediated pairing mechanisms which are more complex .",
    "for example , depending on the band structure a non - bcs pairing with nonzero total momentum of the pair in the form @xmath106 where @xmath102 is the phonon wavevector , or @xmath107 via spin - singlet channel are referred to as the fulde - ferrel - larkin - ovchinnikov ( fflo ) pairing.@xcite the fflo pairing was also proposed for _ doped _ weyl semimetals which have a shifted fermi surface brought by doping .",
    "the pairing theory was generalized to nonzero relative angular momentum type of pairing , such as the @xmath33-wave pairing , to be discussed later in connection with topological superconductors .",
