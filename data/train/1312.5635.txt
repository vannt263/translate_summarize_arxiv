    "the internal configuration of a nuclear system plays an important role on the stability , which is connected to the cluster radioactivity . in 1984",
    ", the cluster radioactivity was discovered @xcite and the consequent excitement led to several experiments at different places all over the world . finally , _",
    "milano _ had developed the experimental technique to investigate such extremely rare mode of decay @xcite .",
    "further , the crucial experiments @xciteare most notable inputs towards the description of cluster radioactivity .",
    "the review of last three decades show a regular interest covering both theory and experiment to explain the aspects of cluster and its exotic radioactivity till date @xcite .",
    "after the confirmed identification of nuclear sub - structure ( clustering ) , few questions arises in mind : ( i ) are they initially present inside the parent nucleus ( ii ) how they look like and ( iii ) what are the constituent of these clusters .",
    "hence , it is important to see the preformed cluster(s ) inside the decaying nucleus .",
    "several techniques are existed in literature to understand the clustering structure of the nuclear system .",
    "the prediction of @xmath2 structure of @xmath3c and @xmath4 of @xmath0o are already observed experimentally @xcite .",
    "the presence of these clusters inside a nucleus are due to the random distribution of density .",
    "statistically , the large magnitude in density distribution at cluster region from its surroundings indicates the maximum population of the nucleon(s ) .",
    "this may be a reason for cluster(s ) decay .",
    "the formation probability and decay half - life of these nuclei have been studied from last three decades by different peoples over the world @xcite . from these studies , one can find the most possible clusters are @xmath5he , @xmath6be , @xmath3c , @xmath0o , @xmath7ne , @xmath8 mg and @xmath9si having @xmath10 , which are integral multiple of the @xmath1-cluster ( @xmath11 ) .",
    "hence one can say , in case of lighter mass regions , the @xmath1-particle could be the constituent of emitted nuclei .",
    "recently , the theoretical predictions of clusters in lighter mass nuclei @xcite and some interesting phenomenon such as low - energy spectra of mg - isotopes @xcite , motivate us to look the the internal configuration of these nuclei using relativistic mean field formalism . in this context",
    ", the present work directed to a particular case for mg isotopes is taken up to examine the preformed clusters and their constituents .",
    "it is worth mentioning that , the rmf theory is very much successful in explaining the sub - atomic nuclei @xcite and the decays of these nuclei @xcite . because of its applicability",
    ", we have used rmf theory with the recently developed _ nl3@xmath12 _ @xcite and _ nl075 _ @xcite parameter sets to study the clustering phenomena .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : the relativistic mean field theory is described briefly in sec .",
    "2 including bcs pairing approach . in sec . 3 ,",
    "the details of our calculation and results are discussed .",
    "finally , the summary and concluding remarks are given in section 4 .",
    "in last few decades , the rmf theory is applied successfully to study the structural properties of nuclei throughout the periodic table @xcite starting from proton to neutron drip - lines . the relativistic lagrangian density for nucleon - meson many - body system",
    "is expressed as @xcite , @xmath13 here @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the masses for nucleon , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20- mesons and @xmath21 is its dirac spinor .",
    "the field for the @xmath18-meson is denoted by @xmath18 , for @xmath19-meson by @xmath22 and for @xmath20-meson by @xmath23 .",
    "the coupling constants for @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 mesons are @xmath27 , @xmath28 and @xmath29 , respectively .",
    "the self - coupling constants , @xmath30 and @xmath31 are for @xmath24meson and @xmath32=1/137 is the fine structure constant for photon . from the above lagrangian we obtained the field equations for the nucleons and mesons .",
    "these equations are solved by expanding the upper and lower components of the dirac spinors and the boson fields in an axially deformed harmonic oscillator basis with an initial deformation @xmath33 .",
    "the set of non - linear coupled equations is solved numerically by a self - consistent iteration method @xcite .",
    "the center - of - mass motion energy correction is estimated by the usual harmonic oscillator formula @xmath34 .",
    "the quadrupole deformation parameter @xmath35 is evaluated from the resulting proton and neutron quadrupole moments , as @xmath36 .",
    "the root mean square ( rms ) matter radius is defined as @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is the mass number , and @xmath39 is the deformed density .",
    "the total binding energy and other observables are also obtained by using the standard relations , given in @xcite . to deal with the open shell nuclei , we have adopted bcs - pairing method in a constant gap approximation @xcite .",
    "the expression for the pairing energy is given by : @xmath40 ^ 2,\\ ] ] where _ g _ is the pairing force constant and @xmath41 and @xmath42 are the occupation probabilities .",
    "the variational procedure with respect to the occupation numbers @xmath41 , gives the bcs equation ; @xmath43 and the gap @xmath44 is defined by @xmath45 the occupation number @xmath46 is defined as @xmath47.\\ ] ] the constant gap pairing for protons and neutrons are taken from refs .",
    "@xcite : @xmath48 with @xmath49 = 5.72 , @xmath50 = 0.118 , @xmath51 = 8.12 , @xmath52 = 1 , and @xmath53 .",
    "the chemical potentials @xmath54 and @xmath55 are determined by the particle numbers for protons and neutrons and the pairing energy is given as @xmath56 from the eqn .",
    "( 8) , it is clear that the pairing energy @xmath57 is not static even in the constant gap approach because it depends on the occupation probabilities @xmath58 and @xmath41 , which is directly connected with the deformation parameter @xmath35 ( spherical or deformed ) near the fermi surface .",
    "it is well known that @xmath57 diverges if it is extended to an infinite configuration space for a constant gap @xmath44 and strength parameters @xmath59 . however",
    ", a constant pairing gap is taken for simplicity of the calculations . within this pairing approach",
    ", it is shown that the results for binding energies and quadrupole deformations are almost identical with the predictions of relativistic - hartree  bogoliubov ( rhb ) approach @xcite near the proton - drip line .    [",

    "it is worth mentioning that the ranges are fixed by graphical method which is guided through eyes and may result some uncertainty .",
    "the values of the ranges for different clusters for some of the mg isotopes are listed in table 2 .",
    "the formula used to identify the ingredient of the cluster is given by @xcite : @xmath66 where , @xmath67 is the number of neutrons @xmath68 or protons @xmath69 or mass @xmath38 and @xmath63 ( @xmath64 , @xmath65 ) , @xmath60 ( @xmath61 , @xmath62 ) are the ranges . from the estimated proton and neutron numbers , we determine the mass of the cluster inside the nucleus .",
    "the obtained clusters for ground state of mg isotopes are listed in table 2 . from the table",
    ", we noticed the presence of @xmath0o and two @xmath5he along with few neutrons in @xmath70 mg .    as a further confirmatory test , here we compare the central density of @xmath0o and @xmath5he to the cluster density inside the core of @xmath71-isotopes .",
    "normally , the magnitude of the central density of @xmath5he and @xmath0o are @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively . here",
    ", the maximum value of the density correspond to these cluster region within the range @xmath74 , which matches to the normal density of @xmath0o .",
    "hence , this confirms , the constituent nucleus inside the cluster ( s ) region may either @xmath0o or the condensate @xmath75-particles .",
    "it could accept that the present study is a quantitative analysis for the internal structure of @xmath8 mg .",
    "this finding of @xmath0o and @xmath76he bubbles in @xmath8 mg is irrespective of nl3 * and nl075 forces , which shows the universality of the rmf formalism .",
    "as these are preformed clusters inside the nuclei , they may have high decaying probability .",
    "the existence of such bubble inside mg could be an interesting experimental observation .",
    "concluding , we have presented the gross nuclear properties like binding energy , deformation parameter @xmath35 , charge radii @xmath77 and the nucleonic density distributions for the isotopic chain @xmath78 mg using an axially deformed relativistic mean field formalism with @xmath79 and @xmath80 parameter sets .",
    "the results of our calculations show qualitative and quantitative agreement with the experimental observations .",
    "we found deformed prolate ground states solution for mg isotopes , which are consistent with the experimental data .",
    "analyzing the nuclear density distributions , the internal structure i.e. the clusters of mg isotopes are identified .",
    "we found sub - structure like @xmath0o or @xmath75 condensate types along with few more neutrons inside mg isotopes .",
    "it is also noticed that the cluster structure of a nucleus remain unaffected for different force parameters as long as the solution for that nucleus exist .",
    "it is interesting to see these evaporation residues like @xmath0o and @xmath76he for mg - isotopes in laboratory .",
