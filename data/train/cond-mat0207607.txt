    "very - low - energy electron diffraction ( vleed ) spectroscopy with incident electron energies below @xmath7  ev has recently been established as the experimental method giving a direct access to dispersions @xmath8 and lifetimes of quasi - particle states above the vacuum level ( see refs .   and references therein ) .",
    "the vleed spectral structures reveal the critical points in the surface - perpendicular dispersions @xmath9 of the states that couple to the incident electron beam to form the leed state .",
    "the fundamental advantage of the vleed spectroscopy over the conventional unoccupied band structure methods , such as inverse photoemission or x - ray absorption spectroscopy , is that it does not involve initial states and in particular cases , for example at high - symmetry lines parallel to the surface , is capable of restoring 3d bloch vectors @xmath10 .    within a quasi - particle picture",
    "@xcite the time - reversed leed states serve as the final states of the one - step photoemission theory .",
    "independent information on their dispersions and lifetimes provided by the vleed experiment can be used in the photoemission experiment to resolve the valence band structure in the surface - perpendicular direction , @xcite which is often blurred by the complicated non - free - electron - like dispersion and strong self - energy effects in the final states . in particular",
    ", the broadening of the vleed spectral structures provides information on the lifetimes of the final state quasi - particles , which can be used to estimate the @xmath11 broadening of the bloch constituents of the leed state and thereby to judge on the intrinsic uncertainty of the band mapping .    within a simplified one - particle approach",
    ", the leed problem reduces to solving the schrdinger equation for a semi - infinite crystal given the energy @xmath12 and the initial conditions of the incident electron , i.e. , the asymptotics of the wave function in the vacuum . in the plane parallel to the crystal surface the leed wave function obeys the bloch theorem and is characterized by the 2d bloch vector @xmath1 . in the vacuum , far from the crystal surface , it is a superposition of plane waves : the plane wave propagating towards the crystal defines incident current , and the total current carried by the leed state is the transmitted current . the ratio of the two currents is the transmission coefficient @xmath13 . in the bulk",
    "the leed wave function is a superposition of propagating ( real @xmath11 ) and evanescent ( complex @xmath11 ) bloch waves .",
    "this approach neglects inelastic scattering , so that in the case of a non - zero transmission the leed state necessarily includes a propagating bloch wave . in what follows the propagating constituents",
    "are referred to as conducting states .",
    "gross features of the @xmath13 spectrum depend upon the band structure of the bulk crystal : the energies at which the band ceases transmitting the current ( e.g. when the group velocity vanishes ) and other critical points are reflected in experimental spectra .",
    "for example , @xmath13 drops abruptly to zero when an energy gap in the @xmath1 projected band structure is encountered .",
    "however , owing to inelastic processes , one never observes zero transmission in the experiment , and instead of a sharp drop predicted by the simple theory one observes a rather smooth decrease of the transmission as a sign of the critical point .    in 1937",
    "slater @xcite showed that the broadening of the spectral structures and the absence of energy gaps can be reproduced by adding an imaginary term , the optical potential @xmath4 , to the potential in the crystal half - space .",
    "slater s idea is to associate the effect of the optical potential with a spatial damping of the wave functions rather than with a decay in time .",
    "then the bloch vector acquires an imaginary part of the order of @xmath14 ( @xmath15 is the group velocity ) , or , in terms of the mean free path @xmath16 , it is @xmath17 .",
    "the optical potential is , thus , understood as the inverse lifetime of the quasi - particle .",
    "alternatively , one can think of an electron with a lifetime @xmath18 and mean free path @xmath19 that moves in a real non - absorbing potential .",
    "@xcite in the present work we make an attempt to extract quantitative information on the energy dependence of @xmath5 from the measured @xmath13 spectra by comparing the broadening of experimental and calculated spectral structures .    the unoccupied band structures of layered quasi-2d materials , such as graphite @xcite or transition metal dichalcogenides , @xcite are particularly interesting : owing to the interlayer potential barrier , a nearly - free - electron model fails to provide even a qualitative picture of the unoccupied states . the necessity to describe such states within an all - electron approach for the crystal potential of general shape and to understand their relation to the diffraction process has been a driving force of the development of the bloch - wave - based _ ab initio _ methodology .",
    "@xcite in this work , we use the extended linear augmented plane wave ( elapw ) @xmath3 method , @xcite whose distinctive feature is that it reduces the inverse band structure problem  finding @xmath11 given @xmath1 and @xmath12  to a matrix eigenvalue problem .    of the layered materials , the band structure of 2h - nbse@xmath20 deserves special attention .",
    "its fermi surface comprises two cylindrical sheets and a tiny 3d electron pocket near the @xmath21 point , @xcite all having different superconducting properties .",
    "@xcite mapping of this pocket in the photoemission experiment is complicated by that its extension in @xmath22 is comparable with the final state @xmath22 broadening , @xcite and it relies critically on the knowledge of not only the final state dispersion but also lifetime .    in this paper , we present experimental electron transmission spectra of nbse@xmath20 and compare them to our _ ab initio _ calculations .",

    "essential details of our vleed experimental technique are given elsewhere .",
    "@xcite briefly , we used a standard 4-grid leed optics operating in the retarding field mode . in this mode",
    "the electrons are accelerated in the gun to the energies required to form a well - focussed beam ( normally from 100 to 300 ev ) and then decelerated in a retarding field between the gun and the sample .",
    "this mode allows us to achieve the lowest primary energies without any significant degradation in focussing .",
    "however , angle dependent measurements are complicated by that the retarding field distorts the off - normal electron trajectories . to determine @xmath23 ,",
    "we parameterized its dependence on energy @xmath12 and the sample rotation angle @xmath24 by a biquadratic function @xmath25 with the coefficients @xmath26 fixed by fitting to the experimental points with well - defined @xmath27 , namely to the angle dependent target current onsets , in which @xmath27=@xmath28 , and to the characteristic diffraction patterns when a diffracted beam hits the electron gun exit , in which @xmath29 equals half the surface reciprocal lattice vector @xmath30 ( see ref .   for details ) .",
    "the present experiment was carried out on an improved setup : screening from the stray magnetic fields using @xmath31-metal shielding reduced the displacement of the electron beam on the sample to less than 0.5 mm over the whole energy range .",
    "the position of the diffracted beams in the area obscured by the electron gun was controlled using a miniature fluorescent screen covered by zno : zn low - energy phosphor , @xcite which was mounted at the gun exit .",
    "careful adjustment of the incidence angles was achieved using a custom made sample holder with 3 angular degrees of freedom .",
    "this is particularly important for the flaky crystals of layered materials , whose surface after gluing to the sample holder can appear a few degrees off .",
    "the tilt angle adjustment was coupled to the linear shaft motion of our standard manipulator , and the azimuthal angle was adjusted using an additional fork mounted on a rotary wobble stick .",
    "this design guaranteed the incidence angle adjustment accuracy better than 0.25@xmath32 in all angular degrees of freedom . a symmetric design of the sample holder prevented distortion of the electron trajectories in the retarding field .",
    "the energy spread of the primary beam was @xmath330.25  ev hwhm .",
    "the size of the beam spot on the sample can be estimated as less than 0.5 mm through the whole experimental energy range .    as a practical matter , it should be noted that during the angle - dependent measurements the electron spot can slightly displace along the surface due to the retarding field and mechanical drifts in the manipulator . this displacement can be a problem for the layered materials , whose crystals closer to the periphery typically incorporate minor misoriented crystallites .",
    "the sample position should therefore be optimized to avoid the misoriented crystallites in the whole experimental energy and angle range .",
    "this can be controlled most easily by inspecting the diffraction patterns on the screen . in this respect",
    "the vleed experimental setups based on the leed electron optics have an advantage over the inverse photoemission based ones .",
    "the experimental system provided two measurement modes : 1 ) measurements of the elastic reflectivity into individual diffracted beams , often referred to as the vleed technique , using the leed screen and a ccd camera , and 2 ) measurements in the target current , commonly referred to as the target ( or total , absorbed ) current spectroscopy ( tcs ) technique ",
    "see , e.g. , ref .  .",
    "the vleed mode gives most detailed information about the diffraction process , but its principal limitation is that the reflected intensities in the area obscured by the electron gun can not be measured ( e.g. the specular beam near the normal incidence ) .",
    "the tcs mode is free of this problem and also benefits from greater experimental simplicity , but its limitation is that the target current @xmath34 gives the _ total _ reflectivity which includes the elastic reflectivity @xmath35 integrated over all diffracted beams and , in addition , the inelastic reflectivity @xmath36 corresponding to the secondary electrons that leave the crystal .",
    "the inelastic contribution gives , however , only a rather featureless background , so the structures in the @xmath34 curves reflect essentially the elastic electron transmission @xmath37 , which contain the band structure information ( the derivatives @xmath38 and @xmath39 are practically equivalent )",
    ".    the term vleed will further be used in reference to the dominant physical mechanism forming the spectral structures in the individual beams as well as in the total reflectivity , rather than to the experimental technique . in this context",
    "we will refer to the target current spectra also as the vleed spectra .",
    "atomically clean ( 0001 ) surfaces of nbse@xmath20 were obtained by standard cleavage in the vacuum chamber at a base pressure of @xmath40  mbar . compared to other layered materials ,",
    "the lifetime of the nbse@xmath20 surface is small : in a day after cleavage the spectral contrast significantly decreased and the background in the leed patterns increased , indicating strong surface contamination .",
    "the calculations are performed with the elapw @xmath3 method . @xcite the self - consistent potential was constructed within the local density approximation ( lda ) of the density functional theory with the full - potential augmented fourier components technique described in ref .  .",
    "the basis set included 487 energy independent apws ( energy cutoff 10.2  ry ) , and the extension of the radial basis set contributed another 200 basis functions .",
    "the extension was introduced following the prescriptions of ref .  .",
    "the brillouin zone ( bz ) integrations were performed by the tetrahedron method with a mesh of 550 * k * points that divides the irreducible bz into 2187 tetrahedra .    all the occupied states down to the nb 4@xmath41 semi - core band ( at -31  ev ) are treated as valence states . the density - of - states ( dos ) function is in good agreement with the flapw calculation of corcoran _",
    "et al_.  @xcite and with x - ray photoemission measurements of wertheim _",
    "et al_.  @xcite the five peaks due to the strong se 4@xmath41  nb 4@xmath42 hybridization have distinct counterparts in the experimental spectrum , see fig .  [ xps ] .",
    "the peak in the unoccupied dos at 2.7  ev arises from localized states of almost pure nb  @xmath42 character .",
    "thus , one can expect strong dipole - allowed transitions from the nb 4@xmath41 band to produce an absorption peak at @xmath43  ev ( see sec .  [ optics ] ) .",
    "we do not observe any localized states above @xmath44  ev ; the complicated fine structure of the dos curve for higher energies reflects a non - free - electron - like behavior of the unoccupied states .",
    "our calculations are based on the bloch waves approach to the leed problem , @xcite in which the crystal is treated as a semi - infinite system and the leed wave function in the crystal half - space is sought as a linear combination of propagating and evanescent solutions of the schrdinger equation for a bulk crystal potential .",
    "our implementation of the theory in the case of a singular all - electron crystal potential has been described elsewhere .",
    "@xcite now we briefly sketch the computational procedure .      in the elapw-@xmath3 method the complex band structure can be obtained by an analytical continuation of the schrdinger equation to the complex @xmath10 space . @xcite in application to semi - infinite systems , we use the elapw-@xmath3 method to solve the _ inverse band - structure problem _ : given two real cartesian components of the bloch vector @xmath45 and the energy @xmath12 , we find the values of @xmath11 that satisfy the schrdinger equation @xmath46 for the bloch vector with a complex @xmath47-component @xmath48 ( @xmath49 is a unity vector in the @xmath47-direction ) .    in the @xmath50 method the wave function of a bloch vector @xmath51 is a product of a trial function with the bloch vector @xmath52 and the phase factor @xmath53 $ ] . the trial function is a linear combination of the basis functions @xmath54 constructed at the reference point @xmath55 with a real @xmath56 : @xmath57    in terms of the coefficient vectors @xmath58 the inverse problem can be written as a matrix equation @xmath59\\vec{c}_n = 0 & , & \\\\",

    "( [ ikp ] ) , especially for complex matrices , results in prohibitively time - consuming calculations . @xcite",
    "it has turned out that the cpu time can be greatly reduced by orthogonalizing the original basis set , i.e. , by seeking the trial function in terms of the bulk hamiltonian eigenfunctions @xmath66 at @xmath67 rather than in terms of the basis functions @xmath54 .",
    "eliminating the overlap matrix alone makes the computing of eq .",
    "( [ ikp ] ) three times faster .",
    "the price for that is the necessity of recalculating the momentum matrix @xmath68 , which scales quadratically with the number of both basis functions and eigenfunctions . to further accelerate the procedure we cut the eigenvalue spectrum and retain only @xmath69 with energies lower than 5  ryd above the spectral interval we are interested in .",

    "represents the incident electron wave , and the other one the reflected wave , i.e. , @xmath91 .    thereby the functions @xmath73 are defined in the whole space and they are smoothly continuous everywhere .",
    "the leed function @xmath71 is sought as a linear combination of the functions that minimizes the value @xmath92 is the closest to a solution of the schrdinger equation in the surface region . by construction",
    "the trial function satisfies the schrdinger equation both in the bulk half - space and far from the surface in the vacuum , so that only a finite slab in the vicinity of the surface contributes to the integral ( [ tomin ] ) .",
    "this slab may include the part of the crystal where the potential strongly deviates from the bulk potential , but in this calculation we adopt a simplified step - like shape of the surface barrier , so the potential changes abruptly in the middle of the van - der - waals gap from its bulk distribution to the constant vacuum value . the generalization of the method to the case of an arbitrary potential in the interface region has been described in ref .  .",
    "the minimization procedure @xmath93 leads to a system of linear equations .",
    "if the auxiliary tails @xmath85 $ ] accidentally cancel then the result is equivalent to the simple matching of wave functions .",

    "@xcite if the exact matching is impossible the variational method yields a solution that is smoothly continuous by construction  this function is thought to be the best approximation for the leed function we seek .",
    "the accuracy of the ultimate result can be estimated _ a posteriori _ by checking the current conservation in the leed function , i.e. , by comparing the current transmitted into the crystal by the superposition of the propagating bloch waves @xmath73 to the current in the vacuum carried by the superposition of plane waves .",
    "the @xmath94 spectra along with the underlying real band structure are presented in fig .",
    "the @xmath95 calculation yields partial currents carried by the bloch states ( shown by whiskers ) .",
    "it reveals the conducting states responsible for the transmission of the current , thereby offering an interpretation of the vleed spectrum in terms of conducting fragments of the band structure : the abrupt changes in @xmath13 all reflect critical points in the conducting bands .",
    "the deviation of the @xmath70 points by the inverse elapw-@xmath3 from the @xmath9 lines by the direct method with the full basis is seen to be negligible .",
    "together with the reasonably small current non - conservation this justifies the basis set reduction we have undertaken to make the calculations feasible .",
    "a special feature of the normal incidence spectrum is that the conducting bands do not overlap , i.e. , there is only one dominant propagating constituent in the leed function . in this respect",
    "the picture is similar to that of the slater 1d model .",
    "@xcite the inclusion of the imaginary term lifts the principal difference between the propagating and evanescent waves ( whose properties to couple to the incoming wave may be very similar ) and thereby levels out the intensity variations ( see the dashed curve in fig .",
    "[ cb ] ) . in particular , already at a moderate value of @xmath96  ev the narrow gaps in the @xmath13 spectrum almost completely disappear , so one can hardly expect them to be observed in the experiment .",
    "wider gaps remain well visible , although the reflected intensities are strongly reduced and the structures broadened with respect to those predicted by a hermitian hamiltonian . in the next section we will use these properties of the slater theory to extract quantitative information about the damping of quasi - particles from the shape of experimental spectra .",
    "we shall now compare our measured target current spectra @xmath34 with the calculated transmission coefficient @xmath13 .",
    "first of all , we need to bring the @xmath34 spectrum to the same absolute units as @xmath13 .",
    "this is not trivial because of the presence of the unknown background caused by the secondary electrons contributing to the reflectivity . in view of the close similarity of the fine structure of the measured @xmath34 and theoretical @xmath98 spectra over a wide energy region ,",
    "see fig .",
    "[ ni ] , we have chosen to determine the _ experimental _",

    "the function @xmath100 represents a linearly varying background .",
    "strong intensity variations in the @xmath13 spectrum are much more important for the band structure information than the shape of the maxima,@xcite which are very broad even if the damping is neglected ( see fig .",
    "thus , for a conclusive comparison , the extrema of the @xmath101 function must be analyzed .",
    "owing to computational instabilities , theoretical @xmath13 curves contain numerical noise , which should be excluded before the derivative is calculated . to remove the jaggedness we average the @xmath13 function within an interval of width @xmath102 by fitting it to a parabola : for a given @xmath12 a parabola",

    "we have performed a series of calculations for the normal incidence with an energy independent @xmath5 ranging from 0.5 to 3  ev and considered the sharpness of each structure as a function of optical potential .",
    "three examples are shown in the right panel of fig .",
    "the value of sharpness from the left panel is taken to yield the value of the optical potential in the right panel .",
    "one immediately notices a sharp increase of the optical potential between 16 and 21  ev : the two minima change their shape very similarly with increasing the @xmath5 ( circles and diamonds in right panel of fig .",
    "[ si ] ) and the minimum at 21  ev in the experiment is significantly broader than the one at 16  ev ( see left panel of fig .",
    "[ si ] ) .",
    "the values of @xmath5 determined in this way are necessarily overestimated .",
    "first , in addition to the inelastic processes in the electronic system , there exist broadening mechanisms dependent upon experimental conditions , such as surface roughness and finite energy resolution .",
    "also the angular spread of the incident beam contributes to the broadening owing to the @xmath111 dispersion of spectral structures .",
    "secondly , our theoretical spectra do not take into account inelastic scattering in the surface barrier region , e.g. , scattering on the surface defects .",
    "this effect results in an additional reduction of the spectral structures but , unlike the inelastic scattering in the bulk , it hardly affects their energy broadening .",
    "these mechanisms should , however , be less significant for the layered materials because of the rather small electron density at the surface and a small concentration of defects on the cleaved surface .",
    "on the other hand , our absolute values of @xmath5 are in accord with the recent _ ab initio _ results on the quasi - particle lifetimes for noble and transition metals : @xcite for energies around @xmath44  ev the calculated lifetimes do not exceed a few fs ( @xmath112  ev ) .    the energy dependence @xmath104 derived from the experiment is presented in fig .",

    "the plot , however , reveals also differences in finer details , which reflects fundamental limitations of the theory employing a one - electron band structure and optical potential .",

    "in particular , this causes the higher width of the measured @xmath13 maxima between 25 and 29  ev than in the theory ( see the discussion in sec .  [ broadening_analysis ] ) .",
    "the difference is especially well visible between 0.2 and 0.4  @xmath76 .",
    "the discrepancies are seen to significantly increase above @xmath3340 ev : an overall shift of the experimental bands to higher energies is observed .",
    "the deviations are seen to increase at larger @xmath127 . from the band - structure point of view",
    "the main difference between the normal and off - normal incidence spectra is that in the latter case the conducting bands intersect ; in other words the leed state contains more than one propagating bloch constituent .",
    "an example for @xmath128k is shown in fig .",
    "[ kh ] , lower panel .",
    "the theoretical @xmath13 curve for negligible absorption ( solid line ) has a different character from the normal incidence spectrum ( fig .",
    "[ cb ] ) : there are no energy gaps in the band structure along the kh line , and the transmission never drops to zero and never reaches unity  it almost never exceeds 0.8 .",
    "thus , not only minima but also maxima are affected by the optical potential . also the positions of spectral minima strongly depend upon the function @xmath104 .",
    "for example , with increasing @xmath5 , the minimum at 19.6  ev moves away from its measured location towards lower energies and in the spectrum calculated with the energy dependent @xmath5 it appears at 17.9  ev . such a high sensitivity of results to a phenomenological parameter may be an important limitation of the theory .",
    "although the overall shape of the @xmath128k spectrum is well reproduced by the theory , the band structure information may be incorrectly transferred to the @xmath13 curve .",
    "presumably , the weak point is the presence of several propagating bloch waves in the band - structure decomposition of the leed function . in connecting the optical potential to the electron attenuation we basically rely on the relation im@xmath129 .",
    "the parameter @xmath5 is , thus , easy to operate when there is only one wave , but its meaning is not that transparent when there are several waves with different velocities ( which , in addition , are connected by the matching conditions ) .",
    "this point of view is supported by fig .",
    "[ ds ] in which we compare the measured @xmath127 dispersion of the @xmath13 minima with theoretical results for the energy dependent @xmath5 and for a constant moderately small @xmath5 of 0.5  ev .",
    "the latter results are expected to provide undistorted information on the band structure .",
    "one can see that whenever there is a disagreement between small @xmath5 and large @xmath5 results , for small @xmath130 the experimentally determined function @xmath104 brings the positions of the minima closer to the experiment ( areas a and b ) . on the contrary , for large @xmath130 the @xmath131  ev results are often closer to the experiment ( areas c and d ) .",
    "such deviations can be corrected by introducing a position dependent ( in general non - local ) @xmath5 , which would allow to control the behavior of the complicated leed state . in this case",
    "different bloch constituents would be damped differently depending on their spatial distributions .",
    "such an approach within the multiple - scattering formalism of vleed has been developed by barto _",
    "_ in ref .",
    "optical properties of the crystal provide independent information on the unoccupied band structure . within the one - particle theory ",
    "random phase approximation @xcite without local field effects  the calculations employ the same unoccupied bulk states as the leed calculations of sec .",
    "[ methodibs ] .",
    "the imaginary part of the dielectric function @xmath132 was calculated as an integral over the bz with the tetrahedron method ( for computational parameters see sec .",
    "[ bandstructure ] ) .",
    "the real part @xmath133 was determined out of @xmath132 by the kramers - kronig integration with the energy cutoff @xmath134  ev [ the values of @xmath132 above 38  ev are underestimated because of the finite number of bands taken into account  from nb 4@xmath41 ( -31  ev ) up to 38  ev above the fermi level . ]    in fig .  [ op ]",
    "we compare our _ ab initio _ results with the reflectivity measurements by liang @xcite and transmission energy loss spectrum by bell and liang .",
    "@xcite the experimental data are in excellent agreement with the calculations .",
    "the main plasmon peak at 21  ev corresponds to the termination of transitions from the 4@xmath42 valence band states .",
    "our calculations predict also a rather strong peak at 36  ev due to the transitions from the semi - core nb 4@xmath41 states to the unoccupied nb 4@xmath42 peak at @xmath135  ev ( see fig .",
    "[ xps ] ) .",
    "the high - energy plasmon is important to understand the energy dependence of the electron lifetime .",
    "angle - dependent vleed measurements in the target current mode have been performed on the layered 2h - nbse@xmath20 .",
    "tight control over the electron beam and adjustment of the incidence angle in three angular degrees of freedom enabled highly accurate measurements for the incidence wave vector @xmath111 scanning the @xmath2k line of the brillouin zone .",
    "based on the self - consistent band structure , _ ab initio _ vleed spectra have been calculated with the elapw-@xmath3 method , the inelastic scattering being modelled via the optical potential .    a novel methodological aspect is the algorithm to extract the information on the electron lifetime from the vleed experiment .",
    "the obtained results are consistent with available experimental and theoretical information on the dielectric function of nbse@xmath0 .",
    "owing to the complicated non - free - electron - like unoccupied band structure of nbse@xmath0 , the vleed spectra show rich structure over the energy region up to 50  ev above the fermi level . a good agreement between experiment and theory in the energy location of the tcs structures over the whole interval",
    "makes it possible to interpret the observed shape of the spectra in terms of the energy dependent optical potential .    the comparison of the experimental and theoretical results focusses on the surface - projected band structure represented by the @xmath111 dispersion of the extrema in the energy derivative of the transmission coefficient @xmath39 .",
    "a good agreement between the experiment and theory proves that our theoretical approach is capable of accurate description of the unoccupied bands of nbse@xmath20 .",
    "minor discrepancies have been observed , which are traced back to the imperfectness of our one - electron approach as well as to intrinsic shortcomings of the phenomenological treatment of inelastic scattering .",
