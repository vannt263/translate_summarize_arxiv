    "innovative energy harvesting devices are being developed to extract energy from geophysical flows such as wind or marine currents . the most common way to extract",
    "this energy is to convert it into the rotary motion of a dedicated structure , as wind turbines or marine turbines @xcite .",
    "even if these technologies are now mature from an industrial point of view , several other mechanisms to harvest this energy are currently being studied .    among them",
    ", a specific class is based on flow - induced vibrations @xcite .",
    "energy harvesting through fluid - elastic instabilities has been investigated , such as galloping @xcite , airfoil coupled - mode flutter @xcite and flutter in an axial flow @xcite .",
    "vortex - induced vibrations ( viv ) , a strong coupling between the solid dynamics and its fluctuating wake , are another interesting mechanism to extract energy from geophysical flows @xcite .",
    "@xcite for instance developed the vivace device to harvest energy by viv of elastically - supported rigid cylinders .",
    "a quantitative criterion is necessary to compare the performances of all these emerging technologies . as in @xcite , @xcite or @xcite",
    ", we define the efficiency of the harvesting , @xmath0 , as the ratio between the time - averaged extracted power @xmath1 , where @xmath2 stands for time - averaged quantities , and the energy flux across the cross - flow section @xmath3 of the device , @xmath4 ,    @xmath5    where @xmath6 and @xmath7 are respectively the fluid density and the flow velocity .",
    "there are of course many other ways to define the efficiency of an energy harvesting device , see for instance @xcite or @xcite . in such geophysical flows ,",
    "the energy density ( @xmath8 ) is low , of the order of 500 @xmath9 for typical wind speed ( 10 @xmath10 ) or current speed ( 1 @xmath10 ) .",
    "a large area @xmath3 is thus needed to access large quantitites of energy .",
    "this can be achieved either by considering many short devices , as in @xcite , or one single large structure , as considered in the present paper .    in the specific domain of viv",
    ", such large structures have been extensively studied for offshore engineering issues @xcite .",
    "viv of long cables consist of vortex - induced waves , which can be stationary or traveling @xcite .",
    "the excitation of the structure through lock - in , i.e. the synchronization between the vortex shedding and body oscillation , may occur successively for each vibration mode of the cable @xcite .",
    "placing long flexible structures , such as cables , in a cross - flow seems like a promising way to harvest energy from low velocity geophysical flows .",
    "yet the corresponding dynamics is much more complex than that of a rigid body , and it is necessary to explore how the efficiency depends on the parameters of the system . in the present paper ,",
    "this question is addressed through two reference configurations , using a classical reduced - order model , which is validated here in comparison with direct numerical simulations ( dns ) and experiments .",
    "the configuration of a tensioned cable with periodically - distributed harvesters is first investigated to study how the distance between harvesters and their respective intensity influence the efficiency . to analyze the impact of a single harvester , and to show the feasibility of the proposed energy harvester in practice ,",
    "the second configuration is a hanging cable with one harvester at its upper extremity , for which the tension is induced by gravity .",
    "section [ sec : model ] describes the model used throughout the paper . in section [ sec : rigid ] , the case of the elastically - mounted rigid cylinder is considered .",
    "sections [ sec : tensioned_cable ] and [ sec : string ] address the two reference cases of a cable with harvesters , introduced above .",
    "a comprehensive study of the impact on the efficiency of the system parameters using experiments or dns would be very time consuming and computationally expensive .",
    "a reduced - order model is therefore used in this study , based on the ones that have been developed for viv since @xcite .",
    "these models have been extended to long cables @xcite , and have been proven to predict accurately the main features of their dynamics , as well as some of their complex features like mode switching @xcite . in these models ,",
    "the fluctuating lift exerted by the wake on the bluff body is modeled by a single variable , @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is the instantaneous lift coefficient and @xmath13 the lift coefficient if the solid were fixed . in the wake - oscillator",
    "considered here , the evolution of @xmath14 is assumed to follow a van der pol oscillator equation ,    @xmath15    where @xmath16 stands for the derivative with respect to the dimensionless time @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the time and @xmath19 is the strouhal shedding frequency , st being the strouhal number , @xmath7 the flow speed and @xmath20 the solid diameter .",
    "equation is coupled with the solid equation by the forcing term @xmath21 .",
    "@xcite showed that an inertial coupling provides an accurate representation of viv , using @xmath22 , where @xmath23 is the solid dimensionless transverse displacement . in the following ,",
    "the values @xmath24 and @xmath25 are used @xcite , unless specified otherwise .",
    "energy harvesting induces a loss of energy for the fluid - solid system .",
    "it is thus represented in the remainder of the paper by a local viscous damping force , whose intensity is a key parameter of the problem .",
    "the efficiency of the energy harvesting by viv of an elastically - mounted rigid cylinder is first investigated , figure [ fig : scheme ] ( a ) .",
    "let @xmath26 be the mass per unit length of the cylinder .",
    "the natural frequency of the cylinder in still fluid may be expressed as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the total mass per unit length of the cable , including the added inertia .",

    "unless specified otherwise , we use @xmath39 , @xmath40 , @xmath41 , and @xmath42 @xcite .    following section [ subsec : harvesting ] , the harvested energy is defined and computed as the total energy dissipated by the structural damping @xmath43 . the system of equations and is integrated numerically using finite differences and a centered explicit scheme .",
    "the solid is initially at rest and the lift coefficient @xmath14 is subjected to a small random initial perturbation .",

    "the maximum efficiency , @xmath46 , is close to the value of 0.22 presented in @xcite .",
    "it is obtained under lock - in , which results in high - amplitude vibrations .",
    "more precisely , the optimal efficiency is reached for @xmath47 and @xmath48 , in the vicinity of the condition , @xmath49 . for each frequency ratio @xmath45",
    ", the efficiency follows a bell - shaped evolution with @xmath43 . at low damping parameters",
    ", @xmath0 is proportional to @xmath43 as viv amplitude saturates @xcite .",
    "the amplitude is proportional to @xmath50 at high damping parameters @xcite , and so is the efficiency .",
    "we have shown here that the wake oscillator model is a valuable tool to simply derive efficiency maps .",
    "moreover we have emphasized that high efficiencies are obtained under lock - in condition , in a region of the parameter space where the frequency of shedding matches the natural frequency of the cylinder .",
    "the successive lock - ins of the different vibration modes of a flexible structure may consequently lead to wider ranges of parameters leading to high efficiencies .",
    "energy harvesting by viv of cables is therefore explored in the next sections .",
    "in this section , the energy harvesting by cross - flow viv of an infinitely long tensioned cable with periodically - distributed energy harvesting devices is investigated , figure [ fig : scheme ] ( b ) .",
    "this discussion does not aim at describing how to implement theses devices , as obviously infinitely long cables can not be constructed .",

    "the vibration modes are identical .",
    "a good agreement is also observed between the model and the dns for predicting the traveling or stationary behaviour of the cable viv.figure [ fig : local_comparison ] shows the evolution of the efficiency @xmath44 with the two harvesting parameters , @xmath76 and @xmath43 . for both dns results and model predictions ,",

    "the number of the dominant mode , determined by a linear stability analysis , is also indicated and the heavy lines mark the boundaries between the dominance zones of each mode number . ]",
    "the optimal efficiency @xmath80 , reached for @xmath81 and @xmath82 , is close to the value of 0.23 obtained for a rigid cylinder , section [ sec : rigid ] .",
    "the efficiency @xmath0 depends significantly on both harvesting parameters @xmath76 and @xmath43 . except for @xmath83 ,",
    "where its variations are rather smooth , the efficiency varies dramatically with the reduced length @xmath76 .",
    "it exhibits discontinuities , which have already been pointed out infigure [ fig : local_comparison ] ( left ) , where the high impact of @xmath76 on @xmath0 is visible .",
    "the high - efficiency zones correspond to well - defined high efficiency tongues located in the high - damping region of the map ; these regions are analyzed in the following .",
    "the cross - flow motion of the cable for three sets of parameters leading to very different efficiencies are shown infigure [ fig : comp_modes ] . in order to characterize the cable dynamics ,",
    "the mode number @xmath84 is defined as    @xmath85    where @xmath86 is the wavelength of the viv . as the extremities of the cable",
    "are not fixed but damped , this mode number may not necessarily be an integer . in such cases , @xmath84 is defined as the closest integer to the ratio @xmath87 .",
    "when the harvesting parameters are optimal , the cable displacement corresponds to a mode 1,figure [ fig : comp_modes ] ( a ) , and to a mode 3 when @xmath71,figure [ fig : comp_modes ] ( c ) . in both cases ,",
    "the envelope of the oscillations also shows that the dashpots are moving , leading to an efficient extraction of energy . on the contrary , the energy harvesters are still when @xmath77 , for which the selected vibration mode has a mode number of @xmath88,figure [ fig : comp_modes ] ( b ) .",
    "the mode selected by the cable viv therefore seems to be a key parameter for the system efficiency .",
    "the dashpots are forced by the slope discontinuity between the two strands of the cable on either side of the harvesters , equation .",
    "this slope discontinuity is much larger when the mode number @xmath84 is odd compared with when it is even , as shown infigure [ fig : comp_modes ] ( d ) and ( e ) .",
    "this explains why the parameters for which an odd mode of vibration is excited lead to a much higher efficiency than the ones leading to an even mode .",
    "it is consequently important to identify the dominance zone of every vibration mode of the tensioned cable . to this end",
    ", a linear approach is used .     and ( a ) @xmath89 , corresponding to the optimal case for energy harvesting , @xmath90 ( b ) @xmath77 , @xmath91 and ( c ) @xmath71 , @xmath92 . a magnification of each plot",
    "is shown belowfigures ( a ) , ( b ) and ( c ) in order to visualize the displacement of the cable in the vicinity of the dashpots , @xmath93 . in eachfigure",
    ", the horizontal grey line shows the location of one energy harvester .",
    "sketches of the resulting forcing of the cable on the dashpot are also shown , in cases where the excited mode number is ( d ) odd and ( e ) even . ]      following the work of @xcite , @xcite have shown that a linear stability analysis of the viv model provides an accurate prediction of the frequency and wavelength of viv of a tensioned cable . the non - linear term @xmath94 of the wake - oscillator , equation ,",
    "is neglected and a stability analysis of the coupled linear system is performed .",
    "the most unstable linear mode is determined for each set of parameters @xmath76 and @xmath43 .",
    "the dominance zones of the cable vibration modes are reported on the efficiency map , figure [ fig : map_cable ] .",
    "there is a very good agreement between the dominance zones of the linear vibration modes and the complex structure of the efficiency map .",
    "the high efficiency regions of the parameter space correspond rigorously to the dominance zones of the odd vibration modes .",
    "this confirms that in practice , the harvesting parameters @xmath76 and @xmath43 should be chosen so that an odd mode number of the cable is excited , for the harvesting to be efficient . as for the case of an elastically - mounted rigid cylinder , section [ sec : rigid ] ,",
    "the high efficiencies are obtained under lock - in conditions , but for any of the odd modes .",
    "the structure of the efficiency map is therefore due to the dominance zones of the different vibration modes of the cable in viv .",
    "the eigenfrequency of the mode @xmath84 of a tensioned cable with fixed ends reads as    @xmath95    combining equation with the definition of @xmath76 , equation , leads to    @xmath96    the dimensionless length parameter , @xmath76 , corresponds to the ratio between the strouhal frequency and the successive eigenfrequencies of the tensioned cable .",
    "a match between the vortex shedding frequency , @xmath56 , and the natural frequency of mode @xmath84 , @xmath97 , is therefore observed for @xmath98 .",
    "these conditions notably locate the local maxima of @xmath0 within the dominance zone of each mode , figure [ fig : map_cable ] .",
    "the two harvesting parameters have to be chosen so that @xmath76 ensures that the shedding frequency is close to the natural frequency of an odd mode while @xmath43 has to be high enough to allow this particular mode to be excited ; at low damping , only even modes develop , as seen infigure [ fig : map_cable ] .",
    "the existence of several vibration modes is one of the fundamental characteristics of a flexible structure when compared to an elastically - mounted rigid cylinder .",
    "the cable adapts its viv dynamics to the wake forcing , through mode selection , which strongly impacts the efficiency of the harvesting , figure [ fig : map_cable ] .",
    "therefore , flexibility modifies the energy harvesting behaviour of the structure dramatically , compared to a rigid one , through this ability to adapt its dynamics via the lock - in of its successive modes .",
    "the previous section has shown that viv of long and flexible structures may be a relevant mechanism to harvest energy from geophysical flows .",
    "it is yet still necessary to look for an appropriate configuration with fewer harvesters . in this section ,",
    "a single energy harvester is considered .",
    "the cable is hung by an energy harvester at its upper extremity , the lower one being free , figure [ fig : scheme ] ( c ) .",
    "this configuration differs from the previous one by its gravity - induced tension , varying along the span of the cable , and by the asymmetry of its boundary conditions .",
    "the dimensionless cross - flow displacement @xmath64 and time @xmath99 are defined as in previous sections . following @xcite , the dimensionless spanwise coordinate",
    "is defined as @xmath100 where the characteristic length for the spanwise coordinate is @xmath101 .",
    "given these characteristic dimensions , there are two dimensionless harvesting parameters .",
    "the first one is @xmath102 , the dimensionless length of the hanging cable .",
    "the second one is the dimensionless damping parameter , @xmath103 .",
    "the energy harvesting by viv of a hanging cable was first studied experimentally ; then the results were compared with the predictions of an appropriate model .",
    "physical properties of the cable were @xmath104 , @xmath105 and @xmath106 .",
    "the cable was placed in uniform flow of constant speed @xmath7 in the water channel of the fluid - structure interactions laboratory of university of massachusetts , amherst , whose test section dimensions are 38 cm @xmath107 50 cm @xmath107 150 cm .",
    "the experimental setup was similar to that used by @xcite , except for the top dissipative boundary condition .",
    "the cable was hung by nylon strings and fixed to the dashpot , figure [ fig : schema_harvesting ] .",
    "the viscous damping was generated by a stick , immersed in an appropriate mixture of water and glycerol .",
    "this allowed adjusting the magnitude of the damping parameter by varying the proportion of glycerol .",
    "most of the uncertainty in the forthcoming results actually came from the uncertainty in the measurement of the damping parameter @xmath43 , obtained through water - glycerol mixture .",
    "the displacement of the upper end of the cable was measured with a laser displacement sensor micro - epsilon optoncdt ild1302 - 20 .",
    "the acquisition frequency was 256 hz .",
    "three flow speeds were tested , corresponding to different values of the dimensionless length parameter : @xmath108 , @xmath109 and @xmath110 .",
    "for each flow speed , measurements were taken for five damping values ranging from 0.1 to 20 .",
    "the measured displacement was filtered around its dominant frequency , close to the expected strouhal frequency @xcite . to avoid noise due to signal differentiation ,",
    "the numerator of equation was estimated as @xmath111 , with @xmath112 and @xmath113 the frequency and amplitude of the cable upper end oscillation .",
    "figure [ fig : eff_wo_manip ] shows the evolution of the efficiency with the damping parameter @xmath43 , derived from the experiments . for all values of @xmath76 , the efficiency shows a maximum , in the vicinity of @xmath114 .",
    "this configuration is also studied using the wake oscillator model coupled with a cable equation , as in the previous section , but taking into account the gravity - induced spatial variations of the tension and the specific boundary conditions .",
    "the model reads    + - ( z y^ ) ^ & = & m q , + + ( q^2 - 1 ) + q & = & a , [ eq : wo_corde_eff ]    with boundary conditions    @xmath115    at the lower end , @xmath65 , and upper end , @xmath116 , respectively .",
    "the lower end condition is obtained from the momentum balance for an arbitrary small end mass , and the upper end condition corresponds to a connection between a massless nylon string of length @xmath117 and the damper .",

    "it is clear that in this case , the mode selection has very little impact on the efficiency , contrary to the case of a tensioned cable , section [ sec : tensioned_cable ] .      in order to understand the dependence of the efficiency on @xmath43",

    "the flux is negative everywhere along the cable , except in the close vicinity of the dashpot , figure [ fig : string_dynamics ] ( a ) and ( c ) ; energy travels downwards and is dissipated by the flow in regions of high amplitudes of oscillations .",
    "conversely , the flux @xmath141 is positive and increases linearly along the span of the cable for the optimal @xmath43 .",

    "two configurations subjected to viv have been considered in this paper , a tensioned cable with periodic harvesters ( ph in the following ) and a hanging cable with a top harvester ( th in the following ) . in both cases , predictions of efficiency",
    "were presented using a model validated against dns and experiments .",
    "the first important result is that the optimal efficiencies of both configurations are close to that of an elastically - mounted rigid cylinder with a harvester , @xmath147 .",

    "should be installed in a flow of given velocity @xmath148 , the optimal dimensional power generated by one harvester , @xmath1 , is computed using the optimal parameters identified in sections [ subsec : efficiency_cable ] and [ subsec : eff_corde ] .",
    "the mean flow velocity indeed impacts the optimal dimensional power @xmath1 through the energy flux @xmath149 and the optimal value of @xmath53 , with @xmath53 the distance between two harvesters for ph case and @xmath53 the length of the system for th case .",
    "the optimal harvested power scales differently with the dimensional flow velocity @xmath148 ,      the th configuration seems more adapted to lower flow velocities and the ph to higher ones .",
    "this is illustrated infigure [ fig : scaling ] , for a given cable ( @xmath151 and @xmath152 ) and a given tension for the ph case ( @xmath153 ) , where the crossing point of the two configurations is near @xmath154 . clearly , the systems are more adapted to rather low flow velocities and thus low generated power , since the optimal power may vary like @xmath155 for other energy harvesting systems .",
    "the two configurations differ in terms of their robustness versus possible variations of the flow velocity around the design point .",
    "this appears in the efficiency maps , figures [ fig : map_cable ] and [ fig : map_string ] , where the ph case shows discontinuities while the th case exhibits smoother variations of efficiency with the parameters.figure [ fig : sensitivity_speed ] shows the effect on the efficiency of the actual velocity @xmath7 , normalized by the reference value at design , @xmath148 , for the two cases .",
    "the ph case exhibits ranges of zero efficiency , while the th case varies more regularly .",
    "these evolutions result from the efficiency maps discussed above , knowing that @xmath156 and @xmath157 in the ph case while @xmath158 and @xmath43 is independent of @xmath7 in the th case .",
    "the th case seems much more robust . yet",
    ", a simple solution exists to regularize the efficiency of the ph case , by having a tension that is induced by a drag force , @xmath159,figure [ fig : sensitivity_speed ] . in that case , the natural frequencies of the structural modes vary simultaneously with the vortex shedding frequency and lock - in is preserved on the lowest mode .",
    "altogether , viv of cables with localized harvesters seem a promising way to harvest energy from low velocity geophysical flows . considerable work , however , remains to be done to design real harvesters , but the simplicity of the flexible structures is a clear advantage in terms of building and maintenance",
