    "the first planetary nebula ( pn ) belonging to a globular cluster ( gc ) was discovered more than 85  years ago , in m15 ( pease 1928 ) .",
    "it was another six decades before a second gcpn was found , this time in m22 ( gillett et  al .  1989 ) .",
    "jacoby et  al .",
    "( 1997 , hereafter jmf97 ) then carried out a systematic ground - based ccd survey of 133 milky way gcs , using a narrow - band [ ] 5007    filter along with a filter in the neighboring continuum .",
    "they discovered two more pne , in the galactic clusters ngc  6441 and pal  6 .",
    "the number of pne known in gcs in the local group was raised to five by the serendipitous discovery of a pn in the cluster h5 belonging to the fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy ( larsen 2008 ) . outside the local group ,",
    "[ ] emission has been detected in the integrated light of a handful of gcs during spectroscopic investigations , as summarized by minniti & rejkuba ( 2002 ) , zepf et al .",
    "( 2008 ) , chomiuk , strader , & brodie ( 2008 ) , and peacock , zepf , & maccarone ( 2012 ) .",
    "( however , as discussed in  5 , not all of these distant emission sources are actually pne . )",
    "pne in gcs raise two issues related to stellar evolution .",
    "the first is _ why are there so few pne in gcs ? _ jmf97 posed this question because one would expect to find @xmath016 pne in the milky way gcs on the basis of the total luminosity of the galactic gc system , a pn lifetime of @xmath02@xmath1  yr , and the assumption that every star produces a visible pn near the end of its life .",
    "( the prediction comes basically from an application of the `` fuel - consumption theorem , '' as defined by renzini & buzzoni 1986 . ) in order to explain the smaller number actually observed , jmf97 suggested that the assumption that every star produces a pn may be incorrect in gcs .",
    "in fact , single stars in very old populations , having started their lives at about @xmath2 , leave the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) with masses reduced to as low as @xmath0@xmath3 ( alves , bond , & livio 2000 ; hereafter abl00 ) to @xmath0@xmath4 ( kalirai et al .",
    "2009 ) . the theoretical post - agb evolutionary timescales of such low - mass remnants are so long ( e.g. , schoenberner 1983 ) that any nebular material ejected at the end of the agb phase has time to disperse before the central star becomes hot enough to ionize it .",
    "thus , the single stars now evolving in gcs would not be expected to produce any visible ionized pne .",
    "now the question becomes _ why are there any pne in gcs at all ? _ the answer probably lies in the evolution of binary stars .",
    "there are ( at least ) two ways that binaries can produce pne in populations in which single stars can not .",
    "( 1 )  coalescence of two stars in a binary near the main sequence could produce first a blue straggler , and eventually a higher - mass post - agb remnant that _ would _ evolve rapidly enough to ionize a pn .",
    "abl00 detected no photometric variations for k648 , the central star of the pn ps  1 in m15 , consistent with it being a merger remnant .",
    "( 2 )  or a red giant or agb star may undergo a common - envelope ( ce ) interaction with a companion , rapidly exposing the giant s hot core , and thus promptly subjecting the ejecta to ionizing radiation . these and other scenarios to account for the presence of pne in gcs have been discussed by abl00 , ciardullo et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , buell ( 2012 ) , jacoby et al .",
    "( 2013 ; hereafter jcd13 ) , and others .",
    "they are part of a larger conceptual framework in which it has been increasingly recognized that binary interactions are likely to be a major , if not dominant , formation channel for pne in all populations ( e.g. , bond & livio 1990 ; bond 2000 ; de  marco 2009 ; and references therein ) .",
    "the binary - merger hypothesis can be tested by determining the luminosities of central stars of pne in gcs , and then inferring their masses from theoretical core - mass / luminosity relations .",
    "abl00 used the wide field planetary camera  2 ( wfpc2 ) on the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) to carry out photometry of k648 .",
    "the absolute luminosity of the star implied a mass of @xmath5 .",
    "this is significantly higher than the masses of remnants of single stars in gcs ( see above ) , giving the star a fast enough post - agb evolution for it to have ionized the ejecta before they had time to dissipate .",
    "abl00 concluded that the central star must have achieved its high mass as a result of a merger .",
    "_ hst _ imaging of all four pne in galactic gcs , and photometry of their central stars , have been collected and discussed by jacoby et al .",
    "( 2014 , 2015 ) .",
    "apart from k648 , the evidence for high stellar masses resulting from binary mergers has remained less compelling .",
    "in fact , if the pn were ejected as a consequence of a ce interaction , the mass of its central star would be unlikely to differ much from those of remnants of single - star evolution , or could even be lower .",
    "jacoby et al",
    ".  do , however , argue that the morphologies of these gcpne are at least suggestive of ejection from a binary interaction .",
    "a potential test is to search for x - ray emission , arising from a synchronously rotating , active , late - type companion star to the pn nucleus .",
    "variable x - ray emission from k648 has in fact been detected by hannikainen et al .",
    "( 2005)which , if due to the central star rather than the surrounding pn , would argue against the merger scenario i discussed above .",
    "further progress could be made with a larger sample than the five known pne in the milky way and fornax gc populations .",
    "there are many hundreds of gcs known in the andromeda galaxy , m31 ; and smaller numbers are known in m33 , the magellanic clouds , and other members of the local group . as noted by many authors , galaxies like m31 have experienced different evolutionary histories than our galaxy , which might be reflected in systematic differences in their gc systems ( e.g. , van den bergh 2010 and references therein ) . conceivably , for example , there could be a population of gcs with intermediate rather than extremely old ages , which would be richer in pne than the milky way gcs .",
    "jcd13 obtained integrated spectra of 274 old gcs in m31 , searching for emission at [ ] 5007    that would indicate the presence of a pn in the cluster .",
    "three candidate pne were found among this sample of old gcs . in the complementary survey discussed here ,",
    "i have used _ hst _ to search for pne in gcs belonging to local group galaxies , especially m31 , by obtaining direct narrow - band [ ] images .",
    "in my search for pne in local group gcs , i used _ hst _ in its `` snapshot '' mode , in which short exposures are inserted into gaps in the telescope schedule that remain once the primary observations have been sequenced as optimally as possible .",
    "my observations were made during two _ hst _ proposal cycles . in cycle  16",
    "( program i d snap-11218 ) i submitted a list of 125 target gcs , of which 41 were successfully observed . in cycle  17",
    "( snap-11714 ) i submitted 100 targets , of which 23 were observed .",
    "the cycle  16 observations were made with wfpc2 , from 2007 july  10 to 2008 november  23 . in cycle  17 , i used the uvis channel of the newly installed wide field camera  3 ( wfc3 ) , and these observations were made between 2009 september  1 and 2011  september 29 .",
    "nine of the cycle  17 observations were repeats of wfpc2 targets , using the more sensitive wfc3 .",
    "eleven additional gcs were serendipitously present in the frames along with the primary targets , for a total of 66 unique clusters , belonging to eight different galaxies .      the list of candidate targets for both",
    "cycles was developed as follows .",
    "the overall aim was primarily to maximize the total integrated luminosity of the cluster sample , in order to maximize the probability of discovering pne ; and secondarily to provide targets widely distributed across the sky .",
    "( 1 )  for the magellanic clouds , i chose the 8 `` population  ii '' clusters with integrated visual absolute magnitudes of @xmath6 , as listed by olszewski , suntzeff , & mateo ( 1996 , their table  1 ) .",
    "( 2 )  in m33 , i selected the 5 brightest red ( i.e. , old ) gcs listed by christian & schommer ( 1988 , their table  vii ) ; all of them are brighter than @xmath7 ( @xmath8 ) . ( 3 )  in the dwarf irregular galaxies ngc  6822 and wlm , i chose hubble  vii in the former , and wlm-1 in the latter .",
    "hubble  vii , with an integrated @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) is an old , metal - poor gc ( e.g. , wyder , hodge , & zucker 2000 ) .",
    "wlm-1 is the lone gc known in its galaxy , and is also very old ( e.g. , hodge et al .  1999 , who give @xmath11 and @xmath12 ) .",
    "( 4 )  for the fornax dwarf spheroidal , out of its five known gcs i included the two bright clusters ngc  1049 and h2 , for which strader et al.(2003 ) give @xmath13 magnitudes of 12.6 and 13.5 ( @xmath14 and @xmath15 ) .",
    "( 5 )  for the dwarf elliptical ngc  147 , i selected hodge  ii , with a @xmath13 magnitude of 16.5 ( sharina et al .",
    "2006 ) , corresponding to @xmath16 .",
    "( 6 )  i then selected gcs in the m31 system in order of increasing integrated @xmath13 magnitudes from the catalog of galleti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) , which is maintained online , until the target lists were filled to the allocated numbers .",
    "these lists contained clusters with integrated @xmath13 magnitudes ranging from 13.8 to 16.8 ( @xmath17 to @xmath18 ) .      with both wfpc2 and wfc3 ,",
    "i observed each cluster in the narrow - band f502n [ ] 5007    filter , and the broad - band f555w  @xmath13 \" filter .",
    "exposure times for most of the gcs were @xmath19  s and @xmath20  s in f502n and f555w , respectively , for wfpc2 , or @xmath21",
    "s and @xmath22  s in f502n and f555w for wfc3 .",
    "for the nearby magellanic cloud gcs , the wfpc2 exposures were shortened to @xmath23  s and @xmath24  s.    the field of view of wfpc2 is @xmath25 for the pc chip ( i placed the target gcs near the corner of the pc field least affected by charge - transfer inefficiency [ cti ] ) , plus @xmath26 for each of the three neighboring wide - field ( wf ) chips .",
    "the plate scale is @xmath27 for pc , and @xmath28 for the wf . for the wfc3 imaging",
    "i centered each target in a @xmath29 pixel subarray , and the plate scale is @xmath30 , giving a field of view of @xmath31 .",
    "table  1 lists the 66 gcs that were imaged .",
    "the nomenclature is as given in  2.2 ; for m31 i have used the designations of the galleti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) and peacock et al .",
    "( 2010 ) catalogs .",
    "column  2 gives their integrated visual absolute magnitudes , calculated using integrated @xmath13 magnitudes and distances and reddenings from the sources cited in the previous subsection .",
    "serendipitously , nine of the wfpc2 frames contained a second , usually fainter gc in one of the wf chips , as indicated in the footnotes to the table .",
    "in one case , the smaller wfc3 field contained a second cluster : ngc  147 hodge  iii ( @xmath32 , @xmath33 ) was in the field of view when hodge  ii was observed .",
    "all exposures were dithered for cosmic - ray removal by taking two exposures in each filter and moving the telescope pointing by a few pixels between exposures .",
    "for the wfpc2 frames , i used iraf routines to align and combine them , while for wfc3 i used the pipeline drizzle - combined images from the _ hst _ archive .",
    "a pn will be bright in the narrow - band f502n filter centered near the emission line of [ ] at 5007   .",
    "the broad - band f555w filter also transmits at 5007    ( where the system throughput is actually higher than for f502n ) , as well as at other emission lines in pne , the strongest of which are [ ] 4959   , h@xmath34 and h@xmath35 , and 5876   . to estimate the expected relative count rates for a typical pn in these two filters , i used the line intensities for the halo pn bobn  1 given by otsuka et al .",
    "i convolved them with the system throughputs for both cameras in the two filters , as given in the respective _ instrument handbooks _",
    "( wfpc2 : mcmaster & biretta 2008 ; wfc3 : bond & quijano 2007 ) .",
    "the resulting predicted count - rate ratios for the pn are @xmath36 for wfpc2 , and 2.1 for wfc3 .",
    "drizzled wfc3 images from the _ hst _ archive are in units of counts  @xmath37 , so a typical pn would be approximately twice as bright in f555w as in f502n",
    ". however , wfpc2 images from the archive pipeline give total counts accumulated during the exposure .",
    "since the ratio of exposure times was @xmath38 ( in most cases ) for wfpc2 , the ratio of expected integrated counts for a pn in the two filters is thus @xmath39 .",
    "by contrast , a star will appear much brighter in the broad - band f555w filter than in narrow - band f502n .",
    "for a typical gc red giant , the count - rate ratios for a star will be @xmath40 and 30 for wfpc2 and wfc3 , respectively ( the wfc3 ratio being smaller because its f502n bandpass is wider than the one used in wfpc2 ) .    at the distance of m31 , the fwhm of stellar images in _ hst _ frames of @xmath0@xmath41 corresponds to a linear diameter of @xmath00.2  pc .",
    "all but the largest pne will appear essentially stellar at this resolution .",
    "thus i searched the images for point sources of comparable brightness ( within factors of @xmath02 or 0.5 , depending on the camera ) in both filters , and rejected sources that were considerably brighter in f555w .",
    "i did this using two different methods : ( 1 )  first i simply visually blinked the f502n and f555w images .",
    "this technique works very well , because there are relatively few point - like sources detected in the f502n frames , especially with wfpc2 , and those that are present are therefore conspicuous .",
    "apart from the rare true pne , nearly all of the apparent sources seen at f502n fell into two categories : ( a )  bright stars ( mostly gc red giants ) , easily recognized because they are much brighter in the f555w frames , and ( b )  spurious artifacts , particularly cases where cosmic rays struck the same pixels in both of the f502n frames that were combined , sometimes producing artifacts that resemble real sources ; however , these are also very easy to recognize and reject because they lack counterparts in the f555w images .",
    "( this valuable check would not have been possible if a broad - band filter had been chosen that rejected the 5007    line . ) ( 2 )  it was , however , difficult to blink the images near the centers of the gcs , because of the high surface brightness in the f555w frames .",
    "thus i also created an image of each gc in which i calculated the ratio of the two frames , and searched them ( again visually ) with a display windowing that emphasized sources with similar count rates in both filters .",
    "this method worked well in the centers of the clusters .",
    "as noted above , the target clusters were placed in the pc chip of wfpc2 ; however , i also searched the three neighboring wf chips , and found several new pne in the fields surrounding the gcs , as well as recovering many previously cataloged pne .",
    "i also searched the entire frames taken with wfc3 , likewise finding a few field pne .",
    "figure  1 illustrates the two search techniques . in the example",
    "shown , i independently recovered a known field pn in m31 , no .  285 in the catalog of ford & jacoby ( 1978 ) .",
    "the left frame shows the f502n [ ] image , with the pn marked in the center , and also showing a bright star to the lower left .",
    "the middle frame shows the @xmath13-band f555w image ; now numerous stars are also detected , and the field star is much brighter , but the pn is nearly unchanged .",
    "the right frame shows the ratio image , f502n",
    "/ f555w , with the display stretched to show objects that have similar brightnesses in both frames and reject sources with low f502n / f555w ratios .",
    "now the stars have disappeared , leaving only the pn , and verifying that it is a source emitting at 5007   .",
    "i determined a nominal limiting magnitude for the wfpc2 f502n frames as follows .",
    "i marked apparent point - like stellar sources on a frame of the well - resolved fornax  h2 cluster over a range of brightnesses from obvious detections down to sources so faint that they were likely to be spurious .",
    "( by 20078 , the wfpc2 , which had been onboard _ hst _ since 1993 , was suffering badly from cti and hot pixels in addition to the usual cosmic - ray hits , leading to the presence of many low - level streaks and other artifacts in these frames . )",
    "i then compared the f502n frame with the f555w frame to determine which of the marked sources had brightened ( indicating that they were real stars ) or disappeared ( indicating that they were artifacts ) .",
    "i found a strong cutoff at a flux level such that 100% of the sources brighter than this level were real , but below this level the fraction of spurious detections rose rapidly .",
    "i then calibrated this flux level , using aperture photometry and the reduction procedure described in the _ wfpc2 data handbook _ ( gonzaga & biretta 2010 ,  5.2.5 ) .",
    "i included cti corrections as formulated by dolphin ( 2009 ) .",
    "the resulting limiting line flux for the wfpc2 frames is @xmath42 .",
    "it is customary in work on extragalactic pne ( e.g. , ciardullo et al .",
    "1989 ) to use `` [ ] @xmath435007 magnitudes , '' defined by @xmath44 . on this scale , the source detections in my wfpc2 f502n frames",
    "are complete to @xmath45 . at the distance of m31 , this limit reaches more than 3.5  mag into the pn luminosity function in the andromeda bulge ( e.g. , fig .  9 in jcd13 ) .",
    "this magnitude limit applies to isolated sources .",
    "the limit is brighter in the central regions of gcs , due to the bright backgrounds and source confusion . using artificial - star experiments ( i.e. , adding an artificial pn image to the center of a gc ) ,",
    "i find that the limiting magnitude is about 0.9  mag brighter , or about @xmath46 , at the center of a m31 gc of typical central surface brightness .    for wfc3 ,",
    "the limiting magnitudes are considerably fainter , since wfc3 is a factor of @xmath03.2 more sensitive , has lower readout noise , and was very considerably less affected by cti than was wfpc2 at the late stage of its lifetime .",
    "the wfc3 frames are cosmetically quite superior to the wfpc2 images , exhibiting very few low - level artifacts apart from occasional instances of a cosmic ray striking the same pixels in both f502n images . using the same techniques",
    ", i estimated that the limiting detection magnitude for the wfc3 exposures was @xmath47 for isolated sources , and again about 0.9  mag brighter for pne at the centers of typical m31 gcs .",
    "i found only one out of the 66 gcs that were imaged in the two snapshot programs to have nearby candidate [ ] @xmath435007 emission sources .",
    "i identified two sources in the vicinity of the m31 cluster b086 , as shown in figure  2 .",
    "details of these sources are given in table  2 .",
    "the brighter of them , here designated m31",
    "b086 - 2 , has been cataloged previously by meyssonnier , lequeux , & azzopardi ( 1993 ; no .",
    "481 in their list of unresolved emission - line objects in m31 ) , and by azimlu , marciniak , & barmby ( 2011 ; no .",
    "1596 in their catalog of objects considered to be regions in m31 ) .",
    "the fainter source , m31  b086 - 1 , has to my knowledge not been cataloged previously .",
    "both objects appear to be unresolved at wfc3 resolution .",
    "i converted the measured count rates for both of them to @xmath48 magnitudes , using the wfc3 photometric zero - points given online .",
    "results are in table  2 . since both sources are unresolved , and have values of @xmath48 consistent with those of pne in m31 , it appears plausible that they are pne ( although it can not be ruled out entirely that either one is a symbiotic binary , nova at the nebular stage , a very compact region , or other 5007   - emitting source ) .",
    "however , b086 lies in a very rich field only @xmath49 from the nucleus of m31 , and fairly near a spiral arm and dust lane .",
    "moreover , both pn candidates , at separations of @xmath50 and @xmath51 from the center of b086 , are well outside the half - light radius of b086 , measured on my images to be @xmath52 .",
    "thus , in the absence of a spectroscopic followup and radial - velocity confirmation , it is questionable whether either object is physically associated with b086 .",
    "if the brighter source had been centered in the gc , it would have added only 3.5% to the flux of the cluster within a diameter of @xmath53 , in a bandpass similar to that of the f502n filter .",
    "the fainter source would constitute only 0.6  % of the cluster flux if centered in the cluster .",
    "thus , ground - based direct imaging would be unlikely to have detected either pn candidate if located near the cluster center .",
    "b086 was observed by jcd13 , but since my pn candidates would have been well outside their spectroscopic fiber aperture , it is not surprising that they were not detected .",
    "in the course of examining the _ hst _ frames , i noted a number of candidate @xmath54 sources in the fields surrounding the target gcs .",
    "these field sources are listed in table  3 .",
    "although they are too distant from the gcs to be considered cluster members , i give them designations based on the name of the target cluster .",
    "as an index of my survey completeness , i include previously cataloged objects that i independently recovered , as well as new discoveries .",
    "the table includes @xmath48 values measured from my material ; i adjusted the zero - point for these magnitudes so as to match the absolute line fluxes listed by ciardullo et al .",
    "( 1989 ) for the sources in common .",
    "the rms scatter was 0.2  mag , consistent with the moderately low snr of the wfpc2 [ ] snapshot images .",
    "the final column in table  3 gives cross references for the previously known sources .",
    "nearly all of the sources brighter than @xmath55 have been cataloged previously .",
    "all of the listed objects appear stellar at _ hst _ resolution , making it likely that most of them are pne , even though some were included in earlier compilations of regions .",
    "however , one object appears to coincide with a classical nova .",
    "i augmented my snapshot observations by searching the _ hst _ archive for frames taken by other investigators with any of the _ hst _ cameras , using a [ ] f502n filter , in the vicinity of m31 , and then checking whether any gcs were within the fields of view .",
    "surprisingly , only two _ hst _ programs , other than my own , have ever used this filter at pointings lying within @xmath56 of the center of m31 .",
    "fortuitously , 12 cataloged gcs lie within the fields observed in these two programs .",
    "images were obtained with the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) or wfc3 , as listed in table  4 .",
    "three of these clusters had also been imaged in my snapshot survey , so the grand total number of local group gcs outside the milky way imaged by _",
    "hst _ in a f502n filter is 75 .",
    "the f502n images in the two archival programs were accompanied either by frames in f547 m or f550 m ( which exclude the 5007    emission line ) or in f555w ( which includes 5007    as described above ) . out of the 12 clusters ,",
    "one very convincing pn candidate was found within the m31 cluster b477 , as illustrated in figure  3 .",
    "details are given in table  4 .",
    "this emission - line object had been listed by walterbos & braun ( 1992 ; no .",
    "683 , which they described as being unresolved , in their catalog of h@xmath34/ [ ] sources in m31 ) , and by merrett et al .",
    "( 2006 , hereafter mmd06 ; no .  446 in their catalog of pne in m31 ) .",
    "the @xmath48 value in table  4 is quoted from mmd06 .",
    "m31-b477 was not one of the clusters observed spectroscopically by jcd13 , and the association with the star cluster has apparently not been recognized until now .",
    "b477 is , however , not considered to be an old gc of the type targeted in my snapshot survey : kang et al .",
    "( 2012 ) give an age of only 325  myr , based on _ galaxy evolution explorer _ uv photometry .",
    "morphologically , b477 also does not resemble a gc , as can be seen in figure  3 .",
    "the present imaging survey is complementary in several ways to the ground - based spectroscopic search for pne in the m31 gcs carried out by jcd13 .",
    "my survey concentrated on the brightest gcs in m31 ( and the rest of the local group ) , while their large - scale spectroscopic program targeted a wide range of cluster luminosities in m31 .",
    "their method is particularly favorable for pne in fainter gcs , in which there is less dilution of the pn 5007    emission by cluster starlight in the integrated spectrum .",
    "their spectroscopic apertures had diameters of @xmath57 , which captures most of the cluster light but would still miss more widely separated pne , whereas i covered the entire cluster plus a large surrounding field .",
    "jcd13 observed 274 old gcs in m31 , as compared to only 75 imaged in my survey ( plus two archival programs ) throughout the local group .",
    "of the 56 gcs in m31 that i observed or had archival f502n images , jcd13 obtained spectra of 39 of them .",
    "jcd13 were able to reach fainter limiting magnitudes than my wfpc2 frames , down to about @xmath58 vs.  my 24.1 , because they used a larger telescope ( 3.5 m vs.  2.4 m ) , and much longer integration times ( 210  minutes vs.  6001000  s ) .",
    "the limiting magnitudes for my wfc3 frames are , however , similar to those of jcd13 .",
    "the spectroscopic observations are susceptible to spurious detections of ambient [ ] emission from diffuse nebulae superposed on the gc , whereas direct high - resolution imaging of point sources does not suffer from this problem .",
    "one inadequacy of direct imaging in [ ] is that it does not provide a line profile , line ratios such as [ ] /h@xmath35 , or other spectroscopic information , all of which help discriminate pne from other emission - line sources .",
    "for example , zepf et al .  (",
    "2008 ) found very broad [ ] emission from a source within a gc in the virgo galaxy m49 , attributed to an accreting black hole ( bh ) rather than a pn .",
    "irwin et al .",
    "( 2010 ) found [ ] emission , unaccompanied by balmer emission , from a gc in the fornax galaxy ngc1399 ; they discussed this source in terms of a white - dwarf being tidally disrupted by an intermediate - mass bh , and alternative non - pn scenarios for this object have been proposed by maccarone & warner ( 2011 ) and clausen et al.(2012 ) .",
    "jcd13 found candidate pne in three old gcs in m31 : nb89 , b115 , and bh16 .",
    "of these , only nb89 was observed in my snapshot programs , and only because it happens to lie a few arcseconds away from the bright primary target gc b127 .",
    "much deeper _ hst _ [ ] imaging of nb89two exposures of 2700  s each  was obtained in the archival wfc3 program go-12174 , as summarized in table  4 .",
    "the pn candidate in nb89 has @xmath59 according to jcd13 .",
    "an isolated point source this bright would have been detected easily in the deep wfc3 frames , yet no 5007    point source is seen in the images . it is conceivable that the pn coincides exactly with a red giant in the cluster .",
    "however , a more likely possibility is that the emission arises from ambient nebular emission that filled jcd13 s aperture , rather than from a point source  indeed , jcd13 raised this as a strong possibility .",
    "in fact , nb89 does lie exactly superposed on a filament of the spiral - shaped emission region discovered by ciardullo et al .",
    "( 1988 ) in their deep ground - based h@xmath34 imaging of the m31 nucleus .",
    "although it is unclear whether this low - excitation region has sufficiently strong 5007    emission for this explanation , the lack of a point - like source in the _ hst _ [ ] images supports this view .",
    "there is no available narrow - band 5007    _ hst _ imaging for the other two clusters , b115 and bh16 , in which jcd13 detected [ ] emission , with @xmath48 values of 22.6 and 25.3 , respectively .",
    "however , there are archival broad - band optical and near - uv images for both clusters , obtained in the andromeda treasury program go-12058 ( pi j.  dalcanton ) .",
    "veyette et al .",
    "( 2014 ) have shown that pne have distinctive optical and nuv broad - band colors .",
    "this is especially true shortward of the balmer jump , where there are significant contributions to the flux from the nebular continuum and numerous emission lines , and from the underlying photosphere of the central star .    in figure  4",
    "i show _ hst _ images of b115 and bh16 , taken with wfc3 in the near uv ( f275w ) and optical uv ( f336w ) , and with acs at approximately the @xmath60 band ( f475w ) .",
    "the sizes of the frames are similar to those of the spectroscopic apertures used by jcd13 . in both cases",
    ", there is a conspicuous , very blue star - like object within the field .",
    "it is probable that these are the pne detected by jcd13 , although high - resolution narrow - band imaging would be needed to absolutely confirm the identifications .",
    "similar sets of broad - band wfc3 and acs images exist for nb89 , but in this case there is no obvious blue star in or near the cluster .",
    "this is consistent with the above suggestion that the [ ] emission in nb89 is from ambient diffuse nebulosity rather than a pn .",
    "the current online version of the galleti et al .",
    "( 2004 ) m31 catalog ( version  5 , 2012 august ) has 2060 entries , which include confirmed gcs , candidate gcs , and candidate objects subsequently shown not to be genuine gcs .",
    "the mmd06 catalog of pne in m31 contains 3300 confirmed pne and pn candidates .",
    "i intercompared these two catalogs , finding 44 cases where the coordinates agreed within @xmath61 .",
    "a majority of these objects are actually candidate gcs that have been reclassified as regions by caldwell et al .",
    "( 2009 ) , and are thus neither gcs nor pne .",
    "sixteen of the gcs have not been classified ; most of them are from the catalog of kim et al .",
    "( 2007 ) , and i suspect that they are also misclassified regions .    of these 44 clusters , only seven were included in the spectroscopic observations of jcd13 ( b075 , b105 , bh16 , b530 , sk052a , sk070a , and sk104a ) .",
    "jcd13 reported 5007    emission only in the old cluster bh16 ( see  5 above ) .",
    "for the other six , the nominal separations of the emission - line objects from the clusters are larger than the jcd13 aperture radius .",
    "there are five cases where an m31 cluster classified as an `` old '' gc by caldwell et al .",
    "( 2009 , 2011 ) , peacock et al .",
    "( 2010 ) , strader et al .",
    "( 2011 ) , and/or jcd13 has an mmd06 source lying within @xmath61 .",
    "these are listed in table  6 .",
    "of these five , there are archival _ hst _ images available for only two .",
    "( 1 )  bh16 was discussed in the previous section , in which i suggested that a blue point - like source to the se of the cluster center , which would have been within jcd13 s spectroscopic aperture , is the pn .",
    "curiously , however , the pn detected by jcd13 does not appear to be the object cataloged as mmd06 1360 , which differs substantially in both radial velocity and @xmath48 from the jcd13 pn .",
    "the _ hst _",
    "images show a bright blue star lying @xmath62 wsw of the cluster , which may be the mmd06 source .",
    "( 2 )  sk104a also has a neighboring blue star in broad - band _ hst _ images , lying @xmath63 nne from the cluster center .",
    "this is possibly the pn candidate , but narrow - band imaging and/or spectroscopy is needed to confirm this .",
    "i used _ hst _ snapshot observing to obtain [ ] 5007    images of 55 of the brightest `` population  ii '' gcs in local group galaxies outside the milky way .",
    "an additional 11 fainter clusters serendipitously fell within these frames .",
    "a search of the _ hst _ archive found [ ] images of nine more gcs in m31 , for a grand total of 75 local - group gcs .",
    "i searched all 75 of these clusters for point - like 5007    sources , which would be strong pn candidates .    among these old gcs of the local group ,",
    "i found only the m31 cluster b086 to have two pn candidates in its vicinity .",
    "however , they are at such large angular separations that their cluster membership is doubtful .",
    "one very convincing pn candidate was found in images of the young m31 cluster b477 .",
    "i also investigated _ hst _ images of the three candidate pne found in old clusters by jcd13 in their ground - based spectroscopic survey of m31 gcs .",
    "one of them appears to be a case where ambient diffuse nebulosity produced the 5007    emission , rather than a true pn . for the other two ,",
    "there are only broad - band _ hst _ images available , but both clusters contain a bright blue point source which is plausibly the pn .",
    "a comparison of two extensive catalogs of gcs and pne in m31 revealed several additional candidate pne within a few arcseconds of old gcs , but spectroscopy and narrow - band _ hst _ images will be needed to verify the cluster membership .",
    "the total luminosity of the 157 known gcs in the milky way system , determined from the data in the harris ( 1996 ) compliation ( 2010 editionharris / mwgc.dat ] ) , corresponds to a visual absolute magnitude of @xmath64 . for my sample of 75 local - group gcs , although only numbering about half of the milky way clusters , the total luminosity is actually slightly higher , at @xmath65 .",
    "in the milky way gc system , there are four known pne ( jmf97 ; table  4 of jcd13 ) .",
    "if they were at the distance of m31 , they would have @xmath48 magnitudes of 21.3 , 25.3 , 27.4 , and 29.7 .",
    "given the limiting magnitudes of my surveys (  3.2 ) , only one of them would be bright enough to be detected in my wfpc2 snapshots , and one more in my deeper wfc3 frames . in the actual old - population m31 clusters , we have two very probable pne  those in b115 and bh16along with several more candidates (   4.1,4.3 ) , which are as yet unconfirmed .",
    "as noted in  1 , there is also a pn in one of the gcs of the fornax dwarf spheroidal ( larsen 2008 ) .",
    "thus , within the small - number statistics , the incidences of pne in the old gcs of the milky way and in the rest of the local group are very similar .    according to our understanding of stellar evolution",
    ", we do not expect that pne can be formed by single stars in the ancient populations of gcs2357 in m22 ( gillett et al .",
    "1989 ) and the pn in the fornax gc h5 ( larsen 2008 ) .",
    "this may raise the possibility for these two objects of a late thermal pulse ( in a single star ) , similar to that invoked to explain the compact h - deficient [ ] -emitting nebula surrounding v605  aquilae ( clayton et al .",
    "2013 and references therein ) .",
    "detailed discussion is given by jacoby et al .",
    "( 2015 ) ] .",
    "binary - star mergers and ce events provide a plausible explanation for the fact that a few pne nevertheless exist in these clusters .",
    "one observational test would be to search for evidence of binarity in the central stars of pne in milky way gcs : those whose masses appear to be too low to have resulted from mergers are likely to have gone through a ce interaction , leaving them as close but still un - merged binaries .",
    "i also found some 60 point - like [ ] 5007    sources in the fields surrounding the gcs ( all but one of them in m31 ) ; many of them were already cataloged , but the stellar appearances in the _ hst _ images verify that they are highly probable field pne .",
    "support for program numbers snap-11218 and snap-11714 was provided by nasa through grants from the space telescope science institute , which is operated by the association of universities for research in astronomy , incorporated , under nasa contract nas5 - 26555 .",
    "helpful assistance and advice on the _ hst _ scheduling was given by alison vick , denise taylor , sylvia baggett , ronald gilliland , and larry petro .",

    "<S> single stars in ancient globular clusters ( gcs ) are believed incapable of producing planetary nebulae ( pne ) , because their post - asymptotic - giant - branch evolutionary timescales are slower than the dissipation timescales for pne . </S>",
    "<S> nevertheless , four pne are known in galactic gcs . </S>",
    "<S> their existence likely requires more exotic evolutionary channels , including stellar mergers and common - envelope binary interactions . </S>",
    "<S> i carried out a snapshot imaging search with the _ hubble space telescope _ ( _ hst _ ) for pne in bright local group gcs outside the milky way . </S>",
    "<S> i used a filter covering the 5007    nebular emission line of [ ] , and another one in the nearby continuum , to image 66 gcs . </S>",
    "<S> inclusion of archival _ hst _ frames brought the total number of extragalactic gcs imaged at 5007    to 75 , whose total luminosity slightly exceeds that of the entire galactic gc system . </S>",
    "<S> i found no convincing pne in these clusters , aside from one pn in a young m31 cluster misclassified as a gc , and two pne at such large angular separations from an m31 gc that membership is doubtful . in a ground - based spectroscopic survey of 274 old gcs in m31 , jacoby et al .  </S>",
    "<S> ( 2013 ) found three candidate pne . </S>",
    "<S> my _ hst _ images of one of them suggest that the [ ] emission actually arises from ambient interstellar medium rather than a pn ; for the other two candidates , there are broad - band archival uv _ hst _ images that show bright , blue point sources that are probably the pne . in a literature search , </S>",
    "<S> i also identified five further pn candidates lying near old gcs in m31 , for which follow - up observations are necessary to confirm their membership . </S>",
    "<S> the rates of incidence of pne are similar , and small but non - zero , throughout the gcs of the local group . </S>"
