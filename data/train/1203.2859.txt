    "the study of the survival probability of a target particle surrounded by diffusing traps is a classic problem in physical chemistry that goes back to smoluchowski in 1916 @xcite .",
    "smoluchowski introduced this problem to compute the rate of chemical reactions in the diffusion - driven regime .",
    "the basic model and its variants  @xcite have since found a large number of applications in a wide variety of contexts such as in reaction - diffusion systems  @xcite , chemical kinetics  @xcite , predator - prey models in population dynamics  @xcite and also in a wide class of the so called ` walker persistence ' problems  @xcite .    in the simplest setting of the model known as the ` target annihilation ' problem  @xcite , the target particle is immobile at the origin and the _ noninteracting _ traps , initially distributed uniformly over space with a finite density @xmath4 , each perform an unbiased continuous - time brownian motion with a diffusion constant @xmath13 .",
    "when any of these traps hits the target particle at the origin , the target particle gets annihilated .",
    "the average survival probability @xmath5 of the target up to time @xmath1 , where the average is over the initial positions of the traps distributed uniformly over space with density @xmath4 , has been computed exactly  @xcite in all dimensions . in particular , in the simplest one dimensional case",

    "the target particle needs to have a finite size while for @xmath22 , the target can be considered to be a point particle . in the original smoluchowski version of the problem",
    ", the quantity @xmath23 $ ] has a physical interpretation : it represents the net flux of traps to a static absorber at the origin up to time @xmath1  @xcite . in @xmath24 ,",
    "the net flux @xmath25 thus grows algebraically @xmath26 with time @xmath1 .",
    "the original smoluchowski or equivalently the ` target annihilation ' problem has been generalized in the literature in several ways , e.g. , ( a ) when the target itself moves stochastically ( not necessarily diffusive ) while the noninteracting traps perform normal diffusion and ( b ) when the target is static but the traps , while still noninteracting , perform , in general , non - diffusive stochastic motion ( c ) when both the target and the traps move nondiffusively in general and ( d ) the famous donsker - varadhan problem  @xcite where the target moves diffusively but the traps are immobile . in this paper , we will focus on the cases ( a ) and ( b ) only .",
    "an interesting variant belonging to class ( a ) above is the ` diffusive target annihilation ' problem where the target particle itself diffuses with a diffusion constant @xmath27  @xcite .",
    "this problem has seen a recent flurry of activity  @xcite and it has been proved rigorously that in one dimension , the average survival probability @xmath5 of the diffusing target particle has the same asymptotic stretched exponential decay as in eq .",
    "( [ target ] ) ( and hence is independent of @xmath27 ) , though with considerable subleading corrections to the leading behavior for intermediate @xmath1 .",
    "another variant in class ( a ) is the ` ballistic target annihilation ' problem where the target particle moves ballistically with a constant velocity @xmath28 . in this case",
    ", the survival probability decays faster , @xmath29 $ ] in all dimensions @xmath30 , where the inverse decay rate @xmath31 has been computed exactly for @xmath22 and @xmath32  @xcite .",
    "the variants in class ( b ) where the target is static and the traps undergo subdiffusive motion or ( c ) where both the target and the traps undergo subdiffusive motion have been studied extensively by yuste and collaborators  @xcite .",
    "another recent extension belonging to class ( b ) above is to the case where the target is static , each trap performs independent brownian motion but resets to its own initial position with a constant rate @xmath33  @xcite .",
    "this problem has interesting implication in the context of search problems where a team of searchers ( traps ) adopt the resetting strategy to make the search of the target more efficient  @xcite .",
    "for @xmath34 , it reduces to the standard target annihilation problem . for a nonzero @xmath33 ,",
    "the average survival probability in one dimension was computed exactly and it was found to decay as a power - law at late times  @xcite @xmath35 where @xmath36 is a constant . for short times @xmath37 , the decay is stretched - exponential  @xcite as in eq .",
    "( [ target ] ) .    in this paper",
    ", we study analytically the average survival probability of a target particle in one dimension in another variant belonging to class ( b ) . in this model ,",
    "the target remains immobile at the origin as in the original target annihilation model .",
    "the traps also remain noninteracting and are distributed initially in space with a uniform density @xmath4 . however , each trap , instead of performing a continuous - time brownian motion with a diffusion constant @xmath13 , now performs a continuous - time random walk ( ctrw ) with arbitrary jump length distribution and arbitrary waiting time distribution between successive jumps .",
    "our result for the asymptotic survival probability includes the cases when the traps undergo subdiffusive as well as superdiffusive motion , thus generalizing the previously known result for subdiffusive traps  @xcite .    in the standard version of ctrw ,",
    "a trap moves by making successive random jumps at random times  @xcite .",
    "more precisely , starting from its initial position , a trap waits a certain amount of random time @xmath38 ( drawn from a normalized distribution @xmath3 ) and then jumps by a certain distance @xmath39 ( also a random variable drawn from a continuous and symmetric distribution @xmath2 ) ( see fig .",
    "( [ ctrw.fig ] ) ) . at its new position it again waits for a random time drawn from @xmath3 ( each time independently ) and then jumps to another new position by a random distance drawn from @xmath2 and the process continues .",
    "thus , ctrw has two ` input ' distributions , one for time and one for space , namely @xmath3 and @xmath2 .",
    "we also assume that these two distributions do nt vary from trap to trap , all trap motions are characterized by the same @xmath3 and @xmath2 . in this model ,",
    "the immobile target particle at the origin gets annihilated whenever any trap trajectory",
    "_ goes past the origin_. note that the particle at the origin gets annihilated even when a trap _ jumps over _ the origin .",
    "thus the survival probability @xmath5 of the target particle in this case is just the probability that not any of the traps jumps over the origin up to time @xmath1 .",
    "our goal is to understand how the two arbitrary input distributions @xmath3 and @xmath2 affect the canonical stretched exponential decay of @xmath5 in eq .",
    "( [ target ] ) that is valid when each trap performs continuous - time brownian motion .",
    "the advantage of ctrw is that by appropriately choosing the two input distributions @xmath3 and @xmath2 , one can study various types of motions of a trap as special cases .",
    "for example , if one chooses @xmath40 , one generates a discrete time jump process with jump length distribution @xmath2 where the jumps happen instantaneously at time steps separated by @xmath41 .",
    "if one further chooses a gaussian jump length distribution @xmath42/\\sqrt{2\\pi { \\langle \\eta^2\\rangle}}$ ] and takes the limit @xmath43 , @xmath44 but keeping the ratio @xmath45 constant , one recovers the continuous - time brownian motion .",
    "similarly , by choosing a power law distribution @xmath46 for large @xmath47 with @xmath48 , one can generate lvy flights for a trap  @xcite . besides , the ctrw also provides a natural framework to generate anomalous diffusion process , namely subdiffusive and superdiffusive behavior that occurs in many natural processes  @xcite",
    ". it would thus be interesting to know how the average survival probability @xmath5 of a target particle decays with time when each of the traps , though still noninteracting , performs ctrw with arbitrary waiting time and jump length distributions , @xmath3 and @xmath2 respectively .     noninteracting traps around it undergoing stochastic motion .",
    "the traps are initially placed uniformly in the box @xmath49 .",
    "eventually we are interested in the limit when the number of traps @xmath50 , the box size @xmath51 but with the density of traps @xmath52 fixed.,scaledwidth=50.0% ]    0.3 cm    our main results are twofold :    1 .",
    "we will first derive a very general result for the average survival probability @xmath5 for any model in one dimension belonging to class ( b ) above , i.e. , when the target is immobile and each trap performs independently a stochastic motion @xmath53 starting from its initial position @xmath54 .",
    "the stochastic evolution law of @xmath53 can be rather general .",
    "the only assumptions are ( i ) the process @xmath53 is invariant under a constant shift , i.e. , @xmath53 and @xmath55 ( where @xmath28 is a constant ) has the same evolution equation and ( ii ) the process @xmath56 is symmetric around the origin . since the evolution law of the the @xmath57-th trap @xmath56 does not depend explicitly on the index @xmath57 , we will generally denote it by @xmath58 .",

    "for example , if @xmath8 is a continuous - time brownian motion , it is well known that the probability distribution of the maximum @xmath63 of the process is a half - gaussian  @xcite , i.e. , @xmath64/\\sqrt{\\pi d t}$ ] for @xmath65 .",
