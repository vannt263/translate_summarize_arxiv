    "clusters and groups of galaxies are the largest gravitationally bound matter structures observed in the universe .",
    "although these objects are expected to host several high energy phenomena , the resulting electromagnetic non - thermal emission is far from being fully understood @xcite .",
    "a hallmark of the occurrence of non - thermal phenomena in these large structures is the detection , in numerous clusters , of extended radio emission associated to the synchrotron losses of relativistic cosmic - ray electrons @xcite .",
    "the acceleration of cosmic rays in galaxy clusters can originate from a number of physical processes , including violent shocks produced in cluster - cluster mergers and the accretion of smaller structures @xcite , the re - acceleration of cosmic rays injected by galactic sources like active galactic nuclei and supernovae @xcite , and inelastic collisions of primary cosmic - ray protons @xcite producing showers of secondary particles , including relativistic electrons and positrons as well as gamma rays .",
    "the radio emission from clusters , perhaps the most solid source of observational information on non - thermal phenomena in these objects , broadly falls into two classes featuring different spatial distribution , polarization and emission location within the cluster . the first class , _ radio relics _",
    ", is characterized by irregular radio morphologies and is typically located in external regions of the cluster @xcite",
    ". the second class of diffuse cluster radio sources is that of _ radio halos _",
    "@xcite , whose emission is typically centered on the cluster and follows a similar spatial distribution as e.g. the thermal x - ray emission from the intra - cluster medium ( icm ) gas .",
    "radio relics , unlike radio halos , exhibit prominent polarization , and are often associated to cluster regions thought to host shock activity .",
    "the origin of radio halos , instead , is far from being fully understood @xcite .",
    "the upcoming generation of low - frequency radio arrays , including the giant metrewave radio telescope ( gmrt ) , the low frequency array for radio astronomy ( lofar ) , the murchison widefield array ( mwa ) and the long wavelength array ( lwa ) , will improve the current observational situation in the near future .",
    "in the recent past , claims of hard x - ray emission from nearby cluster of galaxies have been reported @xcite .",
    "one possibility is that this x - ray emission originates from the inverse compton ( ic ) scattering off background radiation of the same non - thermal high energy electron population responsible for the radio emission .",
    "most of the clusters reportedly detected at hard x - ray frequencies are merging clusters @xcite , and the detections themselves are still debated @xcite .",
    "in addition , it is unclear if simple models for the non - thermal population fueling radio and hard x - ray emissions can self - consistently explain data from clusters ( see e.g. the case of new radio data from the ophiuchus cluster of galaxies @xcite in connection with the recent claim of a non - thermal hard x - ray detection with integral @xcite ) .",
    "future hard x - ray missions , including the nuclear spectroscopic telescope array ( nustar ) @xcite and the international x - ray observatory ( imx ) @xcite , will play a key role in settling the mentioned controversies , as well as in fostering our understanding of processes underlying non - thermal activity in clusters @xcite .",
    "gamma rays , covering the highest end of the electro - magnetic spectrum , can potentially provide essential information on high - energy phenomena in groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "so far , these objects have not been detected in gamma - rays , and data from the egret telescope on board the compton gamma - ray observatory @xcite have only produced upper limits @xcite ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "statistically conclusive discoveries and a true revolution in our understanding of the highest energy phenomena in galaxy clusters are anticipated with the fermi gamma - ray space telescope , formerly known as glast @xcite , which was successfully launched on june 11 , 2008 . the main instrument onboard fermi , the large area telescope ( lat ) , represents a remarkable jump in sensitivity compared to its predecessor egret @xcite .",
    "the lat also extends the egret energy range ( 20 mev to 10 gev ) to much higher gamma - ray energies , up to about 300 gev . aside from probing high and ultra - high energy particle physics processes in astrophysical sources , the detection of gamma rays from clusters would also help to establish the properties of the primary proton population within clusters , and possibly clarify its role in various cluster phenomena @xcite .",
    "these include e.g. the question of the origin of radio halos @xcite , the `` cooling - flow '' problem @xcite and particle acceleration within cluster merger shocks @xcite .",
    "clusters of galaxies are potentially powerful observational probes of cosmology ( see e.g. @xcite ) . in this context",
    ", the accurate understanding of non - thermal phenomena in clusters is crucial to their ultimate utility as cosmological probes .",
    "specifically , the estimate of cluster masses , which is at the basis of all cosmological applications using clusters , frequently relies on the assumption of hydrostatic equilibrium between gravitational forces and the thermal pressure supplied by the icm .",
    "the accuracy of hydrostatic mass determinations is therefore limited by our understanding of the non - thermal pressure provided by cosmic rays , turbulence and magnetic fields in the icm @xcite .",
    "the fermi gamma - ray space telescope , as well as current and planned ground based atmospheric cherenkov telescopes ( acts ) will be able to probe the energy density supplied by cosmic rays , and possibly the evolution with redshift of cosmic ray pressure , to an unprecedented level of accuracy @xcite .    a more exotic possibility for non - thermal activity in galaxy clusters was first envisioned by totani in ref .",
    "@xcite : the pair annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles ( wimp ) constituting the dark matter halo . following that seminal work , colafrancesco , profumo and ullio calculated in @xcite the complete multi - frequency spectrum , for the case of the coma cluster , resulting from dark matter annihilation .",
    "the emission spectrum extends from radio to gamma - ray frequencies , and includes the secondary emissions from the non - thermal electrons and positrons produced as final stable particles in dark matter annihilation events .",
    "in addition , ref .",
    "@xcite also studied the heating of the icm produced by the energy injected by dark matter annihilation , as well as the induced sunyaev - zeldovich signal .",
    "as far as indirect signals from particle dark matter annihilation , by far the best studied non - thermal radiative emission is the production of gamma - rays @xcite .",
    "specifically , when two dark matter particles annihilate , gamma rays result both directly from loop - suppressed diagrams as well as from the subsequent decays or radiative emission ( e.g. from final state radiation ) of standard model particles produced in the annihilation final state , like quarks , leptons and gauge and higgs bosons .",
    "the resulting gamma rays have energies extending up to the kinematic limit set by the wimp mass ( the pair annihilation event occurs for highly non - relativistic dark matter particles ) , predicted to be in the 10 - 1000 gev range in the best motivated models @xcite ( see however @xcite ) .",
    "the lat instrument onboard fermi is a tremendous tool for the indirect search for particle dark matter with gamma rays @xcite .",
    "of special relevance for the present study , the flux of gamma rays from wimp dark matter annihilation in clusters of galaxies has been shown to be in principle large enough to be detectable by fermi - lat @xcite .",
    "dark matter annihilation does not only produce gamma rays , but also additional stable particle species , such as energetic electrons and positrons .",
    "these , in turn , produce synchrotron , ic and bremsstrahlung radiation , with unique spectral features .",
    "the multi - wavelength emission from dark matter annihilation was studied in detail in @xcite , and specifically in clusters of galaxies in @xcite .",
    "interestingly , it was demonstrated that if dark matter annihilation fuels to some appreciable degree either the radio emission in the coma cluster @xcite , or the hard x - ray emission in the ophiuchus cluster @xcite , fermi is almost guaranteed to have the sensitivity to detect gamma rays from dark matter annihilation .",
    "upcoming gamma ray observations of clusters of galaxies have therefore profound implications for cosmology and , possibly , the discovery of new physics .",
    "if fermi detects gamma rays from clusters , a crucial point will be to conclusively assess the nature of the mechanism responsible for the emission . in the present study",
    ", we focus on how to tell apart gamma rays produced by standard , astrophysical mechanisms such as cosmic rays from those resulting from wimp dark matter annihilation . on general grounds",
    ", we expect to have three handles to differentiate the two emission mechanisms :    * the _ gamma - ray spectrum _ :",
    "models for cosmic ray production of gamma rays predict a flux as a function of energy which differs from what expected out of dark matter annihilation .",
    "the low photon statistics represents a challenge for meaningful discrimination based on the gamma - ray spectrum .",
    "we thus study the best angular and energy range , and propose a technique based on hardness ratios that will help to discriminate cosmic rays from dark matter * the _ spatial distribution _ : depending upon assumptions on the dark matter substructure distribution and density profile , as well as on the primary cosmic ray source distribution , we predict that clusters can appear to be extended gamma - ray sources .",
    "we study whether this can be used to differentiate gamma rays emitted by dark matter from those produced by cosmic rays * the _ multi - wavelength emission _ : comparing the results of hydrodynamical simulations of cosmic rays in clusters to our predictions for a dark matter scenario , we find that the ratio of the hard x - ray to gamma - ray emission is a potential diagnostic to understand the origin of non - thermal phenomena in clusters .    in our simulations and analysis",
    ", we use the latest lat instrumental response function and observation strategy and the fermi science tools software package which is currently being used to analyze fermi data .    as an application of our theoretical study , we present predictions for gamma - ray fluxes from a large x - ray limited sample of 130 nearby groups and clusters of galaxies .",
    "specifically , our predictions are based on x - ray data , and on a fixed set of assumptions for both dark matter and cosmic rays .",
    "this also allows for a meaningful comparison of the dark matter to cosmic ray induced emission at gamma - ray frequencies .",
    "we present a ranking of plausible candidates where one might expect a bright gamma - ray signal , and of sources where the dark matter contribution is expected to be stronger compared to the one fueled by astrophysical cosmic rays . in particular",
    ", we discovered that low - redshift groups are the most promising class of objects to search for a dark matter signal from distant extra - galactic systems .",
    "the organization of our paper is as follows .",
    "the following section [ sec : method ] illustrates the model we use to compute the gamma - ray emission resulting frtom cosmic rays ( [ sec : cr ] ) and from dark matter annihilation ( [ sec : dm ] ) , and gives details on the fermi simulation setup ( [ sec : glastsim ] ) .",
    "section [ sec : origin ] discusses how to study the origin of gamma rays from clusters , including our analysis of the optimal angular region , the spectra , hardness ratios , spatial extension and multi - wavelength counterparts .",
    "we present in section [ sec : cat ] our predictions and ranking of nearby clusters and groups according to their gamma - ray emission ( the complete list is provided in the appendix ) .",
    "section [ sec : concl ] gives a discussion and summary of our results , and concludes .",
    "in this section we present our modeling of the gamma ray emission from cosmic rays ( [ sec : cr ] ) and from dark matter ( [ sec : dm ] ) . for definiteness , we consider the case of the coma cluster @xcite , but what we find applies to generic low redshift clusters .",
    "we also discuss , in sec .",
    "[ sec : glastsim ] , the fermi simulation setup we employ in our study .",
    "several mechanisms leading to the acceleration of relativistic particles in the intra - cluster medium have been discussed in the literature ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .",
    "most importantly , energetic arguments suggest that powerful shocks created in cluster - cluster mergers and in the accretion of material onto the deep cluster gravitational potential well are significant sources of relativistic cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "the same shocks can also re - accelerate originally lower - energy particles injected into the icm through other processes @xcite .",
    "the common denominator to the above mentioned scenarios is that fermi shock acceleration yields a population of non - thermal relativistic cosmic rays .",
    "these include primarily high - energy electrons and protons . the former efficiently loose energy by synchrotron emission at radio frequencies as well as through the up - scattering of background radiation to gamma - ray and x - ray frequencies ( inverse compton scattering ) . collisions of high - energy cosmic - ray protons with nuclei in the icm produce , in their hadronic debris , neutral pions promptly decaying into two gamma rays with typical energies and fluxes potentially observable by fermi - lat .",
    "in addition , the same collisions yield secondary cosmic ray electrons and positrons from the decays of charged pions @xcite .    at energies @xmath0 gev and for non - merging clusters , or clusters in the intermediate or late merger stages ,",
    "most of the gamma - ray emission is believed to stem from gamma rays produced in neutral pion decays resulting fomr the above mentioned inelastic cosmic - ray proton collisions @xcite .",
    "the energy stored in the secondary electron - positron pairs is predicted to contribute at the level of 1% or less of the total power associated to the primary cosmic ray protons @xcite . in terms of the gamma - ray emission , ref .",
    "@xcite estimates that only for very low average cluster magnetic fields and for very steep proton injection spectral indexes can the secondary inverse compton contribution be even 10% of that from @xmath1 decay .",
    "although secondary @xmath2 inverse compton emission is likely subdominant compared to neutral pion decay gamma - ray yields , during the early stages of a merger , _ primary _ electrons can still make a significant contribution to the gev radiation .",
    "the gamma - ray emission is , again , dominantly associated to the inverse compton of , here , primary cosmic - ray electrons off of the microwave radiation background .",
    "the resulting inverse compton flux is suppressed compared to the hadronic gamma - ray production from nuclear interactions involving non - thermal protons only as long as the efficiency of acceleration of hadronic species exceeds that for electrons @xcite . while this is indeed the expectation in diffusive shock acceleration theory @xcite , the reader should bear in mind that the model we outline below might not apply to merging clusters in the early stage of a merger , or it may give underestimates of the cosmic ray production of gamma - rays .",
    "in general , inverse compton emission from primary electrons is expected to dominate close to acceleration sites such as large scale shocks @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , simulations indicate that the inverse compton emission from electrons is systematically subdominant at energies relevant to the fermi telescope compared to gamma - rays produced from pion decays @xcite .    in this work ,",
    "we consider only the typically dominant gamma - ray emission from pion decays .",
    "the inclusion of gamma rays from primary electrons inverse compton scattering could affect the results of the analysis we present in the following ways .",
    "first , the total gamma - ray flux , when considering this additional source , will generically be enhanced , potentially resulting in even better prospects for the detection of galaxy clusters at gamma - ray energies with fermi - lat . furthermore ,",
    "if ic from primary electrons plays a significant role , the morphology of the gamma - ray emission region from cosmic rays would also be affected , leading likely to a wider extent of the emitting region ( including for instance peripheral cluster shock regions ) .",
    "this could , however , potentially hinder the discrimination of a cosmic - ray emission from that originating from dark matter annihilation using spatial considerations ( sec .",
    "[ sec : space ] ) .",
    "thirdly , the spectral analysis ( sec  [ sec : specs ] ) will in general be affected , depending on the spectrum of the emission , and a broken power law feature could arise at low fermi energies where the emission from primary electrons may become comparable to that from primary hadronic cosmic rays . finally , it is possible that clusters that host a bright active nucleus and , concurrently , exhibit significant ic emission from an accretion shock would feature a _",
    "double peak _ in the spatial distribution of high - energy cosmic - ray sources .",
    "such a circumstance can not be described by the radial power - law functional form we adopt in the simplified spatial model for the distribution of cosmic - rays described below .",
    "bearing the above caveats in mind , for simplicity we assume here that the dominant source for the gamma - ray emission from galaxy clusters at energies relevant to fermi originates from inelastic collisions of hadronic cosmic rays @xcite .",
    "following the arguments outlined above , we then follow the analytical cosmic - ray model outlined in @xcite . in this scenario ,",
    "the primary proton injection spectrum is described by a simple power law , parametrized by a spectral index @xmath3 independent of the position in the source . in @xcite a framework is outlined for incorporating the fireball model for very high energy cosmic ray proton interactions with the icm as well as pion production threshold effects . the resulting differential source function @xmath4 ( with units of inverse energy and volume ) is @xmath5^{-\\alpha_\\gamma/\\delta_\\gamma}\\ \\",

    "the quantity @xmath7 with the dimensions of the cosmic ray proton number density , has a normalization chosen so that the kinetic cosmic ray proton energy is proportional to the thermal energy density of the icm . also , @xmath8 is the pion multiplicity , and @xmath9 is a shape parameter for the @xmath1-threshold physics @xcite . by integrating over all solid angles and dividing by @xmath6 and @xmath10 ( to be independent of a model s spatial dependence ) the final differential gamma - ray source function ( i.e. the gamma - ray flux per unit energy and unit time , per unit target and impinging cosmic - ray flux ) is obtained .    the spatial distribution of cosmic ray sources is modeled in terms of the ratio of the energy density in cosmic rays to the energy density of the thermal gas ; this ratio is taken to be a power law with radius , parametrized by @xmath11 as @xmath12 where @xmath13 is the ratio of the energy density of cosmic rays compared to the thermal gas , and @xmath14 is the radius of an enclosed spherical overdensity @xmath15 times the critical density of the universe at the source s redshift @xcite .",
    "the parameter @xmath11 physically reflects the possibility that the spatial distribution of the sources of high - energy cosmic rays deviates , via a power - law as a function of radius , from the density profile of the thermal gas in the cluster . while a variation in the mach number during the course of a cluster merger can drive different injection indexes at different locations @xcite , we neglect here , for simplicity , any spatial variation associated to @xmath3 .    in summary ,",
    "the simple model we use here depends on three orthogonal parameters : @xmath3 , that sets the spectral shape of both the injected primary cosmic rays and the resulting gamma rays , @xmath13 that sets the normalization of the gamma - ray flux , and @xmath11 , that ( together with the gas density distribution , that can be inferred e.g. from x - ray data ) sets the spatial distribution of the signal .",
    "we outline below a few motivated parameter space choices which define the benchmark models we employ to run our fermi simulations .",
    "we then apply these models to the specific case of the coma cluster .    *",
    "as far as the injection spectral index , estimates come from theoretical arguments as well as from numerical simulations .",
    "for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that the minimum spectral index ranges from 2.1 to 2.8 . in that range",
    ", larger values are typically associated to forward shocks and smaller masses .",
    "the larger the mass , the stronger the gravitational potential and the harder the predicted injection spectral index .",
    "structure formation shock theory predicts injection spectral indices of @xmath16 for strong shocks @xcite , such as those expected for _ accretion _ shocks and _ strong merger _ shocks .",
    "we choose here @xmath17 as physically motivated cases .",
    "specifically , the cosmic ray spectrum in our galaxy is observed to be a power law with @xmath18 , which motivates the large @xmath3 choice . on the other hand ,",
    "clusters confine cosmic rays on cosmological time scales @xcite , and are thus expected to give rise to a harder spectrum than that of the galaxy : @xmath19 is thus also a reasonable and motivated choice for a harder injection spectrum @xcite .",
    "this choice is , in addition , consistent with the results of the simulations of ref .",
    "@xcite . however , if cosmic rays in galaxy clusters are accelerated in _ weaker _ merger shocks the expectation is one of a softer injection spectral index . in this case ,",
    "strong confinement of cosmic rays in clusters will likely not make the spectrum much harder .",
    "numerical simulations , though , indicate a low efficiency for the acceleration of cosmic rays at weak merger shocks @xcite . in summary , thus , we regard our benchmark value @xmath18 as an example case rather than , strictly , as an upper limit to the cosmic ray injection spectrum .",
