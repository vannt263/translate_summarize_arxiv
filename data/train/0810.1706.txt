    "this study is based on data provided by the virgo / soho package ( spm , loi , diarad & pmo ( frhlich et al . 1995 ) ) and complemented by measurements from golf / soho ( gabriel et al .",
    "1995 ; calibrated into velocity following ulrich el al . 2000 and",
    "garca et al . 2005 ) and ground based network gong ( harvey et al . 1996 ) .",
    "4098-d time series ( 1996 , april 11 to 2007 , june 30 ) has been used .",
    "this time span has been divided into 66 series of 800 days with a 50 days shift every two consecutive ones . these 66 power spectra has been used to build the so - called time - evolution power diagrams . to remove the low - frequency trends in the time series",
    ", two different methods has been used : a 1 day running mean and a backwards difference filter ( properly correcting the power spectrum following garca & ballot 2008 ) .",
    "both methods yield to the same results . finally , a classical fft an an iterative sine wave fitting has been used with similar results .",
    "a stable signal with time has been found at 220.7 @xmath0hz in all the virgo package but with a better signal - to - noise ( snr ) ratio in the spms ( see figure 1 ) . this signal is clearly observed during all the 4098 days of the mission . at around time series 60 the signal slightly shifts towards higher frequency .",
    "hz , width=415 ]    averaging the signal on time we can produce a collapsed diagram in the frequency direction . figure 2 showed such diagrams for three different instruments , golf and spm aboard soho as well as the ground based network gong . in all of them the highest peak in the region is the 220.7 @xmath2hz peak but with a poor snr in the case of the ground - based data .",
    "however the presence of this peak in the gong data minimise the possibility of a problem inside the soho spacecraft and it is more likely to have a solar origin .",
    "once this interesting pattern have been detected in virgo the main question is to investigate its origin , that means , if it is a solar signal or a signal artificially produced by the instrumentation .",
    "thus , we study all the possible non - solar origin of this signal which goes from the orbital and pointing corrections of the spacecraft to the housekeeping parameters of the virgo package .",
    "that means all the possible effects that could modulate the collected photometric signal . in particular , we have checked the temporal evolution of the following parameters yielding to the conclusion that neither of them could explain the observed pattern : orbital corrections and sun - earth distance and velocity ; soho spacecraft pointing : pith , yaw and even roll ; virgo data acquisition system ( das ) temperature variations ; virgo heatsink and dc / dc temperature variations ; virgo / spm sensor temperature corrections ; virgo / spm electronic temperature .",
    "a signal at 220.7 is present during the last 12 years in all the instruments of the virgo / soho package this signal has no instrumental origin .",
    "we have checked all the housekeeping parameters including the soho pointing , without success a similar behaviour is found in the observations of the other instruments ( i.e. golf ) , but with smaller s / n ratio the presence of this pattern in gong points towards a solar origin . or this is the signature of an strange behaviour of the convection or it is a component of a g mode    this work has been done inside the phoebus collaboration funded by the international space science institute in bern , switzerland .",
    "this work has also been partially founded by the spanish grant penaya2007 - 62650 and the cnes / golf grant at the sap - cea / sacaly .",
    "this work utilizes data obtained by the global oscillation network group ( gong ) program , managed by the national solar observatory , which is operated by aura , inc . under a cooperative agreement with the national science foundation .",
    "the data were acquired by instruments operated by the big bear solar observatory , high altitude observatory , learmonth solar observatory , udaipur solar observatory , instituto de astrofsica de canarias , and cerro tololo interamerican observatory .",
