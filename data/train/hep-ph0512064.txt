    "the dimension-2 gluon condensate @xmath4 attracted the attention of some researchers well over a decade ago ; e.g. , see refs . @xcite .",
    "however , there was a wide - spread opinion that , since this condensate is not gauge invariant , it can not have observable consequences and can not play an important role in qcd .",
    "in contrast to that , the gauge - invariant , dimension-4 gluon condensate @xmath5 @xcite has , over 25 years now , been a subject of studies discussing its value ( e.g. , see ref .",
    "@xcite ) and implications for qcd .",
    "after it turned out more recently that the landau - gauge value of @xmath0 corresponds to a more general gauge - invariant quantity , it attracted a lot of theoretical attention @xcite , to quote just several of many papers offering evidence that @xmath0 condensate may be important for the nonperturbative regime of yang - mills theories . in ref .",
    "@xcite , we argued that @xmath0 condensate may be relevant for the dyson - schwinger ( ds ) approach to qcd .",
    "namely , in order that this approach @xcite leads to a successful hadronic phenomenology [ which has so far been treated _",
    "widely _ only in the rainbow - ladder approximation ( rla ) ] , an enhancement of the effective quark - gluon interaction seems to be needed at intermediate spacelike momenta , @xmath6 gev@xmath7 .",
    "reference @xcite showed that the interplay of the dimension-2 condensate @xmath0 with the dimension-4 condensate @xmath1 can provide such an enhancement .",
    "it also showed that the resulting effective strong running coupling leads to the sufficiently strong dynamical chiral symmetry breaking ( d@xmath8sb ) and successful phenomenology in the sector of light pseudoscalar mesons .",
    "in addition , the issues such as quark propagator solutions , @xmath9-dependent dressed ( `` constituent '' ) quark masses and a more detailed discussion of the parameter dependence of the results were addressed in refs .",
    "@xcite .    in the present paper , we extend the treatment of the nonzero - isospin light pseudoscalar mesons of ref .",
    "@xcite to the @xmath2@xmath3 complex .",
    "first , in the next section , the key result of ref .",
    "@xcite , namely its gluon - condensate - enhanced interaction ( [ ouralpha_eff ] ) , is briefly re - derived in another , less rigorous and heuristic way . in the third section ,",
    "we review how the ds approach employing such an interaction , can give the successful light ( i.e. , involving quark flavors @xmath10 ) meson phenomenology , as this is also needed for the good description of the presently interesting @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons .",
    "nevertheless , for @xmath2 and @xmath3 this is not enough because of the influence of the gluon anomaly and thus we explain how its effects are included in the manner of refs .",
    "the implementation of the anomaly and the su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking , as well as their interplay , are presented independently of any concrete dynamics in subsection [ etamasses ] , and in detail , because of some renewed interest in the flavor dependence of the mixing in the @xmath2@xmath3 complex ( e.g. , ref . @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "after that , the masses , mixing angle and two - photon ( @xmath11 ) decay widths of @xmath2 and @xmath3 are calculated .",
    "discussion and conclusion are in sec .",
    "reference @xcite showed how the interaction ( [ ouralpha_eff ] ) , phenomenologically successful in ds studies in the landau gauge and rla , resulted from combining the form [ eq .",
    "( [ alkofalpha ] ) below ] which the running coupling has in the landau - gauge ds studies @xcite and the ideas on the possible relevance of the @xmath0 gluon condensate @xcite . in the present paper , we give a simplified and more intuitive derivation thereof as follows .    the full gluon propagator @xmath12 in the landau gauge",
    "is defined through the free gluon propagator @xmath13 and the gluon renormalization function @xmath14 like this : @xmath15 the full ghost propagator @xmath16 is similarly defined by the ghost renormalization function @xmath17 : @xmath18 the strong running coupling @xmath19 used in the landau - gauge ds studies @xcite is defined as @xmath20 where @xmath21 and @xmath22 at the renormalization point @xmath23 .",
    "our convention is @xmath24 for spacelike momenta @xmath25 .",
    "the functions @xmath26 and @xmath27 can be expressed through the corresponding gluon ( @xmath28 ) and ghost ( @xmath27 ) polarization functions @xmath29 and @xmath30 : @xmath31 almost two decades ago , it was noted that in the operator product expansion ( ope ) the gluon condensate @xmath0 can contribute to qcd propagators ; e.g. , see refs .",
    "their @xmath0-contributions to the ope - improved gluon ( @xmath28 ) and ghost ( @xmath27 ) polarization functions were more recently confirmed by kondo @xcite .",
    "for the landau gauge adopted throughout this paper , three qcd colors ( @xmath32 ) and four space - time dimensions ( @xmath33 ) , their expressions for the polarizations become @xmath34 @xmath35 where @xmath36 and @xmath37 are , respectively , dynamically generated effective gluon and ghost mass .",
    "reference @xcite estimated @xmath38 gev ( and found that it was , phenomenologically , a remarkably successful initial estimate ) by using in eq .",
    "( [ gluonmass ] ) the lattice result @xmath39 gev@xmath7 of ref .",
    "@xcite , a value compatible with the bound resulting from the discussions of gubarev _ et al . _",
    "@xcite on the physical meaning of @xmath0 and its possible importance for confinement .    as for the contributions @xmath40 ( @xmath41 ) in eq .",
    "( [ kondo ] ) , it turned out @xcite that they contain many kinds of mostly unknown condensates [ e.g. , gauge - dependent gluon , ghost and mixed ones , where terms @xmath42 @xmath43 were not considered at all ] .",
    "the only practical approach at this point is therefore that these complicated contributions are approximated by the terms @xmath44 and parameterized , i.e. , @xmath45 thus , @xmath46 and @xmath47 would in principle be free parameters to be fixed by phenomenology .",
    "however , as noted in ref .",
    "@xcite , in the effective gluon propagator proposed by lavelle @xcite , the @xmath48 polarization is ( for the landau gauge and @xmath33 ) given by the dimension-4 gluon condensate @xmath1 as @xmath49 since lavelle s @xcite propagator misses some unknown three- and four - gluon contributions @xcite and since the precise value of @xmath50 is still not certain , we regard the value @xmath51 just as an inspired initial estimate . still , together with the assumption @xmath52 , it was a very useful starting guess in our refs .",
    "@xcite , leading to very good phenomenological fits .    we are now prepared to give a general , although heuristic argument why the contribution ( [ gluonmass ] ) of the dimension-2 @xmath0 condensate to the gluon and ghost polarization functions ( [ kondo ] ) , should indeed lead to the form of @xmath53 already found through a more detailed argument in ref .",
    "our first step is to assume that in the gluon and ghost polarizations ( [ kondo ] ) , @xmath54 and @xmath55 , one can disentangle the perturbative ( @xmath56 ) from nonperturbative ( @xmath57 ) parts , @xmath58 @xmath59 . at least for high momenta @xmath60",
    ", it is then possible to approximately factor away the perturbative from nonperturbative contributions ; for @xmath61 , @xmath62 where the approximation means neglecting the contribution of the term @xmath63 analogously , @xmath64    since the general qcd coupling @xmath19 must reduce to the _ perturbative _ qcd coupling @xmath65 for so very high @xmath60 that nonperturbative contributions are negligible , eq .",
    "( [ alkofalpha ] ) implies that @xmath66 we can also assume , for high @xmath60 , that nonperturbative parts are given by the ope - based results of refs .",
    "@xcite . in our present case",
    ", they amount to eqs .",
    "( [ kondo])-([gluonmass ] ) for the gluon and ghost polarizations , and to the parameterization ( [ calos ] ) .",
    "this then gives @xmath67 equations ( [ alkofalpha ] ) , ( [ zapprox ] ) , ( [ gapprox ] ) , ( [ zope ] ) , and ( [ zgope ] ) , considered together , then suggest an effective coupling @xmath53 of the form @xmath68    obviously , the above derivation of the coupling ( [ ouralpha_eff ] ) is only heuristic , but we have already presented its more rigorous derivation in ref .",

    "@xcite , we discussed why , how and when the form ( [ ouralpha_eff ] ) was sufficiently enhanced at intermediate @xmath60 to lead to the successful pion and kaon phenomenology when used in the ds approach in rla .",
    "in the ds approach to qcd , one solves the gap equation , i.e. , the ds equation for quark two - point functions , namely dressed quark propagators @xmath69 of various flavors @xmath70 , and so explicitly constructs constituent quarks characterized by the dynamical masses @xmath71 .",
    "the constituent quarks and antiquarks of respective flavors @xmath70 and @xmath72 build meson bound states , which are solutions of the bethe - salpeter ( bs ) equation for the bound - state vertex @xmath73 : @xmath74_{ef } = \\int \\frac{d^4\\ell}{(2\\pi)^4 } [ s_q(\\ell+\\frac{{p}}{2 } ) \\gamma_{q{\\bar q}'}(\\ell,{p } ) s_{q'}(\\ell-\\frac{{p}}{2 } ) ] _ { gh } [ k(k-\\ell)]_{ef}^{hg}~ , \\label{bse}\\ ] ] where @xmath75 _ schematically _ represent spinor , color and flavor indices . solving eq .",

    "( [ bse ] ) ] involve the full gluon propagator and the full quark - gluon vertex , which satisfy their own ds equations .",
    "they in turn involve higher @xmath80-point functions and their ds equations , etc .",
    "this infinite tower of the integral ds equations must be truncated to make the problem tractable @xcite .",

    "the nonperturbative phenomenon of d@xmath8sb is the most important feature .",
    "phenomenological ds studies have therefore mostly been relying on the _ consistently _ used rla , where d@xmath8sb is well understood @xcite .",

    "( [ ouralpha_eff ] ) ] .",
    "these light - quark propagators are then employed in bs equations for quark - antiquark ( @xmath86 ) relativistic bound states .",
    "the most important advantage of adopting rla in the context of low - energy qcd is that d@xmath8sb and , consequently , the appearance of light pseudoscalar mesons as ( almost-)goldstone bosons in ( the vicinity of ) the chiral limit , is well - understood and under control in this approximation scheme @xcite .",
    "solving the bs equation in the chiral limit gives the vanishing pion mass , @xmath87 .",
    "more generally and precisely , the light pseudoscalar masses @xmath88 , as required by qcd through gell - mann  oakes  renner ( gmor ) relation .",
    "all this is a manifestation of the correct chiral qcd behavior in the ds approach , in which all light pseudoscalar mesons ( @xmath89 ) manifest themselves _ both _ as @xmath86 bound states _ and _ ( almost-)goldstone bosons of dynamically broken chiral symmetry .",
    "this resolution of the dichotomy  @xmath86 bound state _ vs. _ goldstone boson \" , enables one to work with the mesons as explicit @xmath86 bound states while reproducing ( even analytically in the chiral limit ) the famous results of the axial anomaly for the light pseudoscalar mesons , most notably the @xmath90 decay amplitude @xmath91 in the chiral limit @xcite .",
    "this is unique among the bound state approaches  e.g. , see refs . @xcite and references therein for discussion .",
    "nevertheless , one keeps the advantage of bound state approaches that from the @xmath86 substructure one can calculate many important quantities ( such as the pion decay constant @xmath92 ) which are just parameters in most of other chiral approaches to the light - quark sector .    .",
    "masses @xmath93 , decay constants @xmath94 and @xmath11 decay amplitudes @xmath95 of the pseudoscalar @xmath77 bound states @xmath96 and @xmath97 resulting from our gluon condensate - induced @xmath98 ( [ ouralpha_eff ] ) , along with the parameter values fixed in ref .",

    "it also employed the consistently coupled ds approach but using the jain  munczek effective interaction @xcite instead of our eq .",
    "( [ ouralpha_eff ] ) .",
    "the treatment of the @xmath2@xmath99 complex used here was largely formulated already in ref .",
    "@xcite , except that it did not consider the interplay of the su(3 ) flavor symmetry breaking and the gluon anomaly , which was taken into account in ref .",
    "@xcite and found important for the successful meson phenomenology .",
    "the present paper , employing a different interaction , confirms its importance and further clarifies it by displaying explicitly the interplay of @xmath108 and @xmath109 in the mass relations ( [ meta8])-([ourschwingerform ] ) .",
    "while the reproduction of the @xmath2 and @xmath99 masses in ref .",
    "@xcite was similarly successful , we find that our @xmath110 decay widths agree with the experiment much better now , although the error bars shrunk as the precision of the experimental widths substantially increased in the meantime  @xcite .    concerning the agreement with other approaches",
    ", we may point out that the @xmath2@xmath3 mass matrix obtained on lattice by ukqcd collaboration @xcite agrees reasonably well with our model mass matrix if we insert in it our values of @xmath108 , @xmath109 , @xmath111 , and @xmath107 .",
    "we should also recall that already ref .",
    "@xcite clearly showed that our ds approach and results are not in conflict , but in fact agree very well with results in the two - mixing - angle scheme ( reviewed and discussed in , e.g , ref .",
    "@xcite ) . actually , ref .",
    "@xcite showed that our results can also be given in the two - mixing - angle scheme , but it is defined with respect to the mixing of decay constants , and therefore in our case , as in the ds approach in general , the scheme with one angle defining the mixing of the states is more convenient .",
    "another important general feature of the consistent ds approach which also holds in the present paper , is the correct chiral qcd behavior , so that all light pseudoscalar mesons constructed in our approach are both @xmath86 bound states and ( almost-)goldstone bosons of d@xmath8sb . in the chiral limit for all quark flavors , the anomalous mass matrix @xmath112 [ with @xmath113 , eq .",
    "( [ m2a ] ) ] is the only nonvanishing contribution as @xmath114 .",
    "thus , in this limit @xmath115 with vanishing mass , and @xmath116 with the mass @xmath117 (= 0.904 gev in column @xmath118 and similarly in the other columns ) , which is the only non - vanishing pseudoscalar mass in that limit , being induced purely by gluon anomaly .",
    "this chiral - limit mass @xmath117 is thus only 6% below the experimental @xmath3 mass .",
    "even with the realistic breaking of the chiral symmetry ( as in table [ tab : eta - etap - mixing - ope - new ] ) which rises the @xmath2 by more than 0.5 gev , our mixing angles show that @xmath2 and @xmath3 are much closer to , respectively , the ( almost-)goldstone octet @xmath119 and non - goldstone singlet @xmath120 than to @xmath121 and @xmath105 ( which is why in this section we switched from @xmath122 to @xmath123 ) .",
    "for example , column @xmath118 , with @xmath124 , implies @xmath125 where squaring of the coefficients @xmath126 and @xmath127 says that @xmath2 is 93.4% @xmath119 and 6.6% @xmath120 , and reverse for @xmath99 .    in conclusion ,",
    "the consistently coupled ds approach with the effective interaction ( [ ouralpha_eff ] ) enhanced by the gluon condensates gives a very good description of the @xmath2@xmath3 complex .",
    "this was achieved along the lines formulated in refs .",
    "@xcite , where the consistently coupled ds approach was extended by assuming the mass shift of the singlet @xmath120 due to the gluon anomaly . after ref . @xcite found the model parameters for which the gluon - condensate - enhanced interaction ( [ ouralpha_eff ] ) leads to a sufficiently strong d@xmath8sb , pions and kaons as ( quasi-)goldstone bosons of qcd , and their successful ds phenomenology , this minimal extension was the only new element in the otherwise fixed model .",
    "this was enough to successfully model @xmath2 and @xmath3 mesons without any parameter re - fitting , which is not very surprising after the success with pions and kaons in ref .",
    "@xcite . in refs . @xcite and especially @xcite we have already given good descriptions of @xmath2 and @xmath3 employing the jain  munczek effective interaction @xcite , which is however purely modeled at the low and intermediate energies .",
    "in contrast , the important intermediate - momentum behavior of the presently used interaction ( [ ouralpha_eff ] ) may be actually understood in terms of gluon condensates , instead of just modeled .",
    "in addition , this interaction has presently given the description of @xmath2 and @xmath3 which is on the whole somewhat better than in refs .",
    "@xcite , especially in view of the increased precision of the @xmath128 measurements @xcite .",
