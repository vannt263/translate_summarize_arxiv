    "during recent years there has been a considerable improvement of experimental and theoretical results for the production of @xmath0-mesons above the @xmath1 resonance region .",
    "extensive and accurate data were obtained for the reaction @xmath8 and to a lesser extent for @xmath9 .",
    "furthermore , an amount of data is now available for @xmath0 photoproduction on quasifree protons and neutrons , where the knocked - out nucleons are detected in coincidence with @xmath0-mesons .",
    "the energy region of a special interest corresponds to the excitation of the nucleon - like resonance identified in the particle data group listing as @xmath10 and marked there by three stars .",
    "the first question with respect to this particle concerns its status .",
    "this resonance clearly seen by several partial wave analysis ( pwa ) groups , e.g.  @xcite , but was not found in the gwu @xmath11 analysis @xcite .",
    "another aspect is related to the distinct role of @xmath10 in the physics of pentaquarks .",
    "this state was assumed in @xcite to be a nonstrange member of the antidecuplet representation ( @xmath12 ) of the pentaquark multiplet @xmath13 .",
    "this assumption was then used to scale the masses of @xmath12 members , and thus was the most crucial input for further search of @xmath14 , the @xmath15 member of this baryon group . at the same time , as it is discussed in @xcite in this case a question arises , how to reconcile a small width of @xmath14 ( less than 1 mev according to the estimations noted in @xcite ) with rather broad structure of its presumable nonstrange partner @xmath10 ( on average 100 mev according to pdg  @xcite ) . as is emphasized in @xcite , this principal difference seems to contradict an expectation that the widths of particles entering the same multiplet should be comparable .",
    "another problem with @xmath10 as a member of @xmath12 is its too large mass .",
    "it is about 30 mev larger than the value required by the gell - mann - okubo rule @xcite , if one takes for the mass of @xmath16 , the heaviest member of @xmath12 , the value 1862 mev reported in @xcite .    to resolve the discrepancy , it was suggested in refs .",
    "@xcite that another @xmath3 state has to be put on the place of a nonstrange @xmath12 member . like the @xmath10",
    "this new state was assumed to be highly inelastic with the main nonstrange decay modes @xmath17 and @xmath7 .",
    "but contrary to @xmath10 it should have a smaller decay width @xmath18 mev and a lower mass @xmath19 mev .",
    "a modified pwa analysis of @xmath11 @xcite , modified in such a way that it becomes more sensitive to baryons with smaller widths has shown that there are narrow regions in the baryon spectrum around 1680 and 1730 mev where exotic states might exist . moreover , as was shown in @xcite , due to the specific isotopic structure of the @xmath20 transition , this resonance should be photoproduced mostly on a neutron rather than on a proton .    from the considerations above",
    "it is clear that a natural way to verify the theory of @xmath12 is to look for a narrow structure in the energy dependence of the total cross section for photoproduction of @xmath0 and other light mesons on neutrons .",
    "first steps in this direction were made in the experimental works of graal @xcite , cb - elsa @xcite , and lns - tohoku @xcite where the cross section for @xmath21 was extracted from the reaction on the deuteron .",
    "the preliminary data really seem to exhibit a peak around @xmath22 gev what roughly corresponds to the @xmath23 invariant mass @xmath24 mev , if one assumes the initial neutron to be at rest in the target .",
    "the question about the nature of the observed peak was already touched upon on the phenomenological basis in @xcite .",
    "the present paper is partially intended to provide a calculation of the reaction @xmath25 that would not suffer from different uncertainties , like the oversimplified treatment of the fermi motion and final state interactions .",
    "moreover we present the results for some asymmetries of this reaction in order to study their sensitivity to the possible contribution of a narrow @xmath3 state .",
    "another point related to the @xmath3 problem has a more practical aspect .",
    "it deals with the ratio @xmath26 of the neutron to the proton cross section for @xmath0 photoproduction around the lab photon energy 1020 mev .",
    "this ratio measured for quasifree nucleons in @xcite exhibits a clear resonance behavior with the width about 100 mev .",
    "a natural explanation of this phenomenon would be an existence of a baryon resonance which is predominantly excited on a neutron . in the etamaid model  @xcite",
    "this feature is assigned to @xmath27 .",
    "the results of etamaid2001 for @xmath26 give quite a good account of the data @xcite .",
    "however the problem with etamaid2001 is that the @xmath17 decay width @xmath28 needed to fit the data for @xmath8 is an order of magnitude larger than the value , suggested by the pdg listing ( less than 1@xmath29 of @xmath30 ) and visibly exceeds the boundaries given by the @xmath31 analysis ( about 3@xmath29 of @xmath30 ) @xcite .",
    "the latter discrepancy is especially unsatisfactory inasmuch as the @xmath27 state is a member of a well established baryon octet with branchings determined by the broken @xmath31 symmetry .",
    "this inconsistency was already discussed in @xcite .",
    "it would therefore be interesting to see whether an inclusion of a hypothetic narrow @xmath5 baryon into the production amplitude instead of a too strong @xmath27 could provide a reasonable explanation of the structure seen in @xmath26 .",
    "although the nucleon - like member of @xmath12 is assumed to be very narrow , the effect of broadening needed to fit the data might be due to fermi motion in the deuteron .",
    "in addition to the previous works where only the @xmath17 channel was explored , we also pay some attention to kaon and double pion photoproduction . according to the results of @xcite",
    "there is a non - vanishing probability for the exotic @xmath3 to decay into @xmath32 and @xmath33 states .",
    "for instance , the @xmath7 mode was estimated in @xcite on the level of 30@xmath29 .",
    "if the members of @xmath12 are predominantly excited on a neutron , it is clear that from the experimental point of view , the easiest way to investigate the @xmath34 transition is to measure the reaction @xmath35 .",
    "the other channels will contain strong proton contributions , and like in the @xmath0 case this will lead to the necessity to single out the neutron reaction .",
    "so far in the region around @xmath36 gev only one measurement of @xmath35 was reported in @xcite , which furthermore has very large experimental uncertainties . here",
    "we present our results for the corresponding total cross sections , where the role of @xmath5 in @xmath37 and kaon photoproduction can be seen .    in section",
    "ii we outline the model used for our calculation of @xmath9 and show our results for different channels and observables in section iii . in section",
    "iv we close with a summary and conclusions .",
    "in this section we briefly review the formal ingredients of the quasifree @xmath0 photoproduction on the deuteron @xmath38 taking as independent variables the 3-momentum of the proton @xmath39 in the deuteron lab frame and the spherical angle @xmath40 of the @xmath0-meson momentum @xmath41 in the @xmath42 c.m .",
    "system , one obtains for the unpolarized cross section @xmath43 where the phase space factor reads @xmath44 in eq .",
    "( [ 20 ] ) @xmath45 and @xmath46 are the photon and the proton energies in the lab frame and @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the nucleon mass and the @xmath42 invariant energy .",
    "the final state is determined by total spin @xmath49 of the @xmath50 system .",
    "the index @xmath51 denotes the photon polarization and @xmath52 stands for the deuteron spin .    as for the polarization observables , we considered only the asymmetries having counterparts in the elementary reaction @xmath53 .",
    "namely , wee took the ( linear ) beam asymmetry @xmath54 , the target asymmetry for vector polarized deuterons @xmath55 , and the beam - target asymmetry @xmath56 for circularly polarized photons and vector polarized deuterons . for their definitions",
    "we take the formulas similar to those obtained in ref .",
    "@xcite @xmath57 with @xmath58 .",
    "note that the last observable ( [ 53 ] ) differs by a factor @xmath59 from that given in @xcite . in this form",
    "it is equal to the familiar gdh integrand for the deuteron @xcite . in a simpler form",
    "the corresponding formulas read @xmath60 here @xmath61 ( @xmath62 ) is the cross section with the photon beam polarized perpendicular ( parallel ) to the reaction plane .",
    "@xmath63 where @xmath64@xmath65 corresponds to the target polarized `` up '' ( `` down '' ) in the direction of @xmath66 .",
    "finally , the spin asymmetry ( [ 53 ] ) reads @xmath67 where @xmath68 and @xmath69 correspond to the photon spin oriented parallel and antiparallel to the deuteron spin . in the case of a free nucleon , the vector polarization @xmath55 corresponds to the target polarization @xmath70 and the beam - target double polarization @xmath71 corresponds to the polarization observable @xmath72 .",
    "more precisely , if we neglect fermi motion we get @xmath73 the effect of fermi motion can best be seen on the fact that in parallel kinematics the absolute value of the double polarization @xmath71 is not exactly 1 as in the case of a free nucleon .    to construct the single nucleon operator for @xmath0 photoproduction we use the @xmath0-maid analysis developed in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the resonance contribution in the partial wave @xmath74 is parameterized in terms of standard breit - wigner functions @xmath75 where a hadronic phase @xmath76 fixes a relative sign between the @xmath77 and the @xmath78 couplings . for most of the states the phases @xmath79 were treated as free parameters in the fitting procedure . as principal fit parameters of our analysis we used the resonance masses @xmath80 , the total widths @xmath81 , the branching ratios @xmath82 and the photon couplings @xmath83 .",
    "however , we fix those parameters , where reliable results are given by pdg , see tables  [ ta1 ] and  [ ta2 ] . for more details of the parametrization of the energy - dependent widths and the vertex function @xmath84 we would like to refer the reader to refs .",

    "the former was found in ref .",
    "@xcite taking the octet - antidecuplet mixing angle from @xcite .",
    "as is noted in @xcite more recent information about this parameter points to a larger value of @xmath93 which might result in an increasing total @xmath3 width up to @xmath94 30 mev .",
    "furthermore , as pointed out in @xcite this latter value should be an upper bound of the resonance width treated as undetectable in their modified @xmath11 pwa .",
    "the neutron photocoupling of @xmath5 is chosen according to the phenomenological analysis of ref .",
    "@xcite and the chiral quark - soliton model calculations of ref .",
    "@xcite .    to calculate the cross section on the deuteron we use a production operator valid in an arbitrary frame of reference . for this purpose",
    "we resort to the standard scheme to pass from the cgln amplitudes @xmath95 to the lorentz invariant amplitudes @xmath96 ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the effects of final state interaction ( fsi ) were included within a method where rescatterings within the pairs of particles are taken into account up to the first order in the corresponding two - body @xmath97-matrices .",
    "in general we have @xmath98 where the first term on the r.h.s .",
    "stands for the impulse approximation , which for the noncoherent reaction is equivalent to the spectator nucleon model .",
    "the terms @xmath99 and @xmath100 include one - loop @xmath50 and @xmath17 rescattering mechanisms as is explained in @xcite .",
    "the operator @xmath101 can schematically be presented as a sum of the elementary operators referring to a proton and a neutron @xmath102 where @xmath103 acts on the @xmath104th nucleon .",
    "the actual results , e.g. for a quasifree neutron , are obtained by setting @xmath105 in the expression ( [ 77 ] ) .",
    "the last two terms in eq .",
    "( [ 75 ] ) contain interaction between the corresponding particles . for formal details , concerning the treatment of fsi effects in @xmath25",
    "we refer the reader to ref .",
    "before going to the details it is instructive to estimate possible contributions of @xmath5 into different channels . for this purpose we use the formula which gives the partial cross section at the resonance position @xmath106 @xmath107 here the factor @xmath108 @xmath109 takes into account isotopic separation of the @xmath110 vertex .",
    "in particular one obtains @xmath111 taking @xmath112 and the @xmath5 helicity amplitudes as well as the widths from table  [ ta3 ] ( for a moment we take @xmath91  mev ) we will have at the resonance point @xmath106 @xmath113 the so obtained @xmath3 partial cross sections have to be compared to the characteristic values of the corresponding total cross sections in the region @xmath114 mev @xmath115",
    "@xmath116    thus , already these simple estimations show that the channel @xmath117 provides the largest value of the ratio ( @xmath118/background ) and might be the most favorable . in other channels",

    "@xcite . ]",
    "we continue our discussion turning to the total cross section of @xmath9 shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] as a function of the photon laboratory energy .",
    "firstly , it demonstrates the influence of the final state interaction ( fsi ) which is visualized as a scattering of the produced particles in the two - body subsystems @xmath50 and @xmath17 .",
    "as is explained in @xcite the effect is essential in the region @xmath119 mev , so that its inclusion is absolutely necessary to restore the agreement with the low - energy data @xcite . in the vicinity of the @xmath1",
    "peak the fsi effect mostly comes from the absorbtion of the produced @xmath0 mesons on the deuteron through the transition to pions .",
    "this situation is quite typical for reactions proceeding through the resonance excitation . for heavier nuclei",
    "it results in a strong absorption rate @xcite , so that the interaction of the produced @xmath0-mesons with the target is predominantly of a diffractive character .",
    "clearly , in our case this effect is softened by a small number of nucleons in the deuteron . with increasing energy the influence of fsi vanishes , so that the ia should be considered as a good approximation to the reaction dynamics .",
    "this result is quite foreseeable , since both @xmath50 and @xmath17 interaction are important almost exclusively in the @xmath120-waves which occupy only a very small fraction of the phase space available at high energies .",
    "the influence of fsi becomes more visible in the @xmath0 angular distribution presented on the right panel of fig .",
    "however , the general validity of ia shows that our notion about the process on the deuteron as the one taking place on one of the nucleons with another nucleon mainly behaving as a spectator is justified .    in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] we show our results for the total cross section on quasifree nucleons calculated within the strong @xmath121 approach ( i ) and the narrow @xmath3 model ( ii ) . in the same figure the dashed lines are the corresponding single nucleon cross sections .",
    "firstly , as we can see , the fermi motion strongly influences the parameters of the @xmath3 peak .",
    "namely its width becomes about 7 times larger in comparison to the free nucleon , whereas its position remains unchanged . in this context",
    "we also note that even though the peak observed in @xcite is quite narrow , the width @xmath91 mev seems to be somewhat too small in order to fit the experimental results .",
    "if we change from 10 mev to 30 mev the agreement with the cb - elsa data is improved .",
    "it is interesting that although the model ( i ) does not reproduce the shape of the quasifree neutron cross section around @xmath122 gev ( left upper panel in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) , it gives quite a good description of the rapidly varying quantity @xmath26 presented on the right panel .",
    "analyzing the energy dependence of @xmath123 and @xmath124 one can conclude that a narrow structure in this ratio is primarily due to a shoulder in the proton cross section .",
    "it becomes less distinct in the deuteron , because of filling the slight minimum in @xmath124 at @xmath36 gev , what should be a natural consequence of a smearing effect caused by the fermi motion . as a result , the theoretical ratio @xmath26 turns down from 1.4 to about 1.2 . at the same time , it is somewhat strange that this natural change is not supported by the preliminary experimental results  @xcite ( filled circles in the middle panels ) .",
    "the latter remain to be better described by the maid calculation for a free proton .    as is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] the model predicts a visible modification of the form and the height of the @xmath1 peak when we pass from the free nucleon to the bound nucleon in the deuteron .",
    "the main reason is that the phase space factor @xmath125 for three particles ( [ 20 ] ) increases more slowly than the two - body phase space in the elementary process . as a result ,",
    "the resonance form of the amplitude folded by @xmath125 is slightly shifted to the right on the energy scale . in the vicinity of @xmath5 , where the effects caused by the mass difference between the nucleon and the deuteron become insignificant ,",
    "the peak position in the reaction on a deuteron nearly coincide with the one on the free nucleon .",
    "photoproduction on a deuteron versus the photon lab energy .",
    "the results are presented for the strong @xmath121 model ( i ) ( upper row ) and the narrow @xmath3 model ( ii ) ( lower row ) .",
    "the dashed curves show the corresponding single nucleon cross sections .",
    "the dash - dotted and the solid curves on the left and the right panels in the lower row are obtained with @xmath126 mev and @xmath127 mev respectively .",
    "the free nucleon cross section corresponds to @xmath126 mev . the preliminary data from ref .",
    "@xcite are normalized to the etamaid calculations in the first maximum . ]    as we can see from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] our calculation with @xmath128 predicts quite a pronounced peak also in the total cross section on a free proton . in this connection it seems to be reasonable to analyze the available data for @xmath8 @xcite using finer energy binning in the corresponding energy region . as an example we plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig2a ] our predictions for the @xmath129 and @xmath54 asymmetry for three different @xmath0 angles in @xmath17 c.m .  system .",
    "in particular , the results show that the nonpolarized cross section is more sensitive to the @xmath3 contribution in the backward angular region , whereas in the beam asymmetry this resonance should be visible in both hemispheres .",
    "photoproduction on a free proton .",
    "the solid and the dash - dotted curves are calculated with the reggeized model  @xcite ( without @xmath5 ) and the ordinary etamaid model ( i )  @xcite .",

    "@xcite for the beam asymmetry . ]",
    "as already noted , while both reaction mechanisms ( i ) and ( ii ) give similar results for the total cross section , due to the different orbital momentum of the @xmath121 and @xmath3 resonances , they will show up with different angular distributions .",
    "this difference is clearly seen in fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] , where we show our calculations for a neutron at @xmath131  mev for a ) the strong @xmath121 model ( i ) , b ) the narrow @xmath3 model ( ii ) with a phase @xmath132 and c ) the narrow @xmath3 model ( ii ) with a phase @xmath133 .",
    "photoproduction on a quasifree neutron in a deuteron calculated at @xmath131  mev .",

    "the dotted lines show the observables on a free neutron , where @xmath134 and @xmath135 .",
    "the asymmetries are defined in eqs .",
    "( [ 51 ] ) to ( [ 53 ] ) . ]    in the angular distribution the hadronic phase becomes important , since the @xmath3 partial wave interferes with other partial waves like the @xmath136 .",
    "in the total cross section it can only interfere with other contributions in the same partial wave , e.g. from the background , and the difference can hardly be seen .",
    "as we can see the model ( ii ) predicts quite a weak linear dependence of the unpolarized cross section , what is obviously explained by the dominance of the electric @xmath137 and magnetic @xmath138 dipole amplitudes . in the ideal case of only @xmath136 and @xmath3",
    "partial waves one obtains @xmath139 for @xmath136 and @xmath121 we have a more complicated angular dependence which is symmetric with respect to @xmath140 @xmath141 where the coefficients @xmath142 , and @xmath143 are quadratic forms of the multipoles @xmath144 , @xmath145 , and @xmath146 .",
    "of course , in the real situation the observed cross section can not be explained entirely by only two resonances so that this ideal picture is distorted by the presence of other , less important , states with different quantum numbers .    in the same figure",
    "we demonstrate angular distributions of @xmath0-mesons , obtained with polarized photon beam and target .",
    "as already noted , for the polarization observables we took only those , which can easily be interpreted for quasifree reactions .",
    "the photon asymmetry @xmath54 given by the strong @xmath121 model ( i ) visibly overestimates that provided by the narrow @xmath3 model . in the extreme case of pure @xmath121 amplitude we will have @xmath147 . on the contrary , in the model ( ii )",
    "the nontrivial @xmath54 asymmetry is only due to interference of the @xmath136 and the @xmath3 waves with higher spin states .",
    "the same is true for the vector target asymmetry @xmath148 . here again the model ( i ) demonstrates typical @xmath121 behavior with strong rise at forward angles and crossing zero close to @xmath149 .",
    "the model ( ii ) gives the nonzero value of @xmath148 due to interference of the dominating resonances @xmath136 and @xmath3 with other resonance states having @xmath150 .",
    "the last asymmetry is therefore relatively small and should be more model dependent .",
    "the angular distribution shown by the gdh - asymmetry @xmath71 is what one could expect from the results for the nonpolarized cross section on the left upper panel . here",
    "the model ( ii ) with the dominating @xmath151 mode contributes only to the antiparallel component @xmath69 in @xmath152 . as a consequence",
    ", one sees about the doubled value of the corresponding nonpolarized cross section in accordance with the definition ( [ 53 ] ) , which again exhibits quite a weak angular dependence .",
    "the @xmath121 resonance gives a strong parallel component @xmath68 , so that the resulting asymmetry qualitatively reproduces the unpolarized angular distribution with two distinct peaks .",
    "as for the other channels @xmath37 and @xmath32 , here the situation is less clear . according to our estimates at the beginning of this section ,",
    "these channels seem to be not so effective as a tool to detect @xmath5 . as an example , in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] we present our predictions for the corresponding cross sections . in the @xmath37 case the corresponding signal is rather weak .",
    "moreover , the differential cross section could be difficult to analyze , since there are too many parameters involved . in the charged channels the angular distribution at such a high energy is mostly localized in the forward direction .",
    "this is due to dominance of the pion contact term , where a virtual pion becomes a real one by the coupling of the photon with the pion current .",
    "clearly the importance of this peripheral mechanism makes the angular distribution more difficult to interpret in terms of low powers of @xmath153 .    in the neutral channel @xmath154",
    "the cross section is more sensitive to resonance contributions .",
    "however , the corresponding angular distribution turns out to be symmetric with respect to @xmath140 regardless of the parity of the resonances which contribute .",
    "this is a trivial consequence of the identity of the produced pions and thus the corresponding analysis can hardly be useful . furthermore , according to the results of ref .",
    "@xcite , in the region of 1 gev the important role might be played by the excitation of @xmath155 , so that @xmath3 or @xmath121 seem to be much less important . in @xmath156 photoproduction",
    "the peak although being more visible is located just on the top of the slope and therefore could be difficult for experimental identification .     and @xmath157 .",
    "dashed and solid curves are obtained with and without a narrow @xmath5 resonance .",
    "the dash - dotted curve on the right panel is the corresponding free neutron cross section . ]",
    "we recall that the calculation presented in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] is performed under the assumption that @xmath5 decays with almost equal probabilities into all three channels @xmath17 , @xmath7 , and @xmath32 ( see table  [ ta3 ] ) .",
    "therefore , if the partial widths will be better known in the future , the height of the peaks in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] as well as in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] could easily be scaled using , e.g. , the formula ( [ 80 ] ) .",
    "however , we can expect that our qualitative conclusion about the preference of the @xmath17 channel as a tool to study a @xmath3 resonance will hardly be changed , until its mode remains on a level of more than 10 - 20 @xmath29 .",
    "we have calculated photoproduction of @xmath0 mesons in the region above the @xmath136(1535 ) resonance , where an unusually narrow structure has been observed in recent experiments for @xmath158 on quasifree neutrons in a deuteron @xcite .",
    "one of our main objectives was to investigate the impact of fermi motion and fsi on the elementary process @xmath159 . from the presented studies we are confident that the description within the spectator model is good in the entire region overlapping @xmath5 .",
    "as it is shown the corrections from the fsi are on the percent level so that the parameters of the single nucleon cross section can be deduced directly from the data .",
    "the fermi motion effect results in essential smearing of a narrow structure in the cross section , like peaks and shoulders , what in some important cases leads to visible changes in the reaction characteristics .",
    "altogether , we find that the presence of an exotic narrow resonance with a width about 10 - 30 mev can explain the cb - elsa data @xcite .    in a recent paper of  @xcite",
    "another mechanism based on the strong contribution of @xmath10 to @xmath21 was considered .",
    "the authors showed that the bump structure in the cross section can be explained in terms of @xmath160 contributions without resorting to an exotic narrow @xmath5 state considered in the present paper . in this respect",
    "we note that according to the pdg analysis  @xcite as well as to the parameter set presented in  @xcite both @xmath161 and @xmath10 are coupled more strongly to @xmath162 than to @xmath163 .",
    "therefore , it is reasonable to expect that the same mechanism will produce even more pronounced bump in the cross section for @xmath8 which is however not experimentally observed . in the present paper",
    "we suggested another explanation .",
    "namely , our purpose was to assign the structure to a narrow @xmath3 state , which ( i ) is in accord with the chiral - soliton model  @xcite , ( ii ) has a strong photocoupling to a neutron , and ( iii ) could elude identification in pwa due to its small width .",
    "another point to discuss is whether the available data reveal a true resonance in the reaction on a neutron at @xmath164=1020 mev . as is seen from fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] crucial is the behavior of the cross section at 930 mev , where according to the cb - elsa results there is clear minimum . if we assume for the moment , that the minimum vanishes in the improved data analysis",
    ", then we will see only a wide structure .",
    "it might appear as a resonance in the @xmath123 to @xmath124 ratio simply because of slight minimum exhibited by the proton cross section at @xmath131 mev .",
    "therefore , more general question concerning the experimental results for @xmath21 is why the neutron cross section is so high above the @xmath1 region , as compared to what we see on the proton .",
    "it is quite unlikely that here we deal with the interference of the resonances with the nonresonant background .",
    "the latter seems to be insignificant in @xmath0 photoproduction , primarily due to the smallness of the @xmath165 coupling @xcite . among the known resonances there are ( according to pdg ) no states predominantly excited on a neutron and , at the same time , having a sufficiently large @xmath17 branching ratio .",
    "therefore , even if future investigations do not support the existence of a narrow @xmath5 , the question about the nature of the @xmath0 photoproduction on the neutron ( and eventually on the proton ) above the @xmath136 will remain open .    as is noted in  @xcite it is a small width that can be used as a sign that the resonance particle , observed e.g. in meson production",
    "should be attached to the @xmath12 group of baryons and not to the ordinary baryon octet ( in the case of @xmath166 mixture we can speak about dominating antidecuplet part in the particle wave functions ) .",
    "however it should be noted that if , for example , the analysis of the partial waves points to the dominance of an @xmath151 configuration in the @xmath21 amplitude it could be quite difficult to distinguish between the usual @xmath3 with its typical hadronic width of 100 mev and an exotic narrow state @xmath3 from @xmath12 .",
    "as the calculation shows the fermi motion strongly smears the narrow resonance structure , so that in both cases we see a broad peak .",
    "therefore , it is to expect that no simple test exists for discrimination between the ordinary and exotic @xmath3 resonances .",
    "we thank v.kuznetsov for providing us with graal data , b. krusche and i. jaegle for the preliminary cb - elsa data and i.strakovsky for many helpful discussions .",
    "the work was supported by the deutsche forschungsgemeinschaft ( sfb 443 ) .",
    "is supported by the sofja kowalewskaja programme of the alexander von humboldt foundation ."
