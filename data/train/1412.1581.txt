    "the _ tree - depth _ of a graph is a minor montone graph invariant that has been defined in @xcite , and which is equivalent or similar to the _ rank function _ ( used for the analysis of countable graphs , see e.g.   @xcite ) , the _ vertex ranking number _ @xcite , and the minimum height of an elimination tree @xcite .",
    "tree - depth can also be seen as an analog for undirected graphs of the cycle rank defined by eggan @xcite , which is a parameter relating digraph complexity to other areas such as regular language complexity and asymmetric matrix factorization .",

    "the tree - depth of a graph is the minimum number of colors in a _ centered coloring _ of @xmath1 , that is in a vertex coloring of @xmath1 such that in every connected subgraph of @xmath1 some color appears exactly once @xcite .",

    "a strongly related notion is vertex ranking , which has has been investigated in @xcite .",
    "the _ vertex ranking _ ( or _ ordered coloring _ ) of a graph is a vertex coloring by a linearly ordered set of colors such that for every path in the graph with end vertices of the same color there is a vertex on this path with a higher color .",

    "thus on the one side the classes of graphs with bounded expansion include most of the sparse classes of structural graph theory , yet on the other side they have pleasant algorithmic and extremal properties .    on the other hand , one could ask whether for proper minor - closed classes one could ask there exists a stronger coloring than the one given by low tree - depth decompositions .",
    "precisely , one can ask what is the minimum number of colors required for a vertex coloring of a graph @xmath1 , so that any subgraph @xmath15 of @xmath1 gets at least @xmath76 colors .",

    "the original motivation of low tree - depth decomposition was to prove the existence of a triangle free graph @xmath15 such that every triangle - free planar @xmath1 admits a homomorphism to @xmath15 , thus providing a structural strengthening of gr \" otzsch s theorem @xcite . recall that a _ homomorphism _ of a graph @xmath1 to a graph @xmath15 is a mapping from the vertex set @xmath47 of @xmath1 to the vertex set @xmath48 of @xmath15 that preserves adjacency .",
