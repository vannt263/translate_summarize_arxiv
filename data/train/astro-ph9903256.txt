    "with the detection of afterglows in radio , optical and x - ray from several gamma ray burst events as well as with the measurement of redshifts corresponding to a few of these transient sources , there has been a tremendous enhancement in the understanding of grbs ( e.g.@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", if the redshift estimates are correct , the extragalactic nature of grbs stands confirmed , settling a three decade old controversy .",
    "however , as far as gamma emission is concerned , the diversity in time - profiles , spectral variability , duration etc . observed with regards grbs still poses a major challenge to the theoretical models . for most grbs",
    ", the gamma - ray time history shows complex structures with several peaks .",
    "a proper understanding of the origin of peaks is still lacking , although many ideas have been proposed in the literature ( e.g. @xcite ) . as a step to study such peaks in a systematic manner",
    "we direct our attention , in this paper , to 65 short duration grbs ( @xmath1 less than 2 seconds ) contained in the 3b catalogue , and analyse their temporal properties after fitting the gamma ray time - history of each burst with a collection of lognormal functions .",
    "individual peaks in most grbs exhibit a rapid rise and slow decay , and therefore , it is convenient to fit each such peak with a lognormal function , @xmath2 } &   \\mbox { $ t>0 $ } \\\\                                  0   &   \\mbox{$t \\leq 0 $ }          \\end{array }          \\right.\\ ] ]    where @xmath3 is the photon counts in the peak at time @xmath4 while @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 are the associated free parameters that are fixed after obtaining a best fit . to begin with ,",
    "the position of a peak is taken to be the point at which the first differential of the time history goes from positive to negative .",
    "a low pass filter is applied several times to eliminate spurious peaks arising out of background noise .",
    "having identified the genuine burst peaks , a reduced @xmath8 is calculated after making an initial estimate of free parameters for each peak , and then these parameters are changed iteratively till @xmath8 changes by only @xmath9 percent .",
    "the final numerical values at which the iteration converges are taken to be the best - fit parameters .",
    "the fit is accepted only if the final @xmath8 is close to @xmath10 ( for details , see @xcite ) and the best fit parameters are then used to calculate the following quantities associated with a given burst :    1 .",
    "burst complexity index(ci ) : this is defined as the number of peaks detected in a given burst .",
    "we find that bursts with higher ci are less in number , and that average value of ci is 2.48 implying that on an average the bursts have 2 to 3 peaks .",
    "risetime @xmath11 : risetime of a peak is taken to be the time interval during which the value of the fitted lognormal function increases from @xmath12 to @xmath13 of its maximum value .",
    "decaytime ( @xmath14 ) : decaytime is the time interval during which the fitted counts in the peak falls from @xmath15 to @xmath16 of its maximum value .",
    "@xmath17 : @xmath17 is defined as the ratio of @xmath18 to @xmath19 . since",
    ", most grbs lack redshift information , use of this ratio in the analysis has a merit in the sense that because of the cancellation of stretching of @xmath18 and @xmath19 due to cosmological expansion , @xmath17 is independent of burst redshift .",
    "we compute this ratio for the first peak , second peak and so on for all bursts with a given ci , and then consider the average value of @xmath17 corresponding to first , second and so on . since , @xmath17 does not depend on the distance of the grb event , any systematic trend exhibited by the value of @xmath17 averaged over different bursts with a given ci has a physical significance .",
    "the results have been summarized in table 1 .",
    "it is evident from the table that later peaks tend to be more symmetric than the earlier ones in a monotonic fashion .",
    "peak asymmetry evolution parameter ( paep ) : in order to study the evolution of @xmath17 within a burst , we plot @xmath17 against the peak number for bursts with ci @xmath20 3 ( 27 of them ) and fit with a straight line .",
    "paep is defined to be the slope of the fitted line - a positive value indicates that the peaks in the corresponding burst tend to become more symmetric as time evolves . in our analysis , we find that paep is positive in @xmath21 cases out of 27 bursts , while only 3 bursts show negative values for paep .",
    "we provide a histogram of paep in fig.1 .",
    "the average paep observed for bursts with ci @xmath20 3 is @xmath22 while the histogram attains its maximum value when paep @xmath23 0.1 .",
    "short duration grbs exhibit a strong evolutionary trend - later peaks tend to assume a more symmetric time profile .",
    "this is seen both on an average in bursts with any ci ( as is apparent from table 1 ) as well as in individual bursts , evident from the fact that paep is positive in 90 @xmath24 of the cases studied .",
