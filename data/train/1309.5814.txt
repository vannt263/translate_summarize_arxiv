    "some shortcomings were present in the approach proposed in refs.@xcite and a better formulation of the meson cloud model was proposed within a time ordered perturbation theory in the infinite momentum frame @xcite . using time ordered approach one has , in fact , the advantage that the struck hadrons remain on - mass - shell avoiding ambiguities and allowing the use of experimental structure functions as input .",
    "the question of a possible quark - antiquark asymmetry in the strange sea received new interest in the early 2000 s as a result of the experimental evidence of the nutev collaboration @xcite for a significantly smaller value of the weak mixing angle .",

    "in fact the non - singlet evolution of the parton densities at three loops level ( next - to - next - to - leading order : nnlo ) generates a strange asymmetry of the order @xmath22 at @xmath23 even if the strange asymmetry is vanishing at the starting scale , an effect which occurs in both qcd and qed , and it is a genuine quantum phenomenon @xcite . as a consequence the three - loops level is the correct and needed order for discussing parton distributions when strange sea is included , in particular strange asymmetry @xcite , @xcite .",
