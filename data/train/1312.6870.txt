    "therefore , dust loses angular momentum due to gas - dust friction and drifts towards the central star .",
    "the radial drift speed is given by @xcite @xmath85 in the case of the minimum mass solar nebula , @xmath86 and @xmath87k , we obtain @xmath88 therefore , at 100 au we obtain @xmath89 .",

    "observations of protoplanetary disks show that ring structures form at a radius of about 100 au .",
    "we evaluate the most unstable wavelength and the growth timescale of the instability at a radius of 100 au for the case of a @xmath102 central star , a temperature of 28k , and a dust stopping time @xmath103 .",
    "we assume the case @xmath104 , corresponding to a marginally gravitationally stable disk , a high dust - to - gas mass ratio , @xmath105 , and @xmath106 .",
    "these parameters corresponding to @xmath107 .",
    "then , the most unstable wavelength is about 13 au , and the growth timescale is about @xmath108 yr .",
    "these results are consistent with the observation because the disk lifetime is about @xmath109 yr and the observed ring width is a few tens of au .",
    "the dust radius that corresponds to a stopping time @xmath110 in this disk is about 4 mm .",
    "the amplitude of the dust surface density eigenfunction is larger than that of gas surface density .",
    "this means that the dust - to - gas mass ratio increases as the perturbation grows .",
    "therefore , the instability forms a ring - like structure where the dust is concentrated .",
    "if the dust is sufficiently concentrated , gravitational instability of the ring will occur and the resulting gravitational collapse and fragmentation of the ring will form planetesimals .",
    "therefore , the present instability is important for the formation of planetesimals and rocky planet at outer disk radii of around 100au . planetesimals or rocky planets located at outer radii may survive disk gas dispersal .",
    "they occasionally collide with each other over a long timescale and provide small dust if the collisions are destructive . after gas dispersal , small dust is replenished by the collisional destruction of planetesimals , and rocky planets are expected to form a debris disk of solid particles .",
    "hence , these objects may provide a unique origin for debris disks , because the dust grains in debris disks have a short lifetime and the debris disk requires continuous replenishment of dust grains .",
    "therefore , the two - component secular gi may play an important role in the formation of debris disks .",
    "some of the observed rings are not axisymmetric . to investigate non - axisymmetric accumulation of gas and dust in the azimuthal direction ,",
    "we need a linear analysis for non - axisymmetric modes observations of the dust continuum show the dust surface density is about 10 times larger than that of the gap . to compare the resultant structure of the instability with observations",
    ", we have to investigate the non - linear effects of the instability . in this work",
    "we treat the dust as a fluid that diffuses out by the gas turbulence with diffusivity @xmath12 .",
    "since the condition for the instability depends on @xmath12 , a more realistic treatment of the dust is important for further analysis .",
    "if ring structures formed by the two - component secular gi are observed , it may be an indicator of the dust concentration and week turbulence in the disk .",
    "the secular gi has been investigated for planetesimal formation .",
    "@xcite has performed the linear stability analysis of the the secular gi taking into account the velocity dispersion of the dust particles ( see section [ other_effects ] ) , but not taking into account the diffusion due to the turbulence .",
    "@xcite takes into account the diffusion due to the turbulence and found that the dust diffusion decreases the growth rate of the secular gi .",
    "these previous works solved only the equations for dust in the keplerian rotation gas disk .",
    "they did not taking into account the back reaction from the dust to the gas since the surface density of the dust is usually much smaller than that of gas . in this work ,",
    "we take into account the back reaction and solve equations for both gas and dust .",
    "we have found that when the growth timescale of the instability is much longer than the dynamical timescale , the back reaction is not negligible even if the surface density of the dust is smaller than that of gas .",
    "in such a case , coriolis force stabilizes the long wavelength perturbations .",
    "the condition for the two - component secular gi is approximately given by equation ( [ eq : condition_for_unstable2 - 2 ] ) .",
    "therefore , the terms proportional to @xmath111 stabilize the long wavelength perturbations . in the following ,",
    "we show that these terms come from the coriolis force . from the equations of motion for gas and dust ,",
    "the equations for the relative velocity are given by @xmath112 @xmath113 where we use @xmath114 ( terminal velocity approximation ) .",
    "using ( [ eq : eoc_gas_l ] ) and ( [ eq : rev_y ] ) to eliminate @xmath115 , @xmath116 and @xmath117 from ( [ eq : rev_x ] ) , we obtain @xmath118\\delta v_x\\nonumber\\\\ & & = \\left[\\omega^2 +    i\\frac{{c_{\\rm s}}^2k^2}{\\omega}\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{{t_{\\rm stop}}}+\\left(\\frac{1+\\epsilon}{{t_{\\rm stop}}}\\right)^2\\right]\\delta u_x .",

    "as mentioned above , the radial motion of the gas is suppressed by the pressure ( equation ( [ eq : rev_x ] ) ) . on the other hand",
    ", there is no force to suppress the rotational velocity of the gas .",
    "therefore , the rotational velocity of the gas is similar to that of the dust ( equation ( [ eq : duy_dvy ] ) ) .",
    "the coriolis force due to the radial velocity of the dust accelerates the dust in the y - direction and also gas through friction .",

    "this equation means that the coriolis force balances the frictional drag force . in this case",
    ", the long - wavelength perturbations appear to be always unstable .",
    "thus , in @xcite the maximum @xmath56 for the secular gi is given by the condition @xmath137 .",
    "however , @xmath138 is usually much larger than the dynamical timescale . therefore the back reaction should not be neglected and it lowers the maximum @xmath56 for the instability .",
    "also solve the equations for both the gas and the dust but they focused on dust rich disks . in general , the existence of the growth rate much smaller than the dynamical timescale corresponds to the near cancellation of various acceleration terms in equation of motion for the unstable mode . in this case , even a very small term possibly contributes significantly to the growth rate , and thus , should not be neglected .",
    "we investigate instability due to gas - dust friction in protoplanetary disks by a local analysis using two - fluid equations for gas and dust .",
    "this instability is reduced to the secular gi if we ignore dynamical feedback from dust grains in the gas equation of motion .",
    "we obtain the approximate dispersion relation , equation ( [ eq : desp_2fluid_sgi ] ) , and the condition for the instability , equation ( [ eq : app_condition_for_instabiity3 ] ) .",
