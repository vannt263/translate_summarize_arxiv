    "once a neutral higgs boson ( @xmath5 ) is discovered , determining its coupling to @xmath6 bosons ( @xmath7 ) is of fundamental importance .  ,",
    "refs .  @xcite . ]",
    "it is this coupling which most directly reflects the role of the @xmath8 in electroweak symmetry breaking . in the minimal standard model ( sm ) , where the higgs sector consists of a single higgs doublet field",
    ", there is only one physical higgs boson eigenstate , with coupling @xmath9 , where @xmath10 is the @xmath11 coupling and @xmath12 is the weak mixing angle .",
    "in contrast , in a theory with many scalar doublets and/or singlets , the @xmath1 couplings of the individual neutral higgs bosons ( @xmath13 ) are generally reduced in magnitude , but must obey the sum rule @xcite @xmath14 ^ 2 $ ] .",
    "the sum rule becomes still more complicated if triplet higgs representations are present .",
    "precise determination of @xmath7 for each and every observed @xmath8 will therefore be crucial to knowing whether or not we have found all the higgs bosons that participate in electroweak symmetry breaking and to understanding the full structure of the higgs sector .    in @xmath0 collisions ,",
    "the dominant higgs boson production diagrams involving the @xmath15 coupling are of two types : @xmath16 there is ( constructive ) interference of the amplitude for @xmath17 with that for ( [ fusion ] ) .",
    "however , it is desirable both for simplicity and in order to maximize experimental accuracy for the @xmath7 determination to impose cuts such that this interference is very small ; the @xmath18 ( [ bj ] ) and @xmath1-fusion ( [ fusion ] ) amplitudes can then be considered as leading to effectively independent production processes .",
    "the main point of this paper is to demonstrate that , in the case of a light higgs boson , when the @xmath0 collider is operated at full energy ( e.g. @xmath19 ) , the @xmath1-fusion production mode will make a crucial contribution to the determination of the @xmath2 coupling .",
    "indeed , by combining the @xmath1-fusion and @xmath3 production processes we find that the error for @xmath7 achieved at @xmath19 can be competitive with that which is attained using @xmath3 associated production ( alone ) at lower @xmath20 near the maximum in the @xmath3 cross section .",
    "further , if the linear collider is run in the @xmath21 mode , the only source of @xmath5 production , and only means for determining the @xmath2 coupling is from @xmath1-fusion @xmath22 @xcite .",
    "= 4.25 in = 4.25 in    processes  ( [ bj ] ) and ( [ fusion ] ) have quite different characteristics . for a lighter higgs boson and lower center of mass energy ( @xmath20 ) process  ( [ bj ] ) dominates ( with a maximal cross section at @xmath23 ) , while for a heavier higgs boson or higher @xmath20 , process  ( [ fusion ] ) becomes more important ( the cross section increasing logarithmically with @xmath20 ) .",
    "this is shown in figure  [ crosssection ] , where we present the total cross section for @xmath24 ( solid ) as a function of @xmath20 for several higgs boson masses , @xmath25 and 200 gev .",
    "dashed curves present the contribution only from @xmath26 with @xmath27 .",
    "note that the @xmath1 fusion cross section becomes larger than that of @xmath3 for @xmath28 gev .    in both the @xmath18 and @xmath1-fusion channels",
    ", the higgs signal can be easily detected for @xmath29 by reconstructing the higgs mass peak via the @xmath8 decay products .",
    "however , in order to determine the @xmath15 coupling in a _ model - independent _ manner (  independent of the @xmath8 s branching ratio to any particular channel ) , it will be crucial to identify the higgs signal through the `` recoil mass '' variable , @xmath30 where @xmath31 is the invariant mass of the final state lepton pair and the @xmath32 are the lepton energies in the c.m .",
    "frame ; here , @xmath33 is possible for process  ( [ bj ] )   peak using the @xmath34 ( hadronic ) decays in eq .",
    "( [ bj ] ) in order to increase the signal statistics .",
    "however , the energy / momentum resolution for jets is much worse than for leptons and the backgrounds in the hadronic decay channels are larger , implying a less sharp signal peak above background .",
    "thus , we will consider only the leptonic modes .",
    "] while only @xmath35 is relevant for process  ( [ fusion ] ) .",
    "due to detector resolution effects , @xmath36 will display a peaked distribution of finite width , much broader than the physical width of a light higgs boson , centered about @xmath37 . if we can measure the inclusive cross section associated with the @xmath36 peak in such a way that there is small sensitivity to the @xmath8 decay , then we can obtain a direct determination for the @xmath15 coupling @xmath7 .",
    "since we allow the higgs to decay to anything , our background is composed of many processes . for @xmath35 ,",
    "for example , we must consider all processes of the type : @xmath38 with @xmath39 and @xmath40 .",
    "many analyses of the process  ( [ bj ] ) in the inclusive @xmath36 context have appeared in the literature ; see , for example , @xcite and references therein .",
    "however , process  ( [ fusion ] ) has received limited attention @xcite . in particular , complete",
    "background computations for the inclusive signal are given for the first time in the present paper .",
    "the rest of the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "2 we explore the relative importance of the processes ( [ bj ] ) and ( [ fusion ] ) for determing @xmath41 ( assuming a sm - like @xmath8 ) , and comment on the @xmath22 @xmath1-fusion production mode .",
    "section  3 summarizes our results and their implications for the relative importance ( for the @xmath7 determination ) of running at @xmath19 vs. lowering @xmath20 to a value near the maximum in the @xmath3 cross section .",
    "in order to reconstruct the signal peak in @xmath36 via eq .",
    "( [ recm ] ) , we must assure that the charged leptons are detected .",
    "thus , we impose the following `` basic '' acceptance cuts @xmath42 the polar angle cut roughly simulates the detector acceptance for a beam hole of 150 mrad @xcite , and the cut on @xmath31 is imposed in order to suppress events from photon conversion .",
    "the sharpness of the reconstructed @xmath36 peak is determined by the momentum / energy resolution for the charged leptons .",
    "the energy of an electron ( but not that of a muon ) can be measured in the electromagnetic calorimeter .",
    "the momentum of either a muon or an electron can be determined from a tracking measurement of its curvature in the magnetic field of the detector .",
    "we consider two possibilities for the energy resolution of the electromagnetic calorimeter :    *  nlc / em   @xmath43 ; *  cms / em   @xmath44 .    where @xmath45 denotes the sum in quadrature and @xmath46 is in gev .",
    "case i is that currently discussed for the nlc electromagnetic calorimeter @xcite ; case  ii is that of the cms lead - tungstate crystal @xcite .",
    "we also consider two possibilities for the momentum resolution from tracking :    *  nlc / tracking   @xmath47 ; *  sjlc / tracking   @xmath48 ,    with @xmath49 in gev .",
    "case iii is that specified for the typical nlc detector in @xcite and case iv is that quoted for the `` super - jlc '' ( sjlc ) detector design @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that for an electron the tracking determination of its momentum is not statistically independent of the electromagnetic calorimeter measurement of its energy .",
    "thus , the two measurements can not be combined ; one should use whichever measurement provides the best result . in order to provide a clean comparison of the different possibilities",
    ", we will present results in which we analyze all events using either the calorimeter energy measurement or the tracking measurement ;  we do not choose the best measurement on an event - by - event basis .",
    "it is useful to compare the fractional resolutions , @xmath50 ( @xmath51 for @xmath33 ) , for the different cases to one another as a function of energy / momentum . using @xmath52 in iii ,",
    "one finds that @xmath53 for any @xmath54 ( lower @xmath46 for @xmath55 in the forward or backward direction ) and that @xmath56 for @xmath57 . at @xmath19 ,",
    "lepton energies above @xmath58 are typical for the light higgs masses studied here ; then , nlc / tracking will not be useful for an electron , whereas sjlc / tracking might be , depending upon the em calorimeter .",
    "since the muon energy / momentum can only be measured by tracking , nlc / tracking will result in the @xmath59 channel having a poorer signal to background ratio than either the @xmath60 or the @xmath1-fusion @xmath61 channel .",
    "on the other hand , if the machine energy is lower ,  near the peak in the @xmath18 cross section for small @xmath37 , electron energies are smaller , and for the majority of events the nlc / tracking measurement of the electron energy is competitive with the nlc / em measurement",
    ". this will be apparent from the figures in the next section .    to suppress the sm background more effectively and for physics clarity , it is beneficial to divide the study into the two natural categories : the @xmath3 associated production and @xmath1 fusion processes .      we first discuss a linear collider with @xmath19 . in order to isolate the @xmath18 class of events we require @xmath64 the mass cut",
    "largely eliminates the leading background from @xmath65 and the polar angle cut helps reduce the other large background from @xmath66 . since the @xmath6 boson in the signal is not only central , but also energetic with @xmath67 , we can further reduce the background by imposing a cut of @xmath68 the signal to background ratio is improved after the cuts to the extent that the higgs must be nearly degenerate with the @xmath6 for the @xmath36 peak to have any significant background .",
    "figure  [ recmass2 ] presents the recoil mass distributions , @xmath69 , for @xmath70 at @xmath71 .",
    "results for different energy / momentum resolutions , cases i - iv , are shown in the four different panels .",
    "the solid and dashed curves give the @xmath18 signal for @xmath72 and @xmath73 , respectively .",
    "the dotted line is the summed sm background .",
    "= 5.0 in = 3.5 in    the @xmath74 cross section reaches a maximum near @xmath75 .",
    "a relevant question is how much improvement is possible by running the machine at a lower energy nearer the maximum cross section , as would be possible once @xmath37 is known ( either from lhc or nlc data ) . to illustrate",
    ", we consider @xmath76 .",
    "figure  [ recmass250 ] shows the recoil mass distributions , @xmath69 , similar to those in fig .",
    "[ recmass2 ] but for @xmath77 .",
    "we see not only that the cross section rate is larger , but also that the signal peak is much sharper because of the better determination for lepton energy / momentum at this lower @xmath20 .",
    "= 5.0 in = 3.5 in    we estimate the relative statistical error for the cross section measurement as @xmath78 where @xmath79 and @xmath80 are the numbers of signal and background events for a given luminosity ; neglecting systematic uncertainty from correcting for our cuts , this is also the error on the coupling @xmath41 . in table",

    "when running at the full energy of @xmath19 , if @xmath162 then ( for nlc / em and nlc / tracking ) the combined @xmath18 and @xmath1-fusion error of table  [ ultimate ] is very close to that obtained when running at @xmath76 _ for the same integrated luminosity_. further , it seems likely that it will prove desirable from the point of view of other physics to accumulate more luminosity at @xmath19 than at @xmath76 , and it is also possible @xcite that the instantaneous luminosity at the lower energy will be lower ( assuming that the interaction region is optimized initially for @xmath19 ) . in either case",
