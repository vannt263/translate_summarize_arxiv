    "there has been considerable interest in precision measurements@xcite of the muon anomalous magnetic moment factor @xmath0 the anomaly factor is measured from the chiral asymmetry rotation frequency @xmath1 largely due to experimental improvements in creating an extremely homogeneous magnetic field @xmath2 , there have been recent improvements@xcite in the accuracy of @xmath3 determinations .",
    "in addition to the anomaly frequency of eq.(2 ) , there are three other frequency scales of interest in the experiments .",
    "the cyclotron frequency is given by @xmath4 which is also determined by the homogeneous magnetic field .",
    "due to electrostatic focusing capacitors , there are two more frequencies having to do with collective oscillations of the beam as a whole .",
    "these are the vertical betatron oscillations at frequency @xmath5 and the horizontal betatron oscillations at frequency @xmath6 . in the literature@xcite , the ratios @xmath7 and @xmath8 are called , respectively , the vertical tune and horizontal tune .    recent experiments@xcite yield a vertical tune of @xmath9 with a _ measured _ effective index of @xmath10 previous theoretical considerations@xcite lead to a horizontal tune of @xmath11",
    "the horizontal tune has been measured by the muon decay oscillations themselves .",
    "( see @xcite and @xcite wherein the notation @xmath12 is used for @xmath6 . ) @xmath13 the discrepancy between the previous theoretical eq.(6 ) and the experimental eq.(7 ) is evident .",
    "one purpose of our work is to show that the previous theory is at fault .",
    "the index @xmath14 describes the electric field gradient inside the electrostatic focusing capacitors ; it is @xmath15 where @xmath16 is the radius of the cyclotron , @xmath17 is the muon velocity , @xmath18 is the component of the electric field parallel to the magnetic field and @xmath19 .",
    "the averaging is over a cyclotron orbit .",
    "some insight into the error of the previous theoretical eq.(6 ) becomes evident from the fact that when the electric field vanishes , @xmath20 , the horizontal tune is unity .",
    "such `` unit horizontal tunes '' are in reality _ not _ collective modes at all .",
    "a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field ( and zero electric field ) moves in a circle with a fixed center .",
    "if the center of circular orbit is _ not quite equal _ to the center of the cyclotron machine ( which is always the case ) , then the above corresponds to what has been called a unit horizontal tune .    however , the true nature of the horizontal betatron oscillation is that the center of the cyclotron orbit also rotates if and only if a non - zero electric field is applied .",
    "a central result of this work is that the center of the cyclotron orbit also moves in a circle at a horizontal tune of @xmath21 our theoretical eq.(9 ) is in satisfactory agreement with the experimental eq.(7 ) .    in order to understand the nature of the horizontal betatron tune , consider a toy `` hula hoop '' popular with children near the middle of the last century .",
    "pretend there are particles rotating within ( and relative to ) the hoop with angular velocity @xmath22 .",
    "further imagine the hoop rotating as a whole `` off center '' with an angular velocity @xmath6 .",
    "now remove the hoop since it is imaginary anyway .",
    "the remaining particle motions constitute a beam with a horizontal tune .    in sec .",
    "ii , the dynamics of the muon motion will be discussed starting from the hamiltonian @xmath23 where the magnetostatic and electrostatic fields are given , respectively , by @xmath24 for simplicity of presentation , we shall employ quantum mechanics for describing the beam dynamics but we shall not employ ( for now ) the spin dynamics which must be treated with a dirac hamiltonian and requires somewhat long and delicate spinor algebra@xcite . the full quantum dirac spinor algebra will be discussed elsewhere and should serve as a more accurate quantum replacement for the classical bmt equations@xcite .    in sec .",
    "iii , the coherent betatron frequencies will be derived from the hamiltonian eq.(10 ) . a physical description of the coherent betatron oscillations will be provided . in the concluding sec .",
    "iv , the consequences for the @xmath25 analyses due to the corrected horizontal tune theory will be explored .",

    "finally , we have the vanishing commutators : @xmath37={\\bf 0 } , \\",

    "there is sometimes simplicity in orbital pictures .",
    "note that the classical orbital equations are recovered by replacing commutators with poisson brackets : @xmath46 \\ \\to\\ { \\rm ( classical)}\\ \\ \\left\\{a , b\\right\\}\\ ] ] where @xmath47 in the classical orbit view wherein @xmath48 , one finds @xmath49    the quantum length scale for which the classical orbit picture breaks down can be deduced from the noncommutative geometry of the cyclotron center coordinate @xmath50 . from eq.(20 ) , the quantum uncertainties obey @xmath51 where @xmath52 for the muon experiments of interest @xmath53 cm , which allows for a classical orbit picture of high accuracy . even in the classical case ,",
    "the decomposition @xmath54 of the position in the plane is crucial for understanding the horizontal betatron oscillation mode .",
    "to compute the betatron vertical and horizontal tunes , one may expand the electric field @xmath55 in powers of the small displacements @xmath56 and @xmath36 . inside the electrostatic focusing capacitors @xmath57",
    "defining @xmath58 and taking only first powers of the displacement @xmath59 in eq.(29 ) yields @xmath60 to this accuracy , the vertical betatron oscillation frequency is given by @xmath61 in agreement with eqs.(4 ) and ( 8) .",
    "expanding the electric field in eq.(25 ) to linear order in @xmath36 yields @xmath62 where eq.(36 ) has been invoked . in the @xmath63 plane , the vector @xmath36 rotates with angular velocity whose magnitude is given by @xmath64 in agreement with eqs.(8 ) and ( 9 ) ; i.e. from eqs.(3 ) , ( 38 ) and ( 40 ) it follows that @xmath65    the horizontal oscillation is depicted in fig .  1 .",
    "if a particle is injected into the cyclotron at a somewhat skewed angle , then the center of the cyclotron orbit will be somewhat removed from the center of the cyclotron machine .",
    "the instantaneous center of the cyclotron orbit will itself move in a small circle at an angular velocity @xmath66 .",
    "the small circular rotations of @xmath36 induce a _",
    "wobble _ in the particle s ( almost ) circular orbit , at the same frequency @xmath6 .",
    "if a particle is injected into the cyclotron with a small velocity component @xmath67 normal to the plane , then the height @xmath56 of the particle undergoes oscillations with frequency @xmath68 . since , in virtue of eq.(36 )",
    ", there is but one electric field gradient parameter @xmath69 , the two betatron frequencies are not independent .",
    "they are related by eq.(41 ) .",
    "on a _ phenomenological _ basis , the chiral asymmetry of the muon decay is fit to experimental@xcite data by a function of the product form @xmath70 where the chiral rotation function is parameterized by @xmath71 the coherent horizontal betatron oscillation is parameterized by @xmath72 and the extra loss of muons from unknown physical processes are parameterized by @xmath73 the agreement between the experimental best fit@xcite @xmath74 and our theoretical prediction based on eqs.(8 ) and ( 9 ) @xmath75 gives us confidence that we have properly identified the source of horizontal betatron oscillations .",
    "it is something of a mystery to us why the experiment was designed so that @xmath76 is so very close to being a `` second harmonic '' of the anomaly frequency @xmath77 .",
    "if one wishes to go beyond the phenomenological view of how the electromagnetic field @xmath78 affects the coupling @xmath79 , one must employ the dirac - schwinger equation @xmath80 where @xmath81 .",
    "the interaction between the electromagnetic field and the anomalous magnetic moment is thereby @xmath82    the electric field coupling of eq.(49 ) via @xmath83 contains those degrees of freedom @xmath84 which enter into the kinetic energy @xmath85 in eq.(27 ) and also the cyclotron center coordinates @xmath86 which rotate as in eq.(39 ) .",
    "the experimentally observed coupling of the chiral rotation frequency @xmath87 to the horizontal betatron frequency @xmath76 is mainly due to the variation in @xmath36 .",
    "this coupling to @xmath36 dominates the electric field corrections to @xmath87 due to @xmath88 .    in assessing the electric field corrections to @xmath87@xcite , due to the variations in the radius @xmath89 of the beam orbit",
    ", the effect was doubly counted : ( i ) the time variations in @xmath90 were first counted in the function @xmath91 .",
    "( ii ) the time variations in @xmath90 were counted yet again as a bmt electric field correction .",
    "leaving out the over counting of the electric field corrections makes the experimental need for non - standard model corrections to the muon @xmath25 less compelling .",
