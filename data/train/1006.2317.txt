    "the absolute luminosities of stars can be simply expressed as the product of only two quantities : the total area of the radiating surface and the mean surface brightness of that same area .",
    "for spherical stars the area is readily calculated from the radius ; and the surface brightness is locally controlled by the temperature . for a radially pulsating star , such as a cepheid , its time variation in luminosity",
    "is also controlled by the coupled time variation of those same two physical parameters , radius and temperature . in this paper , we explore this property further , enabling us to use data obtained at multiple wavelengths to provide constraints on these parameters .",
    "the basic relations are captured by stefan s law in the definition of the effective temperature ( @xmath1 ) and its derivative .",
    "bolometrically    @xmath2    and    @xmath3    the differential form clearly demonstrates that the luminosity variation should be readily decomposed into two terms , a radius and a temperature term . since the temperature of a star is readily estimated from its ( optical ) colors , it follows that the surface area variation must be whatever residual remains after the color variation is scaled ( to a surface brightness ) and subtracted from the ( composite ) luminosity curve .",
    "this suggests a path whereby the two physical terms can be decoupled empirically and evaluated independently .",
    "the above equations apply to the bolometric luminosity .",
    "does this simplicity transfer over to empirically measured broad - band photometry ? at first sight , multi - wavelength observations ( of cepheids in particular ) might suggest that the situation is far more complicated , given that cepheid light curves at different wavelengths have fundamentally different shapes , systematically changing amplitudes and advancing phases of maximum light as a function of wavelength .",
    "see figure 1 for examples .",
    "early observers of cepheids noted that the amplitudes of those variable stars systematically decreased as a function of advancing wavelength ( wisniewski & johnson 1968 ) , where it was noted that the shapes of cepheid light curves became less triangular and more cycloidal in form as their amplitudes dropped .",
    "it was also seen that the timing of maximum light for cepheids was shifting to later phases , again as longer and longer wavelengths were explored ( see for example the atlas of multi - wavelength light curves in wisniewski & johnson ) .",
    "stebbins ( 1945 ) is the first to have noted the decreasing amplitude a cepheid ( by a factor of 3.4 for his observations of @xmath0 cep ) with increasing wavelength of his observations ( from u[3530 ] to i@xmath4[10,300 ] ) , and the concommitent shifting of maximum light to later phases ( by + 0.05 in phase over the same , u to i , wavelength range ) .",
    "the first practical use of these trends was made by freedman ( 1988 ; see below ) .",
    "the photometric behavior described above can be understood as follows : the asympototic ( long - wavelength ) behavior of a cepheid light curve is dominated by the ( geometric ) radius variation .",
    "it is well known from integrating radial - velocity curves of cepheids that the form of the radius variation with time is well described as being cycloidal in shape ( see , for example , radius and radial velocity data presented by imbert 1981 ) .",
    "since it is geometric in nature , the contribution of the radius variation to the light curve of a cepheid will be largely independent of wavelength , modulo small ( wavelength - dependent ) optical depth effects .",
    "if there were no additive temperature variations , any given cepheid s light curve would have the same shape at all wavelengths ; but observations indicate otherwise .",
    "a test can be made by subtracting two light curves obtained at different wavelengths .",
    "the differencing directly cancels out the equally - contributing radius term , and then leaves a pure temperture - driven term . at short wavelengths color",
    "is primarily driven by temperature . clearly then",
    ", by appropriately scaling the color curve and subtracting it ( in magnitude space ) from the luminosity curve one will be left with the areal variation ( i.e. , radius ) curve .",
    "these same precepts are at the heart of the baade - wesselink method , where photometry and radial velocities are combined to determine absolute radii and metric distances .",
    "the method we are describing here provides a way of measuring precision distances without the need for radial velocity measurements .",
    ", define the ( b - v ) color curve . the upper plot is a composite of k - band , near - infrared data ( k : open circles ) , and the cpr predicted radial - displacement curve ( f : filled circles ) obtained by scaling and subtracting the temperature variation from the observed luminosity curves leaving the radius variation .",
    "the similarity in the k and f curves is striking.,width=453 ]",
    "in a study of the local group dwarf galaxy , ic  1613 , freedman ( 1988 ) showed that one could use well - sampled b - band light curves , for example , to predict the amplitudes at i - band wavelengths , adjust the phasing appropriately , and predict the mean magnitude at i , based on a single observation at that longer wavelength .",
    "the scaling relations , rephasing and predicted light - curve shapes were only approximate , but given the factor of 2 - 3@xmath5 systematic reduction in amplitude in going from b to i the method provided a significant improvement to the mean magnitudes .",
    "subsequently , a number of follow - up studies introduced greater degrees of mathematical sophistication , a larger variety of templates ( stetson 1996 ; labhardt , sandage & tammann 1997 ) and more complicated fitting procedures , based , for example , on fourier decomposition ( e.g. , ngeow et al . 2003 ; soszynski , gieren & pietrzynski 2005 ) , principal component analysis ( as in tanvir et al .",
    "2005 ; kanbur & mariani 2004 ) , or a combination of both ( yoachim et al . 2009 ) .",
    "labhardt , sandage & tammann concluded that except for a brief period of time , during the ascending phase of the light curve , their method and that of freedman ( 1988 ) had the same precision ( see their figure 2 ) ; while fourier decomposition methods suffer from global fitting instabilities when samples are sparse or highly clumped , and especially when higher - order terms are included .",
    "nevertheless , with care each of the methods is capable of scaling light curves across wavelengths and reducing the scatter in the predicted / fitted mean .",
    "all of these methods are phenomenological . in the following",
    "we describe a physically - motivated approach , which is simpler and more precise .",
    "we refer to this as the carnegie photometric radial - displacement ( cpr ) method .",
    "scaling and subtracting the temperature variation to reveal the pure radius variations was first discussed by madore ( 1985 ) while attempting to produce a function that was minimally impacted by phase .",
    "the so - called feinheit function combines the luminosity and color in such a way so as to minimize the amplitude of the resulting light variation .",
    "this function , f = v - @xmath6@xmath5(b - v ) , reaches a minimum amplitude when the temperature variation is cancelled , leaving only the radius variation contributing to the light variation . as it turns out the color coefficient `` @xmath6 '' in the definition of the feinheit function is directly related to `` a '' in the baade - wesselink formalism used in calculating the logarithmic surface brightness from colors ( for example , see kervella et al .",
    "2004 for a recent application and compilation ) .",
    "the feinheit function then is numerically equivalent to the so - called `` photometric radial displacement '' .",
    "the values of the feinheit color coefficients `` @xmath6 '' statistically correlate with period ( see figure 3 in madore 1985 ) .",
    "it is reasonably expected that they are physically controlled by temperature ( i.e. , more directly correlated with intrinsic color . )        in figure 2 we first demonstrate the physical decomposition of an optical light curve into its temperature and radius components .",
    "we begin with the b and v light curves as plotted in the lower portion of the figure .",
    "we note the larger amplitude of the b - band light curve as compared to v. it is also easily seen , in comparison , that the b - band light curve has much more linear decline than the more rounded descending portion of the v - band light curve . a straightforward , point - by - point differencing of the two light curves results in the color curve plotted just above the b - band light curve .",
    "given that color maps directly to ( logarithmic ) temperature we have labelled that curve as log(t@xmath7 ) .",
    "we next scale the log(t@xmath7 ) curve and subtract its contribution from the b - band light curve giving rise to the radius curve delineated by the filled circles plotted across the top of the panel .",
    "the k - band light curve is widely considered to be dominated by pure radial variations ; those data are plotted as open circles in the same portion of the diagram . the coincidence is impressive given that only a vertical shift in the two magnitude scales was allowed .    in figure 3",
    "we make our final argument for f being identified with the radial displacement .",
    "the predicted radius curve ( f : filled circles ) and the overplotted k - band data ( k : open circles ) as already given in figure 2 ( above ) are reproduced , for convenience , at the bottom of this figure .",
    "we then take the first derivative of the k - band light curve and plot it as circled dots in the upper portion of the frame ( labeled `` radial velocity '' ) .",
    "over - plotted in that same part of the frame are published radial velocities for hv 2257 from ( imbert et al .",
    "1985 ; imbert 1987 ) .",
    "the only adjustment was the amplitude of the variation to match the logarithmic scaling of the photometric data .",
    "below , we quantify the level of this agreement .",
    "we conclude that k , f and radius are equivalent representations that allow a successful decomposition of optical light curves into physical quantitites .",
    "however , before moving on we offer the following discussion prompted by the kind suggestions made by the referee .",
    "consider the following equations describing the decomposition of the light variation in two distinct bands ( b and v , for example ) due to areal variations parameterized by @xmath8 and variations in the surface brightness induced by temperature variations , @xmath9    @xmath10    @xmath11    recalling that f = v - @xmath6(b - v ) this translates into    @xmath12 - 5~ log(\\theta ) - [ c_v - \\alpha(c_b - c_v ) ] \\times   2.5~log(t_{eff})$ ]    so by setting @xmath6 = @xmath13 the feinheit function ( by design ) eliminates the temperature variation .",
    "if the color - temperature relation is non - linear then the values of @xmath14 and @xmath15 will themselves change with temperature and so @xmath6 will also be expected to be a function of intrinsic color ( i.e. , temperature ) also . since longer - period cepheids are statistically redder ( cooler ) that short - period cepheids it follows that @xmath6 will also be a ( statistical ) function of period , which explains the correlation that was found and reported in madore ( 1985 ) , as stated earlier .    we now explore how the cpr method can be used in a practical sense through a series of decomposition and reconstruction examples . these range from galactic examples with dozens of observations covering half a dozen or more wavelengths , to lmc cepheids with extensive optical and near - infrared data , to cepheids at the edge of detectability in more distant galaxies where one or two observations are available beyond their ( optical ) discovery wavelengths .",
    "we now consider a galactic cepheid , yz cyg , for a further demonstration of the cpr decomposition and prediction method .",
    "this time we use bv data to predict the details of the slightly longer - wavelength light curve in the r band , but this time also to predict the light curve behavior at the shorter u - band wavelength . in the lower panel",
    "the published ubvr observations are shown as open circles . at the top of the panel",
    "are smoothed versions of the radius variation ( as derived only from the bv light curves ) , and the temperature curve again derived exclusively from the bv light curves . now immediately above the r - band observations",
    "is the predicted ( solid line ) r - band light curve based on the reprojected radius and temperature curves . below the u - band data is the ( solid line ) prediction for the ultraviolet light curve . to the eye",
    "they are indistinguishible .",
    "we now quantify that match .        in figure 4",
    "we isolate the r & u - band data and their predictions now showing the point - by - point reprojection of the combined radius and temperature curves back into the observational planes . below each curve",
    "is the run of differences between the observed and the predicted light curves .",
    "because no smoothing in the physical plane was applied , the residuals carry the full complement of the uncorrelated errors associated with all three of the b , v and r ( b , v and u ) data points that went into the various solutions .",
    "the calculated scatter in r - band comparison is @xmath160.013   mag ; the scatter in u is @xmath160.028 mag .",
    "the @xmath162-sigma bounds are plotted around the measured differences .",
    "there are no significant trends of the scatter with phase .",
    "the scatter is consistent with photometric errors in the combined data .        in figure 5",
    "we show the point - by - point prediction of jh & k light curves from the precision bv ccd data for hv 2257 taken from mofett et al .",
    "( 1998 ) . in the lower part of the panel",
    "we show the individually phased bv observations folded over 2.8 cycles . using these observations to produce radius and temperature curves",
    "we then reproject these data back into the observational plane but now at the three near - infrared jhk wavelength bands .",
    "those predictions are shown by open circles in the upper part of the panel .",
    "overplotted on the predicted values are the observed jhk data ( again as filled circles ) from persson et al .",
    "figure 6 shows the results of predicting lightcurves at longer ( r - band ) and shorter ( u - band ) wavelengths than the basis light curves .",
    "to within the observational scatter the observations and the predictions are indistinguishible .",
    "we close this series of demonstration cases with an example taken from the recent literature on multi - wavelength observations of cepheids significantly more distant and fainter than our galactic examples and about 40 times further away than the lmc .",
    "this is the cepheid c15 in the south polar group spiral galaxy ngc  300 .",
    "plotted as circled circles in the lower half of figure 7 are v and i data from gieren et al .",
    "from these two wavelengths we constructed temperature and radius curves , applied the cpr method and reprojected them into the k and j band passes for which there are random phase data from gieren et al .",
    "the fit of the predictions to the two observations in each of j and k are shown at the top of the figure . despite having switched from bv to vi for our physical decomposition basis",
    "the method demonstrably works here too in very accurately phasing up with the observed data .",
    "we have shown that the diversity of cepheid lightcurve amplitudes , shapes and relative phases , encountered over all currently available wavelengths , are reducible to two simple but also physically meaningful quantitities : radius and temperature .",
    "given a set of applicable scaling relations , the radius and temperature curves can be used to predict the exact form of any given cepheid s behavior at all currently observed wavelengths , from the ultraviolet to the mid - infrared ( see figure 8) . given this predictive tool set one can now realize enormous observational gains with no loss in signal - to - noise in extracting mean properties of cepheids at other wavelengths .",
    "this is especially true for deriving time - averaged mean magnitudes and mean colors , derived from sparsely - sampled , random - phase observations at even longer or shorter wavelengths .",
    "the next paper in this series will present and discuss the exact calibration of this method , for future applications especially at mid - infrared wavelengths where jwst will be fully operational .",
    "we than the referee for his / her detailed suggestion to make the physical - variable decomposition of the feinheit formalism more explicit ."
