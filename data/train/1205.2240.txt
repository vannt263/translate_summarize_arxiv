    "we consider the problem of estimating a @xmath3-signal or image @xmath4 from noisy observations @xmath5 here @xmath6 are independent normally distributed random variables ( the noise ) , @xmath7 is the level of discretization , and @xmath8 is the variance of the data ( the noise level ) .",
    "the signal @xmath4 is assumed to be a discrete approximation of some underlying continuous domain signal obtained by discretizing a function @xmath9^d \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] .",
    "one may think of the entries of @xmath4 as point samples @xmath10 on an equidistant grid .",
    "however , in some situations it may be more realistic to consider other discretization models .",
    "area samples , for example , are more appropriate in many imaging applications . in this paper",
    "we will not pursue this topic further , because most of the presented results do not crucially depend on the particular discretization model as long as @xmath4 can be associated with a function @xmath11^d \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] ( some kind of abstract interpolation ) which , in a suitable way , tends to @xmath12 as @xmath13 .",
    "the aim of denoising is to estimate the unknown signal @xmath14 from the data @xmath15 .",
    "the particular estimation procedure we will analyze in detail is soft - thresholding in frames and overcomplete dictionaries .",
    "we stress , however , that a similar analysis also applies to different thresholding methods , such as block thresholding techniques ( as considered , for example , in @xcite ) .      in order to motivate our results for thresholding for general frames we start by one dimensional wavelet soft - thresholding . for that purpose ,",
    "let @xmath16 denote an orthonormal wavelet basis of @xmath17 , where @xmath18 is the number of data points and @xmath19 the index set of the wavelet basis .",
    "wavelet soft - thresholding is by now a standard method for signal and image denoising ( see , for example , @xcite for surveys and some original references ) .",
    "it consists of the following three basic steps :    1 .",
    "[ it : thresh1 ] compute all empirical wavelet coefficients @xmath20 of the given noisy data with respect to the considered orthonormal wavelet basis .",
    "[ it : thresh2 ] for some threshold @xmath21 , depending on the noise level and the number of data points , apply the nonlinear soft - thresholding function @xmath22 to each wavelet coefficient of the data .",
    "the resulting thresholded coefficients @xmath23 are then considered as estimates for the wavelet coefficients of @xmath4 .",
    "notice , that the soft - thresholding function can be written in the compact form @xmath24 .",
    "further , it sets all coefficients being in magnitude smaller than @xmath25 to zero and shrinks the remaining coefficients towards zero by the value @xmath25 .",
    "[ it : thresh3 ] the desired estimate for the signal @xmath4 is then defined by the wavelet series of the thresholded empirical coefficients @xmath23 , @xmath26    every step in the above procedure can be computed in @xmath27 operation counts and hence the overall procedure of wavelet soft - thresholding is linear in the number @xmath7 of unknown parameters ( see @xcite ) .",
    "it is thus not only conceptually simple but also allows for fast numerical implementation .",
    "even simple linear spectral denoising techniques using the fft algorithm have a numerical complexity of @xmath28 floating point operations .",
    "besides these practical advantages , wavelet soft - thresholding also obeys certain theoretical optimality properties .",
    "it yields to an almost optimal mean square error simultaneously over a wide range of function spaces ( including sobolev and besov spaces ) and , at the same time , has a smoothing effect with respect to any of the norms in these spaces .",
    "hence soft - thresholding automatically adapts to the unknown smoothness of the desired signal  @xcite .",
    "any particular choice of the thresholding parameter @xmath25 is a tradeoff between signal approximation and noise reduction : a large threshold removes much of the noise but also removes parts of the signal .",
    "hence a reasonable threshold choice should be as small as possible under the side constrained that a significant amount of the noise is removed .",
    "the smaller the actual threshold is taken , the more emphasis is given on signal representation and the less emphasis on noise reduction .",
    "a commonly used threshold is the so called _ universal threshold _ @xmath29",
    "as proposed in the seminal work  @xcite , where the following result is shown .",
    "[ thm : donoho ] + suppose that @xmath30 are consistent with an underlying orthonormal wavelet basis @xmath31 on @xmath32 $ ] having @xmath33-times continuously differentiable elements and @xmath33 vanishing moments , that @xmath34 , for @xmath35 , denote point samples of a function @xmath36 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] and that @xmath37 are constructed by  ( [ eq : wave - soft ] ) with the universal threshold @xmath38 .",
    "then , there exists a special smooth interpolation of @xmath37 producing a function @xmath39 \\to { \\mathbb{r}}$ ] .",
    "further , there are universal constants @xmath40 with @xmath41 as @xmath42 , such that for any besov space @xmath43 which embeds continuously into @xmath44 $ ] ( hence @xmath45 ) and for which @xmath31 is an unconditional basis ( hence @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 for constants @xmath48 depending on @xmath43 and @xmath31 but neither on @xmath49 nor on @xmath7 .",
    "theorem  [ thm : donoho ] states that the estimate @xmath50 is , with probability tending to one , simultaneously as smooth as @xmath12 for all smoothness spaces @xmath43 .",
    "this result can be derived from the denoising property ( see @xcite and also section  [ sec : denoising ] ) @xmath51 for an orthonormal basis , the noise coefficients @xmath52 are independently distributed .",
    "hence equation  ( [ eq : noise - remove ] ) is a consequence from standard extreme value results for independent normally distributed random vectors @xcite .",
    "extreme value theory also implies the limiting gumbel law @xmath53 uniformly in @xmath54 .",
    "this even allows to exactly characterize all thresholding sequences @xmath25 yielding a denoising property like ( [ eq : noise - remove ] ) with @xmath25 in place of @xmath55 .    in the case",
    "that a redundant frame is considered instead of an orthonormal wavelet basis , then the empirical coefficients are no more linear independent and limiting result like ( [ eq : gumbel - wave ] ) are much harder to come up with . in this paper",
    "we verify that a similar distributional result as in ( [ eq : gumbel - wave ] ) holds for a wide class of redundant frames with @xmath7 replaced by the number of frame elements .",
    "this class is shown to include non - orthogonal wavelets , curvelet frames and unions of bases ( see theorems  [ thm : wave ] , [ thm : cs ] and [ thm : curve ] ) . roughly speaking ,",
    "the reason is , that the redundancy is of these frames weak enough that it asymptotically vanishes in a statistical sense and the system behaves as an independent system .",
    "however , we also an important example ( in the form of the translational wavelet system ; see theorem  [ thm : ti ] ) which shows that highly redundant systems may show a different asymptotic behaviour .",
    "our work is motivated by the well known observation that the universal threshold sigma @xmath56 often is found to be too large in applications , hence including too few coefficients into the final estimator ( see @xcite ) .",
    "this recently has initiated further research on refined thresholding methods and we would like to shed some light on this phenomenon for a large class of frame systems by providing a refined asymptotics as in ( [ eq : gumbel - wave ] ) in addition to results of the type ( [ eq : noise - remove ] ) .",
    "we also provide a selective review on current thresholding methodology where we focus on the link between statistical extreme value theory and thresholding techniques .      for any @xmath57 ,",
    "let @xmath58 denote a frame of @xmath59 , where @xmath60 is a finite index set , that consists of normalized frame elements ( that is , @xmath61 holds for all @xmath62 ) and has frame bounds @xmath63 ( compare section  [ sec : notation ] ) . our main results concerning thresholding estimation in the frame",
    "@xmath30 will hold for asymptotically stable frames , which are defined as follows .",

    "[ it : frame3 ] the upper frame bounds @xmath68 are uniformly bounded , i.e. , @xmath69 .",
    "the following theorem  [ thm : main ] is the key to most results of this paper .",
    "it states , that after proper normalization the distribution of @xmath70 converges to the gumbel distribution  provided that the frames are asymptotically stable .",
    "[ thm : main ] + assume that @xmath64 is an asymptotically stable family of frames , and let @xmath71 be a sequence of random vectors in @xmath59 with independent @xmath72-distributed entries .",
    "then , for every @xmath54 , @xmath73 the function @xmath74 is known as the gumbel distribution .    see section  [ sec : thm : main ] .    in the case that @xmath30 are orthonormal bases ,",
    "results similar to the one of theorem  [ thm : main ] follow from standard extreme value results ( see , for example , @xcite ) and are well known in the wavelet community ( see , for example ,  @xcite ) . however ,",
    "neither the convergence of the maxima including absolute values ( which is the actually relevant case ) nor the use of redundant systems are covered by these results . in section",
    "[ sec : ez ] we shall verify that many redundant frames , such as non - orthogonal wavelet frames , curvelets and unions of bases , are asymptotically stable and hence the limiting gumbel law of theorem  [ thm : main ] can be applied .",
    "based on this limiting extreme value distribution we provide an exact characterisation of all thresholds @xmath25 satisfying a denoising property similar to the one of ( [ eq : noise - remove ] ) for general frame thresholding ; see section  [ sec : evd - frame ] for details .",
    "suppose that @xmath75 is a sequence in @xmath76 converging to @xmath77 , let @xmath78 satisfy @xmath79 and let @xmath80 denote the wavelet soft - thresholding estimate with the threshold @xmath81 according to theorem  [ thm : main ] , the probability that @xmath4 is contained in @xmath82 tends to @xmath83 as @xmath13 .",
    "hence the sets @xmath84 define asymptotically sharp confidence regions around the given data for any significance level @xmath85 ; see section  [ sec : alphathresh ] for details .",
    "the proof of theorem  [ thm : main ] relies on new extreme value results for dependent chi - square distributed random variables ( with one degree of freedom ) which we establish in section  [ ap : evd ] . in the field of statistical extreme value theory , the following definition is common .",

    "we emphasize , however , that the corresponding normalizing sequences differ from those required for the maxima with absolute values . indeed",
    ", @xmath70 behaves as the maximum of @xmath95 ( opposed to @xmath96 ) independent standard normally distributed random variables ; compare with remark   [ rem : normalizing ] .",
    "the different fluctuation behaviour of the maxima with and without absolute values is not resembled by equation  ( [ eq : noise - remove ] ) , which is exactly the same for the maxima with and without absolute values . only in a refined distributional limit ( [ eq : gumbel - frame ] )",
    "this difference becomes visible .",
    "moreover , in the case that the frames @xmath30 are redundant , no result similar to theorem  [ thm : main ] is known at all .",
    "asymptotical stability typically fails for frames without an underlying infinite dimensional frame .",
    "a prototype for such a family is the dyadic translation invariant wavelet transform ( see section  [ sec : ti ] ) . in this case",
    ", the redundancy of the translation invariant wavelet system increases boundlessly with increasing @xmath7 , which implies that the corresponding upper frame bounds tend to infinity as @xmath13 .",
    "we indeed prove the following counterexample if condition  [ it : frame3 ] in definition  [ def : stab ] fails to hold .",
    "[ thm : ti2 ] + suppose that @xmath97 is a discrete translation invariant wavelet system with unit norm elements generated by a mother wavelet @xmath98 that is continuously differentiable , and let @xmath71 be a sequence of random vectors in @xmath59 with independent @xmath72-distributed entries .",
    "then , for some constant @xmath99 and all @xmath100 we have @xmath101    this follows from theorem  [ thm : ti ] , that we proof in section  [ ap : thm : ti ] .",
    "theorem [ thm : ti2 ] shows that the maximum of the translation invariant wavelet coefficients is strictly smaller ( in a distributional sense ; see section  [ sec : ti ] ) than the maximum of an asymptotically stable frame with @xmath102 elements and therefore the result of theorem  [ thm : main ] does not hold for a translation invariant wavelet system .",
    "moreover , theorem  [ thm : ti2 ] shows that there exists a thresholding sequence being strictly smaller than @xmath103 yields asymptotic smoothness ; see section  [ sec : ti ] for details .",
    "this also reveals the necessity of a detailed extreme value analysis of the empirical noise coefficients in the case of redundant frames .      in the following section  [ sec : thresh ] we introduce some notation used throughout this paper . in particular , we define the soft - thresholding estimator in redundant frames .",
    "the core part of this paper is section  [ sec : evd - frame ] , where we proof the asymptotic distribution of the frame coefficients claimed in theorem  [ thm : main ] .",
    "this result is then applied to define extreme value based thresholding rules and corresponding sharp confidence regions . moreover , in this section we show that the resulting thresholding estimators satisfy both , oracle inequalities for the mean square error and smoothness estimates for a wide class of smoothness measures .",
    "our proofs require new facts from statistical extreme value theory for the maxima of absolute values of dependent normal random variables that we derive in section  [ ap : evd ] .",
    "finally , in section in section  [ sec : ez ] discuss in detail several examples , including , non orthogonal frames , biorthogonal wavelets , curvelets and unions of bases in detail",
    "for the following recall the model  ( [ eq : problem ] ) and write @xmath104 for the noise vector in  ( [ eq : problem ] ) .",
    "we assume throughout that the variance @xmath105 of the noise is given . fast and efficient methods for estimating the variance are well known ( see , for example , @xcite for @xmath106 and @xcite for @xmath107 ) .    throughout this paper",

    "notice that in a finite dimensional setting any family that spans the whole space is a frame .",

    "the frame property ( [ eq : frame - prop ] ) implies that the frame operator @xmath121 is an invertible linear mapping .",

    "equation  ( [ eq : inv ] ) provides a simple representation of the given signal in terms of its analyzing coefficients .",
    "this serves as basis of thresholding estimators defined and studied in the following subsection . for further details on frames",
    "see , for example , @xcite .",
    "[ rem : frame ] it is not essential at all , that @xmath30 is a frame of the whole image space @xmath59 . in fact , in typical thresholding applications , such as in wavelet denoising , the space @xmath59 naturally decomposes into a low resolution space having small fixed dimension and a detail space having large dimension that increases with @xmath7 .",
    "the soft - thresholding procedure is then only applied to the signal part in the detail space and hence it is sufficient to assume that @xmath30 is a frame therein . in order to avoid unessential technical complication we present our results for the case of frames of the whole image space . in the concrete applications presented in section [ sec : ez ] the thresholding will indeed only be performed in some subspace ; all results carry over to such a situation in a straightforward manner .      by applying @xmath118 to both sides of  ( [ eq : problem ] ) , the original denoising problem in the signal space @xmath59",

    "the soft - thresholding estimator for @xmath4 with respect to the frame @xmath30 using the threshold @xmath25 is defined by @xmath143    hence the frame soft - thresholding estimator @xmath144 is simply the composition of analysis with @xmath118 , component - wise thresholding , and dual synthesis with @xmath127 .",

    "one could use other left inverses for defining the soft thresholding estimator  ( [ eq : est - soft ] ) . since , in general , @xmath145 is outside the range of @xmath118 , the use of a different left inverse will result in a different estimator .",
    "the special choice @xmath127 has the advantage that for many frames used in practical applications , the dual synthesis operator is known explicitly and , more importantly , that fast algorithms are available for its computation ( typically algorithms using only @xmath146 or even @xmath147 floating point operations @xcite ) .",

    "we conclude this section by commenting on the underlying rationale behind thresholding estimation and situations where it is expected to produce good results .",
