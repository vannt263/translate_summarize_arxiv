    "the remaining problem was whether the graphs for the case @xmath2 of ( 2 ) as in figure [ graph ] would be realized as ( dual ) principal graphs of subfactors .",

    "the result is essentially based on the result by a. coste and t.gannon in @xcite , that shows that the entries of the @xmath4-matrix of a modular tensor category are in some cyclotomic field .",
    "this implies that if the square of the perron - frobenius eigenvalue ( pfev ) of a graph is not a cyclotomic integer , the graph can not be the ( dual ) principal graph of a subfactor . utilizing this new fact ,",
    "the first author proved that the graphs in figure [ graph ] are not ( dual ) principal graphs for @xmath5 for @xmath6 by showing that for each @xmath6 , the galois group of the minimal polynomial @xmath7 of the square @xmath8 of pfev of each graph is not abelian : it is actually a symmetric group . by the kronecker - weber theorem ( @xcite ) , this implies that the @xmath8 s for @xmath9 in said range , are not cyclotomic integers .",
    "the first author also checked that for the case @xmath10 , @xmath11 is a cyclotomic integer .",
    "kondo s result in @xcite , that implies that the galois group of an irreducible polynomial with square - free discriminant should be symmetric , played an essential role there .    in this paper",
    "we prove , by further utilizing algebraic number theory , that none of the graphs in figure [ graph ] can be realized a ( dual ) principal graph for @xmath12 .",
    "we prove that the @xmath8 s for @xmath12 are not only not cyclotomic integers , but actually the field extension @xmath13 over @xmath14 is not even a galois extension : notice that if @xmath13 was contained in some cyclotomic field , the extension @xmath15 is necessarily galois , since it corresponds to a subgroup of an abelian group , which is automatically a normal subgroup .",
