    "the purpose of this article is to present some new results that call attention to the presence and effects of particular types of heterogeneity observed to occur in diverse geophysical and ecological / biological spatial environments .",
    "a few examples of interest to the authors are provided to highlight the occurrence of interfacial discontinuities , but one may expect that readers will easily be able to conceive of many others . apart from the motivating examples , theoretical results are provided to illustrate the interfacial effects in ways that may prove useful in analyzing and interpreting more complex data sets .",
    "the most basic empirical considerations involve various temporal measurements , e.g. , breakthrough times , residence or occupation times , recurrence times and , as will be explained , a fundamental notion of _ local time_.    mathematical local time is a quantity with a long history in the theory of stochastic processes .",
    "it concerns a mathematical measure of the amount of time a stochastic process spends locally about a point , which we will refer to as _ mathematical local time _ in distinction with a modification introduced here to be referred to as _ natural local time_. starting with the celebrated theorem of trotter @xcite establishing the continuity of mathematical local time for standard brownian motion , the general problem of determining necessary and sufficient conditions for continuity of local time for stochastic processes is an old and well - studied problem at the foundations of probability theory ; see @xcite for recent progress and insight into the technical depth of the problem for a large class of markov processes .",
    "while the present paper has little to offer to the mathematical foundations of the subject , observations from field and laboratory experiments are provided together with some theoretical results that point to new directions in this area from the perspective of applications and modeling of certain dispersive phenomena . at the most fundamental level ,",
    "the issue involves the _ units _ of measurement .",
    "in particular , the units of mathematical local time in the context of dispersion of particle concentrations are typically those of _ spatial length_. this is not unnatural in the mathematical context owing to the locally linear relationship between spatial variance and time when the dispersion coefficient is sufficiently smooth . however , as will be seen , this breaks down in the presence of an interface of discontinuity in the diffusion coefficient .",
    "effort is made to make this article accessible to a diverse audience by including some basic mathematical definitions and background theory .",
    "a complete and systematic treatment of essentially all of the underlying mathematical concepts can be found in @xcite .",
    "we conclude this introductory section with an empirical example that serves to motivate and illustrate the role of a key mathematical construct , namely that of _ skew brownian motion_. this is followed by a section with additional empirical illustrations from the ecological and biological sciences .",
    "the emphasis of the paper is on mathematical theory and modeling .",
    "the main results demonstrate ( i ) the effects of general point interface transmission probabilities on breakthrough times and ( ii ) on residence times ; ( iii ) symmetry ( via martingale ) relationships between interfacial transmission probabilities , dispersion coefficients , and skewness parameters ; ( iv ) a special role for continuity of flux ( conservation of mass ) verses continuity of derivatives at an interface ; ( v ) a special role for ( natural ) local time continuity in the determination of the transmission parameter at the interface .    .05 in * example a * ( _ * dispersion in porous media * _ ) .",

    "the up - welling along the malvinas current that occurs off of the coast of argentina ( see figure [ coastal ] ) is unusual in that it is the result of a very sharp break in the shelf , rather than being driven by winds .",

    "the location of the interface coincides with the distance to the shelf - break .",
    "in particular , if the spatial variable @xmath40 is viewed as a ` time ' parameter , then this is a skew - diffusion equation , but the physics imply continuity of the derivatives @xmath53 at the interface rather than ` flux ' ( see @xcite and references therein ) .    .05 in * example c * ( _ * fender s blue butterfly * _ ) .",

    "the determination of proper interface conditions is primarily a statistical problem in this application , however we will see that certain theoretical qualitative analysis may be possible for setting ranges on interface transmission parameters .",
    "there is a rapidly growing literature on the statistical estimation of parameters for diffusions , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "however much ( though not all ) of this literature is motivated by applications to dispersive models in finance for which the coefficients are presumed smooth and the data is high frequency .    .05 in * example d * ( _ * sustainability on a river network * _ ) .",
    "the movement of larvae in a river system is often modeled by advective - dispersion equations in which the rates are determined by hydrologic / geomorphologic relationships in the form of the so - called _",
    "horton laws_. in general river networks ( figure [ rivernetwork ] ) are modeled as directed binary tree graphs and each junction may be viewed as an interface .",
    "there are also special relations known from geomorphology and hydrology that can be applied to narrow the class of graphs observed in natural river basins ; e.g. , see @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , and references therein .",
    "[ rivernetwork ]        conservation of mass leads to continuity of flux of larvae across each stream junction as the appropriate interface condition .",

    "the following theorem provides a useful summary in one - dimension of the interplay between diffusion coefficients and broader classes of possible interfacial conditions . to set the stage we begin with brownian motion @xmath54 with constant diffusion coefficient @xmath1 and constant drift @xmath0 ;",
    "i.e. , @xmath55 is standard brownian motion starting at zero , with unit diffusion coefficient and zero drift . the stochastic process @xmath56 has a number of properties characteristic of diffusion .",
    "namely , the random path @xmath57 is continuous with probability one , and @xmath58 this makes @xmath56 a continuous semimartingale . in the case",
    "@xmath25 , @xmath56 is in fact said to be a ( continuous ) martingale .",
    "in general a continuous semimartingale is a process with continuous paths that differs from a ( local ) martingale by a ( unique ) continuous ( adapted ) process having finite total variation ( in the sense of functions of bounded variation ) .",
    "such structure is a natural consequence of the interfaces discussed in this article .",
    "this will be made clear at equation ( [ skewsde ] ) below .",
    "the brownian motion @xmath56 is also a markov process with ( homogeneous ) transition probabilities @xmath59 satisfying the advection - dispersion equation @xmath60 with continuous derivatives of all orders everywhere . since the displacements @xmath61 are independent for disjoint intervals @xmath62 , it follows that the variance of @xmath63 is linear in @xmath64 and , in particular , @xmath65 the definition of _ mathematical local time at @xmath66 _ , denoted @xmath67 , for @xmath56 can be expressed as @xmath68 is the amount of time @xmath56 spends in the infinitesimal neighborhood @xmath69 prior to time @xmath64 .",
