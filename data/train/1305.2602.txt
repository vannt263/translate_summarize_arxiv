    "the first challenging requirement to develop semiconductor ( sc ) spintronics@xcite _ i.e. _ using both carrier charge and spin in electronic devices consists in injecting spin polarized electrons in the conduction band of a sc at room temperature .",
    "scs should be further compatible with silicon mainstream technology for implementation in microelectronics making silicon , germanium and their alloys among the best candidates.@xcite in si , due to low spin - orbit coupling , very long spin diffusion lengths were predicted and measured experimentally.@xcite germanium exhibits the same crystal inversion symmetry as si , a low concentration of nuclear spins but higher carrier mobility and larger spin - orbit coupling which should allow in principle spin manipulation by electric fields such as the rashba field.@xcite so far in order to perform spin injection from a ferromagnetic metal ( fm ) into si or ge , one needs to overcome at least three major obstacles : _",
    "( i ) _ the conductivity mismatch which requires the use of a highly - resistive spin - conserving interface between the fm and the sc,@xcite _ ( ii ) _ the fermi level pinning at the sc surface due to the presence of a high density of interface states and the interface spin flips which are generally associated@xcite and finally _ ( iii ) _ the presence of random magnetic stray fields created by surface magnetic charges at rough interface@xcite around which the electrically injected spins are precessing and partly lost by decoherence . in this work ,",
    "we have inserted a thin mgo tunnel barrier between ge and the cofeb ferromagnetic electrode in order to : _ ( i ) _ circumvent the conductivity mismatch and _ ( ii ) _ partly alleviate fermi level pinning by strongly reducing the interface states density@xcite which leads to a modest schottky barrier height at the mgo/_n_-ge interface .",

    "this three - terminal device used in non - local geometry represents a simple and unique tool to probe spin accumulation both into interface states and in the sc channel.@xcite in particular , we could measure spin injection in the silicon and germanium conduction bands at room temperature.@xcite + the spin hall angle ( @xmath3 , ratio between the transverse spin current density and the longitudinal charge current density ) @xcite is a key material parameter to develop new kinds of devices based on the spin hall effect ( she ) .",

    "indeed , spin - pumping  @xcite in metallic tunnel junctions is expected to fall - off in the absence of any exchange field experienced from the ferromagnet ( fm ) by the delocalized carriers injected in the non - magnetic metal ( n ) . on the other hand , spin injection into a sc by electrical means , as well as by spin - pumping ,",
    "requires a tunnel barrier at the interface between both types of materials  @xcite in order to overcome the impedance mismatch issue  @xcite describing a total diffusive spin current backflow towards the fm .",
    "as shown in our experiments , spin - pumping in a semiconductor with a tunnel barrier can be recovered with some conditions .",
    "first , the carriers injected by tunneling from a fm contact have to remain localized at the interface between the tunnel barrier and the semiconductor in the timescale of a single magnetization precession .",
    "second , the effective _ tunnel exchange _ field experienced by the carriers , that we call hereafter @xmath164 , has to be large enough for the spin to rotate in a timescale of a magnetization precession .",
    "these two necessary conditions may be fulfilled within a two - step tunneling picture of spin injection into evanescent ( or localized states )  @xcite and in the limit of an effective exchange field larger than a certain lower bound .",
    "this will be demonstrated below .",
    "the third condition to observe spin - pumping in fm / tunnel barrier / sc systems is a minimum value for the conductance of the schottky barrier delimiting the two regions _",

    "a thermal activation may be needed to fulfill this third condition .",
    "we thus give an analytical expression for the source term taking into account a two - step tunneling process .",

    "the new source term describing spin - pumping in a broad band of evanescent states at the tunnel barrier / sc interface has to involve a small but however non - zero exchange interaction @xmath173 between localized states and the magnetization @xmath114 ( of unit vector @xmath174 ) of the fm through the tunnel barrier ; this exchange interaction couples evanescent wavefunctions inside the barrier . in the following",

    "this condition corresponds to a characteristic spin precession time due to exchange , and necessary for any spin rotation , smaller than the magnetization @xmath166 precession time itself .",
    "once these two conditions are satisfied , the spin - pumping effect at the fm / tunnel barrier / sc interface becomes efficient , a large rotation angle of the spin @xmath211 compensating the small number of uncompensated spins @xmath212 .",

    "we now proceed to the _ down - renormalization _ of the spin - current pumped in the sc as described previously . in the light of the",

    "consequently , the _ real _ spin current pumped into the ge layer depends on the schottky conductance and on the different spin - resistances involved in the spin - relaxation process .",
    "the main question that has to be addressed in the future is the fraction of the spin - current pumped and relaxing in the ls by spin - flip .",
    "indeed , this part of the spin - current would contribute to the broadening of the fmr spectra but not to the ishe voltage .",
    "finally these parameters have to be determined experimentally in order to relate this microscopic model to our data .",
    "we have demonstrated that at the fm / i / n interface where n is a non - magnetic semiconductor channel we could inject a spin current by spin pumping from the fm layer into the n channel at the ferromagnetic resonance .",
    "we have also shown that the mgo tunnel barrier is useful not only to overcome the conductivity mismatch between cofeb and ge but also to keep the magnetic properties of the fm after annealing the samples .",
    "there is no spin pumping nor inverse spin hall effect voltage signal on devices without barrier while it clearly appears on the devices with the mgo barrier .",
    "moreover there is an enhancement of the ishe signal and consequently of the spin hall angle when the device is annealed . a microscopic model involving interface states and _ evansecent _ tunnel exchange coupling has been developed in order to explain spin pumping into ge from a fm electrode through a tunnel barrier .",
