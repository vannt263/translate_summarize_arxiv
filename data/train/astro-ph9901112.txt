    "helioseismic inverse problems consist in using the properties ( namely frequencies or frequency splittings ) of the oscillation pattern observed at the surface of the sun in order to infer the internal variation of solar physical properties like the rotation rate , the sound speed or the density ( see e.g. gough & thompson ( @xcite ) for a review ) .",
    "these problems can be expressed in terms of integral equations which represent ill - posed problems in the sense of hadamard ( @xcite ) .",
    "the traditional approach used to override this difficulty consists in _ regularizing the problem _ by adding some a priori information on the solution ( e.g. kirsch @xcite ; craig & brown @xcite ) . the well known tikhonov regularization method ( phillips @xcite",
    "; twomey @xcite ; tikhonov @xcite ) assumes a global smoothness of the solution by minimizing the norm of its derivative at a given order .",
    "nevertheless , inversions for the solar rotation have shown ( see e.g. thompson et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) and schou et  al .",
    "( @xcite ) for the latest results ) that high gradients exist in the solar rotation profile near the surface and at the base of the convection zone in the so - called _ solar tachocline _",
    "( spiegel & zahn @xcite ) .    therefore ,",
    "enforcing global smoothness a priori may not be appropriate for the study of these zones , which are of particular interest for the study of solar dynamics . as a matter of fact , the tachocline represents a thin zone where the differential rotation of the convection zone becomes rigid in the radiative interior .",
    "it is thought to be the place where the solar dynamo originates and its precise structure is an important test for angular momentum transport theories . more precisely , the thickness of the tachocline can be related to the horizontal component of the turbulent viscosity and may be used as an important observational constraint on the dynamics properties of the turbulence ( spiegel & zahn @xcite ; gough & sekii @xcite ; elliot @xcite ) .",
    "several works have already been performed to infer the fine structure of the tachocline ( kosovichev @xcite,@xcite ; basu @xcite ; charbonneau et al .",
    "@xcite ; antia et al .",
    "@xcite ; corbard et al .",
    "@xcite ) using both forward analysis and inverse techniques .",
    "for the inverse approach , it may be interesting to change the global constraint which tends to smooth out every high gradients in the solution and to find a way to preserve these gradients in the inversion process .",
    "a first attempt in that direction has been carried out ( corbard et al .",
    "@xcite ) by using a nonlinear regularization term based on the piecewise polynomials - truncated singular value decomposition ( pp - tsvd ) method ( hansen & mosegaard @xcite ) which uses a @xmath2-norm .",
    "nevertheless it has been shown that this method can produce solutions with sharp discontinuities even if the width of the tachocline is relatively large .",
    "this leads to very large error bars on the inferred width of high gradient zones and complicates the interpretation of the results obtained from real observations .",
    "more elaborate nonlinear techniques have been developed for edge - preserving regularization in computed imaging . in this paper , we investigate their use in the helioseismic context .    section  [ sec : pb ] briefly recalls how the solar internal rotation can be related to the frequency splittings determined from helioseismic measurements , and introduces the corresponding discretized inverse problem .",

    "the internal rotation @xmath3 of the sun expressed as a function of the solar radius @xmath4 and colatitude @xmath5 can be related ( hansen et al .",
    "@xcite ) , through a 2d integral equation , to the observed frequency splittings @xmath6 where each mode of solar acoustic oscillations is characterized by the degree @xmath7 , the radial order @xmath8 and the azimuthal order @xmath9 ( @xmath10 ) .    in this work ,",
    "we focus on the application of non linear inversion to the description of the tachocline profile in the equatorial plane .",
    "the so - called ` tachocline parameters ' are obtained by fitting , between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the solution @xmath13 of the inversion by an error function ( @xmath14 ) of the form : @xmath15 this defines five tachocline parameters : @xmath16 , @xmath17 , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 .",
    "the coefficient @xmath20 has been introduced , following antia et al .",
    "( @xcite ) , in order to take into account the linear behaviour sometimes found for the rotation rate in the convection zone just above the transition in the equatorial plane ( see sect .  [",
    "sec : real_data ] ) .",
    "thus , we consider the 1d problem of inferring the solar equatorial rotation profile @xmath21 from the sum of odd - indexed @xmath22-coefficients defined by the expansion of the splittings on orthogonal polynomials ( e.g. schou et al .",

    "we seek a solution @xmath13 defined as a piecewise linear function of the radius : @xmath32 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 are piecewise straight lines ( @xmath35 in this work ) between fixed break points distributed according to the density of turning points of the modes ( cf .",

    "unfortunately , the inverse integral problem is an ill - posed problem and the minimization of only the @xmath38 value generally leads to oscillatory solutions that are not ` physically acceptable ' in the sense that they do not correspond to our a priori knowledge on the shape of the solution .",
    "so , we have to use regularization techniques i.e. to introduce a priori information in the minimization process . a large class of these techniques ,",
    "can be expressed in the general form of the minimization of a criterion @xmath41 over the unknown solution @xmath13 :    @xmath42    where @xmath43 is the so - called trade - off parameter , chosen so that it establishes a balance between the goodness - of - fit to the data and the constraint introduced on the solution .",

    "we note however that the method described below can easily be generalized for any choice of the derivative order .    two choices for the @xmath46-function lead to well known regularization strategies :    * @xmath47 leads to the traditional tikhonov approach with first derivative whereas * @xmath48 is known as the _ total variation _",

    ", this leads to a nonlinear problem which requires an appropriate iterative method of solution .",
    "now , with this general expression for the normal equations , the question for our particular problem becomes : what properties must the @xmath46-functions satisfy to ensure the preservation of high gradients in the solution ?",
    "the next section shows how the theoretical works developed in the field of computed imaging gives an answer to this question , and leads to an algorithm for solving the non linear euler equation that is easy to implement .      from the euler equation ( eqs .",
    "( [ eq : euler1 ] ) and ( [ eq : euler2 ] ) ) we can see that the function @xmath68 acts as a weighting function in the smoothing process : at each grid point the gradient of the solution is used as an argument of this function in order to set locally the magnitude of regularization .",
    "this suggests an iterative process where the gradient of the solution at a given step is used for the computation of the regularization term at the next step .",
    "we show in the following that we can derive some basic properties of the weighting function so that high gradients can be preserved , and such that an iterative algorithm for solving the euler equation is possible .",
    "first let us look at the behaviour of the weighting function at the limits of low and high gradients :    * for low gradients , we want to keep a tikhonov regularization . from eq .",
    "( [ eq : euler1 ] ) this is the case if @xmath69 is a non - null constant function . * for high gradients ,",
    "we want to remove smoothing .",
    "this happens when @xmath69 is close to zero . *",
    "another property that sounds reasonable is to choose a decreasing function of the gradient between these two limits .",
    "furthermore , in order to avoid numerical instabilities we will choose only strictly decreasing weighting functions .    therefore the choice of the @xmath46 function must be made taking into account the following three properties needed on the weighting function @xmath68 ( charbonnier et al .",
    "@xcite , @xcite ) :    1 .",
    "tikhonov smoothing for low gradients : + @xmath70 2 .",
    "no smoothing for high gradients : + @xmath71 3 .",
    "@xmath72    within these conditions , the @xmath46-function may be chosen either convex ( green @xcite ; charbonnier et al .",
    "@xcite ) or non - convex ( perona & malik @xcite ; geman & mcclure @xcite ; hebert & leahy @xcite ) ( see also charbonnier et al .",
    "( @xcite ) and teboul et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for examples in both cases ) .",
    "a non - convex function may be better suited for the search of high gradients .",
    "nevertheless this choice leads to some numerical difficulties and instabilities related to the existence of local minima .",

    ", the choice of a convex function may avoid these numerical problems and is more suitable for relatively smooth transition ( blanc - fraud @xcite ) .",
    "we note that in the case of the tv regularization ( or equivalently the pp - tsvd method ) the function @xmath48 does not satisfy the first property ( eq .  [ eq : ppty1 ] ) .",
    "this may explain the difficulties encountered in using this method ( corbard et al .",
    "@xcite ) . for smooth transitions ,",
    "the dispersion of the results for different realizations of the noise became large , indicating some instabilities in the inversion process . in light of the above formalism",
    ", this may be related to the non differentiability of the corresponding weighting function @xmath73 at @xmath74 , which can lead to numerical instabilities .      under the three conditions ( [ eq : ppty1])([eq : ppty2])([eq : ppty3 ] ) , it has been shown by charbonnier et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) that the non linear criterion can be solved by using an iterative scheme named artur ( algebraic reconstruction technique using regularization ) that is easy to implement : at each step @xmath75 we calculate the regularization term using the derivative of the previous estimate @xmath76 and we simply compute the new estimate @xmath77 by solving the linear system : @xmath78 when we use a convex @xmath46-function , the convergence of this so - called _ half quadratic algorithm _ ( minimization of a quadratic criterion at each step ( geman & reynolds @xcite ) ) to the minimum of the criterion given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : crit ] ) has been established ( charbonnier et al .",
    "this is also an adaptive regularization method which uses the information on the derivative of the solution obtained at each step in order to improve the regularization at the next step .",
    "this requires an initial guess for the solution , but we will show in the next section that a constant solution can always be used as the starting guess .",

    "@xcite ) using @xmath79 as starting point .",
    "this leads to a very fast algorithm where the number of conjugate gradient iterations needed to solve the linear system decreases at each artur step .",
    "the algorithm is stopped when the @xmath80-norm of the relative difference between two solutions at two successive steps is below @xmath81 i.e. : @xmath82",
    "in the particular case of the determination of the solar tachocline profile , the uncertainty on the width of the transition zone is still large ( see table 2 of corbard et al .",
    "( @xcite ) for a summary of some previous works ) . therefore , according to the previous discussion , we have chosen to consider a convex regularizing @xmath46-function , specifically the one defined in charbonnier et al .",
    "( @xcite , @xcite ) : @xmath83 this function is close to the absolute value function used in tv regularization and pp - tsvd method , but , unlike the absolute value , has a quadratic behaviour near @xmath84 that satisfies the requirement of eq .",

    "for example , using a generalized cross validation ( gcv ) strategy ( wahba @xcite ) for the regularizing parameter of a tikhonov model leads to an oscillating solution while using the l - curve strategy produces a smoother solution .",
    "this choice influences evidently the estimation of the width of the tachocline .",
    "it is intuitively not surprising as the model represents a priori information on the solution ( so the solution depends on this information ) .",

    "if the initial guess is a constant function , then according to property 1 ( eq .",
    "[ eq : ppty1 ] ) and eq .",
    "( [ eq : wf ] ) , @xmath88 and the solution at the first artur step corresponds to a tikhonov solution with @xmath87 as regularizing parameter .",
    "it has been shown in corbard et al .",
    "( @xcite ) that the gcv strategy for the choice of the regularizing parameter in tikhonov inversions leads systematically to better results concerning the evaluation of the tachocline parameters , as compared to the l - curve strategy ( hansen @xcite ) .",
    "in fact , the gcv strategy leads systematically to less smoothing than the l - curve approach ( @xmath89 in that work ) and therefore is more suited to the study of a region with high gradients .",
    "nevertheless , because of the low global regularization , this choice may lead to spurious oscillations below and above the tachocline ( see figs .",
    "[ fig : comp.ks1 ] , [ fig : comp.ks10 ] ) .",
    "the artur algorithm will tend to enhance the high gradients found at the first step .",
    "therefore it is important to start with a solution smooth enough to avoid spurious oscillations with high gradients .",
    "the gcv choice for @xmath87 may therefore not be well adapted for artur initial step , and some experiments have shown that , on the other hand , the l - curve choice leads often to a solution which is too smooth and does not allow the buildup of the high gradients expected during the iterations .",
    "nevertheless , the optimal choice of this parameter strongly depends on the level of noise included in the data , and therefore it is important to define an automatic choice of this parameter so that we use the same strategy for different realizations of the noise in monte - carlo simulations ( cf .",
    "[ sec : mc ] ) .",
    "the results of these simulations are shown in fig .  [",

    "the second choice has been retained for the application to real data ( cf .",
    "[ sec : real_data ] ) .",
    "the parameter @xmath44 has been introduced in order to adapt the shape of the weighting function to the gradient that we seek to detect in a particular application .",
    "we have chosen for simplicity to keep this parameter constant during the iterations .",
    "as we start the iterative process with a constant guess rotation , the first step is independent of @xmath44 and thus we can use the solution obtained after this initial step in order to adapt the parameter @xmath44 to the gradients found in the first step solution .",
    "as we have shown that the first step of artur algorithm correspond to a classic tikhonov inversion , this choice of @xmath44 can be viewed as a way to use our a priori knowledge ( as given by tikhonov inversion ) of the searched gradients .",
    "it is generally admitted that the width of the tachocline does not exceed @xmath92 solar radius , which is also the resolution typically reached near the tachocline localization ( @xmath93 ) with a tikhonov method applied to the current datasets .",
    "furthermore we have a good estimate of the difference between the rotation rate above and below the transition ( @xmath94nhz in corbard et al .",

    "figure [ fig : delta ] shows ( solid line ) the first derivative of solution obtained at the first step by inverting artificial splittings which have been computed for a discontinuous rotation law ( cf .",

    "this choice of @xmath98 looks reasonable , in the sense that it will tend to decrease the regularization especially in the transition zone .",
    "a smaller value would enhance the secondary peaks that are induced by the data noise .",
    "the maximum gradient obtained , at the first step , with the artificial dataset ( @xmath101nhz@xmath102 in fig .",

    "for the monte - carlo simulations done in order to estimate the errors ( cf .",
    "[ sec : mc ] ) the parameter @xmath44 has been fixed to @xmath98 .",
    "nevertheless , the shape of the solution derivative after the first step is a function of the dataset through the intrinsic resolution of the modeset and the level of noise .",
    "therefore , with real data the choice of @xmath44 will always be made by looking at the derivative profile after the first step .",
    "we will see however in sect .",
    "[ sec : real_data ] that other indicators can help in the choice of @xmath44 , and that according to these indicators the choice @xmath98 seems to be a good compromise for lowl data also .",
    "for nonlinear methods , we can not compute straightforwardly the formal errors at each point of the solution as we can do for linear process .",
    "the artur algorithm solves a linear system at each step , but the final result depends nonlinearly on the data since the coefficients of the matrix to be inverted at each step are functions of the data through the derivative of the previous estimate that is used as an argument of the weighting function .",
    "we focus here only on having an estimate of the uncertainty on the width @xmath19 and the location @xmath18 of the tachocline .",
    "we can not obtain directly error bars on the solution , and therefore the fit by an @xmath14 function does not give an estimate of the error on the inferred parameters .",
    "instead , a first estimate of the uncertainty on the tachocline width inferred here has been computed using a monte - carlo method applied on given rotation profiles simulated by @xmath14 functions with widths lying between @xmath103 and @xmath104 ( in steps of @xmath103 ) and located at @xmath105 .",
    "the lowl set of modes splittings corresponding to these rotation profiles have been computed with addition of a gaussian noise with a standard deviation taken for each mode from the formal error given in lowl data .",
    "since the artur algorithm is non linear , we can not define averaging kernels but fig .",
    "[ fig : mc ] shows that the final step of the algorithm with @xmath90 and @xmath98 leads directly to results similar to those reached by tikhonov inversion after a ` local deconvolution ' using the averaging kernels computed at the center of the transition ( see corbard et al .",
    "the @xmath106 error interval on the width is found to be around @xmath107 for widths in the range @xmath108 .",
    "this uncertainty is probably related to the intrinsic resolution of the modeset and the level of noise contained in lowl data .",
    "a large bias is found with deconvolved tikhonov method for @xmath109 .",
    "this bias is less important for the artur method with @xmath110 and vanishes if we set @xmath91 .",
    "nevertheless , in this latter case error bars are bigger ( around @xmath111 in the range @xmath112 of initial widths ) and the inferred widths tend to be underestimated for initials widths between @xmath113 and @xmath0 . this is due to the fact that , in mean for the simulated data , the gcv criterion leads to a too strongly oscillating solution that is not a good starting point for artur algorithm , as it tends to produce very sharp transitions in a large number of realizations for all initial widths below @xmath0 .",
    "the monte - carlo simulations have been performed for @xmath114 realizations of the input errors for each initial width and the mean value over all the realizations ( @xmath115 ) of the inferred center @xmath18 is @xmath116 .",
    "the center of the @xmath14 function seems therefore to be very well recovered by the inversion .",
    "nevertheless , we must keep in mind that the center of the tachocline is defined as the center of the @xmath14 function that gives the best fit of the solution .",
    "this may not give an appropriate view of the tachocline profile if , for example , the solution is found to lack such a symmetry in the lower and upper parts of the tachocline when inverting real data .",
    "another important point that fig .",
    "[ fig : mc ] demonstrates is the ability of the artur algorithm to recover not only rotation with a discontinuity ( as shown in the examples of fig .",
    "[ fig : comp.ks1 ] and [ fig : comp.ks10 ] ) , but also rotation with a relatively smooth transition .",
    "this property does not characterize the pp - tsvd method , and this was the reason for the difficulties encountered by corbard et al .",
    "( 1998 ) in interpreting the results obtained with this first non linear approach .",
    "even if both methods give similar results in the mean for some choices of the regularizing parameters , it sometimes happen that the two solutions differ strongly for a particular realization of the noise .",

    "[ fig : comp.ks1 ] for simulated data , the gcv choice of the regularization parameter does not lead , with lowl data , to an oscillating solution .",

    "the formal errors quoted on each @xmath22-coefficient are perhaps overestimated .",
    "furthermore our model assumes that the errors are uncorrelated , which is probably not strictly the case .",
    "therefore , with real data , the t - gcv solution may be a good starting point for the artur algorithm and we choose to take @xmath91 so that the first artur iteration leads to the t - gcv solution .",

    ", we can guess that a choice of @xmath137 will tend to enhance spurious oscillations due to the noise , whereas a choice @xmath138 will lead to a result very similar to the t - gcv solution because only few points will be affected by the local change of regularization during the artur steps . between these two limits however , it is not clear which is the best choice for @xmath44 .",
    "however , some indicators may help in the choice of @xmath44 :    * first , an important test for any global inversion is its capability of providing a good fit to the data .",
    "figure  [ fig : lowl_delta_1]c shows , as a function of @xmath44 , the normalized @xmath38 value for the modes which have their turning points between @xmath139 and @xmath12 .",
    "as expected , this value is always lower for all artur solutions than for the t - gcv solution , because we tend to regularize less .",
    "the gain in the @xmath38 value is however small because the regularization is decreased only locally in a small region .",
    "the @xmath38 value reaches a minimum for @xmath140 but , as expected from fig  [ fig : lowl_grad ] , for such low @xmath44 , the artur solution becomes very oscillating and a discontinuity ( @xmath141 ) is found near the tachocline but in fact the solution is found to be piecewise constant with many discontinuities .",
    "* there is another indicator that we can use showing that this value of @xmath140 is not appropriate , despite the good @xmath38 value reached with this parameter .",
    "one of the objectives of the artur method is to keep the same regularization as in tikhonov method in zones without high gradients .",
    "therefore one expects that the amount of change ( compared to t - gcv solution ) will be more important in the tachocline ( and possibly near the surface ) than in other zones .",
    "we denote by @xmath142 the solution at the final step of artur algorithm for a given @xmath44 , and by @xmath143 the t - gcv solution ; we then define the two quantities : @xmath144 where @xmath145 , @xmath146-i_{in}$ ] and @xmath147 , @xmath148 are the sizes of the two sets . figure  [ fig : lowl_delta_1]b is a plot of these two quantities .",
    "it shows that for @xmath44 lower than @xmath149 the artur algorithm tends to alter the solution even in regions where no high gradients are expected , but that for values above @xmath150 there is no longer any changes in these regions , as expected .    from these two criteria",
    "it seems that a choice of @xmath98 is a good compromise between minimizing the @xmath38 value for modes which have their turning points near the tachocline , and operating changes essentially in zones where high gradients are expected .",
    "this was precisely the objective of the non linear regularization approach .",

    "the estimates of the center of the tachocline and the rotation rate in the radiative interior obtained from artur algorithm are in good agreement with our previous work .",
    "the inferred value of @xmath17 and @xmath20 are such that @xmath151nhz , which correspond to the rotation rate inferred at @xmath12 and to the value of the @xmath17 parameter obtained by the fit of the t - gcv solution .",
    "the tachocline width inferred from the artur inversion ( @xmath152 ) is smaller than our previous estimate but still compatible if we take into account an error of @xmath153 as indicated by the monte - carlo simulations .",
    "the next section will give a more detailed discussion for the interpretation of this result by showing how the estimates of the width vary with the @xmath44 parameter , and during the artur iterations .",
    "figure  [ fig : lowl_delta_2 ] shows how the parameters , inferred from a fit of the final step of the artur algorithm are sensitive to the choice of @xmath44 .",
    "it shows that the relation @xmath154 is still valid for other choices of @xmath44 , and that @xmath16 and @xmath18 vary only little with @xmath44 whereas the inferred width increases rapidly for @xmath155 .",
    "it reaches @xmath156 for @xmath136 which is the limit for the choice of @xmath44 above which we think that the artur algorithm is no longer effective . for large values of @xmath44 ,",
    "the number of step in the artur process becomes very low , artur solutions tend to t - gcv solution , and thus , tachocline parameters inferred from artur solutions tend toward those inferred from t - gcv solution ( cf .",
    "[ fig : lowl_delta_2 ] ) .",
    "we have tried to fit the solutions with or without the linear part after the transition ( i.e. by searching for the best @xmath20 coefficient or by setting @xmath157 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fiterf ] ) ) .",
    "the goodness of the fit is defined by : @xmath158 where @xmath159 is the set of indices given by @xmath160 , and @xmath161 is the size of @xmath159 .",
    "we denote by @xmath162 the goodness of a fit obtained with only four parameters ( @xmath157 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : fiterf ] ) ) . in this case",
    "the denominator of eq .",
    "( [ eq : chi2fit ] ) becomes @xmath163 .",
    "the two fits are almost equivalent when applied to the t - gcv solution ( @xmath164nhz when it is searched , cf .",
    "[ fig : lowl_delta_2]b ) , but the fit that allows a linear part has been found to be better suited for describing artur solutions for all the choices of @xmath44 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : lowl_delta_1]a ) .",
    "we note however that if one chooses to fit the solutions with @xmath157 ( i.e. to describe the tachocline by a simple @xmath14 function ) , then the inferred width would be systematically increased by a value up to @xmath153 ( cf .",
    "[ fig : lowl_delta_2]d ) .    as the increase of the @xmath38 value between @xmath98 and @xmath136 is low ( cf .",
    "fig  [ fig : lowl_delta_1]a ) , and because of our previous estimate of @xmath107 for the uncertainty on the width , we can not exclude a width larger than @xmath103 .",
    "furthermore fig .",
    "[ fig : lowl_iter ] shows that the minimum value of the @xmath38 is reached after only six artur iterations , whereas the inferred width still decreases from @xmath165 down to @xmath103 .",
    "this indicates that the data themselves do not allow us to choose between widths in that range . during the iterations as well as when we vary the value of @xmath44 , it is the amount of regularization introduced in high gradients zones that is changed . in that sense , stopping artur iteration before its convergence according to the criterion eq .",
    "( [ eq : stop ] ) would be equivalent to increase the value of @xmath44 . as the needed amount of regularization",
    "is related to the level of noise contained in the data , the reliability of our result is strongly related to our knowledge of the data noise .",
    "since we have shown that the gcv criterion may reveal some discrepancies between the data noise and the simulated noise , the only way to gain more confidence on the appropriate choice of @xmath44 , and thus on the result concerning the tachocline width inferred from this kind of non linear inversions , will be to increase our knowledge of the statistical properties of the data noise and to compare with other datasets",
    ". however , even the values of the width found at the final step for @xmath136 or at the sixth iteration with @xmath98 are still below the value of @xmath166 inferred from t - gcv solution after a ` local deconvolution ' .",
    "the use of nonlinear regularization argue in favor of a very sharp tachocline and even a discontinuity can not be excluded .",
    "therefore our conclusion on the tachocline width is that it is very likely that it is less than @xmath0 .",
    "this is reinforce by the simulations ( circles in fig .",
    "[ fig : mc ] ) showing that initial widths up to @xmath0 can lead to inferred widths of @xmath103 whereas it is excluded ( within @xmath106 error bars ) for initial widths larger than @xmath0 .",
    "this work introduces in helioseismic context an approach of the inverse problem that use an adaptive regularization which is then used toward on the estimation of the width of the tachocline .",
    "we do not claim that this paper gives a definitive answer to this question .",
    "instead , this paper presents a new tool which allows to accurately reconstruct rotation profiles with possibly both smooth and abrupt variations with depth .",
    "this approach leads to a non linear problem that can be solved easily by an iterative process named artur , initially developed in the field of image processing .",
    "it is shown that this allows to recover high gradients in the solution and avoids the spurious oscillations ( known as ` gibbs phenomena ' ) that may be found when we try to recover such sharp transition zones with the usual tikhonov approach .",
    "the proposed procedure for choosing the regularizing parameters and the monte - carlo simulations represent a first step showing the feasibility and the capability of the method to retrieve both small and large tachocline widths from noisy observations .",
    "they have shown that this method , as well as the tikhonov inversion with ` local deconvolution ' is able to recover the width of @xmath14 functions with widths from to @xmath113 up to @xmath104 with the same error estimation of @xmath107 . for lower values of the width , the results are more sensitive to the choice of the regularizing parameters .",
    "however , some improvements may be brought by the studies on the optimal choice of the regularizing parameters that are underway and their future application to the rotation inverse problem .",
    "the inversion of lowl data using the artur method gives an equatorial tachocline profile which differs from our previous work .",
    "these new results favor a sharp transition ( down to a width of @xmath103 with the adapted regularization parameters ) . from our study of the inferred width as a function of the parameter @xmath44 and from our estimate of the uncertainty on this parameter",
    ", we conclude that the width of the tachocline should be less than @xmath0 .",
    "this estimate is somewhat different from our previous estimate of @xmath1 which allows relatively smooth transitions up to @xmath104 .",
    "the change in our estimate of the width is partly due to the fact that we have changed the fitting function that defined the tachocline parameters .",
    "it is shown here that adding a linear behaviour in the upper part of the @xmath14 function allows a better fit of the solution . whereas the t - gcv solution ( before any deconvolution ) can be well approximated by a simple @xmath14 function between @xmath11 and @xmath12 , the artur solution is better approximated , in the upper part of the tachocline , by a linear function with a slope around @xmath167nhz@xmath102 that goes from @xmath168nhz at @xmath132 up to @xmath169nhz at @xmath12 .",
    "it was not possible to reach this conclusion from our previous approach using the t - gcv solution because the ` local deconvolution ' used in this approach supposed explicitly that the rotation profile can be well approximated by a simple @xmath14 function ( without linear behaviour )",
    ". it will be therefore very interesting to study in future works and with other datasets the rotation profile just above the tachocline , in order to become more confident of our result .",
    "an important contribution of the non linear regularization approach is that it allows to find directly a solution with sharp transitions without fixing a priori the shape of the transitions , as necessary in forward modeling or when we deconvolve a solution obtained from linear methods . in order to describe the tachocline with only few parameters ,",
    "we can afterwards choose a shape for the fitting function that is adapted to the solution found .",
    "finally , we note that this approach to inversion with non linear regularization may find other applications in the helioseismic context , for any the problems where high gradients are expected in the solutions .",
    "we have shown that this is the case for the rotation of the surface layers , which can be studied more accurately with instruments such as mdi on board soho , or the gong network which observe high degree modes .",
    "this algorithm may also be applied to the sound speed anomaly found between the real sun and solar models by structural inversions .",
    "the width of this peak , which is located in the tachocline , can be related to the width of the mixed zone which is supposed to exist just below the convection zone ( e.g. morel et al .",
    "@xcite ) . some recent work ( elliott et al .",
    "@xcite ) have used a linear inversion which has been deconvolved to give an estimate of @xmath153 for this width .",
    "it is interesting to note that this is of the same order as our estimate of the tachocline width deduced from the rotation profile . as the sound speed anomaly profile is also a zone with high gradients in the solution of an inverse problem",
    ", the use of non linear regularization may also be an alternate approach to address this problem in future work .",
