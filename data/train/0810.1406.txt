    "in the framework of the quark model the @xmath3 meson is predominantly a flavour - singlet combination of quark - antiquark pairs , and it is expected to mix with purely gluonic states . therefore , additionally to the production mechanisms associated with meson exchange@xcite it is also possible that @xmath3 meson is produced from excited glue in the interaction region of the colliding nucleons , which couple to the @xmath3 meson directly via its gluonic component or through its su(3)-flavour - singlet admixture@xcite . as suggested in reference@xcite , the @xmath3 meson production via the colour - singlet object",
    "does not depend on the total isospin of the colliding nucleons and should lead to the same amplitudes of the production for the @xmath4 and @xmath5 reactions .",
    "+ in case of the @xmath6 meson , the ratio of the total cross sections for the reactions @xmath7 and @xmath8 was determined to be @xmath9  @xmath10  6.5@xcite , and @xmath9  @xmath11  3 at threshold@xcite , what suggest the dominance of isovector meson exchange in the @xmath6 production in nucleon - nucleon collisions .",
    "since the quark structure of @xmath6 and @xmath0 mesons is similar , in case of the dominant isovector meson exchange  by the analogy to the @xmath6 meson production  we can expect that the ratio @xmath12 should be large .",
    "if however @xmath0 meson is produced via its flavour - blind gluonium component from the colour - singlet glue excited in the interaction region the ratio should approach unity after corrections for the initial and final state interactions .",
    "the close  to  threshold excitation function for the @xmath13 reaction has already been established@xcite and the determination of the total cross section for the @xmath0 meson production in the proton - neutron interaction constitutes the aim of the work reported in this contribution .",
    "in august 2004 using the cosy11 facility@xcite we have conducted a measurement of the @xmath0 meson production in the proton - neutron collision .",
    "the experiment has been realized using a proton beam of the cooler synchrotron cosy  @xcite and a cluster jet deuteron target  @xcite .",
    "proton and neutron outgoing from the @xmath14 reaction have been registered by means of the cosy-11 facility . for the data analysis the proton from the deuteron",
    "is considered as a spectator which does not interact with the bombarding proton , but escapes untouched and hits the detector carrying the fermi momentum possessed exactly at the time of the reaction .",
    "the experiment is based on the registration of all outgoing nucleons from the @xmath15 reaction  @xcite .",
    "fast protons are measured in two drift chambers and scintillator detectors  @xcite , neutrons are registered in the neutral particle detector  @xcite , and slow spectator protons moving upwords to the beam are measured by the dedicated silicon - pad detector  @xcite .",
    "[ fig1](left ) shows energy losses in the @xmath16 layer of the spectator detector versus @xmath17 layer .",
    "slow spectator protons are stopped in the first or second layer of the detector whereas fast particles cross both detection layers .",
    "having the deposited energy and the emission angle we calculate the kinetic energy of the spectator proton and its momentum .",
    "[ fig1](right ) shows momentum distribution of protons considered as a spectator as determined at cosy-11 with a deuteron target and a proton beam with momentum of 3.35  gev / c ( points ) compared with simulations taking into account a fermi motion of nucleons inside the deuteron ( solid line ) .",
    "application of the missing mass technique allows to identify events with the creation of the meson under investigation .",
    "the total energy available for the quasi - free proton - neutron reaction can be calculated for each event from the vector of the momenta of the spectator and beam protons .",
    "the absolute momentum of neutrons is determined from the time - of - flight between the target and the neutron detector .",
    "fig.[fig2](left ) presents the time - of - flight distribution  for neutral particles  measured between the target and the neutral particle detector . a clear signal originating from the gamma rays",
    "is seen over a broad enhancement from neutrons .",
    "this histogram shows that discrimination between signals originating from neutrons and gamma quanta can be done by a cut on the time of flight . from the monte carlo simulations of the @xmath4 reaction the largest expected momentum value of the neutron is eqaul to 1.4  gev /",
    "c which corresponds to the time  of - flight value of 28.5  ns as it is indicated by an arrow in fig .",
    "[ fig2](left ) .",
    "neutrons having time  of  flight below this value originate from @xmath18 reactions and are not taken for the further analysis . +    due to the smaller efficiency and lower resolution for the registration of the quasi - free @xmath19 reaction in comparison to the measurements of the proton - proton reactions , the elaboration of the data encounters problems of low statistics .",
    "therefore , the excess energy range for @xmath20 has been divided only into four intervals of 8  mev width . for each interval",
    "we have calculated the missing mass .",
    "next , from events with negative q value the corresponding background missing mass spectrum was constructed , shifted to the kinematical limit and normalized to the experimental distribution at the very low mass values where no events from the @xmath3 are expected . detailed description of the method used for the background subtraction can be found in the dedicated article@xcite . after subtracting missing mass distributions for the negative values of q from spectra for q values larger than 0  due to the very high signal  to - background ratio  at the present stage of the data analysis , the signal from the @xmath3 meson was found to be statistically insignificant . nevertheless , having the luminosity   established from the number of the quasi - free proton - proton elastic scattering events  @xcite   and the detection efficiency of the cosy-11 system we have estimated the upper limit of the total cross section for the quasi - free @xmath21 reaction . the prelimnary result is shown in fig .
