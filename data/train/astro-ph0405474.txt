    "the polarization patterns with fundamental ( charge @xmath13 ) singularities are shown in fig .",

    "the properties of the polarization under rotations imply that : @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the radiation intensity and @xmath18 is the polarization angle .",
    "the @xmath13 singularities are locations around which @xmath18 changes by @xmath19 . therefore , given a polarization map ,",
    "we can find the change in @xmath18 as we go around a small closed path and this will tell us whether there is a singularity within that closed path . by going around all possible paths",
    ", we can find all the polarization singularities . in the continuum",
    ", there would be an infinite number of small paths .",
    "but in practice , the map is pixelized and the change in @xmath18 is found around circuits defined by neighboring pixels .",
    "the algorithm for finding the singularities in a pixelated map is well - known and is described in the appendix .    in this paper",
    "we will be concerned with the distribution of polarization singularities .",
    "we will characterize the distribution in three distinct ways .",
    "the first method is to find the total charge @xmath1 within a closed path of length @xmath2 .",
    "the mean charge will , of course , be zero because one can have positive and negative charges with equal probability .",
    "next , we compute the distribution of the distance to the nearest neighbor of a singularity . finally , motivated by the analyses of the galaxy distribution on the sky , we compute the angular two - point correlation function of singularities in the polarization map .",
    "this work complements the pioneering theoretical discussions in refs .",
    "@xcite and helps establish the distribution of singularities in the cmb polarization as a significant probe of the universe .    in the next section , we describe how we create the mock polarization maps . in sec .",
    "[ sec : stat ] we find the critical exponents and the angular correlation function , as well as the distribution of distance to the nearest neighbor for a vanilla mock map .",
    "we investigate the effects of non - random phases and non - gaussianity in sec .",
    "[ sec : departures ] and summarize our results in sec .",
    "[ sec : conclusions ] . in the appendix",
    "we describe the algorithm for determining the presence of a singularity .",
    "to produce mock polarization maps , we proceed as follows .",
    "we first produce the angular power spectra ( temperature and polarization ) of the cmb using the cmbfast package @xcite .",
    "our fiducial model is the standard @xmath20cdm cosmology with a flat universe with matter energy density relative to critical @xmath21 , dark energy equation of state @xmath22 , scalar spectral index @xmath23 , physical matter and baryon energy densities of @xmath24 and @xmath25 respectively , and no tensor modes ( we explore the variations to this model in sec .  [",
    "sec : departures ] ) . we can obtain an arbitrary number of statistically independent maps by generating different sets of coefficients @xmath26 and @xmath27 , consistent with the same underlying power spectra @xmath28 and @xmath29 respectively , and generating the polarization map in healpix @xcite for each set separately . recall that the coefficients @xmath30 fully describe a given map and , for a gaussian random map , come from a gaussian distribution of variance @xmath31 . in some cases we will want to produce polarization maps that do _",
    "not _ come from gaussian random @xmath32 , and in those cases we simply input the desired non - gaussian @xmath30 directly .",
    "we first compute the total number of singularities ( or charges ) @xmath33 , positive plus negative , in a given mock map .",
    "as expected , the number of charges increases with the map resolution , just as , for example , the number of temperature hot and cold spots increases with resolution .",
    "@xmath34 increases roughly as the square of the maximum resolution of the map @xmath35 so that , for example , a map ( consistent with our fiducial @xmath20cdm model ) with @xmath36 has about 6000 singularities , while a map with @xmath37 has about 150,000 singularities .",
    "note that , even if we are able to measure the polarization with infinite resolution , @xmath34 does not increase indefinitely , but levels off when the power in polarization becomes negligible . for a standard @xmath20cdm model ,",
    "the ee power spectrum has power all the way to @xmath38 .",
    "however , this implies that the total number of singularities is likely to be larger than a million , making the analysis of such a map challenging .",
    "fortunately , we do not need to worry about this issue , or wait for polarization experiments that will reach scales this small , such as planck , in order to explore the distribution of singularities : the tests we propose can be performed for polarization maps covering any range of angular scales , and statistics from the measured map of any given resolution can be compared to monte carlo tests with mock maps of the same resolution .",
    "we would now like to quantify how the _ variance _ in the number of singularities increases with the area covered on any given map .",
    "the root - mean - square ( rms ) fluctuation of the charge within a closed path of length @xmath2 is expected to be : @xmath39 where @xmath40 is the total ( positive plus negative ) charge within @xmath2 , @xmath41 is its mean among the different paths of the same length , @xmath42 is a system - dependent constant and the critical exponent @xmath0 is expected to be 0.5 @xcite . using our numerical analysis of mock data",
    "we will be able to predict both @xmath42 and @xmath0 together with error bars .",
    "to compute the rms of charge per ring , we create a polarization map , and pick a point on it that we call the north pole . in the healpix representation of the map ,",
    "each ring of angle @xmath43 from the north pole has length @xmath44 , and we find @xmath40 for all rings using the procedure described in the appendix .",
    "we then rotate the north pole of the map in a random direction ( i.e. assign it to a new , randomly chosen point on the sphere ) and repeat the computation of @xmath40 for each ring .",
    "we repeat this procedure hundred times in order to obtain sufficient statistics and compute @xmath45 .",
    "the mean charge per ring , averaged over all rotations , is nearly zero , while the fluctuations around the mean is what we are interested in .",
    "figure [ fig : critexp ] ( top panel ) shows the scaling of @xmath45 with @xmath2 for maps of two resolutions @xmath36 and @xmath46 , corresponding to polarization having power down to scales of @xmath47 and @xmath48 respectively . in both cases",
    "we have fixed the pixelization of the map to the healpix parameter nside@xmath49 , corresponding to pixels of about @xmath50 on a side . in these and",
    "many other cases we have explored , the rms of charge scales as @xmath51 where the critical exponent @xmath0 is nearly 0.5 , in agreement with expectations .",
    "furthermore , the exponent is independent of the map pixelization nside . ] .",
    "however , we find that the exponent slightly decreases with map resolution , moving from @xmath52 for @xmath36 to @xmath53 for @xmath37 ; see the bottom panel of fig .  [",
    "fig : critexp ] . in all cases",
    "the error in the exponent is about @xmath54 .",
    "another statistic that we explore is the distance to the nearest neighbor from any given singularity .",
    "the histogram of the distances to the nearest neighbor is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : nn ] , where for computational convenience we have assumed a map with @xmath36 which has a total of about @xmath55 singularities .",
    "the average distance to the nearest neighbor is slightly above @xmath56 and can be roughly predicted from the total number of singularities ( @xmath57 singularities in @xmath58 degrees on the sky ) .",
    "however , the histograms of the nearest neighbor of the same charge and that of the opposite charge are different , and show that opposite charges attract and similar charges repel .",
    "for example , the mean distance to the nearest neighbor of the same charge is @xmath59 , while distance to the neighbor of the opposite charge is @xmath60 .",
    "the third characterization of the singularity distribution we suggest and explore is the two point angular correlation function @xmath61 .",
    "the angular two point function is simply the excess probability , on top of expectation due to random distribution , of finding one singularity at an angular location @xmath62 and another one at location @xmath63    @xmath64    where @xmath65 and the second line assumes statistical isotropy .",
    "in addition to the angular correlation function for all singularities , we can find individual @xmath61 for singularities of positive ( or negative ) charge in a similar way .",
    "the angular correlation function is one of the standard tools to describe the angular clustering of galaxies , and has been thoroughly explored and used during the past three decades .",
    "computing @xmath61 for the galaxy distribution , however , typically involves various practical problems , most important of which is the `` selection function '' of the survey , having to do with magnitude cuts and imperfect coverage across the field of view .",
    "the application we are considering here is vastly simpler , since the singularities are discrete , well - defined and easily computable features , and unlike the galaxies they are located at the same radial distance .",
    "furthermore , we are simulating the polarization pattern on full skies and do not need to worry about edge - effects due to incomplete sky coverage .",
    "therefore , a simple estimator for @xmath61 will suffice .",
    "we adopt the peebles - hauser @xcite estimator @xmath66 where @xmath67 is the number of singularity pairs separated by a distance larger than @xmath68 but smaller than @xmath69 , @xmath70 is the number of pairs from a random ( poisson - distributed ) map being in the same distance interval , and @xmath71 and @xmath72 are the total numbers of singularities in the two maps .",
    "in other words , the angular correlation function measures the excess clustering over that predicted by random distribution on any given scale .",
    "here we use @xmath73 , which is larger than our pixelization scale and thus avoids any edge - effects due to pixelization .",
    "we have tried several other values of @xmath74 and obtained consistent results .",
    "figure [ fig : wtheta ] shows the angular two - point correlation function for the map with @xmath36 . in each case",
    "we compute @xmath61 for 10 statistically independent maps , and plot the mean and standard deviation of measurements at all angular scales .",
    "note that this procedure correctly accounts for the increase in the error bars at large angular separations due to sample ( or cosmic ) variance .",
    "we find that @xmath61 is remarkably consistent with zero at all angular scales greater than about @xmath4 !",
    "this implies that the singularities are poisson distributed over most angular scales .",
    "also note that the singularity - singularity @xmath61 is negative at scales @xmath75 , while the singularity - antisingularity @xmath61 is positive over the same range .",
    "this illustrates the fact we discussed in sec .  [ sec : nn ] , that charges of the same sign repel and those of opposite sign attract .",
    "finally , @xmath61 for all singularities ( irrespective of their charge ) shows an overall decrease at @xmath76 .",
    "we have repeated this analysis by varying the maximum resolution of the map @xmath35 and found consistent results : the behavior of @xmath61 is qualitatively similar , while the error bars decrease with increasing @xmath35 due to the increase in the number of singularities .",
    "it is important to determine how the singularity distribution depends on the physical input such as the primordial fluctuation spectrum , the cosmological parameters , or gaussianity of cosmological seed perturbations . in particular , previous work @xcite emphasized that the distribution and type of singularities may be a promising way of probing the gaussianity of initial conditions .",
    "with this in mind we have created mock maps of the cmb polarization using several different cosmological models and characterized the singularity distribution in each . in particular , we have tried several extreme possibilities , some of which are already ruled out by cosmological observations :    * maps based on primordial power spectrum with very significant tensor modes ( the ratio of tensor to scalar perturbations at the cmb temperature quadrupole of @xmath77 ) . * maps with a strongly tilted primordial power spectrum with either less or more power on small scales",
    ": we alternatively assumed a scalar spectral index @xmath78 or @xmath79 . * maps that are strongly non - gaussian : we assumed the real and imaginary parts of the coefficients @xmath80 to be sampled from an exponential distribution while keeping zero mean and variance equal to @xmath81 . in other words , we have adopted a highly skewed distribution of the coefficients @xmath80 .",
    "remarkably we find that all statistics we considered are largely unaffected .",
    "the critical exponent is unchanged within the errors , and so is its dependence on @xmath35 .",
    "the two point correlation function @xmath61 is also unchanged , being consistent with zero except on scales less than @xmath4 .",
    "the total number of singularities does change for the alternative cosmological models , which is to be expected since the total power in the map is affected each time .",
    "however , statistics of the distribution of singularities are unchanged .",
    "in particular , we find it very interesting that the results are insensitive to the model for non - gaussianity we assumed .",
    "we have explored this further for several other classes of variations to the standard gaussian / isotropic assumption , and found deviations from the results described in sec .",
    "[ sec : stat ] _ only _ in cases where the statistics of the map were modified enough that the statistical isotropy was grossly violated .",
    "for example , maps where the only nonzero @xmath80 coefficients were those with @xmath82 showed deviation from results in sec .",
    "[ sec : stat ] ; however , inspection of polarization maps in these cases indicate that such modifications lead to huge violations of isotropy in the map that are easily detectable with almost any reasonable statistical test .",
    "conversely , more subtle modifications of the power spectra ( for example , setting the quadrupole of temperature and polarization to zero ) produced the same results as our fiducial model",
    ". therefore the characteristics of the singularity distribution seem to be robust features that are insensitive to the cosmological inputs at the last scattering surface .",
    "the robustness of the singularity distribution holds advantages as well as disadvantages .",
    "one disadvantage is that by examining the distribution of the singularities in the actual data , it is unlikely that we will uncover something about the physics of the primordial fluctuations ( unless statistical isotropy is violated ) .",
    "the advantage is that since the distribution is robust , any distortions in it must come during propagation of the photons from the last scattering surface to us .",
    "hence the distribution can be used as a probe of cosmology at redshifts smaller than @xmath83 .",
    "for example , weak gravitational lensing could distort the poissonian nature of the angular correlation functions ; however , this effect will operate only at small angular scales , as lensing distortions are typically a few arcminutes .",
    "we have explored the statistics of the distribution of singularities in the cmb polarization maps .",
    "the existence of singularities are a generic prediction for a headless vector field on a sphere .",
    "their distribution , however , has not been explored in the past except for some generic scaling arguments .",
    "here we have provided a quantitative analysis of the distribution of singularities with positive and negative charge , and argued that the singularities provide an additional probe of the conditions at last scattering , largely independent of the usual two - point correlation functions of temperature .",
    "we found that the singularities are distributed randomly at scales @xmath84 .",
    "the angular two - point correlation function of singularities vanishes at those scales , while the total charge within a closed path of length @xmath2 scales as @xmath51 with @xmath85 . on scales",
    "@xmath75 , however , charges of the same sign repel while those of opposite charge attract .",
    "the attraction and repulsion are manifested both in the angular two - point correlation function and in the distribution of the nearest - neighbor distance .",
    "perhaps surprisingly , we found that the aforementioned results are very robust with respect to variations in the underlying cosmological model assumed to create the mock maps .",
    "changes in the tensor to scalar ratio , scalar spectral index , and non - gaussian distributions of the @xmath86 s all leave the singularity distribution unchanged",
    ". only violations of statistical isotropy affected the distribution of singularities .",
    "it is still possible that there are some other forms of non - gaussianity that can affect the singularity distribution that we have not explored .",
    "while this is impossible to rule out , it seems more likely to us that the distribution of singularities at the last scattering surface is described precisely by the poissonian distribution and other characteristics we have found .",
    "this implies that any observed deviations of the actual map from these distributions will have to be due to line of sight effects .",
    "most importantly , gravitational lensing of the cmb by the large - scale structure can cause changes in the singularity distribution",
    ". however , the lensing operates mostly on small scales , with typical deflections of a few arcminutes and coherence of @xmath87 .",
    "therefore , lensing may affect the statistics of the singularity distribution only at small scales .",
    "we hope to explore this signature in future work .",
    "we thank craig copi for discussions .",
    "this work was supported by the u.s .",
    "department of energy .",
    "we have benefited from using the publicly available cmbfast @xcite and healpix @xcite packages .",
    "here we will describe how the winding of polarization around a contour @xmath88 , _ i.e. _ net topological charge within @xmath88 , is calculated .",
    "the polarization map specifies @xmath89 and @xmath90 , where @xmath43 and @xmath91 are galactic latitude and longitude . from @xmath14 and @xmath15",
    "we can determine the polarization angle @xmath18 : @xmath92 now we want to know the change in @xmath18 as we go around the closed contour @xmath88",
    ".    any map of the cmb polarization will be pixelized .",
    "hence only an average value of @xmath18 within each pixel will be available to us .",
    "then the change in @xmath18 in going from pixel @xmath93 to a neighboring pixel @xmath94 is given by : @xmath95 where @xmath96 is defined as follows : @xmath97 @xmath98 @xmath99 in other words @xmath100 is the shortest path from @xmath101 to @xmath102 around the circle defined by @xmath103 $ ] ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : winding ] ) .",
    "note that @xmath104 yields the same @xmath14 and @xmath15 as @xmath105 and hence these two points are identified .",
    "this scheme to find the windings has one small modification since the sky is @xmath6 . in this case , since the polarization angle @xmath18 is defined with respect to the lines of latitude and this definition breaks down at the north and south poles , we need to modify the scheme for any contour that contains the north ( or the south ) pole . in that case , 1 must be added ( per enclosed pole ) to the net topological charge within the contour .",
    "this also ensures that the total topological charge on the sky is @xmath109 @xcite .",
