    "since the pioneer works of davydov and co - workers @xcite , soliton mechanisms for bioenergy transport in proteins have received increasing attention during the last twenty five years @xcite .",
    "the main idea is that the energy released by the hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate ( atp ) can be stored in the c = o vibration ( amide - i ) of a peptide group .",
    "the dipole - dipole coupling between peptide groups leads to the delocalization of these vibrations and to the formation of vibrational excitons , i.e. vibrons .",
    "therefore , the strong interaction between the vibrons and the phonons of the protein yields a nonlinear dynamics which favors the occurrence of the so called davydov s soliton .",
    "however , it has been pointed out that the solution of the davydov s problem is rather a small vibron - polaron than a vibron - soliton @xcite .",
    "indeed , the vibron bandwidth in proteins is smaller than the phonon cutoff frequency so that the non - adiabatic limit is reached . during its propagation , a vibron is dressed by a virtual cloud of phonons which yields a lattice distortion essentially located on a single site and which follows instantaneously the vibron ( small polaron ) .",
    "nevertheless , the dressing effect leads to an attractive interaction between vibrons mediated by virtual phonons .",
    "such an interaction is responsible for the formation of bound states and it has been suggested that proteins can support solitons formed by bound states involving a large number of vibrational quanta @xcite .",
    "although this formalism gives a comprehensive schema for the formation of solitons in proteins , it assumes the harmonic approximation for the amide - i vibration .",
    "however , this approximation failed when several vibrons are excited because the intramolecular anharmonicity acts as an additional nonlinear source . as the dressing effect , the anharmonicity is responsible for the formation of bound states @xcite and the fundamental question of the interplay between both sources of nonlinearity has been addressed in a recent paper @xcite . in this work ,",
    "we have restricted our attention to the formation of two - vibron bound states ( tvbs s ) , only .",
    "indeed , although the influence of the anharmonicity in molecular lattices have been the subject of intense research during the last decade , this research was essentially restricted to classical lattices ( for a recent review see for instance refs .",
    "@xcite ) . in particular",
    ", the formation of discrete breathers , i.e. highly localized nonlinear vibrations , has been demonstrated .",
    "however , in spite of the great interest that these classical nonlinear objects have attracted , no clear evidence has been found for their existence in real lattices .",
    "by contrast , tvbs are have been observed in several low - dimensional molecular lattices @xcite .",
    "these quantum objects correspond to the first quantum states which experience the nonlinearity and can thus be viewed as the quantum counterpart of breathers or soliton excitations @xcite .",
    "their characterization is thus essential and appears as a first step to understand the formation of multi - vibron solitons .    in ref.@xcite",
    ", we have shown that the anharmonicity modifies the vibron - phonon interaction which results in an enhancement of the dressing effect .",
    "anharmonic vibrons are thus more sensitive to the dressing than harmonic vibrons .",
    "moreover , both nonlinear sources favor the occurrence of two kinds of bound states which the properties strongly depend on the anharmonicity . in the harmonic situation ,",
    "the two bound states appear as combinations of states involving the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide - i mode and onto nearest neighbor amide - i modes .",
    "by contrast , the intramolecular anharmonicity reduces the hybridization between these two kinds of trapping so that the low frequency bound state refers to the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide - i mode whereas the high frequency bound state characterizes the trapping onto nearest neighbor amide - i vibrations .    in this study ,",
    "the dynamical coupling between the dressed anharmonic vibrons and the remaining phonons was disregarded .",
    "therefore , the present paper is devoted to the characterization of this coupling and to a detailed analysis of the relaxation pathways .",
    "the tvbs lifetime is determined with a special emphasis on the influence of the different nonlinear sources .    at biological temperature , the lifetime of the davydov s soliton is still an open question .",
    "it has been shown that the amide - i excitation , in vivo , corresponds to a localized state @xcite . instead of traveling in a coherent manner",
    ", it follows a stochastic , diffusional path along the lattice .",
    "in other words , the single - vibron davydov soliton does not last long enough to be useful at biological temperatures and it has been shown that two - vibron solitons are more stable and appear as good candidates for bioenergy transport @xcite . however , recent calculations performed by ivic et al .",
    "@xcite clearly show that the multi - vibron soliton lifetime is of about a few picoseconds , i.e. the same order of magnitude as the single - vibron soliton lifetime found by cottingham and schweitzer @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in sec .",
    "ii , the dressed anharmonic vibron point of view described in details in ref .",
    "@xcite is first summarized .",
    "then , the coupling hamiltonian between these anharmonic polarons and the remaining phonons is determined .",
    "the tvbs relaxation rate is expressed in sec .",
    "iii and studied numerically in sec .",
    "the results are finally discussed in sec .",
    "according to the original davydov s model , the collective dynamics of the amide - i vibrations is described by a one - dimensional lattice with @xmath1 sites containing the c = o vibrations .",
    "the @xmath2th amide - i mode is assumed to behave as a high frequency anharmonic oscillator described by the standard operators @xmath3 and @xmath4 .",
    "this oscillator is characterized by its harmonic frequency @xmath5 and by the cubic and quartic anharmonic parameters @xmath6 and @xmath7 , respectively .",
    "finally , the dipole - dipole coupling between nearest neighbor amide - i modes is described by the constant @xmath8 .",

    "moreover , the rate for the relaxation into the tvbs - i increases with @xmath19 whereas the rate for the relaxation into tvfs slightly decreases . for strong @xmath19 , the decay into tvbs - i represents 64 @xmath109 of the relaxation whereas the decay into tvfs corresponds to 33 @xmath109 .",
    "note that although the rate for the decay into the @xmath55 eigenstates sligtly increases around the transition , it decreases as @xmath19 increases and can be neglected for a strong nonlinearity .",
    "finally , the relaxation rate of the @xmath131 eigenstate versus the anharmonicity is shown in fig . 6 for t=310 k and for @xmath130 @xmath101 .",
    "as in fig . 5 , the different rates exhibit two regimes depending on the anharmonicity .",
    "for a small anharmonicity , i.e. @xmath137 @xmath101 , the global rate is almost independent on the anharmonic parameter and it is equal to 17.00 @xmath101 . in addition , the decay into the tvfs continuum appears as the main mechanism for the relaxation . in a marked contrast , for a strong anharmonicity , i.e. @xmath138 @xmath101 , the rate increases as the anharmonic parameter increases and reaches 23.19 @xmath101 when @xmath118 @xmath101 .",
    "the rate for the relaxation over the tvfs continuum decreases whereas the rate for the decay into the tvbs - i increases .",
    "this latter rate becomes the most important when @xmath118 @xmath101 so that the decay into tvbs - i represents almost 50 @xmath109 of the relaxation .",
    "to discuss and interpret the previous numerical results , let us first consider the behavior of the tvbs relaxation rate at low temperature .",
    "since the zero wave vector tvbs - i lies at the bottom of the two - vibron energy spectrum , its decay involves phonon absorption , only .",
    "the tvbs - i relaxation rate is thus proportional to the bose - einstein distribution which selects the frequency range of the phonons which are exchanged . in that context ,",
    "transitions involving low frequency phonons takes place at low temperature .",
    "therefore , when the thermal energy @xmath139 is lower than the energy gap between bound and free states , the tvbs - i can just decays into the other tvbs - i , as shown in fig .",
    "1 . note that phonon emission participates in the decay of the other two - vibron states so that the corresponding rate reaches a finite value at zero temperature ( not considered in the numerical analysis ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the low temperature behavior of the rate does not depend on the system nonlinearity and essentially originates in the shape of the phonon distribution .",
    "this is no longer the case at biological temperature for which an approximate expression of the relaxation rate can be determined . to proceed , we assume that the two - vibron bandwidth is smaller when compared with both the thermal energy @xmath139 and the phonon cutoff energy @xmath140 . therefore , the bose - einstein distribution can be linearized according to the temperature and the distribution function f(@xmath87 ) ( eq.([eq : f ] ) ) can be written as @xmath141 . as a result",
    ", the relaxation rate eq.([eq : rate3 ] ) connected to the two - vibron eigenstate @xmath97 can be approximated as @xmath142 at this step , eq.([eq : wapprox ] ) can be simplified because the sum over @xmath143 leads to the occurrence of the closure relation .",
    "therefore , by using the following identity @xmath144 the relaxation rate is finally expressed as @xmath145 eq.([eq : wapprox1 ] ) yields a rather good approximation which allows us to interpret and to understand the numerical results .",
    "first of all , it accounts for the observed temperature dependence of the relaxation rate .",
    "indeed , eq.([eq : wapprox1 ] ) clearly shows that the rate increases in a linear way as the temperature increases , in a perfect agreement with the numerical results displayed in figs .",
    "this feature originates in the linearization of the bose - einstein distribution . note that the wave function @xmath146 depends on the temperature in a complicated manner through the dressing effect @xcite",
    "however , our results indicate that such a dependence remains rather small when compared with the influence of the bose - einstein factor .",
    "then , the wave function dependence of the relaxation rate allows us to understand the influence of the intramolecular anharmonicity as shown in figs . 2 and 6 .",
    "for tvbs - i , figs .",
    "2 clearly show that the rate decreases as the anharmonicity increases .",
    "in fact , since tvbs - i refer to the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide - i vibration , the wave function @xmath147 is maximum for @xmath148 and decreases with @xmath48 according to a quasi - exponential way @xcite . as a consequence , when the anharmonicity increases , the trapping process is enhanced so that the extension of the wave function around @xmath148 is reduced .",
    "therefore , @xmath149 increases whereas @xmath150 , as the relaxation rate , decreases . in fig .",
    "6 , the anharmonicity dependence of the rate for the @xmath151 eigenstate exhibits two regimes which originates in the nature of the state itself . indeed , as pointed out in sec .",
    "b. , @xmath151 refers either to a free or to a bound state ( tvbs - ii ) , depending on the nonlinearity .",
    "such a behavior is displayed in fig .",
    "6 since the change of regime corresponds to the transition from a tvfs to a tvbs - ii . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , @xmath151 corresponds to a tvfs for a small anharmonicity . in that case , the probability @xmath152 is almost independent on the anharmonicity and scales as @xmath153 .",
    "consequently , the relaxation rate does not depend on @xmath21 , as shown in fig .",
    "by contrast , as when increasing the anharmonicity , the state @xmath151 becomes bounded .",
    "it refers to a tvbs - ii which characterizes the trapping of the two vibrons onto two nearest neighbor amide - i vibrations .",
    "therefore , when the anharmonicity increases , the trapping process is enhanced so that the wave function @xmath154 tends to localize around @xmath155 .",
    "the corresponding rate suddenly increases with @xmath21 as clearly shown in fig .",
    "finally , the approximated expression of the rate gives a comprehensive explanation of the influence of the small polaron binding energy ( see figs .",
    "3 and 5 ) . indeed",
    ", eq.([eq : wapprox1 ] ) clearly shows that the dependence of the rate with respect to @xmath19 is twofold .",
    "first , the rate depends linearly on @xmath19 .",
    "this feature originates in the fact that the rate is proportional to the intensity of the coupling between the dressed anharmonic vibrons and the remaining phonons ( see eq.([eq : rate1 ] ) ) .",
    "then , the @xmath19 dependence is included in the wave function dependence of the rate .",
    "as when increasing the small polaron binding energy , the trapping process involved in the formation of the tvbs - i is enhanced so that @xmath156 decreases .",
    "therefore , the linear evolution of the tvbs - i relaxation rate with respect to @xmath19 is slightly damped , i.e. the rate evolves more slowly than the corresponding linear law ( see fig .",
    "3 ) . as previously , fig . 5 clearly shows that the nature of the state @xmath151 exhibits a transition as a function of the small polaron binding energy . for small @xmath19 values ,",
    "this state is a tvfs which the wave function does not significantly depend on the nonlinearity .",
    "therefore , the rate evolves in a linearly way versus @xmath19 .",
    "by contrast , when the small polaron binding energy is sufficiently important , this state becomes a tvbs - ii @xcite .",
    "as a consequence , the trapping onto two nearest neighbor sites is enhanced so that @xmath157 increases to reach unity .",
    "the corresponding relaxation rate suddenly evolves more rapidly than the previous linear law ( see fig . 5 ) .    as shown in eq.([eq : wapprox1 ] ) , the dependence of the relaxation rate on the nature of the corresponding two - vibron state arises from the factor @xmath158 . as a consequence ,",
    "the global rate does not depend significantly on the fact that the state is a tvfs or a tvbs .",
    "in other words , the lifetime of both kinds of states is about the same order of magnitude .",
    "indeed , @xmath159 refers to the probability to find the two vibrons onto two nearest neighbor sites . in a tvfs",
    ", this probability scales as @xmath153 and vanishes asymptotically as @xmath1 tends to infinity . for a tvbs ,",
    "such a probability depends on the nature of the bound between the two vibrons and ranges between @xmath99 and @xmath160 . for instance , for a strong nonlinearity , i.e. for strong values of both @xmath21 and @xmath19 , tvbs - i refer to the trapping of the two vibrons onto the same amide - i vibration whereas tvbs - ii characterize the trapping onto two nearest neighbor sites .",
    "therefore , @xmath159 vanishes for tvbs - i whereas it is equal to unity for tvbs - ii . in that context , if we define @xmath161 , the relaxation rates are expressed as @xmath162 and @xmath163 .    in a marked contrast , the nature of the relaxation channels drastically depends on the characteristic of the two - vibron states involved in the process .",
    "such effects originate in the coupling between the two - vibron eigenstates mediated by the vibron - phonon interaction and characterized by the constant @xmath89 ( see eqs.([eq : z])-([eq : z1 ] ) ) . as shown in the definition of the coupling hamiltonian @xmath56 ( eq.([eq : dh ] ) ) , this interaction characterizes transitions between two - vibron states in the course of which a single vibron is transfered from a given site to its nearest neighbor .    to understand this feature ,",
    "let us first consider the relaxation channels connected to the decay of the tvbs - i . within the strong nonlinear limit , the tvbs - i wave function is essentially localized around @xmath148 so that @xmath147 is almost equal to @xmath164 .",
    "therefore , it is straightforward to show that the coupling constant can be approximated as @xmath165 .",
    "the corresponding relaxation rate is thus written as @xmath166 the relaxation channel for the tvbs - i corresponds to the decay into states which favor the trapping of the two vibrons onto two nearest neighbor amide - i vibrations , i.e. states for which @xmath167 is maximum . within the strong nonlinear limit",
    ", such states refer to the tvbs - ii . as a consequence , in a perfect agreement with the numerical results displayed in figs .",
    "1a , 2c , 3 and 4b , eq.([eq : wtvbsi ] ) clearly shows that the decay into tvbs - ii is the main mechanism for the tvbs - i relaxation .",
    "note that both @xmath168 and @xmath169 are almost @xmath46 independent so that the rate for the decay over all the tvbs - ii states is equal to @xmath170 .",
    "however , when the nonlinearity slightly decreases , i.e. when either ( or both ) @xmath21 and @xmath19 decreases , the tvbs - i wave function delocalizes so that @xmath171 decreases and , in the same time , @xmath156 increases . as a result , the coupling between a given tvbs - i and the other tvbs - i is turned on which opens the corresponding relaxation channel . in the same way",
    ", the tvbs - ii wave function extends itself around @xmath155 leading to the decrease of @xmath157 . as a consequence , the coupling between tvbs - i and tvbs - ii decreases , as observed in the numerical results .    within the strong nonlinear limit",
    ", the tvbs - ii wave function is essentially localized around @xmath155 so that @xmath154 is almost equal to @xmath172 . therefore , by following the same procedure as in the previous paragraph , it is straightforward to show that the coupling constant is @xmath173 .",
    "this expression indicates that tvbs - ii decay into both tvbs - i and tvfs , but can not relax over the other tvbs - ii . as a result ,",
    "the rate for the decay of a given tvbs - ii into a particular tvbs - i is approximately given by @xmath174 at this step , by performing the sum over the wave vector @xmath175 in eq.([eq : wtvbsii ] ) , the rate for the decay over all the tvbs - i is equal to @xmath170 .",
    "since the global relaxation rate for the tvbs - ii is equal to @xmath176 , the rate for the relaxation over the tvfs continuum is equal to @xmath177 .",
    "these results are in a rather good agreement with the numerical results shown in fig .",
    "however , when the nonlinearity slightly decreases , both the tvbs - i and tvbs - ii wave functions delocalize so that @xmath157 and @xmath171 decrease . in that context , the relaxation rate for the decay of tvbs - ii into tvbs - i decreases , as shown in figs . 5 and 6 , whereas the rate for the relaxation over tvfs increases . in the same way ,",
    "the relaxation channel connected to the decay into the other tvbs - ii opens because the wave function @xmath154 does not vanish any more for @xmath148 or @xmath178 .    at this step ,",
    "let us mention that the previous results address the fundamental question of the manifestation of the quantum localization , i.e. of the existence of quantum breathers .",
    "indeed , classical breathers describe time periodic and spatially localized nonlinear vibrations . by contrast , due to the translational invariance , the center of mass of the two vibrons in a tvbs is fully delocalized according to a bloch wave .",
    "however , the localized nature of a tvbs arises due to the trapping of the two quanta around few sites . in that context , although a tvbs does not describe a spatially localized field , its degree of localization manifests itself through particular correlation functions @xcite .",
    "our results clearly establish that such correlation functions are involved in the calculation of the relaxation rate ( see for instance eq . ( [ eq : corr ] ) ) . as a consequence",
    ", the dependence of the relaxation channels versus the nature of the two - vibron states can be viewed as a manifestation of the quantum localization of tvbs .    to conclude ,",
    "let us note that the knowledge of the relaxation rates allow us to characterize the population dynamics of the two - vibron eigenstates in real time . to illustrate this feature ,",
    "let us consider the strong nonlinear limit in which the relaxation schema is rather simple .",
    "indeed , the rates are almost wave vector independent so that the system can be modeled as a three levels system formed by the tvbs - i band , the tvbs - ii band and the tvfs band ( see fig .",
    "the first relaxation channel corresponds to the decay of the tvbs - i band into the tvbs - ii band according to the rate @xmath170 .",
    "the relaxation of the tvbs - ii band exhibits two main channels connected to the decay into the tvbs - i band with the rate @xmath170 and to the decay into the tvfs band with the rate @xmath177 .",
    "finally , tvfs are allowed to relax into the other tvfs , only .",
    "let @xmath179 , @xmath180 and @xmath181 denote the populations of these bands .",
    "therefore , the time evolution of these populations is governed by a master equation expressed as @xmath182 the system eq.([eq : master ] ) , which can be solved straightforwardly , allows us to follow the relaxation pathways in real time . for instance , if we assume that the system is initially set in the tvbs - i band , eq.([eq : master ] ) clearly shows that the population @xmath183 decays so that the population of the tvbs - ii band increases .",
    "however , as @xmath184 increases with time , it tends to relax into the tvfs continuum .",
    "therefore , we observe the relaxation of the tvbs - i band into the tvfs continuum through the tvbs - ii band . after a time @xmath185 , both @xmath179 and @xmath180 can be neglected whereas @xmath181 is equal to @xmath186 . at biological temperature ( @xmath114 k ) , with the realistic parameters @xmath187 @xmath101 , @xmath111 @xmath101 , and @xmath102 @xmath101 we obtain @xmath188 @xmath101 so that @xmath189ps .    note",
    "that in a recent paper devoted to the tvbs relaxation in a molecular nanowire , it has been pointed out that , for a one - dimensional phonon bath , a given tvbs essentially decays into the other tvbs @xcite .",
    "the origine of the different with the present work is twofold .",
    "first , in ref.@xcite , the vibron dynamics was described according to a hubbard model for bosons which yields a single tvbs band ( almost identical to the tvbs - i ) .",
    "then , the coupling with the thermmal bath was assumed to be responsibel for a random modulation of the frequency of each molecule , i.e. @xmath190 , in marked contrast with the modulation of the vibron hopping constant considered in this paper ( see eq.([eq : dh ] ) ) .",
    "to summarize , the present paper was devoted to the characterization of the two - vibron relaxation mechanisms in an anharmonic @xmath0-helix protein . according to the small polaron model developed in ref .",
    "@xcite , it was shown that the relaxation originates in the interaction between the dressed anharmonic vibrons and the remaining phonons .",
    "this interaction is responsible for the occurrence of transitions between two - vibron eigenstates mediated by both phonon absorption and phonon emission . at biological temperature",
    ", we have established that the relaxation rate does not depends significantly on the nature of the two - vibron state involved in the process .",
    "therefore , for realistic values of the parameters , the rate ranges between 10 and 40 @xmath101 so that the corresponding lifetime is about 0.1 - 1.0 ps .",
    "note that tvbs - ii decay more rapidly than both tvbs - i and tvfs , the ratio between the corresponding rates being of about 1.5 .",
    "by contrast , we have shown that the relaxation channels strongly depends on the nature of the two - vibron states .",
    "more precisely , the spatially localized nature of tvbs , i.e. their breather - like character , is responsible for the specification of a given relaxation pathway . in that context ,",
    "tvbs - i , which correspond to the trapping of the two quanta around the same amide - i vibration , tend to decay into tvbs - ii which refer to the trapping of the two quanta around two nearest neighbor amide - i vibrations .",
    "by contrast , tvbs - ii decay into both tvbs - i and tvfs , the first channel being two times more efficient than the second one .    99 a. s. davydov and n. i. kisluka , phys .",

    "<S> , it is pointed out that the relaxation originates in the interaction between the dressed anharmonic vibrons and the remaining phonons . </S>",
    "<S> this interaction is responsible for the occurrence of transitions between two - vibron eigenstates mediated by both phonon absorption and phonon emission . at biological temperature </S>",
    "<S> , it is shown that the relaxation rate does not significantly depends on the nature of the two - vibron state involved in the process . therefore , the lifetime for both bound and free states is of the same order of magnitude and ranges between 0.1 and 1.0 ps for realistic parameters . </S>",
    "<S> by contrast , the relaxation channels strongly depend on the nature of the two - vibron states which is a consequence of the breather - like behavior of the two - vibron bound states . </S>"
