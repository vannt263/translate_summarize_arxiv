    "naturally occurring proteins fold into specific three - dimensional structures to achieve their unique functionality.@xcite for many proteins , it has been shown that the amino - acid sequence alone is sufficient to determine the folded conformation.@xcite interestingly , out of all geometrically possible folds , nature seems to have selected only a small set of fold families.@xcite this selection may arise , in part , from differences in the _ designability _ of folded structures.@xcite by definition , the designability of a structure is the number of amino - acid sequences with that structure as the lowest - free - energy conformation . in lattice models , where it is possible to enumerate all compact structures , there exists a small class of highly designable structures , _",
    "i.e. _ structures which are unique lowest - energy conformations of many more than their share of sequences.@xcite the sequences associated with these highly designable structures are found to have protein - like properties : mutational stability,@xcite thermodynamic stability,@xcite and fast folding kinetics.@xcite the topology of the neutral networks formed by the sequences of designable lattice model structures have also received study.@xcite recently , off - lattice studies of protein structures have also shown that certain backbone configurations are highly designable , and that the associated sequences have enhanced mutational and thermodynamic stability.@xcite therefore , whether one s goal is to better understand existing protein fold families or to design novel folds,@xcite designability may offer a way to identify structures and sequences with protein - like folding properties .    in previous work ,",
    "the determination of a structure s designability has relied upon the enumeration of a wide cross section of all possible structures .",
    "this is because the designability of one structure depends on competition for sequences from other structures . for short chains on lattices",
    "it is straightforward to enumerate all compact structures.@xcite for off - lattice models , one approach has been to enumerate all structures obtainable with a small , discrete set of backbone dihedral angles.@xcite clearly , for long peptide chains , this complete enumeration is infeasible , even for a small set of dihedral angles .",
    "can one nevertheless identify highly designable long - chain protein structures ?    in this paper",
    ", we present evidence from studies of short chains , up to @xmath1 , that the designability of a structure can be predicted without a complete enumeration of structures . essentially , this is possible because we have found that the designability of a structure is closely connected to its pattern of surface exposure .",
    "structures with large variation in surface exposure are likely to be highly designable , structures with more uniform surface exposure are not .",
    "the higher the designability of a structure , the more clearly differentiated are its surface and core .",
    "because the variation in surface exposure of a structure is independent of all other structures , designability can be estimated structure by structure without the need for complete enumeration .",
    "one implication of this result is that candidates for highly designable _ long - chain _ structures can be identified simply from their surface - exposure patterns .",
    "this approach avoids the need for a complete enumeration of structures .",
    "it is therefore computationally feasible to consider much longer peptide chains , with a greater variety of backbone conformations .",
    "we demonstrate the efficiency of this approach by generating backbone configurations of up to @xmath2 monomers . for these lengths ,",
    "complete enumeration of structures would be impractical .",
    "instead , we generate a relatively sparse sample of structures . from among the sample",
    "it is straightforward to select the candidate highly designable conformations as those with the most clearly delineated surfaces and cores .",
    "an effectively equivalent procedure is to calculate designability allowing only the structures in the sparse sample to compete for sequences . in either case , successful prediction of designability",
    "relies on its close relation to surface - exposure variation  a property of individual structures .",
    "there is one important caveat to this point  two structures with very similar patterns of surface exposure",
    "will compete for structures often in a `` winner - take - all '' fashion .",
    "the implications of this for design are discussed in sec .",
    "iii on random sampling .",
    "the results of the off - lattice model motivate us to consider the surface - exposure pattern of natural protein structures .",
    "we report a study of the surface - exposure pattern of backbones of up to length @xmath3 from the protein data bank . for small proteins , which are often stabilized by disulfide bonds and salt bridges ,",
    "there is often no clearly delineated core . in contrast , for large proteins the core is uniformly well defined with little variation from structure to structure .",
    "the most highly designable configurations generated using our sampling technique have patterns of surface exposure that fall within the range of naturally occurring proteins .",
    "the designability of a structure is a measure of how many sequences `` fold '' into that structure in relation to all other competing structures . to precisely determine designability requires generating a comprehensive set of structures , which then compete as possible lowest - energy states for amino - acid sequences .",
    "it is only truly feasible to generate a complete set of model structures for short polypeptide chains . for larger chains ,",
    "say with n @xmath4 30 monomers , it is not currently possible to enumerate structures .",
    "however , it will be shown below that it is possible to _ estimate _ the designability of structures without complete enumeration . to find the best means of estimating designability , we study short chains ( @xmath5 ) for which designability can be precisely determined within an off - lattice model .",
    "this section reviews our model for obtaining the designabilities of short - chain polypeptide structures . in the next section ,",
    "we show that the designability of a structure within this model can be estimated from its surface - exposure pattern .    _ off - lattice model _  our method of generating structures is closely related to the discrete - angle models introduced by park and levitt.@xcite for short polypeptide chains of @xmath6 monomers , a ",
    "complete \" set of backbones is generated using a fixed set of three dihedral @xmath7 angles.@xcite for this particular study , we employ one angle - pair @xmath8 from the alpha - helical region of a ramachandran plot , and two angle - pairs @xmath9 and @xmath10 from the beta - strand region .",
    "the complete set of @xmath11 backbones is generated with these angles .    to restrict our consideration to self - avoiding structures , we introduce `` side groups '' by hard spheres of radius @xmath12 centered on the c@xmath13 positions .",
    "self - avoidance is taken into account by discarding all structures with overlapping spheres .",
    "the percentage of self - avoiding structures out of the possible @xmath11 structures was found to be 42% for @xmath14 , 36% for @xmath15 and 31% for @xmath16 .",
    "an example of a structure generated using the three angle - pairs and with self - avoiding spheres centered on the c@xmath13 positions is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1p ] . _ hydrophobicity model _",
    " there is considerable evidence that hydrophobic forces are primarily responsible for the folding of an amino - acid sequence into a particular structure.@xcite the hydrophobicity of each type of amino acid can be determined experimentally.@xcite those which are more hydrophobic are energetically favored to reside in the core of the folded protein , where there is low exposure to water . in a given folded protein ,",
    "a hydrophobic energy can be assigned to each particular amino acid according to its hydrophobicity and its exposure to water .    to determine the hydrophobic energy of an amino - acid sequence folded into one of our model structures it is necessary to determine the exposure of each residue along the backbone . as described above ,",
    "hard spheres are placed on each @xmath17 position , and the surface exposure of these spheres to water is evaluated .",
    "this is done using the method of shrake and rupley@xcite which determines how much of a sphere centered on a @xmath17 position is exposed to a water molecule , which is represented as a sphere with a radius of @xmath18 angstroms .",
    "we use the notation that the @xmath19 residue of the @xmath20 structure has accessible surface area @xmath21 .",
    "the sum of these surface areas gives the total residue accessible surface area for a given structure . as a screen",
    ", we use this quantity to remove those structures which have too much surface exposure and thus are too open to be stable folds . in practice , we reduce the representative set to approximately @xmath22 structures with the least exposed surface area.@xcite    these remaining structures are `` compact '' in that even for the small peptide chains used in this study ( @xmath23 ) there is the beginning of the formation of a core which is inaccessible to solvent .",
    "we then normalize the surface area of the remaining compact structures using the following normalization condition ,",
    "@xmath24 the motivation behind this normalization procedure is that we wish the remaining compact structures to all be _ equally _ compact  the normalized structures all have the same total surface exposure ( @xmath25 ) .",
    "this is in line with lattice studies where all structures are equally compact.@xcite the normalization eliminates the need for an overall compactification energy in the energy function used below since all structures are equally compact .",
    "physically , the use of equally compact structures accounts for the tendency of each structure to relax to its best packed equivalent . with the residue - by - residue surface areas of a set of compact , self - avoiding structures in hand ,",
    "all that is needed is a hydrophobic - energy function to associate these structures with amino - acid sequences .",
    "we find it convenient to assign a _ polarity _ between @xmath26 and @xmath27 to each amino acid , with @xmath26 being highly hydrophobic and @xmath27 being highly polar .",
    "our notation is that the @xmath19 amino acid of a sequence @xmath28 has polarity @xmath29 . in our model ,",
    "the energy of this amino - acid sequence when folded into the @xmath20 structure is@xcite @xmath30 for a given sequence , the lowest - energy structure is the one that minimizes this energy .",
    "note that since all structures have the same total exposed surface ( @xmath31 ) , a sequence will have lowest energy on the structure that best matches its _ pattern _ of hydrophobicity  more hydrophobic at core sites , more polar at surface sites  independent of the absolute hydrophobicity or polarity of the sequence .",
    "_ designability _  the designability of a given structure is defined as the number of sequences with that structure as a unique lowest - energy conformation.@xcite we assess the designabilities of structures by evaluating the energy ( [ eq : e ] ) of a large number of random sequences of polarities on all the structures in the representative set .",
    "each sequence of polarities @xmath32 is generated as a string of @xmath33 random real numbers between @xmath26 and @xmath27 .",
    "consistent with a previous study,@xcite we report in the next section that most structures are the lowest - energy conformations of only a few or no sequences , and hence these structures have low designability .",
    "only a small fraction of structures are highly designable .",
    "we now examine the factors which influence a structure s designability . what causes a structure to be the lowest - energy state of many sequences within our hydrophobic model ?",
    "we show below that the _ variance _ of a structure s surface - area pattern is an important quantity in determining designability .",
    "_ predictors of designability _  in our model , the energy of a sequence folded into a particular structure is given by eq .",
    "( [ eq : e ] ) .",
    "therefore , the only property of a structure which influences energy is the structure s vector of solvent - exposed surface areas @xmath34 .",
    "moreover , because of the normalization condition , eq .",
    "( [ eq : norm ] ) , all such vectors reside on an @xmath33-dimensional hyper - plane ( _ e.g. _ for a chain of length n = 3 , the vectors would reside on the plane @xmath35 ) .",
    "the vectors for all structures can be decomposed into a constant component @xmath36 normal to this hyper - plane plus a variable in - plane component ( see fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] ) .",
    "we denote a structure s in - plane component by @xmath37 . for a given sequence ,",
    "the relative energies of structures depend only on these @xmath38 s , as can be seen by rewriting the hydrophobic energy as @xmath39 where the last term is structure independent .",
    "the first term in the energy ( [ eq : etwo ] ) is the negative of an n - dimensional dot product between the polarity vector @xmath40 of the sequence and the in - plane component @xmath38 of the structure .",
    "the lowest - energy structure is the one for which this dot product is the greatest .",
    "the vector @xmath40 can also be written in terms of a component parallel to the normal vector @xmath41 of the hyper - plane and a component that lies in the hyper - plane . for a given sequence",
    ", the lowest - energy structure will be the structure that has the greatest projection of its in - plane component @xmath38 onto the in - plane component of the vector @xmath40 .",
    "hence , structures that lie the farthest out from the `` origin of the hyperplane '' , @xmath41 , on this plane will tend to be lowest - energy structures for the most sequences ( _ e.g. _ , structure `` s '' shown in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "distance from the origin @xmath41 on the hyper - plane is therefore expected to be an easy - to - calculate predictor of designability . for a given structure",
    "this distance is @xmath42 note that @xmath43 is the variance of a structure s residue - by - residue exposed surface area . from a physical point of view , the in - plane distance @xmath44 is a measure of how much variation there is in a structure s exposed surface area compared to uniform exposure to solvent .",
    "structures that have large values of @xmath44 have well differentiated core and surface sites . however , designability is determined by more than just @xmath44 . by definition , to be highly designable , a structure must be the lowest - energy state for a large number of sequences @xmath40 .",
    "for each of the structures with large @xmath44 there exists a kind of `` hyper - cone '' of sequences @xmath40 for which it is the lowest - energy state@xcite ( this is shown schematically by the shaded area in fig .  [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "the volume of this cone , and hence the designability of the structure , depends on the density of competing structures around it .",
    "this suggests that structures that lie farthest from other structures on the hyper - plane will be most designable .",
    "for example , a structure that is not the farthest out in its own direction will tend to be less designable because a farther out structure will be lower in energy for all sequences lying in the same direction .",
    "hence , an improved predictor for designability is the distance of a structure from the center of the distribution of structures.@xcite we denote this distance from the mean by @xmath45 where @xmath46 and where @xmath47 is the mean of the distribution of exposure vectors in the plane , @xmath48 with @xmath49 the total number of structures in the set",
    ". one can determine if a structure is the farthest out in its own direction by simply projecting all of the other @xmath50 s onto its own @xmath50 .",
    "structures that have a large distance from the mean and also lie the farthest out in their own direction are shown below to be highly designable .",
    "it has been previously shown in lattice models that the designability of a structure is inversely correlated with the density of other structures in its local neighborhood.@xcite however , to generate enough structures to adequately sample local densities essentially requires complete enumeration of structures .",
    "in contrast , the quantities @xmath51 and @xmath52 depend only upon a structure s global position within the space and require sampling of relatively few structures to compute . fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] illustrates the quantities of interest,@xmath38 and @xmath50 , for a particular structure that lies far from the origin on the hyper - plane .",
    "we now examine how these quantities correlate with designability for some specific cases .    _",
    "enumeration studies of 15 , 17 , and 19mers _  the complete set of all self - avoiding compact structures was generated using the three angle set described in sec .",
    "ii for lengths @xmath53 . for each set of structures at a given length @xmath33 , we evaluated designability using the enumeration method described in sec .",
    "ii , and ranked the structures from highest to lowest designability . in fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] , the histogram of designability for the 17mer is shown .",
    "consistent with other studies of designability , the histogram has an exponentially decreasing tail of highly designable structures.@xcite most of the structures in the representative set have low designability , whereas only a few are highly designable .",
    "the distances @xmath44 and @xmath54 were also computed for all structures .",
    "the difference between the in - plane distance @xmath44 and the distance from the mean @xmath54 arises from the fact that the mean exposure vector in the plane @xmath55 is not zero . in fig .",
    "[ fig3a ] , the mean vector @xmath56 for the @xmath15 case is shown . from the plot it is clear that the ends of a 17mer are on average more exposed to solvent than the central portion .",
    "for the other lengths studied the same behavior was found , namely , averaged over the representative set , the ends of the structures tend to be more exposed than the central portion .    before looking at how designability correlates with @xmath54 and @xmath44 ,",
    "we briefly show how they relate to a structure s compactness . in fig .",
    "[ fig3b ] , a histogram of the in - plane distances @xmath44 is shown for _ all _ self - avoiding 17mers ( solid line ) and the 5000 most compact 17mers ( dashed line ) .",
    "the figure shows that our screen of structures for compactness removes most structures which have low values of @xmath44 , but does not remove those that have high values of @xmath44 .",
    "hence structures that have a large in - plane distance @xmath44 , _",
    "i.e. _ large surface - exposure variation , are also compact .    fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] shows the correlation between the in - plane distance @xmath44 and the distance from the mean @xmath54 , and how these relate to designability for the @xmath15 case .",
    "there is a clear correlation between the two distances @xmath54 and @xmath44 , but @xmath54 is a better predictor of designability .",
    "the top 50 designable structures are shown as black circles in fig .",
    "most of the top 50 designable structures have values of @xmath57 , and only a few less designable structures have @xmath54 values this high .",
    "in contrast , only about 10 out of the 50 topmost designable structures have values of @xmath58 , and for values less than this there is a mixture of designable structures with less designable ones .",
    "hence , high @xmath54 is a better discriminator of high designability than high @xmath44 .",
    "this difference between @xmath54 and @xmath44 reflects the fact that distance from the mean @xmath54 better identifies the structures which are outliers from the distribution , and are hence likely to have high designability .",
    "we have thus found a quantity @xmath54 , determined purely from a single structure s surface - exposure pattern , that can be used to identify highly designable structures .",
    "the implication of having a quantity that can estimate designability from the properties of a single structure is that enumeration of a large set of competing structures is not necessary .",
    "this lifts the severe computational constraint that enumeration places on the size and complexity of structures that can be considered . in the remainder of this section",
    ", we study in more detail the relation between surface - exposure distance from the mean @xmath54 and the designability of structures .",
    "our attention is focused on the possibility of identifying highly designable structures within a random sample , using either designability within the sample or distance from the mean @xmath54 .",

    "the structures for each chain length were binned according to @xmath54 and the average designability of the structures in each bin is plotted .",
    "the correlation between @xmath54 and designability is clear , but there is an important caveat .",
    "we have only plotted the designability of structures which are the farthest from the mean in their own direction  this means that there are no other structures whose @xmath61 has a greater projection onto the given structure s direction @xmath50 , _",
    "i.e. _ @xmath62 . for all other structures @xmath63 . in this way",
    ", we have plotted only the `` winners '' in the winner - take - all competition for sequences that occurs when two or more structures have very similar patterns of surface exposure . in part , this procedure is justified to select only one member from every family of geometrically closely related structures.@xcite fig .",
    "[ fig5b ] illustrates the effect of this winner take all competition for the @xmath15 case .",

    "[ fig5b](b ) is a plot of designability versus @xmath54 for the  winning \" structures , which are the farthest from the mean in their own direction .",
    "it can be seen that there are a large number of structures which have low designability despite having a large distance from the mean .",
    "their designability has been reduced due to competition with a structure which is farther out on the hyper - plane",
    ". however , the structures with the largest values of distance from the mean @xmath54 are all highly designable . in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] , the marked vertical lines on each graph indicate the values of @xmath54 for the 10th , 100th , and 1000th ranked structures according to @xmath54 in the _ entire _ set of compact structures . to highlight the significance of this in regards to random sampling ,",
    "consider the following : if only @xmath64% of the 17mer structures were sampled , it would still be expected that the 1000th ranked structure would occur in the sample . from the graph of the 17mer",
    ", even the 1000th ranked structure still has a reasonably high designability in that , on average , it is the ground state for a few hundred sequences .",
    "it is interesting to note that the designability versus @xmath54 curves become steeper as chain length @xmath33 increases .",
    "hence , it is reasonable to conclude that for larger protein structures , @xmath54 _ improves _ as a predictor of designability .    to emphasize how a structure s location within fold space influences its designability , in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] we present histograms of the number of nearby structures for the 1st , 100th , and least designable `` winner '' structures . to make these plots , we calculated the projections of all @xmath50 vectors onto the selected structure s @xmath50 vector .",

    "these near neighbors in fold space compete for sequences and are responsible for the low designability value .    _ random sampling for 17mers _  to show that highly designable structures can be identified within a sparse random sample we performed the following test .",
    "we randomly selected a set of 500 structures out of the complete set of 5000 compact 17mers .",
    "a designability calculation was then done for this small random sample . in fig .",

    "the correlation is good , with the highest designability structure correctly identified .",
    "the essential reason underlying the good agreement is the close correlation between designability and @xmath54 ( cf .",
    "[ fig5 ] ) combined with the fact that @xmath54 for the random sample is effectively the same as @xmath54 for the complete set .",
    "this last relation is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig7](b ) , where we have re - evaluated the @xmath54 s using the new mean @xmath65 of the random sample .",
    "the logic of random sampling is simple  we can identify highly designable structures from their large @xmath54 values , and only a small sample is required to calculate these @xmath54 s .",

    "the matrix of transition probabilities in table 1 was adapted from an analysis of transition probabilities between @xmath7 pairs of naturally occurring protein structures.@xcite the transition probabilities involving the left - handed alpha - helical angle were altered to include more turns to generate compact 30mers and 40mers for this study . as before , hard spheres were centered on each @xmath17 position and self - avoidance was enforced by eliminating structures with overlapping spheres .",

    "in conclusion , we have shown that it is possible to estimate the relative designabilities of protein structures based on their exposed surface - area patterns , within an off - lattice model .",
    "specifically , the _ designability _ of a structure  defined as the number of sequences with that structure as a unique lowest - energy state  was found to closely correlate with the surface - exposure variation of the structure .",
    "the ability to estimate designability from the properties of a single structure makes it unnecessary to completely enumerate structures . instead",
    ", a sparse sample of structures can be generated , and relative designability assessed from designability within the sample , or directly from the surface - exposure variation of each structure .",
    "random sampling , in turn , allows consideration of longer chains with greater structural complexity .",
    "we have demonstrated the random sampling approach to designability for 30mers and 40mers .",
    "our best candidates for highly designable structures were found to have surface - exposure variations similar to those of naturally occurring structures of the same size .",
