    "the recently discovered particle at the lhc , with mass in the vicinity of 125  gev  @xcite , has properties which closely resemble those of the standard model ( sm ) higgs boson  @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , it is still possible that this particle is an impostor , not directly or entirely related to the breaking of the electroweak symmetry .",
    "a motivated example for such a scenario is that of a dilaton , the ( pseudo)-goldstone boson of a spontaneously broken conformal symmetry  ( cft ) , with properties similar to those of the sm higgs boson .",
    "previous works  @xcite show that the data collected by the lhc already disfavors the simple scenario of a pure dilaton , in which all the sm particles are affected similarly by the strong dynamics .",
    "more generally , both a dilaton and an @xmath0 higgs doublet may be present .",
    "the two fields can mix at low energies , resulting in two physical scalars , each with collider production and decay modes similar to those of a higgs boson .",
    "it is necessary to understand the extent to which one can experimentally differentiate between the cases of a pure higgs , a pure dilaton , and a mixture of the two .",
    "the dilaton has experimental implications beyond higgs phenomenology .",
    "in particular , under mild assumptions , the dilaton is expected to couple to dark matter ( dm ) particles in a well defined manner at low energies , with interaction strength proportional to the dm mass .",
    "consequently , the dilaton field mediates the different interactions between the dark and the visible sector  @xcite .",
    "we therefore make the following simplifying assumptions :    1 .",
    "the dm interacts with the visible sector only through the dilaton field , and 2 .",
    "the sm and dm particles are fully embedded in the strongly coupled sector .    with assumption  ( 1 ) , a prediction for the dm signal rates in direct and indirect detection experiments may be obtained .",
    "assumption  ( 2 ) implies that all sm particles couple to the dilaton through specific non - renormalizable interactions , allowing for a minimal set of parameters which span the theory space .",
    "these are :    * @xmath1 , the dm mass , * @xmath2 , the dilaton - higgs mixing angle , * @xmath3 , the heavy scalar mass , and * @xmath4 , the cft breaking scale .",
    "assumption  ( 2 ) may be somewhat relaxed , if mixing arises between a weakly coupled and a strongly coupled sector . in this case , different sm particles may carry distinct anomalous dimensions , leading to different couplings to the dilaton .",
    "this scenario , which is beyond the scope of this paper , is less constrained as it encompasses a much larger parameter space .",
    "( see , for instance , ref .",
    "@xcite . )    under these assumptions , we explore the higgs - dilaton mixing scenario as a portal between the visible and the dark sector ( for a pre - lhc study of the dilaton portal , see  @xcite ) .",
    "we study the various collider constraints on the scalar parameter space ( masses and mixing ) , including lhc higgs data , electroweak precision measurements ( ewpm ) and the null searches for new scalars .",
    "the observed dm relic density , as well as the searches for dm , constrain the allowed model parameter space as a function of dm mass .",
    "we analyze these constraints using two distinct scenarios for the dm relic density , that will be described in more detail below .",
    "we further define two limits in which the light scalar has sm - like properties : ( i ) the alignment limit and ( ii ) the decoupling limit , in which analytical approximations can be made . we show that existing data push the theory towards the decoupling limit , with the cft scale above the tev .",
    "we further present the predictions for upcoming direct searches for dm .",
    "the plan of this paper is as follows . in section  2",
    "we define the framework and specify the model parameter space .",
    "section  3 is devoted to the experimental data that restrict the model .",
    "specifically , in section  3.1 we study the different collider bounds , while observables related to the dark sector are analyzed in section 3.2 .",
    "we conclude on section  4 .",
    "we begin with the low - energy description of the sm , a dilaton and a fermionic dark matter candidate .",
    "as explained in the introduction , the dark sector is assumed to be secluded from the visible sector , communicating only via the dilaton portal .",
    "we assume that the dilaton compensator field , @xmath5 , couples uniformly to the visible sector and the dark sector .",
    "this follows from the assumption that both the sm and the dark sector are embedded in the same strongly coupled sector and do not mix with elementary , weakly coupled fields  @xcite .    under these assumption",
    "the lagrangian takes the form [ eq : lint ] _ = _",
    "^+t^_+  , with  @xcite t^_=_ig_i()(d_i-4)o_i(x)+_i_i(g ) .",
    "the sm lagrangian , @xmath6 , is a sum of operators @xmath7 at the scale @xmath8 with dimension @xmath9 $ ] .",
    "we assume the contribution from the beta - functions above is small except for marginal operators . moreover , we determine the energy - momentum tensor in the ew broken vacuum .",
    "the physical spectrum contains two mass eigenstates : a light scalar , @xmath10 , with @xmath11  gev , and a heavy scalar , @xmath12 : h = c__sm+s_,h =- s__sm+c _ , where @xmath13 is the sm excitation about @xmath14 gev and @xmath15 , @xmath16 .",
    "the precise nature of the higgs - dilaton mixing depends on the uv completion of the theory , whose origin is beyond the scope of this work .",
    "we note , however , that one realization of such a mixing arises from mixed kinetic term in the lagrangian . in general , the mixing is dictated by a free parameter from the low energy perspective , expected to vanish as the cft scale decouples .",
    "the effective interaction lagrangian , below the cft breaking scale and above the top mass is [ eq : lint ] _",

    "the cubic scalar interactions take the form : [ eq : tlc ] l_^3&&=-_hhhhhh-_hhhhhh + & & -_hhhhhh-_hhhhhh , where the trilinear couplings are specified in appendix  a.    the different couplings presented in eqs .   and   dictate the higgs phenomenology , as well as the various processes which involve dm particles .",
    "these depend on the four parameters r_f , s_,m_h , m_. to keep the perturbative expansion consistent , we assume @xmath22 and @xmath23 . the sm limit is favored by the recent lhc higgs data , see for example  @xcite .",
    "we expect this limit to be recovered in two distinct cases :    1 .",
    "the alignment limit , @xmath24 , in which no mixing arises , regardless of the new physics scale  @xcite .",
    "the decoupling limit , in which and the cft scale is largely separated from the ew scale @xmath25 . in that case one also expects @xmath24 .    in the next sections we study the various experimental constraints on the higgs - dilaton scenario , concentrating on these two limits .",
    "out numerical results are shown in section  4 .",
    "vs. @xmath26 . shown are the @xmath27 preferred regions by lhc higgs searches  ( blue ) , ewpm  ( green ) , and direct heavy scalar searches  ( purple ) .",
    "the constraints from ewpm and heavy scalar searches are shown for @xmath28 gev and @xmath29 gev . within the black boundaries",
    "are the allowed regions , combining all constraints , for each value of @xmath3 .",
    "[ fig : higgs ] , scaledwidth=49.0% ]    in the following we elaborate on the various experimental results which restrict the parameter space of the higgs - dilaton model",
    ". whenever possible , we present and discuss the analytic approximations of these constraints in the decoupling and alignment limits .",
    "our numerical results are shown in section  4 .",
    "much like electroweak and flavor precision measurements , the lhc higgs rate measurements have begun to play an important role in model building .",
    "higgs rate measurements are reported as a confidence interval on the event rate relative to the sm prediction , denoted by @xmath30 .",
    "we consider the measured higgs decay channels into @xmath31 , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 and @xmath35 from atlas  @xcite , cms  @xcite and the tevatron  @xcite , using the sm values as taken from  @xcite .    since the gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) process dominates the higgs production at the lhc , the bulk of the higgs production rates have similar dependence on @xmath36 and @xmath37 .",
    "in the decoupling and alignment limits , they read [ eq : lhc ] _ ggf , hxx    1 + 23r_fs_-s_^2 , & for  x = w , z , f , + 1 + 22r_fs_-s_^2 , & for  x=.    an effectual estimate of the constraints can be made from a global fit combining all higgs decay channels .",

    "this change , along with the presence of the extra heavy scalar , modify the prediction for the oblique ew parameters with respect to their sm values  @xcite : x&&=x_s(m_h ) + & & + ( r_fc_-s_)^2x_s(m_h ) , where @xmath43 is the scalar loop contribution to the parameter @xmath44 , defined in appendix  c of  @xcite .",
    "the values ( and errors ) for the oblique parameters obtained from the electroweak precision measurement ( ewpm ) are taken from ref .",
    "@xcite .    if @xmath45 is realized , the ewpm are independent of @xmath3 , with @xmath46 . in this case",
    "we find that [ eq : rlambound ] s_r_f0.4 is allowed by ewpm regardless of @xmath3 .",
    "if @xmath47 , ewpm push the parameter space of the model into both the decoupling and the alignment limits : @xmath48 .",
    "interestingly , while the higgs data is insensitive to @xmath49 in the alignment limit , the ew oblique parameters are still affected by the heavy scalar .",
    "the numerical results of the ewpm restrictions are shown in fig.[fig : higgs ] .",
    "the heavy scalar has similar production and decay channels as the light one , and therefore is tightly constrained by the lhc higgs searches .",
    "the atlas  @xcite and cms  @xcite collaborations null searches in the @xmath31 and @xmath32 decay mode place stringent bounds on the model parameter space for @xmath50  tev .",

    "a comment is in order concerning the width of the heavy scalar .",

    "assuming no other mediation between the dark sector and the visible sector , this determines the expected interaction rate in direct and indirect dm detection experiments . in this section",
    "we specify the constraints arising from these searches .",
    "we further analyze the dm annihilation processes into the visible sector which determine its relic abundance .",
    "we consider two distinct scenarios :    * * @xmath55 may have hidden annihilation channels . * @xmath55 constitutes the full dm relic abundance , while it may annihilate not only to sm particles ( via the dilaton portal ) but also to other dark sector states .",

    "* @xmath55 particles annihilate only via the dilaton portal into the sm .",
    "* we do not demand that @xmath55 is the only dm particle , but require that it does not over close the universe .",

    "before , we first elaborate on the different constraints , and give , whenever enlightening , analytic approximations in the decoupling limit and the alignment limit .",
    "the complete numerical results are given in section  4 .",
    "the dm particles are in thermal equilibrium at the early universe and annihilate into sm fermions , gauge bosons and higgs pairs via @xmath59-wave processes . the total annihilation cross - section , @xmath60 , yields the following approximate relic abundance  @xcite : [ eq : omegaapp ] ( ) ( ) .",

    "<S> we study a scenario in which the dilaton , a pseudo - goldstone boson of the spontaneous breaking of conformal symmetry , provides a portal between dark matter and the visible sector . </S>",
    "<S> we consider the low - energy description of the theory in which the dilaton mixes with the standard model higgs boson , thereby predicting a second scalar at or above the weak scale . </S>",
    "<S> we derive the collider and dark matter constraints on the corresponding parameter space and find that existing experimental data point towards the decoupling limit in which the cft scale is well above the electroweak scale . </S>",
    "<S> moreover , the thermal production of dark matter implies its mass is likely above the tev scale . </S>",
    "<S> upcoming direct detection experiments may allow for the discovery of the dilaton - mediated thermal dark matter while future collider studies will also be sensitive to the available parameter space . </S>"
