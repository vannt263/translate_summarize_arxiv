    "the progenitors of core - collapse supernovae are most probably formed in giant molecular clouds ( mcs ) . due to the short lifetime , they are not far away from their matrices when they explode .",
    "therefore it is common that the supernova remnants ( snrs ) are located in the vicinity of mcs and may encounter them in evolution .",
    "the association with mcs often results in irregular morphology of the snrs in multiwavelengths , which indicates sophisticated shock interaction with the inhomogeneous environmental medium .",
    "about 20 snrs have been discovered to be physically interacting with ambient molecular gas based on the detection of the 1720  mhz oh masers ( frail et al .  1996 ) , which are believed to be a tracer of the shock interaction with mcs ( lockett et al .",

    "snr  kesteven  69 is thought to be probably associated with mcs , because of the oh masers detected toward this remnant ; however , the masers are found at various local standard rest ( lsr ) velocities and at various projected locations .",

    "recently hewitt , yusef - zadeh , & wardle ( 2008 ) not only found that this compact maser also has faint emission at @xmath4 , but also detected extended oh maser emission at the velocity of @xmath6 with the green bank telescope observation and the vla archival observation toward the southern bright radio shell .",
    "the different lsr systemic velocities imply the mcs at different distances that may be impacted by the snr shock wave . therefore investigation is needed to clarify",

    "considering the @xmath1co@xmath74co ratio ( 3070 ) of the general interstellar medium ( langer 1992 and references therein ) , the hco@xmath0/co abundance ratio is @xmath75 5@xmath76 .",

    "the hco@xmath0  abundance is expected to be reduced in a slow , nondissociating shock , unless some enhanced ionization is present ( iglesias & silk 1978 ; elitzur 1983 ) .",
    "we note that the extended maser emission on the southern rim is found at the same lsr velocity ( hewitt et al .",
    "2008 ) , which implies that the dense molecular gas at this velocity is disturbed by c - type shock .",
    "for the origin of hco@xmath0emission , though , further observation is needed to make a decision .",
    "combination of the multiwavelength observations toward kes  69(fig .",
    "[ f:3c ] ) shows some interesting morphological correlation .",
    "first , the southeastern 77@xmath5 molecular shell is not only coincident well with the 1.4  ghz radio shell ( as pointed out above ) , but also ( as seen in fig .",
    "[ f : ir ] ) with the mid - ir `` ridge '' described in reach et al .  ( 2006 ) .",
    "this mid - ir ridge is prominent in 4.5@xmath8 m , with a relatively high brightness in 5.8@xmath8 m .",
    "a part of the @xmath26 @xmath8 m floclike emission in the southeast is also aligned with the molecular shell ( fig .",
    "[ f : ir ] ) .",
    "the presence of the molecular shell is consistent with the hco@xmath0  and extended 1720  mhz oh maser emission at @xmath4 along the southern rim .",
    "this correspondence in morphological features is most probably another signature of the snr - mc interaction , in addition to the 1720 mhz oh masers detected in kes  69 .",
    "second , as described above , both the sections of molecular arcs at @xmath78@xmath5 in the southeast and the northwest seem to be aligned along a circle . a faint 1.4  ghz bar in the north ( highlighted by a red contour in fig .",
    "[ f:3c ] ) is also along this circle .",
    "moreover , as noted by yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , there is a faint radio shell in the northwest in the low - resolution 330  mhz image of kes  69  ( kassim 1992 ) , which is confused with the hii region g21.9020.368 .",
    "we note that the peak of this patch of radio emission roughly coincides with the northwestern section of the molecular arc .",
    "these morphological correlations demonstrate that kes  69  is associated with the giant mc at the systemic velocity of @xmath6 .",
    "this association is strengthened by the detection of the extended and compact 1720  mhz oh maser emission and the hco@xmath0  emission at @xmath4 from the snr region .",
    "the southeastern half of the circle is roughly x - ray bright , while the other half appears to be x - ray faint but covered by the 79@xmath45 molecular gas .",
    "this brightness anticorrelation between the x - ray and co emission , however , does not imply that the molecular gas in the northwestern half obscures the x - rays .",
    "we estimate the hydrogen column density of this gas ( in the interval 79@xmath45 ) to be @xmath79 .",
    "if there were an x - ray emitting gas , with similar properties to that observed in the southeast ( temperature @xmath80 and intervening hydrogen column @xmath81 ; yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2003 ) , behind this northwestern molecular gas , then an extra extinction by the @xmath79 gas would only cause an @xmath82 decrease in the 0.52  kev x - ray flux and this x - ray emission could have been observable . thus we conclude that the x - ray faintness in the northwest is not caused by the absorption of the diffuse 79@xmath45 molecular gas , whether this gas is connected to the @xmath6 cloud or not .",
    "the association between snr  kes  69  and the mc at systemic velocity @xmath4 facilitates a convincing determination of the kinematic distance to the remnant .",
    "the systemic velocity @xmath4 is suggestive of two candidate kinematic distances to the snr / mc association , 5.2  kpc and 9.6  kpc .",
    "the choice can be made with the aid of the hi absorption along the line of sight . following the method used in tian , leahy , & wang ( 2007 ) and tian & leahy ( 2008a )",
    ", we produced three hi spectra of regions along the southeastern shell of kes  69 , as shown in figure  [ f : hispec ] .",
    "distinct absorption features appear at 4 , 6 , 15 , 40 , 48 , 67 , 70 , 82 , and @xmath47 .",
    "the @xmath1co  components along the shell around 5 and 50 @xmath38 ( fig .",
    "[ f : regionspec ] ) can , due to the corresponding absorption features in the hi spectra , can be related to the chance - coincident foreground gas .",
    "no hi absorption features are present around the tangent point velocity @xmath83 , which indicates that the snr is in front of the tangent point ( at 7.4  kpc ) .",
    "hence , the distance to the snr is @xmath84 .",
    "we note that a similar estimate has in the meantime been given by tian & leahy ( 2008b ) .",
    "the southeastern molecular arc is revealed above to be coincident with the radio and ir shell and move at a velocity @xmath85 of order @xmath86 ( matching the blueshifted line broadening which reflects the velocity component in the line of sight ) .",
    "the broadened blue wing of the @xmath6 line profile of the molecular arc implies that the giant molecular cloud may have suffered a perturbation from the rear side .",
    "three scenarios regarding the dynamical relation between the molecular arc and the snr are discussed below .",
    "first , the arc is likely to be a flake of molecular gas that is shocked by the slow transmitted cloud shock after the snr blast wave hits the molecular cloud . in this case",
    ", the radio continuum emission may arise from the snr shock that is blocked by dense cloud ( frail & mitchell 1998 ) or the blast wave that propagates in the intercloud medium ( blandford & cowie 1982 ) , and the thermal x - ray emission may be ascribed to the hot gas behind the shocked molecular gas or just behind the blast wave . thus there can be a crude pressure balance between the cloud shock and the x - ray emitting hot gas ( zeldovich & raizer 1967 ; mckee & cowie 1975 ) : @xmath87 , where @xmath88 denotes the number density of the hydrogen atoms ahead of the cloud shock , @xmath89 the density of the undisturbed intercloud medium , and @xmath90 the velocity of the blast wave .",
    "velocity @xmath90 is related to the postshock temperature @xmath91 as @xmath92^{1/2}$ ] , where @xmath93 is the hydrogen atom mass and @xmath94 is the average atomic weight . adopting @xmath80 from the _ rosat _ x - ray observation ( yusef - zadeh et al .",
    "2003 ) , we have @xmath95 and @xmath96 , implying that the blast wave hits a very dense matter in the molecular arc ( here @xmath89 is assumed to be similar to the mean density of the x - ray emitting gas , @xmath97 , as obtained from a reproduced _ rosat _ x - ray spectral analysis ( where @xmath98 is used for scaling ) from the volume emission measure @xmath99 of an elliptical region ( with half - axes @xmath100 ) , for which a volume of an oblate spheroid ( with half - axes @xmath101 ) is assumed . ] ) . in this scenario , assuming an adiabatic expansion and adopting the snr extent represented by the circle of radius @xmath102 (  [ sec : morph ] ) or @xmath103 , the snr s age is estimated as @xmath104  kyr and the explosion energy is @xmath105 ( where @xmath106 ) .",
    "the 4.5@xmath8 m and 5.8@xmath8 m mid - ir emissions are suggested to be likely dominated by lines of shocked gas ( reach et al .",
    "they note that the 5.8@xmath8 m emission is relatively strong , but it is not clear whether h@xmath67 or [ fe ii ] lines ( as likely mechanisms ) are responsible for this emission , unlike the case of ic  443 , in which the [ fe ii ] and h@xmath67 lines are very clearly segregated to the northern and southern regions of the remnant , respectively ( see rho et al .",
    "the h@xmath67 emission seems to be consistent with the slow molecular shock , while [ fe ii ] emission could not be ruled out with the present observations if the snr shocks propagate in a complicated multi - phase medium .",
    "the @xmath26 @xmath8 m emission along the arc is likely to arise from the shocked molecular gas ( e.g. , oh and h@xmath67o ) , shock - heated dust grains , and even probably ions .",
    "the oh maser , hco@xmath0 , and h@xmath67o ( if any ) emissions are consistent with a c - type molecular shock .",
    "second , let us discuss the scenario in which the arc represents the interstellar material swept up all the way by the snr shock wave .",
    "the mass of the southeastern molecular arc is in the range of 0.5@xmath57 @xmath107 , with the gas mass observed in the whole line profile adopted as the upper limit and that of the broadened part as the lower limit ( table  [ tb : se ] ) . in the swept - up case ,",
    "the southeastern arc consists of the molecular gas that was originally of mean density @xmath108@xmath109 , distributed in an approximate 1/8th volume of a sphere of radius @xmath110 ( considering the one - sided line broadening ) . in this scenario ,",
    "the velocity of the snr shock is represented by the arc s slow expansion ( @xmath111 ) , which would imply that the snr is in the radiative phase .",
    "the explosion energy of the snr , @xmath112^{1.12}$ $ ( v_m/10{\\,{\\rm km}}{\\,{\\rm s}^{-1}})^{1.4}{\\,{\\rm erg}}$ ] ( chevalier 1974 ) , would have seemed to be normal , despite the seldom large age @xmath113 @xmath114 @xmath115 for x - ray - bright snrs .",
    "however , the x - rays are bright along the southern shell and two x - ray emission peaks are essentially coincident with the two radio peaks ( fig",
    ".  [ f:3c ] ; toward which the pointing molecular line observation was made ) . a radiative shock as slow as @xmath86 could not be responsible for such x - rays along the snr rim . on the other hand , to accelerate particles to relativistic energies for emitting radio synchrotron , the lower limit of the shock velocity is ( draine & mckee 1993 ) : @xmath116 @xmath117^{1/8}$ ] @xmath118 @xmath119 , where @xmath120 is the ionization fraction , @xmath121 the efficiency of the particle acceleration of the shock , and @xmath122 the preshock molecular gas temperature .",
    "it is much larger than the observed expansion velocity of the molecular shell , and thus new particle acceleration would be difficult to take place at this shock .",
    "the existing relativistic electrons would rapidly stream freely away from the shock front for a very low ionization fraction ( blandford & cowie 1982 ) .",
    "moreover , because of the ambipolar diffusion , the magnetic field will separate from the neutral gas in a timescale ( blandford & cowie 1982 ) : @xmath123 @xmath124 @xmath117 ^ 2 $ ] @xmath125 @xmath126 ( where @xmath127 is the magnetic field strength in the unshocked gas , @xmath128 the density compression ratio , and @xmath129 the shell thickness ) , very likely to be smaller than the remnant age in this case ( even for @xmath130 ) .",
    "therefore , such a slow expansion of molecular cloud is difficult to account for the snr s radio emission . in view of the above points",
    ", this scenario does not apply to the molecular shell of kes  69 .",
    "third , the molecular shell may be the debris of the cooled , condensed material , which was swept up by the stellar wind of the supernova progenitor from the molecular gas [ @xmath131 and is now hit by the snr shock",
    ". this possibility could be compatible with the first scenario and naturally explain why there is pre - existing , very dense material that is now hit by the snr shock .",
    "a molecular wind - bubble shell has recently been discovered coincident with the ring nebula g79.29 + 0.46 surrounding a luminous blue variable star ( rizzo et al .",
    "2008 ) , which provides an instance for this scenario .",
    "if there was a stellar - wind bubble , it was created ( castor et al .",
    "1975 ; weaver et al .  1977 )",
    "@xmath132^{1/3}$ ]  yr ago , where @xmath133 is the mechanical luminosity of the stellar wind in units of @xmath134 , and the present velocity of the shell is @xmath135 @xmath136^{-1/3}\\,{\\rm km~s}^{-1}$ ] .",
    "this velocity is comparable to the blueshift in the broadened line profile of the molecular gas along the shell .",
    "there appears to be a blowout morphology outlined by the extension of the radio / co shell to the northeast out of the circle ( figs .",
    "[ f : coregion ] and  [ f:3c ] ) , somewhat similar to the blowout morphology in snr  n132d ( e.g. , dickel & milne 1995 ; xiao & chen 2008 ) .",

    "the northeastern compact masers at both 69 and @xmath4 are projected in the blowout region . in this case , as a possibility , the @xmath137 maser could arise from a dense clump deviating from the systemic velocity by a strong perturbation , although it can not be excluded from being nonassociated with the same snr .",

    "an @xmath4 hco@xmath0  emission is found to arise from a radio peak on the shell .",
    "both the molecular arc and the hco@xmath0  emission at @xmath6 seem to be consistent with the presence of the extended 1720 mhz oh emission along the southeastern boundary of kes  69 .",
    "the morphology correspondence between the co emission and other band emission of the kes  69  shell provides strong evidence for the association of the snr with the @xmath6 component of molecular gas .",

    "both the molecular arcs , together with the faint northern radio features , seem to be distributed along a circle of radius @xmath46 .",
    "the multiwavelength emissions along the southeastern shell can be explained by the impact of the snr shock on a dense , clumpy patch of molecular gas .",
    "this pre - existing gas is likely to be a part of the cooled , clumpy debris of the interstellar molecular gas swept up by the progenitor s stellar wind .",
    "the association between snr  kes  69  and the mc at the systemic velocity @xmath6 enables us to place the snr at a kinematic distance of 5.2  kpc .",
