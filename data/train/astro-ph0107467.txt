    "mark mccaughrean in his opening address at this conference highlighted a number of important events that occurred in 1977 , in particular iau symposium 75 on star formation whose proceedings appeared that year .",
    "it is fitting that bhr  71 , which is featured in a beautiful vlt optical image in the frontpiece ( & poster ) of these proceedings , can trace its origins in the literature to that same year .",
    "the globule properties have been determined by bourke  ( 1995b , 1997 ) .",
    "spatially and kinematically bhr  71 is associated with the coalsack at an assumed distance of 200  pc , though it may be as close as 150@xmath230  pc ( corradi  1997 ) .",
    "large scale  &  maps of the globule give a size of @xmath00.5  pc and mass 40 , while  observations which trace high column density gas imply a size @xmath3  pc and a mass of 12 . the high density ( n@xmath4 ) core traced in ammonia is @xmath5 pc in size with a mass of 3 .",

    "b97 find that the velocity structure is consistent with a steady flow with constant velocity ( cabrit  1988 ) . with this assumption",
    "the inclination of the outflow to the line - of - sight is determined to be 85 .",
    "the co excitation temperature in the line core is greatest at the outflow peaks , indicating that the ambient gas there has been heated by interactions with the outflow .    correcting for inclination , optical depth , and emission hidden within the line core , b97 determine the mass in the lobes to be @xmath01.0  ( red lobe ) and @xmath00.3  ( blue lobe ) . considering the different methods used to determine the outflow momentum @xmath7 , kinetic energy @xmath8 , and mechanical luminosity @xmath9 ( upper and lower limit methods ) b97 find @xmath10 , @xmath11km@xmath12s@xmath13 , and @xmath14 .",

    "near - infrared ( nir ) images from the aat are shown in figure  [ fig - nir ] ( bourke 2001 ) . most of the non - stellar emission is due to the emission in the  @xmath15=1 - 0s(1 ) line , most likely due to shocks in the outflowing gas ( eislffel 1997 ) .",

    "it can be seen that hh  320 ( hh  321 ) is coincident with the nir emission associated with irs  2 ( irs  1 ) .",
    "bourke ( 2001 ) has shown that irs  2 also drives a co outflow which is more compact and much less energetic than the irs  1 outflow .",
    "the northern part of the irs  2 outflow is blue - shifted ( and associated with hh  320 ) which is the opposite of the irs  1 outflow and allows them to be separated spatially .",
    "the red lobe is confused by the irs  1 outflow , though it is probably seen in the nir ( arrowed emission in fig .",
    "[ fig - nir](b ) ) .",
    "bourke ( 2001 ) suggested that irs  1 & 2 may form a binary protostellar pair ( separation @xmath03400au ) though the kinematic evidence for or against is lacking .",
    "the bhr  71 irs  1 outflow is one of a handful that show significant abundance enhancements in molecules such as sio and  ( g98 ) .",

    "the protostars irs  1 ( large star ) and irs  2 ( small star ) are indicated.,scaledwidth=85.0% ]    the spectral line profiles in the outflow and the velocity of the outflowing gas ( @xmath16 ) indicate that c - shocks dominate the flow ( g98 ) .",
    "the shocks are sufficiently strong to release molecules and atoms into the gas phase via evaporation of icy grain mantles ( e.g. , ) and sputtering of grain cores or grain - grain collisions ( e.g. , si , which rapidly forms sio ) . other molecules detected in the outflow include cs , h@xmath1co , so , hcn , hnc , hco@xmath17 with sest and h@xmath1o with swas ( bourke  2001 , in prep ) .",

    "one particularly striking feature is the spatial distribution of sio compared to co in the outflow . because sio is the result of si liberation it is usually only detected at the ends of outflows ( where the shock interaction is greatest ) or as a narrow jet along the outflow axis possibly due to interactions in a turbulent boundary layer ( garay 2000 ) .",
    "the wide - spread distribution of sio in the bhr  71 outflow is unique .",
    "this suggests that the sio enhancement takes place in a shell - like structure produced by the dynamical interaction between the ambient cloud and an underlying wide - angle wind or wind driven shell ( garay 2000 ) , or perhaps by a wandering jet .",
    "however , it has not been shown that an interaction between a wind and the ambient material can produce sufficient si for this to be a viable explanation .",
    "if sufficient si - bearing species are present in grain mantles then the wind model becomes attractive ( schilke  1997 ) .",
    "an optical composite image taken with the vlt is shown in the frontpiece of these proceedings .",
    "this image hints at the spectacular results we can expect from the vlt in the coming years .",
    "there is evidence in this image of both a wind component and a jet component to the irs  1 outflow in the blue lobe . extending from the reflection nebulosity which protrudes from the globule",
    ", one can trace out an elongated bubble , with its edges defined by enhanced extinction .",
    "this is characteristic of a wide - angle wind component .",
    "in addition , enhanced extinction is also seen along the axis of the bubble and extending beyond its southern tip .",
    "this may be an indication of the underlying jet which is probably driving this young outflow .",
    "modelling of this one image may help answer some of the remaining questions about the spectacular bhr  71 outflow ."
