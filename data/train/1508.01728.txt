    "neutron stars , which are stellar remnants of the core collapse of massive stars , give us one of the best opportunities to investigate the physics under extreme conditions .",
    "this is partly because the density of matter inside the star can become significantly larger than normal nuclear density , partly because some neutron stars are strongly magnetized while others are rapidly rotating , and partly because the gravitational fields around neutron stars are strong enough for effects of general relativity to manifest themselves .",
    "astronomical phenomena associated with neutron stars could leave imprint of the physics under such extreme conditions .",
    "the asteroseismology is a powerful technique to reveal the interiors of neutron stars via their oscillation spectra , as in the case of the seismology in the earth and the helioseismology in the sun .",
    "in fact , through detection of the frequencies of neutron star oscillations , it might be possible to deduce neutron star masses and radii , the equation of state ( eos ) of matter in the star , and so on ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "gravitational waves , if detected , could be one of the most promising sources that provide the oscillation spectra of neutron stars .",
    "alternatively , it is expected that observational evidences for neutron star oscillations have already been given as the quasi periodic oscillations ( qpos ) observed from soft gamma repeaters ( sgrs ) in the afterglow of the giant flares .",
    "up to now , at least three giant flares were observed , and various qpo frequencies were found in two of them , which radiated from sgr 1806@xmath120 and sgr 1900@xmath314 @xcite . since sgrs are considered to be magnetars , which are strongly magnetized neutron stars , the observed qpos are expected to be strongly associated with the neutron star oscillations .",
    "there are many attempts to explain these qpos theoretically , which are based on shear torsional oscillations in the crustal region of a neutron star and/or magnetic oscillations throughout the star ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "subsequently , analyses of elastic - magnetic oscillations in magnetars reveal that , depending on the magnetic field strength , the oscillations near the star s surface are excited basically by either crustal torsional oscillations or magnetic oscillations @xcite . according to observational estimates of the surface magnetic field strength of the sgrs from which the giant flares radiate @xcite , the magnetic field in the star can give rise to a restoring force , whose strength is comparable to that induced by the crustal shear modulus , and hence shear torsional oscillations and magnetic oscillations are almost indistinguishable",
    ". however , given that the highest magnetic fields are more or less localized , e.g. , in a toroidal form , it is reasonable to start with the assumption that the qpos observed in sgrs are identified as the crustal torsional oscillations .",
    "then , such an identification could tell us information about the properties of the crust , particularly the eos @xcite .",
    "one of the most important parameters characterizing the eos of neutron - rich matter in the crust is the density dependence of the nuclear symmetry energy , @xmath4 , which is strongly associated with the thickness of the region where nuclei exist as non - uniform nuclear structures @xcite .",
    "the constraint on @xmath4 can be given via the terrestrial nuclear experiments @xcite , but it is still difficult to obtain a severe constraint .",
    "on the other hand , we developed a way of constraining @xmath4 through the identification of the qpos observed in sgrs as the crustal torsional oscillations @xcite as well as through possible simultaneous mass and radius measurements of low - mass neutron stars @xcite .",
    "this is a constraint from nuclear matter at extremely large neutron excess , in contrast with the case of the terrestrial nuclear experiments associated with nuclear matter at relatively small neutron excess .",
    "recently , new qpo frequencies in sgr j1550@xmath15418 and sgr 1806@xmath120 have been reported . in sgr j1550@xmath15418",
    ", the qpo frequencies of 93 and 127 hz have been discovered from a storm of 286 bursts @xcite .",
    "in addition , the qpo frequency of 57 hz has been discovered in the shorter and less energetic recurrent 30 bursts radiating from sgr 1806@xmath120 @xcite .",
    "since the qpo of frequency 57 hz comes from the same sgr as that from which the giant flare was detected , it is important to make sure that this new qpo frequency can be explained within the framework that reproduces the low - lying qpo frequencies found in the giant flare .",
    "meanwhile , although sgr j1550@xmath15418 adds to a list of the sgrs that have the qpos detected , unfortunately the observed qpo frequencies are limited and not low enough to clearly identify the corresponding angular indices .",
    "thus , we here systematically examine how valid the crustal torsional oscillations are to explain the qpo frequencies observed in the sgrs . in order to calculate the frequencies of the crustal torsional oscillations , we adopt the shear modulus that allows for the effect of electron screening on nuclei in the crust @xcite . additionally , as the effect of neutron superfluidity on the enthalpy density of matter in the inner crust , we adopt the results for the superfluid density given by chamel @xcite , as in refs .",
    "we adopt the geometric unit of @xmath5 in this paper , where @xmath6 and @xmath7 denote the speed of light and the gravitational constant , respectively .",
    "in the vicinity of the saturation point of symmetric nuclear matter at zero temperature , the bulk energy of nuclear matter per nucleon @xmath8 can be generally expressed as a function of baryon number density @xmath9 and neutron excess @xmath10 , as in ref .",
    "@xcite : @xmath11\\alpha^2 ,    \\label{eq : w}\\ ] ] where @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath14 are the saturation energy , saturation density , and incompressibility of symmetric nuclear matter ( @xmath15 ) .",
    "in addition , @xmath16 and @xmath4 are associated with the density dependent symmetry energy @xmath17 as @xmath18 and @xmath19 .",
    "note that only @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath16 among the five parameters are well constrained from empirical data for masses and radii of stable nuclei @xcite .",
    "in describing matter in the crust of a neutron star , we follow the derivation by two of the authors ( k.o . and k.i . ) , which is based on a phenomenological approach @xcite .",
    "hereafter , we refer to the resultant phenomenological eos of matter in the crust as oi - eos .",
    "the oi - eos is constructed as follows .",
    "first , various models for the bulk energy @xmath20 of nuclear matter are made in such a way as to reproduce eq .",
    "( [ eq : w ] ) in the limit of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "then , within a simplified version of the extended thomas - fermi theory , the density profile of stable nuclei was obtained for each model for @xmath8 .",
    "finally , the optimal values of @xmath12 , @xmath13 , and @xmath16 were determined so that the charge number , mass excess , and charge radius that can be calculated from the density profile obtained for given @xmath23 and @xmath14 should fit well to the experimental data @xcite .",
    "after that , in order to obtain the equilibrium nuclear shape and size as well as the crust eos for various sets of @xmath24 and @xmath14 , we generalized the thomas - fermi model by adding dripped neutrons , a neutralizing uniform background of electrons , and the lattice energy within a wigner - seitz approximation @xcite .",
    "in the present work , as in refs .",
    "@xcite , we consider the parameters @xmath4 , @xmath14 , and @xmath24 in the range of @xmath25 mev , @xmath26 mev , and @xmath27 mev @xmath28 , which can not only reproduce the mass and radius data for stable nuclei equally well , but also effectively cover even extreme cases @xcite .",
    "the eleven parameter sets adopted in this work are the same as in table 1 in ref .",
    "@xcite .    for given mass @xmath29 and radius @xmath30 of a nonrotating neutron star",
    ", the crust configuration can be constructed by integrating the tolman - oppenheimer - volkoff equations with the above - mentioned crust eos from the star s surface inward up to the basis of the crust @xcite .",
    "this construction effectively avoids uncertainties in the core eos . in this work ,",
    "we particularly consider typical neutron star models with @xmath29 and @xmath30 in the range of @xmath31 and @xmath32 km @xmath33 km .",
    "one of the crucial properties that govern the shear oscillations is the elasticity , which is characterized by the shear modulus @xmath34 .",
    "the shear modulus in the crust is mainly determined by the lattice energy due to the coulomb interaction , which is approximately given as @xmath35 where @xmath36 , @xmath37 , and @xmath38 are the ion number density , the nuclear charge number , and the radius of a wigner - seitz cell , respectively @xcite .",
    "this formula is derived in the limit of zero temperature from monte carlo calculations averaged over all directions on the assumption that the nuclei are point particles forming the body - center cubic lattice @xcite .",
    "on the other hand , kobyakov and pethick proposed the modification of the shear modulus , where the effect of electron screening is taken into account @xcite .",
    "the modified shear modulus can be expressed as @xmath39 where the term of @xmath40 represents the effect of electron screening .",
    "that is , the shear modulus decreases due to such additional effect , which in turn leads to reduction of the frequencies of torsional oscillations @xcite .",
    "since the charge number @xmath37 also depends on @xmath4 , however , it is still unclear how the reduction of the frequencies of torsional oscillations due to the effect of electron screening depends on @xmath4 . at subnuclear densities",
    ", @xmath37 tends to decrease with @xmath4 , because the smaller symmetry energy , corresponding to larger @xmath4 , helps more protons to change into neutrons .",
    "in fact , @xmath37 decreases with @xmath4 for the oi - eos adopted in the present work , as shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : z ] .",
    "consequently , one expects that the frequencies of torsional oscillations by using the modified shear modulus [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : on ] ) ] differs little from those by using the original shear modulus [ eq .",
    "( [ eq : off ] ) ] , if @xmath4 is sufficiently large .",
    "even so , we will examine the torsional oscillations with the modified shear modulus [ eq .",

    "the result from the eos proposed by douchin & haensel @xcite is also shown with the broken line , where the corresponding value of @xmath4 is 45.9 mev . ]",
    "we proceed to calculate the fundamental frequencies of the torsional oscillations that are excited in the crust of a nonrotating neutron star of mass @xmath29 and radius @xmath30 as constructed from the crust eos of a given set of @xmath4 and @xmath14 in the previous section . in particular , we adopt the relativistic cowling approximation to calculate the frequencies .",
    "that is , we neglect the metric perturbations and keep them zero during the oscillations .",
    "this is presumably a good approximation for considering the torsional oscillations , because they are axial parity oscillations , which do not involve the density perturbations .",
    "the perturbation equation for the torsional oscillations can be obtained from the linearized relativistic equation of motion @xcite .",
    "then , imposing the appropriate boundary conditions at the top and bottom of the crust , the problem to solve reduces to the eigenvalue problem , where the eigenvalues correspond to the eigen - frequencies of the torsional oscillations .",
    "the perturbation equation and the boundary conditions are explicitly described in ref .",
    "@xcite ; pasta nuclei , if present , are assumed to have zero shear modulus .",
    "additionally , the effect of dripped neutrons should be taken into account for the calculation of the frequencies of the torsional oscillations .",
    "in fact , neutrons are generally considered to drip out of nuclei when the density becomes higher than @xmath45 g/@xmath46 , and some of them behave as a superfluid .",
    "unfortunately , it is still unclear how many dripped neutrons behave as such , but most of them can move together with the nuclei because of the entrainment effects @xcite .",
    "in fact , according to the results from the band calculations in ref .",
    "@xcite , only of the order of @xmath47 % of the dripped neutrons can participate in superfluidity at @xmath48 . through the enthalpy density ,",
    "the frequencies of the torsional oscillations depends strongly on this ratio @xcite ; we adopt the results by chamel @xcite in the present work .",
    "then , we calculate the frequencies based on the prescription how to build the effect of superfluidity into the perturbation equations shown in ref .",

    "the calculated frequencies are plotted as a function of @xmath4 for various values of @xmath14 in fig .",
    "[ fig:0t2 ] .",
    "note that the shear torsional oscillations are often referred to as @xmath52-modes , which are labelled as @xmath53 with the angular index @xmath2 and the number @xmath54 of radial nodes in the eigenfunction . from this figure",
