    "the discovery of the 125 gev standard model higgs boson , and lack of confirmation of any new physical state in the lhc experiments makes it important to search for possible hints of a possible extension , based on the sm itself .",
    "one of such possibilities is the investigation of the standard model effective potential , which has already been the subject of considerable activity @xcite .",
    "inclusion of renormalisation group improvement in the standard model effective potential reveals an interesting structure at very large field strengths .",
    "namely a maximum near @xmath1 gev and a new minimum at superplanckian field strength .",
    "the implications depend critically on the value of the measured sm parameters , most importantly the higgs quartic coupling and the top quark yukawa coupling . for the central value of top and higgs masses",
    "the physical electroweak symmetry breaking minimum turns out to be metastable with respect to the tunnelling to the deeper minimum at superplanckian value of the higgs field .",
    "this means that the computed lifetime of the sm vacuum is larger than the estimated age of the universe , and no modification is required to avoid conflict with observations .",
    "however the instability border in the parameter space of @xmath2 masses , lays uncomfortably close , which means that this result is rather sensitive to modifications brought in by any extension of the sm .",
    "it is crucial to note , that the whole effect of instability comes from the radiative corrections to the effective action .",
    "this means that in the first derivative of the potential with respect to the field , contributions from various radiative corrections cancel against each other and against the tree - level contributions to create additional critical points , not present at tree level .",
    "this makes the whole effect particularly interesting and particularly sensitive to new physics , which may appear in the effective action through radiative corrections .",
    "a question which becomes relevant in the context of large radiative corrections is the question about gauge independence of observable quantities such as the lifetime of the electroweak vacuum",
    ".    another important question concerns stability of the sm vacuum after inclusion of ultraviolet completions at or below the planck scale .",
    "this can problem be studied in the spirit of the effective field theory . in @xcite",
    "the neutral higgs field potential was extended with higher order operators suppressed by suitable powers of the planck mass .",
    "it was shown that for sensible values of the couplinge electroweak vacuum can be destabilised .",
    "in @xcite we studied this issue further showing allowed values of the new operators and justifying many approximations used in computation of the lifetime .    here",
    "we study these issues further , from the point of view of the requirement of gauge and scale independence of physical results such as the decay rate .",
    "the complete discussion within the sm is rather prohibitive at this point , however , one can learn a lot by studying in detail a simple yet nontrivial example of the abelian higgs model . towards the end of this paper",
    "we will draw conclusions which can be extended to more general , sm - like models with additional nonrenormalisable operators .",
    "gauge fixing independence of the observables , i.e. s - matrix elements and physical masses , is in principle a mathematical fact and must hold in any consistent gauge theory .",
    "this should also be the case for the life - time of a metastable vacuum - like state .",
    "given nielsen identities one can prove that the full effective action @xmath3 $ ] for a configuration of the mean field @xmath4 which solves the equation of motion @xmath5 stays invariant with respect to the variation of gauge fixing parameters in covariant gauges , see for instance @xcite,@xcite .",
    "this is a crucial step and one can accept that this shows that at the formal level the vacuum lifetime is gauge invariant .",
    "however , in practice one needs to resort to a perturbative calculation of the effective action and to a quasi - classical determination of the decay rate following classic formulae by callan and coleman , and it is a challenge to perform the calculation in such a way that the result stays gauge fixing independent to a given order in the perturbative expansion . in particular , the silent assumption is that to calculate the decay rate one should use the renormalised effective action , which is finite . at the same time",
    "the formal proofs are usually performed at the level of unrenormalised , formal , expressions , see @xcite . in this note",
    "we shall try to be as explicit as possible in performing the gauge independent calculation at the level of the renormalised abelian higgs model .",
    "we shall consider the renormalised 1-loop effective action to the order @xmath6 in the gauge coupling and check explicitly various assertions and expectations .",
    "as usual , we shall be concerned with the exponential dependence of the lifetime on the effective action for the relevant solution of the eoms .",
    "in fact , the gauge dependence of the quasi - classical determinat is rather complicated and the proof that it is gauge fixing independent , as it should be , poses a nontrivial challenge , see @xcite . in the proof of gauge fixing invariance the central role",
    "is played by nielsen identities , which read @xmath7}{\\partial \\alpha } = \\int d^4 x \\frac{\\delta \\gamma}{\\delta \\phi_j ( x ) } h^{\\alpha}_j ( \\phi , x),\\ ] ] where @xmath8 is a gauge fixing parameter .",
    "the nonlocal expression @xmath9 may be expanded in derivatives , see @xcite , @xmath10 the coefficients in the expansion of the functional @xmath11 can be computed perturbatively .",
    "one possible expansion is in the powers of @xmath12 - the usual loop expansion .",
    "however , in the case of our prime interest , that is in the case of the standard model , the nontrivial vacua at large field strength are generated radiatively and their existence results from a delicate balance between the tree level quartic term and higher order corrections .",
    "this relies on the approximate relation @xmath13 , where @xmath14 is a gauge coupling or a top yukawa coupling .",
    "this relation should be taken into account when performing the perturbative expansion , since , for instance , there exist contributions of the order @xmath6 at the level of 1 loop and also at the level of 2 loops .",
    "hence , numerically the 2-loop diagrams at the order @xmath6 , or higher - loop effects at higher orders could be in principle as important as the lower - loop ones . of course , this phenomenon depends on a model in question .",
    "firstly , each additional loop is suppressed by an additional numerical factor of @xmath15 .",
    "secondly , the couplings run with energy and the basic relation @xmath13 could be modified .",
    "consider a renormalisable @xmath16 gauge theory of a single scalar matter field .",
    "we write the lagrangian , @xmath17 , for one gauge field @xmath18 and two real components of a complex scalar field @xmath19 , @xmath20 .",
    "a two - parameter ( quasi ) thooft gauge fixing is employed in @xmath21 .",
    "specifically the dimensionfull parameter @xmath22 is nonzero and its presence breaks the global gauge symmetry .",
    "the @xmath22 is coupled in @xmath21 to the scalar field along the @xmath23 direction , perpendicular to the @xmath24 direction along which we wish to study the quantum corrections .",
    "this is no accident and it constitutes a major simplification . the complete lagrangian takes the form @xmath25a^\\mu + z_{\\varphi}\\ , \\frac{g^2}{2 } \\varphi_i \\varphi_i a_\\mu a^\\mu - z_{\\lambda}\\,\\frac{\\lambda}{4 ! } ( \\varphi_i \\varphi_i)^2 + \\ , { \\mathcal{l}}_{\\text{ct } } \\label{lagr}\\\\ { \\mathcal{l}}_{\\text{ct}}&=\\frac{1}{2 } ( z_{\\varphi } - 1 ) \\partial_{\\mu } \\varphi_i \\ , \\partial^{\\mu } \\varphi_i -   \\frac{1}{2}(z_{m^2 } - 1 ) m^2   \\varphi_i \\varphi_i - \\frac{1}{4 } ( z_{a } - 1 ) f_{\\mu \\nu}f^{\\mu \\nu}\\\\ { \\mathcal{l}}_{\\text{gf } } & = - \\frac{1}{2 \\xi}(\\partial_\\mu a^\\mu + g\\,v \\varphi_2)^2 \\\\ { \\mathcal{l}}_{\\psi } & = \\partial_{\\mu } \\psi^\\ast\\ , \\partial^{\\mu } \\psi + g\\ , v \\varphi_1\\ , \\psi^\\ast \\psi \\ , .",

    "normalisation of the @xmath30 parameter along with the form of @xmath21 are chosen such that the kinetic term of @xmath31 is canonical but the gauge coupling @xmath14 in second power appears in front of the @xmath32 term .",
    "the @xmath33 and @xmath22 are gauge parameters only and as such their values are in principle irrelevant for physical predictions .",
    "the fact that one is usually confined to perturbative calculations puts practical limitations on that arbitrariness",
    ". some intermediate results , which , although nonphysical , are rather desirable ( for instance green functions ) may not exist in a finite form in a particular renormalisation scheme and for a particular choice of values for @xmath34 and @xmath22 . secondly ,",
    "since @xmath34 and @xmath22 appear in feynman rules , one is forced to assign to them an order in the coupling constant which governs the perturbative expansion .",
    "for example , in these notes we assume both @xmath33 and @xmath22 to be formally of order zero in @xmath14 , which is different from @xmath35 and @xmath36 that we assume to be of order @xmath37 .",
    "we will yet comment on these issues , as we encounter them later .",
    "lastly , in case one wishes to shift the field , @xmath38 , it is not an uncommon practice to choose the value of @xmath22 in such a way that the bilinear terms mixing the @xmath18 and @xmath23 fields cancel at the tree level ( up to a full derivative ) .",
    "this would correspond to assigning @xmath39 .",
    "the constant @xmath40 could in turn be , say , a minimum of a tree level potential expressed in terms of scalar couplings .",
    "we do not follow that rationale in these notes , since we wish to study the @xmath22-independence and possibly use it as a correctness check .",
    "and yet we do need to shift the field , @xmath41 .",
    "the reason behind it is that the @xmath42 , aside from being a free , nonphysical parameter , has to get renormalised to counter the loop divergences .",
    "the @xmath43 above contains all but one counterterms .",

    "the primed determinant is understood to have the zero - modes omitted .",

    "operators with higher ( than two ) derivatives do not need new counterterms when computed on @xmath220 ( see for instance @xcite ) .",
    "the fact that the jacobian contains simply the action of the bounce computed with the lowest order action is related to the canonical normalisation of the kinetic term .",
    "in fact , this happens to be the normalisation of the zero mode at the tree level in such a case .",
    "if the kinetic term in the action becomes more complicated , say @xmath221 , one should define the canonically normalized field according to @xmath222 , which leads to a more complicated form of the scalar potential and mixes the orders of the expansion in @xmath14 .",
    "generalization of the expression ( [ decayratewpf ] ) to the case of higher order corrections needs some care .",
    "first of all , in the case of radiative breaking already the tree - level parameters in the potential , @xmath35 and @xmath36 , are numerically of the order @xmath37 .",
    "first corrections are of the order @xmath6 in the scalar potential and order @xmath100 in the kinetic part , @xmath223 . however , due to nielsen identities the @xmath100 corrections are related to the @xmath6 corrections to the potential , hence it is consistent to derive the leading - order bounce configuration with the canonical kinetic term , @xmath224 , and order @xmath37 scalar potential . since we are dealing with the stationary configuration , we shall not need to know the next correction to the bounce if we compute the tunnelling rate to the order @xmath6 only .",

    "given a more complicated model like the sm , one resorts to 1-loop calcultions of the determinant or to an educated parametrization of the prefactor , as discussed later in the paper .",
    "one should note , that truncation of the action at the level of second derivatives is not well justified in the case of inhomogeneous bounce background .",
    "this issue has been mentioned briefly in @xcite and needs further study .",
    "there are two interesting technical questions which appear here in the context of the radiatively corrected effective action .",
    "we are discussing an explicit example of a model with two gauge fixing parameters , one of which is dimensionful .",
    "gauge fixing parameters are unphysical , completely absent from observables at each and every level of a perturbative calculation .",
    "the same is true of the renormalisation scale @xmath103 .",
    "thus we have two gauge fixing parameters which can in principle mix with each other and two dimensionful scales which parametrize radiative corrections .",
    "hence , it is legitimate to ask the following questions .",
    "firstly , whether arbitrary reparametrization @xmath227 leaves invariant the effective action for the bounce solution and secondly , how well the renormalization group improvement works in the presence of the second , in addition to @xmath103 , dimensionful parameter in the action .",
    "we shall discuss these issues below in some detail .",
    "in the remaining part of this section we will omit the @xmath106 subscript in @xmath139 and @xmath140 for brevity .",
    "say we a have a new favorite pair @xmath228 , so that @xmath229 for example @xmath230 and @xmath231 .",
    "next we try to mimick the nielsen identities , , but for the new parameters @xmath232 and similarly for derivatives wrt @xmath22 .",
    "thus we consistently obtain new , equally good @xmath127-functions @xmath233 as a conclusion , the switch to @xmath228 does not spoil the nielsen identities .",
    "hence , the action of the bounce stays invariant under such reparametrization . at this point",
    "one can make an additional observation , that our @xmath127 functions , , satisfy @xmath234 and this property is preserved by reparametrisation .",
    "we could again perform a brute force check .",
    "but this property , just as , follows immediately from what we already know .",
    "namely that @xmath235 is proportional to the derivative @xmath236 . hence is simply an example of a chain rule in differentiation and expresses the symmetry of a mixed double derivative . but those properties hold irrespective of which coordinate system is used .      without going into a deep theoretical discussion of the implications of the presence of the second dimensionful parameter",
    ", we shall use the example worked out in this paper to see whether the correct effective action can be reconstructed with the help of the rge improvement .",
    "let us assume that we have got only the tree level lagrangian ( corrected up to the @xmath237 for consistency ) , that we wish to `` rge - improve '' with higher order corrections obtained only through the renormalisation group equations .",

    "let us go back to the potential , @xmath248 unfortunately there is no way to get all the nominators under the logatithms right with just a single ansatz for @xmath249 .",
    "but one could go a long way towards reproducing the proper form of the correction , if he could justify a following prescription : inside terms that vanish in the limit @xmath250 , substitute @xmath251 and inside any other terms @xmath252    even so , terms build from two different logarithms , like @xmath253 , would require carefull analysis to realise which logarithm originates from lower level correction .",

    "the next step is to use this solution by reinterpreting this classical lagrangian as an effective quantum lagrangian of the higgs field and simply using the well known decay rate formula which now takes the form @xmath258 due to the classical scale invariance present in the simple classical lagrangian , one has no dimensionfull quantity to fill in above .",
    "this problem can solved due to quantum corrections since even in the lowest order of perturbative calculation our actual lagrangian reads @xmath259 where @xmath260 denotes the running of the higgs field due to a nonzero anomalous dimension , while @xmath261 is the running higgs quartic coupling .",
    "naively using thus obtained quartic coupling in results in the following tunnelling rate @xmath262 now we can chose the scale @xmath263 to minimize the value of @xmath264 which corresponds to a lower bound on the lifetime @xmath265 we also approximated the four - volume of our past lightcone simply by fourth power of the age of the universe which allowed us to integrate and switch from the decay rate to the lifetime . this is a fair approximation since neglecting order one factors in front of the exponential function introduces an error much smaller than the uncertainty of the exponent .",
    "requiring gauge invariance of our results clearly shows a problem with this simple approximation .",
    "while @xmath261 does not depend on gauge fixing the sm anomalous dimension is gauge - dependent @xcite , thus making very sensitive to the values of gauge fixing parameters .    to improve this result",
    "we first notice that the full coefficients in front of the quartic and kinetic terms are dimensionless , and due to the absence any dimensionfull parameters in the theory , they have to depend on @xmath103 only via @xmath266 .",
    "secondly , running of @xmath267 and @xmath268 fully captures the dependence of these coefficients on @xmath103 , which means that it cancels between explicit dependence in loop corrections and running of the couplings . in conclusion ,",
    "to improve the accuracy of our approximation at any field value we can replace the scale with the value of the field , @xmath269 , and the resulting @xmath103-independent function of @xmath270 will be a good approximation of the full effective quantum lagrangian .",
    "this leads to @xmath271 the above lagrangian suggests that it makes sense to redefine the field variable by @xmath272 , which completely eliminates the field renormalisation @xmath273 .",
    "this brings us to the point : the @xmath274 in should simply be replaced by @xmath275 alone , @xmath276 where the absence of @xmath267 trivially makes the result gauge - independent .",
    "this approach is connected with the treatment of abelian gauge theory we discussed in the previous sections , where it was shown that for formal consistency , including quantum corrections to the kinetic term is crucial .",
    "it is important to stress that replacing @xmath103 with @xmath270 requires treating also @xmath270 in @xmath277 , as a spacetime dependent configuration , and thus hitting @xmath278 with the derivative @xmath279 .    in the standard model , difference between and",
    "is very significant .",
    "the @xmath280 changes from @xmath281 at the scale of the top mass , @xmath282 , to about @xmath283 close to the planck mass , when computed in landau gauge .",
    "this dependence ends up in the exponent of increasing it from roughly @xmath284 to @xmath285 . as a result",
    "the lifetime of the electroweak vacuum compared to the lifetime of the universe , computed via is around @xmath286 while properly using gives @xmath287 .",
    "figure [ sodxi ] illustrates gauge dependence of the action , using the simplest class of gauge fixing , the so called fermi gauges , with @xmath288 .",
    "landau gauge is an example of this class as an rge - stable choice of @xmath289 . thus incorrectly including the field renormalisation in the sm , even in landau gauge results in a large overestimation of the expected lifetime .     only in the potential . dashed line : the action calculated after the redefinition @xmath290 .",
    "@xmath33 is a gauge fixing parameter . ]",
    "now we turn to the possible nonrenormalizable terms in scalar potential , e.g. @xmath291 in our simplified approach the effective contribution of this term reads @xmath292 with @xmath293 contributing to rge s of other couplings . however , it does not appear in @xmath294 at one loop . again , since running of @xmath295 does not depend on the gauge fixing , absorbing the field renormalisation into redefinition of the field , we end up without any gauge dependence .",
    "there is another important point to be made about gauge dependence of nonrenormalizable terms in the potential , which was detailed in earlier sections in the case of the simple abelian model .",
    "nielsen identities bind variation of the effective action to its derivative with respect to gauge parameters @xcite . taking momentum independent part of this relation ( which means going from effective action to effective potential ) ,",
    "one arrives at @xmath296 the function @xmath127 admits a perturbative expansion , like other parts of the equation .",
    "however then it inherently involves ghost , goldstone and gauge propagators @xcite . as a result vertices produced by nonrenormalizable operators , like the six - legged @xmath293",
    ", do not contribute to @xmath127 at the lowest levels of the expansion .",
    "when we classify terms on the left and right hand side of by their power of @xmath297 , we see immediately that the same @xmath127 function separately governs gauge dependence of both renormalizable and nonrenormalizable part of the potential with any dimension . as a result , for practical purposes ,",
    "it is enough to uncover gauge dependence of the renormalizable part of the lagrangian , to be able fully reconstruct it for all operators including those of higher dimension .",
    "finally , let us pause to comment on the validity of the `` radiative '' expansion based on the relation @xmath13 in case of the sm .",
    "the relation between couplings which holds in the sm at the 1-loop order at the critical points of the effective potential reads @xmath298 .\\ ] ] the running of the quartic coupling @xmath35 vs running of the right hand side of the formula is shown in figure  [ lvsrhs ] .",
    "the points where the curves meet , mark the radiatively generated extrema of the effective potential .",
    "the first from the left is the maximum and the second is the global minimum . in general",
    "this relation between couplings which holds at the extrema is violated , and the region where the violation is significant also contributes to the action of the bounce .",
    "additionally , for the inhomogenous bounce solution the momentum expansion becomes problematic and the real role of the prefactor is somewhat obscure , since some corrections are already taken into account in the effective action .    perhaps playing with numerical values of various contributions could lead to identification of the best approximation to the complete expression , but in practice considerations based on global measures like the one given in the expression ( [ amount ] ) could be useful .",
    "vs running of the right hand side of the formula ( [ rhs ] ) .",
    "the points where the curves meet mark the radiatively generated extrema of the sm effective potential - first from the left is the maximum and the second is the stable minimum . in general",
    "the relation between couplings which holds at the extrema becomes violated , and the region where the violation is significant contributes to the action of the bounce . ]",
    "in this paper we have investigated at the perturbative level the gauge fixing independence of the tunneling rate to a stable radiatively induced vacuum in the abelian higgs model in a class of @xmath0 gauges , in the presence of both dimensionless and dimensionful gauge fixing parameters .",
    "we performed explicit calculations in the spirit of improved perturbative expansion which assumes the quartic coupling , and the tree - level mass parameter , to be of the order of the fourth power of the gauge coupling .",
    "we also explicitly showed gauge fixing independence of the tunnelling rate , depth of the extrema and the value of the physical pole mass .",
    "we also proved that nielsen identities survive the inclusion of higher order operators .",
    "we also discussed the applicability of these results to the standard model .",
    "unfortunately , finding the appropriate improved expansion scheme in the sm does nt seem to be practically feasible at the next to leading order of radiative corrections , but it is important to understand reasons for the presence of the gauge - fixing non - invariance of numerical calculations and this is the aim of the present paper .",
    "we have discussed the independence of the bounce action with respect to reparametrisation of the gauge fixing .",
    "the presence of the dimensionful gauge fixing parameter introduces a second mass scale into the rg running , which makes the rge improvement procedure for the effective action less useful .",
