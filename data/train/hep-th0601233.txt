    "<S> amoebas and the ronkin functions play intermediary roles between the limit shape and the hyperelliptic curve . in particular , the ronkin function realizes an integration of thermodynamical density of the main diagonal partitions , along one - dimensional slice of it and thereby is interpreted as the counting function of gauge instantons . </S>",
    "<S> the radius of @xmath3 can be identified with the inverse temperature of the statistical model . </S>",
    "<S> the large radius limit of the five - dimensional yang - mills is the low temperature limit of the statistical model , where the statistical model is frozen to a ground state that is associated with the local @xmath1 geometry . </S>",
