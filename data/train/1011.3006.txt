    "nearby galaxies are unique laboratories for investigating the processes that drive galaxy evolution .",
    "the information obtained from the photometric and spectroscopic analyses of individual stars can be employed to probe the history of nearby galaxies to a level of detail that is not possible for distant systems , where stellar content studies are limited to information gleaned from the analysis of integrated light .",
    "star counts also provide a means of tracing structures to lower densities than is possible with integrated light , thereby allowing diffuse tidal debris trails and low surface brightness companions , both of which provide clues into the past history of a galaxy , to be identified and characterized .",
    "the majority of large galaxies within @xmath7 mpc are disk - dominated , and studies of their resolved stellar contents reveal considerable diversity in recent star - forming histories .",
    "galaxies such as m31 ( williams 2002 ) and ngc 5102 ( davidge 2008a ; 2010 ) have depressed star formation rates ( sfrs ) at the present day when compared with @xmath8 gyr in the past .",
    "in contrast , a number of nearby galaxies , such as m82 , ngc 5253 , ngc 253 , and m83 , have elevated levels of central star - forming activity . that a number of nearby galaxies are experiencing elevated levels of star - forming activity",
    "indicates that this is not a rare phenomenon in the local universe , and starbursts account for at least 20% of all recent local star formation ( brinchmann et al .",
    "2004 ; lee et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "there is a compelling association between elevated sfrs and galaxy - galaxy interactions ( e.g. larson & tinsley 1978 ; iono et al .",
    "2004 ; kewley et al .",
    "this suggests that tidal effects are the primary cause of starbursts , at least among massive galaxies , although interactions with intergalactic material can also trigger elevated star - forming activity ( e.g. kapferer et al . 2009 ) .",
    "it is thus worth noting that some of the nearest starburst or post - starburst galaxies do not have obvious companions or are not located in environments that are thought to contain a dense intergalactic medium , leaving no obvious trigger for the starburst activity .",
    "two such examples are ngc 5102 and ngc 253 .",
    "the former galaxy was investigated by davidge ( 2008c ) , while the latter is the subject of this paper .",
    "ngc 253 is the largest member of the filamentary collection of galaxies that is classically referred to as the sculptor group . with a crossing time of 6  7 gyr ( karachensev 2005 )",
    ", the group is not dynamically relaxed , and interactions between its dominant members are likely rare .",
    "still , ngc 253 has not evolved in isolation .",
    "the spin of the ngc 253 disk is consistent with torquing from ngc 247 ( whiting 1999 ) , which  at a projected distance of @xmath9 kpc from ngc 253  is its closest large companion .",
    "extragalactic hi , which is a possible signature of an interaction that affected the disk of one or both galaxies , has not been detected in the vicinity of ngc 253 and ngc 247 ( putman et al .",
    "2003 ) , although neutral hydrogen may be ionized by background radiation at large distances from galaxies ( e.g. westmeier , bruns , & kerp 2008 ) .    despite its isolated location",
    ", kinematic studies suggest that ngc 253 was involved in a recent merger .",
    "anantharamaiah & goss ( 1996 ) and prada et al . (",
    "1998 ) find evidence of two kinematically distinct systems near the center of ngc 253 .",
    "one system has an axis of rotation that differs from that of the galaxy disk , while the other appears to be counter - rotating with respect to the galaxy disk .",
    "das et al .",
    "( 2001 ) model the kinematics of material near the center of ngc 253 and detect twisting in the velocity field @xmath10 arcsec from the nucleus .",
    "all three studies interpret their results as kinematic signatures of a merger .",
    "das et al .",
    "( 2001 ) estimate that the merger may have involved the accretion of @xmath11 m@xmath12 of material @xmath13 years in the past , and they point out that this may be the remnants of what was initially a much larger object .",
    "much of the literature on ngc 253 deals with the central regions of the galaxy and the superwind .",
    "rieke & low ( 1975 ) first noted that the photometric properties of the central regions of the galaxy were consistent with a transient level of elevated star formation , and the presence of a large central young population was confirmed with the discovery that the near - infrared light is dominated by red supergiants ( rsgs ; rieke et al .",
    "rieke et al .",
    "( 1988 ) suggest that ngc 253 may be in an earlier phase of starburst activity than m82 , thereby making it a potentially important object for understanding the early phases of starburst evolution .",
    "the central velocity field defined by co emission in ngc 253 is indicative of a bar , which is likely a conduit for material that feeds the central starburst ( paglione et al .",
    "the present - day sfr of ngc 253 is 5 m@xmath12 year@xmath14 ( melo et al .",
    "2002 ) , and the sne rate is 0.2 year@xmath14 ( pietsch et al . 2001 ) .",
    "engelbracht et al .",
    "( 1998 ) estimate that this level of nuclear star formation has been on - going for 20  30 myr , although the sfr may have declined during the past 5 myr .",
    "starburst activity has almost certainly occured for a much longer time than calculated by engelbracht et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , as star - forming activity in starbursts appears to be variable in both time and location ( e.g. forster schreiber et al .",
    "2003 ; mcquinn et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "ngc 253 is interacting with its immediate surroundings .",
    "the extraplanar regions near the minor axis of ngc 253 are populated by a mix of hot gas , cool gas , and dust , and heckman et al .",
    "( 1990 ) estimate that 1.2 m@xmath12 year@xmath14 is ejected from the central regions . as in the m82 outflow , x - ray and",
    "h@xmath15 emission in the ngc 253 outflow occurs in close proximity .",
    "the x - ray and h@xmath15 emission likely originates in a boundary environment where the superwind interacts with a dense cloud of cool material ( e.g. mccarthy et al .",
    "1987 ; strickland et al .",
    "the cool material is presumably tidal in origin , although it could also be remnant natal gas .",
    "there is prominent extraplanar uv emission , and hoopes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) suggest that this is light from the starburst that is reflected by dust .",
    "beck et al . ( 1982 ) and malin & hadley ( 1997 ) detect diffuse extraplanar light from ngc 253 at visible wavelengths , and some of this light may be emission from the outflow .    gas and dust in ngc 253 are centrally concentrated .",
    "interstellar material accounts for 7% of the mass near the center of ngc 253 , but only 4% of the mass at larger radii ( scoville et al .",
    "the radial distribution of molecular material in ngc 253 is a factor of 2 more concentrated than in other nearby galaxies ( sorai et al . 2000 ) , and there is also a central hi concentration ( combes et al . 1977 ) .",
    "a large reservoir of molecular material is found in a star - forming ring that is 2 kpc from the nucleus ( sorai et al .",
    "2000 ) , and the spiral structure of ngc 253 appears to eminate from this structure ( hoopes et al . 1996 ) .    while most spiral galaxies have hi envelopes that extend well past the optical limits of the disk , puche et al .",
    "( 1991 ) and boomsma et al .",
    "( 1995 ) find that the hi disk in ngc 253 extends to only @xmath16 the holmberg radius .",
    "in addition , the hi distribution in the disk is not symmetric , in the sense that hi in the south west quadrant extends to larger radii than in the north east quadrant ( boomsma et al . 2005 ) . as noted by boomsma et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , the lack of hi emission at large radii may not signal an absence of gas in the outer disk ; rather , any hi may be ionized if the disk is warped at large radii , such that the gas is exposed to radiation from the nucleus .",
    "tidal effects could also induce a truncated hi distribution , and it is intriguing that the closest large neighbor of ngc 253 , ngc 247 , also has a relatively compact hi distribution ( carignan & puche 1990 ) .",
    "the elevated levels of star - forming activity in ngc 253 have not been restricted to the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "the ngc 253 disk contains numerous filamentary and bubble - like structures that are signatures of a high sfr , and such structures may provide outlets for interstellar material to escape from the disk ( sofue et al .",
    "in fact , boomsma et al .",
    "( 2005 ) detect diffuse extraplanar hi in the eastern half of ngc 253 .",
    "the hi is detected out to distances of 12 kpc from the disk plane , and the extraplanar component accounts for 3% of the total hi mass of ngc 253 .",
    "as one of the nearest starburst galaxies , ngc 253 is a prime target for stellar content studies , although only a modest number of investigations of its resolved stellar content have been published to date .",
    "the luminosity distribution of x - ray sources in the ngc 253 disk is similar to that in m33 and m31 , and this is suggestive of a common source population , with the caveat that the overlap between the ngc 253 and local group lfs is modest ( vogler & pietsch 1999 ) .",

    "( 1991 ) discuss deep multicolor observations of a field along the north east major axis of the disk .",
    "a distance modulus of 27 was computed based on the properties of the detected rsgs and blue supergiants ( bsgs ) .",

    "there is also a bright main sequence in the karachentsev et al .",
    "cmd , which has a width of @xmath17 mag in @xmath18 .",
    "this dispersion exemplifies the extent of differential reddening in the ngc 253 disk .",
    "ngc 253 was imaged as part of the angst survey ( dalcanton et al .",
    "2009 ) . in accordance with the survey guidelines ,",
    "the fields observed in ngc 253 were restricted to the major axis , and cover roughly one half of the disk .",
    "while there is a single major axis field at moderately large distance from the galaxy center , the angst data do not sample the extraplanar regions of the galaxy .",
    "the main sequence in some of the angst cmds of ngc 253 has a width of 1 - 1.5 mag in f475w ",
    "f814w , highlighting the influence of differential reddening in photometric studies of the galaxy at visible wavelengths .",
    "in fact , an inspection of the cmds in figures 9  22 of dalcanton et al .",
    "( 2009 ) indicates that the extent of differential extinction in ngc 253 exceeds that in other galaxies in the angst sample .    as with the disk ,",
    "there have been only a modest number of studies of resolved stars in the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 . in the first deep ccd study of resolved stars in ngc 253 ,",
    "davidge & pritchet ( 1990 ) observed a field along the north west arm of the minor axis .",
    "the completeness - corrected cmd shown in their figure 8 includes the upper portions of the rgb , and there is a break near @xmath19 in their cmd that corresponds to the rgb - tip found in subsequent studies . assuming a stellar content like that in the outer regions of m31 , a distance modulus of 26.8 was computed from the brightest star .",
    "this places ngc 253 much closer than more recent distance estimates ( e.g. karachentsev et al .",
    "2003 ; mouhcine et al .",
    "2005 ) - a result that may be explained if this part of ngc 253 contains a young population ( e.g. comeron et al .",

    "( 2001 ) suggest that the stars that are furthest from the disk plane must have formed in the outflow ; a similar conclusion was reached independently for young stars in the extraplanar regions of m82 ( davidge 2008c ) .",
    "mouhcine ( 2005 ) discusses deeper observations of a portion of the area surveyed by comeron et al .",
    "a population of rgb stars was detected , from which a distance modulus of 27.6 was deduced based on the rgb - tip brightness . with the caveat that young and intermediate age stars may bias the distance estimate and skew the shape of the rgb , the photometrically derived metallicity distribution function ( mdf ) of rgb stars in this field peaks near [ m / h ] = 0.7 , with a metal - poor tail that extends to 2 ( mouhcine 2006 ) .",
    "such an mdf is not characteristic of a classical old , metal - poor halo .",
    "rather , this mdf is reminsiscent of that seen throughout much of m31 ( e.g. bellazzini et al .",
    "2003 ; koch et al . 2008",
    "; richardson et al . 2009 ; tanaka et al . 2010 ) , which is a galaxy that has experienced interactions with its satellites ( e.g. ibata et al .",
    "2007 ) .",
    "dust has a major influence on the appearance of ngc 253 ( sofue et al .",
    "1994 ) , and at least 90% of the h@xmath15 flux from the galaxy is obscured ( hoopes et al . 1996 ) .",
    "the dust is widespread , and the disk contains 94% of the total cool dust supply ( melo et al .",
    "the emission from cool dust has a scale length that is similar to ( melo et al .",
    "2002 ) or possibly even larger than ( radovich et al 2001 ) that of the stellar light .",
    "the high dust content of the ngc 253 disk provides a compelling motivation to survey its stellar content at wavelengths longward of @xmath20 m , where the impact of extinction is greatly reduced with respect to visible wavelengths .",
    "the impact of line blanketing on the photometric properties of the reddest stars , such as those that are evolving near the asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) tip , is also greatly reduced in the infrared when compared with the visible .",
    "this enhances the utility of these objects as probes of stellar content , as it increases the contrast between the brightest red stars and the underlying blue body of the disk , thereby reducing the affect of crowding .    in the present paper , near - infrared observations of three @xmath21 arcmin fields , recorded with the cfht wircam ,",
    "are used to map the projected distribution of the brightest red stars in the disk and extraplanar regions of ngc 253 .",
    "the data , the basic reduction procedures , and the photometric measurements are described in  2 , while the spatial distribution of various stellar types are described in  3 .",
    "the properties of the brightest red stars in the disk plane and extrapalanar regions are examined in  4 and  5 , respectively .",
    "a summary and discussion of the results follows in  6 .",
    "the discovery of an extended halo around ngc 253 at ultraviolet ( uv ) wavelengths , which is distinct from the starburst outflow and appears to be due to an intermediate age extraplanar component (  5 ) , is reported in the appendix .",
    "the data were recorded with wircam ( puget et al .",
    "2004 ) on the canada - france - hawaii telescope ( cfht ) as part of the 2007b observing queue .",
    "the wircam detector is a mosaic of four @xmath22 hgcdte arrays that are deployed in a @xmath23 format .",
    "there is a 45 arcsec gap between detectors , and each pixel subtends @xmath24 arcsec@xmath25 .",
    "thus , a single exposure covers @xmath26 arcmin@xmath25 .",
    "three fields , that sample the major axis of ngc 253 at both ends of the disk ( fields 1 and 2 ) and the south east segment of the minor axis ( field 3 ) , were observed through @xmath27 and @xmath28 filters .",
    "the central co - ordinates of these fields are listed in table 1 .",
    "the locations of the fields on the sky are indicated in figure 1 .",
    "the positioning of fields 1 and 2 avoids the innermost regions of the galaxy , where resolving stars is problematic ; hence , the main body of ngc 253 is not imaged in its entirety .    a five point dither pattern , defining a @xmath29 arcsec square on the sky with a central point ,",
    "was employed to facilitate the identification and the suppression of bad pixels and cosmic rays .",
    "a dither pattern with a substantially larger throw could have been used to fill the gaps between detectors .",
    "however , it was decided not to dither over large angular scales since a goal of this study is to assess the distribution of stars in the outer regions of ngc 253 , and large dither offsets would lower the maximum distance that would be sampled with full data coverage . while the gaps between detectors are cosmetically unappealing , they do not hinder the ability to chart large scale trends in the stellar distribution .",
    "four 20 sec exposures were obtained per filter at each dither position .",
    "the dither pattern was repeated 7 times in @xmath27 and 14 times in @xmath28 for each field .",
    "the total exposure time per field is thus 2800 sec in @xmath27 and 5600 sec in @xmath28 .",
    "the data were reduced using standard techniques for near - infrared imaging .",
    "the initial processing , which was done with the iiwi pipeline at the cfht , consisted of dark subtraction and flat - fielding . a calibration frame to remove interference fringes and the thermal signatures of warm objects along the light path was constructed by combining the iiwi - processed images of the three fields .",
    "a mean sky level was subtracted from each image prior to combination , and the portions of fields 1 and 2 that have high stellar density were masked to prevent introducing artifacts into the final calibration frame .",
    "the calibration frames constructed in this manner were subtracted from the flat - fielded data , and the results were spatially registered and stacked to obtain the final datasets for photometric analysis .",
    "stars in the final images have fwhm @xmath30 arcsec .",
    "the photometric measurements were made with the point spread function ( psf ) fitting routine allstar ( stetson & harris 1988 ) .",
    "the source catalogs , initial magnitudes , and psfs that are used by allstar were obtained from routines in daophot ( stetson 1987 ) .",
    "the criteria for selecting psf stars were a stellar appearance , a brightness that was well above the faint limit of the data , and a lack of bright neighbors .",
    "each psf is the result of combining roughly 50 stars .",
    "faint sources close to the psf stars were removed iteratively .",
    "the photometry was calibrated using standard star observations that were recorded over the same time period as the ngc 253 observations , and the results were checked against measurements in the 2mass point source catalogue .",
    "the mean difference between the wircam and 2mass measurements is 0.008 magnitudes in @xmath31 , with a standard deviation of @xmath32 magnitudes .",
    "the photometric catalogue was filtered to remove objects with psf - fit errors , @xmath33 , @xmath34 magnitude .",
    "this defines the faint limit of the photometry , rejecting objects for which photometry is problematic owing to a low s / n ratio .",
    "objects that departed from the dominant relation between @xmath33 and magnitude were also removed , and these tend to be sources that are either moderately extended , in very crowd environments , associated with diffraction spikes , or cosmetic defects . finally , objects with a daophot round parameter that is markedly larger than the norm , which tend to be either galaxies or blended stars , were also removed from the photometric catalogue .",
    "the majority of sources that were removed from the photometric catalogue were identified with the two @xmath33 criteria .",
    "an example of the relation used to cull objects based on @xmath33 , and the type of objects that are removed or retained , is shown in figure 2 for sources in field 3 .",
    "the dashed line in figure 2 is the curve that was used to reject sources ; objects that fall above this curve were deleted from the photometric catalogue .",
    "the two highlighted objects with @xmath33 values that fall above the dashed line in figure 2 are clearly galaxies , while the two highlighted objects that fall below this line have a stellar appearance .",
    "the culling function that was applied is not overly zealous , and a more draconian cut could have been applied that runs much closer to the stellar locus near @xmath35 .",
    "however , it was decided to err on the side of caution , as there is not a clear - cut division between stars and galaxies .",
    "extended objects that remain after this initial culling are accounted for in a statistic fashion , using source counts made at large distances from ngc 253 .",
    "artificial star experiments were run to assess sample completeness and estimate the uncertainties in the photometeric measurements that are due to photon noise and crowding .",
    "artificial stars were assigned @xmath36 , which is the approximate color of the bright end of the agb in ngc 253 . like actual stars in ngc 253 ,",
    "an artificial star was only considered to be detected if it was recovered in both filters .",
    "the artificial stars were subject to the @xmath33 and round culling criteria described earlier in this  .",
    "the uncertainties in the photometric measurements increase rapidly near the magnitude at which the sample is 50% complete .",
    "the 50% completeness magnitude varies across the field , in the sense that it becomes brighter towards progressively more crowded environments .",
    "the stellar catalogues are 50% complete near @xmath37 in the disk 10 kpc from the galaxy center , and near @xmath38 in the least crowded portions of all three fields .",
    "these magnitudes are consistent with the general appearance of the luminosity functions ( lfs ) discussed in sections 4 and 5 .",
    "many nearby galaxies that have superficially mundane morphologies , are actually embedded in highly complex stellar distributions , with sub - structures that are relics of past interactions . as the nearest large external spiral galaxy",
    ", m31 has been the target of numerous studies ( e.g. tanaka et al .",
    "2010 ; ibata et al . 2007 , and references therein ) .",
    "during the past few years efforts to identify and characterize low surface brightness structures have been extended to more distant galaxies , including m81 ( davidge 2008d ; mouhcine & ibata 2009 ) , m82 ( davidge 2008c ) , ngc 5102 ( davidge 2010 ) , ngc 891 ( mouhcine et al . 2010 ) , ngc 5907 ( martinez - delgado et al . 2008 ) , and ngc 4013 ( martinez - delgado et al . 2009 ) .",
    "these studies reveal that tidal structures are a common feature among nearby spiral galaxies , as might be anticipated given the angular momentum content of their disks ( e.g. hammer et al .",

    "beck et al . ( 1982 ) and malin & hadley ( 1997 ) detect diffuse extraplanar structures in deep photographic images of ngc 253 .",
    "while the nature of these structures is not clear , they should be readily apparent in images recorded with digital detectors",
    ". moreover , the brightest stars in these structures should also be detectable during good seeing conditions . in this section , the overall stellar distribution in ngc 253",
    "is discussed , with emphasis on identifying features and trends that will be discussed in greater detail in subsequent sections .",
    "samples of m giants , c stars , and rsgs have been defined based on location in the @xmath39 cmd .",
    "the criteria used here are indicated in the right hand panel of figure 6 (  4 ) , and figure 3 shows the spatial distribution of each stellar type .",
    "a large fraction of the m giant and c star samples at large distances from the center of ngc 253 are actually background galaxies .",
    "m giants far outnumber c stars and rsgs , and the distribution of m giants in figure 3 is shown with an expanded scale to facilitate the identification of subtle features .    two distinct cross patterns , made up of columns and rows in which stars are abscent , are evident in the upper left hand detector of field 1 .",
    "these are centered on bright stars that were targeted by the wircam image stabilization unit , which repeatedly reads the signal from a small region centered on selected stars to fine - tune guiding . while the use of bright stars as guide beacons negates the use of the columns and rows that converge on them for science , the rest of the frame is not affected .",
    "while all of the stars considered here are in short - lived stages of evolution , and hence are relatively rare , several structures can still be identified in the stellar distributions .",
    "the disk of ngc 253 is the most prominent structure in the distribution of all three stellar types .",
    "the cleanest disk distribution is defined by rsgs ; not only are the ages of rsgs such that they are largely confined to the disk plane , but contamination from foreground stars and background galaxies is also modest in the part of the cmds that contains rsgs .",
    "there is a clear concentration of rsgs in the north east part of the disk , indicating that this area had a higher sfr than elsewhere in the disk during the past few tens of myr .",
    "the bright m giants in the disk define a ring - like structure with dimensions that are similar to the rsg distribution .",
    "the central ` hole ' in the m giant distribution is due to crowding in the dense inner disk , which hinders the detection of individual stars .",
    "crowding is less of an issue for rsgs in this part of ngc 253 , as these stars are significantly brighter than m giants .",
    "while rsgs are confined to a tight disk - like distribution , m giants are found over a larger area .",
    "the outer boundary of the m giant distribution is relatively diffuse when compared with the rsg distribution , and the m giants also define structures that may be signatures of an interaction with a companion .",
    "the most prominent such structure is the spur in the m giant distribution that extends to the south east of the disk in field 1 .",
    "this feature is also evident in the deep images discussed by beck et al .",
    "( 1982 ) and malin & hadley ( 1997 ) .",
    "this is an area of h@xmath15 emission , but there is no obvious uv emission , suggesting that there is not a large concentration of young stars ( hoopes et al . 2005 ) .",
    "figure 2 of boomsma et al .",
    "( 2005 ) shows a nose in the outer contour of the hi distribution in this part of ngc 253 , suggesting that neutral gas may also be present .",
    "this spur is not evident in the c star and rsg distributions , although this may be due to small number statistics .",
    "structures similar to this can result from the disruption of a satellite system ( e.g. figure 2 of fardal et al .",
    "if ngc 253 was involved in such an event then deeper imaging surveys may find a stream that defines the debris trail left by the companion galaxy .",
    "bright m giants can be traced to larger distances along the major axis than rsgs , and this suggests that the most recent episodes of star formation have been confined to small and intermediate radii in the disk .",
    "this is contrary to what is seen in the outer regions of many other nearby galaxies , such as m83 ( davidge 2010 ) , where the luminosity - weighted age drops with increasing radius .",
    "an absence of gas , and hence young stars , in the outer disk may be a consequence of tidal interactions , as gas is funnelled towards the center of the dominant galaxy and stars are scattered outwards ( e.g. hopkins et al . 2009 ) .",
    "the distribution of m giants in the disk of ngc 253 is lop - sided , in the sense that the density of m giants in the outer disk is higher in the north west quadrant than in the south east quadrant .",
    "the lop - sided distribution of young stars is also evident in the distribution of uv light (  6.1.2 ) .",
    "zaritsky & rix ( 1997 ) investigate the incidence of such asymmetries in nearby galaxies , and find that they are not rare .",
    "they also find that lop - sided galaxies tend to have higher sfrs than symmetric galaxies , and attribute the morphological asymmetry to the accretion of a companion .    with the caveat that there are differences in the number of sources , the c star and m giant distributions share many similarities .",
    "one exception is a possible concentration of c stars near the minor axis of ngc 253 that is much less obvious in the m giant distribution .",
    "the number density of c stars in this part of ngc 253 exceeds that near the edges of the wircam survey , where contaminating objects presumably dominate , at roughly the @xmath40 level .",
    "while the presence of stars near the minor axis may suggest an association with the outflow from the central starburst , such a connection is far from ironclad . at present ,",
    "outflow emission on the south east side of the galaxy is offset from the minor axis ( figure 1 of hoopes et al .",
    "perhaps the most compelling reason not to associate the c stars with the outflow is that c stars have ages that are in excess of 0.2 gyr .",
    "based on dynamical arguments and the physical extent of the region affected by the outflow , pietsch et al .",
    "( 2000 ) estimate that the outflow has an age of at least 25 myr , which is one to two orders of magnitude shorter than the time frame over which c stars form .    another challenge is to explain why the c stars have not dissipated away from the minor axis into the extraplanar field .",
    "a long - lived sequence of c stars may result if  for example  they are part of a coherent stream on a circumpolar orbit .",
    "if so , then c stars will also be seen along the north west segment of the minor axis , which was not observed with wircam .",
    "while a highly inclined orbital geometry of the supposed companion might seem contrived , the kinematics of material near the center of ngc 253 is consistent with the accretion of an object that was on such an orbit ( anantharamaiah & goss 1996 ; prada et al . 1998 ) .      with the exception of foreground stars and background galaxies ,",
    "the wircam fields contain a mix of sources that belong to the disk and the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 . in the present work",
    ", the sorting of the sources into disk and extraplanar components is done using distance from the principle axis of the galaxy , which is a reasonable starting point for investigating large - scale spatial trends .",
    "such a classification is possible given that the disk of ngc 253 is viewed almost edge - on .",
    "to be sure , sorting objects into broad ` disk ' and ` extraplanar ' components is simplistic , and does not address the presence of physically distinct structures .",
    "the extraplanar region defined here almost certainly contains stars that belong to stucturally distinct components , such as a thick disk , a classical halo , tidal features , and possibly stellar ensembles that are associated with the nuclear outflow .",
    "this being said , since the wircam observations are restricted to the brightest evolved stars in ngc 253 then the analysis is biased against the detection of structural components that are dominated by old objects , such as the classical halo , and there is a bias towards structures that are populated by objects with ages @xmath41 gyr .",
    "indeed , the @xmath31 lfs of agb stars in the extraplanar regions of fields 1 and 2 are very similar (  5 ) .",
    "this result , coupled with large scale distribution of these objects , which is also explored in  5 , indicates that  at least from a stellar population perspective  the wircam data probe what appears to be a single extraplanar component .",
    "deeper photometric studies will allow for a more complete identification and characterization of the other components that make up the disk and extraplanar regions of ngc 253 .",
    "the main body of ngc 253 in moderately deep exposures ( e.g. the dss blue image shown in figure 1 ) has a width of @xmath42 arcsec ( 2.3 kpc at the assumed distance of ngc 253 ) , and this is consistent with the distribution of rsgs and m giants in figure 3 . for the purpose of investigating stellar content trends in the disk plane , stars that fall within a 120 arcsec wide strip along the major axis",
    "are assumed to be in the disk , and the photometric properties of these objects are discussed in  4 .",
    "stars that fall outside of the disk strip , including all of those in field 3 and in the diffuse disk / extraplanar boundary zone , are assumed to be extraplanar , and the photometric properties of these objects are discussed in  5 .",
    "the term ` extraplanar ' was intentionally selected to describe these objects because it is very general , and lacks conotations as to the origins of these objects . referring to these as ` halo ' stars might imply to some readers that they are old and metal - poor , which is not the case (  5 ) .",
    "there is cross - contamination between the disk and extraplanar samples .",
    "the portions of the extraplanar region that are closest to the disk strip undoubtedly contain some stars that belong to the classical disk , while the disk strip is contaminated by extraplanar stars ; such contamination of the disk sample will be most significant for regions of the disk strip that are at large distances from the galaxy center , and it is demonstrated in  4 that this contamination is modest .",
    "the @xmath39 cmds of sources in the disk plane of fields 1 and 2 are shown in figures 4 and 5 .",
    "each cmd contains objects in a 4 kpc wide annulus in the plane of the disk , with the inclination of the disk to the line of sight assumed to be 76.1 degrees .",
    "the distance listed in each panel , r@xmath43 , refers to the midpoint of the annulus , as measured along the semi - major axis .",
    "the panels labelled ` sum ' show the composite cmd of sources in all the distance intervals in that row , and these are shown to illustrate the differences between the objects that are present at r@xmath44 kpc and at r@xmath45 kpc .",
    "there is substantial contamination at intermediate and larger r@xmath43 from objects that do not belong to ngc 253 . indeed , the number of sources arcmin@xmath46 is constant at large r@xmath43 , as expected if the number counts are dominated by foreground stars and background galaxies , which should have an approximately uniform distribution when averaged over moderately large angular scales .",
    "foreground stars populate the sequence with @xmath47 near @xmath48 , while background galaxies , which are the dominant source of contamination at the magnitudes covered by ngc 253 stars , populate the diffuse , red plume of objects with @xmath49 .",
    "comparisons with isochrones (  4.2 ) indicate that the majority of sources in the r@xmath44 kpc cmds are oxygen - rich agb stars , and these form a sequence with @xmath49 that peaks near @xmath50 ( m@xmath51 ) .",
    "moderately bright objects with @xmath52 are seen to the right of the oxygen - rich agb sequence . when compared with source counts at larger r@xmath43 ,",
    "overdensities of objects with @xmath52 are clearly evident redward of the m giant agb sequence with @xmath31 between 19 and 20 in the 10 kpc ( field 1 ) and 14 kpc ( field 2 ) cmds , and these red objects are c stars .",
    "the vast majority of objects above the agb - tip in the r@xmath53 kpc cmds are rsgs .",
    "these stars formed during the past few tens of millions of years and are the brightest signatures of recent star formation in the near - infrared .",
    "there are almost no rsgs in the 14 kpc cmds , indicating that recent star formation in the ngc 253 disk has largely been restricted to r@xmath53 kpc .",
    "there are differences between the field 1 and 2 cmds .",
    "the most conspicuous difference occurs at the bright end of the cmds , where there is a well - defined rsg sequence in the r@xmath54 kpc field 2 cmd , but many fewer rsgs , defining a less coherent sequence , in the r@xmath54 kpc field 1 cmd .",
    "the number of rsgs in the r@xmath55 kpc cmds of fields 1 and 2 are similar , suggesting that at smaller radii the rsg population is more uniformly distributed .",
    "the red stellar content resolved with wircam thus indicates that stars that formed during the past @xmath3 gyr are not uniformly distributed throughout the outer disk of ngc 253 , and that there are large areas where the recent sfr has evidently been much higher than elsewhere in the disk .",
    "a more subtle difference between field 1 and 2 is evident between @xmath56 and @xmath57 in the intermediate radii cmds .",
    "there is a sudden drop in the prominence of the agb sequence in this magnitude range between 14 and 18 kpc in field 1 .",
    "in contrast , the radial decrease in agb stars in the field 2 cmds is more gradual , with agb stars apparent out to r@xmath58 kpc in field 2 .",
    "these data thus suggest that the agb content of the ngc 253 disk is azimuthally asymmetric , and this is investigated further in  4.3 .",
    "the only published spectroscopic study of hii regions in ngc 253 was conducted by webster & smith ( 1983 ) , and their measurements indicate that [ o / h ] in ngc 253 is 0.4 dex higher than in the lmc .",
    "thus , comparisons with isochrones in the present work are confined to solar metallicities , and the r@xmath54 kpc cmds of fields 1 and 2 are compared with solar metallicity isochrones from girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in figure 6 .",

    "( 2003 ) from the rgb - tip , has been assumed , along with a line of sight foreground extinction a@xmath60 ( burstein & heiles 1982 ) .",
    "this extinction is lower than that measured by schlegel et al .",
    "( 1998 ) , which may be skewed by cool dust in ngc 253 ( e.g. davidge 2008c ) .",
    "the models from which the isochrones were constructed assume oxygen - rich atmospheres , and so follow the evolution of m giants , but not c stars .",
    "the isochrones indicate that the m giants with @xmath4 between 1 and 1.5 and m@xmath61 and @xmath62 ( i.e. @xmath31 between 20.5 and 19.5 ) have ages @xmath63 a few gyr . as for the oldest stars in ngc 253 , the wircam data sample the agb component and - at least in in low density areas - stars that are evolving at the upper end of the red giant branch ( rgb ) .",
    "the peak brightness of the agb concentration is consistent with an age @xmath3 gyr , indicating that the disk of ngc 253 has been actively forming stars throughout the recent past .",
    "the 10 myr and 30 myr isochrones define a near - vertical rsg sequence near the bright end of the cmds .",
    "there is a rich rsg sequence in the field 2 cmd , and the range of m@xmath64 occupied by these rsgs suggests that they formed @xmath65 myr in the past .",
    "rsgs do not form in systems with ages that are much less than 10 myr , and so it is worth noting that the peak of the rsg sequence in field 2 matches that of the 10 myr isochrones to within a few tenths of a magnitude .",
    "the rsg locus in field 2 is offset by 0.2 magnitudes in @xmath4 from the 10 myr isochrone .",
    "such a difference in color could indicate that the rsgs have a metallicity that is higher than solar .",
    "however , this is not consistent with the abundances measured by webster & smith ( 1983 ) from hii regions .",
    "the red colors of the rsgs could also indicate uncertainties in the model colors , although m supergiants in the galaxy and the magellanic clouds have @xmath66 ( e.g. elias , frogel , & humphreys 1985 ) , which is consistent with the isochrone predictions .",
    "a more likely explanation for the difference in color between the models and rsgs is that there is substantial reddening within ngc 253 .",
    "the reader may recall that only foreground extinction was removed from the cmds in figure 6 , and there is evidence for considerable amounts of dust in the ngc 253 disk ( e.g. sofue et al .",
    "in fact , internal extinction provides a numerically plausible explanation of the color offset between the rsgs and isochrones in figure 6 .",
    "pierce & tully ( 1992 ) apply the method described by tully & fouque ( 1985 ) to compute an internal extinction of a@xmath67 magnitudes for ngc 253 .",
    "this statistically - based extinction estimate corresponds to @xmath68 magnitude , and thus accounts for one half of the color difference seen in figure 6 .",
    "this is almost certainly a lower limit to the actual internal extinction of the brightest rsgs as young star - forming regions typically have higher levels of extinction than the main body of the disk , and this could amount to many tenths of a magnitude in a@xmath69 ( e.g. zaritsky 1999 ) .",
    "therefore , internal extinction is a credible explanation for much ( and possibly all ) of the difference in color between the isochrones and the observed rsg sequence .",
    "the areas of the cmd that contain the samples of m giants , c stars , and rsgs that were used to construct figure 3 are indicated in the right hand panel of figure 6 .",
    "the rsg area follows the portion of the field 2 r@xmath54 kpc cmd that contains these objects , with the lower magnitude boundary corresponding to the approximate peak brightness of m giant agb stars in ngc 253 .",
    "the lower magnitude boundary for m giants at m@xmath70 is a compromise between the growing number of these objects towards fainter m@xmath64 and the need to reduce contamination from background galaxies .",
    "this magnitude also corresponds approximately to the onset of thermally pulsing ( tp ) agb evolution , and so most of the m giants plotted in figure 3 are evolving on the tp - agb .",
    "the red boundary for m giants is set at @xmath71 , which is the approximate color in the lmc @xmath39 cmd at which a distinct c star plume becomes evident ( nikolaev & weinberg 2002 ) , while the blue boundary of the m giant region at @xmath72 follows the blue envelope of the agb plume .",
    "the upper and lower magnitude boundaries of the c star region in figure 6 bracket the magnitude range of cool c stars in the lmc , as defined by the c star plume in the @xmath39 cmd of that galaxy ( e.g. nikolaev & weinberg 2002 ) .",
    "the blue limit at @xmath71 separates m giants and c stars in the lmc , while a red color limit of @xmath73 was also imposed .",
    "the c star area in figure 6 thus excludes ` warm ' c stars , which have @xmath4 colors that overlap with those of m giants . lacking information on the depths of c - based molecules in the spectra of individual stars , the identification of warm c stars",
    "is problematic .",
    "however , warm c stars have intrinsically fainter m@xmath64 than their cool brethren . indeed , the @xmath74band brightness of c stars in the lmc ( figure 2 of battinelli et al .",
    "2007 ) drops from m@xmath70 at @xmath75 to m@xmath76 at @xmath77 , which places these stars below the faint limit of the wircam observations .",
    "the omission of warm c stars thus does not have a major impact on the luminous end of the c star lf .",
    "the lfs of stars with @xmath4 between 0.8 and 1.6 in the disk planes of fields 1 and 2 are compared in figure 7 .",
    "while this color range was selected primarily to accomodate m giants , rsgs are also included at the bright end of the lfs .",
    "the lfs in figure 7 were corrected for foreground stars and background galaxies by subtracting source counts from the r@xmath78 and 34 kpc annuli .",
    "the relation between the peak m@xmath64 of the agb and age predicted from the solar metallicity models of girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) is shown at the top of figure 7 .",
    "the field 1 and 2 m giant lfs at r@xmath55 and 10 kpc have comparable numbers of stars at m@xmath79 and 8 .",
    "given that the age calibration suggests that agb stars with m@xmath79 formed @xmath80 gyr in the past , then it appears that stars that formed during intermediate epochs are uniformly distributed throughout the inner regions of the ngc 253 disk . however , there are obvious differences between the field 1 and 2 r@xmath55 and 10kpc lfs at the bright end , where rsgs dominate the number counts .",
    "the number of rsgs at r@xmath54 kpc in field 1 is almost an order of magnitude lower than at the same r@xmath43 in field 2 , confirming the impression obtained from the cmds and figure 3 that the youngest stars in the disk of ngc 253 are not distributed symmetrically throughout the disk .",
    "evidence for asymmetries in the ngc 253 disk is also found at larger r@xmath43 .",
    "the number densities of m giants at r@xmath81 and 18 kpc in field 2 exceeds those in field 1 by 0.4  0.6 dex .",
    "the offset between the field 1 and 2 lfs is roughly constant over the range of m@xmath64 probed with these data , indicating that the difference in number counts is not due solely to the youngest stars .",
    "this indicates that while the agb population in the _ inner _ disk of ngc 253 is distributed symmetrically , the number density of agb stars in the _",
    "disk is lop - sided , in the sense of significantly higher densities in field 2 .    with the exception of the bright end of the field 2 lf ,",
    "the shape of the disk plane lfs do not change with radius . neglecting the systematic differences in the number density of stars at r@xmath81 and 18 kpc ,",
    "then within the ( large ) uncertainties at the bright end of the lfs with r@xmath82 kpc the overall shapes of the field 1 and 2 lfs are similar .",
    "the calibration at the top of figure 7 suggests that the brightest m giants in the r@xmath81 and 18 kpc annuli of both fields have ages @xmath83 gyr .",
    "the r@xmath58 and 26 kpc lfs were combined to boost the s / n ratio in these regions , and significant numbers of stars are seen in the resulting composite lf . the majority of stars detected in the r@xmath58  26 kpc interval have m@xmath84 , and this is consistent with them being upper rgb stars in moderately metal - poor ( [ m / h ] @xmath85 ) old populations , although they may also be intermediate age agb stars .",
    "the agreement between the number counts in the field 1 and field 2 @xmath86 kpc lfs indicates that the lop - sided mass distribution may not extend to the outermost regions of the disk .    because they are in a short - lived stage of evolution , and as such are relatively rare , the detection of the most evolved agb stars becomes progressively more problematic with increasing r@xmath43 .",
    "this introduces a radial bias in the age estimates , in the sense of overestimating the age of the youngest population as one goes to larger r@xmath43 . if the r@xmath81 kpc lfs are scaled to match the numbers of stars with m@xmath87 at r@xmath58 and 26 kpc , then it is evident that bright agb stars would not be expected in statistically significant numbers .",
    "therefore , the possibility that the disk of ngc 253 at very large r@xmath43 may contain stars that formed within the past few 100 myr can not be excluded with the wircam data .",
    "the distribution of bright m giants in the disk plane is examined further in figure 8 , where n@xmath88 is the number of stars per arcmin@xmath89 with @xmath31 between 19.5 and 20.5 ( i.e. m@xmath64 between 8.5 and 7.5 ) and @xmath4 between 0.8 and 1.6 .",
    "the difference in the number density of m giants in field 1 and 2 , which was noted previously , is clearly evident , and the number counts in field 2 exceed those in field 1 by @xmath2 dex at all r@xmath43 .",
    "in addition , the field 2 number counts define an exponential profile that continues to r@xmath90 kpc ( @xmath91 disk scale lengths ) .",
    "this is in marked contrast to the field 1 number counts , which follow only an ill - defined exponential , with a plateau in the number counts at r@xmath92 kpc .    in  5",
    "it is demonstrated that there is a diffuse extraplanar component , and some of the stars at large r@xmath43 in the disk sample may be stars that are not in the disk plane . however , the majority of stars detected at this large r@xmath43 in the disk sample likely are not extraplanar . indeed , source counts discussed in  5 indicate that the number density of extraplanar stars in field 2 is @xmath93 dex lower than in the field 2 disk plane at roughly the same distance from the galaxy center , and an even greater difference in number density occurs when comparing with the disk and extraplanar lfs of field 1 .",
    "thus , the highest stellar densities at large distances from the center of ngc 253 are found in the disk plane . in summary ,",
    "the wircam data indicate that the disk of ngc 253 extends out to distances of at least 22  26 kpc from the galaxy center .",
    "c stars provide additional insights into the star - forming history of ngc 253 . while sharing a common physical characteristic  an atmosphere in which [ c / o ] @xmath94 , which results in an absorption spectrum that is dominated by c - based molecules ",
    "c stars are a heterogeneous group of objects from a stellar content perspective , as they can have ages that range from 0.2 to 3.2 gyr .",
    "a further complication is that the fraction of the time during tp - agb evolution that a star spends as a c star depends on metallicity , since as one moves to higher metallicities then more c must be dredged up to bind atmospheric o. the fraction of the tp - agb phase that is spent as a c star thus drops as metallicity increases .",
    "the statistics of c stars in the lmc suggest that stars with z = 0.008 that formed 0.45  2.5 gyr in the past will spend at least 50% of their tp - agb evolution as a c star .",
    "for comparison , stars with solar metallicity in the same age range will typically spend only @xmath95 of their tp - agb evolution as c stars ( e.g. maraston 2005 ) .",
    "bolometric magnitudes for c stars were computed using @xmath74band bolometric corrections from bessell & wood ( 1984 ) for galactic and lmc stars , and the bolometric lfs of c stars in fields 1 and 2 are compared in figure 9 .",
    "the relation between peak agb m@xmath96 and age that is predicted by the solar metallicity models of girardi et al . ( 2002 ) is shown at the top of figure 9 .",
    "while the models assume o - rich atmospheres , the intrinsic luminosities of o - rich and c - rich stars with the same age and mass should be comparable .",
    "due to small number statistics , the brightest c stars give only a lower limit to the age of a system , and stars with m@xmath96 that correspond to that of the agb peak for a given age in the girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) calibration must be that age or younger .",
    "the c star lfs of disk stars in fields 1 and 2 at r@xmath55 are in excellent agreement , echoing the agreement between the m giant lfs at m@xmath97 noted previously .",
    "such a uniform distribution among stars with ages 1  3 gyr is perhaps not surprising , as stars with this age have been in place for many disk rotations , and thus might be expected to be well - mixed throughout the ngc 253 disk .",
    "this being said , the shape of the disk c star lf changes with r@xmath43 in both fields .",
    "the r@xmath53 kpc c star lfs are relatively flat or climb to higher numbers at the bright end . however ,",
    "when compared with the lfs at smaller r@xmath43 , the r@xmath81 kpc lfs are deficient in objects at the bright end , while the field 2 lf at r@xmath98 kpc has a distinct downward tilt towards brighter m@xmath96 .",
    "this change in lf characteristics likely signals an age gradient in the ngc 253 disk , in the sense that the mean age of c stars increases towards larger r@xmath43 . with the caveat that the measurement of the agb - tip is problematic when",
    "only small stellar samples are available , the brightest m giants in the field 1 and 2 @xmath86 kpc lfs have ages @xmath99 gyr if they are evolving near the agb - tip .",
    "there is a systematically higher density of c stars in field 2 than in field 1 at r@xmath100 kpc , and this difference grows with increasing r@xmath43 . at r@xmath81",
    "kpc the number density of c stars is 0.5 dex higher in field 2 than in field 1 , which is in line with the difference between the m giant lfs of these fields at the same r@xmath43 . at r@xmath101 kpc c stars",
    "have all but disappeared in field 1 , whereas significant numbers are seen in field 2 .",
    "m giants are seen in significant numbers out to r@xmath102 kpc in field 1 , with number densities that are comparable to those in field 2 at large r@xmath43 ( see figure 7 ) .",
    "if the stellar content in field 1 is like that in field 2 then c stars should be seen at large radii in field 1 , but none are detected .",
    "why do c stars disappear in field 1 at large r@xmath43 ?",
    "two general explanations for the change in c star counts are considered here : star - forming history and metallicity .",
    "the discussion starts with the assumption that the c stars formed _ in situ _ in the ngc 253 disk , although the prospect of them forming in a companion is discussed at the end of the section .    assuming a constant sfr and a moderately high metallicity for ngc 253 , then the majority of c stars formed @xmath103 gyr in the past ( figure 12 of maraston 2005 ) .",
    "a dearth of c stars at r@xmath101 kpc in field 1 could then result if the eastern half of ngc 253 is deficient in stars that formed 1  2 gyr in the past when compared with the western half of the disk .",
    "if this was the case then m giants in field 1 at r@xmath98 kpc would have formed predominantly within the past 1 gyr , and the m giant locus in the outer regions of field 1 would then have a bluer ridgeline color than in field 2 .",
    "in fact , the m giant locus in field 1 _ is _ matched approximately by the 0.1 gyr isochrone in figure 6 , while in field 2 the m giant locus roughly coincides with the 1 gyr isochrone .",
    "alternatively , such a difference in color could also be due to systematically higher reddening in field 2 when compared with field 1 .",
    "metallicity is another quantity that plays a key role in defining c star statistics .",
    "however , metallicity is a cumulative quantity that is the result of gyr of evolution . to explain the difference in c star numbers noted above",
    ", the star - forming history of field 1 would have had to have differed from that of field 2 for a long period of time if the disk of ngc 253 has evolved as a closed system .",
    "this seems unlikely given that mixing will occur throughout the disk during gyr timescales .",
    "it is not known if the c stars in the outer regions of ngc 253 formed in ngc 253 , or in an object that was subsequently accreted by ngc 253 .",
    "if the latter is correct , then the bulk of the satellite was presumably accreted into field 2 and has not yet been mixed throughout the galaxy ( i.e. the object was accreted within the last gyr ) . the difference in c star content between fields 1 and 2",
    "could then be due to either star - forming history and/or metallicity .",
    "metallicity becomes a much more viable explanation for the dominant cause of c star differences if the stars at large r@xmath43 in field 2 were either accreted from a companion galaxy or formed from gas that was accreted from another galaxy , as the chemical evolution of that system was almost certainly very different from that of the ngc 253 disk .",
    "the @xmath39 cmds of sources in field 3 are shown in figure 10 , while the cmds of the extraplanar objects in fields 1 and 2 are shown in figures 11 and 12 .",
    "as in figures 4 and 5 , the cmds include sources in 4 kpc wide intervals .",
    "however , unlike figures 4 and 5 , the midpoint radius of each annulus shown in figures 10  12 is the radial distance from the center of the galaxy measured on the plane of the sky , @xmath104 , as opposed to distance measured in the plane of the disk .",
    "composite cmds of all sources in the cmds in each row are also shown .",
    "the general appearance of the cmds in figures 10  12 changes gradually with @xmath104 , transitioning from cmds that are dominated by ngc 253 stars to those that are dominated by foreground stars and background galaxies .",
    "the cmds with @xmath105 kpc have a prominent plume at @xmath49 and with @xmath106 that is due to m giants , and a modest concentrations of m giants is seen in the cmds out to @xmath107 kpc .",
    "there is also a spray of objects with @xmath52 , that is most obvious in the @xmath108 kpc cmd , and many of these are cool c stars .",
    "the cmds in figures 10  12 thus indicate that an intermediate age extraplanar component can be traced out to large @xmath104 .",
    "in addition , that the extraplanar component extends from field 3 into fields 1 and 2 indicates that intermediate age extraplanar stars are not restricted to the minor axis of ngc 253 , but likely surround the galaxy .",
    "while all sources in field 3 have been classified as extraplanar , there is some ambiguity in the physical location within ngc 253 of stars in field 3 .",
    "the orientation of ngc 253 on the sky is such that disk stars huddle along a relatively narrow strip , and the amount of disk contamination in the extraplanar regions drops rapidly with increasing z@xmath109 , as the density of disk stars drops and progressively larger extraplanar volumes are sampled .",
    "still , some of the bright agb stars in the fields with the smallest @xmath104 in field 3 probably belong to the disk .",
    "if the classical disk of ngc 253 extends out to r@xmath110 kpc , as suggested by star counts in fields 1 and 2 , then some objects that have @xmath111 kpc near the minor axis in field 3 may belong to the classical disk , as opposed to being extraplanar , but these will be modest in number given the density of objects in this part of teh disk ( figure 8) .",
    "the cmds of sources in field 3 with very different @xmath104 are compared with z = 0.019 isochrones from girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) in figure 13 . as with the comparisons in figure 6 ,",
    "a correction was applied only for foreground extinction , and not internal extinction .",
    "given the orientation of ngc 253 on the sky , a small number of sources in the @xmath112 kpc cmd may belong to the classical disk .",
    "the cmd of sources with z@xmath113 kpc is also shown to allow the reader to assess by eye the contamination from foreground stars and background galaxies in the @xmath112 kpc cmd .",
    "the @xmath112 kpc and @xmath114 kpc intervals sample similar total areas on the sky .",
    "when compared with the @xmath114 kpc cmd , the @xmath112 kpc cmd contains a clear excess population of objects with m@xmath115 and @xmath4 between 1 and 1.5 .",
    "the 1 gyr isochrone passes through the middle of this population of objects , which are m giants in ngc 253 .",
    "the peak of the m giant sequence in the @xmath112 kpc interval indicates that  as in the disk of ngc 253  the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 contain large numbers of stars that formed at least 1 gyr in the past .",
    "a well - defined rsg sequence is not seen in the @xmath112 kpc cmd , and so there are no signs of very recent star formation in the wircam data at these @xmath104 .",
    "the @xmath31 luminosity functions ( lfs ) of extraplanar objects with @xmath4 between 0.8 and 1.6 , which is the color range containing bright m giants , are shown in figure 14 .",
    "the field 1 , 2 , and 3 lfs are plotted with solid , dashed , and dotted lines , respectively . as in  4 ,",
    "the lfs have been corrected statistically for contamination from galactic foreground stars and background galaxies by subtracting source counts at large offsets from the galaxy center .    that sources are seen in field 3 in significant numbers out to @xmath116 kpc",
    "indicates that an extraplanar component is present , and extends to large distances off of the disk plane , in agreement with the visual impression obtained from the cmds .",
    "in addition , there is considerable field - to - field variation in the number density of extraplanar stars at the same z@xmath109 .",
    "the spatial distribution of extraplanar stars is skewed to higher values near the disk plane , with the highest concentration of objects in field 2 .",
    "such field - to - field differences are suggestive of either a lumpy stellar distribution or a departure from the circular symmetry that is assumed to compute @xmath104 .",
    "the number densities of stars with m@xmath117 in field 2 tend to be a few tenths of a dex higher than in field 1 at all r@xmath43 , while the number density of sources in field 3 is roughly an order of magnitude lower than in fields 1 and 2 .",
    "the agreement between the source densities in fields 1 and 2 suggests that localized density variations may account for differences in number counts of no more than a few tenths of a dex when averaged over kpc scales . as for a non - cicular",
    "projected distribution , the tendency for higher number densities to occur in fields 1 and 2 at a given @xmath104 is indicative of an elliptical distribution , in broad agreement with the overall visual distribution of stars in figure 3 . that the number density of stars with @xmath31 between 20 and 21 at @xmath116 kpc in field 3 matches the number density of stars in the same magnitude range at @xmath118 kpc in fields 1 and 2 suggests that the projected ellipticity of the extraplanar component is @xmath119 .",
    "the difference in number densities of extraplanar sources between fields 1 and 2 mirrors the distribution of disk stars , hinting that the disk plane and extraplanar populations identified in this paper are not completely de - coupled , and might have a common heritage .",
    "the degree of similarity between the lfs of stars in the disk plane and the extraplapanar regions is investigated in figure 15 , where the extraplanar lfs of fields 1 and 2 are compared with the r@xmath81 kpc disk plane lfs of m giants in the same fields .",
    "the disk plane lfs have been scaled to match the mean number counts in the extraplanar lfs at m@xmath120 , and 8.5 .",
    "the higher stellar density in the disk elevates the completeness limit in the disk plane lfs with respect to that in the extraplanar regions (  2 ) .",
    "field - to - field differences in completeness notwithstanding , the disk plane and extraplanar lfs have similar shapes at the bright end , signalling similar star - forming histories over a large fraction of the age of the universe .",
    "the agreement between the disk and extraplanar lfs in figure 15 is consistent with a disk origin for the extraplanar stars .",
    "if this is correct then the disk must have been disrupted not too far in the past , given the similarities between the disk and extraplanar lfs at the bright end .",
    "the spatial distribution of extraplanar m giants in ngc 253 provides further insights into their nature and origins .",
    "the number density of agb stars with @xmath31 between 19.5 and 20.5 ( i.e. m@xmath64 between 8.5 and 7.5 ) and @xmath4 between 0.8 and 1.6 is shown in figure 16 as functions of z@xmath109 ( top panel ) and z@xmath121 ( lower panel ) .",
    "a linear relation in the top panel is indicative of an exponential distribution , as is associated with rotationally - supported disks , while a linear relation in the lower panel is indicative of a distribution that is associated with a classical non - rotating virialized system .",
    "there are only subtle differences between the distribution of points in the two panels of figure 16 . while a linear relation with a small amount of scatter can be fit to the points in the top panel , a reasonable linear fit can also be made to the points in the lower panel , albeit with larger scatter than in the top panel .",
    "these data thus lack the statistical power to characterize unambiguously the spatial distribution of the brightest m giants in this part of ngc 253 .",
    "the structural characteristics of the brightest m giants notwithstanding , the absence of marked discontinuities in the distribution of the brightest m giants suggests that these stars belong to a single population of objects that is well - mixed throughout the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 .",
    "a population of objects with @xmath52 is seen throughout the extraplanar regions , and some fraction of these are luminous cool c stars .",
    "the m@xmath96 lfs of these objects , constructed following the procedures described in  4 , including a statistical correction for contamination from foreground and background sources , are shown in figure 17 . as with the m giant lfs , field 2 tends to have the highest density of objects . with the caveat that the uncertainties in the field 1 and field 3 lfs tend to be substantial at most @xmath104 , the density of objects in field 3 tends to be comparable to that in field 1 .",
    "the c stars thus appear to have a more circular distribution on the sky about the center of ngc 253 than the luminous m giants ; a survey for c stars along the north west minor axis will provide additional information to test the veracity of this result .",
    "the c star lfs of all three fields have similar shapes , that appear not to change with @xmath104 .",
    "the age calibration at the top of figure 17 suggests that the youngest c stars throughout much of the extraplanar regions have ages @xmath41 gyr , further supporting the notion that the regions surrounding ngc 253 contain stars that formed during cosmologically - recent epochs .",
    "the relation between peak agb brightness and age that is shown at the top of figure 14 indicates that subtantial numbers of stars with ages @xmath122 gyr are present throughout the extragalactic regions out to projected distances from the galaxy center that are comparable to that of the physical extent of the disk along the major axis .",
    "the ages of the youngest stars , which could be gauged from the peak brightness of the agb , is of obvious interest , but this is a difficult measurement to make .",
    "small number statistics are an issue at @xmath123 at almost all @xmath104 , although there are significant numbers of stars with magnitudes that are consistent with an agb - tip age of 0.5 gyr at small @xmath104 .",
    "while providing information about the age of the youngest agb stars , the agb - tip has limitations as a probe of stellar content .",
    "the use of the agb - tip as the sole age diagnostic is inefficient , in the sense that other age - related information is ignored . in addition , determining the magnitude of the agb - tip can be affected by small number statistics , photometric variability , and the potential for obscuration by thick circumstellar disks , which introduces a potential bias against the detection of the intrinsically most luminous stars in surveys at visible and near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "while not providing a pancea for overcoming the shortcomings associated with the agb - tip , the lf of agb stars offers additional information about the mix of stellar ages within a system .",
    "the lf also has the merit of using all stars in a sample that are brighter than some magnitude cut - off , as opposed to only those that are the very brightest . in this study , insights into the star - forming history of the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 are obtained by comparing the observed lfs with model lfs that were constructed from routines in starfish ( harris & zaritsky 2001 ) . the goal of this effort is not to model specific features in the observed lfs , but rather to generate lfs that will serve as interpretive guides .",
    "the simplest star - forming history is a single episode of star formation that forms stars having the same metallicity - a so - called simple stellar population ( ssp ) .",
    "if the bright extraplanar stars in ngc 253 formed _ in situ _ as the result of a single event then they might be expected to have only a modest dispersion in age and metallicity , and hence the lf of these stars could be approximated by that of a ssp .",
    "model lfs for ssps generated from the solar metallicity girardi et al .",
    "( 2002 ) isochrones are compared in figure 18 with the mean lf of sources in the @xmath124 and 14 kpc intervals of field 3 .",
    "a salpeter mass function has been assumed , although the model lfs in the magnitude range considered here are not sensitive to the properties of the mass function .",
    "the field 3 lf is steeper than the ssp model lfs .",
    "this departure from flatness is most noticeable when m@xmath125 , and indicates that the agb stars in the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 have a range of ages .",
    "thus , the extraplanar stars are not part of an ssp that formed within , say , the past @xmath8 gyr .",
    "another interesting reference model is that of a single - metallicity system that has experienced a continuous star - forming history with a constant sfr .",
    "this scenario is highly idealized and does not account for chemical evolution .",
    "still , the star - forming activity of spiral galaxy disks and dwarf irregular galaxies with m@xmath5 , which is the luminosity range in which stochastic flucuations in star - forming history are greatly reduced ( e.g. weisz et al . 2008 ) , is more - or - less continuous .",
    "the model labelled ` constant sfr ' in figure 18 shows the lf of a solar metallicity system that has experienced a constant sfr over the age range 0.2  10 gyr .",
    "this model predicts decreasing star numbers towards more luminous m@xmath64 , and the slope of the model lf is roughly consistent with that of the @xmath126 kpc field 3 lf .",
    "the agreement between the observations and the constant sfr model lf is not perfect , and it should be recalled that no effort has been made to finesse the star - forming history to match the observations .",
    "for example , the break in the @xmath126 kpc lf near m@xmath127 could be the result of a drop in the sfr @xmath128 gyr in the past .",
    "other astrophysically relevant improvements would be to include ( 1 ) a large departure from a constant sfr at very early epochs to account for the elevated sfr that is associated with the initial stages of galaxy assembly , and ( 2 ) the effects of chemical enrichment .",
    "however , neither of these additions to the models would change the basic conclusion that can be reached from the comparisons in figure 18 : the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 contain stars that span a range of ages . including a sfr spike at early epochs would only impact the two faintest bins plotted in figure 18 . as for the inclusion of chemical enrichment ,",
    "the lf is dominated by stars with ages @xmath41 gyr .",
    "therefore , only very steep age - metallicity relations would have a significant impact on the models , and a steep age - metallicity relation is not consistent with observations of nearby spiral galaxies ( e.g. magrini et al .",
    "2009 ) . the potential for fine - tuning the model lfs aside , it is clear that the lf of extraplanar stars is consistent with them not being part of a coeval system ;",
    "rather , the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 are populated by stars that formed over a protracted period of time .",
    "deep @xmath27 and @xmath31 images obtained with the cfht wircam have been used to explore the stellar content in the outer regions of the nearby starburst galaxy ngc 253 .",
    "this is the first panoramic stellar survey of this galaxy .",
    "photometrically - selected samples of rsgs , m giants and c stars are used to trace the spatial distribution of stars with young and intermediate ages .",
    "stars are assigned to the disk or the extraplanar regions based on their projected location on the sky ( 1 ) to assess population characteristics , and ( 2 ) to investigate spatial trends and search for structures . while there is inevitable contamination between the disk and extraplanar samples , this is only an issue at modest offsets from the disk plane , near the boundary separating the disk and extraplanar regions .",
    "the brightest disk stars in the near - infrared are rsgs , and comparisons with isochrones suggest that the youngest of these have ages @xmath7 myr in ngc 253 .",
    "rsgs are highly effective probes of recent star formation by virtue of their intrinsic brightness , and the distribution of rsgs in the ngc 253 disk is lop - sided , with many more in the north east quadrant of the galaxy than in the south west quadrant .",
    "unfortunately , small number statistics restrict the usefullness of rsgs as stellar content probes in low - density environments .",
    "m giants that are evolving on the agb are more plentiful in composite stellar systems than rsgs , and hence provide a better means of tracing diffuse structures .",
    "the photometric depth of the wircam data is such that m giants with ages that span the lifetime of the galaxy are present in these data , although the vast majority of m giants detected here probably have ages @xmath129 gyr . while m giants have the merit of being comparatively easy to detect because of their intrinsic luminosity , the ability to use them to identify individual star - forming episodes diminishes towards progressively older ages .",
    "this is because the rate of change of agb - tip brightness with time decreases with increasing age , making efforts to isolate individual large - scale star - forming events that occured more than a few gyr in the past difficult .",
    "an added complication is that a significant fraction of stars near the agb - tip are lpvs , and photometric variability blurs information in the lfs . because of their comparatively high numbers",
    ", m giants have been adopted as the main tracer of structure in this paper .",
    "c stars provide insights into the star - forming history of a system that are complementary to those provided by m giants .",
    "whereas the brightest m giants have ages @xmath6 gyr , the majority of c stars have ages 1  3 gyr ( e.g. maraston 2005 ) . that c stars are seen over the same spatial intervals as m giants throughout the disk and extraplanar regions of ngc 253",
    "provides direct evidence that the disk and extraplanar regions of this galaxy contain stars that span a wide range of ages .        the extent to",
    "which ngc 253 can serve as a template for understanding more distant starburst systems depends on its nature prior to the events that sparked the current starburst ",
    "if ngc 253 has not had a ` typical ' history then it may not be a good comparison object for probing ` typical ' starburst activity .",
    "in fact , the properties of the globular cluster system hint that ngc 253 may not be a textbook spiral galaxy in terms of its past evolution .",
    "expanding upon the sample of clusters identified by beasley & sharples ( 2000 ) , olsen et al .",
    "( 2004 ) used deep spectra to identify ngc 253 globular clusters and study their kinematics .",
    "olsen et al . ( 2004 ) find that the globular clusters system of ngc 253 is remarkable in two respects .",
    "first , it appears to be rotationally supported , with a characteristic scale length that is comparable to that of the present - day hi disk , although there are admittedly large uncertainties in this quantity . while ngc 253 is not unique in having a rotationally - supported globular cluster system , it is the best characterized such system ( olsen 2010 , private communication ) .",
    "second , the specific frequency of globular clusters in ngc 253 is more than an order of magnitude lower than in other sculptor group spiral galaxies .    that the characteristic size of the star - forming disk of ngc 253 has evidently not changed since early epochs",
    "is surprising given the evidence for inside - out disk growth in spiral galaxies ( e.g. trujillo & pohlen 2005 ; colavitti et al .",
    "if disks form from the inside - out then globular clusters that formed early - on should have a more compact distribution than the present day stellar disk ( at least assuming that the stellar disk of ngc 253 has not been tidally pruned , which appears not to be the case given the large physical extent of the stellar disk defined by m giants  see below ) .",
    "a core assumption is that all of the clusters formed as part of ngc 253 , and were not accreted by an interaction with a companion .",
    "if ngc 253 did accrete clusters then the companion must have been on a coplanar orbit in order to retain a disk - like cluster distribution in the final merged system . in any event",
    ", cluster accretion seems unlikely given the low globular cluster specific frequency of ngc 253 .",
    "the presence of a spatially - extended disk - like globular cluster system is also surprising given that major mergers can have a highly disruptive effect on the properties of stars in disks prior to the merger .",
    "the vast majority of nearby spirals appear to have experienced such an event during the past few gyr ( hammer et al . 2007 ) .",
    "hopkins et al .",
    "( 2009 ) investigate the impact of major ( mass ratios @xmath130 ) mergers on gas - rich disks , and find that while the initial disk of the more massive galaxy may be obliterated , it re - forms on a cosmologically short time scale .",
    "existing stars are scattered out of the plane of the primary galaxy , and these subsequently virialize to form a pressure - supported system .",
    "an old globular cluster system in a disk galaxy that has experienced a major merger should then be pressure - supported , rather than distributed in a disk .",
    "the disk - like globular cluster distribution in ngc 253 is counter to this expectation , unless it experienced a major merger with a companion with an orbit that was coplanar with the ngc 253 disk .",
    "such a merger geometry is conducive to producing starburst activity and maintaining asymmetries in the disk ( such as those discussed in  4 ) if the companion orbit is prograde ( hopkins et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "the sculptor group is dynamically unevolved ( karachentev 2005 ) , and ngc 253 may simply be one of the @xmath131 of nearby spirals that have avoided a major merger ( hammer et al . 2007 ) .",
    "major mergers involving gas - rich systems produce environments that are conducive to globular cluster formation ( e.g. ashman & zepf 1992 ) .",
    "therefore , an uneventful interaction history could explain the low specific frequency of globular clusters in ngc 253 .",
    "if ngc 253 has not experienced a major merger for a large fraction of the hubble time then it might have a relatively compact stellar disk when compared with other nearby galaxies , due to a relative deficiency in angular momentum ( hammer et al .",
    "m81 has an m@xmath64 that is comparable to that of ngc 253 , and the disk scale length of ngc 253 ( 1.7 kpc ; forbes & depoy 1992 ) is comparable to that measured for m81 from the @xmath74band surface brightness profiles given by jarrett et al .",
    "the wircam data also indicate that the physical extent of the ngc 253 disk is not compact .",
    "agb stars in the disk are traced out to at least 22 kpc along the major axis (  4 ) , which corresponds to 13 scale lengths .",
    "given the diffuse appearance of the outer disk in figure 3 , it is possible that the stars seen at large r@xmath43 may not be in the classical disk ; rather , they could be the result of tidal interactions .",
    "still , that stars are detected out to this distance in both fields 1 and 2 with comparable number densities argues that the majority of these stars are part of a dynamically mature component , which we associate with the disk .",
    "the extent of the stellar disk in ngc 253 is thus comparable to the distances out to which stars have been resolved in ngc 247 ( davidge 2006 ) and m81 ( davidge 2009 ) , and exceeds the stellar disk of ngc 2403 ( davidge 2007 ) .",
    "we conclude that the stellar disk of ngc 253 is not compact when compared with other nearby galaxies .",
    "if , as the other evidence suggests , ngc 253 avoided mergers up to the recent epochs , then ngc 253 may have received angular momentum from torques exerted by ngc 247 ( whiting 1999 ) .",
    "in fact , the disk of ngc 253 is likely even more extended than indicated by agb stars .",
    "the holmberg radius of ngc 253 is 17.6 arcmin ( puche et al .",
    "1991 ) , or 21 kpc .",
    "bright agb stars are relatively rare , and deeper images that sample stars on the upper portions of the rgb , will probably trace the stellar disk of ngc 253 out to even larger radii .",
    "blue main sequence stars may also provide a powerful means of plumbing the outer limits of the ngc 253 disk .",
    "the main sequence phase of evolution has a much longer duration than the agb phase , so that main sequence stars will occur in much larger numbers than agb stars .",
    "moreover , the use of blue stars also results in greater contrast with respect to background galaxies , the majority of which have red colors ( e.g. davidge 2008d ) .",
    "the spatial distribution of recent star formation can be used to probe the recent history of the galaxy .",
    "starbursts are most commonly associated with galaxy - galaxy interactions and so the disk of ngc 253 might be expected to harbour signatures of a tidal encounter .",
    "in fact , evidence for such an interaction is evident in the sub - structure close to the disk plane ( figure 3 ) .    if there was an interaction then it evidently produced elevated levels of star formation not only in the inner regions of the galaxy , but also in the disk .",
    "indeed , the high density of rsgs in the north east portion of ngc 253 indicates that this was an area of very active star formation within the past few tens of myr .",
    "this interpretation is supported by the presence of nuv and fuv emission ( hoopes et al . 2005 ) and intense h@xmath15 emission ( hoopes et al .",
    "1996 ) in this part of the galaxy .",
    "the bright h@xmath15 emission indicates that the elevated star - forming activity heralded by the rsgs almost certainly continues up to the current time .",
    "while the south west part of the disk is not devoid of h@xmath15 emission and uv - bright objects , the sources there are fainter and less numerous than at the other end of the major axis .",
    "the north east portion of the ngc 253 thus appears to have had the highest levels of star formation in the main body of the disk during at least the past few tens of myr .",
    "this part of the galaxy also shows an enhancement in the number of bright agb stars with respect to the south east arm of the major axis (  4 ) , suggesting that excess star formation in this area has occured for hundreds of gyr .",
    "while the orbital properties of the supposed interacting galaxy are not known , there are clues to possible trajectories .",
    "the distribution of stars in figure 3 is suggestive of an encounter involving a companion with an orbit that was close to the ngc 253 disk plane , and this is consistent with the flattened distribution of extraplanar m giants measured in  5 .",
    "dynamically de - coupled material near the galaxy center ( anantharmaiah & goss 1996 ; prada et al . 1998 ) suggests that the encounter may also have involved the central regions of the galaxy .",
    "the range of interaction geometries investigated by hopkins et al .",
    "( 2009 ) indicate that the most pronounced asymmetries in the disk result from prograde encounters in which the companion orbit is close to that of the disk plane of the larger galaxy .",
    "the lop - sided nature of the ngc 253 disk thus suggests that the galaxy that interacted with ngc 253 was probably not on a retrograde orbit .",
    "we are not aware of published studies that investigate an interaction between ngc 253 and a possible companion .",
    "however , interactions between m31 , which has an integrated brightness that is similar to that of ngc 253 and is known to be surrounded by tidal features , and a companion have been examined .",
    "there is some similarity between the general appearance of m31 with its tidal structures in figure 1 of fardal et al .",
    "( 2007 ) and ngc 253 in figure 3 of the current paper .",
    "fardal et al .",
    "( 2007 ; 2008 ) investigate the interaction between a single satellite and the m31 disk .",
    "the main emphasis of these studies was to model the tidal features that have been found near m31 , and the orbital pericenter of the companion is a few kpc ( fardal et al .",
    "in addition to producing the m31 giant stellar stream , these models produce structures that are close to the observed disk plane .",
    "while originating in the satellite , the stars in these structures have a spatial distribution that is defined largely by the m31 gavitational potential . if the extraplanar population in ngc 253 is analogous to that in m31 then the fardal et al .",
    "( 2007 ; 2008 ) simulations indicate that the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 are populated predominantly by stars that originated in a companion galaxy .",
    "an interaction with a satellite will also affect the stellar distribution in the m31 disk .",
    "block et al .",
    "( 2006 ) consider a companion ( presumably m32 ) that passes through the center of m31 , and that study provides insights into signatures in the disk that such an encounter might produce .",
    "the interaction in that model produces a density wave that propogates outwards from the point of impact .",
    "this wave spurs star formation as it moves along , and localized regions of star formation in ring- or arm - like structures result ( figure 2 of block et al . 2006 ) .",
    "is there evidence for a collisionally - induced propagating density wave in ngc 253 ?",
    "galex uv images are examined in an effort to answer this question .",
    "the nuv and fuv morphology of ngc 253 , corrected to show the galaxy as it would appear if viewed face - on , is shown in figure 19 .",
    "the de - projection involved stretching the image along the minor axis to simulate tilting the line of sight , and then applying a deconvolution filter to correct for distortions introduced by this process .",
    "the overall distribution of star - forming regions is not affected by the deconvolution process .",
    "no attempt was made to correct for the inherent thickness of the ngc 253 disk , and emission from the outflow blurs the right and left hand edges of the disk in the de - projected images . the position angle and ellipticity measured from 2mass images ( jarrett et al .",
    "2003 ) were adopted , and residual oblateness in the de - projected images suggests that the ellipticity was underestimated by a small amount .",
    "the side lobes that bracket bright point sources are artifacts of the deconvolution process .",
    "the de - projected @xmath31-band 2mass image of ngc 253 is also shown in figure 19 .",
    "this is an interesting comparison dataset as near - infrared light traces mass , whereas uv light mainly traces young stars ; hence , differences between the near - infrared and uv images are expected .",
    "the barred morphology of the central regions of the galaxy is clearly evident in the @xmath31 image , as are the two spiral arms that emerge from the ends of the bar .",
    "the high dust content of ngc 253 almost certainly affects the appearance of the galaxy in the uv , and the bar that is prominent in the near - infrared is invisible in the uv .",
    "dust in the outflow likely produces the streaks in the right half of the southern disk of the uv images as well as the lack of uv emission immediately to the left of the nucleus .",
    "the uv sources loosely follow the spiral structure that is conspicuous in the near - infrared .",
    "the agreement between the near - infrared arms and uv sources in the northern half of the galaxy is reasonable ; while there is some uv emission along the spiral arm , the brightest sources of uv emission fall along the leading edge of the spiral arm , as expected if the leading edge of the density wave compresses the ism and triggers star formation .",
    "there is similar agreement between uv emission and spiral structure in the southern half of the disk . with the caveat that there is substantial extinction throughout the ngc 253 disk",
    ", there is no evidence for ring - like distribution of star - forming regions .",
    "if a galaxy passed through the ngc 253 disk then it did not leave a signature like that predicted by the encounter modelled by block et al .",
    "this might indicate that the companion was not as massive as m32 and/or that the passage had an oblique collision geometry .",
    "we close the discussion of the disk by noting that the north east disk of ngc 253 bisects the extraplanar hi found by boomsma et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , suggesting a causal relationship between the elevated sfrs and the gas emission .",
    "the high levels of recent star formation in the north east portion of the ngc 253 disk may have an impact on the circumgalactic environment through the formation of chimneys , which are conduits for channeling gas out of the disk plane ( e.g. norman & ikeuchi 1989 ) .",
    "significant mass outflow rates do not require large sfrs ( e.g. ceverino & klypin 2009 ) .",
    "melioli et al .",
    "( 2009 ) model the impact on the extraplanar environment of sne from a star - forming complex in a milky way - like system .",
    "their simulations indicate that the moderately compact concentration of star - forming regions produces a vertical plume of gas that diffuses only modest distances from the chimney axis after one disk rotation ( @xmath132 myr in their model ) .",
    "gas is ejected @xmath133 kpc above the disk plane in these models , whereas the extraplanar hi near ngc 253 is traced out to 12 kpc ( boomsma et al .",
    "figure 2 of boomsma et al .",
    "( 2005 ) shows extended spurs in the extraplanar hi emission , especially the column that extends to the north west of the disk plane , and this is consistent with the morphology of the chimney outflow predicted by melioli et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . while the arguements presented here are not ironclad , feedback from a ` boiling disk ' ( sofue et al .",
    "1994 ) , of which the concentration of rsgs in the north east disk are the most conspicuous manifestation at near - infrared wavelengths , is a viable mechanism for producing the extraplanar hi in ngc 253 .",
    "a diffuse extraplanar stellar component , which comparisons with model lfs in  5 indicate contains stars that formed over gyr or longer timescales , is seen in all three wircam fields .",
    "the distribution on the sky of the extraplanar component appears to be flattened , with an ellipticity near 0.4 .",
    "it can be anticipated that stars belonging to this extraplanar component should also be found to the north of the galaxy disk .",
    "the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 contain clues about the events that triggered the starburst .",
    "if the starburst was triggered by a tidal encounter with another galaxy then detritus from the interaction may lurk in the extraplanar regions , and evidence for such material is seen in figure 3 . while the extraplanar stars are widespread , girdling at least the southern part of the galaxy , there are minor field - to - field differences in extraplanar stellar density , indicating that the extraplanar stars are not yet well mixed throughout the halo . smaller scale structures , such as streams and shells , may become better characterised with deeper images that sample larger numbers of objects , such as stars on the rgb . in a related vein , studies of the present - day extraplanar component can also be used to predict the future appearance of the ngc 253 ` halo ' ; for example , will an observer in the distant future find that the halo of ngc 253 contains a complex mix of stellar components , the origins of which can only be identified through extremely deep photometric studies ?    to the extent that the simulations run by fardal et al .",
    "( 2007 ; 2008 ) can be applied to ngc 253 , then any tidal streams may have lower surface brightnesses than the morass of stars that surround the ngc 253 disk .",
    "selection effects may also come into play , as higher surface brightness tidal structures tend to be associated with material accreted from more metal - rich companions that have been recently accreted ( gilbert et al .",
    "hence , the prominence of stellar tidal streams provides clues about the nature of the companion and the time of the encounter .",
    "the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 contain a complex mix of stellar populations .",
    "ngc 253 is almost certainly surrounded by an old , classical stellar halo , although the spatial distribution and specific frequency of globular clusters hints that the classical halo may be even more poorly populated than the classical halos around other galaxies , and have a highly flattened morphology .",
    "comeron et al . (",
    "2001 ) find stars with young ages near the minor axis of ngc 253 , that presumably are associated with the outflow from the nuclear starburst .",
    "the first stars that formed in the outflow ( i.e. at least a few tens of myr in the past ; pietsch et al .",
    "2000 ) may have diffused away from their places of birth by now , and the dominant gravitation influence of ngc 253 will pull the young stars towards the disk plane , where they may ultimately form a more compact , kinematically relaxed distribution .",
    "a fraction of stars that formed in the outflow may also obtain relatively high velocities ( e.g. stone 1991 ) , allowing them to move large distances from their places of birth .",
    "the diffuse extraplanar component contains stars that are far too young to belong to a classical halo , while the wide age span ( @xmath134 gyr ) deduced from the m giant lf is not consistent with formation in the outflow , which has probably been in place for ( at most ) only a few 100 myr ( i.e. since the interaction with a companion ) . the uniform mix of the extraplanar population over large spatial scales , coupled with a lf that is indicative of an extended star - forming history that is typical of disk systems , is consistent with the stars having formed in an environment other than the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 .",
    "while it is argued here that the stars did not form in the extraplanar regions , pockets of star formation in such environments are not without precedent ( e.g. tullmann et al . 2003 ) , and _ in situ _ formation has been suggested as a possible mechanism for the formation of young stellar ensembles near m82 ( davidge 2008e ) .",
    "two possible sources of origin for the diffusely distributed extraplanar stars are the disk of ngc 253 or a gas - rich companion galaxy with m@xmath5 .",
    "an interaction between ngc 253 and another galaxy could perturb the orbits of stars in the ngc 253 disk , and produce an extraplanar component . as for an origin in a dwarf galaxy ,",
    "ngc 253 does not have an entourage of companions , and so the companion in question must have been completely destroyed or absorbed by ngc 253 .",
    "the chemical composition of stars in the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 will provide obvious clues into their origins . if these stars have near - solar metallicities than this would be indicative of having formed in the disk , whereas a metallicity that is , for example , one - tenth solar would favor formation in a lower luminosity dwarf galaxy .",
    "the photometric properties of rgb stars are one means of estimating metallicities , albeit for stars that formed at least a few gyr in the past .",
    "the deep cmd discussed by mouchine ( 2006 ) suggests that the majority of stars in the extraplanar regions near the minor axis have a mean [ m / h ] @xmath135 , ostensibly suggesting an origin in a dwarf companion .",
    "however , this mean metallicity assumes that the stars are all ` old ' .",
    "if the extraplanar regions are populated by stars that formed over a range of ages , then a large fraction may have ages @xmath136 gyr , and the metallicities of these objects will be underestimated if they are assumed to be old .",
    "the combination of visible and near - infrared data would provide considerable wavelength leverage for measuring improved metallicities .",
    "still , the ability to measure the characteristic metallicity of rgb stars may be complicated by the extensive dust content of the galaxy .",
    "differential reddening causes conspicuous blurring of the cmds of ngc 253 in the disk ( e.g. the discussion of the karachentsev et al .",
    "2003 and dalcanton et al .",
    "2009 cmds in  1 of this paper ) .",
    "there is also evidence for substantial quantities of dust in the extraplanar regions of the galaxy ( kaneda et al .",
    "2009 ) , which probably was ejected by winds from star - forming regions .",
    "the broadening of sequences on the cmds of ngc 253 fields caused by differential extinction may be mistaken for a mixture of ages and/or metallicities .    moderate resolution specroscopy provides a means of measuring metallicities that is less susceptible to differential extinction . given the low temperatures of the brightest stars in the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 , coupled with the need for high angular resolutions to resolve sources at small offsets from the disk plane , near - infrared spectra are of obvious interest , and the feasibility of obtaining such data is briefly discussed here .",
    "the near - infrared spectral region contains a number of metallicity - sensitive features that can be examined with spectral resolutions of @xmath137 , and the calibration of these has been investigated by frogel et al .",
    "the brightest m giants in the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 have @xmath138 , and experience with spectrographs on 8  10 meter telescopes indicates that total on - source exposure times of hundreds of hours would be required to obtain a spectrum with a s / n = 100 of a @xmath50 source with a resolution @xmath139 .",
    "however , the exposure time is markedly lower if the observations are conducted with a 30 meter telescope working at the diffraction limit , due to the d@xmath140 advantage .",
    "indeed , a simple scaling of the exposure times required for 8 meter telescopes suggests that spectra with a suitable s / n ratio could be obtained with exposure times of only a few hours with a 30 metre telescope .",
    "thus , while obtaining spectra of the brightest red stars is not feasible with 8  10 metre telescopes , this is a project that is well within the grasp of a 30 meter telescope .",
    "ngc 247 is the nearest large galaxy to ngc 253 .",
    "could ngc 253 and ngc 247 have interacted in the not too distant past ?",
    "an interaction between ngc 247 and ngc 253 seems unlikely at first blush , as ngc 247 does not show classical signatures of an interaction , such as a central starburst or extended tidal arms . surveys also have not found hi streams near ngc 247 or ngc 253 ( haynes & roberts 1979 ; putman et al .",
    "2003 ) that could be part of a debris trail .",
    "still , the disks of these galaxies are oriented in a manner that is consistent with mutual tidal torquing ( whiting 1999 ) .",
    "in addition , ngc 247  like ngc 253  has a truncated hi disk ( carignan & puche 1990 ) , a tendency for mean age to increase with radius in the outer disk ( davidge 2006 ) , and  what is perhaps most suggestive of a recent encounter  an intermediate age extraplanar population ( davidge 2006 ) .",
    "if ngc 247 and ngc 253 had a close encounter then tidal fragments may have been removed from one or both galaxies . while there are a number of nearby dwarf irregular and dwarf spheroidal galaxies , these are located to the north west of ngc 253 and",
    "are clustered near ngc 247 ( e.g. figure 3 of karachentsev et al .",
    "could some of the actively star - forming dwarf galaxies near ngc 247 be tidal dwarfs ?",
    "tidal dwarfs have characteristics that are distinct from those of classical galaxies that formed within primordial dark matter halos .",
    "the gas and stars that tidal forces displace from a galaxy quickly develop different kinematic properties , as gas is a collisional system that can dissipate energy , while stellar ensembles are collisionless systems .",
    "gas may thus form concentrated pockets where star formation may subsequently occur . because tidal dwarfs are not in dark matter dominated halos , they have structural properties that are distinct from those of classical galaxies , and may dissipate on timescales that are significantly less than the hubbble time .",
    "in addition , they will not have an underlying concentrated substrate of older stars , of which rgb stars are among the most prominent signature .",
    "finally , if the tidal gas came from a massive galaxy then the stars in a tidal dwarf will have a metallicity that differs from that expected from the [ m / h ]  m@xmath141 relation defined by classical galaxies .",
    "there are two galaxies close to ngc 247 on the sky that have conspicuous blue populations : ddo 6 and ddo 226 .",
    "karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2003 ) present @xmath142 cmds of both galaxies that are based on moderately - deep wfpc2 observations .",
    "the cmd of ddo 6 has a prominent rgb , indicating that it contains stars with ages of at least a few gyr .",
    "a subsequent investigation of the star - forming history of ddo 6 by weisz et al .",
    "( 2006 ) suggests that the majority of stars in ddo 6 formed 12  14 gyr in the past , and that star formation was only rejuventated within the past 0.5 gyr .",
    "thus , based on the presence of a large old population , ddo 6 is not a tidal dwarf",
    ".    the situation might be different for ddo 226 , the cmd of which lacks a prominent rgb .",
    "there _ is _ a concentration of red stars in the cmd with @xmath143 , but these do not form a well - defined sequence .",
    "working on the assumption that the red stars are on the rgb , karachentsev et al .",
    "( 2003 ) assign ddo 226 a distance modulus of 28.5 , placing it @xmath8 mpc beyond ngc 247 and ngc 253 .",
    "deeper images will help establish the nature of ddo 226 . more specifically",
    ", the detection of a well - defined rgb would indicate that ddo 6 is not a tidal fragment .",
    "the manner and timescale in which a galaxy and its companions evolve depends on initial conditions , such as the orbital characteristics of satellites , and environment , including the distances to the nearest large galaxies . while no two galaxies have the same initial conditions , and hence do not have the same evolutionary histories , the study of resolved stars can be used to identify nearby galaxies that may have experienced similar events , but are in different stages of their evolution and as such may appear to be unrelated .",
    "identifying such relationships will lead to a better understanding of galaxy evolution , as it will then be possible to directly probe the influence of  for example  local environment .",
    "m31 is potentially an interesting comparison object for ngc 253 .",
    "not only is m31 sufficiently close that it can be studied in considerable detail , but ngc 253 and m31 have similar m@xmath141 and m@xmath64 .",
    "the distribution of stars outside of the disk plane in m31 ( e.g. figure 1 of fardal et al . 2007 ) is also reminiscent of that seen in ngc 253 .",
    "still , the validity of pairing m31 and ngc 253 may seem dubious , given the obvious differences in overall morphology and environment .",
    "indeed , ngc 253 lacks the large bulge that dominates the central regions of m31 , while m31 is not presently experiencing a starburst .",
    "ngc 253 also lacks an entourage of companions , whereas m31 has many accompanying galaxies .",
    "the extraplanar structure around m31 indicates that it has had an extremely eventful past , and the number of companions in the past was probably even greater than at present .",
    "evidence for this comes in the form of conspicuous streams and shells , which are the remnants of one or more satellites that have all but disintegrated ( e.g. fardal et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ; ibata et al . 2007 ; koch et al . 2008 ) ; tanaka et al .",
    "( 2010 ) distinguish 16 substructures in the outer regions of m31 .",
    "the globular cluster system of m31 is also highly inhomogeneous , suggesting a diversity in origins ( beasley et al . 2005 ) .",
    "in addition to the well - documented structures in the outer regions of m31 , there is also evidence of a diffuse extraplanar stellar component .",
    "some of these stars belong to a classical metal - poor halo ( e.g. chapman et al .",
    "2006 ; kalirai et al .",
    "2006 ; ibata et al . 2007 ; koch et al .",
    "2008 ) . however , the majority of stars in all but the outermost fields have characteristic ages and metallicities that differ substantially from those associated with a classical halo ( e.g. bellazzini et al . 2003 ; brown et al . 2007 ;",
    "richardson et al .",
    "2009 ; tanaka et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "in addition to classical halo stars and tidal debris , brown et al .",
    "( 2007 ) argue that the extraplanar regions of m31 also contain stars that formed in the disk of m31 , and were displaced during intermediate epochs in a merger event .",
    "evidence has been presented in this paper that a similar event may have happened in ngc 253 , probably within the past few 100 myr .",
    "if ngc 253 evolves in isolation in the future and does not experience another interaction , which seems likely given its isolation , then the diffuse extraplanar component will evolve passively , slowly fading and becoming less conspicuous ; the differences between the old populations that have been in place since the initial formation of ngc 253 and the diffuse extraplanar component that formed recently will thus become less obvious , as the main sequence turn - off of the most recently formed stars dims .",
    "the end result will be a mix of old and intermediate age stars smilar to what is seen in the outer regions of m31 today . despite the obvious differences in the evolution of ngc 253 and m31",
    ", the present day ngc 253 may provide a glimpse of a younger m31 .",
    "the wircam observations have revealed extraplanar agb stars with ages of a few hundred myr throughout the southern half of ngc 253 .",
    "there should then be a diffuse population of main sequence turn - off ( msto ) stars with masses @xmath144 m@xmath12 .",
    "while such blue stars are too faint to be detected with wircam , they are relatively bright at near - ultraviolet ( nuv ) and far - ultraviolet ( fuv ) wavelengths , and if they are present in sufficient numbers then they will produce a diffuse uv halo surrounding ngc 253 . given that hotter",
    ", younger main sequence stars should be confined to the thin disk of ngc 253 , then a uv color gradient off of the disk plane might also be expected .",
    "archival galex nuv and fuv images of ngc 253 , which are those described by hoopes et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , were used to search for emission from a diffuse population of moderately bright msto stars .",
    "a @xmath145 kpc wide region on either side of the minor axis of ngc 253 was excluded from the analysis , to avoid confusion with sources of emission associated with the outflow . to facilitate the analysis , the uv emission from intermediate age stars",
    "was assumed to be axially symmetric about both the major and minor axes .",
    "this assumption boosts the s / n ratio , and is reasonable given that bright extraplanar agb stars permeate the wircam fields , and so likely surround the galaxy .",
    "nuv and fuv light profiles were obtained by averaging the data in the direction parallel to the disk plane at distances between 5.5 and 14 kpc from the minor axis .",
    "nuv and fuv light above the background level is detected out to @xmath146 kpc , in good agreement with the spatial distribution of m giants in field 3 .",
    "in addition , while the fuv ",
    "nuv color is constant between 0 and 10 kpc from the major axis , it becomes @xmath147 magnitudes redder between @xmath124 and 15 kpc , signalling a change in the sed of the dominant sources of emission .",
    "the galex data thus indicate that there is diffuse extraplanar uv emission around ngc 253 , as predicted from the star counts at near - infrared wavelengths .",
    "this emission is not associated with the outflow ( e.g. light from the nucleus that is scattered by outflowing dust ) , as a @xmath145 kpc ` exclusion zone ' was employed on either side of the minor axis when examining the galex data .",
    "the spatial extent of the uv emission off of the disk plane is consistent with that determined from resolved agb stars . that the fuv ",
    "nuv color within 10 kpc of the disk plane is constant is consistent with a disk - like stellar mix , again in agreement with the study of resolved stars , which indicate that the extraplanar agb lf is similar to that of disk stars .",
    "the wircam and galex data allow predictions to be made about the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 that can be tested with deeper observations .",
    "imaging studies of the extraplanar regions of ngc 253 at visible wavelengths should reveal a population of blue msto stars with @xmath148 , that collectively are the source of the diffuse uv emission .",
    "two predictions can also be made about the distribution of these objects .",
    "first , they will be seen out to @xmath149 kpc above the disk plane , based on the detection of bright agb stars and uv emission out to this same distance .",
    "second , the uv color profile suggests that the luminosity - weighted age changes @xmath7 kpc from the major axis , in the sense that a slightly older population dominates when @xmath150 kpc than at smaller distances .",
