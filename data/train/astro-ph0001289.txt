    "since the discovery of the cosmic x - ray background ( cxb ) by giacconi et al .",
    "( 1962 ) in the 26  kev band , many efforts have been made to understand the origin of the cxb .",
    "recently in _ rosat _ deep surveys , 70  80% of the cxb in the 0.52  kev band has been resolved into discrete sources at a flux limit of @xmath14@xmath2(@xcite ) . within the flux level of the deep survey ,",
    "broad - line agns are the dominant population and the main contributor to the cxb in the 0.52  kev band . on the other hand , in the harder 210  kev band , only @xmath15% of the cxb was resolved into discrete sources ( @xcite ) before _ asca _ surveys .",
    "broad - line agns have x - ray power - law spectra with a photon index of @xmath16 in the 210  kev band ( @xcite ) which are significantly softer than that of the cxb in that band ( @xmath17 ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , thus there must be objects which have harder x - ray spectra than nearby broad - line agns and contribute significantly to the cxb in the hard band .",
    "resolving the hard x - ray sky is a direct way to reveal the nature of x - ray sources in the hard band .",
    "_ asca _ gis observations of three _ rosat _ deep pspc fields down to the @xmath18@xmath2have been done so far ( @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "however , because of the large positional uncertainties of the gis - selected x - ray sources , a large fraction of hard x - ray selected sources is still unidentified ; the nature of hard x - ray sources and the difference from the _ rosat _ selected objects are still unclear .    based on the unified scheme of agns , absorbed agns are proposed as candidates for the hard x - ray sources ( @xcite ; madau , ghisellini , & fabian 1994 ) .",
    "because of absorption of soft x - ray photons by obscuring material , they have harder x - ray spectra than type  1 agns . to reproduce the cxb spectrum ,",
    "it is argued that there are around three times more absorbed agns than non - absorbed agns in the universe and absorbed agns dominate the cxb above 2  kev . in consequence of the assumption ,",
    "the existence of absorbed narrow - line qso ( so called type  2 qso ) is expected . from optical follow - up observations of x - ray surveys in the soft and hard bands ,",
    "several luminous narrow - line agns have been found at intermediate to high redshift universe ( e.g. , @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) . on the other hand , existence of red _ broad - line _ qsos whose red color suggests absorption to its nucleus",
    "was reported from a radio survey ( @xcite ) .",
    "such a population was also identified in _",
    "rosat _ surveys ( @xcite ) and _ beppo - sax _ surveys ( @xcite ) , but x - ray spectra , number densities and contributions to the cxb of both of these narrow - line and red broad - line qsos are not clear .    to reveal the nature of x - ray sources in the hard band , studies on a well - defined sample are important .",
    "we are now conducting an unbiased large and deep survey with _",
    "asca _ in the region near the north galactic pole , i.e. , _ asca _ large sky survey ( hereafter lss ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; ueda et al .",
    "1999a ( paper i ) ) . the flux limit of the lss ( @xmath19 1 @xmath20 @xmath2 in the 210  kev band ) is 100 times deeper than the",
    "_  a2 survey , which was the deepest systematic survey in the hard band ( @xcite ) before _",
    "asca_. we have surveyed 7.0 deg@xmath21 and 5.4 deg@xmath21 with the gis and the sis detectors , respectively .",
    "combining the data from the gis and the sis , we detected 44 sources in the 210  kev band with the following criteria : 1 ) the significance of summed count rate of the gis and the sis should exceed 4.5 , and 2 ) the significance of either the gis or the sis should also exceed 3.5 ( @xcite ) .",
    "they correspond to 20  30% of the cxb in this band .",
    "the advantages of the sample are 1 ) the survey area as a function of limiting count rates was determined well by simulations , 2 ) accurate x - ray positions were determined by using the sis whose resolution is higher than the gis and by correcting the temperature - dependent misalignment between the focal plane detectors and the attitude sensors , and 3 ) the x - ray spectrum of each source was determined by fitting power - law model with the galactic absorption to the gis and the sis data simultaneously in the 0.710  kev band ( @xcite ) .",
    "determining their x - ray spectra is important not only to know their x - ray properties but also to know the flux limit of the survey , because the limit varies with the x - ray spectrum of each source .",
    "the average of the apparent photon index of the 36 x - ray sources detected in the flux range between 0.8 @xmath20 and 4 @xmath20 @xmath2is @xmath22 ( @xcite ) , which is significantly harder than the spectra of x - ray sources detected in shallower surveys in the 210  kev band and close to that of the cxb .",
    "identification of these sources is clearly important to understand the nature of hard x - ray sources and the origin of the cxb .    in this paper , we report results of optical identifications of x - ray sources detected in the hard band with the sis in the _ asca _ lss . the sample definition and selections of optical candidates",
    "are discussed in section 2 , results of optical spectroscopy for the selected candidates and reliability of the identifications are presented in section 3 , and optical and x - ray spectroscopic properties of identified objects are described in section 4 . the contribution of the population to the cxb and the redshift distribution of the agns are discussed in section 5 and 6 , respectively . in section 7",
    ", we present multi - wavelength properties of the identified agns . throughout this paper ,",
    "we use @xmath23 and @xmath24 km s@xmath13 mpc@xmath13 .",
    "we call each x - ray source with the exact name and the identification number , like ax  j132032 + 3326(227 ) , for convenience .",
    "to minimize the effect of the galactic absorption and contamination from bright x - ray sources , the survey area was defined as a continuous region of @xmath19 5 degree@xmath25 near the north galactic pole , centered at @xmath26=13@xmath2714@xmath28 , @xmath29=31@xmath3030@xmath31 ( j2000 ) .",
    "seventy - six pointings of the survey - observations were done from dec .",
    "1993 to jul . 1995 .",
    "these exposures were designed to evenly cover the whole survey region with a 20 ksec effective exposure of the sis .",
    "the source detections were done with the sis data in the 0.77  kev , 0.72  kev , and 27  kev bands and the gis data in the 0.77  kev , 0.72  kev , and 210  kev bands . for details of the survey observation , source extraction , and spectral fitting , including the survey region and the position of the sources on the sky , see @xcite .    in this paper , we concentrate on the 34 x - ray sources detected with the sis in the 27  kev band above 3.5@xmath0 ( hereafter , the sis 27  kev 3.5@xmath0 sample ) .",
    "table [ area ] shows the survey area as a function of limiting count rates for the sample .",
    "the typical and the deepest limiting count rates of the sample are 2 counts ksec@xmath13 and 1.2 counts ksec@xmath13 , respectively .",
    "they correspond to @xmath32@xmath2and @xmath33@xmath2 in the 210  kev band for an x - ray source with a power - law spectrum with a photon index of 1.7 .",
    "all x - ray sources in the sis 27  kev 3.5@xmath0 sample have the significance level larger than 4.5 in summed count rate of the gis and the sis in both of the 0.77  kev and 27  kev bands and the positional uncertainties of such sources were estimated to be @xmath34 in radius with the 90% confidence level ( @xcite ) .",
    "the number of spurious sources was estimated to be at most a few percent ( @xcite ) , thus less than 1 spurious source was expected to be in the sis 27  kev 3.5@xmath0 sample .",
    "agns are the most plausible optical counterparts for the majority of the x - ray sources , thus at least we have to reach the optical flux limit which is converted from the deepest x - ray flux limit based on x - ray - to - optical flux ratio of agn .",
    "if we assume power - law spectra with an x - ray photon index of 1.7 and an optical energy index of @xmath35 together with the x - ray - to - optical flux ratio of agns identified in the _ rosat _ deep survey ( @xcite ) , the expected optical magnitude for the optical counterpart of an x - ray source with @xmath33@xmath2 in the 210  kev band is @xmath36 mag .",
    "candidates of optical counterparts were mainly selected from the apm catalog which is obtained from scans of glass copies of the palomar observatory sky survey plate ( @xcite ) . however , the limiting magnitude of the catalog is @xmath37 mag and is not deep enough to pick up optical counterparts for faint x - ray sources . to complement the depth of the data",
    ", we made imaging observations of the lss region at the kiso 1.05 m schmidt telescope in march and april 1994 . in these observations",
    ", we used the mosaic ccd camera ( @xcite ) which is made up of 15 1024@xmath381024 ccd chips and covers 2@xmath385 degree@xmath21 with 15 shots .",
    "the spatial resolution in the setup was @xmath39 pix@xmath13 .",
    "images were taken in the @xmath40 band with an exposure time of 20 minutes .",
    "the reduction of the data was done by the usual method for optical imaging data .",
    "the weather condition during the observation was neither stable nor photometric and the limiting magnitude changed from field to field .",
    "the typical seeing was @xmath41 ( fwhm ) and the typical limiting magnitude was @xmath42 mag , about one magnitude deeper than the apm data .",
    "there are several optical objects within each error circle of x - ray source above @xmath43 mag .",
    "two x - ray sources ( ax  j132032 + 3326(227 ) and ax  j130748 + 2925(002 ) ) show clear excesses of galaxies in and around their error circles ( see figure [ plate ] ) .",
    "these two objects have been cataloged as candidate clusters of galaxies , abell 1714 ( abell , corwin , & olowin 1989 ) and zwcl 1305.4 + 2941 ( zwicky , herzog , & wild 1961 ) , respectively . zwcl 1305.4 + 2941 was also detected in the _ einstein _ medium sensitivity survey and its redshift was determined to be z=0.241 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we took deeper and better resolution images with a tektronix 2048@xmath38 2048 ccd on the university of hawaii @xmath44 telescope on 1995 march and 1996 april in the @xmath40 and @xmath45 band and confirmed the excess of galaxies .",
    "thus , we identified the two sources with clusters of galaxies .",
    "for other sources , active galaxies are the most plausible counterparts . from optical objects within @xmath46 , which is slightly larger than the estimated 90% confidence error radius ( @xmath34 ) , of each x - ray source",
    ", we selected targets for spectroscopy , using 1 ) deeper x - ray follow - up data in the soft and hard band , 2 ) radio emission , and 3 ) blueness of uv or optical color which indicate existence of an activity in a object .      to pinpoint optical counterparts of x - ray sources , 20 ksec follow - up observations were made with the _ rosat _ hri in 2 fields in december 1997 .",
    "we selected two fields centered at @xmath26=13@xmath2714@xmath47 , @xmath29=32@xmath3001@xmath3112@xmath48 and @xmath26=13@xmath2712@xmath49 , @xmath29=31@xmath3013@xmath3112@xmath48 ( j2000 ) with a radius of @xmath50 , to cover as many _ asca _ sources as possible .",
    "we summarize the data reduction and the source detection in appendix a. all of the x - ray sources in the sis 27  kev 3.5@xmath0 sample ( ax  j131521 + 3159(136 ) , ax  j131407 + 3158(127 ) , and ax",
    "j131327 + 3155(121 ) in the former field , and ax  j131249 + 3112(096 ) , ax  j131128 + 3105(080 ) , and ax",
    "j131321 + 3119(103 ) in the latter field ) except one ( ax  j131345 + 3118(104 ) ) in these fields were detected by the hri and their optical counterparts were pinpointed thanks to the @xmath51 positional accuracy of the hri . on the position of the missed source ( ax  j131345 + 3118(104 ) ) , there is an x - ray peak in the hri image , though the significance level is slightly lower than the detection limit .",
    "since there is also an optical object at the position , the x - ray source is pinpointed .",
    "it should be noted that there is no hard x - ray source which has an x - ray spectrum with an apparent photon index smaller than 1.0 in these hri observed fields .",
    "deep 40 @xmath19 100 ksec pointing observations for 4 sources , which have hard x - ray spectra , ( ax  j131501 + 3141(119 ) , ax  j131551 + 3237(171 ) , ax  j131210 + 3048(072 ) , and ax  j130926 + 2952(016 ) ) were made by _",
    "asca _ and more precise positions and x - ray spectra were obtained ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the error circles for these sources were estimated to be less than @xmath34 at a 90% confidence level .    by the _ rosat _",
    "pspc , 15 and 13 _ asca _ lss sources were detected in the _ rosat _ pspc all - sky survey ( @xcite ) and pointing observations ( voges , private communication ) , respectively .",
    "9 of them were detected in both of the observations , thus the x - ray positions of 19 _ asca _ sources were determined accurately . in details of the cross - identification ,",
    "see appendix b.      in the course of the optical counterpart selection , we examined the distribution of first radio sources around lss x - ray sources to evaluate the cross - correlation between radio and x - ray sources .",
    "the first survey is a radio source survey conducted with the very large array in the 1.4 ghz band with a @xmath52 limiting flux of 1 mjy ( @xcite ) .",
    "there are 17 radio sources within @xmath53 from the centers of the x - ray sources ; by contrast no radio source exists between @xmath53 and @xmath54 from them . based on the surface number density of detected radio sources in the lss field",
    ", the contamination of a radio source which is not an counterpart of an x - ray source is expected to be less than 1 source for the whole 34 x - ray sources within @xmath53 .",
    "thus , the 17 radio sources are likely radio - counterparts of x - ray sources . in details of the cross - identification ,",
    "see appendix b. three x - ray sources have two to four radio sources within @xmath53 .",
    "they are thought to be radio - loud objects with radio lobes or clusters of galaxies .",
    "one of the three x - ray sources is already identified with a cluster of galaxies ( ax  j132032 + 3326(227 ) ) . in summary , 35% ( 12/34 ) of the sis 3.5@xmath0 sample",
    "are detected in the first survey and an optical counterpart is pinpointed thanks to the good positional accuracy ( @xmath55 ) of the first catalog , except for ax  j131639 + 3149(137 ) . for the x - ray source , there is no optical object within an error circle of the first radio source ( see notes in section 3.1 ) . in the error circle of ax  j131529 + 3117(110 ) , there is a radio peak with a flux of 0.63 mjy which is slightly lower than the detection limit of the first .",
    "because there is an optical object at the position , we identified the optical object with the counterpart of the radio peak and the x - ray source .",
    "the high fraction of radio - detected x - ray sources in comparison with other results ( e.g. , 10% in @xcite ) is due to a match between the flux limit of the _ vla _ first 1.4 ghz survey and that of the lss ; the ratio of the flux limits is one order of magnitude larger than the typical radio - to - x - ray flux ratio of _ radio - quiet _ broad - line agn ( @xcite ) but within the scatter of the ratio of the _ radio - quiet _ population .",
    "thus , not only radio - loud agns but also some radio - quiet agns are included in the lss - first sample ( see section 7.2 ) .",
    "it is worth noting that radio emission is transparent against obscuring material , thus obscured agns are detected in the radio wavelength as well as in the hard x - ray band , in an unbiased way .",
    "based on the results of the optical identification in soft x - ray surveys , a broad - line agn is a plausible optical counterpart for a part of x - ray sources detected in the hard band and they can be selected by a blueness of their uv or optical color if they are at redshift smaller than 3 .",
    "there are two uv - excess surveys which cover the southern half ( @xmath56 ) of the lss .",
    "these are usher ( 1981 ) and moreau & reboul ( 1995 ) .",
    "objects with an @xmath57 color bluer than 0.0 down to @xmath58 mag and 0.1 down to @xmath59 mag are cataloged in the former and the latter , respectively .",
    "8 out of 20 x - ray sources in the area have one or two uv - excess object(s ) within @xmath46 in total . 6",
    "are also detected in the x - ray follow - ups with _",
    "hri or in the first survey . considering the number density of uv - excess objects in moreau & reboul ( 1995 ) ,",
    "the expected number of contamination within @xmath46 from the center of the 20 x - ray sources is calculated to be 0.5 , thus all 8 correlated objects can be considered as plausible optical counterparts of x - ray sources .",
    "such a low probability of contamination indicates that there is no serious bias to selecting an uv excess object which is not a true optical counterpart of an x - ray source .",
    "additionally , two galaxies in the @xmath46 radii of ax  j131805 + 3349(233 ) are cataloged as uv - excess galaxies in the kug catalog ( @xcite ) .",
    "to select candidates of broad - line agns with fainter magnitude and to cover the whole lss area , we also picked up objects with @xmath60 mag as a broad - line agn candidates in the whole area , assuming a typical color of broad - line qsos ( @xmath61 mag ; @xcite ) with a dispersion of distribution ( @xmath62 mag ) and an error of photometry ( @xmath63 mag ) .",
    "the apm @xmath64 color was converted to the @xmath65 color with @xmath66 ( @xcite ) .",
    "19 x - ray sources have one or two optical object(s ) which meet the above criteria within @xmath46",
    ". 5 of them are also detected in either the x - ray follow - ups with _",
    "hri or in the first survey . within @xmath34 and between @xmath34 and @xmath46 from the 34 x - ray sources",
    ", there are 19 and 6 blue objects , respectively . based on the number density of objects with @xmath65 color bluer than 1.0 in the apm catalog ,",
    "the expected number of contamination of blue objects which are not x - ray source is estimated to be 6 and 5 in the inner circles and outer annuli , respectively .",
    "thus , two thirds of the blue objects in the inner circles are expected to be true optical counterpart of x - ray sources , on the other hand , most of the blue objects in the outer annuli are thought to be contamination of non - x - ray objects .",
    "almost all ( 5 out of 6 ) the hard x - ray sources which have a photon index smaller than 1.0 have no such blue object within their error circles ; therefore an optical counterpart different from a broad - line agn is suggested .",
    "this tendency is the same as the previous results reported in akiyama et al .",
    "( 1998b ) , but the new result is more significant than the previous one , because we concentrate on brighter x - ray sources whose positions and x - ray photon indices were determined well and more accurate x - ray positions were obtained for each x - ray source by correcting for the temperature effect in the satellite acquisition as mentioned in section 2.1 .    in summary , except for 2 clusters of galaxies ,",
    "24 sources were pinpointed by x - ray follow - ups with the _ rosat _ hri or pspc or radio detections , 5 more sources have only one object which is selected by its blue optical color , and the remaining 3 sources have no optical counterpart which meets the above criteria . for these 3 sources , we picked up the brightest optical object within each error circle as a primary target .",
    "the list of the selected objects is shown in table [ id_table ] and , in finding charts of figure [ plate ] , they are labeled with `` a '' , `` b '' , and `` c '' in order of distance from the x - ray centroid . additionally , we listed some objects which were not selected by the above methods but observed in the optical spectroscopy .",
    "these objects were indicated with a label `` z '' .",
