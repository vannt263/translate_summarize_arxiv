    "the investigation of scalar field configurations coupled to gravity started with the work by kaup , @xcite , and ruffini and bonazzola , @xcite .",
    "they regarded a complex scalar field with no self - interactions .",
    "quartic self interactions were taken into account in other works @xcite .",
    "scalar fields with a local @xmath1 symmetry were also investigated @xcite .",
    "the results were generalized in a series of papers in other gravity theories @xcite .",
    "soliton stars appeared in the literature as stable field configurations consisted of abelian or non - abelian scalar fields , containing sometimes fermions or gauge bosons coupled to gravity @xcite .",
    "these configurations are stable even in the absence of gravity .",
    "a certain class of soliton stars are very large field configurations with radius of the order of lightyears @xcite .",
    "they consist of a very large interior with very low energy density of  kinetic \" type resulting from the time variation of the scalar field . on the other hand",
    "the potential energy within the soliton is considered to be negligible . also , the metric and matter fields vary very slowly in the soliton interior . a considerable amount of energy , comparable to that stored in the huge interior , is contained in the thin surface .",
    "within the surface both the potential and the energy resulting from the radial variation of the matter field contribute to the total surface energy , but the contribution of the time variation of the field is very small , as it is supposed to rotate in its internal @xmath1 space extremely slowly .",
    "another class of non - topological soliton stars , the q - stars , appeared as relativistic generalizations of a certain family of non - topological solitons , namely q - balls .",
    "q - balls have a certain role in particle theory and especially in the baryogenesis through the flat mssm directions @xcite .",
    "they appear in lagrangians , @xcite , with a global @xmath1 or @xmath2 , @xmath3 symmetry , or a local @xmath1 @xcite , when the scalar field takes the special value which minimizes the @xmath4 quantity .",
    "the properties of the q - stars have been studied thoroughly in @xcite .",
    "there are q - stars with one or two scalar fields , @xcite , q - stars with non - abelian fields , @xcite , and q - stars with a fermion and a scalar field , @xcite .",
    "these objects contain a large interior within which both metric and matter fields vary smoothly .",
    "the energy within the interior is the sum of the potential energy and of the  kinetic \" energy resulting from the time variation of the matter field . in the case of q - balls and , consequently , the case q - stars the potential is always positive .",
    "we will name @xmath5 , @xmath6 and @xmath7 the potential energy , the energy resulting from the time variation and the energy resulting from the space variation respectively .",
    "there is a crucial relation that roughly describes the q - solitons and differentiates them from other classes of non topological solitons , namely : @xmath8 where @xmath9 is the frequency with which the soliton rotates in its internal @xmath1 space , or , with proper generalizations that we describe , in more complicated spaces , @xmath10 is a typical value of _ the _ or",
    "_ one _ of the scalar field(s ) within the soliton and @xmath11 is the mass of the free particles .",
    "this relation means that @xmath6 is of the same order of magnitude with @xmath5 , in contrast with other non - topological solitons for which the @xmath5 is negligible in the interior and @xmath6 negligible within the surface .",
    "the common feature between q - stars and other soliton stars is the smooth variation of the matter field in the interior and the rapid change , within the surface , from a @xmath12 value to zero . in non - topological soliton stars ,",
    "the energy density within the surface is huge compared to the energy density in the interior , and so , although the surface is very thin , the energy , contained within it , is comparable to the energy stored in the interior .",
    "this does not hold true for the q - stars .",
    "they have an approximately constant energy density in the interior , the sum of @xmath6 and @xmath5 . at the surface",
    ", these quantities retain the same order of magnitude and @xmath7 in now added with the same order of magnitude as well . because the energy density is everywhere of the same order of magnitude , either in the interior , or in the surface , and because the surface is of width of @xmath13 , the total energy of the thin surface is negligible .",
    "it has been proved that q - stars are smaller than non - topological soliton stars but larger than boson stars with no soliton features in the absence of gravity .",
    "gravity in @xmath0 , @xcite , dimensions coupled to scalar fields is studied for many reasons .",
    "one of them is the theoretical interest for a theory qualitatively different from the corresponding theory in @xmath14 dimensions .",
    "the solutions in a @xmath15dimensional theory of gravity are much more simpler because there is no @xmath16 term in the einstein tensor , where @xmath17 is a metric field as we will see .",
    "this can lead even to analytical solutions for special field configurations composed of scalar fields ( or fermion - scalar ) coupled to @xmath15dimensional gravity @xcite .",
    "the aim of the present article is to study the formation of q - stars in @xmath0 dimensions in anti anti de sitter or flat spacetime , as a limiting case .",
    "we want to investigate the matter of their stability with respect to gravitational collapse and to fission into free particles and to study the influence of the global spacetime curvature in the features of the q - star .",
    "we study four different kinds of q - stars , namely , with one and two scalar fields , non - abelian q - stars and fermion - scalar q - stars .",
    "we thoroughly investigate their properties , such as soliton radius , mass , particle number , as functions of either the cosmological constant , which is an absolutely independent parameter , or as functions of their internal frequency , a quantity with crucial role in the theory of non - topological solitons .",
    "we also give analytical solutions for the important case that the cosmological constant tends to zero and also for other cases , which show a very close similarity in their behavior , when compared to solutions obtained with the usual numerical methods .",
    "we consider a static , spherically symmetric metric : @xmath18 with @xmath19 .",
    "we regard a scalar field with the minimum - energy time dependence : @xmath20 the action in natural units for a scalar field coupled to gravity in 2 + 1 dimensions is : @xmath21\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath22 stands for the cosmological constant , regarded here to be negative , or zero , as a limiting case .",
    "the energy - momentum tensor is : @xmath23 -g_{\\mu\\nu}u\\ .\\ ] ] the theory need not be fundamental and , thus , renormalizable but effective .",
    "the euler - lagrange equation for the matter field is : @xmath24\\phi=0\\ , \\ ] ] taking now the form : @xmath25{\\sigma}'+e^{\\lambda } { \\omega}^2e^{-\\nu } \\sigma -e^{\\lambda}\\frac{du}{d{\\sigma}^2}\\sigma=0\\ .\\ ] ] the einstein equations are : @xmath26 with the above assumptions the einstein equations take the form : @xmath27 @xmath28 where @xmath29    there is a noether current : @xmath30 the current is conserved according to the equation : @xmath31 the total charge is defined as : @xmath32 now taking the form @xmath33 this charge represents the total particle number if the charge of each particle is unity . in the present case",
    "the energy of the free particles with the same charge is @xmath34 , where @xmath11 is the mass of the free particles .",
    "we rescale all the parameters of the lagrangian with respect to the mass , and set @xmath11 eqaul to unity .",
    "so , if the total charge is less than the total mass of the field configuration , the star is stable with respect to decay into free particles .",
    "we define for convenience : @xmath35 and rescale : @xmath36 where @xmath11 in generally is a mass scale , here the mass of the scalar field .",
    "we also make the rescalings @xmath37    inside the soliton both metric and matter fields vary very slowly with respect to the radius .",
    "this leads to a considerable simplification to both einstein and lagrange equations .",
    "we see that @xmath38 which is very small compared to the other energy quantities .",
    "@xmath39 is the ( unrescaled ) soliton radius and @xmath40 and @xmath41 correspond to the rescaled radii , according to the rescalings under [ 1.16 ] and [ 1.17 ] respectively .",
    "so , ignoring the @xmath42 quantities and dropping the tildes the einstein equations take the form : @xmath43 @xmath44 and the euler - lagrange equation is : @xmath45 a rescaled potential admitting q - ball type solutions in the absence of gravity is : @xmath46 the solution to the eq .",
    "[ 1.20 ] is : @xmath47 and @xmath5 is : @xmath48    within the thin surface the metric and matter fields change rapidly .",
    "we can write the lagrange equation in the following form ( unrescaled quantities ) : @xmath49 there is a certain form for the @xmath50 metric component ( unrescaled quantities ) , @xcite , @xcite : @xmath51 where @xmath52 is the total energy density contained within a sphere of radius @xmath53 and @xmath54 is the spacetime dimensionality , here equal to @xmath55 .",
    "the above relation can be verified numerically and will be discussed more extensively when dealing with q - stars with two scalar fields , which offer a richer variety of analytical solutions . using the relation holding within the surface approximately namely the : @xmath56 and rescaling in the usual way , we find that : @xmath57 where we regarded that within the surface the field decreases from a @xmath58 value to zero and that @xmath59 . also , the surface width is @xmath60 .",
    "so , dropping the @xmath61 quantities , we find : @xmath62 because at the outer edge of the surface all energy quantities are zero , we find a first integral to the above equation : @xmath63 eqs . [ 1.25a]-[1.27 ] hold true only within the surface . at the inner edge of the surface",
    "@xmath64 is zero in order to match the interior with the surface solution .",
    "so , at the inner edge of the surface the equality @xmath65 , together with eqs . [ 1.22 ] , [ 1.23 ] , gives the eigenvalue equation for @xmath9 : @xmath66 which has the right limiting value when gravity is absent , i.e. : @xmath67 .",
    "so , @xmath68 , apart from a certain parameter referring to the soliton properties , is also a measure for the gravity strength , equivalent to the metrics . the same discussion , eqs .",
    "[ 1.24]-[1.28 ] , holds true in any case of q - star .    solving the einstein equations and in order to find the soliton parameters , we use the @xmath69 component of the einstein tensor for the calculation of the energy or , equivalently , the form @xmath70 ( rescaled quantities ) arising from eq .",
    "[ 1.25 ] , and eq . [ 1.14 ] for the calculation of the charge .",
    "the thin surface has a negligible energy and charge contribution .",
    "the independent variables are two : the cosmological constant , a global feature of the spacetime , and the soliton frequency .    outside the soliton",
    "the energy quantities are all zero .",
    "einstein equations can be solved analytically : @xmath71 @xmath72 with @xmath73 the star radius and @xmath74 the total mass .",
    "the same relations hold true for every case of q - star we discuss .    , [ figure2.1 ] , [ figure3.1 ] and [ figure4.2]-[figure4.5 ] denote the absolute value of the cosmological constant .",
    "we start from a large value of the metric at the surface , @xmath75 , near unity , corresponding to the weak gravity limit .",
    "the values of the energy and charge are small . as we decrease the metric the values of energy and charge increase . if @xmath76 and when reaching a certain value of @xmath75 , then energy and charge decrease .",
    "the initial increase in the energy and charge values is not visible in the @xmath77 case , because it takes place nearly to the maximum energy and for a short range of the surface gravity parameter . ]    .",
    "the frequency can be obtained using relation [ 1.28 ] . for zero cosmological constant the field is everywhere constant within the soliton , equal to @xmath78 .",
    "as the cosmological constant increases in absolute values the field takes larger values as a reflection of the increase in the gravity strength . also , the field has larger values when @xmath9 decreases , because small @xmath9 indicates stronger gravity . ]    . ]    . ]    .",
    "we find that radius , energy and charge increase for small absolute values of the cosmological constant but for larger values they decrease . ]",
    "we will now give the analytic solution holding true when @xmath79 .",
    "in this case the metric @xmath80 is constant everywhere and the other parameters of the soliton are given in the following equations : @xmath81 @xmath82 @xmath83 @xmath84 @xmath85 in the above equations @xmath73 is the soliton radius determined when @xmath86 and @xmath75 is the value of the @xmath87 at the surface of the star .",
    "there are some interesting results obtained when investigating the properties of the analytical solution .",
    "the total soliton energy is : @xmath88 this agrees with the intuitive result that the total energy is analogous to the  volume \" of the field configuration .",
    "also , @xmath89 the rescaled mass of the free particles for every @xmath90 for the case of zero cosmological constant .",
    "this means that there is no possibility for the soliton fission to free particles , because this procedure is energetically forbidden . from the @xmath91 relation and eq . [ 1.29 ] we find that in a flat spacetime , the scalar field has an everywhere constant absolute value , here equal to @xmath92 .",
    "so , when @xmath93 , i.e. : when a horizon is going to be formed , there is no anomaly at the center of the star .    in our figures",
    ", every dashed line corresponds to an analytical solution .",
    "the total energy is in @xmath94 units , the particle number in @xmath95 units , with @xmath96 and the soliton radius in @xmath97 units . in figures [ figure1.2]-[figure1.5 ] starting with an initial zero value of the cosmological constant , we increase its absolute value and terminate our calculations when the soliton energy equates to the energy of free particles with the same charge . in figure [ figure1.1 ]",
    "we start from a large value of the metric field @xmath75 , near unity , or , equivalently , a large value of the characteristic soliton frequency , near @xmath98 ( which according to eq . [ 1.28 ] is the maximum limiting value of the frequency when gravity is absent , i.e. , when @xmath99 ) and gradually decrease the frequency .",
    "we can observe , as a general comment of our numerical results depicted in figures [ figure1.1]-[figure1.5 ] , that the effect of the increase , in absolute values , of the cosmological constant causes a consequent increase in the energy , charge and radius of the q - star .",
    "this is a counter - balancing effect : negative cosmological constant means that different particles within the soliton , corresponding to the @xmath10 field , tend to move along deviating geodesics .",
    "so , the increase in mass and the other soliton parameters is necessary in order the object to avoid this kind of  deviation \" , or , in other words , to generate  positive \" gravity as opposed to the  negative \" gravity , generated by the negative cosmological constant .",
    "but when cosmological constant becomes considerably large ( i.e. when @xmath22 is larger than @xmath100 or @xmath101 or , equivalently , when @xmath102 is larger than @xmath103 or @xmath104 ) then no soliton energy contribution can prevent this  deviation \" , apart from a shrinking in the soliton magnitude and a consequent decrease in the soliton mass and particle number .    figure [ figure1.1 ] gives more interesting results .",
    "we start from an @xmath9 near the critical value @xmath98 holding true in the absence of gravity .",
    "the field configuration is a small one , with small energy and charge .",
    "when decreasing @xmath9 ( or @xmath75 ) gravity becomes more important and the soliton becomes larger and more massive .",
    "there is an interesting point , common in similar diagrams of other kinds of q - stars .",
    "decreasing frequency both energy and charge increase , but only until the frequency reaches a certain point , below which the two quantities decrease .",
    "so for a certain charge there are usually two values of the energy , the lower one corresponding to high frequency ( lower branch of the @xmath105 diagram ) and the higher one corresponding to low frequency ( upper branch of the @xmath105 diagram ) .",
    "so , a soliton star with a certain charge and a high energy amount can emit the energy excess , falling down to the lower branch , changing of course its frequency .",
    "we will study this case in more details when treating fermion - scalar q - stars , for which there is an analytical solution for a special @xmath76 case and the obtained relations are simpler than in the case of q - stars with two scalar fields .",
    "this change in the energy and charge variation with respect to the frequency happens only when the cosmological constant differs from zero .",
    "the above analytical solution given for the zero cosmological constant case predicts that both energy and charge are monotone decreasing functions of the frequency .",
    "when @xmath93 one expects that a black hole is formed .",
    "but the calculations depicted in figure [ figure1.1 ] interrupted for an @xmath106 value , because below that certain value the star decays into free particles as the energetically favorable choice .",
    "this means that before the formation of an horizon , the q - star decays .",
    "so , when @xmath76 gravitational collapse is impossible , at least in the usual way of decreasing frequency holding true for q - stars in @xmath14 dimensions , @xcite-@xcite .",
    "there may be a possibility of forming q - type black holes , if one takes into account the spatial variation of the scalar field , but this demands a considerably different way of solving the equations of motion to the one known so far .",
    "the same discussion holds true for any sort of q - star .",
    "a first simple generalization to the above described soliton is a field configuration with two scalar fields , one n - carrying @xmath10 , and , consequently , complex , and the other , @xmath107 , used to constrain the n - carrying field within a certain region , generating an appropriate potential , taken to be real for simplicity .",
    "the lagrangian in the case under discussion is : @xmath108 and the metric is supposed to have the same form as in the q - star with one scalar field , i.e. to be static and spherically symmetric .",
    "the potential has the general form : @xmath109 we paramertize @xmath110 as : @xmath111 where the parameter @xmath112 has mass dimensions , is nothing more than a way of re - expressing @xmath110 , is of the same order of magnitude as the potential parameters and will simplify the rescalings of the energy quantities .",
    "we now rescale the matter fields @xmath113 we also define : @xmath114 and the potential takes the simple form : @xmath115 the rescalings in the other quantities ( spacetime and frequency ) are the same as in eq .",

    "dropping from now on the tildes , the einstein equations take the form : @xmath126 @xmath127 the soliton mass is given by the @xmath69 component of the einstein tensor and the particle number is : @xmath128    outside the soliton we take @xmath121 to be everywhere zero and @xmath107 equal to unity , so that both the energy density and noether current are zero .",
    "these values are also solutions to the lagrange equations of the matter fields .        carrying field at the center of the field configuration as a function of the cosmological constant for a q - star with two scalar fields for four values of @xmath75 , or equivalently , the frequency .",

    "we can also find the relation for the energy @xmath136 stored within a surface of radius @xmath137 : @xmath138 which verifies relation [ 1.25 ] , when combined with eq . [ 2.17 ] .",

    "then , @xmath146 and below this value of the surface metric the energy of the free particles with the same charge is less than the soliton energy , making in this way stars with @xmath75 below that critical value unstable .",

    "the euler - lagrange equation for the scalar field is : @xmath207 an appropriate form for the potential is : @xmath208 the proper generalization in order to include gravity in our discussion is to replace the fermi energy with a global chemical potential , according to the equation [ 4.14 ] , @xcite . in this way",
    "the fermi energy takes the proper generally covariant form , being the zero component of the energy - momentum @xmath209vector .",
    "the generalization of the lagrangian with the inclusion of gravity is straightforward : @xmath210 the proper rescalings for the case under discussion are made with respect to a new mass scale @xmath112 equal to @xmath211 , simplifying in this way the potential and extracting a @xmath212 factor from the lagrangian .",
    "so the quantities in the lagrangian are rescaled in the following way : @xmath213 we also make two new redefinitions : @xmath214    so , dropping the tildes we can regard that inside the soliton the matter field derivative with respect to the radius is of order of @xmath215 so the euler - lagrange equation for the scalar field can be written : @xmath216 the energy - momentum tensor is : @xmath217\\ .\\ ] ] we define a global chemical potential @xmath218 through the equation : @xmath219 this quantity retains a role similar to the frequency of the other kinds of soliton stars .",
    "the particle number is : @xmath220 the einstein equations take the form : @xmath221 @xmath222    within the surface we repeat the discussion of eqs . [",
    "1.24]-[1.27 ] and find from eq .",
    "[ 4.12 ] : @xmath223 this is the eigenvalue equation for the chemical potential .",
    "the einstein equations take the soluble form : @xmath224 @xmath225 the total charge is : @xmath226 for our numerical calculations we use @xmath227 .    outside the soliton",
    "we regard that @xmath107 is everywhere unity and @xmath228 zero , so both energy density and current are zero .     or , equivalently , the chemical potential for a fermionic q - star .",
    "we start from a small value of the cosmological constant .",
    "both energy and charge have small values . when increasing the cosmological constant , in absolute values , both energy and charge increase in order the soliton to generate  positive \" gravity as a counter effect to the  negative \" gravity from the spacetime structure .",
    "but when @xmath22 takes very large absolute values , a large soliton can not be stable and mass , charge and radius decrease as one can see from figures [ figure4.1]-[figure4.4 ] . ]",
    "is large the gravity strength according to the eq .",
    "[ 4.18 ] is small . ]             close to unity , according to eq .",
    "[ 4.18 ] ) and , consequently , weak gravity .",
    "then both charge and energy have small values . decreasing @xmath218",
    "both energy and charge increase up to a certain value of the chemical potential , below which they both decrease . ]",
    "let us now take @xmath79 . in that case",
    "the einstein equations admit the following analytical solution , also verified numerically : @xmath229 we can easily find that the parameters of the soliton are : @xmath230}^{1/2}= { \\left[\\left(1- { \\left(\\frac{2}{3\\pi}\\right)}^{2/3}{\\omega}_{\\psi}^2\\right)\\frac{8}{3}\\right]}^{1/2}\\ , \\ ] ] @xmath231\\pi\\ , \\ ] ] @xmath232\\ , \\ ] ] where @xmath73 is the soliton radius , @xmath74 the total mass and @xmath148 the soliton charge .    we will now examine a different case admitting analytical solutions , namely : @xmath233 in that case einstein equations take the form @xmath234 @xmath235 we can find the soliton radius : @xmath236 the metrics take the form : @xmath237 @xmath238 we can also find the energy and charge : @xmath239 @xmath240 for both the analytically soluble cases the chemical potential @xmath218 varies from the maximum value obtained by the eq . [ 4.18 ] ( equal to @xmath241 for these stars ) when the minimum value is obtained equating the soliton energy with the energy of the free particles with the same charge . when @xmath242 this equation has no solution and no decay to free particles is possible .",
    "in the latter case the minimum value is @xmath243 .",
    "we will now examine the @xmath244 analytical solution in more details because in the fermion - scalar soliton stars we face the simpler relations when compared with those resulting from the investigation of the solitons with two scalar fields .",
    "with the help of figure [ figure4.5 ] we see that the @xmath105 function has two branches , a lower corresponding to large values of @xmath75 , or , equivalently , @xmath218 , and the upper one corresponding to small values of the above quantities .",
    "the boundary separating the two areas is determined by the solution of the equations @xmath245 the solution to both of the above equations is only one : @xmath246 for @xmath247 energy and charge are monotone decreasing functions of the chemical potential , but they are both monotone increasing for @xmath248 .",
    "the charge shows a more rapid decrease .    solving eq .",
    "[ 4.33 ] in terms of @xmath75 for simplicity we find two solutions , called @xmath249 and @xmath250 corresponding to the upper and lower branches respectively of the the @xmath105 function .",
    "these solutions are : @xmath251 @xmath252 the metric of the eq .",
    "[ 4.35 ] is the small one ( less than @xmath253 ) when the the metric of eq .",
    "[ 4.36 ] is the large one . substituting in eq .",
    "[ 4.32 ] we find the energies corresponding to the two branches : @xmath254 the large value of the energy corresponding to the upper branch and : @xmath255 the small one .",
    "our discussion can be summarized as follows :    \\1 . there are stable , gravitating field configurations , in @xmath0 dimensions , consisted of a @xmath256carrying field , fermionic , or scalar ( abelian or non - abelian ) .",
    "an always positive potential , generated either by the the @xmath256carrying field , or by an additional real scalar field , is necessary in order to stabilize the soliton .",
    "the potential as a function of the field @xmath10 increases as @xmath257 for small values of the field , then slower than @xmath257 providing in this way a local minimum for some value of the field differing from zero and for large values of the field as @xmath258 , or @xmath259 usually , in order to ensure the positivity of the potential for large values of the field .",
    "the soliton solution lies near this minimum and the total energy of the star is smaller than @xmath260 , i.e. the potential energy of the free particles in any field configuration under consideration .",
    "there is always a certain frequency , minimizing the total energy of the configuration , obtained by the equality of the @xmath261energy to the @xmath262energy .",
    "this equality holds true in the absence of gravity and is generalized in a generally covariant way .",
    "when @xmath76 and @xmath93 the particle number decreases rapidly but the total energy decreases slowly , as one can see from figures [ figure1.1 ] , [ figure2.1 ] , [ figure3.1 ] and [ figure4.5 ] .",
    "so , the @xmath263 case ( formation of horizon ) is impossible , because below a certain value of @xmath75 fission into free particles is energetically favorable .",
    "this result is supported by both numerical and analytical solutions .",
    "decay into free particles is energetically forbidden for zero cosmological constant , as can be proved by the analytical solutions for every special kind of q - star . for cosmological constant differing from zero , the energy and the charge of the soliton increase when the gravity becomes stronger ( i.e. : when @xmath75 decreases ) but below a certain value of the frequency energy decreases slowly and charge more rapidly .",
    "the result is that for a certain charge there are usually two different values of the energy .",
    "so the soliton with the larger energy can emit the energy excess and goes to the lower - energy state .",
    "due to the above behavior of the @xmath105 function , we found analytically and numerically that below a certain value of the frequency the soliton decay to free particles is energetically favorable , so when the cosmological constant differs from zero there is a certain range of the soliton parameters ( the independent parameter , frequency , and the derivative ones , radius , energy and charge ) which verify the soliton stability .",
    "this range of the phase space parameters is fully depicted in our figures .",
    "when the cosmological constant is zero or small with respect to the energy densities ( namely @xmath5 and @xmath6 ) , the soliton parameters , radius , mass and particle number , increase when the frequency decreases , i.e. when the gravity becomes stronger .",
    "when the cosmological constant becomes more important than the energy densities , the soliton becomes smaller and the mass and particle number show a corresponding decrease .",
