    "hence there is one 7-loop @xmath24-point counterterm for each singlet in the decomposition of the symmetric tensor product of @xmath166 @xmath167 s . with increasing @xmath168",
    "there is a ( swiftly ) increasing number of singlets , as illustrated by the explicit multiplicities up to @xmath169 in table  [ ourfigure ] .",
    "consequently , there is an infinite ` tower ' of independent 7-loop operators that are potential counterterms .",
    "operators corresponding to their ssl are also listed in table  [ ourfigure ] .",
    "their construction is similar , and their multiplicities is the number of @xmath167 s in a product of @xmath170 @xmath167 s .      consider the leading @xmath24-point matrix elements of a local counterterm @xmath88 . if non - vanishing , the ssl produces a local @xmath171-matrix element , which can be generated by an @xmath171-point local operator @xmath172 in the @xmath85 .",
    "locality of @xmath88 ensures that the ssl operation @xmath173 commutes with the susy generators @xmath154 and @xmath155 . for a long - multiplet ( @xmath174 ) counterterm @xmath175",
    "we can therefore write @xmath176 @xmath3 requires that the ssl vanishes .",
    "now there are two ways to obtain @xmath177 : either the single - soft limit of @xmath99 vanishes ( @xmath178 ) , or @xmath179 is annihilated by @xmath98 . at the seven - loop level , @xmath180 consists of only scalars with no derivatives , and consequently @xmath181 .",
    "@xmath99 is also not annihilated by @xmath98 because @xmath182 in a @xmath167 satisfies a shortening condition only for @xmath183 .",
    "therefore , all 7-loop linearized counterterms with @xmath10 have non - vanishing single - soft scalar limits and thus violate @xmath3 .",
    "( this was also observed in  @xcite ; see  @xcite for discussion of non - perturbative aspects . )",
    "these operators may , however , play an important role as dependent terms in the non - linear completion of the @xmath11 operator , as we demonstrated above at the @xmath21-point level .",
    "we now show that all our findings on @xmath3-(in)compatibility of operators have a natural explanation in terms of the multiplicities of ssl operators in the @xmath85 that is displayed in table  [ ourfigure].-point , its higher - point matrix elements will generically have _ non - local _",
    "ssl s , which are not classified by our analysis . ]",
    "let us first revisit the case of @xmath0 and @xmath1 . at the @xmath184- and @xmath21-loop level , there are no potential @xmath185-point or @xmath15-point ssl operators available",
    ". therefore the matrix elements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 must have vanishing soft limits at @xmath15- and @xmath184-points , and this is indeed the case .",
    "there exists , however , one potential @xmath184-point ssl operator at @xmath186 and @xmath187 .",
    "generically , one expects the soft - limits of the @xmath21-point matrix elements of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to be proportional to this operator with some non - vanishing coefficient .",
    "this is precisely what happens .    at @xmath5 loops with @xmath10 points ,",
    "the number @xmath188 of ssl operators @xmath189 is always at least as large as the number @xmath190 of potential counterterms @xmath191 .",
    "generically , one therefore expects the soft limits of the potential counterterms to span an @xmath190-dimensional subspace in the @xmath192-dimensional space of ssl operators .",
    "it would follow that all potential counterterms with @xmath10 violate @xmath3 .",
    "indeed , this is what we explicitly proved above for the @xmath5-loop case .    by the same logic",
    ", it is not at all surprising that there is a non - linear supersymmetrization of @xmath11 that preserves @xmath3 at the @xmath21-point level . the number of @xmath184-point ssl operators precisely matches the number of @xmath150 operators .",
    "therefore , the @xmath21-point soft limit of @xmath11 can be made to vanish after adding an appropriate combination of the two @xmath150 operators , just as we found above . for the @xmath161-point soft limits of @xmath11 , however , there are 4 ssl operators available ; more than the @xmath185 potential @xmath161-point counterterms @xmath7 .",
    "if the @xmath161-point soft limits of @xmath11 take a generic value in the @xmath15-dimensional space of ssl operators , no linear combination of @xmath7 operators can be chosen to give an @xmath3-preserving supersymmetrization of @xmath11 ; a remarkable cancellation is thus required for @xmath11 to be compatible with @xmath3 .    as table  [ ourfigure ] illustrates , @xmath3 becomes more and more constraining as we increase the number of points and loops .",
    "for example , the @xmath51-point soft limits of @xmath193 have to lie in a specific @xmath194-dimensional subspace of the @xmath195-dimensional space of ssl operators in order for @xmath193 to satisfy @xmath3 after an appropriate addition of independent @xmath51-point operators .",
    "it follows that @xmath3 is a very constraining symmetry even for @xmath26 and beyond .",
    "although there is an infinite tower of independent counterterms at each of loop @xmath174 , we can not expect any of these operators to preserve @xmath3 ` accidentally ' .",
    "there may , however , be a very good reason for the cancellations of terms that is needed for @xmath3-invariant operators to exist for @xmath196 ; namely , when there is a construction of a manifestly @xmath3-invariant supersymmetric operator  . at the @xmath5-loop level ,",
    "for example , we can only expect the @xmath161-point single - soft limits of @xmath11 to vanish after an appropriate addition of @xmath7 , if the manifestly @xmath3-invariant superspace integral that was proposed as a candidate counterterm in  @xcite is indeed non - vanishing .",
    "one new feature that emerges at @xmath197 is the existence of @xmath10 operators that have vanishing soft - limits at the linearized level .",
    "this holds for the mhv operators @xmath198 , @xmath199 and @xmath200 as well as for at least @xmath5 of the @xmath201 nmhv operators .",
    "the latter follows from the multiplicity @xmath184 of @xmath184-point ssl operators at 9 loops .",
    "@xmath3-invariance beyond the linearized level , however , is a highly non - trivial constraint on all of these operators .",
