    "the evidence for non zero neutrino mass and mixing is , at present , the only solid experimental hint for physics beyond the standard model .",
    "flavor oscillations  @xcite are the privileged tool to explore the neutrino mass and mixing parameter space . at present , there are three experimental indications in favor of neutrino flavor oscillations : 1 ) the evidence for @xmath0 appearance from a @xmath3 beam in the liquid scintillator neutrino detector ( lsnd )  @xcite ; 2 ) the evidence for @xmath0 disappearance in the solar neutrino flux  @xcite ; 3 ) the strong evidence for @xmath3 suppression in the atmospheric neutrino flux , together with the evidence of @xmath4dependence of such suppression , in superkamiokande ( sk )  @xcite , as well as in macro and soudan 2  @xcite .",
    "any of the above pieces of evidence requires a different mass scale : @xmath5 for lsnd , @xmath6 for atmospheric neutrinos , and @xmath7 for solar neutrinos . to account for all of them",
    "we need at least one sterile neutrino .",
    "anyway , the evidence coming from lsnd is , at the moment , controversial . for this reason ,",
    "waiting for an independent confirmation of the lsnd result , we prefer to discard this datum and to analyze only the solar and atmospheric evidence of oscillation in a `` standard '' scenario with three active neutrinos .",
    "in addition , we consider also the negative evidence coming from chooz @xcite . such 1 km ",
    "baseline reactor experiment has not found any evidence for @xmath0 disappearance . as we will see , this negative result has a strong impact in constraining the @xmath8 parameter space .",
    "( similar conclusions have also been derived by gonzales ",
    "et al . _",
    "flavor eigenstates are related to mass eigenstates through the mixing matrix @xmath9 : @xmath10 where @xmath11 .",
    "we stick in the `` one mass scale dominance hypothesis '' , i.e. , @xmath12 . in this hypothesis  that will be proved _ a posteriori _  cp violating effects are unobservable and the matrix elements @xmath13 can be considered , without loss of generality , real . moreover , atmospheric ( and , eventually , chooz ) neutrino oscillations probe the flavor composition of the `` lone '' state @xmath14 and can be described by the subspace @xmath15 .",
    "conversely , solar neutrino oscillations can probe the mass composition of the @xmath0 and can be described by the subspace @xmath16 .",
    "the only common parameter that can be probed both by solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations is @xmath17 .",
    "we have performed an updated analysis  @xcite of the latest ( 70.5 kty ) data from sk  @xcite and chooz  @xcite .",
    "the details of the analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "the sk data include 55 zenith bins : 10 + 10 bins for the subgev @xmath19+@xmath20 events , 10 + 10 bins for the multigev @xmath19+@xmath20 events , and 5 + 10 bins for the upward stopping ( us ) and through - going @xmath20 events . for chooz , we use the 14 experimental bins .    [ cols=\"^,^ \" , ]     the result of the analysis is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : atmos ] , where the unitarity triangle introduced in  @xcite has been used . a point inside each triangle in fig .",
    "[ fig : atmos ] represents a generic combination of the flavor eigenstates ( for a fixed @xmath21 ) , the mixing matrix elements @xmath22 , @xmath23 , and @xmath24 being identified with the projected heights onto the @xmath25@xmath3 , @xmath25@xmath0 , and @xmath3@xmath0 `` sides '' respectively . using a well known property of the triangles with equal sides , the unitarity relation @xmath26 is thus satisfied .    the triangles on the left of fig .",
    "[ fig : atmos ] show the zones allowed using sk atmospheric data only , for five representative values of @xmath21 .",
    "the absence of @xmath0 distorsion in the atmospheric flux tends excludes pure @xmath27 oscillations , although a moderate mixing of @xmath0 is still allowed by sk data .",
    "the best fit is reached for @xmath28 ev@xmath29 and pure maximal @xmath30 mixing ( @xmath31 and @xmath32 ) .",
    "the middle column of triangles show the zones allowed by chooz . in this experiment",
    "no signal of @xmath0 disappearance has been found .",
    "this is crucial in constraining the mixing between @xmath14 and @xmath0 .",
    "the zones allowed by chooz are shaped as horizontal strips near the bottom ( corresponding to small values of @xmath22 ) and near the @xmath0 corner ( corresponding to @xmath33 ) .",
    "the last solution is , however , incompatible both with solar and atmospheric neutrino oscillations .",
    "the triangles on the right show the combined sk+chooz analysis . only a very small zone , around pure maximal @xmath30 oscillations ,",
    "is allowed .",
    "solutions disappear at 99% c.l . for @xmath34 ev@xmath29 and @xmath35 ev@xmath29 .",
    "the best fit is reached again for @xmath36 ev@xmath29 and pure maximal @xmath30 mixing . in particular , the upper limit on @xmath17",

    "in this section we present an updated analysis  @xcite of the solar neutrino data ( total rates and sk day and night recoil spectrum , as presented at the _ neutrino 2000 _ conference  @xcite ) , as well as of the latest theoretical solar @xmath18 fluxes and uncertainties  @xcite .",
    "the details of the analysis can be found in  @xcite .",
    "moreover , we have included the chooz constraints on @xmath17 . in this case , it is necessary to fix the value of @xmath21 , since the leading oscillations in chooz are driven by the higher mass gap ( @xmath21 ) .    in figure 2",
    "we show the results of the analysis for @xmath38 and @xmath39 ev@xmath29 ( corresponding , respectively , to the best fit and to the lowest value allowed by atmospheric @xmath18 oscillations ) , and for increasing values of @xmath17 .",
    "the case @xmath40 corresponds to the usual @xmath41 analysis , with the identification @xmath42 .",
    "the best fit is reached for @xmath40 , @xmath43 , and @xmath44 ev@xmath29 .",
    "the solution at small mixing angle is disfavored by the lack of the evidence of distorsion in the sk spectrum .",
    "solar neutrinos alone prefer @xmath40 , although the upper limit on @xmath17 is weak ( @xmath45 @xcite ) .    for increasing values of @xmath17",
    "the solutions rapidly disappear because they become incompatible with chooz .",
    "in particular , the upper limit at 99% c.l . on @xmath17 is @xmath37 for @xmath46 ev@xmath29 .",
    "the inclusion of chooz in the analysis also strongly constrain the upper value of @xmath47 : @xmath48 ev@xmath29 at 99% c.l . for such high values of @xmath49",
    "the one mass scale dominance is valid only approximatively . for this reasons",
    "the subleading effects of nonzero @xmath47 in chooz and finite @xmath21 in solar analysis have been taken into account in the analysis .",
    "we have presented an updated @xmath8 analysis of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly and the solar neutrino deficit together with the negative evidence coming from chooz .",
    "atmospheric neutrinos prefer almost pure @xmath50 oscillations with large mixing between @xmath3 and @xmath25 and @xmath51 \\times 10^{-3}$ ] ev@xmath29 .",
    "in particular , the best fit is reached for maximal pure @xmath3@xmath25 mixing .",
    "solar neutrinos still allow a multiplicity of solutions ( with @xmath52 ev@xmath29 ) , although large @xmath53@xmath54 mixing is preferred . the combined analysis with chooz",
    "strongly constrains the @xmath17 mixing ( @xmath55 ) .",
    "in particular , a theoretical attractive scenario , called `` bimaximal mixing '' ( @xmath56 , @xmath57 )  @xcite is allowed .",
    "the goal for the next generations of experiments is to constrain more tightly the parameter space(s ) and eventually to check ( or disprove ) non  standard solutions of the current evidences of neutrino oscillations .",
