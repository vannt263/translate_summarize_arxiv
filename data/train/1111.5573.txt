    "clusters of galaxies are important probes of cosmology , as they complement other observations , including type ia supernov@xmath7 ( e.g. riess et al .",
    "1998 ; perlmutter et al . 1999 ) and the cosmic microwave background ( e.g. komatsu et al . 2009 ) , in building the currently favoured `` concordance cosmology '' model . as the largest gravitationally bound systems in the universe , galaxy clusters trace the growth of structure , which in turn strongly depends on the cosmological parameters ( for recent reviews on clusters in a cosmological context , see e.g. voit 2005 ; allen , evrard & mantz 2011 )",
    ". however , galaxy clusters can provide useful cosmological information only if their mass , composed predominantly of dark matter ( dm ) , can be measured accurately enough .",
    "given the elusive nature of dm , this can be achieved only through indirect methods , e.g. by measuring orbital velocities of galaxies ( e.g. zwicky 1933 , 1937 ) , by gravitational lensing techniques ( e.g. zwicky 1937 ) , or through studying the intracluster medium ( see reviews by e.g. sarazin 1986 ; bhringer & werner 2010 ) .",
    "the intracluster medium is the hot , x - ray emitting gas that to first order is in thermal equilibrium with the cluster gravitational potential .",
    "one of the most commonly used models for galaxy clusters utilises a king ( 1962 ) profile to describe the total gravitational potential with the isothermal gas in thermal equilibrium .",
    "solving the hydrostatic equilibrium ( he ) equation , the resulting profile , referred to as the @xmath8-model ( cavaliere & fusco - femiano 1976 , 1978 ) , is widely utilised to describe radial profiles of clusters .",
    "however , detailed x - ray observations of individual clusters have shown clear radial gradients in their temperature profiles , hence calling into question the assumption of isothermality .",
    "one of the simplest extensions of the isothermal model is to assume a polytropic relation , wherein gas density and pressure ( or temperature ) are related by a simple power law .",
    "this description naturally provides radial temperature gradients . a polytropic relation is indeed expected in ideal adiabatic processes , with the polytropic index in those cases being equal to the ratio of specific heats at constant pressure and constant volume .",
    "this value of the exponent , however , does not appear to be consistent with observations ( e.g. bode , ostriker & vikhlinin 2009 and references therein ) , suggesting that the polytropic relation is not an equation of state .",
    "although the origin of the observed polytropic relation is still a puzzle ( but see bertschinger 1985 for a possible explanation ) , he - polytropic solutions have been considered since the early 1970s ( e.g. lea 1975 ) .",
    "hybrid descriptions have also been considered , where the polytropic relation and the @xmath8-model description for the gas density are employed simultaneously ( markevitch et al . 1998 ; ettori 2000 ; sanderson et al .",
    "2003 ; ascasibar et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "numerical prescriptions of dm have advanced to the point where we are fairly certain about the profile of the dm potential ( e.g. navarro , frenk & white 1996 : nfw ) .",
    "suto , sasaki & makino ( 1998 ) first derived the he - polytropic solution in the case of a gravitational potential described by an nfw profile .",
    "the concept is simple : once the dm has been completely described ( in the case of nfw , by only two parameters , e.g. virial mass and concentration ) , the gas is analytically described with just three free parameters : the polytropic index and the values of two gas quantities , chosen amongst e.g. density , pressure and temperature , at some given radius ( usually zero or infinity ) .",
    "extracting these three gas parameters and checking results with observations is not entirely straightforward .",
    "radial profiles of individual clusters ( e.g. pratt et al . 2007 ; arnaud et al .",
    "2010 ) can provide some hints , but resolution limits and scatter prevent us from obtaining accurate constraints on the three unknown scalars introduced above .",
    "moreover , any uncertainty in the dm profile makes the constraining more difficult .",
    "more global scaling relations between cluster mass , temperature and luminosity , on the other hand , can be very helpful .",
    "if one has a model for the temperature profile , then one can also calculate the average temperature and obtain a theoretical mass - temperature ( @xmath9@xmath10 ) relation that can be easily compared to observations ( e.g. vikhlinin et al .",
    "2006 ; vikhlinin et al .",
    "2009 : v09 ; sun et al . 2009 : s09 ) .",
    "this is what we largely pursue in this paper .",
    "since these average quantities are usually computed after excising the central region of the cluster , any uncertainty in the properties of the inner parts of the dm halo becomes unimportant . on the other hand ,",
    "any change in the outer regions of the cluster can produce significant effects on the average quantities .",
    "for this reason , we do not limit ourselves to the nfw profile , but use its generalised version by bulbul et al .",
    "( 2010 : b10 ) , in which the dm logarithmic slope at large radii is not fixed . for completeness ,",
    "given the uncertainty in the mass - concentration relation , we also let the concentration vary , thus having two dm free parameters .",
    "the choice of the three primary gas quantities and the method for constraining them vary between authors .",
    "komatsu & seljak ( 2001 : ks01 ) , in their description of a universal gas profile , assume that the gas density profile is equal to that of dm in the outer regions of the dm halo ( assumed to be described by an nfw profile ) , obtaining a constraint on both the polytropic index and the central gas temperature .",
    "their assumption is reasonable and very powerful , as it gives constraints on the polytropic index itself , which has not been done in other studies .",
    "however , it predicts an @xmath9@xmath10 relation which is not in good agreement with recent x - ray observations . also , the gas profile is not completely described , as it needs a second constraint to fix the central density .",
    "komatsu & seljak ( 2002 : ks02 ) provide such a constraint by requiring that the gas density in the outer regions of the dm halo is equal to the dm density multiplied by the cosmic baryon fraction .",
    "ascasibar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , investigating the differences between polytropic relations and @xmath8-models , fix instead the polytropic index as an output from their numerical simulations and obtain constraints on the central gas temperature and density , by imposing the gas density to be zero at infinity and the baryon fraction to never exceed the cosmic value .",
    "ascasibar et al .",
    "( 2006 : a06 ) , studying the origin of self - similar scaling relations , use a similar method , with the slight difference that the baryon fraction at three times the dm scale radius must be equal to the cosmic value .    more recently , a series of papers ( ostriker , bode & babul 2005 ; bode et al .",
    "2007 ; bode et al .",
    "2009 ) have explored in detail models with polytropic gas in he with a dm potential , adding additional physics such as star formation and feedback , in the form of simple recipes .",
    "similar to the approach of ascasibar et al . ( 2003 ) and a06 , ostriker et al .",
    "( 2005 ) take the polytropic index as a given ( from numerical simulations and observations ) and additionally constrain the central gas pressure and density by imposing conservation of energy and by matching the external surface pressure to the momentum flux from the infalling gas at the virial radius .",
    "the second constraint arises from a sharp truncation in the dm profile at the virial radius , adopted by ostriker et al .",
    "( 2005 ) , but not contemplated in ks01 , ks02 , ascasibar et al .",
    "( 2003 ) , a06 , nor in this paper . by adding terms to the energy conservation equation , they are able to discriminate between simple feedback recipes when matching the resulting models to observations .    in this paper",
    ", we assume that an ideal polytropic gas is in he with the dm in groups and clusters of galaxies and explore the consequences of the polytropic solution , considering different ways to specify the three primary gas quantities and the two free dm parameters .",
    "this is done assuming no prior knowledge of either the polytropic index or the boundary conditions , and only partial knowledge of the dm profile .",
    "thus , our approach differs from previous work in the following ways .",
    "( i ) we do not assume the dm to be nfw - like at large radii ; instead , we adopt a generalised version of the nfw profile ( b10 ) , and are able to discriminate between different values of the logarithmic slope of the dm at large radii . ( ii )",
    "we do not fix the value of the polytropic index from simulations ( ascasibar et al .",
    "2003 ; a06 ; ostriker et al .",
    "2005 ; bode et al . 2007 , 2009 ) nor constrain it with some assumption on the gas profile at large radii ( ks01 ; ks02 ) ; instead , we leave the polytropic index as a free parameter and , by comparing our model to observations , constrain it as a function of mass and redshift .",
    "( iii ) we do not force the gas radial profile to behave in any way , either by imposing its profile to be equal to that of dm at large radii ( ks01 ; ks02 ) or by requiring it to vanish at infinity ( ascasibar et al .",
    "2003 ; a06 ) ; instead , we simply require the temperature of the gas to never be negative . by leaving the gas temperature at large radii as a free parameter",
    ", we are able to constrain the value of the temperature of the intracluster medium ( or of the intercluster medium , depending on the assumptions we make ) by matching our theoretically derived @xmath9@xmath10 relation to observations in the low - mass regime ( i.e. groups ) .",
    "( iv ) we do not fix the concentration from simulations ( ks01 ; ks02 ; ascasibar et al . 2003 ; a06 ; ostriker et al .",
    "2005 ; bode et al . 2007 , 2009 ) , but instead investigate the effects of different mass - concentration relations ; we discriminate between different recipes by matching our model to recently observed luminosity - temperature ( @xmath11@xmath12 ) relations ( maughan et al .",
    "2011 : m11 ) .",
    "for this last part of the study , a second constraint was necessary , and we imposed the baryon fraction within the virial radius to be equal to the cosmic value .",
    "we believe the flexibility of our model to be its main strength .",
    "more general assumptions than in previous studies help us obtain more constraints : on the polytropic index ; on the dm logarithmic slope at large radii ; on the gas temperature at large radii ; on concentration .",
    "also , we do extend the model to higher redshift and obtain constraints on parameter evolution .    throughout the paper , we use the following cosmological parameters ( wmap5 ; komatsu et al .",
    "2009 ) : @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath18 km s@xmath17 mpc@xmath17 , @xmath19 ( i.e. @xmath20 ) .",
    "the values and uncertainties of other parameters ( e.g. @xmath21 ) are not relevant in our study .",
    "the outline of the paper is as follows . in section [ sec : polytropic_gas_in_galaxy_groups_and_clusters ] , we formulate the problem and study in detail the consequences of assuming hydrostatic equilibrium and a polytropic relation . in section [ sec : scaling_relations_and_comparison_to_observations ] , we derive galaxy groups and clusters scaling relations and compare them to recent observations to obtain constraints on gas and dm parameters .",
    "we conclude in section [ sec : conclusions ] .",
    "in this section , we model groups and clusters of galaxies as isolated , spherically symmetric , composite systems of stars , dm and ideal gas .",
    "we describe the dm with a generalised nfw density profile ( b10 ) ,    @xmath22    where @xmath23 , @xmath24 is the scale radius , @xmath25 is the characteristic ( dimensionless ) density , @xmath26 is the critical density of the universe at redshift @xmath27 , @xmath28^{1/2}$ ] and @xmath29 is the gravitational constant should not be confused with the @xmath8-model of cavaliere & fusco - femiano ( 1976 , 1978 ) . ] .",
    "note that the logarithmic slope at small radii is the same as for the standard nfw profile , which is a particular case of this profile when @xmath30 .",

    "] , assumed to be the same at all radii ( i.e. the polytropic relation is _ complete _ ) .",
    "we assume the gas to be in global , thermally - supported he with the total gravitational potential @xmath40 , that is , to obey the he equation , @xmath41 , everywhere .",
    "we also neglect the effects of gas self - gravity , as it has been demonstrated ( e.g. suto et al . 1998 ) that the contribution of the gas to the total gravitational potential does not lead to significantly different results , and additionally ignore the stellar gravitational potential , as it has been shown ( see capelo , natarajan & coppi 2010 for the low - mass case ) that gas profiles are affected by stars only in the very inner regions , which are not important for the results of this work ) .",
    "for the same reason , we do not investigate dm profiles with different logarithmic slopes at small radii ( e.g. moore et al .",
    "1998 ) . ] .",

    "a general attribute of the polytropic solution of the he equation is that it is physically meaningful only between zero and a maximum radius @xmath92 ( lea 1975 ) . beyond @xmath92 ,",
    "the temperature becomes negative , making the solution unphysical in that region ( e.g. @xmath93 ) , the density is positive also for @xmath94 , but the temperature becomes negative regardless of the value of the polytropic index . ] .",
    "the existence of a maximum radius can be explained in the same way one explains the finite truncation radius in classical polytropes with @xmath95 : a finite @xmath92 means that the gravitational potential is strong enough to bind the gas in a finite region ; an infinite @xmath92 means that the pressure of the gas is high enough to make the gas either unbound or bound only in a limitless region . however , the analogy between the profiles in this work and those of classical polytropes can not be taken too far : in classical polytropes , @xmath96 if @xmath97 , regardless of other gas quantities ; on the other hand , the polytropic solution given by equation or , for a given polytropic index , can have a finite or infinite maximum radius , depending on other gas quantities , as it is explained below .",
    "the difference arises from the different nature of @xmath40 : in this paper , the gravitational potential is fixed and external , due to dm ; in the classical polytrope case , @xmath40 is entirely due to gas self - gravity .    by studying equations and further , we note that @xmath92 , once all the other parameters ( virial mass , redshift , cosmological parameters , etc . )",
    "have been fixed , depends only on the gas temperature .",
    "the hotter the gas is , the larger @xmath92 becomes . in particular , by imposing the weak boundary condition @xmath98 , there exists a threshold minimum value of the central temperature ,    @xmath99    above which the solution is physically meaningful at all radii , i.e. @xmath96 . this central threshold temperature , which depends on the system s gravitational potential ( i.e. on its mass ) and on the steepness of the polytropic relation , is a characteristic quantity of the system : @xmath100 is the minimum permitted central temperature , resulting from the requirement of he and non - negative temperature at all radii .",

    "we computed the average temperature following the notation of ks01 . in general , one can write    @xmath201    where the excision radius @xmath202 is either zero or a fraction of an overdensity radius ( e.g. @xmath75 , @xmath203 , @xmath204 , or other ) , the truncation radius @xmath205 is some other fraction of , or equal to , an overdensity radius , and @xmath206 is the weight function . if the weight function @xmath207 , @xmath208 is the volume - weighted average temperature ; if @xmath209 , @xmath210 is the mass - weighted average temperature ; if @xmath211 , where @xmath212 is the number density of electrons per unit volume , @xmath213 is the number density of ions per unit volume and @xmath214 is the cooling function , @xmath215 is the emission - weighted average temperature .",

    "the choice of @xmath202 and @xmath205 is an important one .",
    "the truncation radius @xmath205 is usually determined by observational constraints . at large radii , both gas temperature and density are very low , therefore very difficult to quantify accurately .",

    "the choice of the excision radius @xmath202 is less straightforward .",
    "most studies justify excising the central region because it is significantly affected by radiative cooling and by other physics of which we do not know the details , e.g. feedback .",
    "the positive result of excision is the large decrease in scatter in the x - ray scaling relations , at all masses ( e.g. markevitch 1998 ) , which is highly useful for cosmology measurements .",

    "such a study is beyond the scope of this paper , although where we can , we will note the more obvious degeneracies .    before we embark on our study ,",

    "this is a potential source of scatter , since different systems having the same total ( low ) virial mass might have slightly different stellar masses .    when assuming a mass - dependent gas mass fraction , the @xmath11@xmath12 relation with @xmath3 matches x - ray observations better than the case with @xmath242 .",
    "focusing on other mass - concentration relations ( e.g. o10 or o11 , see figure [ fig : lt_relation_o10_o11 ] ) , we immediately notice that the model does not recover the observed @xmath11@xmath12 relation by m11 .",
    "this might imply that concentration can not depend strongly on mass .",
    "we present a simple and flexible model for the gas and dm content of groups and clusters of galaxies , by assuming an ideal polytropic gas in he at all radii with a dm gravitational potential , described by a generalised nfw profile . exploring the physical properties of the polytropic solution of the he equation",
    ", we report on methods to constrain the three gas parameters ( @xmath0 , @xmath37 and @xmath36 ) and two dm parameters ( @xmath1 and @xmath224 ) of such a solution . with no prior knowledge of the polytropic index or the boundary conditions",
    ", we derive the scaling relations for galaxy groups and clusters from these first principles and compare them to recent x - ray observations .",
    "this allows us to obtain powerful constraints on gas and dm parameters .",
    "in particular ,    * for systems at redshift @xmath106 , with nfw dm , concentration given by d08 and @xmath128 , we derive a theoretical @xmath9@xmath10 relation with a logarithmic slope of 1.46 and normalisation that depends rather simply on the polytropic index : @xmath358^{6/5}$ ] ( see equation [ eq : mt_relation_gamma ] ) ; * comparing with recent x - ray observations of clusters of galaxies , we find that a model with a constant polytropic index with a value between 6/5 and 13/10 is consistent with the data ; * further , when including data from low - mass systems , the assumption of a constant polytropic index is not consistent with the observations . a possible explanation for the discrepancy is a mass dependence in @xmath0 such that it decreases with mass ( and increases with concentration ) , as derived in equations and ; * for systems at redshift @xmath106 , with nfw dm , concentration given by d08 and @xmath3 , we derive a theoretical @xmath9@xmath10 relation that is a broken power law , where the break depends on the value of the temperature at large radii . comparing this case to x - ray observations of groups",
    ", we constrain the temperature at large radii to be @xmath5 k @xmath266 k , consistent with numerical simulations and observations of the warm - hot intergalactic medium ; * for systems at redshift @xmath106 , with a generalised nfw dm , concentration given by d08 and @xmath128 , we compare the theoretically derived @xmath9@xmath10 relation to recent x - ray observations of clusters of galaxies . assuming a mass - independent polytropic index @xmath2 for high - mass systems , we find that @xmath285 , i.e. the dm profile in galaxy clusters either follows the nfw profile or is slightly steeper at large radii ; * for systems at redshift @xmath106 , with nfw dm , @xmath3 and @xmath128 , we also study the dependence of the theoretically derived @xmath9@xmath10 relation on concentration and find a very weak dependence , unless the temperature is calculated without excising the central region ; * for systems with nfw dm , concentration given by d08 , @xmath3 and @xmath128 , we study the dependence of the theoretically derived @xmath9@xmath10 relation on redshift , and find that our model scales in a self - similar behaviour . however , given the freedom in our model , the departure from self - similarity seen in some clusters can be used to constrain the evolution of the polytropic index with redshift ( see e.g. equations [ eq : gamma_of_z_clerc ] and [ eq : eta_of_psi ] ) ; * for systems at redshift @xmath106 , with nfw dm and @xmath128 , we study the dependence of the theoretically derived @xmath11@xmath12 relation on the polytropic index , on concentration and on the stellar mass fraction . we find that a concentration strongly dependent on mass is ruled out by comparison to recent x - ray observations .",
    "the power of this model lies in its simplicity and its flexibility . in future work ,",
    "more sophisticated models can be built upon this framework by relaxing some of the assumption made here , e.g. spherical symmetry , and by including non - thermal contributions to he ; a radially - dependent polytropic index ; more general dm profiles ; gas self - gravity ; and the effect of the stellar gravitational potential .",
    "we also note that we studied narrow slices of the five - dimensional parameter space ( @xmath0 , @xmath37 , @xmath36 , @xmath1 and @xmath224 ) .",
    "further studies can easily exploit the model to explore the full parameter space .",
    "although we have used the polytropic relation to describe the gas , its origin is still unclear , although it is likely tied to the formation of the halo . in this paper , we have proposed a relation between the polytropic index , mass and redshift , thus providing useful information and a first step to solve this puzzle .",
