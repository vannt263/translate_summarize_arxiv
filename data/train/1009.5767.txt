    "[ sec : intro ] early x - ray observations of nearby galactic spheroids ( i.e. , elliptical galaxies and bulges of disk galaxies ) have established two primary x - ray emitters : diffuse hot gas and discrete sources ( e.g. , forman , jones & tucker 1985 ; van speybroeck et al .  1979 ; trinchieri & fabbiano 1985 ) .",
    "the hot gas is perhaps ubiquitous in early - type galaxies , but is found to dominate the overall x - ray emission only in gas - rich , massive elliptical galaxies . in low- and intermediate - mass galaxies , the discrete sources , primarily stellar binaries whose collective emission roughly scales with the host galaxy s stellar mass ( gilfanov 2004 ; revnivtsev et al .",
    "2007 ) , generally overwhelm the hot gas .",
    "an x - ray nucleus , with a high incidence rate in nearby early - type galaxies ( zhang et al",
    ".  2009 ; gallo et al .  2010 ) , may further complicate the observed x - ray emission .",
    "studies of the hot gas in the less massive early - type galaxies thus have been warranted only with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "( weisskopf et al .  2002 ) , owing to its superb angular resolution for isolating discrete sources and its excellent sensitivity for tracing faint , extended x - ray emission .",
    "many recent efforts to study hot gas in elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , fukazawa et al .  2006 ; diehl & statler 2007 ; memola et al .",
    "2009 ) , however , have not led to a consensus on the physical properties of the hot gas and their dependence on the host properties . in particular , the amount of hot gas in these systems is found to span over two orders of magnitude for a given host stellar mass ( e.g. , osullivan , forbes & ponman 2001 ; ellis & osullivan 2006 ) , but the origin of this dispersion remains unclear .",
    "it is widely accepted that the hot gas originates either externally from accretion of the intergalactic medium ( igm ) , or internally from mass loss during normal stellar evolution .",
    "the hot gas content is thus likely dependent on galaxy age ( sansom et al .",
    "2006 ) , but also depends sensitively on the formation history and environment of the host galaxy ( tang et al .",
    "2009a ) as well as on - going nuclear activity ( e.g. , lanz et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "galactic bulges are thought to resemble elliptical galaxies in their stellar populations ( i.e. , primarily old ; e.g. , macarthur , gonzlez & courteau 2009 ) , but a similar assessment has not been made for their ism .",
    "for instance , it is not clear whether bulges exhibit the same dispersion in their hot gas content as in elliptical galaxies .",
    "this lack of knowledge is due partly to the limited observational information . indeed , while the majority of nearby ( @xmath4 40 mpc ) optically bright ( @xmath5@xmath612 ) elliptical galaxies have been observed by _",
    "chandra _ and/or _ xmm - newton _ ,",
    "less than half of the optically bright early - type spiral galaxies ( sa / sab ; @xmath060 in total , tully 1988 ) in the same volume have received attention by x - ray pointed observations , and just a few have deep exposures .",
    "consequently , diffuse x - ray emission has been examined in detail in only several nearby bulges ( m81 , sab , swartz et al .  2002 ;",
    "ngc1291 , s0/a , irwin et al .  2002 ; m104 , sa , li , wang & hameed , 2007 , hereafter lwh07 ; m31 , sb , li & wang 2007 ; bogdn & gilfanov 2008 ) , for which there are indications that the hot gas content is similar to that found in gas - poor elliptical galaxies ( e.g. , ngc4697 , sarazin et al .",
    "however , a definitive view of the properties of hot gas necessarily awaits deep x - ray observations of an extensive sample of nearby bulges .",
    "several facts make the sombrero galaxy ( m104=ngc4594 ; table [ tab : m104 ] ) an excellent target for an in - depth study of diffuse hot gas in and around a bulge : ( i ) it harbors a prominent stellar bulge ( @xmath7@xmath8 - 21.4 ) as luminous as massive elliptical galaxies and thus is expected to host a substantial amount of hot gas ; ( ii ) with a well - determined distance of @xmath9  mpc , the galaxy allows for simultaneously good sensitivity and substantial coverage ( out to @xmath025 kpc ) that are crucial for tracing extended , low - intensity x - ray emission ; ( iii ) the nearly edge - on ( 84@xmath10 ) view of the galaxy allows for a clean separation between its disk and bulge ; iv ) as indicated by the low specific fluxes of its diffuse radio , far - infrared and h@xmath11 emission , the galaxy shows little indication for recent star formation , minimizing the possibility of heating and/or gas ejection from the disk ; ( v ) the galaxy is relatively isolated and thus uncertainties resulting from galaxy interactions are minimal ; and ( vi ) the galaxy is located in a direction of relatively low galactic foreground absorption column density ( @xmath12  @xmath13 ) , essential for studying the soft x - ray emission from hot gas .",
    "based on shallow _",
    "chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ observations , lwh07 reported the detection of diffuse x - ray emission from sombrero , which appears significantly more extended than the optical starlight .",
    "lwh07 took advantage of the _ chandra _ angular resolution to study the inner galactic regions , where many discrete sources are present and have to be removed , and of the _ xmm - newton _ field of view to trace the diffuse emission from beyond the galaxy s optical extent .",
    "nevertheless , the study of lwh07 was subject to several limitations : ( i ) the _ xmm - newton _ observation , limited by its relatively large point - spread function ( psf ) and high instrumental background , is far from ideal for quantifying the faint , extended x - ray emission ; ( ii ) the instrumental heterogeneity also challenges the calibration of _ chandra _ and _ xmm - newton _ measurements at transition regions ; ( iii ) even in _ chandra _ images with the bright discrete sources removed , the apparently `` diffuse '' x - ray emission is still contaminated by the emission from unresolved stellar objects . a common practice to account for this stellar component in the unresolved emission has been to scale the detected hard x - ray photons ( e.g. , with energies above 2 kev ) , which presumably exclusively arise from stellar objects , to predict the soft photons from the same population , by assuming an average hardness ratio the same as that of the resolved bright sources , primarily low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) .",
    "not until recently has such an assumption been recognized to be problematic , following the calibration of the collective x - ray emission from fainter stellar populations , i.e. , coronally active binaries and cataclysmic variables ( abs and cvs ; sazonov et al .",
    "2006 ; revnivtsev et al .",
    "2007 , 2008 ) .",
    "these sources exhibit a much softer collective spectrum than that of lmxbs , such that they can overwhelm faint lmxbs ( i.e. , those below the source detection threshold ) in terms of contribution to the unresolved soft x - ray emission .",
    "an appropriate treatment is therefore needed to decompose the truly diffuse emission , fully accounting for the collective emission of abs and cvs .",
    "mindful of the above concerns , we have recently obtained two new _ chandra _ observations of the sombrero galaxy to advance our view of high - energy stellar and interstellar phenomena in a galactic bulge .",

    "on april 29 and december 2 , 2008 we obtained two new observations ( obsid  9532 and 9533 ; pi : c.  jones ) , in the acis - i vfaint mode with exposures of 85 and 90 ks , respectively . in paper",
    "i , data of obsid 1586 , 9532 and 9533 are used to study the discrete x - ray sources . in this work",
    "we utilize these three observations to study the diffuse emission , chiefly based on data from the acis - i ccds of obsid 9532 and 9533 and from the s3 ccd of obsid 1586 .",
    "we also use data from the s2 ccd of obsid 9532 and 9533 to better constrain the local sky background in our spectral analysis .",
    "in addition , to study the nucleus , we include data from obsid  407 , taking advantage of its shorter readout frame time ( 0.4 second , compared to the standard 3.2 second ) .",
    "we reprocessed the data using ciao v.4.1 and the corresponding calibration files , following the _ chandra _ acis data analysis guide .",
    "examination of the light curves indicates that the instrumental background of each observation was fairly quiescent .",
    "subsequently , background filtering is only necessary for obsid 1586 , which results in 16.7 ks of good time intervals for this data set . for each observation , we produced count and exposure maps in the 0.4 - 0.7 , 0.7 - 1 , 1 - 2 and 2 - 6 kev bands , using a spatial binning factor of 2 ( @xmath0@xmath31 per image pixel ) .",
    "an absorbed power - law spectrum , with a photon index of 1.7 and an absorption column density @xmath32 , was adopted as a weighting function when producing the exposure maps .",
    "the energy - dependent difference of effective area between the acis - s3 ccd and the acis - i ccds was also accounted for , so that the quoted count rates throughout this work are referred to acis - i .",
    "corresponding instrumental background maps were generated from the `` stowed '' data , after calibrating with the 10 - 12 kev count rate .",
    "these individual maps were then projected to a common tangential point , here the optical center of sombrero , to produce summed images of the combined field of view ( fov ; cf .",
    "fig .  1 of paper i ) .",
    "the total effective exposure , in the 2 - 6 kev band for instance , is @xmath33180 ks within a projected galactocentric radius @xmath34 , where the fov is common to the three observations ( obsid 1586 , 9532 and 9533 ) , and gradually drops below 80 ks at @xmath35 .",
    "we detected 383 discrete sources across the combined fov , the bulk of which are lmxbs associated with sombrero , as well as background agns ( paper i ) .",
    "to isolate the unresolved x - ray emission , we have excluded these sources from maps in individual observations , each with a circle enclosing @xmath0@xmath36 of the source photons .",
    "such a source subtraction procedure works well except for the bright nucleus , whose psf - scattered photons contribute substantially to the unresolved emission , especially at energies above 2 kev , within the central half - arcminute .",
    "we therefore relied on _ marx _ simulations ( see   [ subsec : nuc ] ) to determine the expected distributions of psf - scattered photons from the nucleus .",
    "residual psf - scattered photons from other sources are estimated to contribute @xmath025% of the remaining unresolved x - ray emission in the 2 - 6 kev band .",
    "due to the variation of the local background , psf and effective exposure across the fov , the limiting flux for source detection necessarily varies with sky position , roughly increasing with angular distance from the galactic center .",
    "consequently , at larger radii the background contains more photons from unresolved sources .",
    "we statistically corrected for such a non - uniform background , based on the luminosity functions of the lmxbs and cosmic agns ( paper i ) , to a common source flux limit of @xmath37 ( 0.4 - 6 kev ) across the fov .",
    "we also accounted for artifacts due to photons registered during ccd readout , following the technique proposed by markevitch et al .",
    "the procedure effectively generated maps of statistically - sampled readout photons for individual observations , which can then be projected in the same way as for the count maps .",
    "the three terms considered above , namely , the psf wing of the nucleus , the spatially non - uniform photons from unresolved sources , and the out - of - time events , all contribute to the unresolved emission depending on the energy band and sky position .",

    "classified as a liner ( low - ionization nuclear emission region ; heckman 1980 ; ho , filippenko , sargent 1997 ) , sombrero is known to exhibit a low level of nuclear activity . in particular , the nucleus ( i.e. , the smbh ) manifests itself as a moderately bright x - ray source ( fabbiano & juda 1997 ; ho et al .",

    "these images are shown on a refined pixel scale ( 1/4 of the original acis pixel ) to take advantage of the sub - pixel positioning information that results from telescope dithering . the sub - arcsec resolution afforded by _",
    "chandra _ is ideal for disentangling the nucleus .",
    "nevertheless , quantification of the nuclear emission demands caution on the effects of photon pile - up and psf scattering .    the moderately bright nucleus ( with a flux of @xmath0@xmath40 )",
    "is expected to cause mild pile - up .",
    "direct evidence of pile - up comes from examination of events flagged as grade 7 in the raw ( i.e. , level 1 ) event file ( the reprocessed , i.e. , level 2 , data keeps only `` good '' events with grades 0 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 ) .",
    "when pile - up occurs , i.e. , two or more photons land on the same ccd frame and consequently only one event is registered , a grade-7 event can be produced due to , for instance , a combination of grades 2 - 2 or grades 3 - 4 .",
    "visual inspection reveals that grade-7 events are clustered in the central 3 pixels around the nucleus in obsid 1586 , 9532 and 9533 , but are essentially absent in obsid 407 , presumably due to the much shorter frame time of the latter .",

    "the simulated profiles follow the observed profiles in all four quadrants in the central two pixels ( @xmath01@xmath39 ) where @xmath080% of the nuclear flux is enclosed ; deviations become substantial at larger off - center distances presumably due to the presence of extra - nuclear emission ( e.g. , arising from discrete sources and diffuse hot gas ; see   [ subsec : circum ] ) that is not simulated .",
    "the goodness of the simulated psf is further supported in fig .",
    "[ fig : nuc_rsb]b , where it is compared with the intensity profile obtained by stacking several discrete sources located within @xmath020@xmath39 of the nucleus .",
    "the stacked intensity profile is expected to represent the actual psf at the position of the nucleus , averaged among the four observations .",
    "taking into account the local background , the stacked and simulated profiles agree well with each other , except in the central pixel , presumably due to the fact that the discrete sources are individually free of photon pile - up , while the much brighter nucleus is mildly so .",
    "next we quantify the spectral property of the nucleus .",
    "spectra are extracted from a 2-pixel ( 1@xmath39 ) radius circle around the nucleus for individual observations .",

    "this supports the above argument that the nucleus is not subject to pile - up in obsid 407 .",

    "2009a ) , the thermal structure of which still resembles , and hence is difficult to distinguish from , a quasi - hydrostatic halo , especially at large radii .",
    "this can be seen by estimating the asymptotic flow velocity @xmath138 . adopting the measured gas density ( @xmath139 ) at the outermost radius ( @xmath020 kpc ; fig .",
    "[ fig : deproj ] ) and the total mass outflowing rate ( @xmath140 ) of 0.4@xmath141 ( i.e. , the collective mass loss from the old stars ) , we have @xmath142 , which is much less than the local sound speed .",
    "recent numerical simulations of bulge outflows indicate that the thermal structures are time - dependent and sensitively depend on the formation history and environment of the host galaxy ( tang et al .",
    "interestingly , the simulations predict that the effective temperature of the outflow is relatively low in the central region , chiefly due to the non - uniform thermalization of the sne ia energy in a dense environment ( tang et al .",
    "the low gas temperature near the disk of sombrero seems to be consistent with this prediction .",
    "in addition , thermal conduction and/or charge exchange between the hot gas and the cold gas residing in the disk may lead to softer x - ray emission , a situation suggested to be present in the circumnuclear region of m31 ( li , wang & wakker 2009 ; liu et al .",
    "2010 ) .",
    "another possibility is that the observed soft x - rays arise from the interfaces between a very hot ( a few kev ) wind and an entrained , cold medium ( see e.g. , veilleux et al .",
    "2005 ) . in this case",
    ", the wind temperature would be consistent with the empirical specific energy input per gas particle from evolved stars .",
    "however , the current x - ray data of sombrero provide no compelling evidence for such a wind , e.g. , in terms of diffuse hard x - ray emission and/or iron k - shell lines as observed in the superwind galaxy m82 ( strickland & heckman 2007 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "extraplanar cold gas can be probed as extinction features against the bulge starlight ( e.g. , howk & savage 1997 , 1999 ; li et al .",
    "we find no such evidence in _ hst _",
    "broad - band optical images of sombrero .",
    "[ sec : sum ] based on new and archival _ chandra _ observations , we have studied the x - ray nucleus and the diffuse hot gas in the bulge - dominated , edge - on , sa galaxy sombrero .",
    "the study can be summarized as follows :    \\1 . the 0.3 - 8 kev luminosity of",
    "the nucleus appears to be constant at @xmath0@xmath1 on three epochs between december 1999 and april 2008 , but drops by a factor of two in the november 2008 observation .",
    "the observed x - ray luminosity is only one part in 10@xmath143 of the _ eddington _",
    "luminosity for the smbh , characteristic of a radiatively inefficient accretion flow .",
    "no significant spectral variation is found associated with the flux change .",
    "the nuclear spectrum can be characterized by a power - law with a photon index of @xmath02 and a moderate absorption column density of @xmath0@xmath144 .",
    "after properly accounting for the contribution of unresolved stellar sources , in particular cvs and abs whose quasi - universal x - ray emissivity is recently established , we isolate the truly diffuse emission of hot gas .",
    "the extent of this diffuse emission is significantly larger than that of the star light , reaching a galactocentric radius of at least 23 kpc , where it becomes indistinguishable from the local sky background .",
    "the hot gas shows a temperature of @xmath00.6 kev with little statistically significant variation across the field of view , except around the disk where a lower temperature of @xmath00.3 kev is hinted .",
    "this cooler gas may result from thermal conduction and/or turbulent mixing with the cold ism in the disk .    \\4 . while the total intrinsic luminosity of the hot gas is comparable to the prediction by the latest galaxy formation models ,",
    "in which a hot gaseous halo is a generic feature of a disk galaxy formed by the accretion of the igm , we show that the role of internal feedback processes , in particular the energy input by sne ia and the mass input by evolved stars , can not be neglected .",
    "\\5 . a simple hydrodynamic model characterizing the stellar feedback and the gravitational potential in sombrero , in which the hot gas is in the form of a supersonic wind , however , fall far short of reproducing the observed amounts of x - ray luminosity and gas mass . while recent more sophisticated numerical simulations suggest that a subsonic outflow is a viable solution , understanding of the thermodynamical structure of the hot gas in sombrero and in other typically intermediate - mass early - type galaxies continues to be pursued .",
    "zl is grateful to the useful comments and discussions with robert crain , larry david , hui dong and dan harris .",
    "this work is supported by the sao grant g08 - 9088 .",
    "[ set : wind ] hydrodynamic models for galactic - scale flows have long been developed ( e.g. , mathews & baker 1971 ; white & chevalier 1983 , 1984 ; loewenstein & mathews 1987 ; david , forman & jones 1990 ; ciotti et al .",
    "1991 ) , most of which are in the scope of elliptical galaxies for which spherical symmetry is a reasonable approximation .",
    "the essence of these models includes the characterization of the gravitational potential and the mass and energy deposition ( i.e. , stellar feedback ) to the gas flow .",
    "such properties , which together determine the gas dynamics , are practically difficult to constrain from direct observations .",
    "our approach is to construct a model with simple , but essential physical considerations , aiming to confront the modeled gas properties with observational results .",
    "[ sec : formulation ] our first assumption is that the gas flow is in a steady state and a spherical symmetry .",
    "the dynamical timescale of a wind is much shorter than the timescale of galaxy evolution , hence it is reasonable to assume that the mass and energy input from evolved stars , which together supply the gas flow , are at constant rates .",
    "spherical symmetry is not only a practical assumption , as used in most theoretical models , but also is supported in the x - ray morphologies of galactic spheroids .",
    "all physical parameters considered hereafter , e.g. , gas density and temperature , are functions of galactocentric radius .",
    "second , we assume that the mass and energy input spatially follow the distribution of stars . the mass input is essentially contributed by the ejecta of evolved stars , such as stellar winds and planetary nebulae ; the energy input is primarily provided by mechanical energy from type ia sne , with additional orbital energy carried by the stellar ejecta .    in galaxies where gas outflows exist , the x - ray luminosity is typically as low as only a few percent of the energy input .",
    "thus we neglect the effect of radiative cooling on the gas dynamics .",
    "this is a good approximation as the cooling timescale is much longer than the dynamical timescale , probably except for the central region .",
    "other assumptions that have been made include neglecting thermal conduction , viscosity , and self - gravity of the gas .",
    "now the physical properties of the gas can be described by the hydrodynamic equations : @xmath145 @xmath146 @xmath147    = -{\\rho}gu+\\dot{e}(r ) , \\label{eq : energy}\\ ] ] where @xmath148 , @xmath149 , and @xmath150 are the velocity , density and pressure of gas , respectively .",
    "@xmath151 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "g(r ) is the gravitational force given by @xmath152}{r^2 } , \\\\",

    "@xmath155(r ) and @xmath156(r ) are the mass and energy input rates per unit volume , which are assumed to be proportional to the density of stellar mass @xmath157(r ) .",
    "[ sec : galaxy ] a valid solution of the above hydrodynamic equations stands on a specific realization of the host galaxy , i.e. , the spatial distributions of stars and dark matter and the mass and energy input rates from stars . to derive the spatial distribution of stars ,",
    "we deproject a de vaucouleurs s law , which is empirically used to describe the stellar surface brightness profile of elliptical galaxies and bulges .",
    "we adopt an effective radius @xmath158 = 105@xmath39 ( @xmath04.6 kpc ) for the bulge of sombrero ( bendo et al .",
    "we note that the stellar disk contributes less than 20% of the total stellar mass in sombrero and is neglected .",
    "the total stellar mass @xmath159 , 1.5@xmath160 , is determined from the color - dependent mass - to - light ratio of bell et al .",

    "the galaxy boundary is defined to be the virial radius , @xmath165 , which scales with the cube root of the virial mass ( total mass of stars and dark matter ) . since we have good observational constraints on the distributions of stellar mass ( based on k - band light ) and gravitational mass ( based on kinematics of globular clusters out to @xmath166=25 kpc ; bridges et al .",
    "2007 ) , we fit the nfw profile to the difference between the gravitational mass and the stellar mass to obtain @xmath167=27 kpc , @xmath165=483 kpc and m@xmath168=6.8@xmath169 . to complete the modeling",
    ", we also need to specify the total stellar mass loss rate @xmath170 and the collective energy input rate @xmath171 , so as to determine @xmath172 and @xmath173 ( both assumed to be proportional to @xmath174 ) via relations @xmath175",
    "@xmath176 @xmath170 and @xmath171 are the two key parameters in our model .",
    "for a given galaxy , there are also empirical methods to estimate @xmath170 and @xmath171 .",
    "knapp , gunn and wynn - williams ( 1992 ) suggested the following relation as a direct measurement of the current mass loss rate from evolved stars in elliptical galaxies , using the 2.2 @xmath177 flux density @xmath178    the energy input consists of that from type ia sne and that from stars , i.e. , @xmath179 . by assuming a typical released energy of @xmath180 for a single sn explosion , @xmath181 where @xmath182 is the observed type ia sne rate in units of snuk ( one per @xmath183 per 100 yr ) for early - type galaxies at low redshifts ( mannucci 2005 ) .",
    "the stellar ejecta also carry mechanical energy obtained from the orbital motion of the progenitor star , @xmath184 where @xmath52 is the stellar velocity dispersion . clearly , @xmath185 is the dominant form of energy input .    closely relevant",
    "is the metal - enrichment of gas predominantly by the sne .",
    "we take the iron enrichment as an example .",
    "nomoto , thielemann and yokoi ( 1984 ) calculated the fe yield per type ia sn to be 0.7@xmath186 , about half of the total released mass . assuming a complete mixture of the iron atoms with the gas",
    ", the iron abundance can be estimated as @xmath187_{\\odot}})(\\frac{r_{{\\rm sn}}}{0.035 { \\rm snuk } } ) , \\label{eq : z_fe}\\ ] ] which is independent of the total stellar content . according to grevesse & sauval ( 1998 ) , @xmath188_{\\odot}=3.16\\times10^{-5}$ ] ,",
    "thus by assuming that @xmath189 equals solar , eq.([eq : z_fe ] ) gives @xmath190 .",

    "with eq.([eq : u0 ] ) and ( [ eq : t0 ] ) , one can show that equations ( [ eq : mass])-([eq : energy ] ) reduce to a first order differential equation of the mach number @xmath198 , \\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath199 @xmath200 @xmath201    in general the right - hand side of eq.([eq : machdiff ] ) is singular when @xmath202 .",
    "correspondingly , the radius @xmath203 at which @xmath204 is called the _ sonic radius _ or _ critical radius_. a wind solution requires that the gas flow smoothly passes through the sonic radius .",
    "this provides a third boundary condition to the solution , @xmath205 so that the right - hand side of eq.([eq : machdiff ] ) remains regular when @xmath204 .    to derive the wind solution ,",
    "the location of the sonic radius is first found by solving eq.([eq : r_c ] ) , which is simply an algebraic equation of @xmath166 . then _",
    "lhospita _ s rule is applied to obtain the derivative of @xmath206 at @xmath207 . finally , a wind solution is found by integrating eq.([eq : machdiff ] ) starting from @xmath207 inward to the center and from outward to the virial radius .",

    "<S> based on new and archival _ chandra _ observations of the sombrero galaxy ( m  104=ngc  4594 ) , we study the x - ray emission from its nucleus and the extended x - ray emission in and around its massive stellar bulge . we find that the 0.3 - 8 kev luminosity of the nucleus appears constant at @xmath0@xmath1 , or @xmath010@xmath2 of its eddington luminosity , on three epochs between december 1999 and april 2008 , but drops by a factor of two in the november 2008 observation . </S>",
    "<S> the 2 - 6 kev unresolved emission from the bulge region closely follows the k - band star light and most likely arises from unresolved stellar sources . at lower energies , however , the unresolved emission reaches a galactocentric radius of at least 23 kpc , significantly beyond the extent of the star light , clearly indicating the presence of diffuse hot gas . </S>",
    "<S> we isolate the emission of the gas by properly accounting for the emission from unresolved stellar sources , predominantly cataclysmic variables and coronally active binaries , whose quasi - universal x - ray emissivity was recently established . </S>",
    "<S> we find a gas temperature of @xmath00.6 kev with little variation across the field of view , except for a lower temperature of @xmath00.3 kev along the stellar disk . </S>",
    "<S> the metal abundance is not well constrained due to the limited counting statistics , but is consistent with metal - enrichment by type ia supernovae . </S>",
    "<S> we measure a total intrinsic 0.3 - 2 kev luminosity of @xmath0@xmath3 , which corresponds to only one percent of the available energy input by type ia supernovae in the bulge , but is comparable to the prediction by the latest galaxy formation models for disk galaxies as massive as sombrero . </S>",
    "<S> however , such numerical models do not fully account for internal feedback processes , such as nuclear feedback and stellar feedback , against accretion from the intergalactic medium . on the other hand </S>",
    "<S> , we find no evidence for either the nucleus or the very modest star - forming activities in the disk to be a dominant heating source for the diffuse gas . </S>",
    "<S> we also show that neither the expected energy released by type ia supernovae nor the expected mass returned by evolved stars is recovered by observations . </S>",
    "<S> we argue that in sombrero a galactic - scale subsonic outflow of hot gas continuously removes much of the `` missing '' energy and mass input from the bulge region . </S>",
    "<S> the observed density and temperature distributions of such an outflow , however , continues to pose challenges to theoretical studies . </S>"
