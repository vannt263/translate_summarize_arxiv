    "in a previous paper [ 1 ] one of us ( fc ) analyzed , in the _ complex _ domain , the dynamical system characterized by the newtonian equations of motion @xmath11 which obtain in the standard manner from the hamiltonian    @xmath12    provided ( as we hereafter assume  even though the main result of [ 1 ] holds without this restriction ) @xmath13    here and below @xmath2 is an arbitrary positive integer ( @xmath14 ) , the indices @xmath15 , @xmath16 run from @xmath17 to @xmath2 unless otherwise indicated , underlined quantities are @xmath2-vectors , say @xmath18 , and all quantities ( namely , the @xmath2 `` canonical coordinates '' @xmath3 , the @xmath2 `` canonical momenta '' @xmath19 , the @xmath20 `` coupling constants '' @xmath5 ) are _ complex _ , while the independent variable  @xmath6 ( `` time '' ) is instead _",
    "real_. of course the @xmath2 complex equations of motion ( [ eq1 ] ) can be reformulated [ 1 ] as @xmath21 real   and as well hamiltonian [ 2 ]   equations of motion , by introducing the real and imaginary parts of the coordinates @xmath3 , @xmath22 , or their amplitudes and phases , @xmath23 :    @xmath24 \\nonumber\\\\ \\phantom{\\ddot{x}_{n}+x_{n}}{}= \\sum \\limits_{m=1 , \\ ; m \\ne n}^{n } r_{nm}^{-3 }    \\ddot{y}_{n}+y_{n } = \\sum \\limits_{m=1 , \\ ; m \\ne n}^{n } r_{nm}^{-6 } \\left[a_{nm}y_{nm}\\left(y_{nm}^{2}-3x_{nm}^{2}\\right ) -b_{nm}y_{nm}\\left(x_{nm}^{2}-3y_{nm}^{2}\\right ) \\right ] \\nonumber\\\\",

    "( indeed , in this _ integrable _ case the @xmath2 coordinates  @xmath27 can be identified with the @xmath2 zeros of a polynomial of degree @xmath2 the coefficients of which are periodic in @xmath6 with period @xmath9 , so that the set of these @xmath2 zeros is also periodic with period @xmath28 , and each individual zero is therefore also periodic , although possibly with a  larger period which is an integer multiple of @xmath9 due to a possible reshuffling of the zeros as the motion unfolds ; in the _ real _ case with all coupling constants _ equal _ and _ positive _ , @xmath29 , when the motions are confined to the real axis and no such reshuffling can occur due to the singular and repulsive character of the two - body forces , _ all _ real solutions are _ nonsingular _ and _ completely periodic _ with period @xmath30 , @xmath31 ; see for instance  [ 2 ] ) .",
    "here we focus instead on the more general case with _ completely arbitrary _ coupling constants @xmath5 , which is generally believed _ not _ to be integrable .",
    "but even in this case  as proven in  [ 1 ]   there does exist a domain of initial data @xmath32 , @xmath33 having _ infinite _ measure in phase space   indeed , having a measure which is a finite fraction of that of the entire phase space  such that _ all _ the trajectories originating from it are _ completely periodic _ with period @xmath9 , @xmath34 . as pointed out in  [ 1 ] , this is a somewhat surprising finding , inasmuch as it negates the expectation that , for a nonlinear dynamical system with several degrees of freedom that possesses completely periodic trajectories emerging from some specific initial data , any generic variation of these initial data destroy the complete periodicity of the trajectories or at least change their period  unless the system is essentially equivalent ( say , via an appropriate change of variables ) to a linear system ( such as ( [ eq1 ] ) with _ all _ coupling constants vanishing , @xmath35 ) , which is certainly not the case for the system ( [ eq1 ] ) with _ arbitrary _ coupling constants @xmath36 , at least not in any manner explicitly computable in closed form .",
    "but , as shown in [ 1 ] , this fact is a rather elementary consequence of an approach ( a `` trick '' ) introduced and rather extensively used recently to evince analogous results ( see  [ 2 ] and the references quoted there , as well as [ 3 , 4 , 5 ] ) . this same trick can as well be exploited to investigate the remaining solutions , namely those not belonging to the class of _ completely periodic _ solutions with period @xmath9 the existence of which was proven in  [ 1 ] .",
    "this we do in the present paper , and we also confirm the insight thereby gained by exhibiting numerical solutions of ( [ eq1 ] ) performed via a computer code created by one of us ( ms )  [ 6 ] .",
    "in particular we demonstrate below the existence of open domains of initial data , having _ nonvanishing _ measures in the phase space of such data , which also yield _ completely periodic _ solutions , but with periods which are _ integer _ _ multiples _ of @xmath9 , and we also elucidate the mechanism that originates _ non - periodic _ and _ chaotic _ solutions .    in the next section ( the first part of which is closely patterned after section  2 of [ 1 ] and is reported here to make this paper self - contained ) the `` trick '' mentioned above   which in fact amounts to a change of ( dependent and independent ) variables  is introduced . in section  3 the analyticity properties in a time - like complex variable",
    "are investigated of the solutions of the system of odes , see ( [ eq11 ] ) , related to ( [ eq1 ] ) via the trick . the implications of these findings as regards the periodicity of certain solutions of ( [ eq1 ] ) are discussed in section  4 ; in particular the mechanism that underlies the existence of _ completely periodic _ motions with _ higher _ periods ( _ integer multiples _ of @xmath9 ) , and of _ non - periodic _ and _ chaotic _ motions , is elucidated . in section  5",
    "numerical examples of these trajectories are exhibited . in section  6",
    "some final remarks are proffered .",
    "two appendices complete our presentation : appendix  a contains some developments ( confined there not to interrupt the flow of presentation in section  3 ) concerning the analytic structure of the solutions of the evolution equations  ( [ eq11 ] ) ; appendix  b focuses on the _ three - body _ case ( @xmath37 ) , in particular it reports its reducibility to quadratures and a discussion of the information about the analytic behavior of the solutions of ( [ eq11 ] ) entailed by this fact .",
    "let us end this introductory section 1 with some remarks on the choice to investigate the motion determined by the newtonian equations  ( [ eq1 ] ) in the _ complex _ , rather than the _ real _ , domain .",
    "a clear hint that , at least from a  mathematical point of view , this is a  more natural environment to work in , comes already from the treatment of ( [ eq1 ] ) in the _ integrable _ case with _",
    "equal _ coupling constants , @xmath38 , since , as mentioned above , it is then appropriate to identify the @xmath2 particle positions @xmath39 with the @xmath2 zeros of a time dependent ( monic ) polynomial of degree @xmath2 in @xmath40 , say @xmath41 such that @xmath42 = 0 $ ] ( see for instance ref .  [ 2 ] ) ; and clearly the natural environment to investigate the zeros of a polynomial is the _ complex _ plane rather than the _ real _ line . in our context , an essential motivation to work in the complex comes from the important role that analyticity properties play in our treatment , see below .",
    "moreover motions roaming over the complex plane display a much richer dynamics than those restricted to the real line , especially in the case with singular interparticle forces , because of the possibility in the former case , but not in the latter , that particles go around each other .",
    "and it is then natural to re - interpret the ( _ complex _ ) @xmath2-body problem ( [ eq1 ] ) as describing the ( _ real _ ) motion of @xmath2 particles ( _ in the plane _ ) , by introducing a one - to - one correspondence among the complex coordinates @xmath43 , see  ( [ eq3quater ] ) , and the real two - vectors in the plane @xmath44 . but this approach , that is quite convenient to identify interesting many - body problems in the plane ( see chapter  4 of ref .",
    "[ 2 ] ) , suffers in the present case from a drawback : the resulting many - body problem in the plane is not rotation - invariant , see  ( 1.3 ) .",
    "indeed the many - body problem  ( 1.3 ) is characterized by a ( clearly rotation - invariant ) harmonic - oscillator one - body force attracting every particle towards the origin , and by a ( clearly not rotation - invariant ) singular two - body force acting among each particle pair . as clearly seen from  ( 1.3 ) , the strength of the two - body force is proportional to the inverse cube of the ( euclidian ) interparticle distance ,",
    "hence it generally diverges when two particles collide ; but this force also depends , both in modulus and direction , from the orientation of the interparticle vector , as well as from the phase @xmath45 of the relevant interparticle coupling constant ( [ eq3quater ] ) .",
    "indeed the two - body force @xmath46 acting on the @xmath15-th particle due to the @xmath16-th particle is the two - vector @xmath47 , which is generally not aligned to the interparticle distance @xmath48 , see  ( 1.3 ) .",
    "the diligent reader is advised to try and become familiar with the specific implications of this fact , as they will be eventually helpful to understand the trajectories of the solutions of the model ( [ eq1 ] ) , see section  5 .",
    "in this section we describe the `` trick '' [ 14 ] that underlies our subsequent findings , and at the end we mention a remarkable property of the system of odes ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "but firstly we rewrite , mainly for notational convenience , these equations of motion , ( [ eq1 ] ) , as follows :    @xmath49    and we note that the corresponding hamiltonian reads @xmath50    here we introduce the additional constant @xmath51 , which is hereafter assumed to be _ positive _ , @xmath52 , and to which we associate the basic period @xmath53 in the following it will sometimes be convenient to set @xmath54 so that ( [ eq4 ] ) coincide with ( [ eq1 ] ) and the basic period becomes @xmath55 , or to set instead @xmath56 so that the basic period becomes unity , @xmath57 . of course these cases",
    "are all related via a rescaling of the dependent and independent variables , since clearly by setting    @xmath58    with @xmath59 , @xmath60 two _ positive _ rescaling constants which can be chosen at our convenience , the odes ( [ eq4 ] ) get reformulated in a completely analogous `` tilded '' version , @xmath61    where of course here the primes indicate differentiations with respect to the argument of the function they are appended to , @xmath62 .",
    "note in particular that by setting @xmath63 one gets @xmath64 , @xmath65 , namely the tilded version ( [ eq8 ] ) reproduces essentially ( [ eq1 ] ) .",
    "now , the `` trick '' .",
    "let us set    @xmath66/(2i\\omega).\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    as can be readily verified , this change of ( dependent and independent ) variables , ( 2.4 ) , transforms ( [ eq4 ] ) into @xmath67 here and below appended primes denote derivatives with respect to the new independent variable @xmath68 , while of course the dots in ( [ eq4 ] ) and below denote as usual derivatives with respect to the _ real _ time  @xmath6 .",
    "the change of variables ( 2.4 ) entails the following relations among the initial data , @xmath32 , @xmath33 , respectively @xmath69 , @xmath70 , for ( [ eq4 ] ) respectively ( [ eq11 ] ) :    @xmath71    we now observe that , as the ( real , `` physical time '' ) variable @xmath6 varies from @xmath72 to @xmath73 , the ( complex ) variable @xmath68 travels ( counterclockwise ) full circle over the circular contour  @xmath74 , the diameter of which , of length @xmath75 , lies on the upper - half of the complex @xmath68-plane , with its lower end at the origin , @xmath76 , and its upper end at @xmath77 . hence if the solution @xmath78 of ( [ eq11 ] ) which emerges from some assigned initial data @xmath69 , @xmath70 is _ holomorphic _ , as a ( @xmath2-vector - valued ) function of the complex variable @xmath79 , in the closed circular disk @xmath80 encircled by the circle @xmath74 in the complex @xmath79-plane , then the corresponding solution @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) , related to @xmath82 by ( 2.4 ) , is _ completely periodic _ in @xmath6 with period @xmath83 , @xmath84 ( see ( [ eq6 ] ) ; and note that @xmath82 , considered as function of the _ real _ variable @xmath6 , is then _ periodic _ with period @xmath85 , but @xmath86 is instead _ antiperiodic _ with period  @xmath85 , @xmath87 , due to the prefactor @xmath88 , see ( [ eq9 ] ) ) .    in [ 1 ]",
    "it was proven that there indeed exists a domain , having _ infinite _ measure in phase space , of initial data @xmath89 , @xmath90 such that the corresponding solutions @xmath82 of ( [ eq11 ] ) are _ holomorphic _ in @xmath68 in the disk @xmath80   and this fact implies the existence of an open domain , having as well _ infinite _ measure in phase space , of corresponding initial data @xmath32 , @xmath91 such that the corresponding solutions @xmath92 of ( [ eq4 ] ) are _ completely periodic _ with period @xmath83 , @xmath93 . in the following section  3 we show that the singularities of the solutions  @xmath82 of ( [ eq11 ] )   considered as functions of the complex variable @xmath68  are _ branch points _ of _ square - root _ type , and in section  4 we infer from this that , whenever the solution  @xmath82 of  ( [ eq11 ] ) has a _",
    "finite _ number of such branch points _ inside _ the circle  @xmath74   generally nested inside each other , namely occurring on different riemann sheets   then the corresponding solution @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) , considered as a function of the _ real _ `` time '' variable @xmath6 , is again _ completely periodic _ , albeit now with a period which is an _ integer multiple _ of @xmath83 .",
    "we also infer that when instead the solution @xmath82 of ( [ eq11 ] ) has an _ infinite _ number of such _ square - root _ branch points _ inside _ the circle @xmath74  again , generally nested inside each other , namely occurring on different riemann sheets   then the corresponding solution @xmath92 of ( [ eq4 ] ) , considered again as a function of the _ real _ `` time '' variable @xmath6 , may be _ not periodic _ at all indeed it generally behaves _ chaotically _",
    "( actually , strictly speaking , the _",
    "chaotic character _ is not a property of a single solution , it rather has to do with the _ difference _ among the long - time _",
    "_ _ _ behavior of a solution and those of _ other _ solutions which emerge from _ almost identical _ initial data  see below ) .",
    "finally let us report a remarkable property of the system of odes ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "first of all we recall a trivial result , namely that the center of mass of the system ( [ eq4 ] ) ,    @xmath94    rotates uniformly with period @xmath83 , see ( [ eq6 ] ) , since clearly these equations of motion , ( [ eq4 ] ) , entail @xmath95 hence @xmath96    a less trivial result is that the sum of the squares of the particle coordinates ,    @xmath97^{2},\\ ] ]    evolves as well periodically , with period @xmath85 .",
    "indeed , as shown below , the equations of motion ( [ eq4 ] ) entail @xmath98 where the hamiltonian @xmath99 , see ( [ eq5 ] ) , is of course a constant of motion .",
    "hence @xmath100    where the three constants @xmath59 , @xmath60 , @xmath101 are of course related to the initial data as follows :    @xmath102^{2},\\\\ \\label{eq21 } \\dot { \\bar { z}}(0 ) = 2i\\omega ( a - b ) = ( 2/n)\\sum\\limits_{n = 1}^{n } \\dot { z}_{n } ( 0 ) z_{n } ( 0),\\\\ \\label{eq22 } \\ddot { \\bar { z}}^{(2 ) } ( 0 ) = - ( 2\\omega)^{2}(a + b ) = - ( 2\\omega)^{2 } \\bar { z}^{(2)}(0 ) + ( 4/n)h.\\end{gathered}\\ ] ]    there remains to prove that the equations of motion ( [ eq4 ] ) entail ( [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "indeed by differentiating twice the definition ( [ eq17 ] ) one gets    @xmath103    and by using the equations of motion ( [ eq4 ] ) this yields @xmath104.\\ ] ] hence ( using again the definition ( [ eq17 ] ) , and the symmetry of the coupling constants , see ( [ eq3 ] ) ) @xmath105,\\ ] ]    and using again ( [ eq3 ] ) , as well as the hamiltonian equations @xmath106 entailed by ( [ eq5 ] ) , it is immediately seen , via ( [ eq5 ] ) , that the right - hand side of ( [ eq25 ] ) coincides with the right - hand side of ( [ eq18 ] ) .",
    "but the left - hand sides obviously coincide as well , so the result is proven .",
    "( we provided here a proof of this result for completeness , although of course this result can as well be directly inferred via the trick from the analogous finding recently proved for the system ( 2.5 )  [ 7 ] ) .",
    "in this section we discuss the analytic structure of the solutions @xmath82 of the system of odes ( [ eq11 ] ) , considered as functions of the complex variable @xmath68 , and in particular we show that the singularities of these functions are branch points of _ square - root _ type ( see below ) .",
    "these singularities are of course associated with values of the dependent variables  @xmath107 that cause the right - hand side of ( [ eq11 ] ) to diverge , namely they are associated with `` collisions '' of two or more of the coordinates @xmath107 .",
    "( by definition the `` collision '' of two or more coordinates occurs when their values coincide ; but we use inverted commas to underline that , since we are considering _ complex _ values of the independent variable @xmath68 , such `` collisions '' need not correspond to actual collisions of the `` particles '' the motion of which as the _ real _ `` time '' variable @xmath6 unfolds is described by the `` physical '' equations of motions ( [ eq1 ] ) or ( [ eq4 ] )  we shall return to this point below ) .",
    "clearly the generic case corresponds to _ two - body _",
    "collisions , occurring at some value @xmath108 such that , say ,    @xmath109    here and below , without loss of generality , when discussing two - body collisions , we focus on the two particles carrying the labels @xmath17 and @xmath110 . note that it is natural to expect that this equation , ( [ eq26 ] ) , have one or more ( possibly an infinity ) of solutions @xmath111 in the complex @xmath68-plane for any _ generic _ solution @xmath112 of the odes ( [ eq11 ] ) ; while the equations characterizing a multiple collision , say @xmath113    with @xmath114 have generally no solution at all ( for a _ generic _ solution @xmath112 of the odes ( [ eq11 ] ) ; there exist of course _ special _ solutions of the odes ( [ eq11 ] ) which feature such multiple collisions , and we discuss them below to demonstrate that they as well feature branch points of _ square - root _ type ; we moreover believe , due to the scaling character of the equations of motion ( [ eq11 ] ) , that _ completely multiple _ collisions characterized by @xmath115 are , as well as _ two - body _",
    "collisions , featured by any _ generic _ solution of ( [ eq11 ] )   as suggested by the analysis of the three - body case , see appendix  b ) .    to demonstrate that the singularity of the solution @xmath78 of the odes ( [ eq11 ] ) associated with the collision ( [ eq26 ] ) is a branch point of _ square - root _ type we introduce the following _ ansatz _ , valid in the neighborhood of @xmath108 :    @xmath116    the fact that this _ ansatz _ is consistent with the two - body - collision condition ( [ eq26 ] ) is plain .",
    "it can moreover be shown ( see appendix  a ) that this _ ansatz _ , ( 3.2 ) , is compatible with the odes ( [ eq11 ] ) , and moreover that , while the coefficients @xmath117 and @xmath118 featured by it are uniquely determined by the requirement that ( 3.2 ) satisfy ( [ eq11 ] ) , the remaining coefficients , namely the @xmath119 constants @xmath60 , @xmath120 , @xmath59 and @xmath111 , see ( [ eq28 ] ) , ( [ eq29 ] ) , and the @xmath121 constants @xmath122 , @xmath123 , see ( [ eq30 ] ) , are _ arbitrary _ ( except for the obvious requirements @xmath124 , @xmath125 )   and since altogether the number of these _ arbitrary _ constants is @xmath21 , we infer that this _ ansatz _ , ( 3.2 ) , is adequate to represent in the neighborhood of @xmath126 the _ general solution _ of the system of @xmath2 _ second - order _ odes ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "we therefore conclude that the singularities associated with the generic solution of ( [ eq4 ] ) are branch points of _ square - root _ type , since clearly this is the singularity exhibited by the right - hand sides of ( 3.2 )  on the assumption that the infinite series they feature do indeed converge in a sufficiently small neighborhood of @xmath108 .",
    "it is easily seen that this same conclusion obtains if consideration is extended to include _ multiple _ collisions , see ( [ eq27 ] ) .",
    "indeed the corresponding _ ansatz _ reads , in analogy to ( 3.2 ) ,    @xmath127    the consistency of this _ ansatz _ with the odes ( [ eq11 ] ) is also demonstrated in appendix  a ; but note that , as shown there , only the @xmath128  constants @xmath60 , @xmath120 , @xmath111 appearing in the right - hand side of  ( [ eq31 ] ) , and a common rescaling factor , say @xmath59 , of the @xmath129 coefficients @xmath130 , as well as the constants @xmath122 , @xmath123 appearing in the right - hand side of ( [ eq32 ] ) , are now _ arbitrary _ ; so , the _ ansatz _ ( 3.3 ) features altogether @xmath131 arbitrary constants .",
    "hence for @xmath132 this _ ansatz _ does _ not _ feature the full complement of @xmath21 arbitrary constants required in order that ( 3.3 ) represent , for @xmath133 , the _ general solution _ of ( [ eq11 ] )   as indeed we expected ( since we do _ not _ expect the _",
    "generic _ solution of ( [ eq11 ] ) to feature _ multiple _ collisions , at least with @xmath114 ) .",
    "let us end this section by reporting the _ similarity solution _ of ( [ eq11 ] ) that indeed features an _",
    "@xmath2-body collision_. it reads , as can be easily verified ,    @xmath134    with the @xmath128 constants @xmath60 , @xmath120 and @xmath111 arbitrary , while the @xmath2 constants @xmath135 are instead determined by the @xmath2 algebraic equations @xmath136    as it is well known ( see for instance [ 2 ] ) , in the _ integrable _ equal - coupling - constants case ,    @xmath137    the solution of ( [ eq34 ] ) is @xmath138 where the @xmath2 real numbers @xmath139 are the @xmath2 zeros of the hermite polynomial @xmath140 of degree  @xmath2 , @xmath141    note that the formula ( [ eq36 ] ) defines in fact @xmath119 different sets of coefficients @xmath142 , due to the @xmath119  possible determinations of the fourth root appearing in the right - hand side of this equation .    finally let us emphasize that these findings entail that , even in the _ integrable _ equal - coupling - constants case , see ( [ eq35 ] ) , the solutions of the odes ( [ eq11 ] ) do _ not _ possess the so - called painlev property , namely they are _ not _ free of _ movable _ branch points , indeed their branch points ( of _ square - root _ type , see for instance the special solution ( [ eq33 ] ) ) occur at values @xmath108 of the independent variable @xmath68 which are not _ a priori _ predictable , but rather depend , in the context of the initial - value problem , on the initial data .",
    "but in the _ integrable _ case the number of these branch points is always finite : they are indeed determined by the requirement that the monic polynomial of degree @xmath2 in the variable , say , @xmath143 , the @xmath2 zeros of which are the @xmath2 coordinates @xmath144 ( and the coefficients of which are themselves polynomials of degree @xmath2 in @xmath68 ) , have a _ double zero _ ( see for instance  [ 2 ] ) .",
    "in this section we analyze the implications of the findings of the previous section 3 as regards the periodicity of the solutions of the odes ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "we know of course that , if a solution @xmath82 of ( [ eq11 ] ) is holomorphic as a function of the complex variable @xmath68 _ inside _ the circle @xmath74 ( see section  2 )   and we know that such solutions do exist , in fact in the context of the initial - value problem they emerge out of a set of initial data which has _",
    "infinite _ measure in the phase space of such data  [ 1 ]   then the solution  @xmath92 of ( [ eq4 ] ) that corresponds to it via ( 2.4 ) is _ completely periodic _ with period  @xmath83 , see  ( [ eq6 ] ) ,    @xmath145    but the transformation ( 2.4 ) actually implies , as already noted in section  2 , an additional information , namely that in this case @xmath92 is _ completely antiperiodic _ with period @xmath85 , @xmath146    note that ( [ eq39 ] ) implies ( [ eq38 ] ) , while of course ( [ eq38 ] ) does not imply ( [ eq39 ] ) .",
    "let us instead assume that a branch point of a solution @xmath112 of ( [ eq11 ] ) , occurring , say , at @xmath108 , does fall _ inside _ the circle @xmath147 in the complex @xmath68-plane ( see section  2 ) .",
    "then , due to the _ square - root _ nature of this branch point , see ( 3.2 ) , the evolution of the solution  @xmath112 of ( [ eq11 ] ) as the _ real _ time variable  @xmath6 unfolds is obtained by following the _ complex _ time - like variable @xmath68 as it travels ( 2.4 ) along the circular contour @xmath147 on a _ two - sheeted _ riemann surface .",
    "clearly the change of variable ( [ eq9 ] ) , ( [ eq10 ] ) entails then that the corresponding solution  @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) is just as well _ completely periodic _ with period @xmath83 , see ( [ eq38 ] ) , although in this case ( [ eq39 ] ) does no more hold . and",
    "of course this conclusion holds provided _ only one _ branch point of the solution @xmath82 of ( [ eq11 ] ) falls inside the circle @xmath74 in the main sheet of the riemann surface associated with this solution , and _ no other _ branch point occurs inside the circle @xmath147 in the second sheet of this riemann surface , namely on the sheet entered through the cut associated with the branch point occurring inside @xmath74 on the main sheet of the riemann surface ( of course this riemann surface might feature many other sheets associated with other branch points occurring elsewhere hence not relevant to our present discussion ) .",
    "let us now continue this analysis by considering , more generally , a solution @xmath82 of  ( [ eq11 ] ) that possibly contains more than one branch point inside the circle @xmath74 in the main sheet of its riemann surface ( that do not cancel each other ) so that by traveling along the circle @xmath74 _ several _ additional riemann sheets are accessed from the main sheet , and let us moreover assume that , on these additional sheets , _ additional _ branch points possibly occur inside the circle @xmath147 which give access to other sheets , and that possibly on these other sheets there be _ additional _ branch points and so on .",
    "let in conclusion @xmath148 be the _ total number _ of _ additional _ sheets accessed by a point traveling around and around on the circle @xmath74 on the riemann surface associated with the solution @xmath78 of ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "this number @xmath148 might coincide with the total number of branch points occurring , inside the circle  @xmath74 , on this riemann surface   on all its sheets   or it might be smaller . indeed , since each of these branch points is of _ square - root _ type , each of the associated cuts   if entered into   gives access to _",
    "one additional _ sheet . but",
    "not all these sheets need be accessed ; the total number @xmath148 that are actually accessed depends on the structure of the riemann surface , for instance no _ additional _ sheet at all is accessed if there is no branch point on the _ main _ sheet of the riemann surface   even though other branch points may be present inside the circle  @xmath74 on other sheets of the riemann surface associated with the solution @xmath82 of ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "( it might also be possible that different branch points cancel each other pairwise as is the case for two branch points that are on the same sheet inside the circle @xmath74 and generate a cut that starts at one of them and ends at the other ) . in any case the overall time requested for the point",
    "@xmath149 traveling on the riemann surface to return to its point of departure ( say , @xmath150 on the _ main _ sheet ) is @xmath151 , since a half - period @xmath85 , see ( [ eq10 ] ) , is required to complete a tour around the circle @xmath74 on each sheet , and the number of sheets to be traveled before getting back to the point of departure is overall @xmath152 ( including the _ main _ sheet ) .",
    "hence in this case , as the real time @xmath6 evolves , the solution @xmath78 of ( [ eq11 ] ) will be _ completely periodic _ with period @xmath151 .",
    "hence ( see ( 2.4 ) ) if @xmath148 is _ even _ the corresponding solution @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) will be _ completely antiperiodic _ with the same period @xmath151 , @xmath153 = - \\underline { z } ( t)$ ] , and _ completely periodic _ with the `` odd '' period @xmath154 , @xmath155 = \\underline { z } ( t)$ ] .",
    "if instead @xmath148 is _ odd _ , the solution @xmath82 of ( [ eq11 ] ) as well as the corresponding solution @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) will both be _ completely periodic _ in  @xmath6 with the period @xmath151 ( which might be `` even '' or `` odd ''   of course , as an integer multiple of the basic period @xmath83 ) , @xmath156 = \\underline { z } ( t)$ ] ( so , in this case , the trajectories of @xmath81 will display no symmetry , in contrast to the previous case ) .    in this analysis the assumption was implicitly understood that the total number @xmath148 of _ additional _ sheets accessed by traveling around and around on the circle @xmath74 on the riemann surface associated with the solution @xmath112 of ( [ eq11 ] ) be _ finite _ ( a number @xmath148 which , as we just explained , might coincide with , or be smaller than , the total number of branch points of that riemann surface that are located _ inside _ the circle @xmath74 in the complex @xmath68-plane ) ; and moreover we implicitly assumed that no branch point occur exactly on the circle @xmath74 .",
    "let us now elaborate on these two points .",
    "if a branch point @xmath111 occurs exactly on the circle @xmath74 , then the `` physical '' equations of motion ( [ eq4 ] ) become singular , due to a particle collision occurring at the _ real _ time @xmath157 defined @xmath158 ( see ( [ eq6 ] ) ) by the formula @xmath159/(2i\\omega).\\ ] ] indeed it is easy to check via ( 2.4 ) that the condition that @xmath157 be _ real _ coincides with the requirement that the corresponding value of @xmath111 , as given by ( [ eq40 ] ) , fall just on the circular contour @xmath74 in the complex @xmath68-plane .",
    "the singularity is of course due to the divergence , at the collision time @xmath160 , of the right - hand side of the equations of motion ( [ eq4 ] ) ; there is however no corresponding divergence of the solution @xmath81 , which rather has a branch point of _ square root _",
    "type at @xmath160 , see ( 3.2 ) .",
    "but of course this entails that the speeds of the colliding particles diverge at the collision time @xmath161 proportionally to @xmath162 , and their accelerations diverge proportionally to @xmath163 .",
    "there is no _ a priori _ guarantee that the number of branch points inside @xmath74 of a solution  @xmath78 of ( [ eq11 ] ) be _ finite _ , nor that the number @xmath148 of _ additional _ sheets accessed according to the mechanism described above by moving around the circle @xmath74 on the riemann surface associated with that solution @xmath164 of ( [ eq11 ] ) be _ finite _ ( of course @xmath148 might be _ infinite _ only if the number of branch points inside @xmath74 is itself _ infinite _ ) .",
    "obviously in such a case @xmath165 , although the complex number @xmath166 , see ( [ eq10 ] ) , considered as a function of the _ real _ `` time '' variable @xmath6 , is still periodic with period @xmath85 , neither the solution @xmath82 of  ( [ eq11 ] ) , nor the corresponding solution @xmath92 of ( [ eq4 ] ) , will be periodic . the question that might then be raised is whether such a solution  in particular , such a solution @xmath81 of the `` physical '' newtonian equations of motion ( [ eq1 ] ) corresponding to the many - body problem characterized by the hamiltonian ( 1.2 )   displays a `` chaotic '' behavior , namely , in the context of the initial - value problem , a `` sensitive dependence '' on the initial data .",
    "we shall return to this question below .",
    "so far we have discussed the relation among the analytic structure of a solution @xmath82 of  ( [ eq11 ] ) and the corresponding solution @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) .",
    "let us now return to the simpler cases considered at the very beginning of this analysis and let us consider how the _ transition _ from one of the two regimes described there to the other occurs in the context of the initial - value problem for ( [ eq4 ] ) , and correspondingly for ( [ eq11 ] ) , see  ( 2.6 ) .",
    "hence let us assume again that the initial data for ( [ eq4 ] ) , and correspondingly for ( [ eq11 ] ) ( see ( 2.6 ) ) , entail that no branch point of the corresponding solution  @xmath112 of ( [ eq11 ] ) occurs _ inside _ the circular contour @xmath74 on the _ main _ sheet of the associated riemann surface , so that the corresponding solution  @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) satisfies both ( [ eq38 ] ) and ( [ eq39 ] ) .",
    "let us imagine then to modify with continuity the initial data , for instance by letting them depend on an appropriate scaling parameter ( a particular way to do so will be introduced in the following section  5 , as a  convenient technique to present numerical results ) .",
    "as a consequence the branch points of the solution  @xmath82 of ( [ eq11 ] ) move , and the riemann surface associated to this solution  @xmath167 of ( [ eq11 ] ) gets accordingly modified .",
    "we are interested in a movement of the branch points which takes the closest one of them on the _ main _ sheet of the riemann surface from outside to inside the circle  @xmath74 . in the process that branch point will cross the circle  @xmath74 , and",
    "the particular set of initial data that correspond to this happening is then just a set of initial data that entails the occurrence of a collision in the time evolution of the many - body problem ( [ eq4 ] ) , occurring at a _ real _ time @xmath168 defined by ( [ eq40 ] ) , as discussed above .",
    "after the branch point has crossed the contour @xmath74 and has thereby entered inside the circular disk @xmath80 , the corresponding solution @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) is again collision - free but its periodicity properties are changed .",
    "one might expect that the new solution continue then to satisfy  ( [ eq38 ] ) but cease to satisfy ( [ eq39 ] ) .",
    "this is indeed a possibility , but it is not the only one .",
    "indeed , since the time evolution of the solution @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) obtains via ( 2.4 ) by following the time evolution of the corresponding solution @xmath167 of ( [ eq11 ] ) as the point @xmath169 goes round the circle @xmath74 on the riemann surface associated with that solution , the occurrence of a branch point _ inside _ the circle @xmath74 on the _ main _ sheet of that riemann surface entails that the access is now open to a second sheet , and then possibly to other sheets if , on that second sheet , there also are branch points inside the circle  @xmath147 . if this latter possibility does not occur , namely if on that second sheet there are no branch points inside the circle @xmath147 , then indeed there occurs for the corresponding solution @xmath81 of  ( [ eq4 ] ) a transition from a periodicity property characterized by the validity of both  ( [ eq38 ] ) and  ( [ eq39 ] ) , to one characterized by the validity of ( [ eq38 ] ) but not of ( [ eq39 ] ) .",
    "if instead there is a least one branch point in the second sheet inside the circle @xmath74 , then the periodicity  if any   featured after the transition by the solution @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) depends , as discussed above , on the number @xmath148 of sheets that are sequentially accessed before returning   if ever   to the _ main _ sheet .    to simplify our presentation",
    "we have discussion above the _ transition _ process by taking as point of departure for the analysis the _ basic periodic solution _   that characterized by the validity of both ( [ eq38 ] ) and ( [ eq39 ] ) , the existence of which has been demonstrated in  [ 1 ]   and by discussing how a continuous modification of the initial data may cause a  transition to a different regime of periodicity , with the transition occurring in correspondence to the special set of initial data that yields a solution characterized by a particle collision , namely a set of initial data for which the newtonian equations of motion become singular at a finite _ real _ time @xmath170 ( defined @xmath171 ) .",
    "but it is clear that exactly the same mechanism accounts for every transition that occurs from a solution @xmath86 of ( [ eq4 ] ) characterized by a type of periodicity to a solution @xmath172 of ( [ eq4 ] ) characterized by a different periodicity regime   or by a lack of periodicity .",
    "the final point to be discussed is the question we postponed above , namely the character of the _ nonperiodic _ solutions @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) ( if any ) , which we now understand to be characterized , in the context of the mechanism described above , by access to an endless sequence of different sheets   all of them generated by branch points of _ square - root _ type   of the riemann surface associated with the corresponding solution @xmath112 of  ( [ eq11 ] ) .",
    "the following two possibilities can be imagined in this connection   which of course does not entail they are indeed both realized .    the first possibility  which we surmise to be the most likely one to be actually realized",
    " is that an _ infinity _ of such relevant branch points occur quite closely to the circular contour @xmath74 , hence that there be some of them that occur arbitrarily close to @xmath74 .",
    "this then entails that the corresponding _ nonperiodic _ solutions @xmath81 of  ( [ eq4 ] ) manifest a  _ sensitive dependence _ on their initial data ( which we consider to be the signature of a  _ chaotic _ behavior ) .",
    "indeed a modification , however small , of such initial data entails a modification of the pattern of such branch points , which shall cause some of them to cross over from one to the other side of the circular contour @xmath147 .",
    "but then the two solutions @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) corresponding to these two assignments of initial data  before and after the modification , however close these data are to each other  will eventually evolve _ quite differently _",
    ", since their time evolutions are determined by access to two _ different _ sequences of sheets of the riemann surfaces associated with the two corresponding solutions @xmath82 of ( [ eq11 ] )   two riemann surfaces which themselves need not be very different ( to the extent one can make such statements when comparing two objects having as complicated a structure as a riemann surface with an _ infinite _ number of sheets produced by an _ infinite _ number of branch points of _ square - root _ type ) . so this is the mechanism whereby a _ chaotic _",
    "behavior may develop for the system ( [ eq1 ] )   but of course not in the _ integrable _ case with equal coupling constants ( in that case , as mentioned above , the number of branch points of the solutions @xmath112 of ( [ eq11 ] ) is always _ finite _ , since the @xmath2 coordinates @xmath173 are in this case the @xmath2 zeros of a polynomial of degree @xmath2 the coefficients of which are polynomials in the variable @xmath68 [ 2 ] ) .",
    "note that the emergence of such a chaotic behavior would not be associated with a local exponential divergence of trajectories in phase space  it would be rather analogous to the mechanism that causes a chaotic behavior in the case of , say , a triangular billiard with angles which are irrational fractions of @xmath174   a chaotic behavior also not due to a local separation of trajectories in phase space , but rather to the eventual emergence of a different pattern of reflections ( indeed of any two such billiard trajectories , however close their initial data , one shall eventually miss a reflection near a corner which the other one does take , and from that moment their time evolutions become quite different ) .",
    "a different possibility , which we consider unlikely but we can not _ a priori _ exclude at this stage of our analysis , is that _ nonperiodic _ solutions @xmath86 of ( [ eq4 ] ) exist which are associated with a riemann surface of the corresponding solutions @xmath167 of ( [ eq11 ] ) that , even though it possesses an _ infinite _ number of relevant branch points inside the circular contour @xmath74 , it features all of them   or at least most of them , except possibly for a _ finite _ number of them   located in a region well inside @xmath74 , namely separated from it by an annulus of _ finite _ thickness .",
    "clearly in such a case two _ nonperiodic _ solutions @xmath81 of ( [ eq4 ] ) which emerge from sufficiently close initial data separate slowly and gradually throughout their time evolution , hence they do _ not _ display a _ sensitive dependence _ on their initial data   hence , in such a case there would be solutions which are _ nonperiodic _ ( nor , of course , multiply periodic ) but which nevertheless do not display a _ chaotic _ behavior   or , to be more precise , there would be sets of initial data , having nonvanishing measure in the phase space of initial data , which yield such _ nonperiodic _ ( yet _ nonchaotic _ ) solutions .",
    "as indicated by its title , this paper is mainly focussed on the _ periodic _ solutions . in the following section  5",
    "the analysis of their phenomenology given in this section is complemented by the display of numerical simulations",
    ". we shall also exhibit solutions which appear _ nonperiodic _ and perhaps _ chaotic _ , although such characteristics can of course never be demonstrated with complete cogency via numerical examples .",
    "in this section we display several numerical solutions of the newtonian equations of motion ( [ eq4 ] ) with    @xmath175    hence ( see ( [ eq6 ] ) ) @xmath176    these results confirm graphically the findings discussed in the preceding section  4 . the strategy of our presentation is to exhibit a sequence of numerically - computed solutions of ( [ eq4 ] ) with ( [ eq41 ] ) corresponding to different choices of initial data , for various models characterized by an assignment of the number @xmath2 of particles and of the values of the coupling constants @xmath36 ( that are always assumed to satisfy the symmetry property ( [ eq3 ] ) , @xmath177 )",
    ". for obvious reasons of simplicity , see below , we restrict consideration to @xmath178 and @xmath179 . for each model",
    "we consider sequences of motions characterized by sets of initial data linked to each other by the formulas    @xmath180    of course with @xmath181 . here",
    "@xmath182 is a _ positive _ rescaling parameter the different values of which identify different sets of initial data ( while the data @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath185 , @xmath186 are kept fixed ) .",
    "the motivation for such a choice is that , as it can be easily verified by rescaling appropriately the dependent and independent variables ( see ( 2.3 ) and ( 2.6 ) with ( [ eq41 ] ) ) , these sets of initial data ( 5.2 ) identify different solutions @xmath81 of the system of odes ( [ eq4 ] ) with ( [ eq41 ] ) that correspond to different solutions @xmath82 of the system of odes ( [ eq11 ] ) related to each other by the following change of initial data , @xmath187    this , as can be easily verified , entails these solutions @xmath188 are related to each other merely via a rescaling of dependent and independent variables by a constant factor . hence all these solutions are associated to the _ same _ riemann surface except for a shrinking of the complex @xmath68-plane by a common factor  which , as can be readily verified , is just @xmath189 .",
    "therefore , in the context of the discussion of the preceding section  4 , to analyze the motions yielded by the initial data ( 5.2 ) one can just imagine to multiply the diameter of the circle @xmath74 by the factor @xmath189 without modifying the riemann surface   so that larger values of @xmath182 entail that more branch points fall within @xmath74 .",
    "so for small enough values of @xmath190   namely for initial conditions characterized by large particle coordinates hence by large interparticle separation and by large initial velocities almost `` orthogonal '' to the initial positions ( see ( 5.2a , b ) )   the circle @xmath191 shrinks to a small enough radius so that it contains no branch points , hence the corresponding motion ( solution of ( [ eq4 ] ) with ( 5.2a , b ) ) is _ completely periodic _ with period @xmath192 , see ( [ eq38 ] ) and  ( 5.1b ) , and moreover it features the symmetry property ( [ eq39 ] ) . as @xmath190",
    "gets increased one goes through the scenarios described in section  4   since , as we concluded above , such an increase can be interpreted as amounting merely to an increase of the radius of the circle  @xmath191 , causing thereby more and more branch points to be enclosed by it .",
    "for very large  @xmath190 this process can cause _ all _ branch points to be enclosed _ inside _",
    "@xmath191 , a situation which is of course equivalent , as regards the periodicity of the solutions of ( [ eq1 ] ) as functions of the _ real _ time variable @xmath6 , to all of them being _ outside _",
    " hence the expectation , that for very large @xmath190 the motion be again _ completely periodic _ with period @xmath192 and also symmetrical , see ( [ eq38 ] ) , ( [ eq39 ] ) ( but this need not necessarily happen , since the possibility that the solution @xmath188 possesses branch points at infinity can not be excluded ) .",
    "this expectation is indeed confirmed by some of the examples reported below , while in other cases for very large @xmath190 the numerical simulations become too difficult to be performed reliably , and the corresponding trajectories become unsuitable for transparent display   note that for very large @xmath190 the particles are initially all very close to the origin ( hence to each other ) and with large initial velocities , see  ( 5.2a , b ) .",
    "but in this paper we do not elaborate on the numerical aspects , except to reassure the skeptic reader that we made sure in each case of the reliability of the results presented below ; we refer for more details to  [ 6 ] .",
    "let us however note that , while one might think that a useful check of the accuracy of the computation is provided by a verification that the numerically evaluated coordinates @xmath27 indeed imply that the collective coordinates @xmath193 respectively @xmath194 , see ( [ eq14 ] ) respectively ( [ eq17 ] ) , evolve periodically with periods @xmath192 respectively @xmath195 according to ( [ eq16 ] ) respectively ( [ eq19 ] ) , these tests are in fact not at all cogent : indeed , even poorly evaluated coordinates @xmath196 tend to yield collective coordinates @xmath193 and @xmath197 that evolve properly .",
    "this happens because the equations of motion that determine the evolution of the collective coordinates @xmath193 and @xmath198 are in fact so simple ( see ( 2.7 ) and ( 2.8 ) ) , that numerical errors made in the integration of ( [ eq4 ] ) tend to cancel out when @xmath193 and @xmath199 are evaluated .",
    "let us also note that , in all the examples considered below , we assigned for simplicity real integer values to the coupling constants ; but we did check in every case that the qualitative character of the motions does not change if these coupling constants are replaced by ( neighboring ) values which are neither entire nor real .",
    "the first example we consider is characterized by the following parameters :    @xmath200    and by the following values of the parameters @xmath183 , @xmath184 , @xmath201 , @xmath202 characterizing the initial data via ( 5.2 ) : @xmath203    the following table 5.1 provides an overview of the main features ( periodicity , symmetry ) of the motions that emerge from initial data determined by ( 5.2 ) with ( [ eq43 ] ) , as well as an indication of the figures ( if any ) where the corresponding trajectories are displayed .",
    "here and always below the trajectories of particle @xmath17 , @xmath110 respectively @xmath128 are shown in red , green , respectively blue ( and below , those of particle @xmath119 in yellow ) .",
    "whenever we felt such an additional indication might be usefully displayed we indicated with a black diamond the _ initial _ position of each particle ( at @xmath204 ) , with a black dot the position at a subsequent time @xmath205 ( generally chosen to coincide with some fraction of the period , @xmath206 , with @xmath207 a conveniently chosen _ positive integer _ ) , and with smaller black dots the position at every subsequent integer multiple of @xmath208 ( namely at @xmath209 , @xmath210 ) ; in this manner the direction of the motion along the trajectories can be inferred ( from the relative positions along the trajectories of the diamond and the larger dot ) , as well as some indication of the positions of the particles over time , as they move ( by counting the dots along the trajectory ) .",
    "of course a much more satisfactory visualization of the motions is provided by simulations in which the particle motions are displayed as they unfold over time ( as in a movie ) ; it is planned to make available soon , via the web , the numerical code suitable to perform such simulations on personal computers  [ 6 ] .",
    "let us emphasize that such simulations are particularly stunning to watch in the case of high - period trajectories , which are very complicated ( see below ) , so that the fact that the particles return eventually _ exactly _ on their tracks appears quite miraculous and is indeed a remarkable proof of the reliability of the numerical computation .",

    "the results proven in this paper provide an additional explicit instance of a phenomenon whose rather general scope has been already advertized via a number of other examples , treated elsewhere in more or less complete detail [ 14 ] .",
    "an analogous treatment to that given in this paper will be published soon [ 5 ] in the  context of the `` generalized goldfish model '' [ 8 , 2 ] , which is somewhat richer inasmuch as it features branch points the nature of which depends on the values of the coupling constants ( in contrast to the case treated herein , where all relevant branch points are of square - root type ) , and has moreover the advantage that its treatment in the @xmath211 context is directly interpretable as a genuine ( i.e. , rotation - invariant ) real many - body problem _ in the plane _ ( as discussed at the end of the introductory section  1 , this is not the case for the model considered herein   although there does exist a modified version of it in which this `` defect '' is eliminated  [ 9 ] ) . on the other hand the class of many - body problems with inverse - cube interparticle potentials , as considered herein , have been ( especially , of course , in the integrable version with equal coupling constants ) much studied over the last quarter century , while the `` goldfish '' model has not yet quite acquired a comparable `` classical '' status .",
    "of course a more detailed , if perhaps less `` physical '' , understanding of the dynamics of the model studied herein might be gained by investigating numerically the solutions @xmath188 of the equations of motion ( 2.5 ) as functions of the _ complex _ variable @xmath79 ( rather than the solutions @xmath212 as functions of the _ real _ variable @xmath6 ) , and in particular by mapping out the detailed shape of the multi - sheeted riemann surfaces associated with these solutions ; and analogous considerations apply to all the models [ 15 ] in which the `` trick '' , see section  2 , plays a key role .",
