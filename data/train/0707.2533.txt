    "hadrons which are not represented by minimal @xmath6 ( meson ) or @xmath7 ( baryon ) configurations are called exotics , and @xmath8 with baryon number @xmath9 and strangeness @xmath10 is the most prominent example .",
    "recent developments in hadron spectroscopy are largely enhanced by the discovery of the pentaquark @xmath8  @xcite .",
    "the leps group , who first observed a peak in the @xmath11 spectrum produced by the spring-8 photon beam , has confirmed the resonance in their succeeding experiment  @xcite , while many others have been unsuccessful in producing the resonance in various types of experiments  @xcite .",
    "while experimental efforts are obviously needed now , a large number of theoretical studies have been carried out to explain the mass and the width of @xmath8 , as well as its structure and reactions . at the same time , various new types of exotic hadrons have been proposed and examined .",
    "in fact , the spectroscopy of old ( ordinary ) hadrons has been reexamined , and various possibilities of multiquark components of hadrons have been pointed out . among them ,",
    "the possible 4-quark structures of the scalar mesons are not new , but rather an old idea  @xcite .",
    "the ( non - relativistic ) quark model based on @xmath12 symmetry does not easily account for the mass pattern of the lowest - lying scalar - meson nonet , ( @xmath13 ) .",
    "( @xmath3 has been indicated in @xmath14 final states in @xmath15 and @xmath16-meson decays , but has not yet been established  @xcite . )",
    "the expected mass - ordering as @xmath0 states would be @xmath17 , if we assume ideal mixing , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath18 , @xmath19 and @xmath20 . this pattern does not agree with the one from experiment .",
    "furthermore , while the scalar mesons are classified as @xmath21 states , their spin - orbit partners @xmath22 and @xmath23 states are not observed in their vicinity .",
    "a possible solution to this puzzle is to consider 4-quark exotic states for the scalar mesons  @xcite .",
    "suppose that diquarks with flavor 3 , color 3 and spin 0 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath24 are the building blocks of the scalar mesons .",
    "then the scalar nonet in the ideal mixing may appear as @xmath25 , \\nonumber\\\\ & & f_0 \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } ( u\\bar u + d\\bar d ) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2 } } \\left[(ds)(\\bar d \\bar s)+(su)(\\bar s\\bar u)\\right ] .",
    "\\nonumber\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] then one sees that the strange - quark counting successfully predicts the observed mass pattern : @xmath26 .",
    "it also explains why the @xmath27 state is isolated from @xmath28 and @xmath23 partners and thus helps to explain anomalies in the scalar - meson nonets .",
    "there are other hadrons which are pointed out to have possible exotic multi - quark components , such as @xmath29 , @xmath30 and @xmath31 , where the last one may be a baryon resonance composed of 5 quarks  @xcite .",
    "does the qcd dynamics allow such states ?",
    "we actually have a simple reasoning why the scalar mesons have significant 4-quark components . as @xmath6 states ,",
    "the scalar mesons , which have positive parity , must contain orbital excitation @xmath32 ( @xmath33-wave mesons ) .",
    "it is generally accepted that the orbital excitation in the quark model requires additional @xmath34 , for instance , as is seen from the mass differences between the positive- and the negative - parity baryons ; @xmath35 . on the other hand , the 4-quark components , @xmath36 ,",
    "may be realized in @xmath37 without orbital excitation and thus have an advantage over the @xmath33-wave excited states .",
    "in fact , the cost of having an extra @xmath6 pair may be about @xmath38 ; the average mass of @xmath39 and @xmath40 mesons . in terms of the diquarks ,",
    "the combination of two scalar diquarks in @xmath37 is quite preferable in the standard quark - model and may easily reproduce the observed spectrum of the scalar mesons .",
    "therefore it is quite interesting and important to answer the question whether qcd indeed gives multi - quark states a lower energy and induces mixings of the different fock components .",
    "our purpose in this paper is to study the possible mixing of different fock components in the qcd - sum - rule approach .",
    "it is important to establish a well - controlled formulation of the mixings of two ( or more ) types of operators in producing hadrons from the vacuum .",
    "we also examine the definition of the fock - state - mixing parameters so that we can compare the results with the predictions of the quark models . in this paper , we focus on the 4-quark components of the flavor non - singlet scalar mesons , @xmath2 and @xmath3 , and demonstrate how our formulation works in this case .    in sect .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we present the basic ideas of the qcd - sum - rule approach  @xcite and give the interpolating field operators corresponding to the @xmath0 and @xmath1 components of the scalar mesons . in sect .",
    "[ sec:3 ] , we consider the definition of the mixing parameters of the two fock components . two distinct methods of defining the mixing parameters are presented . in sect .",
    "[ sec:4 ] , we give the results of the sum rules and study their significances . the conclusion is given in sect .",
    "[ sec:5 ] .",
    "the sum rule is obtained by expressing the two - point function @xmath41|0\\rangle , \\label{eq:2 - 1}\\ ] ] in two ways .",
    "one of them is based on the operator product expansion  ( ope ) , where eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 - 1 ] ) is calculated in deep euclidean region ( @xmath42 ) and is described in terms of the qcd parameters , such as the quark condensate @xmath43 , the gluon condensate @xmath44 , the current - quark masses @xmath45 and so on .",
    "the other one is based on a phenomenological parametrization of the spectral function .",
    "the spectral function at the physical region ( @xmath46 ) is assumed to have a sharp - peak resonance at @xmath47 and continuum at @xmath48 : @xmath49 the sum rule is obtained by matching the two expressions so that the mass of the resonance , @xmath50 , and the other phenomenological parameters can be determined from the qcd parameters .",
    "the two expressions of the correlators are connected by a dispersion relation . to simplify the sum rule , we approximate the continuum spectrum as the same form of the spectral function on the ope side .",
    "we further apply the borel transformation , which is , @xmath51 where the limit is taken with @xmath52 fixed .",
    "it suppresses large-@xmath53 region by the factor of @xmath54 , and thus the pole contribution is enhanced . due to the @xmath53 derivatives , the subtraction terms vanish .",
    "the borel transformation also suppresses the effects of the higher - dimensional terms in the ope .",
    "we employ the following local operators for @xmath55 : @xmath56 where @xmath57 , represent the color and @xmath58 .",
    "the 2-quark operator , @xmath59 , is uniquely determined , while a specific 4-quark operator , @xmath60 , is taken so as to consist of two @xmath61-diquark operators .",
    "the flavor structure of @xmath60 is arranged to be @xmath62 , and thus identical to @xmath59 .",
    "similarly , the 2-quark and the 4-quark operators for @xmath3 are given by the @xmath63 rotation from the fields for @xmath2 , _",
    "i.e. _ , @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 - 4 ] ) .",
    "the number of independent 4-quark operators is discussed in a previous paper  @xcite .",
    "there are two kinds of flavor - octet 4-quark operators : i.e. , @xmath65 and @xmath66 .",
    "each kind allows five independent operators ; thus altogether there are ten possible operators .",
    "it is , however , difficult to find the most suitable operator for the qcd sum rule of the scalar mesons . in ref.@xcite ,",
    "the authors attempt to find the best combination .",
    "it is interesting to employ such an operator for the present method , while the computation may be much more complicated .",
    "we here employ , instead , the simplest one composed of the @xmath67 scalar diquarks , @xmath68 and @xmath69 , which are supposed to be bound most strongly .",
    "our results of the ope side are listed in appendix [ ap : a ] .",
    "the ope is truncated after the dimension-6 terms for @xmath70 ( see eq .",
    "( [ eq : app1 ] ) ) . in order to deal with the same order of power corrections ,",
    "we expand @xmath71 ( eq .  ( [ eq : app2 ] ) ) up to dim-9 and @xmath72 ( eq .  ( [ eq : app3 ] ) ) up to dim-12 . high dimensional operators , such as @xmath73 and @xmath74 are evaluated by the vacuum - saturation approximation .",
    "we consider the diagrams containing the @xmath6 annihilation in order to take into account the mixing of different fock states .",
    "the quark - pair annihilations are substituted by @xmath43 or @xmath75 ( see fig.[fig:2 - 1 ] ) . because the interpolating fields ( [ eq:2 - 4 ] ) have the normal ordering ,",
    "the perturbative part of the @xmath6 annihilation must disappear . because the ope is represented as a polynomial in @xmath76 , only the zero - th order term survives in the @xmath77 limit .",
    "the main goals of this study are to determine whether the scalar mesons are dominated by @xmath0 or @xmath78 , and if they are mixed , to calculate their probabilities .",
    "it turns out that such a mixing is not easily quantified .",
    "it would be natural to consider the strengths of the couplings of the 2-quark and 4-quark operators to the physical state and then evaluate the mixing angle .",
    "however , such a procedure is strongly dependent on the definition and normalization of the local operators .",
    "indeed , a numerical factor can be easily hidden in the local operators and thus the magnitudes of the coupling strengths are ambiguous .",
    "this problem happens to be more fundamental than just the definition of the operators . in quantum mechanics , mixings of fock states",
    "may occur if the hamiltonian contains terms which change the number of particles .",
    "then the wave function of an eigen - state can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the fock components , each of which is normalized properly . in the field theory , however , the fock - space separation may not be unique as the number of quarks , which is defined by the number of quarks @xmath79 number of antiquarks , is not a conserved quantum number",
    ". one may not be able to `` measure '' the number of quarks without ambiguity because no conserved charge corresponding to the number of quarks is available .",
    "thus we have to consider the concept of the `` number of quarks '' in the context of the quantum - mechanical interpretation of the field - theoretical state .    here , we propose two ways to define the ratio of the fock - space probability by taking the mixing of @xmath0 and @xmath80 in the scalar ( @xmath2 ) meson as an example .    in the first approach , we define local operators `` normalized '' in the context of a full 4-quark operator @xmath60 in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 - 4 ] ) .",
    "in fact , the 4-quark operator @xmath60 contains @xmath6 component , which is obtained by contracting the @xmath81 pair by the quark condensate : @xmath82 we regard @xmath83 and @xmath84 as `` normalized '' 2-quark and 4-quark fields , respectively .",
    "the quark condensate gives the dimension of normalization .",
    "using @xmath85 and @xmath86 , we define the mixing parameter , @xmath87 , by @xmath88 this definition happens to be equal to defining @xmath87 so that @xmath89 couples to the physical state most strongly : @xmath90 where @xmath91 denotes the wave function of the center - of - mass motion of @xmath2 ( i.e. , a plane wave for a momentum eigenstate ) .",
    "then the mixing parameter can be evaluated from the following three correlation functions with an assumption that the poles are at the same position : @xmath92 |0\\rangle & & \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\hspace{-10em}=\\delta(p^2-m^2)|\\lambda|^2 \\cos^2 \\theta + \\mathrm{cont . } , \\nonumber\\\\    \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\mathrm{im}\\>i\\!\\int d^4\\!x \\>e^{ipx } \\langle 0|t[j_4^\\prime(x)(j_4^\\prime)^\\dagger(0 ) ] |0\\rangle & & \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\hspace{-10em}=\\delta(p^2-m^2)|\\lambda|^2 \\sin^2 \\theta + \\mathrm{cont . } , \\nonumber\\\\    \\frac{1}{\\pi}\\mathrm{im}\\>i\\!\\int d^4\\!x \\>e^{ipx } \\langle 0|t[j_2^\\prime(x)(j_4^\\prime)^\\dagger(0 ) ] |0\\rangle & & \\nonumber\\\\    & & \\hspace{-10em}=\\delta(p^2-m^2)|\\lambda|^2 \\frac{\\sin 2\\theta}{2 } + \\mathrm{cont . } .",
    "\\label{eq:3 - 3 }   \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] this definition of the mixings is model independent , but it depends on the choice of the local operators .",
    "therefore , it does not necessarily have a direct relation to the mixing parameters employed in the quark models .    in order to define a mixing angle more appropriately to the quark models",
    ", one may determine the normalization of the operators using quark - model wave functions .",
    "for instance , the local operators in eq .",
    "( [ eq:2 - 4 ] ) , can be normalized to the wave functions of @xmath0 or @xmath78 states in the mit bag model : @xmath93 where @xmath94 represent the flavor and @xmath57 represent the color .",
    "then we compute the matrix elements @xmath95 where @xmath96 denotes the center - of - mass wave function of the bag - model state .",
    "now , assuming the bag - model states ( with definite number of quarks ) are normalized properly , one can use @xmath97 and @xmath98 for the normalizations of the operators @xmath59 and @xmath60 , respectively .    in calculating the mixing parameter",
    ", one needs only the ratio of @xmath97 and @xmath98 , which is given by @xmath99 where @xmath100 is the bag radius and gives the dimensional scale of the normalizations of the two operators that have different dimensions .",
    "we here assume that the bag radius of the @xmath6 state is same as that of @xmath36 state .",
    "this assumption may be necessary to consider their mixing in the physical state .",
    "it is , in fact , not a bad assumption because the bag radius of the @xmath0 state must be larger , because of the relative @xmath33-wave motion , while that of the 4-quark state is large , because it has more quarks .",
    "thus , the physical state for @xmath2 is given by the mixings of the two states : @xmath101 note that here the factor @xmath102 is necessary to keep the phases of the 2- and 4-quark states in accord so that the mixing parameter can be defined as a real parameter .",
    "in the qcd sum rules , the mixing parameter with the bag - model normalization can be calculated as @xmath103 this definition is model dependent , but it gives a direct interpretation associated with the quark model .",
