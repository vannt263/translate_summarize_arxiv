    "there is plenty evidence for magnetic fields on the scale of the earth , the solar system , the interstellar medium , galaxies and clusters of galaxies [ for the extragalactic magnetic field see review by kronberg ( 1994 , k94 ) and references therein ] .",
    "we still do nt know however whether any larger scale magnetic fields exist .",
    "there are various upper limits on the rms value of the cosmological magnetic field , but the upper limits are still too high to exclude any relevance to magnetic fields observed on smaller scales .",
    "cosmological magnetic fields might help to resolve the bothersome question of the origin of the @xmath17 g magnetic field which exists on galactic scales or fields of similar size seen on the scales of galaxy clusters . a primordial ( pre  galaxy formation )",
    "magnetic field amplified by the gravitational collapse , and then by processes like differential rotation and dynamo amplification ( parker 1979 ) , can serve to seed these observed smaller scale magnetic fields .",
    "the most stringent upper limits to date for magnetic fields on cosmological scales come from three different sources :    1 .   big bang baryonic nucleosynthesis ( bbn ) .",
    "+ magnetic fields that existed during the bbn epoch would affect the expansion rate , the reaction rates , the electron density ( and possibly the space - time geometry ) . by taking all these effects into account in the calculation of the element abundances , and then comparing the results with the observed abundances one can set limits on the magnetic field amplitude .",
    "the limits for homogeneous magnetic fields on scales @xmath18 ( distances are quoted in comoving coordinates ) and up to the bbn horizon size ( @xmath19 ) are @xmath20 g in terms of today s values ( grasso & rubinstein 1995 , 1996 ; cheng , olinto , schramm , & truran 1996 ) .",
    "the relevance of these limits for the maximum value of magnetic field seeds on the subgalactic scale is obvious , but in order for these limits to be relevant to the intergalactic magnetic field , further assumptions about the super - horizon magnetic field power spectrum and the magnetic field generation epoch should be made .",
    "2 .   the cmb radiation . + the presence of magnetic fields during the time of decoupling causes anisotropy , different expansion rates in different directions ( zeldovich & novikov 1975 ) . masden ( 1989 ) provides a useful formula for the connection between the measured temperature fluctuations on a given scale at @xmath21 , the decoupling time , and the limits on the equivalent scale today . for a magnetic field energy density much smaller than the matter energy density ,",
    "the limit is @xmath22 for typical values of @xmath23 ( the hubble constant in units of @xmath5 km s@xmath6 mpc@xmath6 ) , temperature fluctuations of @xmath24 , @xmath25 and @xmath26 the limit becomes @xmath27 g .",
    "recently , barrow , frreira , & silk ( 1997 ) used the cobe 4-year data to constrain the magnetic field on the horizon scale by @xmath28 ng .",
    "3 .   multipole expansion of @xmath0 observations .",
    "+ passing through a magnetoionic medium , polarized light undergoes rotation of the polarization vector ( faraday rotation , for definition see  [ sec : corr ] ) .",
    "the rotation amount is proportional to the dot product of the magnetic field and the light propagation direction , and to the distance the light travels through the medium . if any cosmological magnetic field exists , the farther away the source , the more the polarized light component is rotated .",
    "we refer to this as the  monopole \" term .",
    "this term exists even if the field has no preferred direction on the horizon scale , namely even without breaking the isotropy hypothesis .",
    "+ if there is a preferred direction to the field on a cosmological scale , a dipole will show up in the @xmath0 measurements across the sky , due to the different sign of the dot product ( and thus the different rotation direction ) .",
    "so far attempts have been made only to identify a monopole or a dipole in the magnetic field for scales of @xmath29 ( kronberg 1976 ) and @xmath30 ( valle 1990 ) .",
    "the search for a dipole signature in the faraday rotation values for a sample of extra - galactic sources ( qso ) yields limits of @xmath31 ng depending on the assumed cosmology ( kronberg & simard - normandin 1976 , kronberg 1976 ) .",
    "valle ( 1990 ) tried to estimate the limits on the dipole and the monopole terms and concluded that an all - prevailing ( up to @xmath32 ) field must be smaller than @xmath33 $ ] ng .    other potential methods of detecting a possible cosmological magnetic field include distortion of the acoustic (  doppler \" ) peak in the cmb power spectrum ( adams , danielsson , grasso , & rubinstein 1996 ) and faraday rotation of the cmb radiation polarized components ( loeb & kosowsky 1996 ) .",
    "these methods where not designed to probe any magnetic field generated after recombination .",
    "their implementation is still pending on the upcoming measurements of the cmb fluctuations and polarization .",
    "a method that does probe magnetic fields generated in the post recombination era , relies on cosmic ray ( cr ) detection .",
    "the effect of magnetic fields on high energy crs ( @xmath34 ev ) is twofold .",
    "it will first alter the energy distribution of crs ( lee , olinto , & sigl 1995 , waxman & miralda - escud 1996 ) and then , if the cr direction is identified and attributed to a known region or source , the magnetic field either smears the directionality ( for field coherent scales much smaller than the distance to the source ) or deflects the cr direction from aligning with the source direction .",
    "current limits from this last effect are either very weak or non - existing",
    ".    theories for primordial magnetic fields in the framework of structure evolution paradigms have been suggested by a number of authors .",
    "magnetic fields on cosmological scales emerge in the framework of these theories in one of three epochs : the inflation era , the plasma era , and the post - recombination era . in the inflation era ,",
    "magnetic fields form due to quantum mechanical processes ( turner & widrow 1988 ; quashnock , loeb , & spergel 1989 , vachaspati 1991 , ratra 1992a , 1992b , dolgov & silk 1993 ) or possibly magneto - hydrodynamics ( brandenburg , enquist , & olesen 1996 ) . during the plasma era , prior to recombination , magnetic fields form due to vorticity caused by the mass difference between the electron and the proton ( harrison 1973 , but see rees 1987 ) , or where magnetic field fluctuation survival ( no vorticity assumed ) depends on the fluctuation scale ( tajima 1992 ) .",
    "other authors have pointed out that even in the post recombination era ( but before galaxy formation ) magnetic fields can be generated by tidal torques ( zweibel 1988 ) , or by cosmic strings wakes ( ostriker & thompson 1987 , thompson 1990 ) .",
    "magnetic field generated in the process of structure formation itself , due to falling matter ( pudritz & silk 1989 ) , or star burst regions , are less likely to feed back into the intergalactic space and to affect the cosmological magnetic field .",
    "nevertheless , proposals in this spirit were also considered by taking into account wind driven plasma which fills intergalactic space with magnetic fields .",
    "whatever the origin of cosmological magnetic fields , each suggested theory , specifies the magnetic field amplitude and power spectrum shape .",
    "thus , each of the theories can in principle become refutable if we could measure , or put limits on , the normalized power spectrum of the cosmological magnetic field .",
    "this challenge and the realization that with existing or upcoming data , it will be possible to measure the magnetic field power spectrum has led us to develop a method for doing so .",
    "we argue that much better estimates ( or upper limits ) for the cosmological magnetic field can be calculated by using the rm correlation matrix .",
    "all previous attempts to limit the cosmological magnetic field dipole on very large scales ( @xmath35 ) , suffer from two drawbacks . from a theoretical point of view",
    "it is difficult to reconcile the necessary anisotropy such a dipole imposes with other evidence which suggest global isotropy . from a practical point of view",
    ", this test is confined to one scale , and does nt allow measurements over a whole range . only by extending the measurement to a whole range , can one estimate the full power spectrum ( ps ) . although contribution from a  random walk \" can be useful even if only a monopole is calculated ( see below )",
    ", the information is partial , inferior to the full derivation of the magnetic field by @xmath0 correlations , and sensitive to evolutionary effects .",
    "why is the correlation approach more advantageous than other type of statistics and in particular why is it better than the monopole approach ? in the monopole approach we are looking for a correlation between rm values and the source redshift .",
    "let s pretend at first that all measurements are exact and there are no noise sources ( we ll notice in  [ sec : calc ] that these two assumptions are far too optimistic ) .",
    "consider a scale @xmath36 over which the magnetic field is coherent with an rms value of @xmath10 .",
    "a line - of - sight to a source at a distance @xmath37 will cross @xmath38 such regions . there is no correlation in the magnetic field orientation between the regions , and on average each one of them contributes @xmath39 .",
    "the overall contribution due to @xmath40 random walk steps sums up to @xmath41 .",
    "it is thus clear that the larger @xmath37 , the bigger @xmath42 we expect for an ensemble of sources located at @xmath43 .",
    "now let s turn to the correlation approach .",
    "two lines - of - sight to two adjacent sources ( separation angle @xmath44 and assume the same redshift for the two ) are observed for correlation between the @xmath0 values of the polarized light emanating from them .",
    "if @xmath45 the two light rays undergo _ the same _ rotation in each patch of length @xmath36 ( for small @xmath44 we neglect the difference in the @xmath46 term between the magnetic field and the line - of - sight ) .",
    "the ensemble average of the correlation term would then be @xmath47 , with the same proportionality constant as before . in the limit of @xmath48 ,",
    "the two expressions coincide , but for any value of @xmath49 , the signal from the correlation calculation is amplified by the factor @xmath50 . for example , if @xmath51 @xmath52 and @xmath53 the signal is amplified by more than an order of magnitude .",
    "moreover , the correlation provides information about the power spectrum ( different @xmath44 and @xmath37 values ) of the magnetic field that otherwise we would nt be able to obtain .",
    "the correlation also makes it easyer to separate the noise from the signal , unlike the monopole approach .",
    "we will return to this approximation later on , under more realistic considerations (  [ subsec : ston ] ) , when we attempt to evaluate the number of pairs needed in order to establish a certain signal - to - noise ratio at a given scale ( @xmath44 ) .",
    "for now , this simple model demonstrates the advantages of this paper s approach .    in order to relate actual data of rm measurements to the magnetic field ,",
    "we begin by considering the connection between the two . in section [ sec : corr ] we introduce the magnetic field correlation tensor and its connection to the rm correlation . in section [ sec : calc ] we make use of these definitions and describe the calculation procedure for the @xmath0 correlation from the raw data to the constraints on the magnetic field power spectrum . a key issue is the estimate of noise from non - cosmological contributions to the @xmath0 .",
    "the impatient reader can turn immediately to  [ subsec : ston ] to get a rough estimate for the expected signal - to - noise ratio .",
    "we demonstrate the procedure in the following section (  4 ) , where we simulate a few realistic examples of cosmological magnetic fields , and exploit them to get rm measurements from which we derive back an estimate for the original power spectrum .",
    "the simulations also allow us to perform a realistic error analysis . in section 5",
    "we discuss prospects for applying the procedure to real data and conclude with our results .",

    "recall we do not expect any depolarization due to the cosmological rm since the cosmological coherence we are after is orders of magnitude bigger ( @xmath252 a few @xmath253 ) than the source size .",
    "it is interesting to note , that even if we had perfect information about the depolarization due to the source structure and foreground screen contribution and an exact relation between the depolarization degree and the @xmath0 , we could still not subtract this derived @xmath0 from the observed one .",
    "this is due to the fact that the polarization degree does nt specify the @xmath0 direction .",
    "tribble s statistical connection between the observed depolarization and the observed rm is valid only if the correlation scale of the rm structure function for the source or the foreground screen is much shorter than the telescope beam size .",

    "otherwise the order of magnitude of an intervening galaxy contribution is obtained as follows : for a galaxy seen face - on , where there is a danger of a well ordered magnetic field , the disc thickness , to which the magnetic field is presumably connected is of the order of kpc ( simard - normandin & kronberg 1980 ) .",

    "however , we do not expect any correlation between the magnetic field orientation of galaxies along the line - of - sight , or galaxies adjacent ( in angle ) to each other .",
    "the worst contribution to the rm , could only come from a random walk of @xmath256 steps where @xmath256 is the number of foreground screens ( intervening systems ) along the line - of - sight . since one can model the probability for an intersecting system along the line - of - sight as a function of the source redshift ( welter , perry , & kronberg 1984 ; lanzetta , wolfe , & turnshek 1995 ) , another noise term can be added .",

    "such a limit naturally reduces the noise term of @xmath257 and does not affect the correlation signal . as a matter of fact , a sequence of such depolarization limits , may be helpful in constituting the estimate for @xmath257 .",
    "there are yet more methods for minimizing the number of sources that manifest internal rm as we shall point out when we consider real observations (  [ sec : discuss ] ) .      in the current stage of research",

    "the rest of the parameters are identical to those of the part sky coverage ( @xmath295 ) of the last section .",
    "we notice that the power index is somewhat better constrained in an all sky coverage , especially if the amplitude ( or @xmath10 ) are assumed or known from some different source .",
    "the true values are recovered to within the @xmath339 level .",
    "moreover such coverage allows us to calculate all prevailing magnetic fields on the sample scale , expressed as @xmath340 with @xmath341 the dirac delta function and @xmath159 the sample depth .",
    "notice , however that using the formalism proposed in section [ sec : corr ] , we can not take into account power spectra that are not functions of @xmath342 alone so this test is a bit weaker than the dipole test .    -1.5truecm",
    "5truecm = 2.7 in -1truecm",
    "we have presented the formalism for the rm correlation function and demonstrated that by using it we can put limits on the power spectrum of the cosmological magnetic field .",
    "these limits are more stringent than limits obtained by any other method that currently exists",
    ". limits of @xmath343 level for magnetic field of @xmath198 ng on inter - cluster scales ( @xmath344 ) can be devised with only @xmath345 sources .",
    "the increment of the source number reflects linearly in the @xmath10 limits .",
    "we performed the statistical analysis following a bayesian approach that seems to be the most adequate for this problem .",
    "the correlation method we propose is also less susceptible to systematic effects such as observational bias ( or bias due to evolution ) toward smaller internal rm measures for higher redshift sources . both of these biases tend to lower the expected correlation signal as the source redshifts increase , whereas a cosmological magnetic field tends to raise the correlation signal between such sources .    in order to estimate the statistical significance of limits as derived by the proposed method , we have simulated a few possible cosmological magnetic fields .",
    "the simulations allow us to have a fair estimate of the errors involved in the power spectrum derivation .",
    "the analysis depends , however on a few assumptions , and most crucially on the ability to eliminate or estimate the foreground screen and internal contribution to the observed rm .",
    "this crucial point can be addressed in the process of the sample compilation .",
    "reduction of the foreground screen and internal rm contribution is achievable by applying two cutoff criteria to the sample .",
    "the first cutoff in minimal polarization degree is meant to avoid sources that exhibit large depolarization degree .",
    "these sources are usually interpreted as having a big non - cosmological contribution to their measured rm .",
    "the second cutoff is for sources that do not follow a @xmath346 dependence of the rm .",
    "following laing s ( 1984 ) recipe , in order to minimize the number of sources with internal rm , the wavelength span should allow detection of deviation from the @xmath346 dependence of the rm for @xmath347 .",
    "should this deviation occur , the source is to be eliminated from the catalog as a suspect for substantial internal rm contribution",
    ".      the spatial coverage of the sky should be twofold .",
    "small patches of a few square degrees enable the small separation pair number needed for noise reduction .",
    "small patches , however , can not reveal large correlation scales in an effective way .",
    "it is thus desirable to compile a dilute all sky coverage sample , in addition to the high number density patches off the galactic plane .",
    "the two sampling strategies cover a large range of potential correlation scales , without the necessity for an all - sky dense sample .",
    "the all sky coverage should preferably look for sources in proximity to the mask sources directions in order to minimize the galactic noise term .",
    "accurate internal rm for these sources should be evaluated through depolarization measurements in order for them to be useful for the power spectrum evaluation .",
    "ultimately , the sample can always be mimicked in terms of the exact source locations in the framework of all and every detected model .",
    "exact imitation of the source locations ensures the right correlation terms in the correlation matrix .",
    "the limits we have derived here are a combination of limits on the free electron average density , @xmath348 , and the magnetic field .",
    "if by any other fashion ( like hii absorption ) an estimate for @xmath349 can be achieved , then the limits on @xmath79 will become more robust .",
    "the estimate is also a function of the assumed cosmology , and may be entangled with magnetic field evolution in the post recombination era .",
    "we havent modeled such evolution in this paper .",
    "this method of rm correlation can further be generalized to the _ smoothed _ rm correlation .",
    "the data can be smoothed on a certain angular scale , and then either compared to the expectation value predicted by a model , or inverted numerically to give limits on @xmath79 . the bayesian approach , though ceases to be advantageous in the smoothed case , because even though the noise terms decrease , the smoothing introduces correlation among the errors , and the statistical interpretation becomes more hazardous .",
    "a nice feature of the proposed analysis is that it is bound to yield results",
    ". these can be either limits on the magnetic field magnitude , or actual detection of its value .",
    "either way , these results may help in lifting the curtain over the mystery of the cluster and galactic magnetic fields origin .",
