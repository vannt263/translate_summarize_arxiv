    "tests have been performed in the past to study the effects of radiation damage to the silicon vertex tracker ( svt ) sensors and to their front - end electronics  @xcite , but the reduction of charge collection efficiency ( cce ) after irradiation has never been measured quantitatively . in addition , it has never been directly demonstrated that a svt module can be operated normally after substrate type - inversion .",
    "this is expected to happen at a dose of @xmath5 mrad , based on measurements performed on test structures from the same wafers . to address these issues",
    "a module identical to those used in the inner layer of the svt , with the front - end electronics connected , has been irradiated with a 0.9 gev electron beam .",
    "a total peak fluence of @xmath6 , corresponding to a peak dose of 9.3 mrad , has been delivered to the silicon .",
    "a second module , which has not been irradiated , has been used as a control sample to track variations in the environmental conditions .",
    "the  experiment  @xcite , at the slac pep - ii @xmath7 storage ring  @xcite , has the primary physics goal of precisely measuring -violating asymmetries and rare branching fractions in @xmath8 meson decays .",
    "pairs are produced in head - on collisions between 9.0 gev electrons and 3.1 gev positrons . since a very large sample of @xmath8 decays",
    "is needed , pep - ii was designed to deliver the high peak luminosity of @xmath9 ( the production cross section is @xmath10 = 1.1 nb ) the silicon vertex tracker  @xcite was installed in  in early 1999 and has been reliably operated for five years , providing excellent and efficient vertexing and tracking information .",
    "it is composed of five layers of 300 @xmath11 m thick , double - sided microstrip detectors .",
    "p@xmath12 strips on one side and orthogonally - oriented n@xmath12 strips on the other side are implanted on a high - resistivity n@xmath13 bulk . they are ac - coupled to the electronics via integrated decoupling capacitors .",
    "the detectors are operated in reverse mode at full depletion , with bias voltage @xmath14 typically 10 v higher than the depletion voltage @xmath15 ( which lies in the range 25 v ",
    "the leakage current per unit area under these conditions , prior to installation in , is lower than 100 na/@xmath16 at room temperature .",
    "the main source of background in the svt comes from electromagnetic showers originating in the material of the beam - line by off - momentum beam particles ( @xmath17 ) , which are over - bent by the permanent dipole magnets located in the proximity of the interaction point to separate the two beams . a significant fraction of this background is expected to be composed of electrons and positrons with energies of a few hundreds of mev .",
    "their non - ionizing energy loss ( niel ) , using the asymptotic value of the displacement cross section for 200 mev calculated in  @xcite , is about twelve times lower than that of 1 mev neutrons at equal fluence , and the niel - normalized damage constant @xmath18/niel has been estimated in previous measurements to be about one third than that of neutrons  @xcite : @xmath19    the dose absorbed by the silicon , which is measured by means of 12 silicon p - i - n diodes close to the inner layer of the svt , varies strongly as a function of the azimuthal angle around the beamline , and is highly peaked in a narrow region of the ( horizontal ) bend plane of the machine , following a roughly gaussian distribution with @xmath20 mm .",
    "the inner layer of the svt , located at a radius of 3.3 cm from the beam line , receives the highest dose . at design luminosity the average dose for the silicon of the inner layer",
    "was expected to be 33 krad / yr , peaking to 240 krad / yr in the horizontal region .",
    "the detectors were therefore originally designed to withstand up to 2 mrad of total radiation dose , which would have been reached in ten years of running only in the inner horizontal region of the svt , and which is expected to be less than the dose at which bulk type - inversion occurs . however , excellent pep - ii performance has been significantly higher than expected .",
    "the peak instantaneous luminosity has reached @xmath21 , three times the design value , and is expected to increase up to @xmath22 .",
    "a thin horizontal region of the inner part of the detector has thus already received the dose budget of 2 mrad and will receive 9 mrad by 2009 , whereas a larger fraction of silicon in the inner layers away from the horizontal plane should accumulate a dose between 2 and 5 mrad by the same date .",
    "the basic idea of the measurement is to use a 1060 nm led , whose attenuation length @xmath23 mm is deeper than the 300 @xmath11 m of the silicon thickness , to generate charges in the sensors .",
    "the charges then drift in the fully depleted silicon and the signals induced on the microstrip electrodes on the two sides of the detectors are amplified by the front - end electronics .",
    "each readout strip of the sensors , whose pitch is 50 @xmath11 m on the n - side and 100 @xmath11 m on the p - side , is connected to one of the 128 channels of the atom ic  @xcite .",
    "the atom ic is a custom readout chip produced with a honeywell rad - hard 0.8 @xmath11 m cmos process .",
    "it is capable of simultaneous acquisition , digitization and readout .",
    "each channel of the atom ic , as shown in figure  [ fig : atom_channel ] , has an analog section consisting of a low - noise charge - sensitive pre - amplifier followed by a cr-(rc)@xmath24 shaper , whose output is coupled differentially into a comparator . the nominal gain of the pre - amplifier is 250 mv / fc .",
    "the shaping time is programmable , with a minimum of 100 ns , up to 400 ns . in our measurements we used the 100 ns setting , which is also used in the modules in the inner layers of the svt .",
    "the comparator threshold is controlled by an on - chip 6-bit dac ( thresh dac ) whose least significant bit ( lsb ) has a nominal value of 12.5 mv , corresponding to a charge of 0.05 fc at the pre - amplifier s input .",
    "the comparator output goes to an sram pipeline , which provides a trigger latency of 12.93 @xmath11s .",
    "when the input to the comparator exceeds the pre - set threshold , the output goes high and a series of ones is clocked into the pipeline .",
    "a calibration charge can be injected into the preamplifier by means of a 50 ff capacitor ( c@xmath25 ) connected with a switch to the pre - amplifier input and controlled by a 6-bit dac ( cal dac ) .",
    "the cal dac lsb has a nominal value of 10 mv , corresponding to a charge on c@xmath25 of 0.5 fc .        upon receipt of an external trigger , a selectable region in the pipeline",
    "is searched for a zero - to - one transition .",
    "the transition indicates a `` hit '' and the number of following ones at the comparator output , divided by the clock period , represents the time - over - threshold ( tot ) of the hit , which is stored as a 4-bit number and has an approximately logarithmic dependence on the input charge .",
    "this allows charge measurement over a broad dynamic range ( @xmath26 40 fc ) with a limited number of bits , but the limited accuracy makes the tot unsuitable for the purpose of our measurement , where a good analog resolution is needed in order to establish small drops in the cce .",
    "therefore we have turned to an alternative method of measuring the charge , based on `` threshold scans ''  @xcite .",
    "a threshold scan consists in measuring , for each read - out channel @xmath27 at fixed injected charge @xmath28 at the input of the pre - amplifier , the hit efficiency as a function of the pre - set threshold of the comparator , which is varied inside the full dynamic range .",
    "the 50% turning point of the hit efficiency versus threshold distribution is the threshold offset @xmath29 for the channel @xmath27 at charge @xmath28 , as shown in figure  [ fig : tscan ] .",
    "the threshold offset has a linear dependence on the charge which is given by the following expression : @xmath30 the pedestal @xmath31 and the gain @xmath32 of the @xmath27-th electronic channel can be accurately determined by means of calibration threshold scans , in which the silicon is not illuminated by the led , and a known amount of charge @xmath28 is injected at the input of the pre - amplifier by closing the switch which connects it to the 50 ff capacitor c@xmath25 . @xmath33 and @xmath34 are found by performing calibration threshold scans with different known charges @xmath28 and fitting the @xmath35 vs @xmath28 distribution with a linear function .",
    "when the led is used to generate charge in the silicon , the charge at the input of the pre - amplifier of the @xmath27-th channel is @xmath36 , where @xmath37 is the total charge release by the led in the silicon , which is proportional to the led intensity , @xmath38 is the local charge collection efficiency of the detector and @xmath39 accounts for division of the charge between the channels and the angular distribution of the led power . when the detector is fully depleted and the electric field intensity is sufficient to collect almost all the charge , @xmath40 ( for both sides ) and the cce , as a function of the reverse bias voltage applied to the silicon , saturates . in our case the led is current - driven and the light flux is proportional to the led current , therefore @xmath41 . in a threshold scan performed with the silicon illuminated by the led with current @xmath42 therefore the offset of the @xmath27-th channel is given by @xmath43    from threshold scans at different values of the led current one can extract for each channel the slope @xmath44 by performing a linear fit to the @xmath45 vs @xmath42 distribution . by dividing the slope @xmath46 for the electronics",
    "gain @xmath34 and summing over all channels we obtain therefore a quantity which is proportional to the average cce in the silicon region illuminated by the led : @xmath47    by comparing the sum @xmath48 before and after the irradiation of the detectors we can therefore monitor the relative cce drop .",
    "the led is a current - driven eg&g c30116 model , with peak wavelength @xmath49 = 1060 nm , risetime @xmath50 10 ns , typical peak flux vs led current @xmath51 mw / a .",
    "it is connected through a 1 k@xmath52 resistor to a gpib - controlled pulser .",
    "a thin brass foil with a 500 @xmath11 m diameter pinhole is placed at a distance of 3 mm from the led lens surface .",
    "a converging lens with focal length @xmath53 = 45 mm is placed at a distance of 90 mm from the pinhole and at the same distance from the module plane , thus ensuring that the pinhole image is focused in the module plane . in our measurements",
    "the light emitted from the led enters the silicon from the n@xmath12-doped ( ohmic ) side .",
    "the dimension of the luminous spot has been chosen to be narrower than the region in which the cce , after irradiation with a beam with @xmath54 2 mm , is supposed to change , but at the same time it is large enough that the uncertainty in the relative alignment of the led and the silicon detectors ( @xmath55100 @xmath11 m ) has a negligible impact on the uncertainty on the measured cce . the led , the pinhole and the lens are mounted inside a brass cylinder attached to a mechanical arm of a gpib - controlled x - y stage . a picture of the mechanical setup is shown in figure  [ fig : mechanical_setup_cce ] .",
    "the charge generated in the silicon is controlled by changing the amplitude of the pulse driving the led .",
    "we have selected a range of amplitudes in which the led response is linear and the signal at the shaper output remains within the limited dynamic range of the thr - dac , as shown in figure  [ fig : linearity ] .",
    "( the 50% hit efficiency turn - on point ) as a function of the amplitude of the pulse driving the led ( dots ) .",
    "the result of a linear fit to this distribution is superimposed ( solid line).,width=336 ]    the measurement process is fully automated : a workstation controls the motion of the x - y stage and the voltage setting of the pulser via gpib connections , while at the same time controls through an ethernet interface a vme - based computer which is responsible for sending trigger signals to the pulser and to the readout section of the front end electronics .",
    "an example of the distribution of @xmath56 vs channel measured with this setup is shown in figure  [ fig : led_spot ] : the peak width is consistent with the pinhole size and the readout pitch of the strips .",
    "divided by the electronic gain @xmath34 as a function of the readout channel @xmath27 .",
    "a peak in the channels illuminated by the led is clearly visible .",
    "the integral of the peak is proportional to the average charge collection efficiency in the illuminated area .",
    ", width=336 ]    once the @xmath56 distribution has been measured , an offline algorithm identifies the position of the peak , evaluates the baseline in channels away from the peak , and computes the baseline - subtracted sum @xmath48 over the whole peak , which is proportional to the average cce in the point illuminated by the led .",
    "repeated tests on the control module have shown that the single measurement resolution is about 2% .",
    "alignment in the relative position between the module and the x - y stage and aplanarity effects have been found to introduce negligible degradation in the cce resolution .",
    "moreover , no significant variation ( compared to the 2% intrinsic resolution ) of the measured cce has been observed over a period of several hours of continuous operations .",
    "however , differences up to 10% have been found in cce measurements performed in different runs .",
    "for this reason the cce measured for the irradiated module has always been normalized to the average cce measured , with a high number of samplings , in a fixed set of points of the control module in the same environmental conditions .",
    "the module irradiation has been performed at the elettra synchrotron facility in trieste with a 0.9 gev electron beam .",
    "the irradiation has been performed in six steps reaching a total peak dose of about 9 mrad .",
    "two pictures of the module setup are shown in figures  [ fig : module_irradiated ] and  [ fig : setup_at_elettra ] .    during each irradiation",
    "step the module is mounted on a x - y stage , which is located at the end of the linac and is remotely controlled from the linac control room through a serial connection .",
    "the alignment of the module and of the x - y stage is such that the detector surface lies in a plane @xmath57 orthogonal to the beamline ( @xmath58 axis ) , and the module can be moved , by means of the x - y stage , along the @xmath59 and @xmath60 directions .",
    "the silicon surface is a rectangle measuring @xmath61 mm in the @xmath59 direction , which is parallel to the orientation of the p@xmath12 strips , and 82.6 mm in the @xmath60 direction , which is parallel to the orientation of the n@xmath12 strips .",
    "the module thickness along the @xmath58 direction is 300 @xmath11 m .",
    "prior to the irradiation a radiochromic dosimetry film is placed close to the surface of the silicon , to keep track of the beam position during the irradiation .",
    "another radiochromic film is placed above the chip region to check that the electronics does not receive a significant dose , thus avoiding the need in the cce measurement to disentangle effects caused by radiation damage to the silicon from effects caused by damage to the electronics .",
    "a third radiochromic film is attached to the edge of the metal frame which hosts the module and is irradiated for a few seconds ( to avoid saturation ) to obtain an image of the beam profile , which is necessary to perform the alignment between the detector and the beam and is used to estimate the beam profile . the beam spot obtained with this method",

    "the beam has a gaussian profile whose width along the @xmath59 axis , accurately measured by digitizing and analyzing the spot obtained on the radiochromic dosimetry film irradiated for a few seconds , is @xmath621.4 mm . by moving the module with constant velocity @xmath63 1",
    "mm / s along @xmath60 , a 50 mm long region of the silicon is irradiated , with a dose profile which is uniform in @xmath60 and gaussian in @xmath59 , centered on the axis of the module and with width equal to the beam width @xmath64 .",
    "the beam remains several centimeters from the chips during all the irradiation .",
    "the peak fluence @xmath65 and hence the peak dose are determined from the beam spread , the speed at which the module is moved during the irradiation , the number of times @xmath66 this operation is performed and the linac current @xmath67 through the relation @xmath68 where @xmath69 c is the electron charge . for typical values ( @xmath64 = 1.4 mm , @xmath70 = 1 mm / s , @xmath67 = 30 na and @xmath66 = 10 ) , a total peak fluence of about @xmath71/@xmath3 ( corresponding to a peak dose of about 1.4 mrad ) is delivered to the module in about ten minutes .",
    "the linac current is measured with 4% accuracy from the current flowing in a toroidal coil coaxial with the beam and is the dominating source of uncertainty in the peak fluence estimate .",
    "a less precise dose estimate , obtained from the increase in leakage current in the test structures irradiated with the detector , is used as a cross check and is consistent with the estimate from the linac current .",

    "this is shown , up to the fifth irradiation step , in figure  [ fig : cce_vs_vbias ] .     as a function of bias voltage , for the same point of the silicon and six different integrated doses .",
    "the plotted quantity is proportional to the charge collection efficiency of the silicon.,width=336 ]    for high values of the bias voltage the @xmath48 vs @xmath79 curve is characterized by a plateau over which the cce increases very little when the bias voltage is increased , corresponding to the fact that the trapping probability of charge carriers slowly decreases as long as the electric field inside the detector becomes stronger .",
    "we use the voltage value @xmath80 below which the sum @xmath81 and therefore the cce fall below 90% of the plateau value as a rough estimator for the depletion voltage @xmath15 of the silicon in the point illuminated by the led . as an example , consider the curve shown in figure  [ fig : cce_vs_vbias ] ( a ) , measured before the first irradiation step : in that case we estimate @xmath82 v , which is roughly consistent with the depletion voltage @xmath83 v measured in structure tests from the same wafer .",
    "@xmath80 is not a good estimator for the depletion voltage when @xmath15 is close to 0 v , because in that case there is a bias voltage range in which the detector is fully depleted but the electric field inside it is not intense enough to approach signal saturation . in that case @xmath80",
    "gives only an upper limit for @xmath15 : indeed , in all our measurements @xmath80 never takes values below @xmath26 10 v. however , when the depletion voltage is higher than 10 v then @xmath80 is a reasonable estimator for @xmath84 .",
