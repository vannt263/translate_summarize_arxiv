    "since their discovery dynamical heterogeneities@xcite ( dhs ) have attracted much interest as a possible route towards the explanation of the glass - transition mechanism@xcite . indeed ,",
    "the presence of these heterogeneities has already successfully explained the stokes - einstein breaking@xcite mechanism in glass - formers , the non - gaussian evolution of the van - hove correlation functions and at least a significant part of the stretching of the density autocorrelation functions or incoherent scattering functions .",
    "dynamical heterogeneities are also a key feature in several models of the glass transition ( constraint models@xcite , adam - gibbs configurational entropy model , ... ) .",
    "recently it has been found that the heterogeneities can be controlled using the isomerization of a few azobenzene molecules dispersed inside the glass - former@xcite .",
    "the origin of these induced heterogeneities may be found in the onsager regression hypothesis for small perturbations@xcite .",
    "if small external perturbations behave as the spontaneous fluctuations of the medium , then dhs can be created from small perturbations , here the azobenzene isomerizations , in the same way than spontaneous fluctuations create the spontaneous heterogeneities .",
    "note however that the way in which spontaneous fluctuations create the dhs is still not understood .",
    "despite this fact the exciting possibility to control the dhs opens a route to use this control as a new tool to test the relation between the heterogeneities and the transport properties of glass - formers , or even to use the dhs to control the transport properties of the material .",
    "indeed an acceleration of the dynamics has been reported , from simulations@xcite and experiments@xcite , in association with the induced dhs .",
    "however the different parameters that control the strength of the induced heterogeneities as well as their characteristic time , usually named @xmath4 , have first to be determined carefully . in this paper",
    "we thus raise the issue of the relation between the isomerization period and the induced dynamical heterogeneities .",
    "in particular we expect interesting couplings when the isomerization half - period @xmath0 will be equal to the relaxation time @xmath1 of the host material .",
    "we find that the heterogeneities increase with @xmath5 when the isomerization half - period is larger than @xmath1 and then decrease for smaller periods .",
    "the dhs are thus maximal for @xmath2 .",
    "note that this maximum of the heterogeneities occurs around the same period than the maximum of the diffusion , i.e. at the end of the linear diffusion regime .",
    "we simulate the photoisomerization of one dispersed red ( @xmath6 ) molecule ( @xmath7 , the probe ) inside a matrix of 500 methylmethacrylate ( @xmath8 ) molecules ( @xmath9 , the host ) .",
    "a detailed description of the simulation procedure can be found in previous works@xcite .",
    "the main differences are that : i ) the concentration of probe molecules is here much smaller and the size of the box larger .",
    "ii ) to speed up the calculations , we model the host interactions here with a recent coarse - grain potential function@xcite . for the probe molecule , we use however the same all - atom site - to - site interaction potential@xcite than previously .",
    "the density is set constant at @xmath10 .",
    "we thus have 7541 atoms in a 41.26   wide cubic simulation box .",
    "we use the gear algorithm with the quaternion method @xcite to solve the equations of motions with a @xmath11 time step .",
    "the temperature is controlled using a berendsen thermostat @xcite .",
    "we model the isomerization as a uniform closing and opening of the probe molecule shape@xcite during a characteristic time @xmath12 ; while the period of the isomerization cis - trans and then trans - cis is a variable that we refer as @xmath13 in the article .",
    "as a result @xmath0 appears as the time lapse between two energetic impulses inside the material and will be an important characteristic time in our study . in our simulations",
    "the isomerization takes place at periodic intervals whatever the surrounding local viscosity .",
    "this main approximation has recently been validated experimentally@xcite , as the viscosity necessary to stop the isomerization of this probe molecule is extremely large@xcite . in order to evaluate the possible aging of our results we make two successive simulations of @xmath14 ns each for every data presented in this paper .",
    "we then compare the results for the two different simulations .",
    "surprisingly enough the results show only slight differences in the saturation regime .",
    "however in our figures we display the most aged data or occasionally both data .",
    "finally , in this work we use a small concentration of chromophores .",
    "there is only one chromophore inside the simulation box .",
    "we use this small concentration to have , in our simulations , the smallest possible perturbations of the host material for a given isomerization rate .",
    "the main drawback due to this small concentration is that the observed effects are smaller .",
    "for very large isomerization periods @xmath13 , we expect the medium to stay unchanged or be only slightly perturbed .",
    "we expect this regime to last while @xmath15 , as when this condition is verified the time between two isomerizations is larger than the relaxation time of the material . as a result",
    "the material is in this case relaxed before that a new isomerization takes place and the medium perturbations are due to one isomerization only . in a previous study",
    "@xcite we found that the diffusion coefficient as well as the inverse of the @xmath3 relaxation time increase linearly with the frequency of isomerizations @xmath16 in that regime . according to this result we will name that regime , _ the linear regime _ as in @xcite .",
    "note that the term linear refers here to the diffusion coefficient evolution . in the linear regime",
    "we expect the isomerization - induced cooperative motions ( dhs ) to increase with the frequency @xmath17 due to the increase of the number of pulses , as each pulse has the same mean probability to initiate a cooperative motion in a relaxed material",
    ". note that this expectation will be true only if the isomerizations stimulate the dhs creation , else the cooperative motions will decrease when increasing @xmath17 as each action on the medium leads eventually to an increase of the medium effective temperature . for larger frequencies",
    "we expect finally the cooperative motions ever to saturate or to decrease due to the host softening .",
    "we will name that regime _ the saturation regime _ referring to the saturation of the diffusion that appears for large frequencies@xcite .      in order to now investigate the coupling between the isomerization period @xmath13 and the isomerization - induced dynamic heterogeneities",
    ", we display in figures 1 and 2 for various isomerization rates , two different quantities that measure the dhs , namely the non - gaussian parameter and the four - points dynamic susceptibility .",
    "the non - gaussian parameter @xmath18 is defined as :    @xmath19    and we used the following definition for the dynamic susceptibility @xmath20@xcite :    @xmath21    with @xmath22 here , @xmath23 denotes the volume of the simulation box , @xmath24 the number of molecules in the box , and @xmath25 .",
    "the symbol @xmath26 stands for a `` discrete mobility '' window function , @xmath27 , taking the values @xmath28 for @xmath29 and zero otherwise . in our calculations",
    "we have used the parameter a=@xmath30   that was found previously@xcite to lead to the larger @xmath31 in our system .    our simulation box is a cube , @xmath32   wide . a radius @xmath33   around the chromophore includes thus approximately the whole simulation box . however because when the distance @xmath34 from the chromophore increases the isomerization effects progressively disappear , we will focus our attention on the molecules situated within a radius @xmath35   from the chromophore .",

    "we conclude that the particularly large value of @xmath18 observed in figure 1 for @xmath51 ps is not due to an increase of cooperative motions that will result in a similar increase of the susceptibility , but to an increase of perturbed molecular motions that results from a large isomerization rate @xmath5 . if we except this period ( @xmath51 ps ) we see a very similar behavior for the susceptibility in figure 2 and the non gaussian parameter in figure 1 . for large isomerization rates ( i.e. small periods )",
    "the heterogeneity is smaller than without isomerization .",
    "for example for @xmath51 ps the susceptibility reaches only 60 percents of its value without isomerization .",
    "we thus have a localized decrease of the heterogeneity for small periods ( i.e. in the saturation regime ) .",
    "then the susceptibility increases progressively with the period and the characteristic time of the susceptibility @xmath58 also increases .",
    "when @xmath13 reaches @xmath59 ps the susceptibility is maximum and begins to decrease progressively to the @xmath41 ( i.e. iso .",

    "however the two functions are approximately constant around their maximum i.e. between these two @xmath13 values .",
    "we also note that the two functions increase similarly up to around 140 percent of their spontaneous value .     _",

    "_ 0.5 cm figure 2b shows the dynamic susceptibility evolution with the period , but with a larger radius than figure 2a .",
    "the susceptibilities are here calculated including most molecules of the simulation box .",
    "we see however in figure 2b a similar comportment than in figure 2a . the susceptibility first increase with the period , up to 140 percents of the spontaneous susceptibility maximum value .",
    "then it decreases progressively to the spontaneous susceptibility .",
    "the main differences are that : i ) the characteristic times distribution is smaller here .",
    "ii ) the maximum occurs for @xmath61 ps instead of @xmath59 ps .",
    "_ figure 2c : as in figure 2a but at a larger temperature @xmath63 . _",
    "0.5 cm figure 2c shows at a larger temperature ( t=200k ) , the dynamic susceptibility evolution with the period .",
    "again we see the same comportment .",
    "the characteristic times are however smaller and a maximum of @xmath31 is reached for @xmath64 ps instead of @xmath59 ps .",
    "note that for @xmath65 ps all curves collapse to the iso off @xmath41 susceptibility , showing that the induced dhs disappear for large periods .",
    "to summarize , figures 1 and 2 show , for distances @xmath37   from the isomerizing chromophore , first an increase of the dhs with @xmath17 and then a rapid decrease .",
    "these increase and rapid decrease appear respectively in the time ranges of the linear regime and of the saturation regime .",
    "these two opposite evolutions of the heterogeneities explain why , testing glass formers under various solicitations , a number of works have found a decrease of the heterogeneities@xcite while a few others found an increase of the dhs@xcite .",
    "note that the increase of these cooperative motions appears for small solicitations only , and is thus much more difficult to observe experimentally than the opposite evolution .",
    "the increase of the dhs with @xmath17 shows that the isomerizations stimulate the cooperative motions in the linear regime .",
    "this result confirms the conclusion of ref.@xcite .",
    "in contrast , in the saturation regime the dhs decrease sharply around the chromophore .",
    "this decrease of the heterogeneities for large frequencies below the level of spontaneous dhs , means that we can also destroy the heterogeneities using the isomerizations .",
    "this is an interesting result as it makes possible a test of the dhs effect on the dynamics by destroying the heterogeneities when and where they appear , using the chromophores as maxwell demons .",
    "note that a similar test is also possible from a stimulation of the heterogeneities in the linear regime .    for frequencies",
    "@xmath17 in between the two regimes ( @xmath2 ) , the medium is still unaffected but we expect non linear contributions due to the interactions between excitations ( i.e. the isomerizations induced fluctuations ) .",
    "these nonlinearities contain informations about the facilitation mechanism , because the facilitation can be seen as an interaction mechanism between excitations .",
    "a previous study has shown@xcite that the saturation regime is related to the appearance of increasingly soft regions around the chromophores surrounded by harder regions .",
    "however soft regions , characterized by their smaller relaxation times , have smaller dhs , because the heterogeneities follow the relaxation time of the medium .",
    "thus we interpret the decrease of the heterogeneities in the saturation regime as arising from the increased softening around the chromophores . in another similar picture",
    "the softening is equivalent to a local increase of the effective temperature of the host material that will also lead to a decrease of the heterogeneities .",
    "this comportment may change however at larger radii from the chromophore , as the heterogeneity of the structure may lead to a local increase of dhs at the limit between soft and hard zones .",
    "in contrast in the linear response regime the host medium is roughly not affected and thus each solicitation has the same probability to lead to cooperative motions . as a result the dhs increase with the number of solicitations per second ( i.e. with @xmath17 ) . due to this increase of the dhs followed by a decrease , we observe a maximum of the dhs for a characteristic value of the period @xmath13 that we will name @xmath66 .",
    "figures 2 show that @xmath66 increases when the temperature drops following the relaxation time of the host material .",
    "@xmath4 becomes also larger when the period @xmath13 increases ( i.e. @xmath17 decreases ) .",
    "this maximum is situated around the relaxation time of the host material ( @xmath67 ) .",
    "this relation results in an increase of @xmath66 when the temperature drops .",
    "we will now investigate the evolution of the dhs as a function of the distance from the chromophore periodic perturbation .",
    "our aim here is to test our assumption of different zones in the saturation regime that appear due to the material softening around the chromophore .",
    "figure 3a shows that , in the saturation regime , the first peak of @xmath68 decreases rapidly when we move away from the chromophore .",
    "_ figure 3a : 4-th order dynamic susceptibility @xmath57 for various distances @xmath34 from the chromophore .",
    "the isomerization rate is chosen in the saturation regime @xmath50 . from top to bottom , the distances increase by steps of @xmath42   from @xmath69   ( continuous red line ) to @xmath70   ( black dashed line ) . + _",
    "the characteristic times of the different peaks show that the first peak of @xmath68 corresponds to the dhs induced by one isomerization only while the following peaks correspond to dhs induced by multiples isomerizations .",
    "the decrease of the dhs then accelerates for @xmath71  .",
    "however while the first peak decreases rapidly when r increases , the other peaks stay roughly constant .",
    "this result shows that the effect of one isomerization is spatially limited to a radius @xmath72   around the chromophore and that successive isomerizations are necessary to induce dhs at larger distances .",
    "_ figure 3b : as in figure 3a but for a period @xmath45 in between the linear and the saturation regime .",
    "_ 0.5 cm in figure 3b we increase the period to @xmath45 in between the saturation regime ( for small periods ) and the linear regime ( for large periods ) . due to the enlargement of time separations ,",
    "the previous peaks are here replaced by two bumps , with the second bump located at the period @xmath73 .",
    "the first bump decreases when r increases , while the second bump increases .     _",
    "figure 3c : as in figure 3a but for a period @xmath47 , in the linear regime . _",
    "0.5 cm finally , figure 3c shows that in the linear regime the dhs only decrease more slightly when we move away from the chromophore .",
    "moreover all the curves calculated with @xmath74   collapse in a single curve .",
    "these results show that the dhs do propagate at large distance from the chromophore in the linear regime while they are strongly attenuated in the saturation regime .",
    "_ figure 3d : as in figure 3a but for a larger temperature t=200k .",
    "_ 0.5 cm we observe the same behavior at larger temperature in figure 3d than in figure 3a .",
    "however the spontaneous @xmath3 relaxation time @xmath75 of the material is shorter at that larger temperature . as a result ,",
    "the comportment observed at @xmath51 ps at @xmath63 is equivalent to the comportment observed for a larger period @xmath13 at the temperature @xmath76 .     _",
    "figure 3e : as in figure 3b but for a larger temperature t=200k . _",
    "0.5 cm increasing @xmath13 we finally reach the @xmath3 relaxation time of the material .",
    "figure 3e shows that in this case the heterogeneity does nt depend anymore on the distance to the chromophore s perturbation .",
    "the relative susceptibility is approximately equal to one , showing that we are observing mainly the spontaneous susceptibility in that figure .",
    "the dhs increase with @xmath17 in the linear regime , originates from the increase in the excitations concentration @xmath77 with @xmath17 . in order to understand better this process we will now study the evolution of the excitation concentration with the isomerization rate .",
    "we define here excitations as molecules that move at time @xmath78 more than a distance @xmath79   within a time lapse @xmath80 .",
    "the excitation concentration is then defined as : @xmath81     _ figure 4a : isomerization - induced excitation concentration ( no unit ) @xmath82 versus the isomerization rate @xmath16 at a temperature t=130k , in a logarithmic scale .",
    "inset : same figure but in a linear scale .",
    "the induced excitations concentration increases as a power law @xmath83 @xmath84 ( blue dashed line ) with the isomerization rate and then saturates to a concentration @xmath85 ( green dashed line ) .",
    "_   _ figure 4b : as in figure 4a but at the larger temperature t=200k .",
    "_    0.5 cm figure 4a and 4b show the excitation concentration evolution with the isomerization rate at two different temperatures , chosen as the lowest temperature that can be properly equilibrated without isomerization ( t=130k ) and the highest temperature ( t=200k ) for which the heterogeneities are still relatively large .",
    "figures 4 show that for both temperatures the induced excitation concentration @xmath82 evolves as a power law of the isomerization rate @xmath86 and then saturates .",
    "this evolution is reminiscent of the evolution of the inverse of the relaxation time and of the diffusion coefficient@xcite , that also increases ( but linearly ) and then saturates .",
    "the evolution law is approximately the same for both temperatures with @xmath87 for @xmath88 and @xmath89 for @xmath90 and the same power law .",
    "the saturation however appears for a larger period at low than at high temperature , a result explained by the increase of the relaxation time when the temperature drops . using the picture of excitations in a dynamically constrained system , here the dynamic constraints are created by the host material . as a result , for small enough frequencies @xmath17 ,",
    "in the linear regime we expect the dynamics to be driven by the excitation concentration only , because the host material is only slightly affected by the isomerizations in that regime .",
    "thus we explain the dhs increase with @xmath17 in the linear regime to be due to the increase in the number of excitations .",
    "similarly , we expected ( however the host material is in this case affected ) the dhs to saturate in the saturation regime , because the number of excitations saturates .",
    "but instead the dhs decrease , a result that we explain from the softening of the host material in that regime .",
    "a recent study has demonstrated @xcite that in kinetically constrained models the @xmath3 relaxation time @xmath1 is connected to the excitation concentration . in that study , the authors show that when the temperature decreases , the excitation concentration decreases , leading to larger distances between excitations and thus a smaller probability to induce the avalanches of motions that are necessary for diffusion .",
    "the authors found that as a result the @xmath3 relaxation time is related to the excitation concentration with the power law @xmath91 .",
    "our results are in qualitative agreement with that study as we also find a power law evolution of the relaxation time @xmath1 with the excitation concentration .",
    "as @xmath92 increases linearly with @xmath5 and @xmath86 we find @xmath93 .",
    "however our coefficient @xmath94 is different .",
    "we think that this difference originates from the difference in the geometry of our systems as our excitations are here concentrated around the isomerizing chromophore and not uniformly dispersed .",
    "the similarity between these two results ( @xmath95 ) supports however the idea of a similar cause for both mechanisms , i.e. the excitation concentration .",
    "in this paper we studied the coupling between the dynamic heterogeneities induced by the isomerization of chromophores diluted inside a glass - former and the isomerization period of these chromophores . to summarize our results we found that for large isomerization periods @xmath13 and small perturbations the heterogeneity increases with the isomerization rate @xmath5 . in contrast the heterogeneity decreases when the isomerization half - period @xmath0 is smaller than the relaxation time of the material @xmath1 .",
    "these two opposite behaviors appear in the same period ranges than the linear and saturation regime observed previously@xcite with the diffusion coefficient evolution . due to the increase of the dhs in the linear regime followed by a decrease in the saturation regime ,",
    "the cooperative motions are maximum for @xmath2 .",
    "we also found that the heterogeneities are induced around the chromophore at a shorter range in the saturation regime than in the linear response regime , a result that explains the saturation .",

    "interestingly , for small enough perturbations in the picture of an unchanged medium , the increase of the diffusion coefficient could lead to the ability to probe ergodically the conformational space in shorter time ranges than without isomerizations ."
