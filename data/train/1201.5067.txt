    "the presence of strong radiation fields from massive o and b stars can be detrimental to nearby star formation , when compared with star formation in the absence of nearby high - mass stars .",
    "much has been published about this phenomenon ; the ionizing radiation from massive stars can evaporate circumstellar disks around nearby low - mass stars ( partially ionized globules , i.e. pigs ; see , e.g. , laques & vidal 1979 and garay 1987 ) or can progressively ionize dense blobs of nearby molecular material , forming evaporating gaseous globules or eggs , defined explicitly by hester et al . (",
    "1996 ) as  globules of dense gas that are being photoevaporated more slowly than their lower density surroundings , and so are left behind as the gas around them is driven off . \"",
    "these terms , which describe the ionization / evaporation of gas in disks around low - mass stars , or surrounding molecular material , are rather ill - defined otherwise . the term `` proplyd '' ( photo - evaporating protoplanetary disk )",
    "is probably the best defined , and is generally accepted as referring to evaporating circumstellar disks around young , low - mass stars .",
    "an extensive literature can be found about proplyds , especially those in the orion nebula cluster ( e.g. odell , wen , & hu 1993 ; ricci , robberto , & soderblom 2008 ) , and their interpretation ( e.g. storzer & hollenbach 1999 ; johnstone , hollenbach , & bally 1998 ) . sizes and mass - loss rates of proplyds in the orion nebula cluster range from 40350 au and 0.71.5 @xmath010@xmath1  ( henney & odell 1999 ) .",
    "the eggs , first discovered in the eagle nebula , appear to be connected to ongoing star formation ; near - infrared , high angular resolution observations show that @xmath215% of the eggs in the `` elephant trunks '' of the eagle show evidence for associated young low - mass stars , and that there is also evidence for relatively massive young stellar objects at the tips of the elephant trunks ( mccaughrean & andersen 2002 ) .",

    "this paper presents hst imaging , palomar 5-m spectroscopy , spitzer irac and mips imaging , vla radio continuum imaging , and ( sub ) millimeter - wave spectroscopy using the aro smt and 12-m in order to elucidate the nature of this object and its relationship to proplyds , pigs , or eggs .",
    "i20324 was observed in an hst imaging survey of a list of candidate long - lived preplanetary nebulae ( ppns ) selected from the iras point source catalog using a color - criterion ( @xmath4 ) chosen to select objects that are dominated by relatively cool dust located at some distance from a stellar source , or where any hot dust is highly obscured ( sahai et al .",
    "all objects were required to have point - source 2mass ( jhk ) and msx ( a band/8 ) counterparts , implying the presence of local stellar sources that have heated the dust revealed in the hst and iras data .",

    "it was first detected as an emission - line nebula together with two other nebulous objects within a @xmath5 field , in a ground - based h@xmath6 $ ] survey of candidate post - agb objects ( pereira & miranda 2007 : pm07 ) .",
    "pm07 concluded that all 3 objects are  related young stellar objects \" and that the emission - line spectrum of i20324 is indicative of photoionization rather than shock - excitation .    independently , i20324 has been noted recently by wright et al .",
    "( 2012 : wetal12 ) , who included it among a group of 10  proplyd - like objects \" associated with the cygnus ob2 association .",

    "they suggest that these and the other objects they identified are  a unique class of photoevaporating partially embedded young stellar objects \" .",
    "in contrast , we find that our data favor the egg hypothesis .",
    "we obtained optical images of i20324 on 2006 - 07 - 22 using hst s wide - field camera ( wfc ) of the advanced camera for surveys ( acs ) , which has a plate scale of 0050/pixel , using the f606w ( @xmath7 , @xmath8 ) and f814w ( @xmath9 , @xmath10 ) filters .",
    "a 2-point dither was used for the imaging with a total exposure time of @xmath11s per filter .",

    "the cometary knot has a diametrically - opposed faint counterpart seen only in the f814w filter  the simplest interpretation of these features together is that they represent scattered light from the lobes of a collimated bipolar outflow directed along the polar axis of a flared disk ( or dense equatorial region ) tilted such that the near - side of the disk lies to the nw of the bright apex of the knot .",

    "a second nearby peak coincides with the goldfish .",

    "sparse mapping of the hco@xmath50 j=32 emission shows that it is also extended e - w .",
    "there is also extended , structured emission in the velocity range @xmath61 to @xmath62  that is not connected spatially or kinematically with the tadpole or goldfish , but likely comes from the same complex of progenitor molecular clouds that spawned them .",

    "assuming lte conditions , we find ( using the ratran online code : van der tak et al . 2007 ) , that the peak @xmath49co j=2 - 1 line intensity ( @xmath65k ) and observed line - width ( 2 ) , imply a total column density @xmath66@xmath67 , assuming a standard interstellar @xmath49co / h@xmath30 abundance ratio of @xmath68 ( e.g. , hayashi et al . 1993 ) .",
    "this gives a total molecular mass of 3.7  for i20324 .",
    "assuming a similar kinetic temperature and abundance for source b , we find its mass is about 1.3  ( its peak @xmath49co j=2 - 1 line intensity is about half that of i20324 ) .",
    "our mass estimates are likely lower limits because the  standard \" value adopted for the @xmath49co / h@xmath30 abundance ratio may be too large since a significant fraction of co ( and @xmath49co ) may have been photodissociated in a pdr that occupies much of the volume of the tadpoles .",
    "the tadpole is detected at all wavelengths from the near- to the far - infrared , with point - source counterparts in the 2mass , msx , iras , and akari catalogs : the spectral energy distribution ( sed)is shown in fig.[i20324sed ] .",
    "we have also included the iras low resolution spectrum ( lrs ) spectrum for the tadpole ( with a correction of the absolute calibration applied as described by cohen , walker , and witteborn ( 1992 ) ) . since the lrs data were rather noisy , we increased the s / n ratio by binning the spectrum to a factor 3 lower resolution : a weak 10  silicate dust feature can be seen in absorption .",
    "the irac photometry was extracted from cygnus - x catalog , whereas the mips photometry was derived from the legacy cygnus - x images using aperture photometry .",
    "the core of the 24  image of i20324 is partly saturated , so we used the bright airy ring at a radius of 26.5  from the center ( 4th ring ) for measuring the flux ; our estimate of 37jy is consistent with the iras flux value . comparing the spitzer photometry with that from missions having lower angular resolution ( _ red _ symbols ) at similar wavelengths ( 24 and 70 ) , we find that the former ( hereafter the  small aperture \" fluxes ) fall systematically below the latter at @xmath69 .",
    "this indicates the presence of an extended source of warm dust at these wavelengths heated by the external radiation field , in addition to the compact central source , which looks point - like out to a wavelength of at least 24 .",
    "the large mid- and far - ir fluxes of this point - source imply the presence of a substantial mass of circumstellar dust around the tadpole s central star .",
    "the total source luminosity of the tadpole derived from integrating the  small aperture \" sed is about 500 , implying that the tadpole s central star is not a low - mass star . from an inspection of pre - main - sequence stellar evolutionary tracks by bernasconi & maeder ( 1996 ) , we find that our estimated luminosity implies a stellar mass of around 5  if the star has just begun deuterium burning , or somewhat lower if it is approaching the main - sequence .",
    "we fitted i20324 s  small aperture \" sed using the online tool provided by robitaille et al.(2007 ) , which computes least - squares fits of pre - computed models of young stellar objects ( ysos ) having disks and rotationally - flattened infall envelopes ( with biconical outflow cavities ) , to user - defined seds .",
    "we set the input distance range to d=1.31.6kpc .",
    "the input interstellar extinction range was set to @xmath70 , based on our estimate of @xmath71 using the numerical algorithm provided by hakkila et al .",
    "( 1997 ) , which computes the 3-dimensional visual interstellar extinction and its error from inputs of galactic longitude , latitude , and distance , from a synthesis of several published studies .",
    "the best - fit model has d=1.4kpc , @xmath72 , and a central star mass , @xmath73  and effective temperature , @xmath74k ; the model spectrum shows the presence of a weak silicate absorption feature as observed ( fig.[i20324sed ] ) . in this model , the full opening angle of the bipolar outflow cavity is @xmath75 , and the outflow cavity axis is inclined at a modest angle of @xmath76 , to the line - of - sight .",
    "the next best model has d=1.4kpc , @xmath77 , @xmath78 , @xmath79k , @xmath80 , and @xmath76 , however the depth of the silicate feature relative to the continuum , is twice that observed . in both models , almost all of the emitting mass",
    "is associated with the envelope .",
    "these models are qualitatively consistent with the optical appearance of the luminous central source , with scattered light from the inner regions of the near - side bipolar cavity producing the cometary knot seen in the hst image , and its farside counterpart being obscured by the dense inner equatorial region of the envelope .",
    "the value of the de - projected opening angle in the best - fit model , @xmath81 , lies in the range covered by the inner and outer opening angles of the knot ( @xmath82 ) .",
    "we note that the minimum inclination angle in the model is @xmath76 , so it is possible that a better fit might have been obtained with a smaller inclination angle which would result in a larger value of @xmath83 . however , a better 10  spectrum covering the silicate feature ( i.e. , with higher s / n and a small aperture ) is needed before the derived parameters from the above modelling can be put on a firm footing .",
    "we note that there are several tadpole - shaped objects in the vicinity of i20324 that share with the latter a common e - w head - tail orientation .",
    "these are : ( i ) the goldfish ( outside the field - of - view in our hst images ; # 8 in wetal12 ) , ( ii )  object c \" of pm07 seen faintly in the 8.5ghz , hst and spitzer images , which has a relatively small tail ( # 9 in wetal12 ) , ( iii ) and an object at ra=20:34:45.9 , dec=41:14:46.5 in the irac images of this region ( # 10 in wetal12 ) .",
    "the common e - w orientation strongly suggests these structures are shaped by the ram pressure of a passing wind from a distant source or sources located to the west of these objects , with material being ablated from their heads and blown eastwards . noting that the tails in both the tadpole and goldfish are bright on their northern sides ( both in the optical and in the radio ) , we conclude that this is due to asymmetric irradiation of these objects by the ultraviolet radiation field of the cyg ob2 no .",
    "8 cluster that lies to nw of the tadpole and goldfish , at a separation of about 900(@xmath26pc ) .",
    "the tadpole and its associates are most likely small , dense molecular cores near the cyg ob2 complex that are being subjected to photoevaporation by the strong uv radiation field due to the large number of o stars in this massive star formation region . the presence of additional young stars ( objects @xmath20 , @xmath21 , and @xmath22 : sahai et al .",
    "2012 , in preparation ) in close physical proximity to i20324 s cometary knot indicates that several young stars have formed within the dense molecular core inside the head of the tadpole .",
    "the small tails associated with @xmath20 and @xmath21 may represent ( i ) winds from these stars interacting with the nw outflow of , or ( ii ) possibly photoevaporation of their circumstellar disks by radiation from , the tadpole s central star .",
    "the curvature of @xmath20 s tail away from the tadpole s head may be due to interaction with the compressed  wall \" of gas in the latter ( note that the wall curves around both the back and the front , so @xmath20 could be located quite close to the rear tadpole wall ) .",
    "the physical processes responsible for producing the radio - bright peripheries of the tadpole and its associates are likely the same ones that operate in the vicinity of the m16 ( eagle nebula ) elephant trunks ( lateral width @xmath84 cm ) where dense , dusty molecular clouds are being eroded by photoevaporation due to radiation from o stars at a distance of @xmath85 cm from the trunks , producing a photoevaporative flow .",
    "the heads of these trunks appear in emission - line images as limb - brightened arcs at the interface between the molecular cloud and the ambient hii region .",
    "the bright heads ( size @xmath86 cm ) and bodies of the tadpole and its associates likely represent similar interfaces .",
    "we interpret the ripples evident in the tadpole body as resulting from kelvin - helmholtz ( k - h ) instabilities . such instabilities are expected to occur at the periphery of a dense cloud embedded in diffuse gas , when there is relative motion between the two components ( e.g. , fleck 1984 , kamaya 1998 ) .",
    "the spatial wavelength of the ripples ( @xmath87 cm ) is very similar to the wavelengths of the  ripples \" found on the surfaces of some molecular clouds in the orion nebula by bern et al .",
    "( 2010 ) that have also been interpreted as resulting from k - h instabilities .",
    "we consider ( but discard ) the possibility that the ripples could be caused by the orbital motion of two bound stars separated by a distance comparable to the ripple amplitude ( @xmath882=2800au ) , since the ripple wavelength implies a time scale of @xmath89yr(@xmath90 ) ( @xmath91 is an assumed speed for the exterior wind impacting the tadpole ) , which is much shorter than the expected orbital time for such a binary system , @xmath92yr@xmath93 ( taking the masses of the stars in the binary to be @xmath94 ) .",
    "although the bow - shock morphology of the head of the tadpole structure and the cometary shape of the central knot in i20324 are very similar to the shapes of structures seen towards proplyds in the orion star - forming region ( e.g. , odell & wong 1996 , bally et al .",
    "1998 ) , we do not think i20234 or object b are proplyds because the associated molecular masses ( greater than 3.7 and 1.3 ) are much too large compared to what one might expect for circumstellar material being evaporated from protoplanetary disks : disk masses of ( 0.0030.07 )  have been inferred from an sma continuum survey for the orion proplyds ( mann & williams 2010 ) . indeed , no dense molecular medium has yet been found around the central disks in any known proplyd .",
    "furthermore , the minimum separation between the bright periphery of the tadpole head ( which would represent the wind shock in the proplyd hypothesis ) and the cometary knot in i20324 is @xmath95au , is much larger than the corresponding typical separations for the orion proplyds ( @xmath96au : bally et al .",
    "however , this argument needs to be strengthened by a quantitative assessment of the competing effects of ( i ) the larger number of ionizing stars in cyg ob2 and , ( ii ) their larger distance from the location of i20324 and its associates compared to orion , since the physical scales of structures associated with proplyds scale inversely with the ionizing euv flux .",
    "we conclude that i20324 and its associates are eggs .",
    "eggs are likely to be the surviving dense portions of their parent molecular clouds , and as such , they should be predominantly molecular , as observed in our objects . while the original concept of eggs shows them as having elongated tails that connect them continuously with the elephant trunks in m16 , this is due to the ionizing sources in m16 being concentrated in one direction relative to the eggs .",
    "however , the presence of multiple ionizing sources distributed over a large solid angle relative to the eggs , as in cyg ob2 , results in a diffuse radiation field that eventually pinches off their tails  a possibility noted by hester et al .",
    "( 1996 ) , and supported by numerical simulations ( e.g. , ercolano & gritschneder 2011 )  creating  free - floating \" eggs , such as the tadpole and its associates .",
    "their relatively high internal density has not only prolonged their survival in the hostile radiative and windy environment of the cyg ob2 cluster , but it makes these globules a likely place for stars to have begun forming , especially as the overpressure of the surrounding hii region would have aided gravity by compressing the globules .",
    "it therefore seems to be no accident that the tadpole and the goldfish have embedded stars .",
    "wetal12 point out that a higher fraction of the globules in this region ( 70% ) appear to have stars than those in the eagle nebula ( 15% ) , and they use this fact to argue that their objects in cygnus are therefore unlikely to be eggs .",
    "however , several variables can affect this fraction .",
    "the parent cloud of the eagle nebula may have been considerably less dense and massive than the parent cloud of the globules in cygnus , and the cygnus ob2 association could provide a much stronger radiation field and more powerful winds than the cluster powering the eagle nebula .",
    "both of these factors would affect both the size distribution of the resulting eggs and the compression to which they are subjected . in summary",
    ", it is quite plausible that not only the tadpole and the goldfish , but all of the  proplyd - like \" objects listed in wetal12 are eggs , considering their rather similar physical sizes and shapes . molecular - line observations of these objects , like the ones reported in this paper , will help in determining their masses and thus confirming their true nature .",
