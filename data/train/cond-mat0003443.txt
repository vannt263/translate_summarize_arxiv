    "the ordering process associated with the first order phase transition has been investigated for a long time since the early works by van der waals appeared at the end of the last century.@xcite   it has occupied a major position together with the dynamical critical phenomena as a subject not only of the non - equilibrium statistical physics but also of the field theory .",
    "a challenging feature of it is the strong nonlinearity which causes a variety of evolving spatial patterns .",
    "this has initiated the interesting concept of ` pattern formation ' in far - from - equilibrium thermodynamic systems.@xcite-@xcite    complicated patterns , at a glance , are seen even in the most simplified theoretical models of a binary mixture , e.g. , in the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) model for the conserved order parameter ( cop ) , or the cahn - hilliard ( ch ) model.@xcite   the nonlinearity in these systems finally gives rise to a spatial singularity of the order parameter gap , i.e. , the interface with a sharp profile that separates distinctly the coexisting couple of phases .",
    "this is a primary example of the so - called ` topological defect ' appearing in continuous fields .",
    "the main subject for us in this stage is to reduce a degenerate evolution equation for the interface from the basic tdgl or ch equations for the bulk field .    in spite of remarkable success of the intuitive , droplet theories on a dilute mixture ,",
    "i.e. , some pioneering works in the middle of this century , @xcite-@xcite  the interface evolution equation for more general systems has not been obtained yet in an explicit form .",
    "the most general form we have found so far is an integral equation obtained by kawasaki and ohta.@xcite   this is a kind of the curvature flow equation which represents the interface velocity with the mean curvature _ implicitly _ in contrast to the allen - cahn equation@xcite for a system of non - conserved order parameter ( ncop ) .",
    "it has been shown@xcite that this is the equivalent simple layer equation@xcite for the dirichlet problem of the laplace equation that is derived as a quasi - static approximation for a stefan problem,@xcite  i.e. , a diffusion problem of an autonomous boundary condition evolving through the diffusion process itself . for some simplified systems , e.g. , a planar interface or a thin system of spherical droplets , it is straightforward to derive the curvature flow equations , if they are considered as electro - static potential problems .",
    "the explicit potential solutions for such systems can be found in every elementary textbook on electro - statics.@xcite   on the contrary , we will soon come up against a serious difficulty of a complicated geometry of the boundary condition when we try to find out explicit potential solutions for more general systems .",
    "for example , in a nearly symmetric mixture there appears a random bicontinuous structure , i.e. , the so - called _ sponge _ phase .",
    "this has an infinitely multiply - connected topology and is characteristic of a three dimensional system . that contrasts to the case of a lamellar phase , which is essentially equivalent to a planar system .",
    "in the previous work@xcite the author assumed an almost minimal surface for such a system mainly by intuition gained from some simulated pictures@xcite-@xcite , which just remind us a periodic minimal surface such as the schwarz lattice structure,@xcite  at least in a local view .",
    "the theoretical foundation for this assumption was that the mean curvature is included linearly in the boundary value itself as the gibbs - thomson condition already , and then it can be neglected within the limits of a linear theory with respect to the small mean curvature .",
    "this situation is similar to that of the decay process of a perturbative deformation on a planar interface .",
    "we used the common feature of zero mean curvature of the unperturbed basis in both systems .",
    "an important difference is that the sponge phase has an evident characteristic length , which was used effectively as the mean _ electro - static _ screening length in the previous work .    in the present paper",
    "it is shown that the assumption of a minimal surface on the unperturbed basis is not necessary in deriving an explicit solution from the integral equation and the same one - parameter curvature flow equation is rederived for more general bicontinuous systems .",
    "we need the bicontinuous nature of the interface only . here ` bicontinuous ' means that the interface divides the whole @xmath0 space into a couple of ( _ not _ necessarily symmetric ) subspaces connected in each like a planar interface does , and not into subspaces more than three .",
    "this is the only condition required to make up a formal expression for the equivalent simple layer in terms of the potential problem .    in  2 the integral equation for the interface velocity",
    "is rederived on the basis of onsager s variational principle .",
    "it is shown that the principle of minimum dissipation is an example of the so - called gradient dynamics and is very useful for such an actual purpose to reduce the degenerate interface equation of motion correctly from the basic transport equation for the bulk field . in ",
    "3 a formal explicit expression for the simple layer on an arbitrary connected surface is derived referring to a solvable problem of a plane boundary . the equation of the level function that corresponds to the present curvature flow equation is discussed in  4 .",
    "in the original work by kawasaki and ohta@xcite a kind of the path - integral method and a variational principle associated with it were used .",
    "it seems instructive for us to follow it in terms of the familiar onsager principle of minimum dissipation@xcite with reference to the recent gradient dynamics . to begin with ,",
    "let us survey the onsager variational principle .",
    "let @xmath1 be a set of generalized thermodynamic variables , their phenomenological transport equations being given by [ phenomeno ] _",
    "i = _ j l_ijx_j , where @xmath2 are the onsager coefficients and @xmath3 is a set of generalized thermodynamic forces , which are defined by using the _ entropy _ function @xmath4 as = _ s  or  x_i = .",
    "onsager proposed a minimum principle on the basis of the symmetric property of @xmath2 , i.e. , @xmath5 , and its positive definiteness as follows : define two kinds of dissipation function and a lagrangian by = _",
    "i , j l^-1_ij _ i_j ,    = _ i , jl_ijx_i x_j , and [ , ] & = & - [ , ] + + & = & _ i , jl^-1_ij(_i-_k l_ikx_k ) ( _ j-_ll_jlx_l ) , where [ , ] = _ i _ ix_i . then the phenomenological equation eq.([phenomeno ] ) is given by = 0  ( minimum )  with  respect  to   .",
    "this variational principle was confirmed later as a problem of the most probable path in the path integral method of the linear fluctuation theory.@xcite   it has been understood widely that the principle itself is nothing but a formal theory as is suggested in the above survey and is no use for an actual purpose to find out the transport equation itself for a given system .",
    "recently , mathematicians have introduced a notion of ` gradient dynamics ' .",
    "@xcite   in this sense , the above onsager s phenomenology is a lagrange multiplier version with a constraint of a properly chosen inner product @xmath6  constant .",
    "] of a gradient dynamics defined by an inner product , ( , ) = _ i , jl^-1_ij u_i v_j = 2 .",
    "mathematicians may define an arbitrary dynamics by using an arbitrary inner product .",
    "that gives us a good hint : that is , it can be reasonably expected that we may find out the correct interface dynamics easily , when we rewrite the inner product , i.e. , the physical dissipation function for the bulk into an interfacial form .",
    "let @xmath7 be the scalar field whose evolution is described by the tdgl equation of cop type , or equivalently the ch equation , [ tdgl ] s(,t)=-l  s(\\{s ( ) } ) . in this case",
    "@xmath8 is not the entropy but related to the free energy functional @xmath9 by @xmath10 , where @xmath11 is the temperature and @xmath12 the boltzmann constant and f(\\ { s ( ) } ) = d \\ { - s()^2 + s()^4 + ^2 [ s ( ) ] ^2 } .",
    "the equation ( [ tdgl ] ) has a uniform equilibrium solution , s()=s_0 , and a planar interface one , i.e. , the so - called kink solution , [ kink ] s_k(z ) = s_0 , where @xmath13 is a normal coordinate perpendicular to the interface . here",
    "@xmath14 corresponds to the thickness of the interface .",
    "the parameter @xmath15 is related to the susceptibility by ^-1 = |_s_0 . from eq.([kink ] ) we get an expression of the surface tension,@xcite [ tension ] = _ -^(s_k)^2dz = , as the excess free energy stored in the interface layer where @xmath16 .",
    "now let us derive the interfacial version from the bulk dissipation function defined by [ phi ] = g_0(- ) d d , where @xmath17 is the inverse of the onsager coefficient @xmath18 in eq.([tdgl ] ) defined by g_0(-)=-(- ) , which is the green function , i.e. , the newton ( or the coulomb ) potential . if we assume that the every element @xmath19 of the interface s at @xmath20 propagates without deforming its profile , it is straightforward to show that _ -^ dz = -2s_0 v_n ( ) . from a geometrical consideration , where @xmath21 is the interface normal velocity .",
    "thus , the interface version of the dissipation function eq.([phi ] ) is given by = g_0(- ) v_n()v_n()dada , where the volume elements @xmath22 and @xmath23 in eq.([phi ] ) are replaced by @xmath24 and @xmath25 .",
    "on the other hand , by definition of the surface free energy @xmath26 , the interface version of @xmath27 is written as = -h()v_n ( ) da , according to the formula on the change of the surface area caused by the normal displacement @xmath28 of the surface s , da = h ( ) z da , where @xmath29 is the mean curvature of the surface at @xmath20 .",
    "then , by using the variational principle @xmath30 with respect to @xmath21 we obtain an integral equation , [ integral ] g_0(-)v_n()da = -   [ h()- ] , which is just the equation obtained by kawasaki and ohta . here a new notation , d = is introduced for the simplicity together with the relation eq.([tension ] ) .",
    "note that a constant , @xmath31 , is incorporated as the lagrange unknown multiplier in the present variational principle , corresponding to the constraint of order parameter conservation , [ conservation ] v_n()da=0 . if the inverse @xmath32 of the integral kernel @xmath33 satisfying _ 0(,)g_0(-)da=(- ) , were given , the constant @xmath31 would be determined by a weighted average , [ hbar ] = _",
    "0(,)h()dada /_0(,)dada. apparently the integral equation eq.([integral ] ) having a kernel of the newton potential is the same as that of the equivalent simple layer for the dirichlet problem of the laplace equation .",
    "let us relate it to the diffusion equation in the followings .    because the order parameter deviation , @xmath34 , from the saturated level @xmath35 at each phase is expected to be very small in the region out of the boundary layer ( @xmath36 ) , the chemical potential can be approximated by    an ordinary diffusion process defined by [ diff ] = d ,  ( d = l / kt_0 ) where a normalized variable , @xmath37 , is introduced . by using a kind of the boundary layer method we find a boundary condition , [ gt ] 2s_0 ( 0 ) = h ( ) ,",
    "that is , the well - known gibbs - thomson condition for the curved interface having the mean curvature @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the normal unit vector of the interface .",
    "then , the boundary value for @xmath40 must be given by [ bc ] _",
    "( ) = h ( ) .",
    "it should be noted that the boundary s deforms itself via this diffusion with a normal velocity , [ velocity ] v_n()= _ , where @xmath41_{\\mib{a}}$ ] denotes a gap of the enclosed quantity through the boundary layer at @xmath20 .",
    "these equations make a stefan problem with a time - dependent , autonomous boundary condition .    in the late stage of the phase separation process where the characteristic length , @xmath42 , of the spatial pattern is sufficiently greater than the interface thickness @xmath14 , the propagating velocity @xmath43 and the diffusion velocity @xmath44 satisfy the condition ~ 1 .",
    "therefore , a quasi - static approximation , = 0 , is applicable in this stage .",
    "thus , the above stefan problem becomes a dirichlet problem of the laplace equation .",
    "the propagating velocity eq.([velocity ] ) together with the boundary condition eq.([bc ] ) is now given by the gap of the ` electric field ' across the boundary , i.e. , the equivalent ` simple charge layer ' , which should satisfy the integral equation eq.([integral ] ) .",
    "the additional parameter @xmath31 should be regarded as a compatibility condition in this framework as follows : when @xmath45 is the solution for the boundary condition @xmath46 , @xmath47 is the solution for another boundary condition @xmath48 with an arbitrary additional constant @xmath49 .",
    "obviously the family of the boundary conditions @xmath48 have the same value of the field gap @xmath50_{\\mib{a}}$ ] or the simple layer solution .",
    "if the equivalent simple layer solution for this family exists , it determines a unique boundary value given by the left hand side of the integral equation .",
    "then the right hand side should have an adjustable constant for the compatibility when an arbitrary boundary condition @xmath46 is given .",
    "note that this is true only if no flux lines escape out of the system into infinite points as is mentioned below .",
    "that corresponds to the conservation condition eq.([conservation ] ) , because of the gauss theorem , i.e. , the total escaping flux being given by the total _ charge _",
    ", v_n ( ) da , included in the system .",
    "thus the constant @xmath31 must be determined by the conservation condition again .",
    "an exceptional example not covered by this rule is a problem of an isolated system composed of finite closed surface(s ) , where the flux may escape out .",
    "of course we know that this is an ordinary case in the usual electro - static problem .",
    "for the simplicity suppose a finite sphere of radius @xmath51 and a constant boundary value @xmath52 on it .",
    "the simple layer in this case is given by @xmath50=\\psi_{\\rs}/r$ ] , because @xmath53 for @xmath54 and @xmath55 for @xmath56 .",
    "evidently , another boundary condition , @xmath57 , has a different value of the simple layer , @xmath58 .",
    "thus , for the problem of isolated closed surface(s ) , the compatibility constant is not necessary .",
    "in contrast to it , for the extraordinary case of infinitely extended systems such as a system of spheres scattered homogeneously in the whole @xmath0 space or a bicontinuous system spreading over the whole @xmath0 space , etc . , we need the compatibility condition . in these systems",
    "the constant boundary values induce a unique constant potential in _ both _ sides of the interface(s ) .",
    "first let us consider a dirichlet problem of the laplace equation , = 0 , when the values @xmath59 on the @xmath60-plane , s , are given .",
    "let @xmath61 be the surface charge density on the grounded conductor s induced by a probe charge @xmath62 located at a referred point @xmath63 .",
    "then the potential @xmath40 at the referred point @xmath63 is expressed in an explicit form as [ ind ] ( 0,0,z)=(x,y;z)_(x,y)dxdy , by using the elementary method of the green function .",
    "the induced charge density @xmath64 on the plane boundary can be found in every textbook on electro - statics as the simplest example of the mirror image method . by using the actual expression for it together with the taylor expansion , _",
    "( x,y)= ( )_(0,0 ) , where @xmath65 and @xmath66 , eq.([ind ] ) is rewritten as [ besselint ] ( 0,0,z ) & = & ( )_(0,0 ) dxdy + & = & _ 0^da  j_0(a|i| )   _ ( 0,0 ) + & = & ( -z|i| )  _ ( 0,0 ) , where @xmath67 is the usual bessel function of @xmath68-th order . then , by differentiating it with respect to @xmath13 , we find |_z=+0 = -|i| _ ( ) .",
    "note that this result itself means merely a transform of the boundary condition from a dirichlet type into a neumann type . combining with the same , symmetric result for the opposite side , @xmath69",
    ", we obtain the formula for the equivalent simple layer , [ eqsigma ] _ eq()=- _",
    "= 2|i|  [ _ ( ) - ] , by means of which we can write the potential in another explicit form , ( ) = g_0(-)_eq()da. the compatibility constant mentioned in the last part in  2 is incorporated here , although it would disappear after the differentiation in the present case .",
    "it should be noted that , from the view - point of the green function method this term is required , in principle , for the condition @xmath70 when @xmath71 on applying the green theorem .    the fictitious operator @xmath72 was introduced by ohta and nozaki@xcite in a perturbational theory for a planar interface .",
    "they defined it by a gaussian integral .",
    "however , in the context of the present derivation it should be interpreted as the following limit , |i| = _",
    "v(-^2 ) , where @xmath73 is the surface laplacian and the function @xmath74 is defined by [ v ] v(q^2 ) & = & -_n=0^(-q^2)^n + & = & j_0(q)-qj_1(q)+q_0^qj_0(q)dq .",
    "the asymptotic behavior for large @xmath75 is evaluated as [ asympto ] v(q^2)~|q| , which results in the well - known @xmath76 dispersion relation@xcite-@xcite for the relaxation mode on a planar interface obeying the decay law @xmath77 .",
    "the formula eq.([v ] ) was derived in the previous paper by introducing a cut - off length or the upper limit @xmath42 for the integration in eq.([besselint ] ) .",
    "this time the cut - off is temporarily required to integrate the series expansion for the bessel function @xmath78 , or for @xmath79 , term by term .",
    "it will be regarded as a physical screening length and has an essential role in the final formula for bicontinuous systems in the followings .",
    "the above formulation is applicable to the two dimensional system also , where the function @xmath74 should be replaced by v(q^2)&= & -_n=0^(-q^2)^n + & = &  ,  ( d=2 ) .",
    "the asymptotic behavior is the same as eq.([asympto ] ) . here",
    "it should be noted that the operator @xmath80 in this case is neither @xmath81 nor @xmath82 if operated on @xmath83 .",
    "now let us discuss the general case of a parametric , curved surface s. let @xmath84 be a curvilinear orthogonal coordinate system , where the surface s is defined by @xmath85 .",
    "the laplacian in this system is given by [ laplace ] = _",
    "i=1 ^ 3 , where g_i=|| = 1/|u_i| , is the linear metric ( @xmath86-th element of the diagonalized metric tensor ) and @xmath87 is the jacobian defined by @xmath88 .",
    "we need the infinitesimal vicinity of s only in the followings .",
    "then it is always possible without loosing the generality to assume @xmath89 everywhere by introducing a family of parallels@xcite of s for the simplicity .",
    "in addition , let @xmath90 be the orthogonal coordinate associated with the directions of principal curvature on s. suppose that a probe charge @xmath62 is located at a referred point @xmath63 in this curvilinear coordinate and the surface s is grounded .",
    "the green function @xmath91 of the laplace equation for this boundary condition obeys the poisson equation , [ poisson ] _",
    "i=1 ^ 3_i  g = ( u_1)(u_2)(u_3-z ) , with the constraint , g(u_1,u_2,0;z ) = 0 .",
    "here new parameters @xmath92 and @xmath93 are introduced for convenience .",
    "note that the denominator @xmath87 in eq.([laplace ] ) canceled out with the jacobian , which had appeared in the right hand side of eq.([poisson ] ) .",
    "this can be regarded as an electro - static problem with a planar boundary condition in a _",
    "euclidean  _ space @xmath94 having an anisotropic , heterogeneous dielectric tensor , _ if _ the whole parametric space @xmath94 corresponds to the original physical space , and vice versa . for the time",
    "being let us assume it on condition that we need only the limit @xmath95 , and let it be discussed later .",
    "therefore , the elementary mirror image method is applicable to this case , taking account of the refraction of the flux lines , = ( -_1 , -_2 , -_3 ) . for the present purpose to find @xmath96 on s",
    "we need only the flux lines that run along the infinitesimal vicinity of s in order to calculate the induced charge @xmath64 , because the fields produced by the probe charge at @xmath13 and by its image at @xmath97 can be calculated separately .",
    "the method of a reference frame used in the previous paper to calculate the refracted flux assuming a minimal surface can be extended to more general surfaces as follows : if we take a normalization , @xmath98 , for the simplicity , the flux that arrives in the area element @xmath99 on the _ plane _ s is related to the solid angle @xmath100 when the flux started from the source point @xmath63 , that is , @xmath101 .",
    "let @xmath102 be the area element that @xmath100 would cut from the _ plane _ s when it were extended straight without refraction .",
    "then the solid angle @xmath100 is given by d = d_1d_2 .",
    "thus , the required surface charge induced in the area element @xmath19 on the original curved surface s is finally given by ( u_1,u_2;z ) da=-|_u_3=0 da = d_1d_2 , where the relation @xmath103 is used and a factor 2 caused by the image charge is introduced .",
    "note that the actual expression for the refraction law of the flux , or that for the mapping @xmath104 are not necessary in the above calculations .    this is the method of the pseudo - conformal transformation introduced in the previous paper .",
    "thus the assumption of a minimal surface used there has none of special meaning for us no longer .",
    "the remaining procedure is almost the same as that for the planar boundary except for the following three facts : first , it should be noted that the operator we will face in the expected formula related to eq.([besselint ] ) after the taylor expansion must be [ laptilde ] + .",
    "however , in the limit @xmath95 , this can be replaced by the desired surface laplacian defined by = ( + ) , as is shown in appendix a. note that this fact does not mean a conformal mapping as is mentioned there .",
    "second , there still remains the question whether the whole physical space is covered by a parametric space @xmath94 or not .",
    "apparently the answer is no in general except for simple curved surfaces having the same topology as that of a plane . in a complicated sponge structure the region described by a given set of parameters @xmath94",
    "must be limited in the local _ cave _ around the referred point . in order to avoid this difficulty ,",
    "let us introduce an upper - limit @xmath42 for the integration in eq.([besselint ] ) .",
    "this cut - off length was defined intuitively as an _ electro - static _ screening length , i.e. , the effective diameter of local caves of the sponge - shaped _",
    "conductor _ in the previous paper .",
    "in fact we have such a unique ( but time - dependent ) , well - defined characteristic length in the bicontinuous phase that grows up starting from a quenched , homogeneous mixtures .",
    "it shou1d be noted that we have another difficulty that at least one of the parameters @xmath105 may become multi - valued , for example , on a part of the surface having a rotational symmetry like a catenoid .",
    "it seems that we have no problem in applying the image method to this case _ if _ we do not introduce any cut - off , as is exemplified using a two - dimensional solvable problem of a circle boundary in appendix b. the cut - off procedure , however , causes literally cut - off of the multi - valued part in this case . fortunately , in addition to the fact that we need only the very vicinity of s , the weight of the contribution of the boundary values at the points away from the referred point decreases as @xmath106 , where @xmath107 is essentially the distance along s as is suggested by the equality between the operator eq.([laptilde ] ) and @xmath108 .",
    "thus , the cut - off procedure may be introduced without ruining the approximation .",
    "the last point is the bicontinuous nature of the interface s. this is related to the equivalence of the boundary condition between the inner and the outer problems of s. for example , let us consider a non - bicontinuous system composed of several closed surfaces , @xmath109  .",
    "evidently , each inner problem associated with each @xmath110 has a single boundary @xmath110 itself .",
    "on the other hand the sole outer problem has a united boundary @xmath111  .",
    "thus the boundary conditions are not equivalent to each other .",
    "in contrast to it , we have just two regions separated by a single sheet of the interface s in the bicontinuous phase that is extended infinitely or is connected periodically in all three directions , and the difference between the ` inner ' and ` outer ' problems has no sense there .",
    "both problems have exactly the same boundary in this case . then the induced charge densities for both problems must coincide with each other when @xmath112 as is seen in the above derivation , even if the both bulk regions are asymmetric at an average .",
    "therefore , the values of the potential gradient @xmath113 constructed with the common boundary values @xmath46 on s become equivalent one another .",
    "thanks to these facts we can construct the equivalent simple layer by using eq.([eqsigma ] ) . thus the explicit expression for the curvature flow equation , [ cfe ] v_n()=-v(-(t)^2 )  [ h()- ] , is obtained again for general bicontinuous phases .",
    "the parameter @xmath114 is the time - dependent characteristic length , which is to be determined self - consistently by this equation . on the assumption of scaling ,",
    "i.e. , the time - dependent similarity law , the well - known time - dependence @xmath115 may be found by using a kind of dimension analysis on this equation .",
    "note that the compatibility constant @xmath31 in the right hand side is given by the simple surface average in this approximation , i.e. , = h()da/ da .    for small @xmath116 ,",
    "the function @xmath74 is expanded as@xcite v(q^2)\\ {    ll 1++ ... & ( d=3 ) , +   + ( 1++ ... ) & ( d=2 ) .    .",
    "= 2.5 in    the first term expresses the mean - field evaporation - condensation process @xmath117 , due to the imbalance of the mean curvature around its average value @xmath31 .",
    "the second term may be interpreted as a kind of surface diffusion @xmath118 due to the local nonuniformity of the curvature .",
    "on the contrary the asymptotic value of @xmath74 for @xmath119 is given by eq.([asympto ] ) , i.e. , @xmath120 , which corresponds to the @xmath76 relaxation mode @xmath121 .",
    "then the short wave - length local fluctuations ( @xmath122 ) on the interface must decay rapidly and we can expect that the interface is always smooth within a spatial scope of @xmath114 almost everywhere .    the above behaviors of @xmath74 are shown in fig.1 .",
    "the asymptotic estimation ( @xmath123 ) is practically applicable for @xmath124 .",
    "however , the important modes for the interface evolution are included in the small wave - number region , @xmath125 , where @xmath74 deviates significantly from its asymptote .",
    "the onsager principle of minimum dissipation seems to be really useful in such a practical problem to reduce the interface evolution equation from the bulk equation , at least if the effect of thermal fluctuations can be neglected . in the unstable phase separation process",
    "the main role of thermal fluctuations is creating nuclei or microscopic droplets at the very early stage .",
    "this effect may be incorporated as the initial condition in the picture of the interface dynamics .",
    "another example is the ncop system .",
    "the inverse of the onsager coefficients in this case is merely @xmath126",
    ". then the dissipation function is given by = ( ) ^2 d = v_n()^2 da , where the definition of the surface tension eq.([tension ] ) is used . on the other hand , @xmath27 becomes = -\\{h()-2s_0 h}v_n()da , where @xmath127 is the uniform external field that should be included in the free energy in the following form , @xmath128 for a ncop system . then using the variational method we find v_n()=- .",
    "that is the well - known allen - cahn equation.@xcite   in addition , putting @xmath129 for the droplet system , we obtain a radius evolution equation , = ( - ) , where @xmath130 is the radius of the critical droplet .",
    "thus we can get these important formulae straightforwardly and correctly by using the onsager principle .",
    "the one - parameter curvature flow equation for general cop systems is rederived without assuming a minimal surface .",
    "the bicontinuous nature is shown to be indispensable in the present derivation .",
    "of course the result is applicable to a planar interface if we adopt an infinite cut - off length , @xmath131 . especially it should be noted that it gives an exact explicit solution of the dirichlet problem for an arbitrary curved surface having the same topology as that of a plane .",
    "such formulae have not been found in the textbook on the electro - statics or on the potential problem .    on the contrary , this result can not be applied to a system of scattered spheres because it has not the bicontinuous nature , although it has been one of the simplest examples to study .",
    "of course a more accurate argument on this system@xcite is possible by applying the standard electro - statics directly to eq.([integral ] ) as was performed by kawasaki and ohta.@xcite   suppose each sphere of radius @xmath132 and charged by @xmath133 is sufficiently separated from each other . then eq.([integral ] ) for the potential on the surface of the sphere",
    "@xmath86 becomes + _ ji = , where @xmath134 is the distance between a couple of spheres @xmath86 and @xmath135 and is assumed as @xmath136 .",
    "then the surface charge density given by @xmath137 satisfies _",
    "i+_ji_j = .",
    "the second term in the left - hand side shows plainly the long - range interaction of the interface through the diffusion process . when this term is neglected for a sufficiently thin system , this becomes the lifshitz - slyozov equation,@xcite  where the critical radius @xmath138 in the right - hand side is to be determined by r_c(t)=r=_i r_i/_i 1 , according to the conservation condition @xmath139 in this system .",
    "lastly let us discuss the equation of the level function associated with the present curvature flow equation .",
    "this method was used first by ohta _",
    "et al_@xcite in a special problem of the ordering process in a ncop system with @xmath140 and has been developed by mathematicians@xcite independently : let @xmath141 be the fictitious scalar field , the interface being defined by @xmath142 .",
    "then the interface normal velocity is represented as @xmath143 .",
    "suppose we have an explicit curvature flow equation , v_n()=f(\\{h( ) } ) , where @xmath144 may be a functional . here",
    "the mean curvature is given by h = - = -_u=0 , where @xmath145 .",
    "if we extend these equations to the bulk ( @xmath146 ) , that makes a closure of @xmath141 .",
    "thus the level function equation for our case is written as [ u ] =  |u|  v(-(t)^2 ) . for a small value of @xmath147",
    "we have a formula,@xcite [ hu ] h(u)-h(0 ) u  _ u=0 , where @xmath148 is the gauss curvature defined by @xmath149 using the radii of the principal curvature , @xmath150 and @xmath151 .",
    "then @xmath31 in the right hand side of eq.([u ] ) may be replaced by = + u  _ u=0 . the second term in the right hand side of eq.([hu ] ) canceled out after the surface integration .",
    "note that the quantity @xmath152 is positive definite . especially for a homogeneous bicontinuous phase of a symmetric mixture ,",
    "this can be estimated as h^2 - 2k -2k 2(t)^2 , or alternatively we may use it as a definition of the parameter @xmath114 .",
    "thus the level function equation for a cop system has very tough form and has several difficulties@xcite to be solved .",
    "none of satisfactory analyses on it has been found so far.@xcite",
    "the author would like to thank the members of the statistical physics group of nara women s university , who invited him to have a lecture on the phase ordering process in the autumn of 1999 and stimulated him into the present work in preparing a lecture note .",
    "let @xmath153 be an arbitrary continuous function on s and suppose a harmonic function satisfying the laplace equation [ a1 ] ( + _ 3 ) ( u_1,u_2,u_3)=0 , with the boundary condition [ a2 ] ( u_1,u_2,0)=f(u_1,u_2 ) .",
    "let us generalize the reference frame on s defined in  3 to the bulk , i.e. , to the region @xmath154 in the same manner .",
    "then by using the green function method a formal solution for the harmonic function @xmath40 is given by [ a3 ] ( u_1,u_2,u_3)=-|_u_3=0 f()d , where [ a4 ] ( _ 1,_2,u_3;_1,_2,u_3)=^+-^- , and [ a5 ] ^= , which satisfy a poisson equation [ a6 ] ( + + ) ^= -(_1-_1)(_2-_2)(u_3u_3 ) .",
    "note that the reference frame is defined on taking the origin at the point just under the probe charge in  3 .",
    "however , once the new _ euclidean _",
    "coordinate system is defined , one may shift the origin to any point .",
    "thus , the reference coordinate @xmath155 is also used for the point of the probe charge in the above equations .    now combining eqs.([a1]),([a3 ] ) and ( [ a6 ] ) it is straightforward to find [ a7 ] ( + ) f = f , in the limit , @xmath156 . here the following relation for small @xmath157 , [ a8 ] _",
    "3 = h+ , is used .",
    "of course this approximation is exact for a minimal surface ( @xmath158 ) . in general",
    "one may use the fact that @xmath159 , which has an almost @xmath160-function shape , satisfies ~ ,   ~ , and so on , when @xmath157 is sufficiently small .    using the same argument repeatedly on the functions @xmath161",
    "... , we obtain ( + ) ^nf=^2nf , for an arbitrary integer @xmath68 .",
    "this is the result desired in  3 .",
    "it should be noted that this does not mean a conformal transformation on s , because the definition of the reference coordinate itself depends on the probed point .",
    "further the reference coordinate @xmath162 itself is not an orthogonal system on s in general .",
    "then , strictly speaking , the operator @xmath163 is not an invariant laplacian but merely a taylor expansion operator around the referred point .",
    "it is instructive to discuss a solvable problem in the present scheme , though it is stupid practically .",
    "let us consider a circle of radius @xmath51 and assume a probe charge is located at a distance @xmath13 from it . a new curvilinear coordinate @xmath105",
    "may be defined by [ b1 ] u_1=(r+z ) ,  u_2=r - r , where @xmath165 is the usual polar coordinate . the two dimensional laplacian is written in this coordinate as [ b2 ] = ( + g_1 ) , where [ b3 ] g_1=|u_1|^-1=  ,  g_2=|u_2|^-1 = 1 .",
    "let us derive the refraction law of the flux @xmath166 in the _ euclidean _ space @xmath105 due to the anisotropic dielectric tensor @xmath167 , which depends on @xmath168 only .",
    "let @xmath169 be the angle between the flux line and the @xmath170-axis .",
    "then we find that [ b4 ] _ 1= constant , because of the continuity relations across a boundary line parallel to the @xmath170-axis , [ b5 ] d = d  ,   = , for the perpendicular and the parallel components , respectively . by using eq.([b4 ] ) the flux equation",
    "is given by [ b6 ] = - = -_0 , or [ b7 ] ( r+u_2)=(r+z)-u_1 , where @xmath171 is the initial angle , which defines the reference coordinate by [ b8 ] _ 1 = z/_0 .",
    "on putting @xmath172 in eq.([b7 ] ) we find the mapping , @xmath173 , i.e. , [ b9 ] _ 1=u_1=. of course this is a multi - valued mapping , @xmath174 .",
    "then the induced charge density is given by [ b10 ] d = d_1 = _ n=-^ d , where a new parameter @xmath175 is used . by using some formulae this yields [ b11 ] d&= & d + & = & d .",
    "that is the well - known result obtained directly with use of a mirror image method .",
    "thus the multi - valued mapping has no problem in the present reference frame method .",
    "however , the cut - off procedure causes literally the cut - off of the tail part of the induced charge density .",
    "here it is wrong to conclude that this effect would become infinitesimal in the limit @xmath95 because the cut - off charge is of order of @xmath176 .",
    "note that the final formula for the equivalent simple layer is obtained after differentiating with respect to @xmath13 .",
    "the weight for the contribution from the remote points becomes @xmath177 , lacking the factor @xmath13 .",
    "that estimates @xmath178 for the cut - off effect .",
    "thus the cut - off loss must be recovered by some trick , such as the mean field term @xmath179 in eq.([cfe ] ) .",
