    "measurements of nonequilibrium noise provide valuable information about the properties of a system , which can not be extracted from measurements of average quantities .",
    "for example , measurements of shot noise give the magnitude of the quasiparticle charge in the case of a tunnel contact and the effective temperature of electrons in the case of a diffusive contact.@xcite recently , reulet et al.@xcite performed first measurements of the third cumulant of current , which may give even more interesting information .",
    "for example , this cumulant is very sensitive to the presence of electron - electron scattering in a diffusive contact .",
    "electron - electron scattering changes the shot noise in a diffusive contact only by several percent,@xcite but it changes the third cumulant of current almost by an order of magnitude.@xcite    of special interest is the frequency dependence of the third cumulant .",
    "very recently , it was shown that third cumulants of current in a chaotic cavity whose contacts have different transparencies may exhibit a frequency dispersion much more complicated than that of the shot noise . unlike the conventional shot noise that has a dispersion only at the inverse _",
    "@xmath0 time _ of the cavity,@xcite the third cumulant of noise may also exhibit a dispersion at the inverse _ dwell time _ of an electron on the cavity.@xcite in most cases , this time is much longer than the @xmath0 time that describes charge relaxation in the cavity , and therefore the corresponding dispersion takes place at experimentally accessible frequencies .",
    "this dispersion is due to slow fluctuations of the distribution function that do not violate electroneutrality and are akin to fluctuations of local temperature .",
    "these fluctuations do not directly contribute to the current and therefore are not seen in conventional noise , but they modulate the intensity of noise sources and therefore manifest themselves in higher correlations of current .",
    "= 8.5 cm    another important example of a system with a long dwell time is a diffusive contact . in this work",
    "we investigate the frequency dependence of the third cumulant of a metallic diffusive wire . like a chaotic cavity",
    ", it also has a long dwell time .",
    "in addition , the metallic diffusive wire is of interest because its impedance can be easily matched to that required by current experimental detection schemes.@xcite furthermore , the measuring frequencies in this case are in the range where the frequency dispersion takes place for the system at hand .",
    "the zero - frequency third cumulant of current for a diffusive wire was first calculated by lee , levitov , and yakovets@xcite for non - interacting electrons in the zero - temperature limit .",
    "recently this calculation has been extended to finite temperatures and to the case of strong electron - electron scattering by gutman and gefen.@xcite in this paper we calculate the frequency dependence of this quantity both for the case of non - interacting electrons and for the hot - electron regime and show that the latter case is more convenient for the experimental observation of this effect , since the dispersion of the third cumulant is much stronger .",
    "we present a calculation based on the cascaded boltzmann ",
    "langevin approach.@xcite in the appendix , we also derive the full generating functional for the frequency dependent current fluctuations of a metallic wire both for the elastic and hot - electron regime based on the stochastic path - integral approach to full counting statistics.@xcite the third cumulant of current may be expressed in terms of functional derivatives of this functional .",

    "all dimensions are assumed to be much larger than the elastic mean free path and the screening length in the metal .",
    "the electrodes are assumed to be perfect conductors , so the third cumulant of current is not affected by the external circuit.@xcite we also restrict ourselves to sufficiently high voltages or temperatures , hence the quantum dispersion of this quantity does not show up in the frequency range of interest.@xcite we emphasize that despite the particular choice of geometry , our results are valid for any quasi - one - dimensional diffusive contact .    with the above assumptions , the noise of current may be described using the semiclassical boltzmann ",
    "langevin approach.@xcite the frequency dependence of shot noise in diffusive contacts with account taken of electrical screening was calculated in refs . .",

    "this averaging involves both negative and positive values , and this is why the elastic third cumulant is suppressed at low frequencies as compared to the hot - electron value .",
    "however at high frequencies , the inverse diffusion operator becomes almost local in space , therefore there is no averaging of negative and positive values and both cumulants become of nearly the same magnitude .",
    "this absence of spatial averaging partially compensates for the increasing frequency and makes the frequency dependence of the `` elastic '' cumulant more flat .",

    "<S> this dispersion is much more pronounced in the case of strong electron - electron scattering than in the case of purely elastic scattering because of a different symmetry of the relevant second - order correlation functions .    </S>"
