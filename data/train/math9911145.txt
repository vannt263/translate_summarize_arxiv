    "in @xcite , pedersen and takesaki proved a technical result which was relevant for their generalization of the sakai s radon - nikodym theorem for von neumann algebras @xcite .",
    "more precisely , they determined the uniqueness and existence of positive solutions of the equation @xmath121 for @xmath122 positive bounded operators in a hilbert space .",

    "if @xmath133 then @xmath134 is equivalent to @xmath135 so , after a few manipulations , [ laala ] a = u a u. by pedersen and takesaki s result , there is a unique @xmath136 which satisfies equation ( [ laala ] ) for fixed @xmath102 , @xmath129 , namely [ pt ] = a ( a u a ua ) a. thus , @xmath137 is given by [ alfa ] ( | _ ) ( u ) = a ( a u a ua ) au which obviously is a continuous map    let @xmath102 and consider the involution @xmath104 defined in equation ( [ # # ] ) .",

    "let us denote this space by @xmath139 in @xcite , pasternak - winiarski studied the behavior of the orthogonal projection onto a closed subspace of a hilbert space when the inner product varies continuously .",
    "note that we can identify naturally the space of idempotents @xmath140 with the reflections of @xmath141 via the affine map @xmath142 , which also maps the space of orthogonal projections onto @xmath143 .",
    "based on @xcite , a geometrical study of the space @xmath141 is made in @xcite , where the characterization @xmath144 is given ( proposition 5.1 of @xcite ) . in the following proposition",
    "we shall give a new proof of this fact by showing that the homeomorphism @xmath145 maps @xmath146 onto @xmath147 .",
    "therefore the formula given in equation ( [ alfa ] ) for the inverse of @xmath148 extends the formula given in proposition 5.1 of @xcite for @xmath149 , since they must coincide on @xmath143 .",
    "let @xmath93 .",
    "then @xmath150 therefore @xmath151 is a homeomorphism .    by the previous remarks , we just need to show that @xmath152 . observe that if @xmath138 then @xmath153 : in fact , if @xmath154 then @xmath155 ; but , since the unitary part of @xmath156 corresponding to both right and left polar decompositions coincide , we get @xmath157",
    ". then @xmath158 and @xmath159 .",
    "thus , @xmath160 .",

    "of course , there is another `` complementary map '' , namely @xmath171 corresponding to the decomposition @xmath82 .",
    "we shall see that for every @xmath92 , the restriction @xmath172 is a homeomorphism . indeed , given @xmath173 , consider the polar decomposition @xmath174 , with @xmath136 and @xmath129 .",
    "then @xmath175 , so @xmath176 and @xmath177 , since @xmath178 and the spectrum @xmath179 .",
    "note that @xmath180 which is clearly a continuous map .",
    "an interesting rewriting of the above statement is :    if @xmath4 is a unital  and @xmath181 , then there exists a unique @xmath129 such that @xmath182    indeed , if @xmath183 and @xmath184 , then @xmath185 means exactly that @xmath186    it is worth mentioning that @xmath187 is the unique positive solution of pedersen - takesaki equation @xmath188 if and only if @xmath189 .",
    "changing @xmath190 by @xmath191 respectively , we can write lemma [ pt1 ] as follows :    if @xmath4 is a unital  and @xmath192 , then there exists a unique @xmath193 such that @xmath194    the map @xmath195 given by @xmath196 is not surjective : in fact , the image of @xmath197 consist of those unitary elements which can be factorized as product of three positive elements .",
    "on one side @xmath198 is the product of three elements of @xmath111 . on the other side , if @xmath199 then by pedersen - takesaki s result @xmath200 is the unique positive solution of @xmath201 .",
    "it is easy to show that @xmath202 can not be decomposed as a product of four positive elements .",
    "see @xcite and @xcite for a complete bibliography on these factorization problems .",
    "see @xcite for more results on factorization of elements of @xmath3 and characterizations of @xmath203 , at least in the finite dimensional case .    given @xmath204 , denote by @xmath205 .",
    "then the set of all solutions of the equation @xmath206 is @xmath207 in fact , @xmath208 if and only if @xmath209 and the set of all solutions of @xmath210 for @xmath211 is @xmath212 the singular case , which is much more interesting , deserves a particular study that we intend to do in several forthcoming papers .",
    "for any selfadjoint @xmath213 we shall consider the relative commutant sub @xmath214 and denote by @xmath215 , the unitary group of @xmath216 and , analogously @xmath217 , @xmath218 , @xmath219 and @xmath220 .",
    "the space @xmath6 has a deep relationship with @xmath141 ( in @xcite there is a partial description of it ) .",
    "here we only need to notice that the unitary part of any @xmath221 also belongs to @xmath143 . indeed , if @xmath222 is the polar decomposition of @xmath223 , then @xmath224 .",
