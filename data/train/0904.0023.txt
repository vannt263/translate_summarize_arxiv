    "the helium - hydride ion heh@xmath1 is the simplest heteronuclear two - electron system and the only well bound molecular system of hydrogen and helium , the most abundant elements in the universe .",
    "this motivated many calculations and experiments performed on this molecular ion which is of interest for the chemistry of astrophysical objects , for the tritium neutrino mass experiments , or simply by itself as a model system ( see , e.g. , @xcite and references therein ) .",
    "more recently , heh@xmath1 is drawing special attention due to an experiment performed at the free - electron laser flash @xcite where the absolute photodissociation cross section at a photon energy of 38.7 ev was measured .",
    "the photoabsorption spectrum of heh@xmath1 was previously investigated theoretically , together with photoionization , only for the parallel orientation of the molecular axis with respect to the field @xcite . a more recent study on the photoionization of heh@xmath1 @xcite treated also the perpendicular orientation ,",
    "but for the photodissociation into electronic bound states , to the authors knowledge , the only work considering both the parallel and the perpendicular orientation is still the one of basu and barua from 1984 @xcite . there , however , the @xmath2 contribution taken into account is only the one of the lowest state , while the flash experiment shows an important contribution of higher lying @xmath2 states @xcite .    motivated by the flash experiment ,",
    "the photodissociation cross section of heh@xmath1 has been calculated for parallel , perpendicular , as well as isotropic orientations of the molecular axis with respect to the field , for transitions starting from the lowest lying vibrational state and the first or second rotational level , as well as for a mixture of initial vibrational states .",
    "since the experiment measures only the dissociation into he + h@xmath1 , a comparison to the experimental data required resolving different dissociation channels . the influence of non - adiabatic effects on the channel - resolved results is discussed .",
    "the paper is organized as follows : section [ method ] presents the method and the computational details , section [ results ] discusses the results and a summary is given in section [ summ ] .",
    "in atomic units ( @xmath3ev and @xmath4 m ) and the non - relativistic dipole approximation the photodissociation cross section is given according to fermi s golden rule by@xmath5 )   % \\ ] ] where @xmath6 is the photon energy and @xmath7 is the dipole operator in length gauge .",
    "for a diatomic molecule , it is sufficient to calculate the single - photon absorption cross section for a parallel and a perpendicular orientation of the molecular axis with respect to the electric field component .",
    "the partial parallel ( perpendicular ) cross section for an isotropic molecular ensemble is then obtained by a multiplication of the cross section for a molecule oriented parallel ( perpendicular ) to the field with the statistical factor @xmath8 ( @xmath9 ) .",
    "the total cross section for an isotropic molecular ensemble is simply the sum of these two partial cross sections ( see also @xcite for more details on @xmath10 ) .    in equation ( [ eq : cross ] ) ,",
    "@xmath11 and @xmath12 are the rovibronic wavefunctions of the initial and final state , with energies @xmath13 and @xmath14 respectively . within the born - oppenheimer ( bo ) approximation the former",
    "is given as@xmath15 where @xmath16 is the electronic , @xmath17 the vibrational , and the spherical harmonic @xmath18 the rotational wavefunction .",
    "the index @xmath19 specifies the electronic state ( bo potential curve ) including its symmetry ( the only relevant ones in this work are @xmath20 and @xmath21 ) , while @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the vibrational and rotational quantum numbers , respectively .",
    "the final - state wavefunction can be written in an analogous way , but in the here studied case of photodissociation @xmath24 is a continuous index , while @xmath19 , @xmath25 , @xmath22 , @xmath26 , and @xmath27 are discrete ones .",
    "correspondingly , @xmath28 , @xmath29 , @xmath30 , and , of course , @xmath18 as well as @xmath31 are normalized to unity , while @xmath32 is energy normalized , @xmath33 .",
    "the transition amplitudes in equation([eq : cross ] ) are obtained by a calculation of the integral@xmath34 where @xmath35 denotes the electronic transition dipole moment as a function of the internuclear distance .",
    "it is defined by @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the electronic dipole operator in length gauge , @xmath38 with @xmath39 being the polarization vector .",
    "( the contribution of the nuclear dipole operator vanishes , since in the present work only electronic transitions with @xmath40 are considered . )",
    "the electronic wavefunctions and transition dipole moments are calculated using the method described in @xcite which is thus only briefly sketched in the following .",
    "first , the one - electron schrdinger equation ( oese ) is solved in an elliptical `` box '' within the fixed - nuclei approximation , using a _",
    "b_-spline basis set and the prolate - spheroidal coordinates ( @xmath41 ) .",
    "the box boundary is defined by @xmath42 .",
    "the two - electron schrdinger equation is solved using the configuration - interaction ( ci ) method in which the configurations are expanded in terms of the one - electron orbitals obtained from the solution of the oese .",
    "this yields the bo potential curves and the two - electron wavefunctions @xmath43 .",
    "the latter are used to evaluate the electronic transition dipole moments @xmath44 .",
    "all the results shown in this work were calculated in the length gauge , but agreement with velocity gauge was also investigated .",
    "the nuclear motion is solved in the adiabatic bo potential curves by expanding the nuclear wavefunctions in _ b _ splines for the radial part times spherical harmonics describing the angular part .",
    "the radial schrdinger equation is solved in a spherical `` box '' whose boundary is defined by r@xmath45 .",
    "the box leads to a discretization of the vibrational continua .",
    "the resulting vibrational wavefunctions @xmath46 are therefore all discrete and normalized to unity . for the dissociative continuum",
    "the renormalization factors that lead to an energy normalization can simply be obtained from the density of states .",
    "the present calculations were directly motivated by the recent fel experiment @xcite .",
    "therefore , the basis sets were chosen for the purpose of computing photodissociation cross sections that take into account the contribution of as many rydberg states as possible ( the experimental results indicate the importance of highly excited states ) . in the present calculation 35",
    "@xmath47 and 25 @xmath2 electronic bound states were finally included .",
    "a physical box ( @xmath48 ) equal to @xmath49 was used , changing the size of the elliptical box @xmath42 synchronously with the variation of the internuclear distance @xmath50 , 40 _",
    "b _ splines of order 8 were used for the @xmath51 direction and 20 _ b _ splines of order 6 for the @xmath52 direction .",
    "the bo potential curves were calculated in an @xmath50 interval in between 0.1 and @xmath53 .",
    "the latter limit was mainly needed for a determination of the dissociation channel , i.e.  to find out into which atomic or ionic fragments heh@xmath0 dissociates .",
    "the basis set used for calculating the vibrational wavefunctions @xmath54 comprised a box r@xmath55 and 900 _ b _ splines of order 10 .",
    "0.75    0.70.75    calculations were performed for transitions starting from the lowest lying vibrational state of the electronic ground state to all the calculated electronic bound states , for both parallel and perpendicular orientation of the molecular axis with respect to the field .",
    "the results shown here are for transitions starting in the rotational level @xmath56 , which is the most probable value of @xmath26 at room temperature @xcite , and going to @xmath57 for the parallel orientation ( according to the selection rule @xmath58 , @xmath59 ) and to @xmath60 for the perpendicular transitions ( selection rule : @xmath61j = 0 , @xmath62 1 ) .",
    "since previous calculations @xcite were performed for transitions starting from @xmath63 , the spectrum for these transitions is also shown for comparison , but the final result is not significantly influenced by the rotational motion within the considered @xmath26 values .",
    "calculations of electronic energies and dipole moments for different values of the internuclear separation were performed . for checking the accuracy of these calculations , results were compared to literature ( @xcite ) and good agreement was found for the basis sets described in section [ method ] .",
    "plots of the computed potential curves for the @xmath20 and @xmath21 symmetries are shown in figures [ potsig ] and [ potpi ] , respectively .",
    "these potential curves were used in the subsequent calculation of the photodissociation cross sections . clearly , all potential curves are purely dissociative within the franck - condon window of the electronic ground state .",
    "one - photon transitions from the ground to the excited states lead therefore to dissociation .",
    "1.00    the gauge dependence of the results was investigated by comparing the electronic transition dipole moments obtained in either the length or the velocity gauge .",
    "the latter moments are obtained from equation ( [ eq : dipr ] ) , if the dipole operator is expressed as @xmath64 and multiplied by @xmath65 ( @xmath6 being the photon energy ) for comparing to the length gauge results .",
    "figure [ fig : dipoles ] shows a comparison of the transition dipole moments obtained in the two gauges for the equilibrium internuclear separation @xmath66 and for a parallel orientation ( transitions to @xmath20 states ) .",
    "the overall agreement is evidently very good .",
    "noticeable deviations are only found for some very high lying electronic rydberg states that possess , however , a very small transition moment .",
    "these deviations do therefore have an extremely small influence on the cross - sections obtained from all electronic states .    1.00    in figure [ comp ]",
    "the calculated photodissociation cross section for a parallel alignment of the molecular axis with respect to the photon polarization vector ( @xmath67 ) is compared to a previous result @xcite in which explicitly correlated basis functions had been used for the evaluation of the electronic wavefunctions .",
    "both results were obtained for transitions starting from the absolute rovibronic ground state of the heh@xmath0 molecule ( @xmath68 , @xmath69 ) .",
    "the most evident difference between the two spectra lies in the position and height of their maxima .",
    "this difference is due to the fact that the electronic wavefunctions especially for the ground and the first excited states are more accurately represented in @xcite than in the present calculation , as is concluded from a comparison of the corresponding energies .",
    "in references@xcite it was demonstrated that the present approach can yield extremely accurate two - electron wavefunctions , but this requires a judicious choice of the basis set , if the size of the calculation should be kept reasonably small .",
    "most importantly , different electronic states possess different optimal basis sets . on the other hand , the goal of the present work was to consider as many excited bound states as possible and to calculate all of them with sufficient and comparable accuracy",
    ". the most convenient way to do this is to use a single basis set for all states , since it avoids non - orthogonality problems and preserves sum - rule completeness .",
    "this leads to a compromise for the results for the ground and first excited states .",
    "it was checked that by improving the ground and first excited states the agreement to @xcite in the peak region is also improving .",
    "the remaining part of the spectrum that stems from transitions to higher - lying electronic states is , however , in good agreement with the previous result in @xcite .",
    "as is discussed below , for a comparison to the experiment reported in @xcite the accuracy of the first excited electronic state plays practically no role and thus the good agreement with the previous calculation for the higher photon energies is more important for the purpose of this work .",
    "figure [ comp ] shows also the parallel photodissociation cross section for the first excited rotational state ( @xmath70 ) which , according to @xcite , is the most probable rotational level at room temperature .",
    "accidentally , the result for @xmath70 agrees better to the previous theoretical calculation performed for @xmath69 . from this accidental agreement and the discussion above it is clear that the influence of rotational excitation is in general rather small and most prominent for the transition to the first excited electronic state .",
    "it was , however , checked that the results shown in the following are all relatively insensitive to the initial rotational state , as long as @xmath26 is not very large .",
    "1.00    figure [ iso ] shows the photodissociation cross section of heh@xmath1 for an isotropic orientation of the molecular axis with respect to the field , as well as the parallel ( @xmath8 ) and perpendicular ( @xmath9 ) contributions to it , for transitions starting from the lowest lying vibrational state @xmath71 and the first excited rotational level @xmath56 .",
    "it can be seen in figure [ iso ] that until about 27.5ev the spectrum is practically identical to the parallel contribution , while above about 29ev the perpendicular contribution is clearly dominant .",
    "similarly to the parallel case the perpendicular spectrum shows a dominant low - energy peak followed by a rather structureless tail .",
    "in fact , the tail looks more like a second peak , but it is composed of a number of electronic transitions . in comparison to the tail for a parallel alignment the one in the perpendicular case is confined to a smaller energy window .",
    "an older calculation @xcite ( performed using the length gauge ) took into account only three excited states of heh@xmath1 , namely the first two excited @xmath47 states and the first @xmath2 state .",
    "figure [ iso ] shows that for these particular states the agreement between the present calculation and the one from @xcite is excellent , but at the photon energy used in the flash experiment higher lying states clearly dominate the spectrum .",
    "the heteronuclear heh@xmath1 ion can dissociate into two different channels : he + h@xmath1 and h + he@xmath1 .",
    "the flash experiment @xcite measured only the cross section given by the dissociation of heh@xmath1 into he + h@xmath1 .",
    "a comparison requires thus a separation of the two channels . within the adiabatic approximation the asymptotic long - range behaviour , i.e.  the separated atom limit at @xmath72 , defines the channel into which the population of a given adiabatic electronic state dissociates . at @xmath73",
    "the potential curves were found to have almost reached the separated atom limit .",
    "a comparison of the asymptotic potential - curve energies with the sum of the energies of an independent atom and ion ( he + h@xmath1 or h + he@xmath1 ) in their various states yielded a well - defined channel assignment .",
    "the result is shown in figures  [ potsig ] and [ potpi ] .",
    "most of the lower lying states dissociate into he + h@xmath1 while the highest lying rydberg states dissociate into h + he@xmath1 .",
    "the two blocks are rather well separated , except for three states ( for both @xmath20 and @xmath21 symmetry ) that dissociate into h + he@xmath1 but lie in the energy regime dominated by the he + h@xmath1 channel .",
    "1.0    after considering only transitions to electronic states that are assigned to the he + h@xmath1 channel the _ partial _ photodissociation cross section shown in figure [ chan1 ] is obtained . the result ( obtained for @xmath68 and @xmath70 )",
    "shows in comparison to figure [ iso ] that overall dissociation into the he + h@xmath1 channel is clearly less favoured .",
    "however , the relative importance of the two channels varies strongly with photon energy .",
    "below about 27ev the spectrum stems solely from the first excited state of @xmath20 symmetry which dissociates into h + he@xmath1 . in between about 30 and",
    "35ev the total dissociation cross section is dominated by the contribution from the lowest lying @xmath21 state that also dissociates into h + he@xmath1 .",
    "a smaller contribution comes , however , from the second excited @xmath20 state .",
    "this state is responsible for the first peak observed in the he + h@xmath1 channel in figure [ chan1 ] .",
    "thus the parallel contribution is equal to the total cross section of this channel in that energy range . above about 35ev",
    "many other states contribute , and the cross sections for the two dissociation channels are almost of equal size , as a comparison of figures [ iso ] and [ chan1 ] shows . since the majority of the states dissociating into he + h@xmath1 lies energetically above the ones dissociating into h + he@xmath1 , the maximum of the second peak of the he + h@xmath1 cross section is shifted to slightly higher energy than the one of the total dissociation cross section",
    ".    for comparison , figure [ chan1 ] shows also the experimentally determined _ absolute _ partial dissociation cross section at 38.7ev for the he + h@xmath1 channel as well as its parallel contribution @xcite .",
    "the agreement is almost perfect , but further aspects have to be considered for a direct comparison .",
    "first , the present analysis is based on an adiabatic model .",
    "second , it appears to be clear that the heh@xmath0 ions investigated in the experiment were not in their vibrational ground state .",
    "these two issues are thus discussed in the remainder of this section .",
    "the potential curves in figures [ potsig ] and [ potpi ] show a number of avoided crossings .",
    "clearly , at these crossings there is some probability for a transition from one adiabatic curve to the other . in the present context",
    "not all avoided crossings are , however , of equal importance .",
    "those between states dissociating into the same dissociation channel do not change the partial cross section into , e.g. , the he + h@xmath1 channel .",
    "( clearly , these avoided crossing have to be considered in a calculation of other differential spectra like the kinetic - energy distribution of the ionic or atomic fragments . ) a more careful analysis that takes also the relative importance of the different electronic states ( at the experimental photon energy ) into account shows that the most critical avoided crossing for the present discussion is the one occuring close to @xmath74 between the 2nd and 3rd excited state of @xmath20 symmetry ( see figure [ potsig ] ) .",
    "( this avoided crossing is already visible in the theoretical data in @xcite and thus reproduced by other numerical methods . )",
    "a standard procedure for estimating the importance of diabatic effects at an avoided curve crossing is provided by the landau - zener approximation ( see , e.g. , chapter 10 in @xcite and references therein ) . within this model the probability for a transition from one adiabatic curve to the other is given by @xmath75\\ ; , % \\ ] ] where @xmath76 is the internuclear separation at which the avoided crossing occurs , @xmath77 is the diabatic coupling which can be calculated from the relation @xmath78 ( @xmath79 and @xmath80 being the adiabatic energies ) , the velocity @xmath81 is obtained from the kinetic energy and @xmath82 are the slopes of the diabatic curves at @xmath76 . in the present case , it turns out that the landau - zener formula is difficult to apply , since the two curves cross in a region where their behaviour is not at all linear .",
    "( a removal of the nuclear repulsion term does not resolve this problem . ) as a consequence , it is difficult to estimate the slopes and the result of the landau - zener estimate has such a large error bar that it is practically needless .",
    "consequently , figure [ chan1 ] shows the cross sections in the two extreme cases : the already discussed adiabatic limit ( @xmath83 ) and the fully diabatic one ( @xmath84 ) . from the figure",
    "one may conclude that the influence of possible diabatic effects on the cross section at the photon energy used in the experiment is not very relevant .",
    "the most noticeable changes would take place at lower photon energies .    1.00    all the spectra shown",
    "so far were obtained by assuming that the system starts in the lowest lying vibrational state @xmath71 .",
    "this is valid for thermal distributions at not too high temperatures .",
    "however , due to the way the heh@xmath0 ions are generated in the flash experiment reported in @xcite the detailed vibrational distribution is unknown , but not expected to be thermal . in a more recent experiment on he@xmath85 in which the ions were produced in the same way ( by heavy particle collisions ) the vibrational distribution was determined @xcite . in this case",
    "the initial - state distribution was found to be distributed over at least 5 vibrational states ( @xmath68 to 4 ) . since the binding energy of he@xmath85 is similar to that of heh@xmath0 , one may expect a similar vibrational - state distribution for both ions .",
    "therefore , photodissociation cross sections for transitions starting from different vibrational states were computed .",
    "the ones corresponding to the initial states @xmath86 , and 3 are shown in figure [ n1n4 ] .    at the experimental photon energy",
    "the results for both the adiabatic and diabatic limit are very close to each other , but there are evident differences at lower photon energies . accidentally , the photon energy in @xcite probes the spectrum of the heh@xmath0 ion at a point where the cross sections of the @xmath68 and @xmath87 states cross each other . as a consequence ,",
    "the performed experiment is rather insensitive to a redistribution of population between the states with @xmath68 and @xmath87 .",
    "the population of higher vibrational states ( @xmath88 ) leads on the other hand to a decrease of the cross section at 38.7ev .",
    "the trend visible for @xmath89 and @xmath90 continues for higher values of @xmath22 , as was checked though not explicitly shown .",
    "1.00    if one assumes the initial vibrational distribution of heh@xmath0 in @xcite to be identical to the one of he@xmath91 in @xcite , the photodissociation cross section shown in figure [ mixvib ] is obtained .",
    "the vibrational distribution is in this case modelled in the following way : 33@xmath92 of the vibrational population was considered to be in the @xmath71 level , 45@xmath92 in @xmath93 , and 22 @xmath92 are equally distributed over the states @xmath94 .",
    "compared to figure [ chan1 ] the influence of the vibrational distribution is obvious : the shape of the spectrum changes and the value of the cross section at the experimental photon energy ( 38.7ev ) increases slightly ( from @xmath95 mb  see figure [ chan1 ]  to @xmath96 mb ) .",
    "thus the agreement to experiment decreases , but remains still well within the error bars of the measured cross section . in view of the lack of knowledge about the experimental initial vibrational distribution , it is , however , impossible to finally conclude on the degree of agreement between theory and experiment .",
    "as the present study shows , this distribution has a rather strong influence on the photodissociation cross section .",
    "in fact , the theoretical results may indicate a narrower vibrational distribution than the one found for he@xmath91 in @xcite that was assumed to be similar to the one of heh@xmath0 in @xcite .",
    "it would certainly be of interest to have experimental data also for other photon energies . this may also help to ( indirectly ) determine the initial vibrational - state distribution .",
    "furthermore , these data may be an interesting direct measure of the adiabaticity at the discussed avoided crossing between the 2nd and 3rd excited state of @xmath20 symmetry .",
    "in this work the photodissociation cross section of heh@xmath1 was computed . a previous theoretical result that considered a parallel alignment of the molecular axis was confirmed . a calculation for a perpendicular alignment",
    "was performed that considered a large number of electronic states in order to obtain a converged photodissociation cross section . in order to compare to a recent experiment ,",
    "the partial cross sections for dissociation into either he + h@xmath0 or h + he@xmath0 were determined .",
    "this was done within the adiabatic approximation , but possible diabatic effects were estimated .",
    "different initial vibrational and rotational levels were considered and photodissociation spectra for transitions starting from the rotational levels @xmath97 and vibrational levels @xmath98 were presented .",
    "the influence of the vibrational motion on the final spectra was investigated and compared to the experimental findings .",
    "agreement within the experimental error bar was found , but it was concluded that the knowledge of the experimental vibrational distribution is important for a final conclusion . the present analysis should motivate further experimental studies , especially at variable photon energy , as it should become possible due to the current progress in the development of free - electron lasers .",
