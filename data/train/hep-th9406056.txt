    "non - critical string theory in general and the @xmath6 string models in particular attracted much attention in recent years .",
    "they provide a framework for studying fundamental questions of string theory and quantum gravity such as non - perturbative structure .",
    "the most challenging of these class of models is the @xmath5 string .",
    "it differs from the @xmath7 string models by that it has a space - time description and a propagating massless degree of freedom , the tachyon .",
    "furthermore , brst analysis in the continuum description of the theory revealed the existence of special states at discrete values of momentum @xcite , one of which was argued to correspond to a discrete graviton describing the two - dimensional black hole of @xcite .",
    "@xmath7 non - critical string models constructed by coupling @xmath7 conformal matter to two - dimensional gravity , have been studied using a variety of methods reflecting their integrable and topological structures .",
    "their topological phase is realized by @xmath8 minimal topological matter coupled to topological gravity @xcite , from which they can be reached by appropriate perturbations .",

    "matrix integral representations of the generating functions have been suggested by @xcite . for the case",
    "@xmath12 , that is pure topological gravity , they reduce to the kontsevich integral @xcite . however , while the latter integral has a nice interpretation in terms of cell decomposition of the moduli space of riemann surfaces , the geometrical meanings of the general integrals are less clear",
    ". nevertheless , these matrix integrals provide a link between the integrable and the topological structures .",
    "a manifestation of the integrable and topological structures is also provided by a set of ward identities given by @xmath13 constraints on the partition function of the theory .",
    "this is argued to be equivalent to specifying the integrable hierarchy together with a string equation @xcite and to a set of topological recursion relations @xcite as we discuss in the sequel .",
    "another relation between the integrable and the topological structures of the theories has been discovered using the topological landau - ginzburg formulation @xcite .",
    "the integrable hierarchy appears in the landau - ginzburg description in its lax formulation .",
    "the landau - ginzburg superpotential is identified with the lax operator in the dispersionless limit .",
    "there exist two types of topological recursion relations for correlators of @xmath8 theories . the basic strategy behind both is analysis of contributions to the correlators from the boundary of the moduli space . one set of recursion relations has been derived , first for pure topological gravity in @xcite and later generalized to topological matter coupled to topological gravity @xcite .",
    "the second set has been derived for pure topological gravity in @xcite . in the latter",
    "the concept of contact algebra was introduced , which together with the requirement of the invariance of the correlators under the interchange of operators provides a complete solution of the theory .",
    "the , thus derived , topological recursion relations coincide with the virasoro constraints on the partition function of the theory .",
    "the uniqueness of the contact algebra underlying the theory has been proved in @xcite .",
    "the generalization of the contact algebra to @xmath8 models coupled to topological gravity was suggested in @xcite , and was argued to correspond to the @xmath13 constraints on the partition function . a key role in this topological procedure",
    "is played by multicontacts whose importance was realized in @xcite .",
    "correlators of general @xmath8 models on the sphere , as well as those of @xmath14 model on higher genus , were consistently calculated using the topological scheme .",
    "the computation of genus @xmath15 correlators for @xmath16 requires a consistent regularization scheme which is still lacking .",
    "however , as shown in @xcite , one can overcome this problem since the recursion relations can be recast in a form that involves only one and two contacts .",
    "the topological description of the @xmath5 string is conjectured to correspond to @xmath8 model coupled to topological gravity , analytically continued to @xmath3 or equivalently , to @xmath17 twisted minimal model coupled to topological gravity .",

    "third , @xmath20 amplitudes as well as five - point function at various kinematic regions agree @xcite .",
    "the integrable hierarchy underlying the @xmath5 string is the toda - lattice hierarchy @xcite .",

    "there exist a matrix integral representation of the latter @xcite , generalizing that of the @xmath7 case .",
    "recently the string equations were constructed @xcite .    the topological landau - ginzburg description of the theory is constructed as the @xmath21 model at @xmath19 @xcite .",
    "a relation between the integrable and the topological structures is established by that the landau - ginzburg superpotential is the baker - akhiezer wave function of the toda lattice hierarchy @xcite .",

    "the @xmath4 algebra of constraints on the partition function is probably the @xmath5 analog of the @xmath13 algebra of constraints in the @xmath7 cases .",
    "these ward identities can be derived from the toda lattice and the string equations @xcite . on the other hand",
    "they coincide with period integrals in the topological landau - ginzburg formulation of the theory @xcite .",
    "these provide another link between the topological and the integrable structures of the @xmath5 string .",
    "as described , the integrable and topological structures of the @xmath5 case parallel those of the @xmath7 cases .",
    "one of the main differences , however , is the lack of topological recursion relations in the former .",
    "it is straightforward to verify that witten s topological recursion relations are no longer correct for the @xmath5 string , and should be modified .",
    "however , the required modification is still unknown .",
    "our aim in this paper is to generalize the second set of topological recursion relations as proposed in @xcite for the @xmath7 models , and provide a topological procedure for computation of correlators in @xmath5 .",
    "the idea will be to analytically continue the @xmath8 recursion relations to @xmath3 .",
    "we will show explicitly for genus zero and one that the analytically continued topological recursion relations coincide with the @xmath4 ward identities for tachyon correlators , and will argue that their structures coincide for any genus .",
    "we will further use the topological recursion relations to compute correlators of @xmath3 gravitational descendants which are suggested to correspond to discrete states of the @xmath5 string . similarly to the @xmath7 cases , we show that the topological recursion relations can be recast in a form that involves only one and two splittings of the riemann surface .",

    "topological recursion relations in terms of one and two splittings are written in section seven .",
    "section eight is devoted to the study of higher genus recursion relations .",
    "we define a regularized contact and use it to prove the equivalence between the recursion relations and the @xmath4 ward identities on the torus .",
    "two and three point tachyon correlators on the torus are computed via the topological procedure .",
    "section nine is devoted to discussion and conclusions . in appendix",

    "such a correlator corresponds in @xmath3 to @xmath156 with @xmath157 .",

    "indeed the ghost number conservation law ( [ cgh ] ) reads in this case kq++ n_1 + n_2 = q + 1 and thus @xmath26 must be zero .",
    "the same problem with consistency occurs if we take two different descendants as marked operators .",
    "thus there is no non - vanishing three point function with a descendant in @xmath8 models . in order to get a consistent scheme at @xmath3 via analytical continuation of the @xmath160 degeneration equation",

    "we get : p_q+p_n_1p_n_2p_n_3= [ ds4pt ] unlike the correlator of four primaries , the correlator ( [ ds4pt ] ) does not include @xmath164 terms and thus does not depend on the choice of the kinematic region .",
    "the constraint @xmath162 on the descendant as a consequence of the ghost number conservation law is also necessary for consistency .",
    "if the constraint is not satisfied , that is @xmath165 , the value of the correlator depends on the choice of the marked operator .",
    "in such a case , when the descendant is chosen as the marked operator we get for the correlator @xmath166 while if one of the primaries , for instance @xmath154 , is taken to be the marked operator we get @xmath167 .",

    "note , however , that we can not take a negative tachyon to be the marked operator within the degeneration equation framework while considering him as a gravitational descendant of the zero momentum tachyon , since it will have zero number of contacts . on the other hand we saw that we can take it to be the marked operator with a formal negative number of contacts .",
