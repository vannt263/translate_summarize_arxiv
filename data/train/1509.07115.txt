    "the discrete spherical bessel transform ( dsbt ) arises in a number of applications , such as , e.g. , the analysis of the cosmic microwave background @xcite , the numerical solution of the differential equations @xcite , and the numerical evaluation of multi - center integrals @xcite .",
    "many different sbt algorithms have been proposed so far @xcite . but",
    "none of them possess all of the advantages of their trigonometric progenitor , namely the fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "these advantages are the performance fastness , the uniform coordinate grid , and the orthogonality .",
    "an example of the problem requiring the simultaneous presence of all the advantages is the solving of the schrdinger - type equation ( se ) by means of the pseudospectral approach @xcite .",
    "the grid uniformity provides the same accuracy of the wave function description in the whole domain of definition .",
    "the grid identity for all orders of a spherical bessel functions ( sbf ) allows to switch to the discrete variable representation ( dvr ) @xcite .",
    "the dsbt orthogonality is needed to provide the hermiticity of the radial part of the laplacian operator in dvr .",
    "the lack of the laplacian operator hermiticity impedes the convergence of iterative methods ( such as conjugate gradient method ) for the solution of matrix equations ( which are obtained by dvr from the stationary se ) . in the case of time - dependent se ,",
    "the hermiticity of the laplacian operator is crucial for the conservation of the wave function norm during the time evolution .",
    "a pioneering approach based upon the convolution integral @xcite requires a number of operations of the order of @xmath0 for its performing , just like the fft does , that means that it is quite fast .",
    "however it employs a strongly nonuniform grid ( a node location exponentially depending on its number ) . hence the attempts of its utilization for the se solving @xcite ended in problems with the strong near - center localization of a wave function .",
    "a method rest on the spherical bessel functions expansion over the trigonometric functions @xcite also appears to be quite fast ( requiring as few as @xmath1 operations ) and employs a uniform grid .",
    "but it is not orthogonal and has stability difficulties because of the singular factors in the spherical bessel functions expansion over the trigonometric functions .",
    "next , a gauss - bessel quadrature based technique suggested in @xcite is orthogonal and converges exponentially , but it is not fast ( as the number of operations required scales as @xmath2 ) and needs an @xmath3-dependent grid .",
    "nevertheless its fast convergence and the near - uniform grid motivated to apply it for a time - dependent gross - pitaevsky equation @xcite .",
    "finally , an approach rest on the sbf integral representation via legendre polynomials , proposed in @xcite , appears to be fast , makes use of the uniform grid , but it is not orthogonal .",
    "in the present work we are proposing the algorithm for the dsbt that is orthogonal , fast , and it implies the uniform grid . our approach is based upon the sbt factorization into the two subsequent transforms , namely the fft and the discrete orthogonal legendre polynomials derivatives based transform .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section [ sec : dsbt ] , we develop the orthogonal fast dsbt on a uniform grid .",
    "next , in section [ sec : testing ] , the proposed method is tested via the evaluation of the gaussian atomic functions transform and also the dsbt basis functions comparison to the exact sbfs . in section [ sec :",
    "example ] the dsbt- and dvr - based approach ( dsbt - dvr ) for the time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) solving is suggested and examined .",
    "the approach efficiency is illustrated by treating of the problem of the hydrogen molecular ion ionization by laser pulse .",
    "finally , in section [ sec : conclusion ] we briefly discuss the obtained results as well as the prospects of dsbt and dsbt - dvr application .",
    "a typical problem involving the spherical bessel transform ( sbt ) is the plane wave expansion of a three - dimensional function @xmath4 .",
    "the expansion over the spherical harmonics yields a radius - dependent function @xmath5 if the function @xmath4 has no singularities , then @xmath6 .",
    "let us introduce the sbt as @xmath7 here we perform the function substitution @xmath8 ( a magnetic quantum number is not used further , therefore from this point on we omit it from the denotation for the sake of simplification ) , then execute the expansion over the functions @xmath9 where @xmath10 is a spherical bessel function ( sbf ) of the first kind .",
    "the functions @xmath11 satisfy the normalization condition @xmath12 .",
    "the pre - integral factor in is introduced in order to make the transform unitary .",
    "the beginning of our derivation coincides with the one in the work @xcite .",
    "but unlike its authors we are going to aim at the factorization of the sbt into the two separate transformations , namely the fft and also the additional orthogonal transform which we denote fourie - to - bessel transform ( ftb ) .",
    "the sbf may be presented as @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the legendre polynomial of @xmath3-th order . upon substituting the latter expression into eq . , we obtain @xmath15 here the integral over @xmath16 is different from the fourier transform of the function @xmath17 by the presence of the integrand factor @xmath18 . this factor might be represented as a result of taking a derivative of @xmath19 over @xmath20 .",
    "thus we get the expression @xmath21 making use of the legendre polynomials parity condition @xmath22 , one may further reduce the integral over @xmath20 from @xmath23 to @xmath24 to the one in the limits from @xmath25 to @xmath24 as @xmath26\\psi_\\ell(r ) dr d\\eta \\label{c_vs_psi}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    next , let us define a new function @xmath27\\psi_\\ell(r ) dr \\label{tilde_c_def}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the term @xmath28/(2i^{\\ell+1})$ ] is equal to @xmath29 for the even @xmath3 and to @xmath30 for the odd ones .",
    "hence the expression appears to be correspondingly the sine / cosine fourier transform of the function @xmath17 , depending on @xmath3 being even or odd .    in terms of the new denotation",
    "the formula can be rewritten as @xmath31 upon making the substitution @xmath32 this expression takes the following form @xmath33 let us perform the integration by parts , then move the derivative over @xmath34 to the legendre polynomial . as a result",
    "we obtain the following formula for the ftb @xmath35 it is easily seen that @xmath36 , just as expected , since @xmath37 and the bessel expansion coincides with the fourier expansion at @xmath38 .",
    "one may rewrite in the operator form as @xmath39 , where the integral transform operator @xmath40 has the kernel @xmath41 here @xmath42 is the heaviside step function .",
    "the ftb operator @xmath40 must be unitary ( that is @xmath43 ) , hence the inverse transform is @xmath44 .",
    "the inverse ftb might be explicitly defined as @xmath45    the substitution of into demonstrates that is indeed inverse in respect to , due to the condition @xmath46 this condition holds true since for any polynomial @xmath47 of the order @xmath48 true is the expression @xmath49 in turn , this relation is the consequence of the well - known legendre polynomials property , @xmath50 following from their orthogonality .",
    "let us introduce the coordinate grid with the step @xmath51 in the following way @xmath52 the elements of vector @xmath53 of the function values are sampled on the grid as @xmath54 the elements of the fourier transform matrix are defined as follows @xmath55 here the momentum grid is @xmath56 where the momentum step is @xmath57 , the integration interval size is @xmath58 , and the summation limits are @xmath59/2 $ ] and @xmath60 , that is @xmath61 for the odd @xmath3 and @xmath62 for the even ones .    the fourier transform may be written in the matrix form as @xmath63 it yields as a result the value of the vector of the fourier expansion coefficients @xmath64 related to the function @xmath65 as follows : @xmath66 where the weights @xmath67 since the fourier transform matrix @xmath68 is orthogonal , then under the transform the norm is conserved , that is @xmath69 .",
    "the transform performing through the fft algorithm requires the number of operations of the order of @xmath70 .",
    "the transform conserves the norm according to @xmath71 the approximation of the integrals in this relation by the trapezoidal rule yields @xmath72 where we introduce the vector @xmath73 composed of the coefficients of the bessel expansion @xmath74    next , let us write the direct and inverse discrete ftb ( dftb ) in the following form @xmath75 in order for to hold true , the matrix @xmath76 has to be orthogonal , that is @xmath77    if we attempt to apply the trapezoidal rule directly to , then we would obtain @xmath78 however this technique of the matrix construction does not provide its orthogonality .",
    "the reason is that the equation does not hold upon the approximate integration .",
    "the employing of the high - order newton - cotes rules instead of the trapezoidal rule does not make the situation better . in order for to be true ,",
    "it is necessary for to hold for all the subgrids with the arbitrary nodes number .",
    "the high - order newton - cotes rules do not provide high accuracy for an arbitrary subgrid . therefore the only way to preserve the transform orthogonality appears to be the modification of the integral kernel under the proceeding to the numerical integration .      in the context of the summation on grids ,",
    "the properties analogous to those of the legendre polynomials are possessed by the so - called discrete legendre orthogonal polynomials ( dlop ) @xcite .",
    "dlop @xmath79 satisfy the orthogonality property given by @xmath80 and also the normalizing condition @xmath81 . here",
    "@xmath82 where @xmath83 is @xmath84-th falling factorial of @xmath85 , @xmath86 .",
    "dlop might be presented as @xmath87 where @xmath88 are coefficients of the expansion of the shifted legendre polynomial @xmath89 .",
    "this means that @xmath79 can be obtained from @xmath90 through the substitution of @xmath91 for @xmath92 . as the grid size increases ,",
    "dlop tend to the usual legendre polynomials according to @xmath93    due to the orthogonality condition dlop possess a property similar to the property , as follows @xmath94 making use of this fact one can easily prove ( as shown in the appendix ) that for any discrete polynomial @xmath95 of the order @xmath96 true is the following relation @xmath97 where the weight function coincides with the weights of the trapezoidal integration rule for the grid with a unit step @xmath98 here we define a new discrete polynomial @xmath99(i , n-1)\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] which is proportional to the backward difference @xmath100(i , n-1)=p_\\ell(i , n-1)-p_\\ell(i-1,n-1 ) \\label{backdiff}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] and hence has the order @xmath101 .",
    "this polynomial tends to the derivative of the usual legendre polynomial as @xmath102 that is faster than the dlop tends to its non - discrete analogue .",
    "therefore we shall further refer to @xmath103 as the derivative of the discrete orthogonal legendre polynomial ( ddlop ) .",
    "it should be mentioned that this term has different meanings throughout the literature @xcite .",
    "it follows from the relation that the integral kernel in eq .",
    "can be approximated on the grid by means of ddlop according to @xmath104 .",

    "now let us elucidate the physical meaning of the extra basis vectors .",

    "since @xmath141 , the additional basis vectors represent the high - momentum wave - function components converging to zero slower than @xmath142 .",
    "that is to say , the additional vectors emerge to be a linear combination of the non - regular sbfs ( sbfs of the second kind ) .",
    "if @xmath17 appears to be a result of the spherical harmonics expansion of a 3d function having the continuous derivatives up to order @xmath143 , then @xmath144 , hence it should be @xmath145 at @xmath146 . in the case when the function possesses singularities",
    "such components become non - zero and should be considered as having the energy larger than that of the component specified by the coefficient @xmath147 .",
    "thus , our dsbt does not yield coefficients for the small momenta @xmath148 .",
    "the reason for this is that at such @xmath149 there exist no sbf of the first kind satisfying the boundary conditions ( see also the section [ sec : testing ] ) .",
    "the fast transform might be accomplished by means of the technique proposed in the work @xcite , except that we shall use ddlop instead of the legendre polynomials .",

    "the fast fourier transform operations number scales as @xmath70 .",
    "that is the dsbt in total requires @xmath169 operations . at large @xmath156 the fft strongly over - demands the dftb",

    "the @xmath189-th function has the nodes number minimal among the functions satisfying the boundary conditions at @xmath190 and the asymptotics @xmath191 at @xmath192 . upon the step @xmath187 decreasing at the fixed @xmath182 the number @xmath193 grows and the dsbt basis function in its domain of definition becomes closer to the sbf .",

    "it is apparent that the difference grows with distance .",
    "the reason for the difference to be maximal at @xmath196 may be understood if one recalls that sbfs asymptotically equivalent to @xmath197 ; \\quad r\\to\\infty . \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] the dsbt basis function satisfies the same boundary conditions as the functions constituting it ( sines or cosines ) do @xmath198 that means that there does exist a phase shift @xmath199 near the outer boundary between the approximate and exact functions .",
    "the fact of the amplitude of the difference between the sbfs and dsbt basis functions growing roughly linearly with @xmath16 increasing ( which is seen from fig.[fig : berr ] ) indicates that the phase shift between these functions grows linearly with @xmath16 as well .",
    "such phase shift behavior may be interpreted as a consequence of the approximate and exact functions wavenumbers being distinct .",
    "therefore the dsbt basis function has to be closer to the sbf at such momentum @xmath200 that provides the exact sbf coincidence with the dsbt basis function on the grid boundary .",
    "this condition might be written mathematically as @xmath201 from the phase shift between the dsbt basis functions and exact sbfs near the outer boundary one can obtain the approximate expression @xmath202     +    on fig.[fig : berr_k_corr ] , we plot the @xmath203 , i.e. the difference between the dsbt basis functions and sbfs for the corrected momentum @xmath200 .",
    "it is seen that the difference is an order of magnitude less than in the case of the non - corrected momentum ( fig.[fig : berr ] ) at the same @xmath204 . yet",
    "the rate of the basis function convergence to the corrected momentum sbf is still @xmath179 ( whereas @xmath205 ) .",
    "thus our transformation result arrears to be more exact approximation to the expansion in sbfs on the grid @xmath200 than it is on the uniform grid @xmath149 .",
    "however the grid @xmath200 is non - uniform and @xmath3-dependent , and this complicates the application with no convergence rate advantage .",
    "as an example of dsbt application we developed the method for a numerical solution of 3d time - dependent schrdinger equation ( tdse ) .",
    "let us make use of discrete variable representation ( dvr ) .",

    ", a non - regular high - frequency function may be approximated by the sum of regular functions with large momenta .",
    "so , as the highest spectrum part coefficients are evaluated rather inaccurately , one may assume without loss of accuracy the coefficient with @xmath217 to be the value of the projection on a basis function with large momentum @xmath218 .",
    "meanwhile , for a smooth @xmath4 this coefficient vanishes anyway .",

    "the transform eq . requires @xmath226 operations .",
    "it should be noted that the term @xmath227 is caused not only by the operation of polar angle @xmath228 multiplication by the transform matrix , but also by the multiplication by matrices @xmath229 ( matrix multiplication at the fixed @xmath216 requires @xmath230 operations , whereas the number of different @xmath216 s is equal to @xmath231 ) .",
