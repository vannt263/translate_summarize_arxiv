    "neutral @xmath3 meson mixing plays a crucial role in the determination of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa matrix elements @xmath8 and @xmath9 . however , the extraction of these elements from measurements of the oscillation frequency is complicated by the presence of hadronic uncertainties .",
    "lattice qcd calculations  @xcite give a 1520% uncertainty in the determination of @xmath10 from the precisely measured value of the @xmath11 oscillation frequency , @xmath12 , due to the large uncertainty in the decay constant and the `` b '' parameter for @xmath11 mesons .",
    "this uncertainty can be reduced by extracting the ratio @xmath13 from the ratio of @xmath14 and @xmath11 oscillation frequencies , @xmath15 , as many theoretical uncertainties common to @xmath14 and @xmath11 mixing cancel , leading to a reduced theoretical uncertainty of 510%  @xcite . in the framework of the standard model , @xmath16",
    "is constrained by unitarity so the measurement of the @xmath14 oscillation frequency will significantly improve our knowledge of @xmath10 .    measuring the oscillation frequency",
    "requires three ingredients : the @xmath17 or @xmath18 flavor at both production and decay , and the proper decay time . in the standard model",
    ", one expects @xmath19 to be an order of magnitude larger than @xmath12 , making it difficult to measure as the rapid oscillations have to be resolved in the detector .",
    "the sld pixel ccd vertex detector is particularly well suited to this task thanks to its excellent three - dimensional vertex resolution .",
    "the analysis presented here determines the @xmath3 flavor at production by exploiting the large forward - backward asymmetry of polarized @xmath20 decays and uses additional information from the hemisphere opposite that of the reconstructed @xmath3 decay .",
    "the @xmath3 flavor at decay is tagged by the charge difference between the @xmath3 and cascade @xmath4 decay vertices .",
    "this novel `` charge dipole '' technique relies heavily on the high resolution of the vertex detector to reconstruct separate secondary and tertiary vertices originating from the @xmath21 decay chain . throughout this paper , when reference is made to a specific state , the charge conjugate state",
    "is also implied .",
    "the analysis uses a sample of @xmath1 hadronic @xmath2 decays collected by the sld experiment at the slc between 1996 and 1998 .",
    "the detector elements most relevant to this analysis are the pixel ccd vertex detector ( vxd )  @xcite for precise track position measurements near the slc interaction point ( ip ) , and the central drift chamber ( cdc ) for charged particle reconstruction and momentum measurement .",
    "charged tracks are reconstructed using hits in both vxd and cdc .",
    "the track impact parameter resolution at high momentum is measured to be 7.8  @xmath22 m transverse to the beam direction ( @xmath23 plane ) and 9.7  @xmath22 m in the plane containing the beam direction ( @xmath24 plane ) .",
    "the centroid of the stable , micron - sized ip in the @xmath23 plane is reconstructed using tracks in sets of @xmath25 sequential hadronic @xmath2 decays , with a measured precision of @xmath26 m .",
    "the @xmath27 coordinate of the ip is determined event by event using the median @xmath27 position of the tracks at their point of closest approach to the beam line .",
    "a precision of @xmath28 m is achieved for @xmath20 events , as estimated from the monte carlo ( mc ) simulation .    for a description of the sld detector and the mc simulation see ref .",
    "decays of @xmath29 mesons are modeled according to the decay modes of @xmath30 mesons  @xcite assuming su(3 ) flavor symmetry .",
    "the simulation has been tuned to reproduce tracking efficiencies and impact parameter resolutions measured in the data .",
    "the selection of @xmath31-hadron candidates proceeds in two stages .",
    "first , hadronic @xmath2 decays are selected .",
    "second , @xmath20 events are selected with an inclusive topological reconstruction of @xmath31-hadron decays .",
    "vertex and kinematical information ( mass and momentum ) is used at this stage to remove @xmath32 background .",
    "this second stage also serves as a means to select tracks associated with the @xmath31-hadron decay chain .    in the first stage",
    ", we select a sample of @xmath33 hadronic @xmath2 decays .",
    "the criteria , detailed in ref .",
    "@xcite , aim to remove leptonic final states , two - photon collisions and beam - induced background events .",
    "the remaining background , predominately due to @xmath34 events , is estimated to be @xmath35% .    in the second stage ,",
    "each event is divided into two hemispheres with respect to the thrust axis . in each hemisphere , a search is made for three - dimensional space points with high track overlap density which are displaced from the ip , taking the individual track resolution functions into account  @xcite . at this stage",
    ", no attempt is made to separate @xmath3 and @xmath4 decay vertices and a single `` seed '' vertex ( sv ) is formed containing all tracks from the @xmath31-hadron decay chain .",
    "tracks are required to have @xmath36 vxd hits , momentum transverse to the beam line @xmath37 mev / c , and three - dimensional impact parameter @xmath38 mm .",
    "tracks consistent with originating from a @xmath39 conversion or from @xmath40 or @xmath41 decay are removed",
    ". identified vertices are required to be within a radius of 2.3 cm of the center of the beam pipe to remove vertices resulting from interactions with the detector material .",
    "two - prong vertices are required to have an invariant mass at least 0.015 gev / c@xmath42 away from the nominal @xmath43 mass to remove most of the remaining @xmath43 decays .",
    "a set of two neural networks is used to suppress light - flavor ( @xmath32 ) background and to select the charged tracks associated with the @xmath31-hadron decay  @xcite .",
    "the first neural network takes as input the distance between the ip and the sv , that distance normalized by its error , and the angle between the vertex axis and the total momentum vector of the sv .",
    "the vertex axis is defined as the line joining the ip and the sv .",
    "at least one good vertex is found in 72.7% of bottom , 28.2% of charm , and 0.41% of @xmath44 quark hemispheres in the mc simulation .",
    "the second neural network improves the @xmath31-hadron charge and mass reconstruction by associating tracks not used in the initial vertexing to the seed vertex . for each track ,",
    "five parameters are taken as input to the neural network .",
    "the first four ( measured at the point of closest approach between the track and the vertex axis ) are the distance of closest approach , the distance between the ip and the point of closest approach along the vertex axis , the ratio between that distance and the ip - to - sv distance , and the angle between the track and the vertex axis .",
    "the fifth parameter is the three - dimensional impact parameter normalized by its error . a @xmath4510% inefficiency in full cdc - vxd track reconstruction is partly recovered by also including tracks reconstructed in the vxd alone ( `` vxd - only '' tracks ) .",
    "including vxd - only tracks with at least one hit in each of the three vxd layers reduces the tracking inefficiency to @xmath453% for heavy hadron decay products .",
    "these tracks are used for vertex charge reconstruction but not for vertex momentum or mass reconstruction because of their poor momentum resolution .    a sample of @xmath46 @xmath20 candidates is then selected by requiring that either hemisphere in the event contain a seed vertex with mass @xmath47 gev / c@xmath42 , where @xmath48 is partially corrected for missing neutral decay products  @xcite .",
    "the fraction of remaining light - flavor events is estimated to be 2.9% from the simulation .",
    "in the last phase of the analysis , we aim to reconstruct both @xmath3 and @xmath4 decay vertices in a given hemisphere . we can then tag the @xmath17 or @xmath18 decay flavor based on the charge difference between these vertices .",
    "the charge difference is expected to be @xmath49 ( 0 ) for decays with a charged ( neutral ) @xmath4 meson .",
    "this charge dipole method relies on the fact that the @xmath3 and cascade @xmath4 flight directions are very nearly co - linear and the @xmath3 and @xmath4 decay points are separated along the flight direction .",
    "the final vertex reconstruction is carried out separately for each event hemisphere and proceeds in two steps .    in the first step ,",
    "the @xmath31-hadron flight direction is determined using a set of tracks selected by one of two different procedures .",
    "the main track selection procedure uses the set of tracks ( including vxd - only tracks ) associated with a seed vertex .",
    "an alternative procedure is used if no sv is found in the hemisphere ( representing 15% of the decays in the final sample ) . in this case",
    ", tracks are required to have either @xmath503 vxd hits and @xmath37 mev / c , or @xmath502 vxd hits , @xmath5023 cdc hits , @xmath37 mev / c , a @xmath51 for both cdc and cdc+vxd track fits , a first cdc hit with a radius @xmath52 cm , a 2d impact parameter in @xmath531 cm , and a @xmath27 distance of closest approach to the ip @xmath54 cm .",
    "the latter procedure is useful to recover part of the inefficiency of the sv finding algorithm for @xmath31 hadrons decaying close to the ip , a region where the sensitivity to @xmath14 oscillations is highest .",
    "the tracks selected with either of the two above procedures are then used to estimate the @xmath31-hadron flight direction .",
    "this is done with a `` ghost '' track anchored at the ip and initially given an error of 25 @xmath22 m .",
    "each of the selected tracks is individually vertexed with the ghost track and the sum of the two - prong vertex fit @xmath55 values is computed .",
    "the direction of the ghost track is varied until this @xmath55 sum is minimized  with the final direction representing the best estimate of the @xmath31-hadron line of flight . the ghost track error",
    "is then scaled such that the largest single two - prong vertex fit @xmath55 equals 1 .    in the second step ,",
    "the selected tracks are divided into subsets defining decay vertices along the ghost track .",
    "this is done using the following iterative procedure .",
    "initially , the probabilities for all two - track @xmath56 ghost track and track @xmath56 ip candidate vertices are calculated .",
    "the vertex with the highest fit probability is saved and its track(s ) is ( are ) removed from the list of available tracks . if the highest probability vertex is one of the track @xmath56 ip vertices , it defines a new ip vertex .",
    "the highest probability vertex then serves as a new candidate vertex for the next step , where again all combinations of the remaining tracks with the new candidate vertex , with each other and the ghost track , and with the ip are formed .",
    "this process continues until all vertex fit probabilities are lower than 1% . a single ip results from this procedure .",
    "all remaining tracks ( not incorporated in the ip or a multi - prong vertex ) are then combined with the ghost track to form one - prong vertices .",
    "one advantage of this technique is that it allows for the reconstruction of one - prong decay vertices , which are fairly common in both @xmath3 and @xmath4 decays .",
    "details about the ability of this technique to reconstruct the correct number of vertices can be found in ref .",
    ".    hemispheres with exactly two vertices ( in addition to the ip ) are selected .",
    "the ( secondary ) vertex that is closer to the ip is labeled `` @xmath3 '' and the ( tertiary ) vertex farther away is labeled `` @xmath4 '' . if the @xmath4 vertex contains two or more tracks , the @xmath3 vertex is further refined by adding a virtual @xmath4 `` track '' to those tracks already attached to the @xmath3 vertex and a new vertex fit is performed .",
    "the @xmath4 track is formed using the @xmath4 vertex position and the net momentum direction of the @xmath4 vertex tracks .",
    "the error matrix of the @xmath4 track is scaled as a function of the @xmath4 vertex mass to partially account for the fact that the @xmath4 meson is not fully reconstructed .",
    "the vertices must satisfy a series of criteria to guarantee that the @xmath3 and @xmath4 vertices are well separated and well reconstructed : the @xmath3 vertex is downstream from the ip and has a radius @xmath57 cm , the distance between the @xmath3 and @xmath4 vertices ( @xmath58 ) satisfies @xmath59 m @xmath60 cm , the @xmath4 vertex mass is smaller than 2.0 gev / c@xmath42 ( assuming all tracks are pions ) , the ghost track error is smaller than 300  @xmath22 m , and the cosine of the angle between the nearest jet axis direction and the straight line connecting the ip and the @xmath3 vertex is greater than 0.9 . for purposes of flavor tagging ( see below ) , the @xmath3 and @xmath4 vertex charges are required to be different .",
    "several cuts are applied to enhance the @xmath61 purity and further improve the quality of the reconstruction for @xmath61 candidates : the net charge @xmath62 of all tracks associated with the decay chain is required to be zero and neither vertex may contain a vxd - only track with @xmath63 gev / c to make sure that the charge is reliably reconstructed .",
    "finally , @xmath11 decays are suppressed by vetoing decays including @xmath64 candidates . to this end",
    ", a veto is applied if slow pion candidates in either @xmath3 or @xmath4 vertices have a @xmath65 mass difference less than 0.16 gev / c@xmath42 .",
    "this veto reduces the @xmath14 ( @xmath11 ) selection efficiency by 5% ( 13% ) and results in a @xmath14 purity increase of 5% . for all data and mc events , we remove hemispheres already containing a vertex selected in two complementary analyses , one with fully reconstructed @xmath66  @xcite and the other with a lepton + @xmath4 vertex .",
    "such a removal is necessary to avoid statistical correlations and facilitate the combination of results from different analyses .    after applying all the above cuts , a sample of @xmath67 decays remains .",
    "the sample composition is 15.7% @xmath68 , 57.2% @xmath11 , 15.9% @xmath14 , 10.1% @xmath31  baryon , and 1.1% @xmath32 , as determined from the simulation .",
    "the decay flavor is determined by the sign of a vertex charge dipole defined as @xmath69 , where @xmath70 ( @xmath71 ) is the charge of the @xmath3 ( @xmath4 ) vertex .",

    "for example , the mistag probability is only 10% for @xmath74 decays",
    "( @xmath75 represents any state without charm ) but 46% for @xmath14 decays proceeding through a @xmath76 transition , where the latter category accounts for 24% of the selected @xmath14 decays .",

    "@xcite ) .    the proper time is computed using the measured decay length @xmath77 and momentum @xmath78 of the @xmath14 candidate , @xmath79 .",
    "the decay length is defined as the distance between the ip and the @xmath3 vertex . in the particular case of @xmath3 and @xmath4 vertices both containing just one track ( representing 17% of the final sample ) ,",

    "the momentum of the @xmath14 candidate is reconstructed with an optimized average of two different methods .",
    "the first method  @xcite starts with tracks associated with the decay and iteratively adds high energy ( @xmath85 gev ) neutral clusters ( from the electromagnetic calorimeter ) close to the @xmath3 vertex line of flight , until the invariant mass of the decay products is close to the @xmath3 mass .",

    "the decay length resolution uncertainty is determined from 3-prong @xmath165 decay vertices in the data and the momentum resolution is confirmed to within 10% by comparing the width of the energy distribution in the data with that expected from @xmath31-quark fragmentation  @xcite .",
    "the systematic uncertainty due to the particular choice of proper time resolution function is evaluated by varying core fractions and offset corrections .    the production flavor tag systematic error accounts for the uncertainties in the forward - backward asymmetry and opposite hemisphere charge tags .",
    "dominant uncertainties for the forward - backward asymmetry tag are the electron beam polarization @xmath166 and the parity - violating parameter @xmath167 .",
    "the uncertainty in the opposite hemisphere charge tag is extracted from events in which both hemispheres have such a tag .",
    "these double - tagged events provide a direct measurement of the average mistag rate , which agrees very well with the mc value and has an uncertainty of @xmath168 . the total uncertainty in the average production flavor mistag probability is estimated to be @xmath168 .",
    "furthermore , we allow for a deviation in the shape of the @xmath31-quark probability distribution for the data . the corresponding uncertainty is dominated by a @xmath169 uncertainty in the slope of the @xmath31-quark probability as a function of opposite hemisphere charge neural network output , as extracted from double - tagged events in the data .",
    "the decay flavor mistag probability is varied by @xmath163 for all @xmath31 hadrons .",
    "this uncertainty is determined from @xmath55 fits to the @xmath11 and @xmath68 mistag probabilities in the measured dipole - tagged forward - backward asymmetry and the fraction of mixed decays as a function of proper time .",
    "these fits confirm that the mistag rate for @xmath11 and @xmath68 decays is correctly modeled in the simulation . to account for a possible deviation from su(3 ) flavor symmetry ,",
    "an additional 7% uncertainty is assigned to @xmath14 decays .",
    "this value is obtained assuming an additional 20% uncertainty in the branching fraction for @xmath14 decays proceeding via a @xmath170 transition ( since these dominate the mistag rate ) .    including the systematic uncertainties , the following ranges of @xmath14 oscillation frequencies",
    "are excluded at the 95% c.l .",

    "the sensitivity to set a 95% c.l .",
    "lower limit , defined as the @xmath137 value below which @xmath172 , is found to be 8.7 ps@xmath6 .",
    "we have performed a search for @xmath173 oscillations using a sample of @xmath1 hadronic @xmath2 decays collected by the sld experiment .",
    "the cascade structure of @xmath31-hadron decays is reconstructed and the @xmath3 flavor at decay is tagged with a novel charge dipole technique that relies heavily on the excellent resolution of the ccd pixel vertex detector .",
    "the @xmath3 flavor at production is tagged using the polarized electron beam as well as track and vertex information from the hemisphere opposite that of the @xmath14 candidate . with a final sample of @xmath67",
    "decays , we achieve a sensitivity of 8.7 ps@xmath6 and exclude the following values of the @xmath14 oscillation frequency : @xmath5 ps@xmath6 and @xmath7 ps@xmath6 at the 95% c.l .    combining these results with those obtained from a sample of fully reconstructed @xmath66 mesons  @xcite yields a combined sld sensitivity of 11.1 ps@xmath6 and excludes @xmath14 oscillation frequencies @xmath174 ps@xmath6 at the 95% c.l .",
