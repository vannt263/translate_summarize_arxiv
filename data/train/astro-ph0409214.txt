    "1 and 2 show the distribution of the 1388 stars of the library in the hr diagram and teff - [ fe / h ] plane .",
    "stellar parameters and useful data have been searched in the literature or determined for all stars .",
    "they are described and can be retreived from the elodie.3 website .",
    "since the first version of the library , the reduction procedure described in prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) has been improved in several aspects but the general philosophy remains the same .",
    "the basic steps in the reduction are to    * correct the different orders in the spectra for the blaze effect and connect the orders together * mask the telluric lines and spikes due to cosmic rays : in the new version , the mask of the spikes due to cosmic rays has been suppressed because it was found to alter real features . because of it , in the previous version of the library lick indices measured on our spectra presented a slope compared to measurements on jones spectra , the strongest features were found weaker than real ( thanks to g. worthey who stressed our attention on this important problem ) . *",
    "make the flux calibration * build an interpolator which in turn is used to generate the grid that feeds the population synthesis program ( pegasehr ) .",
    "the strengthening of the spectra have been improved : artifacts near balmer s lines were corrected .",
    "the wavelength interval has been extended by adding 5 orders in the blue .",
    "it was 410 - 680 nm , it is now 400 - 680 .",
    "the correction for telluric lines has been improved .",
    "we corrected some small bugs in the fits keywords ( in particular an unfortunate bad rounding of crval1 ) .",
    "+ a full description of the reduction procedure can be found on the elodie.3 website .",
    "the spectra are available as fits file .",
    "three gzipped tarfiles , corresponding to the r=10000 , r=42000 libraries and the grid can be downloaded , as well as the table of measurements containing the stellar parameters estimated internally and the lick indices . the description of the files , calibration stes , specific keywords are described on the elodie.3 website ."

    "<S> we present elodie.3 , an updated release of the elodie library originally published in prugniel & soubiran ( 2001 ) . </S>",
    "<S> it is part of the spectrophotometric resources available in the hyperleda database where the spectra can be visualized or downloaded in fits format . </S>",
    "<S> the elodie library includes 1962 spectra of 1388 stars obtained with the elodie spectrograph at the observatoire de haute - provence 193 cm telescope in the wavelength range 400 to 680 nm . </S>",
    "<S> it provides a large coverage of atmospheric parameters : teff from 3000 k to 60000 k , log g from -0.3 to 5.9 and [ fe / h ] from -3.2 to + 1.4 . </S>",
    "<S> the library is given at two resolutions : r=42000 , with the flux normalized to the pseudo - continuum , r=10000 calibrated in physical flux ( reduced above earth atmosphere ) with a broad - band photometric precision of 2.5% and narrow - band precision of 0.5% . </S>",
    "<S> a grid of interpolated spectra is also given , which has been used for synthesis of stellar population with pegase - hr ( le borgne et al . </S>",
    "<S> 2004 ) . </S>",
    "<S> compared to the previous version we have doubled the size of the library , corrected some identification errors , improved the external stellar parameters and the reduction procedure . </S>",
    "<S> a detailed description is available at the elodie.3 website : + http://www.obs.u-bordeaux1.fr/m2a/soubiran/elodie_library.html </S>"
