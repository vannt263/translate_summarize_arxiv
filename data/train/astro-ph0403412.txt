    "tw hya is the closest known classical t tauri star , and exhibits high x - ray flux , large lithium abundance , and evidence for an actively accreting disk with accretion rate estimated to be from 10@xmath3 to 10@xmath4 m@xmath5 yr@xmath6 based on the large h@xmath7 equivalent width and the x - ray emission ( @xcite and refs therein ) . despite its apparently advanced age , estimated to be 5 to 20 myr , tw hya is surrounded by a disk of mass @xmath8 m@xmath5 inferred from dust emission ( @xcite ) .",
    "the disk is viewed nearly face - on , and is visible in scattered light to a radius of at least @xmath9 , or 200 au at a distance of 56 pc ( @xcite ) .",
    "several molecular species ( co , hcn , cn , hco@xmath10 , dco@xmath10 ) have been detected in the tw hya disk at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths using single dish telescopes ( @xcite ) . the proximity , isolation , and rich chemistry of the tw hya disk make this system an excellent target for the study of the physical and chemical structure of protoplanetary environments at high spatial resolution using interferometry .",
    "models may be directly compared to aperture synthesis images of molecular lines to verify the inferences from low resolution observations , and to further probe the kinematics , physical conditions , and chemistry .",
    "a first step in this direction was the imaging analysis of hco@xmath10 j=10 emission observed with the australia telescope compact array by  @xcite , though the spatial and spectral resolution were insufficient to examine the kinematics in any detail .",
    "the prospects are excellent for interferometric observations of protoplanetary disks at submillimeter wavelengths ( @xcite ) .",
    "the submillimeter array ( sma ) , now nearing completion on mauna kea , is an ideal instrument for making these observations ( @xcite ) . in this _ letter _ , we present early sma observations of the tw hya disk in the co j=32 and j=21 lines and dust continuum , with a maximum resolution of @xmath11 .",
    "the resulting images unambiguously reveal the rotation of the disk around the star and constrain the disk inclination and size .",
    "the sma observations of tw hya were made between 2003 march and june using two configurations of five of the 6 meter diameter antennas at each of two frequencies ( 230 ghz and 345 ghz ) .",
    "these observations provided 17 independent baselines ranging in length from 16 to 120 meters .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] summarizes the observational parameters .",
    "the synthesized beam sizes were @xmath02@xmath1 at 345 ghz and @xmath04@xmath1 at 230 ghz with robust weighting .",
    "the sma digital correlator was configured with both a narrow band of 512 channels over 104 mhz , which provided 0.2 mhz frequency resolution , or 0.18 km  s@xmath6 velocity resolution at 345 ghz , and several broader bands that provided 656 mhz of bandwidth for continuum measurements .",
    "calibration of the visibility phases and amplitudes was achieved with observations of the quasar 3c273 , typically at intervals of 30 minutes .",
    "two weaker quasars closer to tw hya on the sky , 1058 + 015 and 1037 - 295 , were also observed to verify the effectiveness of phase referencing between 3c273 and tw hya .",
    "observations of callisto provided the absolute scale for the flux density calibration .",
    "the uncertainties in the flux scale are estimated to be 20% based on the scatter of the measurements on different days , which is due to the uncertainties in pointing models and system temperature measurements .",
    "the data were calibrated using the mir software package adapted for the sma from the idl version of the mma software package developed originally for ovro ( scoville et al . 1993 ) .",
    "the continuum emission from tw hya is strong enough for self - calibration , and an iteration of phase - only self - calibration was performed to improve the images by 20% .",
    "the nrao aips package was used to generate continuum and spectral line images , all of which were cleaned in the usual way .",
    "@xcite have developed a physically self - consistent irradiated accretion disk model for tw hya .",
    "this unique model requires a distinct transition in disk properties at a radius of @xmath124  au , likely due to a developing gap , and grains that have grown to sizes of @xmath12110 cm in order to match the full spectral energy distribution from optical to radio wavelengths .",
    "the calvet model is consistent with the radial brightness distribution of the disk observed at 43  ghz , where the dust emission has been resolved by the vla ( @xcite ) .",
    "the new sma continuum measurements agree well with previous single dish observations at these wavelengths , and the predictions of the calvet model . to compare the dust emission to the model radial brightness",
    ", we show in figure  [ fig : profile ] the visibility amplitudes at 345 ghz , annularly averaged in 20  k@xmath13 bins , with the model curve ( scaled by 0.9 , well within the uncertainties of the flux scale ) .",
    "the good match of the sma continuum measurements with previous data and the irradiated accretion disk model predictions gives confidence in the reliability of the submillimeter measurements , as well as the accuracy of the absolute flux scale .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows spectra of the co j=21 and j=32 line emission at the tw hya continuum peak .",
    "both lines are detected with high signal - to - noise ratios .",
    "the co emission from the disk is spatially resolved ; a circular gaussian fit to the co 32 integrated intensity map gives a fwhm size of @xmath14 .",
    "table  [ tab : obs ] lists the integrated intensities and results of gaussian fits to the central spectra . as indicated by @xcite and @xcite , co j=21 and co j=32 emission are expected to be highly optically thick in circumstellar disks .",
    "these lines are thus excellent probes of the outer disk velocity field but do not robustly trace the disk mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "further , the peak intensities should be tied to the kinetic temperatures of the regions of the disk where the lines become optically thick , and as tw hya appears almost face on , any differences in brightness may be related to vertical temperature gradients .    comparing the intensities of the two transitions within the same region ( here the co j=32 data set",
    "is convolved with the co j=21 beam ) , the peak brightness of the co j=32 line is @xmath15 k and that of the co j=21 line is @xmath16 k. figure  [ fig : tau ] shows the location of the @xmath17 surfaces for these co transitions calculated together with contours from the kinetic temperature model of calvet et al .",
    "( 2002 ) for three different depletion scenarios .",
    "all assume a constant depletion factor ( d@xmath18 ) of 10 .",
    "the top set is calculated with the constant d@xmath18 , the one below includes additional jump depletion ( d@xmath19 ) by a factor of 10 where the kinetic temperature falls below 22  k ( the critical temperature of co desorption , @xcite ) , and the bottom one includes d@xmath19 of 100 at that same temperature threshold . for the first case ,",
    "the temperature gradient probed by the two co lines is very small , as both transitions are formed at nearly the same location in the disk . in the case where d@xmath19 is 10 , however",
    ", the @xmath17 surfaces for both transitions show an abrupt change near 130150 au in radius and 2040 au in height . with an even larger d@xmath19 of 100",
    ", the co j=32 line becomes optically thick significantly deeper ( colder ) in the disk than does the co j=21 line in the region beyond 200 au where the temperature is very low .",
    "the t@xmath20 of co 32 is predicted to be smaller than that of co 21 in this case , which is not compatible with the sma spectra reported here .",
    "the observed difference in the brightness temperatures of the co lines in figure  [ fig : spectra ] must therefore arise from a combination of factors .",
    "the beam size for the co j=32 spectrum corresponds to @xmath0160@xmath21120 au ( fwhm ) , that for co j=21 is @xmath0260@xmath21150 au ( fwhm ) .",
    "both zones have a @xmath17 surface above 22 k , though the 21 data do sample colder regions where the @xmath17 surface drops to @xmath2220 k. the velocity - integrated intensities for the full disk in the two co lines are @xmath23 jy  km  s@xmath6 for co 32 and @xmath24 jy  km  s@xmath6 for co 21 , as compared to previous single dish observations of 36.6 jy  km  s@xmath6 for co 32 ( @xcite ) and 17.7 jy  km  s@xmath6 for co 21 ( @xcite ) .",
    "we regard these as consistent given the uncertainties in the flux scales of the various telescopes .",
    "the ratio of integrated intensities from the aggregate 345/230 ghz data sets is @xmath25 , consistent with the value of 2.25 expected if the lines were optically thick and tracing isothermal gas .",
    "as mentioned above , even with the same convolving beam the co j=32 emission remains brighter than that from co j=21 ( 21 k vs 15 k ) . figure  [",
    "fig : spectra ] shows that there is likely to be a small vertical temperature gradient to which these two transitions can be quite sensitive , e.g. for the case of an inclination angle of 7@xmath26 where co j=21 traces gas near @xmath015 k , while the more optically thick co j=32 emission arises from gas closer to the disk surface and therefore somewhat warmer ( @xmath018 k ) .",
    "given the likely flux uncertainties of the sma and single dish observations , it is difficult at present to quantify whether vertical temperature gradients in the disk or beam dilution dominate the observed difference in the brightness temperatures of the co lines shown in figure  [ fig : spectra ] .",
    "studies of additional co transitions and , especially , isotopically substituted variants could settle this issue definitively .",
    "figure  [ fig : cube ]  ( upper panels ) shows a set of velocity channel maps for 0.18 km  s@xmath6 intervals for co j=32 line .",
    "the main feature of interest is the position shift along a northwest - southeast axis at velocities that bracket the systemic velocity . in order to interpret these images in a quantitative way",
    ", we use a two - dimensional accelerated monte carlo model ( @xcite ) to calculate the radiative transfer and molecular excitation .",
    "we adopt the physical density and temperature structure derived by calvet et al .",
    "( 2002 ) , which does an excellent job reproducing the dust continuum emission , and produce a grid of models with a range of inclinations and various depletion scheme to simulate the disk as imaged by a telescope with the resolution constrained only by the grid sampling ( typically this is of order 5 - 10 au in the outer disk , or @xmath27 ) .",
    "simulated observations of the model disks were produced by the miriad software package using the uvmodel routine to select synthetic visibility observations at the observed @xmath28 spacings .",
    "these synthetic visibilities were then processed into images in a manner identical to the sma data for detailed comparisons ( more detailed explanations and a description of the model may be found in @xcite , for an application to lkca 15 see qi et al .",
    "2003 ) .",
    "the co data provide a strong constraint on the disk inclination @xmath29 , or more specifically sin @xmath29 .",
    "previous analyses of scattered light images ( @xcite ) indicated that tw hya and its disk are seen close to pole - on , but the inclination angle could not be well constrained .",
    "for the disk models used here , we fix the inner radius at 4 au and the outer radius at 196 au , and adopt keplerian rotation along with a low turbulent velocity of 0.05 km  s@xmath6 through comparison to the observed co j=32 and j=21 line profiles . indeed turbulent velocities in the outer disk also affect the line width , but values of @xmath300.1 km  s@xmath6 or larger can not reproduce the peanut - shaped morphology of the systemic velocity channel map while the line widths are essentially unchanged for turbulent velocities in the 0.050.1 km  s@xmath6 range .",
    "figure  [ fig : spectra ] shows the predictions for a range of inclination angles , which strongly impact the widths of the lines ; the best fit inclination is 7@xmath31 , which is slightly larger than the inclination angle of 4@xmath31 derived from the ellipticity of the infrared image of the disk around tw hya in scattered light ( @xcite ) where a circular disk is assumed .",
    "specifically , the predicted line widths change by 30% , from 0.72 to 1.06 km  s@xmath6 for co j=32 and from 0.6 - 0.85 km  s@xmath6 for co j=21 , as the inclination angles vary from 6 to 8 degrees .",
    "such significant line width variations with inclination angle ( by as little as 1 degree ) are expected when the disk is so close to pole - on because the locii of constant projected velocities is quite sensitivite to sin @xmath29  the error of which translates to a very tight limit on @xmath29 .",
    "an inclination angle of @xmath2 is thus a robust fit that is strongly constrained by the co line widths within the confines of the disk model employed . in general , the derived inclination angle can also be coupled to the size of the disk and the radial and vertical temperature gradients .",
    "the line intensity of co 32 is still much larger than the model prediction , suggesting that the near - surface gas temperature in the calvet model is somewhat too low .",
    "the line profiles are also not perfectly characterized as gaussian ( though they are very narrow ) , which we rely on for determining the line widths .",
    "each these systematic uncertainties could be larger than the uncertainty of the inclination angle ( 1 degree ) that we determine from the line widths , but can be constrained in the future by higher spatial resolution observations of additional co transitions and isotopologues .",
    "a comparison of the observed channel maps of co j=32 and synthetic maps generated by a detailed model with parameters listed in table  [ tab : model ] is shown in figure  [ fig : cube ] . while the model reproduces all of the major features observed , in particular the velocity gradient and peanut - shaped morphology of the central channel , the predicted co 32 intensities in figures  [ fig : spectra ]  and  [ fig : cube ]  are 40% smaller than observed .",
    "it is likely that vertical gas and dust temperature gradient difference is not quite captured by the sed - constrained disk models , which we will pursue further in a future paper .",
    "resolved observations of co isotopologues toward another t tauri star , dm tau , have been presented by @xcite , who used iram inteferometric data to constrain the depletion and temperature versus radius , as the less abundant species probe the inner part of the disk , within an lte excitation / radiative transfer model .",
    "such an approach is useful for molecules such as co that possess low critical densities , but as has been discussed by @xcite , lte excitation is not a good approximation for higher dipole moment species such as cn . with the 2d monte carlo model , the statistical nature of the molecular excitation",
    "can be investigated within the context of realistic models of the disk structure .",
    "chemical differentiation can therefore be constrained by resolved observations of multiple transitions of species with varying characteristics , and our future publications will thus include studies of other molecules , including cn and hcn , toward tw hya .",

    "we also thank p. dalessio and n. calvet for providing the disk model of tw hya and j.e .",
