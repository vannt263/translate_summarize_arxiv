    "the discovery of iron - based superconductors has opened a new path to explore unconventional mechanism of high - temperature superconductivity @xcite . the superconducting transition temperatures of iron - based superconductors are closely related to the height of anion from the fe - fe square lattice and the fe-(as / se)-fe angle @xcite .",
    "by intercalating atoms between fese layers to form @xmath5fe@xmath6se@xmath4 compounds ( @xmath7=k , tl , rb , or cs ) , one can effectively modulate the height of anion and raise the superconducting transition temperature of bulk fese from 8 k   @xcite to 27@xmath848 k   @xcite .",

    "it suggests that the difference in the magnetic orders between @xmath0-fe@xmath1se@xmath2 and k@xmath4fe@xmath1se@xmath2 results mainly from the doping effect introduced by the intercalated k atoms . furthermore , by doping 2 electrons per formula to @xmath0-fe@xmath1se@xmath2 , we find that the metallic @xmath16-blocked - checkerboard afm state becomes insulating , with an energy gap of 324 mev [ fig .

    "<S> this state is about 130 mev / fe lower in energy than the @xmath3-blocked - checkerboard afm one . </S>",
    "<S> electron doping can lower the energy of the @xmath3-blocked - checkerboard afm state and introduce a transition between these two states , suggesting that there is strong afm fluctuation in fese - based materials upon doping . </S>",
