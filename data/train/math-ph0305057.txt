    "given a planar graph @xmath2 all of whose faces ( except possibly for the outer face if @xmath2 is finite ) have degree @xmath0 , a * rhombic embedding * is an embedding of @xmath2 in @xmath3 with the property that all edges are line segments and have length @xmath1 ( and hence each bounded face is a rhombus ) .",
    "such embedding arise in discrete complex analysis @xcite and in statistical mechanics @xcite .",
    "here we study the spaces of such embeddings .",
    "our main results are the following .    1 .",
    "we give a simple necessary and sufficient condition ( theorem [ planar ] ) for a planar graph to have a rhombic embedding in @xmath3 .",
    "we show that the space of rhombic embeddings of an infinite graph ( with no unbounded faces ) is a convex set when parametrized by the rhombus angles .",
    "there is a simple description of the extreme points of the closure of this convex set .",
    "( section [ convex ] and theorem [ extremepts ] . ) 3 .",
    "we consider the space of periodic rhombic embeddings of a periodic planar graph .",
    "it is the interior of a convex polyhedron .",
    "the area of the fundamental domain provides a strictly convex functional on this polyhedron ; we give a geometric description of the unique critical point ( theorem [ maxarea ] ) .",
    "rhombic embeddings first appeared in duffin @xcite , in the context of discrete complex analysis . indeed , as duffin shows , there is a natural way to define discrete analytic functions on graphs with rhombic embeddings , which does not appear to generalize to arbitrary embeddings .",
    "duffin s ideas were rediscovered by mercat @xcite who used them to build up an extended theory of discrete holomorphy in one complex dimension .    in @xcite , the closely related concept of * isoradial embeddings * ( see the next section ) was shown to be useful in the study of the so - called dimer model of statistical mechanics . by choosing edge interactions to be a particular function of the corresponding edge lengths in the isoradial embedding , certain simplifications ( commutation relations ) appear which do not appear for more general energies .",
    "these allow one to give explicit solutions to correlation functions in the dimer model on isoradial graphs .",
    "other statistical mechanical models such as the ising model and more generally the random cluster model also become simpler on isoradial graphs @xcite .",
    "in fact , even the simple random walk behaves nicely , as is evidenced by an explicit formula for the green s function @xcite .",
    "an * isoradial embedding * ( see @xcite ) of a planar graph @xmath2 is a locally finite embedding in @xmath3 with the property that each bounded face @xmath4 is a cyclic polygon ( inscribable in a circle ) with circumcircle of radius @xmath1 .",
    "the center of the circumcircle @xmath5 is also called the center of @xmath4 .",
    "the embedding is said to be * convex * if the center of a face is contained in the closure of the face .",
    "it is * strictly convex * if the center is in the interior of the face .    given a planar graph @xmath2 , the * diamond graph * @xmath6 associated to @xmath2 is the graph whose vertices are the union of the vertices and faces of @xmath2 , and with an edge between each face and vertex on that face .",
    "the faces of @xmath6 are the edges of @xmath2 .",
    "the faces of @xmath6 are of degree @xmath0 .",
    "it is clear that a strictly convex isoradial embedding of a graph @xmath2 gives a rhombic embedding of @xmath6 .",
    "conversely , a rhombic embedding of @xmath6 defines a strictly convex isoradial embedding of @xmath2 .",
    "furthermore every planar graph with faces of degree @xmath0 arises as the diamond graph of another planar graph .",
    "so the study of strictly convex isoradial embeddings and rhombic embeddings is equivalent .",
    "in this paper a planar graph will mean a graph with a preferred isotopy class of embeddings in the plane .",
    "an embedding of such a graph will always mean an embedding in the same isotopy class .",
    "we will only deal with either finite graphs , all of whose faces except the outer face have degree @xmath0 , or with infinite graphs with no unbounded faces , that is , all of whose faces have degree @xmath0 . in either case",
    "we refer to such graphs as * graphs with faces of degree @xmath0 * , with the understanding that we exclude the outer face from this restriction in the case of a finite graph .",
    "although the results in this section apply in greater generality , for simplicity we deal only with these cases .    in a planar graph @xmath2 with faces of degree four ,",
    "a * train track * is a path of faces ( each face being adjacent along an edge to the previous face ) which does not turn : on entering a face it exits across the opposite edge .",
    "we assume that the train tracks extend in both directions as far as possible , that is , they are not embedded in a longer train track .",
    "this means they are either periodic , or extend infinitely far in both directions , or extend until they enter the outer face of @xmath2 if @xmath2 is finite .",

    "in a rhombic embedding , each rhombus in a train track has an edge parallel to a fixed unit vector @xmath8 . in an oriented train track",
    "we choose the direction of @xmath8 so that when the train runs down the track @xmath8 points from the right to the left .",
    "the vector @xmath8 is called the * transversal * of the oriented train track .",

    "the conditions are clearly necessary : in a rhombic embedding each train track is a monotone path ( in the direction perpendicular to its common parallel ) .",
    "therefore a train track can not cross itself .",
    "if two oriented train tracks with transversals @xmath8 and @xmath9 cross ( with the first crossing from right to the left of the second ) , the rhombus on which they cross has edges @xmath8 and @xmath9 and @xmath10 ; if they crossed again the first would cross from the left to the right of the second and the rhombus would have the same two edges but in the reverse orientation , that is , it would have negative area .    it remains to construct a rhombic embedding for any graph satisfying the conditions .",
