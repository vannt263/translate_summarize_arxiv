    "living cells are essentially very complex membranes surrounding equally complex solutions of , predominantly , protein molecules . these solutions are arguably the most complex liquids we know of",
    ". this article will begin with some of the basic questions we can ask about these complex liquids , together with some partial answers .",
    "then we will look at two phenomena in the cytoplasm that are particularly suited to study by physical scientists : diffusion and phase behaviour .",
    "below there is a section on each , and we will end with a brief conclusion . in the following section we will look at two aspects of diffusion in the crowded environment of the cell .",
    "the first is the need to estimate the slow down due to the high density of protein present .",
    "the second aspect is cytoplasmic diffusion as a process that has been optimised by evolution .",
    "if say the rate of diffusion is limiting the speed of response of the cell to a change in the environment then there is natural selection pressure on the proteins to evolve to diffuse faster .",
    "section [ sec_phasesep ] will discuss how we can understand and even calculate some aspects of the phase behaviour of models of the cytoplasm , even in the absence of hard data on even one of the millions of interactions that occur in the cytoplasm . in the remainder of this introduction",
    "we will consider some of the basic questions we can ask about the cytoplasm .",
    "_ what is in it ?",
    "_ a concentrated solution of macromolecules , predominantly protein , but also rna and in the case of prokaryotes one or a few huge dna molecules .",
    "proteins are heteropolymers , they are linear chains of amino acids that are typically folded up into a compact , relatively rigid native state that is in many ways more like a colloid than a conventional polymer .",
    "prokaryote cells are much simpler than those of eukaryotes .",
    "prokaryotes are ( relatively ) simple organisms such as bacteria , e.g. , _",
    "e.  coli_. their cells contain only one compartment that contains the dna , the proteins , the ribosomes where new proteins are made etc .",
    "see any molecular biology textbook , for example that of alberts _ et al .",
    "eukaryote cells are larger and compartmentalised , in particular the dna is in a membrane - bound compartment called the nucleus , not in the cytoplasm . some eukaryotes are single - celled organisms , e.g. , yeast , but all complex multicellular organisms , e.g. , _",
    "h.  sapiens _ , are eukaryotes .",
    "eukaryote cells have a complex skeleton of filaments of protein @xcite and not all of the protein diffuses freely in the cytoplasm @xcite .",
    "we will not discuss this further here but it should be borne in mind that the description of the cytoplasm as a liquid mixture may be a better approximation in prokaryotes than in eukaryotes .",
    "see @xcite for a review of the properties of the eukaryote cytoplasm .",
    "returning to prokaryotes , an inventory of the protein , rna and dna in _",
    "e.  coli _ is given in table [ t1 ] .",
    "for their net electrostatic charges see @xcite . the bacterium _",
    "e.  coli _ has been extensively studied and much is known about it @xcite .",
    "the macromolecules occupy around 30% to 40% of the volume inside the cell .",
    "of course it is well known that at these concentrations the interactions between the molecules are both strong and important .",
    ".the protein , rna and dna in the cytosol of _",
    "e. coli _ @xcite . for each class of macromolecule ,",
    "the columns indicate the orders of magnitude of , from left to right : the volume of a single molecule of this class , the number of different types of molecule in this class , the total number of molecules in the cytoplasm of a cell , and the volume fraction occupied by molecules of this class .",
    "the cytoplasm has a volume of order 1@xmath0m@xmath1 .",
    "ribosomes are large complexes of protein and rna .",
    "they are the cell s protein factories .",
    "trna molecules are relatively small rna molecules that hold an amino acid in readiness for it to be added to the growing chain of amino acids that is being synthesised at a ribosome .",
    "[ t1 ] [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     _ what does it do ? _",
    "living organisms consume energy , grow , move etc .",
    "the cytoplasm is where most of the energy is consumed and most of the functions necessary to grow etc are performed .",
    "the cytoplasm also computes : it receives and integrates signals from the environment and changes the functions performed accordingly .",
    "for example , if the environment of _",
    "e.  coli _ contains the sugar lactose but not glucose then a signal is transmitted within the cytoplasm and the synthesis of the enzymes needed to metabolise this sugar is switched on @xcite .    _",
    "how does it compute responses , copy dna etc ? _ this is a large question , indeed essentially all of cell biology is concerned with answering this question .",
    "liquids physicists perhaps have most to contribute to processes that either involve transport , such as diffusion , or the underlying equilibrium behaviour of the mixture of complex molecules that forms the cytoplasm .",
    "thus we will focus on diffusion in section [ sec_diff ] and phase behaviour in section [ sec_phasesep ] .",
    "as a first example , let us consider diffusion .",
    "this is essential to transmit signals across the cytoplasm , for reactants to collide and so on .",
    "we want to understand diffusion _ in vivo _",
    ", i.e. , in the cytoplasm , and to do so we will compare diffusion _ in vivo _ with diffusion _ in vitro _ , by which we mean diffusion in the typically very dilute solutions that biochemists study .",
    "these solutions are so dilute that they can be treated as an ideal gas .",
    "the properties of the cytoplasm have been optimised by almost four billion years of evolution .",
    "thus one approach to understanding the cytoplasm is to consider how it can be optimised .",
    "see for example the work of bialek @xcite for elegant examples of this approach . if we consider diffusion - limited reactions between a pair of proteins @xmath2 and @xmath3 , then the reaction rate is @xcite @xmath4 for @xmath5 molecules of protein @xmath2 , and @xmath6 molecules of protein @xmath3 uniformly distributed within a cytoplasm of volume @xmath7 .",
    "the reaction constant @xmath8 , where @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the diffusion constant and the linear dimension of the volume within which the reaction occurs , respectively @xcite .",
    "thus the reaction rate per @xmath5 molecule is proportional to @xmath11 .    for the sake of argument , let us guess that the total volume of the cytoplasm @xmath7 is is determined by the need to maximise reaction rates such as that of equation ( [ cytoreac ] ) .",
    "bacteria are under strong natural selection pressure to be able to grow rapidly and if reactions like that of equation ( [ cytoreac ] ) limit this rate then there will be selection pressure to speed up the reaction . at fixed numbers of proteins varying the volume fraction of protein",
    "@xmath12 is equivalent to varying the volume @xmath7 .",
    "thus , we will search for the value of @xmath12 that maximises reaction rates .",
    "now , the reaction rate per @xmath2 molecule depends on @xmath12 in two ways : i ) @xmath13 , the denser the cytoplasm the higher the density of @xmath3 molecules , and ii ) through the reaction constant @xmath14 , which depends on the density - dependent diffusion constant .",
    "thus , the reaction rate per @xmath2 molecule is proportional to @xmath15 and _ if _ the density of the cytoplasm is set by the requirement to maximise the reaction rate of diffusion - limited reactions then we expect to find cells with a volume fraction @xmath12 that maximises @xmath15 .",
    "clearly , many other things are going on in a cell that need to be optimised other than the rate of diffusion but let us persevere with our naive assumption .",
    "we do not know the density dependence of the self - diffusion constant in the cytoplasm , although elowitz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have measured the diffusion constant for a small protein in _",
    "e.  coli_.",
    "so , we resort to the standard , but drastic physicists approximation of treating proteins as hard spheres . a reasonable approximation to the long - time self - diffusion",
    "constant of colloidal hard spheres is given by @xcite @xmath16 where @xmath17 is the stokes - einstein expression for the diffusion constant for a colloidal particle at infinite dilution .",
    "@xmath18 is the thermal energy , @xmath19 is the viscosity of the solvent , here a salt solution , and @xmath20 is the radius of the colloidal particle . equation ( [ diff ] ) is based on earlier work by medina - noyola @xcite . using equation ( [ diff ] ) for @xmath21 , we find that the @xmath15 is maximal at @xmath22 , rather lower than that found inside cells .",
    "also , at this volume fraction the self - diffusion constant is @xmath23 of its value at infinite dilution whereas the measurements of elowitz _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite put the diffusion constant of a protein called green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) , in _",
    "e.  coli _ at approximately @xmath24 of its value in a dilute solution .",
    "thus our very naive assumption that the cytoplasm is effectively a hard - sphere suspension optimised for the reaction rate between pairs of proteins is not consistent with the experimental data .",
    "however , note that equation ( [ diff ] ) predicts that at volume fractions @xmath25 and @xmath26 the self - diffusion constant is @xmath27 and @xmath28 times its value at infinite dilution , respectively .",
    "thus , given the density of the cytoplasm the speed of diffusion in the cytoplasm , at least of some relatively small proteins , is similar to that in a hard - sphere suspension with the same volume fraction . in summary , it is possible that the proteins are mostly not very sticky and so on average the interactions are not far from simple hard - sphere - like repulsions , but the density of the cytoplasm appears to be too high to be the result of selection for the maximum collision rate between proteins .",
    "the dense protein solution that is the _ in vivo _ environment will affect not only the rate at which a pair of proteins come together but also the rate at which a dimer will break apart  we expect the push of the other molecules will make it harder for the proteins of a dimer to move away from each other . to study this effect let us consider that when proteins @xmath2 and @xmath3 collide and react , with a rate given by equation ( [ cytoreac ] ) , they form a dimer that then persists for some time before dissociating .",
    "then there will be an an equilibrium between @xmath2 and @xmath3 monomers and @xmath29 dimers , @xmath30 with forward and back rate constants @xmath31 and @xmath32 , respectively .",
    "we will study the effect of the _ in vivo _",
    "environment by comparing dimer formation there with dimer formation in a dilute solution _ in vitro_. the _ in vitro _",
    "situation is taken to be a typical experimental situation where the proteins are so dilute that they are an associating ideal gas .",
    "see @xcite for the theory of associating ideal gases and for association in dense liquids .",
    "now , let us consider proteins @xmath2 and @xmath3 that each exist as 100 copies in a cytoplasm of volume @xmath33m@xmath1 .",
    "thus the total number densities of @xmath2 and @xmath3 , @xmath34nm@xmath35 .",
    "@xmath36 , @xmath37 and @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the number of @xmath29 dimers in the cytoplasm . in order to have comparable amounts of the dimer and the free @xmath2 and @xmath3 proteins _ in vivo _ we set the dissociation constant in the cytoplasm @xmath40nm@xmath35 .",
    "note that the dissociation constant is , by definition , one over the equilibrium constant , @xmath41 .",
    "assuming as above that the interactions can be modelled by hard core interactions , and setting the hard - sphere volume fraction @xmath42 , then the dissociation constant _ in vitro _ is given by @xcite @xmath43 where @xmath44 is the pair distribution function at contact . using the carnahan - starling @xcite equation , @xmath45 .",
    "then we obtain @xmath46nm@xmath35 .",
    "we are assuming that the dimer consists of a pair of touching hard spheres , as in @xcite .",
    "equation ( [ kdr ] ) follows directly from the definition of the pair distribution function .",
    "the pair distribution function is the ratio of the actual probability of finding a pair at a given separation to the probability of finding a pair at that separation in the absence of interactions , i.e. , in an ideal gas .",
    "see @xcite for the use of pair distribution functions in obtaining the density dependence of monomer - dimer equilibria .",
    "we use @xmath47 with @xmath48 nm for the rate constant for the forward reaction _ in vitro _ and @xmath49 _ in vivo_. taking @xmath50k and @xmath51pa  s for water , then using the stokes - einstein expression the diffusion constant for a protein with diameter 5 nm is @xmath52m@xmath53s@xmath54 . in the cytoplasm , @xmath55m@xmath53s@xmath54 .",
    "these values are similar to those for the protein gfp , whose _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ diffusion constants are @xmath56m@xmath53s@xmath54 @xcite and @xmath57m@xmath53s@xmath54 @xcite , respectively . as @xmath58 , then once we have specified both the rate constant for the forward reaction and the dissociation constant we have the rate constant for the back reaction @xcite . here",
    "the rate constants for the back reaction , @xmath32 , are @xmath59s@xmath54 _ in vivo _ and @xmath60s@xmath54 _ in vitro_.    it is straightforward to obtain the concentrations @xmath61 , @xmath62 and @xmath63 as functions of time _ in vivo _ and _ in vitro _ , by in each case solving the equations @xmath64 after setting the initial conditions .",
    "we use the initial condition that the density of @xmath29 dimers is zero .",
    "the solutions to equations ( [ ode1 ] ) and ( [ ode2 ] ) are plotted in figure [ figreac ] .",
    "the reaction in the cytoplasm takes around 4s to reach an equilibrium of equal numbers of monomers and dimers , while the reaction in dilute solution takes around @xmath27s to reach an equilibrium in which there are two and a half times as many monomers as dimers .",
    "thus although the behaviour is qualitatively the same in both cases , quantitatively there is a large difference .",
    "of course , we have assumed that the interactions are hard - sphere like , attractions will alter the picture .",
    "the dissociation constant _ in vitro",
    "_ is a factor of @xmath65 larger than _ in vivo _ , which means that taking the proteins @xmath2 and @xmath3 out of the _ in vivo _ environment and putting them in a dilute solution will significantly reduce the number of dimers formed .",
    "the factor of @xmath66 is for a pair of proteins @xmath2 and @xmath3 of sizes comparable to the average size of the proteins whose crowding is pushing them together .",
    "the dissociation constant _ in vitro _ will be increased by larger factors if the two species are larger than typical proteins .",
    "thus , processes that involve the assembly of large complexes should be especially strongly affected by removal from the _ in vivo _ environment .",
    "the copying of dna is one such process , it is done by the cooperative action of a complex of a number of proteins that bind to the double helix of dna .",
    "studies of the copying of dna @xcite found that it was impossible to initiate the copying process _ in vitro _ unless a concentrated solution of the water - soluble polymer polyethylene glycol was added to compensate for the lack of the concentrated solution of other proteins found _ in vivo _",
    "this prompted kornberg to make compensating in _ in vitro _",
    "systems for the effect of taking the system being studied out of its _ in vivo _",
    "home one of his ten commandments of biochemistry .",
    "minton has written or cowritten a number of reviews on the effect of the crowded environment _ in vivo _ @xcite .",
    "the cytoplasm of all but exceptional cells seems to be highly stable with respect to phase transitions such as demixing or crystallisation .",
    "bacteria such as _ e.  coli _ can survive rather large changes in the physical properties of their environment , such as its osmotic pressure @xcite , without the cytoplasm becoming thermodynamically unstable .",
    "phase - transition phenomena have been observed in the cells that make up the lens of the eye @xcite but these cells are exceptional .",
    "they are inert and the cytoplasm is predominantly composed of families of proteins called the @xmath67 , @xmath68 and @xmath69-crystallins @xcite .",
    "this is very different from the composition of table [ t1 ] .",
    "phase transitions in lens cells have been studied extensively as they are implicated in the formation of cataracts .",
    "we do not know why phase separation occurs in exceptional cells such as those in the lens of the eye but does not seem to occur in prokaryote cells or normal human cells .",
    "however , here we will briefly consider a speculative explanation for the lack of attractive protein - protein interactions that could cause separation into protein - rich and protein - poor phases , and also a possible explanation for the lack of demixing into phases with different protein compositions .",
    "note also that the selection pressure acts on proteins in their natural habitat : the cytoplasm , but affects their _ in vitro _ properties .",
    "for example , doye _ et al .",
    "_ @xcite have speculated that proteins may be under significant selection pressure not to crystallise and that this may contribute to the difficulty protein crystallographers have in crystallising proteins .",
    "our first speculation is that the stability of the cytoplasm is a byproduct of selection for another property .",
    "this property may be diffusion in the cytoplasm .",
    "we have already considered diffusion and the rates of diffusion - limited reactions and found that at least for some small proteins the measured diffusion @xcite is consistent with hard - sphere - like interactions . clearly , if many protein - protein interactions have been selected to be hard - sphere - like in order to speed the diffusion of the protein molecules then this will as a byproduct select against separation into protein - rich and protein - poor phases as the attractions required for this form of phase transition will be selected against .",
    "the second speculation is that a demixing phase transition , i.e. , phase separation into two phases with similar total protein concentrations but different compositions , is suppressed by the central - limit theorem of statistics .",
    "phase transitions are driven by interactions and so to understand how this might come about we need to consider the effect of interactions on the thermodynamic functions of the mixture . at the simplest level",
    "the interactions affect these functions via the second virial coefficients . at the second - virial - coefficient level the excess chemical potential of component @xmath70 of an @xmath71 component mixture is @xmath72 where @xmath73 is",
    "the second virial coefficient for the interaction between components @xmath70 and @xmath74 , and @xmath75 is the number density of component @xmath74 .",
    "in earlier work cuesta and the author assumed that the second virial coefficients @xmath73 were independent random variables @xcite .",
    "their arguments for taking this apparently rather radical step were as follows .",
    "firstly , the cytoplasm may contain thousands of proteins and hence even at the level of the second - virial coefficients requires millions of coefficients to describe the interactions .",
    "we know none of these virial coefficients and so have no choice but to guess them .",
    "secondly , work by nuclear physicists on the spectra of complex nuclei has shown that by guessing the elements of the hamiltonian matrix of the nuclei , some experimental observations can be reproduced , see for example @xcite .",
    "inspired by this work sear and cuesta replaced the matrix of second virial coefficients by a random matrix .",
    "having assumed not only that the @xmath73 are random variables but that they are independent , we can easily obtain the probability distribution function of the excess chemical potential @xmath76 .",
    "we denote the mean and standard deviation of the @xmath73 by @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively .",
    "then the central limit theorem tells us @xcite that in the large @xmath71 limit , the probability distribution function for the excess chemical potential of a component in the mixture is the gaussian @xmath79 \\label{pdf}\\ ] ] with mean @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the total density , and a standard deviation given by @xmath82 .",
    "note that once the second virial coefficients are assumed to be random variables , the excess chemical potential is also a random variable , and so a probability distribution function is the appropriate description .",
    "as the number of components @xmath71 increases at fixed total density @xmath81 , the individual densities must scale as @xmath83 , and so the variance @xmath84 will also scale as @xmath83  it tends to zero .",
    "thus , as the width of the probability distribution for the excess chemical potentials is tending to zero as @xmath85 , the excess chemical potentials of all components tend to the same value .",
    "then , the effect of the interactions on the chemical potentials of all components are the same and so the mixture behaves as a single component system in so far as the interactions are concerned .",
    "this of course rules out demixing into phases that have the same total concentration of protein but different compositions .",
    "in addition , if indeed the @xmath73 can be modelled by random variables and the correlations between them are weak it suggests that the differences between the excess chemical potentials of a given protein in the cytoplasms of different prokaryotes , for example in _",
    "e.  coli _ and in _",
    "m.  tuberculosis _ , may be small .",
    "although the proteins in the different species may differ in many ways , the sum of the effects of these differences is small as the individual effects tend to average out .    in the previous section",
    ", we noted that the volume fraction of macromolecules in the cytoplasm was around @xmath42 , which is too high for a virial expansion truncated after the second - virial coefficient terms to be a good description of the free energy .",
    "however , our result that the excess chemical potentials of the components should become increasingly similar as @xmath71 increases is not restricted to the second - virial - coefficient approximation .",
    "let us consider the situation where the excess chemical potential of the @xmath70th component is given not by equation ( [ muxi ] ) but by the more general expression @xmath86 where the @xmath87 and @xmath88 control the component - dependent contributions to the excess chemical potential and are independent random variables like the @xmath73 , and @xmath89 is some function of volume fraction which accounts for component - independent contributions such as excluded volume .",
    "for large @xmath71 , equation ( [ muxi2 ] ) gives a probability - distribution function for the excess chemical potential with the same form as equation ( [ pdf ] ) , and with a standard deviation whose largest term for large @xmath71 also scales as @xmath90 .",
    "thus , a whole class of mixtures in which the interactions between components @xmath70 and @xmath74 can be modelled by independent random variables , behave as single - component mixtures in the large @xmath71 limit .",
    "this finding is in no way restricted to the small volume fractions at which the second - virial - coefficient approximation is accurate .",
    "the above arguments against demixing are only indicative , a careful analysis of demixing in mixtures with virial coefficients that are independent random variables is in @xcite .",
    "the arguments rely on the assumption that the @xmath73 are _ independent _ random variables",
    ". correlations between a specific property of a protein , namely its size , and its interactions were considered by braun _",
    "@xcite using the theory of polydisperse mixtures ( reviewed in @xcite ) .",
    "they considered , as a model of the mixture of proteins inside cells , a mixture of spherical particles with a stickiness between proteins with @xmath91 and @xmath92 amino acids that scales as @xmath93 , i.e. , the contribution of the stickiness to the second virial coefficient scaled with the sum of the surface areas of the interacting proteins .",
    "this is reasonable if the surfaces of proteins differ weakly from one protein to another , and the attractive interaction when these surfaces approach each other is indeed a sticky interaction , i.e. , has a range that is small in comparison to the diameter of the proteins .",
    "used both genome data for the numbers of amino acids in all the proteins for a number of organisms , and experimental proteomics data for a bacterium that infects salmon , and found that with this model the width of the distribution in virial coefficients due to the distribution of protein lengths was far too small to induce demixing @xcite .",
    "proteomics is the study of the complete set of proteins of an organism .",
    "the finding that , for a simple model , the systematic variation of protein - protein interactions with a property of the proteins , here size , has little effect , broadly supports the use of uncorrelated random variables to represent the virial coefficients .",
    "the solutions inside living cells are perhaps the most complex liquids on earth .",
    "they contain thousands of complex components and they are non - equilibrium systems .",
    "this complexity is daunting but as we have seen in the previous section , a statistical approach can be used to make progress .",
    "such an approach can be used to model the effect of the interactions in the crowded cytoplasm on any property , for example the rate of protein unfolding @xcite .",
    "the very high density of macromolecules in the cytoplasm means that virtually all processes that occur there will be significantly affected by interactions .",
    "of course most of both the experimental and theoretical studies of liquids are aimed at understanding the effects of interactions .",
    "so liquid - matter scientists are ideally placed to contribute to attempts to understand the behaviour in the cytoplasm , in particular to attempts to understand the differences between _ in vitro _ and _ in vivo _ behaviour as these are similar to the differences between ideal gases and dense liquids @xcite .",
    "finally , in addition to the inevitable interactions due to the crowded nature of the cytoplasm there are many interactions that are essential to the function of the cell .",
    "for example , the receptors _",
    "e.  coli _ cells use to detect nutrient molecules in their environment interact with each other so as to make their response cooperative , this has been modelled using a ising - like model near a phase transition @xcite .",
    "these receptors are embedded in the cell membrane not in the cytoplasm but similar interactions may be employed to produce cooperative phenomena in the cytoplasm .",
    "i would like to thank the organisers of the 6th liquid matter conference for the invitation to speak and to contribute this article to the proceedings .",
    "it is also a pleasure to acknowledge invaluable discussions with j cuesta and d frenkel , and to acknowledge that section [ sec_phasesep ] describes work done in collaboration with n braun , j cuesta and p warren .",
