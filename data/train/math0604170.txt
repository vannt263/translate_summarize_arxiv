    "the ( type @xmath0 ) peterson variety is a remarkable @xmath3-dimensional projective subvariety of the full flag variety @xmath4 used by dale peterson to construct all of the small quantum cohomology rings of the partial flag varieties @xmath5 .",
    "this paper has two aims : firstly to relate the mirror symmetry constructions of givental @xcite and batyrev , ciocan - fontanine , kim , and van straten @xcite to the peterson variety , and secondly to use these constructions to describe the totally nonnegative part of the peterson variety .",
    "the mirror constructions of @xcite and @xcite provide in the full flag variety case , and provide conjecturally in the partial flag variety case , a set of solutions to the quantum cohomology @xmath6-module  a system of differential equations introduced by givental whose total symbols recover relations of the small quantum cohomology ring @xcite  in terms of oscillating integrals along families of cycles lying in a ` mirror family ' .",
    "these mirror families are @xmath7-dimensional families @xmath8 of affine varieties of the same dimension as @xmath9 which are defined in terms of an associated graph , see figure  [ f : graph ] , and which come with natural volume forms on the fibers and a phase function @xmath10 . here",
    "if the mirror conjecture holds then critical points of the phase function @xmath12 along individual mirrors should relate to elements in the spectrum of the quantum cohomology ring , where fixing a variety in the mirror family corresponds to fixing the values of the quantum parameters @xmath13 in @xmath14 .    in dale peterson s theory",
    "the spectrum of @xmath15 is precisely a stratum @xmath16 of the peterson variety @xmath2 . in this paper",
    "we compare peterson s @xmath16 with the variety @xmath17 swept out by the critical points of @xmath12 along the fibers of the mirror family @xmath18 from @xcite . as it turns out @xmath17 recovers the parts of the peterson variety that lie in certain deodhar strata ( a finer decomposition of the flag variety than the bruhat decomposition ) .",
    "if @xmath19 then this includes an open dense subset of @xmath20 .",
    "but in the case @xmath21 , the variety @xmath16 can have entire irreducible components which lie in the ` wrong ' deodhar stratum and hence are not seen by @xmath18 .",
    "this phenomenon is demonstrated explicitly in section  [ s : gr2(4 ) ] for @xmath22 .    in this special case , @xmath23",
    ", an earlier mirror construction consistent with the ` gbcks ' mirror construction from @xcite was given by eguchi , hori and xiong in ( * ? ? ?",
    "* appendix b ) , see @xcite .",
    "its deficiency with regard to recovering the quantum cohomology ring was observed also in @xcite , where it was fixed in an ad hoc way by a partial compactification . for a ` fix ' of the gbcks construction for general @xmath9 we refer to our sequel paper @xcite .",
    "it has not been checked how in the case of @xmath24 the general construction of @xcite relates to the ad hoc construction from @xcite .",
    "next we turn our attention to total positivity .",
    "the totally nonnegative part @xmath25 of the flag variety was defined by lusztig  @xcite as an extension of the classical theory of total positivity for matrices .",
    "it is a semi - algebraic subset inside the real flag variety @xmath26 ( which we view with its hausdorff topology ) .",
    "in @xcite we showed that the totally positive part of @xmath16 ( that is , the open interior of @xmath27 ) agrees with the subset of @xmath16 where all of the schubert classes take positive real values . using this result",
    "it was then proved that the quantum parameters restrict to give a homeomorphism @xmath28 where @xmath29 , making @xmath30 a cell .    in section  [ s : totpos ]",
    "we use the mirror constructions from the previous sections to give a direct new proof of the above parameterization .",
    "in fact we can extend the result to the boundary to get a homeomorphism , @xmath31 parameterizing the totally nonnegative part of @xmath16 .",
    "therefore we obtain a cell decomposition of the whole totally nonnegative part of the peterson variety @xmath2 . this mirror symmetric approach to proving the cell decomposition",
    "has the advantage of being completely elementary , whereas the proof in @xcite relied on positivity of the structure constants of the quantum cohomology rings involved ( the 3-point genus zero gromov - witten invariants for @xmath5 ) . on the other hand ,",
    "though , we obtain no results about positivity of schubert classes using only the mirror construction .",
    "finally , it is shown that the totally nonnegative part @xmath32 of the peterson variety is contractible .",
    "we conjecture that @xmath32 , as a cell decomposed space , is homeomorphic to an @xmath3-dimensional cube .",
    "the interpretation of the gbcks mirror construction and resulting proof of the cell decomposition of the totally nonnegative part of the peterson variety @xmath2 presented here date back to 2002 , and were presented at the erwin schroedinger institute in january of 2003 as well as alluded to in a footnote in @xcite . in the full flag variety case a similar interpretation ( but very different application ) of givental s mirror coordinates has since appeared also in the interesting work of gerasimov , kharchev , lebedev and oblezin @xcite on the quantum toda lattice . _ acknowledgements  :",
