    "from an observational standpoint , cosmology seems to be in a rather good shape . with several independent cosmological tests at hand the so - called standard model of cosmology",

    "today cosmology is based on observations related to the global expansion of the universe , the cosmic microwave background , primordial nucleosynthesis , and the formation of structure in the universe . from a theoretical standpoint the standard cosmological model relies on the theory of general relativity or , to be more precise , on a homogeneous and isotropic model , the so - called flrw model ( named after friedmann , lematre , robertson , and walker ) . while one of the main benefits of the flrw model is given by its simplicity",
    ", recent observations of type ia supernovae @xcite made clear that we know little about the dominating energy density component of the universe , which enters the general relativistic description in the form of a cosmological constant and is nowadays termed dark energy .",
    "several mechanisms have been proposed during the last years in order to remove the need for the usual cosmological constant . among them",
    "are evolving scalar fields @xcite , a time varying cosmological `` constant '' @xcite , @xmath1-essence @xcite , a phantom energy @xcite , the chaplygin gas @xcite , a modification of the flrw equation termed `` cardassian expansion '' @xcite , and the embedding of our universe in a higher dimensional bulk spacetime @xcite .",
    "in @xcite we constrained the parameters of a non - standard cosmological model with the help of recent sn ia data sets of @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the model investigated therein is based on a non - riemannian spacetime , the so - called weyl - cartan spacetime , and was analyzed by several groups during the last few years @xcite . for an overview of the developments in non - riemannian cosmology see @xcite .",
    "our main aim in @xcite was to place an upper limit on the new density parameter @xmath0 using the latest sne data .",
    "this parameter is linked to the presence of non - riemannian field strengths which might play an important role with respect to the observed accelerated expansion of the universe . in this work",
    "we pin down the parameters of our model by means of the recently released fr iib radio galaxy data set of @xcite and the data on x - ray gas mass fractions in clusters as provided in @xcite .",

    "the fr iib radio galaxy data set of @xcite contains eight data points with @xmath4 and thereby significantly enhances the available sample at high redshifts .",
    "apart from the enhanced redshift range coverage the fr iib radio galaxies provide an independent cosmological test since one deals with different objects . to clearly separate the parameter estimates from fr iib galaxies and",
    "sn ia we do _ not _ use a combined set in our fitting procedure .",
    "one of tasks in this paper is to determine if the cosmological parameters extracted from the fr iib data set are compatible with the results from the sn ia obtained in @xcite . the same arguments , apart from the coverage of high redshifts , also hold for the x - ray gas mass fraction measurements in clusters @xcite .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows . in section [ field_eq_in_ext_model_section ]",

    "<S> we use recent measurements of the dimensionless coordinate distances from fanaroff - riley type iib radio galaxies and the x - ray gas mass fractions in clusters to constrain the parameters of a non - standard cosmological model . </S>",
    "<S> this work complements our recent analysis of the sn ia data within a non - riemannian cosmological model . </S>",
    "<S> we use two independent data sets to constrain the new density parameter @xmath0 , which is related to the non - riemannian structure of the underlying spacetime and supplements the field equations that are very similar to the usual friedmann equations of general relativity . </S>",
    "<S> thereby we place an upper limit on the presence of non - riemannian quantities in the late stages of the universe . </S>",
    "<S> the numerical results of this work also apply to several anisotropic cosmological models which , on the level of the field equations , exhibit a similar scaling behavior of the density parameters like our non - riemannian model . </S>"
