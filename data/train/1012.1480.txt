    "the idea that our universe can be realized inside a domain wall embedded in a ( 4,1)-dimensional world @xcite has provided many creative ways to solve the hierarchy of interactions problem @xcite - randall1 and the cosmological constant problem @xcite in worlds with large extra dimension , without resorting to the compactification of the extra dimension .",
    "it has also been shown @xcite that the effective gravitational potential between two particles recovers the newtonian behavior , since one has localization of gravitons on a thin brane in five - dimensional space - time with a warped geometry and the cosmological constant is related to the brane tension .",
    "localization of matter ( spin - zero , spin-1/2 and spin-3/2 ) in the randall - sundrun framework was shown to be possible , under certain conditions over the brane tension @xcite . the localization of spin 1/2 fermions on thin branes is due to a soliton , _ via _ the mechanism created by jackiw and rebbi @xcite to demonstrate the phenomenon of fermion charge fractionization . by its turn , the domain wall which we would live in , according to the scenario proposed by rubakov and shaposhnikov @xcite , is the topological defect provided by the very same soliton .",
    "the rubakov - shaposhnikov scenario @xcite has been extended to five - dimensional warped space - time by means of a self - interacting scalar field , or a set of ( self-)interacting scalar fields also coupled to gravity @xcite . in those nonlinear models ,",
    "also inspired on previous studies on the stabilization of gravity fluctuations on domain walls in supergravity theories @xcite , the thick branes solutions are minimum energy configurations ( in many cases they are bogomolnyi - prasad - sommerfield ( bps ) solutions ) that separates the space in two patches with a peculiar warp - factor whose asymptotic behavior is an anti - de sitter ( ads@xmath0 ) space .    in some models",
    "the minimum energy configurations are wide solitons melfo1-@xcite , also called double - wall .",
    "double - wall configurations also appear as solutions , degenerate in energy @xcite , of a model with two interacting scalar fields @xcite-@xcite , and they have been called degenerate bloch branes .",
    "the model used in @xcite also comprises critical bloch branes @xcite which are analogues of the extreme domain walls described in @xcite .",
    "such a variety of solutions @xcite is due to an arbitrary constant of integration of the equations of motion .",
    "the continuous deformation from a single brane ( domain wall ) to a double - brane , up to an extreme one , by varying the constant of integration , is similar to the phenomenon of brane splitting discussed in @xcite , in analogy to first - order phase transitions in condensed matter systems .",
    "such a transition is usually approached by using a sixth degree polynomial potential , as was done in campos1 , which is characterized by the increase of a disordered phase ( a wet phase in surface physics ) or an increase of the thickness of the domain wall ( brane ) . as the temperature of the system approaches a certain limit",
    ", one has the appearance of two interfaces between the disordered phase and the ordered ones , that is , the formation of a double - wall .",
    "that phenomenon has been called _",
    "brane splitting _ @xcite .",
    "as the temperature of the system goes towards a critical one , a complete domination of the disordered phase ( complete wetting ) might happen , which we interpret , in brane worlds scenario , as the formation of an extreme brane .",
    "such a phase transition can also be described by effective non - polynomial potentials chumbeshott constructed from the model with two scalar fields bazeia2 , @xcite , @xcite with the advantage of having a model whose minimum energy solutions are the bps ones .",
    "the localization of fermions on a double - wall ( double - brane ) in warped space - time has been studied in @xcite and in @xcite .",
    "it has been shown that double - wall can localize massless fermions .",
    "notwithstanding , a close inspection on the behavior of the zero - mode eingenfunction reveals that it is peaked just in the region between the branes and has tails inside the branes , where the possibility of detecting massless fermions is very small .",
    "it can be noticed that this behavior is due to the yukawa coupling , @xmath1 , of fermions to the soliton .",
    "we think that the peak of the zero - mode eingenfunction should follows the trend of the brane , that is , it should also split . in this work",
    "we show that this behavior can be achieved by means of a convenient coupling of the fermion to the scalar field which is reminiscent from @xmath2 supersymmetry ( susy ) , namely @xmath3 , where @xmath4 is the 2nd derivative of the superpotential , of the field theory model , with respect to the field taken at the bps configuration .",
    "we develop the calculations by using one of the models obtained in chumbeshott , but they could also be done by using any other nonlinear model which admits two - kink solutions for the scalar field .",
    "we also analyze the localization of massless and massive fermions in the rubakov - shaposhnikov framework @xcite , that is , in a non - warped space - time . in this latter case one",
    "clearly sees that the coupling @xmath1 provides an effective single well potential where the fermions would be trapped in , but that well is just in the region between the branes , while the coupling @xmath3 provides a double - well potential with wells in the cores of the branes , as it should be . in the case of flat space - time , the numerov method is used to obtain the massive localized modes , with emphasis on the susy inspired coupling with which there is room to prepare a chiral mixed state of quasi - degenerate massless and tiny mass fermion states .",
    "we also show that such a mixed state can tunnel between the two branes with time of tunneling inversely proportional to the tiny mass which , in its turn , decreases as the distance between the walls increases .",
    "we would like to warn the reader that the brane splitting is not considered here as a dynamic process ; in fact , the distance between the walls is one of the parameters of the nonlinear potential that could be seen as dependent on the temperature and the tunneling of fermions is analyzed at a fixed distance between the walls , that is , at a given temperature close to the critical temperature for the formation of an extreme wall .    in the next section",
    "we show the main features of the nonlinear model coupled to gravity in 5-dimensional space - time @xcite . in the third section we are concerned to the localization of massless fermions on a split brane in warped space - time . in the fourth section we deal with the localization and tunneling of massive fermions in flat 5-dimensional space - time .",
    "a few remarks on fermion localization on double - walls are left to the last section .",
    "the model we are going to deal with includes a self - interacting scalar field coupled minimally to gravity with one extra space dimension , denoted by @xmath5 .",
    "the action that leads to euler - lagrange for the scalar field and einstein equations is given by@xmath6where @xmath7 and the metric is @xmath8where @xmath9 is the minkowski metric and @xmath10 is the warp factor , which is supposed to depend only on the extra dimension @xmath5 .",
    "the greek indices run from @xmath11 to @xmath12 .",
    "we consider that the potential @xmath13 can be written as @xmath14 in this case the bps  solution of the following first - order differential equations @xmath15are also solutions of the second - order differential equations  of motion in the static limit .    by taking @xmath16 , which we call the superpotential , given by @xmath17 ,   \\label{eq5}\\]]with @xmath18 and @xmath19",
    ", we have @xmath20and the solutions of the first - order differential equations ( [ eq4 ] ) can be found straightforwardly .",
    "the classical configuration for the scalar field is given by @xmath21where the ( lower)upper sign stands for ( anti-)kink configuration .",
    "the reference @xcite has more details on the soliton profile , as well as on the behavior of the warp factor in this model .",
    "as has been noted in the second paper of reference @xcite , the solution ( [ eq7 ] ) can be conveniently written as@xmath22 ,   \\label{eq8}\\]]where we have identified @xmath23 .",
    "the above expression can be seen as a merging of two solitons ( two kinks ) , namely @xmath24 $ ] , which are localized at @xmath25 and @xmath26 .    in flat two - dimensional space - time",
    "one constructs such a scalar model as the bosonic sector of a @xmath2 susy model with the potential given by only the first contribution at the right hand side of the equation ( [ eq3 ] ) .",
    "in such a circumstance one can clearly see that the potential has two minima at @xmath27 and one additional minimum appears at @xmath28 as @xmath29 .",
    "this transition in the potential is reflected in the behavior of the soliton in ( [ eq8 ] ) , which is continuously deformed from one kink into a two - kink profile and finally in one of the solutions , @xmath30 , for @xmath29 ( in this critical case @xmath31 is replaced by an arbitrary constant of integration ) .",
    "a first - order phase transition takes place .",
    "it is characterized by the growing of the disordered phase with the formation of two interfaces separating the disordered phase from the ordered ones , up to the complete wetting in the critical limit .",
    "the phase transition can also be seen from the behavior of the warp factor , discussed in  @xcite .",
    "one can see that the warp factor separates the space along the extra dimension in two similar regions , whose asymptotic behavior is an ads@xmath0 space and , as @xmath31 increases , a double - brane structure is triggered at a specific value of @xmath32 .",
    "such a double - brane structure is evident from the peaks of the ricci scalar @xmath33 @xmath34 @xmath35 just at the points the core of the branes are localized ( see figure 1 below ) .",
    "moreover , in the limit @xmath36 the branes are infinitely separated from each other , there being the formation of an extreme brane .",
    "such an extreme case is discussed in references @xcite and @xcite where the brane is called a _",

    "the problem is approached by searching normalized solutions of the dirac equation for fermions coupled with the scalar field by a general yukawa coupling @xmath37 , where @xmath38 is a functional of the field @xmath39 taken at the classical solution .",
    "the functional form of @xmath38 , as well as the dependence of the metric on @xmath5 , is crucial for the possible localization of massless fermions on the brane , as we discuss below .",

    "equations ( [ 14 ] ) are equivalent to the equations for the components of a spinor describing a massless fermion in 1 + 1 dimensions subject to a mixing of scalar and vector potentials . the time - independent equation for a fermion under such potentials can be written as @xmath62 , with the dirac hamiltonian given ( in natural units ) by @xmath63 , where @xmath64 is the momentum operator , @xmath65 and @xmath66 are the two off - diagonal pauli matrices , @xmath67 @xmath68 ( note that @xmath38 is a function of @xmath5 ) is the scalar potential and @xmath69 is the vector potential .",

    "the issue of localization of massive modes on the brane is not going to be discussed in this section , even though , we would like to remark that the analysis of the possible massive spectrum of bound states is not as simple as the search for localized massless modes @xcite , @xcite . moreover , normalizable @xmath74functions is guaranteed if they satisfy the ortonormalization relations    @xmath75    from these relations one can note that the warp factor is crucial to determine the localization of whatever mode .    particularly , for the massless mode one finds that    @xmath76\\ ;   \\nonumber \\\\ \\alpha _ { l_{0}}(r ) & = & n_{l_{0}}\\exp [ -2a(r)-\\int^{r}f(r^{\\prime } ) dr^{\\prime } ] ~ ,   \\label{16}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where we have used @xmath77and @xmath78 are constants of normalization that are found according to the normalization relations@xmath79     one can note that the normalization conditions are determined by the asymptotic behavior of the integrands in the expressions above . in most of the examples dealing with thick branes",

    "we have analyzed the behavior of the massless chiral modes for two cases , namely : @xmath91 and @xmath92 , where @xmath93is a coupling constant and @xmath4 is the second - derivative of the superpotential ( [ eq5 ] ) with respect to @xmath94 taken at the two - kink configuration in ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "the first case is the simplest yukawa coupling of fermions to a scalar real field , while the second one is inspired on the coupling of fermions and bosons within a @xmath2 susy model , which is also considered in the next section .",
    "this last functional coupling is the one which provides the correct localization on the brane .",
    "in fact , the simplest yukawa coupling also provides a localized massless left - handed mode , @xmath87 , but it does not follows the brane splitting , that is , while the double - wall is formed , the peak of the wavefunction is midway between the two walls , there being a small probability density to find such a mode on the core of the walls themselves . on the other hand , in the case @xmath92 , one has @xmath95with peaks on the branes , signalizing a great probability for the massless left - handed mode to be found just on the branes and a small probability to be found on the bulk and between the walls .",
    "those behaviors can be seen from figure 2 , where the profiles of @xmath96 are shown for different values of @xmath31 .",
    "figure 2 should be confronted with figure 1 .",
    "in this section we adopt the usual analysis to find fermion bound states under the action of the scalar field whose classical configuration is given in ( [ eq7 ] ) .",
    "particularly , we focus on the scenario proposed in rubakov1 , that is , a brane ( or domain wall ) immersed in a five - dimensional flat space - time .",

    "we again have analyzed the behavior of the massless modes by setting @xmath105 and @xmath92 , with @xmath106 . in the first case we have@xmath107as in the previous section , the function @xmath108is symmetric in @xmath5 and",
    "has a peak at @xmath89 , hence the massless left - handed mode is localized in the region between the branes with a very small probability density at the core of the branes .    for @xmath92 one finds@xmath109from figure 3",
    "we can note that @xmath87 is symmetric in @xmath5 , has no nodes and exhibits peaks at the cores of the branes .",
    "one can also note that the probability density to find the left - handed massless mode in the midway between the branes decreases as @xmath31 increases .",
    "the adequate behavior of the massless mode is sufficient enough to consider the functional coupling @xmath92 as very convenient and has motivated us to analyze the consequences of such a coupling on the localization of massive modes on the split brane in flat space - time .",
    "as one knows , equations ( [ 18 ] ) and ( [ 19 ] ) can be decoupled to two second - order differential equations , namely    @xmath110    where @xmath111 and @xmath112 in the case @xmath92 .",
    "it is also known that the equations above are time - independent schrdinger equations , whose corresponding hamiltonians are superpartners of each other , that is , one has a quantum mechanics supersymmetry .",
    "this is formally true whatever is the functional coupling @xmath38 , but in the case considered here such supersymmetry seems to be a reflection of a supersymmetry at the fundamental level . in other words",
    ", one can note that @xmath5-dependent part of the excitations of the scalar field ( _ branons _ ) , picked up to quadratic terms on the fundamental lagrangian density in flat space - time ( now with @xmath113 ) , obeys a time - dependent schrdinger equation similar to the one obeyed by @xmath114 with @xmath115 , that is , with an effective potential given by @xmath116 , resulting identical mass spectrum for _ branons _",
    "( bosonic excitations ) _ _  _ _ and fermions .    in figure 4",
    "it is shown the form of the potentials @xmath117 and @xmath118 for a specific value of @xmath31 and @xmath115 . for values of @xmath31 close to zero , @xmath119 is a single well potential , which starts to be deformed into a double - well potential as @xmath31 approaches to a critical value @xmath120 , that is determined by the condition @xmath121 ; for @xmath122 , dimples are observed around @xmath123 , and a remarkable double - well is observed for the value of @xmath124 corresponding to @xmath125 . it worth mentioning that , although the bottom of the double - well is slightly raised as @xmath31 increases , the width of the double - well potential also increases , signalizing the possible entrapment of a massive state , besides the , always present , massless one .",
    "this possible appearance of a massive bound state can also be seen from the behavior of @xmath117 , which is a single well potential whose bottom is above zero for @xmath126 and equals to zero for @xmath124 , that is , the deepness and width of @xmath117 increase as @xmath31 increases .",
    "one can also observe that @xmath127 and @xmath128 for @xmath129 and @xmath115 ; such that the first potential admits two bound states and the later admits only one bound state .",
    "the fundamental state of  @xmath118 for @xmath129 and @xmath115 is @xmath130 , whereas the first excited state is @xmath131 @xmath132 and the fundamental state of @xmath117  for @xmath129 and @xmath115 is @xmath133 .",
    "moreover , from the expression ( [ 22 ] ) with @xmath115 , one can construct  an antisymmetric function as @xmath134 @xmath135 as an approximate expression for the first excited state of @xmath118 when @xmath136 .",
    "this approximation for the first excited state is commonly used to approach the discrete spectrum of double well potentials @xcite , sukhatme .",
    "we have used the results described above , together with the numerov method to analyze the behavior of @xmath131 , @xmath137 and the eigenvalue @xmath138at intermediary values of @xmath31 .",
    "those behaviors are shown in figures 5 and 6 . from them",
    "one can see that @xmath137 is mainly distributed on the region between the branes , hence there is a small probability for the massive right - handed mode being observed inside the wells where the universe(s ) would be realized , whereas the probability density associated with @xmath131 is pronounced just on the cores of the branes . in summary",
    ", at least one massive left - handed mode is localized on the branes .",
    "the eigenvalue @xmath139 decreases smoothly as @xmath31 increases , that is an expected result when one is dealing with double - well potentials in non - relativistic quantum mechanics .",
    "that way , one can construct a mixed left - handed massive state with both , the fundamental and the first excited state , which are quasi - degenerate for very large values of @xmath31 , namely    @xmath140    where @xmath141 is a constant spinor which satisfies @xmath142 .",
    "we have tried to be cautious when proposing this mixed state , since we are assuming that there is a rest reference frame for the particle in such a mixed state . with this reasoning ,",
    "the dirac equation @xmath143 is satisfied , since @xmath144 ( @xmath145 ) and there is no right - handed massless state , neither inside nor outside the branes . the probability density associated with this mixed state",
    "is given by@xmath146 , \\label{25}\\]]which is an oscillating probability density with period of oscillation @xmath147 , such that a tiny mass implies a long tunneling time . in this scenario",
    "the fermion tunnels from one brane to the other , being likely found on both branes , but not simultaneously .",
    "as @xmath31 increases , other massive localized states can be realized inside the branes .",
    "in fact , we have found numerically that there is room to one more massive state in the present case .",
    "the appearance of a tower of localized massive states is very dependent on the deepness and width of the double - well effective potential @xmath119 , that is ultimately dependent on the superpotential @xmath16 whose classical solution is a kink that can be continuously deformed into two - kink solution . in the next section we comment on the construction of such models .",
    "we have studied the mechanism that leads to the localization of  massless fermions on a split brane in the cases of warped and flat geometries .",
    "the brane is immersed in a five - dimensional space - time and is defined by the behavior of a scalar field coupled with gravity in the case of warped space - time .",
    "the nonpolynomial potential of the self - interacting scalar field which generates the split brane was introduced before in reference chumbeshott , but any other model which has deformable solitons as minimal energy configurations could be used as well , for example , a convenient @xmath148 polynomial potential @xcite    the case of flat geometry is more manageable than the case of warped geometry , not only because we obtain the localized modes in a simple way , but also , and mainly , because it allows us to understand why the coupling of fermions with the scalar field should be chosen in such a way that a supersymmetry in a fundamental level is realized .",
    "the most convenient coupling , which preserves the supersymmetry , also leads to the expected behavior of the fermion wavefunctions , that is , the ground - state wavefunction follows the brane splitting .",
    "as the brane splits into two branes the wavefunction is also split , with peaks at the cores of the two branes . although the simplest yukawa coupling of fermions to scalar fields also provides localization of massless fermions , the corresponding massless fermion wavefunction present a peak just between the two branes , such that the observation of massless fermions is suppressed inside the branes .",
    "hence , one concludes the supersymmetry inspired coupling as the most adequate one to study  the entrapment of fermions by a split brane .",
    "we also note that eventual massive localized states are more difficult to be found in the case of warped geometry than in the case of flat geometry . in the later case",
    "we have also discussed the tunneling of  a massive fermion between the branes , which lasts until the branes are infinitely separated from each other .",
    "that critical limit is described by another model , obtained from the starting one by taking the limit @xmath149 in ( [ eq6 ] ) , that is @xmath150 , whose solution is one of the single kinks @xmath151 $ ] , with @xmath152 a reference point where the core of the defect is localized . in this case",
    "we found that the energy gap between the first localized states is large enough such that they can not be considered as quasi - degenerate .",
    "it can also be observed that the number of massive localized states depends on the deepness and width of the quantum mechanics effective potentials , which are defined by the field theory model one chooses to deal with .",
    "we have mentioned above that others models whose classical solution exhibit a two - kink profile ( split brane ) can afford a tower of localized massive fermions states . a class of such models , called deformed models , have been proposed @xcite , as deformation of others known models .",
    "we notice that those models can also be constructed , together with new ones , from the deformation of zero modes excitations of well know models whose classical solutions are single kinks .",

    "<S> in this work we analyze the localization of fermions on a brane embedded in five - dimensional , warped and non - warped , space - time . in both cases </S>",
    "<S> we use the same nonlinear theoretical model with a non - polynomial potential featuring a self - interacting scalar field whose minimum energy solution is a soliton ( a kink ) which can be continuously deformed into a two - kink . </S>",
    "<S> thus a single brane splits into two branes . </S>",
    "<S> the behavior of spin 1/2 fermions wavefunctions on the split brane depends on the coupling of fermions to the scalar field and on the geometry of the space - time . </S>"
