    "until recently , studies of faint field galaxies have been limited to galaxy counts , colors , and redshift distributions , which can be used to construct luminosity functions at earlier epochs .",
    "such luminosity functions are then compared to models incorporating a certain amount of number evolution ( controlled by galaxy formation and merging ) coupled with luminosity and color evolution ( controlled by star formation histories ) .",
    "recent models range from those predicting only a small degree of luminosity evolution ( gronwall & koo 1995 ) to those invoking entirely new classes of galaxies ( babul & rees 1992 ; babul & ferguson 1996 ) , to those requiring high merger rates ( broadhurst , ellis , & glazebrook 1992 ) . a direct measure of luminosity evolution in field galaxies will help to distinguish between various hypotheses .",
    "such measures have recently been attempted , but the results are somewhat contradictory .",
    "schade  ( 1996a ) found evidence for disk brightening by 1.2 @xmath6 mag in galaxies at redshifts @xmath14 .",
    "simard & pritchet ( 1996 ) found even greater levels of evolution ( @xmath15 mag ) in a sample of very blue galaxies at @xmath16 for which strong lines could be spatially resolved .",
    "rix  ( 1997 ) , also using kinematic information , derived a brightening of 1.5 mag at @xmath17 for sub-@xmath18 galaxies .",
    "in contrast , vogt  ( 1996 ) and bershady ( 1997 ) , using optical rotation curves , and forbes  ( 1996 ) , using line widths , found only small deviations from the local tully - fisher ( tf ) relation for spiral galaxies , implying only modest brightening ( @xmath70.4 mag ) out to @xmath19 .",
    "simard & pritchet postulate that these various results could be reconciled if strong luminosity evolution were present _ only _ in lower - mass systems .",
    "if confirmed , this would be an important factor in understanding the evolution of field galaxies .",
    "this letter introduces well - resolved rotation curves of eight predominantly lower - luminosity galaxies ( @xmath20 = -20.3 , see efstathiou , ellis , & peterson 1988 ) , selected by morphology as suitable tf candidates .",
    "these new observations provide a valuable test of the mass - dependent luminosity evolution hypothesis , particularly in comparison to the higher - mass sample presented by vogt  ( 1996 ; hereafter `` '' ) .",
    "combined with the work of , these data form a sample of rotation curves for 16 galaxies at redshifts 0.15  @xmath21  @xmath21  1 , ranging over half the age of the universe ( for @xmath22 , one  third for @xmath23 ) .",
    "we also use this combined data set to explore trends in surface brightness for comparison with colless ( 1994 ) , forbes  ( 1996 ) and schade  ( 1996a ) .",
    "detailed analysis of a significantly larger data set is currently underway , and these results will be used to explore a variety of relevant selection effects . a full description of our analysis techniques is deferred to that paper ( vogt  1997 ) .",
    "the tf candidate objects were selected from wfpc2 f814w ( `` @xmath24 '' ) images of the flanking fields of the hubble deep field (;",
    "williams  1996 ) .",
    "selection was based on the following criteria : ( _ i _ ) undistorted disk morphology ; ( _ ii _ ) inclination greater than 30 ; ( _ iii _ ) no interacting companions or obscuring foreground stars ; and ( _ iv _ ) @xmath25 .",
    "the selection was made with no apriori knowledge of redshifts or luminosities .",
    "the galaxies were observed in 1996 april under the auspices of the project ( koo 1995 ) , using the low resolution imaging spectrograph (; oke  1995 ) on the keck 10  telescope",
    ".  employs slitmasks to provide `` long - slit '' spectral observations for multiple objects simultaneously . for the tf candidates , the slitlet for each object",
    "was tilted to align with the major axis of each galaxy .",
    "slitlets were 11 wide and @xmath26120 long for these objects .",
    "integration times were 50 minutes for each of two 600 line mm@xmath8 gratings , blazed at 5000 and 7500   ; the combined spectral range was roughly 38008600   .",
    "spectral and spatial scales were 1.28    pix@xmath8 and 0215  pix@xmath8 , respectively .",
    "the seeing was approximately 10 fwhm .",
    "in additional to spectroscopy , two 300s @xmath27-band images of the field were acquired .",
    "( see phillips  1997 for more details of the observations and for galaxy coordinates . )",
    "the new spectral data have several significant improvements over those of .",
    "the targets were preselected as suitable tf galaxies , whereas the rotation curves in  were obtained serendipitously .",
    "slitlets were aligned with the galaxy major axes , removing a source of potentially significant error .",
    "finally , the expanded spectral range means that multiple emission lines were observed for each object , through for @xmath28 ( the majority of our sources ) , and through  for @xmath29 .",
    "@xmath30 , only the  lines were available .",
    "the  spectra were debiased and flat  fielded , and then rectified .",
    "wavelength calibration was done using the procedure described in kelson 1997 .",
    "no relative or absolute flux calibration was applied .",
    "all spectra ( not just those preselected for tf work ) were examined for spatially extended emission lines , but only one additional object ( ie4 - 1304 - 1007 ) displayed such lines ( the apparent inclination of this object was too low for our criteria , but we include it in our final sample ) . among the 18 preselected candidates ,",
    "one has yielded no redshift identification ; one has a pure early - type spectrum with no detected emission lines ; one at @xmath31 displayed unusually weak lines , both in emission and absorption ; eight show normal disk galaxy spectra but the emission lines are too weak to use to derive velocity curves ; and seven display emission lines of sufficient strength to determine velocity structure .",
    "the group of eight has virtually the same median redshift ( 0.50 ) and redshift range ( 0.410.77 ) as do the seven successful targets .    both the doublet and  and were observed for most sources in the final sample .",
    "the spatially - resolved emission lines were analyzed using the same gaussian profile fitting technique described in  ( see also vogt 1995 ) .",
    "briefly , a single ( or double ) gaussian profile was fit to each emission line ( or doublet ) at each point in the spatial direction .",
    "profiles were considered acceptable whenever the gaussian fit met minimum requirements in height and width , generally a signal - to - noise - ratio ( ) of 5@xmath32 and 3@xmath32 , respectively ; the typical value was 10@xmath32 for both width and amplitude .",
    "central wavelengths of the profiles were used to construct observed rotation curves .    as discussed in ,",
    "the sizes of the disks in these galaxies are on the order of the seeing and the slit  width .",
    "thus , wavelength shifts in the observed spectral lines are not only a function of the velocity profile of the disk but also the surface brightness distribution and the mapping of the seeing  smoothed flux through the full slit .",
    "( a simplifying factor for the new data is that the misalignment of the slit relative to the galaxy major axis was less than 10  for all but one source . ) to derive terminal velocities we must correct for these effects . to this end , we employ a grid of simple exponential disk models with different terminal velocities to simulate emission lines , and fit these model emission lines identically to the spectral data .",
    "the circular velocity of the galaxy model was iteratively adjusted to match the observed data , and adopted as the intrinsic terminal velocity , .",
    "( for some galaxies , a clear turnover in the velocity curve was not observed .",
    "rather than match the inner , rising rotation curve and extrapolate to a turnover velocity , we have chosen the model whose measured turnover velocity matches the maximum velocity measured in our spectra ; these models provide lower limits to the true . )",
    "errors in  were estimated by varying the inclination and position angle of each galaxy by @xmath33  10 .",
    "the  images were analyzed using iraf - based tools ( see forbes  1994 ; phillips  1997 ) .",
    "total magnitudes were measured from aperture growth curves ; inclinations and position angles were estimated from outer elliptical isophotes ; and disk scale lengths were measured from simultaneous disk - plus - bulge fits to the major axis intensity profiles",
    ". took images of the flanking fields in  only , so a  @xmath27 image was used to determine a @xmath27@xmath34 color .",
    "the  image was seeing - degraded to match the ground  based image , and the color was determined within a 22 diameter aperture ( see phillips  1997 for more detail ) .",
    "intrinsic galaxy parameters were calculated using the measured redshifts , photometry , and angular scales , assuming and @xmath4.@xmath35 to determine restframe @xmath36 , @xmath37-corrections were interpolated from the model seds of gronwall & koo ( 1995 ) , which are based on bruzual & charlot ( 1993 ) models and realistic star - formation scenarios .",
    "current epoch ( non - evolving ) seds were used .",
    "since restframe @xmath6 corresponds to observed at @xmath38 and to  at @xmath39 , errors in the @xmath37-corrections should be small .",
    "galactic extinction was taken to be negligible for the ( williams  1996 ) , and sources were corrected for internal extinction following the method of tully & fouqu ( 1985 ) in order to be consistent with pierce & tully ( 1988 ; 1992 ) .",
    "images of the eight new galaxies and their spatially - resolved  lines are shown in figure  [ plate ] ( plates nn1nn2 ) ) , along with the observed and modeled velocity curves .",
    "like the eight galaxies discussed in , these new distant tf galaxies appear to be quite similar to local normal spiral galaxies , both morphologically and kinematically .",
    "the hst images show apparently normal , disk - dominated spirals . allowing for seeing and resolution effects ,",
    "the velocity curves are qualitatively similar to those of local spirals .",
    "the rotation curves are traceable to @xmath73 exponential scale lengths ( @xmath40 ) in the disks , a length comparable to the extent of rotation curves for local galaxies ( vogt 1995 ) .",
    "a simple estimate of their masses , @xmath41 , yields values of 0.5@xmath42 within 15 kpc , similar to the range of masses found for nearby spirals .    for purposes of discussion ,",
    "we separate the velocity data into two classes .",
    "high quality is defined as having sufficient  and resolution elements to clearly determine a terminal velocity ; at least one emission line free of strong night - sky contamination ; apparent inclination greater than 30 ; and slit misaligned with the galaxy major axis by @xmath4320 .",
    "six of the eight new galaxies and five from  meet these criteria .",
    "note that the serendipitous object , ie4 - 1304 - 1007 , is a low - quality source .      in figure  [ tf ]",
    "we compare the 16 galaxies to a local tf relation in the restframe @xmath6-band .",
    "the local relation shown is an _",
    "inverse _ fit (  as a function of @xmath44 ) to the local sample from pierce & tully ( 1992 ) ; this is the proper fit for comparison with a magnitude  limited sample ( see ) .",
    "the 11 high - quality sources have a weighted offset of @xmath45 mag relative to the local relation , and an _ rms _ dispersion of 0.65 mag .",
    "this observed dispersion matches the combined estimated errors of the logarithmic velocity widths ( 0.47 ) , the restframe @xmath6 magnitudes ( 0.2 ) , and an assumed intrinsic scatter in the tf relation ( 0.4 ; willick  1996 and references therein ) , thus helping to validate our error estimates .",
    "the lower - quality points show a much larger scatter , as expected .",
    "we emphasize that the derived offset , @xmath70.4 mag , represents an _ upper limit _ to luminosity evolution of field galaxies , for these reasons : any magnitude - limited sample is biased towards more luminous objects ; our analysis is restricted to objects with detectable emission lines  that is , actively star - forming galaxies which are likely to have elevated @xmath6 luminosities ; some terminal velocities are lower limits ; and we may be overcorrecting for extinction if galaxies were less dusty at earlier epochs .",
    "our choice of @xmath46 is also conservative  derived luminosities are reduced by 0.10.4 mag for @xmath23 . while mass evolution is a possible factor",
    ", we have implicitly assumed that evolution in luminosity dominates the observed offset .",
    "we do not expect the masses to evolve strongly , though , given the presence of clearly formed disks .",
    "the new  data extend the luminosity range of our total sample to @xmath47 .",
    "it is notable that _ there is no deviation from a linear relation over this range _ , there is no evidence in these data for different amounts of luminosity evolution in different luminosity or mass regimes .",
    "one explanation for the wide range in luminosity evolution found by various groups is that sample selection strongly affects the degree of evolution detected in a given sample . in our sample , the galaxies were chosen primarily by morphology . on the other hand , bershady ( 1997 ) , simard & pritchet ( 1996 ) , and",
    "rix  ( 1997 ) all selected _ blue _ galaxies .",
    "these studies all had different sample selection , redshift ranges , and observational and analysis techniques ; a direct comparison is not practical nor is a full discussion of these parameters within the scope of this letter ( see vogt  1997 ) . however , it is useful to consider the potentially critical issue of color selection criteria .",
    "the bershady ( 1997 ) low redshift ( @xmath48 ) sample shows an offset of less than 0.5 mag , while the rix  ( 1997 ) spatially unresolved data at redshift @xmath17 show evidence for a magnitude offset of @xmath71.5 relative to a local _ blue _ sample ( the effect would be even greater if the data were compared to a general local sample ) .",
    "simard & pritchet ( 1996 ) chose the strongest  emitters from among a sample of emission - line galaxies ( simard 1996 ) , and they find the highest offset of all ( 2.5 @xmath33 0.5 mag for a redshift of @xmath16 ; note the large scatter ) .",
    "this suggests the bluest , most actively star forming galaxies may show the largest offsets .",
    "forbes  ( 1996 ) , whose sample was not color selected , noted some correlation between their offsets and galaxy colors in the sense that the galaxies with the largest offsets tended to be blue .",
    "rix  ( 1997 ) find the same trend within their blue sample . as further example",
    ", figure  [ tf ] includes the two galaxies from vogt  ( 1993 ) with observed optical rotation curves ; one ( sa68@xmath492545.3 ) was chosen specifically for its unusually strong  flux , and this galaxy shows a very large offset from the tf relation .",
    "taken together , this suggests that for redshifts @xmath50 , color may prove to be a good indicator of luminosity evolution in field galaxies , distinguishing between an average , stable population and a bluer , star - forming population with enhanced luminosity .",
    "changes in surface brightness levels in disk galaxies can provide an independent determination of luminosity evolution  provided scale lengths do not evolve strongly  and is particularly useful since it is independent of @xmath11 .",
    "freeman ( 1970 ) showed that disks in local spiral galaxies have a near - uniform central surface brightness ( @xmath51 = 21.65 mag arcsec@xmath9 ) .",
    "recently de jong ( 1995 ) found a morphological - type dependence to the surface brightness , and studied the effect of internal extinction , determining a value of @xmath51 = 21.45 @xmath33 0.76 mag arcsec@xmath9 for the case of spirals of t - types 16 ( rc3 ) with semitransparent disks . among high redshift ( @xmath52 ) galaxies , forbes  ( 1996 ) concluded that the surface brightness increases by 0.6 @xmath33 0.1 mag with respect to local galaxies of similar mass .",
    "this is also in agreement with colless  ( 1994 ) .",
    "schade  ( 1996b , a ) find increases of @xmath70.9 mag out to a redshift @xmath53 and @xmath54 mag for disk galaxies at redshifts @xmath55 , respectively ( with no correction for internal extinction ) . for our sample ,",
    "we compare disk sizes and luminosities for the 15 disk galaxies , as plotted in figure  [ sb ] ( we exclude the `` double nucleus '' galaxy from , as its structure is complex ) . the single early - type spiral ( ne4 - 1269 - 1248 )",
    "appears to be a `` ring galaxy '' whose profile is difficult to fit .",
    "scale length measurements for it range from 04 to 10 ; we adopt 06 ( with large uncertainties ) as it appears most credible .",
    "this galaxy also has a significantly larger b / d ratio ( @xmath70.9 ) than that of the others ( @xmath70.1 ) . as is normal practice ,",
    "the disk scale lengths have not been corrected to face - on values .",
    "sources with inclination @xmath56  may be systematically in error , due to distortion of the surface brightness profiles from non - uniform extinction at different radii ( giovanelli  1994 ) .",
    "comparison is made with de jong s local galaxy sample , and distant galaxy measurements from schade ( 1996a ) .",
    "we find our sample to have an overall offset of @xmath57 mag with respect to local galaxies , in fairly good agreement with the offset in the tf relation . though the highest redshift data ( @xmath58 ) generally lie within the locus of the data points from schade the median offset in our data is significantly less .",
    "the apparent brightening at the high mass end ( seen also in the data of forbes  1996 ) , could be caused by a bias toward higher - than - average luminosities among the most distant objects , as well as by luminosity evolution .",
    "in summary , we have compared a set of 16 high redshift galaxies with a local tf relation and find a modest amount of luminosity evolution ( @xmath59m@xmath60 0.4 ) .",
    "this conclusion is supported by an examination of the surface brightness characteristics of the sample , which show evidence for evolution at the level of @xmath7 0.6 magnitude .",
    "we find no evidence for deviation from a linear tf relation at lower luminosities , down to a magnitude m@xmath6119 .",
    "the bluest galaxies within the sample have a slightly larger offset from the local tf relation , which suggests ( when taken in conjunction with results of other studies ) that the derived degree of luminosity evolution may depend strongly on sample selection .",
