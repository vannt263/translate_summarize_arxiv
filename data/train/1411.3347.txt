    "analytic models were unavoidable in physics before the advent of computers .",
    "this forced researchers to extract the essence of the problems and design the models to catch the crucial properties .",
    "appropriately done these simplifications delivered deep insight and the necessary realistic results .",
    "computers are extremely useful to provide solutions of more and more complicated problems .",
    "advanced research is then almost by definition forced to push implementations to the limit of the available computer capacity .",
    "the increased complexity of problems combined with large numerical calculations require larger efforts to understand and develope an intuition for the underlying physics . getting the deeper insight",
    "is more difficult for complicated problems , but nevertheless very desirable for several reasons . beside the direct usefulness of basic understanding , it is also efficient in construction of improved algorithms , which in turn would allow investigation of even more complicated problems .",
    "we recapitulate briefly a number of important reasons to employ suitable analytic methods .",
    "first , model construction must concentrate on the crucial features , and thus formulate and order the issues according to importance .",
    "second , in many perturbative approaches in physics the potentials are expanded to second order in coordinates or momenta , and the emerging harmonic oscillator problems are analytic .",
    "third , a problem can be beyond even present day computer capacity .",
    "fourth , advanced numerics can be greatly improved by combination with analytic tools and insight .",
    "fifth , analytic models can hardly be overestimated as a tool in teaching on all levels .",
    "sixth , present experimental frontline research on cold atomic gases employ unprecedentedly simple ( almost ) analytically solvable potentials @xcite .",
    "the harmonic oscillator is the simplest and most useful analytic potential at our disposal and this has been exploited throughout the history of physics .",
    "a relevant example dating all the way back to 1926 is by werner heisenberg who used harmonic hamiltonians to gain insight into the many - body problem @xcite ( within a year of him inventing the new quantum theory ) .",
    "later on the harmonic oscillator was instrumental in providing insights for models of the atomic nucleus @xcite .",
    "harmonic interactions have also been used as a replacement for coulomb potentials in atoms in order to gain analytical insights ( the so - called moshinsky atom or pseudoatom ) @xcite .",
    "these models continue to produce new insights into aspects of atomic systems such as the density matrix @xcite , correlations @xcite and entropy @xcite , density functionals @xcite , and entanglement properties @xcite .",
    "harmonic models have been a subject of great interest in several other fields including quantum dots @xcite , quantum statistics @xcite , black holes thermodynamics @xcite , and recently also area laws and entanglement in quantum many - body systems @xcite .    in the field of cold atomic gases the harmonic oscillator method has also served as an important model to gain insights . for instance , it has been used extensively as a starting point for path integral calculations of quantum gas properties @xcite .",
    "more recently , an @xmath1-body model for harmonically interacting particles in an external harmonic confining potential has been solved @xcite , and the spectra have been used to investigate thermodynamics and virial expansions @xcite .",
    "all these studies attest to the versatility of the harmonic approach as an analytical tool that can address even advanced frontline research questions .",
    "a recent frontier in ultracold atomic gases is the creation of ultracold polar molecules @xcite with long - range interactions that hold great promise for greating some unique exotic quantum systems @xcite . to avoid strong dipolar loss due to the attractive head - to - tail interactions",
    ", the dipoles should be confined to lower dimensional geometries such as tubes or layers , and a layered system of dipoles was recently experimentally realized @xcite .",
    "in such a system one expects the formation of chains of dipoles which are bound structures across several layers @xcite .",
    "similarly , in one - dimensional tubes one also expects this bound state formation @xcite .",
    "this chain formation takes place in a topologically disjoint system as the layers or tubes are physically disconnected when tunneling between them is negligible .",
    "however , they still provide a very interesting physical system as the dipolar interactions are long - range and act between physically disconnected parts of the system .",
    "here we consider some general models that allow an analytical approach to such topologically disjoint geometries .",
    "more generally , the purpose of the present paper is to discuss an analytic model which reduces a @xmath0 problem in a non - trivial geometry with disjoint regions to an approximate but analytic @xmath1-body problem and @xmath1 individual two - body problems .",
    "the particles must pairwise have the same masses but the in - pair interaction can be arbitrary .",
    "the same four two - body oscillator interactions are preferred between two such pairs .",
    "otherwise there are no constraints on masses and arbitrary oscillator intereractions are allowed .",
    "a seperable model like the one we discuss here has been studied recently within the context of exactly solvable models @xcite and applied as a model of two - electron atoms and molecules @xcite . in the current work we will be applying this kind of hamiltonian to other model systems that are of relevance for neutral atoms in cold atomic gases .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section  [ method ]",
    "we derive the conditions for the huge simplification obtained by decoupling the different degrees of freedom . in section  [ analytics ]",
    "we specialize to analytic two - body problems , and in section  [ numerics ] we present a number of corresponding examples for illustrations . finally in section  [ conclusions ] , we briefly summarize , conclude and give perspectives .",
    "we consider a system of particles which can be divided into @xmath1 groups where each consists of one or two particles .",
    "a priori , all particles may be identical or different , and any spatial dimension is allowed . the two - body interactions between all the topologically separated groups of particles",
    "are assumed to be harmonic oscillators .",
    "in addition , we allow completely arbitrary interactions between the pairs of particles within each of the @xmath1 groups .",
    "identical particles must obey fermi or bose symmetry relations , but the group distinction must be maintained .",
    "the perhaps artificially appearing grouping and the related conditions arise from anticipating a strongly simplifying decoupling of the many degrees of freedom .",
    "the corresponding additional decoupling conditions are derived in the first subsection , and specific features of the solutions are discussed in the second subsection .",
    "the required distinction between particles and interactions can be achieved by geometrically separated systems .",
    "the most obvious possibilities are series of separate two - dimensional layers or one - dimensional tubes where each layer or tube is occupied by one or two particles .",
    "we provide a visualization in fig .",
    "the inter - layer and/or inter - tube two - body interactions then must be of harmonic oscillator form whereas arbitrary intra - layer and/or intra - tube two - body interactions are allowed .",
    "in addition one - body harmonic oscillator potentials acting on each of the particles are also allowed .",
    "the restrictive fundamental conditions may even be possible in some three - dimensional structures .",
    "imagine a lattice with up to two particles per site with arbitrary on - site interactions , and harmonic potentials between particles on different sites .",
    "the @xmath1 groups are labeled by @xmath2 and the two particles in each group are labeled by @xmath3 and @xmath4 , where we first assume two particles in all @xmath1 groups . to simplify the discussion we shall refer to the system as a series of @xmath1 doubly occupied layers . only @xmath3 and @xmath4",
    "are allowed arbitrary interactions , while two - body individual harmonic oscillator potentials are assumed for any of the other interactions .",

    "finally , we notice that the decoupled equations are easily found when only one particle occupies some of the layers .",
    "the different pieces of the hamiltonian as well as the related wave functions simply should skip the corresponding summations over the primed quantities and set @xmath56 .      the solutions fall into the different parts related to intra - layer two - body problems and inter - layer harmonic oscillator @xmath1-body problems .",

    "one analytic case is obviously with oscillator potentials which already was investigated previously even with many particles per layer @xcite .",

    "the origin arises outside the present model where the inter - layer attractive interaction is assumed to be approximated by a two - body harmonic oscillator potential .",
    "the zero - point energy should in principle be chosen by using a realistic potential to compute the two - body bound state energy , @xmath79 .",
    "to reproduce this value the oscillator must be shifted by @xmath80 . without knowing the realistic potential we can not be precise , but",
    "@xmath79 should vanish together with the energy of the oscillator .",
    "an easy and quite natural assumption is linear proportionality , that is @xmath81 , where @xmath82 for a bound state is a positive dimensionless constant depending on the interaction between the layers .",
    "we then get @xmath83 , and in total @xmath84 for weakly bound states @xmath82 is small but the present method is much better suited for modest or strongly bound systems .    in summary , the total energy spectrum is a sum arising from three different sources , that is intra- and inter - layer as well as center - of - mass contributions .",
    "the form is therefore @xmath85 where @xmath86 is the center - of - mass quantum number , and @xmath87 is the energy of the state within the @xmath3th layer .",
    "the full analytic solutions of decoupled systems are determined by the unspecified arbitrary potential , @xmath11 .",
    "it is tempting and illuminating to continue the descriptions by assuming analytically solvable potentials , yet with realistic or at least semi - realistic properties .",

    "the total energy per layer decreases for small @xmath1 and saturate for large @xmath1 at constant values which increase with excitation energy in accordance with the individual frequencies in eq .",
    "( [ spect ] ) .",
    "this saturation is closely related to the assumption of nearest neighbor inter - layer interaction .",
    "a longer - range interaction acting between layers further apart would lead to more than a linear @xmath1-dependence of the inter - layer energy .",
    "the additional increase would come from the normal mode frequencies in eq .",
    "( [ spect ] ) which would depend on a higher than linear power of @xmath1 .",

    "as the system gets larger , excitations become lower in energy and eventually approach the external field frequency .",
    "this lowering of the excitation energies with chain length is similar to acoustic phonons in solids @xcite .",

    "these plots are the same in 1 , 2 , and @xmath152 , if the interaction is isotropic ( except for degeneracies ) .",
    "the increase in zero - point energy in higher dimensions is cancelled by the @xmath60-dependence of the shift in eq .",
    "( [ shifteqn ] ) .",
    "the remaining part of the problem is related to the two - body intra - layer hamiltonian in eqs .",
    "( [ hampair ] ) or ( [ schrone ] ) . the fundamental frequency , @xmath153 ,",

    "the intra - layer energy spectrum is given by eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) for each of the @xmath1 layers .",

    "the number of layers only appears in the frequency obtained from eq .",
    "( [ vari ] ) , but when only nearest neighbors interact , this frequency becomes independent of the total number of layers .",
    "the energy spectrum is then obtained by adding four spectra , that is the inter - layer contribution shown in fig .",
    "[ fig1 ] , the @xmath160 times degenerate intra - layer spectrum from the inner layers , the @xmath157 identical end - layer spectra , and the total center - of - mass oscillator energies .",

    "if we also for @xmath108 include non - zero values of @xmath110 , a large number of other energies appears through the value of @xmath154 .",
    "this would for special values of @xmath95 corresponding to integers give rise to precise degeneracies rather than just larger density of states .",
    "the @xmath1-dependence receives contributions from all parts of the hamiltonian .",

    "( [ vari ] ) . the value of @xmath163 in eq .",
    "( [ vari ] ) increases from the outer to inner layers by about a factor of @xmath157 for large @xmath164 .",
    "these sizes are almost independent of dimension which only enters weakly through @xmath154 .",
    "the total energies are only useful in comparison with other energies .",
    "we may view the structure as two vertical strings interacting with each other through the direct intra - layer two - body repulsion and indirectly through the effective intra - layer potential arising from the interaction between particles in different strings .",
    "then we can investigate string - string properties where the relative binding energy must be a crucial quantity .",
    "we must first decide a value for @xmath14 to enter in both double and single string structures .",
    "the difference between zero - point shifts for these structures becomes @xmath165 .",

    "[ fig5 ] the difference per layer between the combined double string system and two separated strings as function of the number of layers for different repulsive strengths .",
    "the structure of this energy difference can be divided into different contributions , that is ( i ) inter - layer difference of doubly occupied layers minus two times singly occupied layers , ( ii ) intra - layer contribution which is almost @xmath60 and @xmath1-independent but contains all the @xmath95 dependence , ( iii ) inter - layer center - of - mass energy difference between the two types of occupancy which is comparably small as arising from only one ( vector ) degree of freedom .    the energy difference in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] always increases with @xmath1 although approaching a constant depending on @xmath95 for large @xmath1 .",
    "the inter - layer leading order coefficients on @xmath1 must be more than twice as large for two as it is for one string with singly occupied layers .",
    "the next to leading order vanishes after division by @xmath1 and the energy difference saturates at constant asymptotic values reached within about 10% when @xmath166 .    the shifts are not included in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] since they strongly depend on which inter - layer interaction we are trying to simulate . with a shift corresponding to @xmath167 , @xmath168 ,",
    "the double string is never bound for any value of @xmath1 .",
    "this is not surprising since two particles in different layers then have zero binding and therefore can not supply any binding to the total system . if the two - body binding is given by @xmath169 all @xmath170 curves in fig .",
    "[ fig5 ] should be translated @xmath171 units downwards .",
    "then any number of layers are bound as long as @xmath95 is less than about @xmath25 .",
    "the @xmath172 results are qualitatively very similar .",
    "they also increase and approach constants as function of @xmath1 with increasing values as function of @xmath95 .",
    "the chief difference is that the @xmath172 energies are about 1.5 units of energy less than the corresponding @xmath170 energy .",
    "this occurs because the effective @xmath95 value is always less for @xmath172 ( see the discussion following eq .",
    "( [ energy ] ) ) , so the @xmath172 chain is experiencing a weaker repulsion than the @xmath170 system .",
    "this weaker repulsion means that the larger zero - point shifts in @xmath172 make the string - binding energy smaller in @xmath172 .",
    "the stability of a double string against two separate strings must obviously depend on the amount of repulsion between the strings .",
    "this arises entirely from the intra - layer @xmath95-dependence in the double string energy .",
    "we show the results for both @xmath96 and @xmath108 in fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] as function of @xmath95 for a large value of @xmath173 where the asymptotic region is reached as seen in fig .",
    "the inaccurately determined shift energy is again not included but for @xmath174 the shift amounts to about @xmath175 for @xmath96 for @xmath176 , respectively , and twice these amounts for @xmath108 .",
    "it is then easy to see at which @xmath95-value a large number of layers become unstable . for fewer than @xmath177 layers the stability reaches to larger values of @xmath95 .",
    "these results are almost totally independent of @xmath146 since all energies for large @xmath164 are proportional to @xmath146 .",
    "this includes the zero - point energies and the critical strength , @xmath178 , where the separation energies are zero , therefore remains the same .",
    "instability then occurs for the same repulsion , @xmath95 , and the same number of layers , @xmath1 , for all large inter - layer interaction frequencies , @xmath146 . on the other hand ,",
    "the value of @xmath148 is crucial for the actual estimates .",
    "the @xmath108 results are again qualitatively very similar .",
    "the separation energies also increase with increasing values of @xmath95 .",
    "the string separation energies in figs .",
    "[ fig5 ] and [ fig4 ] are about @xmath157 energy units larger for @xmath96 than for @xmath108 , that is for this choice of @xmath147 .",
    "the reasoning here is the same as for the previous plot , that is the centrifugal barrier present for @xmath108 effectively lowers the value of @xmath95 .",
    "the energy is dependent on the square root of @xmath95 , and that dependence is seen in the shape of the curves in figure  [ fig4 ] .",
    "the intra - layer extreme short - range repulsion has properties differing from the long - range @xmath141 potential .",
    "we calculate again spectra , two - body in - layer radii , and string separation energies .",
    "the total spectrum has precisely the same inter - layer contribution as shown in fig .",
    "the center - of - mass term is trivially also the same .",
    "the differences in the total spectrum are therefore contained in the @xmath1 different intra - layer energies .",
    "we therefore consider the energy expressions given in eqs .",
    "( [ energyb1 ] ) and ( [ energyb2 ] ) corresponding to @xmath179 , respectively .",

    "these spectra in both @xmath96 and @xmath108 are discussed in @xcite .",
    "the oscillator sequence of excited states appears for all values of this ratio , while integer and half integer values of the principal quantum number result for large and small scattering lengths , respectively .",
    "the difference to our application is only that the length unit is @xmath107 instead of the trap length defined in eq ( [ vari ] ) .",
    "this changes the scattering lengths in these units to much smaller values , and the asymptotic spectra are therefore reached for much smaller @xmath181-values .",

    "the resulting universal curves are shown in fig .",
    "[ fig8 ] for the ground and lowest excited states states in both @xmath96 and @xmath108 .",
    "the decreasing behavior for @xmath96 reflects the decreasing repulsion , with the opposite behavior for @xmath108 where the repulsion increases with increasing scattering length .    the separation energy between two coupled strings is again calculated for the delta - function repulsion .",
    "we show the results for @xmath96 and @xmath108 in fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] as function of layer number , @xmath1 , for different scattering lengths . as for the @xmath141 potential",
    ", we find the same behavior of an increase towards a constant large-@xmath1 value .",
    "this asymptotic energy also increases with the repulsive strength .",
    "we have still to translate the energy scale by the shift value in order to find critical @xmath1-values for given repulsion .",
    "the results for @xmath96 and @xmath108 are qualitatively similar , although with the order reversed as increasing repulsion is in opposite directions of changing scattering lengths .",
    "the stability of a double string against two separate strings can be extracted from fig .",
    "the separation energy is shown as function of decreasing repulsion for @xmath183 where the asymptotic region is reached as seen in fig .",
    "this dependence arise entirely from the intra - layer @xmath184-dependence in the double string energy .",
    "the two - body intra - layer energies reach asymptotic values for extreme scattering lengths , which causes the many - body energies to also flatten out .",
    "the other contributions , including the energy shift , are independent of the two - body repulsion and discussed in connection with the @xmath141 potential .",
    "again , instability therefore occurs for the same repulsion , @xmath182 , and the same number of layers , @xmath1 , for all large inter - layer interaction frequencies , @xmath146 .",
    "the energies move in opposite directions between @xmath96 and @xmath108 given the opposite dependence of repulsive strength and scattering length magnitude in the different dimensions .",
    "the scattering length dependent intra - layer excitation energies for the delta - function potential are , like in the case of the @xmath141 potential , mostly higher than the string excitations .",
    "however , in the case of a long string in @xmath96 , some of the highest string excitations become higher in energy than the lowest intra - layer excitation . to give a sense of scale , the highest string excitation approaches @xmath185 @xmath186 when @xmath187 . for a range of scattering lengths ,",
    "the lowest intra layer excitation is around @xmath188 @xmath186 .",
    "this excitation occurs in the outermost layers , the interior layers excitations are all higher than the string excitations ( coming in around 8.14 @xmath186 ) . in two dimensions ,",
    "the intra layer excitations are higher such that none of them are lower than a string excitation , even for very long strings .",
    "we have formulated a prescription for a tremendous reduction of certain @xmath0-body problems to an @xmath1-body oscillator problem and @xmath1 two - body problems .",
    "the conditions are rather severe but at least fulfilled for a number of experimentally relevant one and two - dimensional systems .",
    "the method is valid for a group of particles which can be separated topologically in @xmath1 groups ( layers or tubes or other separable structures ) , each containing at most two arbitrarily interacting particles .",
    "all other one- and two - body interactions must be modelled by harmonic oscillator potentials .",
    "the reduction of a theoretical problem to many two - body problems is an enormous simplification .",
    "the schrdinger equation for nearly any interaction can be solved for two particles at least numerically , and other observables such as momentum distributions are easily calculated .",
    "if these two - body spectra are calculated , then statistical and thermodynamic quantities are also easily obtained , since the statistical properties of oscillators are also well known .",
    "decoupling of the many degrees - of - freedom is only achieved for equal masses of the two particles in each group .",
    "different masses are allowed for different groups .",
    "furthermore , two averages of the squares of specific oscillator frequencies must be equal .",
    "these interactions are related to the four interactions between pairs of particles in two groups .",
    "if one group only contains one particle it is allowed to have an arbitrary mass , and the identical averages still hold by insertion of zero interactions related to the removed particles .",
    "thus , we have one frequency constraint among four freqencies , where the most natural solution is that all these interactions are equal .",
    "we emphasize that this amounts to two conditions , that is equal masses in each group , and equal interactions between two groups , but both masses and interactions are allowed to vary between groups and pairs of groups .",
    "the result of these assumptions is total decoupling of degrees - of - freedom describing the relative oscillator motion between the center - of - masses of the groups , motion of the pairs in each layer , and the total center - of - mass motion within the external field .",
    "the @xmath189-body problem is then reduced to an analytic @xmath1-body oscillator problem , @xmath1 independent two - body problems , and one center - of - mass analytic oscillator problem .",
    "we illustrate how to apply the method by calculation of a number of basic properties in both one and two spatial dimensions .",
    "we choose two analytically solvable intra - group repulsive interactions where one is the long - range inverse distance squared potential and the other is the extreme short - range delta - function .",
    "we first specify pertinent analytic properties of these interactions .",
    "then we collect the variables describing our system , that is , individual masses , the number of particles , the intra - group repulsive strength , one - body external oscillator frequency , inter - group frequency and related shift of this oscillator potential . in the calculations we choose as few parameters as possible while retaining a number of fairly realistic features .",
    "all masses and one - body potentials are equal which leave dependence on them in the simple scaling through a choice of length and energy units .",
    "the inter - group frequencies are chosen to be identical for all particles in topologically neighboring groups and zero for all other inter - group potentials .",
    "we are left with one inter - group frequency , the intra - group repulsive strengths , and the number of groups ( layers or tubes ) .",
    "we first discuss the inter - group spectrum depending on @xmath1 and inter - group interaction frequency .",
    "we show the saturation of these energies per particle reached for large @xmath1 at values increasing linearly with inter - group frequency .",
    "the intra - group spectra are independent of @xmath1 for large @xmath1 and exactly given as function of repulsive strength in the effective intra - group oscillator units arising by combination of external trap and inter - group frequencies .",
    "all other intra - group properties , like root mean square radii , also only depend on the strength in such units .",
    "the inverse distance squared potential has very small dimensional dependence .",
    "the delta - function potential , characterized by scattering length , @xmath190 , leads superficially to very different behavior for @xmath96 and @xmath108 , since positive and increasing @xmath122 corresponds to decreasing repulsion while the opposite is true for @xmath135 in two dimensions .",
    "the total energy is calculated as the sum of all three ( inter , intra and cm ) parts .",
    "we calculate the total energy difference between doubly occupied groups and two times singly occupied groups .",
    "this energy is then the separation energy for this double string structure into two single strings . for both intra - group repulsive interactions and for both @xmath96 and @xmath108",
    "we find that this energy difference saturates at constant values for large @xmath1 .",
    "we calculate the saturation values as function of the repulsive strengths .",
    "we can then in principle predict whether these structures are stable against string separation . for this",
    "we need to insert the energy gained by two interacting particles in different groups .",
    "this energy shift would depend strongly on the initial two - body interaction , unspecified in the present paper .",
    "we estimate a range of values and provide crude estimates of critical group number for stability for different repulsion and different dimensions .    in summary ,",
    "we have discussed a versatile tool to calculate approximately a number of properties of structures separated topologically in groups with at most two particles in each .",
    "we demonstrate the capacity of the method by computing various energies as function of the variables describing the system , that is group number , spatial dimension , and intra- and inter - group one- and two - body interactions . a number of practically appearring systems can now be realistically approximated and investigated , that is for example dipolar particles in layer and tube structures . in the case of multiple layers ,",
    "this was considered within a purely harmonic approach for chains with two or more particles per layer both at zero @xcite and finite temperature @xcite . in those studies the intralayer interaction was",
    "harmonic and modelling repulsive intralayer forces is therefore a delicate matter @xcite . in comparison ,",
    "the model present in the present paper allows for different choices of the intralayer interaction other than harmonic .",
    "in particular , for two chains per layer one may include the @xmath191 intralayer repulsion that dipoles have when their dipoles moments are polarized perpendicular to the layer , and thus investigate the chain - chain dynamics .",
