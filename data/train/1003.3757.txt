    "the landau hydrodynamical model @xcite is a simple approximate solution of the hydrodynamical equations describing the expansion of a thin disk of static gas .",
    "the original idea was to use hydrodynamics to describe collisions of very high energy hadrons , when a large number of new particles are created .",
    "today the model is also frequently applied to the expansion of the quark gluon plasma ( qgp ) formed in ultra - relativistic heavy ion collisions .",
    "it provides a good description of the shape of the rapidity distribution of pions @xcite .",
    "the initial state of the landau hydrodynamical model is a thin static disk of thickness @xmath0 and diameter @xmath1 .",
    "it is assumed to be the approximation of the overlap of two highly lorentz contracted nuclei , and the two geometrical sizes are assumed to be related by @xmath2 with @xmath3 the lorentz factor corresponding to the velocity of the colliding nuclei in the center - of - mass frame , @xmath4 where @xmath5 is the invariant collision energy per colliding nucleons of mass @xmath6 .",
    "the hydrodynamical evolution of the system is divided in two parts : the initial longitudinal expansion ( during which transverse velocities and displacements are neglected ) , and the subsequent `` conic flight '' , where transverse velocities appear .    assuming a simple equation of state ( eos ) of the form @xmath7 an approximate solution of the 1 + 1 dimensional problem of the longitudinal expansion phase is given by landau @xcite .",
    "this solution is summarized ( using the notation of @xcite ) as follows .",
    "the energy - density field is @xmath8 where @xmath9 are logarithmic light - cone coordinates @xmath10 and @xmath11 is the initial energy - density of the disk .",
    "the rapidity field is @xmath12 in the longitudinal expansion components of the flow four - velocity are expressed in terms of the flow rapidity as @xmath13 which can be inverted to give @xmath14 looking at ( [ eq : rapi_field ] ) one observes that the flow rapidity and the space - time rapidity coordinate coincide ( the first expression in ( [ eq : rapi_field ] ) is exactly the definition of space - time rapidity ) , similarly to the case of the bjorken model . because of",
    "the coincidence of flow rapidity and space - time rapidity the space - time coordinates of a fluid element and the components of its four - velocity are related by @xmath15 where we have introduced the proper time coordinate @xmath16 .    in refs .",
    "@xcite an estimate of the transverse displacement of the system is given as @xmath17 the transition to the second phase of `` conic flight '' is assumed to happen when this transverse displacement reaches the transverse size of the system , @xmath1 . using the relations eq .",
    "( [ eq : u_z_t ] ) the condition of transition to conic flight can be written as @xmath18 this defines a hypersurface in space - time , which we call the transition hypersurface .",
    "although @xcite give a sketch of the hydrodynamical evolution of the system in the second phase of conic flight , in the calculation of observables they assume that freeze - out happens immediately , i.e.  not only the flight angle @xmath19 of fluid elements is assumed to be frozen on the transition hypersurface defined by eq .",
    "( [ eq : tr_cond ] ) , but also the fluid is replaced by an ensemble of non - interacting particles traveling with the same constant velocity .",
    "thus , the transition hypersurface is also the freeze - out ( fo ) hypersurface ( and the subscripts tr and fo can be interchanged ) .",
    "the velocity of particles is assumed to coincide with the velocity of the fluid element at the fo hypersurface , which means that no smearing effect coming from the thermal distribution of particles in the fluid is taken into account .",
    "equation ( [ eq : tr_cond ] ) gives a relation between the time of freeze - out and the position of the fluid element at freeze - out of the form @xmath20 this means that at the freeze - out the system can be described in terms of functions of one variable , say @xmath21 .",

    "( [ eq : tr_cond2 ] ) @xmath37 and changing the integration variable @xmath26 to @xmath27 gives @xmath38 the @xmath22 and @xmath23 integrations give a factor @xmath39 so finally @xmath40 we now assume that the transverse component of the velocity is negligible , so @xmath41 and @xmath42 are given by ( [ eq : u_y ] ) at fo too .",
    "therefore @xmath43 we assume that qgp is an ensemble of massless quarks and gluons , and obeys the stefan - boltzmann eos , @xmath44 ( which is consistent with ( [ eq : eos ] ) ) . in that case @xmath45 where we have used eq .  ( [ eq : e_field ] ) in the last step .",

    "@xmath86 is unit four - vector normal to the fo hypersurface . in the landau model",
    "this is given by @xmath87 ( see ( [ eq : dsigma_mu2 ] ) and ( [ eq : u_mu ] ) ) .",

    "this in turn suggests that the collective motion of the medium is developed already at the constituent quark level , and is basically unchanged during the process of recombination . in practice",
    "this means that the medium can be modeled by an ensemble of constituent quarks and antiquarks when one studies collective observables such as momentum spectra of abundant particles .    in this",
    "approach pions need a special treatment because  due to their small mass  they can not be described by the recombination of a constituent quark and antiquarks of mass @xmath1060.3 gev .",
    "indeed , pions are special in the sense that they are the goldstone bosons associated with the breaking of chiral symmetry , which is responsible for the generation of hadron masses .    based on the above we",
    "can model the post fo hadronic medium by an ensemble containing pions in addition to constituent @xmath107 , @xmath108 and @xmath93 quarks and their antiquarks .",
    "we will assume the values @xmath109  gev and @xmath110  gev for the constituent quark ( cq ) masses , and use the degeneracy factors @xmath111 where we have taken into account the number of colors @xmath112 the spin degeneracy factor of 2 , and another factor of 2 for the inclusion of antiquarks .",
    "we assume that the explicit inclusion of pions does not affect the degeneracy of the quarks .",
    "this is justified e.g.  if pions are formed earlier than other hadrons .",
    "as another possibility , the medium can be modeled by a hadron gas containing low mass hadron states , like pion , nucleon , kaon , @xmath113 , @xmath114 , and @xmath115 mesons , and @xmath0 particles .",

    "the integral ( [ eq : dn_dy_thermal ] ) was calculated numerically .",
    "the author of @xcite discusses a few possible corrections to the landau model .",
    "one of them is related to the fact that the initial compression of system depends on the eos , therefore the thickness of the initial state can deviate from the value obtained by taking into account solely the lorentz contraction of the nuclei .",
    "the other possible correction comes from the observation that an arbitrary multiplicative factor can be inserted in the condition of transition to conic flight , eq .",
    "( [ eq : tr_cond ] ) , since this equation expresses only a rough equality of the transverse displacement and the transverse system size .",

    "an overestimation of the pion yield with the same factor is a natural consequence .    in the experimental analysis of @xcite",

    "based on a simple geometrical model describing the colliding nuclei as spheres with uniformly distributed nucleons the average number of participants in this experimental sample is 88% of the number of participants in a central collision . assuming that the pion multiplicity scales with the number of participants this means that a model valid for central collisions should give a factor of @xmath140 larger result for the pion multiplicity .",
