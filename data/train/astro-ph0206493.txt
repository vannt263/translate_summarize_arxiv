    "accretion - powered millisecond pulsars , the presumed progenitors of millisecond radio pulsars , have proven surprisingly elusive for 20 years .",
    "the first example , the x - ray transient sax j1808.4@xmath03658 ( @xmath7401 hz , @xmath82 hr ) , was identified as a millisecond pulsar only four years ago @xcite .",
    "this only deepened the puzzle of why more examples are not known , since sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 is very similar to many of the @xmath9 neutron stars in low - mass x - ray binaries ( lmxbs ) that are not known pulsars @xcite .",
    "earlier this year , a second system was detected , the x - ray transient xte j1751@xmath0305 ( @xmath7 435 hz , @xmath1042.4 min ; markwardt et al .",
    "we report here on the discovery of a third example , again with a very short binary period .",
    "the faint x - ray transient xte  j0929@xmath0314 ( @xmath11 , @xmath12 ) was discovered by the all sky monitor ( asm ) on the _ rossi x - ray timing explorer ( rxte ) _ in 2002 april @xcite . a brief scanning observation with _ rxte",
    "_ detected persistent 185  hz pulsations @xcite , and further timing revealed a circular , 43.6-min binary orbit @xcite .",
    "the high galactic latitude makes this source ideal for multiwavelength study .",
    "variable optical @xcite and radio @xcite counterparts were detected at the x - ray source position measured with the _ chandra x - ray observatory _",
    "( juett et al . 2002 , in preparation ) , and / @xmath1346404650 and h@xmath14 @xmath156563 emission lines were reported in the optical spectrum @xcite . in this letter",
    ", we present a detailed analysis of the _ rxte _ observations .",
    "xte  j0929@xmath0314 is the faintest new transient discovered by the _ rxte _ all - sky monitor ( asm ; * ? ? ?",
    "this 1.512  kev instrument consists of three scanning shadow cameras which provide 90  s exposures of most points on the sky every 96  min .",
    "xte  j0929@xmath0314 was identified using a `` deep sky map '' technique , in which a map of flux residuals is constructed by cross - correlating the predicted coded mask pattern against the best - fit data residuals for each @xmath16 cell in the field of view .",
    "maps are made for each asm camera , using all of the low - background exposures in a given week .",
    "this allows more sensitive searches for new sources ( as low as @xmath17  mcrab away from the galactic center ) compared to the @xmath18 mcrab threshold for x - ray error boxes derived from individual camera snapshots .",
    "after xte  j0929@xmath0314 was identified by asm , we obtained a series of pointed _ rxte _ observations of the source during 2002 may 2  june 24 ( mjd 5239652449 ) .",
    "our analysis is primarily based on data from the _ rxte _ proportional counter array ( pca ; jahoda et al .",
    "1996 ) , which consists of five identical gas - filled proportional counter units ( pcus ) with a total effective area of @xmath19 and sensitivity to x - ray photons in the 2.560  kev range . for all our pca observations ,",
    "the data were collected in goodxenon mode ( in addition to the standard data modes ) , which records the arrival time ( 1  @xmath2s    = 8.5 cm    resolution ) and energy ( 256 channel resolution ) of every unrejected photon .",
    "we estimated the background flux using the `` cm '' faint - source model for pca gain epoch 5 ( from 2000 may 13 ) .",
    "the photon arrival times at the spacecraft were converted to barycentric dynamical times ( tdb ) at the solar system barycenter using the jet propulsion laboratory de-200 solar system ephemeris @xcite along with a spacecraft ephemeris and _ rxte _ fine clock corrections .",
    "the position adopted was that of the optical counterpart @xcite .",
    "data from the 20200  kev high - energy x - ray timing experiment ( hexte ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) were also used to characterize the hard x - ray spectrum .",
    "the asm and pca intensity history of xte j0929@xmath0314 is shown in figure  1 .",
    "the asm 1.512  kev count rate began rising around mjd  52370 and peaked at @xmath20 ( @xmath2131  mcrab ) on mjd  52394 .",
    "the initial scanning pca observation occurred 2  d later , when the decay had already begun . over the following 20",
    "d the source faded steadily , holding briefly at 10  mcrab on mjd  52420 before declining below the detection limit .",
    "the last 3@xmath22 pca detection was on mjd  52443 at a flux of @xmath23 ( 210 kev ) . for subsequent pca observations",
    ", the flux was below the @xmath24 detection threshold of @xmath25 ( 210  kev ; or @xmath26 , 260  kev ) .",
    "the estimated 260  kev fluence over the entire outburst was @xmath27 .",
    "the combined pca and hexte x - ray spectra were consistent with an absorbed power law+blackbody model , with photon index @xmath281.72.0 , blackbody temperature @xmath290.50.9  kev , and absorption column density @xmath30  @xmath31 .",
    "for most of the observations we detected the source up to 50  kev .",
    "we estimated the bolometric correction as the mean ratio of the integrated 260  kev to 210  kev flux , @xmath32 .",
    "no x - ray bursts were detected in the data .    for our timing analysis , we selected photons from the top layer of each pcu in the energy range 313  kev ( absolute channels 730 ) in order to maximize the pulsed signal to noise ratio .",
    "we binned the arrival times for these photons into @xmath33  s ( @xmath340.5 ms ) samples .",
    "an 185  hz pulsed signal was easily detectable in these data , with a fractional rms amplitude of between 3 and 7% .",
    "the pulse profile in the initial pca observation on mjd 52396 contained a weak secondary maximum , but it was broad and single - peaked in all subsequent observations except for the interval mjd  5242552430 , when a second peak was again present ( figure 2 ) .",
    "the last 3@xmath22 detection of pulsations was on mjd 52442 , when the source flux was @xmath35 ( 210 kev ) .",
    "a @xmath211  hz quasi - periodic oscillation ( fwhm=0.21  hz ) with @xmath215% rms amplitude was detected during most of the observations .",
    "we investigated the energy - dependence of the pulse properties by extracting pulse profiles in nine distinct energy bands from one of the longer pca observations on mjd 52408 .",
    "the rms strength of the pulsation decreased from around 5% at 24  kev to 2.5% at 10  kev .",
    "comparison of the pulse phase in each energy band indicated that significant soft lags were present . for each energy band between 2.5 and 10.5  kev",
    "the pulse arrival time was earlier than in the adjacent lower energy band , with a cumulative difference of 770  @xmath2s .",
    "the energy dependence of both the rms strength and the phase lag of the pulsation appeared to flatten above 10  kev ; there were insufficient counts to explore the dependence above 20  kev .",
    "similar phase lags were observed in the millisecond pulsations from sax  j1808.4@xmath03658 , but that source did not show a similar energy dependence for the pulsed amplitude ( cui , morgan , & titarchuk 1998 ; ford 2000 ) .",
    "we will present a more detailed analysis of the pulse shape variations elsewhere .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm    the 185  hz pulsation showed a clear doppler modulation , and we used a fourier frequency history to fit a preliminary orbital model ( galloway et al .",
    "we then applied a more precise analysis using the pulse phase techniques commonly employed in radio pulsar timing ( see , e.g. , manchester & taylor 1977 ) . adopting our preliminary orbital model ,",
    "we epoch - folded 43.6  min intervals of data ( thus averaging over periodic phase residuals caused by errors in our assumed orbital parameters ) and used the resulting linear drift in phase residuals to refine our knowledge of the pulsar s spin frequency .",
    "then , we combined this refined spin frequency and the preliminary orbital model to epoch - fold 256  s intervals of data .",
    "the resulting phase residuals were used to compute differential corrections to our keplerian orbit model ( see , e.g. , deeter , boynton , & pravdo 1981 ) .",
    "no significant eccentricity was detectable , but a spin frequency derivative substantially improved the fit .",
    "our best - fit orbit and spin parameters for the pulsar are given in table  1 .",
    "the pulse time delays due to the orbit , as well as the effect of fitting a constant - frequency model are shown in figure  3 .",
    "from the presence of persistent millisecond pulsations over a wide luminosity range in xte  j0929@xmath0314 , we can infer an upper limit on the pulsar s surface dipole magnetic field strength of @xmath36  g from accretion torque theory ( psaltis & chakrabarty 1999 ) .",
    "this is consistent with the expectation that the neutron star is a recycled pulsar whose magnetic field has decayed during prolonged mass transfer ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the system has binary parameters that are extremely similar to those of the other recently discovered millisecond x - ray pulsar xte j1751@xmath0305 ( markwardt et al .",
    "2002 ) as well as the slow ( 7.6  s ) accreting x - ray pulsar 4u 1626@xmath067 ( middleditch et al . 1981 ; schulz et al .",
    "2001 ) , pointing to a similar evolutionary path .",
    "a puzzling aspect is that , unlike the two millisecond pulsars , the lmxb 4u  1626@xmath067 has a strong ( @xmath37 g ) magnetic field in addition to its slow spin period , which may indicate that its neutron star was formed recently through accretion - induced collapse ( see yungelson , nelemans , & van den heuvel 2002 and references therein ) .        43.6  min binary is ( faulkner 1971 ) @xmath38 where @xmath39 and @xmath40 are the neutron star and companion masses , respectively .",
    "if we assume that the mass accretion rate during the outburst is at least as large as @xmath41 , then our non - detection at the end of the outburst requires a distance @xmath42  kpc .",
    "also , given an outburst recurrence time of @xmath43  yr ( the time since _ rxte _ was launched ) , the 2002 outburst fluence implies a mean mass transfer rate equal to @xmath41 for @xmath44  kpc .",
    "we thus conclude that the source lies at least 1.2  kpc above the galactic plane .",
    "our limits indicate that the mass accretion rate @xmath45 during the outburst was not more than a few percent of the eddington critical rate .",
    "the detection of spin - down during the outburst may provide an opportunity to test accretion torque theory for x - ray pulsars in the low-@xmath46 regime .",
    "the torque on a magnetic star from a prograde accretion disk tends to spin - up the star for sufficiently high @xmath45 , while accretion will be centrifugally inhibited ( the so - called `` propeller '' regime ) for sufficiently low @xmath45 .",
    "however , for an intermediate range of @xmath45 , the positive material torque due to accretion may be dominated by a spin - down torque due to one of a variety of mechanisms , even while accretion persists .",
    "two possible spin - down mechanisms include magnetic coupling of the accretion disk and the magnetosphere ( ghosh & lamb 1979 , 1991 ) and expulsion of a centrifugally driven magnetohydrodynamic wind ( anzer & brner 1980 ; arons et al .",
    "1984 ; lovelace et al . 1995 ) .",
    "in either case , the torque should not exceed the characteristic accretion torque @xmath47 ( where @xmath48=50  km is the pulsar s corotation radius ) , which is consistent with our measured @xmath49 for @xmath42  kpc .",
    "another possible mechanism is gravitational radiation by the rapidly spinning pulsar ( bildsten 1998 ; andersson , kokkotas , & stergioulas 1999 ; levin 1999 ) .",
    "some of these issues can be explored by examining the relation between @xmath45 and @xmath49 , which has been done extensively for high-@xmath46 neutron stars ( e.g. , bildsten et al .",
    "1997 ) but never for the low-@xmath46 case .",
    "a detailed analysis of the @xmath45-@xmath49 correlation will first require a better understanding of the pulse shape variations , in order to limit systematic uncertainties in the frequency history .",
    "such work is currently in progress .",
    "white dwarfs and neutron stars accreting from a hydrogen - rich companion can not evolve to binary periods below about 80  min , corresponding to the so - called `` period minimum '' observed for most cataclysmic variables and lmxbs ( paczynski & sienkiewicz 1981 ; rappaport , joss , & webbink 1982 ) . ultracompact ( @xmath50  min ) binaries like xte  j0929@xmath0314  must therefore have a low - mass , hydrogen - depleted ( and probably degenerate ) donor ( nelson , rappaport , & joss 1986 ) .",
    "our measured orbital parameters further constrain the nature of the donor in this system . the pulsar mass function , @xmath51 ,",
    "is the smallest presently known for any stellar binary .",
    "this mass function gives a minimum companion mass ( @xmath52 ) of @xmath53 @xmath54 for @xmath55 ; it also implies @xmath56 ( 95% confidence ) for a uniform a priori distribution in @xmath57 ( @xmath58 ) .",
    "the mass - radius relation for a roche - lobe  filling donor in a 43.6  min binary is @xmath59 @xcite .",
    "as expected , this has no intersection with the theoretical mass - radius relation for very low - mass hydrogen - rich stars ( i.e. brown dwarfs , chabrier et al .",
    "2000 ; cf .",
    "bildsten & chakrabarty 2001 ) . a very low - mass cold helium white dwarf ( zapolsky & salpeter 1969",
    "; nelemans et al . 2001 ) is easily consistent for masses of @xmath60 , implying that the system has a relatively high ( and thus probable ) inclination .",
    "we note that a cold carbon white dwarf is not consistent with our measured orbital parameters ( lai , abrahams , & shapiro 1991 )",
    ". it may be possible for a helium dwarf donor to retain a small residual hydrogen content ( podsiadlowski , rappaport , & pfahl 2002 ) ; this is of particular interest , given the report of an h@xmath14 @xmath156563 emission line in the optical spectrum ( castro - tirado et al .",
    "2002 ) .",
    "binary evolution theory predicts that many ( if not most ) of the @xmath2150 known neutron stars in lmxbs are spinning at millisecond periods ( bhattacharya & van den heuvel 1991 ) . of these , only three are now known pulsars , with persistent millisecond pulsations during their x - ray active states .",
    "all three are low - luminosity transients in very close binaries , with extremely small time - averaged @xmath45 ; evidently , millisecond pulsations are easier to detect in such systems .",
    "this supports the suggestion that magnetic screening by freshly accreted material may prevent the formation of persistent x - ray pulses in ns / lmxbs with @xmath45 above a critical value ( cumming , zweibel , & bildsten 2001 ) .",
    "we are grateful to jean swank , evan smith , and the _ rxte _ operations team at nasa / gsfc for their help in scheduling these target - of - opportunity observations .",
    "we also thank lars bildsten , fred lamb , al levine , dimitrios psaltis and saul rappaport for useful discussions .",
    "this work was supported in part by nasa under grant nag 5 - 9184 and contract nas 5 - 30612 ."
