    "galaxy cluster scaling relations are fundamental tools for connecting cluster astrophysics to cosmology .",
    "these scaling relations are typically expressed within the framework of the self - similar model @xcite , which predicts that power - law relations should exist between basic properties of clusters ( mass , luminosity , temperature , etc . )",
    "unless some physical process occurs to produce a characteristic scale and break the self - similarity .    in this work",
    "the scaling relation of particular interest is the @xmath3-@xmath6 relation .",
    "this relation connects the x - ray luminosity of the hot gas in a galaxy cluster ( ideally the bolometric luminosity ) to the total mass @xmath6 of the cluster .",
    "the self - similar prediction for this relation is that @xmath7 @xcite assuming the x - ray luminosity is dominated by thermal bremsstrahlung .",
    "a number of studies have estimated the @xmath3-@xmath6 relation for galaxy clusters ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "they typically find slopes in the range of 1.6 - 2.0 , which is significantly steeper than the predicted value of 4/3 . some of this discrepancy may be due to redshift evolution and    mass - dependence of the temperature and density profiles ( @xcite , @xcite ) , but the majority is usually attributed to non - gravitational heating , either by changing the entropy of the gas @xcite or through its indirect impact on the baryon fraction of the halo @xcite .    non - gravitational heating is also thought to play an important role in the formation and evolution of galaxies and galaxy groups , and there are a number of theoretical predictions for the behavior of the x - ray luminosity of these lower - mass systems .",
    "generally these studies focus on the @xmath3-@xmath8 relation rather than the @xmath3-@xmath6 relation , but temperature and mass are tightly linked in hydrostatic equilibrium , so these relations have similar qualitative behavior . a common prediction from large - scale cosmological simulations ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , but also see @xcite ) is a steepening of the decline in @xmath3 as the halo mass decreases , below @xmath9 kev ( @xmath10 ) . in many cases ,",
    "this break is caused by active galactic nucleus ( agn ) feedback .",
    "specifically , as pointed out by @xcite and @xcite , the so - called `` thermal blast '' prescription for agn feedback in these simulations raises the cooling time of the intragroup gas above the hubble time , converting these galaxy groups into non - cool - core objects .",
    "in contrast , gentler `` self - regulated '' mechanical feedback ( acting through outflows which induce x - ray buoyant bubbles , weak shocks , and the uplift of low - entropy gas and metals ) preserves the cool core and therefore typically produces no break ( @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "we can therefore learn more about agn feedback if we can extend observations of cluster x - ray scaling relations down to the regime of galaxies and galaxy groups .",
    "this has posed a formidable challenge , however , due to the lower x - ray luminosity of these less massive systems .",
    "previous observational studies of galaxy groups disagree about whether a @xmath11 kev break exists in the @xmath3-@xmath8 relation ( @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , @xcite ) , and the @xmath3-@xmath6 relation has only recently begun to be explored at these scales ( e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "so far , systematic studies of the @xmath3-@xmath6 relation in low - mass groups and isolated galaxies have proven beyond the reach of current x - ray telescopes .",
    "other x - ray properties and scaling relations have been studied in galaxy - mass halos , however .",
    "the closest analogue to the @xmath3-@xmath6 relation is probably the @xmath3-@xmath12 relation ( or for more modern observations , the @xmath3-@xmath4 relation ) in elliptical galaxies , which relates the stellar content of an elliptical galaxy to the x - ray properties of its hot gaseous halo .",
    "the slope of this relation is also interesting , since it gives clues about the processes which govern the hot gaseous halo .",
    "unfortunately , the slope of this relation is difficult to measure either as a function of @xmath12 or @xmath4 .",
    "it seems to depend somewhat on the environment of the galaxies @xcite as well as on the degree of rotational support of the galaxy @xcite .",
    "even worse , the scatter in both @xmath3-@xmath12 and @xmath3-@xmath4 is extremely large ( an order of magnitude at @xmath13 ; @xcite ) which makes sample selection a particularly difficult issue .",
    "sample selection is also a major issue for the @xmath3-@xmath6 relation , since nearly every study ( with the notable exceptions of @xcite , @xcite , and @xcite ) relies on x - ray - selected clusters .",
    "this raises the issue of malmquist bias , which can have a very significant effect on the inferred @xmath3-@xmath6 relation @xcite .    in this study",
    ", we take a significant step towards alleviating all of the above issues .",
    "we examine an optically - selected sample of central galaxies , which is sensitive to different selection effects than x - ray selected samples .",
    "the sample contains @xmath0 galaxies , each selected to be the most luminous galaxy in its dark matter halo , spanning halos from intermediate - mass clusters down to galaxies about half the mass of the milky way .",
    "the selection criteria and basic properties of our sample are described in section 2 .    with our sample of uniformly - selected central galaxies",
    ", we can make the a uniform comparison of the x - ray luminosities of halos across galaxies , galaxy groups , and galaxy clusters for the first time . in order to make this comparison most effectively , and to detect the x - ray emission in lower - mass halos , we employ a stacking technique .",
    "this technique is detailed in section 3 .",
    "we present the results of our stacking in section 4 .",
    "finally , in section 5 we measure the @xmath3-@xmath5 relation and in section 6 we measure the @xmath3-@xmath14 relation . for both relations ,",
    "a single power - law describes the data from galaxy clusters all the way down to milky - way - mass halos .",
    "this suggests that the two relations are actually the same .",
    "we discuss the implications of this result in section 7 .",
    "in this paper we examine the sample of `` locally brightest galaxies '' ( lbgs ) introduced in @xcite ( hereafter p13 ) .",
    "full details of the sample selection are presented in that work , but we briefly summarize them here .    the lbgs are chosen from the new york university value - added galaxy catalog @xcite based on data release 7 from the sloan digital sky survey ( sdss ) .",
    "the goal is to select a population of central galaxies in dark matter halos . to do this , p13 selected galaxies with extinction - corrected petrosian @xmath15-magnitude @xmath16 and redshift @xmath17 which are brighter in @xmath15 than any other galaxy within 1 projected mpc and 1000 km s@xmath18 . to account for potential satellites without spectroscopic redshifts ,",
    "locally brightest galaxies were also required not to have any galaxies in the sdss photometric redshift 2 catalog @xcite with brighter @xmath15-magnitudes projected within 1 mpc and having a photometric redshift with a greater than 10% chance of being consistent with the redshift of the locally brightest galaxy .",
    "the total sample contains 259567 lbgs .    for each lbg",
    ", stellar masses have been estimated from the sdss photometry by @xcite .",
    "following p13 , we divided the sample into 20 bins , logarithmically spaced in stellar mass from log @xmath19 to log @xmath20 ( there are 9660 lbgs which lie outside this range in stellar mass and are discarded ; 35 are above the upper limit and 9625 are below the lower limit ) .",
    "the distribution of galaxies across stellar mass is presented in figure 1 .",
    "the sample is approximately flux - limited : sdss photometric completeness for galaxies at @xmath21 is essentially 100% , although spectroscopic completeness is lower due to fiber `` collisions '' where two or more galaxies fall within the same sdss fiber . checking the `",
    "fgot ` parameter from the value - added galaxy catalog , we find approximately 91% completeness for the locally brightest galaxy sample .",
    "we also note that the selection criteria may introduce subtle and complex biases compared to a purely flux - limited sample .        in order to better understand these biases ,",
    "we employ a catalog of simulated locally brightest galaxies originally generated for p13 . the procedure for generating",
    "this catalog starts with the millennium simulation @xcite which follows the evolution of cosmic structure within a box of comoving side length 500 @xmath22mpc .",
    "halo merger trees are complete for subhalos above a mass of @xmath23 .",
    "the original millennium simulation is based on wmap1 cosmology , and the rescaling technique of @xcite has been adopted to convert it to the wmap7 cosmology . a semi - analytic galaxy formation prescription @xcite has been applied to these simulated halos .",
    "the galaxy formation parameters have been adjusted to fit several statistical observables at @xmath24 , such as the luminosity , stellar mass and correlation functions of galaxies .",
    "we project the simulation box along the @xmath25-axis , and assign every galaxy an artificial redshift based on its line - of - sight distance and peculiar velocity , i.e. , parallel to the @xmath25-axis . in this way we can select a sample of galaxies from the simulation using isolation criteria exactly analogous to those used for the locally brightest galaxy sample from sdss .",
    "these simulations allowed p13 to match the stellar content of galaxies to dark matter halos from the millennium simulation , as well as to estimate the fraction of satellite galaxies or other failure modes in the sample .",
    "they find that the fraction of locally brightest galaxies which are centrals is over 83% across the sample .",
    "about 2/3 of the satellite lbgs are brighter than the central galaxy , while the other 1/3 are either more than 1 mpc from the central or are offset in velocity by more than 1000 km s@xmath18 .",
    "they also are able to estimate the relationship between @xmath14 and halo mass for galaxies in each stellar mass bin .",
    "they find that the satellite contamination biases the mean halo mass upwards fairly significantly in the lower - mass bins , but in general these satellite lbgs are significantly offset from the center of their massive halos and therefore do not appreciably bias the stacked signal .",
    "we therefore treat the terms `` locally brightest galaxy '' and `` central galaxy '' as approximately interchangeable throughout this work .",
    "this simulated catalog also allows estimation of `` effective '' halo masses for each stellar mass bin down to log @xmath26 . p13 computed halo masses by assuming self - similar scaling in the @xmath27-@xmath5 relation and assuming the @xcite pressure profile for the hot gas . since x - ray luminosity scales with the projected squared density instead of the projected density , the effective halo masses are slightly higher for x - ray emission .",
    "also , one of our conclusions is that the @xmath3-@xmath6 relation is not self - similar , so we instead use our best - fitting relation when computing the effective halo masses . in appendix",
    "a , we detail the derivation of our effective halo masses and compare with the masses used in p13 ; our effective halo masses are similar to those in p13 , and the halo masses seem to be fairly robust .",
    "the stellar masses , halo masses , and other derived quantities in both p13 and this work rely on an assumed wmap7 cosmology @xcite , with @xmath28 , @xmath29 , and @xmath30 km s@xmath18 mpc@xmath18 .",
    "we generally work with halo masses expressed as @xmath5 , the mass within a radius @xmath31 which encloses a mean density 500 times the critical density .",
    "we estimate @xmath31 from @xmath5 using the relation    @xmath32    the critical density of the universe , @xmath33 , has a redshift dependence , and we compute it at the mean distance @xmath34 of the galaxies in the bin , which is defined in section 3.1 .",
    "this redshift effect is small , since the highest effective redshift of any bin is 0.29 . for each stellar mass bin",
    ", the effective values of @xmath5 and @xmath31 we adopt are listed below in table 1 , along with @xmath34 and several other properties .    [ cols=\"^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]      +",
    "in order to test our hypothesis that x - ray flux selection is responsible for the previous overestimates of the normalization of the @xmath3-@xmath5 relation , in this appendix we impose an x - ray flux limit on our sample .",
    "we measure the flux from within @xmath31 for each galaxy , and only consider galaxies if they have a 0.5 - 2.0 kev observed - frame background - subtracted x - ray flux of at least @xmath35 erg s@xmath18 @xmath36 within @xmath31 .",
    "this flux limit is lower than the limit used by reflex @xcite .",
    "however , we use a fixed aperture of size @xmath31 while they employed an adaptive aperture , which allows them to maximize the s / n of each cluster .",
    "our flux limit still removes almost all of our sources : only 161 locally brightest galaxies remain , and above log @xmath37 and log @xmath38 there are only 2 and 8 objects respectively .",
    "contamination from agn and x - ray binaries also becomes more important , since we are now only considering a handful of objects .    in order to reduce the effects of this contamination , as well as to increase the number of data points available for fitting , we therefore eschew stacking entirely , and just fit a power - law relation with the form of equation 5 to the data",
    "this requires assuming a conversion from stellar mass to halo mass . for the simple exercise in this appendix , we use the conversion computed in section 5 for the full lbg sample ;",
    "the normalization of the relation cancels out so the slope is the major controlling parameter for this conversion and the slope we computed is in good agreement with other measurements ( see figure 6 ) .",
    "we therefore neglect the effect that the assumed slope has on the inferred halo masses .",
    "we also restrict our attention to the galaxies with stellar masses above log @xmath39 , since these have temperatures above 2 kev and provide a more direct comparison to other studies ( which have focused on galaxy clusters ) .",
    "note that this also decreases the effect of the slope of the @xmath3-@xmath5 relation on our inferred masses , since it focuses on the systems which are closer to our pivot point .",
    "there are 47 locally brightest galaxies within this mass range that fall above our flux limit .",
    "the best - fit @xmath3-@xmath5 relation to these data has a @xmath40 of 5.2 for 45 degrees of freedom , which is very low .",
    "this reflects the large measurement errors on each galaxy ( due to the fixed aperture size ) as well as the propagated uncertainty due to the bolometric correction for each galaxy .",
    "the best - fit slope is @xmath41 and the best - fit normalization is @xmath42 erg s@xmath18 ( @xmath43 uncertainties ) .",
    "the uncertainty on the slope is large ( due to the relatively narrow mass range ) , but if we fix the slope to be 1.84 ( the value we measure in section 5 , which is fully consistent with the value measured by other studies ) , then this gives us self - consistent estimates of the halo masses , and the best - fit normalization is @xmath44 erg s@xmath18 .",
    "both calculations clearly show that the normalization for the flux - limited sample is much higher than the inferred normalization for the full sample , and is much closer to the other x - ray flux - selected samples ."
