    "entanglement is a property which is central to quantum mechanics , with bipartite entanglement being readily producible experimentally .",
    "there has been some progress in the production of tripartite entangled beams , with the entanglement often obtained by mixing squeezed vacua with linear optical elements  @xcite . other methods which create the entanglement using an actual nonlinear interaction",
    "have been proposed , using both cascaded and concurrent @xmath0 processes  @xcite . in this article",
    "we investigate the fundamental limits to the achievable tripartite entanglement available from both the manipulation of squeezed states with beamsplitters and from a process which utilises concurrent nonlinearities .",
    "a two - mode system is considered to be bipartite entangled if the system density matrix can not be expressed as a product of density matrices for each of the two modes .",
    "the definition of tripartite entanglement for three - mode systems is a little more subtle , with different classes of entanglement having been defined , depending on how the system density matrix may be partitioned  @xcite .",
    "the classifications range from fully inseparable , which means that the density matrix is not separable for any grouping of the modes , to fully separable , where the three modes are not entangled in any way . for the fully inseparable case , van loock and furusawa  @xcite , who call this genuine tripartite entanglement , have derived inequalities which are easily applicable to continuous variable processes . in this work",
    "we will analyse two different hamiltonian processes in terms of these inequalities , as well as in terms of three - mode einstein - podolsky - rosen ( epr )  @xcite type criteria which we shall define .",
    "we note here that both these methods of detecting entanglement provide sufficient , but not necessary , conditions , so that one or the other may be more sensitive and useful in a given situation .",
    "we will first describe inequalities which , if violated , demonstrate that a system exhibits true continuous variable tripartite entanglement . for three modes described by the annihilation operators @xmath1 , where @xmath2 , we define quadrature operators for each mode as @xmath3 so that the heisenberg uncertainty principle requires @xmath4 .",
    "conditions sufficient to demonstrate continuous variable bipartite entanglement were developed by duan  @xcite and simon  @xcite .",
    "a set of conditions which are sufficient to demonstrate tripartite entanglement for any quantum state have been derived by van loock and furusawa  @xcite .",
    "using our quadrature definitions , the van loock - furusawa conditions give a set of inequalities , @xmath5 where @xmath6 .",
    "as shown in reference @xcite , the violation of the first condition still leaves the possibility that mode @xmath7 could be separated from modes @xmath8 and @xmath9 , but this possibility is negated by violation of the second inequality .",
    "starting with any one of the conditions thus shows that , if any two of these inequalities are violated , the system is fully inseparable and genuine tripartite entanglement is guaranteed .",
    "we note that genuine tripartite entanglement may still be possible when none of these inequalities is violated , due to the criteria being sufficient but not necessary .",
    "we also note here that the original van loock - furusawa correlations were written in a more complicated and general form , but for the symmetric systems we evaluate in this work , the form we have given is sufficient .",
    "the epr argument was introduced in 1935 in an attempt to show that quantum mechanics not be both complete and consistent with local realism  @xcite .",
    "schrdinger replied that same year by introducing the concept of entangled states which were not compatible with classical notions such as local realism  @xcite . in 1989",
    "reid  @xcite , and reid and drummond  @xcite proposed a physical test of the epr paradox using optical quadrature amplitudes , which are mathematically identical to the position and momentum originally considered by epr .",
    "reid later expanded on this work , demonstrating that the satisfaction of the 1989 two - mode epr criterion always implies bipartite quantum entanglement  @xcite .",
    "it was also shown by tan  @xcite that the existence of two orthogonal quadratures , the product of whose variances violates the limits set by the heisenberg uncertainty principle ( hup ) , provides evidence of entanglement .",
    "tan demonstrated this in the context of teleportation , with the outputs from a nondegenerate optical parameteric amplifier ( opa ) mixed on a beamsplitter . in this article",
    "we extend reid s original approach , based on an inferred hup between two quadratures , to the case of tripartite correlations , where quadratures of three different optical modes are involved . just as the definition of tripartite entanglement is more complex than that of bipartite entanglement , with different classes of entanglement having been defined depending on possible partitions of the system density matrix  @xcite",
    ", we find that there is more than one way to define epr correlations for a system exhibiting tripartite entanglement .",
    "we have used two of the possible methods in a previous publication  @xcite , while bowen have defined a third  @xcite . in this work",
    "we will give formal proofs that the correlations we defined previously also serve to demonstrate the presence of tripartite entanglement .",
    "_ genuine _ tripartite entanglement is verified if we rule out any bipartition of the density matrix ( @xmath10 ) , which is to say that the full system density matrix can not be expressed in _ any _ of the following forms @xmath11 if these factorisations are ruled out then so is the fully separable form @xmath12 .",
    "there are two forms of the criteria that we need to consider , arising from one and two mode inference .",
    "the first inference scheme that we will use to prove tripartite entanglement and epr correlations involves using experimental observations of two modes to infer properties of a third .",
    "the proof for this scheme is essentially the same as for the original bipartite entanglement result of @xcite ; nevertheless , the proof exposes a freedom in the derivation that we wish to draw attention to , so we reproduce it here .",

    "note that the exact form of the expression involving @xmath25 , @xmath26 used in the inference ( in this paper we deal with expressions of the form @xmath53 ) does not enter into the derivation .",
    "we see that in fact this separability measure is entirely independent of the way information about the remaining subsystem is used to infer properties of a single mode . to be specific ,",
    "if an @xmath54-mode system density matrix is separable in the form @xmath55 , then , regardless of the way information from @xmath56 is handled the inferred variances for mode k will satisfy the uncertainty relation @xmath57 , and the epr criteria for this kind of separability follows .",
