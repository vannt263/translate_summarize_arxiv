    "the breakup of liquid jets , that are injected through a circular nozzle into stagnant fluids , has been the subject of widespread research over the years .",
    "previous studies that followed the seminal works of lord rayleigh have established that the complex jet flow is influenced by a large number of parameters .",
    "these include nozzle internal flow effects , the jet velocity profile and the physical state of both liquid and gas .",
    "notwithstanding the fact that the hydrodynamic equations are nonlinear , the linear stability theory can provide qualitative descriptions of breakup phenomena and predict the existence of different breakup regimes .",
    "rayleigh showed @xcite by using a linear theory that the jet breakup is a consequence of hydrodynamic instability , or more exactly _",
    "capillary instability_. neglecting the effect of the ambient fluid , the viscosity of the jet liquid , and gravity , he demonstrated that a cylindrical liquid jet is unstable with respect to disturbances characterized by wavelengths larger than the jet circumference .",
    "he also considered the case of a viscous jet in an inviscid gas and an inviscid gas jet in an inviscid liquid @xcite .",
    "weber @xcite generalized rayleigh s result for the case of a _ newtonian _",
    "viscous liquid and showed that the viscosity tends to reduce the breakage rate and increase the drop size .",
    "chandrasekhchar @xcite considered the effect of a uniform magnetic field on the capillary instability of a liquid jet .",
    "a mechanism of bending disturbances and of buckling , slowly moving , highly viscous jets , was presented by taylor @xcite .",
    "further developments of the theory in newtonian liquids was concerned with additional factors such as the dynamic action of the ambient gas ( leading to atomization of the jet ) , the nonlinear interaction of growing modes that lead to satellite drop formation , and the spatial character of instability ( see @xcite , @xcite ) .",
    "the capillary instability in jets , comprised of _ non  newtonian _ suspensions and emulsions , presents a different category of cases which are governed by power  law ( pseudoplastic and dilatant ) liquids .",
    "the effective viscosity of the pseudoplastic liquid decreases with growth of strain rate , whereas in dilatant liquids , it increases @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of capillary jets of dilute and concentrated polymer solutions suggest a strong influence of the macromolecular coils on their flow patterns @xcite .",
    "free jets of polymeric liquids , that exhibit oscillations , are reported in @xcite .",
    "recently the idea of rayleigh instability was applied to tubular membranes in dilute lyotropic phases @xcite .",
    "their relaxation , following optical excitation , is characterized by a long time , and can be described by means of hydrodynamic approach @xcite . bending deformations of such membranes",
    "are governed by the helfrich energy @xcite which depends on the curvature of the tube .",
    "thus , competition between the surface tension and curvature energy of the water immersed membrane renders the initial shape of the tube unstable . the hydrodynamic formalism used in @xcite and the hydrodynamics of fluids with inner order such as liquid crystal ( lc ) @xcite have similar features . in @xcite the order parameter stands for a unit vector normal to the membrane surface .",
    "in contrast , the order parameter @xmath8 of a lc fluid , is defined throughout the space it occupies .",
    "the continuum theory of lc phases has emerged as a rigorous part of condensed matter theory .",
    "the hydrodynamics of the lc phases was developed during the 7080th and its predictions were successfully confirmed in many experimental observations . the combination of viscous and elastic properties is likely to produce new evolution patterns of hydrodynamic instabilities , in the context of benard  rayleigh , marangoni and electrohydrodynamic effects @xcite , which can not occur in ordinary liquids .",
    "however , its capillary instability , when in the form of a jet , was not considered as yet .",
    "in particular we refer to the _ uniaxial nematic _ phase .",
    "the instability of a lc jet poses an additional challenge with respect to the effects listed above .",
    "this applies already within the framework of linear stability theory .",
    "the lc class of fluids seems to provide a good example of unique properties , as compared to polymer solutions .",
    "the elastic properties of a lc are expected to change the evolution patterns of jets which are made from them . in this work",
    "we derive a rigorous mathematical model of capillary instability for isothermal incompressible nematic lc jets .",
    "this model shows how the combined viscous and elastic properties of lc fluids determine the boundary conditions at the free surface , and the range where instability prevails .",
    "in this section , we formulate first the problem of capillary instability and then derive the basic equations which govern the linear hydrodynamics of a liquid crystalline jet . the flow of a nematic lc is described by a set of differential equations supplemented by boundary conditions on the lc free surface : continuity equation , navier  stokes equation of visco ",
