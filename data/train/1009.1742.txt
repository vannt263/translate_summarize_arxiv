    "differential systems with delays enter into the modeling of many problems and are frequently used in domains like electronics , telecommunications , biology , epidemiology or aerospace . satelite remote control or network communication protocol models fall for instance into this framework . when the identifiability analysis of delays arises , it is impossible to directly use the classical criteria based on a similarity transformation approach @xcite or a series expansion approach @xcite because delays occur in an implicit way in the state equations ( argument of the functions of input and state )",
    ". then two approaches for identifiability analysis can be considered .",
    "+ the first one consists in approximating the functions with delays @xcite so that the approximate system is described by ordinary differential equations .",
    "it is clear that the identifiability of this approximated system does not imply the identifiability of the original system .",
    "the second approach consists in approximating the nonlinear system by linearization around an equilibrium state , which is the method followed in this paper .",

    "we are hence interested in the identifiability of the linearized system and present a criterion to test the identifiability of a linear system with constant delays @xcite , @xcite , @xcite , from which the identifiability of the original nonlinear system can be proved .",
    "the result of @xcite is extended in two ways , by taking into account any number of delays acting on the state and on the input , and by considering the general case of multiple inputs , which was not considered in the extention proposed in @xcite .",
    "the new proof requires to define a different norm for the inputs , to provide a bound for the estimation of the state norm that accounts for the delays and to deal with higher dimension .",
    "+ this paper is organized as follows . in section 2 ,",
    "we give some generalities on delayed - differential models and define identifiability for such systems . in section 3 , the result of identifiability with linearization around an equilibrium state is given through a criterion allowing us to test the identifiability of a linear system with constant delays @xcite , @xcite , @xcite .",
    "section 4 provides an illustrative example for which our identifiability analysis method is fully developped .",
    "the last section concludes the paper and discusses potential application domains which could benefit from our result .",
    "in this work , we consider linear and nonlinear systems with real positive delays . these systems are characterized by the length of their memory , i.e. the largest of their delays .",

    "the parameters @xmath22, ... ,@xmath23 , @xmath24, ... ,@xmath25 represent the delays to be estimated . @xmath3 and @xmath4 are respectively the maximum delay of @xmath13 and @xmath14 .",
    "the vector of delays is included in @xmath26 .",
    "the unknown constants @xmath27 , ... , @xmath28 belonging to @xmath29 and gathered in the vector @xmath30 must also be estimated .",
    "hence the estimation concerns the parameter vector @xmath31 .",
