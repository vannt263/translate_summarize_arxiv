    "the term dibaryon is used somewhat ambiguously in the literature .",
    "it is applied for single hadrons viewed as genuine compact six - quarks states that are tied together by ( rather short - ranged ) gluon - exchange forces between the quarks , on one hand side , but also for loosely bound two - baryons systems such as the deuteron , that are formed by long - ranged forces between their constituents .",
    "possibly the most famous one of the former kind is the @xmath5-dibaryon which was predicted by jaffe in 1977 as a deeply bound state with quantum numbers of the @xmath9 system , i.e. strangeness @xmath10 and isospin @xmath11 , and with @xmath12 @xcite .    in any case , the aforementioned deuteron ( the neutron - proton bound state in the @xmath13-@xmath14 channel ) is so far the only known and unambiguously established dibaryon .",
    "the interaction in the @xmath4 partial wave of the neutron - proton ( @xmath15 ) system is just not strong enough to produce a bound state and only a virtual state is created .",
    "certainly , there is no shortage of new proposals of dibaryon candidates in nucleon - nucleon scattering @xcite as well as in the strangeness sector @xcite .",
    "in particular , the ( approximate ) su(3 ) flavor symmetry of the strong interaction suggests that bound states could exist also in other systems formed by two octet baryons @xcite .",
    "indeed meson - exchange models like the nijmegen baryon - baryon ( @xmath16 ) interaction @xcite , derived under the assumption of ( broken ) su(3 ) symmetry , predict bound states for the @xmath3 but also for the @xmath17 and @xmath18 systems . a @xmath16 interaction derived in a rather different way , namely within the framework of chiral effective field theory ( eft ) @xcite generates likewise bound states in the strangeness @xmath1 and @xmath2 sectors @xcite .    with regard to the @xmath5-dibaryon ,",
    "many experimental searches were carried out over the years , but so far no convincing signal was found @xcite .",
    "recently , however , the @xmath5-dibaryon was put back on the agenda by lattice qcd calculations performed by the nplqcd @xcite and hal qcd @xcite collaborations , where evidence for a bound state in the pertinent @xmath16 channel was found .",
    "the nlpqcd collaboration reported also evidence for a @xmath19 bound state @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , one has to keep in mind that most present - day lattice qcd calculations are not performed at the physical masses of the involved particles .",
    "thus , it is an open question how the binding energies of the calculated states evolve when those masses approach their physical values .",
    "standard chiral extrapolations @xcite might reach their limits in case of dynamically generated bound states where there is a delicate interplay between the interaction potential ( that depends on the pion mass ) and the kinetic energy ( that is affected by the baryon masses ) . specifically in situations where two or more @xmath16 channels can couple , as it is the case for the @xmath5-dibaryon , the effects due to the baryon masses could be sizeable .    in this paper , we analyze various issues related to lattice qcd calculations in the framework of chiral effective field theory for the @xmath16 interaction at leading order ( lo ) in the weinberg counting .",
    "indeed , the framework of chiral effective field theory in which our @xmath16 interactions are derived is very well suited to shed light on the general characteristics of possible dibaryon bound states and , in particular , to study the quark mass dependence of the binding energies of those states , in complete analogy to calculations of the quark mass dependence of the deuteron binding energy performed in refs .",
    "another important issue that can be addressed here is how this quark mass dependence is affected when the su(3 ) breaking manifested in the masses of the octet baryons is accounted for .",
    "the imposed ( approximate ) su(3 ) flavor symmetry fixes the interactions in the @xmath1 and @xmath2 sectors uniquely , once the ( five ) low - energy constant ( lecs ) that occur at lo in chiral eft are determined by a fit to the available hyperon - nucleon data .",
    "in particular , our lo interaction published in @xcite implies the existence of several bound states in those systems .",
    "it will be interesting to see how the corresponding binding energies evolve when we increase the pion mass in order to match with the conditions of present lattice qcd calculations @xcite .    in the @xmath0 sector with isospin zero where the @xmath5-dibaryon is expected there is one additional lec , corresponding to the su(3 ) flavor - singlet channel , that can not be fixed by hyperon - nucleon data .",
    "since the scarce experimental information available for this sector ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 cross sections @xcite ) is afflicted with large uncertainties and does not allow to constrain its value @xcite , one can exploit this freedom and fine - tune the remaining lec to produce a bound @xmath5 with a given binding energy , and then study its properties @xcite .",
    "the case of the @xmath5-dibaryon is also very well suited to examine the effects from the su(3 ) breaking in the baryon masses because , as said before , for the quantum numbers in question there are three baryon - baryon channels that can couple , namely @xmath9 , @xmath7 , and @xmath22 .",
    "their physical thresholds are well separated , whereas in a completely su(3 ) symmetric world all @xmath16 thresholds are degenerate .",
    "we will see that this has very definite dynamical consequences .",
    "our manuscript is organized as follows : in sec .",
    "[ sec:2 ] , we recall the basic formalism of the @xmath16 interaction in the framework of chiral eft . sec .",
    "[ sec:3 ] contains a detailed discussion of the quark mass dependence of binding energies in the strangeness @xmath1 and @xmath2 sectors , where our chiral eft interaction but also the meson - exchange potential of the nijmegen group predict bound states in several @xmath16 channels . in sec .",
    "[ sec:4 ] we discuss in detail the situation for the @xmath5 dibaryon . specifically , we examine the influence of the su(3 ) breaking through the various two - baryon thresholds and we try to make direct contact to the results published by the nplqcd and hal qcd collaborations .",
    "the paper ends with some concluding remarks .",
    "for details on the derivation of the chiral @xmath16 potentials for the strangeness sector at lo using the weinberg power counting , we refer the reader to refs .",
    "@xcite , see also refs .",
    "@xcite . here , we just briefly summarize the basic ingredients of the chiral eft for @xmath16 interactions .    [",
    "cols=\"<,^,^,<,^,<\",options=\"header \" , ]     in this context let us emphasize that , of course , it would be also interesting to confirm or exclude the existence of those bound states experimentally .",
    "the possibility to find signals for strange di - baryon states in heavy - ion collisions was discussed in refs .",
    "also the new facilities j - parc ( tokai , japan ) and fair ( darmstadt , germany ) could allow one to obtain empirical constraints on the baryon - baryon interaction in the @xmath1 and @xmath23 sector .",
    "information could come from formation experiments of corresponding hypernuclei or from proton - proton and antiproton - proton collisions at such high energies that pairs of baryons with strangeness @xmath1 or @xmath2 can be produced .",
    "as already said , in the @xmath0 sector with isospin zero where the @xmath5-dibaryon is expected there is one additional contact term ( @xmath24 , cf .",
    "table  [ tab:1 ] ) , corresponding to the su(3 ) flavor - singlet channel , that is not fixed by hyperon - nucleon data and , therefore , no immediate predictions can be made . in principle",
    ", this lec could be determined from experimental information available for this sector , but the scarce data ( @xmath20 and @xmath21 cross sections @xcite ) are afflicted with large uncertainties and do not allow to constrain its value @xcite .",
    "thus , in practice one can exploit this freedom and fine - tune the remaining lec to produce a bound @xmath5 with a given binding energy , and then study its properties @xcite .",
    "indeed , it turned out that a near - threshold bound state can be easily produced for @xmath24 values that are of natural size .    in the following we assume that the @xmath5-dibaryon is a ( loosely ) bound @xmath16 state @xcite , just like the bound states discussed in the previous section .",
    "we do not consider the case where the @xmath5-dibaryon is a genuine 6-quark state as originally suggested by jaffe @xcite .",
    "in fact , we can not say anything about the latter situation within our framework .",
    "we also assume that the binding energy , @xmath25 , is similar to that of the deuteron ( @xmath26 ) because this allows us to compare the properties of the generated @xmath5-dibaryon directly with the familiar deuteron case .",
    "specifically , we fix the value of the flavor - singlet lec @xmath24 in such a way that the binding momentum is @xmath27fm ( @xmath28 , where @xmath29 is either @xmath30 or @xmath31 ) , in view of the well - known relation between the binding energy and the effective range parameters @xcite @xmath32 this relation is very well fulfilled for the deuteron and the corresponding neutron - proton @xmath13 scattering length ( @xmath33fm ) and effective range ( @xmath34fm ) .",
    "one would naively expect that the same should happen for the @xmath5-dibaryon .",
    "however , it turns out that the corresponding results for @xmath6 in the @xmath4 partial wave are quite different , namely @xmath35fm and @xmath36fm . specifically , the effective range is much larger and , moreover , negative . clearly , the properties of the @xmath5-dibaryon are not comparable to those of the deuteron , despite the fact that both bound states are close to the elastic threshold . indeed",
    ", if one recalls the expressions for the relevant potentials as given in table [ tab:1 ] , @xmath37 one can see that the attraction provided by the su(3 ) flavor - singlet state ( i.e. @xmath38 ) contributes with a much larger weight to the @xmath7 channel than to @xmath6 .",
    "this indicates that the presumed @xmath5-dibaryon could be predominantly a @xmath7 bound state .",
    "we have confirmed this conjecture by evaluating explicitly the phase shifts in the @xmath6 and @xmath7 channels , cf .",
    "the discussion in the next section .",
    "indeed , one finds that the phase shift for the @xmath7 channel is rather similar to the @xmath39 @xmath13 case .",
    "specifically , the @xmath7 ( @xmath4 ) phase shift @xmath40 fulfills @xmath41 in agreement with the levinson theorem .",
    "the @xmath6 ( @xmath4 ) phase behaves rather differently and satisfies @xmath42 .",
    "note that there have been earlier discussions on this issue in the context of @xmath0 baryon - baryon interactions derived within the quark model @xcite .",
    "the results above were obtained with the lecs @xmath43 and @xmath44 fixed from the @xmath45 data for the cutoff value @xmath46  mev @xcite .",
    "we considered also the other variants corresponding to cutoff masses of 600 , 650 , and 700 mev in the ls equation  ( [ ls ] ) , as in ref .",
    "but since the contact term @xmath38 has to be determined anew in each case it turned out that the results are rather similar for all cutoffs once @xmath38 is fixed in such a way that the same binding energy for the @xmath5 dibaryon is produced .",
    "thus , we will present only results for the @xmath46  mev case .",
    "we denote the @xmath47 interaction with a loosely bound @xmath5 dibaryon by yy - d in the following , and use the notation yy(550 ) for the original interaction from ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "let us now consider variations of the masses of the involved particles .",
    "the dependence of the @xmath5 binding energy on the pion mass @xmath48 is displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi ] ( left ) . for the yy - d potential",
    "considered above , enlarging the pion mass to around 400 mev ( i.e. to values in an order that corresponds to the nplqcd calculation @xcite ) increases the binding energy to around 8 mev and a further change of @xmath48 to 700 mev ( corresponding roughly to the hal qcd calculation @xcite ) yields then 13 mev , cf . the solid line .",
    "readjusting @xmath49 so that we predict a @xmath5 binding energy of 13.2 mev for @xmath50 mev , corresponding to the latest result published by nplqcd  @xcite , yields the dashed curve .",
    "it is obvious that the dependence on @xmath48 we obtain agrees  at least on a qualitative level  with that presented in ref .",
    "specifically , our calculation exhibits the same trend ( a decrease of the binding energy with decreasing pion mass ) and our binding energy of 9 mev at the physical pion mass is within the error bars of the results given in  @xcite . on the other hand",
    ", we clearly observe a non - linear dependence of the binding energy on the pion mass . as a consequence , scaling our results to the binding energy reported by the hal qcd collaboration @xcite ( 30 - 40 mev for @xmath51  mev ) yields binding energies of more than 20 mev at the physical point , which is certainly outside of the range suggested in ref .",
    "however , we note that for such large pion masses the lo chiral eft can not be trusted quantitatively .",
    "we remark that in our simulations the curves corresponding to different binding energies remained roughly parallel even up to such large values as suggested by the hal qcd collaboration .",
    "our finding that any @xmath5-dibaryon is very likely a bound @xmath7 state rather than a @xmath6 state , which follows from the assumed ( approximate ) su(3 ) symmetry of the interaction , suggests that not only the pion mass but also the masses of the baryons play a significant role for the concrete value of binding energy . in the specific case of @xmath52 , @xmath11 , @xmath0 we are dealing with three coupled channels , namely @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 . for the isospin - averaged masses that we use their thresholds are at 2231.2 , 2257.7 , and 2385.0  mev , respectively .",
    "thus , the physical difference between the @xmath6 and @xmath7 thresholds of around 26  mev implies that the @xmath5-dibaryon considered above is , in reality , bound by roughly 28  mev with respect to its `` proper '' threshold .",
    "accordingly , one intuitively expects that in a fully su(3 ) symmetric case , where the masses of all octet baryons coincide , the bound state would remain more or less fixed to the @xmath7 threshold and then would lie also about 28 mev below the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "since we know from our experience with coupled - channel problems @xcite that coupling effects are sizeable and the actual separation of the various thresholds plays a crucial role we investigated also the dependence of the @xmath5 binding energy on the thresholds ( i.e. on the @xmath53 , and on the @xmath54 and @xmath55 masses ) .",
    "corresponding results are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi ] in the right panel .",
    "we start with considering the effect of the @xmath56 channel because its threshold is separated by roughly 154 mev from the one of @xmath6 so that there is a rather drastic breaking of the su(3 ) symmetry . indeed , when we decrease the @xmath53 mass so that the nominal @xmath56 threshold ( at 2385  mev ) moves downwards and finally coincides with the one of the @xmath6 channel ( 2231.2  mev )",
    ", we observe a concurrent fairly drastic increase in the @xmath5 binding energy , cf .",
    "the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi ] for results based on the interaction yy - d with a binding energy of -1.87  mev for physical masses of the mesons and baryons . in this context",
    "we want to point out that the direct interaction in the @xmath22 channel is actually repulsive for the low - energy coefficients @xmath43 and @xmath44 fixed from the @xmath45 data plus the pseudoscalar meson exchange contributions with coupling constants determined from the su(3 ) relations eq .",
    "( [ su3 ] ) , and it remains repulsive even for @xmath38 values that produce a bound @xmath5-dibaryon . but the coupling between the channels generates a sizeable effective attraction which increases when the channel thresholds come closer . the dashed curve is a calculation with the contact term @xmath38 fixed to simulate the binding energy ( @xmath57  mev ) of the nplqcd collaboration at @xmath58mev .",
    "as one can see , the dependence of the binding energy on the @xmath53 mass is rather similar .",
    "the curve is simply shifted downwards by around 4.5  mev , i.e. by the difference in the binding energy observed already at the physical masses .",
    "the asterisks and crosses represent results where , besides the variation of the @xmath22 threshold , the @xmath7 threshold is shifted to coincide with that of the @xmath6 channel .",
    "this produces an additional increase of the @xmath5 binding energy by 20  mev at the physical @xmath22 threshold and by 9  mev for that case where all three @xmath16 threshold coincide .",
    "altogether there is an increase in the binding energy of roughly 60  mev when going from the physical point to the case of baryons with identical masses .",
    "this is significantly larger than the variations due to the pion mass considered before .",
    "note that we have kept the pion mass at its physical value while varying the @xmath16 thresholds .      after these exemplary studies let us now try to connect with the published @xmath5 binding energies from the lattice qcd calculations @xcite .",
    "the results obtained by the hal qcd collaboration are obviously for the su(3 ) symmetric case and the corresponding masses are given in table i of ref .",
    "thus , we can take those masses and then fix the lec @xmath49 so that we reproduce their @xmath5 binding energy with those masses . to be concrete",
    ": we use @xmath59mev and @xmath60mev , and fix @xmath49 so that @xmath61mev .",
    "we denote this interaction by yy - hal .",
    "when we now let the masses of the baryons and mesons go to their physical values the bound state moves up to the @xmath6 threshold , crosses the threshold , crosses also the @xmath7 threshold and then disappears .",
    "in fact , qualitatively this outcome can be already read off from the curves in fig .",
    "[ fig : mpi ] by combining the effects from the variations in the pion and the baryon masses . based on those results",
    "one expects a shift of the @xmath5 binding energy in the order of 60 to 70  mev for the mass parameters of the hal qcd calculation .    in case of the nplqcd calculation",
    "we take the values provided in ref .",
    "@xcite , as before .",
    "those yield then 17  mev for the @xmath7-@xmath6 threshold separation ( to be compared with the physical value of roughly 26  mev ) and 77  mev for the @xmath8-@xmath6 separation ( physical value around 154  mev ) .",
    "we also use the meson masses of ref .",
    "@xcite , specifically @xmath62 mev . with those baryon and meson masses",
    "we fix again the lec @xmath49 so that we reproduce the @xmath5 binding energy given by the nplqcd collaboration , namely @xmath63  mev @xcite ( called yy - npl in the following ) .",
    "again we let the masses of the baryons and mesons approach their physical values . also here",
    "the bound state moves up to and crosses the @xmath6 threshold .",
    "however , in the nplqcd case the state survives and remains below the @xmath7 threshold at the physical point .",
    "specifically , we observe a resonance at a kinetic energy of 21  mev in the @xmath6 system or , more precisely , a quasi - bound state in the @xmath7 system around 5  mev below its threshold .",
    "it is interesting to observe that the chiral extrapolation of the lattice qcd results performed by shanahan et al .",
    "@xcite yields results that are qualitatively similar to ours . in that reference",
    "the authors conclude that the @xmath5-dibaryon is likely to be unbound by 13@xmath6414 mev at the physical point .",
    "let us emphasize , however , that our values are not really comparable with theirs . as said above , in our analysis we assume that the @xmath5-dibaryon is actually a bound @xmath16 state  which seems to be the case also in the lattice qcd studies @xcite . on the other hand , in ref .",
    "@xcite it is assumed that the @xmath5 is a compact , multi - quark state rather than a loosely bound molecular state , i.e. an object as originally suggested by jaffe .",
    "how such a genuine multi - quark state would be influenced by variations of the @xmath16 thresholds is completely unclear .",
    "it depends , among other things , on whether and how strongly this state couples to the @xmath6 , @xmath7 , and @xmath8 channels .",
    "so far there is no information on this issue from lattice qcd calculations . clearly , in case of a strong and predominant coupling to the @xmath6 alone , variations of the @xmath8 and @xmath7 would not influence the @xmath5 binding energy significantly .",
    "however , should it couple primarily to the @xmath7 and/or @xmath8 channels then we expect a sensitivity of the binding energy to their thresholds values comparable to what we found in our study for the case of a bound state .",
    "phase shifts for the @xmath4 partial wave of the @xmath6 , @xmath7 and @xmath22 channels are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] .",
    "the solid line is the result for the @xmath16 interaction yy - d that produces a loosely bound @xmath5 dibaryon with @xmath65  mev .",
    "the phase shift for the @xmath7 channel , fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ( b ) , is rather similar to the one for the @xmath13 @xmath39 partial wave where the deuteron resides , see e.g. @xcite .",
    "specifically , it starts at @xmath66 , decreases smoothly and eventually approaches zero for large energies , fulfilling the levinson theorem .",
    "the result for @xmath6 ( @xmath4 ) , fig .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ( a ) , behaves rather differently .",
    "this phase commences at zero degrees , is first negative but becomes positive within 20 mev and finally turns to zero again for large energies .",
    "the dashed curve corresponds to the interaction yy - hal that was fitted to the result of the hal qcd collaboration and reproduces their bound @xmath5 dibaryon with their meson and baryon masses .",
    "the phase shift of the @xmath7 channel , calculated with physical masses , shows no trace of a bound state anymore .",
    "still the phase shift rises up to around @xmath67 near threshold , a behavior quite similar to that of the @xmath4 @xmath39 partial wave where there is a virtual state ( also called antibound state @xcite ) .",
    "indeed , such a virtual state also seems to be present in the @xmath7 channel as a remnant of the original bound state .",
    "the effect of this virtual state can be seen in the @xmath6 phase shift where it leads to an impressive cusp at the opening of the @xmath7 channel , cf . the dashed line in fig .  [ fig : phases ] ( a ) .",
    "in the @xmath7 phase shifts for the nplqcd case ( dash - dotted curve ) the presence of a bound state is clearly visible .",
    "the corresponding @xmath6 phase shift exhibits a resonance - like behavior at the energy where the ( quasi - bound ) @xmath5 dibaryon is located .",
    "the dotted curves are the results for the original chiral eft potential with cut - off @xmath46 mev as published in @xcite .",
    "the @xmath6 as well as the @xmath7 phase shifts are qualitatively similar to the ones for the hal qcd case . but the smaller @xmath7 phase shift together with the reduced cusp effect indicate that there is no near - by virtual state produced by this interaction .",
    "the @xmath22 phase shifts predicted by the various interactions are almost the same , cf .",
    "[ fig : phases ] ( c )",
    ". this may be not too surprising .",
    "after all , the @xmath22 threshold is rather far away from the one of the @xmath9 channel and the region , where we have introduced the @xmath5 dibaryon .",
    "thus , it remains practically unaffected by those changes .",
    "finally , for illustrative purposes , we present cross sections for the @xmath6 and @xmath68 channels . results of corresponding calculations , now performed in particle basis ( but neglecting the coulomb interaction ) , are displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] .",
    "there are some experimental constraints for these two channels .",
    "in particular , there is an upper limit of @xmath69 mb at @xmath70 confidence level for elastic @xmath71 scattering , while for the @xmath72 cross section at @xmath73 mev / c a value of @xmath74 mb was reported @xcite .    as obvious from fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] , there are significant differences in the cross sections predicted by the @xmath47 interactions generated in the context of the @xmath5-dibaryon discussion  however , only at low momenta where no experimental information is at hand so far .",
    "anyhow , those results suggest that a determination of the @xmath68 cross section at @xmath75 mev / c , say , with reasonable errors would already put strong constraints on the @xmath5-dibaryon . in particular , situations where",
    "it is located close to the @xmath7 threshold  as at is the case in our simulations of the nplqcd and hal qcd results ( dash - dotted and dashed curves , respectively )  could be ruled out . distinguishing an actually ( though loosely )",
    "bound @xmath5-dibaryon ( solid curve ) from the situation without any @xmath5-dibaryon ( dotted curve ) certainly requires better statistics .",
    "here one has to keep in mind that the @xmath71 cross section would be even closer to the latter result , should the @xmath5-dibaryon be somewhat stronger bound than assumed in our calculation .",
    "note that the peak in the @xmath68 cross section around 575 mev / c is a cusp due to the opening of the @xmath76 channel .",
    "there are also characteristic differences in the predictions for @xmath77 , cf .",
    "[ fig : cross ] ( c ) .",
    "however , since this cross section rises to infinity with decreasing @xmath78 , due to the phase - space factor , it might be more difficult to draw conclusions in this case .",
    "the assumed @xmath5 dibaryon below the @xmath6 threshold introduces a rather strong and peculiar energy variation in the near - threshold @xmath6 cross section , cf . the solid curve in fig .",
    "[ fig : cross ] ( a ) .",
    "the effects due to the other considered interactions is less spectacular , specifically , because the structure produced by the nplqcd case is so narrow that it would be presumably completely washed out once one takes into account the finite momentum resolution of an actual experiment . in any case , measuring the @xmath6 cross section directly seems to be practically impossible .",
    "however , one could measure the @xmath6 invariant mass spectrum in reactions like @xmath79 where @xmath80 can be the deuteron or a heavier nucleus . as a matter of facts , corresponding results from a measurement of @xmath81",
    "have been already published @xcite .",
    "still , it is unclear whether such an invariant mass distribution would be dominated by the @xmath82 transition amplitude or rather by @xmath83 . since our investigation suggests that any near - threshold @xmath5-dibaryon will have a large if not dominant @xmath7 component one expects that then the @xmath83 amplitude should play likewise an important if not decisive role for the @xmath6 invariant mass distribution .",
    "in this paper we have presented an analysis of the quark mass dependence of binding energies for baryon - baryon systems in the strangeness @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and @xmath2 sectors in the framework of chiral effective field theory at leading order in the weinberg counting . in particular , we have explored the dependence of those binding energies on the pion mass in order to connect with current lattice qcd calculations .",
    "we remark that at higher orders , other effects like the quark mass dependence of the meson - baryon couplings or of the contact interactions will have to be considered ( see e.g.  @xcite ) .    with regard to the @xmath3 , @xmath17 and @xmath18 systems , where meson - exchange potentials as well as leading - order eft interactions , derived under the assumption of ( broken ) su(3 ) symmetry , predict the existence of bound states in the various @xmath4 partial waves",
    ", we find a rather weak dependence of the binding energies on the pion mass . for the @xmath19 system a calculation performed with meson and baryon masses that match the status of a recent lattice qcd exploration by the nplqcd collaboration yields binding energies that are compatible with the reported lattice qcd result @xcite within the given error bars .",
