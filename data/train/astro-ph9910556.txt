    "considerable observational evidence now exists for supermassive black holes ( smbhs ) in the centers of giant elliptical galaxies .",
    "these mass concentrations , long suspected to be the origin of non - thermal energy in active galaxies , are now thought to be responsible for large gas or stellar velocities in galactic cores ( ho 1998 ) . we discuss here the interaction of smbhs with hot ( @xmath3 k ) interstellar gas . the local compression and heating of interstellar gas in the smbh potential",
    "can be detected with the _ chandra _ x - ray telescope .",
    "indeed , the inflow of interstellar gas may explain the growth of smbhs in galactic cores",
    ". however , x - ray detection of smbhs may not be possible if the non - thermal interstellar pressure is comparable to the pressure of hot thermal gas .",
    "as we were completing this work , a similar study of the smbh - gas interaction by quataert & narayan ( 1999 ) ( qn ) appeared on the astro - ph preprint server .",
    "while some of the conclusions of qn are supported by our flow calculations , our results are qualitatively different in a number of important ways .",
    "the steady state flows considered by qn are constrained to pass through a sonic point , becoming supersonic near the smbh . by comparison , our ( non - steady ) computational gas flows near the smbh adapt naturally to the interstellar cooling flow in the surrounding galaxy and , as a result , our flow velocity is fully subsonic near the smbh .",
    "we also consider several additional physical effects not discussed by qn : time - dependent ejection of mass by evolving stars , heating by type ia supernovae , non - thermal pressure , and the gravitational field of ( dark ) cooled interstellar gas which in some observations may be confused with the mass of the smbh .",
    "although we use observations of the bright virgo elliptical ngc 4472 as a guide for our models , we do not seek here a set of parameters for an optimal fit to this galaxy .",
    "instead , our objective is to illustrate some of the physical effects that must be considered in interpreting x - ray observations of the cores of bright ellipticals with the _ chandra _ telescope . at a distance",
    "@xmath4 mpc appropriate for ngc 4472 , _",
    "chandra s _ resolution ( @xmath5 arcseconds ) is @xmath6 pc .",
    "the computational procedure we follow here is identical to that described in our recent papers ( e.g. brighenti & mathews 1999a ) . with ngc 4472 in mind",
    ", we construct a galaxy in a cosmological environment beginning with an overdensity perturbation designed to form a galaxy group . stars of total mass @xmath7 @xmath8 ( appropriate to ngc 4472 with @xmath9 ; van der marel 1991 ) , are formed from the baryons at an early time ( @xmath10 gyr ) and later ( @xmath11 gyrs ) merge into a de vaucouleurs profile .",
    "an evolving nfw dark halo develops around the galaxy over time , accompanied by secondary infall , although within an effective radius ( @xmath12 kpc for ngc 4472 ) stellar mass loss provides about half of the hot interstellar gas .",
    "a cooling flow develops in the hot interstellar gas at early times and slowly evolves toward its present configuration at @xmath13 gyrs . over time a large mass of interstellar gas cools in ngc 4472 , @xmath14 @xmath8 . since this mass exceeds the mass observed in the central black hole in ngc 4472 , @xmath15 @xmath8 ( magorrian et al .",
    "1998 ) , interstellar gas must cool in localized thermal instabilities distributed throughout an extended galactic volume within @xmath16 .",
    "this distributed interstellar cooling is modeled by adding a sink term to the equation of continuity : @xmath17 where @xmath18 is the time for gas to cool locally by radiative losses at constant pressure ( e.g. sarazin & ashe 1989 ) .",
    "we find that taking @xmath19 provides a satisfactory global interstellar flow solution for ngc 4472 that matches currently observed density , temperature and metallicity profiles reasonably well ( brighenti & mathews 1999a ; 1999b ) ; we adopt @xmath19 here .    to resolve the small scale flow near the smbh we have refined our logarithmic spatial grid in the galactic core to an innermost zone of radius 12 pc .",
    "interstellar gas is influenced by the black hole within a radius @xmath20 pc ; @xmath21 is the sound speed in the hot gas .",
    "we ignore the effects of galactic rotation .",
    "although the mass - losing stellar systems in large ellipticals like ngc 4472 are slowly rotating , their x - ray images do not indicate the flattening expected if the hot interstellar gas shared this rotation ( brighenti & mathews 1996 ) .",
    "evidently , efficient cooling dropout or turbulent viscosity removes angular momentum from the hot gas .",
    "figure 1 shows the interstellar density , temperature and ( rosat band ) x - ray surface brightness evolved to the present time , @xmath13 gyrs . during the evolution , new gas and energy",
    "are supplied from stellar sources : ( 1 ) the specific stellar mass loss rate is @xmath22^{-1.3}$ ] sec@xmath23 and ( 2 ) gas is heated by type ia supernovae at a rate snu@xmath24snu@xmath25 , where snu@xmath26 snia per 100 yrs per @xmath27 @xmath28 ( cappellaro et al .",
    "the interstellar gas temperature is nearly virial , @xmath29 k. the stellar density has a de vaucouleurs profile but flattens to @xmath30 within a `` break '' radius @xmath31 pc ( faber et al .",
    "1997 ) .",
    "dashed lines in figure 1 refer to solutions without central black hole and the solid lines refer to solutions with a central black hole of mass @xmath32 @xmath8 introduced at @xmath11 gyrs . in this @xmath19 solution , an additional @xmath33 @xmath8 flows inside @xmath34 pc by @xmath13 gyrs , increasing the central dark mass to @xmath35 @xmath8 . the gas density ( with smbh )",
    "varies approximately as @xmath36 over most of the flow . for @xmath37 pc , the computed density appears to exceed the innermost observations ; we discuss this apparent discrepancy in more detail below .",
    "light curves in figure 1 for @xmath38 refer to the background flow ; heavy curves show the projected temperature including emission from distributed cooling regions and correspond to the temperature observed . for constant @xmath39 , cooling dropout is important throughout the flow and extends to the region adjacent to the smbh .",
    "the gas temperature rises dramatically within about 50 pc from the smbh  detection of this thermal peak by _",
    "chandra _ would provide additional evidence for a smbh .",
    "this temperature spike should be visible even when viewed with _",
    "chandra _ in projection against the entire cooling flow : the mean projected thermal temperatures within apertures of @xmath40 , 100 and 500 pc are 2.95 , 2.70 and 2.00 @xmath41 k ( with smbh ) and 1.04 , 1.05 and 1.09 @xmath41 k ( without smbh ) respectively .",
    "the upper panel in figure 2 shows the current flow velocity @xmath42 and the local mass flow @xmath43 . a small influence due to the smbh potential at times",
    "@xmath44 can be seen in the distant flow @xmath45 kpc where the flow time @xmath46 .",
    "overall , the flow is very subsonic even in the vicinity of the smbh where @xmath47 km s@xmath23 .",
    "this occurs for two reasons : ( 1 ) the high pressure in the central thermal spike ( e.g. holzer & axford 1970 ) , enhanced by the smbh , and ( 2 ) mass dropout which tends to make subsonic flow even slower . by contrast , the solutions of qn ( with @xmath48 ) are constrained to pass through a sonic transition , causing the gas to accelerate through the thermal spike .",
    "[ without mass dropout ( @xmath49 ) we also find a transition to supersonic flow at @xmath50 pc . ]",
    "our calculations shown in figures 1 and 2 were done with boundary condition @xmath51 ; accumulated gas in the central zone cools there . to encourage the onset of supersonic flow near the smbh",
    ", we repeated the calculation allowing the gas to flow freely through a small radius ( as small as @xmath52 pc with a very high resolution grid ) and found that the flow was essentially unchanged from that shown in the figures .",
    "the fully subsonic character of our solutions is therefore quite robust and independent of our boundary condition at @xmath53 .",
    "[ in principle our flow should become supersonic very near the schwarzschild radius ( @xmath54 pc ) , but this can not be resolved by our spatial grid and it is likely that additional physical effects become important as @xmath55 approaches @xmath56 . ]    because our flow in the thermal spike near the smbh is subsonic , the cooling time @xmath57 remains comparable to the flow time @xmath58 throughout this region and cooling dropout continues unabated at small radii , unlike the qn solutions .",
    "this concentrated mass dropout has two important astrophysical consequences : ( 1 ) the mass deposited by interstellar cooling near the smbh may be comparable to that of the smbh itself , and ( 2 ) the rate that mass flows into the smbh at the origin is significantly reduced ( by about @xmath59 ) below the qn solutions .",
    "the mass of cooled interstellar gas in our model with smbh in figure 2 is large : @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 @xmath8 within @xmath63 , 100 and 300 parsecs respectively .",
    "these masses are comparable to smbh masses found by magorrian et al .",
    "( 1998 ) and they occur within the small region ( @xmath64 arcseconds or 330 pc for ngc 4472 ) where stellar velocities are enhanced by the smbh . the gravitational acceleration due to the smbh , the dropout mass , old stars and dark halo are also shown in figure 2 ;",
    "note that the dropout mass dominates gravitational forces at @xmath65 pc . in view of the possibility of contamination with dropout mass ,",
    "the true mass of the central smbh may be lower than those quoted by magorrian et al .",
    "these considerations depend on our assumption that interstellar mass dropout continues to the smallest galactic radii ; at the present time there is no reason to question this assumption .    in figure 3",
    "we illustrate a solution identical to that in figure 2 but with an initial smbh mass of only @xmath66 @xmath8 ; the visibility of the thermal spike is noticeably reduced .",
    "we now return to the apparent disagreement in figure 1 between our models and the innermost observed @xmath67 and deprojected electron density",
    ".    can the apparent flattening of observed @xmath67 at small radii be due to absorption of x - rays by cold gas in @xmath37 pc ?",
    "the hii gas that produces optical emission lines in ngc 4472 ( macchetto et al . 1996 ) can not account for the x - ray absorption since h@xmath68 emission from such hii clouds in pressure equilibrium would be @xmath69 times more intense than @xmath70 observed in this region of ngc 4472 .",
    "suppose instead that the absorbing gas is cold hi or h@xmath71 and is distributed in a uniform disk extending to @xmath72 pc oriented perpendicular to the line of sight . if the disk column density is @xmath73 @xmath74 ( i.e. @xmath75 ) , the total disk mass , @xmath76 @xmath8 , would be consistent with upper limits on observed hi and h@xmath71 in ngc 4472 , @xmath77 @xmath8 ( bregman , roberts & giovanelli 1988 ; braine , henkel & wiklind 1997 ) . however , in pressure equilibrium with the hot cooling flow gas , the density of such cold gas ( at @xmath78 k mathews & brighenti 1999 ) is very high , @xmath79 @xmath80 , and the disk thickness is incredibly small , @xmath81 pc .",
    "whether such a peculiar and fragile disk could exist in ngc 4472 ( and other virgo ellipticals with similar cores ; brighenti & mathews 1997 ) seems unlikely . however , optical line emission from the surface of the disk ionized by stellar uv ( mathews & brighenti 1999 ) would exceed observed limits . for hii gas at @xmath82",
    "k the pressure equilibrium density at @xmath83 pc is @xmath84 @xmath80 and the stromgren radius is @xmath85 cm .",
    "the total h@xmath68 energy emitted by the disk , @xmath86 ergs s@xmath23 , is @xmath87 times larger than the total h@xmath68 luminosity from ngc 4472 , @xmath88 ergs s@xmath23 .",
    "this inconsistency can not be removed with other geometrical arrangements of the absorbing cold gas within 300 pc , so the apparent inner flattening in figure 1 is probably not due to absorption .",
    "we have also explored the possibility that the @xmath67 observations shown in figure 1 were centrally flattened by the 4 arcsecond half power gaussian prf ( giaconni et al .",
    "1979 ) of the _ einstein _ hri .",
    "however , such a convolution of our computed @xmath67 can not duplicate the core observed in ngc 4472 .",
    "x - ray cores in ngc 4472 , ngc 4636 and ngc 4649 ( trincheri , fabbiano & canizares 1986 ) are not artifacts of limited observational resolution .",
    "these difficulties led us to explore two additional `` non - standard '' models for ngc 4472 : flows ( 1 ) with extreme mass dropout inside 300 pc or ( 2 ) with additional non - thermal pressure in this same region .",
    "it is often claimed that mass dropout reduces the x - ray surface brightness in the central regions of cooling flows , but this is not true in general . for flows",
    "in which most of the gas in the central region has advected inward from large radii , cooling dropout at large radii can reduce the amount of gas and associated emission @xmath67 in the central core .",
    "however , this does not apply to galactic cooling flows in which much of the gas in the central flow originates from stars within or near this region .",
    "in addition , the x - ray emissivity and @xmath67 are locally enhanced at ( denser ) cooling sites where mass dropout occurs . to illustrate the futility of lowering the central @xmath67 in ngc 4472 with increased local cooling",
    ", we show in figure 3 density and temperature profiles for the standard flow ( at @xmath89 and with smbh ) but with a cooling dropout that truncates the background flow density : @xmath90 with @xmath91 @xmath80 .",
    "the thermal spike around the smbh is still present in this solution , but the apparent @xmath92 ( and @xmath67 ) within several 100 pc is only slightly reduced .",
    "the mean projected temperature within 100 pc is @xmath93 k.    finally , we consider cooling flow models in which @xmath92 and @xmath67 in the inner flow are lowered by an additional non - thermal pressure due to relativistic particles or magnetic fields , as suggested by radio emission observed in most elliptical cores . to explore this possibility",
    "we show in figure 3 the standard flow ( at @xmath13 gyrs with smbh ) in which an additional pressure is introduced in the galactic core : @xmath94 , where @xmath95 is the thermal gas pressure .",
    "the density ( and @xmath96 ) in the cooling flow within @xmath2 pc are reduced by this additional pressure and parameters for @xmath97 could be adjusted in an _ ad hoc _ fashion to achieve a more perfect fit with the observations .",
    "however , the apparent temperature of the thermal gas is dramatically lowered since the external flow is now supported mostly by non - thermal pressure .",
    "the projected apparent temperature within @xmath98 pc is only @xmath99 k , assuming this gas is not heated by collective interactions with the relativistic gas .",
    "the discernibility of the thermal spike near the smbh is now greatly reduced .",
    "in this study we have examined central cooling flows in a luminous elliptical similar to ngc 4472 . we have emphasized the evolution of quiescent flows that arise naturally from gas and energy supplied by galactic stars and by secondary infall in the outer regions .",
    "we have not explored possible transient interactions between the cooling flow and an intermittently active galactic core ( e.g. ciotti & ostriker 1997 ) .",
    "our objective here has been to anticipate some of the interpretive issues that may arise when _",
    "observations become available .",
    "\\(1 ) some dark matter currently attributed to the central supermassive black hole ( smbh ) may be due to a population of non - luminous stars created from cooled interstellar gas having a bottom - heavy imf . in the standard cooling flow for ngc 4472 with smbh , neutral clouds become gravitationally unstable ( and truncate the imf ) at masses @xmath100 , 0.3 and 0.8 @xmath8 at @xmath63 , 100 and 300",
    "pc respectively ( mathews & brighenti 1999 ) . such dark stars , possibly having approximately radial orbits , can also produce a radial variation in the global baryonic @xmath101 .",
    "\\(2 ) a successful observation of a high temperature peak in @xmath1 pc by _ chandra _ in a nearby bright elliptical would provide additional strong evidence for the existence of smbhs .",
    "however , if additional non - thermal pressure is present in elliptical cores the smbh thermal peak may no longer be discernible .",
    "\\(3 ) our central flows ( @xmath37 pc ) differ from the bondi - type transonic flow described by quataert & narayan ( 1999 ) since we do not insist on a sonic transition .",
    "the mass flow rate into the smbh is considerably reduced in our models .",
    "\\(4 ) as long as our standard cooling flow assumptions hold , we expect the gas density to rise steadily toward the smbh approximately as @xmath36 .",
    "but current observations suggest that such a gas density peak is not present .",
    "about half of the gas within 300 pc in ngc 4472 is supplied by mass loss from stars in this region . in our standard cooling flow model",
    "we have assumed that all stellar ejecta rapidly enters the hot interstellar phase ( in @xmath102 yrs ) .",
    "it has occasionally been suggested ( e.g. thomas 1986 ) that stellar ejecta cools before entering the hot gas , effectively reducing @xmath103 .",
    "however , we find that the central peak in @xmath92 and @xmath67 persists even if the stellar mass loss rate @xmath103 is reduced at small @xmath55 .",
    "moreover , dynamical arguments and gas temperature and metallicity gradients observed at larger radii ( @xmath104 ) strongly indicate that cooler , enriched stellar ejecta is conductively melting into the hot phase .",
