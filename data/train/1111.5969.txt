    "the bulk electronic properties of graphene@xcite are modified significantly in nanoscopic samples , where the influence of the edges becomes decisive .",

    "[ pic : graphene ] .",
    "while zigzag gnrs are always metallic , armchair gnrs are categorized into metallic or semiconducting depending on their width.@xcite gnrs of an orientation in between armchair and zigzag have been shown to effectively behave as zigzag gnrs.@xcite    the first experiments on lithographically defined gnrs failed to find conclusive evidence for these edge effects,@xcite but since then great effort has been spent on improving the edges of gnrs : scanning tunneling microscopy has been used to tailor edges,@xcite gnrs have been chemically derived from solution phase,@xcite they have been obtained by unzipping of carbon nanotubes,@xcite cut out of graphene sheets by anisotropic etching using nickel clusters@xcite or by sonochemically methods,@xcite or they were self - assembled inside carbon nanotubes.@xcite ( for an extended overview we refer to a recent review.@xcite )    in certain situations , for example when the dynamics of a system is chaotic or diffusive , its quantum transport properties are mainly determined by very few symmetries of the system , in particular the presence or absence of time - reversal symmetry ( trs).@xcite trs is usually broken by magnetic fields .",
    "however , berry and mondragon@xcite showed that in a ( hypothetical ) neutrino billiard , trs is broken even in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "in fact , in this case trs is broken by the edge of the billiard itself . the dirac equation used in ref .   to",
    "model neutrinos corresponds exactly to the effective low - energy hamiltonian of a single valley of graphene , prompting efforts to realize such an effective trs breaking in graphene , for example by different kinds of disorder@xcite or edges.@xcite    zigzag gnrs have also been shown to exhibit this kind of effective trs breaking when only long - range disorder is present , such that the valleys remain uncoupled and a single - valley dirac equation description is applicable . in this case , ( effective ) trs is broken by the zigzag edges , placing zigzag gnrs with long - range disorder into the unitary symmetry class ( no trs ) .",
    "@xcite the symmetry class was also shown to influence the conductance of zigzag gnrs dramatically : for long - range disorder zigzag gnrs exhibit a perfectly conducting channel ( pcc ) , i.e.  a minimum of one conductance quantum even in the strongly localized regime , whereas they show ordinary localization for short - range disorder that mixes the valleys and restores trs.@xcite in contrast , armchair gnrs were generally considered to be in the orthogonal symmetry class corresponding to trs.@xcite    in this paper , we investigate carefully the symmetries of graphene nanoribbons and their effect on the conductance in the strongly localized and diffusive regime when only long - range disorder ( that does not mix the valleys ) is present .",
    "in particular , we show that in contrast to common belief the symmetry classification of armchair gnrs depends on whether they are metallic or semiconducting . while semiconducting armchair gnrs are found to be in the orthogonal symmetry class , metallic armchair gnrs exhibit a hidden pseudovalley structure which leads to effective trs - breaking and places metallic armchair gnrs into the unitary symmetry class .",
    "this pseudovalley structure also leads to a perfectly conducting channel in metallic armchair gnrs .",
    "in addition , we show that zigzag gnrs can exhibit an unexpected and strong source of intervalley scattering , even for long - range , smooth potentials .",
    "when the magnitude of the disorder potential exceeds the fermi energy , electron - hole puddles are formed and valley scattering can be mediated by the edge state . in this case , trs is restored in zigzag gnrs and the pcc vanishes .",
    "this puts an additional restriction on the disorder potential ( apart from being long - ranged ) in order to realize the unitary symmetry class in zigzag gnrs .",
    "weak localization effects in the conductance in the diffusive regime of extended bulk graphene have been studied extensively both theoretically and experimentally.@xcite in contrast , we are aware only of a single theoretical work for ( quasi - onedimensional ) gnrs that finds weak localization behavior.@xcite here we study the quantum transport properties of gnrs in the diffusive regime systematically , and show that their behavior is in agreement with their symmetry classifications . in particular , we find suppression of weak localization in zigzag gnrs without intervalley scattering and metallic armchair gnrs .",

    "[ sec : sym ] , we observe wl behavior for semiconducting armchair gnrs ( black curve ) , whereas the wl correction is suppressed in the metallic armchair gnr ( blue curve ) .",
    "the results for the zigzag gnrs demonstrate again the importance of intervalley scattering : for small fermi energy ( red line ) the intervalley scattering is large [ parameters as for the black line in fig .",
    "[ pic : valleys](b ) ] leaving only the tight - binding trs @xmath160 .",
    "thus we observe wl behavior just as in the case of the semiconducting armchair gnr , as both belong to the orthogonal symmetry class . only if valley scattering is suppressed for larger energies ( violet curve ) , we also observe a suppression of the wl correction , as expected from the unitary symmetry class ( there is some residual intervalley scattering in this case , preventing complete suppression as in the metallic armchair gnr ) .",
    "previous studies@xcite assumed that the role of edges is only to introduce valley scattering and hence expected wl behavior in gnrs .",
    "in contrast , our study has shown that the type of edge , and even the distance between opposite edges is crucial to understand the magnetoconductance of gnrs in the quantum regime .    random matrix theory@xcite ( rmt ) predicts a universal value of the quantum - coherence correction in the limit of a large channel number .",
    "this value only depends on how far the system has approached the diffusive limit measured by the parameter @xmath161 . from eq .",
    "we obtain @xmath162 for the chosen disorder parameters [ see caption of fig .  [",
    "pic : wl_ribbons ] ] , which agrees well with the value estimated from the average conductance in the simulation ( @xmath163 ) .",
    "the value of the wl correction in the orthogonal symmetry class is then@xcite @xmath164 .",
    "the wl correction obtained from our numerical simulations agrees reasonably with this prediction , given that the number of channels is still small .",
    "in addition to the quantum - coherence correction to the ( average ) conductance , rmt also predicts universal values of the conductance fluctuations @xmath165 ( universal conductance fluctuations , ucf ) .",
    "@xcite both , zigzag and metallic armchair gnrs are in the unitary symmetry class but have degenerate ( pseudo)valleys . as a consequence , we expect ucfs of four times the universal value of the unitary class .",
    "in magnetic field , the ( pseudo)valleys remain independent , but their degeneracy is broken , since all of the antiunitary symmetries are broken by magnetic field . hence the ucfs",
    "take twice the value of the unitary class .",
    "a semiconducting armchair gnr does not allow for a decomposition into independent blocks and thus the ucfs take the value of the orthogonal and unitary class in the absence and presence of a magnetic field , respectively . since the ucfs in the orthogonal symmetry class are twice as large as in the unitary symmetry class , the ucfs in zigzag and metallic armchair gnrs are twice as large as for semiconducting armchair nanoribbons , both in the absence and presence of a magnetic field .",

    "[ pic : ucf ] shows the universal conductance fluctuations as obtained from our numerical simulations .",
    "we indeed observe that the ucfs of metallic armchair gnrs and zigzag gnrs with little intervalley scattering are always significantly larger than the ucfs of semiconducting armchair gnrs and zigzag gnrs with large intervalley scattering .",
    "we even find good quantitative agreement with the rmt values . only the ucfs for semiconducting armchair gnrs and zigzag gnrs with large intervalley scattering are somewhat larger than the theoretical prediction , probably due to the still small number of channels .",
    "we have carefully investigated the symmetry classifications of graphene nanoribbons with long - range disorder in the dirac limit , and studied their imprints on the conductance .",
    "table  [ sym_sum ] summarizes our findings .    in principle , all of the considered graphene nanoribbons are time - reversal symmetric in the absence of a magnetic field .",
    "however , if intervalley scattering is absent ( hence the condition of long - range disorder ) , this true trs that connects the two valleys is irrelevant , and the type of boundary is decisive for the symmetry properties .",
    "in particular , we have found that in the case of armchair gnrs ( that up to now were generally assumed to be in the orthogonal symmetry class ) it is necessary to distinguish between semiconducting and metallic variants : while semiconducting armchair gnrs inevitably mix valleys and thus belong to the orthogonal symmetry class , metallic armchair gnrs have a hidden pseudovalley structure that together with the boundary conditions places them into the unitary symmetry class .",
    "zigzag graphene nanoribbons have already previously@xcite been identified to belong to the unitary symmetry class .",
    "however , we have shown for this classification it is necessary that the fermi energy is larger than the disorder potential fluctuations .",
    "otherwise , local pn - junctions at the zigzag edge act as strong intervalley scatterers.@xcite we have demonstrated numerically that the intervalley scattering due to this mechanism can lead to complete valley mixing , although the disorder potential _ alone _ would not scatter valleys .",
    "hence , for zigzag nanoribbons to be in the unitary class it is not enough to be in the dirac limit and to have long - range disorder , there is also a restriction on the magnitude of the potential with respect to the fermi energy .",
    "the symmetries of the gnrs also have a strong influence on their quantum transport properties . in a metallic armchair gnr ,",
    "the pseudovalley structure manifests itself most conspicuously in a perfectly conducting channel , i.e.  a lower bound of one conductance quantum even in a strongly disordered nanoribbon .",
    "the perfectly conducting channel reveals itself most clearly in the strongly localized regime , but the symmetries of the gnrs also manifest themselves in the diffusive regime .",
    "we showed that weak localization is strongly suppressed in metallic armchair gnrs as well as zigzag gnrs with little intervalley scattering .",
    "in contrast , semiconducting armchair gnrs and zigzag gnrs with a disorder potential amplitude larger than the fermi energy exhibit weak localization ( instead of weak antilocalization expected for bulk graphene with long - range disorder ) due to intervalley scattering at the armchair edges and local pn - junction at the zigzag edge , respectively .",
    "in addition , the interplay of symmetry classes and the degeneracy of the ( pseudo)valley structure of metallic armchair gnrs and zigzag gnrs with little intervalley scattering leads to larger conductance fluctuations than in semiconducting armchair gnrs and zigzag gnrs with intervalley scattering .",
