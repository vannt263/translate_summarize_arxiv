    "the rms intensity contrast of the granulation is about 7.5% , which represents the highest angular resolution ever obtained in spectropolarimetric studies of the quiet sun .",
    "a visual inspection of the circular and linear polarization maps reveals a wealth of magnetic signals in the field of view ( fov ) .",
    "we estimate that 87.1% and 35.5% of the image show polarization signals larger than 3 and 4.5 times the noise level , respectively .",
    "to derive the vector magnetic field from the observed stokes profiles we use a least - square inversion technique based on milne - eddington ( me ) atmospheres .",
    "we assume a one - component , laterally homogeneous atmosphere together with stray / scattered light contamination .",
    "the inversion returns the values of 10 free parameters , including the three components of the magnetic field ( strength , inclination , and azimuth ) and the stray light factor , @xmath7 .",
    "the stray light intensity profile is evaluated individually for each pixel by averaging stokes @xmath8 within a box 1 wide centered on the pixel .",
    "we do not consider broadening of the spectra by macroturbulent velocities .",
    "the inversion is applied to the 630.15 and 630.25  nm lines simultaneously , using a gaussian of 2.5  pm  fwhm to account for the spectral resolving power of the sp .",
    "orozco surez et al .

    "the peak of the total pdf for the field strength is located at about 90  g. the curve decreases rapidly toward stronger fields : at around 1  kg it reaches a minimum and then shows a small hump centered at about 1.4  kg .",
    "strong fields ( @xmath161 kg ) are found in only 4.5% of the pixels , the majority of which correspond to network areas .",
    "it is important to emphasize that the pdf does not increase monotonically from 90  g to 0  g. this suggests that the inversions are not biased by noise , and that the peak at 90  g is likely solar in origin .",

    "[ fig : fig4 ] shows a steeper field strength distribution in granules as compared with intergranular lanes , i.e. , strong fields are much less abundant in granular regions .",
    "noticeable is the large fraction of very inclined ( @xmath1590@xmath11 ) fields in granules .",
    "although inclined fields are also common in downdrafts , the field lines tend to be more horizontal over convective upflows ( upper right panel of fig .",
    "[ fig : fig4 ] ) .",
    "the rapid increase of the pdf near 0@xmath11 and 180@xmath11 , however , indicates that vertical fields also exist in granules .    in the in ,",

    "this demonstrates that the in basically consists of hg flux concentrations . in the range 1 - 8  hg ,",
    "the pdf is well described by a lognormal function @xmath17 with @xmath18  g and @xmath19 .",
    "the shapes of the field strength distributions derived from the simulations and the in measurements are surprisingly similar .",
    "by contrast , the field inclination pdfs appear to be rather different , being much flatter in the simulations ( fig .",

    "figure  [ fig : fig5 ] shows the stray - light factor pdf for the full fov and in regions . both of them peak at @xmath20 . for reasons explained in orozco surez et al .",
    "( 2007b ) , we interpret the stray light contamination as a degradation of the polarization signals due to diffraction , but it might also represent filling factors different from 1 . in that case , the average fractional area of the pixel occupied by magnetic fields ( given by @xmath21 ) would be small , showing a peak at 0.2 .",
    "errors in the stray light determination would immediately lead to different field strengths and/or inclinations because most of the observed signals are formed in the weak - field regime .",
    "the high - spatial resolution allowed by the _",
    "sp , however , makes it possible to distinguish between field strength and stray - light factor unambiguously , even under weak field conditions .",
    "the key ingredient is stokes @xmath8 : the intensity profile is very sensitive to small variations in stray - light contamination .",
    "orozco surez et al .  (",
    "2007b ) have demonstrated that , in practice , the inversion code uses stokes @xmath8 to determine the stray light factor .",
    "for more details , including an analysis of the @xmath22 merit function minimized by the code , the interested reader is referred to their sect .",
    "the high spatial resolution spectropolarimetric measurements of _ hinode _ indicate that most in fields are weak .",
    "this is in agreement with the picture derived from the more magnetically sensitive lines at 1565  nm ( lin 1995 ; collados 2001 ; khomenko et al .",
    "2003 ; martnez gonzlez et al.2006b ) and from lines showing hyperfine structure such as 553  nm ( lpez ariste et al .",
    "2006 ) and 1526.2  nm ( asensio ramos et al.2007 ) .",
    "keller et al .  ( 1994 ) also found weak fields in the internetwork using the 525.0  nm lines , although at a lower spatial resolution and without inclination information .",

    "( 2004 ) from a hanle - effect interpretation of 460.7  nm measurements .",
    "interestingly , the slope of the field strength distribution in the in is similar to that obtained from magneto - convection simulations of comparable mean flux density .",
    "the observed field inclinations , however , turn out to be significantly larger than those predicted by the simulations .",
    "the scenario of an in filled by nearly horizontal hg fields is compatible with the large trasverse magnetic fluxes found in the in by lites et al .",
