    "this model was first proposed and studied in @xcite , and sometimes has received the name of chern - simons - schrdinger equation .",
    "the initial value problem , as well as global existence and blow - up , has been addressed in @xcite for the case @xmath19 .",
    "the existence of stationary states for and general @xmath20 has been studied recently in @xcite ( with respect to that paper , our notation interchanges the indices @xmath21 and @xmath22 ) . by using the ansatz : @xmath23 in @xcite it is found that @xmath24 solves the equation : : [ equation ] - u(x ) + ( + + + _ |x|^+ u^2(s ) ds ) u(x ) = |u(x)|^p-1u(x ) , x ^2,where @xmath25 here @xmath26 in @xmath27 is an integration constant of @xmath28 , which takes the form :    @xmath29    observe that is a nonlocal equation .",
    "moreover , in @xcite it is shown that is indeed the euler - lagrange equation of the energy functional : @xmath30 defined as @xmath31 here @xmath32 denotes the sobolev space of radially symmetric functions .",
    "it is important to observe that the energy functional @xmath33 presents a competition between the nonlocal term and the local nonlinearity .",
    "the study of the behavior of the functional under this competition is one of the main motivations of this paper .",
    "given a stationary solution , and taking @xmath34 in the gauge invariance , we obtain another stationary solution ; the functions @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37 are preserved , and @xmath38    therefore , the constant @xmath39 is a gauge invariant of the stationary solutions of the problem . by the above discussion we can take @xmath40 in what follows , that is , @xmath41 which was indeed assumed in @xcite .    for @xmath42 , it is shown in @xcite that @xmath43 is unbounded from below , so it exhibits a mountain - pass geometry . in a certain sense",
    ", in this case the local nonlinearity dominates the nonlocal term .",
    "however the existence of a solution is not so direct , since for @xmath44 the ( ps ) property is not known to hold .",
    "this problem is bypassed in @xcite by using a constrained minimization taking into account the nehari and pohozaev identities , in the spirit of @xcite . moreover ,",
    "infinitely many solutions have been found in @xcite for @xmath45 ( possibly sign - changing ) .",
    "a special case in the above equation is @xmath19 : in this case , static solutions can be found by passing to a self - dual equation , which leads to a liouville equation that can be solved explicitly .",
    "those are the unique positive solutions , as proved in @xcite . for more information on the self - dual equations , see @xcite .    in case @xmath2 ,",
    "solutions are found in @xcite as minimizers on a @xmath46 sphere .",
    "therefore , the value @xmath3 comes out as a lagrange multiplier , and it is not controlled .",
    "moreover , the global behavior of the energy functional @xmath43 is not studied .",
    "the main purpose of this paper is to study whether @xmath43 is bounded from below or not for @xmath47 . in this case",
    ", the nonlocal term prevails over the local nonlinearity , in a certain sense .",
    "as we shall see , the situation is quite rich and unexpected a priori , and very different from the usual nonlinear schrdinger equation .",
    "this situation differs also from the schrdinger - poisson problem ( see @xcite ) , which is another problem presenting a competition between local and nonlocal nonlinearities .",
    "we shall prove the existence of a threshold value @xmath48 such that @xmath43 is bounded from below if @xmath49 , and it is not for @xmath50 .",
    "but , in our opinion , what is most surprising is that @xmath48 has an explicit expression , namely : [ w0 bis ] _ 0= 3^  2^ ( ) ^- , with @xmath51    let us give an idea of the proofs .",
    "it is not difficult to show that @xmath43 is coercive when the problem is posed on a bounded domain .",
    "so , there exists a minimizer @xmath52 on the ball @xmath53 with dirichlet boundary conditions .",
    "to prove boundedness of @xmath52 , the problem is the possible loss of mass at infinity as @xmath54 .",
    "the core of our proofs is a detailed study of the behavior of those masses .",
    "we are able to show that , if unbounded , the sequence @xmath52 behaves as a soliton , if @xmath52 is interpreted as a function of a single real variable .",
    "the proof uses a careful study of the level sets of @xmath52 , which take into account the effect of the nonlocal term .",
    "then , the energy functional @xmath43 admits a natural approximation through a convenient limit functional . finally , the solutions of that limit functional , and their energy , can be found explicitly , so we can find @xmath48 .",
    "see section 2 for an heuristic explanation of the proof and a derivation of the limit functional .    regarding the existence of solutions , a priori",
    ", the global minimizer could correspond to the zero solution . and",
    "indeed this is the case for large @xmath3 .",
    "instead , we show that @xmath55 if @xmath56 is close to the threshold value . therefore , the global minimizer is not trivial , and corresponds to a positive solution .",
    "the mountain pass theorem will provide the existence of a second positive solution .    if @xmath57 , @xmath43 is unbounded from below , and hence the geometric assumptions of the mountain - pass theorem are satisfied .",
    "however , the boundedness of ( ps ) sequences seems to be a hard question in this case .",
    "solutions are found for almost all values of @xmath50 , by using the well - known monotonicity trick of struwe @xcite ( see also @xcite ) .",

    "will be indicated with a subscript",
    ". in particular , @xmath67 , @xmath68 are used to indicate the norms of the sobolev spaces of dimension @xmath21 .",

    ", we will frequently denote by @xmath70 , @xmath71 fixed constants , that may change from line to line , but are always independent of the variable under consideration .",
    "we also use the notations @xmath72 to describe the asymptotic behaviors of quantities in a standard way . finally the letters @xmath73 , @xmath74 indicate two - dimensional variables and @xmath75 , @xmath76 denote one - dimensional variables .",
    "let us start with the following proposition , proved in @xcite :    @xmath43 is a @xmath77 functional , and its critical points correspond to classical solutions of .",
    "next result deals with the behavior of @xmath43 under weak limits in @xmath32 . even if it is not explicitly stated in this form , proposition [ prop : weak ] follows easily from ( * ? ? ?",

    "to finish the account of preliminaries , we now state an inequality which will prove to be fundamental in our analysis .",

    "is concerned with boundedness from below of @xmath43 .",
    "let us give a rough idea of the arguments of our proof .",

    "therefore , it is natural to define the limit functional @xmath95 , @xmath96    as a consequence of the above argument , if @xmath97 attains negative values , then @xmath43 will be unbounded from below .",
    "the reverse is also true , but the proof is more delicate . we will show that if @xmath52 is unbounded in @xmath65 and @xmath98 is bounded from above , then somehow @xmath52 contains a certain mass spreading to infinity , as @xmath99 does .",
    "this will be made explicit in proposition [ prop - fund ] . but",
    "this will lead us to a contradiction if @xmath97 is positive on that mass .",
    "the proof of this argument is however far from trivial , and is the core of this paper .    summing up",
    ", we are able to relate @xmath43 with the limit functional @xmath97 in the following way : @xmath100 moreover this characterization will give us the threshold value for @xmath3 , since the critical points of @xmath97 can be found explicitly , as will be shown in next section .",
    "in this section we deal with the limit functional @xmath101 , [ def j ] j_(u)= 1 2 _ -^+ ( |u|^2 + u^2 ) dr + ( _ -^+u^2 dr ) ^3 - _ -^+|u|^p+1 dr .",
    "clearly , the euler - lagrange equation of is the following problem : [ limit ] -u  + u + 1 4 ( _ -^+u^2(s ) ds ) ^2 u = |u|^p-1 u , .    as we shall see later , we will find the explicit solutions of later .",
    "but , first , let us study it from a variational point of view : this study will give us some further information on the solutions .    before going on ,",
    "we need a technical result , which is stated in next lemma .",
    "we think that such result must be well - known , but we have not been able to find a explicit reference .    [ lemmino ]",
