    "one of the basic advantages of the heavy - ion collisions at relativistic energies is the production of large number of particles in each event , which facilitates the event - by - event study of several observables .",
    "the major physics goals at these high energies are to understand the nature of phase transition from normal hadronic matter to a phase of quark - gluon plasma ( qgp ) .",
    "this topic has been of tremendous interest over last four decades , both in terms of theoretical studies and large scale experiments .",
    "dedicated experiments have been performed at the alternating gradient synchrotron ( ags ) and relativistic heavy ion collider ( rhic ) at brookhaven national laboratory , and the super proton synchrotron ( sps ) and the large hadron collider ( lhc ) at cern to search as well as study the qgp phase .",
    "these experiments explore the qcd phase transition .",
    "the fluctuations of experimentally accessible quantities , such as particle multiplicity , mean transverse momentum , temperature , particle ratios , and other global observables are related to the thermodynamic properties of the system , such as the entropy , specific heat , chemical potential and matter compressibility  @xcite .",
    "fluctuations of these quantities on an event - by - event basis have been used as basic tools for understanding the particle production mechanisms , the nature of the phase transition and critical fluctuations at the qcd phase boundary .",
    "a non - monotonic behaviour of the fluctuations as a function of collision centrality and energy may signal the onset of deconfinement , and can be effectively used to probe the critical point in the qcd phase diagram .",
    "theoretical models , based on lattice qcd , reveal that at vanishing baryon chemical potential ( @xmath0 ) , the transition from qgp to hadron gas is a crossover , whereas at large @xmath0 , the phase transition is of first order  @xcite .",
    "experimental observables at sps and rhic energies may point to the onset of deconfinement and a hint of first order phase transition has been indicated  @xcite .",
    "first order phase transitions can lead to large density fluctuations resulting in bubble or droplet formation and hot spots  @xcite , which give rise to large multiplicity fluctuations in a given rapidity interval .",
    "the local multiplicity fluctuations have been predicted as a signature of critical hadronisation at rhic and lhc energies  @xcite .",
    "measurements at the vanishing @xmath1 at lhc energies will be important as one can accurately calculate several quantities and their fluctuations .",
    "the multiplicity of produced particles is an important quantity which characterises the system produced in heavy - ion collisions .",
    "consequently , multiplicity and its fluctuation has an effect on all other measurements .",
    "multiplicity fluctuations have been characterised by the scaled variances of the multiplicity distributions , defined as , @xmath2 where @xmath3 and @xmath4 are the mean and variance of the multiplicity distribution , respectively .",
    "multiplicity fluctuations have been reported by e802 experiment  @xcite at ags , wa98  @xcite , na49  @xcite , na61  @xcite and ceres  @xcite experiments at sps , and the phenix experiment  @xcite at rhic . the nature of the multiplicity distributions as a function of centrality and beam energy has been compared to statistical and available model calculations .",
    "these results have generated a great deal of interest  @xcite .",
    "multiplicity fluctuations have contributions from statistical ( random ) components as well as those which have dynamical ( deterministic ) origin .",
    "the statistical components have contributions from the choice of centrality , fluctuation in impact parameter or number of participants , finite particle multiplicity , effect of limited acceptance of the detectors , fluctuations in the number of primary collisions , effect of rescattering , etc .",
    "the statistical components of the multiplicity fluctuations have direct impact on the fluctuations in other measured quantities .",
    "the dynamical part of the fluctuations contain interesting physics associated with the collision , which include time evolution of fluctuations at different stages of the collision , hydrodynamic expansion , hadronisation and freeze - out . in order to extract the dynamical part of the fluctuations , the contribution to multiplicity from statistical components has to be well understood .",
    "we discuss the methods for controlling geometrical fluctuations so that dynamical fluctuations , if present , become more prominent .    in this article , we present a study of charged particle multiplicity fluctuations as a function of centrality and beam - energy for au+au collisions for the beam energy scan ( bes ) energies at rhic ( from @xmath5  =  7.7  gev to 200 gev ) and pb+pb collisions at lhc - energy ( @xmath5  =  2.76  tev ) from the available experimental data as well as using different modes of the ampt ( a multi - phase transport ) model  @xcite . in the next section",

    "multiplicity distributions for all the collision energies are presented in section iv .",
    "the results of multiplicity fluctuations are given in section v. a discussion of the results is presented in section vi and the paper is summarised in section vii .",
    "the ampt model  @xcite is used as a guidance for obtaining multiplicity distributions and fluctuations wherever the experimental data are not available .",
    "the model consists of four main components : the initial conditions , partonic interactions , the conversion from the partonic to the hadronic matter , and hadronic interactions .",
    "the model provides two modes : default and string melting ( sm )  @xcite . in both the cases ,",
    "the initial conditions are taken from hijing  @xcite with two wood - saxon type radial density profile of the colliding nuclei .",
    "the multiple scattering among the nucleons of two heavy ion nuclei are governed by the eikonal formalism . in the default mode , energetic partons recombine and hadrons are produced via string fragmentation .",
    "the string fragmentation takes place via the lund string fragmentation function , given by , @xmath6 interactions of the produced hadrons are described by a relativistic transport model ( art ) .    in the sm mode",
    ", the strings produced from hijing are decomposed into partons which are fed into the parton cascade along with the minijet partons .",
    "the partonic matter coalesce to produce hadrons , and the hadronic interactions are subsequently modelled using art .",
    "while the default mode describes the collision evolution in terms of strings and minijets followed by string fragmentation , the sm mode includes a fully partonic qgp phase that hadronises through quark coalescence .    for both the modes ,",
    "boltzmann equations are solved using zhang s parton cascade ( zpc ) with total parton elastic scattering cross section , @xmath7 where @xmath8 is the strong coupling constant , @xmath9 and @xmath10 are the mandelstam variables and @xmath3 is the debye screening mass .",
    "here @xmath11 , @xmath12 ( fragmentation parameters ) , @xmath8 and @xmath3 are the key deciding factors for multiplicity yield at particular beam energy .",

    "the mean values of multiplicities are found to match to the experimental data with these tunings .",
    "the ampt model , therefore , provides a convenient way to investigate a variety of observables with the default and sm modes .",
    "the particle production mechanisms are expected to be dependent on the collision energy as well as the centrality of the collision . for most of the analysis ,",
    "it is important to consider proper centrality window so that fluctuations because of the selection are minimised .",
    "centrality of a collision is characterised by the impact parameter ( @xmath12 ) of the collision or equivalently the average number of participating nucleons ( @xmath15  ) . in an experimental scenario",
    "it is not possible to access these two quantities , so charged particle multiplicities within a given rapidity range or energy depositions by calorimeters are used . in a model",
    "dependent way , the connections of these experimental quantities to @xmath12 or @xmath15  are made .",

    "the inherent fluctuations are intrinsic fluctuations arising from the difference in geometry even within the centrality bin .",
    "a centrality bin scans a range of charged particle multiplicity with different cross sections .",
    "this introduces geometrical fluctuations which need to be controlled .",
    "choosing very narrow centrality window minimises the geometrical fluctuations .",
    "but it may not be always possible to present the results in such narrow bins , mainly because of lack of statistics and also because of centrality resolution of detectors used .",
    "it is desirable to choose somewhat wider centrality bins , such as 5% or 10% of the total cross sections .",
    "but these choices introduce inherent fluctuations which need to be corrected .",
    "this is done by taking the weighted average of the observables , such as , @xmath29 where the index @xmath30 runs over each multiplicity bin , @xmath31 represents various moments for the @xmath30-th bin , and @xmath32 is the number of events in the @xmath30-th multiplicity bin .",

    "the fluctuations for the 5% cross section bins reduce by close to @xmath35 and @xmath36 , respectively for central and peripheral collisions , and almost coincide with that of the 1% cross section bin .",
    "no centrality bin width dependence is observed after employing the correction .",
