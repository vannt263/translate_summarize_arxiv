    "the development of a network structure results , for example , from step polymerization , chain addition polymerization and cross  linking of polymer chains.@xcite the same phenomenon is also observed in colloids and other soft materials when the thermodynamics and the molecular architecture favor the formation of a limited number of strong interactions ( i.e. , with attraction strength much larger than the thermal energy ) between different particles .",
    "chemical gelation has been extensively studied in the past , starting from the pioneering work of flory and stockmayer@xcite who developed the first mean  field description of gelation , providing expressions for the cluster size distribution as a function of the extent of reaction and the _ critical _ behavior of the connectivity properties close to gelation .",
    "more appropriate descriptions based on geometric percolation concepts have , in the late seventies , focused on the non  mean field character of the transition , which reveals itself near the gel point , extending to percolation the ideas developed in the study of the properties of systems close to a second  order critical point .",
    "several important numerical studies,@xcite most of them based on simulations on lattice have focused on the critical behavior close to the percolation point , providing evidence of the percolative nature of the transition and accurate estimates of the percolation critical exponents . as in critical phenomena , a crossover from mean  field to percolation behavior is expected close to the gel transition.@xcite but , how the microscopic properties of the system control the location of the crossover ( i.e. , how wide is the region where the mean  field description applies ) and how accurate is the mean  field description far from the percolation point is not completely understood .",

    "every time , during the dynamic evolution , the distance between two mutually  reactive sites becomes smaller than a predefined distance @xmath13 , a new bond is formed between the particles . to model irreversible gelation ,",
    "once a bond is formed , it is made irreversible by switching on an infinite barrier at distance @xmath14 between the sites @xmath15 and @xmath16 involved , which prevents both the formation of new bonds in the same sites and the breaking of the existing one . hence , the newly formed bond can not break any longer , and the maximum distance between the two reacted sites is constrained to remain smaller than @xmath17 . similarly , the two reacted sites can not form further bonds with available unreacted sites .",
    "the composition of the system and the particle functionality are such that the reactive sites of type @xmath0 and @xmath1 are initially present in equal number , @xmath18 , which in principle allows the formation of a fully bonded state in which all the sites have reacted .",

    "in the starting configurations no bonds are present by construction . as a function of time , the fraction @xmath19 of formed bonds a measure of the state of advancement of the reaction increases monotonically , until most of the particles are connected in one single cluster ( figure  [ fig : conv ] ) . as a result , @xmath19 saturates around @xmath25 , despite the fact that an equal number of reactive sites of type @xmath0 and @xmath1 is initially present in the system .",
    "flory and stockmayer@xcite laid out the basic relations between extent of reaction and resulting structure in step polymerizations , on the assumptions that all functional groups of a given type are equally reactive , all groups react independently of one another , and that ring formation does not occur in molecular species of finite size .",
    "only when @xmath19 exceeds a critical value @xmath26 infinitely large molecules can grow.@xcite in this respect the fs theory describes the gelation transition as the random percolation of permanent bonds on a loopless lattice.@xcite the present model satisfies the conditions of equal and independent reactivity of all reactive sites .",
    "the absence of closed bonding loops in finite size clusters is not a priori implemented ; as we will show in the following , however , such a condition favored by the poor flexibility of the bonded particles and their elongated shape , the absence of an underlying lattice and the asymmetric location of the reactive sites is valid in a surprisingly wide region of @xmath19 values .",
    "the fs theory predicts the @xmath19 dependence of the cluster size distribution in the very general case of a mixture of monomers bearing mutually reactive groups.@xcite in the present case , the number @xmath27 of clusters containing @xmath28 bifunctional particles and @xmath8 pentafunctional ones can be written as @xmath29 and the number of clusters of size @xmath30 is obtained by summing over all contributions such that @xmath31 , i.e. , @xmath32 .",

    "the relative amount of @xmath1 particles in the sol ( @xmath46 ) increases as a consequence of the preferential transfer of the @xmath0 particles ( having more reactive sites ) to the gel , in a way that the fraction @xmath47 of sites @xmath1 in the sol that have reacted ( extent of reaction in the sol ) differs from the total fraction @xmath19 of sites @xmath1 reacted ( extent of reaction in the system ) .",

    "are shown in figure  [ fig : gelsol]b .",
    "both averages increase before gelation ; then , they regress in the sol existing beyond the gel point , since large clusters are preferentially incorporated into the gel network . while @xmath54 increases only slightly up to the gel point ,",
    "never exceeding 3.5 , @xmath55 increases sharply in proximity of @xmath26 as well as sharply decreases beyond this point , consistently with the fact that @xmath59 is singular at percolation being dominated by large clusters .",
    "again , simulation data agree very well with fs predictions .",
    "discrepancies between theory and simulation which reveal the mean  field character of the fs theory only concern the range of @xmath19 very near @xmath26 , suggesting that for this model the crossover from mean  field to percolation is very close to the gel point  i.e. , the ginzburg zone@xcite near the gel point , where non  mean field effects are important , is very limited .",
    "a finite  size study very close to the critical point would be requested to accurately locate the percolation point and the critical exponents , a calculation beyond the scope of the present work .    from a physical point of view",
    ", the change from mean  field to percolation universality class is rooted in the presence of bonding loops in the clusters of finite size , which pre - empts the possibility to predict the cluster size distribution .",
    "the realistic estimate of the percolation threshold and the agreement between theory and simulation ( fig .",
    "[ fig : distr ] ) suggest that the present model strongly disfavors the formation of loops in finite clusters , at least for cluster sizes probed in this finite  size system . as a test",
    ", we evaluate the total number of finite ( sol ) clusters @xmath62 as a function of the extent of reaction .",
    "if finite clusters do not contain closed loops , @xmath56 equals the number of particles in the sol minus the number of bonds , since each added bond decreases the number of clusters by one .",
    "this applies equally to the system preceding gelation , or to the sol existing beyond the gel point .",
    "thus , at @xmath63 ( pre  gelation ) the relation between @xmath56 and @xmath19 is linear , i.e. @xmath64 . at @xmath65 ( post ",
    "gelation ) , @xmath56 can be calculated as @xmath66 , where @xmath67 is the number of particles in the sol fraction ( @xmath49 of which bear reactive sites of type @xmath1 ) , and @xmath68 is the reacted fraction of sites b in the sol .",
    "hence , the relation between @xmath56 and @xmath19 crosses to a nonlinear behavior , so that the number of clusters becomes one when @xmath22 .",
    "as shown in figure  [ fig : gelsol]c , the number of finite clusters found in the simulation data conforms to the theoretical expectation for all @xmath19 values , both below and above the gel point .",
    "hence , as a first approximation , loops are only present in the infinite ( percolating ) cluster and do not significantly alter the distribution of the finite size clusters , both below and above percolation .",
    "the difference between @xmath56 found in simulation and the value predicted by the fs theory counts the number of loops in the sol , @xmath57 .",
    "such a quantity is shown in the inset of figure  [ fig : gelsol]c .",
    "the maximum value of @xmath57 , achieved for @xmath69 , corresponds to @xmath70 of the total number of bonds .",
    "this demonstrates that intramolecular bonds within finite clusters can be neglected , consistent with the flory hypothesis for the post ",
    "gelation regime@xcite .",
    "figure  [ fig : gelsol]c also shows that the linear relation between @xmath56 and @xmath19 is valid also after the gel point ( up to @xmath71 ) .",
    "this finding is in full agreement with recent experimental studies@xcite on the polymerization of bifunctional diglycidyl  ether of with pentafunctional diethylenetriamine , also suggesting that the number of cyclic connections in the infinite cluster is negligible well above @xmath26 .    as a further confirmation of the absence of closed loops",
    "we compare the time evolution of @xmath19 with the prediction of the mean  field kinetic modeling of polymerization , based on the solution of the smoluchowski coagulation equation.@xcite for loopless aggregation , @xmath72 is predicted to follow @xmath73 where the fit ",
    "parameter @xmath24 , which has the meaning of a bond kinetic constant , fixes the time scale of the aggregation process .",
    "the time evolution of @xmath19 is found to perfectly agree with the theoretical predictions@xcite ( see figure  [ fig : conv ] ) up to @xmath74 , i.e. beyond @xmath75 .",
    "while the prediction would suggest that @xmath76 ( dash line in figure  [ fig : conv ] ) , the simulation shows that the formation of a percolating structure prevents the possibility of completing the chemical reaction , leaving a finite number of unreacted sites frozen in the structure . as shown above ( figure  [ fig : distr ] ) , even in this frozen state the cluster size distribution is provided by the flory s post  gel hypothesis .",
    "such a feature is not captured by the mean  field smoluchowski equation in which spatial information in the kernels are neglected .",
    "a binary mixture of patchy hard ellipsoids undergoing chemical gelation displays a very large interval of the extent of reaction in which parameter ",
    "free mean  field predictions are extremely accurate .",
    "the connectivity properties of the model are properly described  without any fitting parameter  both below and above percolation by the mean  field loopless classical fs theory.@xcite the mean  field cluster size distribution for the sol component is found to be valid for all values of the extent of reaction , both below and above the gel point , suggesting that for the present model , the flory s",
    "hypothesis for the post ",
    "gelation regime properly describes the irreversible aggregation phenomenon , despite the explicit consideration of the excluded volume .    the absence of loops in finite size clusters , which is not assumed by the model , results from the specific geometry of the bonding pattern and by the presence of the excluded volume interactions , disfavoring the formation of ordered bonding domains .",
    "hence , the geometry of the particles and the location of the reactive sites on them may play a significant role in the stabilization of the mean  field universality class with respect to the percolation universality class,@xcite locating the crossover between the two classes@xcite very close to the gel point .",
    "the present study shows that irreversibly aggregating asymmetric hard ",
    "core patchy particles , even if excluded volume effects are properly taken into account , may provide a close realization of the fs predictions in a wide range of @xmath19 values .",
    "the model thus offers a starting point for which theoretical predictions are available for further investigations of the gelation process and for a more precise control over the structure and connectivity of the gel state .",
    "in particular , a full and detailed structural information can be known along with the dynamics of the system , which is potentially useful to investigate the relation between structural heterogeneity and heterogeneous dynamics,@xcite and to shed light on the microscopic aspects of the dynamic crossover from short@xcite to long relaxation times,@xcite during irreversible polymerization .    while the structural properties are all well ",
    "described by the fs theory , the evolution of the extent of reaction , modeled via the coagulation smoluchowski equation , is properly described by the theory only in the pre  gelation region .",
    "after gelation , kinetic constraints due to the absence of mobility of the reactive sites anchored to the percolating cluster or to smaller clusters trapped inside the percolating matrix prevent the completion of the reaction and the extent of reaction freezes ( to @xmath77 in the present case ) before reaching one ( as eq .",
    "2 would predict ) .",
    "a proper modeling of the long  time behavior will require the insertion of spatial information inside the kernels entering the smoluchowski equation .",
    "the freezing of the extent of reaction at long times correspondingly freezes the cluster size distribution to that predicted by flory for the reached @xmath19 value .    in the present model",
    ", the entire polymerization process proceeds via a sequence of fs cluster size distributions , determined by @xmath72 .",
    "recently , it has been shown that the fs theory properly describes also equilibrium clustering in patchy particle systems when @xmath19 is a function of temperature and density.@xcite it is thus tempting to speculate that for loopless models , irreversible evolution can be put in correspondence with a sequence of _ equilibrium _ states which could be sampled in the same system for finite values of the ratio between temperature and bonding depth .",
    "if this is indeed the case , chemical gelation could be formally described as a deep quench limit of physical gelation .",
    "this correspondence would facilitate the transfer of knowledge from recent studies of equilibrium gels@xcite to chemical ones .",
    "concepts developed for irreversible aggregation of colloidal particles , like diffusion and reaction  limited cluster  cluster aggregation , could be connected to chemical gelation .",
