    "understanding the spin structure of the proton is one of the most challenging problems facing subatomic physics : how is the spin of the proton built up out from the intrinsic spin and orbital angular momentum of its quark and gluonic constituents ?",
    "what happens to spin in the transition between current and constituent quarks in low - energy qcd ?",
    "key issues include the role of polarized glue and gluon topology in building up the spin of the proton .",
    "measurements of the proton s @xmath0 spin structure function in polarized deep inelastic scattering have been interpreted to imply a small value for the flavour - singlet axial - charge : @xmath1 this result is particularly interesting @xcite because @xmath2 is interpreted in the parton model as the fraction of the proton s spin which is carried by the intrinsic spin of its quark and antiquark constituents .",
    "the value ( [ eqa1 ] ) is about half the prediction of relativistic constituent quark models ( @xmath3 ) .",
    "it corresponds to a negative strange - quark polarization @xmath4 ( polarized in the opposite direction to the spin of the proton ) .",
    "the small value of @xmath5 extracted from polarized deep inelastic scattering has inspired vast experimental and theoretical activity to understand the spin structure of the proton ( and related connections to the axial u(1 ) problem ) .",
    "new experiments are underway or being planned to map out the proton s spin - flavour structure and to measure the amount of spin carried by polarized gluons in the polarized proton  for a review see @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we explain the spin sum rule connecting @xmath0 and @xmath2 and how additional valuable information could be obtained from a precision measurement of neutrino proton elastic scattering .",
    "sum rules for polarized deep inelastic scattering are derived starting from the dispersion relation for photon nucleon scattering : @xmath6 here @xmath7 is the first form - factor in the spin dependent part of the forward compton amplitude which is related to the @xmath0 spin structure function via @xmath8 and @xmath9 denotes a possible subtraction constant ( `` subtraction at infinity '' ) from the circle when we close the contour in the complex plane @xcite .",
    "( @xmath10 denotes the proton mass . )",
    "the value of @xmath2 extracted from polarized deep inelastic scattering is obtained as follows .",
    "one applies the operator product expansion and finds that the first moment of the structure function @xmath0 is related to the scale - invariant axial charges of the target nucleon : @xmath11 here @xmath12 , @xmath13 and @xmath14 are the isovector , su(3 ) octet and scale - invariant flavour - singlet axial charges respectively .",
    "the wilson coefficients @xmath15 and @xmath16 are calculable in @xmath17-loop perturbative qcd @xcite .",
    "one then assumes no twist - two subtraction constant ( @xmath18 ) so that the axial charge contributions saturate the first moment at leading twist .",
    "the first moment of @xmath0 is constrained by low energy weak interactions . for proton states",
    "@xmath19 with momentum @xmath20 and spin @xmath21 @xmath22 here @xmath23 is the isovector axial charge measured in neutron beta - decay ; @xmath24 is the octet charge measured independently in hyperon beta decays ( using su(3 ) ) @xcite .",
    "the scale - invariant flavour - singlet axial charge @xmath14 is defined by @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the gauge - invariantly renormalized singlet axial - vector operator and @xmath27 is a renormalization group factor which corrects for the two - loop anomalous dimension @xmath28 of @xmath29 and which goes to one in the limit @xmath30 .    in the isovector channel the bjorken sum rule @xcite for the isovector part of @xmath0 , @xmath31 ,",
    "has been confirmed in polarized deep inelastic scattering experiments at the level of 10% .",
    "substituting the values of @xmath12 and @xmath13 from beta - decays ( and assuming no subtraction constant correction ) in the first moment equation ( [ eqcch ] ) polarized deep inelastic data implies @xmath32 for the flavour singlet moment .",
    "the small @xmath33 extrapolation of @xmath0 data is the largest source of experimental error on measurements of the nucleon s axial charges from deep inelastic scattering .",
    "qcd theoretical analysis leads to the formula @xcite : @xmath34 where @xmath35 here @xmath36 is the amount of spin carried by polarized gluon partons in the polarized proton and @xmath37 measures the spin carried by quarks and antiquarks carrying `` soft '' transverse momentum @xmath38 where @xmath39 is the light quark mass and @xmath40 is a typical gluon virtuality ; @xmath41 denotes a non - perturbative gluon topological contribution which has support only at bjorken @xmath33 equal to zero ( so that it can not be measured in polarized deep inelastic scattering ) @xcite .",
    "since @xmath42 under qcd evolution , the polarized gluon term @xmath43 $ ] in eq.([eqa3 ] ) scales as @xmath30 @xcite .",
    "the polarized gluon contribution corresponds to two - quark - jet events carrying large transverse momentum @xmath44 in the final state from photon - gluon fusion @xcite .",
    "the topological term @xmath41 may be identified with a leading twist `` subtraction at infinity '' in the original dispersion relation ( [ eqcj ] ) , whence @xmath5 is identified with @xmath45 @xcite .",
    "it probes the role of gluon topology in dynamical axial u(1 ) symmetry breaking in the transition from current to constituent quarks in low energy qcd .",
    "the deep inelastic measurement of @xmath2 , eq.([eqa1 ] ) , is not necessarily inconsistent with the constituent quark model prediction 0.6 _ if _ a substantial fraction of the spin of the constituent quark is associated with gluon topology in the transition from constituent to current quarks ( measured in polarized deep inelastic scattering ) .    understanding the transverse momentum dependence of the contributions to ( [ eqa3 ] ) is essential to ensure that the theory and experimental acceptance are correctly matched when extracting information from semi - inclusive measurements about the individual valence , sea and gluonic contributions @xcite .",
    "recent semi - inclusive measurements @xcite using a forward detector and limited acceptance at large transverse momentum ( @xmath44 ) exhibit no evidence for the large negative polarized strangeness polarization extracted from inclusive data and may , perhaps , be more comparable with @xmath37 than the inclusive measurement ( [ eqa2 ] ) , which has the polarized gluon contribution included . further semi - inclusive measurements with increased luminosity and a 4@xmath46 detector would be valuable .    a direct measurement of the strange quark axial charge could be made using neutrino proton elastic scattering .",
    "neutrino proton elastic scattering measures the proton s weak axial charge @xmath48 through elastic z@xmath49 exchange .",
    "because of anomaly cancellation in the standard model the weak neutral current couples to the combination @xmath50 , _ viz .",
    "_ @xmath51 it measures the combination @xmath52 where @xmath53 , @xmath54 and @xmath55 quark contributions to @xmath48 . working to nlo and expressing the result in terms of just renormalization scale invariant quantities",
    "one finds the result @xcite @xmath56 where @xmath57 is a polynomial in the running couplings @xmath58 , @xmath59 here @xmath60 denotes the scale - invariant version of @xmath61 and @xmath58 denotes witten s renormalization group invariant running couplings for heavy quark physics . taking @xmath62 , @xmath63 and @xmath64 in ( [ eqdl ] ) , one finds a small heavy - quark correction factor @xmath65 , with lo terms dominant .",
    "modulo the small heavy - quark corrections quoted above , a precision measurement of @xmath66 , together with @xmath12 would provide a rigorous weak interaction determination of @xmath67 .",
    "the axial charge measured in @xmath47 elastic scattering is independent of any assumptions about the presence or absence of a `` subtraction at infinity '' correction to the first moment of @xmath0 and the @xmath68 behaviour of @xmath0 .",
