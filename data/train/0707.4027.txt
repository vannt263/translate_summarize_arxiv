    "the total kinetic powers of agn jets is one of the most basic physical quantities of the jet .",
    "it is however difficult to estimate @xmath0 , since most of the observed emissions from agn jets are of non - thermal electron origin , and the electromagnetic signals from the thermal and/or proton components is hard to detect .",
    "hence , the free parameter describing the amount of the invisible plasma components always lurks in the estimates of @xmath0 based on the non - thermal emissions .",
    "recently , @xcite ( hereafter kk05 ) proposed a new estimate of @xmath0 for frii radio galaxies based on the dynamical model of cocoon .",
    "jets in powerful radio galaxies are expected inflate a cocoon into the surrounding intra - cluster medium ( icm ) which is overpressured against the icm @xcite . from their model , @xmath0 and @xmath1 can be derived by comparing the cocoon model with the actual morphologies of the cocoon based on the radio observations . however , at the moment , this model has been only applied to cygnus a. the extension of the number of samples are evidently crucial for exploring general characteristics of powerful agn jets . for this purpose , we apply the method of kk05 ( with a slight modification ) to four fr ii radio galaxies ( cygnus a , 3c 223 , 3c 284 , and 3c 219 ) .",
    "following kk05 , we briefly summarize the dynamics of cocoon in over - pressured regime , namely @xmath7 , where @xmath8 and @xmath9 are the cocoon pressure and the pressure of the ambient icm , respectively . the basic equations which describe the equation of motion along jet axis , equation of motion of the sideways expansion , and the energy equation",
    "are expressed , respectively , as @xmath10 @xmath11 @xmath12 where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 , @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 are the velocity of jet , the density of ambient medium , the advance velocity of cocoon head , the velocity of sideways expansion , the cross sectional area of cocoon head , and the specific heat ratio of plasma inside cocoon , respectively . in these equations",
    "we also assume that the jet is relativistic , and that @xmath0 is constant in time .",
    "@xmath19 , @xmath20 , and @xmath21 are the distance from the jet apex to the hotspot , the radius of the cocoon body , and the volume of the cocoon where @xmath22 is the initial time of source evolution .",
    "the declining mass density of icm @xmath14 is given by @xmath23 where @xmath24 .",
    "a cartoon of the cocoon model is illustrated in fig .",
    "[ cocoon ] .",
    "we slightly improve the model of kk05 as follows ; ( i ) the geometrical factor of @xmath25 is more accurate , and ( ii ) the inclusion of @xmath26 work done by cocoon .",
    "we further assume the lateral expansion of the cocoon as @xmath27 , where @xmath28 is the cross sectional area of cocoon body . by assuming that all physical quantities also have a time - dependence of form @xmath29 , @xmath16 is determined as @xmath30 from this",
    ", we obtain the following expressions : @xmath31 @xmath32 @xmath33 where @xmath34/[4-(1 - 0.5\\alpha)x]$ ] , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath37^{-\\alpha}$ ] , and @xmath38 .",
    "note that the only difference from kk05 is @xmath39 .",
    "although it is not dealt in the present study , the main difference from the previous models @xcite is that these solutions can describe non - self - similar evolution .",
    "note that when self - similar condition is imposed , time dependence in the physical quantities becomes identical to these previous models .    throughout this paper ,",
    "we assume @xmath40 since cocoon is expected to be dominated by relativistic particles @xcite .",
    "we also assume that the aspect ratio of the cocoon ( @xmath41 ) to be constant in time ( self - similar evolution ) .",
    "since @xmath42 , this assumption leads to @xmath43 .",
    "by substituting the observed values of @xmath44 , @xmath45 ( or @xmath46 ) , @xmath47 , @xmath48 , and @xmath49 in eq .",
    "( [ pbar ] ) - ( [ ahbar ] ) , @xmath0 , @xmath1 , and also @xmath50 are determined uniquely . in this section , we explain how to extract these quantities from the observations and show the obtained @xmath0 and @xmath1    in the left panels of fig .",
    "[ radiopower ] , we show the vla radio images of cygnus a , 3c 223 , 3c 284 , and 3c 219 in logarithmic scale . contours in linear scale ( green lines ) are also displayed for the purpose to determine the position of hotspot accurately .",
    "the overlaid straight lines which crosses perpendicular to each others at the hotspot are the lines we used to measure @xmath51 ( black lines ) and @xmath17 ( red lines ) . here",
    ", @xmath17 is measured as the cross sectional area of the radio lobe at the position of the hotspot .",
    "contrary to @xmath17 , it is difficult to measure @xmath52 from the vla radio images since the cocoon emission coming from the cross section perpendicular to the agn core location is very dim at ghz radio frequency because of the synchrotron cooling",
    ". therefore , we treat @xmath53 as a free parameter . in order to take account of large ambiguity",
    ", we examine sufficiently wide range of @xmath54 . in the present study , we neglect projection effect on @xmath51 for simplicity . under the assumption of self - similar evolution , @xmath0 and @xmath1",
    "depend on @xmath51 as @xmath55 and @xmath56 , respectively .",
    "however , since the angle to the line of sight is not expected to deviate largely from @xmath57 in radio galaxies , this effect does not cause significant change in our results .",
    "the adopted values of @xmath14 , @xmath49 , and @xmath9 are based on the literatures of @xcite for cygnus a , @xcite for 3c 223 and 3c 284 , and @xcite for 3c 219 , respectively .",
    "note that since most of the radio sources show asymmetries in their shape among the pair of the lobes ( fig .",
    "[ radiopower ] ) , we analyze each side of the lobe independently .",
    "however , we only analyze jet in the western side for 3c 219 since the eastern lobe showed severe deformation .",
    "the resultant @xmath0 and @xmath1 are displayed in the right panels of figs .",
    "[ radiopower ] .",
    "the red lines displayed in the figure are the resultant range of @xmath0 and @xmath1 , and their ranges reflect the uncertainty in @xmath58 .",
    "the age and power depend on the aspect ratio @xmath58 as @xmath59@xmath60 and @xmath61@xmath62 , and , therefore , satisfy @xmath63 .",
    "since @xmath49 does not exceed @xmath64 in any of four sources , a lower aspect ratio corresponds to a higher power with a lower age .",
    "the range included in the shaded region is the forbidden region since the overpressure condition is violated .",
    "the eddington luminosity ( @xmath2 ) of each source , is also shown ( green line ) in these figure for comparison .",
    "the black hole masses ( @xmath65 ) are taken from @xcite for cygnus a , @xcite for 3c 223 and 3c 219 .",
    "for 3c284 , we derive @xmath65 from the b - band magnitude of host galaxy @xcite by using the empirical correlation of b - band magnitude and black hole mass @xcite . in table",
    "[ table3 ] , we summarize the allowed values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 and the other relevant physical properties of the cocoon . reflecting the asymmetries in their shape , the obtained @xmath0 and @xmath1 show discrepancy among the pair of lobes especially in 3c 223 and 3c 284 , and 3c 219 .",
    "since it seems natural to suppose that the properties of the jets are intrinsically symmetric and equal power and age on both side , we expect that the discrepancy is due to the asymmetry and/or inhomogeneity of icm density profile .",
    "here we interpret that the actual values of @xmath0 and @xmath1 is in the range obtained from both lobes .",

    "in table [ table3 ] , the total kinetic power of the jet normalized by the corresponding eddington luminosity , @xmath76 , is displayed .",

    "it is intriguing to explore how much amount of the internal energy , @xmath80 , is deposited in the cocoon compared with the widely - discussed minimum energy , @xmath5 , of the radio lobe obtained from the minimum energy condition for the non - thermal electrons and magnetic fields . here",

    "@xmath4 exceeds @xmath5 , and the range of the ratio is obtained as @xmath82 .",
    "this implies that minimum energy condition is unlikely to be realized in these sources .    using @xmath83 , here we investigate the plasma content in the cocoon . considering the components of energy ,",
    "@xmath4 is sum of the energy of the non - thermal leptons ( electron / positron ) and , if present , the energy of the unobservable particles such as thermal leptons and/or protons .",
    "the large excess energy of @xmath4 from @xmath5 is due to contributions from either of these components .",
    "let us consider the possibility of large contributions from the non - thermal leptons . in this case",
    "@xmath67 is given as @xmath84 where @xmath85 and @xmath86 are the energy density the nonthermal leptons and the minimum energy density ( @xmath87 ) , respectively .",
    "it is useful to express @xmath88 in terms of @xmath89 , where @xmath90 is the energy density the magnetic field since @xmath89 is widely investigated by a lot of authors ( e.g. , kataoka and stawarz ; croston et al .",
    "2005 ) . in the case of power - law",
    "distributed leptons , synchrotron luminosity ( @xmath91 ) is determined as @xmath92 .",
    "hence with @xmath93 and @xmath25 observed , @xmath94 and @xmath90 are not independent of each other , and @xmath95 can be written as @xmath96 . since recent studies shows that @xmath97 on average , the value of @xmath67 is expected to be up to @xmath98 at most .",
    "thus , non - thermal leptons are unlikely to be the main carrier of the energy . we conclude that significant amount of energy is carried by invisible components such as thermal leptons ( electron and positron ) and/or protons .",
