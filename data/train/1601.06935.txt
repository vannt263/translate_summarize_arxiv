    "it has been found that the so coupling can not only stabilize various topological defects , such as half - quantum vortex , skyrmion , composite soliton and chiral domain wall , contributing to the design and exploration of new functional materials @xcite , but also lead to entirely new quantum phases , such as magnetized phase and stripe phase @xcite , providing support for the study of novel quantum dynamical phase transitions @xcite and exotic supersolid phases  @xcite .",
    "all the intriguing features mentioned above are based on the characteristics that the so coupling ( either of the nist  @xcite , rashba  @xcite or weyl  @xcite types ) makes the internal states coupled to their momenta via the su(2 ) pauli matrices .",

    "<S> we show that double - quantum spin vortices , which are characterized by doubly quantized circulating spin currents and unmagnetized filled cores , can exist in the ground states of su(3 ) spin - orbit coupled bose gases . </S>",

    "<S> spin - orbit coupling induces a three - fold degeneracy to the magnetized ground state , while in the antiferromagnetic spin interaction case , the su(3 ) spin - orbit coupling breaks the ordinary phase rule of spinor bose gases , and allows the spontaneous emergence of double - quantum spin vortices . </S>",
    "<S> this exotic topological defect is in stark contrast to the singly quantized spin vortices observed in existing experiments , and can be readily observed by the current magnetization - sensitive phase - contrast imaging technique . </S>"
