    "compressed sensing demonstrates that sparse signals can be sampled through linear and non - adaptive measurements at a sub - nyquist rate , and still accurately recovered by means of non - linear iterative algorithms .",
    "the theory requires incoherence between the sensing and sparsity bases and a lot of work has thus been dedicated to design such sensing systems @xcite .    in the present work ,",
    "we concentrate on @xmath0-sparse digital signals @xmath1 in an orthonormal basis @xmath2 .",
    "the vector @xmath3 contains @xmath0 non - zero entries and its support is defined as @xmath4 .",
    "we denote @xmath5 the vector made of the @xmath0 non - zero entries of @xmath3 .",
    "this signal is probed by projection onto @xmath6 vectors of another orthonormal basis @xmath7 .",
    "the indices of the selected vectors are denoted @xmath8 and @xmath9 is the @xmath10 matrix made of the selected rows of @xmath11 , where the symbol @xmath12 stands for the conjugate transpose operation .",
    "the measurement vector @xmath13 thus reads as @xmath14 we also denote @xmath15 . finally , we aim at recovering @xmath3 by solving the @xmath16-minimization ( @xmath17 denotes the complex magnitude ) . ]",
    "problem @xmath18    in this setting , common strategies focus on uniform random selection of the indices @xmath19 . for signals sparse in the dirac basis , a uniform random selection of fourier basis vectors represents the best sampling strategy .",
    "indeed , the dirac and fourier basis are optimally incoherent .",
    "natural signals are however rather sparse in multi - scale bases , e.g. wavelet bases , not optimally incoherent with the fourier basis .",
    "many measurements are thus needed to reconstruct such signals accurately .",
    "this is for example the case in magnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) . to reduce the number of measurements ,",
    "the authors in @xcite rely on the fact that the energy of mri signals is essentially concentrated at low frequencies .",
    "they thus propose to select fourier basis vectors according to a variable density sampling profile selecting more low frequencies than high frequencies .",
    "this approach was shown to drastically enhance the quality of the reconstructed signals .",
    "this method is however essentially empirical and the reconstruction quality depends on the shape of the sampling profile used .",
    "let us also mention that a line of justification for vds was proposed in terms of the variable sparsity of the signals of interest as a function of scale in a wavelet sparsity basis @xcite .    in this letter , we study vds in the theoretical framework of compressed sensing . in section",
    "[ sec : variable density sampling ] , we describe the latest compressed sensing results for sparse signals probed in bounded orthonormal system , and explain how they encompass variable density sampling procedures . in section",
    "[ sec : vds optimization ] , we introduce a minimization problem for the coherence between the sparsity and sensing bases , whose solution provides an optimized sampling profile .",
    "this minimization problem is solved with the use of convex optimization algorithms .",
    "we also propose a further refinement of our technique when prior information is available on the signal support @xmath20 . in section",
    "[ sec : experiments ] , we illustrate the effectiveness of the method through numerical simulations .",
    "we also provide a comparison of the fourier vds profile in the presence of prior information and corresponding reconstruction qualities , with the state - of - the - art vds approaches used in mri .",
    "finally , we conclude in section [ sec : conclusion ] .",
    "in the setting presented in section [ sec : introduction ] , the compressed sensing theory demonstrates that if the sampling indices @xmath19 are chosen randomly and independently according to a discrete probability measure @xmath21 defined on @xmath22 , then a small number @xmath23 of random measurements are sufficient for an exact reconstruction of @xmath3 @xcite .",

    "assume that the sampling indices @xmath8 are selected randomly and independently according to a discrete probability measure @xmath21 defined on @xmath22 .",
    "let @xmath28 and define @xmath29 for a universal constant @xmath30 , if @xmath31 then @xmath3 is the unique minimizer of the @xmath16-minimization problem ( [ eq : bp ] ) with probability at least @xmath32 .    in the above theorem",
    ", the parameter @xmath33 stands for the mutual coherence between the measurement basis @xmath34 and the sparsity basis @xmath35 .",
    "this value depends on the probability measure @xmath21 and statisfies @xmath36 @xcite .",
    "the smaller the mutual coherence the smaller the required number of measurements for exact recovery .",
    "let us highlight that with the selection procedure described in theorem [ th : standard non - uniform recovery ] , the number of measurements is exactly @xmath6 but one measurement vector might be selected more than once .",
    "this characteristic is not always suitable in practical applications , such as mri , particularly in a vds configuration .",
    "indeed , a sensing basis vector @xmath37 , whose associated probability of selection @xmath38 is high , will be selected multiple times thus reducing the quantity of information probed . to avoid this phenomenon",
    ", we propose another selection process .    in the remainder , the sampling indices are selected according to an admissible sampling profile for @xmath6 measurements .",
    "a vector @xmath39 is an admissible sampling profile for a number @xmath6 of measurements if @xmath40 $ ] for all @xmath41 , and @xmath42 .",
    "the set of all admissible sampling profiles for a number @xmath6 of measurements is denoted @xmath43 .",
    "let @xmath44 be an admissible sampling profile , the sampling indices are selected by generating a sequence @xmath45 of independent bernouilli random variables taking value @xmath46 or @xmath47 and such that @xmath48 is equal to @xmath47 with probability @xmath49 for all @xmath50 .",

    "the computation of the one corresponding to @xmath89 essentially reduces to a projection onto an @xmath16-ball ( see appendix [ ap : proof prox ] ) .",
    "this projection , as well as the one onto the @xmath16-ball of radius @xmath6 , can be computed using the method presented in @xcite .",
    "note that for both subproblems , the computational complexity at each iteration is essentially driven by these projections for which the method in @xcite has a worst - case complexity of @xmath90 . for @xmath56 ,",
    "as in the forthcoming experiments , the overall algorithm converges in at most a few seconds .",
    "our procedure therefore easily scales to larger @xmath91 .",
    "when prior information is available on the signal support @xmath20 , we can refine our technique to find a sampling profile adapted to this support . indeed ,",
    "if the signal support @xmath20 is known in advance then theorem [ th : standard non - uniform recovery ] applies with the coherence @xmath92 we let the reader refer to appendix [ ap : proof coherence ] and equation ( [ eq : bound model ] ) for more details . an optimized sampling profile associated with the set @xmath20 can thus be obtained by substituting the diagonal matrix @xmath93 with entries @xmath94 on the diagonal , @xmath76 , for the matrix @xmath95 in problem ( [ eq : optimization problem ] ) .",

    "the effectiveness of the method is confirmed by numerical experiments . in particular , for signals sparse in a wavelet basis and probed in the fourier domain , simulations show that our technique leads to optimal recovery .",
    "indeed our technique gives similar probabilities of recovery as the spread spectrum method recently proved to be optimal .",
    "our results also provide a theoretical underpinning to vds procedures used in mri .",
    "the proof of this theorem follows exactly the method used to prove theorem @xmath115 in @xcite .",
