    "cosmic rays below the knee are generally believed to originate from shock acceleration at the supernova remnants ( snrs ) .",
    "although the process was proposed decades ago , it has not been easy to constrain the model from the observationally .",
    "recent advances on gamma ray observations provide us a possibility to study the acceleration and ensuing propagation processes in detail .",
    "in particular , the molecular clouds in the vicinity of a snr are good testbeds because of their high density",
    ". indeed , clouds illuminated by cosmic rays accelerated at a nearby snr can be bright gamma ray sources ( aharonian & atoyan 1996 ; fatuzzo et al .",
    "2006 ; gabici et al .",
    "2009 ) .",
    "gamma rays are produced through the decay of neutral pions generated in p - p collisions ( hadronic origin ) or through inverse compton interactions by energetic electrons with ambient photon target fields such as the cosmic microwave background radiation ( leptonic origin ) .",
    "it is still under debate whether the observed gamma ray emissions are of the hadronic or leptonic origin although the hadronic scenario is favored by many authors because of the evidence of strongly amplified magnetic fields near snrs ( see the review by blasi 2010 and references therein ) .",
    "we consider the gamma ray emission from massive molecular clouds near snrs , motivated , in particular , by the recently detected gamma ray emission from the snr w28 . as an old snr",
    ", the emission from w28 is perceived of purely hadronic origin since the life time of high energy electrons is short .",
    "the observed gamma emission from w28 indicates that the flux of cosmic rays is much enhanced there compared to the typical galactic values .",
    "this places a constraint on the cosmic ray diffusion .",
    "the enhancement of scattering corresponding to a reduction ( @xmath0 ) of the cr diffusion coefficient compared to galactic mean has been suggested by a few earlier models to match the observations ( fujita et al . 2009 , ohira et al .",
    "2011 , li & chen 2010 ) .",
    "no physical justification on how and why the scattering is boosted has been provided , however .",
    "in addition , earlier studies made a few serious assumptions including the bohm diffusion and a phenomenological power law evolution of the maximum energy accelerated at a certain epoch .",
    "we shall reinvestigate this problem by incorporating a proper physical description of the relevant processes , i.e. the shock acceleration in the presence of the streaming instability and nonlinear damping processes by background turbulence .",
    "the slower diffusion implies enhanced wave perturbations , which may arise from streaming instability ( see , e.g. , longair 2002 ) .",
    "earlier work has shown that streaming instability is limited by background turbulence ( yan & lazarian 2002 ; farmer & goldreich 2004 ; beresnyak & lazarian 2008 ) .",
    "this could be the determinative factor for the maximum energy attainable at the shock front as suggested by ptuskin & zirakashvili ( 2005 ) .",
    "however , the isotropic kolmogorov scaling for the turbulence , adopted by ptuskin & zirakashvili ( 2005 ) , is not applicable to mhd turbulence .",
    "moreover , if the enhanced scattering in the vicinity of snrs as indicated by the observations are due to the increased flux of cosmic rays there , we need to examine whether the flux of accelerated particles is sufficient to induce high enough growth rates of the streaming instability to overcome the nonlinear damping by background turbulence .    in this paper , we apply our present day understanding of the interaction between the streaming instability and the background turbulence to the modeling of the gamma ray emission from molecular clouds near snrs . we shall treat the problem in a self - consistent way by comparing the streaming level that is allowed by the preexisting turbulence and the required diffusion for the crs . in ",
    "2 we determine the maximum energy of accelerated particles at shocks , in  3 we calculate the spectrum of cosmic rays in the vicinity of snrs , in  4 we obtain the spectrum of gamma ray produced by the p - p interactions of the escaping cosmic rays in a nearby cloud and compare it with observations ,  5 , we check the self - consistency of our result by comparing the required the diffusion near snrs and the streaming level allowed in the presence of turbulence .",
    "the discussion and summary are provided in  6 and  7 . in the appendix we provide a list of notations used in the paper .",
    "diffusive shock acceleration of energetic cr particles relies on the crucial process of amplification of mhd turbulence so that particles can be trapped at the shock front long enough to be accelerated to the high energy observed .",
    "one of the most popular scenarios that has been adopted in the literature is the streaming instability generated by the accelerated particles .",
    "however , in the highly nonlinear regime the fluctuations of magnetic field arising from the streaming instability get large and the classical treatment of the streaming instability is not applicable .",
    "we circumvent the problem by proposing that the field amplification we consider does not arise from the streaming instability , but is achieved earlier through other processes , e.g. the interaction of the shock precursor with density perturbations preexisting in the interstellar medium ( beresnyak , jones , & lazarian 2009 ) . due to the resonant nature of the streaming instability ,",
    "the perturbations @xmath1 arising from it are more efficient in scattering crs compared to the large scale fluctuations produced by non - resonant mechanisms , e.g. the one in beresnyak et al .",
    "( 2009 ) . therefore in this paper",
    ", we limit our discussions to the regime of @xmath2 , where @xmath3 is the magnetic field that has already been amplified in the precursor region is therefore renormalized and can be much larger than the typical field in ism ( see , e.g. , diamond & malkov 2007 ) . ] .",
    "when particles reach the maximum energy at a certain time , they escape and the growth of the streaming instability stops .",
    "therefore we can obtain the maximum energy by considering the stationary state of the evolution .",
    "the steady state energy density of the turbulence @xmath4 at the shock is determined by    @xmath5    where @xmath6 is the shock speed , and the term on the l.h.s . represents the advection of turbulence by the shock flow .",
    "@xmath7 and @xmath8 are the alfven speed and the ionized gas number density of the precursor region , respectively .",
    "the plus sign represents the forward propagating alfven waves and the minus sign refers to the backward propagating alfven waves .",
    "the terms on the r.h.s . describes the wave amplification by the streaming instability and damping with @xmath9 as the corresponding growth and damping rates of the wave .",
    "the distribution of accelerated particles at strong shocks is @xmath10 .",
    "if taking into account the modification of the shock structure by the accelerated particles , the cr spectrum becomes harder .",
    "assume the distribution of crs at the shock is @xmath11 .",
    "the nonlinear growth was studied by ptuskin & zirakashvili ( 2005 ) .",
    "it was demonstrated by schlickeiser & shalchi ( 2008 ) that waves can grow or damp at the shock precursor depending on the the spatial boundary conditions .",
    "if assuming an equal amount of forward and backward waves at the shock front , the forward wave will be growing and the backward wave will be efficiently damped in the upstream region .",
    "we therefore neglect the backward moving wave mode and consider here only the growing forward moving mode , which is the one that effectively contributes to the particle scattering . the generalized growth rate of streaming instability then is    @xmath12d\\left|\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}\\right| ,   \\label{general}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the charge of the particle , c is the light speed , @xmath14 is the momentum of particles that resonate with the waves .",

    "@xmath16 is the diffusion coefficient of crs , @xmath17 and @xmath18 are the velocity and larmor radius of the crs",
    ". the distribution function of crs is    @xmath19    where @xmath20 measures the ratio of cr pressure at the shock and the upstream momentum flux entering the shock front , @xmath21 is the proton rest mass , and @xmath22 is the maximum momentum accelerated at the shock front .",
    "@xmath23 is the heaviside step function .    in the planar shock approximation ,",
    "the distribution of accelerated particles is    @xmath24    at the upstream of the shock ( @xmath25 ) and @xmath26 at the downstream .",
    "insert eqs.([crdiff ] , [ f0],[f1 ] ) into eq.([general ] ) , one gets the following growth rate of the upstream forward moving wave at x=0 , @xmath27 where @xmath28 , @xmath29 .",
    "the linear damping is negligible since the medium should be highly ionized . in fully ionized gas",
    ", there is nonlinear landau damping , which , however , is suppressed due to the reduction of particles mean free path in the turbulent medium ( see yan & lararian 2011 ; brunetti & lazarian 2011 ) ; we therefore neglect this process here .",
    "background turbulence itself can cause nonlinear damping to the waves ( yan & lazarian 2002 ) . unlike hydrodynamical turbulence , mhd turbulence is anisotropic with eddies elongated along the magnetic field . the anisotropy increases with the decrease of the scale ( goldreich & sridhar 1995 ) .",
    "at the scales of the larmor radii @xmath30 of the cosmic rays , which are also the wavelengths @xmath31 of the waves induced by the streaming instability , the scale disparity becomes very large with @xmath32 , where we use @xmath33 to distinguish the parallel component of the turbulence wave packet wavenumber @xmath33 from the parallel wavenumber of the growing wave @xmath34 . in mhd turbulence ,",
    "wave packet cascades after it travels a distance of @xmath35 . on the other hand",
    ", the instability grows fastest for the most parallel wave ( @xmath36 ) allowed in a turbulence medium with their wave numbers satisfying @xmath37 .",
    "because of the scale disparity , @xmath38 , the nonlinear damping rate in mhd turbulence is less than the wave frequency @xmath39 , and it is given by ( farmer & goldreich 2004 ; yan & lazarian 2004 ; beresnyak & lazarian 2008 )    @xmath40    where l is the injection scale of background turbulence , and the @xmath41 is set by the resonance condition @xmath42 . inserting eqs.([growth],[damping ] ) into eq.([wave ] ) and adopting @xmath43 in the case of efficient wave amplification , one gets    @xmath44    there are various models for the diffusive shock acceleration .",
    "we consider here the escape - limited acceleration . in this model ,",
    "particles are confined in the region near the shock where turbulence is generated .",
    "once they propagate far upstream at a distance @xmath45 from the shock front , where the self - generated turbulence by crs fades away , the particles escape and the acceleration ceases .",
    "the characteristic length that particles penetrate into the upstream is @xmath46 .",
    "the maximum momentum is reached when @xmath47 .",
    "assuming @xmath48 , then the maximum momentum of particles accelerated during the sedov phase is determined by the condition    @xmath49    where @xmath50 is a numerical factor , see table 2 . from equations ( [ crdiff],[dshock ] ) , we get @xmath51    insert eq.([gmax ] ) into eq.([wave2 ] ) , we get for @xmath52 here . ]",

    "@xmath70 in our paper was obtained by considering the balance of the wave growth from the streaming instability , the advection by the shock flow as well as wave damping by the background turbulence .",
    "the latter is due to the nonlinear interaction between the wave and the turbulence , and has not been properly accounted for .",
    "ptuskin & zirakashvili ( 2005 ) considered a similar process , but assumed isotropy of the mhd turbulence which is not valid .",
