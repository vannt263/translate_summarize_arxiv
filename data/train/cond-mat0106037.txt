    "the existence of a gap in one - dimensional , integer - spin , heisenberg antiferromagnets was first predicted by haldane @xcite .",
    "he found that such spin chains can be mapped onto a gapped field theory in the large - spin , continuum limit .",
    "a variety of checks imply that this behavior persists down to spin @xmath0 .",
    "a spin-@xmath1 chain with a specific @xmath2 coupling has been rigorously shown to exhibit a spin gap @xcite . while at a differing value of the @xmath2 coupling , the spin chain is gapless @xcite , this critical point is believed to be unstable in the two - parameter space of couplings .",
    "gapless behavior thus only arises as a product of fine - tuning .",
    "numerous numerical studies carried out on spin-@xmath1 chains observe a gap @xcite .",
    "experimentally , inelastic neutron scattering studies on a number of quasi - one - dimensional spin-@xmath1-chain materials are consistent with a finite spin gap @xcite .",
    "the physics underlying the gap is particularly robust : related systems such as two - leg spin-1/2 or hubbard ladders also exhibit a gap to spin excitations @xcite . roughly speaking ,",
    "integer - spin composites form across the rungs of the ladder making it into an effective integer - spin chain .",
    "both the ability to fabricate these materials and their relationship to high @xmath3 cuprate superconductors have made them the focus of intense theoretical and experimental study @xcite .",
    "the centrality of the gap is no less when these materials are subjected to an applied zeeman field , @xmath4 . in a field exceeding some critical value , @xmath5 ,",
    "the excitation spectrum of integer - spin chains changes dramatically and the gap vanishes @xcite . at @xmath6",
    "the ground state is a singlet .",
    "the elementary excitations above the ground state are three massive spin - one bosonic magnon modes .",
    "in contrast , when @xmath4 exceeds @xmath7 , the gap of one of the magnons closes and the ground state of the spin chain begins to fill in with gapless excitations . if interactions between the gapless magnons were completely absent , the excitations would collapse into a condensate of free bosons . on the other hand",
    "if interactions were perfectly repulsive at any energy scale , the bosons could be thought to possess a hard core and so form a gas of free fermions with some fermi surface .",
    "but in fact the interactions are expected to lie midway between these extremes and what one ends up with is equivalent to an interacting sea of fermions .",
    "this of course is nothing more than a luttinger liquid .",
    "the purpose of this article is to study its properties .",
    "the field theory describing the continuum limit of integer - spin chains is the @xmath8 non - linear sigma model ( nlsm ) without topological term @xcite .",
    "the @xmath8 nlsm also describes half - integer - spin chains but in this case the topological term is present with coupling @xmath9 .",
    "the presence of the topological term leads to gapless behavior .",
    "indeed at low energies the @xmath8 nlsm with @xmath9 flows to the critical theory , @xmath10 ( for a review see @xcite ) .    unlike its ancestral theory",
    ", the heisenberg spin-@xmath1 chain , the @xmath8 sigma model has the virtue of being integrable @xcite .",
    "while aspects of the physics of integer - spin chains have been studied using the integrability of the @xmath8 nlsm@xcite , spin chains remain incompletely understood . while thermodynamic properties of an integrable model are generically accessible , correlation functions are not",
    ". there do exist a variety of techniques to compute correlators . at zero temperature , truncated ` form - factor '",
    "computations are able to access exact information of the low - energy properties of the spectral functions @xcite .",
    "these techniques have recently been extended to compute exact _ low temperature _ expansions of these same quantities @xcite .",
    "there also exists an elegant semi - classical approach @xcite predicated upon combining ultra - low - energy information from the quantum theory with older approaches of computing correlators in classical systems @xcite .",
    "however , all of these techniques require the energy scales in the problem ( in particular , the temperature , @xmath11 , and the applied field , @xmath4 ) to be much smaller than the gap , @xmath12 .",
    "fortuitously there exists an alternate approach which allows the computation of correlation functions when @xmath13 .",
    "the control over the thermodynamic properties of the model that integrability affords allows the computation of the luttinger parameter .",
    "while the luttinger parameter characterizes the strength of the interactions between excitations , it is a far more central quantity in that it provides a near complete description of the low - energy structure of the theory .",
    "together with the knowledge of the fermi velocity , a quantity also easily accessible with integrability , a host of information can be determined , including the computation of specific correlators and their scaling exponents .",
    "such techniques have been used to study the sine - gordon model in the presence of a chemical potential exceeding the gap ( i.e.  the mass of the sine - gordon solitons ) @xcite .",
    "similarly the low - energy structure of doped generic hubbard ladders / armchair carbon nanotubes has been studied in @xcite utilizing this formalism .",
    "the particular derivation of the luttinger parameter in this paper is based upon the treatment in @xcite .    the ability to compute the luttinger parameter together with the fermi velocity",
    "is predicated upon some generic properties of integrable models .",
    "most importantly , the exact eigenfunctions of the model s fully interacting hamiltonian are known . with this knowledge",
    "comes a well - defined notion of ` particles ' or elementary excitations in the system .",
    "ultimately this feature is a consequence of the infinite number of conservation laws possessed by the integrable model . in particular ,",
    "particle number is conserved in any collision and multi - particle @xmath14 matrix elements factorize into products of two - particles ones .",
    "an integrable model is a superior version of a fermi liquid : a particle s lifetime is infinite regardless of distance from the fermi surface .    in order to appreciate these features of the @xmath8 nlsm",
    ", we provide an overview of the model .",
    "the model is described by the action , @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a bosonic vector field constrained to live on the unit sphere , @xmath17 .",
    "this action is arrived at from the hamiltonian of the spin chain , @xmath18 in the continuum , large-@xmath19 , limit , the spin operator , @xmath20 , is related to the field , @xmath21 , via @xmath22 @xmath23 is the sub - lattice or nel order parameter while @xmath24 describes the uniform ( i.e. wavevector @xmath25 ) magnetization .",
    "* m * is related to @xmath21 via @xmath26 and so is given in terms of the momentum conjugate to * n*.    the triplet of bosons which form the low - energy excitations of the @xmath8 nlsm have a relativistic dispersion relation given by @xmath27 here @xmath12 is the energy gap or mass of the bosons and is related to the bare coupling , @xmath28 , via @xmath29 .",
    "we have set the bare spin - wave velocity , @xmath30 ( the speed of light in this relativistic system ) to be 1 .",
    "the dispersion relation of all three bosons is identical as the model has a global o(3 ) symmetry .",
    "we stress that this relativistic invariance is a natural feature of the low energy structure of the spin chain .",
    "our approach to the luttinger liquid phase of the heisenberg spin-1 chain shares some similarities with others taken in the literature .",
    "the nlsm has been used previously to study the field - induced gapless phase of spin-1 chains , albeit in the context of large-@xmath31 techniques @xcite , where the @xmath8 nlsm is replaced with its @xmath32 counterpart .",
    "( parenthetically , we point out that the large n approximation of the @xmath8 nlsm have been criticized by @xcite . in this work",
    "the authors note that the ultra low energy limit of the scattering in the @xmath8 nlsm differs from that predicted by a large n expansion of the exact @xmath32 s - matrix . )    beyond large-@xmath31 , the luttinger liquid phase of the spin-1 chain has also been studied in the guise of analyzing spin-1/2 ladders .",
    "bosonization techniques have been used to study the ladder system in a regime where the legs of the ladders are weakly coupled@xcite . in the opposite limit , in a regime where there are strong _ antiferromagnetic _ correlations across the ladder s rungs , the gapless luttinger",
    "liquid behaviour has been explored through mapping the system onto an effective xxz spin-1/2 chain @xcite . in this latter case",
    ", the underlying integrability of the xxz spin chain can be brought to bear upon the problem @xcite . given the simplicity of the map onto the spin-1/2 chain ,",
    "we adapt the map to the case where there are _ ferromagnetic _ interactions across the rungs of the ladder ( appropriate for describing a spin-1 chain ) .",
    "our primary purpose in doing so is to come up with a more precise identification between the relevant fields in the theory and the bosonic degrees of freedom of the luttinger liquid .",
    "although we could exploit the integrability of the spin-1/2 chain to compute the luttinger parameter , we do not do so .",
    "given that the map to the effective spin-1/2 chain is done through a perturbative expansion where the importance of the higher order terms in the series is uncertain , we view extracting the luttinger parameter directly from the @xmath8 nlsm as more reliable .",
    "haldane gap spin chains in a magnetic field have also been studied through a mapping onto an interacting , spinless bose gas @xcite .",
    "this map provides a reliable description of the spin chain at small magnetizations . at small magnetizations , the low density of excitations forming the ground state",
    "interact only weakly .",
    "the scaling exponents and thermodynamic properties of the system are then independent of the exact nature of these interactions . although not done by the authors of @xcite , the integrability of the bose gas , like the integrability of the @xmath8 nlsm , could be used to determine the various properties of the luttinger liquid phase .",
    "however beyond the low magnetization regime , the results would differ .",
    "it is interesting to note , however , that by fine tuning the strength of the interactions of the bose gas , the analysis of the @xmath8 nlsm , in particular the computation of the luttinger parameter , can be reproduced in large degree .",
    "we comment upon this further in section 3 .    in this article",
    "we take the hamiltonian of the spin chain to be in its minimal heisenberg form and so ignore ( for the most part ) the affects of anisotropies upon the physics .",
    "these can take ( at least ) two forms .",
    "easy - axis anisotropies , @xmath33 of varying strengths are often found in spin-@xmath1 chain materials .",
    "additionally , actual spin chain materials never take the form of an isolated chain .",
    "rather the chains exist in three dimensional arrays with weak but non - zero interchain couplings , @xmath34 .",
    "thus the chains are at best quasi - one - dimensional . with a finite @xmath34 , there will be some correspondingly finite nel temperature , @xmath35 .",
    "below @xmath35 the physics will be dramatically different than described in this article .",
    "@xmath36 was the first material for which evidence of a haldane gap was found @xcite .",
    "this material suffers from the second aforementioned anisotropy with a relatively large interchain coupling , @xmath37 .",
    "consequently nel order was observed to set in at @xmath38 .",
    "a more promising material for the observation of a haldane gap was found in @xmath39 ( nenp ) . for nenp ,",
    "the ratio @xmath40 is sufficiently small that 3d nel order has not been observed down to temperatures @xmath41@xcite .",
    "however this material is characterized by a large easy - axis anisotropy , @xmath42 ( @xmath43 ) . related materials @xmath44 ( ndmap ) and @xmath45 ( ndmaz ) share similar easy - axis anisotropies . in terms of our analysis , these latter compounds share the additional unwanted feature of field - induced antiferromagnetism @xcite . the luttinger liquid that results from magnetic fields large enough to extinguish the haldane gap leads to quasi - long range antiferromagnetic correlations . with a small finite @xmath34",
    ", these quasi - long range correlations are promoted to full fledged long range order .",
    "the corresponding nel temperature increases with applied magnetic fields . in a mean field framework",
    ", we compute this ordering temperature in section 4 .",
    "thus at fixed temperature we expect only a finite window in the applied magnetic field in which the luttinger liquid behavior will persist .",
    "perhaps the material best suited to the analysis presented in this paper is @xmath46 .",
    "it has an extremely small interchain coupling , @xmath47 and a similarly small easy axis anisotropy , @xmath48 .",
    "however it possesses a comparatively large gap , @xmath49 . as such ,",
    "high field measurements @xmath50 have yet to be done on this material ( and are unlikely to be done soon ) , opposite to the case of nenp @xcite , with a much smaller average gap , @xmath51 .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section 2",
    "we develop a landau - ginzburg description of the low - energy effective theory of the integer - spin chain in a magnetic field exceeding the spin gap .",
    "this effective theory reduces to a luttinger liquid and so has two controlling parameters : the luttinger parameter , @xmath52 , and the fermi velocity , @xmath53 . in section 3 we show how these parameters can be determined as a function of the applied field , @xmath4 , through consistency with the @xmath8 nlsm .    with this description of the low - energy theory in hand",
    ", we analyze the behavior of a number of correlators in section 4 . using a kubo formula together with our knowledge of the current - current correlators , we compute the spin conductance and the static susceptibility . with this latter quantity",
    "we have thus come full circle .",
    "we computed @xmath52 and @xmath53 based upon thermodynamic considerations and then in turn computed correlators . from these same correlators",
    "we then ( re)compute ( consistently ) thermodynamic quantities .",
    "we also study the staggered spin - spin correlators , quantities which would be probed both in inelastic neutron scattering experiments near wavevector @xmath54 and nmr relaxation rate measurements .",
    "while we have already raised the issue of the effects of interchain couplings upon the stability of the luttinger liquid phase , we also consider in section 4 the robustness of this phase to finite temperature .",
    "although our derivation of the effective low - energy theory is done at zero temperature , the conformal / scale invariant nature of the theory allows us to easily determine quantities at @xmath55 . to explore",
    "how large the temperature relative to the gap may become before the luttinger picture breaks down , we study the susceptibility at finite @xmath11 and @xmath4 . we do so using a more sophisticated description of the system , the exact equations ( good for arbitrary @xmath11 and @xmath4 ) giving the system s free energy .",
    "in this section we describe the emergent luttinger liquid behavior of a spin chain arising in magnetic fields larger than the gap and temperatures satisfying @xmath57 .",
    "following @xcite , we provide a corresponding landau - ginzburg description .",
    "although we work with an effective theory , we will be able to compute the various phenomenological parameters appearing in it by insisting on consistency with the @xmath8 nlsm .",
    "this will form the topic of section 3 .",
    "the landau - ginzburg description is an approximate field theory of the magnons and their interactions .",
    "we represent the magnon field as @xmath58 .",
    "it is a vector under the @xmath8 symmetry akin to original field @xmath59 and shares all of @xmath59 s original discrete symmetries .",
    "however @xmath58 is not constrained to live on the unit sphere .",
    "the magnons have a gap and a relativistic dispersion relation .",
    "the simplest effective hamiltonian with these characteristics is @xcite , @xmath60 where @xmath61 is the momenta conjugate to @xmath58 .",
    "we have added a @xmath62 term to ensure overall stability .",
    "the corresponding lagrangian ( with @xmath4 in the @xmath63 direction ) is @xmath64 the last three terms form the effective potential for the model .    when @xmath65 , the minimum of the landau - ginzburg potential occurs for @xmath66 .",
    "but when @xmath56 the minima of the potential now occur for field configurations of the form @xmath67 as we are interested in the low - energy behavior of the theory , we focus upon the low - energy fluctuations about these field configurations . introducing",
    "the new fields @xmath68 and @xmath69 via @xmath70 with @xmath71 , the effective lagrangian can be rewritten ( to quadratic order in the fields ) @xmath72 the low - energy physics in @xmath73 is governed solely by the field @xmath69 .",
    "the @xmath68 and @xmath74 modes are massive and may be integrated out .",
    "doing so results in a lagrangian of the form @xmath75 the bosonic form of the luttinger model . here",
    "@xmath52 and @xmath53 are the effective luttinger parameter and fermi velocity .",
    "these parameters can be related to the various parameters appearing in the original landau - ginzburg hamiltonian .",
    "however this can be done only at the mean - field level ; quantum fluctuations strongly renormalize their values .",
    "the approach we thus take is to access @xmath52 and @xmath53 directly from the integrability of the @xmath8 nlsm .",
    "this , as has been indicated , is done in section 3 .    to complete this section we identify the fields of the @xmath8 nlsm in terms of @xmath69 .",
    "we can factorize the boson , @xmath69 , into right and left moving pieces each describing the excitations at the two fermi points , @xmath76 .",
    "the ( euclidean ) propagators of @xmath77 are given in terms of @xmath52 .",
    "we have @xmath78 where @xmath79 .",
    "the fields , @xmath80 , creating @xmath81 excitations are given in terms of the boson , @xmath69 , by @xmath82 and so are governed by the propagator of the form @xmath83 we thus understand the spectral functions of low - energy excitations in terms of @xmath52 when @xmath84",
    ". moreover we can express the z - component of the magnetization operators in terms of the @xmath85 boson currents ( in euclidean space ) .",
    "fluctuations in the magnetization density are given by @xmath86 while the corresponding spin current , @xmath87 , equals @xmath88 current - current correlators then can be deduced from @xmath89 an immediate consequence of ( [ exiii ] ) .",
    "the above identification of the fields is minimal in nature .",
    "it is based upon both the landau - ginsburg analysis together with the simplest association of the fields in the nlsm with those of the luttinger liquid ( [ exii ] ) .",
    "however it misses subleading terms . to identify such terms directly from the landau - ginsburg analysis",
    "would seem difficult . to circumvent this difficulty",
    ", we analyze a spin-1/2 ladder system . with ferromagnetic interactions across an individual rung of the ladder",
    "we obtain an effective spin 1 . and with antiferromagnetic interactions along the length of the ladder , we obtain an effective antiferromagnetic heisenberg spin-1 chain . in a magnetic field , the ladder system can be reduced to an equivalent spin-1/2 chain .",
    "bosonizing such a chain in the standard fashion yields a luttinger liquid , precisely as in ( [ exii ] ) . proceeding in this fashion offers us the advantage that it allows a more complete identification of the fields , including subleading terms .",
    "we so find @xmath90 here @xmath91 is the boson dual to that of @xmath69 and may be written as @xmath92 while @xmath93 and @xmath94 are some numerical constants .",
    "we see that the leading terms agree with that of the landau - ginsburg analysis .",
    "the subleading terms are interesting in that they depend upon the magnetization , @xmath95 , of the system , and so lead to incommensurate behaviour .",
    "this incommensurate behaviour has been argued to occur @xcite in the context of spin-1/2 ladders with ferromagnetic rungs .",
    "the map from spin-1/2 ladders to effective spin-1/2 chains has been studied extensively .",
    "two general approaches have been employed . in the case where the spin-1/2 ladder is strongly",
    "antiferromagnetically coupled across the rung ( we are however interested in ferromagnetic couplings ) , a straightforward map takes the ladder in a magnetic field to a spin-1/2 chain @xcite . in the case",
    "where the spin-1/2 ladder is weakly coupled across the rungs ( either ferromagnetically or antiferromagnetically ) more detailed studies have been carried out , using successive bosonizations / fermionizations @xcite . due to the simplicity of the former ,",
    "we adapt this method to ferromagnetic rung couplings , as discussed in appendix c.    the need to adapt the map is predicated upon two pieces of physics .",
    "the luttinger parameter of the magnetically induced gapless phase of spin-1/2 ladders with ferromagnetic / antiferromagnetic rungs satisfies @xmath96 .",
    "however a nave application of the map yields @xmath97 regardless of the type of rung coupling .",
    "additionally , the map as it stands does not take into account the different types of gapless behaviour .",
    "the perpendicular susceptibility of ladders with antiferromagnetic rungs , for example , sees power law like decay at @xmath98 and exponential decay at @xmath99 .",
    "but the situation is reversed for ladders with ferromagnetic rungs .",
    "in this section we present exact results for the @xmath13 phase of the @xmath8 nlsm .",
    "they confirm the luttinger behavior implied by the landau - ginzburg description discussed in the last section .",
    "in particular we show how to extract the phenomenological parameters , @xmath52 and @xmath53 , appearing in this description from the integrability of the @xmath8 nlsm .",
    "we begin by describing how the ground state of the @xmath8 nlsm is altered in the presence of a magnetic field . neglecting interactions , the energy of an excitation with bare energy , @xmath100 , in a finite magnetic field , @xmath4 , along the @xmath63 axis",
    "is @xmath101 this leads to a splitting of the spin-1 triplet of magnons . in a mean - field ` semi - conductor ' picture , this splitting is sketched in figure 1 . as the magnetic field , @xmath4 , is increased beyond the critical value of @xmath102 , the ground state of the spin chain dramatically changes .",
    "the ground state now begins to fill in with a finite density of magnons ( and so is akin to a doped semiconductor ) .",
    "if the @xmath81 magnons were non - interacting , they would condense in the lowest possible energy level .",
    "but the magnons interact repulsively , and so they fill the ground state as if they were fermions or hard - core bosons .",
    "the technical manifestation of this behavior is the minus sign in the @xmath14-matrix at zero momentum transfer ( @xmath103 in ( [ exx ] ) ) . with @xmath4",
    "larger than @xmath12 , the energy of an excitation is potentially negative and excitations carrying @xmath104 appear in the ground state .",
    "we illustrate this in figure 1 schematically by plotting the dispersion relations for the three types of excitations in the system : @xmath105 .",
    "= 5.0 in    the ground state of the system for @xmath13 is therefore a sea of magnons .",
    "the low - energy spin excitations consist of slight deformations of the filled sea in the @xmath104 band .",
    "these low - lying excitations can be of arbitrarily small energy and so are gapless .",
    "if we linearize such excitations above the fermi energy of this band , we obtain a luttinger liquid characterized by a luttinger parameter , @xmath52 , and a fermi velocity , @xmath53 .    to describe the ground state exactly we need to take into account interactions of the particles .",
    "these interactions are parameterized by their scattering .",
    "as the @xmath8 sigma model is integrable , the scattering matrix is known exactly .",
    "exploiting the theory s relativistic invariance , we can parameterize a particle s energy and momentum in terms of its rapidity @xmath106 , defined as @xmath107 in this parameterization , lorentz boosts send @xmath108 .",
    "lorentz invariant quantities like @xmath14 matrix elements therefore depend only on differences of rapidities .",
    "the @xmath14 matrix for scattering the two - particle state @xmath109 ( @xmath110 ) into the final state @xmath111 is @xcite @xmath112 where @xmath113 and @xmath114 since the ground state is filled with solely @xmath104 particles , we need the @xmath14 matrix element , @xmath115 , for scattering of two such particles : @xmath116 this is found from the change of basis , @xmath117 , where here @xmath118 is an operator creating an excitation carrying quantum number @xmath119 .",
    "knowing @xmath14 allows us to determine the density of states per unit length , @xmath120 , of the sea of particles at @xmath13 .",
    "the derivation is standard and can be found for the case at hand in @xcite . for completeness",
    "we repeat these arguments in appendix a. at zero temperature , the repulsive nature of the particles leads them to fill the sea up to some fermi momentum , so that the density satisfies @xmath121 for @xmath122 . for @xmath123 , we have @xmath124 where @xmath125 the first term on the right - hand - side of ( [ exxii ] ) is the free term , while the kernel , @xmath126 , appearing in the second term measures the strength of the interactions . as @xmath127 ,",
    "the interactions lead to a density of states greater than the bare value of @xmath128 associated with purely free fermions .",
    "the strength of the magnetic field , @xmath4 , determines the fermi rapidity , @xmath129 . to find it , it is first convenient to introduce the dressed energy , @xmath130 , of the magnons .",

    "it is given by @xmath131 at zero temperature , the particles fill all allowed levels up to @xmath132 . therefore the fermi rapidity is determined by solving ( [ exxiv ] ) subject to the boundary condition , @xmath133 thus for @xmath123 , @xmath134 .",

    "the key is to study this system in terms of its gapless quasi - particle excitations present when @xmath56 .",
    "these excitations are not the original magnons , but rather the excitations above the magnon sea .",
    "since they are gapless , they move either to the right or left at the fermi velocity .",

    "we first note that @xmath141 here @xmath142 is the dressed momentum of the excitations and is given by an equation similar to the one governing the energy : @xmath143 where @xmath144 is the unrenormalized scattering phase . by comparing ( [ exxviii ] ) with ( [ exxii ] )",
    "we see @xmath145 .",
    "the fermi velocity is then given by @xmath146 while the integral equations ( [ exxii ] and [ exxiv ] ) can not be solved in closed form , it is easy to solve numerically .",

    "the relationship of @xmath52 and @xmath147 is that the low - energy excitations near @xmath132 are free - fermionic .",

    "<S> we study the behavior of heisenberg , antiferromagnetic , integer - spin chains in the presence of a magnetic field exceeding the attendant spin gap . for temperatures much smaller than the gap </S>",
    "<S> , the spin chains exhibit luttinger liquid behavior . </S>",
    "<S> we compute exactly both the corresponding luttinger parameter and the fermi velocity as a function of magnetic field . </S>",
    "<S> this enables the computation of a number of correlators from which we derive the spin conductance , the expected form of the dynamic structure factor relevant to inelastic neutron scattering experiments , and nmr relaxation rates . </S>",
    "<S> we also comment upon the robustness of the magnetically induced gapless phase both to finite temperature and finite couplings between neighbouring chains . </S>"
