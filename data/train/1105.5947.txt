    "<S> robust edge states and non - abelian excitations are the trademark of topological states of matter , with promising applications such as `` topologically protected '' quantum memory and computing . while so far topological phases have been exclusively discussed in a hamiltonian context , we show that such phases and the associated topological protection and phenomena also emerge in open quantum systems with engineered dissipation . </S>",
    "<S> the specific system studied here is a quantum wire of spinless atomic fermions in an optical lattice coupled to a bath . </S>",
    "<S> the key feature of the dissipative dynamics described by a lindblad master equation is the existence of _ majorana edge modes _ , representing a non - local decoherence free subspace . </S>",
    "<S> the isolation of the edge states is enforced by a dissipative gap in the p - wave paired bulk of the wire . </S>",
    "<S> we describe dissipative non - abelian braiding operations within the majorana subspace , and we illustrate the insensitivity to imperfections . </S>",
    "<S> topological protection is granted by a nontrivial winding number of the system density matrix .    </S>",
    "<S> topological properties can protect quantum systems from microscopic details and imperfections . in condensed matter physics </S>",
    "<S> this is illustrated by the seminal examples of the quantum hall effect and the recently discovered topological insulators @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the ground state of the hamiltonian of such systems is characterized by nonzero values of topological invariants which imply the existence of robust edge states in interfaces to topologically trivial phases . due to their topological origin , these modes are immune against a wide class of perturbations .    </S>",
    "<S> the conceptually simplest example illustrating these phenomena is kitaev s quantum wire representing a topological superconducting state supporting majorana fermions as edge states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the pair of majorana edge modes represents a nonlocal fermion which is a promising building block to encode topological qubits @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> similar to the majorana excitations near vortices of a @xmath0 superconductor @xcite , they show nonabelian exchange statistics when braided in 1d wire networks @xcite .    </S>",
    "<S> remarkably , the above described topological features and phenomena not only occur as properties of hamiltonians , but appear also in driven dissipative quantum systems . </S>",
    "<S> below we will develop such a topological program for a dissipative many - body system parallel to the hamiltonian case . </S>",
    "<S> we will do this for a dissipative version of kitaev s quantum wire . </S>",
    "<S> this represents the simplest instance exhibiting the key features such as dissipation induced majorana edge modes , decoupled from the dynamically created p - wave superfluid bulk by a dissipative gap . </S>",
    "<S> the dissipation induced topological order is generated in stationary states far away from thermodynamic equilibrium which are not necessarily pure , i.e. described in terms of a wave function only , and is reached exponentially fast from arbitrary initial states . </S>",
    "<S> this is in marked contrast to recent ideas of topological order in hamiltonian systems under non - equilibrium periodic driving conditions @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> such a system can be realized with cold atoms in optical lattices , where the generation of topological order in the more conventional hamiltonian settings has been proposed recently in a variety of settings @xcite . </S>"
