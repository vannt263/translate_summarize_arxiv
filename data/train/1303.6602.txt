    "the rich chaotic dynamics exhibited by sinusoidally driven nonlinear oscillators is ubiquitous to a large number of systems such as turbulence in fluid systems @xcite , chemical oscillators @xcite , and cardiac tissues @xcite .",
    "manipulated properties of chaos , such as control of chaos @xcite realized in driven nonlinear oscillators , are also reported in several disciplines , for instance , control of output of laser system @xcite , enhanced performance of permanent magnet synchronous motor @xcite , and control of cardiac arrhythmias @xcite .",
    "natural to multistate weakly driven oscillators in the presence of ubiquitous noise is the stochastic resonance @xcite , another generic noise induced cooperative phenomenon that enhances the signal to noise ratio .",
    "this phenomenon is also realized in several disciplines ranging from physics ( e.g. , superconducting quantum interference device magnetometers , optical and electronic devises ) @xcite to biology @xcite .",
    "however , _",
    "it is rare to find such a broad spectrum of dynamical features in a single system_. surprisingly , physical realization of several of these features was reported by vohra _",
    "_ @xcite . in their study of strain bifurcations in magnetostrictive ribbons subjected to the combined influence of sinusoidal ( ac ) and",
    "dc magnetic fields , the authors reported an extraordinarily large number of dynamical features such as ( a ) quasiperioidic ( qp ) route to chaos when the amplitude of the ac magnetic field @xmath0 was increased in the presence of a dc magnetic field @xmath1 , ( b ) period doubling ( pd ) route to chaos when @xmath1 was increased and the ac field was kept fixed @xcite , ( c ) a suppression and shift of period doubling bifurcation point @xcite and induced subcritical bifurcation under small - amplitude near - resonant conditions @xcite , ( d ) control of chaos , specifically , suppressed and induced chaos with the application of a near - resonant perturbation to one of the subharmonics @xcite , and ( e ) stochastic resonance @xcite .",
    "however , modeling such a rich dynamics exhibited by a _",
    "single _ system in terms of the relevant strain and magnetic order parameters has remained a challenge .",
    "vohra _ et  al .",
    "_ emphasize that @xmath2 effect @xcite , i.e. , the reversible change in the young s modulus with applied magnetic field , is not responsible for the reported dynamics as the samples used are unannealed ribbons where the @xmath2 effect is insignificant , unlike the earlier reported pd and qp routes to chaos in the annealed metallic glass samples @xcite .",
    "some of these features have been explained using appropriate normal forms @xcite by appealing to the universal nature of the bifurcation phenomenon .",
    "our purpose is to develop a model in terms of magnetic and strain order parameters . in this paper",
    "we focus on three different experimentally observed dynamical features and show that the model predicts ( i ) the period doubling and ( ii ) quasiperiodic routes to chaos and ( iii ) induced and suppressed chaos in the presence of small - amplitude near - resonant perturbation .",
    "the general nature of these equations suggest much richer dynamics in ferromagnetic martensite samples that posses even stronger elastic and magnetic nonlinearities @xcite and also in magnetoelectric materials @xcite . the model also explains some old results on internal friction studies of martensites @xcite .",
    "experiments were performed using a sinusoidal magnetic field @xmath0 of frequency @xmath3 in the presence of a dc magnetic field @xmath1 .",
    "our starting point is to write down the relevant free energies . in general ,",
    "elastic free energy is a function of all components of the strain tensor .",
    "however , considering the fact that the samples are thin long ribbons ( @xmath4 cm long ) fixed at one end with the displacement or strain being monitored at the other end , it would be adequate to use a single strain order parameter @xmath5 .",
    "further , we work in one dimension and use dimensionless order parameters .",
    "we construct a minimal one - dimensional model with the strain order parameter @xmath5 and magnetic order parameter @xmath6 . in our model",
    "the weak magnetic nonlinearity is taken to drive the highly nonlinear elastic degrees of freedom @xcite .",
    "then the total free energy has three contributions , namely , the strain free energy , magnetic free energy , and magneto - elastic free energy .",
    "thus the total free energy is @xmath7 .    in one dimension",
    "the elastic free energy is given by @xmath8 where the strain variable is @xmath9 , @xmath10 is the landau free energy density , and the second term is the gradient free energy . guided by the normal forms used @xcite , we use a sixth - order polynomial for the elastic free energy @xmath11 . here",
    "@xmath12 is a positive constant , but @xmath13 can take on positive or negative values . to simplify further",
    ", we use @xmath14 .",
    "the minima of the free energy are located at @xmath15 with @xmath16^{1/2}$ ] .",
    "the parameters @xmath12 ( of the order of unity ) and @xmath13 are sufficient to control the minima .",
    "when @xmath17 , @xmath18 is the true minima identified with the high - temperature phase . at @xmath19 , we have a first order transition with the free energy vanishing at @xmath20 and @xmath18 . for @xmath13",
    "negative , @xmath18 state is unstable .",
    "this behavior can be parameterized by using @xmath21 where @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the first- and second order transition temperatures , respectively .",

    "the nature of magneto - elastic free energy is not known , particularly since the ribbon is a metallic glass sample with a glassy structure .",
    "however , coupling terms either preserve or break the invariance @xmath28 and @xmath29 in the elastic and magnetic free energies , respectively . in the absence of any information , we model it as a weighted sum of symmetry - preserving and -breaking terms given by @xmath30\\ ] ] where @xmath31 is magnetoelastic coupling coefficient and @xmath32 is an adjustable weight factor",
    ". other types of gradient coupling between @xmath5 and @xmath6 are ignored to keep the model simple .",

    "then , using the lagrangian @xmath36 and the lagrange equations of motion @xmath37 , we get @xmath38 .",

    "note that this is not a pure relaxational dynamics as @xmath42 is subject to sinusoidal and dc fields .",
    "indeed , @xmath43 is being driven through @xmath42 , which is subject to the sinusoidal field .",
    "[ note also the mutual coupling between @xmath42 and @xmath43 . ] for a sample that is clamped at one end , the above equations can be further simplified by noting that the strain at the free end is small even though it is in the anharmonic regime .",
    "thus we assume that only the dominant mode of vibration is supported .",
    "we use @xmath44 and @xmath45 , where @xmath46 , with @xmath47 representing the length of the ribbon .",
    "further , we note that the dc field induces a finite strain value , which can be determined by equating the strain energy with the magnetic energy .",
    "the application of the ac magnetic field induces oscillations around this strain value .",
    "thus we use the dominant mode to represent deviation from the equilibrium value of the dc field , i.e. , @xmath48 . here , @xmath49 is the strain amplitude in the presence of both magnetic fields and @xmath50 is that when only the dc field is imposed . transforming eqs.([s],[m ] ) into rescaled variables ( @xmath51 ) and using only the dominant mode",

    "equations ( [ a ] ) and ( [ b ] ) constitute a coupled set of nonlinear nonautonomous ordinary differential equations with several parameters",

    "in addition , both @xmath0 and @xmath1 are the experimental drive parameters . apart from this",
    ", we have no knowledge of the values of the parameters .",
    "the dynamics of the above system of equations is quite complicated due to the presence of several parameters .",
    "clearly , interesting dynamics can be expected when @xmath54 is in the range where three or two minima exist and when @xmath55 is negative .",
    "thus we first map - out the region of the parameter space where interesting dynamics is seen .",
    "consider the period - doubling route as a function of @xmath1 for a fixed @xmath0 . here , we keep @xmath56 so that @xmath18 state is unstable , although interesting dynamics is also observed for @xmath57 as well .",
    "other parameters are fixed at @xmath58 , and @xmath59 .",
    "the application of the dc field in the presence of ac field has two effects .",
    "first , the vibrations are centered around the strain induced by the dc field .",
    "this has already been included in the definition of @xmath60 .",
    "second , the free energy for the magnetic order parameter is tilted to one side . in addition",
    ", the shape of the free energy is also affected due to the presence of nonlinear magnetoelastic coupling . in particular , note that apart from the additive @xmath61 term in eq .",
    "( [ a ] ) , @xmath62 appears multiplicatively with @xmath60 ( equivalent to parametric forcing ) .",
    "this affects the shape of the effective elastic free energy .",
    "thus we should expect @xmath12 to be a function of @xmath1 . to understand this",
    ", we first note that in the absence of @xmath1 , increasing the amplitude of the ac field gives period - doubling bifurcation , as expected from studies on duffing - like oscillators @xcite .",
    "increasing @xmath12 also leads to period - doubling sequence keeping @xmath63 , but keeping @xmath0 at a value where we find period one .",
    "in contrast , keeping @xmath0 at a values where chaos is seen ( with @xmath64 ) and increasing @xmath1 reverses the period doubling sequence , reflecting the compensating relationship between @xmath12 and @xmath1 .",
    "this can be made quantitative by keeping @xmath65 ( a value corresponding to a period - four orbit ) and increasing both @xmath1 and @xmath12 such that we always see the period - four orbit .",
    "this gives a relation @xmath66 .",
    "however , while @xmath12 is linear in @xmath1 , the prefactor depends on the value of @xmath0 used .    for further calculations , we use this parameterized form of @xmath12 in eqs.([a],[b ] ) .",
    "then , increasing @xmath1 and keeping @xmath67 leads to period - doubling route to chaos .",
    "all quantitative measures are obtained after discarding the first @xmath68 time steps . a plot of pd sequence is shown in fig .",
    "[ pd - bif ] .",
    "the pd route is seen for a range of parameter values around those used for fig .",
    "[ pd - bif ] .    now consider quasiperiodic route to chaos .",
    "for this case we choose the driving frequency to be less than that for the period - doubling route ( @xmath69 ) .",
    "for the results reported here @xmath70 , but the similar results are obtained for a range of values of @xmath71 less than unity .",
    "we retain most values of the parameters as in the pd sequence , but use higher coupling @xmath72 and @xmath73 . in this case , keeping @xmath74 fixed , we sweep @xmath0 from @xmath75 onwards .",
    "we find the first few harmonic frequencies ( as found in turbulence of rotating fluid ; see ref .",
    "@xcite ) in the region @xmath76 to @xmath77 , beyond which quasiperiodicty is seen until @xmath78 with the emergence of two incommensurate frequencies . a plot of the torus in the @xmath79 space is shown in fig .",
    "[ qp - route](a ) for @xmath80 . the corresponding poincar map in the @xmath81 plane is shown in fig . [ qp - route](b ) .",
    "( the largest lyapunov exponent vanishes in the regions of quasiperiodicity . )",
    "we find three regions of chaos interrupted by windows of quasiperiodicity in the interval @xmath82 to @xmath83 .",
    "the first region of chaos is seen between @xmath84 to @xmath85 preceded by a phase locked region .",
    "this is followed by a transition to quasiperiodic regime ( @xmath86 ) followed by an abrupt transition to chaos ( @xmath87 ) .",
    "another region of chaos is seen for @xmath88 .",
    "the poincar map for the chaotic region ( @xmath89 ) is shown in fig .",
    "[ qp - route](c ) .",
    "the qp route to chaos is observed for a range of values of parameters around the values used for fig .",
    "[ qp - route ] .",
    "we next examine the possibility of induced and suppressed chaos when the system is subjected to small - amplitude near - resonant perturbation of the form @xmath90 , with @xmath91 close to the first or the second subharmonic . for illustration",
    "we use @xmath92 , keeping @xmath93 small . to do this",
    "we first locate a direct transition from period - two cycle to chaos as a function of @xmath1 , keeping perturbing field @xmath94 .",
    "we find that this transition occurs when @xmath95 ( except for @xmath96 , all other parameters values are the same as for pd route ) .",
    "a bifurcation diagram for the strain amplitude is shown in the inset of fig .",
    "[ shift - chaos ] .",
    "keeping @xmath97 , we apply the perturbing signal @xmath98 with @xmath99 . even for small @xmath100",
    "we find that the onset of chaos is delayed .",
    "further , the magnitude of the shift , though small , increases linearly with @xmath100 . identifying @xmath101 with the onset of chaos ( @xmath102 ) when @xmath103 and @xmath104 with that for finite @xmath100 , the normalized shift ( @xmath105 ) @xmath106 for the onset of chaos ( obtained by computing the lyapunov exponent ) as function of @xmath100 is shown in fig .",
    "[ shift - chaos ] .",
    "we have also studied the influence of @xmath93 on the nature of the dynamics .",
    "for instance , for @xmath107 , we find induced chaos .",
    "the magnitude of the shift in the onset of chaos ( @xmath108 ) , which is significantly higher than that for the suppressed chaos , is shown in fig .",
    "[ shift - chaos ] .",
    "in summary , we have developed a coupled oscillator model where the weak magnetic nonlinearity drives the highly nonlinear strain order parameter .",
    "the model explains several experimental results on the dynamics of the magnetostrictive ribbon such as ( a ) the period - doubling bifurcation as a function of @xmath1 and keeping @xmath0 fixed , ( b ) the quasiperiodic route to chaos as a function of @xmath0 for a fixed dc field , and ( c ) induced and suppressed chaos under the influence of the resonant perturbing field @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "however , the suppressed chaos seen here is for small @xmath93 while induced chaos is seen for large @xmath93 , which is the opposite of what has been reported .",
    "this may be attributed to parametric type of forcing in our equations .",
    "note that the method of control of chaos is different from traditional methods @xcite .",
    "the model demonstrates induced and suppressed chaos in the presence of near - resonant perturbation .",
    "the model exhibits rich dynamics including transient chaos .",
    "for instance , for the symmetry restoring crisis [ ishii86 ] , we find that the mean time @xmath109 spent in the precrisis attractor scales as @xmath110 , where @xmath111 is the critical value , with @xmath112 .",
    "the approach is clearly applicable to any coupled order parameter system @xcite such as magnetomartensites @xcite , which exhibits high elastic strain and magnetization , and ferroelectromagnetic materials , which exhibit magnetization and electric polarization @xcite .",
    "such systems are also described by polynomial forms of free energy , as used in the model .",
    "our analysis suggests rich dynamics if experiments are performed in a similar geometry on these materials .",
    "this should encourage dynamic experiments in these materials where experiments are traditionally carried out in quasistatic conditions .",
    "the model has been adopted to explain some old unexplained results @xcite in the internal friction experiments on samples of nonmagnetic martensite samples of @xmath113 reported @xcite .",
    "these experiments have also been carried out in a similar geometry ( but transverse drive ) near martensite transformation temperature @xmath114 , where the elastic nonlinearities are significant .",
    "our equations automatically describe the twinned structure in one dimension when the magnetic free - energy contribution is dropped @xcite .",
    "the model recovers all results @xcite including the period four cycle ( which the authors even fail to recognize ; see fig . 2 of @xcite ) .    these equations in their present form",
    "describe the dynamics of magnetomartensites as well @xcite .",
    "these alloys undergo a first - order martensitic transformation on cooling below @xmath115 and are also ferromagnetic below the curie temperature @xmath27 .",
    "below @xmath114 and @xmath27 they have high degree of elastic and magnetic nonlinearities .",
    "indeed , the application of a small amount of magnetic field induces large strains by the rearrangement of martensite variants @xcite .",
    "similarly , stress also affects magnetization , thereby suggesting strong magnetoelastic coupling .",
    "thus a rich dynamics is predicted in magnetomartensites if experiments are performed in a similar geometry .",
    "it would be interesting to verify this prediction .    finally ,",
    "since the application of magnetic field can induce large strains ( as high as @xmath116 ) , magnetomartensites are better suited for actuator applications than even the best magnetostrictive materials ( such as terfenol - d , with a strain of @xmath117 ) .",
    "further , these materials should provide more accurate control of the measurement of dynamic strains compared to magnetostrictive materials @xcite .",
