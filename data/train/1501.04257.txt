    "for almost half a century since its introduction to particle physics , the standard model ( sm ) has survived many precision tests . over the years , we have attained to knowing sufficient details of its structure and parameters from experimental data . despite its success in explaining countless empirical observations ,",
    "the sm can not be a uv complete theory . from a theoretical point of view",
    ", the model is unsatisfactory for various reasons .",
    "for example , the higgs boson mass is found to be at the electroweak scale and its radiative correction poses a fine - tuning issue .",
    "there are also unanswered questions such as why fermions of different flavors have such a mass hierarchy and what is the origin of cp violation in the quark sector .",
    "experimentally , we have found the phenomena of neutrino oscillations and dark matter / energy in the universe that the sm falls short of .",
    "the discovery of the sm - like higgs boson at the mass of about 125 gev not only completes the particle spectrum in the sm , but also stimulates studies about detailed properties of the particle and pursuits of an extended higgs family . among many new physics models with a larger higgs sector ,",
    "the georgi - machacek ( gm ) model  @xcite has received much attention in view of its intriguing features .",
    "the higgs sector of gm model houses a complex triplet of hypercharge @xmath2 and a real triplet of @xmath3 under the sm @xmath4 gauge symmetry , in addition to a sm - like doublet . with vacuum alignment between the complex and real triplets",
    ", the model preserves the custodial symmetry at tree level , granting the possibility of a triplet vacuum expectation value ( vev ) as large as up to a few tens of gev .",
    "naturalness associated with divergent one - loop corrections to the electroweak @xmath5 parameter and certain mixings among the higgs bosons have been studied and found to be similar to the sm higgs mass  @xcite .",
    "the model predicts the existence of many higgs bosons , forming two singlets , one triplet , and one quintet under the custodial symmetry  @xcite .",
    "there have been extensive phenomenological studies of the exotic higgs bosons in the literature  @xcite , including their effects in enhancing the strength of phase transition in electroweak baryogenesis  @xcite .",
    "due to mixing between the doublet and the triplet fields , the coupling between the sm - like higgs boson and the weak gauge bosons can be greater than the sm value  @xcite , which is impossible for models with only extra @xmath1 singlet and/or doublet fields .",
    "septet scalar field with @xmath6 is another possibility to obtain @xmath7 .",
    "such a model also predicts @xmath8 without the need of vacuum alignment@xcite . ] besides , the model has a flavor - universal correction to the yukawa couplings of the sm - like higgs boson .",
    "although some of the above - mentioned features are also shared by the septet extension model  @xcite , the latter suffers from an accidental @xmath9 symmetry that could lead to an undesirable nambu - goldstone ( ng ) boson if it is broken spontaneously .",
    "there are also supersymmetric  @xcite and little higgs extensions  @xcite of the gm model .    in this paper",
    ", we concentrate on the productions and decays of the neutral higgs bosons in the gm model at the cern large hadron collider ( lhc ) . after the discovery of the 125-gev higgs boson , it is of great interest to know whether there exists another neutral higgs boson of higher or even lower mass .",
    "therefore , continued efforts are made to search for such higgs - like resonances within the full mass range explorable at the lhc , utilizing various major production and decay channels .",
    "such searches offer the exclusion limit in each channel as a function of the higgs mass . in the gm model , there are totally four neutral higgs bosons .",
    "we use @xmath10 , @xmath11 to denote respectively the sm - like higgs boson discovered at the lhc and the other higgs singlet .",
    "both of them are mixtures of the cp - even custodial singlets .",
    "the other two are the cp - odd @xmath12 belonging to the triplet and the cp - even @xmath13 in the quintet .",
    "since @xmath10 and @xmath11 are mixed states of the two singlets , they involve essentially the same production and decay processes . for definiteness in our analysis , we ignore the possibility of @xmath14 , with @xmath15 denoting any of the other neutral higgs bosons , because of the uncertainties in the triple higgs couplings .",
    "due to its odd cp property , the @xmath12 boson does not couple to the weak gauge bosons at tree level .",
    "therefore , it can only be produced via the gluon - gluon fusion ( ggf ) and top associated production channels .",
    "its decay modes do not include the weak boson pairs .",
    "for sufficiently high mass , in particular , it can also decay into @xmath16 . on the other hand ,",
    "the @xmath13 boson comes purely from the weak isospin triplet fields and does not couple to the sm fermions at tree level .",
    "consequently , it can only be produced through the vector boson fusion ( vbf ) and higgs - strahlung production processes , and decay only to the final states of @xmath17 , @xmath18 , and @xmath19 .",
    "it is our objectives in this work to study in detail the above - mentioned features of the neutral higgs bosons in the gm model and to constrain the model using the available search data .",
    "this paper is organized as follows .",
    "section  [ sec : model ] briefly reviews the gm model and , in particular , provides the couplings of the neutral higgs bosons with the sm fermions and weak gauge bosons .",
    "we show how such couplings vary from their sm values as one adjusts the triplet vev and the mixing angle @xmath0 between the two singlets . in view of good agreement between the measured higgs data and the sm predictions ,",
    "we will focus on the region of small @xmath0 . in section  [ sec : br ]",
    ", we discuss the decay branching ratios and the signal strengths of different production channels for each of the neutral higgs bosons in the model .",
    "section  [ sec : constraints ] discusses the constraints on the gm model based upon experimental searches of another sm - like higgs bosons in various channels .",
    "this complements the other constraints from doubly - charged higgs boson searches and indirectly from @xmath20 physics and electroweak precision data .",
    "we summarize our analysis in section  [ sec : summary ] .",
    "the higgs sector in the gm model comprises an isospin doublet field @xmath21 with @xmath22 , a complex triplet field @xmath23 with @xmath24 , and a real triplet field @xmath25 with @xmath26 , where the electric charge @xmath27 is given by @xmath28 with @xmath29 being the third isospin generator .",
    "organized in an @xmath30 covariant form , one has : @xmath31 where the phase convention for the component scalar fields is such that @xmath32 , @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 .",
    "moreover , the neutral components after electroweak symmetry breaking are parameterized as @xmath36 where @xmath37 , @xmath38 and @xmath39 denote the vev s of @xmath21 , @xmath23 and @xmath25 , respectively .",
    "the most general higgs potential consistent with the @xmath40 symmetry has four dimensionful and five dimensionless parameters .",
    "its explicit form can be found , for example , in ref .",
    "@xcite .",
    "when the vev s of the two triplet fields are aligned : @xmath41 , the original @xmath30 symmetry in the higgs potential of the model breaks down to the custodial @xmath42 symmetry . in this case , the masses of the @xmath43 and @xmath44 bosons have exactly the same form as in the sm : @xmath45 and @xmath46 , where @xmath47 is the weak mixing angle and @xmath48 .",
    "therefore , the electroweak @xmath5 parameter keeps unity at tree level . following the convention in ref .",
    "@xcite , we define the ratio of the vev s as @xmath49 note that @xmath50 is the reciprocal of @xmath51 used in most other works and goes to infinity in the sm limit .    the component scalar fields can be classified into irreducible representations of @xmath42 multiplets : the @xmath52 field is decomposed as @xmath53 , and the @xmath54 field as @xmath55 after the @xmath56 symmetry breaking . as a result , we have one 5-plet , two 3-plet and two singlet representations under the custodial @xmath42 symmetry .",
    "the 5-plet , denoted by @xmath57 , arises within the @xmath54 field .",
    "the two 3-plet fields mix through the angle @xmath58 to render a physical cp - odd higgs 3-plet , denoted by @xmath59 , and another ng 3-plet , @xmath60 , to become the longitudinal components of the weak gauge bosons .",
    "the two cp - even singlet fields further mix by an angle @xmath0 , determined by the quartic coupling constants in the higgs potential , to produce the sm - like higgs boson @xmath10 and another physical singlet denoted by @xmath11 . due to the custodial symmetry ,",
    "higgs bosons belonging to the same @xmath42 multiplet are degenerate in mass .",
    "therefore , we will simply use @xmath61 to denote the masses of @xmath62 , respectively . for later uses ,",
    "we write out the physical neutral higgs fields in terms of the original component scalar fields as follows : @xmath63 here we identify the quantum of the @xmath10 field as the 125-gev higgs boson found at the lhc .",
    "note that , the @xmath12 does not couple to the weak gauge bosons at tree level , whereas the @xmath13 does not couple to the sm fermions .",
    "denote the couplings of a neutral higgs boson @xmath15 ( @xmath64 or @xmath13 ) to a sm fermion pair and a weak gauge boson in the model by @xmath65 and @xmath66 , respectively .",

    "we discuss in this section patterns of the branching ratios and signal strengths for each of the neutral higgs bosons in the model . in this paper , we define the signal strength of a particular higgs production channel at lhc as the production rate in the gm model normalized to the sm production rate for a fictitious higgs with the same mass : @xmath98 =   \\frac{\\sigma^{\\rm gm}(pp \\to \\varphi){\\cal b}^{\\rm gm}(\\varphi \\to x ) }       { \\sigma^{\\rm sm}(pp \\to \\varphi){\\cal b}^{\\rm sm}(\\varphi \\to x ) } ~,\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath99 is some decay final state of @xmath15 , @xmath100 and @xmath101 denote respectively the cross section and branching ratio , and the narrow width approximation for @xmath15 has been assumed .",
    "since the sm - like higgs boson @xmath10 generally has different couplings with sm particles from the sm expectation , the signal strengths of various search channels can be different from unity .",
