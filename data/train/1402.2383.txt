    "for a long time quantum entanglement ( `` spooky action at a distance '' ) @xcite was only of philosophical interest until people had found out various ways of utilizing it as a resource for information processing protocols like quantum teleportation @xcite , quantum super - dense coding , entanglement broadcasting and quantum cryptography @xcite .    in quantum cryptography when we work with quantum systems , entanglement probes to be an useful resource in carrying out various protocols .",
    "quantum secret sharing is no exception to it . in a nut shell",
    ", secret sharing refers to a situation where the sender shares a secret message between other parties in such a way that none of them can reveal the secret without the collaboration of others .    in quantum secret sharing ( qss ) @xcite",
    "generally we deal with the problem of sharing of both classical as well as quantum secrets .",
    "this is done by using quantum resources like entangled states ; mostly pure entangled state .",
    "these protocols include various attempts on tightening the security in presence of eaves droppers .",
    "it is not necessary that we always require three qubit entangled state as a resource for the most simplest secret sharing protocols .",
    "karlsson et.al.@xcite showed that similar quantum secret sharing protocols using bipartite pure entangled states also exist .",
    "however in general research was carried out mainly investigating the concept of quantum secret sharing using tripartite pure entangled states and multipartite states like graph states @xcite as resources .",
    "more precisely when we talk about multiqubit secret sharing , we generally talk about a situation where the dealer wants to send multiple secrets ; is a qss scheme to various reconstructors . apart from classical and quantum secret sharing",
    ", protocols have been given to share semi - quantum secrets using entangled states as the resource @xcite .",
    "recently in the reference @xcite , it was shown that quantum secret sharing is possible even with bipartite two qubit mixed states formed due to the transmission of qubits through noisy environment . in a realistic situation , the secret sharing of classical or quantum information will involve the transmission of qubits through noisy environment . as a result of which",
    "the resource state will become a mixed - state and the secret sharing will no longer be a deterministic one . in reference @xcite , authors proposed a protocol for secret sharing of classical information in the presence of such noise . in different works like @xcite , it has been shown that quantum secret sharing is not only a mere theoretical concept , but also an experimental possibility .    in another piece of work authors",
    "have investigated the revocation of quantum secret back to the dealer and routing quantum information to different receivers in a network @xcite . in the long run quantum secret sharing",
    "is also an important area to study in various quantum networks ( qnet ) as in recent times researchers have seen that both classical as well as quantum information can be transferred elegantly through quantum networks @xcite .",
    "it is quite well - known that environmental interactions incurring loss of fidelity of the shared secret is an ubiquitous process and unless controlled using well - formulated schemes can reduce a shared secret in a pure state to one in maximally mixed state during the reconstruction phase .",
    "hence it becomes imperative to devise schemes of improving the fidelity of shared secret . in references",
    "@xcite , authors have suggested that one can apply weak measurements @xcite to protect the fidelity of quantum states subjected to decoherence through an amplitude damping channel ( adc ) and this technique is even shown to be practically implementable . recently in @xcite , authors have shown how efficiently one can employ the technique of weak measurement with post selection and its reversal to improve the fidelity of teleportation through an adc .",
    "they also show how to exploit the power of post selection @xcite in weak measurements to work with sub - ensemble of the initial states and hence reduce the suppression of decoherence of the transmitted qubits .    in this work",
    "we have given a protocol for sequential multi qubit secret sharing .",
    "this sequential secret sharing is useful when the dealer is not having all the secrets at the beginning of the protocol and wishes to send the secrets at subsequent stages . by our protocol",
    "one can achieve sequential secret sharing .",
    "we have also considered a realistic situation when the qubits are transferred from the dealer to other parties through noisy quantum channel . in that case",
    "we have seen that the fidelity of secret sharing at the @xmath2 iteration is independent of the effect of noise at the @xmath3 iteration .",
    "finally we employ the technique of weak measurement with post selection and its reversal to improve the fidelity of the shared secret under the effect of adc . for any given input state parameters and strength of decoherence channel",
    ", we find out for what values of strength parameters of weak measurement and reverse weak measurement will help one to gain maximum fidelity of reconstructing the shared secret .",
    "we also show how the success probability of such an improvement technique decreases with increase in strength of weak measurement and that of the decoherence channel .",
    "in this section , we present a protocol by which alice ( the dealer ) will securely share the secrets @xmath5 among @xmath6 parties at various stages of the protocol . by this",
    "we refer to a situation where the dealer is not having all the secrets at the beginning of the protocol .",
    "so he / she shares them at subsequent stages depending on the availability of the secrets .      in this subsection",
    "we begin with three parties , where alice is the dealer and bob and charlie are the receivers .",
    "alice wants to share the secrets @xmath7 , ( where @xmath8 and @xmath9 is from 1 to @xmath10 ) at the @xmath11 iteration of the protocol , to both bob and charlie .",
    "however to do so alice needs to share a quantum resource with the other two parties . in order to prepare this resource state alice starts with a bell state , say @xmath12 .",
    "the combined system of the bell state and the secret @xmath13 , available to her at the first iteration is given by , @xmath14 now alice carries out a xor operation between qubits 1 and 2 to obtain the three qubit entangled state @xmath15 then alice keeps the qubit 2 with herself and sends the remaining qubits 1 and 3 to charlie and bob respectively . here",
    "we consider the transfer of qubits to take place in an idealistic situation where the medium of transfer is free of noise .",
    "the three qubit entangled state shared between them can be re - written as @xmath16 .",
    "\\label{eq : final3state}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] after that alice measures her qubit in the computational basis @xmath17 and charlie measures his qubit in @xmath18 basis . at this point",
    ", alice does not tell either bob or charlie about her measurement outcomes .",
    "this implies that the single - qubit density matrices of both bob s and charlie s qubits are @xmath19 , where @xmath20 is the @xmath21 identity matrix .",
    "thus at this stage of the protocol neither bob nor charlie has any information about alice s qubit . unlike other protocols , it is interesting to note that in our protocol we are carrying out single qubit measurements at two different locations instead of two qubit bell measurement .",
    "once the measurement is over from alice s side the secret is shared between other two parties , bob and charlie .",
    "however neither of them can reveal the secret without the collaboration of the other party .",
    "this completes the sharing of alice s secret .",
    "now if bob wants to reveal the secret , then both alice and charlie have to send their measurement outcomes to bob in form of one classical bit .",
    "depending on the outcomes of charlie and alice , bob can reveal the secret by applying appropriate set of unitary transformations .",
    "this set of unitary transformations is shown in the following ( table [ tbl : operators ] ) .",
    ".*sharing of quantum secrets [ tbl : operators ] * [ cols=\"^,^\",options=\"header \" , ]     however if alice wishes to carry out further secret sharing , charlie needs to send his qubit to alice . on receiving the qubit from charlie",
    ", alice applies the unitary transformation to convert it into @xmath22 state .",
    "in addition to that at each iteration alice needs the state @xmath23 . with this single qubit state and the state obtained from charlie she applies xor operation to re -",
    "create a bell pair @xmath24 .",
    "then she follows the same steps to carry out further secret sharing .",
    "the key point of the protocol is that in order to carry out sequential secret sharing , at the end of each iteration alice needs the supply of the qubit @xmath23 along with the qubit transferred by charlie .      in this subsection",
    ", we extend our protocol for a situation where we have more than three parties and consider a much more generalized condition having @xmath6 parties other than the dealer herself .",
    "the protocol for multi party secret sharing is mainly a natural extension of our protocol for three parties .",
    "however the resource state required for secret sharing in this case is an @xmath25 qubit pure entangled state given by , @xmath26 where @xmath27 and @xmath28 are the input state parameters .",
    "this state is obtained by alice after performing a xor operation on the secret available to her at the first iteration with any one of the qubits of the n qubit ghz state ( @xmath29 $ ] ) .",
    "alice measures the second qubit in @xmath17 basis and distributes the qubit such that the party who is supposed to reconstruct the secret ( say bob ) is given the 1st qubit . in the reconstruction phase",
    "all the other parties have to measure their qubits in @xmath18 basis and convey their results to bob .",
    "if alice wishes to go for further secret sharing the qubits are to be returned back to her by others except bob .",
    "she applies the appropriate unitary transformation to convert them to @xmath30 state and uses the qubit @xmath23 along with these @xmath31 qubits to perform a chained xor .",
    "this results in a resource state given by ,    @xmath32",
    "in this section , we consider a more realistic situation where three parties share a three qubit mixed entangled state instead of a three qubit pure entangled state as a resource .",
    "similarly , here also , we start with a pure entangled state @xmath33 , initially with all the qubits with alice .",
    "now alice keeps the second qubit with herself and sends the remaining qubits ( 1 & 3 ) to charlie and bob .",
    "she sends them through a noisy quantum channel . since practically no channel is completely noise - free , such an analysis in the absence of noise is imperative .",
    "we study our protocol under the effects of both phase damping channel(pdc ) and amplitude damping channel(adc ) .      in the first subsection",
    ", we study the effects of pdc on the secret sharing fidelity when the qubits are sent through this channel .",

    "these four states are given by ,    @xmath44    since the channel through which the qubits are sent is a noisy channel , the qubit obtained by bob is no longer the desired qubit but a single qubit mixed state @xmath41 . at this point",

    "proceeding similar to the above case of pdc , the fidelity of quantum secret sharing is obtained by optimizing over all possible complex unitaries given by @xmath61 unlike the case of pdc , here we can not convert all the four @xmath41 exactly to @xmath62 using unitary operations .",
    "however we can convert them pairwise . by applying the unitary operations in table [ tbl : operators ]",

    "this is because at each and every iteration there is reusability of charlie s qubit . though charlie s qubit is affected by noise and will also get further affected when he sends back his qubit to alice , this noise is not going to play a part in the subsequent iterations .",
    "this is because alice on getting back the qubit from charlie measures it in the computational basis @xmath17 and transforms it accordingly to the state @xmath22 by applying the appropriate unitary transformation .",
    "in the previous section we have noticed that in a realistic situation the shared qubits are subjected to decoherence due to the presence of noise .",
    "this environmental interaction results in inevitable loss of fidelity of obatining the shared secret .",
    "the reconstructed secret under noise becomes a mixed state , and under certain conditions the average fidelity drops to @xmath4 .",
    "it then becomes of no more use than what can be obtained by employing random guess .",
    "thus , there arises an exigency to improve the fidelity of reconstructing the shared secret .",

    "we show how to improve the fidelity of the shared secret in the protocol of sequential quantum secret sharing under the influence of adc with the help of weak measurements and post - selection .",
    "we find that in the case of pdc since both the qubit states @xmath30 and @xmath68 get affected by decoherence , unlike adc where @xmath30 state remains unaltered , this method of reverse weak measurement and post - selection can not be employed to improve the fidelity of the shared secret .    in this protocol",
