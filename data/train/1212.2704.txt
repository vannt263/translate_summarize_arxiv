    "quantum chromo - dynamics(qcd ) is the well - established theory of strong interactions .",
    "quarks are the basic constituents of qcd , which interact through the exchange of gluons .",

    "lattice qcd predicts this new phase , qgp , at high temperatures(@xmath5155 - 160 mev )  @xcite .",
    "the motivation of the relativistic heavy ion physics is the experimental study of the hadronic matter under extreme conditions of temperature  @xcite .",
    "this is the main reason for the present heavy ion program ongoing at the relativistic heavy - ion collider ( rhic , at brookhaven national laboratory in new york ) and at the large hadron collider ( lhc , at the european organization for nuclear research in geneva ) .",
    "a wealth of ideas have been proposed in the past few decades on the experimental and theoretical understanding of qgp properties  @xcite .",
    "the plasma is short lived and all signals from qgp have background from the hot hadronic phase that follows the qcd phase transition .",
    "therefore , it is important to understand the physics in hot hadronic phase with different experimental probes  @xcite .",
    "among the possible probes of the qgp , the interest in heavy quarks is motivated by their unique role in the diagnostics of the highly excited medium created in relativistic heavy - ion collisions . both experimentally and theoretically for over two decades , the properties of heavy quarkonium states(which are bound states of heavy quark - antiquark pairs , charmonium and bottomonium ) in a hot and dense qcd medium have been intensely studied  @xcite .",
    "heavy - quark mass is large and so heavy - quark production is believed to be occur largely within the earliest phase of the collision .",
    "therefore , the measurement of quarkonia is expected to provide essential information on the properties of the strongly - interacting system formed in the early stages of heavy - ion collisions  @xcite .",
    "if a @xmath6@xmath7 particle(a @xmath8 bound state ) is placed in qgp , the color charge of the charm quark @xmath9 will get screened by the quarks , anti - quarks and the gluons of the plasma . the charmonium production was discussed as an important probe of plasma  @xcite , along with the suggestion by matsui and satz  @xcite which affirmed that with increasing centrality in heavy - ion collisions a suppression of the @xmath6@xmath7 is expected .",
    "the dissociation of the charmonium bound - state in a dense medium is connected with the debye screening of the binding potential .",
    "this is influenced by a deconfinement of color charges and thus intimately connected to the formation of a qgp  @xcite .",
    "comprehensive experimental results at sps  @xcite ( including feeddown from other less bound resonances like @xmath10 and @xmath11 ) and rhic of @xmath6@xmath7 production in aa collisions clearly indicate that even the strongly bound @xmath6@xmath7 ground state is suppressed  @xcite .",
    "however at lhc energies the @xmath6@xmath7 production could be even enhanced due to the coalescence of uncorrelated @xmath12 pairs in the medium  @xcite .",
    "initial state effects like modifications of the parton distribution functions in the nucleus relative to the nucleon shadowing need to be taken into account .",
    "the final state effects like the nuclear absorption are expected to be practically insignificant at the lhc energies .",
    "various statistical and transport models  @xcite are proposed for lhc energies . studying the pa collisions at the lhc energies",

    "<S> the roles of suppression and regeneration mechanisms are discussed , as well as the importance of the results of the forthcoming p - pb data taking for the estimate of cold nuclear matter effects on quarkonia . </S>",
