    "the popularity of the minimal supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) in recent years is mainly due to its success in attaining gauge coupling unification : given the particle content of the mssm , the three coupling constants of the @xmath1 gauge groups converge to a common value at a common scale ( the gut scale ) when evolved up to higher energies using the renormalization group equations ( rge ) @xcite .",
    "this unification of the gauge coupling constants is crucial if one wishes to construct a grand unified theory ( gut ) which unifies the three gauge groups of the standard model ( sm ) into a larger simple group at a single scale .",
    "however , it should be noted that the particle content which achieves such unification is not unique @xcite .",
    "in particular , as pointed out in ref .",
    "@xcite , one always has the freedom to add complete generations of matter superfields to the mssm without destroying the unification condition .",
    "another attractive feature of the mssm is the possibility of unifying the @xmath10 and @xmath11 yukawa couplings : if one assumes @xmath12 at the gut scale is realized or not in gut s depends on the representation of the higgs field which gives mass to the fermions . for @xmath13 , @xmath14 , and @xmath15 unifications",
    ", the higgs must be in the @xmath16 , @xmath17 , and @xmath18 representations , respectively .",
    "] , then one finds that the mssm can reproduce the experimental value of @xmath19 if the yukawa couplings of the top and the bottom were such that @xmath20 ( @xmath21 ) , or @xmath22 ( @xmath23 ) .",

    "@xcite    the reason why the experimental value of @xmath33 can only be reproduced for either small or large @xmath25 is easy to understand : qcd interactions will enhance @xmath34 over @xmath35 as they are evolved down from @xmath32 to @xmath31 so that @xmath36 will end up well above the experimental value if only running due to gauge interactions were taken into account .",
    "this qcd effect must be countered by strong yukawa interactions which will slow down the running . a smaller value of @xmath33 consistent with experiment can be obtained when @xmath29 is large enough to counter the qcd enhancement alone , or when both @xmath29 and @xmath30 are large so that the two of them combined can have the desired effect . in the intermediate @xmath25 region ( @xmath37 )",

    "the small @xmath25 case is often considered particularly attractive since the large size of @xmath38 will drive @xmath39 rapidly towards an infrared _ quasi_fixed point @xcite as it is evolved down in scale . as a result ,",
    "the value of @xmath40 is highly insensitive to its initial value @xmath38 at the gut scale . on the other hand ,",
    "the large @xmath25 case opens the possibility of unifying the top yukawa coupling with the other two : @xmath41 as required in @xmath14 unification with a @xmath17higgs",
    ". however , the insensitivity to the initial condition at @xmath32 is lost .",
    "solution is that fine tuning of the higgs potential is necessary to achieve radiative electroweak symmetry breaking . in the small @xmath25 case ,",
    "radiative electroweak symmetry breaking is naturally achieved due to the initial condition @xmath42 . however , fine tuning is necessary in this case also to obtain the correct value of @xmath25 .",

    "each generation is assumed to consist of the usual 15 chiral fermion fields plus their superpartners .",
    "we will ignore the right  handed neutrino necessary to form the @xmath44 representation of @xmath14 since we will always assume it to have a superheavy majorana mass and make it decouple from the rge s . due to the mirror quantum number assignments between the 4th and @xmath43th generation fermions , they can develop @xmath0 invariant masses enabling the left  handed neutrino to have a heavy dirac mass thus circumventing the lep limit for the number of massless neutrinos .",
    "also , radiative corrections to lep observables from the extra fermions can be made to decouple by making this gauge invariant mass large.@xcite    one immediate consequence of the presence of the 2 extra generations is that all three gauge couplings of @xmath45 will be asymptotically non  free : they will become larger as they are evolved up to coincide at the unification scale  @xcite .",

    ", the qcd coupling will stay asymptotically free , and in models with 6 generations or more the couplings will diverge before unification .",
    "as shown in the appendix , the unification of gauge couplings is controlled solely by the _ differences _ of the beta function coefficients in the one - loop approximation .",
    "since the differences of the coefficients are independent of the number of full generations , the gauge coupling unification in our 5 generation model works well just as in the mssm .",

    "no fine tuning is necessary .",
    "this is shown schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig0 ] .",
    "this absence of the necessity to fine tune parameters at the uv cutoff is an extremely attractive feature of asymptotically non",
    " free theories .",
    "it means that the high energy theory effective above the uv cutoff can give the correct predictions at low energies as long as it predicts the values of the running couplings at the cutoff to be within an only mildly restricted range .",
    "this point has been emphasized previously by many authors @xcite ( though not necessarily from a modern point of view ) . in particular , moroi , murayama and",
    "yanagida @xcite have studied the same 5 generation model as we are considering here and have shown that the values of the running couplings at @xmath32 need not even be unified to predict the correct value of @xmath53 .    in this paper , we extend the analysis of moroi et al . and study how the existence of the extra generations will affect the running of the yukawa couplings of the 3rd generation fermions . a similar problem for the non  supersymetric case has been considered in @xcite . as in the mssm case , we will impose a unification condition on the yukawa couplings at @xmath32 and determine the parameter range in which our model can predict the correct top , bottom and @xmath11lepton masses .",
    "the attentive reader at this point may think that such a program is doomed to failure from the beginning .",

    "in extending the mssm by introducing extra matter superfields , we must keep two things in mind : ( 1 ) the matter superfields must be introduced in such a way that gauge coupling unification ( and anomaly cancellation ) of the mssm is preserved , and ( 2 ) the fermion content must be compatible with the constraints placed by lep measurements , namely three massless neutrino species and the so  called peskin ",
    "takeuchi constraint @xcite .",
    "the simplest way to satisfy these requirements is to introduce 2 extra generations which form a generation  mirror generation pair .",
    "we will call them the 4th and anti4th generations .",
    "the fermion content of these extra generations will be ` vector  like ' so that all of them , including the extra neutrinos , can develop @xmath0 invariant dirac masses .",
    "these masses will also suppress the size of radiative corrections to lep observables from the extra fermions enabling them to circumvent the peskin ",
    "takeuchi constraint@xcite .",
    "it should be noted that we can only introduce one such generation  mirror generation pair .",
    "if we introduce two pairs or more , all three gauge couplings will reach their landau poles and diverge well before the would  have  been unification scale@xcite .",
    "we denote the extra fermion families @xmath61 and @xmath62 , respectively , and give them a common @xmath63 invariant mass of @xmath64 .",
    "their superpartners , and all the other supersymmetric particles in the theory will be given a common susy breaking mass of @xmath65 .",
    "for the sake of simplicity , we take @xmath66 .    in addition to the @xmath63 invariant masses",
    ", we also couple the 4th and @xmath43th generation fermions to the two higgs doublets in the same way as the other generations .",
    "here we take the case where @xmath67 and set all the 1st and 2nd generation yukawa couplings to zero .",
    "furthermore , we impose the unification condition @xmath68 as mentioned in the introduction .    in view of the relatively large coupling strengths near the unification scale due to the asymptotically non - freeness",
    ", we use the fully coupled 2loop renormalization group equations ( rge s ) from ref .",

    "we ignore small differences in the masses of the 4th and @xmath43th generation particles or that of the supersymmetric particles which may be induced by the yukawa couplings and simply set all their masses at @xmath66 .",

    "therefore , between @xmath32 and @xmath69 , we evolve the couplings with the rge s for the supersymmetric sm with 5 super  generations and 2 super ",
