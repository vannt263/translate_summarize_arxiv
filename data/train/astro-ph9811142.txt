    "is has often been argued that since h iobservations probe the gravitational potential well outside the optical radius , in the dark matter dominated region , they are best suited to derived the characteristics of the mass distribution , thus of the * dark * mass distribution . however , this is skipping the fact that the parameters of the mass models ( and especially of the dm distribution ) are very sensitive , as shown below , to the rising inner part of the rotation curve which can be derived with greater precision using 2d h@xmath0observations ( see e.g. amram et al .",
    "1996 ) .",
    "the left part of figure [ fig1 ] , which shows the mass distribution of ngc 5585 using its h i rotation curve , illustrates the now commonly used method to study the mass distribution ( carignan & freeman 1985 ) .",
    "first , the rotation curve is obtained by fitting a `` tilted  ring '' model to the h ivelocity field in order to represent the warp of the h idisk which is very often present .",
    "the accuracy of the model representation is then checked by looking at the residuals ( data - model ) map .",
    "then , the luminosity profile , preferentially in the red , is transformed into a mass distribution for the stellar disk assuming a constant ( /l@xmath1)@xmath2(casertano 1983 , carignan 1985 ) .",
    "for the contribution of the gaseous component , the h iradial profile is used , scaled by 4/3 to account for he .",
    "the difference between the observed rotation curve and the computed contribution of the luminous ( stars & gas ) component is thus the contribution of the dark component which can be represented by an isothermal halo ( carignan 1985 ) or some other functional form .",
    "the h iobservations , often optimized for maximum sensitivity in the outer parts , have in most of the published studies a resolution of only 2045 .",
    "the example of ngc 5585 will show that this is clearly not sufficient to well determine the rising part of the rotation curve and that this part is crucial since it strongly constrains the three free parameters of the mass model ( see also swaters et al . in these proceedings ) .",
    "the fabry  perot observations of the h@xmath0emission line were obtained in 1994 february at the canada ",
    "france  hawaii telescope ( cfht).the fabry  perot etalon ( cfht1 ) was installed in the cfht s multi  object spectrograph ( mos ) . a narrow  band filter ( @xmath4 = 10 ) , centered at @xmath5 = 6570 ( nearly at the systemic velocity of ngc 5585 , v@xmath6 kms@xmath7 ) , was placed in front of the etalon .",
    "the available field with no vignetting was @xmath8 8.7@xmath9 8.7 , with .34 pix @xmath7 .",
    "the free spectral range of 5.66 ( 258 kms@xmath7 ) was scanned in 28 channels , giving a sampling of 0.2 ( 9.2 kms@xmath7)per channel .",
    "eight minutes integration was spent at each channel position .",
    "after standard reduction , images are assembled in a cube and phase calibrated in order to get one particular wavelength in a plane .",
    "a velocity map is then obtained using the intensity weighted mean of the h@xmath0 peak in each pixel .",
    "the rotation curve have been deduced from the velocity field following two different methods .",
    "the first estimate was made using rocur ( begeman 1987 ) where annuli in the plane of the galaxy ( ellipse in the plane of sky ) are fitted to the velocity field in order to minimize the velocity dispersion inside these rings .",
    "this allows to determine the rotation center , systemic velocity , position angle and inclination .",
    "the adhoc package ( boulesteix 1993 ) have then been used to fine tuned these parameters by direct visualization and comparison with residual velocity field . note",
    "that the internal errors on h iirotation curves data points are usually larger than on h irotation curves data points reflecting the larger local motions in the h iiregions .",
    "for our adopted mass model of ngc 5585 , we combine the high resolution h@xmath0data in the inner parts high sensitivity of the h idata in the outer parts . since we are doing best ",
    "fit models , we have to be careful .",
    "first , as explained earlier , the h iidata points have larger intrinsic errors .",
    "this means that they will carry smaller weights in the fitting process . on the other hand , because of the higher resolution , there is more h iidata points than h idata points .",
    "this means that the optical data would tend to have a higher weight than the radio data . to avoid any bias",
    ", we decided to use for the final model the h@xmath0data for r  @xmath10  120 and the h idata for r  @xmath11  120 .",
    "table  [ tab : mod5585 ] gives the parameters of the mass models constructed using only the h irotation curve , the h@xmath0rotation curve , and those for the model using the combined h i & h@xmath0rotation curve .",
    "this adopted model is showed in the right part of figure [ fig1 ] .",
    "as expected , @xmath12 is very similar in the combined h i & h@xmath0curve than in the h irotation curve .",
    "this is the case because this parameter is a measure of the maximum amplitude of the rotation curve which is mainly defined by the h idata in the outer parts .",
    "however , the two other parameters ( /l@xmath1)@xmath2for the stellar disk and r@xmath13 of the dark halo ( which are coupled ) have nearly the same values than those derived with the h@xmath0curve . again",
    ", this is because the ( /l@xmath1)@xmath2of the luminous stellar disk , and hence the scaling parameter of the dark halo r@xmath13 , are mainly constrained by the h iidata in the inner parts .    in summary , adding the h@xmath0data to the h idata of ngc 5585 , increases in the best ",
    "fit model the ( /l@xmath1)@xmath2of the stellar disk from 0.3 to 0.8 .",
    "the result is to push the dark halo outward and reduced by @xmath14 30% the dark  to  luminous mass ratio .",
    "the importance of an accurate determination of the rising part of the rotation curves using full 2d high resolution fabry - perot observations is well illustrated by the example of ngc 5585 which resulted in a @xmath1430% difference in its dark  to  luminous mass ratio .",
    "this is one of the motivation behind the * ghasp * project , which intends to map accurately the h@xmath0velocity fields of @xmath14200300 nearby spiral and dwarf galaxies using fabry ",
    "perot observations . the candidate galaxies will be selected from the * whisp * project , which intend to map the h iin 10003000 galaxies in the next ten years .",
    "this should be the best way to study possible correlations between the parameters of the dm halos and other properties of the galaxies .",
