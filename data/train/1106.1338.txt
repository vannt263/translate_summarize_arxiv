    "<S> coherent properties of a two - dimensional spatially periodic structure , polaritonic crystal ( polc ) formed by trapped two - level atoms in an optical cavity array interacting with a light field , are analyzed . by considering the wave function overlapping for both photonic and atomic states , </S>",
    "<S> a cubic - quintic complex nonlinear schrdinger equation is derived for the dynamics of coupled atom - light states , wave function of low - branch polaritons , associated with polc in the continuous limit . </S>",
    "<S> a variational approach predicts that a stable ground - state wave function of polc exists but is accompanied by an oscillating width . for a negative scattering length , </S>",
    "<S> the wave function collapses in the presence of a small quintic nonlinearity appearing due to a three - body polariton interaction . by studying the nonequilibrium ( dissipative ) dynamics of polaritons with adiabatic approximation </S>",
    "<S> , we have shown that the collapse of polc wave function can be prevented even in the presence of small decaying of a number of polariton particles . </S>"
