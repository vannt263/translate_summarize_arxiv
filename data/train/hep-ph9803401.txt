    "supersymmetry ( susy ) is a highly favoured candidate theory for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) .",
    "of particular interest are the flavour changing neutral current transitions involving the quark - squark - gluino vertex and the non - removable cp - violating phases which arise as the renormalisation group equations ( rge ) scale the physics down from the unification scale @xmath8 gev to the electroweak scale .",
    "these effects of susy have implications for rare b decays and mixings @xcite and for other observables such as quark electric dipole moments @xcite .",
    "measurements of rare flavour - changing b decays provide opportunities for the discovery of indirect effects of susy @xcite as the measured observables involve sm and susy processes occurring at the same order of perturbation theory .",
    "in contrast to the situation for @xmath9 mixing where new physics is expected to change the magnitude of the cp - asymmetries but not the patterns of asymmetries predicted by the sm @xcite , the effects of new physics in decay amplitudes depends on the specific processes and decay channel under consideration and , although small , may be detectable by comparing measurements that within the sm should yield the same quantity .",
    "the @xmath10 transition provides an opportunity to study cp violation from non - standard phases @xcite and there is significant current interest in the @xmath11 penguin decay for which it has been argued @xcite that enhancement for on - shell gluons is needed from non - sm physics to explain the cleo measurement @xcite of a large branching ratio for @xmath12 and the @xmath13 gluon anomaly .    for the gluon - mediated exclusive hadronic decays studied here the effects of susy are expected to be small and difficult to disentangle from the sm effects because of the large uncertainties associated with the sm predictions .",
    "the sm calculations involve @xcite the computation of the quark level decays @xmath14 , calculation of the wilson coefficients @xcite to incorporate qcd corrections as the physics is renormalised down from the electroweak scale to the scale @xmath15 and , finally , the calculation of hadronic matrix elements for the hadronisation of the final - state quarks into particular final states , typically evaluated using the factorisation assumption . as this last stage",
    "can introduce such large uncertainties that predicted sm rates for exclusive hadronic penguin decays can be in error by a factor of 2 to 3 , we will restrict the present study to the weak scale quark level processes where any differences between sm and susy physics are more apparent .",
    "the most predictive of the susy models is the ( constrained ) minimally supersymmetric standard model ( mssm ) @xcite based on spontaneously broken @xmath16 supergravity with flat khler metrics @xcite , universal explicit soft - susy breaking terms at the scale @xmath17 and spontaneous breaking of the @xmath18 symmetry driven by radiative corrections .",
    "such models contain two cp - violating phases @xmath19 from the soft - susy breaking terms in addition to the usual phase @xmath20 of the ckm mixing matrix .",
    "with the usual assumption that these susy phases vanish identically at the unification scale because of cp conservation in the susy breaking sector , it is claimed @xcite that the mssm predictions for @xmath9 mixing and penguin decays such as @xmath21 are very similar to those of the sm and that non - minimal susy models are needed to obtain any significant non - sm effects .",
    "an early study @xcite concluded that superpenguins are small compared to ordinary penguins unless the gluino is very light ( @xmath22 gev ) and satisfies @xmath23 . recently",
    "grossman and worah @xcite have found that the gluonic penguin amplitudes for @xmath24 and @xmath25 in the effective susy model of cohen _ et al _ @xcite can be up to twice as large as the sm gluonic penguins and with an unknown phase .    in this paper",

    "so we review in some detail the sm predictions with particular reference to the relative contributions of the internal @xmath26 , @xmath27 and @xmath28 quarks to the gluon penguin @xcite , the relative magnitudes of the various form factors and the role of the strong and weak phases @xcite .",
    "we find , for example , that the cp violating phases for the @xmath29 and @xmath30 electric form factors , which dominate the decay amplitude , have no simple relationship with any angle of the unitarity triangle .",
    "for the mssm we explore the allowed regions of the parameter space to locate those regions which give the largest modifications to the sm results .",
    "in contrast to the sm , we always find the magnetic amplitude to dominate the electric amplitude .",
    "also , there are large regions of the mssm parameter space for which the magnetic amplitude is greater than that of the sm .",

    "we have calculated , from first principles , both the sm and mssm penguins that contribute to the decays of the @xmath0 and @xmath129 quarks . for the mssm",
    "in particular there are discrepancies to be found in the literature @xcite as to the correct formulae for the @xmath297 form factors .",
    "our results for these form factors differ slightly from those of @xcite but our other results agree with @xcite .    because of the presence of strong phases in the contributions to the sm penguin amplitudes from @xmath26 and @xmath27 quarks we find that the decay rates for @xmath119 is significantly different to the rate @xmath298 even for quarks in isolation ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) .    the susy enhancement of the gluon - mediated exclusive hadronic @xmath0 decays within the constrained mssm model can be at the several percent level in certain regions of the @xmath299 parameter space .",
    "in these regions the susy penguin processes dominate the susy box processes with the consequence that the @xmath0 decays in the mssm are driven by the magnetic dipole transition rather than the electric dipole transition of the sm .",
    "qcd corrections arising from renormalisation of the present short distance results down from the electroweak scale to the scale @xmath15 are not likely to alter the finding that the magnetic amplitude is dominant in the mssm as the qcd induced mixing effects @xcite produce an enhancement of the magnetic dipole operators in the @xmath300 effective hamiltonian relative to the current - current penguin operators associated with the electric dipole amplitude .",
    "furthermore , grard and hou @xcite have noted that the result ( [ b19 ] ) for the sm form factor @xmath98 already contains the dominant part of the qcd corrections for the current - current penguin operators and , therefore , that the main effects of qcd corrections will be the renormalisation of the strong coupling constant from @xmath301 to @xmath302 .",
    "this would have the effect of increasing the penguin decay rates of the sm by the factor @xmath303 and also increasing the mssm penguin amplitudes relative to those of the sm .",
    "detection of new physics in the hadronic decay amplitudes of the @xmath0 quark through a study of deviations from the predictions of the sm in the patterns of cp violation in @xmath304 decays is complicated , on the one hand by the interplay between the cumulative effects in the sm of the @xmath75-dependent strong phases in @xmath3 and the weak ckm phases from the contributing @xmath305 and @xmath28 quarks and , on the other hand , by mssm phases comparable in magnitude to the sm weak phases and which can give constructive or destructive interference depending upon the details of the soft susy - breaking mechanism .",
