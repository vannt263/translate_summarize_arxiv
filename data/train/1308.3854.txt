    "our galaxy contains about @xmath7 @xmath8 of molecular gas @xcite , mostly in the form of giant molecular clouds that can be as massive as @xmath9 @xmath8 , and have jeans mass of several @xmath10s to @xmath11 @xmath8 .",
    "therefore , cloud complexes should be highly gravitationally unstable , and if collapsing on free - fall time scales would result in a star formation rate of @xmath12 @xmath13 @xcite .",
    "however , the observed star formation rate of @xmath14 @xmath8 @xmath13 @xcite in our galaxy shows that the gravitational collapse time of these clouds must significantly exceed the free - fall time . among the possible physical mechanisms of support against gravitational collapse in molecular clouds , interstellar magnetic fields and turbulence",
    "have been the most debated ones .",
    "the interplay between these mechanisms has led to studying the combination of the two as one physical phenomenon ( e.g. , ) .",
    "the study of magnetized turbulence in molecular clouds through the comparison of the line - widths of spectral line profiles of molecular ion and neutral species assumed to be coexistent ( mainly the hcn / hco@xmath15 and h@xmath16cn / h@xmath16co@xmath15 pairs ) started with the work of houde et al . @xcite .",
    "the conditions satisfying this assumption mainly include high correlation of the intensity maps of the two species , no sign of depletion of either of the tracers , and also the one to one correspondence of peak velocities of the spectral line profiles across the maps .",
    "houde et al .",
    "@xcite introduced a model for turbulence in a weakly ionized gas in the presence of a magnetic field and discussed how in small enough scales where motions of the local turbulent flow could be assumed linear , the ions would get trapped into gyromagnetic motion about the magnetic field rather than following the general neutral flow .",
    "it was shown that emission lines from an ion species will exhibit narrower profiles compared to that of a coexistent neutral species in regions with a magnetic field of a few tens of @xmath17 g that is on average not aligned with the local flows .",
    "houde et al .",
    "@xcite supported their model by detecting this ion line narrowing effect in the ( @xmath18 ) and ( @xmath19 ) transition lines of the hcn / hco@xmath15 and h@xmath16cn / h@xmath16co@xmath15 pairs of molecular species in several well - known molecular clouds .    in a more recent study , initiated a new observational technique based on recent simulations by @xcite and the work of houde et al .",
    "@xcite to better investigate the effect of magnetic fields on the relative widths of ion and neutral spectral line profiles .",
    "they used the observational data for hcn and @xmath20 ( @xmath19 ) emission maps in m17 ( @xcite ) , and plotted the velocity dispersions in the line profiles of the aforementioned species across the maps as a function of different beam sizes that translated into different spatial scales ( hereafter referred to as velocity dispersion spectrum ) . at every spatial scale ,",
    "a constant difference between the lower envelope of the velocity dispersion spectrum of the ion relative to that of the neutral was noted ( see figure 2 of , and also figures [ fig : sigma2-n03 ] and [ fig : sigma2_n53 ] of this work ) , which was interpreted as the ion and neutral flows dissipating their turbulent energy at different spatial scales . assuming that the turbulent energy dissipation process is associated with ambipolar diffusion and that the ion velocity dispersion spectrum drops drastically at ambipolar diffusion scales , they used a kolmogorov - type power law fit to their data to calculate the turbulent ambipolar diffusion length scale @xmath21 and the neutral velocity dispersion @xmath22 of a turbulent eddy at the corresponding length scale .",
    "more precisely , these parameters are obtained from the following equations @xmath23\\\\ v_{ad}^{2}(l_{ad } ) & = & a+bl_{ad}. \\end{array}\\label{eq : vl}\\ ] ]    here the parameters @xmath24 ( the spectral index ) , @xmath25 ( where @xmath26 ) , and @xmath27 are the fitting parameters in the power law equations for the velocity dispersion spectra of the ions ( @xmath28 ) and neutrals ( @xmath29 ) given by @xmath30    in order to calculate the strength of the magnetic field using the obtained parameters , started with the magnetic reynolds number    @xmath31    which is effectively the ratio of the importance of magnetic flux freezing to magnetic diffusivity at a given length scale . here",
    "@xmath32 and @xmath33 are characteristic length and velocity scales for a given reynolds number , respectively , @xmath34 is the ion density , @xmath35 and @xmath17 are the collision rate of an ion with the neutrals and the mean reduced mass characterizing such collisions , respectively .",
    "we assume the gas to be well coupled to the field lines at large scales and that the ion - neutral decoupling occurs at turbulent energy dissipation length scales .",
    "numerical simulations by @xcite have shown a range of reynolds numbers ( @xmath36 ) for which ambipolar diffusion effects become important in the clump morphology , the effect becoming more important as the reynolds number decreases .",
    "following , we assume that the decoupling scale @xmath37 corresponds to @xmath38 , where the magnetic diffusion overcomes the flux freezing , hence the onset of the decoupling of ions from neutrals .",
    "this choice of the @xmath39 value can introduce an uncertainty of a factor of a few in our calculations .",
    "we proceed to derive an equation for the field strength in the plane of the sky as a function of interstellar physical parameters by substituting @xmath38 , @xmath40 , where @xmath41 is the ionization fraction and @xmath42 the neutral volume density , @xmath43 s@xmath44 @xcite , and mean ion and neutral atomic mass numbers @xmath45 and @xmath46 , respectively . using typical parameters for giant molecular clouds ( gmcs ) ,",
    "we obtain    @xmath47    one concern regarding this technique was the fact that the spectral lines of hcn and hco@xmath15 usually appear to be optically thick and saturated . to investigate whether the constant difference between the velocity dispersion spectra of the ion and the neutral was consistent with similar observations using different species , @xcite tested the turbulent energy dissipation model of by mapping the optically thin isotopologues h@xmath16cn and h@xmath16co@xmath15 ( @xmath19 ) in dr21(oh ) .",
    "their analysis showed that the difference between the velocity dispersion of the h@xmath16cn and h@xmath16co@xmath15 spectral lines at different length scales displayed a similar result as originally obtained by with the optically thick hcn and hco@xmath15 lines .",
    "they concluded that the narrowing of ion lines relative to neutrals , which was first discussed by @xcite is a real physical effect and confirmed the results in the works of .    in this paper , we examine the interferometry data from the @xmath48 transition of h@xmath16cn and h@xmath16co@xmath15 in the cygnus x star forming region previously obtained and reduced by @xcite in order to test this technique at higher spatial resolutions , i.e. , at smaller physical scales .",
    "we present our observations in @xmath49 .",
    "the data analysis is explained and results are presented in @xmath50 , a discussion in @xmath51 and we end with a summary in @xmath52 .",
    "cygnus - x is a massive molecular cloud complex located at a distance of 1.4 kpc @xcite .",
    "the first continuum observations of this region were performed by @xcite , who used an infrared extinction map produced from 2mass data and selected the high column density ( @xmath53 mag ) clouds of cygnus - x and mapped them in 1.2 mm continuum emission using the iram 30-m telescope .",
    "@xcite followed up these studies by performing high - angular resolution continuum observations with the iram plateau de bure interferometer ( pdbi ) at 1.3 and 3.5 mm towards the six most massive and youngest ( ir - quiet ) dense cores ( mdcs ) in the complex .",
    "these mdcs are fragmented and are shown to host early phase massive protostars .",
    "their fragmentation properties have been discussed extensively by @xcite , where they propose that a mechanism of support against self gravity ( such as magnetic fields , turbulence , or radiative feedback ) additional to thermal pressure is required to explain the formation of massive protostars larger than the local jeans masses .",
    "the selected dense cores have sizes of about @xmath54 pc , average density of @xmath55 @xmath56 , and masses of @xmath57 @xmath8 .",
    "detection of sio emission in these sources confirms the presence of outflows , which suggests them to be actively forming stars @xcite .",
    "however , the lack of strong mid - ir and free - free emission indicates that they must be in an early stage of their evolution .",
    "@xcite mapped these selected cores in h@xmath16cn and h@xmath16co@xmath15 emission with the pdbi to study the kinematic properties of the dense gas surrounding the massive protostars .    for this work we required intensity maps of dense cores hosting protostellar objects in which h@xmath16co@xmath15 was not affected by co depletion or other chemical effects , causing significant differences in spatial distribution of the two tracers .",
    "the emission maps should also be sufficiently spatially extended while maintaining a high enough signal - to - noise ratio to provide enough number of pixels for a better statistical spectral line - width analysis explained in  1 . among the sources observed by @xcite , two",
    "had sufficiently extended and correlated ion and neutral emission maps and were therefore suitable for our analysis .",
    "these were cygx - n03 and cygx - n53 , located at ( @xmath58 ) and ( @xmath59 ) ( j2000 ) , respectively .",
    "cygx - n03 is located close to dr17 , an hii region , which is excited by two ob clusters @xcite while the latter is located in the dr21 filament , the most massive and densest region of cygnus - x and a well - known region of massive star formation @xcite .",
    "table [ ta : data ] summarizes some of the physical parameters in the aforementioned sources obtained from single dish observations @xcite .",
    "the observations were carried out with the pdbi at @xmath60 mm .",
    "the sources were mapped in h@xmath16cn ( @xmath2 ) and h@xmath16co@xmath15 ( @xmath2 ) at @xmath61 ghz and @xmath62 ghz , respectively , with a velocity resolution of @xmath63 km s@xmath44 .",
    "the observations were done in track - sharing mode with two targets per track .",
    "more details on the antennae setup and preliminary data reduction can be found in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "the data reduction and analysis of the interferometric data was performed with the gildas software .",
    "@xcite reduced the interferometric h@xmath16co@xmath15 dataset both with and without adding short - spacing information , which was obtained with the iram 30-m telescope .",
    "since no zero - spacing information was available for the h@xmath16cn dataset , the h@xmath16co@xmath15 maps were used without this short spacing correction for the purpose of a consistent dataset .",
    "the maps were corrected for primary beam attenuation and a natural weighting was used for the image reconstruction .",
    "the selected sources were observed in different tracks on different days , therefore the synthesized beam sizes are slightly different .",
    "the size of the synthesized beams in cygx - n03 were @xmath64 with a position angle of @xmath65 for both species and @xmath66 with a position angle of @xmath67 in cygx - n53 .",
    "the baselines ranged from 24 m to 229 m and the @xmath68 coverage was the same for h@xmath16co@xmath15 and h@xmath16cn in each source .",
    "the fraction of flux filtered out in the interferometry data for h@xmath16co@xmath15 was examined by comparing the integrated intensities in the single dish and pdbi spectra at the same offsets .",
    "the pdbi spectra contain 78@xmath69 and 72@xmath69 of the integrated intensity of single dish spectra in cygx - n03 and cygx - n53 , respectively .",
    "we also consider the implications of combining single - dish and interferometry data in section [ sec : sd ] .",
    "figure [ fig : maps_n03 ] shows the intensity maps of @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) in cygx - n03 , and the intensity maps of the same molecular pair in cygx - n53 are displayed in figure [ fig : maps_n53 ] .",
    "although the hco@xmath15 and hcn pair and their isotopologues are observed to have the highest large scale spatial correlation among other pairs of ions and neutrals @xcite , some differences between their distribution still exist , particularly at higher resolutions such as the observations we present here .",
    "the @xmath0 intensity maps include the integrated flux from all three hyperfine lines , where the intensities of the three components follow the ratios @xmath70 . however , in cygx - n53 the intensities of the @xmath0 hyperfine lines vary slightly from this ratio due to optical depth effects",
    ". this may be the cause for the difference in the location of peak intensities in the @xmath0 and @xmath1 maps in this source .",
    "the spectral line data for cygx - n53 have a lower signal - to - noise ratio than the spectra in cygx - n03 , and required a careful analysis for investigating the coexistence criteria of the observed ion and neutral species .    in order to check the consistency of our maps , we calculated the linear correlation coefficients for the pairs of maps across a @xmath71 area around the peak positions in cygx - n03 and cygx - n53 .",
    "we obtain correlation coefficients of 0.84 and 0.82 for the maps in cygx - n03 and cygx - n53 , respectively , to confirm that the maps correlate well within the regions in our analysis . as a more extensive test ,",
    "the peak velocities of the @xmath1 lines were compared to those of the central hyperfine component of @xmath0 across the maps for both sources .",
    "the correlation plots for the peak velocities of the two tracers in each source are presented in figure [ fig : v_cc ] .",
    "the plotted peak velocities correspond to spectral lines for which we obtained @xmath72 velocity dispersion values , i.e. , the data points we use for our analysis .",
    "the uncertainty values for the peak velocity measurements are included and a linear least squares fit to the data points yields y@xmath73x@xmath74 for cygx - n03 and y@xmath75x@xmath76 for cygx - n53 . the scatter plot for cygx - n53",
    "is affected by the lower data quality in this source .",
    "the fitting uncertainties do not take into account the velocity resolution of @xmath77 km s@xmath44 for our spectral lines , and the peak velocities are measured from the expected systemic velocity for the sources for a more meaningful estimate of the intercept .",
    "given the aforementioned uncertainties , these results are in general consistent with our assumption of @xmath1 and @xmath0 being coexistent in the two sources .",
    "the intensity maps are oversampled with beam spacings of @xmath78 , which is useful for our analysis .",
    "since the aim of this work is to characterize turbulence with spectral line profiles , in order to find the location of minimum turbulence level we must find the position of the spectral line with the narrowest line - width that corresponds to both species . following the technique introduced by @xcite and further tested by @xcite within the context of the method , we scan across the source with the finest resolution available by calculating the line - widths of spectral line profiles in every pixel of the map .    in each map , the velocity dispersions of the spectral line profiles are calculated within an area of @xmath79 around the central core , as specified by the black frames in figures [ fig : maps_n03 ] and [ fig : maps_n53 ] .",
    "the size of these enclosed areas were determined by the extent of the h@xmath16cn spectra with high enough signal - to - noise ratio that enabled comparison with @xmath1 spectra at corresponding positions . to mimic spectra at different beam sizes",
    ", we applied the technique in and @xcite in using a boxcar - like function to average the spectra of neighboring pixels in the regions restricted by the black frames across the intensity maps .",
    "more precisely , we started with a 110-pixel map for each tracer and each source at the actual beam resolution ( @xmath80 for cygx - n03 and @xmath81 for cygx - n53 ) .",
    "we then averaged every 4 neighboring pixels of the original map to reduce the map resolution to 30 pixels at @xmath82 for cygx - n03 and @xmath83 for cygx - n53 .",
    "we further averaged 9 and 16 neighboring pixels to produce 16- and 9-pixel maps with resolutions of @xmath84 and @xmath85 , respectively , for cygx - n03 and similar maps with resolutions of @xmath86 and @xmath87 , respectively , for cygx - n53 .",
    "we ran a gildas script on all the h@xmath16co@xmath15 and the central component of h@xmath16cn hyperfine spectral lines to fit three gaussian components to each line .",
    "the spectral lines that needed fewer than three components returned fitting results with zero - amplitude profiles ( with respect to the baseline ) for the extra components . this way , we obtained between 1 and 3 gaussian profiles for each spectral line .",
    "we calculated the integrated residual flux in the spectral lines using the aforementioned gaussian fits , and got an average value of @xmath88 mk , which compared to the rms noise level of @xmath89 mk is insignificant , thus confirming the reliability of our fits .",
    "the corresponding h@xmath16cn and @xmath1 lines do not necessarily have the same number of gaussian fits and were treated independently , and the overall velocity dispersion , @xmath90 , for a given line was calculated as the weighted average of the velocity dispersions of the gaussian components about the mean , the weights being the area under each gaussian profile .",
    "the plots of the square of the velocity dispersions ( @xmath91 ) as a function of length scale ( simulated beam sizes ) are shown in the top panels of figures [ fig : sigma2-n03 ] and [ fig : sigma2_n53 ] , with the @xmath0 data plotted in black and @xmath1 in red .",
    "the measurement uncertainties in these plots are only displayed in the lower panels for a clearer representation of the data points .",
    "the scatter of data points at each length scale above the lower envelopes is a reflection of the range of line - widths measured at that scale . according to equation ( [ eq : b ] ) ,",
    "the observed ambipolar diffusion scale length varies with @xmath92 ( thus a further dependency on the inclination angle of the field ) , the density , and the ionization rate . since the value of @xmath91 of the ion results from the integration of the turbulent spectrum from the ambipolar diffusion scale to that of the telescope beam",
    ", spatial variations in any of these parameters will strongly affect the width of the ion line , while leaving the neutral line unaffected ( i.e. , the neutral line - width is not dependent on the ambipolar diffusion scale ) . despite these facts",
    ", we note that the spectral lines of both species with the minimum @xmath93 values are found to be located in the same vicinity within the resolution of the original and also all smoothed maps , as shown in dashed circles in figures [ fig : maps_n03 ] and [ fig : maps_n53 ] , adding further support to the assumption of coexistence of @xmath0 and @xmath1 in our sources .",
    "figure [ fig : spectra ] displays the ion and neutral spectral lines at this location from the highest resolution maps for each source , where the @xmath1 spectra are plotted in red and @xmath0 in black . the latter is scaled to the temperature of @xmath1 for a better comparison of their corresponding line widths .",
    "the three resolved hyperfine lines of @xmath0 are clearly displayed , and the @xmath1 line - width is compared to that of the central component of @xmath0 at all offsets .      for a closer inspection",
    ", the kolmogorov - type power law fits to the lower envelopes of the ion and neutral velocity dispersion spectra are plotted together with the values of @xmath93 and their corresponding uncertainties at every length scale in the bottom panels of figures [ fig : sigma2-n03 ] and [ fig : sigma2_n53 ] . the ambipolar diffusion model of predicts the same power - law fit for both species in the inertial range .",
    "therefore , we first fitted the difference between the square of the velocity dispersion data of @xmath0 and @xmath1 to a constant function to obtain parameter @xmath25 , and then fitted the sum of the two data sets to a power law of the form @xmath94 to obtain @xmath27 and @xmath24 .",
    "the results for the fitting parameters in equation ( [ eq : sigmas ] ) for both sources are shown in table [ ta : data2 ] .",
    "a comparison between these parameters for the two sources shows that the difference between the lower envelopes of the ion and neutral @xmath93 spectra ( parameter @xmath25 ) in cygx - n53 is noticeably larger than that in cygx - n03 , while the spectral indices ( parameter @xmath24 ) are similar .",
    "this leads to a larger ambipolar diffusion scale @xmath95 mpc in cygx - n53 , compared to @xmath96 mpc in cygx - n03 .",
    "these values are consistent with the calculations of @xcite and in other star forming regions . assuming similar ionization fractions of @xmath97 @xcite and adopting the hydrogen number densities from @xcite ( see table [ ta : data ] ) , we calculate @xmath92 of @xmath5 mg and @xmath6 mg for cygx - n03 and cygx - n53 , respectively",
    ". this value can be inaccurate up to an order of magnitude due to the uncertainties in @xmath98 and @xmath99 , and the fact that equation ( [ eq : b ] ) is derived with the assumption of determining the turbulent ambipolar diffusion length scale where the effective magnetic reynolds number is @xmath100 , which is an approximation .",
    "it is worth noting that cygx - n53 is located @xmath101 north of dr21(oh ) , the source studied by @xcite .",
    "the analysis in dr21(oh ) was performed with the source distance taken to be 3 kpc @xcite , while for this work we took the new distance of 1.5 kpc obtained with trigonometric parallax measurements of @xcite . after applying the distance correction to the calculations for dr21(oh ) , the turbulent ambipolar diffusion scale becomes @xmath102 mpc , and we obtain a magnetic field of @xmath103 mg as opposed to the previous value of @xmath104 mg obtained earlier by @xcite .",
    "although the new field strength for dr21(oh ) is more consistent with the value for cygx - n53 given their location in a common filament ( dr21 ) , it also indicates another source of uncertainty in the ambipolar diffusion length and magnetic field measurements , i.e. , measurements of source distances .",
    "this is the first high resolution study on the determination of the turbulent ambipolar diffusion and magnetic field strength from the velocity dispersion spectra of a pair of coexistent interstellar ion and neutral molecules .",
    "an idealized situation for this study would consist of pointing the smallest available telescope beam at the appropriate location in a cloud and measuring the velocity dispersion through the observed spectral line profile , and then perform several subsequent observations at the same location but with a series of increasingly larger beams",
    ". it would be best if the subsequent beam sizes differed by a small amount , i.e. , smaller than a beam size , as this set of measurements would then allow one to finely build up the dispersion relation and determine the appropriate kolmogorov - type scaling law . in this work",
    ", this resolution is set by the sampling rate on our maps , which is about @xmath105 or approximately one - fifth of the telescope beam size .",
    "we effectively come as close as possible to achieve this once we find the location of minimum turbulence level with the finest grids .",
    "but since these locations are away from the centre of the maps and we are still limited by the signal - to - noise ratio of the spectra outside the aforementioned frames , we can not expand our analysis with a higher precision around these locations .",
    "the fact that we do not possess a large range of scales , say over several beam sizes , is admittedly a limitation in our analysis as it restricts the domain over which we can characterize turbulence with a kolmogorov - type law .",
    "it is , however , well - suited to determine the turbulent ambipolar diffusion decoupling scale in these cores .",
    "this is especially relevant since the highest resolution observations performed in this study were realized with a telescope beam size closest to the expected range for the turbulent ambipolar diffusion length scale , when compared to previous studies .    across the intensity maps ,",
    "pixels with higher intensity are likely to be locations with longer lines of sight through the cloud , where turbulent sub - structures ( or eddies ) of larger sizes can exist @xcite , which will in turn lead to broader spectral lines ( i.e. , larger velocity dispersions ) . in other words , the different lines of sight",
    "intercept several turbulent substructures of different velocities , causing an increase in the observed velocity dispersions .",
    "therefore , the unique minimum values that we calculate for @xmath93 at every length scale may be attributed to the line of sight that intercepts the fewest number of such turbulent sub - structures @xcite .",
    "it is important to realize that the measured line - widths change significantly over even a fraction of the beam extent .",
    "for example , at the smallest beam size of @xmath106 , velocity dispersion values vary from 0.75 km s@xmath44 to 2.71 km s@xmath44 across ten consecutive pixels ( similar size of @xmath106 ) for cygx - n03 in h@xmath16cn , therefore the overlapping beams in our oversampled map do not cause redundancy in our calculations .",
    "we point out the recent discovery of a hyperfine structure in @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) in the form of a doublet splitting of 0.133 km s@xmath44 by @xcite .",
    "this unresolved splitting contributes to the overall line - width we calculate for every @xmath1 line .",
    "however , despite this un - resolved splitting , the line profiles of @xmath1 were found to be narrower than those of @xmath0 across the intensity maps providing further support to the idea of the ion line narrowing effect due to the presence of magnetic fields .",
    "it is possible to compare the magnetic energy with the gravitational and kinetic energies when the full strength of the magnetic field is measured in a source . in this study",
    "we only measure the plane - of - the - sky component of the field , so we apply the less precise approach of estimating the full field strength using statistical expectation values of @xmath107 and @xmath108 for any random orientation of the b - field @xcite . of course , these are only probable values and do not necessarily apply to an individual core but",
    "since our calculations are accurate within a factor of a few , and given the uncertainties in the derived size and mass of these sources , we can nevertheless perform an approximate energy comparison in the observed sources .",
    "table [ ta : data3 ] summarizes the estimates for the ratio of mass to the magnetic flux ratio @xmath109 @xmath110 @xmath17 g , in units of the critical value @xmath111 @xcite , which is a measure of the relative importance of gravitational to magnetic energy .",
    "the ratio of the magnetic to kinetic energies is also calculated for each source as @xcite @xmath112 where the cores are assumed to be spherical with @xmath113 the mass , @xmath114 the size , and @xmath90 the observed one dimensional velocity dispersion ( taken from @xcite ) .",
    "we calculated @xmath113 and @xmath115 using the number densities from @xcite and taking @xmath116 as inferred from our figures [ fig : maps_n03 ] and [ fig : maps_n53 ] .",
    "the results in table [ ta : data3 ] imply that both sources are magnetically supercritical ( @xmath117 ) , i.e. gravitationally unstable , and there is an equipartition of the kinetic and magnetic energies in cygx - n03 while the magnetic energy dominates the kinetic energy in cygx - n53 .",
    "given the different fragmentation properties of the two cores @xcite , it is possible that magnetic fields play a more important role in the fragmentation of cygx - n53 compared to cygx - n03 .",
    "our magnetic field measurements alone are consistent with the findings of @xcite and @xcite in that cygx - n53 exhibits a higher core fragmentation efficiency than cygx - n03 as we measure a stronger field in the former source .",
    "although our sources are known to have similar masses @xcite , cygx - n03 exhibits a smaller turbulent ambipolar diffusion length scale and a weaker @xmath92 strength compared to cygx - n53 . as a further study ,",
    "the line - of - sight component of the magnetic field in these sources can be obtained through zeeman observations to clarify whether it is the difference in the orientation of the field or in the total strength of the magnetic field that sets the distinction in the observed cores .",
    "currently , zeeman measurements on cn ( @xmath2 ) in the aforementioned sources are underway , and the forthcoming results will be published in a future paper .      the extended molecular emission is spatially filtered out in the interferometry observations , therefore the larger scale turbulence is missing from the line profiles . since we are looking for the location of minimum turbulence , i.e. , the spectra with the narrowest line - widths , this flux filtering in principle should not hurt our analysis .",
    "moreover , referring to figure 3 of , it can be noted that the measured velocity dispersion at any scale is the integral of the power spectrum from the beam scale to the diffusion scale in the @xmath118 space .",
    "it follows that if interferometry observations would only filter out the large scale components of the turbulent spectrum , then one would naively expect that line widths confined to the unfiltered portion of the spectrum would be unaffected whether or not single - dish observations were included .",
    "but the large - scale flux filtering also implies a reduction of the depth into the cloud that is probed by the observations .",
    "interferometric observations to which single - dish data are added should therefore be expected to yield larger line widths for a given spatial scale ( i.e. , beam size ) , which would manifest themselves , for example , through an increased value for parameter @xmath27 in equation ( [ eq : vl ] ) . in other words ,",
    "single - dish observations will probe more turbulent sub - structures deeper in the gas probed by the telescope beam than corresponding interferometric measurements @xcite ; this also implies that the two types of measurements will not probe exactly the same volume of gas ( and medium ) .    on the one hand",
    ", if the nature of the turbulence is unchanged with depth in the gas , then we would expect that it preserves its logarithmic index @xmath24 when single - dish data are added .",
    "since this implies that the shape of the turbulent spectrum is preserved then the @xmath25 and @xmath27 parameters would be scaled up by the same factor , as they both result from integrations of the turbulent power spectrum .",
    "we would then find that the ambipolar diffusion scale @xmath21 would also remain unchanged ( see equation ( [ eq : vl ] ) ) , while the estimate for the magnetic field strength in equation ( [ eq : b ] ) would increase with the square - root of the factor by which @xmath25 and @xmath27 are scaled up ( through @xmath22 in equation ( [ eq : vl ] ) ) .",
    "on the other hand , the picture is not so clear when the nature of turbulence changes with depth in the cloud .",
    "although we expect both @xmath25 and @xmath27 to be larger , it can not generally be assumed that they will increase with the same factor .",
    "it is , however , safe to surmise that both the logarithmic slope @xmath24 and the ambipolar diffusion scale @xmath21 will vary and observationally reveal values intermediate to those that would be measured with interferometric and single - dish data independently .",
    "we tested the above arguments using h@xmath16co@xmath119 maps of combined single - dish and interferometric data of @xcite and we found that for both sources the line widths increase significantly , as expected . in the case of cygx - n03",
    "we found that @xmath120 km@xmath121 s@xmath122 arcsec@xmath123 ( compared to @xmath124 km@xmath121 s@xmath122 arcsec@xmath123 for interferometry data alone ) and @xmath125 ( basically unchanged from @xmath126 ) .",
    "these results are therefore in line with the discussion above when the nature of turbulence is unchanged with depth in the cloud .",
    "it also implies from equation ( [ eq : b ] ) that the magnetic field strength resulting from the inclusion of single - dish data would increase by a factor of @xmath127 ; this is not an unreasonable change in view of the general expectation that magnetic field strengths increase with density .",
    "interestingly for cygx - n53 , it is @xmath27 that is almost unchanged with the inclusion of single - dish data ( 0.25 km@xmath121 s@xmath122 arcsec@xmath123 instead of 0.24 km@xmath121 s@xmath122 arcsec@xmath123 ) , while the logarithmic slope @xmath24 varies significantly from the previous value of @xmath128 to @xmath129 .",
    "it is therefore apparent that for this source turbulence exhibits different characteristics with depth in the cloud .",
    "unfortunately , the lack of single - dish data for h@xmath16cn does not allow us to determine a corresponding value for @xmath25 and we therefore can not estimate the ambipolar diffusion scale or the magnetic field strength in this case .",
    "it is interesting to note that current anisotropic mhd turbulence models ( @xcite ) all predict longer correlation length scales along the magnetic field than across it .",
    "additionally , @xcite investigated velocity anisotropy induced by mhd turbulence in the taurus molecular cloud using computational simulations and molecular line observations .",
    "indeed , they measured a velocity anisotropy aligned within @xmath130 of the mean magnetic field orientation obtained from optical polarization measurements .",
    "it is expected that ( ambipolar ) diffusion length scales would follow a similar pattern as they are also related to the width of correlation functions .",
    "assuming the physical conditions in the two sources to be the same , our measurements of a shorter dissipation scale in cygx - n03 might then be another indication that its magnetic field tends to align itself closer to the line of sight than that of cygx - n53 ( for a given field strength ) .",
    "recent mhd simulations using the heavy - ion approximation @xcite performed at different reynolds numbers by @xcite find that their numerical simulations for the ion turbulent spectrum do not fall off as steeply as assumed by .",
    "however , even if that were the case , we expect that our determination of the turbulent ambipolar dissipation scale using the model of will still be a characteristic length scale representative of the spectral dissipation range . as a result ,",
    "future interferometry observations at higher resolutions will be crucial in probing sub - arc second scales , which will in turn enable us to investigate the behavior of the ion and neutral velocity dispersion spectra at the decoupling length scales .",
    "the coexistence of hco@xmath119 and hcn ( not including their isotopologues ) was recently investigated for different spatial scales and core central densities using chemical and dynamical models of evolving prestellar molecular cloud cores including non - equilibrium chemistry and magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "it was shown that the abundances of the two species were indeed well correlated on large scales (  1 pc ) but the correlation was weaker for sub - parsec scales .",
    "additionally , @xcite predicted new ion - neutral pairs that are good candidates for such observations because they reveal similar evolutionary trends and are approximately co - spatial in their models .",
    "these candidate pairs include hco@xmath15/no , hco@xmath15/co , and no@xmath15/no .",
    "further observations are needed to test these chemical models and will especially help investigate the nitrogen - driven chemistry in the ism .      in this section",
    "we note the limitations of this study in certain star forming regions , in particular dense cores in which the selected ion and neutral species do not show a sign of coexistence .",
    "this can occur in sources with significant depletion of co and its isotopologues , as a result of which species such as @xmath20 and @xmath1 will trace the envelopes while @xmath131 and @xmath0 stay close to the inner ( colder and denser ) part of the cores .",
    "moreover , star forming regions are usually associated with molecular outflows that are revealed with far - infrared observations .",
    "outflows leave their signature as high velocity wings on spectral line profiles . in the context of ambipolar diffusion , the effect of outflows on the relative line widths of the observed ion and neutral spectra has been discussed in some of the early papers on the subject ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "while hcn often traces outflows preferentially over @xmath20 ( e.g. , @xcite ) , there also exists examples where the line profiles of both species appear to be equally affected ( see for example the case of ngc 2071 in @xcite ) .",
    "although we can not be completely certain of this , given the spectra presented in our figure [ fig : spectra ] we believe it is reasonable to assume that outflows do not play an important role in explaining the differences in line widths .",
    "perhaps the best indication for this assertion is our result that the turbulent power spectra for both molecular species can be modelled with the same values for @xmath27 and @xmath24 .",
    "such results would be unlikely if that were not the case .",
    "we also note that recent observations of @xmath132co(@xmath133 ) with the pdbi in both cygx - n03 and cygx - n53 reveal bipolar molecular outflows @xcite , which were not seen earlier with @xmath0 and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) .",
    "since the outflow signature in our interferometry dataset was inconspicuous , we did not apply any correction for its effect .",
    "we analyzed interferometric maps of @xmath0 ( @xmath2 ) and @xmath1 ( @xmath2 ) in cygx - n03 and cygx - n53 , two dense cores in the cygnus - x star forming region , as a further test for the turbulent energy dissipation model of .",
    "a constant difference between the ion and neutral velocity dispersion spectra is observed in both sources ( figures [ fig : sigma2-n03 ] and [ fig : sigma2_n53 ] ) , and the turbulent ambipolar diffusion scale and plane - of - the - sky magnetic field strengths are calculated .",
    "although the magnetic field strengths are uncertain up to an order of magnitude , we can still address the issue of additional support for these mdcs , previously raised by @xcite .",
    "we conclude that magnetic fields and turbulent motions are equally important in the fragmentation of cygx - n03 , while the higher core fragmentation efficiency in cygx - n53 previously measured by @xcite is consistent with a stronger magnetic field dominating the turbulent motions in this core .",
