    "the study of the individual dust - obscured sources that make the extragalactic infrared ( ir ) background @xcite has made enormous progress over the last decade , since the launch of the _ spitzer space telescope _",
    "@xcite , and successively the _ akari telescope _ @xcite and the _ herschel space observatory _ @xcite . in particular , the scientific output of these missions has revealed the importance of powerful , dust - obscured star - formation and nuclear activity in shaping galaxy evolution at high redshifts ( @xmath0 ) .",
    "this activity was dominated by luminous and ultra - luminous infrared galaxies ( lirgs and ulirgs ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , which had a main role in the global star formation history of the universe ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the process of massive galaxy buildup at @xmath0 @xcite .",
    "the availability of multi - wavelength ancillary data from deep galaxy surveys has been crucial to investigate the presence and properties of ir galaxies at high @xmath13 .",
    "most redshift estimates and the derivation of other parameters , such as the galaxy stellar mass , rely on the fitting of spectral energy distribution ( sed ) templates to broad - band photometry that traces the galaxy rest uv / optical and near - ir light ( @xmath14 $ \\sim$}}~}3 \\ , \\rm \\mu m$ ] ) .",
    "the derivation of reliable values for these galaxy parameters requires a proper wavelength coverage of the photometric data , and also considering the possible variations that the galaxy seds may have , through the choice of sufficiently representative galaxy templates , and the analysis of departures of these seds from models of pure stellar evolution .",
    "a long - standing problem regarding the composition of the extragalactic ir background is understanding to which extent dust - obscured active galactic nuclei ( agn ) are part of the ir galaxy population at high redshifts . a direct way to reveal nuclear activity is searching for x - ray detections ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but dust - obscured agn can remain undetected even in typically deep x - ray maps .",
    "spectral line diagnostics at optical and ir wavelengths are also useful to recognise agn , but they are usually limited to relatively small samples of bright ir sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "an alternative method that has proven to be quite efficient to reveal agn in large samples of dust - obscured galaxies is the use of mid - ir colour - colour diagrams @xcite , based on photometry at @xmath15 , taken with the _ spitzer _ infrared array camera ( irac ; * ? ? ?",
    "the segregated locus that some agn occupy in these diagrams is related to the fact that pure agn seds are characterised by a power - law shape at rest - frame optical / near - ir wavelengths .",
    "in fact , the presence of a pure irac power - law sed has been proposed by some authors as a criterion to select agn - dominated galaxies among _ spitzer _ @xmath4 and irac - selected sources @xcite .",
    "but agn selection through irac colour - colour diagrams has well - known limitations : it is complete only for bright ir sources ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , and the resulting samples are typically contaminated by star - forming galaxies @xcite .",
    "this is especially the case at high redshifts , as the galaxy stellar emission is shifted into the irac bands , producing similar irac colours to those of agn at lower redshifts .",
    "in addition to the identification , there is a second problem , which consists in understanding what fraction of the galaxy light is due to the agn component at different wavelengths . at mid- and far - ir wavelengths ( @xmath16 $ \\sim$}}~}\\lambda_{\\rm rest } { \\raisebox{-0.13cm}{~\\shortstack{$<$ \\\\[-0.07 cm ] $ \\sim$}}~}1000 \\ , \\rm \\mu m$ ] ) , disentangling the star - formation / agn contributions is required to properly derive the on - going , obscured star formation rates in ir galaxies .",
    "this issue has been tackled in different studies of lirgs and ulirgs at high @xmath13 , by analysing mid - ir spectroscopic data , or mid-/far - ir broad - band data ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    ") , a power - law component associated with an agn distorts the light of the underlying stellar populations in the host galaxy , and may affect the derived galaxy stellar mass . for galaxies that are identified with x - ray luminous agn , the sed fitting with stellar templates , and derivation of stellar masses are usually avoided ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , or attempted only after subtracting empirical agn templates ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) . in all other cases",
    ", however , the derivation of stellar masses is of common practice , even when there is the suspicion that the rest - frame near - ir light could be partly contaminated by an agn component ( for example , in the case of an irac - band excess in the galaxy sed ) .",
    "quantifying the importance of this effect in ir - selected galaxies is then necessary to understand the reliability of the derived host galaxy properties .    in this work",

    "hereafter , i will refer to these galaxies as _ power - law - component galaxies _ ( plcgs ) .",
    "note that this criterion is more relaxed than the irac power - law shape imposed by other authors to select potential ir agn candidates @xcite , and therefore , the sample analysed here should also include galaxies for which the agn emission is less dominant over the underlying host galaxy light .",

    "the final sample contains 174 @xmath4 sources with @xmath2 , with similar numbers of galaxies at @xmath8 and @xmath26 ( 89 and 85 sources , respectively ) .    restricting the sed study only to galaxies with secure spectroscopic redshifts ensures that all the results and conclusions in this paper are free from the uncertainties that are usually introduced by photometric redshift determinations at high redshifts . on the other hand ,",

    "the finally compiled catalogue includes photometry in 11 bands : @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , @xmath13 , @xmath37 , @xmath38 , @xmath39 , [ 3.6 ] , [ 4.5 ] , [ 5.8 ] and [ 8.0 ] .",
    "all the magnitudes in this catalogue are total and have been corrected for galactic extinction . to obtain total magnitudes , i considered aperture magnitudes in circles of 4-arcsec ( irac ) and 2-arcsec",

    "i considered that the flux density @xmath41 of each galaxy at observed wavelengths @xmath42 can be decomposed as :    @xmath43    where the two terms on the right - hand side correspond to a stellar component and a power - law component with spectral index @xmath44 , respectively .",
    "the power - law term is normalised to the @xmath45 flux density , so the constant @xmath46 can vary between 0 and 1 .",

    "i performed the sed modelling on the 31 photometric sets @xmath48 of each galaxy , using a customised @xmath55-minimisation sed - fitting code that incorporates the 2007 version of the bruzual & charlot synthetic stellar template library , with solar metallicity @xcite .",
    "these templates correspond to different star formation histories : a single stellar population , and different exponentially - declining star - formation histories with @xmath56 through 5  gyr . in all cases ,",

    "stellar masses are obtained in the output of the same sed - fitting code .",
    "the technique is illustrated in figure  [ fig_exam ] : once a power - law component is subtracted from the original photometry ( open circles ) , a new photometric dataset is obtained ( filled circles ) . for each galaxy ,",

    "the points lying on the identity line correspond to galaxies for which the original photometry , without a power - law subtraction , produces the absolutely best fitting .",
    "the points below the identity line indicate the galaxies for which the sed fitting with stellar templates improves after the subtraction of a power - law component .",
    "this is the case for the majority of the @xmath4 galaxies . in particular , in 60 out of 174 cases ( 35% ) , the best sed - fitting solution on the original photometry , without a power - law subtraction , can be rejected with @xmath58 confidence .",
    "these 60 galaxies are , according to my definition , the plcgs in the @xmath4 sample with @xmath2 .",
    "interestingly , around two - thirds of the plcgs ( 42 out of 60 ) lie at @xmath59 ( fig .  [ fig_plcgstfmz ] ) .",
    "this implies that @xmath60 of all the lirgs and ulirgs at @xmath8 are plcgs , i.e. they have a significant power - law component in their rest - frame near - ir seds .",
    "the percentage of plcgs at @xmath61 is much higher than the known percentage of agn among lirgs and ulirgs at these redshifts , and raises the question of whether the power - law component is actually related to an agn presence in all these cases .",
    "i investigate this issue further in section ",
    "[ sec - nature ] . at @xmath62 , instead , the fraction of plcgs among @xmath4 galaxies ( the vast majority of which are ulirgs ) is of only @xmath63 .",

    "the best - fitting star formation histories correspond to single stellar populations or @xmath65 models with @xmath66 in @xmath7 of cases .",
    "after the power - law subtraction , these models provide the best fitting for 93% of the plcgs .",
    "the best - fitting extinction values for plcgs ( before power - law subtraction ) and non - plcgs are also very similar : the median and r.m.s . of the distributions are @xmath67 and @xmath68 , respectively . after power - law subtraction ,",

    "the non - plcgs are also shown as a reference .",
    "a bit more than a half of the plcgs ( 55% ) are characterised by a power - law component with @xmath71 , while the remaining plcgs have lower best - fitting power - law indices , i.e. @xmath3 or 2 .",
    "these indices are related to the temperature of the hot - dust component in the galaxy , which is higher for lower @xmath44 values ( cf .",
    "section  [ sec - gbtemp ] ) .",
    "the effect of a decrease in the best - fitting @xmath70 value is especially evident for the @xmath3 plcgs : a shallow power - law component can mimic the effect of additional reddening .",
    "after power - law subtraction , the majority of the @xmath3 and @xmath72 plcgs have @xmath73 , while most of the @xmath71 plcgs have @xmath74 .",
    "the normalisation factor of the power - law component is @xmath75 for virtually all the plcgs , which means that at least 50% of the @xmath45 flux density is in the power - law component . for around a half of the plcgs ,",
    "this contribution is @xmath76 .",
    "this confirms that the plcg definition adopted here , based on the @xmath58 improvement of the sed fitting , truly selects sources for which the power - law component makes an important contribution to the rest - frame near - ir light of the galaxy .",
    "for galaxies at @xmath77 , the emission from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ( pahs ) at rest @xmath78 will enter the observed @xmath45 band .",
    "although this is a relatively faint pah emission feature , it can potentially mimic the effect of a steep power - law component in the galaxy sed . to assess the importance of this effect on the plcg selection ,",
    "i have performed the sed fitting on additional photometric sets for each galaxy , with power - law subtractions corresponding to larger spectral indices , namely , @xmath79 and @xmath80 . within the total sample ,",
    "only 13 galaxies appear to be plcgs with such large best - fitting spectral index .",
    "however , their redshifts are not concentrated around @xmath77 or any other specific redshift , so the steeper @xmath44 values are unlikely the effect of emission features .",
    "in fact , 11 out of these 13 galaxies have been recognised as plcgs with @xmath71 in my original analysis .",
    "only two galaxies appear as new plcgs : one at @xmath81 ( corresponding to an x - ray luminous agn ) , and another one at @xmath82 ( for which the @xmath83 pah emission could be partly within the @xmath45-filter wavelength coverage ) .",
    "these results indicate that : a ) the @xmath83 pah emission plays a minor role in the overall ir sed for most ir galaxies ; b ) considering @xmath84 values for the power - law subtraction produces a virtually negligible effect on the identified plcg sample .    to investigate whether the high fraction of plcgs is truly a characteristic of the @xmath4 galaxy sample , i performed a similar sed fitting analysis on a control sample of 247 galaxies selected from the irac catalogue described in section  [ sec - sample ] , also with secure @xmath2 , but which are not @xmath4-detected ( i.e. @xmath85 ) .",
    "these galaxies have been selected to have a similar stellar mass distribution as the @xmath4 galaxies ( @xmath86 $ \\sim$}}~}10^{10 } \\ , \\rm m_\\odot$ ] , based on the sed modelling of the original photometry ) .",
    "for each of these galaxies , i have produced 31 sets of photometric variations in the same manner explained above , and fitted the resulting seds with stellar templates in all cases .",
    "the comparison of minimum @xmath55 values with and without power - law subtraction is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig_chicon ] .    for the control sample ,",
    "the percentage of galaxies that significantly improve their sed fitting with stellar templates after a power - law subtraction is a factor of two smaller than for the @xmath4 galaxies : a pure stellar sed fitting can be discarded with @xmath58 confidence in only 18% of cases ( 44 out of 247 galaxies ) .",
    "these 44 plcgs in the control sample have best - fitting @xmath44 values shared in similar proportions as for the @xmath4-detected plcgs : 50% have best - fitting @xmath71 , while the other 50% have @xmath3 or 2 .",
    "these results obtained on the control sample indicate that the incidence of plcgs among mid - ir - selected galaxies is twice more important than among other similarly massive galaxies at @xmath0 .",
    "figure [ fig_stmratio ] shows the distribution of corrected - to - original stellar mass ratios for the 60 @xmath4-selected plcgs , classified according to their best - fitting power - law index .",
    "the corrected stellar masses are those derived from the sed modelling with stellar templates after the best - fitting power - law subtraction .",
    "the inspection of these distributions shows that the correction on the stellar masses is non - trivial : the exact correction needs to be derived on a case - by - case basis .",
    "however , for @xmath8780% ( 90% ) of the plcgs the correction is within a factor of @xmath88 ( 2.0 ) .",
    "the widest correction - factor distributions are those corresponding to power - law spectral indices @xmath3 and 2 , for which the stellar mass ratios range between @xmath89 $ \\sim$}}~}0.1 $ ] and @xmath90 .",
    "the median values of these stellar mass ratios are 0.67 and 0.85 , respectively .",
    "the corrections on the stellar masses are the smallest for the case @xmath71 ( the median of the ratio distribution is 0.92 ) .",
    "this behaviour is expected , as the subtraction of such a steep power - law has a rapidly declining effect on the photometry at wavelengths shorter than @xmath45 , i.e the overall sed shape is not substantially modified except for a single photometric point .",
    "it may a priori seem surprising that the sed fitting for some galaxies yields _ larger _ stellar masses after the pl subtraction .",
    "this effect is produced because the best - fitting stellar template properties ( star formation history , age and extinction ) are usually different for the pl - subtracted photometry to those for the original photometry , and , in some cases , the resulting overall normalisation factors ( i.e. mass - to - light ratios ) are larger .    for 5 out of the 60 plcgs , all with best - fitting @xmath3 , the corrected stellar mass is less than @xmath91 of the stellar mass derived from the original photometry .",
    "these cases correspond to `` pure power - law sources '' , and all except one of them are identified as x - ray luminous agn with @xmath92 in the chandra 4  ms catalogue for the goods - s field @xcite .",
    "the only source that is not x - ray detected is the highest - redshift of these pure power - law sources , with @xmath93 and @xmath94 , so it is likely an intrinsically luminous agn as well .",
    "for these sources , a stellar mass calculation based on the original photometry should clearly be avoided .",
    "but , as said above , in all other cases the correction to the stellar mass is within a factor of two .",

    "this diagnostic is very useful to assess to which extent the plcg criterion can be used to identify agn in the general case that such deep x - ray catalogues are not available ( to date , x - ray maps of such a depth have only been obtained for the goods - s field ) .",

    "basically all corresponding to powerful agn , the correction to the stellar mass is so large that a stellar mass calculation based on the original photometry should clearly be avoided .",

    "but their plcg classification or x - ray luminosities do not correlate with the @xmath4 luminosities , so the x ray emission or the power - law sed excess is not simply a tracer of high star formation rates .    a stacking analysis of the plcgs that are not individually x - ray detected at @xmath8 reveals that they have on average similar properties as x - ray - detected normal galaxies",

    "this property , along with the regular morphologies , take to the direct conclusion that these sources must host an agn .",
    "one could speculate that the @xmath10 plcgs may all be on the way to form an agn as well , but this hypothesis can not be tested with the current data .",
    "considering that all the plcgs with @xmath3 or 2.0 in my sample contain agn , and adding all the other x - ray classified agn within my @xmath4 sample , i obtain that a total of 30% of the @xmath4 sources at @xmath8 host agn .",
    "this should be considered as a lower limit , as some of the @xmath10 plcgs that are not individually x - ray detected could also contain agn . if all of them had agn , that would give an upper limit of @xmath138 on the agn fraction among lirgs and ulirgs at @xmath8 . very recently , different works have concluded on a higher fraction of agn among ir galaxies than previously known at @xmath139 , obtaining percentages of 37 - 50% ( e.g. * ? ? ?",

    "a complete analysis of the applicability of this technique with the simultaneous determination of photometric redshifts ( @xmath141 ) will be presented in a future paper . a preliminary run of my sed fitting code leaving the redshift as a free parameter indicates that , in fact , the consideration of a power - law subtraction produces some improvement in the overall @xmath141-@xmath25 comparison , reducing the number of catastrophic outliers .",
    "this suggests that the identification of plcgs can be done , and the power - law subtraction is actually recommendable , when attempting a @xmath141 determination .",
    "although less straightforward than a simple irac colour - colour selection , the plcg identification criterion introduced here is much more complete to select agn of different luminosities , especially in the redshift range @xmath8 . keeping only those plcgs with spectral index @xmath3 and 2 should result in the best compromise between completeness and reliability , as most x - ray normal galaxies and x - ray non - detections are among the plcgs with @xmath71 . in the absence of very deep x - ray data ,",

    "<S> i present a generalized power - law diagnostic that allows to identify the presence of active galactic nuclei ( agn ) in infrared ( ir ) galaxies at @xmath0 , down to flux densities at which the extragalactic ir background is mostly resolved . </S>",
    "<S> i derive this diagnostic from the analysis of 174 galaxies with @xmath1 and spectroscopic redshifts @xmath2 in the chandra deep field south , for which i study the rest - frame uv / optical / near - ir spectral energy distributions ( seds ) , after subtracting a hot - dust , power - law component with three possible spectral indices @xmath3 , 2.0 and 3.0 . i obtain that 35% of these @xmath4 sources are power - law composite galaxies ( plcgs ) , which i define as those galaxies for which the sed fitting with stellar templates , without any previous power - law subtraction , can be rejected with @xmath5 confidence . subtracting the power - law component from the plcg </S>",
    "<S> seds produces stellar - mass correction factors @xmath6 in @xmath7 of cases . </S>",
    "<S> the plcg incidence is especially high ( 47% ) at @xmath8 . </S>",
    "<S> to unveil which plcgs host agn , i conduct a combined analysis of 4ms x - ray data , galaxy morphologies , and a greybody modelling of the hot dust . </S>",
    "<S> i find that : 1 ) 77% of all the x - ray agn in my @xmath4 sample at @xmath8 are recognised by the plcg criterion ; 2 ) plcgs with @xmath3 or 2.0 have regular morphologies and @xmath9 $ \\sim$}}~}1000 \\,\\rm k$ ] , indicating nuclear activity . </S>",
    "<S> instead , plcgs with @xmath10 are characterised by disturbed galaxy dynamics , and a hot interstellar medium can explain their dust temperatures @xmath11 . </S>",
    "<S> overall , my results indicate that the fraction of agn among @xmath4 sources is between @xmath1230% and 52% at @xmath8 . </S>"
