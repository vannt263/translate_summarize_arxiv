    "optically controlled semiconductor quantum dots ( qds ) are in many ways similar to atomic systems . in the recent years many quantum optics effects first demonstrated in atoms",
    "have been observed on individual qds .",
    "for instance , resonant optical pumping @xcite has been successfully used to prepare the spin of an individual electron @xcite , hole @xcite or magnetic atom @xcite localized in a qd . the possibility to use a strong resonant continuous wave laser field to create hybrid matter - field states @xcite and manipulate qds states in their solid environment has also been demonstrated in different qd systems @xcite .",
    "the autler - townes effect in the fine structure of a neutral or charged qd @xcite , the mollow absorption spectrum of an individual qd @xcite and the emission of an optically dressed exciton and biexciton complex @xcite have been reported . in magnetic qds containing an individual mn atom @xcite , it has been recently demonstrated that the energy of any spin state of a mn can be tuned using the optical stark effect induced by a strong laser field @xcite .",
    "we present here a new way to exploit this coupling with a resonant laser field to initialize the spin of a magnetic atom inserted in a self - assembled qd .",
    "when mn atoms are included in a ii - vi semiconductor self - assembled qd ( cdte in znte ) @xcite , the spin of the optically created electron - hole pair ( exciton ) interacts with the 5_d _ electrons of the mn ( total spin s=5/2 ) . in the case of a singly mn - doped qd ,",
    "this leads to a splitting of the once simple photoluminescence ( pl ) spectrum of an individual qd into six ( 2s+1 ) components @xcite .",
    "since the confined carriers and mn spin wave functions become strongly mixed , the optical excitation of the qd affects the spin state of the mn through the exchange interaction offering a possibility of optical control @xcite .",
    "the dynamics of the mn spin at zero magnetic field is mainly controlled by a magnetic anisotropy @xmath0 produced by the presence of large bi - axial strain at the mn location @xcite .",
    "this crystal field splits the spin states of the mn according to @xmath1 .",
    "we demonstrated recently the possibility to tune this fine structure using the optical stark effect @xcite . under strong resonant excitation of a mn - doped qd optical transition ,",
    "optically dressed states of the mn atom are created .",
    "the laser induced energy shift of the optically addressed spin state can be much larger than the fine structure splitting of the mn atom .",
    "the laser field can then be used to shift the energy of any spin state of the mn and control their degeneracy . here , we present experimental results showing that for particular conditions of laser detuning and intensity , the creation of optically dressed states in a mn - doped qd can lead to a new way to initialize the mn spin that we call _ spin population trapping_. we will also model and discuss the parameters that optimize this spin preparation .",
    "this paper is organized as follow : in section 2 we describe a new technique for the readout of the mn spin state based on a two - photon resonant excitation of an individual mn doped qd . in section 3",
    "we show how the resonant laser excitation on an exciton - mn ( x - mn ) level significantly modifies the mn spin dynamics .",
    "in addition to standard optical pumping expected for a resonant excitation , we show that the spin population can be trapped in the state which is resonantly excited . in section 4",
    "we present a model for the spin dynamics of an optically dressed mn atom and show that it qualitatively explains the experimental results .",
    "we demonstrate in particular that the mn dynamics in the resonant optical excitation regime is strongly affected by the strain anisotropy in the qd plane .",

    "the cdte dots are formed by a high temperature tellurium induced process @xcite and protected by a 300  nm thick znte top barrier .",
    "the qds are in the 10 nm wide range and a few nm high .",
    "mn atoms are introduced during the cdte deposition with a density roughly equal to the density of qds .",
    "non - magnetic qds and qds containing a low number ( 1 , 2 , ... ) of mn atoms are then formed .",
    "optical addressing of individual qds containing magnetic atoms is achieved using micro - spectroscopy techniques . a high refractive index hemispherical solid immersion lens is mounted on the surface of the sample to enhance the spatial resolution and the collection efficiency of single dot emission in a low - temperature ( @xmath3=5k ) scanning optical microscope @xcite .",

    "the exciton states are split by the exchange interaction with the mn spin whereas in the ground ( mn ) and biexciton ( x@xmath4-mn ) states the energy levels results from the fine and hyperfine structure of the mn spin .",
    "a direct resonant excitation of the biexciton is performed by a pulsed two - photon absorption through an intermediate virtual state whereas x - mn states a resonantly excited by a tunable cw laser.,width=240 ]    in order to observe the population repartition on the spin states of the mn under resonant optical excitation on a given x - mn level , we developed a technique allowing probing simultaneously the six spin states in the resonant optical excitation regime .",
    "the principle of this experiment is presented in fig .",
    "it is based on the creation of a biexciton by a two - photon absorption process under resonant pulsed excitation for the mn spin readout , combined with a continuous wave ( cw ) resonant excitation on x - mn for the mn spin preparation .",
    "a picosecond pulsed laser excitation tuned between the exciton and the biexciton levels can directly create a biexciton in a qd through a two - photon transition @xcite . as the biexciton is a spin singlet state ( 2 paired electrons and 2 paired holes ) , in a first approximation it does not interact with the mn spin @xcite .",
    "the population distribution on the six mn spin states is then extracted from the intensity of the pl lines of the biexciton which is controlled by x - mn in the final state of the biexciton recombination . as the emission of the biexciton",
    "is shifted by 10 to 14 mev below the resonant excitation on the x - mn levels , it can be easily separated from the scattered photons of the cw pumping laser .",
    "the resonant two - photon absorption scheme used here also avoids the injection of free carriers in the vicinity of the qd and consequently limits the spin relaxation of the mn by exchange coupling with these free carriers @xcite .",
    "let us note however that the cascade recombination of the biexciton leaves in the qd a maximum of one exciton every 13 ns ( repetition rate of the pulsed excitation ) .",
    "these excitons with a characteristic x - mn spin flip time of about 50ns @xcite may slightly perturb the mn spin preparation .",

    "we will see in the following that this _ spin population trapping _ is a specific signature of the coherent dynamics of the mn spin coupled with its nuclear spin and the resonant laser field .",
    "to model the influence of a resonant laser field on the spin dynamics of a mn atom embedded in a qd , we start from the analysis of the spin structure of a mn atom in a strained zinc - blend semiconductor matrix .",

    "when the dressed state of s@xmath13=+1/2 is on resonance with s@xmath13=+5/2 ( @xmath91 ) , the population is transferred to s@xmath13=+1/2 strongly coupled with s@xmath13=-1/2 , this is similar to the population trapping mechanism discussed in the case of an excitation on s@xmath13=+5/2 .",
    "the situation is more complex for an excitation on s@xmath13=+3/2 as the standard optical pumping and the population transfer to the optically dressed state can occur simultaneously .",
    "the dressed states of s@xmath13=+3/2 can be tuned on resonance with the state s@xmath13=+5/2 ( positive detuning ) or with the state s@xmath13=+1/2 ( negative detuning ) for small laser detuning where an efficient optical pumping can take place . for a small negative detuning ,",
    "an efficient transfer towards the dressed states of s@xmath13=+3/2 from s@xmath13=+1/2 and s@xmath13=-1/2 occurs via flip - flops with the nuclear spin .",
    "simultaneously , the optical pumping empties s@xmath13=+3/2 .",
    "this leads to a transfer of population from s@xmath13=+3/2 , s@xmath13=+1/2 and s@xmath13=-1/2 to s@xmath13=@xmath315/2 .",
    "this process involves electron nuclei flip - flops and it is expected to take place together with an optical pumping of the mn nuclear spin . for a positive detuning , a transfer of population occurs from s@xmath13=+5/2 to s@xmath13=+3/2 via flip - flops with the nuclear spin .",
    "the optical pumping tends to empty s@xmath13=+3/2 and the population is mainly transferred to s@xmath13=@xmath311/2 .",
    "the in - plane strain anisotropy @xmath29 plays a major role in the population trapping mechanism presented here .",
    "this is confirmed by the calculation displayed in fig .",
    "[ fig9](a ) . in the absence of in - plane strain anisotropy ( @xmath29=0 ) the population trapping disappears and the detuning dependence of the mn spin population is dominated by the standard optical spin pumping mechanism . a value of @xmath29 corresponding to a few percent of @xmath0 ( 5@xmath92 in the calculation presented in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) can explain the characteristic redistribution of population observed in the resonant excitation experiments .",
    "these calculated detuning dependence explain the non - trivial variation of intensities observed when scanning a cw laser across the overall x - mn spectrum .",
    "excitation on any mn spin state mainly affects the population of @xmath93 and @xmath94 and the detuning dependence of the mn spin population always deviates from the standard resonant optical pumping regime .",

    "the parameters used in the calculation are @xmath73 , @xmath74 , @xmath75 , @xmath76 , @xmath77 and e = 0.35@xmath97.,width=307 ]    since the population trapping relies on the coherent coupling between the mn spin states , one may wonder how to tune it in order to optimize the spin preparation .",
    "one way to control this coupling is by applying a small external magnetic field . as illustrated in fig .",
    "[ fig9](b ) a weak in - plane magnetic field induces coherent coupling among the mn spin states and enhances the population trapping .",
    "however , as already observed in optical pumping experiments @xcite , an equilibrium of the different s@xmath13 states population is restored when the in - plane magnetic field overcomes the magnetic anisotropy independently of the optical excitation conditions , in agreement with the experimental data presented in fig .",
    "[ fig3](c ) . in the present case ,",
    "the spin population trapping - and consequently the fidelity of the mn initialization - is maximum for a transverse magnetic field around 0.05 t.    in addition to the cw laser detuning , its power is another way to control the mn spin preparation . in the calculated excitation power dependence presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10](e ) , for a detuning between the pumping laser and the excited transition @xmath16 of @xmath79=-40@xmath11ev , even at low excitation intensity the optically dressed state is on resonance with s@xmath13=@xmath311/2 .",
    "the optical trapping regime already starts at very low excitation intensity . as the excitation intensity increases , the dressed state is shifted away from the s@xmath13=@xmath311/2 spin states and the population trapping disappears .",
    "a standard optical pumping of the state s@xmath13=+5/2 is restored .",
    "this non - monotonic evolution of the population of the resonantly excited level is characteristic of the regime of optical spin population trapping .",
    "a non - monotonic power dependence is indeed observed in the experiments presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10](b ) . for a single mode excitation laser detuned on the high energy side of the state @xmath16 ( fig .",
    "[ fig10](a ) ) , an increase of the population is observed starting from the low excitation intensity regime .",
    "this is the spin population trapping regime .",
    "then the population saturates and decreases at high excitation intensity when the optically dressed state is shifted away from the states s@xmath13=@xmath311/2 and the transfer of population is suppressed .",
    "examples of low and high excitation power spectrum of x@xmath4-mn are presented in fig .",
    "[ fig10](d ) .",
    "this experiment confirms that the optical spin population trapping regime can be reached either by changing the laser detuning or by changing the laser excitation intensity .",
    "in conclusion , we have shown that the coupling with a resonant laser field strongly modifies the spin dynamics of a mn atom inserted in a strained self - assembled qd .",
    "in addition to the standard optical pumping , the mn spin can be trapped in the state which is optically excited .",
    "this mechanism of _ spin population trapping _ is controlled by the presence of a coherent coupling between the different mn spin states s@xmath13 induced by an in - plane strain anisotropy .",
    "such spin dynamics is not specific to a mn atom and could be observed in other solid state and atomic spin systems provided that a coherent coupling between the spin sub - levels is present .",
    "as demonstrated for a mn atom , the coherent coupling could be induced by a transverse magnetic field .",
    "the population trapping of the mn electronic spin can also involve flip - flops with the mn nuclear spin and an optical pumping of the nuclear spin is expected .",
    "this optical excitation configuration will be used in future experiments to optically access the nuclear spin of the mn in its solid state environment .",
    "this spin initialization technique could also be extended to qds containing 2 mn atoms @xcite to optically induce a correlation between the localized spins .",
