    "triggered by the discovery of the one dimensional topological superconductor ( 1dtsc ) by kitaev in 2001 @xcite , one dimensional topologically nontrivial proximity induced superconductors have received enormous attention in recent years @xcite .",
    "the theoretical prediction of the 1dtsc phase in nanowires coupled to a conventional superconductor @xcite has paved the way for first experimental signatures of majorana bound states ( mbs ) in condensed matter physics @xcite .",
    "the non - abelian statistics of these exotic quasiparticles have been theoretically demonstrated @xcite with the help of t - junctions of wires .",
    "+ while non symmetry protected topological superconductors ( tsc)s belong to the symmetry class d @xcite , there are also time reversal symmetry ( trs ) protected tscs in symmetry class diii in one , two , and three spatial dimensions @xcite . due to kramers theorem ,",
    "the trs preserving 1dtsc features a kramers pair of spinful mbs at each of its ends , as depicted schematically in fig .",
    "[ fig : d31dphase ] .        generically , pairs of mbs are topologically equivalent to ordinary fermions .",
    "hence , one might at first glance expect that these end states obey ordinary fermionic braiding statistics .",
    "however , it has recently been shown @xcite that this is not the case for single kramers pairs of mbs : as long as trs is preserved each of the mbs kramers partners obeys ising anyonic statistics independently .",
    "several authors have recently proposed realizations of the trs preserving 1dtsc in class diii @xcite ( see also @xcite ) . given the fact that ising anyons like mbs do not allow for universal topological quantum computing per se @xcite , the additional kramers ( spin ) degree of freedom might be considered helpful for quantum information processing architectures based on mbs .",
    "+ by taking a look into the periodic table of topological states of matter @xcite , we infer that a @xmath1  invariant can be assigned to the symmetry class diii in 1d . here , we are concerned both with the physical meaning and the practical calculation of the value of this invariant @xmath2 . in the presence of an additional @xmath0   spin rotation symmetry that fixes a global spin quantization axis ,",
    "the trs preserving 1dtsc can be understood as two copies of the non symmetry protected 1dtsc , each copy representing one spin projection . in this special case ,",
    "the calculation of @xmath3  boils down to the calculation of kitaev s pfaffian invariant @xcite for one of the spin blocks . in the generic case without additional symmetries ,",
    "the situation becomes more complicated .",
    "the calculation of @xmath3  as originally proposed in ref .",
    "then involves a twofold dimensional extension to connect the system to its parent state , the 3d tsc in class diii .",
    "such a calculation can be pretty cumbersome to evaluate in particular numerically . for non - interacting systems with closed boundary conditions , a scattering matrix approach as reported in ref . can be used .",
    "in this work , we prove that the topological @xmath1  invariant @xmath3  defining the 1dtsc in class diii can be viewed as a kramers polarization . in the presence of a fixed spin quantization axis",
    "this kramers polarization reduces to the well known pfaffian invariant @xcite for one spin block .",
    "most interestingly , we provide a manifestly gauge invariant way to directly calculate this bulk invariant for generic systems in the absence of any additional symmetries . by manifestly gauge invariant , we mean that no continuous phase relation between wave functions at different @xmath4-points needs to be known , which allows for a straightforward numerical calculation of @xmath3 . as has been shown previously for topological insulators in the symplectic class aii @xcite , we find a tremendous simplification regarding the analytical form of @xmath3  in the presence of inversion symmetry .",
    "the calculation of @xmath3  then only involves the representation of the parity operator at the real @xmath4-points @xmath5  and @xmath6 , where @xmath7 . by rephrasing @xmath3  in terms of the single particle green s function and applying twisted boundary conditions",
    ", the definition of the invariant can readily be extended to interacting and disordered systems , respectively ( see also @xcite for invariants for interacting systems ) . +",
    "we would like to construct a generally valid , manifestly gauge invariant , and physically intuitive formulation of the topological invariant @xmath3  characterizing the 1dtsc in symmetry class diii @xcite . a bogoliubov de",
    "gennes ( bdg ) hamiltonian @xmath8  in this symmetry class is characterized by the presence of two antiunitary symmetries . a symplectic trs @xmath9  satisfying @xmath10  and a particle hole symmetry ( phs ) @xmath11  satisfying @xmath12 . @xmath8  commutes with @xmath9  and anticommutes with @xmath11 .",
    "consequently , the combination @xmath13  is a unitary operation that anticommutes with the hamiltonian .",
    "@xmath14  is called a chiral symmetry . for concreteness ,",
    "we will without loss of generality use the common convention @xmath15  and @xmath16 , where @xmath17  is a pauli matrix in spin space whereas @xmath18  is a pauli matrix in nambu space and @xmath19  denotes complex conjugation .",
    "we would like to point out that the phs is not a physical symmetry but rather results trivially from the redundancy of the bdg description of superconductivity which deals with two copies of the physical spectrum : a particle and a hole copy .",
    "+ let us start with the special case where an additional @xmath0-spin rotation symmetry gives rise to a global spin quantization axis : we assume that @xmath20=0 $ ] .",
    "it follows immediately that the hamiltonian can be block diagonalized into spin blocks as @xmath21 , where the diagonal matrix structure is in spin space .",
    "the individual blocks are in symmetry class d and are characterized by the same value @xmath22  of kitaev s pfaffian @xmath1  invariant @xcite .",
    "for this special case , the topological invariant of the full system @xmath3  we are concerned with in this work is hence just given by the invariant for one of its spin blocks .",
    "the physical interpretation of this phenomenology is straightforward . in the non - trivial phase ,",
    "each of the spin blocks features a single spin polarized mbs at each end of the system , i.e. , there is a spin - degenerate pair of mbs associated with each end . in the trivial phase ,",
    "each spin block has zero ( or at least an even number of ) mbs .",
    "equivalently to the pfaffian invariant @xmath23 , the 1dtsc can also be characterized by a zak - berry phase @xcite which is quantized to integer multiples of @xmath6  due to the presence of phs @xcite .",
    "the quantized zak - berry phase can be understood as a half - integer quantized polarization of the bdg band structure @xcite .",
    "we hence have @xmath24 where @xmath25  is the berry connection of the spin block @xmath26  and the sum on @xmath27  runs over its occupied bands with bloch states @xmath28 . as already mentioned the polarization @xmath29  does not depend on the spin index @xmath26  modulo integers .",
    "+ we now turn to generic hamiltonians in class diii and hence drop the assumption of a @xmath0  spin rotation symmetry .",
    "however , the presence of trs still implies that the eigenstates come in pairs .",
    "both members of such a pair have degenerate energies at the time reversal invariant ( i.e. , real ) momenta due to kramers theorem . instead of a spin index @xmath30 , the bloch bands can hence be assigned a kramers index @xmath31 . following the general analysis of bloch functions in the presence of a symplectic trs in ref .",
    "we define @xmath32 this conjugation property of the kramers bands leads to the constraint on the berry connection of the kramers blocks @xcite @xmath33 i.e. , the berry connections of opposite kramers blocks at opposite momenta are related by a gauge transformation .",
    "( [ eqn : trsberry ] ) implies that the associated kramers polarizations @xmath34  are independent of @xmath35  modulo integers .",
    "this generalizes our previous statement that the kitaev invariant @xmath23  is the same for both spin blocks in the @xmath36  conserving case to the generic case of kramers blocks .",
    "this clearly shows that the kitaev invariant for the total trs preserving hamiltonian is always trivial as it consists of two identical contributions from the kramers blocks .",
    "this is consistent with the fact that only kramers pairs of mbs can occur at the ends of a trs preserving 1dtsc as opposed to the single mbs in the nontrivial trs breaking 1dtsc . using eqs .",
    "( [ eqn : trsbloch]),([eqn : trsberry ] ) , the kramers polarization @xmath37  can be readily expressed as @xcite @xmath38 , \\label{eqn : fukanepol}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath39 and pf denotes the pfaffian .",
    "the matrix form of @xmath9 is denoted by @xmath40  which is antisymmetric at the real @xmath4-points @xmath41 ; @xmath42 denotes the restriction of @xmath40 to the occupied bands . ref .",
    "is concerned with the symplectic symmetry class aii which only requires trs . for generic hamiltonians in aii , @xmath37",
    "is not quantized which is reflected in the fact that there are no topologically non - trivial states in this class in 1d @xcite . in symmetry class diii however , the additional presence of the spectrum generating phs implies that the polarization is half - integer quantized even for the individual kramers blocks .",
    "hence , the value of @xmath43  defines a @xmath1  invariant in class diii .",
    "+ several remarks on eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fukanepol ] ) are in order .",
    "it has already been pointed out in ref . that the expression on the right hand side of eq .",
    "( [ eqn : fukanepol ] ) is gauge invariant .",
    "however , its calculation requires the fixing of an arbitrary gauge for which a continuous phase relation between the bloch functions in half of the brillouin zone has to be known .",
    "hence , eq . ( [ eqn : fukanepol ] ) does not yet provide a constructive prescription as to the numerical calculation of the topological invariant .",
    "we will now proceed to construct such a manifestly gauge invariant recipe .",
    "our construction makes use of the manifestly gauge invariant formulation of the the adiabatic theorem due to kato @xcite which works with projection operators rather than wave functions . to this end , we first exponentiate eq .",

    "the abelian part of this propagator is then simply given by the determinant of this unitary representation matrix .",
    "remarkably , the kato propagator can be calculated numerically in a straightforward way in contrast to the berry connection .",
    "explicitly , for the path @xmath49  in @xmath4-space appearing in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nuresult ] ) , we get ( see refs . @xcite for the general construction ) @xmath50 where the product is ordered from the right to the left with increasing @xmath51 .",
    "the practical calculation of this quantity only requires the calculation of the gauge - independent projectors @xmath52  onto the occupied bands on a discrete mesh of points in @xmath4-space . to proceed with the evaluation of the invariant @xmath3  as defined in eq .",
    "( [ eqn : nuresult ] ) , we only have to fix an arbitrary basis of occupied bloch functions @xmath53  at @xmath54  and @xmath55  at @xmath56 .",
    "note that this choice does not require any information about relative phases of bloch functions at different points in @xmath4-space .",

    "( [ eqn : nusimple ] ) is the key result of the present work .",
    "it allows an even numerically straightforward prescription to calculate the topological @xmath1  invariant of a generic 1dtsc in symmetry class diii . in an example below , we show that this invariant does indeed distinguish between the trivial and non - trivial 1dtscs in class diii .",

    "even though we obtained a simple and numerically tractable form of the @xmath77 invariant , eq .  , one can simplify the result even further in the presence of additional symmetries .",
    "we consider inversion symmetry , which has been used to simplify invariants in two- and three dimensional systems in class aii in @xcite .",
    "inversion symmetry is a symmetry of the model under @xmath78 , which in momentum space is implemented by the ( momentum independent ) unitary operator @xmath79 , such that @xmath80 , with @xmath81 .",

    ". in particular , @xmath86 , where @xmath87 is the restriction of @xmath84 to the occupied bands @xcite . by adjusting the phase of the bloch functions",
    ", one can set @xmath88 , implying that the berry connection vanishes , and that the topological invariant can be obtained with knowledge about the system at the real momenta @xmath41 only . in the final step ,",
    "one relates @xmath89 and @xmath90 to the inversion symmetry eigenvalues @xmath91 and @xmath92 of the kramers pairs . because @xmath93 = 0 $ ]",
    ", both members of a kramers pair have the same inversion symmetry eigenvalue .",
    "the final result is that @xmath94 for @xmath95 , where the product is over all occupied kramers pairs , i.e. , only one member of each pair contributes to the product .",
    "it follows that in the presence of inversion symmetry , one can write the invariant @xmath3 , eq .   in terms of the eigenvalues",
    "@xmath82 of @xmath79 at the real momenta as @xmath96 where each occupied kramers pair contributes once to the product .",
    "as a first application of this result we consider a generic 1dtsc in class d. for these non - trs superconductors , kitaev @xcite constructed a pfaffian invariant @xmath97 .",
    "for translationally invariant systems , the invariant only involves the pfaffian of the majorana representation of the model at momenta @xmath95 .",
    "we recently showed that this invariant can be written in terms of the quantized zak - berry phase @xcite .",
    "although there are already several forms of the @xmath77 invariant available , it is interesting to note that in the presence of inversion symmetry , the invariant @xmath98 can also be related to the eigenvalues of the operator @xmath79 .",
    "the arguments given above for systems in class diii rely on the presence of trs . however , both members of each kramers pair have the same inversion eigenvalue .",
    "it follows that if we ` double ' a 1d inversion symmetric superconductor with hamiltonian @xmath99 in class d and construct a trs model @xmath100 , the @xmath77 invariant is given by eq .  .",
    "the product can be taken over the occupied bands of the original system @xmath99 .",
    "hence , the invariant of inversion symmetric 1dtsc in class d is also given by eq .  , but with the product running over all occupied bands ( which are not kramers degenerate ) .",
    "we constructed a bulk topological invariant for time reversal symmetric superconductors in one dimension ( corresponding to symmetry class diii ) , which detects the presence or absence of a kramers pair of majorana bound states at the ends of the superconductor .",
    "the calculation of this invariant is numerically straightforward , because it does not require fixing of a phase relation between the bloch states at different momenta .",
    "the only ingredients needed to calculate the invariant are the projections onto the occupied states , and the matrix elements of the trs operator at the real momenta @xmath95 .",
    "we demonstrated our method by computing the topological phase diagram of a rashba wire in the presence of two competing sc pairing terms , an s - wave and a p - wave pairing . for interacting systems ,",
    "the bdg hamiltonian can be replaced by the nambu single particle green s function @xmath101   at zero frequency @xcite , explicitly @xmath102  in all calculations . in the presence of inversion symmetry ,",
    "the topological invariant simplifies .",
    "it then only depends on the inversion symmetry eigenvalue associated with the kramers pairs at the real momenta .",
    "because the resulting invariant only depends on the parity associated with the kramers pairs ( both members share the same parity ) , one concludes that the same invariant can be used for 1d superconductors without trs .",
    "indeed , one can simply consider two time reversal conjugated copies of the same model .",
    "the same consideration holds for quantum anomalous hall systems in 2d with inversion symmetry .",
    "their chern number can be calculated modulo two , by constructing two time reversal copies , and calculating the @xmath77 invariant associated with the resulting inversion symmetric quantum spin hall system in class aii .",
