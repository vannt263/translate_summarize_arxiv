    "the existing dynamical theory of the glassforming overcooled liquids and polymers are mainly applicable to the relatively high temperature area . the well - known mode - coupling theory ( mct )",
    "@xcite predicts a dynamical phase transition at the critical temperature @xmath1 where the overcooled liquid becomes nonergodic and stays in this state upon the further cooling .",
    "it is significant that according to mct , the characteristic times of the @xmath2 - relaxation or the viscosity exhibit a power low divergence : @xmath3 at a critical temperature @xmath4 .",
    "it has been realized now that such types of singularities are generic for a broad class of mean - field ( mf ) models and its appearance is an indication for the role of the _ activation processes _ which are neglected in mf - models @xcite .",
    "this means physically that the topography of the free energy landscape in the space of the coarse grained variables should be taken into consideration . at low temperatures the free energy landscape determines more or less the dynamics of the system .",
    "the size of the free energy barriers between the metastable states , however , determinates the rate of any activation processes at the low temperature regime @xmath5 .    at the so - called kauzmann temperature @xmath6 , which is usually @xmath7 a genuine thermodynamic glass transition or so called gibbs - dimarzio transition is expected to take place @xcite . at the gibbs - dimarzio ( or kauzmann ) temperature @xmath6 ,",
    "the system is preferably in a thermodynamic unique configuration since the height of the free energy barriers grow with the system size .",
    "the earliest analytical approach to the problem which captured these two aforementioned aspects has been worked out in several papers by kirkpatrick , thirumalai and wolynes in the late 80 s @xcite . in these papers which study the phenomena by making use of the @xmath0 - spin interaction spin glasses ( at @xmath8 ) and",
    "potts glasses with more then four components , the following conclusions have been drawn :    * the predicted phase transition temperature @xmath9 obtained by the dynamical theory ( actually equivalent to @xmath10 of the mct based on the langevin dynamics in the mean field limit ) is higher than the kauzmann @xmath6 obtained by the static theory ( or by the ordinary replica theory ) .",
    "* as the temperature decreases ( starting from the paramagnetic phase ) the metastable minima appear first exactly at @xmath9 .",
    "* in the intermediate temperature regime @xmath11 many metastable states are separated by high barriers .",
    "therefore these states may have a long lifetime .",
    "the activated transport is the typical process in this temperature range .",
    "* the overlap order parameter within the one - step replica symmetry breaking ( 1-rsb ) scenario undergoes a discontinuous jump at @xmath6 .",
    "this reminds to a first order phase transition even so thermodynamically ( e.g. , in the specific heat ) the transition seems to be of second order .",
    "the authors called this class of phase transitions _",
    "random first order phase transition_. crisanti and sommers confirmed essentially the same type of behavior for the @xmath0 - spin spherical model @xcite , which is different from the sherrington - kirkpatrick model , and is shared by the other spin - glass models without reflection symmetry @xcite .",
    "indeed it has been argued often , that many connections exist between the behavior of the _ structural glasses _ and spin glasses without reflection symmetry @xcite .",
    "most of these properties mentioned above for the spin glasses can be found in the context of structural glasses too . however , the important difference between the spin and structural glasses is that the spin glasses models contain a _ quenched disorder _",
    "already in the hamiltonian . in structural glasses the hamiltonian is a regular function of the particles coordinates and does not contain disorder .",
    "nevertheless the free energy in both systems resemble each other and posses similar properties .",
    "thus , and disorder is in a sense _ self - generated _ and develops itself during the cooling ( or glass transition ) process .    the properties and possibilities of self - generated ( or self -induced ) disorder",
    "have been already discussed in the framework of rather special spin - models @xcite .",
    "these models explicitly involve pseudo - random numbers , i.e. , the spin -spin couplings , although deterministic , oscillate very rapid and can be considered as a ( pseudo ) - random variables .",
    "these models , however , provide some spin analogies of structural glasses but still are quite different from structural glasses @xcite .    furthermore , the ideas and the methods of the mean - field spin - glasses @xcite have been successfully used to study the freezing states in a _",
    "heteropolymer globule _ @xcite .",
    "the corresponding model considers the conformational behavior of a polymer chain with randomly quenched interactions between monomers .",
    "these random copolymers posses always a collapsed ( or globular state ) depending on temperature and strength of the randomness .",
    "it was successfully shown , that the disorder results in a globular and eventually in a glassy globular state .",
    "the corresponding freezing is characterized by a transition between two phases : one phase is characterized by many accessible configurations , while the other is dominated by only a few of them , i.e. , an eventually frozen state . in this context",
    "the heteropolymer freezing usually serves as a simple `` toy model '' for the protein folding phenomenon @xcite .",
    "this relationship between the freezing and folding phenomena is caused mainly by the fact that in both cases only a single conformation ( which is in the context of protein folding called the native state ) dominates .    in the following",
    "we are going to investigate a similar problem in homopolymer globules in poor solvent .",
    "it is well known that homopolymers in poor solvent form globules due to an attractive second virial coefficient which are then stabilized by the repulsive third virial @xcite .",
    "the relevant parameter for the globule formation is the second virial coefficient which is measured by the relative distance from the so - called @xmath12 - temperature , where the homopolymer takes gaussian conformations .",
    "close below @xmath12 the polymer collapses and the deeper the temperature the more dense becomes the globule .",
    "the intuitive limit is then a dense liquid globule .",
    "we will show nevertheless , that even at lower temperatures and beyond a certain density the globule freezes and forms a glass .",
    "homopolymer globules show a _",
    "structural glass transition_. thus they will form a `` nano glass '' .    it is most interesting to note that in recent monte - carlo simulations of homopolymer globules , milchev and binder @xcite have found a dramatic decrease of the acceptance rate of the moves which in its turn suggests to the growth of the characteristic times .",
    "they have seen also a pronounced density fluctuations which appear in the center of the globule and spread over the entire globule as a temperature is lowered .",
    "this results have been interpreted in terms of a glassy type of transition .",
    "these investigations have been restudied in papers by kreitmeier et .",
    "al @xcite where a similar dynamical behavior of the homopolymer globule has been verified once more and was generalized for the cyclic deformation regime .",
    "moreover , a glass transition in a homopolymer globule ( for the chain length @xmath13 on the @xmath14 cubic lattice ) has been discussed by computer simulations @xcite .",
    "these authors found that the conformation space of the model consist from one huge valley and a big number of small `` chambers '' .",
    "these disjoint domains of the conformational space are responsible for the ergodicity breaking and freezing transition",
    ". this might be important for the final processes of folding dynamics in the protein molecules because the speed and reliability of the folding depends on whether the native state belongs to the same conformational space domain or not @xcite .",
    "the thermodynamic behavior of the homopolymer globules have been studied also by discontinuous molecular dynamics simulation @xcite . by making use a simple off - lattice model for chain length @xmath15",
    "the authors showed the existence of the first - order liquid - solid - like transition .",
    "the transition occurs at temperatures below the coil - globule transition temperature and has been detected by the heat capacity peak as well as by the lindemann parameter jump .",
    "it is interesting that there is a qualitative similarity between homopolymers and proteins where the transition from the molten globule to the native state is also of the first order @xcite . in ref.@xcite a new `` expanded ensemble ''",
    "monte carlo algorithm has been introduced which helps to overcome the density slowing down in the globule state . for the chain length",
    "up to @xmath16 the authors have seen the bimodal distribution in the number of contacts per monomer .",
    "this is again a clear indication of the first - order liquid - to - solid transition of the collapsed globule .",
    "as already mentioned , most important is that the globule formed from ordinary homopolymers does not contain any quenched disorder .",
    "if this system forms glassy states the disorder has to be self - generated . nevertheless , to form glassy states certain frustrations are necessary .",
    "these may have its origin in the interplay between attractive interaction ( negative @xmath17 virial coefficient @xmath18 ) , repulsion ( positive @xmath19 virial coefficient @xmath20 ) and the constraints imposed by the chain connectivity .",
    "these frustrations might be already sufficient to provide the structural glass transition from a _ liquid globule _ to a _ glassy globule_.    the main purpose of the present paper is to investigate these problems in more detail by analytic means .",
    "we will indeed show that the linear homopolymer in the condensed globular phase undergoes a genuine structural glass transition of the similar type as in the @xmath0 - spin - interaction spin - glass with @xmath21 or potts glasses models .",
    "we stress once more , that the homopolymer is a pure system and does not contain quenched disorder . nevertheless the @xmath22 - component field theory formulation for linear polymers",
    "@xcite provides already a natural and solid basis @xcite . as we will show below",
    ", the homopolymer globule is a generic system where frustrations rather than quenched disorder trigger the glass formation . as a starting point we employ the field - theoretical description of the self - interacted polymeric chain in a poor solvent @xcite .",
    "so far , in ref . @xcite it has been shown that the laplace transformation ( with respect to the chain length @xmath23 ) of the polymeric correlation function can be associated with the corresponding correlator within the @xmath24 limit of the @xmath22 - component @xmath25 - field theory ( where @xmath26 ) .",
    "we argue instead that the same @xmath22 - component field theory can be mapped onto some kind of _ disordered one - component model _ where the imposed random field is a non - gaussian ( a color noise ) and its statistical moments are determinated only by virial coefficients @xmath27 , etc . in this case",
    "the index @xmath28 acts as a _ replica index _ for spin glasses @xcite or random magnetics @xcite .",
    "this mapping has been suggested for spin glasses already three decades ago @xcite but was never actually used .",
    "at this point we should add a general remark : throughout the paper we use the _ large globule approximation _",
    ", i.e. , we consider the chain length @xmath23 to be very large .",
    "this is necessary to avoid additional complications close to the surface of the globule .",
    "intuitively it is obvious , that monomers close to the globule surface experience a different dynamic environment , such that different mechanisms of freezing processes take place .",
    "we will come back to this point in a later publication .",
    "in this section we will provide the basic formulations and the field theory for polymers in poor solvent , i.e. , with attractive interactions . to do so , we start from usual continuous description of a homopolymer chain of the length @xmath23 in the poor solvent .",
    "its hamiltonian has the following form @xmath29 = \\frac{d}{2a^2}\\int\\limits_0^n\\ , ds \\left(\\frac{\\partial { \\bf        r}(s)}{\\partial s}\\right)^2 - \\frac{|v|}{2}\\int\\limits_0^n\\ , dsds ' \\delta \\left({\\bf r}(s ) - { \\bf r}(s')\\right)\\nonumber\\\\   + \\frac{w}{3 ! } \\int\\limits_0^n\\ ,",

    "usually the second virial coefficient is measured by its distance from the @xmath12 temperature , i.e. , @xmath34 .",
    "the third virial coefficient is always of order of @xmath35 .",
    "the density of the globule is easily estimated by @xmath36 , which provides a naive limit of the temperature at @xmath37 .",
    "indeed at sufficient low temperatures the globule is dense , and the entropy term ( first term ) becomes less and less important .",
    "the remaining entropic fluctuations are only important on length scales @xmath38 .",
    "this observation will allow us later the safe use of corresponding mean field theories .",
    "the next step is @xcite ( see also appendix a ) to employ the the laplace transformation of the polymeric correlation function @xmath39 @xmath40 which can be associated with the @xmath41 limit of the @xmath42 field theory as follows : @xmath43 \\right\\ } , \\label{corr1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath44 is a @xmath22 - component field , @xmath45 , the chemical potential , which is conjugated to @xmath23 and the replicated hamiltonian is @xmath46 & = & \\frac{1}{2 } \\int\\ , d^{d}r \\sum_{a =    1}^{n } \\psi_{a}(r)\\left [ \\mu - \\frac{a^2}{2d } \\nabla^2 \\right]\\psi_{a}(r ) - \\frac{|v|}{8 } \\int\\ , d^{d}r \\left[\\sum_{a =    1}^{n } \\psi_{a}^{2}(r)\\right]^{2}\\nonumber\\\\ & + & \\frac{w}{3!8}\\int\\ , d^{d}r\\left[\\sum_{\\alpha =    1}^{n } \\psi_{a}^{2}(r)\\right]^{3 } + \\dots   \\quad,\\label{hamilt}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] as usual the vector field @xmath47 corresponds to the polymer density in the usual manner , i.e. , @xmath48 the relationship between @xmath45 and @xmath23 has the form @xmath49 the attractive interaction term of the order @xmath50 changes the behavior of the field theory .",
    "correlations of the self avoidance are no longer important and we must take care on the balance between the attractive and repulsive forces . although we mentioned above the relative unimportance of the connectivity term , we have to take track on it as well .",
    "the careful analysis below shows that it provides at sufficient low second virial coefficients significant contributions on small scales ( @xmath51 ) contributions only by connectivity .",
    "these are in part responsible for frustration .",
    "now we are going to map this field theory onto a random system .",
    "it can be shown ( see appendix b ) that the free energy of the globule state @xmath52 can be interpreted as the free - energy of a one - component _ random model _ with hamiltonian @xmath53   , \\label{hamilt1}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where the random field @xmath54 is non - gaussian with its generating functional of the form @xmath55 and where the bar means the averaging over @xmath54 . it is interesting to underline that only for this combination of signs of the virial coefficients ( @xmath56 ) the even central moments @xmath57 ( see eqs.([moment2ap ] ) - ( [ moment5ap ] ) ) are positive , as it should be for the real field @xmath58 .",
