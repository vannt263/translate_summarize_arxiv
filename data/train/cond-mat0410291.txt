    "the revolution in molecular biology@xcite sparked by the discovery@xcite of the structure of the dna molecule 50 years ago has led to a breathtakingly beautiful description of life .",
    "life employs well - tailored chain molecules to store and replicate information , to carry out a dizzying array of functionalities and to provide a molecular basis for natural selection .",
    "the complementary base pairing mechanism in dna combined with its double - helix structure serves as a repository of information and provides a pretty mechanism for replication@xcite .",
    "the replication is prone to errors or mutations and these errors , which are the basis of evolution , are in turn copied in future generations@xcite . using the rna molecule as an intermediary , the information contained in the dna genes",
    "is translated into proteins , which are linear chains of amino acids . unlike the dna molecule , which adopts a limited number of related structures , protein molecules@xcite fold into thousands of native state structures under physiological conditions . for proteins ,",
    "form determines functionality and the rich variety of observed forms underscores the versatility of proteins .",
    "there then follows a complex orchestrated dance in which proteins catalyze reactions , interact with each other and finally feedback into the gene to regulate the synthesis of other proteins@xcite .",
    "a protein molecule is large and has many atoms .",
    "in addition , the water molecules surrounding the protein play a crucial role in its behavior . at the microscopic level , the laws of quantum mechanics can be used to deduce the interactions but the number of degrees of freedom are far too many for the system to be studied in all its detail .",
    "when one attempts to look at the problem in a coarse - grained manner@xcite with what one hopes are the essential degrees of freedom , it is very hard to determine what the effective potential energies of interaction are .",
    "this situation makes the protein problem particularly daunting and no solution has yet been found .    over many decades",
    ", much experimental data has been accumulated yet theoretical progress has been somewhat limited .",
    "the problem is highly interdisciplinary and touches on biology , chemistry and physics and it is often hard to distill the essential features of each of the multiple aspects of the problem . the great successes of quantum chemistry in the determination of the structure of the dna molecule@xcite and in the spectacular prediction that helices and sheets@xcite are the building blocks of protein structures has spurred much work using detailed chemistry on understanding the protein problem .",
    "such work has been very insightful in providing useful hints on how proteins behave at the atomic scale in performing their tasks .",
    "the missing feature , of course , in such a theoretical approach is that it treats each protein as a special entity with all the attendant details of the sequence of amino acids , their intricate side chain atoms and the water molecules . such an approach , while quite valuable , neither has as a goal nor can lend itself to a unified way of understanding seemingly disparate phenomena pertaining to proteins .",
    "reinforcing this , experiments , which are very challenging , are carried out on one protein at a time and cry out for an understanding of the behavior of an individual class of protein .",
    "the lessons we have learned from physics are of a different nature .",
    "the history of physics is replete with examples of the elucidation of connections between what seem to be distinct phenomena and the development of a unifying framework , which , in turn , leads to new observable consequences@xcite .",
    "there have been many attempts at using physics - based approaches for understanding proteins .",
    "these have provided valuable insights on how one might think about the problem and have served as a means of understanding experimental data . yet",
    ", no simple unification has been achieved in a deeper understanding of the key principles at work in proteins .",
    "we restrict ourselves to globular proteins which display the rich variety of native state structures .",
    "there are other interesting and important classes of proteins@xcite such as membrane proteins and fibrous proteins which we do not consider here .",
    "our goal here is to present a new approach to understanding proteins  our focus is on understanding the origin of protein structures and how they form the basis for both functionality and natural selection .",
    "our work points to a unification of the various aspects of all proteins : symmetry and geometry determine the limited menu of folded conformations that a protein can choose from for its native state structure ; these structures are in a marginally compact phase in the vicinity of a phase transition and are therefore eminently suited for biological function ; these structures are the molecular target for the powerful forces of evolution ; proteins are well - designed sequences of amino acids which fit well into one of these predetermined folds ; and proteins are prone to misfolding and aggregation leading to the formation of amyloids , which are implicated in debilitating human diseases@xcite such as alzheimer s , light - chain amyloidosis and spongiform encephalopathies .",
    "we present a discussion of the nature of the denatured state ( which can loosely be thought of as the collection of unfolded conformations ) and its possible key role in the protein folding problem .",
    "we also show how disordered proteins could fit into our unified framework .",
    "the problem of how life was created is a fascinating one .",
    "our focus is on looking at life on earth and asking how it works .",
    "the lessons we learn provide hints to the answers of deep and fundamental questions that have been pondered by our ancients : was life on earth inevitable ?",
    "then there is the question posed by henderson@xcite about whether the nature of our physical world is biocentric ?",
    "is there a need for fine - tuning in biochemistry to provide for the fitness of life in the cosmos or even less ambitiously for life here on earth ?",
    "surprisingly , as we will show , a physics approach turns out to be valuable for thinking about these questions .",
    "the main text of the paper contains the principal ideas and details of the calculations are relegated to the appendices . in section",
    "ii , we introduce the description of a protein as a thick polymer chain and highlight the differences in its phase diagram with respect to the usual string and beads model . in section iii , we make a comparison of the predictions obtained from the simple tube model against experimental data available on protein native state structures . in section iv",
    ", we introduce a more refined model in which the tube picture is reinforced with the geometrical constraints that arise in the formation of hydrogen - bonds and discuss the resulting phase diagram for an isolated peptide chain . in section",
    "v , we discuss several consequences of our model including the nature of the free energy landscape , the innate propensity of proteins to aggregate into amyloid - like forms and the role played by proteins as the targets of natural selection in molecular evolution . in section",
    "vi , we discuss the nature of the denatured state of proteins and its possible role in protein folding . in the final section vii ,",
    "we conclude with a summary .",
    "the fluid and crystalline phases of matter can be readily understood@xcite in terms of the behavior of a simple system of hard spheres . the standard way of ensuring the self - avoidance of a system of uniform hard spheres is to consider all pairs of spheres and require that their centers are no closer than their diameter .",
    "studies of hard spheres have a venerable history@xcite including early work by kepler on the packing of cannonballs in a ship s hold . each hard sphere",
    "can be thought of as a point particle or a zero dimensional object with its own private space of spatial extent equal to its radius .",
    "generalizing to a one dimensional object , one must consider a line or a string , with private space associated with each point along the line , leading to a uniform tube of radius of cross - section or thickness , @xmath0 , with its axis defined by the line .",
    "( likewise , one could consider a collection of interacting tubes . )",
    "the generalization of the hard sphere constraint to the description of the self - avoidance of a tube of non - zero thickness is as follows@xcite ( see appendix a ) : consider all triplets of points along the axis of the tube . draw circles through each of the triplets and ensure that none of the radii is less than the tube thickness@xcite .",
    "this prescription surprisingly entails discarding pairwise interactions and working with effective three body interactions@xcite .",
    "one may visualize a tube as the continuum limit of a _ discrete _ chain of tethered disks or coins@xcite of fixed radius separated from each other by a distance @xmath1 in the limit of @xmath2 .",
    "the inherent anisotropy associated with a coin ( the heads to tails direction being different from the other two perpendicular to it ) reflects the fact that there is a special local direction at each position defined by the locations of the adjacent objects along the chain .",
    "an alternative description of a discrete chain molecule is a string and beads model in which the tethered objects are spheres .",
    "the key difference between these two descriptions is the different symmetry of the tethered objects .",
    "upon compaction of a chain of spheres , each individual sphere tends to surround itself isotropically with other spheres unlike the tube situation in which nearby tube segments need to be placed parallel to each other . even for unconstrained particles , deviations from spherical symmetry ( replacing a system of hard spheres with one of hard rods , for example ) lead to rich new liquid crystal phases@xcite ( see fig . [ fig1 ] ) .",
    "likewise , we find that the tube and a chain of tethered spheres exhibit quite distinct behaviors with one exception  in the presence of an attractive self - interaction favoring compaction , the chain of coins and the string and beads model behave similarly in the limit of vanishing ratios of the radii of the coin and sphere to the range of attraction .",
    "a detailed comparison between the chain of coins ( tube ) and the string and beads model with a bending rigidity energy term is carried out in appendix b.    fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] is a sketch of the phase diagram , at zero temperature , of a homopolymer of length @xmath3 and thickness @xmath0 with the range of attractive interaction @xmath4 .",
    "this phase diagram has been obtained using detailed computer simulations accompanied by an approximate mean field theory@xcite and can be understood on the basis of physical arguments . for large values of @xmath5 , there are two distinct phases .",
    "when @xmath6 is large , the tube is very thick compared to the range of attractive interactions and one obtains a swollen phase with equal weight for all self - avoiding conformations .",
    "one finds a very large degeneracy with no tendency towards compaction . on the other hand , for small @xmath6",
    ", one has a semi - crystalline phase@xcite in which the tube is stretched out locally with nearby sections parallel to each other .",
    "a similar structure is also obtained for many long tubes  the arrangement is akin to piling up logs parallel to each other with each log surrounded by six other logs in a hexagonal array , the optimal packing in two dimension of coins of radius @xmath0 .",
    "such structures are similar to those found in the abrikosov flux lattice@xcite and bear a resemblance to liquid crystal order .",
    "liquid crystals are a delicate state of matter of rod - like molecules which adopt many distinct arrangements sensitive to external electric and magnetic fields@xcite .",
    "a liquid crystal phase that is analogous to the semi - crystalline phase is the nematic phase in which the molecules move as in a regular liquid but with an alignment of their axes . unlike a spin system in which an up spin is different from a down spin , in the nematic phase ,",
    "all that matters is the direction of the axis of the particle  there is no up - down distinction  and this change in symmetry leads to a first order phase transition between the disordered isotropic and the ordered nematic phases .",
    "likewise , the phase transition between the semi - crystalline phase at low temperatures and a high temperature disordered phase in which there is no compaction of the tube is a first order transition as in the melting of ice into water . at the transition temperature",
    ", there is a coexistence of the two phases ( e.g. , pieces of ice floating in a glass of water ) and an abrupt transition between the two states .",
    "one might call such a system a two - state system  one has water and/or ice but nothing in between .",
    "when the tube is short , one would expect finite size effects@xcite to come into play . in most physical systems ,",
    "such finite size effects are intuitively obvious corrections to the bulk scenario and arise from the effects of the finite boundaries . for our tube ,",
    "the simplest situation occurs in the swollen phase where the finite size effects are not important  short fat tubes continue to adopt open conformations . at the other extreme of small @xmath6 , as one reduces the length of the tube , the overall symmetry of the folded object crosses over from that of a cylinder ( corresponding to the abrikosov flux lattice - like phase akin to the hexagonal arrangement of parallel , straight logs ) to a sphere when @xmath7 and one obtains one out of many degenerate featureless compact conformations .",
    "physically , for a short tube , there are many more conformations that can be accommodated in the spherical topology than in the cylindrical topology without any accompanying sacrifice in the attractive interaction energy .",
    "there is a confluence of three distinct types of structures : the swollen conformations , the semi - crystalline phase and the featureless compact conformations , when @xmath8 ( fig .",
    "[ fig2 ] ) .",
    "this interplay leads to quite remarkable finite size effects : one obtains a _ marginally compact _ phase with a huge reduction in the degeneracy compared to the featureless compact phase and the swollen phase . on raising the temperature ,",
    "one again finds a two - state behavior and the finite size analog of a first order transition between the marginally compact phase and the disordered phase .",
    "the first order transition occurs because it is necessary for different nearby tube segments to snap into position right alongside each other and parallel to each other in order to avail of the attraction .",
    "the inherent anisotropy of a tube along with the fact that @xmath0 is of order @xmath4 leads to this requirement .",
    "such two - state behavior can , in the simplest scenario , be associated with a transition state@xcite along suitably chosen reaction coordinates . the structures of choice@xcite in the marginally compact phase , for a _ discrete chain _ , are helices , kissing hairpins , regular hairpins and sheets ( figures [ fig3 ] and [ fig4 ] ) .",
    "helices , hairpins and sheets are indeed characterized by a parallel placement of nearby tube segments .",
    "the marginally compact phase is poised in the vicinity of a phase transition to the swollen phase and the structures are therefore flexible@xcite and sensitive to the right types of perturbations .",
    "there is a truly remarkable coincidence between the structures one obtains in the marginally compact physical state of matter of short tubes and the building blocks of protein native state structures ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "proteins@xcite are linear chains of amino acids , of which there are twenty naturally occurring types with distinct side chains . the backbone and several of the side chains are hydrophobic and , under physiological conditions , globular proteins fold rapidly and reproducibly to somewhat compact conformations called their native state structures . in their native states ,",
    "a hydrophobic core is created which is space - filling and water is expelled from the interior . even though there are hundreds of thousands of proteins in human cells , the total number of distinct folds that they adopt in their native states is only of the order of a few thousand@xcite .",
    "furthermore , these structures seem to be evolutionarily conserved@xcite .",
    "proteins are relatively short chain molecules and indeed longer globular proteins form domains which fold autonomously@xcite .",
    "the building blocks of protein structures are helices , hairpins and almost planar sheets ( fig .",
    "[ fig3 ] ) .",
    "strikingly , short tubes , with no _ heterogeneity _ , in the marginally compact phase form helices with the same pitch to radius ratio as in real proteins@xcite ( fig .",
    "[ fig4 ] ) and almost planar sheets made up of zig - zag strands .",
    "it is interesting to note that the helix is a very natural conformation for a tube and occurs without any explicit introduction of hydrogen bonding .",
    "recent work on the denatured state of short amino acid sequences has suggested that the poly - proline ii helix might be the preferred structure in that phase , even though it does not entail the formation of any hydrogen bonds@xcite . as in the tube case ,",
    "small globular proteins show a two - state behavior@xcite and recent experiments@xcite have been successful in mapping out the nature of the transition state in several cases .",
    "let us make the _ constructive hypothesis _ that the extraordinary similarity between the structures adopted by short tubes in the marginally compact phase and the building blocks of protein native state structures is not a mere coincidence .",
    "we _ postulate _ instead that the tube picture presented above is a paradigm for understanding protein structures .",
    "quite generally , such postulates are of limited utility unless one is able to unify seemingly unrelated aspects of the problem and make new predictions amenable to experimental verification . in our case , while the tube idea is theoretical , there is a wealth of experimental data already available on proteins .",
    "before we proceed to explore the consequences of our hypothesis , we will first link the tube picture with the protein problem using experiments as the guide .",
    "let us begin by asking whether the backbone of a protein can be described as a tube .",
    "[ fig5 ] indeed shows that , in its native state , the protein backbone can be thought of as the axis of a tube of approximate radius of cross - section ( @xmath0 ) equal to @xmath9  .",
    "interestingly , there are small variations in the tube radius especially in the vicinity of backward bends@xcite .",
    "the tuning of the two length scales , @xmath0 and @xmath4 , to be comparable to each other happens automatically for proteins : the sizes of the amino acid side chains determine both the tube thickness and the range of interactions .",
    "steric interactions lead to a vast thinning of the phase space that protein structures can explore@xcite .",
    "physically , the notion of a thick chain or a tube follows directly from steric interactions in a protein ",
    "one needs room around the backbone to house the amino acid side chains without any overlap . the same side chains that determine the tube thickness also control the range of attraction  the outer atoms of the side chain interact through a short - range interaction screened by the water .",
    "this self - tuning is a quite remarkable feature of proteins .",
    "the rapid folding of small proteins can be understood in terms of the inherent anisotropy of a tube and the self - tuning of the two key length scales , the tube thickness and the range of the attractive interactions . in the marginally compact phase , in order to avail of the attractive interactions , nearby segments of the tube have to snap into place parallel to each other and right up against each other . as stated before ,",
    "both in the tube picture and in proteins , the helix and the sheet are characterized by such parallel space - filling alignment of nearby tube segments . in proteins ,",
    "such an arrangement serves to expel the water from the protein core .",
    "as shown by linus pauling and coworkers@xcite , hydrogen bonds provide the scaffolding for both helices and sheets and place strong geometrical constraints stemming from quantum chemistry .",
    "we turn now to a marriage of the tube idea and the wealth of information available from a variety of experimental probes@xcite in preparation for the task of exploring the consequences of our hypothesis .",
    "recall that three body local and non - local radii constraints describe the self - avoidance of a tube@xcite ( see appendix a ) . for a discrete chain ,",
    "the local three body radius is defined as the radius of a circle drawn through three consecutive nodes of the chain ( in the limit of a continuous chain the local three body radius is equal to the radius of curvature ) . the non - local radius at a given node is defined to be the smallest among all the radii of circles drawn through that node and all pairs of other nodes except for its adjacent nodes",
    "( see also the caption of fig . [ fig4](b ) ) .",
    "unlike unconstrained matter for which pairwise interactions suffice , for a chain molecule , it is necessary to define the context of the object that is part of the chain .",
    "this is most easily carried out by defining a local cartesian coordinate system ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) whose three axes are defined by the tangent to the chain at that point , the normal , and the binormal which is perpendicular to both the other two vectors .",
    "a study@xcite of the experimentally determined native state structures of proteins from the protein data bank@xcite reveals that there are clear amino acid aspecific geometrical constraints on the relative orientation of the local coordinate systems due to sterics and also associated with amino acids which form hydrogen bonds with each other ( see fig .",
    "[ figa3 ] in appendix d ) .",
    "recently@xcite , we have carried out monte carlo simulations of short _ homopolymers _ , chains made up of just one type of amino acid , subject to these geometrical constraints and physically motivated interaction energies , a local bending energy penalty , @xmath10 , an overall hydrophobicity , @xmath11 , and effective hydrogen bond energies ( see appendix e for details about the refined tube model and the simulations ) .",
    "the resulting phase diagram and the associated structures for short homopolymers of length @xmath12 are depicted in fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] . in keeping with the behavior of the archetype tube discussed earlier , in the vicinity of the swollen phase , one obtains",
    "distinct assembled tertiary structures , quite akin to real protein structures , on making small changes in the interaction parameters .",
    "the striking similarity between the observed structures and real protein structures suggests that our model captures the essential ingredients responsible for the limited menu of protein native structures .",
    "the marginally compact phase has distinct structures including a single helix , a bundle of two helices , a helix formed by @xmath13-strands , a @xmath13-hairpin , three - stranded @xmath13-sheets with two distinct topologies and a @xmath13-barrel like conformation .",
    "these structures are the stable ground states in different parts of the phase diagram .",
    "furthermore , conformations such as the @xmath14 motif are found to be competitive local minima .",
    "the specific structure depends on the precise values of the local radius of curvature penalty ( a large penalty forbids tight turns associated with helices resulting in an advantage for sheet formation ) and the strength of the hydrophobic interactions ( a stronger overall attraction leads to somewhat more compact well - assembled tertiary structures ) .",
    "the topology of the phase diagram allows for the possibility of conformational switching leading to the conversion of an @xmath15-helix to a @xmath13-topology on changing the hydrophobicity parameter analogous to the influence of denaturants or alcohol in experiments@xcite .",
    "we now turn to a study of some of the consequences of our postulate that the tube is a useful paradigm for understanding protein structures and behavior .",
    "we will benchmark these against experimental evidence to assess their validity .",
    "there have been many previous studies of proteins from a physics point of view@xcite .",
    "the standard approach is to assume an overall attractive short range potential which serves to lead to a compact conformation of the chain in its ground state . in the absence of amino acid specificity or when one deals with a homopolymer",
    ", there is a huge number of highly degenerate ground states comprising all maximally compact conformations with high barriers between them ( see fig . [ fig8](a ) ) .",
    "the ground state degeneracy and the height of the barriers grow exponentially with the length of the homopolymer .",
    "the role played by sequence heterogeneity is to break the degeneracy of maximally compact conformations , leading to a unique ground state conformation which , of course , depends on the amino acid sequence . yet , for a typical random sequence , the energy landscape is still very rugged and is virtually the same as in fig.[fig8](a )",
    ". a model protein moving in such a rugged landscape can be subject to trapping in local minima and may not be able to fold rapidly , so that glassy behavior may ensue due to such trapping .",
    "bryngelson and wolynes@xcite suggested that there is a principle of minimal frustration at work for well - designed sequences in which there is a nice fit between a given sequence and its native state structure carving out a funnel - like landscape@xcite which promotes rapid folding and avoids the glassy behavior ( fig .",
    "[ fig8](c ) ) .",
    "indeed , given a sequence of amino acids , with all the attendant details of the side chains and the surrounding water , one obtains a funnel - like landscape with the minimum corresponding to its native state structure .",
    "each protein is characterized by its own landscape . in this scenario ,",
    "the protein sequence is all - important and the protein folding problem , besides becoming tremendously complex , needs to be attacked on a protein - by - protein basis .",
    "in contrast , our model calculations show that the large number of common attributes of globular proteins@xcite reflect a deeper underlying unity in their behavior . at odds with conventional belief ,",
    "a consequence of our hypothesis is that the gross features of the energy landscape of proteins result from the amino acid aspecific common features of all proteins .",
    "this landscape is _ ( pre)sculpted _ by general considerations of geometry and symmetry ( fig . [ fig8](b ) ) .",
    "our unified framework suggests that the protein energy landscape ought to have thousands of broad minima corresponding to putative native state structures .",
    "the key point is that for each of these minima the desirable funnel - like behavior is already achieved at the homopolymer level _ in the marginally compact part of the phase diagram _",
    "( see fig .",
    "[ fig7 ] ) .",
    "the self - tuning of two key length scales , the thickness of the tube and the interaction range , to be comparable to each other and the interplay of the three energy scales , hydrophobic , hydrogen bond , and bending energy , in such a way as to stabilize marginally compact structures , also provide the close cooperation between energy gain and entropy loss needed for the sculpting of a funnelled energy landscape .",
    "recent work has shown that the rate of protein folding is not too sensitive@xcite to large changes in the amino acid sequence@xcite , as long as the overall topology of the folded structure is the same . furthermore , mutational studies@xcite have shown that , in the simplest cases , the structures of the transition states are also similar in proteins with similar native state structures",
    ".    sequence design@xcite would favor the appropriate native state structure over the other putative ground states leading to a energy landscape conducive for rapid and reproducible folding of that particular protein .",
    "nature has a choice of 20 amino acids for the design of protein sequences .",
    "a pre - sculpted landscape greatly facilitates the design process .",
    "indeed , within our model , we find that a crude design scheme , which takes into account the hydrophobic ( propensity to be buried ) and polar ( desire to be exposed to the water ) character of the amino acids , is sufficient to carry out a successful design of sequences with one or the other of the structures shown in fig .",
    "the matching of the hydrophobic profile of the designed sequence to the burial profile@xcite ( as measured by the number of neighbors within the range of the hydrophobic interaction ) leads to the correct fold in a monte carlo simulation . as examples , the sequence hpphhphhpppppphhphhppppp , with @xmath16 uniformly for all residues , @xmath17 for contacts between h and h , and @xmath18 for other contacts , has as its ground state the two - helix bundle structure ( fig . [",
    "fig7]h ) whereas hphhhpppphhpphhpppphhhpp prefers the @xmath19 motif ( fig .",
    "[ fig7]j ) .",
    "it is interesting to note that the @xmath19 motif is only a local minimum in the phase diagram of a homopolymer but is stabilized by the designed sequence . also , as is seen experimentally",
    ", many protein sequences adopt the same native state conformation@xcite .",
    "once a sequence has selected its native state structure , it is able to tolerate a significant degree of mutability except at certain key locations@xcite .",
    "furthermore , multiple protein functionalities can arise within the context of a single fold@xcite .",
    "one of the successful methods of protein structure prediction is based on threading@xcite .",
    "the basic idea is entirely consistent with our findings ",
    "one uses pieces of native state structures of longer proteins as possible candidate structures of a shorter protein  the technique is simpler because instead of determining the structure from ab - initio calculations , one merely has to select from among the putative native state structures .",
    "the documented success of the threading method confirms that each protein does not fashion its own native state structure but merely selects from the menu of pre - determined folds .",
    "a range of human diseases such as alzheimer s , spongiform encephalopathies and light - chain amyloidosis lead to degenerative conditions and involve the deposition of plaque - like material in tissue arising from the aggregation of proteins@xcite .",
    "in the case of prions @xcite , one observes a transition from @xmath15 to @xmath13 rich structures which favors aggregation and causes bovine spongiform encephalopathy ( bse ) disease .",
    "it has been argued@xcite that the formation of amyloid fibrils occurs in a hierarchical way starting from a chiral @xmath13-strand .",
    "the resulting structures arise from a competition between the free energy gain from the aggregation and the elastic energy cost of the distortion .",
    "a variety of proteins not involved in these diseases also form aggregates very similar to those implicated in the diseased state@xcite .",
    "this suggests@xcite that the tendency for proteins to aggregate is a generic property of polypeptide chains with the specific sequence of amino acids playing at best a secondary role .",
    "can one understand this general tendency of proteins to form amyloids within our framework ?",
    "let us recall the semi - crystalline polymer phase which one obtains when the tube is sufficiently long ( or when there are many interacting tubes ) and is subject to attractive interactions leading to compaction .",
    "in this phase , the tube is stretched out locally with nearby sections parallel to each other ( or has the tubes stacked parallel to each other in a periodic arrangement ) and does not have the richness we associate with protein native state structures . returning to the protein , one may ask whether there are structures which are the analogs of those found in the semi - crystalline phase .    in order to assess the role played by the interaction between multiple short proteins ,",
    "let us first consider our model homopolymer chain made up of 36 identical amino acids in the marginally compact phase of the refined tube model ( see section iv and appendix e ) with the hydrophobic parameter and the local bending energy penalty chosen so that the ground state is a single long helix .    on making two incisions in the chain to create three distinct chains each containing 12 amino acids",
    ", the ground state of the system appears to be a bundle of three helices ( see fig . [",
    "fig9](d ) ) .",
    "this helix structure however is stable only at very low temperatures . at intermediate temperatures , close to but lower than the temperature of the specific heat peak",
    ", it is destabilized in favor of aggregated @xmath13-helices ( figures [ fig9](a ) and [ fig9](b ) ) or sandwiches of @xmath13-sheets ( fig . [ fig9](c ) ) , due to entropic effects . cutting a single chain into parts increases the entropy of the system .",
    "unbonded chains are more flexible and this promotes the formation of interchain hydrogen bonds .",
    "the @xmath13-sheet structures also show an increased flexibility comparing to the helix bundle , and they have better kinetic accessibility from a disordered globule .",
    "while the appearance of @xmath13-sheet conformations in the case of three chains seems to have an entropic origin , it seems likely that the ground state of a system of multiple chains does in fact consist of aggregated @xmath13-sheets .",
    "indeed simulations of 5 or 10 chains have shown that @xmath13-structures are the most likely choice ( see fig .",
    "[ fig10 ] ) .",
    "the formation of @xmath13-sheet structured protein aggregates is favoured with respect to other possible aggregates such as helix bundles ( which we actually detect in our simulations , see fig . [ fig9](d ) ) . in the latter case hydrogen bonds",
    "are saturated within a single helix so that aggregation is driven exclusively by the effective hydrophobic attraction between different helices .",
    "on the other hand , for structures such as those shown in fig .",

    "the @xmath15-helix is increasingly favored and the @xmath13-sheet is never the global free energy minimum .    that a @xmath13-sheet structure is a significant competitor with a large basin of attraction in a region where the stable phase is a helix ( see fig .",
    "[ fig11 ] ) reinforces the possibility that the interaction between several proteins could stabilize the formation of extended hydrogen bonded @xmath13-sheets via the aggregation of individual chains ( see @xcite for experimental evidence that the increased propensity for extended single chain @xmath13-conformations as the temperature is increased could indeed drive the formation of @xmath13-aggregates ) .",
    "these kinds of structures , which resemble the basic structures associated with amyloid fibrils , thus seem to belong to the general class of pre - determined folds , but this time for multiple proteins , and ought to be seen ubiquitously in generic proteins@xcite .",
    "this suggests that the key to the prevention of such aggregates is the stabilization of helices in such proteins and evolutionary mechanisms such as proteasomes , molecular chaperones@xcite and ubiquitination enzymes@xcite .",
    "our results show the generic tendency for multiple chains of amino acids to form aggregated amyloids rather than maintain their protein - like shape .",
    "interestingly , nature has , on suitable occasions , thwarted the tendency of a single long chain to form amyloid by dividing the protein into substantially independent domains which fold autonomously and are then assembled together .",
    "this suggests that the variety of protein folds increases with length up to a certain point at which they are supplanted by the formation of domains or amyloids .    in a recent",
    "paper , fandrich and dobson@xcite suggested that `` amyloid formation and protein folding represent two fundamentally different ways of organizing polypeptides into ordered conformations .",
    "protein folding depends critically on the presence of distinctive side chain sequences and produces a unique globular fold .",
    "by contrast , .... amyloid formation arises primarily from main chain interactions that are , in some environments , overruled by specific side chain contacts . ''",
    "our results are in complete accord with the suggestion that amyloid structures may arise from the generic properties of the proteins with the details of the amino acid side chains playing a secondary role .",
    "however , our work suggests that instead of an `` inverse side chain effect in amyloid structure formation''@xcite , there is a unifying theme in the behavior of proteins . just as the class of cross - linked @xmath13-structures",
    "are determined from geometrical considerations , the menu of protein native state structures is also determined by the common attributes of globular proteins : the inherent anisotropy associated with a tube and the geometrical constraints imposed by hydrogen bonds and steric considerations .      traditionally , the framework of evolution in life works through two aspects of organization called the genotype and the phenotype .",
    "the genotype is the heritable information encoded in the dna , which is translated through the rna molecules into proteins .",
    "the phenotype is valuable for adaptation and at the molecular level plays a key role in natural selection .",
    "one conventionally assumes that there is a selection of phenotypes which leads to an enhancement in the numbers of the genotype .",
    "furthermore , mutations of the genotype lead to the possibility of new phenotypes .",
    "let us consider the situation at two levels : the sequence level ( which is the genotype because it is a direct translation from the evolving dna molecules ) and the structure level , which we can think of as the phenotype .",
    "as pointed out by maynard - smith@xcite , as the sequence undergoes mutation , there must be a continuous network that the mutated sequences can traverse without passing through any intermediaries that are non - functioning .",
    "thus , one seeks a connected network in sequence space for evolution by natural selection to occur .",
    "there is considerable evidence , accumulated since the pioneering suggestion of kimura@xcite and king and jukes@xcite , that much of evolution is neutral .",
    "the experimental data strongly supports the view that the `` random fixation of selectively neutral or very slightly deleterious mutants occur far more frequently in evolution than selective substitution of definitely advantageous mutants.''@xcite .",
    "also `` those mutant substitutions that disrupt less the existing structure and function of a molecule ( conservative substitutions ) occur more frequently in evolution than more disruptive ones''@xcite .",
    "thus while one has a `` random walk '' in sequence space that forms a connected network , there is no similar continuous variation in structure space@xcite .",
    "these facts are in accord with our result of a pre - sculpted energy landscape that is shared by all proteins and has thousands of local minima corresponding to putative native state structures  not too few because that would not lead to sufficient diversity and not too many because that would lead to too rugged a landscape with little hope that a protein could fold reproducibly and rapidly into its native state structure . indeed",
    ", many proteins share the same native state fold and often the mutation of one amino acid into another does not lead to radical changes in the native state structure underscoring the fact that it is not the details of the amino acid side chains that sculpt the energy landscape but rather some overarching features of symmetry and geometry that are common to all proteins . in this respect ,",
    "the phase of matter that comprises the native state structures is one that is possibly determined by physical law rather than by the plethora of microscopic details in analogy with the limited menu of possible crystal structures .",
    "anfinsen@xcite wrote in 1972 , `` biological function appears to be more a correlate of macromolecular geometry than of chemical detail . ''",
    "there has been much recent progress in extracting information on biological function and protein interactions@xcite from the structure of proteins and the complexes they form@xcite . a protein structure chosen from the predetermined menu of folds",
    "contains information on the topology of the folded state .",
    "additionally , one can glean information on the nature of the exposed surface , crystal packing , and the existence of clefts or other geometrical features ( which are often the active sites of enzymes ) . the picture is completed by knowledge of the sequence of amino acids that folds into the structure using which one can infer the amino acid composition of the exposed surfaces , the location of mutants and conserved residues and evolutionary relationships . for some structural families , function",
    "is highly conserved , whereas for others , one can use the types of information described above to guess the function@xcite .",
    "biological reactions are accelerated by factors more than a billion by enzymatic proteins .",
    "enzymes not only provide for great catalytic efficiency but are also extremely specific in their function .",
    "the principal mechanism@xcite underlying the tremendous enhancement of the reaction rate by the enzymes is the lowering of the free energy of the transition state of the reaction through their specific binding to the substrate or the reactant(s ) . in its native state ,",
    "an enzyme adopts a structure chosen from the menu of pre - determined folds .",
    "strikingly , only a small part of this structure is important for the enzymatic action .",
    "generally , there are a few amino acids , associated with the active site , which are responsible for the catalytic activity . in close proximity",
    ", one also finds the substrate binding site which provides the specificity , often through the classic lock and key mechanism .",
    "an illustration of enzymatic action and the role of molecular evolution is provided by the protease family of proteins . in a living cell",
    ", there is turnover of proteins with new proteins being continually synthesized along with the degradation of existing proteins .",
    "proteins responsible for degradation through the hydrolysis of peptide bonds are called proteases . under physiological conditions ,",
    "peptide bonds are stable for a period of around a hundred years .",
    "the proteases are able to enhance the degradation rate selectively by factors of around a billion .",
    "there are several classes of proteases including serine proteases ( such as chymotrypsin , a digestive enzyme ) with a very reactive serine residue , cysteine proteases ( such as papain , which is a digestive enzyme derived from papaya ) with cysteine playing the role of serine , aspartyl proteases ( such as renin which controls blood pressure ) which employs a pair of aspartate groups and metalloproteases ( such as collagenase responsible for collagen degradation in osteo - arthritic cartilage ) , which use a bound metal ion such as zinc to accelerate the hydrolysis .    in serine proteases ,",
    "the catalytic triad comprises three amino acids , serine , histidine and aspartate , bound to each other through hydrogen bonds , whose presence leads to the proton being moved away from the serine and the creation of a reactive alkoxide ion .",
    "the same triad is implicated in all serine proteases .",
    "indeed , an example of convergent evolution is provided by subtilisin ( an enzyme that resembles chymotrypsin in its action and is made by certain soil bacteria ) and its family members , which possess the catalytic triad but have a quite different structure from chymotrypsin .",
    "here nature uses different folds from the pre - sculpted energy landscape which , on appropriate sequence design , have the same catalytic triad and perform similar tasks .",
    "the limited menu of possible protein folds provides a marvellous opportunity for divergent evolution .",
    "this corresponds to proteins whose native state structure and the catalytic triad are the same but with distinct differences in the nature of the binding site .",
    "the binding site in chymotrypsin is adjacent to the active site and is a hydrophobic cavity which facilitates hydrolysis of the peptide bonds on the carboxyl side of aromatic or large hydrophobic amino acids such as trp , tyr , phe , met and leu .",
    "relatively small changes in the amino acid sequence , which maintain both the native state structure and the active triad lead to other proteins such as trypsin ( a digestive protein made in the pancreas which cleaves after positively charged amino acids lysine and arginine due to a change of one of the hydrophobic amino acids in the binding cavity to a negatively charged aspartic acid ) , elastase ( a protein made both in the pancreas and by white blood cells in which two glycines in the binding cavity are replaced by much larger amino acids valine and threonine allowing the enzyme to specifically target elastin , which is an important building block of blood vessel walls and ligaments  elastase is able to cleave proteins after a glycine and alanine because of the small size of the binding cavity ) , thrombin ( a larger enzyme , the tail - end of which bears a significant similarity to the sequence of amino acids of chymotrypsin and trypsin and cleaves proteins only at arginine - glycine linkages ; thrombin is a complex regulatory protease which converts a usually soluble blood protein fibrinogen into the insoluble fibrin causing a blood clot and the cessation of bleeding ) , plasmin ( an enzyme which cleaves proteins after lysine and arginine and dissolves blood clots ) , cocoonase ( which also cleaves after lysine and arginine in the silk strands of the cocoon after the transformation of a caterpillar into a silk moth ) and acrosin ( an enzyme which plays a pivotal role in fertilization by creating a hole in the protective sheath around the egg and allowing sperm - egg contact ) .    as we have seen , evolution along with natural selection allow nature to use variations on the same theme facilitated by the rich repertory of amino acids to create enzymes that are able to catalyze a remarkable array of diverse and complex tasks in the living cell .",
    "the key point , of course , is that in order for molecular evolution to work in this manner , one needs the constant backdrop of folds shaped not by the sequence but determined by physical law . were the folds not immutable and themselves subject to darwinian evolution , the possibility of creating so many subtle and wonderful variations on the same theme would not exist",
    "the pre - sculpted landscape is the crucial feature that leads to a predetermined menu of immutable folds .",
    "it is known that key functional sites exhibit a high degree of conservation@xcite .",
    "interestingly , co - evolutionary analysis has been useful in identifying protein - protein interactions@xcite .",
    "structural similarity , independent of evolutionary homology , can be the key reason why proteins with different folds share some commonality in enzymatic activity or ligand binding@xcite .",
    "conversely , there are protein structures such as the tim barrel@xcite which are very versatile and are able to house proteins that are able to carry out multiple functionalities . even though the proteins are able to perform diverse catalytic tasks , nagano et al.@xcite",
    "find that the active site is generally found at the c - terminal end of the barrel sheets and that there are  striking structural superpositions \" of the metal - ligating and catalytic residues .",
    "nooren and thornton@xcite have pointed out that `` the structure and affinity of a ppi ( protein - protein interaction ) is tuned to its biological function and the physiological environment and control mechanism .",
    "ppis presumably evolve to optimize ` functional ' efficacy .",
    "this does not necessarily involve strong interactions . clearly",
    ", weak transient interactions that are efficiently controlled are also very important in cellular processes . ''",
    "there are several attractive features of the picture we have developed based on the tube - protein hypothesis .",
    "first , protein structures lie in the vicinity of a phase transition to the swollen phase which confers on them exquisite sensitivity , especially in the exposed parts of the structure , to the effects of other proteins and ligands .",
    "the flexibility of different parts of the protein depend on the amount of constraints placed of them from the rest of the protein@xcite . from this point of view",
    ", it is easy to understand how loops , which are not often stabilized by backbone hydrogen bonds can play a key role in protein functionality .",
    "it is useful to reconsider how nature uses the variety of amino acids for sequence design .",
    "the existence of a pre - sculpted energy landscape with broad minima corresponding to the putative native state structures and the existence of neutral evolution demonstrates that the design of sequences that fit a given structure is relatively easy leading to many sequences that can fold into a given structure .",
    "this freedom facilitates the accomplishment of the next level task of evolution through natural selection : the design of optimal sequences , which not only fold into the desired native state structure , but also are fit in the environment of other proteins .",
    "a useful protein is one that can interact with other proteins in a synergistic manner and at the same time is not subject to the tendency to aggregate into the harmful amyloid form .",
    "this suggests that protein engineering studies aimed at improving enzymatic function ought to be carried out in a two step manner : first , the family of sequences that fold into a desired target structure need to be selected and a finer design needs to be carried out in the context of the substrates and the other proteins that the target protein interacts with . unlike the generality of geometry and symmetry that leads to the menu of native state folds , what we have here is a problem of chemistry acting within the fixed background of the physically determined structures .",
    "these considerations suggest that , when the information becomes available , protein - protein interaction networks@xcite can be fruitfully viewed not only as the interactions between proteins but also as the interactions between the structures that house them .",
    "the characteristics required for protein native state structures to be targets of an evolutionary process are stability and diversity .",
    "stability is needed because one would not want to mutate away a dna molecule able to code for a useful protein , and diversity , in order to allow evolution to build complex and versatile forms .",
    "the mechanism for natural selection arises naturally in this context  dna molecules that code for amino acid sequences that fit well into one of these predetermined folds and have useful functionality thrive at the expense of molecules that create sequences that are not useful . indeed , in this picture ,",
    "sequences and functionality evolve in order to fit within the constraints of these folds , which , in turn , are immutable and determined by physical law .",
    "progress occurs in science through the use of constructive hypotheses with a careful assessment of their consequences .",
    "experiments not only provide valuable hints for selecting between competing hypotheses but are also the ultimate test of a given hypothesis .",
    "there are strong hints from protein experiments that the protein - tube hypothesis is valid .",
    "it provides a unification of the various aspects of all proteins : one obtains a pre - sculpted energy landscape with relatively few folds , one can rationalize how a protein might fold in a cooperative manner into its native state conformation , there is the possibility of straightforward design of optimal sequences that fit into a desired structure , the structures are in a marginally compact phase in the vicinity of a phase transition and have the flexibility needed for biological function , and one can understand the formation of amyloids and the role played by the protein structures as a molecular basis for natural selection .",
    "protein sequence design provides an optimal fit of the sequence with one among the menu of pre - sculpted conformations .",
    "the question arises of course as to how a given sequence is able to reach its native state conformation or its home starting from its denatured conformation .",
    "the answer to this question entails the understanding of its denatured state@xcite . unlike the native state which is a somewhat tightly bound set of marginally compact conformations",
    ", one envisions the denatured state as an ensemble of somewhat open conformations that the protein adopts when it is not under physiological conditions .    while one may naively think that the denatured state is devoid of any interesting features , recent work has underscored the possibility that the number of accessible conformations is severely reduced compared to a random chain@xcite leading to biases in the chain direction that persist over the entire length of the protein@xcite .",
    "indeed , shortle@xcite has argued that `` long - range structure , which can not be removed by strongly denaturing conditions , could arise predominantly from local steric hindrance . ''",
    "he goes on to state that `` not only does the ribosome determine the primary structure of each protein it makes , it also establishes the topological space in which that protein chain will be confined for the rest of its existence . ''",
    "we build on these insights and the presumed validity of our protein - tube hypothesis by making a second hypothesis that just as there is a one - way correspondence between a sequence and its native state structure , there could exist a similar correspondence between the sequence and its denatured state . in this view",
    ", the denatured state can thought of as an address of the native state conformation and lies within its basin of attraction .",
    "unlike the native state , the denatured state has a larger entropy and comprises somewhat open conformations . because of this , water plays a quite crucial role in the denatured state .",
    "both the above factors lead to local interactions@xcite playing a more important role than non - local interactions in the denatured state . as can be seen from fig .",
    "[ figa3](a ) , the local bending energy term is amino acid specific . in addition , in the spirit of the tube model , one might ask whether there are extra geometrical constraints between the local frames of reference ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] ) of neighboring amino acids along the chain .",
    "( as discussed earlier , at the non - local level , hydrogen bonds linking different parts of the chain do place geometrical constraints on the reference frames associated with these locations . ) physically , such correlations arise from the fact that in addition to the @xmath21 atom that we have considered as a surrogate for the amino acid , all amino acids but glycine have a @xmath22 atom to which the side chain is attached . in a chain of coins ( see section ii ) , this corresponds to breaking the symmetry in the plane of the coin .",
    "thus one would quite generally expect that side chain interactions would lead to correlations between the local coordinate frames of nearby amino acids along the sequence@xcite .",
    "remarkably , the local steric constraints@xcite and the hydrogen bonds@xcite act in concert and both promote helices and sheets in the native state .",
    "one can ask what the effects of such a local interaction are in the absence of any non - local interaction promoting the compaction of the chain . let us first consider a homopolymer made of just one kind of amino acid .",
    "a simple chain molecule with a local bending constraint leads to a tangent - tangent correlation , @xmath23 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig6 ] for the definition of the tangent vector ) , that decays exponentially in @xmath24 .",
    "adding a local binormal - binormal interaction term leads quite generally ( see the example in appendix f ) to the tangent - tangent correlation decaying exponentially with sequence separation but being modulated with oscillatory behavior .",
    "this generic behavior underscores the fact that the class of denatured conformations are not merely featureless but rather already have short - range structure built into them .",
    "indeed , there is a clear reduction in the entropy , due to the short - range binormal - binormal interaction , which is reflected in the oscillations .",
    "the situation is vastly more interesting when one considers a specific sequence of amino acids in its denatured state .",
    "it is clear that one ought to have amino acid specific correlations between neighboring coordinate frames which reflect the nature and size of the side chains .",
    "an amino acid like proline with its cumbersome side chain configuration can lead to strong constraints in its vicinity whereas glycine which lacks the @xmath25 atom and a side chain can provide great flexibility@xcite and act as a joker in a card game . even if such correlations reflect small but systematic deviations from the average behavior@xcite , these can build up in a very specific way along the sequence leading to a clear imprinting of the native state conformation even in the denatured state . in this context , it is interesting to note that shortle@xcite has shown that `` denaturation by at least three different agents  truncation , urea and acid  gives rise to essentially the same persistent native - state like topology '' .",
    "furthermore , the alteration of the denatured state by even a single mutation@xcite provides further evidence for the structure inherent in the denatured state .",
    "we have shown that the menu of native state structures is determined from generic considerations .",
    "sequence specificity is key in determining whether a given sequence fits particularly well into one of these conformations .",
    "because the menu is large ( thousands of conformations ) , one has diversity .",
    "however , because the menu is not too large , a well - designed sequence is able to fold rapidly into its native state conformation .",
    "our hypothesis is that local sequence - specific interactions alone lead to a denatured state which is a reflection of the native state .",
    "the denatured state lies in the basin of attraction of the native state and the folding process simply entails the action of the appropriate non - local interactions in leading to the protein adopting the native state conformation .",
    "the situation is somewhat reminiscent of a content - addressable memory@xcite in which partial information is converted by the brain to recover the complete information .",
    "such content addressable memories@xcite as well as the energy landscape@xcite suitable for prebiotic evolution@xcite have been modeled through spin glasses@xcite .",
    "the energy landscape of spin glasses is also characterized by diversity and stability arising from randomness and frustration which is quite distinct from the the physical mechanisms of short tubes in the marginally compact phase . in conventional spin glasses , randomness , which plays",
    "a role somewhat similar to amino acid specific interactions in proteins@xcite , through frustration sculpts an energy landscape with many local minima .",
    "indeed , a non - random exchange interaction between spins would lead to periodic order with much simpler behavior . in spin glasses , starting from a random spin configuration , it is hard to reach a specific local minimum unless the exchange constants are tuned in a clever way as in a content addressable memory .",
    "the landscape is not invariant on changing the exchange interactions and can be fashioned at will . for proteins , on the other hand , our analysis shows that a rich landscape is obtained even in the absence of any sequence heterogeneity and the nature of the ground states is determined by geometry and symmetry and is therefore immutable@xcite .",
    "an interesting consequence of the type of denatured state described above along with the existence of the pre - sculpted landscape is the possibility of disordered proteins@xcite  sequences that are in temporally fluctuating denatured form but which fold in the presence of distinct substrates to carry out vital multiple functionalities . in our picture , these sequences need appropriate stabilizing influences to fold . in the absence of these influences ( substrates ) ,",
    "the protein is denatured and is located , colloquially , on the fence between different native state structures .",
    "given that finite size effects are severe for proteins , the presence of different substrates ( leading to different boundary conditions ) would not only favor one competing structure over the others but also result in folding to that structure .",
    "the simultaneous existence of the distinct folds in the energy landscape allows the protein to choose from among them depending on the precise nature of the stabilizing influence .",
    "symmetry and geometry place strong constraints on the types of infinite sized crystal structures and there are exactly 230 distinct space groups in 3 dimensions@xcite .",
    "proteins are finite sized objects .",
    "our analysis demonstrates that the same kind of symmetry and geometrical considerations lead to a finite number of protein folds .",
    "this number grows with the size of the protein but is limited by the fact that proteins beyond a characteristic length either form autonomous domains or amyloids . unlike the crystalline state of matter , proteins are characterized by an inherent anisotropy due to their tube - like character .",
    "a given crystalline structure transcends the material that is housed in it ",
    "common salt adopts the face - centered - cubic lattice structure as also the well - packed cannonballs of kepler@xcite .",
    "likewise , different sequences of proteins can be housed in the same protein fold and yet be able to perform different functionalities@xcite .",
    "protein structures are modular in form being simple assemblages of helices and strands connected by tight turns .",
    "the unified picture leads to a single free energy landscape with two distinct classes of structures .",
    "the amyloid phase is dominated by @xmath13-strands linked to each other in a variety of forms whereas the native state structure menu is an assembly of @xmath15-helices and @xmath13-structures .",
    "nature has exploited these native state structures in the context of the work horse molecules of life .",
    "the selection mechanism for genetic evolution at the molecular level lies in the ability of the protein encoded by the gene to fold well into one of the predetermined folds and have useful function .",
    "unfortunately , however , the proximity of this beautiful phase to the generic amyloid phase underscores how life can easily malfunction as soon as aggregational tendencies of proteins come to the fore .",
    "one can not but marvel at the robustness of life .",
    "an imperfect analogy to the protein problem is a township consisting of around a thousand houses ( protein structures ) , each with its own distinctive style ( topology ) , determined by geometry and symmetry .",
    "the form of a house ( structure ) is the basis of useful functionality .",
    "a person ( protein ) whose tastes ( sequence ) are ( is ) especially matched to a given style of house ( native state structure ) would choose to live in it . of course",
    ", many people ( proteins ) with similar though not identical tastes ( sequences ) might choose the same style of house ( native state structure ) .",
    "if a person were to arrive in this town , how would she / he know which house to move into ?",
    "one way would be to explore all the house styles until the dream house is identified . a vastly more efficient situation would occur if the person arrives at the township in the vicinity of the house that she / he will eventually occupy .",
    "this would require that the location of the starting point ( the denatured conformation ) is encoded by the tastes of the person ( the sequence ) and is within the basin of attraction of her / his dream home ( native state structure ) .",
    "this , as yet unproven , scenario would greatly facilitate the folding of a protein into its native state structure accounting for its `` surprising simplicity''@xcite .",
    "the protein problem , which lies at the intersection of many disciplines , is highly complex .",
    "evolution complicates the situation even further .",
    "human design allows for an engineer to devise entirely new ways of accomplishing certain tasks  a classic example is the replacement of vacuum tubes with semiconductor transistors .",
    "nature does not have this luxury in evolutionary design .",
    "nature takes what she has , tinkers with it and builds on it .",
    "thus the notion of optimal design is not particularly relevant and the future is very strongly correlated with the present and the past . a slightly different turn of events could have lead to conspicuously different life forms .",
    "this picture of nature muddling along through evolution combined with the inherent complexity of proteins makes the problem very daunting . yet , within this complexity , there is a stunning simplicity provided by the fixed backdrop of the protein folds determined by physical law in the context of which sequences and functionalities are shaped by evolution .",
    "+    we conclude by revisiting the classic theoretical work of pauling@xcite and ramachandran@xcite . both of them considered the protein backbone which is the common part of all proteins .",
    "pauling and his coworkers explored the types of structures that are consistent with both the backbone geometry and the formation of hydrogen bonds .",
    "they predicted that helices and sheets are the structures of choice in this regard ( fig .",
    "[ fig12](a , b ) ) .",
    "ramachandran and his coworkers carried out their pioneering work more than a decade after pauling .",
    "they considered the role of excluded volume or steric interactions between the adjacent amino acids in reducing the available conformational phase space ( fig .",
    "[ fig12](c ) ) .",
    "astonishingly , the two significantly populated regions of the ramachandran plot correspond to the @xmath15-helix and the @xmath13-strand .",
    "even though hydrogen bonds and sterics are not related to each other , they are both promoters of helices and sheets .",
    "is this concurrence of events a mere accident ?",
    "the marginally compact phase of short tubes has helices and sheets as its preferred structures . in order for nature to take advantage of this phase of matter , proteins , which obey physical law ,",
    "may have been selected to conform to the tube geometry .",
    "hydrogen bonds serve to enforce the parallelism of nearby tube segments , a feature of both helices and sheets while sterics emphasizes the non - zero thickness of the tube and serves to position it in the marginally compact phase . because the marginally compact phase is a finite size effect ,",
    "proteins tend to be relatively short compared to conventional macromolecules including dna .",
    "indeed , proteins seem to be a vivid example of the adaptation of nature to her own laws .    in his insightful book , ` the fitness of the environment ' ,",
    "henderson extended the notion of darwinian fitness to argue that  the fitness of environment is quite as essential a component as the fitness which arises in the process of organic evolution .",
    "\" strikingly , the chemistry of proteins ensures that they are self - tuned to occupy the marginally compact phase of short tubes .",
    "one can not but marvel at how several factors , the steric interactions ; hydrogen bonds which provide the scaffolding for protein structures ; the constraints placed by quantum chemistry on the relative lengths of the hydrogen and covalent bonds and the near planarity of the peptide bonds ; and the key role played by water all reinforce and conspire with each other to place proteins in this novel phase of matter .",
    "proteins have proved to be difficult to understand because of their inherent complexity with twenty types of amino acids and the role played by water , because they are relatively short molecules compared to generic man - made polymers and are therefore likely to be characterized by ` non - universal ' behavior , and because of the complexities associated with the random process of evolution .",
    "nevertheless , our work suggests that there is an underlying stunning simplicity . while sequences and functionalities of proteins evolve , the folds that they adopted , which in turn determine function , seem to be determined by physical law and are not subject to darwinian evolution . in that regard",
    ", these folds may be thought of as immutable or platonic .",
    "protein folds do not evolve  rather , the menu of possible folds is determined by physical law . in that sense",
    ", it is as if evolution acts in the theater of life and shapes sequences and functionalities but does so within the fixed backdrop of the platonic folds .",
    "henderson@xcite wrote  the properties of matter and the course of cosmic evolution are now seen to be intimately related to the structure of the living being and to its activities ; they become , therefore , far more important in biology than has been previously suspected .",
    "for the whole evolutionary process , both cosmic and organic , is one , and the biologist may now rightly regard the universe in its very essence as biocentric . \"",

    "will be written as @xmath219 whereas the average with respect to @xmath220 will be denoted simply as @xmath221 . in the case of a protein sequence",
    "the @xmath222 depends explicitly on the type of amino - acids in the neighborhood of the @xmath159-th position .",
    "it is this dependence that ultimately will determine the propensity of a given segment of the protein sequence to be in a given secondary structure .",
    "one can straightforwardly derive the following recursion relations :      if one wishes to calculate the correlation function @xmath224 , where @xmath225 is @xmath226 , @xmath227 , @xmath228 or any other combination of them , then one needs to introduce other correlation functions in order to have a closed ensemble of recursion equations . by defining the vector              thus given the initial condition @xmath235 , which depends only on @xmath236 , all successive @xmath230 s can be calculated recursively using eq.([rec ] ) .",
    "let us discuss the case of a uniform stretch where @xmath220 , and thence @xmath233 , does not depend on @xmath159 ( the sub - indices @xmath159 s will be omitted in this case ) .",
    "if the left and right eigenvectors of @xmath237 , @xmath238 and @xmath239 respectively , corresponding to the eigenvalue @xmath240 , form a complete basis set the general solution of eq.([rec ] ) can be written as      if all the eigenvalues are real and positive and if @xmath242 then for large @xmath24 @xmath243 and likewise for @xmath244 .",
    "on physical grounds , we expect that @xmath245 , so that the correlation functions decay exponentially with the distance measured along the chain .",
    "however it is quite common that some eigenvalues are complex . since the matrix @xmath246 is real",
    ", complex eigenvalues occur in pairs of complex conjugate values .",
    "if the pair @xmath247 ( @xmath248 and @xmath97 are both real and positive ) corresponds to the maximum modulus eigenvalue , then at large @xmath24 we get , for example , for the tangent - tangent correlation ,      where @xmath250 depends on the initial conditions .",
    "thus there is still an exponential decay with a correlation length @xmath97 ( in units of chain bond length ) , but there is also an oscillatory modulation with another length scale , @xmath251 , which corresponds to short range order along the chain ( notice that , in one dimensional systems such as our chain , long range order can not occur if the interactions are short range as in the present case ) .",
    "this type of behavior , with @xmath252 , would be expected on a stretch of chain that adopts a helical conformation with @xmath253 amino acids per turn .",
    "we end this appendix with an example of such behavior which can be worked out in full detail . for the case @xmath254 ( which corresponds to invariance under chirality flipping ) , and @xmath255",
    "is independent of @xmath159 for @xmath256 , then @xmath257 .",
    "this implies that the matrix @xmath246 becomes block diagonal with an eigenvalue equal to @xmath258 and @xmath259 decays exponentially with a correlation length @xmath260 .",
    "furthermore , since @xmath261 , one eigenvalue is zero and the remaining two are the solutions of the second order equation @xmath262 with @xmath263    thus , if @xmath264 , the two solutions are real and the tangent - tangent correlation decays exponentially to zero . on the other hand , if @xmath265 , the two solutions are complex conjugate of each other , as described above , and in the particular case we are considering , i.e. @xmath254 , one finds for all @xmath24 , that @xmath266 where @xmath267 , @xmath268 , and @xmath250 depends on the initial conditions .                                            a theorem proved by o. gonzalez and j. maddocks ( p. natl .",
