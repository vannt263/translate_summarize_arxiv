    "<S> , we put forward a feasible experimental scheme based on cold atoms in optical lattices . </S>",
    "<S> a major difficulty arises from the special geometry required in the brickwork state . </S>",
    "<S> we propose to circumvent this problem by starting from the 2d cluster state ( square lattice geometry ) and reducing it to the brickwork state . in theory , this can be achieved by the break `` and bridge '' operations with measurement postselection as shown in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : break_bridge ] ( see supplemental material @xcite for more details ) . in experiment , postselection is again unnecessary with regard to sampling , but one incurs an additional cost of measuring in both @xmath11 and @xmath40 basis ( the measurement pattern is still translation - invariant though ) . as a by - product , this procedure offers a concrete one - instance protocol to produce classically non - simulatable distribution from the cluster state .     before measured in @xmath40 and @xmath11 basis respectively to perform the break and bridge operations . ]    </S>",
    "<S> a complete experimental procedure is as follows . </S>",
    "<S> first , create a mott - insulator state of cold atoms in 2d optical lattices with a central core of unit filling . </S>",
    "<S> one atom with two relevant atomic levels ( e.g. , @xmath41 and @xmath42 hyperfine levels of @xmath43rb atoms ) can be trapped in each site forming a square lattice of qubits . </S>",
    "<S> a 2d cluster state can be created in a single operational step by controlled collisional interaction @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> the basic idea involves entangling neighboring atoms by spin - dependent transport together with controlled on - site collisions , which has been realized in experiment @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> after generating the cluster state , one needs to impose the rotation angle pattern onto each qubit . </S>",
    "<S> this requires the ability to address individual atoms with diffraction - limited performance . </S>",
    "<S> single - site addressing is currently one of the state - of - the - art quantum control techniques in cold atom experiments @xcite . in particular , by using a digital micro - mirror device , it is possible to engineer holographic beam shaping with arbitrary amplitude and phase control @xcite . to imprint the individual phases , </S>",
    "<S> one can make use of spin - dependent ac stark shifts @xcite with beam amplitude patterns given by the rotation angles . </S>",
    "<S> the amplitude hologram controls the strength @xmath44 and realizes the second term in the hamiltonian in eq .  . </S>",
    "<S> finally , spin measurements can be performed on each site , with single - site - resolved imaging techniques @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> because some spins have to be measured in @xmath40 basis , they should be rotated by individual addressing techniques before all atoms can be measured in @xmath11 basis .    </S>",
    "<S> _ _ simulation and certification with variation distance errors.__so far , we have shown that our ising spin model is classically intractable with multiplicative error bounds . </S>",
    "<S> similar to what have been attained in boson sampling @xcite and iqp @xcite , we can also prove classical hardness to variation distance error bounds if we assume the worst - case  hardness result can be extended to average - case . more specifically , </S>",
    "<S> let us define the partition function of @xmath45 to be @xmath46 , setting the imaginary temperature unit as @xmath47 . in supplemental material @xcite , we prove that approximating @xmath48 by @xmath49 to a mixture of multiplicative and additive errors such that @xmath50    with @xmath51 is # -hard in the worst - case . </S>",
    "<S> our classical intractability result requires lifting the # -hardness of the estimation from the worst - case to the average - case : picking any @xmath52 fraction of instances @xmath5 , it is still # -hard . </S>",
    "<S> this conjecture is similar to the one used in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite except that they reduced the mixture of errors to simply multiplicative errors . </S>",
    "<S> the idea of the proof also resembles that in boson sampling @xcite and iqp @xcite , both of which used stockmayer s theorem @xcite and markov s inequality to convert variation distance bounds to constraints on each probability in a subset of all probabilities ( eq .  ( [ eq : mix_error ] ) ) .    </S>",
    "<S> thus , with reasonable assumptions , our ising spin model is also classically intractable with variation distance bounds . using techniques similar to those in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , we can in addition certify the correct functioning of a quantum device , with only a polynomial number of local measurements . </S>",
    "<S> suppose @xmath53 is the distribution sampled from our quantum device with the final state @xmath54 ( state before measurement ) ; the ideal ones are denoted as @xmath3 and @xmath55 . </S>",
    "<S> the total variation distance between distributions @xmath3 and @xmath53 can be bounded by  @xcite : @xmath56 where @xmath57 is the trace distance between states @xmath55 and @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> hence , if we can bound the trace distance @xmath58 , we can also bound the total variation distance . </S>",
    "<S> note , however , this does not allow us to estimate @xmath4 in experiment : statistical errors always kick in to thwart any polynomial - time efforts to estimate the distribution due to the exponential suppression of some @xmath4 . </S>",
    "<S> we bypass statistical errors by assuming the correctness of quantum mechanics . </S>",
    "<S> to sample from @xmath53 in experiment though , measurement imperfections may cause deviations in variation distance . however , </S>",
    "<S> if measurement imperfections on each spin are local and bounded by @xmath59 @xcite , we can still correctly certify the quantum device . </S>",
    "<S> below , we show how to bound @xmath60 by a polynomial number of local measurements .    as a graph state , the brickwork state in fig .  </S>",
    "<S> [ fig : brickwork](a)(c ) , is the unique ground state of the 4-local hamiltonian @xmath61 each qubit @xmath35 is connected to at most three neighboring ones , and the energy gap from the ground state is @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> the ideal state @xmath55 is the brickwork state acted by some single qubit rotations @xmath63 . </S>",
    "<S> it is therefore the unique ground state of the hamiltonian @xmath64 this hamiltonian is still @xmath65-local , with ground state energy gap @xmath62 . </S>",
    "<S> using the weak - membership quantum state certification protocol in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite , one can measure each local term of @xmath66 by a polynomial number of times to obtain a good estimation of @xmath67 averaged over @xmath54 </S>",
    "<S> . the estimation will be efficient due to hoeffding s bound and the finite norm of each local term . </S>",
    "<S> since the ground state energy gap is constant , @xmath68 implies a finite component of excited states is present in @xmath54 . </S>",
    "<S> conversely , a small @xmath67 will be able to bound @xmath60 . </S>",
    "<S> more quantitatively , we show in supplemental material @xcite that with confidence level @xmath69 , using @xmath70 measurements on each local term is sufficient to certify @xmath71 , provided the measurement imperfections on each spin are bounded by @xmath59 . </S>",
    "<S> similar hardness and certification results hold if we start from the cluster state as in our experimental proposal  @xcite . in that case , </S>",
    "<S> 5-local measurements are needed .    the iqp certification protocol developed in ref .  </S>",
    "<S> @xcite requires a much stronger quantum simulator than the iqp simulator itself since they need to generate all the history states @xcite . </S>",
    "<S> in contrast , our certification protocol only requires preparing the state @xmath54 itself . </S>",
    "<S> this is relevant in light of demonstrating quantum supremacy @xcite using practical quantum many - body systems , instead of resorting to a universal quantum simulation device .    _ </S>",
    "<S> _ conclusions.__in summary , we have introduced a translation - invariant ising spin model and shown that it is classically intractable unless the polynomial hierarchy collapses . our model has the advantageous one - instance property and is amenable to experimental implementation . </S>",
    "<S> a cold - atom realization of our protocol is proposed . </S>",
    "<S> classical intractability and certification of the quantum machine based on variation distance bounds are also discussed . </S>",
    "<S> this forms a complete picture of using our model to demonstrate quantum supremacy , and it may shed light on the likely exponential gap in computational power between a classical and a quantum machine .    </S>",
