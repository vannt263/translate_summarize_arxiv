    "@xcite also studied a sample of spectroscopically confirmed lbgs at @xmath3 from @xcite , and found that about 33% of lbgs with strong ly@xmath0  emission have double ly@xmath0  emission peaks , strengthening the above conclusion .",
    "the outline of this paper is as follows . in ",
    "2 we briefly describe the physical model of ly@xmath0  emitters @xcite , our simulations , and how we construct the merger trees . in  3 , we estimate the merger fraction of ly@xmath0  emitters , discuss the effect of mass resolution in the simulation on our results , and compare our model predictions with the observations . in ",
    "4 we quantify the uncertainties associated with the predictions , and we summarize our results in  5 .",
    "our method is based on carrying out dark matter ( dm ) only simulations , and then populating the halos from these simulations with ly@xmath0  emitters according to a simple physical model presented in @xcite .",
    "this model uses a single parameter to successfully reproducing many observed properties of ly@xmath0  emitters , including their luminosity functions , stellar masses , stellar ages , star formation rates , and clustering from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the central tenet of this model is that the ly@xmath0  luminosity is proportional to the star formation rate @xmath20 @xmath21 which in turn is proportional to the mass accretion rate @xmath20 sfr = f@xmath22 here , f@xmath23 and @xmath24 are the star formation efficiency ( i.e. converting baryonic mass to stars ) , and the baryonic mass accretion rate . as we use dm only simulations , the baryonic mass accretion rate is obtained by converting dm mass accretion assuming universal ratio of baryonic to dm densities . for more details about this model , we refer the reader to @xcite .      in order to implement this method",
    ", we carried out a large n - body dm cosmological simulation ( hereafter gadget-1024 ) , with the gadget2 @xcite code .",
    "we generated the initial conditions for the simulation using second - order lagrangian perturbation theory @xcite . in this simulation",
    "we use @xmath25 dm particles , each particle with a mass m@xmath26 m@xmath27 evolved in a comoving volume of ( 102 mpc)@xmath28 . using a friends - of - friends ( fof ) halo finder @xcite , we identify dm halos that contain 100 or more dm particles .",
    "this corresponds to a minimum halo mass m@xmath29 m@xmath27 .",
    "we then generate catalogs , for redshifts from @xmath30 to @xmath31 , which contain positions of halos , their dm mass , and unique ids of each individual particle that belongs to a given halo .",
    "these unique particle ids are later used to track halos between two epochs . throughout this chapter",
    "we assumed a flat @xmath32cdm cosmology with parameters @xmath33=0.233 , @xmath34=0.721 , @xmath35=0.0462 , @xmath36=0.71 , @xmath37=0.817 where @xmath33 , @xmath34 , @xmath35 , @xmath36 , and @xmath37 correspond , respectively , to the matter density , dark energy density , and baryonic density in units of the critical density , the hubble parameter in units of 100 km s@xmath38 mpc@xmath38 , and the rms density fluctuations on the 8 mpc @xmath39 scale , in agreement with wmap @xcite five year results @xcite .      to construct a simulated population of ly@xmath0  emitters , we first calculate the amount of dm mass that is accreted by each halo in time t@xmath40=30 myr @xcite .",
    "this time interval was chosen so as to match with the average stellar population of ly@xmath0  emitters .",
    "this mass accretion rate is then converted to the ly@xmath0  luminosity as described in section 2.1 . while , in general , we expect every halo to accrete more mass with time , we find that some halos lose mass ( negative accretion ) which is due to the limitation of halo - finding technique .",
    "we correct for this simulation noise by counting the number of halos that have negative mass accretion in each mass bin and subtracting this from corresponding counts in the positive mass bins ( see @xcite for more details ) . with this procedure",
    "we now have ly@xmath0  emitter catalogs from @xmath19 to @xmath31 .",
    "it is possible that the mass resolution in our simulation might affect our results . in order to carefully assess this effect",
    ", we also used the millenium - ii simulation @xcite which has a larger volume , and a higher halo mass resolution .",
    "in particular , it follows @xmath41 particles with each particle having a dm mass @xmath42 m@xmath27 in a simulation volume of ( 141 mpc)@xmath28 .",
    "furthermore , in this simulation , each halo is identified by an unique i d allowing us to follow the same procedure as applied to our gadget-1024 simulation .",
    "we use millenium - ii simulation only to investigate the simulation mass resolution effect since the time step between each output is about ten times larger , making it unsuitable for our final comparisons with observations .",
    "as described in section 2.1 , each ly@xmath0  emitter is assigned a luminosity based on its mass accretion rate .",
    "this mass accretion can occur when either two or more _ progenitors _ ( halos at time step @xmath43 - 1 ) merge into a single _ descendent _ ( halo at a later time step @xmath43 ) , or when a single progenitor evolves into a single descendent ( see figure 1 ) .",
    "= 8.5 cm    we then classify each merger into one of three categories : major merger , minor merger , or smooth accretion , based on the progenitor mass ratio .",
    "in particular , we define each of these cases as : + ( 1 ) major merger : @xmath44 , + ( 2 ) minor merger : @xmath45 and + ( 3 ) smooth accretion : @xmath46 + where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the masses of the most massive , and second - most massive progenitors associated with a single descendant ( see figure 1 ) . in the case where a descendent halo has a single progenitor halo , by default ,",
    "this halo is assigned a smooth accretion mode . using",
    "the above criteria we now have a merger tree , @xmath20 each descendent halo , and hence each ly@xmath0  emitter , has been associated with the mode of mass accretion @xmath20 major merger , minor merger or smooth accretion .",
    "using this method we are able to calculate the fraction of ly@xmath0  emitters that have undergone major mergers , minor mergers , and smooth accretion . here , we remind the reader that each descendent halo hosts one ly@xmath0  emitter . in effect , every descendent halo is an ly@xmath0  emitter with its luminosity proportional to the mass accretion rate .",
    "we define the merger fraction as the ratio of number of ly@xmath0  emitters formed from mergers in a given luminosity bin to the total number of ly@xmath0  emitters in that bin .",
    "thus , @xmath49 where @xmath50 is the number of ly@xmath0  emitters formed from mergers , and @xmath51 is the total number of ly@xmath0  emitters in that luminosity bin .",
    "figure 2 shows the merger fractions of ly@xmath0  emitters that have formed from major mergers , minor mergers , and smooth accretion , at @xmath18 . the major merger , and minor merger fractions are shown in solid and dotted lines respectively , while the long dashed line indicates the fraction of ly@xmath0  emitters formed from smooth accretion .",
    "the shaded region shows the poisson errors on the major merger fraction .    from figure 2",
    "it is evident that at @xmath18 , about @xmath4 of ly@xmath0  emitters are formed from major mergers . in other words the dominant mode of mass accretion , and hence star - formation in nearly @xmath4 of @xmath52 emitters , occurs through major mergers , while remaining @xmath53 of ly@xmath0  emitters accrete their mass through minor mergers and smooth accretion combined .",
    "note that the poisson errors dominate the bright end of the ly@xmath0  luminosity .",
    "our results might not be fully reliable below @xmath54 where we see a steep decline in the major merger fraction .",
    "this effect might be partly due to lower halo mass resolution . to understand and quantify this effect of lower halo mass resolution",
    ", we now compare our results from figure 2 with the millenium - ii simulation which has about 2.6 times more volume , and nearly forty times better mass resolution .",
    "in addition , we also investigate the effect of stellar ages ( t@xmath40 ) of ly@xmath0  emitters on our predictions .",
    "= 8.5 cm      using the same procedure as described in section 2 , we constructed a ly@xmath0  emitter catalog from the millenium - ii simulation , at a common redshift , @xmath56 between the two simulations . in figure 3",
    "we compare the results from the two simulations .",
    "the top panel are the results from our gadget-1024 simulation while the bottom panel shows the merger fraction obtained from millenium - ii simulation .",
    "the vertical dotted lines show the luminosity below which the apparent decline in the major merger fraction is caused due to lower halo mass resolution .",
    "this luminosity range shift towards lower ly@xmath0  luminosity in the millennium - ii simulation ( lower panel ) which has a better mass resolution . also , at the bright end of the luminosity axis , the fluctuation in the merger fraction is lesser in the millenium - ii simulation due to the larger volume .",
    "thus , better mass resolution is needed to estimate the merger fractions reliably at lower luminosities , and a larger simulation volume to minimize the noise at the brighter luminosities .",
    "hereafter , in our analysis , we consider only those ly@xmath0  emitters that have ly@xmath0  luminosity @xmath57 .",
    "we now study the effect of t@xmath40on our model predicted results . for our model",
    "ly@xmath0  emitters the luminosity is proportional to the mass accretion rate ( @xmath58 / t@xmath40 ) where we assumed a fixed t@xmath40=30 myr which corresponds to the average stellar ages of ly@xmath0  emitters .",
    "while this is true for average population , from observations it is inferred that this stellar age ranges from 1 myr to even hundred myr ( e.g. * ? ? ?",
    "figure 4 shows the major merger fractions of our model ly@xmath0  emitters at @xmath19 for t@xmath40=30 , 60 , and 100 myr .",
    "while the stellar ages have changed by a factor of 3 , we find no or little change in major merger fraction .",
    "thus , our model predictions are independent of the stellar ages of ly@xmath0  emitters .",
    "in preceding sections we have shown that the predicted merger fractions are affected by the mass resolution , and that there is no dependence of t@xmath40on the predicted merger fractions .",
    "we now investigate the redshift evolution of merger fraction of ly@xmath0  emitters .",
    "figure 5 shows the redshift evolution of major merger fraction ( left panel ) , minor merger fraction(middle panel ) , and smooth accretion ( right panel ) from @xmath18 to @xmath19 .",
    "the major merger fraction ( left panel ) , and smooth accretion ( right panel ) show a mild evolution with redshift . on the other hand ,",
    "the minor merger fraction is nearly constant . at @xmath18 the average major merger fraction @xmath59 .",
    "similarly , the average fraction of minor mergers ( middle panel ) and smooth accretion ( right panel ) are @xmath60 , and @xmath61 respectively . at @xmath19 , the major merger fraction is higher with @xmath62 .",
    "thus , at higher redshifts , the mass accretion and hence the star - formation in a significant fraction of the ly@xmath0emitters occurs through major and minor mergers .      in this section",
    "we compare only major merger fractions with the observations since it is extremely difficult to identify minor mergers from observations especially at higher redshifts .",
    "only recently , has it been possible to estimate the observed merger fraction of ly@xmath0  emitters at high - redshifts .",
    "for example , at @xmath63 @xcite have studied morphological properties of ly@xmath0  emitters in the cosmos field using hst / acs .",
    "only two out of about 50 ly@xmath0  emitters show clear signs of extended features , an indication of either interacting or merging galaxies .",
    "however , there is a large uncertainty in estimating merger fraction from these observations due to their shallow survey depth .    in figure 6",
    ", we compare this result with our model predictions .",
    "the downward arrow indicates the upper limit on the merger fraction at @xmath63 . at this redshift ,",
    "our model predicted major merger fraction is about @xmath5 . while comparing our model predictions with the observations we have accounted for the observed limiting ly@xmath0  luminosity at corresponding redshifts .    at slightly lower redshift @xmath64 , @xcite studied morphologies of nine ly@xmath0  emitters in hudf . to quantify the morphologies , they used @xmath65 , and @xmath66 parameters @xcite and found that nearly @xmath67 have clumpy or complex structures . visually , about @xmath68 sources look morphologically disturbed or as ongoing mergers , while nearly @xmath69 of the sources can not be reliably identified as mergers .",
    "this observed merger fraction is nearly same as our model prediction .",
    "@xcite studied morphological properties of about 120 @xmath70 3.1 ly@xmath0  emitting galaxies in the rest - frame ultra - violet band .",
    "they found that at least @xmath71 of the total ly@xmath0  emitters contain multiple components which might indicate that these are either individual star - forming regions within a single galaxy , a merged system or ongoing mergers .",
    "since it is very difficult , due to their compact sizes ( e.g. malhotra et al 2011 , bond et al 2011 ) , to definitely conclude whether the multi - component ly@xmath0  emitters are the remnants of mergers or if these are individual star - forming regions in a single system , we have shown the merger fraction by upward and downward arrows indicating uncertainties in both directions . their classification is based on counting the number of components in a fixed aperture . at @xmath18 ,",
    "our model predicted major merger fraction is about @xmath4 , much higher than the observed fraction .",
    "however , in section 4 we show that , some of this difference between model predictions and observations can be attributed to the definition of major merger mass ratio .    at lower redshift , @xmath72",
    ", @xcite studied morphologies of ly@xmath0  emitters in the groth00 and sirtffl00 fields .",
    "they found that @xmath73 of the ly@xmath0  emitters show signs of ongoing mergers .",
    "based on the above comparisons , there is some discrepancy between our model prediction and observations . in the following section ,",
    "we investigate the uncertainty due to the mass ratio used to define a merger .",
    "we now vary the progenitor mass ratio criteria from 1:3 to 1:2 , @xmath20 major mergers are now defined as those for which @xmath74 , while for @xmath75 , they are classified as minor mergers . all other ly@xmath0  emitters with their progenitor halo mass ratio @xmath76 are defined as smooth accreting . in figure 7",
    "( see also figure 2 ) we show the predicted merger fraction dependence on the progenitor mass ratio definition .    by changing the progenitor mass ratio from 1 : 3 to 1 : 2 , the major ( minor ) merger fraction drops ( increases ) by about @xmath77 .",
    "thus , it is clear that the predicted merger fraction of ly@xmath0  emitters depends on the the progenitor mass ratio definition , and one needs to be careful when comparing model predicted merger fractions with the observations since the merger defining mass ratio influences the merger fractions .",
    "= 8.5 cm    = 8.5 cm      in addition to the above uncertainty , the observed merger fraction depends on the timescale , t@xmath78 ( observability timescale ) during which a merger can be identified as a merger .",
    "for example , if t@xmath78 is shorter than t@xmath40 , the time during which a galaxy is observed as an ly@xmath0  emitter , then the observed merger fraction will be underestimated . according to our model ( see equation 1 ) , merging of two galaxies results in an ly@xmath0  emitter with its ly@xmath0  luminosity proportional to the mass accretion rate .",
    "if , say two galaxies merge on a dynamical timescale ( @xmath79 ) , then it will be observed as a merger for a period @xmath79=t@xmath78 .    using @xmath80 , where @xmath81 is the average overdensity of the collapsing object , we find that at @xmath823 , @xmath83 myr , much larger than t@xmath40=30 myr .",
    "thus , we expect to miss no or little merger fraction of ly@xmath0  emitters at @xmath84 , due to the observability timescale .",
    "the dynamical time , however is nearly half with @xmath85 myr at @xmath86 .    as can be seen from the above discussion",
    "that while the predicted merger fraction is not affected by the merger observability timescale , there is some uncertainty in the predicted merger fraction due to the defining mass ratio .",
    "in addition , a large uncertainty is due to the shallower survey depths especially at higher - redshifts .",
    "motivated by our earlier work @xcite based on a simple physical model of ly@xmath0  emitters , combined with a large dark matter cosmological simulation , we have predicted the major merger , minor merger , and smooth accreting ly@xmath0  emitter fraction from @xmath11 to @xmath2 .",
    "the model presented in @xcite , different from many of the earlier models in that the star - formation rate is proportional to the mass accretion rate rather than the total halo mass , has been successful in reproducing many observed physical properties including the luminosity functions , stellar ages , star formation rates , stellar masses , and clustering properties of ly@xmath0  emitters from @xmath3 to @xmath2 .",
    "we carefully constructed the merger tree from @xmath2 to @xmath3 , accounting for the uncertainties in the halo finder . in this merger tree , each descendent halo was associated with its progenitor(s ) , and based on the progenitor mass ratio , each merger was classified as either major , minor merger or smooth accretion .",
    "we also carefully assessed how our predicted results might be affected by several parameters including halo mass resolution , defining merger mass ratio , stellar ages of ly@xmath0  emitters , and the merger observability timescale .",
    "we summarize our key results below :    * at @xmath3 , about @xmath4 of ly@xmath0  emitters accrete their mass through major mergers , and this fraction increases to about 50% at redshift @xmath2 . on the other hand , at this redshift , the minor mergers and smooth accretion contribute equally in the remaining 50% of the ly@xmath0  emitters .",
    "thus , at higher redshifts , mergers play an important role in mass assembly and hence the star - formation in majority of the ly@xmath0  emitters .",
    "* we also compared our model predicted major merger fraction with the observations and found that our model over - predicts the major merger fraction .",
    "this discrepancy can be resolved if we take into account the uncertainties in defining the merger classification mass ratio . by changing the major merger mass ratio from 3:1 to 2:1",
    ", we found that the predicted major merger fraction decreases by about @xmath77 .",
    "we predict that future , deeper imaging surveys and using spectroscopic methods such as the one demonstrated in @xcite , should find @xmath87 merger fraction of ly@xmath0  emitters at high - redshifts ."
