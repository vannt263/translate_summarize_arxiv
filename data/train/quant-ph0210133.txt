    "the ideas of zero range potential ( zrp ) approach were recently developed to widen limits of the traditional treatment by demkov and ostrovsky @xmath4 and albeverio et al . @xmath5 .",
    "the advantage of the theory is the possibility of obtaining an exact solution of scattering problem .",
    "the zrp is conventionally represented as the boundary condition on the matrix wavefunction at some point .",
    "alternatively , the zrp can be represented as pseudopotential ( breit @xmath6 ) .",
    "on the other hand , darboux transformation ( dt ) allows to construct in natural way exactly solvable potentials .",
    "general starting point of the theory goes up to matveev theorem ( see @xcite ) .",
    "the transformation can be also defined on the base of covariance property of the schrdinger equation with respect to a transformation of wavefunction and potential ( matveev and salle @xmath7 ) .",
    "darboux formulas in multi - dimensional space could be applied in the sense of andrianov , borisov and ioffe ideas @xcite . in the circumstances ,",
    "dt technique can be used so as to correct zrp model .",
    "we attempt to dress the zrp in order to improve the possibilities of the zrp model .",
    "we use notations and some results from @xcite .",
    "dt modifies the generalized zrp ( gzrp ) boundary condition ( section @xmath8 ) and creates a potential with arbitrarily disposed discrete spectrum levels for any angular momentum @xmath9 . in the section @xmath10 we consider @xmath11-representation for a non - spherical potential so as to dress a multi - centered potential , which includes @xmath0 zrps . as an important example , we consider electron scattering by the @xmath1 and @xmath2 structures within the framework of the zrp model ( section @xmath12 ) . in section @xmath13 we present the our calculations for the electron-@xmath3 scattering and discuss them .",
    "let us start from the simplest case of a central field .",
    "then angular momentum operator commutates with hamiltonian and therefore wavefunction @xmath14 can be expanded in the spherical waves @xmath15 where @xmath16 , @xmath17 is initial particle direction , @xmath18 are partial waves , and @xmath19 are phase shifts .",
    "consider the radial schrdinger equation for partial wave with angular momentum @xmath9 .",
    "the atomic units are used throughout the present paper , i.e. @xmath20 and born radius @xmath21 .",
    "@xmath22 @xmath23 @xmath24 denotes differential operator , and @xmath25 are hamiltonian operators of the partial waves .",
    "this equations describe scattering of a particle with energy @xmath26 .",
    "the wavefunctions @xmath18 at infinity have the form @xmath27 let us consider gzrp in coordinate origin .",
    "this potential is conventionally represented as boundary condition on the wavefunction ( see @xmath28 ) @xmath29 where @xmath30 are inverse scattering lengths .",
    "the potential @xmath31 and therefore wavefunctions @xmath18 can be expressed in terms of the spherical functions @xmath32 where spherical functions @xmath33 are related to usual bessel functions as @xmath34 , @xmath35 . in the vicinity of zero they have the asymptotic behavior @xmath36 , and @xmath37 . to substituting the equation @xmath38 into the boundary condition",
    "we obtain the elements of @xmath11-matrix @xmath39 the bound states correspond to the poles of the @xmath11-matrix ( i.e the zeros of the denominator @xmath40 ) , which lie on the imaginary positive semi - axis of the complex @xmath41-plane .",
    "it is obvious that bound state , with orbital momentum @xmath9 , exists only if @xmath42 ( elsewise an antibound state exists ) and has the energy @xmath43 .",
    "thus , spectral problem for gzrp is solved for any value @xmath41 . on the other hand , the equations ( [ e ] )",
    "are covariant with respect to dt that yields the following transformations of the potentials ( coefficients of the operator @xmath25 ) @xmath44 and the wavefunctions @xmath18 @xmath45 where @xmath46 are some solutions of the equations @xmath47 at @xmath48 , and @xmath49 are real parameters , which can be both positive or negative .",
    "the dt @xmath50 combines the solutions @xmath18 and a solution @xmath46 that corresponds to another eigen value @xmath51 . repeating the procedure we obtain a chain of the integrable potentials @xmath52 . in general , dressed potential @xmath53 is real for real function @xmath46 .",
    "the next step in the dressing procedure of the zero - range potential ( @xmath31 ) is a definition of the free parameters of the solutions @xmath46 .",
    "suppose the prop functions @xmath46 satisfy the boundary conditions @xmath54 with @xmath55 .",
    "in the simplest case of @xmath56 we have @xmath57 and @xmath58 the dt @xmath50 gives rise to the following requirement on dressed wavefunction @xmath59 the dressed potential @xmath60 is given by @xmath61 it is regular on semiaxis only if @xmath62 . in the limiting case at @xmath63",
    "we obtain long - range interaction @xmath64 , which can be regular on semiaxis only if @xmath65 .",
    "assuming @xmath66 we get @xmath67 ( trivial transformation ) , and boundary condition can be obtained by the substitution : @xmath68 to dress free wave @xmath69 we obtain zrp at the coordinate origin .",
    "thus , zrp can be also introduced in terms of dt .",
    "to consider transformation with parameter @xmath70 we obtain regular solution @xmath71 and tangent of phase shift is @xmath72    in the other cases asymptotic of the functions @xmath73 at zero is given by @xmath74 it is clear that the each dt introduces short - range core of centrifugal type ( which depends on angular momentum @xmath9 ) in the potential . in this situation",
    "the boundary conditions on the dressed wavefunctions @xmath75 $ ] require modification .",
    "thus , in the case @xmath76 the boundary conditions become @xmath77 and in the case @xmath78 we obtain @xmath79    in the generalized case , zrp with angular momentum @xmath9 generates also @xmath80 complex poles of the @xmath11-matrix , which correspond the quasi - stationary states ( resonances ) .",
    "the dts @xmath50 with the parameters @xmath49 results in the @xmath11-matrix elements for dressed gzrp @xmath81 we can use darboux transformation in order to add ( or remove ) poles of the @xmath11-matrix .",
    "the principal observation allows to built a zero - range potential eigen function in the multi - center problem .",
    "let us consider @xmath0 zrps at the points @xmath82 and interaction @xmath83 .",
    "the wavefunction @xmath14 can be expressed in terms of the ( outgoing - wave ) green function , defined by the equation @xmath84 the second ( ingoing - wave ) green function is defined by @xmath85 .",
    "the partial waves @xmath86 , defined by @xmath87 for multi - centered target which includes @xmath0 zrps and interaction @xmath83 can be expressed as a superposition of the green functions @xmath88 in which @xmath89 are phase shifts , @xmath90 denote @xmath11-matrix orthonormal eigenfunctions , @xmath91 are real numbers .",
    "they naturally generalize the spherical partial waves @xmath92 for a non - spherical potential @xmath93 . expanding the partial waves @xmath86 at the infinity we obtain the expressions for @xmath90 @xmath94 where @xmath95 is wavefunction for potential @xmath83 , and @xmath96 is scattering amplitude .",
    "scattering amplitude for potential @xmath83 and @xmath0 zrp is given by @xmath97 by the imposition of the boundary conditions @xmath54 the calculation of the partial waves is reduced to the solution of the following system @xmath98 in which we use @xmath99 where @xmath100 , @xmath101 .",
    "the tangents @xmath102 can be found from compatibility condition of this system . in simplest case @xmath103",
    "@xmath104 the system @xmath105 is reduced to the usual equations of zrp theory @xmath93 . in order to construct functions",
    "@xmath106 and @xmath107 for dressed potential , i.e. for @xmath83 , we need to write down green function as single - center expansion over spherical harmonics . in the simplest case ,",
    "when the prop function is @xmath108 , the green function is given by @xmath109 where @xmath110 the function @xmath111 has the following asymptotic at infinity @xmath112 the integral cross section can be readily derived using the optical theorem : @xmath113 thus , averaged integral cross section is given by @xmath114",
    "for purpose of illustration we consider scattering problem for a dressed multi - center potential .",
    "the multi - center scattering within the framework of the zrp model was investigated by demkov and rudakov @xmath93 ( 8 centers , cube ) , drukarev and yurova @xmath116 ( 3 centers in line ) , szmytkowski @xmath117 ( 4 centers , regular tetrahedron ) .",
    "let structure @xmath1 contains @xmath0 identical scatterers , which involve only @xmath119 waves .",
    "denote position vector of the scatterer @xmath120 by the @xmath121 .",
    "suppose , for the sake of simplicity , the distance between any two scatterers @xmath122 and @xmath120 is @xmath123 .",
    "there are three such structures in three - dimensional space - dome @xmath124 , regular trihedron @xmath125 , regular tetrahedron @xmath126 .",
    "the partial waves @xmath127 and phases @xmath89 can be classified with respect to symmetry group representation , degeneracy being defined by the dimension of the representation @xmath93 .",
    "the structures @xmath124 , @xmath125 , @xmath126 belong to the @xmath128 point groups respectively .",
    "the equation @xmath105 leads to algebraical problem @xmath129 the phases can be readily found from compatibility condition of this system . to factorize the determinant we derive the expressions for the phases @xmath130 @xmath131 thus , assuming @xmath132 we obtain the phases of a regular tetrahedron @xmath117 .",
    "the partial and integral cross sections can be expressed as @xmath133      the structures @xmath2 can be used , for instance , to study a slow electron scattering by the polyatomic molecules like @xmath135 , @xmath136 , @xmath137 , etc .",
    "let @xmath138 denote the position vectors of the scatterers @xmath139 and @xmath140 denotes the position vector of the scatterer @xmath141 .",
    "the scatterers @xmath139 are situated in vertices of a regular structure @xmath1 , i.e. @xmath123 . suppose , for the sake of simplicity , the distance between the scatterer @xmath141 and any scatterer @xmath139 is @xmath142 .",
    "therefore the position of the scatterer @xmath141 perfectly fixed only if @xmath132 ( geometric center of the tetrahedron , @xmath143 ) .",
    "the partial waves are given by the equation @xmath127 , where the summation should be performed over the @xmath144 .",
    "the constants @xmath91 and phases can be derived analytically .",
    "thus , we obtain the phases @xmath145 where @xmath146 is inverse scattering length of the scatterers @xmath139 .",
    "the @xmath147 obey the quadratic equation @xmath148 where @xmath149 indicates inverse scattering length of the scatterer @xmath141 . in the limiting case when the distance between @xmath139 and @xmath141 scatterers is very large ,",
    "i.e. @xmath150 , the expression for @xmath151 becomes @xmath152 and @xmath153 .",
    "this situation corresponds to independent scattering on the structure @xmath1 and scatterer @xmath141 .",
    "the tangent of @xmath154 also reduces to @xmath155 for structure @xmath1 in the limit @xmath156 .",
    "the integral cross sections for @xmath3 ( closed - shell ground - state @xmath157 ) are plotted in fig .",
    "@xmath158 for a number of values of @xmath159 , which are regarded as constant in the range of interest .",
    "the present calculations were carried out with @xmath160 .",
    "our calculations were made within the framework of the zrp model and hence they are not expected to be correct for low impact energies ( i.e for energies @xmath161 ev ) where polarization effects ( @xmath3 spherical polarizability @xmath162 ) are known to be important . because induced polarization potentials are always attractive , including polarization algebraically increases the computed phases ( @xmath163 at @xmath164 ) and therefore decreases the integral cross section .",
    "thus , fig .",
    "@xmath158 clearly shows that polarization effects reproduce the deep minimum ( ramsauer - townsend minimum near @xmath165 ev ) seen in the experimental data @xmath166 and numerical calculations @xmath167 , which are incomparably smaller in the our calculations .",
    "the ics can be corrected by the zrps dressing .",
    "fig . @xmath168",
    "show ics for dressed @xmath169 structure . in our calculation , the parameters @xmath170 , @xmath171 were used . in the higher collision energies our cross section ( fig .",
    "@xmath158 ) differs from the experimental results in size but coincides in shape .",
    "it is known that role of the higher partial waves is important at the higher collision energies . thus , taking into consideration the @xmath172 waves for the scatterers @xmath139 and @xmath141 we can add in partial waves and improve the agreement both in size at the higher energies and in the position of shape resonance .",
    "we demonstrate the posibilities of dt in multi - center scattering problem .",
    "thus , these transformations allow to correct the zrp model at low energies . in the limiting case @xmath63",
    "dt induces the long - range forces @xmath173 depending on angular momentum and leads to singularity in the cross section at zero energy .",
