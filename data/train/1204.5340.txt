    "the cores of globular clusters contain a very dense stellar population reaching up to 10@xmath4 stars pc@xmath5 .",
    "they are test laboratories for studying the dynamics in dense environments and provide crucial information on the evolution of the cluster . encounters and direct collisions between core cluster stars are highly probable leading to a variety of exotic species of stellar objects such as close interacting binaries , pulsars , x - ray sources and blue stragglers ( bs ) .",
    "the globular cluster cores are also potential hosts of intermediate mass black holes ( @xcite ) , which may be revealed by the dynamics of the stars in their very inner regions . resolving the core stellar population",
    "is required to establish the existence and determine the mass of any central compact object .",
    "studies of the stellar populations in the globular cluster most inner regions have been conducted in the optical using the hubble space telescope ( see e.g. @xcite , @xcite ) and in the near infrared using adaptive optics systems in ground based telescopes ( see e.g. @xcite ) .",
    "m15 is one of the oldest and most massive globular clusters with an unusually compact core and a high central velocity dispersion ( @xcite ) .",
    "this cluster is particularly suitable to investigate the presence of a massive central compact object .",
    "high - resolution observations of the m15 core have already been obtained by @xcite with the hst / pc camera with the filters f336w , f555w and f785lp ( @xmath6 bands ) and by @xcite using f140w , f220w and f342w filters and the hst / foc camera .",
    "these early data were taken with aberrated optics and it was difficult to perform accurate photometry of the core stars .",
    "after post - repair hst took images of the core with the hst / wfpc2 with the filters f336w , f439w and f555w ( @xmath7 bands ) ( @xcite ) , and more data in the @xmath8 band were reported by @xcite .",
    "high resolution optical images using adaptive optics in the canada - france - hawaii telescope have been reported by @xcite .",
    "@xcite and @xcite also performed independent photometry of the data taken by @xcite and in particular , the catalogue by @xcite has been used to study blue straggler stars by @xcite .",
    "the inner region of m15 has been studied more recently using deep fuv f140lp and nuv f220w images obtained with the hst / acs camera ( @xcite ) which show the presence of horizontal branch stars , blue stragglers and white dwarfs .",
    "the development of fast readout very low noise l3ccd detectors has opened the possibility of obtaining high - resolution images of the cores of globular clusters using ground based telescopes and the lucky imaging technique ( @xcite ) . here",
    "we present lucky imaging observations in the i - band of the core of the globular cluster m15 obtained with fastcam ( @xcite ) at the 2.5 m nordic optical telescope .",
    "we report @xmath0-band photometry for 1181 sources in a radius of @xmath9 6.5 arcsec from the centre of m15 and compare with available stellar catalogues from hst .",
    "we find that the lucky imaging technique provides reliable photometric measurements for stars in crowded fields .",
    "we take advantage of this technique to study known variable stars and to search for new objects in the core .",
    "the same instrument was used recently to obtain high contrast optical imaging of substellar companions ( @xcite ) and combined with adaptive optics to produce high precision astrometry of a brown dwarf binary ( @xcite ) .",
    "observations were obtained on the night of 2008 july 25 with the fastcam instrument on the 2.5-m nordic optical telescope using the @xmath0-band filter ( 820 nm ) which matches the johnson - bessell system .",
    "fastcam was equipped with a 512 x 512 pixels l3ccd from andor technology .",
    "the optics was designed to provide a spatial scale of about 30 mas / pixel which was later determined accurately via comparison with available hst astrometry for m15 stars and using visual binaries from the washington double star catalogue ( @xcite ) .",
    "we pointed the telescope to the centre of m15 ( r.a.= @xmath10 and dec= @xmath11 ) and collected 200 series ( `` cubes '' ) of 1000 images each with individual exposures of 30 ms .",
    "these 200000 images were obtained during 2 hours 43 min of real observing time .",
    "the average seeing during this observing period was @xmath9 0.65 arcsec as measured in the final @xmath0-band image ( combining all of the i - band images without applying the shift - and - add algorithm ) .",
    "we made the raw data reduction in two steps .",
    "first , we selected the best 70 images of each cube ( 7% of the total ) as follows .",
    "we defined a circular region on the first image of a cube with a 45 pixels diameter ( 1.3 ) , centred in the brightest star ( i d 6290 in reference @xcite , it is marked with a yellow circle on the left panel of figure [ fig1 ] ) near the centre of the field .",
    "this star was always the brightest available within this circular region .",
    "we checked that in all the images the reference star was present within this region .",
    "then we identified the brightest pixel within this region for each image .",
    "we selected the 70 images with the highest values of the brightest pixel ( i.e. 7 % of the total ) .",
    "we determined the position of the brightest pixels and applied a shift - and - add algorithm to these selected images and generated one final image per cube .",
    "our shift - and - add algorithm employs integral pixel shifts ( sub - pixel shifts provide a slight improvement of order 5 % of the fwhm of the final image with respect the case of integer shifts ) . in this way",
    ", we obtained 200 images with an effective integration time of 2.1 s each .",
    "this procedure was carried out for different percent criteria and found that the best compromise between sensitivity and spatial resolution was achieved by selecting a fraction of images in the range 5 - 10% , therefore we adopted the 7% criterion .    as a second step we took a reference image from these 200 images and defined a new circular region of 45 pixels of diameter centred in the previous bright star .",
    "those images where the selected bright star was out of this region were ruled out in order to avoid too large shifts for the final combined image .",
    "only two images were ruled out of 200 .",
    "then we applied the shift - and - add algorithm again and obtained a final image of @xmath12 pixels . only in the central @xmath13 pixels",
    "there is an effective integration time of 415.8 s , due to the maximum shift applied to the images ( @xmath14 pixels ) .",
    "this central field is shown on the left panel of figure [ fig1 ] and we will focus on this region to carry out the photometric work . on the right panel we display observations of the same field with hst / wfpc2 ( central chip ) in the f555w ( v )",
    "filter ( @xcite ) .",
    "in fig . [ fig2 ] , we show the average of the light profile of 14 relatively isolated stars in our image . each stellar profile is normalised and a psf template is built with a shift - and - add algorithm at sub - pixel scales , each pixel of the psf template is shown with a point in the figure .",
    "we note the presence of a remarkable narrow core and an extended halo .",
    "this is the characteristic profile of stars in images obtained using the lucky imaging technique as described in previous work ( @xcite ) .",
    "the fwhm of the average normalised psf in our final image is 0@xmath15.1 very close to the diffraction limit of 0@xmath15.084 of the telescope at the wavelength of the observations .",
    "the normalised light profiles for two stars are shown in figure [ fig2b ] , the profile marked with red circles belongs to a star at a distance of 2@xmath15.2 from the the star that was used for image alignment and the profiles marked with crosses ( @xmath16 ) belongs to a star at a distance of 5@xmath15.1 .",
    "there are slight differences between the two which may indicate a modest amount of anisoplanicity and that the dominant turbulent layer at the time of the observations was probably at very low altitude .",
    "it should be pointed out that the stars are not perfectly round .",
    "we do not have an obvious explanation for this , in particular it could be related to guiding issues which may be at play .",
    "we also note the relatively broad azimutal distribution of fluxes in the halo of the two stars which is caused by the presence of very close weaker contaminant stars .",
    ".2 from the star that was used for image alignment and the profiles marked with crosses ( @xmath16 ) belongs to a star at a distance of 5@xmath15.1 .",
    "each point in the figures represents a pixel . ]      in order to carry out the detection of objects in our final image we applied a derivative filter to the whole image , we used the laplacian of gaussian filter , often called `` mexican hat '' , which works efficiently in dense stellar fields ( @xcite ) , @xmath17 where @xmath18 controls the width of the gaussian and x , y determine the coordinates of the pixel . in the image",
    "convolved with the `` mexican hat '' ( with @xmath19 pixel ) , the peaks are enhanced and the saddle points approach the background , so the detectability of the sources is definitely improved .",
    "the local maxima are detected on the convolved image using a threshold , set at 3 times the standard deviation of the background determined in the less crowded part of the image . in order to measure this background we divided the image into squares of @xmath20 pixels and measured the standard deviation for each .",
    "the lowest of these values was adopted as the standard deviation ( @xmath21 ) of the less crowded part of the image .",
    "we note that no region was completely free of sources .",
    "we determined the local maxima by comparison of each pixel with its 8 neighbours . in this way we generated a list of potential objects with their positions determined as the centroid of a box of @xmath22 pixels centred around each maximum . on the central panel of figure [ fig1 ]",
    "we can see the resulting convolved image .",
    "1682 objects were detected in this image of @xmath13 pixels ( @xmath23 arcsec@xmath24 ) .",
    "only a very small fraction are false detections .",
    "the spatial scale of the image was obtained from a cross - match with the available hst / wfpc2 catalogue by @xcite as described below .",
    "we first made a linear transformation of the catalogue into our list and identified 762 common pairs with @xmath25 within a tolerance of 2 pixels of fastcam .",
    "we improved the number of matches among the two datasets using a second order transformation from the @xmath26-@xmath27 plane in our image to the @xmath28r.a.-@xmath28dec .",
    "plane of the catalogue .",
    "the transformation equations modelled a zero point difference , a scale change , a rotation , a tilt , and second order distortion corrections .",
    "these transformations include 12 unknown coefficients that are solved using a least squares method @xmath29 @xmath30 with @xmath28r.a .",
    "- r.a@xmath31 , @xmath28decl .",
    "- decl.@xmath32 , @xmath28x = x - x@xmath32 and @xmath28y = y - y@xmath32 , where r.a.@xmath32 , decl.@xmath32 , x@xmath32 and y@xmath32 are taken from the object nearest to the centre in our image .",
    "using the initial list of 762 matched objects with @xmath25 we found the transformation coefficients using least squares .",
    "these coefficients were used to compute the positions of our objects in the @xmath28r.a.-@xmath28dec . plane . for each object in our list , we determined distances to the objects in the hst catalogue , the minimum of these distances determines the correlation length for the object .",
    "we assume that a fastcam object can be matched with an hst object when the correlation length is smaller than @xmath33 arcsec ( @xmath34 pixels ) .",
    "we removed from the original list used for the transformation objects with correlation length larger than @xmath33 arcsec and @xmath25 and performed an iterative process until we obtained a collection of fastcam objects which all have a correlation length smaller than such value .",
    "the final list of objects used to calculate the coefficients of the transformations have 770 objects with @xmath25 distributed uniformly over the whole image .",
    "then we used these transformations to cross - match the 1682 objects found by fastcam with objects in the catalogue of reference @xcite and finally selected those with a correlation length smaller than @xmath33 arcsec , which corresponds to 1 pixel in the central chip of hst / wfpc2 @xcite .",
    "we obtained 1481 matched stars and 201 unmatched , we note that these unmatched stars include some potential false detections in the fastcam image .",
    "in the catalogue given by @xcite and obtained from the images presented in @xcite , there are 3015 objects in the field observed by fastcam .",
    "these authors used a combined f336w , f439w and f555w image ( @xmath7 bands ) to detect stars and added manually faint stars with peak brightness below the detection threshold of the daophot / find routine .",
    "from the same set of observations but using only the @xmath35 and @xmath8 images @xcite detected 2221 objects in this field . we can increase the number of detections in our image by decreasing the threshold used in subsection 3.1 to detect local maxima . for a @xmath36 threshold",
    "we obtain 1911 objects matched with the catalogue by @xcite and 384 unmatched ; and at @xmath37 , we obtain 2275 matched and 1452 unmatched objects . in this work",
    "we restrict the study to the 1682 objects detected at @xmath38 level .",
    "we removed the false detections among the 201 unmatched objects by visual inspection and concluded that 46 out of these 201 were true stars , which included both new stars non reported by @xcite and stars with too large uncertainty in the measured positions to perform a reliable correlation . for 41 of these stars the difference between the centroid position and the location of the maximum signal in the convolved image was more than 1 pixel .",
    "this difference is mainly caused by the presence of a brighter contaminating star in the vicinity .",
    "there are 5 unmatched stars .",
    "finally , we verified that the transformation coefficients associated with tilt and second order distortion corrections were negligible , and therefore using a linear transformation was sufficient to determine a plate scale of @xmath39 mas / pixel for the fastcam image .      in order to perform photometry we use the technique adopted by @xcite which incorporates a set of standard daophot routines .",
    "firstly we construct an empirical psf by iteration . in each iterative step",
    "we construct a psf template of radius 22 pixels by averaging 14 bright and relatively isolated stars .",
    "then we remove the neighbours of these stars using the psf template from the previous iteration and calculate again the psf template of these stars . in each iteration the quality of the psf is improved because the neighbours are removed with increasing precision , convergence is reached after five iterations . from all the template functions tested the penny2 function which vary linearly with the image position provides the best approximation to the actual psf .",
    "the penny2 function is a gaussian core with a lorentzian profile , in which both components can be tilted .",
    "then the final psf template is fitted to all stars detected on the fastcam image with the allstar routine in daophot . due to the difficulty to find relatively isolated stars on the image",
    ", the psf subtraction does not work perfectly and the stars are not subtracted completely .",
    "this is because the psf used for subtraction of the flux of neighbour stars is determined locally using the brightest , nearest stars , but sometimes there are no bright stars which can help to define the local psf with very good s / n and therefore the correction may not be perfect .",
    "this prevents to carry out direct psf photometry in our image .",
    "therefore , in order to obtain accurate photometry we followed the hybrid method described by @xcite which combines direct aperture photometry and psf fitting .",
    "this method works as follows : we take a star from our list of objects and subtract the psf to each neighbouring star within a 44 pixel radius ( two times the radius of the region used to calculate the psf ) .",
    "then aperture photometry is obtained for the star using a circular aperture of radius 2.5 pixels ( 0,078 arcsec ) with a local sky background measured in a surrounding annulus .",
    "this procedure was repeated for each detected target and obtained instrumental magnitudes , i@xmath40 .",
    "the instrumental @xmath41 magnitudes were converted to the johnson @xmath0 standard system using stars in the catalogue by @xcite .",
    "these authors had transformed their @xmath42 instrumental magnitudes to johnson @xmath0 system ( @xcite ) and we directly adopted their @xmath0 magnitudes .",
    "we correlated with this catalogue using the algorithm described in subsection [ sechst ] and obtained 269 stars in common .",
    "the zeropoint of the calibration was obtained via an iterative process using only 219 stars in the magnitude range 12 - 18 .",
    "the transformation was found to be linear and no colour term was found to be significant ( figure [ fig3 ] ) .    ) vs. yanny et al.(1994 ) magnitude ( @xmath43 ) for the 269 stars in common .",
    "dashed lines are the @xmath44 dispersion , stars within the region defined by dashed lines are chosen for the zeropint calibration . ]    the number of fastcam detected stars in 0.25 mag bins as a function of @xmath0 magnitude is represented in figure [ fig4 ] .",
    "we can see that this number increases until the 19 - 19.25 mag bin , and reach stars as faint as @xmath45 .",
    "we removed 82 stars from our catalogue which had false photometry due to their proximity to much brighter stars .",
    "our catalogue provides @xmath0-band photometry of 1181 stars with @xmath46 , they are ordered from low to high @xmath0 magnitude and it is presented in its entirety in the electronic edition of mnras . for reference the first 10 entries are listed in table [ table1 ] .     magnitude . ]",
    ".fastcam @xmath0-band catalogue of the m15 core [ cols= \" > , > , > , > , > , > \" , ]      rr lyrae stars ( ids 43 , 48 , 57 , 68 , and 75 , in our catalogue ) and cepheid stars ( ids 27 , 44 and 46 ) previously reported by @xcite are marked with green circles in figure [ fig10 ] .",
    "we also detect the cataclysmic variable star ( i d 369 ) which has colours suggestive of a sx phoenicis ( sxphe ) star and note that the other known cataclysmic variable star ( v39 , @xcite ) with a magnitude of @xmath47 is very marginally detected ( 2@xmath21 level ) in our image .",
    "this object seems to have a rather blue colour when compared with previous observations at shorter wavelengths ( @xmath48 and @xmath49 ) .",
    "we have used our series of images to study the short timescale variability of stars of the previous types with @xmath0 magnitude in the range 14.5 - 16 mag . for each set of 1000 images (",
    "each obtained over a period of 30 s real time ) we generated a @xmath50 @xmath51 .",
    "200 such images were produced , each 10 consecutive images were then averaged in order to increase s / n and perform photometry on the stars of interest . the total time span for the resulting series of 20 images is of 2 hours 43 min , each image corresponding to a time interval of 8.1 min .",
    "the series of photometric measurements obtained for a selection of the rr lyrae , cepheid , and lmxb stars in our image are shown in figure [ fig14 ] .",
    "the majority of these stars show very little variability in the @xmath0-band .",
    "we note smooth trends in several of them ( i d 43 , 44 , 46 ) which are consistent with the known periods of variability . in some cases",
    ", we also detect changes among consecutive 8.1 min images which are clearly beyond the measurement errors and may be indicative of intrinsic short time variability , for instance due to pulses . remarkably , the lmxb star ac 211 did not show evidence for any significant variability on these time scales .",
    "observations of the m15 core with the 2.5-m nordic optical telescope using fastcam and the lucky imaging technique provided @xmath0-band images with spatial resolution and sensitivity close to those obtained by hst in this region .",
    "we cross - match with the published hst / wfpc star catalogues and calibrate photometrically and astrometrically our image .",
    "the number of objects recovered in our final @xmath2 fastcam image is comparable to that reported for the hst images .",
    "a catalogue of 1181 stars is presented in this paper .",
    "based on number counts the limiting magnitude of the catalogue is @xmath52 .",
    "errors in magnitudes and positions are estimated from simulations .",
    "these simulations also indicate that crowding and spatial resolution , more than sensitivity , limit the completeness of the catalogue to about one magnitude brighter . using a cmd @xmath8 vs. @xmath53",
    "we discuss the various stellar populations present in the m15 core .",
    "in particular , we identify a few new blue straggle star candidates and several new core stars which were not previously reported .",
    "we show that this imaging technique is particularly useful to investigate stellar populations in the core of globular clusters where the presence of bright stars may limit the use of more conventional techniques .",
    "lucky imaging observations of the core of m15 and other globular clusters undertaken with a baseline of several years may provide proper motions of stars in the very inner region of the clusters ( @xmath54 ) with the precision required to constrain the properties of intermediate - mass black holes .",
