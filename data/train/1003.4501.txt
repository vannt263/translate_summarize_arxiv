    "since the discovery of planets around the pulsar psr  1257 + 12 by @xcite , dusty discs around pulsars have become interesting to observers , who have been trying to detect them in the infrared ( ir ) or at ( sub-)millimeter wavelengths .",
    "most comprehensive are the searches by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "previous searches had concentrated mainly on recycled , thus formerly accreting , radio pulsars as the most likely objects to be surrounded by dusty discs .",
    "neither of the above mentioned surveys detected dust emission around the planet - hosting psr  1257 + 12 , nor did the recent search with @xmath4 at 24@xmath5 m and at 70@xmath5 m by @xcite .",
    "however , dusty discs could also be present around non - recycled neutron stars ( nss ) . following the supernova explosion , which creates the ns",
    ", some of the explosion ejecta may fail to escape and remain bound - forming a fallback disc .",
    "such fallback discs are a general prediction of current supernova models @xcite , and have been invoked by a number of authors to explain a variety of phenomena related to nss ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "recently , @xcite reported the discovery of mid - infrared emission from a cool disc around the anomalous x - ray pulsar axp 4u  0142 + 61 .",
    "@xcite interpreted their detection as a passive disc , while @xcite argued that it could also originate from an actively accreting disc . to date , axp 4u  0142 + 61 is the only isolated neutron star for which a fallback disc is believed to have been detected .",
    "such discs appear to be rare . according to @xcite fallback disc",
    "are rare because they are likely to be disrupted when the newly born ns spins rapidly through the propeller stage , at which in - flowing matter , instead of being accreted , would be expelled .",
    "the fallback discs can survive if the initial ns spin is slow enough ( @xmath6  ms at a magnetic moment of @xmath7  g @xmath8 ) .",
    "@xcite studied the effect of pulsar wind induced ablation of fallback discs .",
    "he concluded that long - lived discs could be present in many pulsars without exceeding published limits on ir luminosity .",
    "+ in the following , we report on submillimetre observations of rxj1856.53754 , which is the brightest and closest member of a class of nss neglected so far in the search for circumstellar discs , the x - ray thermal isolated neutron stars .",
    "they are peculiar because they show pure thermal soft x - ray spectra without any ( confirmed ) non - thermal emission , especially no confirmed radio emission ; for reviews , see @xcite or @xcite .",
    "these objects have periods in the range of 4 to 12  s. thus , they are much slower than the bulk of radio pulsars .",
    "their x - ray pulse periods and period derivatives are similar to those of the axps and soft gamma - ray repeaters , sgrs , ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "this has led to discussions about whether they may be related to those objects .",
    "for example , @xcite suggested that the x - ray thermal isolated nss may simply have accretion discs with smaller masses than those of the axps .",
    "we note that it is currently not clear whether axps host accretion discs .",
    "the prevailing model for axps and sgrs is the magnetar model  isolated , young neutron stars with exceptionally high ( @xmath9 g ) surface magnetic fields @xcite .",
    "+ rxj1856.53754 has been observed at radio wavelengths ( to date without detection ) , near infrared ( without detection ) , optical and x - ray wavelengths .",
    "the striking absence of deviations from a pure blackbody in its x - ray spectrum has led to lively discussions on the nature of the object and of its x - ray emission , including highly magnetized atmospheres ( e.g. , @xcite ) , condensed surfaces ( e.g. , @xcite ) and quark stars ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the most recent , preliminary , parallax by @xcite is @xmath10pc and marks rxj1856.53754 as one of the closest nss currently known .",
    "@xcite discovered the @xmath11s pulsations of rxj1856.53754 , which has an extremely small pulsed fraction in the 0.15 - 1.2 kev range of only 1.2% .",
    "a timing study by @xcite inferred a magnetic field of @xmath12 g assuming spin - down by dipole radiation .",
    "interestingly , the spin - down luminosity is not high enough to explain the h@xmath13 nebula around rxj1856.53754 , discovered by @xcite .",
    "the nature of the h@xmath13 nebula remains unclear to date ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "these authors also derived a characteristic age of @xmath14myrs , which is much older than the kinematic age , @xmath15myrs , obtained assuming an origin in the upper scorpius ob association ( e.g. , @xcite ) . at such ages , any fallback disc around the source",
    "would be expected to be rather cool .",
    "+ within distance error bars , @xmath16pc by @xcite to @xmath10pc by @xcite , rxj1856.53754 appears to be in the outskirts of the corona australis star - forming cloud , whose distance is relatively well known : @xmath17pc from the orbit solution of the double - lined spectroscopic binary ty cra by @xcite ; for a detailed discussion we refer to sect.1.3 in @xcite .",
    "bondi - hoyle accretion @xcite from the interstellar medium ( ism ) is unlikely to be a major contributor to the observed x - ray luminosity today , given the high velocity of this neutron star @xcite .",
    "furthermore , it is likely that isolated nss accrete at sub - bondi rates @xcite .",
    "the accretion rate scales inversely with the magnetic moment as @xmath18 according to @xcite .",
    "rxj1856.53754 has a high magnetic field , @xmath19 g @xcite , reducing the possibility of accretion even further .",
    "however , as @xcite noted , rxj1856.53754 might have passed more dense regions than it now resides in .",
    "indeed the iras 100@xmath5 m image shows some cloud fragments projected along the past trajectory of rxj1856.53754 ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : iras ] ) , opening the possibility that the neutron star collected material in the past .",
    "+ here , we investigate the surroundings of rxj1856.53754 for cold dust as one might expect either in an old fallback disc or in a dense gas disc .",
    "the gas content of a fallback disc is not well known .",
    "the formation from supernova ejecta would be expected to produce a disc mainly consisting of heavy elements .",
    "@xcite showed that gas from viscous , circumpulsar discs typically depletes on very short , @xmath20 yr , timescales due to high temperatures during the early evolutionary stages , subsequent rapid spread of the disc and cooling allowing for the heavy elements to condense onto grains . in addition , @xcite have shown that for a pulsar moving with @xmath21kms@xmath2 through the ism , small dust grains with radii of @xmath22@xmath5 m are spiraled in from a circumpulsar disc to the neutron star on a time scale of order @xmath23 years .",
    "thus , a circumpulsar disc at the age of rxj1856.53754 is likely to be similar to debris discs , which are dust - rich and dominated by larger grains ( see , e.g. , @xcite ) as opposed to protostellar discs , which are gas - rich .",
    "if , on the other hand , rxj1856.53754 has collected new , gas - rich material from the outskirts of the corona australis star - forming cloud , the disc composition could more closely resemble a protostellar disc . given the uncertainties in the gas content and composition of a possible disc around rxj1856.53754",

    "rxj1856.53754 was observed from the 18th to the 24th of april 2008 using the 295-element large apex bolometer camera ( laboca , @xcite ) on the atacama pathfinder experiment ( apex ) telescope @xcite .",
    "laboca operates at 345ghz ( 870@xmath5 m ) with a bandwidth of 60ghz .",
    "the total on - source observing time was 18hours .",
    "mapping was performed on - the - fly using spiral patterns to ensure even coverage of the source . to obtain the lowest possible flux limit ,",
    "the most sensitive part of the array was centered on the source .",
    "the observing conditions were good to excellent with precipitable water vapor levels typically below 0.5 mm .",
    "sky - dips were performed hourly , and combined with radiometer readings to obtain accurate opacity estimates as described by @xcite .",
    "the absolute flux calibration follows the method outlined by @xcite , and is expected to be accurate to within @xmath24 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the nominal laboca beam is fwhm @xmath25 , and the pointing uncertainty is @xmath26 .",
    "the data were reduced using the february 2008 release of the boa reduction package ( schuller et al . in prep . ) .",
    "reduction steps included the removal of correlated ( atmospheric and electronic ) noise in several iterations , and the removal of spikes and excessively noisy channels .",
    "in the second part of the last observation night , we found a sharp drop in the root mean square ( rms ) of individual bolometer time streams .",
    "as these time streams did not contain the expected correlated sky component , these observations ( about two hours ) were excluded from further consideration .",
    "to filter out extended emission and residual atmospheric noise at low frequencies , we used direct high - pass filtering of the raw time streams applying the fast fourier transform ( fft ) .",
    "this was done by rejecting frequencies below a chosen cutoff , @xmath27 .    for each scan ,",
    "a map with @xmath28 sized pixels was constructed , weighting the data by the inverse rms of each reduced time stream .",
    "all maps were then co - added , and the final map was smoothed with the laboca beam , @xmath29 .",

    "the rms has been measured as 3.02 mjy / beam for the map obtained without direct fft filter , and 1.49 mjy / beam for the direct - fft - filtered map . applying the filter on a test point source of 10 mjy results in recovering of 89% of the original flux .",
    "we correct for this factor and obtain an @xmath0 limit of 5mjy / beam for the filtered map of rxj1856.53754 .    .",
    "darker areas indicate higher submillimetre flux . the circle is centered on the position of rxj1856.53754 with a radius of @xmath31 ( double beam size ) .",
    "no obvious submillimetre point source has been detected at the position of rxj1856.53754 .",

    "in contrast to infrared emission , submillimetre emission is nearly always optically thin and traces the total dust mass .",
    "the conventional formula for calculating this dust mass is : @xmath33 where @xmath34 is the frequency , @xmath35 is the flux density , @xmath36 is the distance , @xmath37 is the planck function at a dust temperature @xmath38 , and @xmath39 is the dust mass absorption coefficient .",
    "the value of @xmath39 depends on the grain parameters .",
    "as noted in the introduction , we consider in the following dust in protostellar discs as well as in debris discs to reflect the wide range of possible disc compositions around rxj1856.53754 .",
    "since the gas content in fallback discs is unconstrained , we calculate the dust mass limits for both disc types .",
    "the overall mass of a protostellar - composition disc would be larger by roughly a factor 100 , the conventional gas - to - dust - ratio .    in the case of protostellar - disc dust ,",
    "small grains are present . for such protostellar dust , we use @xmath40@xmath41g@xmath2 according to the relation by @xcite : @xmath42hz@xmath43@xmath41g@xmath2 with @xmath44 , and where @xmath45 is the opacity of dust and gas together .",

    "this temperature is reached at a radius of @xmath52 cm from the neutron star .",
    "this value is within the disc sizes discussed in models of ns fallback discs , e.g. , by @xcite .",

[ cols=\"<,^,^,^ \" , ]     [ massvalues ]    another uncertainty of the mass estimation is related to the porosity of the dust .",
    "porous grains are expected both in the cold ism as well as in debris discs .",
    "their influence on @xmath55 and @xmath38 can result in masses of a factor three smaller with respect to masses derived for non - porous grains @xcite . in case of fast - moving neutron stars like rxj1856 , sandblasting by particles from the ism",
    "fragments the dust @xcite and reduces the number of porous grains .",
    "if discs around isolated nss are ( still ) gas - rich , they are expected to be emitting mostly in the ir and longer wavelengths . in the following we use the disc model by @xcite to constrain the presence and properties of a potential gaseous circumstellar disc around rxj1856 .",
    "the model is based on an active , viscous disc , and takes irradiation through x - rays into account following the approach by @xcite .",
    "we note that the model does not include radiative transfer modeling , and it assumes that the disc is optically thick throughout .",
    "however , given our scarce knowledge about neutron star discs in general , and the lack of an actual ir or mm detection for rxj1856 we restrict to this model in the present work .",
    "given the very low x - ray luminosity of rxj1856 ( @xmath56erg s@xmath2 at 167pc , @xcite ) , if there is an active disc , it must be in the propeller phase , which is equivalent to saying that the magnetospheric radius , @xmath57 cm , must be smaller than the corotation radius , @xmath58 cm , where @xmath59 is the period of the x - ray pulsar .",
    "therefore , in our modelling of the disc emission , the inner radius of the disc , set equal to @xmath60 , is restricted to be smaller than @xmath61 . with the magnetic field strength estimate @xmath19 g by @xcite , this yields the condition that only accretion rate values @xmath62 g / s are allowed ( or else the star would be accreting and hence be much brighter in x - rays ) .",
    "in addition to our submillimetre observations , we use previously acquired data at near - infrared and infrared wavelengths . more specifically",
    ", we use the @xmath63-band limit derived at the position of rxj1856 , @xmath64mag , corresponding to a flux density of 0.0025mjy @xcite .",
    "furthermore , we derive the conservative iras / iris flux density limits at the position of the neutron star applying the iris atlas maps @xcite .",
    "these limits,@xmath65jy , @xmath66jy , @xmath67jy , and @xmath68jy at 12 , 25 , 60 and 100 microns respectively , are too large to constrain our model .    within the allowed range of @xmath69",
    ", we then investigated the expected disc emission as a function of @xmath69 , and the disc boundaries @xmath70 and @xmath71 .",
    "we find that @xmath70 influences the emission at wavelengths shorter than the ones considered here , and therefore the model parameters that can be constrained are @xmath69 and @xmath71 ( assuming a typical disc inclination of @xmath72 ) .",
    "we find that the h - band limit restricts the accretion rate to be @xmath73 g / s , largely independent of @xmath71 .",
    "the submillimetre @xmath0 limit , on the other hand , restricts the outer radius to be @xmath74 cm or 7 au .",
    "this outer radius is essentially independent of the accretion rate since the emission in the submillimetre is dominated by x - ray irradiation .",
    "[ fig : rosalba ] shows the predicted disc emission for a range of outer disc radii , and the maximum allowed value of the accretion rate , @xmath75 g / s .",
    "for the kinematic age of the pulsar , 0.5 myrs , and the derived mass accretion limit , we can estimate the accretion rate @xmath76 during the initial time @xmath77 @xmath78 yr ( menou et al . 2001 ; @xmath79 is the initial disc radius in units of @xmath80 cm ) before the power law decay begins ( cannizzo , lee & goodman 1990 ) , and hence the initial disc mass @xmath81 .",
    "this upper limit for the initial disc mass is only a very small fraction of the overall fallback mass discussed to be in the range of @xmath82 to @xmath83 by @xcite and @xcite .",
    "g s@xmath2 ( maximum allowed value by the ir limit ) , and the different curves show the emission for a range of outer disc radii allowed by the sub - mm limit . plotted are also the flux density limits from our apex submillimetre observations and the @xmath63-band . , width=321 ]      as noted above and shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : iras ] , the projected trajectory of rxj1856.53754 crossed a cra molecular cloud fragment roughly 3000 years ago .",
    "the current distance estimates for the cra cloud ( @xmath84pc ; @xcite ) and rxj1856.53754 ( @xmath10pc ; preliminary distance by @xcite or @xmath16pc by @xcite ) are close enough to each other to speculate about a possible encounter between the neutron star and the cloud fragment .",
    "@xcite investigated the r corona australis molecular cloud in detail by submillimetre continuum and line observations .",
    "unfortunately , their map does not cover the cloud fragment west of rxj1856 .",
    "for the cloud cores that they investigated in the extended eastern region , they derived densities on the order of @xmath85g@xmath86 to @xmath87g@xmath86 .",
    "these are a factor @xmath88 to @xmath89 larger than what is usually assumed for the ism .",
    "if rxj1856 crossed such a high density patch , this could have affected first a possible surrounding fallback disc , destroying it @xcite and second , it could have enabled the neutron star to accrete at higher rates from the ism .",
    "the extended emission seen in the iras image unfortunately only allows us a crude estimation of a lower density limit in the fragment : we consider the iras / iris 100@xmath5 m emission in box 1 centered at the fragment in comparison to the emission in a box 2 of the same size , but centered around an area devoid of enhanced iras emission ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : iras ] ) , that supposedly represents an average density value for the diffuse interstellar medium . by working with the flux density ratio we can ignore the problems involved in de - convolving the extended emission from the instrumental response .",
    "the flux density ratio , translating into a column density ratio , is 2.6 .",
    "the distance to the cloud / fragment is at least 130pc and we take this as the _ minimum _ distance , @xmath90 , along which the column density , @xmath91 , is derived from the number density , @xmath92 , in box 2 .",
    "the angular extent of the fragment along the direction of the proper motion of rxj1856 is around @xmath93 , corresponding to @xmath94pc at a distance of 130pc .",
    "we assume the same extent of the fragment along the line of sight , @xmath95pc ; the column density , @xmath96 , in box 1 is @xmath97 .",
    "therefore , the ratio of the number density in the fragment to the number density of the diffuse ism is at least 200 , @xmath98 . according to @xcite , at a number density of @xmath99particles @xmath86 , the smallest dust grains ( @xmath100@xmath5 m ) in a fallback disc can be removed within 3600 years , assuming a neutron star velocity of 100kms@xmath2 as estimated for rxj1856 ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "larger disc particles , however , would still survive and can be detected in principle in the submillimetre wavelength regime .",
    "the fact that we do not detect them in our apex observation could mean that rxj1856 passed a patch of much higher ism density , destroying its potential fallback disc .",
    "however , since the data about a possible encounter between the cloud fragment and rxj1856 is currently insufficient ( unknown 3d motion of the neutron star and distance of the fragment ) , it is also possible that there never was a circumstellar disc with a dust mass higher than few earth masses .",
    "overall , the above speculations show that a better knowledge of the past neighbourhood of rxj1856 is desirable .",
    "this can be obtained in principle by further millimeter continuum or molecular line observations .",
    "we investigated rxj1856.53754 for @xmath53@xmath5 m continuum emission which would be indicative of a cold dusty disc around the neutron star .",
    "the derived deep flux density limit translates into a dust mass limit of few earth masses . applying the irradiated ( gas - rich ) accretion disc model by @xcite ,",
    "together with further observational constraints , we obtained a mass accretion limit of @xmath101 g s@xmath2 , and a constraint on the outer disc radius , @xmath71 , to be smaller than @xmath102 cm or 7au .",
    "looking at the projected proper motion of rxj1856.53754 , we note that the neutron star might have passed a dense fragment of the cra molecular cloud a few thousand years ago which could have affected a potential circumstellar disc , as well as have enabled a brief history of accretion form the ism .",
