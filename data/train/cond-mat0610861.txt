    "in mott insulators , the heisenberg interaction @xmath6 is in most cases the dominant source of coupling between local moments , and most theoretical investigations are based on modeling in which only this type of interaction is included .",
    "it has been known for a very long time , however , that other , less symmetric , interactions are present . for instance , unless there is an inversion center on a bond , spin - orbit coupling induces an antisymmetric interaction of the form @xmath7 , which is known as the dzyaloshinskii - moriya ( dm ) interaction.@xcite since it breaks the fundamental su(2 ) symmetry of the heisenberg interactions , the dm interaction is at the origin of many deviations from pure heisenberg behavior , such as canting@xcite or small gaps.@xcite it is also known to have a dramatic impact on the properties of antiferromagnets in a magnetic field .",
    "numerous experimental investigations of quantum antiferromagnets currently in progress in large field facilities call for a detailed understanding of this problem.@xcite several issues have recently been the subject of rather intensive research . for instance , the impact on triplon bose - einstein condensation@xcite of dm interactions has been analyzed.@xcite the interplay of frustration and dm interactions has also received significant attention.@xcite the consequence of the breaking of su(2 ) symmetry on the excitation spectrum is also well understood thanks to the work of several people including some of the present authors.@xcite it is by now well established that a dm interaction can open a gap in otherwise gapless regions .",
    "the scaling of this gap with the magnitude of the dm interaction has been worked out for several cases.@xcite    surprisingly , however , the other important consequence of the breaking of the su(2 ) symmetry on the ground state properties of weakly coupled dimers , namely the development of a local magnetization , has not received much attention so far , although it is of immediate relevance to several compounds .",
    "it was shown in the case of srcu@xmath8(bo@xmath9)@xmath8 that a dm interaction can lead to the development of a measurable ( and in fact quite large ) staggered magnetization,@xcite but a simple picture of how the magnitude and the orientation of the dm interaction with respect to the magnetic field influences these properties has not yet emerged .",
    "besides , the fact that a dm interaction can lead to the development of a transverse uniform magnetization and its impact on torque measurements of the magnetization have not been investigated in detail .",
    "all these questions are central to the understanding of several systems of current interest .",
    "in particular , recent nmr results by clmancey _ et al._@xcite have revealed the presence of a staggered magnetization in the dimer compound cu@xmath2(c@xmath3h@xmath4n@xmath2)@xmath2cl@xmath5 [ abbreviation : cu(hp)cl ] , and the interpretation of these results requires a precise investigation of the effect of dm interactions on weakly coupled dimer systems .    in this paper , we present a systematic analysis of the consequences of an intra - dimer dm interaction on the development of local magnetization in systems of weakly coupled spin 1/2 dimers .",
    "we first look at the case of an isolated dimer , and derive simple expressions in the limits of weak and strong magnetic field which we believe are very useful to get a simple picture of subtle effects such as the effect of the relative orientation of the magnetic field and the @xmath10 vector of the dm interaction on the uniform magnetization .",
    "we then turn to the case of coupled dimers and concentrate on a simple ladder geometry .",
    "this choice is motivated partly by the potential relevance of this geometry to actual compounds such as cu(hp)cl , and by the possibility to obtain very accurate results using the density matrix renormalization group method ( dmrg)@xcite in this quasi - one dimensional geometry .",
    "finally , we report new torque measurements on cu(hp)cl and discuss them in the light of these results .",
    "the problem of an isolated dimer in a magnetic field in the presence of a dm interaction is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath11    the @xmath12 axis has been chosen to be that of the magnetic field , and the @xmath13 plane as the plane defined by the magnetic field and the @xmath0 vector ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : model - dimer ] ) . in actual systems ,",
    "the direction of the @xmath0 vector is fixed by the microscopic arrangement of atoms and orbitals , and it is the orientation of the magnetic field that can be varied with respect to the crystal , but the convention of having the magnetic field along the @xmath12 axis makes the discussion somewhat simpler . the @xmath0 vector is written as @xmath14 .     +    the isolated dimer problem is , of course , very simple .",
    "the hilbert space is of dimension 4 , and it will prove convenient to work in the basis @xmath15 unfortunately , the explicit expressions that can be derived for the eigenenergies and eigenvectors are cumbersome and not particularly useful .",
    "therefore , we will discuss the results from the point of view of symmetry , will derive useful expressions for small @xmath0 in weak field and close to saturation , and will present plots of some representative exact results .      in a magnetic field , the su(2 )",
    "symmetry of the heisenberg model is reduced to a u(1 ) symmetry corresponding to a rotation around the field direction .    as soon as a dm interaction with a @xmath0 vector not parallel to the magnetic field is introduced ,",
    "the rotational symmetry in spin space is completely lost .",
    "the only symmetry that remains is the mirror symmetry with respect to the @xmath13 plane ( the plane containing the magnetic field and the @xmath0 vector ) , which exchanges sites 1 and 2 and simultaneously changes the sign of the @xmath16-component of the spin operators ( the component perpendicular to the mirror plane ) . as a consequence ,",
    "the expectation values of local spin operators in any eigenstate of the hamiltonian satisfy the relations : @xmath17 these relations imply that the staggered magnetization per site , defined as @xmath18 , is perpendicular to the plane defined by the magnetic field and the @xmath19 vector , while the uniform magnetization per site defined by @xmath20 must lie in that plane .",
    "if the @xmath0 vector is parallel to the field , the u(1 ) rotational symmetry is still present , which can be easily checked since @xmath21 commutes with @xmath22 .",
    "the states @xmath23 and @xmath24 are still eigenstates with energies @xmath25 , but @xmath26 and @xmath27 get coupled .",
    "the staggered magnetization is identically zero , while the uniform magnetization jumps abruptly from 0 to @xmath28 ( @xmath29 is the direction of the applied magnetic field ) at a critical field @xmath30 larger than its @xmath31 value @xmath32 .      in the limit @xmath33 and below the saturation field @xmath34 , the ground - state wave function ,",
    "up to second order in @xmath35 , reads : @xmath36    in the low - field limit , first - order perturbation theory in @xmath37 can be used to derive simple expressions for the expectation value of the various spin operators : @xmath38 these expressions lead to compact and suggestive expressions for the uniform and staggered magnetizations : @xmath39    as required by symmetry , the staggered magnetization is perpendicular to both the field and the @xmath0 vector .",
    "as far as the uniform magnetization is concerned , symmetry only requires that it lies in the plane of the magnetic field and of the @xmath0 vector , but in the low field limit , eq .",
    "( [ eq - m - hsmall ] ) shows that it is perpendicular to the @xmath0 vector .",
    "so the uniform magnetization is in general _ not _ parallel to the magnetic field , as it would be in a system with su(2 ) symmetry , and it can in fact deviate strongly : in the limit where the @xmath0 vector becomes parallel to the field , the uniform magnetization becomes perpendicular to the magnetic field , a rather anomalous behavior that should have important consequences for torque measurements of the magnetization .",
    "another remarkable feature of these results is that the staggered magnetization is first order in @xmath0 , while the uniform magnetization is second order .",
    "thus , at low field the response is dominated by the staggered magnetization , as already observed in srcu(bo@xmath9)@xmath8 .",
    "finally , let us emphasize that , as implied by eq .",
    "[ eq - m - hsmall ] , the uniform and staggered magnetizations have universal expressions in terms of the magnetic field and of the @xmath0 vector , which are valid regardless of their orientation with respect to the lattice .      at the critical field @xmath34",
    ", one has to turn to degenerate perturbation theory since , for @xmath31 , @xmath26 and @xmath40 are degenerate . when the @xmath0 vector is not parallel to the field , these states get coupled by an off - diagonal term @xmath41 .",
    "the ground state wave function is then simply given by @xmath42 , and the staggered magnetization per site is equal to @xmath43 .",
    "interestingly enough , this maximal value is independent of the angle @xmath44 and does not vanish but remains quite large in the limit where @xmath45 goes to zero .",
    "note , however , that the staggered magnetization only takes significant values close to @xmath46 , in an interval of width of the order of @xmath47 which shrinks to zero in the limit where @xmath45 goes to zero , consistent with a vanishing staggered magnetization when @xmath31 .    when @xmath48 , the uniform magnetization at this field is equal to @xmath49 , which corresponds to half the polarization value .",
    "when the angle between @xmath45 and @xmath37 is not @xmath50 , a small uniform component develops along @xmath51 due to the coupling of @xmath52 with @xmath53 .",
    "this transverse ( with respect to the field ) uniform magnetization is given by @xmath54 .",
    "in contrast to the small field result , it is now linear in @xmath45 , but remains much smaller than the staggered magnetization , which is of order one .",
    "to get an idea of the accuracy of the expressions obtained at low field and close to the saturation field , we have plotted in fig .",
    "[ fig - d0.04 ] the exact value of @xmath55 , @xmath56 and @xmath57 for a representative case ( @xmath58 and @xmath59 ) .",
    "the small field expression is quantitatively accurate up to @xmath60 , and the width of the peak of the staggered magnetization and the maximal value of @xmath56 are indeed of order @xmath45 .    ,",
    "@xmath57 and @xmath55 for @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "the dashed lines are the analytical results derived in the limit @xmath33 .",
    "note the difference of scale for positive and negative magnetizations . ]",
    "in this section , our goal is to check to which extent the properties of a system of weakly coupled dimers resemble those of isolated dimers . in particular , the transition between zero magnetization and polarization takes place through an extended region of magnetic field of the order of the inter - dimer coupling , and we would like to know how the system behaves within and outside this region .",
    "we will attack this problem numerically , and in order to perform simulations on large systems , we have chosen to work in a ladder geometry and to use the dmrg .",
    "the model is defined by the hamiltonian @xmath63 as for the isolated dimer , the @xmath0 vector is assumed to lie in the @xmath13 plane , i.e. , @xmath64 .",
    "our choice of an alternating @xmath0 vector from one rung to the other ( see fig .  [ fig : model_ladder ] ) is motivated by symmetry considerations .",
    "indeed , in a canonical ladder , the middle of each rung is an inversion center , and the dm interaction vanishes by symmetry .",
    "a simple way to allow for the dm interaction to become finite without modifying the symmetry of the exchange couplings is to assume that some buckling is present along the ladder , as sketched in fig .",
    "[ fig : model_zigzag ] . in that case , the only mirror plane that contains a bond is the @xmath65 plane , and a dm interaction with a @xmath0 vector parallel to @xmath51 is allowed by symmetry .",
    "but , in this geometry , the presence of a @xmath66 axis ( see fig .",
    "[ fig : model_zigzag ] ) implies that the @xmath0 vector alternates from one rung to the other .",
    "the buckling realized in cu@xmath2(c@xmath3h@xmath4n@xmath2)@xmath2cl@xmath5 is slightly more subtle ( successive rungs are connected by an inversion symmetry in the middle of a plaquette ) , but this symmetry also implies alternating @xmath0 vectors .",
    "note , however , that other ways of breaking the inversion symmetry of the rungs can lead to other arrangements of @xmath0 vectors .",
    "-direction is allowed by symmetry . ]",
    "another motivation to work with alternating @xmath0 vectors is to keep the perturbation caused by the inter - dimer coupling as small as possible . in that respect",
    ", this choice is natural . indeed , as we have seen in the previous section , the presence of a @xmath0 vector on a rung induces a staggered magnetization . if the @xmath0 vectors of neighboring rungs @xmath67 and @xmath68 are equal , the moments @xmath69 and @xmath70 will also be equal , which is in conflict with antiferromagnetic inter - rung exchange interactions .",
    "if , on the contrary , the @xmath0 vectors are opposite on neighboring rungs , the local moments will adopt configurations that are compatible with the exchange .      with this choice of staggered @xmath0 vectors , the model possesses the following symmetries",
    ": i ) a @xmath13 mirror plane going through the middle of the rungs ; ii ) an inversion center in the center of the plaquette formed by two consecutive rungs ; iii ) even translation symmetries along @xmath51 .",
    "as long as these symmetries are not broken , the following relations between the expectation values of local spin operators on two neighboring rungs are expected to be satisfied :    @xmath71    we thus define the staggered and uniform magnetizations per site as @xmath72 where @xmath73 is the total number of sites , and with the convention that the angle @xmath44 is positive for @xmath67 even . as in the isolated dimer case , the staggered magnetization @xmath74 is along the @xmath16 axis , while the uniform magnetization @xmath75 lies in the @xmath13 plane .",

    "note that @xmath81 goes to @xmath50 in the low - field limit , in agreement with the prediction for an isolated dimer ( eq .  ) . ]",
    "let us now turn to the discussion of the numerical results we have obtained for the model of eq .",
    "( [ eq - ham ] ) .",
    "we are interested in the regime @xmath82 .",
    "for @xmath31 , the model is a simple ladder in a field , and the properties are well understood .",
    "there is , of course , no staggered magnetization because of the u(1 ) symmetry , and the uniform magnetization is parallel to the field for the same reason .",
    "it vanishes below a critical field @xmath77 , takes off with a square - root singularity , and reaches saturation with another square - root singularity at a second critical field @xmath79 .",
    "the difference @xmath83 scales with @xmath84 .",
    "since , apart from this scaling , the properties depend very little on @xmath84 , we quote results for a single value of @xmath84 , and having in mind the compound cu(hp)cl,@xcite we have chosen @xmath85 . for that ratio ,",
    "the critical fields in the absence of dm interactions are given by @xmath86 and @xmath87 .",
    "for the model with dm interaction , we have performed exact diagonalization ( ed)@xcite up to 20 sites ( 10 rungs ) , and dmrg calculations on ladders with up to 80 rungs .",
    "the results evolve smoothly with the size , and we only quote dmrg results obtained for 80-rung clusters ( finite - size effects for the gap are discussed in the next section ) .",
    "note that in those calculations , @xmath88 is not a good quantum number .",
    "this is well known to reduce greatly the maximal size available to exact diagonalizations , but this also has an impact on the number of states we were able to keep during the dmrg runs . here , we diagonalize ( by the davidson method ) a matrix of size @xmath89 at each dmrg step . in a standard dmrg run where @xmath88 is a good quantum number , the matrix of the effective hamiltonian in the variational basis is block - diagonal , which can speed up the diagonalization by a factor of 10 or more .",
    "the memory needed is also larger at fixed @xmath90 than for the standard dmrg . for those reasons ,",
    "most of the calculations were done with up to @xmath91 states kept during 5 sweeps , and only up to @xmath92 sites .",
    "the discarded weight was of the order of @xmath93 when we targeted two states to extract the gap , and of the order of @xmath94 or less when we targeted a single state to extract correlations .",
    "we also performed a few runs with @xmath90 up to 800 in order to confirm that the numerical data were well converged .     and",
    "large values are achieved between @xmath77 and @xmath79 , and far outside this interval as soon as @xmath35 is not too small .",
    "the value between @xmath77 and @xmath79 depends relatively weakly on @xmath35 and @xmath44 , and is of the same order as the maximal value in the case of an isolated dimer ( @xmath1 ) .",

[ fig - magz ] ) .    when @xmath98 ( i.e. , @xmath99 ) , a uniform magnetization along the @xmath51 axis also develops , as in the isolated dimer case .",

    "the magnetization along @xmath51 is maximal between the two critical fields .",
    "its value in that range is clearly much smaller than the component along the field ( @xmath80 becomes very small near @xmath77 ) , but this extra contribution to the uniform magnetization will produce a torque that should be detectable experimentally given the very high sensitivity of torque measurements .",
