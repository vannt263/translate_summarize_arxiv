    "the measurement of specific heat is a central characterization applicable to all kind of materials .",
    "low - temperature calorimetry is particularly suited for the investigation of superconductors and other novel systems with electronic phase transitions.@xcite such measurements require high resolution , since the electronic contribution to the heat capacity is only a minor part of the total heat capacity , except at the very lowest temperatures .",
    "the high resolution can be achieved through differential calorimeter designs and various temperature - modulated techniques.@xcite good accuracy is also often needed .",
    "the temperature dependence of the specific heat may , for instance , reveal central aspects of the nature of the electronic system , including energy gap structure , anisotropy , and possible signatures of quantum phase transitions .",
    "measurements are , furthermore , often performed in magnetic fields of various direction , using single crystals of highest available quality .",
    "this requires both a small calorimeter and small samples .",
    "all this together puts high demands on the calorimeter setup , typically excluding commercially available calorimeters . to meet this demand",

    "nanocalorimetry is a rapidly growing area of research , driven by several fields of physics .",
    "nanocalorimeters include absorption sensors,@xcite devices to study transition enthalpies,@xcite fast scanning calorimeters to study microscopic nanostructure ensembles and thin films@xcite and kinetics and glass transitions of polymers@xcite , and combinatorial calorimeters.@xcite there are also several low - temperature microcalorimeters for @xmath12 samples@xcite and nanocalorimeters for heat capacity measurements of thin films@xcite and very small ( @xmath1 ) samples at high@xcite , intermediate,@xcite and down to low temperatures.@xcite    going down in sample size favors the use of temperature - modulated techniques with corresponding high resolution , but makes it harder to obtain good absolute accuracy .",
    "this is partly due to an increasing relative contribution of the device addenda , but also due to non - adiabatic conditions and practical design issues , such as thermometry , system complexity , and thermal links considerations .",
    "devices for general use that combine high - resolution measurements of small samples with good absolute accuracy over an extended temperature range are hard to find .",
    "the membrane - based nanocalorimeter presented here is intended to fill this gap .",
    "our nanocalorimeter is developed for measurements of the temperature- and field dependence of the absolute specific heat of samples with a typical mass around @xmath13@xmath14 g , and for angular - dependent studies in magnetic fields .",
    "the device is built onto a pair of silicon nitride membranes using thin film techniques that provide low background heat capacity , less than @xmath3 at @xmath4 , decreasing to @xmath5 at @xmath6 , and a low thermal conductance , going from about @xmath15 at @xmath4 to @xmath16 at @xmath6 .",
    "the thermal relaxation time of the device is long enough ( ms to s range ) to enable ac steady - state and relaxation methods to be used concurrently .",
    "the high resolution of the ac steady - state method allows small changes in the heat capacity , such as contributions from the electronic specific heat , to be accurately determined , and investigations of phase transitions and phase diagrams to be performed .",
    "absolute accuracy is obtained by a combination of low background addenda , a stacked calorimeter design , and extensive measurement electronics operated with self - regulation and frequency feedback .",
    "the compact format enables the calorimeter to be placed on sample holders for rotation in magnetic field .",
    "the calorimeter could even be used for studies of dynamic ( frequency dependent ) heat capacity.@xcite the device is thus a versatile tool for general thermodynamic studies of small samples .",

    "it is used to oscillate the sample temperature with a well - defined ac power .",
    "it has a four - point probe geometry to allow accurate determination of the power at the sample without contributions from lead and contact resistances .",
    "ti becomes superconducting below about @xmath26 , but since the superconductivity can be suppressed by relatively modest fields the heaters may still be used at even lower temperatures . if needed , the film thickness could also be decreased to suppress @xmath27 .    the active part of the thermometer , shown in fig .",

    "it senses the sample area using a four - point probe configuration and is in direct thermal contact with the sample , thus probing the actual sample temperature .",
    "consequently , heat dissipation in the thermometer does not pose a problem after initial calibration so that the thermometer can be operated at rather high powers to achieve a high sensitivity .",
    "furthermore , there is no need to rely on measurements of the frame / base temperature , unlike when thermocouples are used.@xcite this eliminates hysteretic effects when sweeping temperature and results in a high reproducibility .",
    "the sensor layer is fabricated using rf magnetron sputtering from a 2-inch target made of cast @xmath7 with nominally 17 at% au.@xcite the chip is annealed at @xmath30 on a hotplate for at least 1 hour after deposition , resulting in a room temperature resistivity @xmath31 and dimensionless sensitivity @xmath32 between @xmath4 and @xmath33 , increasing to about @xmath34 at lower temperatures .",

    "this heater is designed to give an isothermal interior area , but is not in direct contact with the active part of the thermometer .",
    "it is thus less suitable as an ac heater , since the thermal diffusion between thermometer and heater would have to be taken into account .",
    "titanium has good robustness so the deposited layer can be quite thin .",
    "its addition to the background heat capacity is rather insignificant , but to simplify the fabrication process the layer is sometimes skipped .",
    "the leads that connect the active layers to the external bonding pads are also in ti .",
    "because of the relatively low thermal conductance of ti compared to many other metals , the use of ti for the leads ensures a long relaxation time dominated by the membrane itself . outside the membrane area ,",
    "a thick layer of au is deposited onto the leads to minimize lead resistance effects and to provide a suitable layer for bonding , see fig .",

    "a central phase generator delivers the digital reference for all inputs and outputs .",
    "the resulting instrument thus allows tuning of output voltages and working frequency during the measurements , without any loss of correlation between inputs and outputs .",

    "in summary , we have developed a membrane - based nanocalorimeter for specific heat measurements of small samples and thin films over an extended temperature range from above room temperature down to below @xmath6 .",
