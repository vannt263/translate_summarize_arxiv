    "there is nowadays much interest in the investigation of the abundances of elements produced via neutron capture processes ( e.g. sr , ba , y , la , zr , and so forth ) , both in open clusters and in the general galactic field .",
    "the precise abundance of these elements in as many stars and clusters as possible allows us to improve our understanding ( 1 ) of the neutron capture processes themselves as enrichment sources ( e.g. @xcite ) , ( 2 ) of the various chemical evolution scenarios for the galactic disk ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ) , and ( 3 ) of the different formation paths of star clusters and stars in the galactic field @xcite .",
    "the neutron capture reactions can run in two ways , depending on the neutron flux density : as a slow process ( s - process ) or as a rapid process ( r - process , @xcite .",
    "the two processes take place at different temperatures , in different time domains , and , therefore , inside objects in different evolutionary stages .    as for the r - process",
    ", three channels of s - process were originally introduced in the classical model by @xcite : ( 1 ) the main channel , from asymptotic giant branch ( agb ) stars ( isotopes with a from 90 to 204 ) ; ( 2 ) the weak channel , from massive stars that explode later as supernovae ( isotopes with a up to 90 ) ; and ( 3 ) the strong channel , introduced to reproduce 50% of @xmath0pb . at present , modern models of nucleosynthesis in the agb stars",
    "consider a variety of contributions in the production of specific isotopes , as a function of ( 1 ) the number of third dredge - up episodes , and ( 2 ) the yields of the light s - elements ( ls ) , as sr , y , zr , and the heavy s - elements ( hs ) , such as ba , la , ce , pr , nd , and their dependence on metallicity ( see more detailed information in @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite , etc . ) the small and moderately massive agb stars ( mass around 1.5 solar masses ) contribute mostly to the production of the n - capture elements , such as yttrium and barium .",
    "those stars then enrich the interstellar medium , from which new stars will form in subsequent star formation episodes .",
    "the details of the formation and production of neutron capture elements provide , therefore , crucial information bearing on models of galactic chemical evolution .",
    "for instance , in the study by @xcite , barium abundances were derived for a number of open clusters stars , and it was found that ba abundance with respect to iron increases at decreasing clusters age .",
    "this seems to require some additional enrichment with barium by the least - massive stars @xmath1",
    "( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , and it is at variance with the currently existing chemical evolution models that describe the enrichment process at the moment of the solar system formation @xcite . along the same vein ,",
    "@xcite and @xcite found significant barium overabundances in young stars .",
    "@xcite investigated other n - capture elements , such as y , zr , la , ce , in young open clusters and confirmed the result obtained for barium , namely an increase of overabundances of those elements with the cluster age .",
    "however , the overabundances are limited to small values ( [ el / fe ] @xmath2 0.2 dex ) , when compared with barium overabundance ( [ ba / fe ] @xmath2 0.6 dex ) .    in the recent study by @xcite ,",
    "a lower value of 0.3 dex of the barium abundance was obtained for the stars in three young associations .",
    "the authors provide a few possible explanations for this overabundance , namely : ( 1 ) neglecting the hyperfine structure of the barium lines ; ( 2 ) deviations from the local thermodynamic equilibrium ( lte ) conditions ; ( 3 ) chromospheric activity ( see also @xcite ) .",
    "however , these authors did not detect any correlation between the barium abundance and the chromospheric activity indices for their stars .",
    "moreover , their estimate of the deviations from the lte conditions implied a minor effect on the barium abundance determination .    as is shown in a number of works ( e.g. @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) , the origin of the barium overabundance ( up to 0.6 dex ) is still far from being understood , and much work still need to be done .",
    "the goal of the present study is ( 1 ) to enlarge the sample of star clusters with estimates of lte yttrium abundances and the barium abundances allowing for deviations from the lte , and ( 2 ) to analyze the trends of their abundances as a function of the distance to the galactic center and the age .",
    "this is in an attempt to provide further observational pieces of evidence , and to boost the discussion on this intriguing problem .",
    "the main parameters ( galactic coordinates , helio - centric distance and age ) of the investigated clusters are listed in the table [ par ] .",
    ".the main parameters of the clusters under study [ cols=\"<,^,^,^,^,^ \" , ]",
    "we compared ( see fig . [ yage ] ) the obtained values of the yttrium [ y / fe ] and barium [ ba / fe ] abundances with estimates from other authors , for a number of open clusters ( @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ; @xcite ) .",
    "the data for the thin disc stars were taken from the study by @xcite . as is seen in fig .",
    "[ yage ] , there is a slight trend for yttrium ( from -0.2 dex to 0.2 dex ) with increasing age .",
    "the data for the same young clusters obtained by @xcite , differ from those by @xcite on average of 0.2 dex , which , nonetheless , is within the range of the claimed accuracy .",
    "our yttrium abundances for other young clusters are also slightly higher than @xcite ; however , they nicely agree with the results from other authors .",
    "overall , the behavior of the yttrium abundance nicely agrees with modern chemical evolution models ( with the possible exception of the outlier cluster berkeley 29 , age 4.3 gyr , [ y / fe ] = 0.35 dex @xcite .",
    "the fact that the correlation of the yttrium abundance and the ages of the stars is similar for the clusters and the thin disc favors a similarity of origin of the stars of the thin disc and open clusters . as shown by @xcite , open clusters delivered up to 40% of the disc stars over the typical galactic disc life - time .",
    "the moderate trend we detect can be indicative of the increase in contributions into the enrichment of the interstellar medium from the least - massive agb stars ( @xmath3 ) .    as for barium , we observe a significant trend and a large spread of the values .",
    "the obtained average values for the two youngest clusters ruprecht  4 and ruprecht  7 ( with ages of about 0.8 gyr ) are @xmath4[ba / fe]@xmath5 = 0.33 and 0.56 dex , respectively . a rather high value was also determined for cluster berkeley  75 ( with an age of about 3 gyr ) , namely [ ba / fe ] = 0.38 dex for star @xmath6 . thus , young cluster stars exhibit different barium abundances from moderate values of 0.20.3 dex to 0.6 dex .",
    "the behavior of moderately over - abundant barium objects is in line with the yttrium behavior .",
    "however , neither higher values of [ ba / fe ] nor its sharp increase at young ages can be explained at the moment .    in an attempt to better understand what is happening , we included in the discussion the yttrium and barium abundances in galactic cepheids ( the disc young stars with ages around 0.20.4 gyr ) as determined by ( @xcite ( y ) , @xcite ( ba ) ) . in fig .",
    "[ yage ] , the average values are marked with large empty circles .",
    "a good agreement is observed for the yttrium , but the average values of barium in the cepheids are significantly lower than 0.6 dex , while the values of [ ba / fe ] themselves are within the range from -0.05 dex to 0.4 dex with the average value of 0.2 dex @xcite . taking errors into account ,",
    "the spread in barium values is the same as in open clusters .",
    "the problem of barium abundance remains , therefore , unsolved in the framework of chemical evolution models .",
    "it is also difficult to accept the idea that all giants in open clusters showing such over - abundance can fall in the _ barium stars _ class @xcite .",
    "to determine the correlation between the yttrium and barium abundances and the galaxy - centric distances , we compared the mean values of @xmath4[y / h]@xmath5 and @xmath4[ba / h]@xmath5 for young clusters -both from us ( ruprecht 4 , ruprecht 7 , ngc 6192 , ngc 6404 , ngc 6583 ) and from other authors- with those for cepheids and young stars of the galaxy disc ( @xcite ( y ) ; @xcite ( ba ) ) ( see figs .",
    "[ yhrg ] and [ bahrg ] ) .",
    "to consistently compare the data with those for the cepheids , the galacto - centric distances for all clusters were recomputed adopting 7.9 kpc as sun distance from the centre of the galaxy .",
    "the galaxy - centric distances for the program clusters were computed with the following formula ( the distances are given in pc ) : @xmath7^{1/2}}\\ ] ] where r@xmath8 is the galacto - centric distance of the sun , d is the heliocentric distance of a cluster , l is the galactic longitude , and b is the galactic latitude .",
    "the galacto - centric distance of the sun r@xmath8 = 7.9 kpc was adopted from the recent determination by @xcite .",
    "the distribution of the analyzed clusters in the galactic plane is shown in figs .",
    "[ yhrg ] and [ bahrg ] .",
    "the yttrium abundance in young open clusters mirrors the trend of cepheids and confirms the existence of an yttrium abundance gradient in the galactic disc .",
    "barium behaves differently .",
    "the ba abundances in a number of clusters are within the same area as the ba values for the cepheids , but four clusters exhibit significant barium over - abundances that exceed the spread of values ( [ ba / h ] @xmath5 0.5 dex ) in the cepheids . those are ic 2391 , ngc 2324 , ic 2602 @xcite and ruprecht 7 ( our determinations ) .",
    "the existence of such a sizable overabundance , especially for the ruprecht  7 , remains an open issue .",
    "this can not be imputed to deviations from the lte , since our estimates were obtained taking these effects into proper account .",
    "moreover , as shown by @xcite , this can not be related to chromospheric activity .",
    "we note that ruprecht  7 , besides showing a net over - abundance , also possesses an abnormal orbit according to the calculations by @xcite , @xcite .",
    "unfortunately , however , the accuracy in the orbit determination ( large proper motion errors for distant clusters , and the adopted fixed galacti potential ) does not allow us to further explore the possible consequences of this result .",
    "other scenarios have to be explored .",
    "we speculate that they possibly formed out of a metal poor environment previously contaminated by the close passage of high velocity clouds , or old , metal poor systems like globular clusters or dwarf galaxies .",
    "in this paper , yttrium and barium abundances are determined for 30 stars , including 22 stars in eight open clusters using modern techniques of chemical abundance analysis .",
    "our main conclusions can be summarized as follows :    @xmath9 the correlation between the yttrium abundance and the age is similar for the clusters and the thin disc , which seems to indicate similarity of origin for the galactic thin disc and open clusters .",
    "the moderated yttrium over - abundance in young systems can be indicative of an increase of the contribution of the least - massive agb stars with @xmath3 .",
    "the trend of yttrium for young open clusters with the galacto - centric distance is similar to the one obtained for the cepheids , and it confirms the existence of an yttrium abundance gradient in the galactic disc .",
    "@xmath9 this sample of clusters shows significant barium overabundance , including young clusters as ruprecht  7 . based on these results , we can suggest that barium overabundance is real and is not due to errors in the abundance determination . as an alternative",
    ", one has to invoke that this family of clusters is somehow peculiar , or their ambient formation has been contaminated in a very special way .",
    "we conclude by suggesting that the study of the barium abundance ( including the hyperfine structure and in the approximation of the nlte ) in as many stars and clusters as possible ( especially young ones ) is very welcome , and additional data should be provided .",
