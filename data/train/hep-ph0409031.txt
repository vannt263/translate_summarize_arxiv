    "in the standard model ( sm ) , the only source of cp violation is the kobayashi - maskawa phase @xcite , localized in the unitarity triangle ( ut ) of the cabibbo - kobayashi - maskawa ( ckm ) matrix @xcite .",
    "thanks to the precise measurements at the current @xmath3-factories , cp violation could be established in @xmath4  @xcite , leading to a precise measurement of @xmath5 , where the current world average yields  @xcite @xmath6 .",
    "the extractions of the other two angles @xmath7 and @xmath8 are expected mainly through cp violation in the charmless @xmath3 decays , such as @xmath9 and similar modes  @xcite .",
    "the current @xmath3-factories measurements have been averaged to yield @xcite : @xmath10 on the theoretical side , the analysis is challenging due to the need to know the ratio of penguin - to - tree amplitude contributing to this process . in this talk",
    ", we present the result of @xcite , where a transparent method of exploring the ut through the cp violation in @xmath11 , combined with the `` gold - plated '' mode @xmath4 has been proposed .",
    "a model independent lower bound on the ckm parameters as functions of @xmath12 and @xmath1 is derived .",
    "our estimate of the hadronic parameters are carried out in qcd factorization ( qcdf ) and confronted to other approaches .",
    "the time - dependent cp asymmetry in @xmath0 decays is defined by @xmath13 @xmath14 with @xmath15 , and @xmath16 and @xmath8 are ckm angles which are related to the wolfenstein parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 in the usual way @xcite .",
    "the penguin - to - tree ratio @xmath19 can be written as @xmath20 .",
    "the real parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 defined in this way are pure strong interaction quantities without further dependence on ckm variables .    for any given values of @xmath21 and @xmath22",
    "a measurement of @xmath12 and @xmath23 defines a curve in the ( @xmath17 , @xmath18)-plane , expressed respectively through @xmath24}{((1-\\bar\\rho)^2+\\bar\\eta^2 )           ( r_b^2+r^2 + 2 r\\bar\\rho \\cos\\phi)}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] @xmath25    the penguin parameter @xmath26 has been computed in @xcite in the framework of qcdf .",
    "the result can be expressed in the form @xmath27 } {   a_1+a^u_4 + r^\\pi_\\chi a^u_6 + r_a[b_1+b_3 + 2 b_4]},\\ ] ] where we neglected the very small effects from electroweak penguin operators .",
    "a recent analysis gives @xcite @xmath28 where the error includes an estimate of potentially important power corrections . in order to obtain additional insight into the structure of hadronic @xmath3-decay amplitudes",
    ", it will be also interesting to extract these quantities from other @xmath3-channels , or using other methods . in this perspective , we have considered them in a simultaneous expansion in @xmath29 and @xmath30 ( @xmath31 is the number of colours ) in ( [ rqcd ] ) . expanding these coefficients to first order in @xmath29 and @xmath30 we find that the uncalculable power corrections @xmath32 and @xmath33 do not appear in ( [ rqcd ] ) , to which they only contribute at order @xmath34 .",
    "using our default input parameters , one obtains the central value @xcite : @xmath35 , which seems to be in a good agreement with the standard qcdf framework at the next - to - leading order .    as a second cross - check",
    ", one can extract @xmath21 and @xmath22 from @xmath36 and @xmath37 , leading to the central value @xcite @xmath38 , in agreement with the above results to its experimental value @xmath39 .",
    "] , although their definitions differ slightly from @xmath40 ( see @xcite for further discussions ) .",
    "it is possible to fix the ut by combining the information from @xmath12 with the value of @xmath1 , well known from the `` gold - plated '' mode @xmath41 .",
    "the angle @xmath16 of the ut is given by @xmath42 the current world average @xcite @xmath6 , implies @xmath43 given a value of @xmath44 , @xmath17 is related to @xmath18 by @xmath45 .",
    "the parameter @xmath17 may thus be eliminated from @xmath12 in ( [ srhoeta ] ) , which can be solved for @xmath18 to yield @xmath46,\\nonumber \\end{aligned}\\ ] ] with @xmath47 the two observables @xmath44 ( or @xmath1 ) and @xmath12 determine @xmath18 and @xmath17 once the theoretical penguin parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 are provided .",
    "the determination of @xmath18 as a function of @xmath12 is shown in fig .",
    "[ fig : etabspp ] , which displays the theoretical uncertainty from the penguin parameters @xmath21 and @xmath22 in qcdf . since the dependence on @xmath22 enters in ( [ etataus ] ) only at second order , it turns out that its sensitivity is rather mild in contrast to @xmath21 . in the determination of @xmath18 and @xmath17 described here discrete ambiguities do in principle arise , however they are ruled out using the standard fit of the ut ( see @xcite for further discussions ) .    after considering the implications of @xmath12 on the ut ,",
    "let s explore now @xmath23 . since @xmath23 is an odd function of @xmath22 , it is therefore sufficient to restrict the discussion to positive values of @xmath22 . a positive phase @xmath22 is obtained by the perturbative estimate in qcdf , neglecting soft phases with power suppression",
    ". for positive @xmath22 also @xmath23 will be positive , assuming @xmath48 , and a sign change in @xmath22 will simply flip the sign of @xmath23 .",
    "in contrast to the case of @xmath12 , the hadronic quantities @xmath21 and @xmath22 play a prominent role for @xmath23 , as can be seen in ( [ crhoeta ] ) . this will in general complicate the interpretation of an experimental result for @xmath23 .",
    "the analysis of @xmath23 becomes more transparent if we fix the weak parameters and study the impact of @xmath21 and @xmath22 .",
    "an important application is a test of the sm , obtained by taking @xmath17 and @xmath18 from a sm fit and comparing the experimental result for @xmath23 with the theoretical expression as a function of @xmath21 and @xmath22 . in fig .",
    "[ fig : cpipi ] , a useful representation is obtained by plotting contours of constant @xmath23 in the ( @xmath21 , @xmath22)-plane , for given values of @xmath17 and @xmath18 .    within the sm this illustrates the correlations between the parameters @xmath40 and observable @xmath23 . as it has been shown in @xcite , a bound on the parameter @xmath23 exists , given by @xmath49 with @xmath50 and where the maximum occurs at @xmath51 . if @xmath52 , no useful upper bound is obtained .",
    "however , if @xmath53 , then @xmath54 is maximized for @xmath55 , yielding the general bound @xmath56 .",
    "for the conservative bound @xmath57 , @xmath58 this implies @xmath59 .",
    "the bound on @xmath23 can be strengthened by using information on @xmath22 , as well as on @xmath60 , and employing ( [ barc ] ) .",
    "then @xmath58 and @xmath61 gives @xmath62 .",
    "as has been shown in @xcite , the following inequality can be derived from ( [ etataus ] ) for @xmath63 @xmath64 this bound is still _ exact _ and requires no information on the phase @xmath22 .",
    "assuming now @xmath65 , we have @xmath66 and @xmath67 we emphasize that this lower bound on @xmath18 depends only on the observables @xmath44 and @xmath12 and is essentially free of hadronic uncertainties . since both @xmath21 and @xmath22 are expected to be quite small , we anticipate that the lower limit ( [ etabound ] ) is a fairly strong bound , close to the actual value of @xmath18 itself ( see @xcite for further details ) .",
    "we also note that the lower bound ( [ etabound ] ) represents the solution for the unitarity triangle in the limit of vanishing penguin amplitude , @xmath68 . in other words ,",
    "the model - independent bounds for @xmath18 and @xmath17 are simply obtained by ignoring penguins and taking @xmath69 when fixing the unitarity triangle from @xmath12 and @xmath1 .",
    "let us briefly comment on the second solution for @xmath18 , which has the minus sign in front of the square root in ( [ etataus ] ) replaced by a plus sign . for positive @xmath12",
    "this solution is always larger than ( [ etataus ] ) and the bound ( [ etabound ] ) is unaffected . for @xmath70",
    "the second solution gives a negative @xmath18 , which is excluded by independent information on the ut ( for instance from @xmath71 ) .    because we have fixed the angle @xmath16 , or @xmath44 , the lower bound on @xmath18 is equivalent to an upper bound on @xmath72 .",
    "the constraint ( [ etabound ] ) may also be expressed as a lower bound on the angle @xmath8 or a lower bound on @xmath73 ( see @xcite for further details ) . in figs .",
    "[ fig : etabound ] , we represent the lower bound on @xmath18 as a function of @xmath12 for various values of @xmath1 . from fig .",
    "[ fig : etabound ] we observe that the lower bound on @xmath18 becomes stronger as either @xmath12 or @xmath1 increase .    in fig .",
    "[ fig : utbound ] we illustrate the region in the @xmath74 plane that can be constrained by the measurement of @xmath1 and @xmath12 using the bound in ( [ etabound ] ) .",
    "we finally note that the condition @xmath75 , which is crucial for the bound , could be independently checked @xcite by measuring the mixing - induced cp - asymmetry in @xmath76 , the u - spin counterpart of the @xmath77 mode @xcite .",
    "in this talk , we have proposed strategies to extract information on weak phases from cp violation observables in @xmath0 decays even in the presence of hadronic contributions related to penguin amplitudes .",
    "assuming knowledge of the penguin pollution , an efficient use of mixing - induced cp violation in @xmath0 decays , measured by @xmath12 , can be made by combining it with the corresponding observable from @xmath2 , @xmath1 , to obtain the unitarity triangle parameters @xmath17 and @xmath18 .",
    "the sensitivity on the hadronic quantities , which have typical values @xmath78 , @xmath79 , is very weak . in particular , there are no first - order corrections in @xmath22 . for moderate values of @xmath22",
    "its effect is negligible .",
    "concerning our penguin parameters , namely @xmath21 and @xmath22 , they were investigated systematically within the qcdf framework . to validate our theoretical predictions",
    ", we have calculate these parameters in the @xmath29 and @xmath30 expansion , which exhibits a good framework to control the uncalculable power corrections , in the factorization formalism . as an alternative proposition , we have also considered to extract @xmath21 and @xmath22 from other @xmath3 decay channels , such as @xmath36 and @xmath37 , relying on the su(3 ) argument . using these three different approaches",
    ", we found a compatible picture in estimating these hadronic parameters .",
