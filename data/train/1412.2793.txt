    "the late stages of evolution of low- to intermediate - mass stars ( 1 - 8 @xmath4 ) are characterized by high rates of mass loss on the red and asymptotic giant branches ( rg and agb , respectively ) . during the post - agb phase",
    "the lost mass is shaped by a fast , possibly collimated , wind into a planetary nebula ( pn ) that is ionized by the bright ( @xmath5 ) and hot ( @xmath6  kk ) central star ( cspn ) . after reaching their highest temperatures , the cspne turn back in the h - r diagram towards lower temperatures and luminosities as they approach the white dwarf ( wd ) cooling track .",
    "this post - agb / pre - wd evolutionary period is short - lived ( @xmath7 years depending on the initial mass of the star ) . if one ignores the potentially important effects of binarity , the evolution of the pn proceeds in lock step with the cspn on a given evolutionary mass track , with the nebular density being the highest early in the evolution and decreasing as the cspn approaches the wd cooling track .",
    "peculiar spectral types are littered along this evolutionary path @xcite ; some central stars show strong wolf - rayet - like emission lines , some share characteristics with the class of h - deficient pg1159-type stars , and others are classified as hot sub - dwarfs , sometimes in close binary systems with late - type companions . whether any of these peculiar spectral types follow a common evolutionary sequence is a matter of open debate @xcite .",
    "pne are commonly detected as x - ray sources ( kastner et al .",
    "2012 ; hereafter , * ? ? ?",
    "typically , this x - ray emission from pne comes in two forms : ( 1 ) compact point - like sources in the vicinity of the central stars and ( 2 ) extended diffuse x - ray emission from adiabatic shocks and hot bubbles ( see * ? ? ? * and references therein ) . in the 1990 s ,",
    "rosat established that most pne detected in x - rays generated x - ray photons with energies @xmath8  kev , consistent with emission from the photospheres of hot cspne @xcite .",
    "but a few rosat spectra of pne featured x - ray emission @xmath90.5 kev .",
    "several of these were later established by the chandra x - ray observatory to originate from diffuse nebular emission ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "the notable exception is the central star of the helix nebula , whose `` hard '' x - ray emission remains point - like even at chandra s subarcsecond resolution @xcite .",
    "since cspne can reach temperatures of 100 - 200 kk , photospheric x - ray emission from cspne is not unexpected , but any `` hard '' x - ray emission , i.e. x - ray photons with energies @xmath90.5 kev , might be expected to fall below the detection threshold ( see appendix  [ appendixa ] ) .",
    "nonetheless , energetic photons @xmath90.5 kev are detected from roughly a third of those observed cspne ( paper i ; freeman et al .",
    "2014 , hereafter paper ii ) .    the origins and emission mechanisms underlying these point - like hard x - ray sources are unclear , but a few scenarios have been proposed . when similarly hard x - ray emitting sources are observed in white dwarfs ,",
    "they are typically attributed to known binary companions with active coronae @xcite .",
    "@xcite argued in favor of a binary origin for hard x - ray emission from cspne known to harbor companions . in two post - common envelope binary ( pceb )",
    "central stars , ds 1 and hfg 1 , and a binary cspn with a rapidly rotating giant companion , lotr 5 , the x - ray spectra indicated plasma temperatures @xmath10  mk and ratios of x - ray to bolometric luminosity , @xmath11 , at or near coronal saturation levels ( i.e. , @xmath12 ) given the spectral type and bolometric luminosities of the companions .",
    "this led @xcite to suggest that the companions were spun - up during the evolution of the cspn , perhaps by past wind accretion , exchange of orbital energy , or synchronization of the binary orbit and stellar rotation .",
    "however , in the case of the helix central star  which is the brightest and best - studied example of such hard x - ray emission @xcite  evidence for a binary companion is only tentative @xcite , underscoring the need for caution in invoking companions as sources of the hard x - rays from cspne .",
    "alternatively , instabilities in the line - driven stellar winds from cspne may also produce x - ray emitting shocks in the immediate vicinity of the central star , as has been theorized to explain x - ray emission in o - stars .",
    "indeed , @xcite have demonstrated the importance of such wind - shock - generated x - ray emission on the photospheric ionization structure in a sample of h - rich cspne with far - uv , uv , and optical spectroscopy .",
    "they find that x - ray fluxes from shocks are necessary to explain the uv emission from high ionization species of oxygen ( and ) in the coolest cspne ( @xmath13  kk ) and can also play a role at higher cspn temperatures .",
    "@xcite have also included x - ray fluxes from shocks in their modeling of central star spectra .",
    "their model does not require wind clumping , instead utilizing a self - consistent hydrodynamic method for determining the cspn and wind parameters . in both examples ,",
    "the authors stress the need for x - ray flux to reproduce the observed uv spectra ; hence , the origin of many or perhaps most hard - x - ray emitting cspne may be shocks in the circumstellar environment . studied the uv spectra of several cspne observed by the far ultraviolet spectroscopic explorer ( fuse ) and found that cspne with variable p cygni profiles can show high ionization potential ions ( e.g. , ) even though the cspn effective temperatures are too low to to yield such high ionization states .",
    "the authors suggested that auger ionization from x - ray emission associated with shocks in the cspn stellar winds are responsible for these highly ionized ions , as is the case in massive ob stars .",
    "additional explanations for hard x - rays from cspne potentially offer novel explorations of other physical processes :    * a low - level rate of accretion of pn material , so - called `` back flow '' @xcite , could explain the x - ray emission .",
    "in the presence of a strong stellar wind spherical accretion is unlikely and for back flow to occur , the material must be dense and limited to a small solid angle @xcite",
    ". however , for an evolved cspn like that of the helix , for which the stellar wind is weak fall back of nebular material can not be ruled out .",
    "* model atmospheres that account for the effects of departures from local thermodynamic equilibrium ( i.e. , non - lte models ) predict an excess of `` hard '' x - ray emission for the hottest cspne . * a cspn on its way to becoming a highly magnetic white dwarf @xcite may display magnetic reconnection events and energetic x - ray flaring . * if most pne form from binary systems @xcite , then colliding winds between the two stars could provide strong shocks capable of producing x - ray emission , as in symbiotic stars and o star binary systems ( e.g. , * ? ? ?",
    "* ) , but if the secondary is a late type star , the winds may be too weak to support such a scenario",
    ".    clearly , for any of these potential explanations for the point - like x - ray emitting sources detected at cspne , the binary and wind properties of the cspn are essential characteristics that can help determine the origin of the x - ray emission .",
    "the chandra planetary nebulae survey ( chanplans ) , described in papers i & ii , has resulted in detections of point - like sources of x - ray emission in the 0.3 - 3.0 kev band for 20 of 59 pne observed thus far0.3 kev . ] . in this third paper of chanplans",
    ", we explore the x - ray emission from central stars in greater detail .",
    "we evaluate emission models against the observed x - ray characteristics (  2.2 &  2.3 ) .",
    "we then use these models to analyze the spectra of the 20 x - ray emitting cspne (  2.4 &  2.5 ) .",
    "the results of our spectral analysis are presented in  3 .",
    "we have considered these results when estimating upper limits for the 39 undetected cspne (  3.7 ) .",
    "finally , we present a summary and discussion the origin of point - like sources of x - ray emission from cspne (  4 ) .",
    "our observations are comprised of archival and targeted observations performed by the chandra x - ray observatory ( cxo ) , typically with the back - illuminated chip ( s3 ) of the advanced ccd for imaging spectroscopy ( acis ) , which provides optimal soft x - ray sensitivity .",
    "we follow all recommended data preparation steps and use source detection algorithms to find x - ray source coordinates , count rates , and limits .",
    "these steps and procedures are described in the chanplans overview paper @xcite . in the following , we detail the various analyses employed specifically for the study of point - like x - ray sources detected among the chanplans pne .",
    "we have extracted source and background x - ray count rates , median energies , and spectra for all observed central stars using the ciao x - ray data analysis software package ( ciaov4.6 ; * ? ? ?",
    "source and background extraction regions were selected to avoid contamination from field x - ray sources and , when present , diffuse x - ray emission .",
    "some x - ray point sources are embedded within extended x - ray emission ( e.g. , ngc 6543 , ngc 2392 ) and we discuss these cases in detail in  2.5 . to better isolate the point - like sources we employed the sub - pixel repositioning ( ser ) algorithm @xcite . by employing this algorithm",
    ", we decrease the fwhm of the psf by 40 - 70% @xcite , thereby allowing us to use the smallest source extraction region possible . nevertheless , diffuse x - ray emission may still contaminate the point source spectra , as we further discuss in  2.5 .",
    "the off - axis observation of lotr 5 requires a larger extraction region ; for further details we refer the reader to @xcite .      since the central stars have to be hot enough to ionize their nebulae ( @xmath14  kk ) , we first attempted to model the x - ray emission with photospheric models .",
    "the photospheric models we considered included blackbody distributions , solar abundance nlte models , and nlte atmosphere models with pg1159-like abundances .",
    "however , as demonstrated in appendix  [ appendixa ] , in most cases these photospheric mechanisms are unlikely to contribute significantly to x - ray emission in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev energy band .",
    "however , photospheric contributions to x - ray emission at energies @xmath15 0.3 kev are definitely a possibility . indeed , all the x - ray photons detected from the central star of m 27 have energies @xmath15 0.3 kev and are therefore likely due to the @xmath16130 kk central star photosphere . however , since the standard calibrations provided by the chandra x - ray center are not reliable for energies less than 0.3 kev ( see discussion in * ? ? ? * ) , we only consider models that can produce photons with energies @xmath17  kev . in appendix",
    "[ appendixa ] , we demonstrate that only the hottest , h - deficient , high - gravity central stars seem capable of producing detectable x - ray flux for photon energies @xmath17 kev . yet , even in these few instances , it is necessary to introduce an additional source of x - ray emission to reproduce the x - ray spectra for energies @xmath17 kev @xcite .",
    "we conclude that a purely photospheric origin is difficult to reconcile with the chanplans observations of x - rays from cspne .",
    "hence , for the remainder of our analysis , we explore optically - thin thermal plasma as the most promising emission model for the x - ray emission with photon energies @xmath180.3 kev detected from cspne ( as demonstrated in the following section ) .",
    "it is important to note that in choosing to focus on thermal plasma models , we have specified the emission model , but not the physical origin of the x - ray emission , since such models can be used to describe accretion , wind shocks , and coronal emission .    in the analysis that follows",
    ", we adopt an optically - thin thermal plasma model ( aped / apec ; * ? ? ?",
    "* ) parameterized by its abundances , temperatures , and emission measure .",
    "we assume solar abundances @xcite but note that deviations from solar abundances can affect the x - ray spectrum if the x - ray emission originates from highly - ionized emission lines in the metal - rich winds ( see  [ discussion ] ) .",
    "we include the effects of intervening absorption  which may be due to circumstellar and/or interstellar material  by means of the ` wabs ` absorption model @xcite .     versus median energy for absorbed thermal plasma models and for point - like x - ray emitting sources detected in the chanplans survey ( papers i & ii ) .",
    "plasma temperatures , log  @xmath19 ( k ) , are labeled on the model curves .",
    "known binary cspne and hot cspne with wr or pg1159 spectral type have been identified as diamond and square symbols , respectively .",
    "the cspn of the helix nebula is identified by a hexagon symbol .",
    "the model - corrected median energies of ngc 2392 and ngc 6543 ( see  [ embedsec ] ) are connected to the lower - energy , uncorrected points by a dashed line .",
    "the left - most point in this figure is the central star of m 27 , which produces no photons above 0.3 kev and is the only source on this diagram characteristic of the `` pure '' x - ray emission of a hot photosphere .",
    "objects with little to no extinction ( as measured by @xmath20 ) are placed at @xmath21 .",
    "[ medenhfig ] ]      to verify that the x - ray characteristics of cspne are best modeled by an optically - thin thermal plasma , we considered the relevant general parameter space of the absorbed plasma models via a grid of model calculations . for ranges of intervening hydrogen column density ( @xmath22 ) from @xmath23 and characteristic plasma temperature ( @xmath19 ) from 1 to 40 mk , with solar abundances , we convolved the plasma models with representative chandra / acis effective area and response matrix calibration files to produce a grid of x - ray spectra .",
    "we then determined the median energy of each resulting x - ray spectral distribution to find the locus of a given @xmath19 in a plot of @xmath22 versus median energy .",
    "the resulting loci are plotted in figure  [ medenhfig ] and show the behavior of the median energies that would be measured from these absorbed thermal plasma models .",
    "positions of the cspne are also indicated in figure  [ medenhfig ] , with their values of @xmath22 estimated from the @xmath20 logarithmic extinction coefficient determined in @xcite and @xcite .",
    "we used the relationships @xmath24 , adopted from @xcite , @xmath25 with @xmath26 , and @xmath27 @xcite to convert @xmath20 to @xmath22 . for cases where @xmath28 we have set @xmath29 .",
    "uncertainties on estimates of the optical extinction ( @xmath20 ) range from a few percent up to 50% , leading to uncertainties of up to 30% in @xmath30 .",
    "however , it is likely that the dominant source of uncertainty in the resulting adopted values of @xmath22 is the @xmath31 to @xmath22 conversion factor ( i.e. , essentially the dust / gas ratio in the absorbing medium ) .",
    "indeed , it is important to point out that the @xmath20 measurements are determined from the balmer decrement of the nebular emission , hence are representative of the extinction between the observer and the hydrogen recombination zone of the nebula .",
    "additional absorption of x - ray emission by the ionized material between the central star and this hydrogen recombination zone nebula is possible .",
    "such an effect is presumably stronger in the most compact nebulae , for which the nebular densities are highest , and becomes less important for larger nebulae .",
    "nevertheless , figure  [ medenhfig ] indicates that absorbed thermal plasma emission models can reproduce the observed distributions of median energies and @xmath22 that are characteristic of point - source x - ray emission from pne .",
    "we analyzed our extracted spectra in xspec ( version 12.7.1 ; * ? ? ? * ) by fitting optically - thin isothermal plasma models with solar abundances and suffering intervening absorption ( characterized by the column density of h atoms , @xmath22 ) .",
    "it is important to note that our observations and detections are generally photon - starved .",
    "the source photons ( background - subtracted ) number as few as 6 , with a median number of detected photons for all sources of 36 ( see table 3 in both papers i & ii ) . only 6 sources have more than 100 photons detected . due to the low counts",
    ", we find a combination of churazov weighting and monte carlo markov chains ( mcmc ) provides the best balance of spectral fit constraints and `` goodness '' estimation .",
    "we used 10,000 steps in our mcmc analysis for each spectral fit and studied the @xmath32 and model parameter ( @xmath22 , @xmath19 , and model normalization ) distributions to identify ill - fitting models .",
    "we performed spectral fits over the 0.3 - 3.0 kev energy range for two alternative models , one with @xmath22 set to a value calculated from the observed value of @xmath20 ( referred to as the `` fixed-@xmath22 '' model and `` model 1 '' ) and another with @xmath22 as a free parameter ( referred to as the `` free-@xmath22 '' model and `` model 2 '' ) .",

    "this comparison suggests that a similar mechanism , i.e. , self - shocking winds , might be producing the point - like x - ray emission from many , perhaps most , cspne .",
    "this is further supported by the fact that during the high - luminosity phase of post - agb evolution , where a majority of our detections are made , stellar winds are strongest and subsequently fade after the temperature of the central star has peaked @xcite .",
    "further evidence for self - shocking winds comes from uv spectroscopy where cspne with variable p cygni profiles are observed with high ionization potential ions ( e.g. , ) despite low effective temperatures , which is interpreted as auger ionization from x - ray emission due to shocks in their stellar winds . for x - ray generation via self - shocking winds , the variation in the wind speed is more important than the absolute value .",

    "it is tempting to conclude that all sources with log  @xmath240 are caused by self - shocking stellar winds .",
    "however , the cspn of ngc 1360 lacks a strong stellar wind  as determined from ultraviolet satellite spectroscopy  and the cspn of ds 1 , which harbors a close binary system and whose companion is likely responsible for the x - ray emission @xcite , may only fall into this range coincidentally .",
    "the extant uv observations of ngc 1360 and other cspne without detected uv winds may not have been sensitive to weak p cygni line profiles , but this should also make detection of the x - ray emission from wind shocks more difficult . there is also the remote possibility that the lower ionization stages that would appear in uv emission are unpopulated because the shock - heated circumstellar atoms are at higher ionization stages , producing emission primarily in the x - ray regime .",
    "though beyond the scope of this paper , a more rigorous comparison between the uv and x - ray emission of such metal - rich self - shocking stellar winds is clearly necessary .    .",

    "the cspne that are known or suspected binaries are spread throughout the @xmath237 range , consistent with their x - ray properties being uncorrelated with the cspn properties .",
    "indeed , several of these sources have been previously analyzed @xcite , yielding evidence that a saturated ( log  @xmath243 ) late - type binary companion is the source of the x - ray emission .",
    "the present study supports these previous results , in that the known binary cspne are among the hottest x - ray sources , with plasma temperatures near or above @xmath244 k  consistent with the x - rays arising in coronae associated with late - type binary companions .",
    "nearly 70% of such high-@xmath33 sources  which represent the leftmost sources in figure  [ medenhfig ]  have close binary systems or active companions .",
    "this trend towards hotter plasma temperatures amongst the close binary systems naturally suggests that the cspne of ngc 2392 , ngc 6445 , and ngc 7008 are ideal candidates for follow - up searches for heretofore undetected binary companions .",
    "indeed , @xcite report a tentative close binary signature in the radial velocities measured for the cspn of ngc 2392 .",
    "meanwhile , although the spectral fits are uncertain , the hot , hydrogen - deficient pg1159 stars trend towards higher @xmath237 ratios , suggesting a contribution from photospheric emission , perhaps including nlte effects , in addition to emission from self - shocking winds .",
    "@xcite found that the x - ray spectrum ngc 246 includes emission from the photospheric continuum but is dominated by a complex of and emission lines from 0.3 - 0.4 kev ; such behavior is not well - modeled by our choice of plasma model , leading to a poor spectral fit and , hence , large uncertainty in the x - ray luminosity .",
    "similar spectral characteristics are seen in the pg1159 cspn of k 1 - 16 , for which @xcite used a composite photospheric and carbon - enriched plasma model for the x - ray spectrum .",
    "the presence of stellar winds and binary companions amongst the x - ray emitting cspne naturally guides our attempt to find a causal relationship to the x - ray emission .",
    "but there are additional potential origins for cspn x - ray emission .",
    "the magnetic wind confinement model ( mwcm ) has been offered as a potential explanation for the anomalously hard x - ray emission from certain young o stars ; in the case of the o - star @xmath245 , a fossil kg magnetic field is invoked to redirect the stellar wind towards the equator , where the northern and southern components collide @xcite .",
    "although the x - ray emission from such a mwcm source would share characteristics with that of x - ray emission from cspne , we point out that kg large - scale magnetic fields have been ruled out from all cspne measured in a recent study by .",
    "nine objects in the study are x - ray emitting cspne .",
    "a scaled down version of mwcm , with magnetic fields of a few hundred g , remains possible .",
    "the value @xmath246 that is characteristic of o - stars is not uniquely associated to self - shocking winds ; in fact , colliding wind binaries ( cwb ) also display a similar ratio @xcite . in this case ,",
    "stellar winds from two massive stars collide to form x - ray emitting plasma between the two stars .",
    "such a scenario in cspne would require two stars driving stellar winds of similar strength yet no such candidates exist among the x - ray emitting cspne .",
    "nevertheless , a search for synchrotron radiation from these x - ray emitting cspne may help determine if a cwb - mechanism is responsible for the x - ray emission .",
    "accretion onto the cspn is another potential origin for the observed x - ray emission ; indeed , accretion disk winds have been invoked as a pn shaping mechanism @xcite . in @xcite",
    "we considered accretion in detail for the pceb cspne ds 1 , hfg 1 , and lotr 5 and found this scenario difficult to reconcile with observations .",
    "many of the arguments made in @xcite apply to the larger chanplans sample of x - ray emitting cspne .",
    "first , the maximum temperature for an accretion disk around a typical cspn barely reaches @xmath247  k in the most compact cspn , but these are also the most evolved cspne and are seldom detected in x - rays . in those cspne that are detected , the x - ray plasma temperature is an order of magnitude hotter than expected from an accretion disk .",
    "second , accretion directly onto the surface of a cspn is possible but requires a reservoir for the accreting gas and dust , such as fallback of nebular material @xcite . any spherical accretion onto the surface of the cspn will have to contend with the outflowing stellar wind ; thus spherical accretion is unlikely in cspne with strong winds , hence accretion , if it does occur , is likely to involve an accretion disk .",
    "to first approximation , the temperature of material free - falling onto a cspn could reach @xmath248  k @xcite , but perhaps an isobaric cooling flow , such as is thought to arise from the boundary layer in wds in cataclysmic variable ( cv ) systems , is more likely @xcite . indeed , the x - ray characteristics of cspn are similar to those observed from cooling flows in cvs , but with even cooler temperatures that could perhaps be attributed to the larger radii of the contracting cspne . on the subject of accretion disks , pulsed jets launched by the young stellar objects",
    "may produce x - ray emission that remains stationary , at the base of the jets , and display x - ray properties similar to these observed from cspne @xcite .",
    "such a pulsed jet could be the shaping agent of pn .",
    "@xcite have found evidence for polar - oriented , high - velocity outflow in uv spectra of ngc 2392 .",
    "if such polar outflows are ubiquitous features of cspne , shocks at the bases of these outflows should be considered among the potential origins of cspn x - ray emission .",
    "the nondetections and their estimated upper limits reveal the limitations of our observations in detecting the different classes of cspn x - ray emission found thus far . for the most conservative upper limit estimates",
    " which are based on a plasma temperature of 1 mk , i.e. , what we expect for wind shocks , our upper limits on @xmath237 ratios suggest that the observations can not rule out x - ray emission at a level with log  @xmath240 for a majority of our cspne ( see figure  [ lxlbol ] ) .",
    "only 20 - 30% of our upper limit ratios lie at or below log  @xmath249 .",
    "examination of our upper limit calculations for a 1 mk plasma reveal that the upper limits on x - ray luminosities are more strongly correlated with @xmath22 than with distance .",
    "the distribution of nondetections skews towards higher @xmath22 values compared to the detected cspne .",
    "it is furthermore apparent that the upper limits on x - ray luminosities for a 1 mk plasma have steadily worsened since the launch of _ chandra _ due to its decreased soft x - ray sensitivity @xcite .",
    "this combination of high @xmath22 and decreasing soft x - ray sensitivity likely explains the decrease the detection rate in later cycles .",
    "on the other hand , the upper limits calculated by assuming a higher temperature plasma ( 8 mk ) are less sensitive to these effects and exhibit relatively stable behavior since the launch of _",
    "chandra_. these `` hard '' x - ray emission upper limits can be used to further exclude potential spun - up binary companions . in this context , we briefly discuss the known close binary systems that were not detected in our observations .",
    "five of the nine close binary systems in our sample are detected , and these cspne display some of the hardest x - ray spectra .",
    "the four close binary cspne that were not detected are abell 65 , hen 2 - 11 , ngc 2346 , and ngc 6026 , which have orbital periods of 1 , 0.6 , 16 , and 0.53 days , respectively .",
    "@xcite suggests the secondary star in ngc 6026 might be a compact white dwarf based on its compact size and high luminosity of @xmath250 ; hence this cspn companion is unlikely to harbor a rejuvenated corona that would appear as a luminous x - ray source , and we do not consider it further . the heavily absorbed nucleus and uncertainty of the binary system parameters of the cspn in ngc 2346",
    " may consist of a compact sdo star and an a star , similar to ngc 1514 @xcite renders conclusions difficult .",
    "the upper limit x - ray luminosities derived from our observations of the remaining undetected binary cspne ( abell 65 and hen 2 - 11 ) for an 8 mk plasma are 1.4 and 8.9@xmath251 , respectively ( see table  [ upperlimits ] ) .",
    "for the secondaries found in abell 65 @xcite and hen 2 - 11 , the limit on log  @xmath252 is -3.6 and -2.8 , respectively .",
    "these two limits are similar to what we expect to observe from spun - up companions , thus deeper observations may yet detect saturated ( or somewhat less than saturated ) x - ray emission from the companions .",
    "we have studied x - ray emission in the 0.3 - 3.0 kev energy band from the cspne observed thus far as part of the chanplans project .",
    "we performed spectral analysis of 20 point - like sources of cspn x - ray emission and determined upper limits for 39 undetected cspne .",
    "the majority of the detected cspne spectra are well modeled as absorbed optically - thin thermal plasmas .",
    "the collective characteristics of the cspne and their x - ray emission suggest to two likely origins , ( 1 ) coronal activity associated with late - type binary companions and ( 2 ) self - shocking stellar winds .",
    "these two processes can be distinguished based on cspn x - ray emission characteristics .",
    "we find that the ratio of x - ray to bolometric luminosity , @xmath237 , and characteristic x - ray plasma temperature , @xmath33 , can be used as first - order discriminators of binary companion versus shock origins for the x - ray emission : high - temperature plasmas ( @xmath253 mk ) with no clear correlation between @xmath1 and the central star bolometric luminosity are likely due to active binary companions , whereas low temperature plasmas and values of log  @xmath240 are indicative of wind shocks .",
    "for the hottest central stars ( @xmath254 kk ) , we can not rule out a contribution from photospheric emission in the spectral energy distribution for photon energies @xmath255  kev , but only 2 - 3 cspne with x - ray emission fall into this range thus far . optical and/or infrared spectroscopic evidence of cspn binarity and stellar winds , where available , generally provides support for the preceding wind and active late - type companion mechanisms as likely origins of cspn x - ray emission .",
    "these two classes of cspn x - ray emission ",
    "self - shocking winds and binary companions  may offer constraints for models of pn formation and shaping .",
    "ejection of a common envelope , resulting in a close binary pn nucleus , is invoked as a mechanism to explain pn formation @xcite .",
    "such systems produce characteristic shapes and structures in their nebulae and , based on the analysis of chanplans observations presented here , it appears hard x - ray emission may be characteristic of the resulting cspn .",
    "x - ray emission from self - shocking stellar winds provide unique constraints of the circumstellar conditions ( densities , energetics , and radiation ) of cspne .",
    "the presence of such shocks also emphasize the instabilities of cspn winds , providing a vital new ingredient for models that invoke shaping by a fast stellar wind .",
    "meanwhile , alternative origins of the x - ray emission hint at polar outflows and equatorial material , structures often invoked to explain the shapes of pn via hydrodynamic interactions . by better establishing the potential origin(s ) of the cspn x - ray emission  via observations of additional pne selected",
    "so as to maximize the likelihood of detecting x - rays from binary companions and wind shocks , as well as through deeper observations of the brightest cspn x - ray sources detected thus far  we can further tap the potential of cspn x - ray sources to constrain models describing pn shaping .",

    "we consider the potential for photospheric emission , modeled by blackbody distributions or nlte atmosphere models , to emit x - ray photons in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev energy range .",
    "we begin by considering the best case scenario ( appropriate for , e.g. , ngc 7293 or m 27 ) , i.e. , a cspn at a distance of 0.25 kpc from the sun with negligible absorption . based on the typical background rates of our sample , we take the detection threshold of an on - axis observation on the chandra acis - s3 chip in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev energy band as @xmath256 .",
    "this corresponds to an x - ray luminosity threshold of @xmath257 for comparison with observations , we scale the x - ray luminosity by the central star bolometric luminosity , @xmath2 , which can range from a few tens of @xmath258 up to @xmath259 . for a bright central star with @xmath260 , log  @xmath261",
    ", this suggests that to produce x - ray flux in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev band , log  @xmath11 must satisfy the following condition : @xmath262 in the following section we use the above criteria to determine the photospheric models that might contribute detectable x - ray flux for energies larger than 0.3 kev .",
    "we use blackbody distributions and nlte model atmospheres to model the photospheric emission of the cspne .",
    "the blackbody model is determined by the temperature and model normalization , which is derived from the distance - scaled luminosity .",
    "the nlte atmosphere models are characterized by temperature , model normalization , which is also derived from the distance - scaled luminosity , and a limited grid of log  @xmath263 .",
    "furthermore , we consider two chemically - distinct nlte atmosphere models , an h - rich model with solar metal abundances and an h - poor model with metal abundances typical of pg1159-type cspne . for more information on these nlte models ,",
    "the reader is referred to .",
    "these models are folded with the instrumental responses to produce observed x - ray spectra from which we calculate observed fluxes and median energies .        in figure  [ appendix_fig1 ] , we present the ratios of the x - ray luminosity in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev energy band with the bolometric luminosity of the central star for each model",
    ". the absorption - free detection limits for a range of distances of chanplans targets are included in figure  [ appendix_fig1 ] .",
    "these limits suggest that only blackbody distributions with @xmath264 kk can produce detectable flux in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev energy band",
    ". however , at such high temperatures , nlte effects like metal line - blanketing begin to dominate the high - energy , low - wavelength spectrum .",
    "the h - rich nlte models are not capable of producing detected x - ray emission in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev energy range for the typical range of central star temperatures",
    ". however , h - poor , pg1159-type nlte models with central star temperature ( @xmath254 kk ) can produce detectable x - ray flux in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev energy band , but the detectability decreases with distance and absorption .        [ [ detectable - x - ray - flux - from - only - the - hottest - and - brightest - h - deficient - cspne ] ] detectable x - ray flux from only the hottest and brightest h - deficient cspne ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~    ultimately , these considerations suggest that only the hottest and brightest ( nearest ) h - deficient central stars are capable of producing detected x - ray flux in the 0.3 - 8.0 kev energy range .",
    "one such system , the central star of pn k 1 - 16 , was considered in @xcite , where they found the nlte model atmosphere successfully modeled soft x - ray emission below 0.3 kev and some x - ray emission above 0.3 kev , but not the excess flux at @xmath160.35 kev . the authors modeled this excess flux with a carbon - rich plasma likely due to shocks in the circumstellar environment . indeed , examining the x - ray spectra of the nlte model atmospheres ( @xmath265 kk provided in figure  [ appendix_fig2 ] ) reveals the excess is above 0.5 kev .",
    "the transition from low - energy median energies to that above 0.5 kev , is quite sudden as a function of @xmath22 , as indicated in figure  [ appendix_fig3 ] .",
    "this is due to the severe effect of absorption on the soft x - ray photons predicted by the nlte models .",
    "both @xcite and @xcite include non - photospheric x - ray emitting components in their modeling of cspne spectra , indicating either nlte models are not accurately predicting the x - ray emission or pointing towards a non - photospheric source of x - ray emission ."

    "<S> we present x - ray spectral analysis of 20 point - like x - ray sources detected in chandra planetary nebula survey ( chanplans ) observations of 59 planetary nebulae ( pne ) in the solar neighborhood . </S>",

    "<S> instead , we demonstrate that these sources are well modeled by optically - thin thermal plasmas . from the plasma properties , we identify two classes of cspn x - ray emission : ( 1 ) high - temperature plasmas with x - ray luminosities , @xmath1 , that appear uncorrelated with the cspn bolometric luminosity , @xmath2 ; and ( 2 ) lower - temperature plasmas with @xmath3 . </S>",
    "<S> we suggest these two classes correspond to the physical processes of magnetically active binary companions and self - shocking stellar winds , respectively . in many cases this conclusion is supported by corroborative multiwavelength evidence for the wind and binary properties of the pn central stars . by thus honing in on the origins of x - ray emission from pn central stars , we enhance the ability of cspn x - ray sources to constrain models of pn shaping that invoke wind interactions and binarity . </S>"
