    "as one of the most compelling evidences for new physics beyond the standard model ( sm ) , the cosmic dark matter ( dm ) has been widely studied in particle physics @xcite .",
    "recently , the cdms - ii collaboration observed three events which can be explained by a light dm with mass about 8.6 gev and a spin - independent dm - nucleon scattering cross section of about @xmath1 pb @xcite .",
    "the existence of such a light dm seems to be corroborated by other direct detections such as the cogent @xcite , cresst @xcite and dama / libra @xcite .",
    "moreover , a light dm is also hinted by fermi - lat , a satellite - based dm indirect detection experiment @xcite .",
    "recent analysis of the fermi - lat data exhibits peaks in the gamma - ray spectrum at energies around 1 - 10 gev , which could be interpreted in terms of the annihilation of a dm with mass low than about 60 gev into leptons or bottom quarks @xcite . about these experimental results",
    ", it should be noted that they are not completely consistent with each other , and more seriously , they conflict with the xenon data @xcite and the latest lux result @xcite .",
    "so the issue of light dm leaves unresolved and will be a focal point both experimentally and theoretically . on the experimental side , many experiments like lux , xenon , cdms and cdex @xcite will continue their searches , while on the theoretical side we need to examine if such a light dark matter can naturally be predicted in popular new physics theories such as low energy supersymmetry ( susy ) .",
    "previous studies @xcite showed that , in the framework of the next - to - minimal supersymmetric standard model ( nmssm ) @xcite , a light neutralino dm around 10 gev is allowed by the collider constraints and dm relic density ( in contrast such a light dm is not easy to obtain in the mssm @xcite or cmssm @xcite ) . in nmssm , due to the presence of a singlet superfield @xmath2 , we have five neutralinos , three cp - even higgs bosons ( @xmath3 ) and two cp - odd higgs bosons ( @xmath4 ) @xcite .",
    "the mass eigenstates of neutralinos are the mixture of the neutral singlino ( @xmath5 ) , bino ( @xmath6 ) , wino ( @xmath7 ) and higgsinos ( @xmath8 , @xmath9 ) ; while the cp - even ( odd ) higgs mass eigenstates are the mixture of the real ( imaginary ) part of the singlet scalar @xmath10 and the cp - even ( odd ) mssm doublet higgs fields",
    ". an important feature of the nmssm is that the lightest cp - even ( odd ) higgs boson @xmath11 can be singlet - like and very light , and the lightest neutralino ( @xmath12 ) can be singlino - like and also very light . as a result , the spin - independent neutralino - nucleon scattering cross section can be enhanced to reach the cdms - ii value by the @xmath13channel mediation of a light @xmath14 @xcite . meanwhile , the dm relic density can be consistent with the measured value either through the @xmath15channel resonance effect of @xmath11 in dm annihilation or through the annihilation into a pair of light @xmath14 or @xmath16 @xcite .",
    "note that such a light dm in the nmssm should be re - examined because the latest lhc data may give severe constraints .",
    "due to the presence of a light dm and concurrently a light @xmath16 or @xmath14 , the sm - like higgs boson ( @xmath17 ) can have new decays @xmath18 and @xmath19 @xcite . as analyzed in @xcite , such decays may be subject to stringent constraints from the current lhc higgs data @xcite .",
    "besides , since a certain amount of higgsino component in @xmath12 is needed to strengthen the coupling of @xmath20 ( or @xmath21 ) which is necessary for the dm annihilation , the higgsino - dominated neutralinos and the chargino @xmath22 are generally not very heavy and will be constrained by the searches for events with three leptons and missing transverse momentum ( @xmath23 +  /@xmath24  ) at 8 tev lhc @xcite . in this work",
    ", we consider these latest lhc data and examine the status of a light dm in the nmssm .",
    "we note that a recent study @xcite tried to explain the cdms - ii results in terms of a light dm in the nmssm .",
    "compared to @xcite which only studied three representative benchmark points , we perform a numerical scan under various experimental constraints and display the allowed parameter space in comparison with the the direct detection results of cogent , cdms - ii and lux .",
    "we also perform a global fit of the higgs data using the package @xcite , in which we further consider the latest lhc results of higgs invisible decay from the channel @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "moreover , we consider the constraints from the searches for events with @xmath23 +  /@xmath24  signal at 8 tev lhc @xcite .",
    "the paper is organized as follows .",
    "in sec.ii we list the experimental constraints and describe our scan .",
    "in sect.iii we present our results and perform detailed analysis . finally , we draw our conclusions in sec.iv .",
    "in order to reduce the number of free parameters in our scan over the nmssm parameter space , we make some assumptions on the parameters that do not influence dm properties significantly . explicitly speaking , we fix gluino mass and all the soft mass parameters in squark sector at 2 tev , and those in slepton sector at 300 gev .",
    "we also assume the soft trilinear couplings @xmath26 and let them vary to tune the higgs mass . moreover , in order to predict a bino - like light dm and also to avoid the constraints from @xmath27 invisible decay @xcite , we abandon the gut relation between @xmath28 and @xmath29 .",
    "the free parameters are then @xmath30 in the higgs sector , the gaugino and higgsino mass parameters @xmath31 and @xmath32 , and the soft trilinear couplings of the third generation squarks @xmath33 . in this work , we define all these parameters at @xmath34 scale and adopt the markov chain monte carlo ( mcmc ) method to scan the following parameter ranges using @xmath35 @xcite : @xmath36 note here that the ranges of @xmath37 and @xmath38 are motivated to avoid landau pole , generally corresponding to the requirement of @xmath39 .",
    "this has been encoded in @xmath35 including the consideration of the interplay between @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the renormalization group running .",
    "a relatively small @xmath32 is chosen to avoid strong cancelation in getting the @xmath27 boson mass @xcite , and as we will see below , the upper bound of @xmath40 for @xmath32 here suffices our study and does not affect our main conclusions .",
    "also note that we artificially impose a lower bound of 320 gev for @xmath29 .",
    "this is motivated by the fact that @xmath29 in our study is not an important parameter , and that as required by the @xmath23 +  /@xmath24",
    "constraint @xmath29 should be larger than about 320 gev in the simplified model discussed in @xcite ( also see the constraint ( viii ) discussed below ) .",
    "the relevant @xmath41 function for the mcmc scan is build to guarantee the dm relic density and the sm - like higgs boson mass around their measured values . in our discussion , we consider the samples surviving the following constraints :    * @xmath42 and @xmath43 .",
    "* _ the constraints from b - physics_. the light cp - even / odd higgs bosons can significantly affect the b - physics observables .",
    "especially , the precise measurements of radiative decays @xmath44 @xcite , @xmath45 @xcite and @xmath46 @xcite can give stringent constraints .",
    "so we require the samples to satisfy these b - physics bounds at 2@xmath47 level . *",
    "_ dm relic density_. as the sole dark matter candidate , the lightest neutralino @xmath12 is required to produce the correct thermal relic density .",
    "we require the neutralino relic density to be in the @xmath48 range of the planck and wmap 9-year data , @xmath49 , where a 10% theoretical uncertainty is included @xcite .",
    "* _ muon g-2_. we require nmssm to explain the muon anomalous magnetic moment data @xmath50 @xcite at @xmath48 level . * _ the absence of landau pole_. we impose this constraint using @xmath35 @xcite , where the interplay of @xmath37 and @xmath38 in the renormalization group running has been considered . *",
    "_ lep searches for susy_. for the lep experiments , the strongest constraints come from the chargino mass and the invisible @xmath27 decay .",
    "we require @xmath51 and the non - sm invisible decay width of @xmath52 to be smaller than 1.71 mev , which is consistent with the precision electroweak measurement result @xmath53 mev at @xmath54 confidence level @xcite . * _ higgs data_. firstly , we consider the exclusion limits of the lep , tevatron and lhc in higgs searches with the package @xcite .",
    "this package also takes into account the results of the lhc searches for non - sm higgs bosons , such as @xmath55 and @xmath56 @xcite . secondly ,",
    "noticing that a light @xmath14 ( or @xmath16 ) may induce the distinguished signal @xmath57 , we consider the limitation of the @xmath58 signal on the parameter space using the latest cms results @xcite .",
    "finally , since a large invisible branching ratio of the higgs may be predicted in the light dm case , we perform a global fit of the higgs data using the package @xcite , where the systematics and correlations for the signal rate predictions , luminosity and higgs mass predictions are taken into account . in our fit , we further consider the latest lhc results of higgs invisible decay from the channel @xmath25 @xcite .",
    "we require our samples to be consistent with the higgs data at @xmath48 level , which corresponds to @xmath59 with @xmath41 obtained with the and @xmath60 denoting the minimum value of @xmath41 for the surviving samples in our scan .",
    "* _ lhc searches for susy_. based on the 20 fb@xmath61 data collected at the 8 tev run , the atlas and cms collaborations performed a search for the @xmath62 production with @xmath23 +  /@xmath24",
    "signal in a simplified model , where both @xmath63 and @xmath64 are assumed to be wino - like with @xmath65 , and a 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit on @xmath66 was obtained on the @xmath67 plane @xcite .",
    "+ in this work , in order to implement this constraint we perform an analysis similar to @xcite with the code checkmate @xcite for each sample surviving the constraints ( i ) - ( vii ) .",
    "we consider the contributions from all @xmath68 ( @xmath69 and @xmath70 ) associated production processes to the signal , and calculate the production rates and the branching ratios with the code prospino2 @xcite and nmsdecay @xcite , respectively .",
    "our analysis indicates that this constraint can exclude effectively those samples with small values of @xmath32 below 115 gev , and also some samples with moderate @xmath32 in the range from 115 gev to 200 gev .",
    "nevertheless , compared to the results without considering this constraint , our conclusions do not change much such as the upper bounds on @xmath71 presented below .    in order to study the implication of the dm direct detection experiments on the nmssm",
    ", we also calculate the dm spin - independent elastic scattering cross section off nucleon with the formulae used in our previous work @xcite . in getting the cross section",
    ", we set the parameter of the strange quark content in the nucleon as @xmath72 .",
    "in the rest of this work , we categorize the dm by its component , i.e. either bino - like or singlino - like , in presenting our results .",
    "since the interactions of the neutralinos with the higgs bosons come from the following lagrangian @xmath73 where the fields @xmath74 , @xmath75 and @xmath76 denote the neutral scalar parts of the higgs superfields @xmath2 , @xmath77 and @xmath78 , respectively , one can infer that if the dm is bino - like , the coupling strength of the @xmath79 interaction is mainly determined by the higgsino - component in @xmath80 , or more basically by the value of @xmath32 . to be more specific ,",
    "if @xmath81 is sm - like , the coupling strength is mainly determined by the first two terms in the second row of eq.[interaction ] , while if @xmath81 is singlet - dominated , the coupling of @xmath79 is mainly determined by the first term of eq.[interaction ] . however ,",
    "if the dm is singlino - like , the coupling strength is fundamentally determined by the parameters @xmath37 and @xmath38 and a low @xmath32 value may be helpful to enhance the coupling .    in this work , we are also interested in the couplings of the sm - like higgs to light singlet - like scalars @xmath14 and @xmath16 .",
    "these couplings are mainly determined by the following terms in the higgs potential @xcite @xmath82 this equation indicates that , if @xmath37 and @xmath38 approach zero , the couplings @xmath83 can not be very large ; while if both of them have a moderate value , accidental cancelation is very essential to suppress the couplings .",
    "in fig.[fig1 ] we project the samples surviving the above constraints on the plane of neutralino dark matter mass versus spin - independent neutralino - nucleon scattering cross section . about this figure , we want to emphasize two points .",
    "the first one is that some of the experimental constraints , such as the dm relic density and the higgs data , play an important role in limiting the parameter space of the nmssm .",
    "so in the following , we pay special attention to investigate how the samples in fig.[fig1 ] survive these constraints .",
    "the other one is that the various experimental constraints will cut into the parameter space and the interplay among them is very complicated . as a result , the sample distributions on the @xmath84 plane might be very wired .",
    "the strategy of analyzing this figure is to get a general picture of the current status of light dm confronting the direct detection results and then focus on some interesting regions . as we will discuss later",
    ", we will mainly focus on those samples that either can explain the cdms - ii results or can survive the first lux exclusion .",
    "we will not consider the up - right region ( @xmath85 ) in fig.[fig1 ] since it is not experimentally hinted .",
    "after carefully analyzing our results , we have the following observations from fig.[fig1 ] :    1 .   in the nmssm ,",
    "dm as light as @xmath86 is still allowed by the current higgs data .",
    "both the bino and singlino - like dm are capable of explaining the results of cdms - ii and cogent , or surviving the current lux results and future lux exclusion limits .",
    "2 .   as pointed out in @xcite , light dm in the nmssm may annihilate in the early universe through @xmath74-channel resonance effect of some mediators or into light higgs scalar pair to get a correct relic density .",
    "we checked that , for @xmath87 , singlino - like dm annihilated in the early universe mainly through the @xmath74-channel resonance effect of @xmath88 for the most case ; while bino - like dm might annihilate either through the resonance effect or into @xmath14 ( @xmath16 ) pair .",
    "we will discuss this issue in more detail later .",
    "+ in fact , the long thick band of grey samples ( for bino - like dm ) around @xmath89 exactly corresponds to the resonance case , and samples along this band are characterized by @xmath90 with @xmath91 denoting the mediator mass . for @xmath92 and @xmath93 ,",
    "the mediator is @xmath27 boson and the sm - like higgs boson , respectively , while in other cases the mediator is either @xmath14 or @xmath16 .",
    "these conclusions can also apply to the singlino - like dm ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "3 .   for samples with @xmath94 ,",
    "generally @xmath14 needs to be lighter than about @xmath95 to push up the scattering rate . for the bino - like dm with mass varying from @xmath96 to @xmath97 ,",
    "such a light @xmath14 is difficult to obtain after considering the constraint from the relic density ( see fig.[fig2 ] ) .",
    "while in the @xmath27 ( @xmath17 ) resonance region , the relic density has rather weak limitation on @xmath14 properties . in this case , @xmath14 may be as light as several gev so that the scattering rate is rather large , or the coupling @xmath98 may be greatly reduced to result in a relatively small @xmath99 .",
    "4 .   for bino - like dm ,",
    "generally it is not easy to obtain samples with @xmath100 .",
    "this is because the @xmath101 interaction is still sizable even after considering the various constraints ( see discussions on fig.[fig3 ] ) , and in this case , the @xmath17-mediated contribution to the dm - nucleon scattering is important .",
    "however , in the extreme case when the bino - like dm is close to about @xmath102 , due to the lower bound of @xmath32 , the higgsino component in the dm will get further reduced and result in an even smaller @xmath103 .",
    "5 .   when focusing on the xenon and lux experiments , the bino - like and singlino - like dm exhibit quite different behaviors .",
    "the first lux-300 kg result can exclude a large part of the allowed parameter space , but still leaves both the bino - like and singlino - like light dm viable .",
    "the future xenon-1 t and lux-7.2ton results can cut further deeply into the parameter space .",
    "especially , they limit tightly the bino - like dm case and constrain most of the bino - like dm mass to be lower than about 17 gev and 12 gev , respectively , while the singlino - like dm can still survive leisurely .",
    "6 .   for bino - like dm samples",
    "there is a gap in the right half part of the cdms - ii @xmath48 region .",
    "this is due to the tension between the lhc higgs data and the constraint from @xmath104 . as discussed in @xcite ( and see table i ) , the cdms - ii favored samples in bino - like dm scenario usually require a moderate @xmath37 along with a moderate @xmath38 to achieve the accidental cancelation in @xmath105 so that the sm - like higgs decay to @xmath14 or @xmath16 pair is suppressed . while on the other hand , this may increase the effective coupling of @xmath14 to down - type fermions which is proportional to @xmath106 with @xmath107 $ ] @xcite , and receive constraint from the measurement of @xmath104 .",
    "we checked that most of the excluded bino - like dm samples in the gap have a relatively large @xmath37 , while the singlino - like dm samples usually correspond to a small @xmath37 ( see following discussion on table i ) and thus receive less constraint .",
    "compared to bino - like dm which is restricted in certain areas on the @xmath84 plane , singlino - like dm can spread nearly to the whole region of the plane .",
    "this reflects the fact that singlino - like dm is more adaptable in light dm physics .",
    ".the ranges of relevant nmssm input parameters corresponding to part of the samples in fig.1 , which predict a dm lighter than 35 gev and meanwhile can explain the cdms - ii at 2@xmath47 level or survive the lux-300 kg exclusion limit .",
    "parameters with the mass dimension are in the unit of gev .",
    "[ cols=\"^ , < , < , < , < \" , ]     in the following , we concentrate on the samples in fig.1 that can either explain the cdms - ii experiment at @xmath48 level or survive the lux-300 kg exclusion limit",
    ". since the results of the cdms - ii and lux experiments are so incompatible , it would be interesting to investigate the difference of these two types of samples .",
    "to simply our analysis , we mainly consider the samples predicting a dm lighter than about 35 gev .",
    "these samples are not easy to obtain with traditional random scan method when exploring the susy parameter space due to its rather specific particle spectrum , but as we will see below , the underlying physics of these samples are clear and easy to understood . in table",
    "[ table1 ] , we list the ranges of relevant nmssm input parameters corresponding to these samples , which are classified by the component of the dm ( i.e. bino - like or singlino - like ) and meanwhile by its scattering cross section off the nucleon ( i.e. can explain the cdms - ii results at @xmath48 level or survive the lux-300 kg exclusion limit ) .    from table",
    "i , one can learn the following facts :    * the survived parameter ranges for lux - safe samples are generally wider than those of cdms - ii preferred samples .",
    "this is totally expectable from the experimental data of lux and cdms - ii . on the @xmath84 plane , cdms - ii @xmath48 region",
    "is constrained in a relatively narrow range @xmath108 and @xmath109 . to survive the first lux exclusion",
    ", however , a properly large @xmath110 for a certain @xmath111 will be enough .",
    "@xmath111 can cover the whole range @xmath112 and @xmath99 can vary from @xmath113 to @xmath114 .",
    "therefore , compared to cdms - ii region , there will be more freedom for the parameter space to satisfy the lux exclusion . * to obtain a dm lighter than 35 gev , one needs to have @xmath115 for the bino - like dm and @xmath116 for the singlino - like dm .",
    "this can be easily understood from the neutralino mass matrix @xcite .",
    "@xmath117 where @xmath118 and @xmath119 are gauge couplings , and @xmath120 and @xmath121 are higgs vacuum expectation values .",
    "in fact , a simple estimation can be made for singlino - like dm mass .",
    "table [ table1 ] shows that @xmath122 is usually at least one order smaller than @xmath37 .",
    "assuming @xmath123 and @xmath124 , we will have @xmath125 .",
    "* the cdms - ii samples usually have @xmath126 for both bino - like and singlino - like dm .",
    "the underlying reason is that a small value of @xmath32 and consequently a sufficient amount of higgsino component in the dm is helpful to increase the coupling strength of the dm with the light higgs bosons .",
    "this will in return push up the rate of the dm - nucleon scattering which is required by the cdms - ii results . *",
    "more interestingly , we find that for samples in the whole range of @xmath127 , the value of @xmath32 is upper bounded by about @xmath128 and @xmath129 for bino - like and singlino - like dm , respectively .",
    "two reasons can account for this .",
    "the first one is that in our scan , we required the nmssm to explain the muon anomalous magnetic moment .",
    "the parameter @xmath32 influences the contribution of the nmssm to the moment through chargino and neutralino mass , and a large value of @xmath32 will reduce the contribution significantly .",
    "another important reason is that , as mentioned above and also discussed below , in order to get a correct dm relic density , a light @xmath14 or @xmath16 must be present .",
    "noting that @xmath32 enters explicitly the squared mass of the singlet scalar @xcite , one can infer that too large values of @xmath32 can not be favored to get the desired light scalar masses .",
    "+ we also want to emphasize that , for the bino - like dm , an upper bound of @xmath32 will result in a lower limit of the higgsino component in the dm and thus a lower bound of the invisible branching ratio for @xmath130 .",
    "this can be explicitly seen in the left panel of fig.[fig3 ] below . * for singlino - like dm case , both @xmath37 and @xmath38 are small and especially , @xmath122 is very close to 0 .",
    "as indicated by eqs.([interaction],[higgs_potential],[neutralino_mass_matrix ] ) , the couplings of sm - like higgs boson to dm and also to the light higgs scalars @xmath131 will usually be suppressed .",
    "this can result in a @xmath99 as low as @xmath132 ( see fig.[fig1 ] ) and also a relatively small rate for the decays @xmath133 ( see fig.[fig3 ] and fig.[fig4 ] ) . while for the bino - like dm case with a moderate value of @xmath37 and @xmath38 , accidental cancelation is very essential to suppress the couplings of @xmath17 to @xmath134 and obtain an allowed higgs signal .    as discussed in fig.[fig1 ] , given @xmath135 , at least one light scalar is needed to accelerate the annihilation . in order to illustrate this feature , in fig.[fig2 ] we project the @xmath135 samples of fig.1 which can explain the cdms - ii results at 2@xmath47 level or survive the lux-300 kg exclusion limits on the plane of dm mass versus @xmath136 .",
    "red codes represent samples suggested by the cdms - ii experiment and meanwhile satisfying @xmath137 , while cyan ( blue ) codes correspond to samples surviving the lux-300 kg exclusion limits and also satisfying @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) .",
    "note that due to the large scattering cross section favored by the cdms - ii results , a light @xmath14 is needed ( as the t - channel propagator ) and the case @xmath139 is absent . from fig.[fig2 ] we have the following observations :     samples in fig.[fig1 ] which can explain the cdms - ii results at 2@xmath47 level or survive the lux-300 kg exclusion limits , projected on the plane of dm mass versus @xmath136 .",
    "red codes represent samples suggested by the cdms - ii experiment and meanwhile satisfying @xmath137 , while cyan(blue ) codes correspond to samples surviving the lux-300 kg exclusion limits and also satisfying @xmath137 ( @xmath138 ) .",

    "the straight line @xmath140 is very obvious , which corresponds to the s - channel resonance effect of @xmath14 or @xmath16 .",
    "however , in the singlino - like scenario with @xmath141 , there are some small regions where the line seems to be not continuous .",
    "in fact , this is not the case .",
    "we checked that there still exits a scalar ( either @xmath14 or @xmath16 ) with mass around @xmath142 .",
    "it is just that this scalar does not correspond to the lightest higgs boson .",
    "moreover , for the scalars shown in fig.[fig2 ] , we checked that they are highly singlet - dominated , which agree with previous study in @xcite .",
    "2 .   since @xmath14 contributes to the spin - independent dm - nucleon scattering as the t - channel propagator @xcite , a very light @xmath14 is needed to explain the cdms - ii result . for the bino - like dm ,",
    "the cdms - ii samples are mainly distributed in low @xmath143 region with @xmath110 upper bounded by about 4 gev , while for the singlino - like dm , the corresponding samples spread a larger region in @xmath144 plane .",
    "moreover , when focusing on the cdms - ii samples , we checked that if the dm is bino - like , the channel @xmath145 plays the dominant role in contributing to the dm annihilation , while if the dm is singlino - like , the s - channel resonance effect is the main contribution .",
    "since the constraint from the lux-300 kg data on the scattering rate is rather weak in the very light dm region , @xmath14 as light as 1 gev is still allowed for @xmath146 . with the increase of dm mass ,",
    "the constraint becomes much stronger and @xmath14 generally needs to be heavier than about 10 gev for @xmath147 in both scenarios .    , but projected on the plane of the invisible branching fractions of the sm - like higgs boson versus dm mass , and extended the dm mass to about 60 gev.,width=604 ]    for the sm - like higgs boson , since the decay channel @xmath148 is opened when @xmath149 , one can expect that the higgs data will impose rather tight constraints on this decay rate . in fig.[fig3 ] , we show the samples of fig.[fig2 ] on the plane of @xmath150 versus dm mass and extend the dm mass to about 60 gev .",
    "we have the following observations :    1 .",
    "the current higgs data still allow for an invisible decay branching ratio as large as @xmath0 at @xmath48 level .",
    "the tolerance of such a large invisible branching ratio is owe to the large uncertainties of the current data , especially the fact that atlas and cms data point to two opposite directions in the di - photon rate .",
    "obviously , an invisible decay branching ratio reaching @xmath0 may be easily tested at the 14 tev lhc with @xmath151 fb@xmath61 , where a 95% c.l .",
    "upper limit on the invisible decay , i.e. @xmath152 , can be imposed @xcite .",
    "2 .   in the bino - like dm scenario , due to the necessary higgsino component in the dm required by an efficient dm annihilation rate , the interaction between dm and @xmath17 can be relatively large . as a result , @xmath150 as large as @xmath0 is possible .",
    "note that for the cdms - ii samples , @xmath150 is always larger than about @xmath153 .",
    "the underlying reason is that , as we mentioned earlier , the channel @xmath145 plays an important role in contributing to the dm annihilation .",
    "this requires the strength of the @xmath154 interaction to be sufficiently large , and so is the @xmath155 interaction .",
