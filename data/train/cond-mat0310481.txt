    "a ferromagnetic particle goes into a monodomain state if its size @xmath10 is below a critical value @xmath11 nm .",
    "this is due to the competition between the exchange and dipolar energies .",
    "therefore , a nanoparticle in a monodomain state may be viewed as a giant magnetic dipole with magnetic moment of thousands of bohr magnetons . for an @xmath0 array of well - separated nanoparticles",
    "the exchange energy is usually negligible in comparison with the dipolar and anisotropy and zeeman energies .",
    "the study of such systems is of increasing importance because of their technological applications in data storage devices and magnetic field sensors .",
    "as the technology of these devices moves towards higher densities of stored information , it requires smaller particles of magnetic media @xcite , @xcite , for which finite size effects become relevant . in finite arrays of such large dipole moment particles , the dipolar field of the array becomes comparable with the bulk anisotropy field .",
    "dipolar effects in such systems affect the static and dynamics properties of the array ; and thus must be taken into account .",
    "recently , camley and stamps in @xcite , @xcite , @xcite investigated the dynamics and magnetization processes of a finite planar array of @xmath0 ferromagnetic nano dots , for @xmath12 .",
    "the nano - dots were taken to interact only via the dipole - dipole interaction , and they were subject to an external field applied either along one side of the array or along its diagonal .",
    "they found rather complicated hysteresis loops with the magnetization reversal controlled by the shape anisotropy induced by the array itself .",
    "we have considered the same model , and have extended their results , for @xmath13 .",
    "our results for @xmath14 qualitatively agree with those of @xcite .",
    "we find that the behavior of these systems is surprisingly complex , both for small and for larger values of @xmath6 , and we have studied the approach of these systems to @xmath15 behavior .    in the present work",
    "each dot is taken to have a radius @xmath16 , thickness @xmath17 and a single degree of freedom corresponding to the orientation of a magnet of saturation magnetization @xmath18 .",
    "we consider only the case of zero temperature .",
    "the dots are arranged on a square lattice with lattice spacing @xmath19 , and the dots interact only via the dipole - dipole interaction .",
    "the equation of motion for the magnetic moment of each dot is governed by the landau - lifshitz - gilbert equation ( llg ) , @xcite which reads @xmath20 where @xmath21 is the gyromagnetic ratio , @xmath22 is the damping coefficient , @xmath23 is the magnetic moment of the dot and @xmath24 is the saturation magnetization , @xmath25 is the average effective magnetic field acting on the dot .",
    "the average effective magnetic field acting on the @xmath26-th dot is due to the applied external field , the dipolar fields , and the anisotropy field @xmath27 here the dipole field acting on the @xmath26-th dot due to all other dots in the array is given by @xmath28    the choice of anisotropy field is determined by the shape of the dot , which in our problem is directed along the symmetry axis of the ( cylindrical ) dots .",
    "we divide both sides of eq.([llg ] ) by ( @xmath29 ) and define a dimensionless time variable @xmath30 .",
    "the llg in these reduced units becomes    @xmath31    where @xmath32 and @xmath33 .",
    "we employ a system of units where magnetic fields are given in units of @xmath34 and distances are given in units of the array s lattice spacing @xmath35 .",
    "the strength of the dipole field is characterized by @xmath36 , which is the ratio of the dot volume to the volume of a cubic cell with side @xmath35 .",
    "for all arrays studied in this work , we take @xmath37 .",
    "this article is organized as follows .",
    "section ii presents the numerical techniques and method of time integration .",
    "section iii presents an extensive discussion of magnetization processes and hysteresis for arrays of @xmath0 nano dots ( @xmath38 ) when the external field is applied along one side of the array .",
    "section iv considers the effects on the hysteresis loop of misalignment of the external field .",
    "section v considers the relationship between the area of the hysteresis loop and @xmath6 .",
    "a brief summary is given in section vi .",
    "we have employed two different approaches to study the magnetization processes of our @xmath0 arrays of nano - dots .",
    "the first approach uses the second rank runge - kutta ( rk ) algorithm with fixed time step to integrate the llg equation in reduced units .",
    "the second approach uses the  greedy algorithm  to find the stable final state of the array . in",
    "both approaches the calculations were done using fortran and mathematica languages @xcite .",
    "the two approaches yielded similar results .    in the rk approach ,",
    "the integration is done using a fixed time step @xmath39 and a damping coefficient @xmath40 , with an initial state in which the magnetic moment of the dot is randomly generated .",
    "the time integration proceeds until a stable final state is reached .",
    "the stability of the final state is checked by changes in the total energy of the system .",
    "iterations are stopped when the difference between the total energy of the system from the ( @xmath41)-th iteration and that of the @xmath42-th iteration is of the order of @xmath43 in units of @xmath44 .",
    "our solutions converged after almost @xmath45 iterations .",
    "the greedy algorithm approach assumes the dots to be aligned along the direction of their total local field . in the initial state",
    "each dot is chosen to point randomly .",
    "next , all components of the total local field are calculated for each dot .",
    "finally each component of the field is normalized by the magnitude of the total local field to yield the new dot magnetization orientation .",
    "the final state of the @xmath42-th iteration is used as an initial one for the next iteration until the solution is converged .",
    "the convergence of the final state is checked in manner similar to that used in the first approach .",
    "note that the greedy algorithm can be obtained from the llg equation in the limit where the damping coefficient is very large .",
    "we find that the llg approach converges faster than the greedy algorithm .",
    "this is probably related to a phenomenon known in rlc circuits , where a critically - damped circuit approaches equilibrium faster than a circuit with a larger amount of damping .",
    "calculation of the dipolar field at the @xmath26-th dot is the most computationally time - consuming aspect of both approaches since it requires summation of the dipole fields from all other dots in the array .",
    "however , due to the relatively small sizes of our dot arrays this calculation is performed rather quickly .",
    "hysteresis loops @xmath46 for @xmath0 arrays of nano dots subject to an external magnetic field applied along one side have been calculated .",
    "initially , a strong external field @xmath47 is applied to the array until saturation .",
    "then the field is decreased to @xmath48 , and then is increased again up to @xmath47 .",
    "we have taken @xmath49 , and a fixed field - step of @xmath50 is used to simulate the sweeping process .",
