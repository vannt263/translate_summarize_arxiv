    "many astrophysical phenomena that exhibit discontinuous solutions can be approximately described by the ideal magnetohydrodynamic ( mhd ) equations .",
    "various shock capturing numerical methods have been proposed to solve astrophysical mhd problems @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we introduce a semi - discrete finite volume scheme based on the computation of higher order local lax - friedrichs ( llf ) fluxes ( see for example @xcite ) at the grid cell interfaces .",
    "the llf flux is an approximation to the harten - lax - van leer ( hll ) flux @xcite as it only requires the maximum propagation speed of information at the discontinuity which exists at the grid cell interface .",

    "later an averaging is performed to obtain higher - order averaged llf fluxes at the grid cell interfaces @xcite .",
    "the cweno approach is the heart of the present scheme as it straightforwardly allows us to compute a higher - order point value of the conserved quantities at the center of each grid cell interface .    in this work , the constrained transport ( ct )",
    "method @xcite is used to evolve the magnetic field .",
    "this technique automatically maintains the solenoidality of the magnetic field up to the machine precision . in this approach the magnetic fields",
    "are usually discretized as face averages and electric fields as edge averages in the numerical grid cells .",
    "it is not straight forward to merge the ct technique into conservative hyperbolic equations due to different discretization of the physical variables .",
    "so far , several methods have been suggested on how to combine these two consistently @xcite . in this paper , we use a very simple 1d cweno reconstruction @xcite to compute higher order edge averaged electric field components from higher order llf electric fluxes .",
    "these edge averaged electric field components are used to evolve the magnetic field in the ct . at the end , a fourth order runge - kutta method @xcite is used to evolve the semi - discrete scheme in time .",
    "we have performed several multi - dimensional tests to confirm the fourth order accuracy and the divergence free property ( @xmath0 ) of our scheme .",
    "the manuscript is organized as follows .",
    "section ii introduces the ideal mhd equations , the finite volume semi - discrete scheme for conservation laws , computation of averaged fluxes at the grid cell interfaces and the ct technique .",
    "section iii has been devoted to the 1d fourth order cweno reconstruction of all the physical quantities . in section iv , we present the convergence of errors for 1d , 2d and 3d alfven wave tests at large amplitude to show fourth order accuracy in the nonlinear regime",

    "moreover , the 1d shock tube , the orszag - tang vortex , the 2d blast wave and 2d rotor problems are solved to demonstrate the shock capturing nature and divergence free property of the scheme .",
    "section v contains a brief summary of the work presented in this manuscript .",

    "is computed from the ideal gas equation of state ,    @xmath12.\\ ] ]    where @xmath13 is the ratio of specific heats .",
    "the set of eqs.- in compact form can be written as , @xmath14    where ,    @xmath15    @xmath16    all the symbols have their usual meanings .",
    "since density , energy and momentum components are discretized as volume averages , eqs.- are solved by a semi - discrete method ( see for example @xcite ) as follows :    @xmath17    here @xmath18 is the volume average which is defined as ,    @xmath19    the function @xmath20 is the higher order centrally weighted essentially non - oscillatory polynomial .",
    "the functions @xmath21 , @xmath22 and @xmath23 are the higher order averaged local lax - friedrichs ( llf ) fluxes along @xmath24- , @xmath25-and @xmath26-directions respectively .",
    "this subsection is devoted to the computation of the fluxes along the @xmath24-direction as an example , the generalization to other directions is straightforward .",
    "we first reconstruct the 1d cweno polynomial along the @xmath24-direction from the given volume averages . later this polynomial is used to compute the non - oscillatory point values centered at the cell interfaces along the @xmath24-direction .",
    "these reconstructed point values carry an area average information in the @xmath27-plane . considering them as cell averages ,",
    "the 1d reconstruction is performed along the @xmath25-direction to obtain a point value in the cell center which still has an average information along the @xmath26-direction . again considering the reconstructed values as cell averages we perform the same 1d reconstruction along the @xmath26-direction to get the point value in the cell center .",
    "this is how we obtain the point values of the conserved quantities at the center of the grid cell interfaces along the @xmath24-direction .",
    "we can then compute corresponding point value fluxes @xmath28 and hence point value local lax - friedrichs ( llf ) fluxes @xmath29 as follows :    @xmath30    the quantities @xmath31 and @xmath32 denote right and left reconstructed point values of the conserved quantities at the center of the grid cell interfaces .",
    "these point values are obtained by 1d cweno reconstruction reconstruction @xcite following dimension by dimension approach .",
    "the quantities @xmath33 , @xmath34 are corresponding point value fluxes of the conserved quantities at ( @xmath35 ) . here",
    "@xmath36 is the local maximum speeds of propagation which is estimated as ,    @xmath37    where @xmath38 is the fast magneto - sonic speed ,    @xmath39^{1/2}.\\ ] ]    here @xmath40 is the sound speed and @xmath41 is the alfven speed @xcite .",
    "after we have computed the higher order point value llf fluxes @xmath29 , the higher order averaged llf fluxes @xmath21 can be easily computed using simple averaging along the @xmath25 and @xmath26-directions @xcite as ,    @xmath42    the method , described above , requires all physical quantities to be volume averages . however , magnetic field components @xmath43 , @xmath44 and @xmath45 are discretized as area averages on the @xmath27 , @xmath46 and @xmath47-planes respectively .",
    "we therefore compute volume averaged magnetic field components ( @xmath48 , @xmath49 , @xmath50 ) from their area averages ( @xmath51 , @xmath52 , @xmath53 ) as follows ,    1 .",
    "lagrange interpolation is used to obtain a fourth order accurate area average value at the center of the cell .",
    "it is to be noted that interpolation is only allowed along the direction where the field remains smooth and the direction is determined by the solenoidality property of the magnetic field @xcite .",
    "now since each grid cell has three face average values , one at the center and other two on the opposite faces , we are able to apply simpson s @xmath54 rule to compute a fourth order accurate volume average .",
    "thus , fourth order accurate volume average approximations for the magnetic field components are expressed as ,    @xmath55 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath56 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    @xmath57 .",
    "\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    for the computation of fluxes along the @xmath24-direction , @xmath49 and @xmath50 are being treated like other volume averaged variables ( density , momentum etc . ) .",
    "however , @xmath24-component of the magnetic field is special as it does not require any reconstruction along the @xmath24-direction , but it does require the reconstructions along the @xmath25 and @xmath26-directions as it also has an average information in the @xmath27-plane",
    ".    computation of averaged fluxes in other directions is trivial due to the dimension by dimension approach .",
    "since magnetic fields are discretized as area averages , one may , therefore , introduce finite volume discretization on eq . after applying stoke s theorem as follows @xcite :    @xmath58    @xmath59    @xmath60    the variables @xmath61 , @xmath62 , @xmath63 are the area averaged magnetic field components and @xmath64 , @xmath65 , @xmath66 are the edge averaged approximations of the electric field components .    from eqs.-",
    ", one may easily show that @xmath67 if the differentiation is carried out by using central differences along the cell edges .",
    "thus , the evolved magnetic field remains solenoidal if so initially .",
    "the edge averaged electric field components are obtained from the higher order llf electric fluxes .",
    "these fluxes exist because eq .",
    "can also be written in divergence form as follows ,    @xmath68    thus llf electric flux vector along the @xmath24-direction reads as ,    @xmath69 -    \\frac{a^x_{i+1/2,j , k}}{2 } \\left [ \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } b_x \\\\ b_y\\\\ b_z \\end{array}\\right)_{i+1,j , k}^{w } -    \\left ( \\begin{array}{c } b_x \\\\",
    "b_y\\\\ b_z \\end{array}\\right)_{i , j , k}^{e } \\right].\\end{aligned}\\ ] ]    note here that the @xmath24-component of the electric flux @xmath70 is zero because @xmath71 is equal to @xmath72 .",
    "the vectors @xmath73 , @xmath74 are the left and right reconstructed point values which can be computed by using the definition of the electric field    @xmath75    and @xmath36 is already defined in eq ..",
    "once we have computed point value llf electric fluxes along the @xmath24-direction , we apply the same averaging formula as in eq . to obtain the face ( area ) averaged llf electric fluxes as follows ,    @xmath76    now , since all the components of the electric fluxes @xmath77 carry an average information along the @xmath25 and @xmath26-directions , 1d reconstruction along any of those directions will return an edge average value along the other direction .",
    "thus , considering @xmath78 as cell average , if we reconstruct the point value at the cell edges along the @xmath25-direction , we get a contribution to the edge averaged electric field along the @xmath26-direction @xmath79 . similarly ,",
    "reconstruction of @xmath80 at the cell edges along the @xmath26-direction contributes to the edge averaged electric field along the @xmath25-direction @xmath81 .",
    "similarly , one can compute averaged llf electric fluxes along @xmath25 and @xmath26-directions and there contributions to the edge averaged electric field components . at the end",
    "we take a mean of all the contributions to compute fourth order edge averaged electric field components .",
    "finally , eqs . and -",
    "are evolved in time using a fourth order runge - kutta method @xcite , once the l.h.s . of these equations",
    "are computed .",
    "the spatial accuracy of this scheme is now completely determined by the order of spatial reconstruction of the physical quantities .",
    "we use 1d fourth order cweno reconstruction @xcite for the same .    although , the fourth order cweno reconstruction for 1d hyperbolic problems is well described by levy et al .",
    "@xcite , we provide it here for the sake of completeness .",
    "in each cell @xmath82 , one has to reconstruct a quadratic polynomial @xmath83 which is a convex combination of three quadratic polynomials @xmath84 , @xmath85 and @xmath86 such that ,    @xmath87    @xmath83 is reconstructed so as to satisfy all the three constraints accuracy , conservation and non - oscillatory .",
    "the coefficients of the polynomial @xmath88 are obtained uniquely by requiring it to conserve the cell averages @xmath89 , @xmath90 and @xmath91 , where @xmath92 .",
    "thus , each polynomial , @xmath88 , can be written as ,    @xmath93    the nonlinear weights @xmath94 are obtained as before , _ i.e. _",
    "@xmath95    here @xmath96 , @xmath11 are chosen to be @xmath97 and @xmath98 respectively and @xmath99 , @xmath100 @xcite .",
    "@xmath101 are the smoothness indicators which are defined as ,    @xmath102    once we have reconstructed all the the polynomials ( @xmath103 , @xmath104 , @xmath105 ) , smoothness indicators can easily be computed using eq . and hence nonlinear weights using eq .. these weights are finally used to reconstruct non - oscillatory the polynomial @xmath83 which provides fourth order accurate point values at the cell interfaces in smooth regions .",
    "the fourth order accuracy of the proposed method has been verified by computing the convergence of errors in 1d , 2d and 3d circularly polarized alfven wave ( cpaw ) tests at large amplitude ( @xmath106 ) so as to retain the nonlinear behavior .",
    "we further confirm the fourth order accuracy in another 2d test  orszag - tang vortex problem when the solution is still smooth but highly nonlinear .    in order to show the shock capturing behavior of the method we present the results for 1d brio - wu test , the evolution of the orszag - tang vortex problem , the 2d mhd blast wave and 2d rotor problem .",
    "the @xmath107 errors in all the test are at the round - off level and do not grow in time .      in this subsection",
