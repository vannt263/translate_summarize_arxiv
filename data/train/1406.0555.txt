    "preparing a ground state of a mechanical resonator is an important topic , and it has applications in testing fundamental quantum theory , exploring the boundary between classical and quantum regions , and studying precision metrology  @xcite . considering the inevitable interaction between the resonator and its surrounded heat bath , the state of the resonator is far away from the ground state in equilibrium , so cooling the mechanical resonator to the ground state becomes an urgent task .",
    "so far , many proposals have been put forward to cool the resonator . making use of the capacitive coupling ,",
    "lorentz force , magnetic field or strain field induced coupling with a two - level - system ( josephson qubit , or negatively charged nitrogen - vacancy center , etc . )",
    ", one can cool the mechanical resonator efficiently  @xcite .",
    "other proposals design an optomechanical system consisting of one cavity mode and the resonator to be cooled .",
    "the radiative pressure from photons is applied to cool the resonator  @xcite . for all of these proposals , we can finally obtain a resonator with very small phonon number in the long time limit .    in a realistic experimental optomechanical system ,",
    "the mechanical resonator is often made by silica .",
    "because of the amorphous nature of silicon , defects reside in the amorphous native oxide of the silicon surface  @xcite . as shown in ref .",
    "@xcite , due to the coupling between the defect with resonator and their couplings with heat baths , the thermal noise from the heat bath of the defects can be effectively transferred to the mechanical resonator .",
    "therefore , the normal cooling method used in the optomechanical system can actually hardly work .    in this paper",
    ", we show by employing the periodical @xmath0 pulses , we can efficiently remove the detrimental effect of defects and cool the resonator efficiently .",
    "the reason is that the periodical @xmath0 pulses can induce the sign of operators @xmath1 , @xmath2 to be flipped  @xcite .",
    "the interaction between defects and the surrounded heat bath can be eliminated up to the first order of time .",
    "we display the cooling performance of the resonator with different defects energy gaps and defects damping rates .",
    "we find that with a large number of @xmath0 pulses ( @xmath3 ) , the phonon occupation of the resonator reduces to a lower value , when compared with the case of no @xmath0 pulses .",
    "besides , we also study the difference of the cooling results through two different calculation approaches , one uses the master equation based on polariton doublets , the other is `` simple approach '' in which the defects and coupling are added into the master equation of the bare resonator directly  @xcite . in our discussion , we find that these two approaches give a similar qualitative picture in cooling , but the obtained value of phonon occupations are quantitative different .",

    "an optomechanical component consists of one cavity mode and the mechanical resonator , that is , @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the detuning of cavity driving frequency @xmath8 from the cavity mode frequency @xmath9 .",
    "the operators @xmath10 ( @xmath11 ) and @xmath12 ( @xmath13 ) stand for the annihilation ( creation ) operator of the cavity mode and mechanical resonator , respectively .    as discussed above , the defects couple to the mechanical resonator inevitably . here",
    ", we only consider the case of one defect , which can be regarded as a two - levle - system ( tls )  @xcite .",
    "the hamiltonian for the resonator and the defect can be written as a jaynes - cummings ( jc ) form  @xcite , @xmath14 where @xmath15 is the frequency of a tls ( mechanical resonator ) , and @xmath16 is the coupling strength .    in our discussion below , we take the interactions between each of these three systems with their surrounding heat bath into account .",
    "the interaction hamiltonian takes the form as ,    @xmath17    here , @xmath18 , @xmath19 , and @xmath20 are the coupling strength between the cavity mode , the mechanical resonator , the defects and each one s heat bath .",
