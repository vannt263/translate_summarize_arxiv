    "in a recent paper @xcite the conjecture was made that not one , but two pomerons could coexist .",
    "this proposal is based on a description of data for the proton singlet structure function @xmath2 in a wide range of @xmath3 and all available @xmath1 values ( including also the charm structure function and elastic photoproduction of @xmath4 on the proton ) .",
    "the singlet structure function reads@xmath5 corresponding @xcite to the sum of three contributions , namely a `` hard '' pomeron contribution with a fitted intercept @xmath6 a `` soft '' pomeron exchange , as seen in soft hadronic cross - sections with a fixed intercept @xmath7 and a secondary reggeon singularity necessary to describe the larger @xmath8 region with intercept fixed at @xmath9 the `` hard '' pomeron is in particular needed to describe the strong rise of @xmath10 at small @xmath8 observed at hera @xcite .",
    "the key observation of ref.[1 ] is that the agreement with data can be obtained by assuming an opposite @xmath1-behaviour for the two pomeron contributions in formula ( 1 ) . indeed , for @xmath11 @xmath12 is increasing and @xmath13 decreasing ( the precise parametrizations @xcite are given in a regge theory framework ) .",
    "this picture is suggestive of a situation where the `` soft '' and `` hard '' pomerons are not one and the same object but two separate regge singularities with rather different intercept and @xmath14 behaviour .",
    "the `` hard '' pomeron may be expected to be governed by perturbative qcd evolution equations .",
    "indeed , at small @xmath15 a regge singularity is expected to occur as a solution of the bfkl equation @xcite corresponding to the resummation of the leading @xmath16 terms in the qcd perturbative expansion , where @xmath17 is the ( small ) value of the coupling constant of qcd .",
    "the intercept value is predicted to be @xmath18 it is interesting to note that the phenomenological fit for the hard pomeron in ref.@xcite corresponds to a reasonable value for @xmath19 the goal of the present paper is to show that the global conformal invariance of the bfkl equation @xcite leads to a natural mechanism generating both the `` hard '' and `` soft '' pomeron singularities .",
    "the plan of the paper is as follows : in section * 2 * , using the bfkl equation and the set of its conformal - invariant components , we exhibit the phenomenon generating sliding singularities . in section * 3 * , we explicitly describe the two - pomeron configuration obtained from the `` sliding '' mechanism . in section * 4 * we confront the resulting effective singularities with the parametrization of @xcite and discuss some expectations from non - perturbative corrections at small @xmath20 finally , in section * 5 * , we discuss some phenomenological and theoretical implications of our qcd two - pomeron mechanism .",
    "let us start with the solution of the bfkl equation expressed in terms of an expansion over the whole set of conformal spin components @xcite . for structure functions , one may write ( using the notation @xmath21 ) : @xmath22 with @xmath23 and @xmath24 being some scale characteristic of the target ( onium , proton , etc ... ) .",
    "@xmath25 is the bfkl kernel eigenvalue corresponding to the @xmath26 unitary representation @xcite labelled by the conformal spin @xmath27 it is to be noted that the @xmath28 component corresponds to the dominant `` hard '' bfkl pomeron .",
    "usually the @xmath29 components , required by conformal invariance since half - integer spin components exist but do note contribute to elastic cross - sections @xcite . ] but subleading by powers of the energy , are omitted with respect to the leading logs qcd resummation .",
    "they are commonly neglected in the phenomenological discussions .",
    "we shall see that they may play an important r^ ole , however .",
    "the couplings of the bfkl components to external sources are taken into account by the weights @xmath30 in formula ( 2 ) .",
    "little is known about these functions and we shall treat them as much as possible in a model independent way .",
    "for instance , they should obey some general constraints , such as a behaviour when @xmath31 ensuring the convergence of the integral in ( 2 ) .",
    "we will see that some extra analyticity constraints will appear in the context of the two pomeron problem .",
    "the key observation leading to the sliding phenomenon starts by considering the successive derivatives of the kernels @xmath32 one considers the following suitable form : @xmath33 as obvious from ( 4 ) , the symmetry @xmath34 leads to a maximum at @xmath35 for all @xmath36 and thus to a saddle - point of expression ( 2 ) at @xmath37 for ultra asymptotic values of @xmath38 the saddle - point approximation gives @xmath39 the @xmath40-dependent factor corresponds to a common anomalous dimension @xmath41 for all @xmath27 note that the known @xmath40-dependent `` @xmath42-diffusion '' factor is absent in this ultra - asymptotic limit .",
    "the series of functions of @xmath43 is such that only the first term has intercept @xmath44 larger than @xmath45 indeed , @xmath46 this ultra asymptotic result is the reason why the conformal spin components with @xmath47 are generally neglected or implicitly taken into account by ordinary secondary regge singularities with intercept less than @xmath45 however , at large enough values of @xmath14 and even for very large @xmath48 a sliding phenomenon moves away the singularities corresponding to these conformal spin components , leading to a very different behaviour from ( 5 ) .",
    "indeed , the sliding mechanism is already known @xcite to generate the diffusion factor of the leading @xmath28 component .",
    "however it has an even more important effect on the higher spin components as we shall discuss now .",
    "the sliding mechanism is based on the fact that @xmath49 the second derivative of the kernels at the asymptotic saddle - point value , becomes in absolute value very small when @xmath50 in such a way that the real saddle - points governing the integrals of formula ( 2 ) are considerably displaced from @xmath51 indeed , considering the expansions ( 4 ) , one has : @xmath52 for the @xmath28 component , the corresponding integral in ( [ 2 ] ) can be evaluated by a saddle - point in the vicinity of @xmath53 and gives the diffusion factor @xmath54 considering the rapid decrease by a factor 20 of the modulus of the second derivative for @xmath55 it is easy to realize that , for components @xmath56 it is no more justified to evaluate the integrals in the vicinity of @xmath53 the real saddle - point being away from this value .",
    "we shall make the correct evaluation in the next section .",
    "let us consider the @xmath57 component of the summation ( 2 ) in the following way : for each value of @xmath58 we compute the _ effective intercept _ ( in units of @xmath59 ) @xmath60 displayed as a function of the _ effective anomalous dimension _ @xmath61",
    "our observation is that , for any weight @xmath62 in formula ( 2 ) , the resulting set of points accumulates near the curve @xmath63 this result is valid provided a saddle - point dominates the integral .    the proof comes as follows : if a saddle point @xmath64 dominates the integral ( 2 ) for @xmath65 the saddle - point equation @xmath66 ^{\\prime } = 0 \\label{8}\\ ] ] is verified and the resulting integral is approximated by @xmath67 ^{\\prime \\prime } \\right)\\right\\}^{\\frac 12}}\\ .",
    "\\label{9}\\ ] ] neglecting in ( 9 ) derivatives of the slowly varying saddle - point prefactor @xmath68 one may write @xmath69 where one uses the saddle - point equation ( 8) to eliminate the contributions due to the implicit dependence @xmath70 this proves our statement .",
    "interestingly enough , the property ( 10 ) is valid for any weight @xmath71 and thus can be used to characterize the generic behaviour of the expression ( 2 ) .",
    "the only condition is the validity of a saddle - point approximation which is realized whenever @xmath14 or @xmath43 is large enough .",
    "let us discuss some relevant example . in figs.1,2",
    "we have plotted the result of the numerical integration in expression ( 2 ) for @xmath72 choosing @xmath73 this weight is chosen in such a way that the convergence properties of the integrands are ensured and no extra singularity is generated for @xmath74 other weights with the same properties were checked to give the same results . for comparison",
    "we also display the functions @xmath75 and @xmath76 note that we have also included for the discussion the auxiliary branches of @xmath77 for the intervals @xmath78 and @xmath79    the results both for @xmath28 ( white circles ) and @xmath80 ( black circles ) are displayed in fig.1 for a fixed large value of total rapidity @xmath81 and various values of @xmath82 while in fig.2 they are shown for a fixed value of @xmath83 and various @xmath38 indeed , it is seen on these plots that the saddle - point property ( 10 ) is verified , even for the auxiliary branches . the observed small systematic shift of the numerical results w.r.t .",
    "the theoretical curves @xmath84 is well under control .",
    "it is related to the saddle - point prefactor in formula ( 9 ) .    by various verifications",
    ", we checked that the results shown in figs.1,2 are generic if the following three conditions are realized :    \\i ) @xmath43 or @xmath85 are to be large enough @xmath86 to allow for a saddle - point method .",
    "\\ii ) @xmath30 is constrained to ensure the convergence and positivity of the integrals of expression ( 2 ) in the complex plane .",
    "\\iii ) @xmath30 has no singularity for @xmath87    the striking feature of the results displayed in figs.1,2 is that , while remaining in vicinity of the curve @xmath88 @xmath89 and @xmath90 are shifted away from the ultra asymptotic saddle - point point at @xmath51 moreover , the shift is larger if the conformal spin @xmath91 is higher .",
    "let us make a particular comment on the analyticity constraint iii ) .",
    "obviously , the presence of a singularity at @xmath92 would prevent the existence of a shift .",
    "indeed , in fig.3 , we show the result for @xmath93 where we have explicitely violated the constraint iii ) by a pole at @xmath94 as a result , the components @xmath95 and @xmath96 remain still very close to their reference curves @xmath97 and @xmath98 but they appear `` sticked '' at the singularity point @xmath99 thus the relation ( 10 ) remains verified , but the sliding mechanism is `` frozen '' by the singularity , as expected from analyticity properties .",
    "the main consequence of the sliding mechanism is to substantially modify the evaluation of the sum ( 2 ) with respect to the ultra asymptotic expectation ( 5 ) .",
    "indeed the situation seen on figs.1,2 is general :  the first contribution @xmath100 is subject to a rather small shift from @xmath101 while the @xmath102 component @xmath95 remains at values where @xmath103 is slighly above 1 and @xmath104 is below @xmath105 the higher components @xmath106 and a fortiori @xmath107 lie in regions with negative effective intercept and lower and lower values of the effective anomalous dimension .",
    "it is instructive to compare the results of figs.1,2 for the @xmath102 component with those obtained for the auxiliary branches of the @xmath28 one .",
    "though being situated in the same range of effective anomalous dimension @xmath108 as the @xmath102 component , the first auxiliary branch gives sensibly lower ( and almost all negative ) values of the effective intercept in the considered kinematical range .",
    "thus , the corresponding contributions to the @xmath28 amplitude are subdominant in energy with respect to the spin 1 amplitude .",
    "the same property holds for the second auxiliary branch which stays subdominant with respect to the @xmath109 component which , in any case is itself subdominant with respect to @xmath102 .",
    "thus , the mechanism we suggest for the two - pomeron scenario is the following : the rle of the `` hard '' pomeron is played ( as it should be ) by the component @xmath110 while the rle of the `` soft '' pomeron is played by the other components , principally the component with unit conformal spin @xmath111 here this mechanism is realized in a range @xmath112 where perturbative qcd ( with resummation ) is valid .",
    "extrapolation to the non - perturbative domain will be discussed in the next section .",
    "it is now worth discussing our results , obtained from qcd and conformal symmetry , in the context of the phenomenological analysis of paper @xcite .",
    "our goal is not to identify the two approaches since the theoretical conformal spin expansion ( 2 ) is only valid in the perturbative qcd region at large @xmath43 and @xmath113 while the approach of paper @xcite takes into account data in the whole range of @xmath114 nevertheless it is interesting to confront our resulting effective parameters with those obtained from the description of paper @xcite .",
    "in fig.4 we show a plot comparing our results with those obtained from the two pomeron components of @xcite in terms of the effective parameters as previously . in the case of the parametrization of paper @xcite ,",
    "the effective intercept and anomalous dimension are easily identified as , respectively , @xmath115 and @xmath116 see expression ( 1 ) . in order to make contact with phenomenology ,",
    "we have fixed @xmath117 and @xmath118 this last value is somewhat arbitrary but corresponds to rather high values of @xmath119 in the physical range , justifying the existence of a significant saddle - point . in practice , in fig.4 ,",
    "we have considered @xmath81 and @xmath120 the crosses in fig.4 correspond to the effective parameters extracted from the parametrization @xcite and the black dots to our numerical results of the integrals ( 2 ) for the same values of the kinematical variables .",
    "we performed the calculation with @xmath121 but checked the validity of the results for other weights ( with similar analyticity properties , cf .",
    "section 3 . )",
    "the main thing to be noticed is the reasonable agreement between both results for large values of @xmath1 corresponding to the direction of the arrows on the figure .",
    "a few remarks are in order :    \\i ) the leading `` hard pomeron '' singularity obtained by our results is of the type used e.g. in the phenomenological description of proton structure functions in the dipole model of bfkl dynamics @xcite . however the value of the coupling constant , chosen here to match with the determination of the hard component by @xcite , is larger than in one - pomeron fits @xcite and in better agreement with the original bfkl framework .",
    "\\ii ) the nonleading singularity is obtained in the correct range fixed by @xcite to be given by the `` soft '' pomeron @xcite .",
    "it is to be remarked that , while the `` hard '' pomeron singularity is mainly fixed by the choice of @xmath122 the nonleading one is a result of the sliding mechanism .",
    "we thus find this feature to be model independent and related to the asymptotic conformal invariance of the input amplitudes .",
    "\\iii ) as also seen in the figure , the agreement is not quantitative , especially at lower @xmath123 since the results obtained from our formula ( 2 ) appear as _ moving _ effective singularities while those from paper @xcite are , by definition , _ fixed _ regge singularities .    let us comment further on this important difference",
    ". in perturbative qcd , submitted to obey a renormalization group property , one expects in rather general conditions a scale - dependent evolution , different from the regge - type of singularities , at least for the singlet channel @xcite .",
    "it is thus not surprising that the various components obtained from our approach show this characteristic feature , see figs.1 - 4 . on",
    "contrary , pure regge singularities will correspond to fixed intercepts as shown in fig.4 by the horizontal lines .",
    "we feel that moving effective singularities will remain a typical feature of the `` hard '' singularity at high @xmath14 , at least if perturbative qcd is relevant in this case .",
    "the situation is obviously different for the `` soft '' singularity which intercept is fixed at the known `` universal '' value for soft interactions @xcite .",
    "the behaviour of the `` soft '' singularity when @xmath1 becomes small is not determined in our perturbative approach .",
    "it only predicts that it will become dominant when @xmath14 will approach and decrease below @xmath124 as indicated by the effective anomalous dimension .",
    "non - perturbative qcd effects could thus be expected to stabilize the perturbative soft singularity at the known location of the phenomenological soft pomeron at a suitable position , but it would not be easily justified by a physical property like e.g. conformal invariance . ] .",
    "moreover , one would have to consider also the other higher conformal spin components .",
    "some qualitative arguments can be added in favour of specific non perturbative effects for conformal spin components .",
    "indeed , the same reason leading to the sliding mechanism , namely the smallness of @xmath125 in the vicinity of @xmath101 implies a large `` @xmath126-diffusion '' phenomenon @xcite .",
    "one typically expects a range of `` @xmath126-diffusion '' for the gluon virtuality scales building the spin component @xmath57 depending on @xmath91 as @xmath127 thus , while the contamination of non - perturbative unitarization effects could be limited for @xmath128 it is expected to be strong for @xmath129 and the higher spin components @xmath130 all in all , it is a consistent picture that the softer components obtained in a perturbative qcd framework at high @xmath14 are precisely those for which stronger `` @xmath126-diffusion '' corrections are expected . to go",
    "further would require a study of the low-@xmath1 region , in particular of higher - twist contributions , which are outside the scope of our present paper .",
    "@xcite seems to show a different behaviour from the one obtained from the sliding mechanism of higher conformal spin components .",
    "this feature certainly deserves further study . ]    concerning the physical meaning of the analyticity constraints imposed on the integrand factors @xmath131 they amount to discuss the conformal coupling of the bfkl components to , say , the virtual photon and the proton ( or , more generally other projectiles / targets ) .",
    "leaving for future work the complete derivation of the conformal couplings to different conformal spins @xcite , let us assume that the coupling is spin independent .",
    "interestingly enough an eikonal coupling to a @xmath132 pair @xcite then appears to be forbidden , since it has a pole at @xmath133 corresponding to the presence of the gluon coupling in the impact factor @xcite .",
    "however , considering the direct coupling through the probability distribution of a virtual photon in terms of @xmath132 pair configurations @xcite , we remark , following the derivation of @xcite , that the pole due to the gluon coupling is cancelled with no other singularity at @xmath134 we explicitely checked that we obtain very similar results to those displayed in figs.13 within this framework .",
    "note that such a model ensures the positivity of the conformal spin contributions .    in our derivation , which follows from the conformal invariance of the bfkl equation",
    ", we have sticked to the case of a fixed coupling constant .",
    "it has been proposed @xcite that the solution of the bfkl equation , once modified in order to take into account a running coupling constant , leads to two , or more probably , a series of regge poles instead of the @xmath135-plane cut obtained originally at fixed @xmath136 however , this solution with more than one pomeron singularity does not ensure the specific @xmath14 behaviour required by the analysis of @xcite and obtained by the sliding mechanism .",
    "the running of the coupling constant , and more generally the results of the next - leading bfkl corrections @xcite , modify the singularity structure could preserve the sliding mechanism .",
    "further study is needed in this respect .",
    "to summarize our results , using the full content of solutions of the bfkl equation in a perturbative qcd framework , and in particular their conformal invariance , we have looked for the physical consequences of the higher conformal spin components of the conformal expansion on the problem of the pomeron singularites .",
    "we have found , under rather general conditions , that the obtained pattern of effective singularities leads to two pomeron contributions , one `` hard '' , corresponding to the ordinary conformal spin 0 component and one `` soft '' , corresponding to higher spin contributions , mainly spin 1 .",
    "this situation meets , at least in the large @xmath1 domain , the empirical observation of ref.@xcite leading to a `` hard '' pomeron with leading - twist behaviour and a `` soft '' pomeron with higher - twist behaviour .",
    "it is interesting to note that the higher - twist behaviour we obtain corresponding to the @xmath102 component is of higher effective intercept than the one which may be associated with the auxiliary branches of the `` hard '' component @xmath137 thus , there is no doubt that the @xmath102 component behaviour is emerging from the other secondary bfkl contributions .",
    "however , its order of magnitude remains to be discussed @xcite .",
    "it is important to note that the higher spin components rely on the existence of an asymptotic global conformal invariance .",
    "this invariance has been proved to exist in the leading - log approximation . in the next - leading log bfkl calculations",
    ", it has been recently advocated @xcite to be preserved , at least approximately . if this result is confirmed , and if the characteristics of the kernels are similar , the rle of the modified higher conformal spin components is expected to be the same .",
    "further tests of our conjecture also imply a study of the specific couplings of the higher spin components to the initial states and an extension of the predictions to the non - forward diffractive scattering .",
    "indeed , it has been recently shown @xcite that the photoproduction of @xmath138 gives evidence for no shrinkage of the pomeron trajectory .",
    "thus the two - pomeron conjecture could also be borne out by considering non - forward processes .",
    "one interesting conclusion to be drawn from our study is that the matching of hard and soft singularities could be very different from expectation .",
    "usually , it is expected that a smooth evolution is obtained from the hard to the soft region thanks to the increase of the unitarity corrections to some `` bare '' pomeron . by contrast , in the empirical approach of @xcite and in the theoretical sliding mechanism discussed in the present paper , the `` hard '' and `` soft '' regions are essentially dominated by distinct singularities , with only small overlap . clearly , this alternative deserves further phenomenological and theoretical studies .",
    "in particular , it has been suggested @xcite to extend the study to ( virtual ) photon - photon reactions where the perturbative singularities and their specific coupling are expected to be theoretically well - defined .",
    "for instance , if the eikonal coupling is confirmed as a characteristic feature of the ( virtual ) photon coupling to the bfkl kernel , the sliding mechanism should not work for the spin 1 component and thus the would - be `` soft '' pomeron is expected to be absent from these reactions .",
    "another case study is the pomeron in hard diffractive reactions where the sliding mechanism , if present , could be different than for total structure functions , and thus leading to a different balance of hard and soft singularities .",
    "we want to thank the participants of the zeuthen workshop on dis at small @xmath15 ( `` royon meeting '' , june 1998 ) for fruitful discussions , among whom jeff forshaw , douglas ross for stimulating remarks and particularly peter landshoff for provoking us with his and donnachie s conjecture .",
