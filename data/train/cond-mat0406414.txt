    "at present , kinetic monte carlo ( kmc ) simulation is virtually the only computational method that enables numerical study of the dynamics of physical and chemical systems on macroscopically relevant timescales , anywhere from microseconds to millions of years @xcite .",
    "however , the method is essentially a stochastic approximation to underlying classical or quantum mechanical processes on finer space and time scales  @xcite .",
    "it thus suffers from the problem that the basic mc timescale is often difficult to relate to an underlying physical timescale .",
    "while such a timescale could , in principle , be calculated from comparison with calculations at these finer scales  @xcite , this is in practice rarely possible for electrochemical systems . due to the complexity of the interactions with the solution",
    ", ab - initio methods can construct a reasonable horizontal corrugation potential  @xcite but give limited knowledge about the shape of the potential in the direction perpendicular to the surface .",
    "moreover , water has effects both in terms of damping and in the shape of the adsorption / desorption free - energy barrier , which probably corresponds to a reconstruction of the solvation shell . while analytic macroscopic theories can be derived in terms of mc parameters @xcite",
    ", such theories can not directly predict the values of those parameters . a rough estimate of the overall reaction rate",
    "constant can be obtained by applying standard electrochemical techniques @xcite to the experimental data .",
    "yet , the overall reaction rate gives little information , if any , about the free - energy barrier heights for the different processes of adsorption / desorption and surface diffusion .",
    "here we present an alternative approach : comparison of kmc results with time - dependent experimental results .",
    "in particular , we compare kmc simulations of a lattice - gas model with experimental results for cyclic - voltammetry ( cv ) studies of the electrosorption of br on single - crystal ag(100 ) surfaces .",
    "the lattice - gas model represents the long - lived configurations of adsorbed br , and an mc step corresponds to an attempt at hopping across a saddle point in the free - energy landscape to a new configuration  @xcite .",
    "the br / ag(100 ) system has a phase transition ( in the two - dimensional ising universality class ) between a disordered phase at more negative potentials and an ordered @xmath0 phase at more positive potentials  @xcite .",
    "the phase transition is associated with a divergence of the coverage fluctuations , corresponding to a peak in the cyclic voltammogram .",
    "the same phase transition has also been observed for cl / ag(@xmath1 ) in electrochemical  @xcite and ultra - high cavuum ( uhv ) environments  @xcite .",
    "recent static and kinetic mc studies have been used to investigate the phase ordering and disordering mechanisms in cyclic - voltammetry ( cv ) and sudden potential - step experiments for halide adsorption on ag(100 ) @xcite .",
    "as the cv scan rate is increased , the system is driven further from equilibrium . as a result",
    ", there is a widening of the separation between the positions of the cv peak for the positive - going and the negative - going scan of the electrode potential ( in experiments ) or the electrochemical potential ( in simulations ) .",
    "experimental peak separations have been measured for different sweep rates of the electrode potential  @xcite . when these experimental values , with time measured in seconds , are compared to the simulations , with time measured in monte carlo steps per site ( mcss ) , a physical time can be associated with the inverse mc attempt frequency .",
    "this was previously attempted by mitchell _",
    "et al . _",
    "@xcite , but simulations at that time could not achieve peak separations within the experimental range .",
    "due to the increase in computer power and to a new mean - field enhanced simulation method that we developed for calculating long - range interactions  @xcite , it is now possible to simulate peak separations well within the experimental range .",
    "we employ a lg model similar to that used by koper @xcite and mitchell , _ et al . _ @xcite .",
    "the br ions adsorb on four - fold hollow sites of the ag(100 ) surface  @xcite .",
    "the model is defined by the grand - canonical effective hamiltonian , @xmath2 where @xmath3 is a sum over all pairs of sites , @xmath4 are the lateral interactions between particles on the @xmath5th and @xmath6th lattice sites measured in  mev / pair , @xmath7 is the electrochemical potential measured in mev / particle , and @xmath8 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "the local occupation variables @xmath9 can take the values 1 or 0 , depending on whether site @xmath10 is occupied by an ion ( 1 ) or empty ( 0 ) .",
    "the simulations were performed on @xmath11 square lattices , using periodic boundary conditions to reduce finite - size effects .",
    "the interaction constants @xmath4 between ions on sites @xmath5 and @xmath6 a distance @xmath12 apart ( measured in units of the ag(100 ) lattice spacing , @xmath13   @xcite ) are given by @xmath14 where @xmath15 is a kronecker delta with the infinitely negative value for @xmath16 indicating nearest - neighbor exclusion .",
    "negative values of @xmath17 denote long - range repulsion .",
    "the interactions for large @xmath12 are most likely of electrostatic dipole - dipole nature  @xcite , but may also have a component mediated by the ag substrate  @xcite that may not be uniformly repulsive .    assuming a sufficient concentration of counterions in the electrolyte , the electrochemical potential @xmath18 is , in the dilute - solution approximation , related to the bulk ionic concentration @xmath19 and the electrode potential @xmath20 ( measured in mv ) as @xmath21 where @xmath22 is an arbitrary constant , @xmath23 is a reference concentration ( here @xmath24 ) , @xmath25 is boltzmann s constant times the temperature , and @xmath26 is the elementary charge unit .",
    "the electrosorption valency @xmath27  @xcite ( here assumed constant  @xcite ) corresponds to the fraction of the ionic charge transferred during the adsorption process .",
    "we use the sign convention that @xmath28 favors adsorption .",
    "the adsorbate coverage is defined as @xmath29 .",
    "it can be experimentally obtained by standard electrochemical methods , as well as from the integer - order peaks in surface x - ray scattering ( sxs ) data  @xcite .",
    "the derivative of the coverage with respect to the electrochemical potential , @xmath30 , is proportional to the current density in an experimental cv as described in section  [ sec : results ] .",
    "we have previously estimated the next - nearest - neighbor lateral interaction energy ( @xmath31  mev ) and the electrosorption valency ( @xmath32 ) , based on fits of simulated equilibrium adsorption isotherms to experimental data  @xcite . remarkably , despite the very different environments this value of @xmath17 , estimated from the shape of the adsorption isotherms , is consistent to within @xmath33 with the one obtained from the temperature dependence of the critical coverage for cl / ag(@xmath1 ) in uhv  @xcite . in the next section we detail the kinetic mc approach .",
    "kinetic monte carlo simulations were performed on systems with @xmath34 , and the absence of significant finite - size effects was verified by additional simulations for @xmath35 and 256 .",
    "the kinetic mc simulation proceeds as follows .",
    "we randomly select a lattice site @xmath5 , and depending on the occupation @xmath36 , different moves are attempted .",
    "if @xmath37 , only adsorption is attempted , while if @xmath38 , @xmath39 different moves are proposed : desorption , diffusion to each of the @xmath40 nearest - neighbor sites , and diffusion to each of the @xmath40 next - nearest - neighbor sites . next , a weighted list for accepting each of these moves is constructed using eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) below , to calculate the probabilities @xmath41 of the individual moves between the initial state @xmath42 and final state @xmath43 .",
    "the probability for the system to stay in the initial configuration is consequently @xmath44@xmath45  @xcite .    using a thermally activated , stochastic barrier - hopping picture ,",
    "the energy of the transition state for a microscopic change from an initial state @xmath42 to a final state @xmath43 is approximated by the symmetric butler - volmer formula  @xcite @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the energies of the initial and final states , respectively , @xmath49 is the transition state for process @xmath50 , and @xmath51 is a `` bare '' barrier associated with process @xmath50 , which here can be one of nearest - neighbor diffusion ( @xmath52 ) , next - nearest - neighbor diffusion ( @xmath53 ) , or adsorption / desorption ( @xmath54 ) .",
    "the probability for a particle to make a transition from state @xmath42 to state @xmath43 is approximated by the one - step arrhenius rate  @xcite @xmath55 where @xmath56 is the attempt frequency , which sets the overall timescale for the simulation .",
    "this formalism assumes that all processes @xmath50 have the same mc attempt frequency of @xmath57 mcss@xmath58 .",
    "although this assumption may not be true in general  @xcite , because different processes involve different potential wells and thus different vibrational frequencies , it can be used to find an effective timescale conversion between mc time and physical time , given the mc attempt frequencies . the mc time unit , one mcss , corresponds to the attempted update of @xmath59 randomly chosen sites . for a simulation with scan rate @xmath60 ( in mev / mcss ) , @xmath61 is incremented by ( @xmath62  mcss ) mev every mcss until it reaches its final value , and then decremented back to its initial value .",
    "since the value of @xmath63 determines @xmath64 in eq .",
    "( [ eq : p ] ) , the approximations made to calculate the large-@xmath65 contributions to the pair sum in eq .",
    "( [ eq : h ] ) are important . in our simulations , to calculate the energy changes we included the exact contributions for particle separations up to @xmath66 , while using a mean - field approximation for larger separations  @xcite .",
    "that best fits the equilibrium isotherms by @xmath67  @xcite . ]",
    "starting at an initial potential of @xmath68  mev and room temperature ( @xmath69 ) , the mc process discussed in sec .  [",
    "sec : methods ] was repeated until @xmath61 reached @xmath70  mev , and then decremented at the same rate back to @xmath71  mev .",
    "the coverage isotherms were computed using scan rates ranging over four decades , from @xmath72 to 0.1  mev / mcss , and for @xmath73 , 175 , 200 , 250 , 300 , 350 , and @xmath74  mev .",
    "the other barriers , @xmath75  mev and @xmath76  mev , were kept constant at the values determined by comparison with density - functional theory calculations  @xcite .",
    "the hysteresis loops for @xmath77 as a function of @xmath20 are shown for @xmath78  mev in fig .",
    "[ fig : covs ] for different scan rates .",
    "each loop was averaged over eight independent simulation runs .",
    "next , the savitzky - golay method  @xcite with a second - order polynomial and a window of 51 points was used to obtain the smoothed numerical derivative @xmath30 , which is proportional to the simulated cv current density  @xmath6  @xcite : @xmath79 where @xmath80 is the area of one adsorption site .",
    "consequently , the differential adsorption capacitance per unit area becomes @xmath81 as seen in  fig .",
    "[ fig : cvs ] , the difference between the positions of the positive - going and negative - going peaks depends on the scan rate .",
    "this difference is due to two physical effects .",
    "first , jamming due to the nearest - neighbor exclusion , which is only slowly alleviated by lateral diffusion @xcite , causes the coverage to lag behind its equilibrium value .",
    "second , critical slowing down also causes the coverage to equilibrate slowly near the phase transition at the cv peak @xcite .",
    "is plotted vs @xmath77 , rather than vs @xmath20 or @xmath61 , all the peaks fall in the range @xmath82 for positive - going scans and @xmath83 for negative - going scans .",
    "this is consistent with the values of the hard - square jamming coverage and critical coverage @xcite . ]    by fitting the separation of the positive - going scan peak ( @xmath84 ) and the negative - going scan peak ( @xmath85 ) of the simulated cvs to experimental data for @xmath86 vs d@xmath20/d@xmath87  @xcite , we can extract a physical time @xmath88 corresponding to 1 mcss ( the inverse mc attempt frequency , @xmath89 ) for each value of the adsorption / desorption free - energy barrier height @xmath90 .",
    "a @xmath91 which measures the square of the horizontal differences between the experimental curves and the simulated peak separations , multiplied by trial values of @xmath88 , was calculated .",
    "the value of @xmath88 which minimized @xmath91 was taken to be the best - fit value .",
    "see  fig .",
    "[ fig : peaksep ] .",
    "for @xmath92  mev , the simulations were fit to the experimental data points , while for @xmath93  mev the simulations were fit to the best - fit simulated data points for @xmath94  mev since the peak separations attainable for @xmath93  mev are not within the experimental data range . the fits for most values of @xmath95 coincide to within the accuracy of the experimental data and our statistics . yet , focusing on the experimental data range ( inset in fig .",
    "[ fig : peaksep ] ) , suggests that @xmath96 and @xmath97 s fits best to the experimental data .",
    "this distinction relies mainly on the two experimental data points corresponding to the highest scan rates and thus would be better founded if there were more experimental data in that range .",
    "in addition , since the simulated curves for @xmath98  mev practically coincide , it is only for @xmath99  mev that a clear distinction can be made among the different @xmath95 values , even with more accurate experimental data .    for @xmath100",
    "mev , the physical time @xmath88 corresponding to one mcss is simply related to @xmath54 as seen in fig .",
    "[ fig : inversetime ] . the relationship between @xmath88 and @xmath54",
    "is related to the arrhenius form : @xmath101 or @xmath102 @xmath103 ( excluding @xmath104  mev ) , in very good agreement with what is expected from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) with the inverse temperature used , @xmath105 .",
    "we also find that , as @xmath54 decreases and becomes comparable to @xmath53 and @xmath52 , diffusion becomes relatively more important in determining the overall timescale , and the dependence of @xmath88 on @xmath54 deviates from eq .",
    "( [ eq : tau ] ) .",
    "this deviation makes differentiation among different values of @xmath54 easier because in this limit a change in @xmath54 can not be compensated by a change in @xmath88 , and the details of the dynamics directly influence the peak separation .",
    "by comparing with experiments simulations at potential - scan rates sufficiently slow to produce peak separations that fall within the experimental range , we were able to extract a physical timescale associated with the inverse mc attempt frequency @xmath97  s , a value much larger than normally expected .",
    "this may be the result of relatively flat potential minima for the adsorption process , possibly related to reorganization of the ion hydration shells .",
    "another possible reason is the assumption that all processes in the mc have the same attempt frequency ; different processes could , in general , have different mc attempt frequencies .",
    "thus @xmath88 would correspond to an effective inverse mc attempt frequency for an overall process .    for values of the adsorption",
    "/ desorption free - energy barrier @xmath54 that are large compared to the diffusion barriers ( @xmath106  200  mev ) , the relationship between @xmath88 and @xmath54 is consistent with the arrhenius law . under such conditions",
    "the process of br adsorption / desorption controls the dynamics in this electrochemical system , and the possible difference in attempt frequencies for different processes becomes less important . for situations in which @xmath54 is comparable to the values of the lateral diffusion of adsorbates on the substrate , deviations from the arrhenius law appear",
    ". then no process is dominant . in conclusion",
    "we have here shown that simulations which measure the competition between these processes can be used to distinguish between different @xmath54 values by comparison to experiments .",
