    "the behavior of superconductors in strong rf fields involves many complex mechanisms related to a nonlinear electromagnetic response of nonequilibrium quasiparticles , pairbreaking suppression of superconducting gap @xmath10 and penetration of vortices at higher rf amplitudes @xcite .",
    "the physics behind the nonlinear rf response has recently attracted much attention due to the development of a new generation of high - performance superconducting nb cavities for particle accelerators , in which the peak surface ghz fields @xmath11 close to the thermodynamic critical field @xmath9 were reached at a very high quality factor @xmath12 characteristic of the meissner state @xcite . at such strong rf fields",
    "the peak surface current density @xmath13 approaches the depairing current density @xmath14 at which the meissner state becomes unstable with respect to avalanche penetration of vortices once the instantaneous rf field @xmath11 exceeds the superheating field @xmath15 . in turn",
    ", penetration of vortices causes a sharp increase in the surface resistance @xmath4 .",
    "as far as the very high quality factors are concerned , of particular interest is the behavior of @xmath4 in s - wave superconductors at low temperatures @xmath16 and frequencies @xmath17 , for which the rf field can not break the cooper pairs , and the very low meissner surface resistance @xmath18 is due to an exponentially small density of thermally - activated quasiparticles ( unlike the power - law dependence @xmath19 due to nodal quasiparticles in d - wave superconductors @xcite ) . in this case penetration of even few vortices driven by extremely high rf currents densities",
    "@xmath20 can produce strong energy dissipation comparable to that in the meissner state , which in turn , can trigger thermomagnetic flux avalanches and the superconductivity breakdown .",
    "it is therefore important to understand mechanisms , which control dynamics of single vortex penetration under strong rf fields .",
    "yet , the rf field onset of vortex penetration @xmath21 , and the dissipated power @xmath22 as functions of @xmath8 and @xmath23 , and the relation between @xmath21 and the thermodynamic @xmath9 and the lower critical field @xmath24 are still not well understood .",
    "these problems include complex kinetics of the emergence of the vortex core at the surface , and the subsequent nonlinear large - amplitude oscillation of the vortex at the surface driven by strong rf currents much higher than depinning critical current density .",
    "this situation can not be described by a well developed linear electrodynamics of a superconductor in the pinned mixed state weakly deformed by rf currents @xcite .",
    "some issues of nonlinear vortex dynamics in ramping magnetic fields have been addressed in extensive numerical simulations of the time - dependent ginzburg - landau ( tdgl ) equations @xcite valid at @xmath25 , and molecular dynamics simulations @xcite .",
    "however , few experimental and theoretical results on vortices driven by very strong rf currents at low temperatures have been published in the literature .    in this paper",
    "we address nonlinear rf dynamics of a single vortex moving in and out of a type - ii superconductor through an oscillating magnetic surface barrier locally weakened by a surface defect .",
    "we show that already this basic problem involves a rich physics , since even weak meissner fields @xmath26 can drive the vortex with velocities @xmath2 so high that the linear bardeen - stephen viscous drag model becomes inadequate . as a result ,",
    "the vortex velocity @xmath2 can exceed the sound velocity , causing the cherenkov generation of hypersound @xcite .",
    "moreover , @xmath2 can exceed the critical velocity @xmath27 , above which the vortex drag coefficient @xmath3 decreases as @xmath28 increases , and the viscous drag force @xmath29 reaches maximum at the critical velocity @xmath27 , resulting in the jumpwise larkin - ovchinnikov ( lo ) instability @xcite .",
    "the lo instability has been extensively investigated by dc transport measurements @xcite on both low - t@xmath30 and high - t@xmath30 superconductors for which @xmath31 km / s have been typically observed at low @xmath6 and @xmath32 .",
    "single - vortex dynamics under strong rf field also involves annihilation of vortex - antivortex pairs , and a cascade of single , double and multiple vortex penetrations .",
    "competition of the rf driving force , image attraction to the surface , and the viscous drag force results in a strong dependence of the dissipated power @xmath22 on the rf amplitude and frequency .",
    "very high vortex velocities achieved at fields @xmath33 required to break the surface barrier make it possible to probe the behavior of vortices under extreme conditions , for which the lorentz driving force approaches its ultimate depairing limit . because of strong heating effects , these conditions are hard to reproduce in dc transport experiments ( except in high - power pulse measurements @xcite ) .",
    "the importance of heating effects for transport instabilities in superconductors at low temperatures is well known @xcite . in this paper",
    "we show that heating is a key limiting factor for the high - field surface resistance at @xmath16 as well , even for single vortices driven by strong rf meissner currents .",
    "in particular , viscous vortex dynamics coupled with electron overheating can result in the lo - type behavior of @xmath3 , thermal rf breakdown , long - range interaction ( on scales much greater than the london penetration depth ) between a vortex and the surface and between vortices themselves .",
    "the paper is organized as follows . in section",
    "ii we establish the main parameters of interest by considering penetration and dissipation of a single vortex over the oscillating surface barrier in type - ii superconductors described by the dynamic equation , in which the linear bardeen - stephen viscous drag force is balanced by the lorentz driving force and the image attraction force at the surface in the london theory . even in this basic model",
    "rf vortex dynamics always involves annihilation of vortex - antivortex pairs for @xmath34 close to the penetration field @xmath21 and a strong dependence of the dissipated power @xmath1 on the rf frequency and amplitude . in section - iii we show that the bardeen - stephen model actually has a very limited applicability because vortices breaking through the surface barrier reach supersonic velocity so the dependence of the viscous drag coefficient @xmath3 must be taken into account . in this case",
    "vortex dynamics becomes strongly coupled with nonequilibrium overheating of the vortex core , resulting in jumpwise penetration of single vortices through the surface barrier , and significant increase in @xmath22 . in section iv we consider the effect of pinning on rf surface resistance .",
    "in particular , we show that trapped vortices can result in a temperature independent , field - hysteretic residual resistance , which can _ decrease _ as the rf field increases .",
    "pinned vortices can also produce hotspots , which ignite thermal rf breakdown .",
    "section v is devoted to dissipation around hotspots and their nonlinear contribution to the global surface resistance .",
    "the thermal breakdown of the meissner state ignited by vortex hotspots is addressed .",
    "section vi concludes with a discussion of the results .",
    "= 0.43    penetration of vortices in a superconductor is controlled by the bean - livingston surface barrier , which results from a competition between the meissner screening currents pushing the vortex in a superconductor and the attraction force between a vortex and the surface @xcite .",

    "we assume that there is a distribution of sparse small regions with reduced local @xmath21 on the surface where vortices first enter . penetration of straight vortices can only be initiated by linear defects ( for example , dislocations or grain boundaries ) parallel to the vortex line . for more common 3d surface defects , such as precipitates or local variation of chemical composition ,",

    "the velocity for the right intersection point @xmath699 decreases as f increases .",
    "if @xmath700 the branch @xmath697 describes all smooth parts of the vortex trajectory and also provides @xmath701 for the initial condition @xmath702 . for @xmath703 ,",
    "the vortex jumps from @xmath704 to the point @xmath106 where friction is able to balance the drive . here",
    "@xmath705 are defined by the condition @xmath706 .",
    "the branch @xmath697 describes all smooth parts of @xmath37 provided that @xmath707 , so that @xmath708 always decreases below @xmath275 after the jump .    for high rf frequencies or strong vortex core overheating , there are situations , for which @xmath709 after the jump . for example , if @xmath710 , the term with the @xmath711 in f can be neglected , and @xmath712 becomes : @xmath713 which tends to become positive at higher frequencies . in this case",
    "the vortex can not jump to the point where @xmath285 , since the friction force can not balance @xmath269 if @xmath714 , because @xmath274 keeps increasing above @xmath275 so @xmath2 becomes greater than @xmath27 .",
    "thus , for @xmath715 , friction can only stop the vortex jump if @xmath716 , thus we have to consider the branch @xmath699 as well .",
    "we should therefore construct the trajectory , for which the vortex first jumps at @xmath717 to the new point @xmath718 and acquires the velocity @xmath719 .",
    "after that @xmath2 continuously decreases from @xmath720 at @xmath717 to @xmath27 at @xmath721 , as described by the first order differential equation @xmath722 $ ] . here",

    "if @xmath726 changes sign at any point of the descending branch @xmath699 , the vortex can not not reach @xmath27 , so @xmath2 passes through a minimum at some @xmath728 and then starts accelerating continuously . on the other hand if the vortex reaches @xmath27 at @xmath729 , the jump instability occurs .",
