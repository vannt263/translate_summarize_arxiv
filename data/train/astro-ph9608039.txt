    "hot , x - ray  emitting gas is an important component of the gaseous content of the universe .",
    "it usually dominates the interstellar medium of elliptical galaxies ( @xcite ) .",
    "it also accounts for most of the baryonic mass of rich clusters of galaxies and up to 30% of their total gravitating mass ( @xcite ) .",
    "such observations led suto et al .",
    "( 1996 ; hereafter smio ) to suggest that the local group of galaxies might have a substantial x - ray halo of its own .",
    "this hypothesized hot intragroup medium ( igm ) could contribute much of the excess in the soft ( @xmath11 kev ) x - ray background .",
    "recent measurements have shown that this excess is well - fit by a thermal model with solar metallicity and a temperature of 0.16 kev ( @xcite ) .",
    "determining the contributors to the x - ray background is crucial to understanding it .",
    "furthermore , smio point out that such a local group x - ray halo would produce a significant quadrupole anisotropy in the microwave background through the sunyaev - zeldovich ( sz ) effect ( @xcite ) .",
    "this quadrupole signature , @xmath2 , could in principle account for the entirety of the quadrupole signal observed by cobe : @xmath3k ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the cobe measurement provides a critical constraint on cosmological models .",
    "the power spectrum of primordial density fluctuations is usually parameterized as @xmath4 .",
    "the spectral index @xmath5 is a primary component of any cosmological model , with the scale invariant value @xmath6 being the preferred `` natural '' value of inflationary models .",
    "the cobe observations provide both the normalization @xmath7 and powerful constraints on @xmath5 .",
    "the cobe normalization on large angular scales is far too high relative to the power on smaller ( galaxy to cluster ) scales for the predictions of the `` standard '' @xmath6 cold dark matter model ( e.g. , @xcite ) .",
    "the need for relatively more power on large scales as indicated by cobe is a primary motivation for considering contrived models with admixtures of hot as well as cold dark matter .",
    "a significant local contribution to @xmath8 through the sz effect would alter the range of viable cosmological models significantly , perhaps even reviving standard cold dark matter .",
    "it is therefore very important to place limits on the potential @xmath2 of the putative local group hot igm .",
    "since we are embedded in the hot interstellar medium of the galaxy , it is exceedingly difficult to disentangle the possible contribution of a hot igm to the diffuse x - ray background from other , more local sources .",
    "however , the local group can be placed in context of observations of other groups of galaxies .",
    "while the suggestion of a significant local group igm was made as a parallel to the highly luminous intracluster media of rich clusters , groups provide a more enlightening comparison . with the advent of the @xmath0 pspc ,",
    "many observations of galaxy groups of varying richness have been obtained , so such comparisons can be made .",
    "while poor groups of galaxies tend to be somewhat more populated and more dense ( in projection ) than the local group , they provide a much better comparison for the x - ray properties of the local group than rich clusters .",
    "the @xmath0 pspc has provided the necessary sensitivity and angular resolution to make a detailed study of the diffuse x - ray emission seen in some galaxy groups .",
    "pspc observations reveal that , in general , x - ray ",
    "luminous groups contain more elliptical galaxies than spirals and the first - ranked galaxy in these groups is an elliptical ( pildis , bregman , & evrard 1995 , @xcite ) .",
    "very few groups with a spiral majority ( the local group has no bright ellipticals ) have detected x - ray emission , perhaps due to their not being sufficiently compact to contain an igm or the temperature of the igm being too low for the pspc to detect .",

    "the relevant quantities are t , the temperature of the plasma , the column density , which one can parameterize as @xmath31 ( where @xmath32 is the central electron density and @xmath33 is the core radius ) , and the distance of the milky way from the center of the local group , @xmath34 .",
    "smio assumed a local group igm with t=1 kev , @xmath32=@xmath35 @xmath36 , and @xmath33=150 kpc , and assumed @xmath34=350 kpc .",
    "table 1 lists the values for these quantities for the groups analyzed by pildis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) , as well as the values that smio assumed . for the purposes of this comparison",
    ", we retain the value of @xmath34 used by smio , as if one were to replace the local group igm with that of the other groups .",
    "three groups in the sample of pildis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) are not included in table 1 because they are not spatially resolved in the pspc observations : hcg 4 , 92 , and 94 ( see @xcite for details ) .",
    "the upper limits assume the typical core radius ( 33 kpc ) and temperature ( 1 kev ) observed in the x - ray  luminous groups , and use a calculated central density determined from the 3@xmath37 upper limit on the number of counts within the group radius in their pspc observations ( @xcite ) .",
    "mulchaey et al .",
    "( 1996 ) do not list central densities , but find average temperatures of @xmath11 kev and core radii ranging from 9 kpc to over 300 kpc , with a median value of 43 kpc ( excluding the groups from @xcite ) .",
    "note that the observed groups tend to have smaller values of @xmath33 and greater values of @xmath32 than smio assumed for the local group igm , while the values for t are similar .",
    "figure 1 shows an expanded version of fig .  4 of smio , with the addition of the data presented in table 1 and smio s own model for the local group igm .",
    "the theoretical curves follow from equation  ( 9 ) of smio , @xmath38^{-1},\\ ] ] where @xmath39 is the electron mass , @xmath40 the speed of light , @xmath41 the thomson scattering cross section , and @xmath42 is the boltzmann constant .",
    "there is also a numerical fudge factor @xmath43 due to the spherical harmonic multipoles ( see equations 4 and 5 of smio ) which smio calculate numerically but do not explicitly state .",
    "we have adopted @xmath44 to match their curve for @xmath45k .",
    "one detected group , hcg 97 , does not appear on the graph due to its large value of @xmath34/@xmath33 .",
    "note that the ngc 2300 group , which is dominated by neither spirals nor ellipticals , has the lowest value of @xmath31 t of all the detections .",
    "even the brightest elliptical - dominated groups in the pildis et al .",
    "( 1995 ) sample fall well short of producing the observed @xmath46k . also well below the curve ,",
    "puzzlingly enough , are the igm parameters assumed by smio .",
    "it is rather mysterious why they explicitly suggest that `` the lg x - ray halo can potentially have a significant effect on the quadrupole of the cmb anisotropies '' when their own optimistic estimate of the local group parameters give @xmath47 .",
    "the maximum quadrupole anisotropy consistent with the spiral - dominated groups appears to be 0.1 @xmath48k , a factor of 60 less than @xmath8 .",
    "so , unless the local group is extremely unusual , any hot igm that it may contain is simply not relevant to the cobe quadrupole anisotropy measurement .",
    "while it is clear that many systematic effects come into play in determining the characteristics of an igm from an x - ray observation ( notably the assumed metallicity of the gas and the background level of the observation ; see @xcite for an enlightening discussion ) , these effects could change the core radius and central density fitted to these groups by no more than a factor of a few , and likely much less .",
    "the temperature of galaxy groups are well - determined to be close to 1 kev on average . with the further observation that the local group is less populated and more diffuse than even the average _ undetected _ spiral - dominated group",
    ", it appears extremely unlikely that a local group igm could produce a significant fraction of the cobe quadrupole anisotropy .",
    "perhaps a more plausible source for the soft excess in the x - ray background is a combination of the probable x - ray halo of the milky way plus emission from the local superbubble .",
    "previous studies of the 1/4 and 3/4 kev x - ray backgrounds point towards their origination in the galaxy rather than the local group ( @xcite ) .",
    "recent observations of x - ray shadowing by high - latitude molecular clouds demonstrates that the 3/4 kev background is dominated by emission from the local superbubble , while the 1/4 kev background is likely to arise from a patchy hot halo surrounding the milky way ( @xcite ) .",
    "a significant fraction of spiral galaxies considered to be similar to our own galaxy are also seen to have patchy soft x - ray haloes ( @xcite ) .",
    "since the x - ray emission in spiral - dominated groups is due solely to the component galaxies , there is no reason to expect that a local group igm would be an important component of the local x - ray background .",
    "in light of the possibly substantial effect a local group x - ray  emitting halo could have on the local soft x - ray and microwave backgrounds , as suggested by smio , we have considered the x - ray properties of poor groups of galaxies .",
    "sparse , spiral - dominated groups like the local group have yet to be detected in x - rays , and even elliptical - dominated groups have low luminosities relative to rich clusters . we therefore conclude that    1 .   unless the local group is exceedingly unusual for groups of its type",
    ", it does not have a significant 1 kev x - ray halo .",
    "the contribution of any hot gas in the local group igm to the soft ( 1 kev ) x - ray background is negligible .",
    "a more important contributor might be hot gas associated with the milky way itself .",
    "the contribution of a local group x - ray halo to the cobe quadrupole anisotropy measurement through the sunyaev - zeldovich effect is completely negligible : @xmath49k @xmath50k .    since spiral - dominated groups as yet have only upper limits rather than actual detections of their igm , this upper limit on @xmath2 is quite hard unless the local group igm is very exceptional ( e.g. , comparable to that of a rich cluster of galaxies ) .",
    "thus , the quadrupole anisotropy measured by cobe must represent the true cosmic signature .",
    "the level at which this places the normalization of the primordial power spectrum remains an uncomfortable fact which cosmological models must fit .",
