    "neutrinos dominate the energetics of core - collapse supernovae due to the high neutrino fluxes that are emitted as the proto - neutron star forms .",
    "observations indicate that the typical explosion kinetic energy of ccsne is @xmath4  ergs .",
    "this is only @xmath51% of the emitted neutrino energy within the first few seconds after bounce .    despite recent developments in computational methods ,",
    "however , a detailed understanding the explosion mechanism of ccsne has not yet emerged .",
    "spherically symmetric models tend to not explode and those two - dimensional ( 2d ) and three dimensional ( 3d ) models that do explode , tend to explode with too little energy @xcite .",
    "the problem is that , although a shock forms successfully and propagates outward in mass , it loses energy to the photodissociation of heavy nuclei and quickly becomes a standing accretion shock .",
    "there have been many attempts to revitalize the stalled shock via hydrodynamic effects , such as the standing accretion shock instability ( sasi)@xcite and neutrino heated convection @xcite , but even in these cases the explosion energies tend to be too low @xcite .",
    "nevertheless , given the enormous neutrino fluxes present , it is unavoidable that neutrinos should play a dominant role in the explosion mechanism .",
    "even one dimensional spherically symmetric models will explode in simulations with enhanced neutrino fluxes , either from convection below the neutrinosphere @xcite or a qcd phase transition @xcite . in this paper",
    ", we explore the resonant mixing @xcite between a sterile and electron ( or antineutrinos ) as a means to increase the early neutrino luminosity and revitalize the shock . in ref .",

    "the efficient transport of neutrino energy using sterile neutrinos was first proposed by hidaka and fuller @xcite . using a one zone collapse calculation",

    "a resonant conversion @xmath7 could occur deep inside the proto - neutron star core .",
    "although this initially decreases the shock energy by decreasing the electron fraction in the core and removing energy , they found that a second resonance may occur near the pro - neutron star surface .",
    "thus , the resonant mixing of sterile neutrinos and electron neutrinos can serve as an efficient method of transporting neutrino energy out from the proto - neutron star core , where high energy neutrinos are trapped .",
    "the sterile neutrinos then arrive at the the stalled shock to assist in neutrino reheating .",
    "this mechanism is highly sensitive to the feedback between neutrino oscillations and the local composition , energy transport , and hydrodynamics and warrants detailed numerical studies such as those summarized in this paper .    in ref .",

    "additionally , much work has been done on the impact of sterile neutrinos in heavy element nucleosynthesis in the neutrino driven winds @xcite .",
    "the research on nucleosynthesis has focused on a light @xmath5ev mass sterile neutrino that is consistent with anomalous results found at the lsnd and miniboone reactor neutrino experiments and relies upon a single resonance to convert @xmath10 in the neutrino driven wind in order to generate the low electron fraction necessary in the region for r - process nucleosynthesis to occur .",
    "the present work , however , will focus on the impact of @xmath5kev mass sterile neutrinos .",

    "it seems unnatural that in the standard model there are no right handed neutrinos .",
    "this is after all the simplest symmetry imaginable .",
    "if neutrinos are massless , and lepton numbers are conserved as was thought when the standard model was first developed , then one must avoid a right - handed neutrino . however , it is now known that neutrinos both have mass and that they change their flavors .",
    "hence , the introduction of right handed ( sterile neutrinos ) is , perhaps the most plausible extension of the standard model .",
    "one simply adds to the standard model lagrangian a dirac equation for the right - handed neutrinos @xmath11 plus yukawa couplings @xmath12,@xcite @xmath13 where @xmath14 is the sterile neutrino mass , @xmath15 are left - handed leptonic doublets ( where @xmath16 ) , @xmath17 is a higgs doublet , and @xmath12 are yukawa couplings . since the right handed neutrinos have no electric , weak or strong charges they are dubbed `` sterile '' or `` singlet '' .    introducing this lagrangian",
    "has the possibility to solve two of the problems of the standard model , i.e. the masses of active neutrinos and the existence of dark matter . if the dirac masses @xmath18 are much smaller than the majorana masses @xmath14 , then the type i seesaw formula @xcite relates the active neutrino masses @xmath19 to the sterile neutrino masses , i.e. @xmath20 where @xmath21 is a @xmath22 matrix of active neutrino masses , mixings , and ( possible ) cp - violating phases .    also ,",
    "since there is freedom to select from a wide range of sterile neutrino masses , they have the possibility to be a viable dark matter candidate . however , detecting such sterile neutrinos in dark matter detectors is challenging compared to that of other wimp candidates since its interaction with normal matter is suppressed by a factor of the weak coupling constant times the oscillation mixing angle with normal matter .",
    "rather , the best chance to detect sterile neutrino dark matter is through its radiative decay or its affect on core collapse supernovae which is the subject of this paper .",
    "radiative decays of dark matter are allowed in many models , including sterile neutrinos . in extensions of the standard model , sterile neutrinos",
    "have several possible decay modes .",
    "the primary decay channel is to three light , active neutrinos and is thus virtually invisible .",
    "however , several radiative decay channels are also allowed .",
    "the most important is via two body decay to a photon and a light , active neutrino , e.g.  @xmath23 , where the photon energy is simply @xmath24 .",
    "the rate of this decay has been investigated for both dirac and majorana neutrinos @xcite and is large enough to potentially place bounds on the sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle .",
    "the rate for a majorana neutrino is @xcite @xmath25 where @xmath26 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath27 is the singlet neutrino mixing angle and @xmath28 is the sterile neutrino mass .",
    "it should be noted , however , that this decay rate is model dependent @xcite and only applies for the most basic majorana neutrino mass models .    with the advent of modern x - ray telescopes ,",
    "the detection of such decay modes is feasible .",
    "although the decay rate is small , the dark matter density in galactic halos and galaxy clusters is large enough to generate a potentially measurable flux . assuming that sterile neutrinos are the only component of dark matter , the flux observed in a detector from a dark matter halo should scale as @xcite @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the distance to the source , @xmath31 is the decay rate for a sterile neutrino of mass @xmath28 and mixing angle @xmath32 ( eq .  [ eq : gamma ] ) ) , and @xmath33 is the total dark matter mass within the telescope s field of view . if the observed decaying sterile neutrinos are only a fractional component of the total dark matter ( due to other sterile neutrino flavors , wimps , etc ) , then a particular observed flux may be fit by a larger mixing angle , since the flux given in eq .",
    "( [ eq : flux ] ) scales with the product of both the total observed mass of decaying sterile neutrino and sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle . as the fraction of the total dark matter mass in decaying sterile neutrino diminishes , a larger mixing angle is required to explain the observed flux .",
    "observations with the _ chandra _ and _ xmm newton _ satellites of x - ray emission from various galaxies and galaxy clusters @xcite have attempted to put upper bounds on the parameters of these decays . however , recent observations by boyarsky et al.@xcite and bulbul et al.@xcite have detected an unidentified emission line at @xmath5  3.5 kev .",
    "the mixing angle is best fit as @xmath34 for a single dark - matter sterile neutrino .",
    "additional bounds may be placed on the mixing of a sterile neutrino with an electron neutrino from dark matter over- and under - production in the @xmath35msm @xcite and phase space bounds for fermonic dark matter @xcite .",

    "( color available online ) ]    interpretation of this anomalous x - ray emission @xcite however remains ambiguous due to possible observational backgrounds .",
    "many dark matter systems , such as the galactic center or galaxy clusters , are x - ray bright objects with contributions from both point sources and plasma emission .",
    "although efforts have been made to model this background using multi - temperature plasma models , constraining uncertainties such as the temperatures and compositions in such complicated systems is difficult .",
    "it has been argued @xcite that the observed 3.5 kev line may be due to known plasma lines , mainly k xviii lines at 3.48 and 3.52 kev .",
    "however , fits of the 3.5 kev emission with a potassium line @xcite require either an abundance of potassium far in excess of solar , or an emissivity higher than that predicted for these systems .",
    "* the non - detection of such an x - ray line from dwarf spheroidal galaxies raises further questions about the nature of this emission line .",
    "dwarf spheroidal galaxies are extremely dark matter dominated objects and , given the observations of bulbul et al.@xcite and boyarsky et al.@xcite , one expects to see x - ray emission from these objects as well .",
    "however , recent simulations @xcite show that it may be possible to account for the non - detection of x - ray emission from dwarf spheroidal galaxies using a multicomponent dark matter model with both cold and warm components , where the warm component is a sterile neutrino that decays via 3.5 kev photon emission and the cold component can be any heavy other sterile neutrinos , wimps or another dark - matter candidate .",
    "there remains some controversy over the formation of such objects , since @xmath36cdm models over predict the formation of milky way satellites compared to current observations @xcite whereas wdm models wash out dark matter over - densities on these scales @xcite .",
    "these multicomponent dark matter simulations accurately describe the observed number of milky way satellites and the non - detection of x - ray emission from dwarf spheroidals . *    moreover , we note that the constraint on the mixing angle in figure [ fig : bounds ] is based upon the assumption that a single sterile neutrino comprises 100% of the dark matter .",
    "if a decaying sterile neutrino comprises only a small fraction of the total dark matter density due to other sterile neutrinos and/or wimps , etc .",
    ", then a larger mixing angle is allowed .",
    "to solve the full neutrino mixing problem with a sterile neutrino requires an understanding of the full @xmath37 mixing matrix , including mass differences and mixing angles between all neutrino species . for the most part ,",
    "however , studies have been limited to oscillations between just an electron neutrino @xmath38 and sterile neutrino @xmath8 ( and their antiparticles ) or just a @xmath39 and sterile neutrino @xmath8 .    in vacuum ,",
    "neutrino mixings between an electron neutrino and a sterile neutrino are governed by the vacuum mixing angle @xmath40 and mass - squared difference @xmath41 . however ,",
    "in dense matter such as in supernovae , the forward scattering of sterile neutrinos off of baryons and leptons gives rise to an effective `` in - medium '' mixing angle as a function of position @xmath42 , @xmath43 where @xmath44 , @xmath45 is the neutrino energy , and @xmath46 is the forward scattering potential for a neutrino of flavor @xmath47 .",
    "an electron neutrino in the supernova environment will experience a forward scattering potential of the form @xcite @xmath48 where @xmath26 is the fermi coupling constant , @xmath49 is the baryon number density , and @xmath50 is the number fraction of species @xmath51 .",
    "a @xmath52 neutrino will experience a forward scattering potential of the form@xcite @xmath53 and a @xmath54 neutirino will experience @xmath55 the antineutrino species experience scattering potentials with the opposite sign . in the present work ,",
    "adopt @xmath56 , since @xmath52 and @xmath54 neutrinos and antineutrinos are produced entirely by pair creation processes and thus occur in equal numbers .",
    "looking at eq .",
    "( [ eq : mixing ] ) , one can see that it is possible to get maximal mixing in matter ( @xmath57 ) even when the vacuum mixing angle is small .",
    "this resonant mixing occurs for neutrinos with the energy @xmath58 thus , any neutrinos of species @xmath47 at position @xmath42 and with energy @xmath59 will experience a mikheyev - smirnov - wolfenstein ( msw ) resonance @xcite .    in this study , we have only considered coherent and adiabatic neutrino oscillations .",
    "coherent oscillations occur when the resonance width is greater than the neutrino mean free path .",
    "the resonance occurs over a finite distance ( or time ) on the neutrino s world line , @xmath60 which defines the resonance width .",
    "this corresponds to the distance over which the in - medium mixing angle falls from a maximum to one half ( @xmath61 ) .",
    "the adiabaticity of the resonance is a measure of the efficiency of the conversion of neutrino flavor .",
    "the resonance can be considered adiabatic if the the resonance width is much greater than the oscillation length , @xmath62 where the oscillation length is related to the neutrino energy and vacuum mixing parameters , @xmath63 if the oscillation is both coherent and adiabatic , all of the neutrinos of a given flavor @xmath47 within an energy band @xmath64 centered at the resonance energy @xmath59 will oscillate to sterile neutrinos , and vice versa .",
    "it is likely that decoherent , scattering - induced oscillations will be important in the high matter densities achieved in the collapsing core , but this will not be a dominant effect and it is sufficient here to only consider coherent and adiabatic neutrino oscillations . we leave the exploration of scattering - induced effects to future work .    in ref .",

    "there is a large region of the parameter space that enhances the explosion energy by at least a few percent and part of this parameter space overlaps with possible dark matter candidates .",
    "however , the 7 kev sterile neutrino inferred from x - ray observations would not affect the supernova unless it has a substantial mixing angle ( @xmath72 ) corresponding to @xmath73% of the total dark matter density .",
    "similarly , for @xmath74 mixing , we found no significant enhancement ( or depletion ) to the shock energy for the parameter space of sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle considered here .",

    "although we have shown that the scenario of a single sterile neutrino constituting 100% of the dark matter does not affect the dynamics of ccsne , one would like to know the possible effect of a lighter stable sterile neutrino or a 7 kev sterile neutrino with a much larger mixing angle contributing to a small fraction of the total dark matter . * for illustration",

    "the neutrino luminosities of all neutrino and antineutrino flavors are enhanced from about 0.2s to 0.4s post - bounce .",
    "it is this increase in the neutrino luminosities that increases the neutrino reheating behind the stalled shock , and thus enhances the explosion energy .",
    "the timescale of the increase of the neutrino luminosities corresponds to the time post - bounce when the explosion energy becomes enhanced .",
    "it is somewhat counterintuitive that oscillations between electron and sterile neutrinos would result in an increase in the luminosities of all neutrino flavors .",
    "however , it is important to note that the oscillation does nt directly lead to increased neutrino reheating behind the shock .",
    "rather , a `` double reheating '' phenomenon occurs , whereby the @xmath69 oscillation leads to additional heating near the location of the neutrinosphere , this heating at the neutrinosphere causes increased neutrino luminosities in all three flavors , and finally these enhanced neutrino luminosities reheat the stalled shock .",

    "( color available online ) ]    the enhancement of the neutrino luminosities in figure [ fig : luminosity ] based upon a 1  kev sterile neutrino are similar to those of ref .  [ ] made with an @xmath80 kev sterile neutrino with similar mixing angle with one exception . a striking feature in the 5 kev case of ref .  [ ] and the 7  kev case explored in this work is the appearance of episodic neutrino bursts with a period of 30 - 40 ms ( 5 kev ) or 40 - 50 ms ( 7 kev ) in the luminosity and flux .",
    "this episodic variation of the neutrino luminosity is due to the fact that the neutrino photospheric luminosity of the proto - neutron star is fixed by the ratio of the total internal energy to the neutrino diffusion time .",
    "when the neutrino chemical potential falls above the resonance energy , those neutrinos in the energy groups corresponding to the resonance energy and width immediately have a diffusion time scale drastically shortened by the free streaming of the sterile neutrinos to just below the neutrinosphere .",
    "hence , there is a precipitous drop in the average diffusion time scale and a concomitant increase in the luminosity .",
    "however , in the 5 kev and 7 kev cases , once a significant fraction of available ( mostly anti - electron ) neutrinos is depleted , the process is shut off and the luminosity actually decreases until neutrinos can diffuse back into the depleted energy and spatial groups .",
    "the difference between the 5 kev and the 1 kev case is due to the fact that the resonance width @xmath81 .",
    "hence , the energy width of the depleted neutrino energy spectrum is much less for a 1 kev sterile neutrino than for a heavy 5 or 7 kev neutrino .",
    "the 1 kev neutrinos can quickly diffuse to fill the gap in the spectrum and the episodic burst effect is minimal .",
    "moreover , the amplitude and period of the luminosity spikes scale roughly linearly with neutrino mass .",
    "this means that should an oscillation of the type shown here and in ref .",
    "[ ] may be detected in a next generation neutrino detector such as hyper - kamiokande,@xcite its amplitude and period could be used to infer the mass of the oscillating sterile neutrino .    independently of the episodic fluctuation effect ,",
    "the basic mechanism for the enhancement in the observable neutrino luminosities is evident in the behavior of the neutrinosphere .",
    "figure  [ fig : nusph ] shows the neutrinosphere radius versus time post - bounce in simulations with and without a sterile neutrino .",
    "it is evident that oscillations between electron neutrinos and sterile neutrinos heat the proto - neutron star surface and cause it to expand by depositing additional neutrino energy at the location of the second resonance .",
    "this leads to an increased neutrinosphere radius .",
    "figure  [ fig : nutemp ] shows the temperature versus radius at an illustrative time ( 250 ms post - bounce ) for simulations with and without a sterile neutrino . as can be seen in figure  [ fig : nutemp ] , the proto - neutron star surface is heated and extended in the simulation with a sterile neutrino , compared to a simulation without a sterile neutrino . although the radius of the neutrinosphere is increased in the presence of a sterile neutrino , the temperature at the neutrinosphere remains the same in all three simulations .",
    "thus , the larger neutrinosphere area ( @xmath82 ) leads to an enhanced emission of neutrinos , but the neutrinos are emitted with nearly the same average energy in both simulations .",
    "this figure confirms that scillations between an electron neutrino and sterile neutrino can lead to a significant enhancement of the explosion energy in core - collapse supernova simulations .",
    "this enhancement is due to the expansion of the neutrinosphere and increased luminosities of all three neutrino types ( @xmath38 , @xmath79 , and @xmath39 ) .",
    "x - ray observations of galaxies and galaxy clusters indicate a possible emission line at @xmath5 3.5 kev .",
    "there are two proposed explanations of this line : atomic emission from potassium or a decaying 7  kev sterile neutrino dark matter .",
    "the potassium lines near 3.5  kev are difficult to fit in the observed environments due to the uncertainties in the plasma temperature , backgrounds , and atomic abundances .",
    "many fits require a potassium abundance well in excess of the solar values .",
    "this seems unlikely in the observed environments .",
    "the observed x - ray emission may be due to decaying sterile neutrino dark matter .",
    "if this is the case , bounds can be placed on the sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle from the photon energy and observed flux .",
    "further observations are needed to confirm the presence of this line in additional dark matter dominated objects , such as dwarf spheroidal galaxies . * if this observation indeed corresponds to a 7 kev sterile neutrino , we find that the inferred mixing angle for a single sterile neutrino making up 100% of the dark matter would imply almost no observable effect on core collapse supernovae .",
    "however , if the 7 kev neutrino represents only a small ( @xmath73% ) of the total dark matter density , it will alter the supernova dynamics and observable luminosities .",
    "we note that such a neutrino is not ruled out by the constraints of figure [ fig : bounds ] . *",
    "thus , it remains possible that sterile neutrinos may play a part in a multi - component dark matter model , but further work is required to fully understand the observational signatures of such multi - component models .",
    "as far as the impact on the ccsn explosion is concerned , a multi - component model is required to accommodate a sterile neutrino mass and mixing angle that leads to an enhanced explosion .",
    "if the decaying sterile neutrino makes up ( @xmath73% ) of the dark matter density , a shorter decay lifetime is allowed corresponding to the larger mixing angle needed to impact the explosion .",
    "indeed , for oscillations between an electron neutrino and sterile neutrino , a large region of the sterile neutrino mass - mixing angle parameter space is allowed by these observations as long as the decaying sterile neutrino is a small fraction of the total dm density .",
    "the larger associated mixing angle then leads to an enhancement in the explosion energy of ccsne .",
    "this enhancement to the explosion energy is mainly due to the heating and expansion of the neutrinosphere , which results in the increased luminosities of all neutrino ( and antineutrino ) flavors .",
    "we have also considered @xmath74 oscillations . however , for this case we find that there is little effect on the explosion energy .",
    "this is because the forward scattering potential does not sufficiently drop below the neutrino chemical potential to induce significant mixing .    nevertheless , a small contribution to the total dark - matter density from kev mass neutrinos with a large mixing angle ( @xmath83 ) is especially promising when one considers the current state of the art of 2- and 3-dimensional core - collapse supernova simulations .",
    "most multidimensional models explode via a hydrodynamic instability such as sasi or neutrino - heated convection , but the explosion energies tend to be lower than that required by observations . based on studies to date ,",
    "if a sterile neutrino with a large mixing angle were included in a multidimensional model , its presence may be sufficient to enhance the explosion energy and thereby match observations .",
    "clearly , further work is merited to explore this possibility .",
