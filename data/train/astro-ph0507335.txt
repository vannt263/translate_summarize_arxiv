    "during a solar flare , large quantities of energy are transferred between the corona and chromosphere through thermal conduction , non - thermal particle beams , radiation transport and mass motions . any attempt to accurately model the optical and uv radiation produced during a flare must incorporate these methods of energy transfer .",
    "there has been considerable effort put into modeling the atmospheric response to heating from non - thermal particle beams . @xcite and @xcite derived an analytic expression describing electron energy deposition through coulomb collisions .",
    "this expression has been employed in a number of flare simulations @xcite . understanding how energy is transferred by mass motions and radiative transfer requires solving the equations of radiation hydrodynamics .",
    "many hydrodynamical simulations have focused on the upper atmosphere where emission is optically thin , and radiative transfer is relatively straightforward .",
    "notable investigations of this type are @xcite .",
    "however , we seek to model optical emission which originates in the chromosphere where radiation is neither optically thin nor in lte with the surrounding plasma .",
    "therefore , we must employ the full non - lte formulation of radiative transfer .",
    "the simulations of @xcite were among the first to model the radiative hydrodynamic response in a coronal loop to a beam of non - thermal electrons .",
    "however , their models were limited in that radiative transfer was solved using an escape probability method .",
    "the models of @xcite incorporated non - thermal beam heating into the radiative transfer code , multi @xcite .",
    "this had the advantage of efficiently solving the equation of radiative transfer , but did not include detailed hydrodynamics , and therefore could not simulate the effects of mass motions on the energy balance or on the line profiles .",
    "the models of @xcite ( hereafter , ah99 ) incorporated both hydrodynamics and radiative transfer , and are therefore well suited for understanding the optical emission produced during flares . in this paper",
    "we extend the models of ah99 by more accurately modeling the xeuv radiation and electron beam heating .    in section 2",
    "we describe the method by which the radiative hydrodynamic equations are solved .",
    "we also describe the procedure by which we generate the initial atmosphere and our new methods for incorporating soft x - ray and electron beam heating into the simulations . in section 3",
    "we discuss the dynamics of our simulations and present detailed line and continuum profiles .",
    "the limitations of these models and future improvements are described in section 4 , and in section 5 we present our conclusions .",
    "the basic method of solution is described in detail in ah99 and @xcite . here",
    "we briefly outline the procedure .",
    "the equations of hydrodynamics , population conservation and radiative transfer are solved simultaneously on a one - dimensional adaptive grid @xcite using the radyn code of @xcite .",
    "the code has been modified to include the effects of flare heating from a non - thermal electron beam , heating from high temperature soft x - ray , extreme ultraviolet and ultraviolet emission ( hereafter , we refer to these collectively as xeuv emission ) and optically thin cooling resulting from bremsstrahlung and collisionally excited metal transitions .",
    "hydrodynamic effects due to gravity , thermal conduction and compressional viscosity are included as described in ah99 .",
    "we have additionally modified the code to include the double power - law electron beam energy distributions recently observed in solar flares with the rhessi satellite @xcite .",
    "we incorporate the effects of xeuv heating from a large number of high temperature lines using results from the chianti @xcite and atomdb databases @xcite .",
    "we obtain the non - lte solution to the population equations for a six level with continuum hydrogen atom , nine level with continuum helium atom and six level with continuum ca ii atom using the technique of @xcite .",
    "the bound - bound and bound - free transitions which are calculated in detail are listed in tables  [ table : bb ]  &  [ table : bf ] .",
    "all lines are calculated assuming complete redistribution , but for the lyman transitions the effects of partial redistribution are approximated by truncating the line profiles at 10 doppler widths .",
    "other transitions are included as background opacity in lte .",
    "the opacities are computed from the uppsala package of @xcite .",
    "we include optically thin radiative cooling from bremsstrahlung and coronal metal transitions using emissivities from the atomdb database .",
    "the equations are solved on an adaptive grid using 191 grid points in depth , 5 in angle and up to 100 in frequency for each transition .",
    "we have found it necessary to employ an adaptive grid in order to resolve large shocks which propagate through the atmosphere .",
    "a magnetic flux tube is typically modeled as a semi - circular loop with footpoints embedded in the photosphere and apex in the corona . by symmetry",
    "we need only consider one leg of the loop which we take to be a cylinder of constant cross section . in this approximation",
    "the atmospheric height , @xmath2 , is the only spatial degree of freedom .",
    "we use the pf2 model of ah99 as the preflare atmosphere .",
    "the pf2 atmosphere was generated by adding a transition region and corona to the model atmosphere of @xcite .",
    "to resolve the steep gradients present in the transition region pf2 required 191 grid points .",
    "constant non - radiative quiescent heating was applied to grid zones with photospheric column mass ( i.e. column mass greater than 7.6 g @xmath3 ) to balance the energy losses in the photosphere .",
    "the upper boundary was set at @xmath4 km and held at @xmath5 k. with these boundary conditions and no external sources of heating , the atmosphere was allowed to relax to a state of hydrodynamic equilibrium .      in the standard flare reconnection model , electrons located near the loop apex",
    "are accelerated to high energies and travel downward through the atmosphere depositing energy and producing hard x - ray bremsstrahlung radiation .",
    "for the simulations presented here , we assume that the electron beam is the primary source of flare heating in the lower solar atmosphere .",
    "recently , @xcite analyzed hard x - ray spectra observed with rhessi to obtain the injected electron energy spectrum at 20 s intervals throughout the 23 july 2002 x - class solar flare .",
    "the injected electrons are found to have a double power law energy distribution of the form @xmath6 where @xmath7 is the electron energy flux that enters the magnetic loop ; @xmath8 is the cutoff energy below which the x - ray emission is assumed to be thermal ; and @xmath9 is the break energy where the distribution shifts from spectral index @xmath10 to @xmath11 . using equation  [ eqn : dpl ] we calculated the energy deposition rate as a function of column depth using the method of @xcite which assumes that the energetic particles are slowed and deposit their heat through coulomb interactions . to account for the changing partial ionization of hydrogen we have adopted the treatment of @xcite .",
    "the resulting heating rate as a function of column depth is , @xmath12 + \\right .",
    "\\nonumber \\\\ \\left .",
    "\\left ( \\frac{n^*(n)}{n^*_c } \\right)^{-\\frac{\\delta_u}{2 } } \\left ( \\frac{e_b}{e_c } \\right)^{\\delta_u-\\delta_l } b_{x_b } \\left ( \\frac{\\delta_u}{2},\\frac{1}{3 } \\right ) \\right\\}\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] where @xmath13 , @xmath14 , @xmath15 is the hydrogen ionization fraction , @xmath16 and @xmath17 are the coulomb logarithms defined in @xcite , and @xmath18 is the cosine of the pitch angle of the beam ; @xmath19 in our simulations .",
    "the quantity @xmath20 is the incomplete beta function for @xmath21 where @xmath22 is the maximum column depth penetration of a beam with cutoff energy @xmath8 .",
    "@xmath23 is defined similarly for @xmath9 .",
    "@xmath24 is the equivalent column depth in a fully ionized plasma defined by @xmath25 and @xmath26 is the cutoff depth in a fully ionized plasma .",
    "the parameters @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath7 , @xmath8 and @xmath9 are obtained by fitting the hard x - ray spectra observed during a flare to models for thick target bremsstrahlung as described in @xcite . in a future paper , we will use the time - dependent beam parameters they have obtained to simulate the 23 july 2002 solar flare . in this paper , we take @xmath10 , @xmath11 , @xmath8 , and @xmath9 to be constant with values of 3.0 , 4.0 , 37 kev and 105 kev , respectively , corresponding to the peak of the 23 july 2002 flare .    figure  [ fig : qe ] shows the initial energy deposition rate of the electron beam and compares it with the initial deposition rate from ah99 .",
    "ah99 used a single power law electron energy spectrum with a spectral index , @xmath27 , and a cutoff energy , @xmath28 kev .",
    "the lower spectral indices and the higher energy cutoff we employ result in energy deposition that extends deeper in the atmosphere and has a broader spatial extent .",
    "non - thermal electrons affect the atmosphere not only by energy deposition but also through direct collisional ionization .",
    "we estimate collisional ionization due to non - thermal electrons using the technique of @xcite .",
    "they find the non - thermal collisional ionization rate from the ground state to be @xmath29 where @xmath30 is the hydrogen number density and @xmath31 is the beam energy deposition rate due to collisions with neutral hydrogen and is related to the total energy deposition rate defined in equation  [ eqn : qe ] by @xmath32 .",
    "they also find that ionizations from the ground state dominate , so we neglect non - thermal collisional ionizations from excited states .      mass motions during flares raise the density in the transition region and corona which can greatly increase the emissivity of xeuv photons from these regions .",
    "the outward directed photons we detect as elevated emission , while the downward directed photons cause `` backwarming '' : heating of the lower atmosphere due to increased photoionizations .",
    "we have used the atomdb database to determine the thermal volume monochromatic emissivity as a function of wavelength and temperature .",
    "we include emissivities calculated for approximately 34,000 transitions at 37 temperature points ranging from @xmath4 k to @xmath33 k. the transitions have been gathered into 14 wavelength bins ranging from 1 @xmath34 to 2500 @xmath34 .",
    "table  [ table : xbins ] lists the range and emissivity - weighted central wavelengths of each bin . when calculating these emissivities , we have taken care not to include transitions that are already solved in detail in radyn ( cf .",
    "table  [ table : bb ] ) .",
    "since the xeuv emission produced in low - temperature , optically - thick layers is negligible , we assume that all such emission originates from the higher temperature , optically - thin layers .",
    "the xeuv flux incident on a layer with optical depth @xmath35 is given by , @xmath36 where @xmath37 is the source function , given by the ratio of the emissivity to the linear extinction coefficient .",
    "for layers close to the layer under consideration ( @xmath38 , where @xmath39 is the separation between layers and @xmath40 is the loop cross - sectional diameter ) , @xmath41 in the above integral is @xmath42 , the second exponential integral .",
    "however , in order to avoid overestimating the emission from distant layers ( @xmath43 ) we follow @xcite ; and ah99 in treating the distant layers as point sources . in that case @xmath41 is given by , @xmath44 where @xmath45 is defined in equation 10 of ah99 .",
    "the xeuv photons heat the lower atmosphere through photoionization . the average scale height of our model atmosphere is greater than the thermalization depth scale of @xcite ,",
    "so we assume that the energy of the photoionized electrons is transformed entirely to heat in each atmospheric layer .",
    "the volumetric heating rate is given by , @xmath46 d\\nu\\;,\\ ] ] where @xmath47 is the number density for ion @xmath48 , @xmath49 is the ionization potential , @xmath50 is the photoionization cross section , and the sum is over approximately 150 ions .",
    "the cross sections and number densities were obtained from the chianti database .",
    "our method for calculating the xeuv heating is similar to the soft x - ray heating of ah99 , but differs in the extent of the atomic transitions included .",
    "ah99 considered emission only between 1  and 250  divided into seven bins , while we include 14 bins in the range 1  to 2500  , i.e. including substantial euv and uv heating .",
    "for example , c  iii @xmath51977  , which was not included in ah99 , is a significant contributor in our backwarming calculations .",
    "figure  [ fig : compxray ] compares our xeuv heating rate with that of ah99 at a comparable time late in a moderate flare .",
    "our xeuv heating rate is approximately 10 times larger than the rate in ah99 .",
    "we carried out two flare simulations , corresponding to moderate beam heating with an electron flux , @xmath52 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath1 ( the f10 flare ) and strong beam heating , with @xmath53 ergs @xmath3 s@xmath1 ( the f11 flare ) .",
    "the f10 flare was evolved for 226 s and the f11 flare for 15 s. note that these simulations are comparable to the f10 and f11 flares in ah99 which evolved for 70 s and 4 s , respectively . in the following sections we discuss the dynamics and emission resulting from these two flare simulations .",
    "figure  [ fig : f10gen ] shows the evolution of the temperature and density stratification along with the electron beam energy deposition rate , the ionization fraction and the electron density during the f10 flare .",
    "initially the beam penetrates into the chromosphere to a depth of 0.89 mm above the solar surface ( defined as @xmath54 at @xmath55 ) .",
    "the upper chromosphere rapidly heats but plateaus at a temperature of about @xmath4 k after 0.3 s as a result of hydrogen radiative cooling ( see panel 2 of fig .",
    "[ fig : f10gen ] ) .",
    "the initial beam impact causes the pressure to increase and a strong wave begins to propagate upward .",
    "the dynamics proceed slowly for the next three seconds , as much of the incident beam energy is radiated away . by 3.0 s ,",
    "a significant fraction of the hydrogen in the region of beam energy deposition has been ionized and is no longer capable of radiating the beam energy , and so the temperature again quickly rises ( see the hydrogen ionization fraction in panel 11 of fig .",
    "[ fig : f10gen ] ) . over the next several seconds ,",
    "the increasing temperature causes he  i in the atmospheric range of 1.0 to 1.4 mm to become ionized to he  ii .",
    "the cooling increases through he recombination and the he  ii  @xmath51304 line , and the radiative cooling again balances the beam and xeuv heating .",
    "when this balance is reached , a relatively gentle phase of the evolution begins .",
    "meanwhile , the wave which resulted from the initial impact of the beam has been traveling through the atmosphere , bringing material from the chromosphere into the transition region and corona . by 50 s",
    "the initial wave has reached the top of the flux tube .",
    "material pushed by the wave has increased the apex density by a factor of three and raised the temperature to about 2 mk .",
    "the increased coronal density causes the transition region to become much more extended in height than in the preflare atmosphere ( panel 4 of figure  [ fig : f10gen ] ) .",
    "in addition , with elevated coronal density the atmosphere becomes more effective at stopping the beam , which therefore deposits its energy progressively higher in the atmosphere .",
    "column 4 of figure  [ fig : f10gen ] ( panels 4 , 8 , 12 ) illustrates these effects at a representative time during the gentle phase .",
    "after f10 has evolved for about 73 s , most of the he  ii in the range of 2.0 to 2.3 mm has been ionized , and the radiative cooling again decreases below the flare heating .",
    "this is illustrated in the first column of figure  [ fig : f10exp ] .",
    "an explosive increase in temperature results and creates a supersonic wave which pushes material away from its front and forms a lower density ( though still much higher than the preflare density ) high temperature bubble .",
    "the second column of figure  [ fig : f10exp ] ( panels 2 , 6 , 10 ) shows these effects at 85 s. meanwhile , more material has been evaporated into the corona and the loop apex density has increased approximately an order of magnitude over the preflare density ( panel 10 ) . for the next 150 s the bubble expands as the explosive wave propagates through the atmosphere , until the wave reaches the boundary of the flux tube .",
    "the atmosphere attains a steady state , with a hotter , denser corona , and a transition region that is closer in height to the photosphere than in the preflare atmosphere ( panels 4 , 8 , 12 ) .",
    "the final apex temperature is 5.2 mk , the electron density is @xmath56 @xmath57 , and the mass density has increased by a factor of 70 reaching @xmath58 g @xmath57 .",
    "this temperature and density are somewhat lower than coronal values often observed for m - class flares .",
    "although the xeuv heating rate would be larger from an even hotter , denser corona , it would still be much smaller than the beam heating ( see below ) , and therefore our predictions of the optical and uv emission from the lower atmosphere are not affected .",
    "for example , an atmosphere with an apex temperature of 20 mk and electron density of @xmath59 @xmath57 gives an xeuv heating rate which is five times larger than ours , but still 50 times smaller than the beam heating rate .",
    "a major difference between the models presented here and those of ah99 is the time at which the explosive phase begins .",
    "the explosive phase of the f10 model of ah99 begins after about 27 s of impulsive heating compared to 73 s for our f10 model .",
    "the reason is that the lower spectral indices we employ result in broader electron beam energy deposition . with less concentrated heating",
    ", the atmosphere takes longer to ionize resulting in a longer delay before the onset of the explosive phase .",
    "the initial evolution of the f11 flare is similar to f10 but proceeds much faster .",
    "figure  [ fig : f11atmos ] shows the atmosphere at several times during this flare .",
    "the beam rapidly heats the atmosphere in the region of impact to about 13,000 k , but plateaus after 0.04 s because hydrogen radiative cooling balances the beam heating . as in the f10 ,",
    "case a high velocity wave begins to propagate upward from the initial beam impact . by 0.18",
    "s , most of the hydrogen is ionized and the atmosphere again rapidly heats , but plateaus at just over 50,000 k as a result of he  ii radiative cooling ( first column of fig .",
    "[ fig : f11atmos ] ) . by 1.0",
    "s , helium is completely ionized and the radiative cooling is insufficient to balance the beam heating , causing the atmosphere to explosively heat ( second column of fig .",
    "[ fig : f11atmos ] ) . a high - temperature , low - density bubble forms in a fashion similar to the f10 flare , but at a location much lower in the atmosphere than in the f10 case . since the atmosphere heats so much more quickly in the f11 flare , the initial wave resulting from beam impact has not had time to evaporate much material into the corona .",
    "therefore , the beam is still depositing most of its energy in the lower chromosphere when the explosive phase starts .",
    "the explosive bubble forms at about 1 mm ( panel 2 of fig .",
    "[ fig : f11atmos ] ) . a supersonic wave forms as a result of the explosion ,",
    "and it is this wave which is primarily responsible for depositing chromospheric material into the corona , in contrast to the f10 case where the material was carried primarily by the initial wave .",
    "it is likely that for flares larger than f11 , the onset of the explosive phase will be extremely fast ( i.e. hydrogen and helium will be ionized almost immediately ) .",
    "for very large flares , the explosive phase will essentially begin simultaneously with the beam heating , with no observable lag .",
    "@xcite speculated that xeuv emission could provide significant heating below the temperature minimum region , which might explain the increased continuum emission produced in white light flares .",
    "however , in both f10 and f11 , we find that the xeuv heating does not penetrate more deeply than the electron beam , nor does it contribute significantly to the energy deposition rate . despite an order of magnitude more heating than in ah99 , xeuv heating accounts for less than 1% of the total energy deposited in the f10 flare and about 7% in the f11 flare .",
    "as material evaporates from the chromosphere into higher temperature regions , many emission lines brighten dramatically .",
    "light curves showing these increases in flux during the f10 flare are plotted in figure  [ fig : lc ] .",
    "ly@xmath60 quickly brightens as lower chromospheric material is heated to @xmath025,000 k. by 30  s , much of the plasma in the lower transition region has been further heated and ly@xmath60 emission slowly begins to decrease .",
    "the he  ii @xmath51304 line continually grows from the beginning of the flare as progressively more material is heated to its temperature of formation ( @xmath050,000 k ) until the onset of the explosive phase .",
    "after the explosive phase begins , the expansion of the high temperature bubble ionizes most of the he  ii , and the intensity of he  ii @xmath51304 decreases ( see panels 2 and 3 of figure  [ fig : f10exp ] ) . at the onset of the explosive phase a downward moving `` condensation '' wave is created and raises the plasma density in the lower transition region resulting in another increase in ly@xmath60 emission .",
    "the peak occurring at 112 s is due to emission from the high density , lower temperature boundary of the expanding bubble ( see panel 3 of figure  [ fig : f10exp ] ) , and the sharp decrease in intensity occurring at 185 s is the result of the bubble passing through the boundary of the flux tube .",
    "ii k does not respond to the explosive phase until the condensation begins to increase the chromospheric density at about 115 s. at 166  s , a large , downward - moving wave passes into the lower chromosphere increasing the density and causing ca  ii k to brighten ( compare the location of the transition region in panels 3 and 4 of figure  [ fig : f10exp ] ) .",
    "figure  [ fig : f11lc ] shows light curves for the same emission lines during the f11 flare . as in f10 , the lines rapidly brighten in response to the flare heating .",
    "after 0.5 s , the region of beam impact has been heated past 40,000 k , and the rate of intensity increase slows for ly@xmath60 and h@xmath60 . at 2.5",
    "s , the explosive bubble begins to move to areas of lower density and the ly@xmath60 and he  ii  @xmath51304 intensities slowly decrease . at 5.5",
    "s , a condensation front passes into the lower chromosphere , increasing the density and causing ca  ii k to brighten .",
    "mass motions during the flare cause significant doppler shifts and introduce large asymmetries in the line profiles .",
    "figure  [ fig : lprofs ] shows profiles for the same emission lines , at successive times during f10 . in panels 2",
    " 4 , the red wing of ly@xmath60 is strongly enhanced .",
    "panels 7  9 show h@xmath60 to be weakly red shifted ( average doppler shift of 2 km s@xmath1 ) .",
    "these indicate chromospheric condensation ( mass motion downward toward the photosphere ) .",
    "however , the line center of he  ii @xmath51304 shows the opposite effect ( central reversal in panel 13 ) , with a blue shift exhibiting chromospheric evaporation .",
    "the line center of he  ii @xmath51304 is formed higher in the atmosphere  where the velocity field is stronger  than the other lines shown and exhibits a peak upward velocity of @xmath0120 km s@xmath1 .",
    "a similar blue shift has been observed in several solar flares ( * ? ? ?",
    "* ; * ? ? ?",
    "* and references therein ) . in particular , @xcite observed a velocity of @xmath0140 km s@xmath1 early in the impulsive phase of a moderate flare using an o  iii line which forms at a similar temperature to he  ii @xmath51304 .",
    "figure  [ fig : f11profs ] shows similar plots for line emission during the f11 flare . at 0.3 s",
    "both h@xmath60 and ca  ii k have switched from absorption to emission profiles , but neither ly@xmath60 nor he  ii @xmath51304 has significantly brightened . however , by 1.0 s the intensity of all these lines has markedly increased . in panel 10 , he  ii @xmath51304 has a blue shift corresponding to a velocity of @xmath0 60 km s@xmath1 . at 6.0",
    "s there are red shifts present in ca  ii k and h@xmath60 indicating motion towards the photosphere .",
    "the region of h@xmath60 formation reaches a peak downward velocity of about 40 km s@xmath1 which is consistent with velocities reported by @xcite .",
    "the profiles of ly@xmath60 and he  ii @xmath51304 are very asymmetrical since they are formed in regions with both strong upward and downward directed waves .",
    "it is , therefore , not possible to determine a single velocity from these profiles . in the last column ,",
    "ly@xmath60 and he  ii  @xmath51304 show enhanced blue wings , but the ca  ii  k line is red - shifted indicating a downward - moving wave in the lower chromosphere and an upward - directed wave in the upper chromosphere and transition region",
    ".    clearly , the detailed line profiles in the simulations depend strongly on the flare dynamics and evolve significantly during the flare . to interpret the line profiles ,",
    "we follow @xcite and write the formal solution of the transfer equation for the emergent intensity as @xmath61 where @xmath62 is the linear extinction coefficient , defined as the product of the density of emitting particles with their cross section .",
    "the integrand in this equation is known as the contribution function and indicates how much emission originates from a height , @xmath2 .",
    "we divide the contribution function into three physically meaningful terms : @xmath63 is large where there are many emitting particles at small optical depth , which is a situation that often arises in the presence of strong velocity gradients .",

    "is independent of frequency due to the assumption of complete redistribution .",

    "the source function is small resulting in a smaller contribution function and less emission .",
    "the he  ii @xmath51304 line is formed in the transition region and is made complicated by the strong velocity gradients occurring there . in the lower chromosphere the velocity field is much smaller . as an example of emission resulting from this region",
    ", we consider , in figure  [ fig : cfcaii ] , the contribution function for ca  ii  k at 130 s after the start of the f10 flare . for line center ,",
    "@xmath66 at a height of about 1.5 mm . in this region @xmath63 and @xmath37 are also at their maximums indicating that most of the emission originates from this region .",
    "the wings are formed in the region of @xmath68 mm where @xmath69 is at a maximum .",
    "however , the source function and @xmath63 are smaller than at line center , so there is less emission in the wings .",

    "figure  [ fig : f11cfcaii ] shows the ca  ii  k contribution function at 11.0 s after the start of f11 .",
    "most of the emission originates from an area with a strong downward directed condensation wave .",
    "comparison of this figure with figure  [ fig : cfcaii ] reveals that ca  ii  k is formed deeper and in a narrower region in f11 than in f10 , with a majority of the emission coming from a height of 0.78 mm . during the f11 explosive phase",
    "the beam energy is deposited at lower height than in f10 .",
    "this has the effect of pushing the transition region to lower heights and compressing the chromosphere relative to f10 .",
    "observations of solar white light flares show enhanced optical continuum emission that is temporally correlated with the impulsive phase of the flare @xcite .",
    "our flare simulations also show dramatically increased continuum emission including the enhanced balmer and paschen jumps which are ubiquitous in type i white light flares @xcite .",
    "figures  [ fig : clc ] and [ fig : f11clc ] show continuum light curves for four spectral regions during f10 and f11 respectively .",
    "the lyman continuum is very enhanced , reaching thousands of times its preflare value .",
    "this compares well with the increased lyman continuum observed in an x - class solar flare by @xcite .",
    "since the preflare intensity is much higher in the optical region , the relative increase of optical emission is moderate . at 5000 ",
    "the optical continuum reaches a peak increase of about 5% for f10 and 30% for f11 .",
    "this result is very similar to observations .",

    "[ fig : clc ] ) .",
    "this is discussed in ah99 , and is due to the non - thermal ionization resulting from the electron beam .",
    "the beam raises collisional rates in the upper chromosphere causing a higher population density of excited states of hydrogen .",
    "this increases the probability that balmer and higher order hydrogen continuum photons , which previously would have escaped , are absorbed , and results in a decrease in the continuum intensity .",
    "it is interesting to compare the total fluxes in the lines and continua , as shown in figure  [ fig : linecont ] .",
    "the beam and xeuv heating is also indicated . despite differences in dynamics and duration , in both the f10 and f11",
    "flares the continuum carries 78% of the total radiation and the lines carry the remaining 22% .",
    "as has been noted , these models differ from those of ah99 by including more realistic electron beam heating and greatly increased xeuv heating .",
    "this leads to a number of observational differences .",
    "our electron beam penetrates deeper ( see fig .  [",
    "fig : qe ] ) and more directly heats the lower atmosphere .",
    "this results in a larger emitting region for the hydrogen balmer lines ( compare fig .",
    "[ fig : f10gen ] with fig .  3 of ah99 ) and more intense balmer emission .",
    "this is especially important for the balmer continuum , which is responsible for radiative backwarming below the temperature minimum region , where white light continuum emission is produced @xcite .",
    "since our models have more intense balmer continuum , they produce more backwarming , a hotter flaring photosphere , and more intense white light emission than the models of ah99 .",
    "for the f11 flare , ah99 found a 4% increase in white light emission , compared to the 30% increase we obtain in our f11 model .",
    "another difference between our models and ah99 is the amount of he  ii  @xmath51304 emission .",
    "our spatially extended beam deposition produces a pronounced helium - emitting plateau in the transition region during f11 , and results in an order of magnitude brightening of the he  ii  @xmath51304 line compared to ah99 .    despite the brighter emission in our simulations , the velocities and many line profiles are similar to those found in ah99 .",
    "for example , in the f11 flare ah99 obtain a downward chromospheric condensation velocity of @xmath72 km s@xmath1 , which is comparable to our result . also , the  k line profile at 73 s in our f10 flare ( panel 18 of fig .  [ fig : lprofs ] ) is very similar to the profile calculated at 30  s in the f10 model of ah99 ( panel 6 of fig .",
    "14 of ah99 ) .",
    "as noted earlier our simulations evolve more slowly than those of ah99 , so these line profiles occur near the beginning of the explosive phase in each simulation .",
    "we have created detailed models of the radiation and dynamics occurring during a moderate and a strong solar flare and have taken considerable effort to make them as accurate as possible . however , there are a number of limitations to these models .",
    "the atmosphere is assumed to be one - dimensional , plane - parallel and aligned with the magnetic field . in assuming a one - dimensional atmosphere , the possibility that radiation can escape the flux tube through the sides is neglected .",
    "the assumption of a circular loop geometry neglects the more tapered structure of true magnetic field loops and will affect the calculation of the thermal xeuv heating .",
    "ions and electrons are assumed to have the same temperature .",
    "we also have assumed complete redistribution in calculating all transitions , and we have implicitly assumed that the gas pressure is lower than the magnetic pressure so that the gas is confined to the flux tube and mhd effects can be neglected .",
    "we are in the process of making a number of improvements to the models .",
    "the models shown in this paper represent a `` general '' flare , i.e. the electron beam parameters are assumed to remain constant throughout the flare .",
    "rhessi hard x - ray spectral observations have sufficient time resolution to see temporal variations in the electron beam on the order of a few seconds allowing the evolving electron beam parameters to be inferred .",
    "thus , simulations of specific flares may be constructed , and the calculated emission profiles can be directly compared to observations of lines and continua for that specific flare .",
    "a forthcoming paper will present results for a simulation of the large x - class 23 july 2002 solar flare .",
    "we have constructed radiative hydrodynamic simulations of the flaring solar atmosphere and have used them to explore the flare - induced optical and uv emission .",
    "these models extend the work presented in ah99 by using more realistic electron beam deposition rates and by incorporating backwarming from a large number of xeuv lines . as in ah99 , we find that the impulsive flare naturally divides into two phases , an initial gentle phase followed by a period of explosive increases in temperature and pressure .",
    "the explosive wave front creates a high temperature `` bubble . ''",
    "the bubble expands until the wave passes through the boundary of the flux tube , at which point the atmosphere attains a steady state with a hotter corona and deeper transition region than in the preflare atmosphere .",
    "both moderate and strong flares show large increases in line and continuum emission . as chromospheric material",
    "is heated to transition region temperatures , the he  ii  @xmath51304 line is especially enhanced reaching values of many thousands of times its preflare level .",
    "the optical continuum also brightens showing a peak enhancement of 5% for f10 ( comparable to observed enhancements ) and 30% for f11 .",
    "the continuum dominates the emitted radiation , carrying 78% of the total emission for both f10 and f11 .",
    "chromospheric evaporation causes blue - shifts in transition region lines corresponding to a peak velocity of @xmath73 km s@xmath1 .",
    "chromospheric condensation increases the density in the chromosphere causing ca  ii  k and h@xmath60 to significantly brighten and resulting in an h@xmath60 red shift of @xmath72 km s@xmath1 .",
    "we incorporated the large number of transitions in the atomdb database to more accurately model xeuv backwarming of the lower atmosphere .",
    "we find that the xeuv heating is an order of magnitude larger than the soft x - ray heating of ah99 .",
    "nevertheless , the level of heating is still too small to significantly contribute to the flare dynamics . by comparing these models with those in ah99 we find that heating from a more realistic electron energy distribution leads to slower flare evolution , and more intense brightening of emission lines and continua .",
    "the larger balmer continuum present in our simulations is especially important because it radiatively backwarms the lower solar atmosphere , enhanced white light emission .",
    "this work has been partially funded by nsf grant ast02 - 05875 and hst grants ar-10312 and go-8613 .",
    "the computations presented here were carried out on the astronomy condor network at the university of washington , and we would especially like to thank john bochanski for contributing many hours of computer time .",
