    "although non - relativistic quantum mechanics is a well understood theory , about two decades ago a question arose which is still not completely answered . we know that chaos in classical mechanics is due to nonlinear terms in the equations of motion",
    "the schrdinger equation is linear , so there should be no quantum chaos .",
    "but classical mechanics is supposed to be some limit of quantum mechanics , so what is the equivalent of chaos in quantum mechanics ? by now quite some theory has been developed to answer that question@xcite .",
    "the presence of chaos can be seen in the spectrum of the hamiltonian and its statistical properties . on varying a parameter  @xmath2 of the system , two levels could approach one another . in an integrable system",
    ", they will continue to approach and cross when @xmath2 is changed further , but in nonintegrable systems , the levels will avoid crossing : they repel .",
    "much research is being done on this topic of quantum chaos@xcite .",
    "the assumptions underlying these ( and other ) predictions are not linked rigorously to the integrable and nonintegrable nature although in most cases they seem to hold .",
    "usually , one investigates chaotic systems and determines the statistical properties of the spectrum .",
    "seldom an integrable system is considered , even though such systems are not as trivial as one might expect .    in this article",
    "we look at the elliptic quantum billiard . this billiard",
    "is often taken as a reference system to some nonintegrable variants@xcite , and its integrability is taken for granted . an extensive semiclassical survey , as well as numerical solutions to the exact eigenvalue problem , can be found in @xcite .",
    "we take a closer look at the subtleties of the integrability of this billiard",
    ". the existence of the second conserved quantity will be investigated in a limiting scheme , involving a larger class of separable systems .",
    "level crossing will be investigated and two statistical properties of the spectrum , namely the distribution of level spacings @xmath0 and the rigidity @xmath1 @xcite are used to establish whether the system is integrable .",
    "the elliptic billiard is defined as a particle moving in a two dimensional potential well with an elliptic boundary .",
    "classically , this system has a second constant of motion : the product of the angular momentum @xmath3 with respect to one focal point and the angular momentum @xmath4 with respect to the other focal point@xcite .",
    "this quantity has the same value before and after a collision of the particle with the wall , as well , of course , as during its rectilinear motion .",
    "this means that the system is integrable , but there are some subtle points that have not been noticed in the literature .",
    "we formulate the problem in elliptic coordinates : @xmath5 so that the focal points are at @xmath6 and @xmath7 . the limit",
    "to circular coordinates can be obtained by putting @xmath8 , and letting @xmath9 tend to zero while @xmath10 remains finite . defining @xmath11 @xmath12 and",
    "@xmath13 take the form @xmath14 and @xmath15 where @xmath16 and @xmath17 .",
    "the potential @xmath18 for the billiard is zero for @xmath19 and infinite for @xmath20 .",
    "the eccentricity of the elliptic boundary is @xmath21 . for a conserved quantity ,",
    "the commutator with @xmath22 should be zero .",
    "the commutator of @xmath12 and @xmath23 is @xmath24    & = & -\\frac{\\hbar\\sin^2\\theta}{m(z,\\theta ) } ( \\hbar{\\partial^2_{z}{v } } + 2i\\:p_{z } { \\partial_{z}{v } } ) \\\\   & &   +   \\frac{\\hbar \\sinh^2 z}{m(z,\\theta ) } ( \\hbar { \\partial^2_{\\theta}{v } }        + 2i\\:p_{\\theta } { \\partial_{\\theta}{v}}).\\end{aligned}\\ ] ] in our billiard , @xmath25 at the boundary , making the expression ill - defined .",
    "the problem is that @xmath23 is not properly defined on the hilbert space of functions that are zero on the elliptic boundary .",
    "the result is that we can not tell whether @xmath23 is conserved or not . in an article by ayant and arvieu@xcite a few of the lowest eigenvalues of @xmath12",
    "are calculated and plotted as a function of the eccentricity , and repelling levels are seen  a sign of nonintegrability .",
    "this raised some confusion about the integrability , but traiber_et al_@xcite have shown numerically that these repulsions are actually crossings .",
    "they admit , however , that the crossings they find have not been established rigorously .",
    "the eigenvalue - problem of @xmath12 is separable in elliptic coordinates .",
    "if we substitute @xmath26@xmath27 into the time independent schrdinger equation @xmath28 with the dirichlet boundary condition @xmath29 , we get @xmath30 in which @xmath31 is a separation constant . because @xmath31 and @xmath32 appear in both equations the eigenvalue problem is not easily soluble ( it also raises computational problems@xcite ) .",
    "these equations are called the mathieu equation and the modified mathieu equation , respectively .",
    "their solutions are mathieu functions@xcite . due to symmetry",
    ", we can restrict ourselves to one quadrant , imposing dirichlet or neuman boundary conditions on the @xmath33-axis and the @xmath34-axis .",
    "this gives the standard four classes of solutions .",
    "the conditions for @xmath35 at @xmath36 and for @xmath37 at @xmath38 are both the same as the boundary condition on the @xmath33-axis .",
    "the condition for @xmath35 at @xmath39 is the boundary condition on the @xmath34-axis .",
    "furthermore @xmath37 should satisfy the dirichlet condition at @xmath40 .",
    "if we fix @xmath32 , there exist countable many values of @xmath31 for which equation ( [ eq : mat1 ] ) has a solution .",
    "solutions satisfying neuman ( dirichlet ) conditions at @xmath36 are called @xmath41 ( @xmath42 ) .",
    "the index @xmath43 runs from zero to infinity .",
    "if @xmath43 is even , the solution satisfies the neuman condition at @xmath39 .",
    "if it is odd , the dirichlet condition is satisfied .",
    "we have an ill - defined commutator . to be able to define it ,",
    "it is necessary to use a smooth potential .",
    "we start by making an ansatz for a conserved quantity @xmath44 in the classical system of the form @xmath45 .",
    "we demand that @xmath46 be zero for all @xmath47 . from @xmath48",
    "we find that @xmath49 has to be of the special form @xmath50 this is the class of separable systems@xcite of which the elliptic billiard is a limiting case .",
    "@xmath51 is given by @xmath52 it can be shown that @xmath53=0 $ ] . in the limit of the elliptic billiard , @xmath54 and @xmath55",
    "is taken to be zero inside the ellipse and infinite outside .",
    "then @xmath51 is equal to @xmath49 and will give the same boundary conditions for @xmath23 as we had for @xmath12 . in this way",
    "@xmath23 will be an operator on the correct hilbert space , on which we can consider @xmath23 to be conserved .",
    "the eigenvalue problem of @xmath23 is equivalent to that of @xmath22 : we end up with the same equations ( [ eq : mat1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mmat1 ] ) .",
    "the eigenvalues of @xmath23 are given by @xmath56 .",
    "this equivalence also means that @xmath23 is of no help to find the general solution .",
    "there are only four types of billiards in two dimensions which have a second constant of motion which is quadratic in the momenta@xcite and have non - complex hamiltonians .",
    "they correspond to rectangles , circles , ellipses and parabolae . the parabolic billiard , which has a boundary composed of two opposite parabolae with the same focal point , also has the subtleties of coupled separated equations like the equations ( [ eq : mat1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mmat1 ] ) and an ill - defined commutator of a classically conserved quantity with the hamiltonian , which can also be fixed in a limiting procedure .",
    "it is possible to use the separability of the system to explain why crossings occur . for",
    "that we need to view equation ( [ eq : mat1 ] ) as an eigenvalue problem , with @xmath31 the eigenvalue , and @xmath32 some parameter .",
    "this boundary value problem is of the sturm - liouville type , so the spectrum contains an infinite , countable number of only simple eigenvalues bounded from below@xcite .",
    "we denote these eigenvalues by @xmath57 , where @xmath43 is the same index as in section  [ sub : billiard ] and @xmath32 indicates the dependence of the eigenvalue on the parameter @xmath32 . from the simplicity of the eigenvalues",
    "it follows that they depend at least piecewise continuously on @xmath32 .",
    "overall continuity can be deduced by performing a small rotation @xmath58 in equation ( [ eq : mat1 ] ) with @xmath59 a rotation over an arbitrary but small enough angle @xmath60 .",
    "this gives again a sturm - liouville problem , so in the rotated frame , @xmath61 has to be piecewise continuous too , and @xmath57 can not be discontinuous .",
    "equation ( [ eq : mmat1 ] ) can also be seen as an eigenvalue problem of the sturm - liouville type , but with @xmath32 as the eigenvalue and @xmath31 as the parameter .",
    "we denote the eigenvalues of this problem with @xmath62 , where the index @xmath10 runs from one to infinity .",
    "the @xmath62 can also be seen to be continuous .",
    "we can consider the graphs of the eigenvalues @xmath57 as a set of lines in the @xmath63-plane that do not intersect and we call those the @xmath31-curves .",
    "the same picture can be used for the graphs of @xmath62 , which are the @xmath32-curves . since the values of @xmath32 and @xmath31 in the two equations have to agree , a solution to the problem exists for every intersection point of the two sets of curves .",
    "the values of @xmath43 and @xmath10 can be considered the quantum numbers of that solution .",
    "we determined some of the lower ones of these so - called characteristic curves numerically , using a discretization of equations ( [ eq : mat1 ] ) and ( [ eq : mmat1 ] ) and applying the ql - algorithm on the resulting tri - diagonal matrices@xcite . for equation ( [ eq : mmat1 ] ) we took the boundary at @xmath64 , corresponding to an eccentricity @xmath2 of @xmath65 .",
    "the results are plotted in figure  1 .",
    "the eigenvalue of the hamiltonian is proportional to the @xmath32-value , i.e. the projection of the intersections of the @xmath31- and @xmath32-curves on the @xmath32-axis .",
    "if two points are close together in projection on the @xmath32-axis , this does not mean that they are close in the @xmath63-plane .",
    "when @xmath2 is changed , the @xmath32-curves shift and the intersection points move .",
    "the projections of two points can move towards each other , but that does not in general correspond to approaching points or any other special case in the @xmath63-plane , so they will continue to move in the same direction when @xmath2 is changed further . thus they will cross .",
    "we can now understand the different results of ayant and arvieu@xcite and traiber_et al_@xcite .",
    "traiber_et al_@xcite have used an algorithm which enables them to calculate the @xmath31 value for given @xmath32 numerically , which are in effect the @xmath31-curves . via a kind of newton - raphson procedure",
    "they find the eigenvalues @xmath32 of the modified mathieu equation . from the above discussion",
    ", it is no surprise that in their figure the levels cross .",
    "ayant and arvieu@xcite did not obtain the eigenvalues one by one .",
    "they choose a basis of the hilbert space to turn the eigenvalue problem for @xmath12 into that of a matrix .",
    "truncation of this matrix gives a finite one , of which the eigenvalues can be calculated numerically .",
    "due to roundoff errors , a diagonalization routine can gives spurious repulsions .",
    "ayant and arvieu@xcite do not say what kind of diagonalization method they used .",
    "as is shown in figure  2 , using a method that can handle degeneracies ( first applying the householder method to get a tri - diagonal matrix , then applying the @xmath66-algorithm @xcite ) , one finds the correct crossings that were also found by traiber_et al_@xcite in a different way .",
    "the matrix size was 98@xmath6798 and @xmath68 .",
    "according to current theory@xcite , random matrix theory can be used for nonintegrable systems .",
    "one finds that @xmath69 and that @xmath1 grows logarithmically with @xmath70 in the ` gaussian orthogonal ensemble ' .",
    "the fact that @xmath71 is a sign of level repulsion . for integrable systems",
    "one expects that @xmath72 , which is the distribution of level spacings in the case where the levels are poissonian distributed , and that @xmath1 grows as @xmath73 , for nondegenerate levels , up to a saturation point beyond which @xmath1 remains constant@xcite .",
    "a reliable calculation of @xmath0 and @xmath1 requires many energy levels .",
    "we will use an asymptotic approach to calculate the high energy eigenvalues .",
    "we follow the horn - jeffreys method as in mclachlan@xcite and arscott@xcite .",
    "we write @xmath74 as an asymptotic expansion in powers of @xmath75 : @xmath76 the asymptotic form of the mathieu equation can be written as the equation for the harmonic oscillator , hence the integer constant @xmath43 .",

    "only the terms up to @xmath82 are included to find eigenvalues .",
    "the spectrum that is found is equivalent to a two dimensional harmonic oscillator .",
    "berryand tabor@xcite have calculated @xmath0 for this system .",
    "for some ratios of the frequencies , @xmath0 is not defined . for other ratios",

    "they also showed that @xmath0 can approach @xmath83 again when the system is perturbed . including @xmath84 could have the same effect . from equation ( [ eq : freccur ] )",

    "the modified mathieu equation ( [ eq : mmat1 ] ) can be found from the standard mathieu equation ( [ eq : mat1 ] ) by substitution of @xmath95 for @xmath92 .",

    "corresponding to the circle , it is not a good approximation .",

    "the lowest order eigenvalues , given by the first two terms in ( [ eq : nextorder ] ) form a set of lines in the @xmath113-plane , one line for every pair @xmath114 .",
    "lines with equal @xmath43 but different @xmath10 are shifted in the @xmath79 direction by a multiple of @xmath115 , which is not zero except at @xmath112 , so they will never cross for @xmath116 . but lines with different @xmath43 do cross , at least in lowest order . the correction term in equation ( [ eq : nextorder ] )",
    "can be seen to be at most @xmath117 .",
    "this determines a band in the @xmath118-plane to which the lines are certainly confined .",
    "if the lines remain continuous when all orders are taken into account , then they have to intersect in some point in the area where these bands overlap .",
    "if @xmath79 is determined by @xmath119 , the implicit function theorem states that @xmath120 is continuous provided that @xmath121 .",
    "one easily checks that for equation ( [ eq : nextorder ] ) this is the case , so the solution is continuous and crossing is inevitable .",
    "we solved equation ( [ eq : nextorder ] ) numerically , for about 15000 levels of the @xmath93-type , for even @xmath43 .",
    "we took the 10000 largest of those to compute @xmath0 and @xmath1 .",
    "for the unfolding of the spectrum@xcite we took for the accumulated level density @xmath122 which follows from the eigenvalues calculated to lowest order .",
    "the results are shown in figure  3 for eccentricity @xmath123 .",
    "we see the expected behavior for integrable systems .",
    "the graphs look roughly alike for all other values of @xmath2 , although for some values of the eccentricity , the first correction term in equation ( [ eq : nextorder ] ) can not totally restore the @xmath83 behavior , namely when @xmath124 is a rational number @xmath125 , which is at @xmath126 . this is most pronounced for ratios @xmath127 of @xmath128 , @xmath129 and @xmath130 .",
    "it is possible to define a second constant of motion for the elliptic billiard , but only as a limiting case and the boundary has to be included into this quantity .",
    "separability does not mean we can solve the system but it does provide a geometric picture in which the energy eigenvalues are projection of intersections of characteristic curves . as the curves change continuously",
    "when the eccentricity is varied , the energy levels will cross generically .",
    "the level repulsions found in ayant and arvieu@xcite were not correct , due to the diagonalization method used .",
    "traiber_et al_@xcite effectively used the characteristic curves , therefore the crossing levels that we expect were found .",
    "the separability also allows for an asymptotic method to obtain the spectrum , which indeed gives results which are characteristic for integrable systems .",
    "so the elliptic billiard turns out to be an ordinary integrable system , despite the subtleties in the formalism .",
