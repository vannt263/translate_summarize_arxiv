    "generation of powerful photon beams in different frequency ranges due to its wide field of applications in physics and other science disciplines such as biology , chemistry , material science , etc .",
    "is one of the biggest challenges in modern physics . for that purpose alongside with the traditional lasers so - called free - electron lasers ( fel ) are also being widely used due to their well known features such us tunability on every required wavelength . the idea to use fels to generate powerful photon beams @xcite was first realized in amplification regime during the experiment @xcite and in generation regime during the experiment @xcite .",
    "photon beam with 109  nm wavelength was generated at tesla test facility for free - electron laser experiments ( ttf fel ) at desy using electron bunch with 233 mev energy and operating on self - amplified spontaneous emission ( sase ) @xcite .",
    "photon beam with a 1.5  wavelength was generated using 13.6 gev energy electron bunch of the stanford linear accelerator center s linac coherent light source x - ray fel ( slac lcls xfel ) again using sase @xcite .    even though modern fels solve the problems posted in front of them , they are still very big and expansive devices .",
    "the reason is that to create necessary for the applications short wavelengths one must either put the undulator magnets close enough to each other , which still is a big practical challenge , or to use high - energy electron bunches ( see , for example , @xcite or @xcite ) .    as a result",
    "we have fels with very big sizes and very high maintenance costs .",
    "of course there are steps towards the development of fel which will be compact in its sizes and will operate with low - energy electron bunches . as an example one can mention the letter @xcite , where the authors propose a fel which is based on the higher harmonics of the spontaneous radiation of the 3.5 gev energy electron bunch in fel oscillator .",
    "in this paper we announce about the possibility of an efficient ( i.e. cheap and compact compared with the existing ones ) fel based on an undulator with randomly varying spatial period which is in order of several micrometers .",
    "hereafter we will refer to such an undulator as `` irregular microundulator '' .",
    "one can imagine the irregular microundulator as a set of charged needles placed parallel to each other with random distances between two adjacent needles in order of few micrometers .",
    "the electron bunch , being shot in direction perpendicular to the needles into the inter - needle space , will be repealed by the charged needles and perform an irregular undulatory motion .",
    "we will show that the practical realization of such a microundulator will allow to construct significantly cheap and compact fel .    in the past the problem of electron radiation moving along irregular periodic paths",
    "was solved in the work @xcite , where the radiation from non - relativistic electrons conditioned by the interactions with randomly distributed roughness of the metallic surface was considered .",
    "a smith - purcell type radiation @xcite spectrum was obtained which allowed to explain the anomalously high intensity in the transition radiation experiments @xcite from non - relativistic electrons grazing into metallic surfaces .",
    "in this problem one should choose the mean transversal distance between adjacent needles to be in order of magnitude of the mean distance between electrons in the bunch .",
    "the longitudinal distance should be chosen from the requirement to obtain photon beam with the given wavelength .",
    "the needles should be many times longer than the transversal size of the bunch .",
    "in such a microundulator bunch electrons propagating in @xmath0 direction , being repealed from the charged needles will oscillate in the @xmath1 plane in the @xmath2 direction .",
    "let us assume the electron trajectories consisting of sinusoidal curves with amplitude @xmath3 and spatial semiperiod @xmath4 : @xmath5 .",
    "such a trajectory is presented in fig .",
    "[ path ] . from the condition of trajectory smoothness it follows that @xmath6 , where @xmath7 is the maximal speed of the electron in the @xmath2 direction , @xmath8 is the speed of light in vacuum , @xmath9 being the mean speed in the @xmath0 direction . because the oscillations in the @xmath2 direction are accompanied by the oscillations in the @xmath0 direction , for the mean square root of @xmath10 one will get @xmath11 , where @xmath12 is assumed to be constant ( we neglect the small energy losses conditioned by the radiation ) .",
    "from here it also follows that the undulator parameter @xmath13 of the electrons moving along trajectories with random spatial semiperiods is a constant quantity ( @xmath14 is the lorentz - factor ) .",
    "hence for the lorentz - factor conditioned by the longitudinal motion one can get : @xmath15 , where @xmath16 .        [ path ]    since the bunch electrons are indistinguishable from each other one can assume that each electron moves not along a trajectory which is made up from the embroidering of sinusoidal trajectories with different spatial semiperiods , but along a sinusoidal trajectory with unique spatial semiperiod @xmath4 .",
    "however , this assumption implies that the different electrons move along trajectories with different spatial semiperiods . as a consequence of the finiteness of the number of electrons in the bunch , @xmath4 is being a discrete quantity , but in our problem this discrete quantity",
    "can be considered as a continuum quantity , which obeys to the gamma distribution law .",
    "it is convenient to use the gamma distribution for the @xmath17 parameter , where @xmath18 is the mean value of the spatial semiperiods @xmath4 .",
    "this distribution is presented in the eqn .",
    "( [ gamma ] ) :    @xmath19    here the scaling parameter of the distribution is taken to be equal to the parameter @xmath20 which is the dispersion of the distribution and is conditioned by the non - regularity of the spatial semiperiod distribution . since @xmath21 the degree of non - regularity @xmath22 is being determined from the parameter @xmath20 : @xmath23 .    in fig .",

    "the radiation characteristics of the electron bunch are obtained by averaging the corresponding characteristics of the single electron radiation .",
    "it is known that the radiation spectrum width is conditioned by the energetic and angular divergence of the bunch electrons , as well as by the finiteness and non - regularity of the electron motion . in the most of the cases",
    "the angular divergence is negligible in comparison with the energetic divergence .",
    "in such a case the radiation spectrum width is being calculated from eqn .",

    "let us consider the case when the spectrum width is mainly conditioned by the random distribution of the quantity @xmath4 ( @xmath29 ) .",
    "we should note that during the radiation process of the relativistic electron the energy and momentum conservation laws allow radiation only under the small angles ( @xmath30 ) .",
    "in such a case for the angular - frequency distribution of the number of photons radiated from a bunch electron which moves along a trajectory with a spatial period @xmath31 , in the dipole approximation ( @xmath32 ) , switching to @xmath33 angles and @xmath34 dimensionless frequencies we can get :    @xmath35\\delta(x(q+u^2)-\\frac{2}{t}),\\ ] ]    where @xmath36 , @xmath37 is the fine structure constant and @xmath38 is the doubled number of electron oscillations along the distance @xmath28 .    to obtain the frequency distribution of the radiated photons one needs to integrate the eqn .",
