    "the discovery of superconductivity in iron - pnictide systems has attracted tremendous interests not only due to its scientific value but also its potential industrial applications [ 1 ] .",
    "the relatively high transition temperature , highly flexibility , very high upper - critical magnetic field and other physical qualities make the iron - pnictide systems very useful in industry [ 2 - 4 ] .",
    "the existing challenges , such as optimizing synthesis methods for technological applications and clarifying the ambiguity in the superconducting mechanism , will keep iron - pnictide systems on the frontiers of research for a long time , in parallel to high-@xmath7 cuprates [ 4 ] .    in order to determine the application parameters which are important to commercial use",
    ", great efforts have been made to grow high - quality single crystals of iron - pnictide superconductors [ 5 - 8 ] a lot of physical properties , such as the transition temperature , the upper critical field , the vortex structure , etc .",
    ", have been determined using single crystal samples . however , due to the relatively high melting temperature of the iron - pnictide samples , the single crystals of iron - pnictides are generally grown by using self - flux method or flux method where excess feas mixture or sn is used as the fluxing agent .",
    "the advantage of these methods is that the melting temperature can be significantly decreased comparing to the melting point of the crystal itself . while the disadvantage of these methods is unnegligible .",
    "for example , if we grow bafe@xmath0co@xmath1as@xmath2 single samples using excess fe(co)as mixture as fluxing agent , the actual fe / co ratio can not be accurately controlled in the growth procedure .",
    "if one uses sn as fluxing agent , the problem is that one can not remove the sn from the surface of the sample easily [ 5 ] . in this paper",
    "we report a simple , reliable method to grow high quality bafe@xmath0co@xmath1as@xmath2 single crystal samples without using any fluxing agent .",
    "the samples have typical dimensions of 4@xmath43@xmath40.5mm@xmath5 with @xmath6-axis perpendicular to the shining surface .",
    "the critical current density of the samples are also determined .",
    "the critical current density without external magnetic field is quite high , meaning large current carrying ability of the samples , which points to optimistic applications .",
    "single crystal samples were grown using well - crystalized bafe@xmath0co@xmath1as@xmath2 polycrystalline samples as the starting materials .",
    "the polycrystalline samples with nominal composition bafe@xmath0co@xmath1as@xmath2 were prepared by conventional solid - state reaction method using high - purity ba ( crystalline dendritic solid , 99.9% , alfa - aesar ) , fe ( powder , 99.9% , alfa - aesar ) , co ( powder , 99.9% , alfa - aesar ) , and as ( powder , 99% , alfa - aesar ) as starting materials .",
    "the crystalline dendritic solid ba was pressed into thin pellet using an agate mortar and was cut into very small size ( typically less than 0.5@xmath40.5 mm@xmath8 ) .",
    "the raw materials were mixed and wrapped up by ta foil and sealed in an evacuated quartz tube .",
    "they were pre - heated at 600@xmath9c for 12 hours and cooled down slowly to room temperature .",
    "the mixture was then ground and pressed into pellets and heated at 900@xmath9c for 24 hours .",
    "when the furnace was cooled down , the pellets were taken out and placed in an argon - filled glove box .",
    "we performed powder x - ray diffraction measurements on these samples and found that the samples were all in single phase .",
    "the polycrystalline powder was pressed into pellets and placed in a quartz tube in an argon - filled glove box .",
    "the quartz tube was sealed after it was evacuated by a molecular pump .",
    "then the quartz tube was placed into a box furnace .",
    "the furnace was heated to 1230@xmath3c at a rate of 60@xmath3c per hour . after holding at 1230@xmath3c for 12 hours ,",
    "it was cooled to 850@xmath3c at 2@xmath3c per hour followed by furnace cooling to room temperature .",
    "the quartz tube was found almost intact after the whole procedure .",
    "when we break the quartz tube and pick out the sample , slides of samples with shining surfaces can be easily cleaved .",
    "it should be noted that we have tried to melt the samples at even higher temperature using a double - wall quartz tube .",
    "however , we find that the samples begin to decompose at temperature higher than 1240@xmath3c .",
    "x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) was carried out by a rigaku - d / max - ga diffractometer using high - intensity cu - k@xmath10 radiation to screen for the presence of an impurity phase and the changes in structure .",
    "the homogeneity and chemical compositions of the samples were examined using an energy dispersive x - ray spectrometer ( edxs ) .",
    "the resistivity was measured using a standard four - probe method in a closed - cycle helium cryostat . the magnetic susceptibility and the magnetic hysteresis loops of the samples",
    "were determined by a squid magnetometer ( quantum design , mpms ) .",

    "we select several pieces of crystal and perform edxs measurement and find that the co - contents in all pieces are close to the nominal compositions , indicating that the samples having shining surface are chemically homogeneous .",
    "the nominal and measured compositions of the selected samples are summarized in table 1 . in order to judge the orientation of the samples , we perform x - ray diffraction ( xrd ) measurement on the as - grown samples .",
    "figure 1(b ) gives the typical xrd patterns of the bafe@xmath0co@xmath1as@xmath2 ( @xmath11=0 , 0.06 , 0.12 , 0.18 , 0.25 , and 0.35 ) samples .",
    "only the ( 00@xmath12 ) diffraction peaks with even @xmath12 are observed , confirming that the crystallographic @xmath6-axis is perpendicular to the shining surface .",
    "for all the diffraction peaks , the full width at half maximum ( fwhm ) is less than 0.06@xmath3 , indicating the excellent quality of the single crystals . in order to see the shift of the peaks clearly , we plot in fig .",
    "1(c ) the enlarged view of the ( 004 ) reflection .",
    "one can see that all the reflections are splitted into two shoulder peaks .",
    "the shoulder peak at lower angle is the reflection of the cu - k@xmath13@xmath14 radiation and the one at higher angle is the reflection of the cu - k@xmath13@xmath2 radiation .",
    "it can be seen that the ( 004 ) peak slightly shifts to higher angle with increasing co content , meaning that the @xmath6-axis constant decreases monotonously as the co content is increased .",

    "it is found that the superconducting transition occurs at 23.1 k , consistent with the resistivity results .",
    "for the magnetic susceptibility at @xmath19@xmath17@xmath7 , the susceptibility signal is almost undetectable within the accuracy limit of the @xmath20 @xmath21 mpms magnetometer ( about 10@xmath22 emu ) . in order to know the magnetic state at the normal state",
    ", we measure the temperature dependence of magnetic susceptibility under 1 tesla .",
    "the result is shown in fig .",
    "3(b ) . from fig .",
    "3(b ) we notice that the magnetic susceptibility exhibits almost temperature - independent behavior above @xmath7 , indicating that the magnetic state of the bafe@xmath23co@xmath18as@xmath2 system can not be the curie paramagnetism .",
    "the fact that the magnetization is very weak and temperature - independent suggest that the paramagnetic state is a pauli - paramagnetic state , which is consistent with the metallic behavior of the bafe@xmath23co@xmath18as@xmath2 system .",
    "the predominant pauli - paramagnetic state in the co - doped sample suggest that the magnetic moment of the electrons near the fermi surface should be delocalized .",
    "previous neutron scattering experiments on cafe@xmath2as@xmath2 have suggested that the magnetism is neither purely local nor purely itinerant and that it is a complicated mix of the two [ 9 ] . here",
    "the predominant pauli - paramagnetic state in the co - doped sample suggest that the itinerant moments might be dominate in the superconducting sample .     for the @xmath11=0.20 sample .",

    "( c ) the temperature dependence of critical current density for the @xmath11=0.20 sample under zero - field and under external magnetic field.,scaledwidth=75.0% ]    figure 4(a ) shows magnetic hysteresis loops at various temperatures below @xmath7 calculated by applying the magnetic field up to 6 t. the @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26 curves exhibit a central peak at zero magnetic field and the magnetization decreases continuously with increasing magnetic fields .",
    "the sharp peak around @xmath27@xmath28@xmath26 = 0 is similarly observed in other iron - pnictide materials [ 8 , 10 - 11 ] .",
    "figure 4(b ) shows the magnetic field dependence of the critical current density @xmath29 derived from the hysteresis loop width by bean critical state model using the relation @xmath29 = 20@xmath30@xmath24@xmath31@xmath32(1- @xmath33 ) [ 12 ] , where @xmath32 and @xmath34 are the width and length of the sample , respectively ( @xmath32@xmath35@xmath34 ) , and @xmath30@xmath24 is the difference between the upper and the lower branches in the @xmath24@xmath25@xmath26 loops .",
    "it is found from fig .",
    "4(b ) that the critical current density @xmath29 of the sample reaches to 1.2@xmath410@xmath36 a / cm@xmath8 without external magnetic field .",
    "we notice that this @xmath29 value is higher than previous reported @xmath29 value of bafe@xmath0co@xmath1as@xmath2 single crystal samples , either grown using self - flux method or using flux method [ 8,13 - 15 ] .",
    "for example , the @xmath29 values of recent grown co - doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystal thin films are within the range of 60 - 100 ka / cm@xmath8 at 12 k ( without external magnetic field ) [ 8 ] , which is less than the value of 280 ka / cm@xmath8 in present sample .",
    "the @xmath29 value of a bafe@xmath23co@xmath18as@xmath2 sample grown by self - flux method is about 6@xmath410@xmath38 a / cm@xmath8 at 5 k [ 13 ] . for a bafe@xmath39co@xmath40as@xmath2 single crystal grown using sn flux ,",
    "the @xmath29 value at 16 k under 6 tesla is about 5 ka / cm@xmath8 [ 14 ] , which is also less than the value of 26 ka / cm@xmath8 in present case .",
    "based on these facts we suggest that the samples grown without any fluxing agent may have better current carrying ability comparing to those from flux growth . but this value is slightly less than the highest critical current density of 4 ma / cm@xmath8 in co - doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 epitaxial films which was recently grown on ( la , sr)(al , ta)o@xmath41 substrates [ 16 ] .",
    "the comparison between single crystals grown using different methods reveals that further improvement of critical current density is still possible .",
    "considering that the bafe@xmath0co@xmath1as@xmath2 samples have upper critical field as high as 60 t , critical temperatures of above 20 k , low anisotropy , and , as shown here , high intrinsic critical current density , these materials can be considered as good candidates for applications .",
    "the @xmath29 value decreases both with increasing temperature and with increasing external magnetic field , as can be seen from figs .",
    "4(b ) and ( c ) . at low temperatures ( @xmath4220 k ) ,",
    "the trend of @xmath29 decay is similar to that of conventional high-@xmath7 cuprates [ 17 ] . at high temperature ( @xmath1720 k ) , the flux creep effect is evident by showing relatively strong dependence of critical current density on the external magnetic field [ 18 ] .",
    "in summary , we have grown large - size co - doped bafe@xmath2as@xmath2 single crystals without using any fluxing agent .",
    "we find that the as - grown samples have larger current carrying ability comparing to those grown with the aid of fluxing agent , indicating promising industrial applications .",
