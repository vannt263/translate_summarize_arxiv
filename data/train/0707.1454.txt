    "entanglement renormalization @xcite is a numerical technique based on locally reorganizing the hilbert space of a quantum many - body system with the aim to reduce the amount of entanglement in its wave function .",
    "it was introduced to address a major computational obstacle in real space renormalization group ( rg ) methods @xcite , responsible for limitations in their performance and range of applicability , namely the proliferation of degrees of freedom that occurs under successive applications of a rg transformation .",
    "entanglement renormalization is built around the assumption that , as a result of the local character of physical interactions , some of the relevant degrees of freedom in the ground state of a many - body system can be decoupled from the rest by unitarily transforming small regions of space .",
    "accordingly , unitary transformations known as _ disentanglers _ are applied locally to the system in order to identify and decouple such degrees of freedom , which are then safely removed and therefore do no longer appear in any subsequent coarse - grained description .",
    "this prevents the harmful accumulation of degrees of freedom and thus leads to a sustainable real space rg transformation , able to explore arbitrarily large @xmath1 and @xmath2 lattice systems , even at a quantum critical point .",
    "it also leads to the _ multi - scale entanglement renormalization ansatz _ ( mera ) , a variational ansatz for many - body states @xcite .",
    "the mera , based in turn on a class of quantum circuits , is particularly successful at describing ground states at quantum criticality @xcite or with topological order @xcite . from the computational viewpoint ,",
    "the key property of the mera is that it can be manipulated efficiently , due to the causal structure of the underlying quantum circuit @xcite . as a result",
    ", it is possible to efficiently evaluate the expected value of local observables , and to efficiently optimize its tensors . thus , well - established simulation techniques for matrix product states , such as energy minimization @xcite or simulation of time evolution @xcite , can be readily generalized to the mera @xcite .    in this paper",
    "we describe a simple algorithm ( and several variations thereof ) to compute an approximation of the low energy subspace of a local hamiltonian with the mera , and present benchmark calculations for 1d lattice systems .",
    "our goal is to provide the interested reader with a rather self - contained explanation of the algorithm , with enough information to implement it .",

    "[ sect : benchmark ] presents benchmark calculations for different 1d quantum lattice models , namely ising , 3-level potts , xx and heisenberg models .",
    "we compute ground state energies , magnetizations and two - point correlators throughout the phase diagram , which includes a second order quantum phase transition .",
    "we find that , at the critical point of an infinite system , the error in the ground state energy decays exponentially with the refinement parameter @xmath6 , whereas the two - point correlators remain accurate even at distances of millions of lattice sites .",
    "we then extract critical exponents from the order parameter and from two - point correlators .",
    "finally , we also compute a mera that includes the first excited state , from which the energy gap can be obtained and seen to vanish as @xmath7 at criticality .",
    "this paper replaces similar notes on mera algorithms presented in ref .",
    "for the sake of concreteness , we have not included several of the algorithms of ref .",
    "@xcite , which nevertheless remain valid proposals .",
    "we have also focused the discussion on a ternary mera for 1d lattices ( instead of the binary mera used in all previous references ) because it is somewhat computationally advantageous ( e.g. see computation of two - point correlators ) and also leads to a much more convenient generalization in 2d .",

    "the computational cost in the second scheme is much smaller than in the first scheme.,width=302 ]    regarding the mera from the perspective of the renormalization group is quite instructive .",
    "it tells us that this ansatz is likely to describe states with a specific structure of internal correlations , namely , states in which the entanglement is organized in different length scales .",
    "let us briefly explain what we mean by this .",
    "we say that the state @xmath26 contains entanglement at a given length scale @xmath67 if by applying a unitary operation ( i.e. a disentangler ) on a region @xmath68 of linear size @xmath67 , we are able to decouple ( i.e. disentangle ) some of the local degrees of freedom , that is , if we are able to convert the state @xmath26 into a product state @xmath69 , where @xmath10 is the state of the local degrees of freedom that have been decoupled and @xmath70 is the state of the rest of the system .",

    "what makes the mera useful is that the entanglement in most ground states of local hamiltonians seems to decompose into moderate contributions corresponding to different length scales .",
    "we can identify two behaviors , depending on whether the system is in a phase characterized by symmetry - breaking order or by topological order ( see @xcite and references therein ) . in systems with symmetry - breaking order",
    ", ground - state entanglement spans all length scales @xmath67 smaller than the correlation length @xmath74 in the system  and , consequently , at a quantum critical point , where the correlation length @xmath74 diverges , entanglement is present at all length scales @xcite . in a system with topological order ,",
    "instead , the ground state displays some form of ( topological ) entanglement affecting all length scales even when the correlation length vanishes @xcite .",
    "we have introduced the mera as a tensor network originating in a quantum circuit .",
    "its tensors have incoming and outgoing wires / indices according to a well - defined direction of time in the circuit .",
    "therefore , a mera can be regarded as a tensor network equipped with a ( fictitious ) time direction and with two properties :    * its tensors are isometric ( eq . [ eq : isometry ] ) . * past causal cones have bounded width ( fig . [",
    "fig : causalcone ] ) .    from a computational perspective , these are the only properties that we need to retain . in particular , there is no need to keep the vector space dimension of the quantum wires ( equivalently , of the sites in the coarse - grained lattice ) constant throughout the tensor network .",
    "accordingly , we will consider a mera where the vector space dimension of a site of lattice @xmath45 , denoted @xmath75 , may depend on the layer @xmath43 ( this dimension could also be different for each individual site of layer @xmath43 , but for simplicity we will not consider this case here ) .",
    "notice that @xmath76 corresponds to the sites of the original lattice @xmath12 .",
    "* bond dimension. * often , however , the sites in most layers will have the same vector space dimension ( except , for instance , the sites of the original lattice @xmath12 , with @xmath76 , or the single site of the top lattice @xmath77 , with dimension @xmath21 ) . in this case",
    "we denote the dominant dimension simply by @xmath6 , and we refer to the mera as having _ bond dimension _ @xmath6 .",
    "the computational cost of the algorithms described in subsequent sections is often expressed as a power of the bond dimension @xmath6 .",
    "* rank. * we refer to the dimension @xmath21 of the space @xmath78 ( corresponding to the single site of the uppermost lattice @xmath79 ) as the rank of the mera . for @xmath80 ,",
    "the mera represents a pure state @xmath81 .",
    "more generally , a rank @xmath21 mera encodes a @xmath21-dimensional subspace @xmath17 .",
    "for instance , given a hamiltonian @xmath82 on the lattice @xmath12 , we could use a rank @xmath21 mera to describe the ground subspace of @xmath82 ( assuming it had dimension @xmath21 ) ; or the ground state of @xmath82 ( if it was not degenerate ) and its @xmath83 excitations with lowest energy .",
    "the isometric transformation @xmath84 in eq .",
    "[ eq : u ] can be used to build a projector @xmath85 , @xmath86 onto the subspace @xmath17 .",
    "given the above definition of the mera , many different realizations are possible depending on what kind of isometric tensors are used and how they are interconnected .",
    "we have already met two examples for a 1d lattice , based on a binary and ternary underlying tree .",
    "[ fig:2daltschemes ] shows two schemes for a 2d square lattice .",
    "it is natural to ask , given a lattice geometry , what realization of the mera is the most convenient from a computational point of view .",
    "a definitive answer to this question does not seem simple .",
    "an important factor , however , is given by the fixed - point size of the support of local observables under successive rg transformations  which corresponds to the width of the past causal cones .",
    "* support of local observables. * in each mera scheme , under successive coarse - graining transformations a local operator eventually becomes supported in a characteristic number of sites .",
    "this is the result of two competing effects : disentanglers @xmath23 tend to extend the support of the local observable ( by adding new sites at its boundary ) , whereas the isometries @xmath11 tend to reduce it ( by transforming blocks of sites into single sites ) .",
    "for instance , in the binary 1d mera , local observables end up supported in three contiguous sites ( fig .",
    "[ fig:2mera ] ) , whereas in the ternary 1d mera local observables become supported in two contiguous sites ( fig .",
    "[ fig:3mera ] ) .    therefore , an important difference between the binary and ternary 1d schemes is in the natural support of local observables .",
    "this can be seen to imply that the cost of a computation scales as a larger power of the bond dimension @xmath6 for the binary scheme than for the ternary scheme , namely as @xmath87 compared to @xmath88 .",
    "however , it turns out that the binary scheme is more effective at removing entanglement , and as a result a smaller @xmath6 is already sufficient in order to achieve the same degree of accuracy in the computation of , say , a ground state energy . in the end",
    ", we find that for the 1d systems analyzed in sect .",
    "[ sect : benchmark ] , the two effects compensate and the cost required in both schemes in order to achieve the same accuracy is comparable . on the other hand , in the ternary 1d mera , two - point correlators between selected sites can be computed at a cost @xmath88 , whereas analogous calculations in the binary 1d mera are much more expensive .",
    "therefore in any context where the calculation of two - point correlators is important , the ternary 1d mera is a better choice .",
    "the number of possible realizations of the mera for 2d lattices is greater than for 1d lattices . for a square lattice , the two schemes of fig .",
    "[ fig:2daltschemes ] are obvious generalizations of the above ones for 1d lattices .",
    "the first scheme , proposed in @xcite ( see also @xcite ) , involves isometries of type @xmath89 and the natural support of local observables is a block of @xmath66 sites .",
    "the second scheme involves isometries of type @xmath90 and local observables end up supported in blocks of @xmath65 sites . here , the much narrower causal cones of the second scheme leads to a much better scaling of the computational cost with @xmath6 , only @xmath91 compared to @xmath92 for the first scheme .",
    "another remark in relation to possible realizations concerns the type of tensors we use .",
    "so far we have insisted in distinguishing between disentanglers @xmath23 ( unitary tensors of type @xmath93 ) and isometries @xmath11 ( isometric tensors of type @xmath94 ) .",
    "we will continue to use this terminology throughout this paper , but we emphasize that a more general form of isometric tensor , e.g. of type @xmath95 , that both disentangles the system and coarse - grains sites , is possible and is actually used in some realizations @xcite .     and isometries @xmath11 are different ( denoted by different colouring ) .",
    "notice that there are @xmath96 disentanglers ( isometries ) in the first layer , @xmath97 in the second , and more generally @xmath98 in layer @xmath43 , so that the total number of tensors is @xmath99 .",
    "therefore the total number of parameters required to specify the mera is proportional to the size @xmath3 of the lattice @xmath12 .",
    "( ii ) in order to represent a state / subspace that is invariant under translations , we choose all disentanglers and isometries on a given layer of the mera to be the same . in this case the mera is completely specified by @xmath5 disentanglers and isometries .",
    "( iii ) in a scale invariant mera , the same disentangler and isometry is in addition used in all layers.,width=302 ]      symmetries have a direct impact on the efficiency of computations , because they can be used to drastically reduce the number of parameters in the mera .",

    "all these tensors are chosen to be different .",
    "therefore , for fixed @xmath6 the number of parameters in the mera scales linearly in @xmath3 .    however , in the presence of translation invariance , one can use a _ translation invariant _ mera , where we choose all the disentanglers @xmath23 and isometries @xmath11 of any given layer @xmath43 to be the same , thus reducing the number of parameters to @xmath5 ( if there are @xmath40 layers ) .",
    "we emphasize that a translation invariant mera , as just defined , does not necessarily represent a translation invariant state @xmath16 or subspace @xmath17 .",
    "the reason is that different sites of @xmath12 are placed in inequivalent positions with respect to the mera . as a result ,",
    "often the mera can only approximately reproduce translation invariant states / subspaces , although the departure from translation invariance is seen to typically decrease fast with increasing @xmath6 . in order to further mitigate inhomogeneities",

    "these occur at distances @xmath445 for @xmath446 and are evaluated with cost @xmath88 .",
    "evaluation of arbitrary correlators is possible ( see fig .",

    "the time evolution algorithm has a clear advantage : it can be used both to compute the ground state of a local hamiltonian ( by simulating an evolution in imaginary time ) and to study lattice dynamics ( by simulating an evolution in real time ) .",
