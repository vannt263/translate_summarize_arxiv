    "a better understanding of the transport properties of random media , such as fluid flow in sandstones or electrical conductivity of composites requires the micro - structure as input @xcite .",
    "digitized , three - dimensional micro - structures of natural sandstones are difficult and expensive to obtain @xcite .",
    "thus there is a need for simulation algorithms that are able to provide representative micro - structures from statistical probability functions .",
    "recently various algorithms have been proposed for the reconstruction of random micro - structures @xcite . in this paper",
    "we investigate a simulated annealing method that enforces agreement between the correlation functions of the original and the reconstructed micro - structure @xcite . to save computation time",
    "the authors of @xcite have evaluated the correlation functions only in certain directions assuming isotropy of the medium .",
    "the objective of this paper is to study the effect of this simplification on the final , reconstructed configurations .",
    "we test the effects on two examples : ( i ) the correlation function of a fontainebleau sandstone and ( ii ) an artificial correlation function with damped oscillations .",
    "the results show , that at least for the oscillating correlation function this yields significantly different configurations .",
    "more importantly , the reconstructions are anisotropic as a result of the simplified evaluation of the correlation functions .",
    "we follow the reconstruction algorithm proposed in @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction is performed on a @xmath0-dimensional hyper - cubic lattice @xmath1 ( @xmath2 for the results presented below ) . whether a lattice point lies within pore space or matrix space",
    "is indicated by the characteristic function @xmath3{0mm}{2ex}}(\\vec x)= { \\chi\\rule[-1ex]{0mm}{2ex}}(x_1 , x_2 , \\dots , x_d )   = \\left\\ {    \\begin{array}[]{l }      0 \\quad \\hbox{for } \\quad \\vec x \\in \\ppp \\\\      1 \\quad \\hbox{for } \\quad \\vec x \\in \\mmm     \\end{array }    \\right.\\ ] ] with @xmath4 where @xmath5 denotes the pore space and @xmath6 the matrix space of a two phase porous medium .",
    "the @xmath7 are in units of the lattice spacing @xmath8 .",
    "the porosity @xmath9 is given as @xmath10{0mm}{2ex}}(\\vec x_j)\\right)$ ] where @xmath11 is the total number of lattice sites .",
    "simulated annealing is an iterative technique for combinatorial optimization problems .",
    "the iteration steps are denoted by a subscript @xmath12 .",
    "the optimum is found by lowering a fictitious temperature @xmath13 that controls the acceptance or rejection of configurations with `` energy '' ( or cost function ) @xmath14 .",
    "the energy function used in our simulations is defined as @xmath15 where @xmath16 is a subset of lattice points and @xmath17 is the @xmath18th function of a set of @xmath19 statistical probability functions calculated for the configuration of step @xmath12 .",
    "for example @xmath17 may be a @xmath18-point correlation function .",
    "the real valued factor @xmath20 is a weight for the @xmath18th function .",
    "hence , the energy can be understood as a measure for the deviations of the probability functions @xmath17 from predefined reference functions @xmath21 .",
    "the simulated annealing algorithm consists of the following steps .",
    "1 .   initialization : the 0 s and 1 s are randomly distributed with given porosity @xmath9 .",
    "two lattice points of different phase are chosen at random and exchanged . in this way",
    "the porosity @xmath9 is conserved .",
    "the `` energy '' @xmath14 of the current configuration is calculated according to equation ( [ eq : energy ] ) .",
    "4 .   the `` temperature '' @xmath13 is adjusted according to a fixed cooling schedule .",
    "the new configuration created by the exchange of the two points is accepted with probability @xmath22 in case of rejection , the two points are restored and the old configuration is left unchanged .",
    "return to step 2 .    as can be seen from equation ( [ eq : p ] ) , configurations with lower energy",
    "are immediately accepted while the acceptance of a configuration with higher energy is controlled by the temperature @xmath23 . in order to obtain a configuration with minimal energy @xmath24 or , in other words , a configuration with minimal deviations of the probability functions @xmath25 from their reference functions @xmath26",
    ", the temperature @xmath23 has to be lowered in a suitable way .",
    "the algorithm is applicable to various functions @xmath25 .",
    "most authors propose the two point correlation function @xcite . assuming homogeneity and ergodicity",
    ", the two - point correlation function can be defined for our case as @xmath27{0mm}{2ex}}(\\vec x ) { \\chi\\rule[-1ex]{0mm}{2ex}}(\\vec x + \\vec r ) \\ket -      ( 1-\\phi)^2}{\\phi - \\phi^2 }    .\\ ] ] where the average @xmath28 indicates a spatial average over all lattice sites @xmath29 . if @xmath30 is known a single update step of the annealing process requires the recalculation of the correlations of the two pixels that are exchanged in step 2 with all other pixels .",
    "the numerical effort to obtain @xmath31 is therefore proportional to @xmath32 where @xmath32 is the total number of lattice points . in the reconstruction of three - dimensional porous media with @xmath33",
    "this leads to unacceptably long calculation times and therefore one has to find ways to speed up this calculation .",
    "one possibility for reducing the numerical effort is to truncate @xmath34 at a value @xmath35 for which @xmath36 for @xmath37 holds .",
    "below we set @xmath38 for @xmath39 where @xmath35 is a parameter in the reconstruction . for isotropic media ,",
    "where @xmath40 with @xmath41 , it was suggested in @xcite to calculate @xmath42 only in certain directions by setting @xmath43 where @xmath44 is an arbitrary unit vector . in the two - dimensional reconstructions",
    "presented below @xmath45 will be set to the radial unit vector in a polar coordinate system @xmath46 where @xmath47 and @xmath48 are the unit vectors of the cartesian coordinate system and @xmath49 is the angle between @xmath47 and @xmath50 .",
    "hence , instead of equation ( [ eq : acf_gen ] ) we use @xmath51{0mm}{2ex}}(\\vec x ) { \\chi\\rule[-1ex]{0mm}{2ex}}(\\vec x + r\\vec e_{k } ) \\ket -      ( 1-\\phi)^2}{\\phi - \\phi^2}\\ ] ] with @xmath52 in the simplified reconstruction scheme .",
    "since ( [ eq : acf_simple ] ) is a set of @xmath19 one - dimensional correlation functions the numerical effort is reduced by a factor of roughly @xmath53 as compared to ( [ eq : acf_gen ] ) .",
    "the above algorithm is now used to reconstruct two - dimensional , isotropic media with correlation function @xmath54 with @xmath55 in units of the lattice spacing and @xmath56 .",
    "the same function was used by the authors of @xcite to exemplify their algorithm . in the evaluation of the correlation functions",
    "periodic boundary conditions are assumed .",
    "we use an exponential decrease of the temperature @xmath57 the remaining parameters are the lattice size @xmath58 and the porosity @xmath59 .",
    "they are the same as in @xcite .",
    "the following reconstructions have all been initialized with the same random seed .",
    "the algorithm terminated when the configuration did not change for 20000 subsequent update steps .",
    "in the first reconstruction , the correlation function was calculated only in the horizontal and vertical direction , i.e. equations ( [ eq : energy ] ) and ( [ eq : acf_simple ] ) were used with @xmath60 , @xmath61 and @xmath62 .",
    "both correlation functions @xmath63 had the same weight @xmath64 and the same reference function @xmath65 given in equation ( [ eq : acf_osc ] ) was used .",
    "the correlation function was truncated at @xmath66 .",
    "figure [ fig : figure_1 ] shows the final configuration of the reconstruction .",
    "a similar pattern was found in @xcite .",
    "the pattern consists of stripes in direction of @xmath67 and in direction @xmath68 .",
    "the distance between the stripes is determined by the cosine term . on a larger length scale ,",
    "the pattern organizes into several regions in which all lines are parallel .",
    "the typical size of these regions is given by roughly 20 in view of equation ( [ eq : acf_osc ] ) and figure [ fig : figure_2 ] . clearly , the pattern is not isotropic as it should be .",
    "the stripes are preferentially directed along the directions @xmath69 and @xmath68 .",
    "also , one expects that the oscillation frequency @xmath70 of the correlation function in direction @xmath71 is not @xmath56 but @xmath72 .",
    "figure [ fig : figure_2 ] shows the correlation functions for the configuration of figure [ fig : figure_1 ] in the directions of the unit vectors @xmath73 and @xmath69 .",
    "the first and second have been used for the reconstruction and hence show good agreement with the reference function while the latter deviates drastically . the correlation in direction",
    "@xmath69 is better described by the function @xmath74 shown as the dotted line .",
    "this may be interpreted as the arithmetic mean of the correlation function for regions ( described above ) with stripes perpendicular to the direction @xmath69 given by the first term in equation ( [ eq : fit ] ) and the correlation function for regions with stripes parallel to the direction @xmath69 given by the second term .",
    "of course , the same correlation function is found in direction @xmath68 .",
    "one step towards an isotropic reconstruction may be to use @xmath75 , and to force agreement of the correlations not only in two but in four directions @xmath76 , @xmath77 , @xmath69 and @xmath78 .",
    "the resulting configuration is shown in figure [ fig : figure_3 ] .",
    "the pattern is significantly different from the pattern of figure [ fig : figure_1 ] .",
    "there are not only stripes parallel to the diagonal directions but more rounded formations and concentric circles at some points .",
    "the correlation functions for figure [ fig : figure_3 ] are plotted in figure [ fig : figure_4 ] .",
    "surprisingly we find that it is not possible to obtain agreement with the reference correlation function .",
    "the resulting correlation functions in the horizontal , vertical and diagonal direction all deviate strongly from the reference function especially at the first minimum .",
    "additional simulations with different cooling schedules , damping factors and frequency of the correlation function did not give better agreement .",
    "we have also varied the system sizes from @xmath79 up to @xmath80 .",
    "the results were identical .",
    "figure [ fig : sand ] shows the two - dimensional reconstructions of a fontainebleau sandstone with porosity @xmath81 .",
    "the correlation function was truncated at @xmath82 .",
    "the reconstruction of figure [ fig : sand]a used the correlation function only in vertical @xmath83 and horizontal @xmath77 direction as suggested in @xcite .",
    "the reconstruction shown in figure [ fig : sand]b , however , calculates the full two - dimensional correlation function according to ( [ eq : acf_gen ] ) where the two - dimensional correlation function was radially binned in the calculations to obtain a one - dimensional function which can be compared to the one - dimensional , isotropic correlation function of the original sandstone .",
    "we emphasize that in this calculation the two - dimensional correlation function was evaluated without restrictions or simplifications .",
    "therefore , the calculation needed about 50 times longer than the simplified reconstruction . again , there are differences visible although they are smaller than those in the reconstructions using ( [ eq : acf_osc ] ) .",
    "the shape of the pores in the full reconstruction ( figure [ fig : sand]b ) appear to be smoother and there is not as much `` dust '' visible as in the simplified ( restricted ) reconstruction shown in figure [ fig : sand]a .",
    "the correlation functions plotted in figure [ fig : figure_6 ] reveal also that the reconstructed micro - structure in figure [ fig : sand]a is strongly anisotropic while the micro - structure in figure [ fig : sand]b is isotropic as it should be .",
    "in summary we note that the statistical reconstruction of porous media with predefined two - point correlation function often requires some reduction of numerical effort .",
    "especially the reconstruction of three - dimensional porous media in reasonable time does not seem possible without such simplifications in the calculation of the correlation function .",
    "of course this problem is exacerbated if one wishes to include three - point or even higher order correlation functions .",
    "we applied a simplification proposed and used in @xcite which samples the correlation function only in certain directions .",
    "the effect of this simplification on the final configurations may in some cases be negligible but in general configurations strong anisotropy and patterns which are significantly different from those of a proper isotropic reconstruction may appear as a result .",
